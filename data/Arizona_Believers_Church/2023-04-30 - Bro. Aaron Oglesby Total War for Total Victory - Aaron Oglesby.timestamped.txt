[0:00] I'd like to speak to you for just a just
[0:02] a moment. Excuse me. On total war for
[0:07] total victory. Total war for total
[0:11] victory.
[0:13] In our scripture reading here, the Lord
[0:14] is speaking of what it is that he's
[0:17] going to do for Israel as they come and
[0:20] and take the promised land. And and and
[0:22] as it is with the Lord, he's speaking
[0:24] very straightforward. Um he he doesn't
[0:26] speak in may. He doesn't speak in in
[0:29] hopeos. He says, "When I bring you to
[0:32] the land," notice there isn't a
[0:34] hopefully we get there. Um I'm I'm sure
[0:37] hoping that we get through the
[0:38] wilderness and that you should know. He
[0:39] says, "When I bring you to the land,"
[0:42] and he says then once again in verse
[0:44] two, he says, "And when the Lord shall
[0:46] deliver them before or deliver them unto
[0:50] thee." This is this is how our God
[0:52] operates. Our God doesn't operate in
[0:55] uncertain terms. when when he speaks a
[0:57] word or he makes a promise, that word is
[0:59] going to come to pass. No matter what it
[1:02] is, he has to do in order to bring it to
[1:05] pass. There there's no stone that he's
[1:07] going to leave unturned. He he told
[1:08] Abraham, he said, "Thy seed shall
[1:11] sojourn in a strange land for for 400
[1:14] years, and then they're going to be
[1:15] slaves." He says, "But after that,
[1:17] they're going to be delivered and I'm"
[1:19] and there's already a land waiting for
[1:21] them that they're going to go to and
[1:23] that they're going to possess. And now
[1:25] if you look at that through our eyes,
[1:26] there were a lot of circumstances that
[1:28] made that seem quite impossible. There
[1:30] were a lot of circumstances that made it
[1:32] seem like h how is this going to come to
[1:34] pass? First of all, they were slaves.
[1:36] Not only were they slaves, but they were
[1:38] slaves to the mightiest kingdom in the
[1:40] world. Egypt was mighty. And between
[1:42] Egypt and the promised land, there was a
[1:44] Red Sea. And and and in there was a
[1:47] wilderness. And in that wilderness,
[1:48] there were serpents. And in that
[1:50] wilderness, they needed food. And in
[1:51] that wilderness, they needed water. And
[1:53] once they crossed that wilderness, then
[1:55] there was Jericho. And then once they
[1:57] got past Jericho, there were other
[1:58] nations that were mightier than them
[2:00] that possessed the land already. But the
[2:03] Lord said, "I'm going to take you to the
[2:05] land, and I'm going to deliver them into
[2:08] your hands." Listen this morning. The
[2:10] Lord doesn't just say things.
[2:12] The Lord doesn't just put things on the
[2:14] Bible to take up to take up room on a
[2:16] page. I'll take it a step further. He
[2:18] didn't have a prophet just say things to
[2:20] take up room on a tape. If he said
[2:22] things, if he gave you promises, and I
[2:24] promise you today, he's going to keep
[2:26] his promise. If he said he's the healer,
[2:28] he's still the healer today. If he said
[2:30] he's the savior, he's still the savior
[2:31] today. If he said he'd give you the
[2:33] baptism of the Holy Ghost, the baptism
[2:35] of the Holy Ghost is still for you
[2:38] today. Amen. Our God doesn't just say
[2:41] things. He doesn't play war as as it is.
[2:44] Once he has spoken something, he's going
[2:46] to do whatever it takes to bring it to
[2:49] pass. Listen, Pharaoh thought he could
[2:51] stop them. What happened to Pharaoh?
[2:53] They were destroyed. The Red Sea got in
[2:55] the way, but the Red Sea was rolled
[2:56] back. They were hungry, so food fell.
[2:59] Mana fell. They were thirsty, so water
[3:01] came from the rock. Listen, they walked
[3:02] right through the River Jordan at the
[3:05] middle of flood stage. And then the
[3:06] walls of Jericho fell. Why did ALL THOSE
[3:09] THINGS HAPPEN? BECAUSE the Lord had made
[3:11] a promise. Listen, there's been a
[3:13] promise in this day that he's going to
[3:15] have a church that takes a rapture. And
[3:17] whatever it is that's in your way,
[3:18] whatever it is that's slowing you down,
[3:20] just remember he said I could have the
[3:22] rapture. HE SAID, "I TAKE A BODY
[3:24] CHANGE." SO WHATEVER IT TAKES,
[3:26] WHATEVER'S HINDERING YOU, WHATEVER IS IN
[3:28] THE WAY TODAY, our God is going to bring
[3:30] it down at your feet. Amen. I believe
[3:33] that this morning,
[3:35] it didn't matter what had to happen to
[3:37] fulfill his word, he was going to do it.
[3:39] That should give us such courage this
[3:41] morning.
[3:42] Why? Why, brother? And because there's
[3:43] been a word spoken over you. There's
[3:46] been a word that said, "I'll have a
[3:47] church without spot or wrinkle." How's
[3:49] he going to DO THAT? I DON'T KNOW. I
[3:50] DIDN'T SAY IT. I don't know. I'm not the
[3:52] one that made the promise. I look at
[3:54] myself in the mirror and I go, "Lord, I
[3:56] alone messed that scripture up."
[3:59] There's plenty of spots and plenty of
[4:01] wrinkles RIGHT HERE, BUT I'M NOT THE one
[4:03] that gave that promise. He said he would
[4:05] have a church. He's Listen, there's a
[4:07] VISION THAT'S ALREADY SAW THE BRIDE
[4:08] GOING UP. When others went down, you
[4:10] went up. SO, I'M TELLING YOU TODAY, TAKE
[4:13] COURAGE. He's going to bring it to pass.
[4:16] Amen.
[4:17] It doesn't matter what he has to do.
[4:20] Well, brother Aaron, you don't
[4:21] understand. My problems are really
[4:23] stacking up. Join the club.
[4:27] My difficulties, this is going wrong. My
[4:30] job situation, the marriage situation.
[4:33] Come on, real talk.
[4:35] My kids are struggling. This one's gone
[4:37] out into the world. My problems are
[4:38] really stacking up. That's okay because
[4:41] in our opening scripture, if you read
[4:43] it, God tells them there are seven
[4:45] different nations there and they're all
[4:47] greater than you. You talk about
[4:49] problems stacking up.
[4:51] You talk about the odds being against
[4:53] you.
[4:54] All seven of them by themselves can
[4:56] whoop you and you're going to face all
[4:58] seven of them.
[5:01] Seven nations greater and mightier than
[5:03] thou. But listen, let me remind you of
[5:05] something. The strength of your enemies
[5:07] only serves to magnitude the greatness
[5:09] of your God.
[5:10] The strength of your trial only serves
[5:12] to magnify the greatness of the victory
[5:14] that he's going to deliver you in. Amen.
[5:17] Amen. And and and as soon as he lets
[5:19] them know how impossible it's going to
[5:21] be. There's seven nations greater than
[5:24] you. THERE'S A LOT FACING YOU IN LEOSA.
[5:27] There's a lot of things trying TO HINDER
[5:29] YOU FROM YOUR VICTORY. There's a lot of
[5:31] things trying to keep you from making it
[5:33] to the end to the rapture. And as soon
[5:35] as he tells them how difficult it's
[5:37] going to be, he says, "And when the Lord
[5:41] shall deliver them before thee, thou
[5:43] shalt smite them."
[5:46] And I'm telling you today, he's not
[5:47] going to withhold any resource from you.
[5:49] He's not going to withhold any promise
[5:51] from you. He will employ whatever force
[5:54] is necessary.
[5:56] THINK RIGHT NOW WITHIN YOURSELF, WHAT is
[5:58] it that you're facing today? What is the
[6:00] trial in your home? What is the trial in
[6:02] your heart? What is the trial in your
[6:04] family? And then think, and when the
[6:07] Lord shall deliver me. And when I come
[6:09] out of this trial and when I am
[6:12] victorious. NOT IF, NOT MAYBE, but Lord,
[6:15] I know it's going to happen. YOUR WORD
[6:16] DECLARED IT. YOUR WORD PROMISED IT. AND
[6:19] WHEN I COME THROUGH THIS, HALLELUJAH.
[6:21] You can rejoice in that this morning.
[6:26] The Lord Jesus didn't bring them out and
[6:28] abandon them in the wilderness.
[6:30] Church, it's important to understand
[6:31] that the message not only took them out.
[6:33] How many's happy you've been brought
[6:35] out?
[6:36] But the message was also to take them
[6:37] through and take them in.
[6:40] He didn't bring us here to abandon us.
[6:43] He didn't call us to leave us.
[6:46] Hallelujah. Was it going to be easy? Not
[6:49] a chance.
[6:51] There won't be one inch of this journey
[6:54] that's going to be easy.
[6:57] Why? Well, because we're in a battle.
[6:59] That's right.
[7:00] Battles aren't easy.
[7:02] Battles are difficult. But the Lord
[7:04] says, "I will deliver the enemy into
[7:08] your hands."
[7:09] And then he didn't stop there.
[7:12] You have a job to do.
[7:14] He says, "I'm going to deliver them into
[7:16] your hands, and you shall smite them."
[7:21] You shall smite them. We can't forget
[7:23] the part that we have to play in our
[7:25] victory. Amen.
[7:26] He delivers the enemy, but then you
[7:29] shall smite them. Prophet of God says,
[7:31] "Remember, we are not on a picnic,
[7:34] but we're in a battlefield."
[7:37] Many people just think that when they
[7:39] become a Christian, that that's all they
[7:40] need to do. That that settles it forever
[7:43] as they are a Christian and everything's
[7:45] going to come easy. Don't never get that
[7:49] in your head. For I become a Christian
[7:52] to fight the good fight of faith. I
[7:55] become a Christian to get in the battle
[7:57] lines. Amen.
[7:58] He says, "Now, Satan will constantly
[8:00] punch at you until you're finished here
[8:03] on the earth." Amen.
[8:06] He says, "Just remember that you'll
[8:08] never have a time, but what? There's a
[8:10] punching going on all the time." Can you
[8:13] testify that to be the truth?
[8:15] Amen. HE SAYS, "BECAUSE YOU'RE IN A
[8:17] BATTLE." DID YOU ask to come to Christ
[8:19] to go on a picnic? Well, you're sure
[8:22] going to be surprised
[8:24] because it's a constant battle.
[8:27] Church, this should scare you to death
[8:28] this morning if the devil's not hot on
[8:30] your trail.
[8:31] It should scare you to death if he's not
[8:33] fighting you at every turn.
[8:36] If he's not fighting you at every turn,
[8:38] you might want to stop for a minute and
[8:39] check up and say, "Am I even on the
[8:40] right road?
[8:42] Lord, am I am I where I'm supposed to
[8:43] be?" Because he's going to be waring at
[8:45] you. Brother Brandham says when you get
[8:47] filled with the Holy Ghost, it just puts
[8:48] a big target on you. It makes you the
[8:51] target of every gun in hell. Listen, I'm
[8:53] not scared to be the target because I've
[8:55] got a shield.
[8:56] Amen. Amen. There's armor that we can
[8:58] put on this morning. The whole armor of
[8:59] God. I'm not afraid to be a target
[9:01] because my general is the mighty
[9:03] conqueror. I'm not afraid this morning
[9:05] to go into battle. Hallelujah.
[9:09] Now, listen. I I didn't come here to
[9:10] bear bad news, [clears throat]
[9:12] but it's not going to get any easier.
[9:15] You know, I hate to be a little bit of a
[9:17] downer as as the kids might would say,
[9:19] but it's not. Things aren't getting
[9:20] better. Things in this world aren't
[9:22] fitting to improve. And it doesn't
[9:24] matter who we vote for.
[9:26] Things aren't going to be pre improved.
[9:28] There's a prophecy. We know the
[9:30] direction that things have to go.
[9:32] But I'm not worried about it this
[9:34] morning. I'm not worried about how evil
[9:35] things get because our God is a God of
[9:37] total war.
[9:39] Amen.
[9:40] Victory will be won by whatever means is
[9:43] necessary. That's his attitude this
[9:45] morning towards you. That's his attitude
[9:48] towards his bride. And he expects it to
[9:49] be your attitude as well.
[9:53] Because God God is allin. He He's not
[9:56] halfway. He didn't send somebody else to
[9:58] die for you. He came.
[10:00] In this day, it wasn't just, you know
[10:02] what, uh, send somebody. He came down.
[10:05] The mighty angel came down. Only Christ
[10:07] it could be.
[10:08] He He's been all in. And he expects his
[10:10] people to be all in. totally committed,
[10:12] totally surrendered, willing to do
[10:14] whatever it takes, willing to do
[10:16] whatever he commands even when we don't
[10:19] understand.
[10:21] That's the hard one because we like to
[10:22] understand things.
[10:24] But even when we don't understand, are
[10:26] we totally committed? Are we willing to
[10:28] say yes, Lord, even if it cuts us in the
[10:30] process?
[10:34] Even if the preacher steps on our toes,
[10:37] if what the preacher said came out of
[10:38] the word, then let it step on your toes.
[10:42] Even when it goes against our idea and
[10:44] our opinion
[10:46] listen, we live in a Burger King
[10:48] society.
[10:50] Your way right away at Burger King. Now,
[10:54] this isn't a Burger King gospel. He
[10:56] said, "I am the truth. I am the way."
[10:59] Not I. He said, "I." Sorry. He said,
[11:02] "I'm the truth. I'm the way." There's
[11:04] only one way. There's only one truth.
[11:06] And sometimes IT'S NOT EASY, BUT WE LOOK
[11:08] AT IT AND WE SAY, "LORD, I'M NOT THERE
[11:10] YET, BUT LORD, CONFORM me to your word.
[11:13] Lord, I don't want to change the word. I
[11:14] don't want to CHANGE THE TARGET, BUT I
[11:16] WANT MY LIFE TO MATCH THAT WORD, LORD.
[11:19] Even if it's hard, EVEN IF IT'S
[11:21] DIFFICULT, EVEN IF I DON'T UNDERSTAND,
[11:23] let me be conformed, Lord, to that word.
[11:28] Even if it's what we've held on to for
[11:29] years and years and years,
[11:31] even if it's what daddy and mommy
[11:33] believe so strongly." Now, that one's
[11:35] hard sometimes.
[11:38] That one's real hard because sometimes
[11:39] we believe
[11:42] that if we walk into a furtherance of
[11:44] light or something different from mom
[11:46] and dad that it condemns mom and dad.
[11:48] That's not true.
[11:50] You have to walk in the light that God
[11:51] opens before you.
[11:53] You're responsible for the way the Lord
[11:55] reveals the word in your life and you're
[11:57] responsible to walk in that.
[12:00] Hallelujah. Nothing today we can't allow
[12:01] anything to stand in our way of total
[12:03] victory. A halfway victory is not going
[12:05] to rapture this bride. Do you believe
[12:06] that this morning? What did he say there
[12:08] at the end of our opening verse? He
[12:10] said, "Thou shalt smite them and utterly
[12:12] destroy them. Thou shalt make no
[12:15] covenant with them, nor show mercy unto
[12:19] them."
[12:21] It's time we realize that we're not
[12:23] playing games.
[12:24] It's time that to realize that we're not
[12:26] playing church. Listen, how many of you
[12:28] is the devil taking it easy on you?
[12:32] No, he's not taking it easy on you. He's
[12:34] not taking it easy on your family. He's
[12:36] not taking it easy on on the bride
[12:38] around the world. He's not taking it
[12:39] easy on this church.
[12:41] It's time that we quit making covenants
[12:43] with the devil. Quit trying to sit back
[12:44] and out strategize him. Sit back and
[12:47] outthink him. Sit back and out debate
[12:49] him. And it's time that we buckle up for
[12:50] battle this morning.
[12:52] We've been taking it easy on him far too
[12:54] long. It says, "Smite him and utterly
[12:56] destroy him and quit making covenants
[12:59] with him and show him no mercy because
[13:03] this is total war." Amen. It's time to
[13:06] quit trying to learn how to live with
[13:08] devils.
[13:09] That's right.
[13:09] And start destroying devils.
[13:12] Amen. I believe we've been commissioned
[13:13] to do that in this hour. Amen. That's
[13:15] right. It's time to QUIT PUTTING THINGS
[13:17] OFF TO THE future or or saying that it's
[13:19] all past and face the facts today that
[13:22] this bride is called to manifest Jesus
[13:25] on the earth again. What he did in THE
[13:27] GROOM BODY IS WHAT THE BRIDE'S GOING TO
[13:29] DO. WHERE he went, DEVILS WERE CAST OUT.
[13:32] WHERE he went, SATAN'S KINGDOM WAS
[13:34] DESTROYED. HE SAID, "I'VE COME TO
[13:36] DESTROY THE WORKS of the devil." Then
[13:38] what has the bride been put here to do?
[13:40] THINK ABOUT IT NOW. LET'S QUIT PUTTING
[13:41] IT in the past. Let's quit thinking
[13:43] about it somewhere in the future. dwell
[13:44] in the millennium will HAVE THE I DON'T
[13:46] NEED HEALING in the millennium.
[13:52] Prophet of God said that. He said the
[13:54] original church at Pentecost with the
[13:56] power of God. Mark 16 in action is the
[14:00] true church that Jesus claims as his
[14:01] own.
[14:02] All else All Lord, but everything in the
[14:06] world can fit into there.
[14:08] All else is false.
[14:11] It has to be.
[14:14] The prophet would tell us that to place
[14:15] these things in days gone by or saying
[14:17] the apostolic age has ended, he would
[14:20] said that's seed of discrepancy.
[14:23] That is seed of discrepancy. It's it's
[14:25] time for us to fight for what God gave
[14:28] to us in this age.
[14:29] It's time for us to fight and quit
[14:31] going, "Well, I I don't know about
[14:32] achieving that. I don't know about
[14:33] Listen, he didn't put it in the message
[14:36] to take up space.
[14:37] He put it there because it was YOURS TO
[14:39] POSSESS. OF COURSE, THE DEVIL would love
[14:41] to rob you of the power that's been
[14:42] restored to you IN THIS DAY. OF COURSE,
[14:44] HE'LL convince you that it's okay. Just
[14:46] be cold and formal. We don't need those
[14:48] things. WHY DOES HE TRY TO CONVINCE YOU
[14:50] OF THAT? BECAUSE THAT'S THE VERY WEAPON
[14:52] THAT YOU turn on him.
[14:54] If you're afraid to put the word of God
[14:56] in your lips and GO ON THE ATTACK, THEN
[14:58] THE DEVIL HAS YOU DEFEATED. BUT HE KNOWS
[15:01] WHAT BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID. THE DEVIL
[15:03] KNOWS THAT IF YOU EVER GET THE TRUE
[15:05] REVELATION OF WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT
[15:07] YOU'RE CALLED TO BE AND THAT YOU CAN do
[15:10] the greater works, THE DEVIL KNOWS. SO
[15:13] HE TRIES TO KEEP YOU FROM KNOWING
[15:15] BECAUSE IN YOUR REVELATION OF WHO YOU
[15:17] ARE, THAT'S WHERE YOU BECOME the
[15:19] invincible army.
[15:21] Hallelujah.
[15:24] It's time to fight for what God has
[15:26] given us. Amen.
[15:27] Time to quit living below our privileges
[15:29] as the prophet of God would tell us and
[15:31] to operate in the full power that has
[15:32] been open to us in this day.
[15:35] Hallelujah. Quit trying to to
[15:40] you got to be careful how you say things
[15:41] because I believe in in teaching
[15:43] teaching right there in the Bible.
[15:45] They're supposed to be teachers. All
[15:46] right. But but but but there's a
[15:48] difference between teaching anointed by
[15:50] the Holy Ghost and a lecture that you
[15:52] would get at the university.
[15:54] True.
[15:55] So, it's time that we quit trying to
[15:56] teach people about the about how to
[15:58] overcome a devil and just get them to
[16:00] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And
[16:02] they'll learn in an instant there'll be
[16:03] something a river of life, a well
[16:05] upspring in their soul. You won't have
[16:07] to teach them how to overcome. There'll
[16:08] be a power. They can say, "Greater is he
[16:10] that's in me than he that's in the
[16:12] world." I believe in good teaching. But
[16:14] we need to get people to the baptism OF
[16:16] THE HOLY GHOST. Then they'll overcome
[16:18] their problems.
[16:20] Then they'll overcome in this world.
[16:22] Amen. Yes.
[16:25] Quit trying to make peace through coping
[16:28] and cut his head. Listen, Saul and his
[16:30] army coped with Goliath.
[16:32] Right.
[16:36] They learned how to cope with it.
[16:39] But David didn't cope with it.
[16:41] That's right.
[16:42] David dealt with it.
[16:44] David went on the attack and cut his
[16:46] head off. I say it's time this morning
[16:48] that we give the devil no peace. It's
[16:50] time to come out the tents. He's been
[16:52] walking in your valley long enough this
[16:53] morning. He's been walking on your joy
[16:55] long enough. He's been walking on your
[16:57] peace long enough, threatening you and
[16:59] call out. He's been walking ALL THROUGH
[17:01] YOUR LIFE BRINGING ANXIETY and
[17:02] depression and fears. And he's down
[17:04] there and he's intimidated some of you.
[17:06] Some of you don't want to come out of
[17:07] the tent, BUT THIS MORNING MAY YOU HEAR
[17:09] THE WORD OF THE LORD WITH A NEW SET of
[17:10] ears. Brother Brandham said there was a
[17:12] new set of ears in the camp that day
[17:14] that heard the boast. AND HE SAID, "WHO
[17:16] IS THIS UNCIRCUMCISED PHILISTINE?" I say
[17:19] the same thing. The one that's tried to
[17:20] bring those THINGS IN YOUR LIFE. WHO IS
[17:22] THAT UNCIRCUMCISED PHILISTINE? COME OUT
[17:24] OF THE TENT THIS MORNING. GO INTO THE
[17:26] VALLEY THIS MORNING. GO INTO THE VALLEY
[17:28] AND SAY, "ON THIS DAY, ALL WILL KNOW
[17:30] THAT THERE'S A GOD IN ISRAEL BECAUSE
[17:32] I've come to take your head off."
[17:34] Hallelujah.
[17:36] Praise God.
[17:37] Brother Brandham says, "What we need is
[17:39] old-fashioned, God-Scent, heaven-born
[17:41] preachers who will tell the truth
[17:43] regardless who it hurts." Amen.
[17:45] Like John who said, "The axe is laid to
[17:47] the root of the tree, and every tree
[17:49] that not bringeth forth good fruits is
[17:50] heuned down and cast into the fire." We
[17:53] need preachers, prophets like that who
[17:55] will bombard and use the judgments of
[17:57] God for ammunition to tear up this
[17:59] wicked condition that we're living in.
[18:01] Amen.
[18:01] Now, here's what I was trying to get to.
[18:03] You can never rid sin by patting it on
[18:05] the back.
[18:06] That's right.
[18:08] You can never rid sin by educating
[18:10] people.
[18:11] Our programs has become demolished and
[18:13] have failed. There's only one remedy for
[18:16] sin and that is Christ is that remedy
[18:19] and not Christ through intellectual
[18:21] confession.
[18:22] Amen.
[18:23] Listen now. But through the baptism of
[18:25] the Holy Ghost to a new life and a
[18:27] regeneration. That's the only remedy for
[18:30] sin. Only remedy for our nation. It's
[18:33] the only remedy for our church. It's the
[18:36] only remedy for the people.
[18:39] Amen.
[18:39] Amen. Amen. Total war.
[18:44] He said there in verse two, to utterly
[18:48] destroy.
[18:50] We say that word destroy a lot as we
[18:52] look at the conquest of the promised
[18:53] land.
[18:55] Destroy means to put an end to the
[18:57] existence of something by damaging or
[19:01] attacking it.
[19:04] synonyms. To consume, to crush, to
[19:08] dismantle, to end, to eradicate, to gut,
[19:13] to kill, to shatter, to smash, to wipe
[19:16] out.
[19:18] These are the things you are to be doing
[19:20] to your enemy.
[19:22] Amen.
[19:24] Brother says, "But when he come and
[19:26] fought against them and taken from the
[19:28] people, then God told him told Israel
[19:31] or vowed or Israel vowed to God if he
[19:33] would deliver the king into his hands
[19:35] that he'd utterly destroy the land." And
[19:38] that's a type today. If God will give
[19:41] you the spirit, the Holy Spirit, utterly
[19:44] destroy sin out of your life, move on.
[19:48] Nothing can stop the church. They may
[19:50] call you fanatic.
[19:52] I've been called that.
[19:54] I'm I'm a little I'm a little bit
[19:56] emotional. I don't apologize for that. I
[19:58] know who I was and where I was going and
[19:59] what God did for me.
[20:01] So I So I have no shame in my rejoicing.
[20:03] I I have no shame in my emotion. He
[20:06] said, "They may call you fanatic. They
[20:08] may call you simply to pack a Bible.
[20:10] They may say that you're a holy roller
[20:12] or whatever they do. Nothing's going to
[20:14] stand in God's church. She's moving
[20:16] towards Canaan. If you don't go, God's
[20:19] going to take them that will go. That's
[20:22] right. That church, there's nothing.
[20:24] It's an irresistible force. That's
[20:26] right. And God will move everything.
[20:30] Will.
[20:32] How many have witnessed that in your own
[20:33] life when it seems like there's no way
[20:35] he'll make a way. He is the way maker
[20:37] this morning. Amen.
[20:39] Now, I understand that sometimes we get
[20:41] blindsided by attacks of the enemy.
[20:44] I've been blindsided before, things I
[20:46] didn't see coming.
[20:48] Sometimes we get caught off guard maybe
[20:49] with bad news or a doctor's report or a
[20:52] surprise attack as we might would say.
[20:54] And
[20:56] and and yes, in those moments we have to
[20:58] go on the defense. We we have to put up
[21:00] the you know, we have to defend
[21:01] ourselves. But but for far too long, I
[21:04] believe we fought a defensive war
[21:07] and tried to just defend against the
[21:09] attacks of the enemy. And it's true, as
[21:12] I said, we must withstand the ws of the
[21:14] enemy. I get that. But Joshua wasn't
[21:17] sitting over in his camp and he didn't
[21:20] set up this strong perimeter and set up
[21:22] guards and say, "We're just going to
[21:24] defend our position."
[21:28] That's not how he took the land.
[21:30] That's not how he came in and conquered.
[21:32] He didn't sit on this side of the Jordan
[21:34] and go, "Woo, we got it defended. They
[21:37] are never going to get into our camp.
[21:39] They are." No, no, no. He was
[21:40] commissioned to go take the land. There
[21:43] was something he had to go and do. There
[21:45] is a there is a moving forward. There
[21:47] there is a progression in order to
[21:49] possess.
[21:50] Joshua was on the attack. Listen church,
[21:53] we should be launching attacks. Today,
[21:56] we should be launching attacks. Today,
[21:57] I'm going AFTER MY CHILDREN. TODAY, I'M
[22:00] GOING AFTER MY HEALTH. TODAY, I'M GOING
[22:02] AFTER MY JOY. TODAY, I'M GOING AFTER MY
[22:04] HOME. THERE WILL BE A RESTORATION IN MY
[22:06] FAMILY. TODAY, I'M GOING TO GET IT
[22:08] BECAUSE IT'S MY PROMISE. YOU CAN'T JUST
[22:10] SIT BACK AND SAY, "LORD, BRING IT HERE.
[22:12] BRING IT HERE. HE SAID, "I'VE DELIVERED
[22:14] IT TO YOU. NOW GO AND TAKE IT. I'VE
[22:16] PROMISED IT TO YOU. NOW, NO. GO GET WHAT
[22:19] BELONGS TO YOU."
[22:20] You go down TO THE ENEMY'S CAMP. You
[22:23] stand on the promises of God. You claim
[22:25] your healing. You fight for your
[22:27] marriage. You fight for YOUR CHILDREN
[22:29] TODAY. IT'S YOURS, BUT YOU GOT A JOB TO
[22:31] DO. Go and possess.
[22:35] You say, "Well, the devil don't give me
[22:36] no rest." When's the last time he said
[22:39] that about you?
[22:45] When's the last time the devil said, "Oh
[22:47] no, they got up again.
[22:50] Oh no, here they come. Here they come."
[22:55] When's the last time that was his
[22:57] testimony?
[23:00] Think about it now. That That's why I
[23:02] like offensive services.
[23:05] You can take that how you want.
[23:07] [clears throat]
[23:09] services where we go on the offense.
[23:18] Yeah.
[23:20] Where we go on the attack.
[23:23] [laughter]
[23:23] See, a defensive service will teach you
[23:26] how to cope with things,
[23:27] how to live with things, how to tolerate
[23:30] things. But I want to go on the offense
[23:32] today. I want to go on the attack today
[23:35] and say, "I'm coming for everything that
[23:37] he stole from me. I'm taking the word.
[23:39] I'm You pick up whatever you can find.
[23:41] Samson picked up a jawbone.
[23:43] You pick up whatever verse you need. I
[23:45] am the Lord God that health thee. They
[23:47] shall be there and their offspring with
[23:49] them. I'm taking that right there and
[23:50] I'm about to go beat some devils today.
[23:52] Well, you don't understand how
[23:53] surrounded I am. Let me tell you
[23:55] something. He didn't send enough. He
[23:56] sent 600 at Shamgard. IT WASN'T ENOUGH.
[23:59] HE GOT DONE KILLING 600. HE SAID, "IS
[24:01] THAT ALL YOU SENT? I'M TELLING YOU, HE
[24:03] HASN'T SENT ENOUGH TO STOP YOU IN THIS
[24:05] DAY. YOU'VE BEEN GIVEN MORE THAN A
[24:07] JAWBONE. YOU'VE BEEN GIVEN AN ATOMIC
[24:09] WEAPON. YOU'VE BEEN GIVEN THE GREATEST
[24:10] MESSAGE TO STRIKE THE FACE OF THE EARTH.
[24:12] PICK [screaming] IT UP THIS MORNING AND
[24:14] GO TO WAR AND RECLAIM EVERYTHING THAT
[24:17] THE DEVIL HAS STOLE from you.
[24:20] Amen.
[24:23] What David say? This day
[24:27] will the Lord deliver thee into mine
[24:29] hand and I will smite thee.
[24:32] Yes, it was the Lord. Brother Brown
[24:35] talked about him taking that rock when
[24:37] it came out of the slingshot and making
[24:38] it speed up so fast. Yes, the Lord was
[24:41] in it. But the Lord would have blessed
[24:43] any of those that went down to the
[24:44] valley.
[24:46] They were all seed of Abraham.
[24:48] Amen.
[24:49] But they stayed in the tent.
[24:51] Somebody's got to go down into the
[24:53] valley this morning.
[24:54] Somebody's got to go down and take what
[24:56] belongs to those.
[24:58] Saul, who is a son of Kish, said, "Let's
[25:01] stay in the tent. Those days are over.
[25:04] We don't do those things anymore. As we
[25:06] mature, Goliath will leave the valley.
[25:11] [clears throat]
[25:12] But David said, "How about we go down to
[25:14] the valley and drive Goliath out?"
[25:17] How about we take the promises that's
[25:18] been given us and go into battle?
[25:21] Listen, you want victory? You want
[25:23] victory in your home? You want victory
[25:24] for your children? Quit sitting back and
[25:26] just fighting off the attacks. But this
[25:28] morning, it's time to go to battle. It's
[25:29] time to arm yourselves in the full.
[25:31] There's a reason you have armor. There's
[25:33] a reason you have weapons. It's not to
[25:35] run away. It's to charge into the valley
[25:37] this morning. Charge in there FOR YOUR
[25:39] PROMISES. IT'S TIME FOR OUR CHILDREN to
[25:42] come home. IT'S TIME FOR DELIVERANCES.
[25:44] IT'S TIME FOR HEALINGS IN THE HOUSE OF
[25:46] GOD. IT'S TIME for Holy Ghost
[25:48] outpourings. Oh, come on. He still does
[25:50] it.
[25:51] Every generation has their opportunity
[25:53] at revival. HE STILL POURS OUT HIS
[25:55] SPIRIT. AMEN.
[25:59] Brother Brandham says, "What the church
[26:00] had at Pentecost is her inalienable
[26:03] right."
[26:05] Originally, she had the pure word of
[26:07] God. Amen. It's been restored.
[26:10] She had the power of the spirit
[26:11] manifested in diverse signs and wonders
[26:14] and gifts of the Holy Ghost.
[26:17] In another place he says that the
[26:18] dynamics of this church will be a
[26:23] refilling of the Holy Ghost. He says
[26:26] just as the capstone comes down that
[26:27] which weated small measure.
[26:31] He said well now become fully as there
[26:33] is a refilling. Lord I say I'm ready for
[26:36] it.
[26:36] Lord I say pour it out on me. Lord
[26:38] however you choose to move. Just don't
[26:40] let me be a spiritual fire extinguisher.
[26:42] We got too many people. Somebody starts
[26:44] to get a little excited. Somebody starts
[26:45] to break through and they run over
[26:46] there.
[26:49] That's good.
[26:49] Woo! They almost shouted.
[26:52] [laughter]
[26:53] Lord,
[26:59] listen. Don't be afraid of a little bit
[27:01] of wildfire. We got enough wet blankets
[27:03] around, we'll get it put out. [laughter]
[27:08] Don't be afraid.
[27:09] Amen.
[27:09] Don't be afraid to rejoice in his
[27:11] presence. [snorts]
[27:12] Don't be afraid when the King of Kings
[27:13] and the Lord of Lords comes moving down
[27:15] through here and you feel that sweet
[27:16] spirit enter in. It's okay to cry out to
[27:19] God.
[27:20] It's okay to rejoice in his presence.
[27:22] It's okay to shout your victories. IT'S
[27:24] OKAY. HE'S DONE A LOT FOR YOU.
[27:26] HE'S DONE A LOT FOR US IN THIS DAY.
[27:30] It's time to take back what belongs for
[27:32] to us. It's time to take back our homes.
[27:34] And and don't ever give up. It's not too
[27:36] late. Don't ever give up personally for
[27:38] you. Well, I'm too old.
[27:40] I've I've probably
[27:44] That's a helpless situation.
[27:47] My kids, they've been out in the world
[27:48] so long. Listen, let me tell you. I got
[27:50] two testimonies. Is it okay if we
[27:51] testify this morning?
[27:56] I grew up in a home
[28:01] where my parents didn't get along. Let's
[28:02] just say it like that. I can't remember
[28:04] a time they were in the same bedroom.
[28:06] So, I grew up in a home where they slept
[28:08] in separate rooms.
[28:10] 1999 I believe my dad divorces my mom.
[28:15] Let me show you how God will come in and
[28:17] harness trials and tribulations and
[28:20] he'll put a bit in its mouth is how the
[28:22] prophet of God described it. He'll
[28:23] harness it and he'll bring it around for
[28:24] the glory of God.
[28:26] My dad just went to be with the Lord
[28:28] March 31st.
[28:31] He had cancer. In the last year of his
[28:34] life, God did so many things that so far
[28:38] out seat uh far exceeded a physical
[28:40] healing that they left no doubt who the
[28:43] victor was.
[28:44] It's never too late. I get a picture
[28:46] from my my dad always struggled and
[28:50] always struggled and always struggled
[28:51] with the fact that he had divorced my
[28:53] mom. He had come back to the Lord. He
[28:56] was in church. He was serving the Lord.
[28:57] Odd thing for a guy to grow up in church
[28:59] the last 20 years with with my mom
[29:02] sitting over here and my dad sitting
[29:03] over here.
[29:06] [clears throat]
[29:09] And he'd always come to me and say, "How
[29:11] do I make this right? Can I even can I
[29:12] even go in a rapture with this hanging
[29:14] over me?" And it just really bothered
[29:16] him.
[29:17] And I'd always tell him, "Dad, you've
[29:20] made it right as best you can in your
[29:22] heart, but you can't fix it if she don't
[29:25] want to fix it.
[29:27] you can only do so much to fix it.
[29:31] One day, my father-in-law, my pastor,
[29:33] Brother Tim, sends me a picture.
[29:36] And when my dad got cancer and was in
[29:37] and out of the hospital, my mom was
[29:39] actually always there taking him to his
[29:40] appointments and just how she operated.
[29:43] She was there helping him, you know,
[29:44] even though they were divorced and
[29:46] whatnot. And I get a picture, let me get
[29:48] to the point. And I get a picture from
[29:49] Brother Tim and it's and it's my mom
[29:51] sitting on the side of my dad's hospital
[29:53] bed. Not unusual. There was some
[29:55] cordialness there, but it was unusual to
[29:58] see her holding his hand.
[30:02] And brother Tim says, "Do you know what
[30:04] this is?" I said, "No, sir." He said,
[30:06] "This is your parents' wedding picture
[30:10] as they've just been remarried and
[30:12] renewed their vows right here in this
[30:14] hospital room."
[30:15] God brought a reconciliation that I had.
[30:17] So far, Listen, I want to be honest with
[30:19] you. To my shame, I had given up even
[30:21] praying for it. I'm not saying that's
[30:23] right. I said to my shame, it was not
[30:25] some IT WAS SOMETHING THAT I thought was
[30:27] too far gone. It was something that I
[30:29] thought that WAS OUT OF REACH. BUT WITH
[30:31] OUR GOD, THERE'S NOTHING too far gone.
[30:33] There is nothing out of reach. THIS IS A
[30:35] MESSAGE OF RESTORATION. THERE IS A
[30:37] HEALING POWER IN THIS MESSAGE. DON'T
[30:39] GIVE UP ON YOUR CHILDREN. DON'T GIVE UP
[30:41] ON YOUR LOVED ONES. DON'T GIVE UP ON THE
[30:43] RESTORATION OF YOUR HOME IN THIS DAY. He
[30:46] is a restoring God.
[30:48] Amen. We have a we have a a brother that
[30:50] just has left the church 26 years ago.
[30:54] Had no intention of coming back to God.
[30:56] Had no desire to come back to God. No
[30:59] desire. And he walks into his office one
[31:02] day. He's a fire captain. He got away
[31:03] from his men. He walked in and he sat
[31:05] down and he said the voice of God spoke
[31:07] to him and said, "It's time to come
[31:10] home, son."
[31:12] Suddenly in a moment, just like that,
[31:15] just like that, your situation can
[31:16] change. Amen.
[31:17] He came back to the Lord. He came back
[31:19] to the altar. He gave his heart to the
[31:20] Lord. HE'S ON FIRE FOR GOD. WHY? IT WAS
[31:23] GOD'S TIME. NOTHING'S OUT OF REACH.
[31:25] NOTHING'S TOO FAR GONE. DON'T GIVE UP.
[31:27] IT'S TIME TO GO POSSESS. IT'S TIME TO
[31:29] KEEP PRAYING. KEEP FIGHTING. LORD, I
[31:31] KNOW YOU CAN. I KNOW YOU CAN. I KNOW YOU
[31:34] WILL. AND WHEN YOU DELIVER THEM INTO MY
[31:37] HANDS. NOT IF, BUT WHEN. TODAY.
[31:40] HALLELUJAH. HE'S STILL A MIRACLE WORKING
[31:42] GOD. THE HOLY SPIRIT STILL MOVES. HE'S
[31:44] STILL CALLING. HE'S STILL DRAWING. AND
[31:46] HE'S looking for people willing to fight
[31:48] and go possess and take.
[31:50] Amen.
[31:51] It's time for total war.
[31:54] Deuteronomy 12:1
[32:01] says, "These are the statutes and
[32:02] judgments which you shall observe to do
[32:05] in the land which the Lord God of his
[32:08] fathers giveth thee to possess all the
[32:11] days that you live upon the earth. Ye
[32:14] shall utterly destroy all the places
[32:16] wherein the nations which you shall
[32:18] possess serve their gods
[32:20] upon the high mountains and upon the
[32:22] hills and under every green tree. And ye
[32:26] shall overthrow their altars and break
[32:29] their pillars and burn their groves with
[32:31] fire. And ye shall hew down the graven
[32:34] images of their gods and destroy the
[32:37] names of them out of that place. Woo!
[32:40] That's total war.
[32:43] that's destroying everything.
[32:46] Now, I know most of you don't know me at
[32:48] all, but [clears throat] I've actually
[32:50] only been full-time ministry for a year
[32:52] now. Uh, last May, I I walked away from
[32:55] my job as a school teacher, been a
[32:57] public school teacher for 15 years, and
[33:00] I taught history. Me and my dad loved
[33:02] history. We traveled all over the
[33:03] country to Civil War battlefields. My
[33:05] dad was a history teacher. I became a
[33:07] history teacher.
[33:09] So, there at some point in most
[33:11] services, I end up going into some
[33:12] history. So, here we go. [clears throat]
[33:18] [snorts]
[33:19] The American Civil War. [clears throat]
[33:22] It's actually a very that goes much
[33:24] deeper than the surface level that's
[33:26] taught in most of our schools and
[33:28] textbooks. [snorts]
[33:30] There were wonderful and godly men on
[33:32] both sides of that war.
[33:35] And there were horrible, dreadful men on
[33:37] both sides of that war.
[33:39] But two central characters today just to
[33:41] compare and contrast for just a moment.
[33:44] General Roberty Lee in the south and
[33:47] general William Tecumpsy Sherman was a
[33:50] Union general. And Roberty Lee is widely
[33:53] considered maybe the greatest tactician
[33:56] or strategist in the war by many. And
[33:58] many of his battle plans are actually
[34:00] still studied today. They were bold.
[34:01] They were swift. They were daring.
[34:04] And yet he was a gentleman even to his
[34:07] enemies.
[34:10] [clears throat] When they invaded the
[34:11] north and went up into Pennsylvania, the
[34:14] army had strict instructions. Do not
[34:16] interfere interfere in any way with the
[34:18] lives of civilians.
[34:19] Do not damage the property of the
[34:21] civilians. These people are not our
[34:24] enemies. We are not at war with these
[34:27] people. We want them to see we mean them
[34:30] no harm.
[34:32] Now, there's been many stories and and
[34:33] like many down through history,
[34:35] especially oral histories, sometimes
[34:36] they get embellished.
[34:38] But there were stories that where where
[34:40] men in Roberty Lee's army were actually
[34:42] court marshaled
[34:44] for taking wood off of fences in
[34:46] Pennsylvania to build campfires just to
[34:49] keep warm. Not burning houses down, but
[34:52] just taking wood off of those split rail
[34:53] fences. And he would have them court
[34:55] marshaled because he wanted them, "Do
[34:57] not interfere with the civilians. were
[34:59] at war with this with this other
[35:01] government, not the people. And then
[35:03] there was Sherman [clears throat]
[35:06] who developed what was known as a
[35:07] scorched earth policy.
[35:10] Other men had tried to outmaneuver the
[35:12] southern armies
[35:14] and they'd been defeated. Other men had
[35:17] taken the gentleman's approach. They had
[35:19] fought a pretty war, a poetic war, a war
[35:21] of pageantry,
[35:25] a war where people didn't have to weep
[35:26] their way to Calvary anymore.
[35:29] Oh, it's okay. Maybe a war where they
[35:32] didn't pray for the sick anymore and
[35:35] where sin wasn't called out anymore.
[35:37] Just pageantry and forms of church
[35:39] services, a battle plan that didn't
[35:41] offend people. Other people had tried
[35:42] that and couldn't win. They had tried to
[35:46] fight Roberty Lee the same way he
[35:47] fought, but they couldn't beat him on
[35:49] his terms. It was actually called the
[35:51] policy of consiliation which is known as
[35:54] a limited war where you are to respect
[35:56] the private property even of those who
[35:59] are actively working against you. It's
[36:02] the idea that most of the people on the
[36:05] enemy's side really aren't our enemies.
[36:10] Now let's bring this down for just a
[36:12] minute. Things that we don't want to
[36:14] identify as our enemy. Well, that's just
[36:15] a family trait.
[36:18] Everybody in my family has a bad temper.
[36:20] It's just it's just who we are.
[36:24] It's not really a problem.
[36:27] It's just a family trait. Dad was this
[36:30] way. Uncle Bobby was I hope there's not
[36:32] an Uncle Bobby here. I'm sorry.
[36:34] [clears throat] So and so was this way.
[36:37] You know, I'm just a little I'm just I'm
[36:39] geared a little bit towards the
[36:40] negative.
[36:42] You I've got a right to be bitter. They
[36:44] did me wrong.
[36:47] it's not really a big deal. I I'll
[36:49] eventually grow out of this. I'll mature
[36:51] out of this. And Sherman realized that
[36:53] in all that, the war wasn't getting won.
[36:58] So in 1863,
[37:00] he began to apply what he called the
[37:02] hard hand of war in central Mississippi
[37:06] in the Meridian campaign. And for the
[37:08] first time, Sherman would actually order
[37:10] his troops to to wage a war of
[37:14] destruction. In other words, tear stuff
[37:18] up. [clears throat]
[37:21] Church, it's time we tear some stuff up.
[37:28] He says that his what he wanted to do
[37:32] was to remove all hope from the enemy
[37:36] that they could ever win the war.
[37:39] I like that. I think it's time that we
[37:41] remove hope from the enemy this morning.
[37:42] Amen.
[37:43] It don't matter how many times I've
[37:44] struggled. It don't matter what you
[37:46] throw at me. It don't matter what you
[37:48] come at me with, Satan. You have no hope
[37:50] of winning this war. I'm not going to
[37:52] quit. I'm not going to back up. I'm not
[37:54] going to fall. How can you say that?
[37:55] She's predestinated not to fall. And you
[37:58] have no hope of winning this war. I will
[38:01] fight you however I have to, wherever I
[38:03] have to. I like what Church Hill said.
[38:05] We'll fight you in the air. We'll fight
[38:07] you on the land. We'll fight you on the
[38:08] sea. I'll fight you at church. I'll
[38:10] fight you on Monday. I'll fight you on
[38:12] Tuesday. I'll fight you in my home. I'LL
[38:14] FIGHT YOU AT MY JOB. YOU have no hope of
[38:18] winning this war. It's the attitude WE
[38:20] HAVE TO TAKE. QUIT GIVING HIM A
[38:22] FOOTHOLD. I will die to myself. I will
[38:24] die to my thinking. Whatever I have to
[38:26] do, I will have victory.
[38:29] But you have no hope.
[38:30] Amen.
[38:32] Sherman's goal was to make Georgia howl.
[38:35] He said, "We are not only fighting
[38:37] hostile armies, but a hostile people.
[38:40] And we must make the old and the young.
[38:43] And listen, I preached this in the
[38:45] south. [clears throat]
[38:51] I got to be careful where you take these
[38:54] this thought. [clears throat]
[38:58] Sherman is not a popular name in the
[39:00] southern states. I just want you to know
[39:01] that
[39:03] we must make the old and the young, the
[39:05] rich and the poor feel the hard hand of
[39:07] war. We cannot change the hearts and
[39:10] minds of those people of the south, but
[39:12] we can make war so terrible
[39:15] and make them so sick of war that
[39:17] generations will pass before they would
[39:20] again appeal to it. Shar contended that
[39:23] the United States and its
[39:24] representatives had the right to remove
[39:27] and destroy every obstacle if need be.
[39:30] Think about it now. Think about what we
[39:31] need to do to get to this rapture. Every
[39:34] obstacle if need be. take every life,
[39:37] every acre of land, every particle of
[39:39] property, everything that to us seems
[39:41] proper, that all who do not aid are
[39:45] enemies.
[39:47] And we will not account to them
[39:50] for our acts.
[39:53] I think we need to quit worrying about
[39:54] what other people think about how we
[39:55] conduct our church services.
[39:57] I ain't worried about what other people
[39:59] think about how I conduct my war. I
[40:01] ain't worried about what other people
[40:02] think about how I go about getting my
[40:04] victory. Nothing will stand in my way.
[40:07] THIS RAPTURE OR BUST, IT'S BODY CHANGE
[40:09] OR BUST. I'M GOING ALL THE WAY, LORD.
[40:11] I'LL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES. IT DOESN'T
[40:13] MATTER TO ME IF PEOPLE THINK I get a
[40:15] LITTLE BIT OUT OF ORDER. I'M NOT TOO
[40:17] WORRIED ABOUT THAT. I'M GOING IN A
[40:19] RAPTURE AND I'LL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES.
[40:21] I'LL WORSHIP YOU, LORD. I'LL DIE OUT TO
[40:23] SELF, LORD. I WILL DO WHATEVER you
[40:27] desire
[40:29] in order to make sure I get there. He
[40:31] says, "WE WILL NOT ACCOUNT TO THEM FOR
[40:33] our acts." It doesn't matter if what you
[40:36] do gets a little bit out of what other
[40:38] people call order. We've church ordered
[40:40] the spirit right out of most of our
[40:42] services.
[40:48] Brother Brown said, "God, help us to get
[40:50] out of order once in a while." I'm just
[40:51] quoting the prophet.
[40:54] The trouble of it is you got too much
[40:56] order.
[41:00] You know what's funny?
[41:03] I'm just going to throw this out there
[41:04] for free. This is one of those ones you
[41:05] want to you can go.
[41:08] I give you full permission.
[41:13] Brother Brown
[41:15] almost exclusively
[41:18] I know he spoke to mixed audience of
[41:20] many denominations but almost
[41:21] exclusively was speaking to Pentecostal
[41:23] people assemblies of God and things like
[41:26] that people that classified as
[41:27] Pentecostal people that we many times
[41:30] would go they're too emotional
[41:32] too much running jumping shouting and
[41:34] brother Brown says you got too much
[41:36] order
[41:41] I heard a bunch of them hit the Boy, I
[41:43] heard it. It's okay.
[41:48] He says, "You got too much order. Get
[41:50] out of order."
[41:52] I hope the church gets out of order long
[41:55] enough to get saved. He said,
[42:01] "It's time for total war."
[42:04] Lord, whatever it takes,
[42:06] whatever. Listen, I don't I don't know.
[42:09] I you're you're you're a very well
[42:11] taught group, so I don't even feel like
[42:12] I have to do this, but I'm going to go
[42:13] this way. I'm not advocating that every
[42:15] service you get up and run around this
[42:16] building and jump and hoot and holler.
[42:18] I'm advocating that you be willing to
[42:19] worship however God moves on your heart
[42:21] to worship and not worry about what
[42:23] other people think about it when he
[42:24] moves on your heart to do so. That's all
[42:26] I'm advocating for. That is freedom of
[42:28] worship. Listen, if you look at the
[42:29] Pentecostal uh denominational side of
[42:32] things, not not to not God bless those
[42:33] people, but it's actually not a true
[42:35] freedom of worship when you have to
[42:37] speak in tongues or you have to run.
[42:39] That's actually bondage. That's not
[42:41] freedom. But freedom is when God moves,
[42:43] I CAN MOVE WITH HIM. IF GOD BELLOWS UP
[42:46] IN MY HEART AND I CAN'T HELP BUT SHOUT
[42:47] AND I'M GOING TO DO IT ANYWAY, THAT
[42:49] MEANS THERE'S FREEDOM IN THE HOUSE OF
[42:50] GOD. WE'RE CALLED TO BE FREE. HOW DARE
[42:52] US TAKE AND PUT OUR WORSHIP BACK IN A
[42:54] DENOMINATIONAL BOX TO MAKE CERTAIN
[42:57] PEOPLE FEEL COMFORTABLE? I'VE BEEN
[42:58] CALLED. I AM FREE. I AM CHOSEN. I'VE GOT
[43:01] SOMETHING TO SHOUT ABOUT. I'VE GOT
[43:03] SOMETHING TO REJOICE ABOUT. AND YOU KNOW
[43:05] WHAT? THERE ARE TIMES I'VE GOT THINGS TO
[43:06] DANCE ABOUT. AND I DO BECAUSE I'M
[43:09] [screaming] FREE.
[43:10] HALLELUJAH. THERE'S a freedom
[43:13] in this salvation. THERE'S A FREEDOM in
[43:15] this word.
[43:19] If it stands in the way of victory, burn
[43:22] it down.
[43:24] Amen.
[43:26] If it hinders the move of God, burn it
[43:27] down. Any idea, any ism, any doctrine,
[43:30] any division, anything that would stand
[43:32] between you and your full inherit
[43:34] inheritance, destroy it.
[43:37] Deuteronomy 26:16,
[43:39] but of the cities of these people which
[43:42] the Lord thy God doth give thee for an
[43:45] inheritance, thou shalt save alive
[43:47] nothing that breatheth, anything that
[43:50] has stood on your inheritance. He says,
[43:53] "Anything that has stood on the cities
[43:55] that belong to you, leave alive nothing.
[43:58] Anything that has tried to stop you or
[44:00] hindered you or made you think you
[44:01] couldn't make it, destroy it this
[44:03] morning."
[44:06] Verse 17, "But thou shalt utterly
[44:08] destroy them, namely the Hittites, and
[44:10] the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and
[44:12] the Parizzites, and the Hivites, and the
[44:13] Jebusites, as the Lord thy God hath
[44:15] commanded thee." Now listen to your
[44:17] prophet. LISTEN. DESTROY YOUR enemy
[44:20] before your enemy destroys you.
[44:25] Let me see what time it is. All right,
[44:28] we get into the meat of this for a
[44:29] minute. I'm not going to keep you too
[44:31] terribly long.
[44:34] He says, "Destroy your enemy before it
[44:35] destroys you."
[44:37] He'll do it. Bring back the oldfashioned
[44:40] meetings and the thing and oh, leave
[44:41] Delilah alone. Leave the world alone.
[44:44] That thing that woos you off into little
[44:46] things that you shouldn't. And the
[44:47] little thing, the little things,
[44:49] troubles come up in the church and you
[44:51] won't stand correction because you don't
[44:53] have to. You can drop off to another
[44:56] church
[44:58] and things like that. In the early days
[45:01] when a man when a man didn't cope up
[45:03] with the word of God, they packed him
[45:04] out dead.
[45:07] [clears throat]
[45:08] He says, "BRING US BACK to Pentecost.
[45:11] NOT HOLLYWOOD SHOWMANSHIP, BUT A
[45:14] WHOLEHEARTED TURN TO GOD IS WHAT WE
[45:16] NEED. Once more, oh Lord, once more.
[45:20] He says in another place, let me say
[45:22] this, my friend. You better destroy your
[45:23] enemy before your enemy [clears throat]
[45:25] destroys you.
[45:28] Now, think about, we're talking about
[45:29] total war.
[45:32] People don't have a problem with this
[45:33] statement, destroy your enemy before it
[45:35] destroys you. Just about everybody's
[45:36] like, "Yeah, hey man, that's right. You
[45:38] better destroy your enemy before it
[45:40] destroys you. But what they have a
[45:42] problem with is recognizing what is the
[45:44] enemy.
[45:48] They toy with things, toy with unbelief,
[45:52] toy with complexes,
[45:54] toy with self-righteousness,
[45:57] toy with unforgiveness,
[45:59] not recognizing that those are the
[46:01] things that want to destroy you.
[46:06] Amen. See, that's the thing about total
[46:08] war is it recognizes the uncomfortable
[46:11] enemies.
[46:13] Think about what Sherman did.
[46:17] He
[46:18] He didn't like
[46:21] it wasn't easy. He burned down the homes
[46:23] of families thousands of miles away from
[46:25] the war,
[46:27] but he knew that family was raising beef
[46:30] that would feed the enemy.
[46:34] He didn't like tearing down everybody's
[46:36] property. He didn't like just
[46:37] destroying, but it was necessary. He was
[46:41] willing to do what others weren't
[46:42] willing to do in order to win. Total war
[46:46] recognizes the uncomfortable enemies. It
[46:48] recognizes that little devils
[46:51] grow up to be
[46:53] big devils.
[46:55] Let me tell you, I've seen it way too
[46:56] many times. We got to quit petting
[46:58] things. And and when when when people
[47:00] deal with things as a little kid, and I
[47:02] there's many ways we could go right
[47:03] here, but I'll just go this because I've
[47:04] seen it so so so often. You see you see
[47:07] young men sometimes get caught in the
[47:08] trap of pornography.
[47:12] Real talk.
[47:14] And sometimes it's they'll eventually
[47:16] grow out of that.
[47:19] No, because little kid problems become
[47:22] big adult problems if you don't deal
[47:24] with it. You'll carry that thing right
[47:26] over into a marriage and then it'll
[47:27] destroy your marriage. You got to learn
[47:29] to deal with things and face the
[47:31] uncomfortable truth that I need a
[47:32] victory. This thing needs to be cut out
[47:34] of my life. I I need a deliverance. I
[47:36] need the Holy Spirit to come and drive
[47:38] this out and I got to be willing to do
[47:40] things that are uncomfortable.
[47:43] Brother Brown says, "After a while, when
[47:44] Joshua took the land, God told him,
[47:46] utterly destroy everything there is.
[47:48] Don't leave nothing." Why could you
[47:50] imagine some of them Israelite w women
[47:53] picking up a little baby? Think about
[47:55] this. This is brutal.
[47:58] It's uncomfortable.
[48:00] Isn't it cute? Look, it ain't even got
[48:03] no teeth yet. Joshua said, "Kill it."
[48:07] The mother said, "Oh, I'm a mother. I
[48:10] can't kill that baby."
[48:12] You must. Joshua said, "Hand it here.
[48:16] Why? It might look cute now, but it'll
[48:18] grow up and be just like its daddy.
[48:21] You can't baby sin. It's got to be
[48:25] handled not with gloves on, but
[48:27] barehanded.
[48:29] Think about, oh, how, brother Aaron? How
[48:31] can it be that bad?
[48:34] Why? Why can't I have an opinion?
[48:40] Now it's getting uncomfortable.
[48:44] See, everybody wants to kill the devil.
[48:46] They want to recognize, yeah, destroy
[48:48] the devil. Destroy the the obvious
[48:50] enemy.
[48:51] But people don't like total war because
[48:53] it makes you deal with
[48:58] self.
[49:01] It makes you deal with self.
[49:05] Listen, you have two great enemies in
[49:06] your in your life. No, your spouse is
[49:09] not one of them. [laughter]
[49:16] is the devil and yourself.
[49:19] And I want to tell you, it's a tight
[49:21] race as to who number one is.
[49:25] That's good.
[49:26] That's your two greatest enemies.
[49:28] That's your two enemies. And everybody
[49:30] believes the quote, "Destroy your enemy
[49:32] before it destroys you." But they don't
[49:34] want to identify the enemy.
[49:37] And when you can't identify it as the
[49:39] enemy, then you baby it.
[49:41] Then you let it live. And since it can't
[49:43] be you,
[49:45] it's not me. Then others become the
[49:47] problem.
[49:49] Oh, here we go.
[49:52] [clears throat]
[49:53] Others become the problem. And you take
[49:54] aim at others and you turn your weapon
[49:56] towards others instead of where it's
[49:58] supposed to be, at the devil and at
[50:00] yourself.
[50:02] At the devil and at yourself.
[50:05] Satan himself. You got to apply total
[50:07] war to you.
[50:08] Brother Brandham says GOD SAID, "UTTERLY
[50:10] DESTROY THE THING." SAYING, "AMEN."
[50:12] HALLELUJAH. What we need today, he says,
[50:13] "Oh, you're a baby and around with
[50:16] a whole lot of things you ought to be
[50:17] destroying."
[50:18] Amen.
[50:20] Listen, there's a reason that God
[50:22] demands that everything be killed
[50:23] because anything not dealt with right
[50:25] now is going to come back and fight you
[50:27] later.
[50:29] Anything you push off today is going to
[50:31] come back and try to keep you out of the
[50:32] rapture later. Anything in your life
[50:35] that isn't totally surrendered is going
[50:37] to rise up at some POINT IN YOUR LIFE
[50:39] AND TRY TO DESTROY you or it's going to
[50:41] be passed down generationally and try to
[50:43] destroy your children and your
[50:45] grandchildren. It's time we say no. It
[50:47] stops right here today. Lord, I'm going
[50:49] to deal with it. I'm going to recognize
[50:50] it. I'M GOING TO LAY PRIDE ASIDE AND
[50:52] SAY, "LORD, I'M THE ONE IN NEED. I'M THE
[50:54] ONE THAT NEEDS A TOUCH. I NEED MOLDED. I
[50:57] NEED MAKING. DEAL WITH ME TODAY, Lord
[50:59] Jesus." Amen.
[51:03] Let's look at it for a moment here in
[51:05] Samuel. And we're going to be in 1st
[51:07] Samuel for a while now. 1st Samuel 15.
[51:11] 1st Samuel 15:1. We're going to go
[51:12] through these scriptures.
[51:19] Says, "Samuel also said unto Saul,
[51:23] the Lord sent me to anoint thee to be
[51:25] king over his people, over Israel. Now
[51:28] therefore hearken thou unto the voice of
[51:30] the words of the Lord. Verse two,
[51:34] thus sayeth the Lord of hosts, I
[51:36] remember that which Amalecch did to
[51:38] Israel, how he laid weight for him in
[51:40] the way when he came up from Egypt. Now
[51:42] go and smite Amalecch, and utterly
[51:45] destroy all they that have, and spare
[51:46] them not, all that they have, and spare
[51:48] them not. But slay both man and woman,
[51:52] infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel
[51:55] and ass. This is total war.
[52:01] But you must have total war in order to
[52:04] have total victory.
[52:06] Verse four. And Saul gathered the people
[52:08] together and numbered them in Taleum,
[52:11] 200,000 footmen, 10,000 men of Judah.
[52:14] And Saul came to a city of Amalecch and
[52:17] laid weight in the valley. We're going
[52:18] to skip verse six. Go to verse 7. And
[52:21] Saul smokeote the Amalachites from
[52:23] Havila until thou comest to shure. that
[52:26] is over against Egypt. And he took Aag,
[52:28] the king of the Amalachites alive. Uhoh.
[52:33] Uhoh.
[52:36] Troubles brewing.
[52:39] And utterly destroyed all the people
[52:41] with the edge of the sword. Now, let's
[52:43] stop for just a moment. SAUL DID AN
[52:45] AWFUL LOT OF GOOD.
[52:49] He lined up to like 99.9%
[52:52] of the word right here.
[52:54] Hello, Eve.
[52:56] one word.
[52:58] He lined up. But in the midst of
[53:00] deliverance, in the midst of victory, in
[53:03] the midst of overcoming, he spares the
[53:05] enemy.
[53:07] Oh, come on. You've been there before.
[53:08] Right on the verge of a breakthrough,
[53:10] right on the verge. You're right there.
[53:11] The Lord's dealing with you, and you
[53:13] know within your heart, you need to deal
[53:14] with that thing. You're like, "That's
[53:15] not big deal. Just keep going."
[53:17] And that thing's laying there.
[53:20] [snorts]
[53:21] [sighs]
[53:22] Why do we spare it?
[53:25] Because we, now here's the problem. We
[53:27] don't think it should die. We don't see
[53:30] the harm in it. How could this little
[53:32] thing matter? How does that little thing
[53:34] m listen?
[53:36] We got to get to the place to where we
[53:38] start quit debating what it is that
[53:40] brother Brandham said that matters and
[53:42] doesn't matter. And this was his opinion
[53:43] that listen, I'm going to tell you right
[53:44] now,
[53:45] if it's on these pages, it matters.
[53:48] If it's on them tapes, it matters.
[53:50] If it's in them books, it matters. cuz
[53:52] he didn't just take up space to add a
[53:54] few words. It matters.
[53:57] Line up to the word.
[53:58] It matters.
[54:01] But we we we we wonder how could this
[54:02] matter. And we see value in in something
[54:05] that we can keep. We see value in our
[54:07] own opinion. We see value in our own
[54:10] ideas. Verse nine. But Saul and the
[54:14] people spared Aag and the best of the
[54:17] sheep and of the oxen and of the
[54:19] fatlings and the lambs and all that was
[54:20] good and would not utterly destroy them.
[54:24] But everything that was vile and refuse
[54:27] that they utterly destroyed other words.
[54:30] Oh yeah, I see why that needs to die.
[54:32] It's vile and refuse. The obvious enemy.
[54:36] Oh, I I see that. Yeah, I I see why that
[54:39] where that's wrong. But but listen, it
[54:42] was all wrong because all of it was a
[54:45] link back to the enemy's claim on the
[54:48] land.
[54:49] It was all a link back to his claim on
[54:51] your promise. So, IT HAD TO ALL BE
[54:54] DESTROYED. IT HAD TO ALL BE TORN. That
[54:56] attitude needs to be destroyed.
[54:58] That rebellion, young people, it needs
[55:00] to be destroyed. THAT IDEA THAT YOU HOLD
[55:02] IN your heart, that bitterness, that
[55:04] unforgiveness, those things all need to
[55:06] be destroyed
[55:08] because it's a link back. Amen.
[55:10] But in destroying the obvious, the vile,
[55:12] and refuse, then we appease our
[55:14] conscience that we've done what God
[55:16] asked us to do.
[55:17] I did all this.
[55:21] We'll see how Saul responds to this.
[55:25] Verse 10, then came the word of the Lord
[55:27] unto Samuel, saying, "It repenteth me
[55:30] that I have set up Saul to be king, for
[55:32] he has turned back from following me,
[55:34] and hath not performed my commandments."
[55:38] And it greed Samuel and he cried unto
[55:40] the Lord. Notice failing to do even a
[55:42] part was a failure to do any of it. You
[55:45] notice God didn't say Saul failed to do
[55:48] some of it.
[55:49] Saul did a lot of things the message
[55:51] told him to do,
[55:53] but he failed in some. No, no, no. He
[55:55] said he didn't follow it.
[55:59] None. He failed. Verse 12. And when
[56:04] Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the
[56:05] morning, it was told
[56:08] Samuel, saying, "Saul came to Carmel,
[56:10] and behold, he set him up a place, and
[56:12] has gone about and passed on and gone
[56:13] down to Gilgal." And Samuel came to Saul
[56:16] and said, "Saul," and Saul said unto
[56:18] him, now notice the difference. Notice
[56:20] the contradiction. Saul said, "BLESSED
[56:23] BE THOU OF THE LORD. I HAVE PERFORMED
[56:27] the commandments of the Lord."
[56:31] That's not what the Lord said.
[56:34] There is a total. Look at the
[56:36] self-righteousness of Saul. I HAVE
[56:40] PERFORMED EXACTLY WHAT THE LORD SAID.
[56:42] LOOK WHAT I'VE DONE. LOOK HOW IT
[56:43] PROSPERS. I've done what the Lord said
[56:46] to do.
[56:49] Church, just for a minute,
[56:51] don't get to the end of the line and
[56:53] point to what you've done.
[56:55] Don't don't get there. Lord, Lord, in
[56:57] your name haven't I done many mighty
[56:59] works.
[57:01] What was his response to that? Depart
[57:03] from me.
[57:04] He didn't deny that they had done those
[57:06] works.
[57:09] He didn't deny. He just said, "I never
[57:10] knew you."
[57:11] Don't get to that place and and and just
[57:13] say, "I'm a believer." And listen, this
[57:16] one's a touchy one, but I'm just gonna
[57:17] be real honest with y'all. I fly out
[57:19] today, so it'll be okay. [laughter]
[57:22] I'm be real real honest. YOU SAY, "I AM
[57:25] A believer and I would like to
[57:27] congratulate you for making it to the
[57:29] level of Satan."
[57:34] You You've made it to the level of the
[57:37] devil. Congratulations.
[57:39] Book of James tells us, "Oh, thou are
[57:41] the believer." Y'all believe there's
[57:42] one. Yeah. Thou doest well. The devil
[57:43] believes
[57:45] and trembles.
[57:49] I would suggest we progress beyond the
[57:51] level of the devil.
[57:53] I would suggest that we don't.
[57:59] Maybe I was a little harsh there. I'm
[58:00] thankful y'all are believers. You know
[58:02] that.
[58:04] I'm so thankful. I'm saying we can't get
[58:06] there and expect to just go in a rapture
[58:08] because I was a believer.
[58:11] Brother Brandham taught us very clearly
[58:12] there's a token and you must have that
[58:14] token.
[58:15] He taught us very clearly that. Listen,
[58:17] here's how I I was preaching to the
[58:19] young people recently. Here's what I
[58:20] told them. If all you've gotten to is
[58:22] justification and forgiveness, I
[58:24] celebrate that. I rejoice in that. I
[58:27] will never put you down for what you
[58:28] have, but I want to celebrate it and
[58:30] rejoice it while letting you know
[58:31] there's more for you.
[58:33] Press on. And if you've made it to
[58:34] sanctification, I'm so excited about
[58:36] that. And I thank God for the work he's
[58:38] done in your life. And I want to say
[58:40] though, I want to rejoice in celebrating
[58:42] that and not let you settle there, but
[58:43] say there's more for you. Press on to
[58:45] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Press on
[58:47] to the upper room experience. You have
[58:49] to have your own backside of the desert
[58:50] burning bush experience just like Moses
[58:53] had. I'm struggling. I'm struggling. I
[58:55] don't know if I can go any longer.
[58:56] Brother Brandham said the burning bush
[58:57] had exactly what Moses has lacked. If
[59:00] you're struggling today, if you need
[59:01] something today, the burning bush, the
[59:03] pillar of fire, yes, it has not left us.
[59:05] The pillar of fire has exactly what it
[59:08] is you lack today. You say, "WELL, I'VE
[59:10] BEEN FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST."
[59:12] HALLELUJAH. And now it's TIME TO GO TO
[59:14] ANOTHER REFILLING. BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID
[59:16] THE DYNAMICS OF THIS BRIDE would be a
[59:18] refilling of the Holy Ghost. You go AND
[59:21] YOU DRINK AND YOU DRINK SOME MORE.
[59:23] BROTHER BRANDHAM TOLD US, HE SAID, "THE
[59:24] PROBLEM WITH CHRISTIANS TODAY IS THEY'RE
[59:26] NOT CASHING IN ON THE ON THE DIVIDENDS
[59:28] OF THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST." HE
[59:30] SAID, "DRINK and then drink some more
[59:32] AND THEN DRINK SOME MORE AND THEN DRINK
[59:34] SOME MORE AND PUSH OUT AND DRINK SOME
[59:36] MORE AND PUSH OUT." THERE'S NO POINT
[59:38] WHERE WE STOP AND GO, "I MADE IT."
[59:41] NO, BUT PUSH FOR MORE AND SAY, "LORD, I
[59:43] GOT TO HAVE THAT TOKEN. I GOT TO HAVE A
[59:45] DRINK FROM THE ROCK. I NEED A FRESH
[59:47] EXPERIENCE TODAY. I NEED AN OUTPOURING
[59:49] TODAY. I NEED MORE OF YOU, GOD.
[59:54] Not just I'm a believer.
[1:00:02] You can look in the Bible, except a man
[1:00:04] be born again. Listen, the new birth is
[1:00:07] is is
[1:00:10] it's all through the Bible. It's all
[1:00:11] through the message. You must be born
[1:00:13] again. Amen.
[1:00:15] You can look to the prophet who said
[1:00:16] they're trying to dodge that issue of
[1:00:18] the new birth. The church is trying to
[1:00:20] dodge it. Today we take people in by
[1:00:22] water baptism. Put them in the church by
[1:00:25] water baptism. You might put them in the
[1:00:27] church by water baptism, but you'll
[1:00:28] never never put them into Christ by
[1:00:30] water baptism. You got to be born in
[1:00:33] there by the spirit.
[1:00:35] That's right.
[1:00:36] 1964 he said that's what's the matter
[1:00:38] today with the people. A new birth. They
[1:00:40] all dodge it. They don't like it. Oh,
[1:00:44] they have substituted something for the
[1:00:45] new birth. Come up and believe. And
[1:00:48] that's all you have to do. The devil
[1:00:50] believes himself and you know he's not
[1:00:52] born again.
[1:00:54] There's a new birth. There's something
[1:00:56] that goes with it. And it's kind of
[1:00:57] unfitting and untasting
[1:01:00] to the world.
[1:01:02] We can't dodge the fact that we got to
[1:01:03] have the new birth.
[1:01:06] But it's for you.
[1:01:08] It's available. There's a fountain today
[1:01:10] that's open in the house of David. He
[1:01:12] said, "The promise is unto you and to
[1:01:14] your children and to many as that would
[1:01:16] believe, even them that are a far off."
[1:01:18] I know I butchered that, but you know
[1:01:19] exactly what I was saying.
[1:01:23] The promise is for you today.
[1:01:27] 1st Samuel 15:14. We're going to
[1:01:29] continue with our story as we begin
[1:01:30] bringing this down. And Samuel said,
[1:01:33] "What meanth then this bleeding of the
[1:01:35] sheep in my ears?"
[1:01:38] You get there that day, what meanth that
[1:01:40] bitterness I see in your heart?
[1:01:43] What meanth that grudge you're still
[1:01:45] holding?
[1:01:48] What meanth that unforgiveness?
[1:01:52] What meanth then this bleeding and the
[1:01:54] loing of the oxen which I hear? And Saul
[1:01:57] said, "They have brought them from the
[1:01:59] Amalachites, for the people spared the
[1:02:01] best of the sheep and of the oxen to
[1:02:03] sacrifice unto the Lord thy God, and the
[1:02:05] rest we have utterly destroyed."
[1:02:08] They
[1:02:10] notice that they still trying to defend
[1:02:13] his actions, still trying to deflect the
[1:02:15] blame. Listen, you had a vindicated
[1:02:18] prophet in this day that came and this
[1:02:20] word is laid out so very plain that
[1:02:22] you're not going to be able to blame
[1:02:24] they.
[1:02:29] It's your responsibility.
[1:02:31] It's your word. Get into it. Find out
[1:02:34] what he's asking you to do. Find out the
[1:02:36] requirements that you need to meet.
[1:02:38] Verse 16. Then Samuel said unto Saul,
[1:02:40] "Stay, and I will tell thee what the
[1:02:42] Lord hath said to me this night." And he
[1:02:44] said unto him, "Stay on." And Samuel
[1:02:46] said, "When thou was little in thy own
[1:02:48] sight, was thou not made the head of the
[1:02:50] tribes of Israel? And the Lord anointed
[1:02:51] thee king over Israel? And the Lord sent
[1:02:53] thee on a journey and said, "Go and
[1:02:55] utterly destroy the sinners, the
[1:02:56] Amalachites, and fight against them
[1:02:58] until they be consumed. Wherefore did
[1:03:01] then did thou not obey the voice of the
[1:03:03] Lord, but did fly upon the spoil, and
[1:03:06] did evil in the sight of the Lord?"
[1:03:08] Notice how God interprets it so much
[1:03:10] different from how Saul interprets it.
[1:03:12] And Saul SAID UNTO SAMUEL, "YAY, I
[1:03:14] [screaming] HAVE OBEYED the voice of the
[1:03:16] Lord."
[1:03:18] He's arguing with the prophet
[1:03:21] and have GONE THE WAY WHICH THE LORD
[1:03:23] SENT ME AND HAVE BROUGHT Aag the king of
[1:03:26] Amalecch and have utterly destroyed the
[1:03:28] Amalachites. He gets so lifted up and he
[1:03:32] gets so consumed with the religious
[1:03:34] spirit, that's what it is,
[1:03:36] that he stands there confronted by the
[1:03:39] prophet and argues with him and says,
[1:03:42] "No, you're wrong."
[1:03:46] That's what he's saying here. You're
[1:03:47] wrong. I did. As a matter of fact,
[1:03:49] Samuel's speaking for God. So, he's
[1:03:51] actually saying, "God, you're wrong.
[1:03:54] I did it the right way." And this
[1:03:56] religious spirit has lifted him up and
[1:03:58] he's in a very dangerous place to where
[1:04:00] he values his own opinion more than what
[1:04:02] the message tells him to do.
[1:04:05] You did not do as God said. Well, that's
[1:04:08] your opinion and I don't like it. I have
[1:04:09] obeyed the Lord.
[1:04:12] Verse
[1:04:13] 21. But the people took of the spool.
[1:04:16] Here we go. The sheep and the oxen, the
[1:04:19] chief, and the things which should have
[1:04:21] been utterly destroyed to sacrifice unto
[1:04:22] the Lord thy God in Gilgal. Notice he
[1:04:24] makes it a religious thing right here.
[1:04:26] We did this so we could then give it to
[1:04:28] the Lord.
[1:04:30] You when people get into this delusion
[1:04:32] state and and and and they get under
[1:04:35] this religious spirit, they will always
[1:04:37] mask their actions behind worthy causes.
[1:04:41] Come on now. Be behind worthy worthy
[1:04:44] causes and worthy arguments.
[1:04:46] Well, I've got this quote.
[1:04:49] And I've got I've got this right here.
[1:04:51] Instead of just Lord, forgive me. That's
[1:04:53] that's as simple as it is. We make it so
[1:04:55] difficult. You know how many times I
[1:04:56] just say, "Lord, forgive me.
[1:04:59] I was wrong. I I see now. That's right
[1:05:02] there. It's plain. Lord, thank you for
[1:05:03] opening my eyes to that. Forgive me and
[1:05:05] anything I've done. Now, let me walk in
[1:05:07] the It's that simple. Don't defend
[1:05:09] yourself when confronted with the word.
[1:05:10] So many times we see it and it hurts us.
[1:05:15] This is total war. Lord, change me.
[1:05:18] Lord, change me.
[1:05:21] We have to recognize as we begin to come
[1:05:23] down and close this where our hindrance
[1:05:25] lays and we have to kill that thing.
[1:05:28] Listen, I had to declare war on who I
[1:05:30] was. Aaron Oglesby was not a good
[1:05:32] person. Aaron Oldby had too many of his
[1:05:35] own ideas. [snorts] the way daddy
[1:05:37] thought, the way mama thought. And I had
[1:05:39] to look at that and go, all that's gone.
[1:05:41] Lord, fill me with your spirit.
[1:05:44] Lord, renew my mind. Lord, put the mind
[1:05:46] of Christ in me. Lord, fill me. And I
[1:05:48] don't want to be stop right there, but
[1:05:50] fill me again. Lord, if I walk in dry
[1:05:52] places, I know the rock is right there.
[1:05:53] I'm going to take another drink. Lord,
[1:05:55] change me. I couldn't hold on to who I
[1:05:57] was and my ideas. That all had to be
[1:05:59] wiped out because there is none good but
[1:06:01] God. There was nothing good about me.
[1:06:03] And so I had to lay all that down and
[1:06:05] then I could be free. Then I could be
[1:06:08] filled, then I COULD GROW, THEN I COULD
[1:06:10] MATURE. Many times we throw that word
[1:06:12] around mature and you know you'll mature
[1:06:14] and of course you'll grow. Of course I
[1:06:16] believe in maturing in the Lord. I
[1:06:18] believe in growing but there can be no
[1:06:20] maturation and there can be no growth of
[1:06:22] a child if it was never born.
[1:06:25] There must be a birth and then yes you
[1:06:28] will mature and you will grow.
[1:06:29] Absolutely. But there is no growth and
[1:06:32] maturing if it's never born.
[1:06:34] And I had to get to that place where I
[1:06:36] could be born again. And then I could
[1:06:38] have victory in my life. HOW DID YOU do
[1:06:40] it? By laying me down.
[1:06:42] By declaring war on this and my ideas.
[1:06:45] Because look, I got opinions.
[1:06:49] We all do.
[1:06:51] But I can never let those opinions try
[1:06:52] to stack up against the word of God.
[1:06:55] Amen. Verse 22. And Samuel said, "Hath
[1:06:58] the Lord as great delight in burnt
[1:07:00] offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying
[1:07:02] the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey
[1:07:03] is better than sacrifice, and to hearken
[1:07:06] than the fat of rams? For rebellion is
[1:07:08] as the sin of witchcraft, and stubb
[1:07:10] stubbornness is as iniquity and
[1:07:12] idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the
[1:07:14] word of the Lord, he hath also rejected
[1:07:17] thee from being king." Skipping down to
[1:07:18] verse 32.
[1:07:21] Then Samuel said, "Bring ye hither to me
[1:07:23] Aag, the king of the Amalachites." And
[1:07:26] Aag came unto him delicately. And Aag
[1:07:30] said, "Surely the bitterness of death is
[1:07:33] passed." This word delicately here, if
[1:07:35] you get into it, means he came in a
[1:07:36] stately manner, portraying himself as a
[1:07:39] king. To let let Samuel know, listen,
[1:07:41] listen, bud, [clears throat] I'm
[1:07:43] royalty.
[1:07:46] Watch how you talk to me. And then he
[1:07:48] says, "Surely the bitterness of death is
[1:07:52] passed." Satan comes walking in trying
[1:07:55] to be all stately, what's the word? I
[1:07:58] don't know. Delicately. Thank you.
[1:08:01] Delicately. And he says, "Look, look,
[1:08:03] look. Listen. I know I tried to tear
[1:08:05] your family apart.
[1:08:08] I know I've made you sick. I know I
[1:08:09] brought depression. I know there's been
[1:08:11] so much anxiety in your life. I know I
[1:08:12] robbed you of your peace. I I I know you
[1:08:15] know your mom and dad's struggling. I
[1:08:16] know this. I know things are terrible at
[1:08:18] work. I understand I did all those
[1:08:19] things, but surely we can let bygones be
[1:08:21] bygones.
[1:08:23] Surely the bitterness has passed, right?
[1:08:26] It's Sunday.
[1:08:28] [laughter]
[1:08:29] We're supposed to have joy in THE LORD.
[1:08:30] YOU CAN'T GO about fighting the war on
[1:08:31] Sunday. Oh, I like Samuel's response.
[1:08:34] It's time some of us get in that
[1:08:35] attitude. Listen, there are no bygones
[1:08:36] and bygones with the devil. He will pay
[1:08:39] for everything. He has not got away with
[1:08:40] one thing he's done to you. He has not
[1:08:42] got away with one thing. He will be
[1:08:44] recompense for everything that he has
[1:08:46] done. He says, "Just let me live another
[1:08:49] day."
[1:08:50] It's okay. The bitterness of death.
[1:08:52] SURE. JUST LET THAT BITTERNESS stay one
[1:08:53] more day. LET THAT STRIFE STAY ONE MORE
[1:08:56] DAY. LET THAT GRUDGE IN YOUR LIFE STAY
[1:08:58] ONE MORE DAY. LET THAT COMPLEX THAT HAS
[1:09:01] CRIPPLED YOU. JUST LET IT STAY ONE MORE
[1:09:03] DAY. SURELY THOSE THINGS ARE PASSED. Let
[1:09:05] those secret sins stay one more day.
[1:09:10] Verse 33. And Samuel said, "As thy sword
[1:09:14] hath made women childless, so shall thou
[1:09:16] mother be childless among women." And
[1:09:18] Samuel heeded Aag in pieces before the
[1:09:21] Lord IN GILGAL. LISTEN, GOD WILL PROVIDE
[1:09:25] YOU WITH THE VICTORY. He provided the
[1:09:26] victory for Saul, but he he failed TO
[1:09:28] TAKE IT. HE PUTS THE SWORD IN YOUR HAND
[1:09:30] THIS MORNING, AND THE DEVIL COMES
[1:09:31] WALKING DELICATELY, AND THE LORD SAYS,
[1:09:33] "WHAT are you going TO DO ABOUT IT? WHAT
[1:09:35] ARE YOU going to do WITH THAT
[1:09:36] DEPRESSION? WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
[1:09:37] WITH THAT ANXIETY? WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO
[1:09:39] DO THAT has been robbing your joy and
[1:09:40] robbing YOUR PEACE? ARE YOU GOING TO
[1:09:42] MAKE A TREATY THIS MORNING? I SAY WE HEW
[1:09:44] HIM TO PIECES THIS morning in the sight
[1:09:46] OF THE LORD. I SAY WE CHOP HIM UP. WE
[1:09:48] CUT IT DOWN. WE DEAL WITH IT TODAY AND
[1:09:50] SAY, "ON THIS DAY, I'LL TAKE YOUR HEAD
[1:09:52] OFF. ON THIS DAY, EVERYBODY'S GOING TO
[1:09:54] KNOW THAT MY GOD STILL LIVES. MY GOD
[1:09:56] REIGNS. HE BRINGS PEACE AND HE BRINGS
[1:09:58] JOY AND HE BRINGS RESTORATION WHEN
[1:10:00] TOMORROW ON THIS DAY I'M GOING TO DEAL
[1:10:03] WITH IT TODAY IN THE HOUSE OF GOD."
[1:10:06] HALLELUJAH. Do not procrastinate.
[1:10:09] DON'T HESITATE. DON'T PUT IT OFF. DON'T
[1:10:11] WORRY ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE MIGHT THINK.
[1:10:13] If temper has hindered you, deal with it
[1:10:15] today.
[1:10:17] If lust HAS HINDERED YOU IN YOUR FAMILY,
[1:10:19] DEAL WITH IT TODAY.
[1:10:20] IF THERE'S BITTERNESS IN YOUR HEART,
[1:10:22] DEAL WITH IT.
[1:10:22] AMEN.
[1:10:23] IF THERE'S UNFOR YOU WILL NOT TAKE AN
[1:10:25] UNFORGIVING SPIRIT IN THE RAPTURE.
[1:10:27] If there's unforgiveness IN YOUR HEART,
[1:10:29] DEAL with it today. Amen.
[1:10:32] Critical spirit.
[1:10:35] Deal with it today.
[1:10:38] Y'all are lucky they gave me a small
[1:10:40] bottle of water.
[1:10:44] Smart. [laughter]
[1:10:46] I see how y'all operate.
[1:10:51] [clears throat]
[1:10:53] Deal with it.
[1:10:57] We find that Hmon
[1:10:59] over in the book of Esther.
[1:11:02] That's such an interesting thing.
[1:11:05] We know who Hmon was and his desire to
[1:11:07] destroy the entire Jewish race. We find
[1:11:10] that Hmon was a direct descendant,
[1:11:13] a direct descendant of the Amalachites
[1:11:16] that Saul was supposed to destroy.
[1:11:19] And he even carries the name of their
[1:11:21] king Aag.
[1:11:24] Esther 3 verse one. I'm going to wait
[1:11:26] for a minute till we can look at that
[1:11:27] together as we close.
[1:11:30] Total war.
[1:11:32] Deal with it today.
[1:11:34] Don't put it off even today. What can a
[1:11:36] day matter? I'll show you.
[1:11:38] Esther 3 and1. After these things did
[1:11:42] King Ahazerus promote Hmon, the son of
[1:11:45] Hammeditha, the Aagite.
[1:11:48] He even carries the name of the king
[1:11:51] Aag. The Aagite. Now, we don't always
[1:11:54] take these things for the gospel, but I
[1:11:56] found this to be so interesting. I was
[1:11:58] going through some Jewish histories and
[1:11:59] some Jewish writings and Jewish writings
[1:12:02] say that the leniency shown by Saul to
[1:12:05] King Aag actually made it possible for
[1:12:07] Hmon to appear. It says because had he
[1:12:10] been killed one day sooner
[1:12:13] or the day he was supposed to be killed
[1:12:16] or the Sunday you had opportunity to
[1:12:18] deal with it.
[1:12:22] the great peril which the Jews had to
[1:12:23] undergo at the hands of Hmon would have
[1:12:26] been averted because it was in that one
[1:12:28] day span that Aag's lineage was passed
[1:12:32] on
[1:12:33] and was able to continue and that leads
[1:12:36] directly to Hmon.
[1:12:38] But I want to bring good news today. You
[1:12:42] don't have to be a Saul.
[1:12:44] And not only that, it doesn't even
[1:12:46] necessarily matter about your physical
[1:12:47] lineage. It doesn't matter if daddy
[1:12:50] failed. Doesn't matter if granddaddy
[1:12:52] failed. Doesn't matter if mom failed.
[1:12:54] You have the opportunity today to be a
[1:12:56] cycle breaker.
[1:12:58] You have an opportunity to deal with
[1:12:59] that thing that's hindered your family,
[1:13:01] that's hung over your family, that dark
[1:13:03] cloud, that cycle that's been passed
[1:13:05] down from generation to generation. You
[1:13:07] can be a Morortei who in who who the
[1:13:10] Bible tells us in Esther 2 and 5. I want
[1:13:13] you to notice this chapter 2 verse 5 of
[1:13:15] Esther. [crying]
[1:13:17] It says that Mori
[1:13:20] was a descendant
[1:13:22] of Kish.
[1:13:25] Now in Shusham the palace there was a
[1:13:26] certain Jew whose name was Mordei the
[1:13:28] son of Jer the son of Shimiad the son of
[1:13:31] Kish.
[1:13:32] What do we notice about that? Why is
[1:13:33] that such a big deal? Who was Saul a son
[1:13:35] of?
[1:13:38] He didn't throw the clay away.
[1:13:41] He said I'm going to give this family
[1:13:42] another opportunity.
[1:13:43] Daddy might have failed. Daddy should
[1:13:45] have dealt with this thing years ago.
[1:13:46] Granddaddy should have dealt with this
[1:13:47] thing years ago. But today, I'm giving
[1:13:50] you an opportunity. Today, I'm saying
[1:13:52] you can deal with it. You can be an
[1:13:54] overcomer. You can be A CYCLE BREAKER.
[1:13:56] TODAY, IT'S TIME to declare TOTAL WAR.
[1:13:57] I'M NOT GOING TO LET this thing linger
[1:13:59] anymore. I'M NOT GOING TO PASS IT ON IN
[1:14:01] MY FAMILY. THERE'S GOING TO BE JOY IN MY
[1:14:03] HOME. THERE'S GOING TO BE A FAMILY ALTAR
[1:14:04] IN MY HOME. THERE'S GOING TO BE THE
[1:14:06] BLOOD APPLIED IN MY HOME. The token's
[1:14:08] GOING TO BE THERE. DADDY MIGHT NOT HAVE
[1:14:09] DONE IT, BUT I'M GOING TO DO IT. THAT
[1:14:11] LUST PROBLEMS FOLLOWED MY FAMILY. DADDY
[1:14:13] COULDN'T STOP IT. BUT TODAY, BY THE
[1:14:15] POWER OF THE HOLY GHOST, I'M DECLARING
[1:14:17] TOTAL WAR ON THAT THING. I'M GOING TO
[1:14:19] STOP IT. IT ENDS WITH ME. IT ENDS WITH
[1:14:21] MY FAMILY. LORD, I'M WILLING TO DO
[1:14:23] WHATEVER IT TAKES. THERE'S A RAPTURE.
[1:14:25] THERE'S A BODY CHANGE. THERE'S ETERNITY.
[1:14:27] AND I'M DECLARING TOTAL WAR ON THE DEVIL
[1:14:29] TODAY. I WON'T BE LEFT BEHIND. MY WIFE
[1:14:32] WON'T BE LEFT BEHIND. MY CHILDREN WON'T
[1:14:34] LET BE LEFT BEHIND BECAUSE I'M LEAVING
[1:14:36] NO ROCK UNTURNED, NO DEVIL UNDESTROYED.
[1:14:39] I'M GOING TO DO EVERYTHING IT TAKES. I'M
[1:14:41] GOING TO TAKE A BODY CHANGE. HALLELUJAH.
[1:14:44] WHO'S GOT THAT IN THEIR HEART THIS
[1:14:46] MORNING? LORD, I DECLARE WAR. I DECLARE
[1:14:48] WAR ON THE ENEMY. Can you stand to your
[1:14:50] feet with me today and just praise him
[1:14:52] and let them know, Lord, I'm signing up
[1:14:54] for battle today. I'M IN THE ARMY TODAY.
[1:14:57] I'M DRAWING MY SWORD TODAY. I'M NOT
[1:14:59] GOING TO STOP SHORT. I'M NOT GOING TO
[1:15:01] GIVE IN. I'M NOT GOING TO LET THIS thing
[1:15:02] live another day. I'VE BEEN ROBBED LONG
[1:15:05] ENOUGH. BUT TODAY, I DECLARE TOTAL WAR.
[1:15:08] It's your turn today.
[1:15:10] Saul didn't do it. Saul didn't do it.
[1:15:13] But Mori, it's your turn today.
[1:15:18] Brother Brandham says, "There's the
[1:15:21] promised land. She's flowing with milk
[1:15:23] and honey, but before you get there,
[1:15:26] you're going to go through all these
[1:15:27] Hivites and Canaanites [music] and
[1:15:28] everything. But don't you bow to one of
[1:15:31] them. You destroy the things as you come
[1:15:35] to them. Stop building a fire on the
[1:15:38] enemy's altar."
[1:15:40] Amen. I wished I was twice the size I am
[1:15:43] right now. Maybe I'd feel twice as good.
[1:15:44] He says,
[1:15:47] "It's time to take another step."
[1:15:49] [music]
[1:15:51] You know, many of you maybe been serving
[1:15:52] the Lord a lot longer than I have,
[1:15:56] but you can't stay. How'd that happen?
[1:16:02] Y'all going [music] to be sitting. I'm
[1:16:03] kidding.
[1:16:06] You can't stay where [music] you're at.
[1:16:09] I don't care how great your experiences
[1:16:11] have been, you can't stay where you're
[1:16:12] at.
[1:16:15] Because if you're where you're at
[1:16:17] [music] right now, same place you were
[1:16:18] 10 years ago,
[1:16:21] you've been left behind. Say, what do
[1:16:23] you mean by that?
[1:16:25] Too many people [music] are stuck at the
[1:16:26] point of their last major victory.
[1:16:29] It's not a bad thing, but think about
[1:16:31] it. [music] If you were there that day
[1:16:32] when the death angel passed and you put
[1:16:35] blood on the doorpost
[1:16:38] and [music] on the mantle and just
[1:16:39] exactly how you were told and the death
[1:16:41] angel, what a victory. How incred what a
[1:16:43] testimony you'd have. But then the next
[1:16:46] day as the people were leaving, you
[1:16:47] [music] stood there going, "Where are
[1:16:49] all the fanatics going? I'm staying with
[1:16:52] what the prophet told me to do. Prophet
[1:16:54] told me to put blood on the doorpost. I
[1:16:56] ain't moving."
[1:16:59] But the message moved on.
[1:17:01] Not a new message. The same message
[1:17:03] leading
[1:17:05] the message moved on
[1:17:07] and you stood there [music] with what
[1:17:08] the prophet said. Are you standing on a
[1:17:10] truth? [clears throat] Absolutely.
[1:17:13] But you got to be willing to move.
[1:17:16] What if you crossed the Red Sea and you
[1:17:18] danced on [music] the banks with Marion?
[1:17:20] Think about it. What a victory. But if
[1:17:23] you were still dancing there a [music]
[1:17:24] week later,
[1:17:28] you got left. You're still [music] in
[1:17:30] the wilderness. You've been delivered by
[1:17:32] the pillar of fire, watched great
[1:17:34] miracles, been in incredible services,
[1:17:36] following the prophet, vindicated by a
[1:17:38] pillar of fire,
[1:17:40] and you're in the wilderness
[1:17:42] cuz you [music] camped down and didn't
[1:17:44] move.
[1:17:47] I'm just [music] encouraging you. Move.
[1:17:52] Don't be satisfied where you are. Take
[1:17:54] another drink. Take another step. Lord,
[1:17:57] reveal yourself more to me. [music]
[1:17:59] Brother Brandham said, "You can never
[1:18:00] pray too much for revelation." Lord,
[1:18:02] reveal yourself more to me. Lord, is
[1:18:04] there things I don't understand right?
[1:18:05] Am I too critical about certain [music]
[1:18:07] things? You know, we learn a lot from
[1:18:09] our prophet when he's sitting there and
[1:18:10] those uh ladies was dancing [music] in
[1:18:12] his church and he had the attitude.
[1:18:14] Y'all remember the story? He said,
[1:18:15] "They're going to turn my church into a
[1:18:16] tavern." And they were dancing and and
[1:18:20] shouting [music] and he was said, "I was
[1:18:21] sitting in the seat of the scornful."
[1:18:23] Now, this my point here isn't about
[1:18:25] dancing. I [music] want you to listen to
[1:18:26] the attitude of the prophet. He said,
[1:18:28] "But I didn't say anything [music]
[1:18:32] in case they, these sisters, were right
[1:18:36] [music]
[1:18:36] and I, the prophet, was wrong."
[1:18:40] What
[1:18:42] can we take that attitude? Lord, if I
[1:18:44] don't understand something, I'm just not
[1:18:46] going to say anything about it. I'm just
[1:18:47] going to pray. Lord, you [music] reveal
[1:18:48] it to me. Lead me, Lord. Lead me, Lord.
[1:18:50] In case that might be right, I might be
[1:18:52] wrong. Lord, I just want to take [music]
[1:18:53] another step today. Lord, I don't want
[1:18:55] to leave anything undone, anything
[1:18:56] unturned.
[1:18:58] [music] He to He fought a total war for
[1:19:00] you so that you could have total
[1:19:02] victory.
[1:19:04] He bought total victory for you. [music]
[1:19:05] There's no reason you have to stay sick.
[1:19:07] There's no reason you have to stay
[1:19:08] bound. There's no reason you have to
[1:19:09] stay in depression. [music] There's no
[1:19:11] reason that your family can't be
[1:19:12] restored, that your relationship with
[1:19:13] God can't be restored. There's total
[1:19:14] victory in the house of God. I believe
[1:19:16] that with my whole heart. There's a
[1:19:18] fountain open unto you today.
[1:19:20] Amen. [music]
[1:19:21] to those that will receive. Who can just
[1:19:23] with an open heart say, "Lord, I want to
[1:19:25] take another step. [music]
[1:19:26] Lord, I just want to take another step.
[1:19:28] That's my desire. Lord, I just want to
[1:19:29] take another step. I want to go total. I
[1:19:31] want to surrender more. And the more
[1:19:33] that I surrender, [music]
[1:19:35] the more that he'll take control."
[1:19:37] God bless you, church. Been an
[1:19:39] incredible, wonderful audience. Thank
[1:19:41] you for your attention. I love you in
[1:19:43] the love of the Lord. [music] And I just
[1:19:44] pray that we can take another step
[1:19:46] today, that we can walk together today.
[1:19:49] I just [music] want you to know that you
[1:19:52] come a long way from Louisiana, but you
[1:19:54] sure made me feel welcome. [music] While
[1:19:56] we're here, if there is anybody that
[1:19:58] that would desire prayer or have any
[1:20:00] need, I'd be glad to pray with you. God
[1:20:02] bless you as you walk [music] with him.
[1:20:04] If we don't see you again, I'm going to
[1:20:05] see you there cuz we ain't staying where
[1:20:07] we're at. We're taking another step. God
[1:20:10] bless [music] you, church.
[1:20:13] Hey. Hey. Hey.
