========================================
to that Deuteronomy chapter 22 start with verse 5 the woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man neither shall a man put on a woman's garment for all that do so are Abomination unto the Lord thy God if a bird's nest chance to be before thee in the way in any tree or on the ground whether they be youngans or eggs and the dam sth upon the young or upon the eggs Thou shalt not take the dam with the young but Thou shalt in any wise let the dam go and take the young to thee that it may be well with thee and that thou mayest prolong thy days when thou buildest a new house then Thou shalt make a Battlement for thy roof that thou bring not blood upon thine house if any man fall from th Thou shalt not seow thy vineyard with diverse seeds lest the fruit of thy seed which thou Hast swn and the fruit of thy Vineyard be defiled Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together th th shalt not wear a garment of diverse sorts as of Woolen and linen together Thou shalt make the fringes upon the four quarters of thy vesture wherewith thou coverest thyself wow that's a lot amen God bless you you can be seated as you could tell from the title slide my uh subject today is deceptive form deceptive form and we're going to come back to Deuteronomy chapter 22 here in a moment and when I'm using the word form I have been thinking along the lines of something that's being fashioned or shaped and as we'll even see in here in the text that we're reading there's different things that relate to the things that we wear and and uh the fashion so form kind of could be used in different ways but just to give you a little bit of a peek into some of the things I was looking at of the seven uh essential elements of art and that's what they've distilled it down to two of them are shape and form and so there's five other ones that they distill art down to seven Essential Elements and shape I was going to give some slides to demonstrate this but I think we can all handle it but a shape is a flat enclosed uh area of an artwork that's created through lines and textures and color and so you could look at a square in a picture or on a piece of paper and this uh two-dimensional representation in media and that would be a shape and shapes are used for different reasons it can add definition or depth it can create focal points it can convey motion and in a painting that's just a flat twodimensional representation of shape but artists can use a trick it's a trick that can create the illusion of depth and that's where you would take a square and we've all done this in fourth grade math where we took a square and we turned it into a cube and all of a sudden that flat two-dimensional object now takes on what looks to be a three-dimensional shape and that's what makes it a form it goes from a shape to a form just by using our our minds and this depth perception and it's actually a way to deceive the viewer and to seeing something that is literally two-dimensional since it's just pencil on paper or paint on a canvas and it looks as if it has depth and so in the use of form again is like taking a square turn it into a cube or maybe uh you could have this the square is the shape the cube is the form and you could do that with a circle turn it into the cylinder it's actually a trick that causes you to see something that's actually not there my original title was going to be trumploy which is a French word for deceive the eye and it's a word in art where it's a technique that when you look at something you say wow that looks as if it travels distance that looks as if it's actually um has shape and you could grab a hold of something and there's a whole uh genre of art where people painted pictures where it looks like the person is coming out of the canvas it's actually a piece of art that's called trumploy that is a a a paint a sketch of a cow and a milk jug and it looks as if it's tacked onto a piece of wood the wood is painted everything's painted and it's uh it's just a trick to make it look like you're looking at a scrap of paper on a piece of wood there's a famous piece of art uh it's a painting of a pipe a smoking pipe and in French it says this is not a pipe and hundreds of years well maybe it's more like 60 70 years of debates on what this painting means and so people have a lot of time on their hands but that would be it's done in even in a way where the the wording and everything it's presented in a way to cause the person to see something and consider something we might call them visual Illusions where it appears as if something has depth and it has uh shape more than shape it has some sort of uh distance to it you could hold it and it's a trick it's an element of art that actually deceives the Mind into perceiving width or or or depth not just height and length but you see something there on that canvas that gives you a little bit more of a thought and a feeling and that's why I'm using this title deceptive form I'm wanting us to consider this that there are shapes and forms that can lead us away from true beauty that can deceive us there's a fashion there's there shape and form and evil comes in every shape and form and there's ways that shapes uh uh can cause us to perceive motion and convey a meaning and and FOC focus on something you use a they'll use a shape in art to draw your ey to something and then there's the use of form and I'm kind of focusing more on this form where you just add a little bit more to it and it causes to lead us astray and I'm saying it's actually deceptive because it's leading us away from true beauty leading us away from things that are true and things that are real and tricking our minds into desires that are ungodly so that's the that's the basis for this title deceptive form now in Deuteronomy CH 22:5 says this and this is a very familiar scripture I think to most of us if not all of us and I am continuing on some of the things that we've been ministering on in these different subjects prior to this uh there's no question these things are um connected together the woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man and I believe that this is what immediately comes to mind when anybody just references Deuteronomy 225 is this part a woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man and there's a neither neither neither shall a man put on a woman's garment so there's two parts to this and it says for all that do so are those that do it all that do so are Abomination unto the Lord thy God Abomination here is the Hebrew word a disgusting thing it is something that is detestable abhor and it it would be foul or loathsome to God the they that do this are detestable or loome unto the Lord meaning this is something these would be people that displease God and if you could just catch that it says a woman that wears that which pertaineth unto a man and a man that puts on a woman's garment it's the wearer the man or the woman that is abomination you catching that it's that's that's what he dis is displeasing to him I'm going to run through several scriptures and um and I I don't want to go too fast but then again I don't want to get bogged down in it but the the purpose of this exercise of reading several scriptures is for us to see that there's this that there's ways that God was declaring his way and his nature and his attitude when he was giving these laws to Israel and he wasn't doing all of the laws didn't necessarily pertain to things that God hates uh but he gave them many laws to govern their lives as we were reading already in Deuteronomy that it tells us that you ought not to mix uh garments of diverse sorts of Woolen and linen together now how many here have violated the law this morning hands are going up all over the place because we do those things we we mix our our fabrics and we don't think twice about it but yet here God says Thou shalt not do it how many have a a pot a pot of succulents or plants that have diverse seeds in them and we're like yeah I didn't think about this you're think I got to go home and clean up my life well you realize there's a lot of laws and things that we read here uh th shalt make fringes upon the four quarters of thy vesture wherewith thou covers thyself well who's got the Fringe this morning who's not trimmed their beard the correct way and who washed the same pots in this sink with these other pots and you realize there's a lot of laws that that governed Israel that didn't necessarily track back to God's nature that the thing itself was detestable or that the person that did it was detestable but it was laws that governed their lives that may speak to something about God's nature and that his detail or it may have some type but the thing in itself or the act itself or the person doing it was an Abomination to God so what I'm wanting you to see is through several scriptures those things that God despised and if he despised it then he despises it now says in Deuteronomy 7: 25- 26 this would be one that you could follow throughout the Old Testament the graven images of their gods shall you burn with fire Thou shalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them nor take it unto thee lest thou be snared therein so these are Idols that had been fashioned by the hands of man overlaid with gold or silver that were worshiped by the Heathen and he says for it is an Abomination to the Lord thy God well what particular aspect of this was an Abomination well the graven images were Abomination the the fact that they were worshiped was an Abomination so these things God did not want them to take the gold and silver into themselves and keep it because he says it will be a snare to thee here's something that God says I hate this and in hating it I even recognize that it has this potential to influence you so just leave it alone neither shalt thou bring an abomination of thy house what is the Abomination the idols the things that were overlaid with gold and silver and worship lest thou be cursed be a cursed thing like it but Thou shalt utterly detest it and thou shalt utterly abhor it for it is a cursed thing that's a good definition of what an Abomination is something that is detested utterly abhor and that God is cursed what is he specifically talking about idol worship and idols and these are things and we could we could even say in a sense like maybe as a cliche anything that you put between you and the Lord is an idol and uh and and that has a great weight to it it's a good way to cause us to think and that is true and and in that sense you could correct the order right you can correct the order and and and and be okay say well I've I've taken this job and I've and I've and I that I utterly detest an a poor but you can take something and just put it in its proper place and it's no longer that thing between you and God but here these are things that had no other use or utility other than to be worshiped as God or as a God and that they ascribed things to it and there was this real conviction and belief that these things had some Worth to them and valued that they ought to be venerated and worshiped and they overlaid them with precious materials and they desired that they would speak back and they imagined that they spoke and they were wor worshiped given that faith and given reverence and attention as God in place of the true God and so it was Abomination to take that and put it into their home uh was to give Credence to acknowledge and to venerate a false god and it was utterly detested should be utterly abored it was a cursed thing in chapter 12 Thou shalt not do so unto the Lord thy God for every Abomination to the Lord which he hateth have they done unto their God so now there is an attitude of a way of worship that the Heathen did to their Idols that God uphor and he detest it and he hates it this is God's attitude we're talking about very specific things that the Bible says is an Abomination to the Lord thy God here in this chapter it say for in these verses every Abomination to the Lord is what the Heathen has done he hates it for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods that's quite an Act of Faith isn't it they their sacrific and their children to their gods he says what thingss soever I command you observe to do Thou shalt not add thereto nor diminish from it and in this particular instance he's saying that there's a way of worship of the heathens that you ought not to assimilate into your worship and there's not a requirement that you sacrifice your children unto me and to cause them to walk through fire and do certain things these are things that God hates Deuteronomy 18: 9-14 when thou art come into the land which the Lord thy God giveth theee Thou shalt not learn to do after the Abominations of those Nations those habits there's ways there there's a way of worship and a pattern of life and certain things that they would do that are called Abomination there sh not be found among you anyone that maketh his son or daughter to pass through the fire or that useth divination or an observer of times or an enchanter or a witch or a charmer or a consulter with familiar spirits or a wizard or a necromancer for all that do these things are an Abomination unto the Lord now there's a lot there we could unpack and take all those things from passing through the fire to divination the enchanter and these things that say all that would do those things are Abomination unto the Lord and it would be the same today we were able to find some Modern application or some one that would in practice that would do these very things we would say that these things are still Abomination unto the Lord and because of these Abominations the Lord thy God doth drive them out from before thee Thou shalt be perfect with the Lord thy God God is showing that there's things that are Abomination and let me say it this way things that are foul or detestable things that are um are not right and and it doesn't necess say God doesn't necessarily attach his own attitude towards say these are Abomination to me but there's Abominations that he's driving out because they can influence you and these very specific things he says I'm driving them out because they could cause you to transgress they could cause you to add or to take away they could cause you to stumble and as it says they should cause you to be cursed yourself so these are the influence of these things so think about the influence of things that God hates why does God hate them he hates them for a reason chapter 23: 18 Thou shalt not bring the higher of a or the price of a dog into the house of the Lord thy God for any vow for even both these are Abomination unto the Lord thy God a lot of scholarship and research and a lot that conclude that the price of a dog here it's not necessarily uh the dog itself but it refers to a sodomite so here in this you see one that is the higher of a and the price of a dog so it says prostitution and sodomy in themselves are Abomination to God and then the price of those things the higher of those things he's saying the this too would be an Abomination Lord don't bring these things into the temple cuz he's pointing out moral sin things that would transgress God's law in this moral sin and then the higher of it he said these things ought not to be brought into the house of the Lord so this is something where God says both these are abomination of the Lord thy God not necessarily the the money itself but the gain how it was gained and then the moral sin that gave rise to it you're catching this staying very close close to scripture so that we can all we can be adults here and it's in the word of God and we can do this in a way that pleases the Lord in Deuteronomy chapter 27:1 15 cursed be the man that maketh any Graven or molten image an Abomination unto the Lord a reminder again that false images that are worshiped as a god are an abomination of the Lord the work of the hands of the Craftsman and putteth it in a secret place and all the people shall answer and say Amen these things are Abomination it's worshiped it's reverenced as a God God says this is doesn't say don't make any graven images or worship it uh because that would be it would not be expedient he's saying it's an Abomination to me go back to the Ten Commandments Thou shalt have no other God before thee so this is something that when God gave these you could track it back to the attitude of God towards specific things things that he hates things that he despises in Proverbs 15 verse 8 and N you'll find there's several Proverbs that talk about six yay rather seven things that God hates it says the sacrifice of the wicked is an Abomination to the Lord but the prayer of the upright is his Delight then there's this contrast sacrifice of the wicked is an Abomination but the prayer of the uprite he loves he he desires that verse n The Way of the Wicked is an abomination of the Lord but he loveth him that followeth after righteousness what are these scriptures teaching us though we might say this is pretty General it's not specific and we don't know exactly what that sacrifice might be or what that way might be we could say there is a way that is wicked and a Way of the Wicked there is a sacrifice of the wicked that God abhor and he detests and his taste aren't going to change's he's going to hate it as we read in Malachi I'm the Lord and I change not just because I you haven't been consumed in your sins does it mean my attitude towards these things have changed I just am longsuffering still so there are things that are are an Abomination detestable utterly abhor hated by God in verse 26 of the same chapter the thoughts of the wicked are an Abomination to the Lord but the words of the pure are pleasant words here we have the sacrifice the way and the thoughts of a wicked that are hated by God despised and detested by God these are not things to say well the Way of the Wicked is is weird or The Way of the Wicked is different and The Way of the Wicked you shouldn't Like the Way of the Wicked this is not God kind of hinting to you and suggesting saying this is me as for me and my attitude towards these things I hate it and I despise it now in Deuteronomy chapter 22:5 the woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man neither shall a man put on a woman's garment for all that do so are Abomination unto the Lord thy God what he is expressing here in these two uh prior phrases the woman addressing the woman and the man and he says that all that do so are Abomination it's connected with those things that God hates and there's other scriptures who say well the The Way of the Wicked the thoughts of the wicked and these different scriptures that may seem to be General we could bring this principle back to these other things that are the scripture observes as God's General attitude towards things and they connect back to that but if I could say this God these things all those that do these being an Abomination to the Lord and many of these other scriptures you read though they are connected or they're identified as what God hates they're more of a consequence of what God loves I mean kind I pick up on that catch that I don't know if I've already lost you uh with uh I don't know with the shapes in the very beginning but I hope you're focusing we can think well God hates those that do these things well it's not that he is just woke up that morning as a hater and he just wants to find something to hate and the first thing he sees will do but rather it's because of what he loves it's a consequence of what he loves and he desires God is the author of true beauty when God created everything there was something harmonious about it there was something beautiful about it so he loves the original symmetry he loves the harmony of beauty he loves things being in their original form the way that God originally intended them to be we've read from Deuteronomy 17:1 the last few Services Thou shalt not sacrifice unto the Lord thy God any bulock or Sheep wearing is blemish or evil favored why is it that God would want a sacrifice to be pure and to be clean and to be whole it's it it's what you're offering to God it's what you're sacrificing to God and it spoke it pointed to a perfect sacrifice which would be Christ so a sacrifice that has blemished or is evil favored is an Abomination unto the Lord thy God this evil favored is something that's there's a deformity it lacks wholeness and God loves truth he hates hypocrisy why does he hate hypocrisy because he loves truth he hates perversion evil favored would be some perversion he hates deception these are things that God hates cuz he he's a god of Truth he's a god of um uprightness these are things that God values in Proverbs 3:32 it says for the frow word is abomination to the Lord but a secret is with the righteous this frow word is from a the Hebrew word meaning to depart or to go wrong to go crooked or to pervert means actually has a meaning to be lost from view now think of what that means the FR word when something is crooked or perverted when something departs think of something that ought to be one way ought to be one place ought to represent a certain thing or look a certain way and when it departs from that or the way it's originally intended to be seen and used is no longer used for that or seen as that it's lost from view God hates that he hates something when it goes crooked or is perverted it is abomination to the lord it's not necessarily the code of conduct or rules that you might have uh there's uh maybe this is a good example but you've all heard of house rules that you go to someone's house and you're playing Doom Lings and they have a certain way that they do it in that house and that would be be the rules as as for me in my house this is how we play veiled fate as for me in my house this is how we play moonrakers and this is how it is and then you go to someone else's house like oh we don't play it that way we do it differently now we could say in this house it's wrong and in this house it's right and we could so even we can get so charged and say well that's an Abomination you play that way you play Uno that way and and some can be a purist and now this is the only way to play Uno you're not supposed to do that people like you mean this is the way we've done it our whole lives you can stack this you can do that you can end with a draw four there's ways that people will play it and if you play it differently it's Abomination but is it really a sin is it something that God hates debate break out into your sessions and debate this and and so there's things that we could say would be house rules that would be wrong and this is the right way this isn't a house rule this is God's nature these are things that God hates there's actually some games where the goal is to lie as good as you can and I tell you don't ever play Baler Dash with brother Tim puit he'll get you because you would not expect him to write that nor anybody else at the table like oh my goodness gracious why they say that and it's him and he wins Proverbs 20:10 says diverse weights and diverse measures both of them are alike Abomination to the Lord this goes to the heart of God who hates Injustice and diverse weights and measures there's a lot that we could share from the scripture other verses dealing with the same thing false weights are an Abomination to the Lord but there would be the use of different weights and different measures different Stones one to buy one to sell they would appear the same and maybe seem to be the same thing but you would use one you have one out for pretense and maybe You' have it there and it looks like the same but then you would misuse it or swap it out giving somebody the appearance that everything's even so you're going to you're going to buy something and you use one weight and so you get more out of it then when you go to sell it it looks like you're using the same thing but you use a different one so you get even more you short change somebody God hates that the diverse weights and diverse measures this lack of transparency in the use of it was very tangible in that day where you would think well this is this is how much this weighs and this is how much it's being used but then something either either by of hand or just by appearance sake you think they're the same but it's defrauding the purchaser or the seller God hates that notice God's not just saying no no no no that's shady don't do that that's not nice he's saying I hate it that's Abomination he's not saying man that's a real edgy business practice I wouldn't do it but you know if that's the way you want to do it I'm not going to judge you I mean it's exact opposite God's saying I wouldn't do it that way I hate you doing it that way and I will judge you for doing it that way because it goes back to God who is above all who is pure and these are things that he hates now if you could take that back to Deuteronomy 22:5 the woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man neither shall a man put on a woman's garment for all that do so male or female are hated and despised and detested by God Deuteronomy chapter 22:5 distinguishes between male and female and their type of garments you follow me everybody follow me men I'm speaking to you too because it says you shouldn't wear a woman's garment okay so and everybody what is going on here brother Aaron's dealing with something who's here Genesis chapter 1 ver 27 as I so often do I end up finding myself back in Genesis 1 chapters 1:3 but it says in verse 27 so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them that's the only we don't believe in they them but that's a them we'll believe in male and female created he them male the word there male actually means recalls to mind so the male Adam made in the image of God recalled God's image zakar it recalled to mind God then at from man the man he created the female which is a piece of the male and something that was struck off or came off the man and so we can never get away from this and I think there's so much uh chatter and noise out there in The Ether to where these things they try to confuse them they try to amplify them there's been a little bit of a cultural kick back now where we some people like yeah de I is d i y i n g it's and everyone's excited and happy that these things are going to did I spell the die or dying whichever one it is it's being killed and everyone's happy and we're being shifted back to two genders well let's just settle it scripturally there are only two and so this distinction that God made between male and female was one of natures when God separated out the woman there was a difference in spirit in nature there was a difference in use in terms of what one was suited for and there was a difference in appearance she was equal but opposite Adam didn't look in the mirror and say is that me he didn't or look at her and say is that me me he he saw her as being complimentary a part of him but she was different and in Genesis 2:25 it says and they were both naked the man and his wife male and female the man and his wife and were not ashamed I know we've covered this at length in years past but uh for all of us here some having not been here before he says they were both naked and if we looked at that in its most simple sense they had no need for covering they were were they had no need of clothing whether for Comfort or concealment they didn't need they didn't need clothing because the temperature uh uh they needed to be shielded from the Sun so they get sunmer they didn't need clothing so they could be shielded from cold temperatures so they didn't need it for Comfort nor concealment because it says they were not ashamed and so they were innocent there was no cause for shame there was certainly no cause for blush in other words they had no uh knowledge or experience of something impure nothing had was misused and nothing was out of order and so there was no there's no sense of Shame they were naked without the need of covering I don't want you to think of it they were naked just in that moment but it's actually conveying they didn't need it and they were not ashamed they were innocent they they say that an innocent child who hasn't been tested or provoked does not have a sense of shame but it's through experience that experience replaces innocence so an innocent child doesn't have a sense of Shame and just just watch a child uh when just out here at church they need to go they'll go right they Haven an experience this sense of Shame and then what happens is the parents give them a sense of Shame and they realize well I didn't think there was anything wrong with that but I'm not going to do that again because I have been appropriately a warned uh that this is not right or this is not good behavior and we would argue that that's correct but there is no sense of Shame for the innocent John Wesley even said blushing is now the color of virtue speaking in his time he says but it was not the color of Innocence why would you blush if you didn't know something was inappropriate or immodest and so blushing we say now that we blush when we see something that isn't right but it says that blush was not the color of Innocence they were naked and not ashamed there was no blush so in their innocence their nakedness man and woman were co-equal but different in nature and their differences were uncovered due to their nakedness right they were different there was this clear and obvious distinction male and female and there was no shame in that but then in Genesis 3:7 after the fall says and the eyes of them both W opened and we all of us the adults and everyone just were jumping in after the original sin we know that the woman was caused uh to see something in a way that it shouldn't have been seen what once had shape and form she saw differently what once was one way she now desired in the wrong way so now there's a deceptive form and the eyes of them she shares it with her husband the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked it's not this realization all of a sudden where it's like oh my goodness I thought I had I didn't realize it's like that dream we all have where we show up at school and we're wearing our pajamas or just our underwear you all have it don't laugh at me right oh my goodness what am I doing here why am I they they knew that there was no clothing but now they knew that they were naked so now it's when that innocence has been replaced with the experience and their nakedness and and what it revealed meant something totally different now and so they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons Hebrew word for that whoosh they made themselves aprons so the opening of their eyes awakened the ashame of nakedness and what did it cause them to do immediately put on clothing something a covering so there was this instinct to cover please are you I hope that you follow me parents I understand that there's maybe some responsibility at home if this brings up some questions but there was this instinct to cover their distinguishing parts and they did it by making an apron now notice it doesn't say and they made themselves a jumpsuit and they made themselves a um you know a onesie no it said they made themselves an apron which is that Hebrew word for loin cloth or girdle so there was this consciousness of their nakedness and it wasn't like I need to cover my skin I I could get sunburned no it was immediately this Consciousness and awareness of the female and the male and what made them different in Deuteronomy chapter 25:1 I hope I have that one here do I did I write it so if you want to just read this those who can read and and it's it's speaking of two people in an argument and then when the wife wants to intervene and the phrase is taketh him by the secrets it is exactly what you're thinking it's the same word that's used uh uh it comes from the same word that's used for loin cloth the part that excites shame and the next verse says cut off her hand because God's attitude towards it that act doing that is some violation but notice how the association of the the apron it was the secrets that which causes shame what they covered is what they what they awaken them to their shame their differences and how it was used they're awakened to their shame now as I've been studying this I found an argument where and this is a pretty aggressive argument because a lot of the scriptures and I may be using a term I haven't used to this point modesty a lot of the uh history and scholarship and research and academic writing on modesty traces back to scripture and religious movements and so in and it's not just Christianity but if Islam uh uh and in Judaism it's rooted in these text and so there's this argument that modesty is the creation of man upon recognizing the sexual power of the body that this is what man invented that man created he created this uh I think they may be done reading this verse so we can take that one down that there is this man recognizing the ability and capacity of their body male and female that mankind made the decision to cover themselves one made the statement the sense of modesty is merely a habit not an instinct in other words the sense of modesty is something that's imposed enforced but the scripture differs right when their eyes were open their Instinct was to cover themselves nobody told them to do it now God didn't even say hey Adam put some clothes on no this was their own Instinct so the world would want us to think that modesty is this human construct it's the patriarchy that's forcing us to wear cover ourselves wrong decency tells us decency tells us not to uh go into a grocery store without clothes on decency tells people to dress appropriately when going certain places the reason why there's rules and laws is because mankind sense of decency was being lost and that's when the church itself was leaving the true principles of Christ and that's when modesty died it's not a construct of the patriarchy it's not forced and imposed modesty is not merely a habit I think Maya Angelo said modesty is like a sticker that's placed on me in other words it was something that she didn't feel a part of it was something that was forced on her and that's not true modesty is actually the original nature of humanity that when they were awakened to sin they immediately covered themselves unless we think that nakedness in itself is what God desires in Genesis 3: 211 unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins and clothe them God instituted covering in light of shame in light of experience in light of the loss of innocence in light of the misuse of this power that God instituted clothing and this was a covering for the body coats of skin and clothed them versus the religion so to speak of fig leaves that only covered certain parts now he gives them the appropriate clothing and what is it we say they use the the an innocent lamb they were covered in the this innocence this lamb skin was innocent it was pure it was undefiled it wanted to express humility modesty when God clothed them with the Fig leaves it was almost suggestive right you following me I I if I told you right now don't look over there right some people instinctively go and you ever been at lunch and you're like don't look now but the person to your right right and immediately they look is staring right at you too late kind of our Instinct and so there's a way that they're they're drawn to and there's a lot of lot of back in we're not talking about Christian uh writers or or commentators but the world and those in fashion will say that they intentionally created through shape and zones and clothing to draw the eye and to cause attention when God clothed the man and woman it wasn't in a way to uh to bring your focal point to something but when man instinctively covered himself they didn't really cover themselves but God institutes clothing and God in Revelations chapter 3 counsels the Ley in church age in verse 18 to ey white rment that thou mayest be clothed that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and then in the New Jerusalem and that Eternal condition in Isaiah 52:1 and you'll find throughout the Book of Revelation they were clothed they were clothed they were clothed they were clothed even the lamb himself is clothed and those following him it says awake awake put on thy strength those Z put on thy beautiful garments oh Jerusalem the holy city as a bride adorned dressed prepared purply for her husband for henceforth there shall no more come into Thee the uncircumcised and the unclean put on thy beautiful garments dress yourselves this condition that God desires us to be in wasn't necessarily always originally and then always naked but by through sin God instituted a covering clothing it's the first mention of clothing in writing it's the oldest reference that they would have uh in many ways one of the oldest references to clothing is when God made coats of skin and clothed them and we see in the end in leod deia God is counseling for us to buy clothing to cover the shame of our nakedness and in the finality of things in this eternal condition we're going to have beautiful garments so this is something that there's a theme of this clothing and there's a righteous apparel there's this pure and white linen a a a a a dress a dress scene a fashion in the end that God loves so I think we're doing okay on time I'm not going to be able to finish this morning and I don't want to I know that already we've shared quite a bit and one of the most common statements I hear after I'm done preaching is that was a lot and uh kind of just is that a compliment help me out here they that was a lot that's all we're saying so the question is what's the air of wearing the Garment of the opposite gender only two genders male and female it as we read this let me just let's just make this assumption and there may be some that would want to attack this but the Bible is saying that there is a garment that only a woman wears and a garment that only men wear and that for the man to wear that woman's garment he becomes Abomination and for the woman to wear that man's garment she becomes Abomination so we could just assume that there is a garment that pertains to a man and there's a garment that pertains to a woman the opposite gender ought not to wear it so maybe we'll come back to those specifics later but the question is why is why is that error now follow me very carefully Now by nature and design the male and female are different once they were clothed it was proper to observe the same in the way that they dress amens would help if you believe it if it if it's something you believe for either male or female to dress or act like the other would destroy God's distinction of their nature of their role and of their character effeminacy in a in a man and immodesty in a woman damages the proper image of both that a man is expected to be a certain way a woman's expected to be a certain way when the man begins to have these feminine characteristics and act a certain way it destroys God's original image when the woman begins to assert your and to make herself manly that destroys God's original image now I I'm not wanting to get into differences of uh uh personalities and gray areas and I'm just saying that I'm wanting to you for you to see and to recognize that on its most basic level these distinctions exist even in biology and whether there be a a birth defect [Applause] or a through the fall things that occur in nature that confuse the issue and then with all the politics and all the voices in the world today do you not see why these things become such a huge issue you not see why the devil's trying to cause confusion at the very least to cause our young people maybe even our adults to cause them to consider well maybe this is okay maybe this is a reality and what is it it's deceptive form amen trying to shape the way we view things and the way we think about things and you got to come back to begin I'm not trying to enter into the political debate about the way things are now but the way the things were then there was male and female and there was a nature associated with both it was a proper image of both that God saw in the beginning and it air it would be air for the male or the female to Signal as another gender because it would open the flood of evils it would open the door to more transgression or H uh mixed signals and therefore God hates it it disgusts God for a woman to appear as a man displeases God for a man to appear as a woman it's the same first Thessalonians 5:22 abstain from all appearance of evil that deceptive form that appearance that mislead you it's a trick today in media and entertainment it's that deceptive note it's the hook it's that inter pattern interrupt that we get the most caught by so what it's what draws to this base nature this Fallen Instinct because you got to remember now that we've been defiled now that we've come forth as sinful creatures we're not in our Pure and original form and so God has given a law to govern and to help and to lead the children of Israel through all these pitfalls and these depravities and these desires and when we come into the New Testament there's Grace there's a there's a an affirmation of things that God hates that survives into the New Testament but now we're given the Holy Ghost that's to give us discernment of certain things and to walk a righteous path but there's still this based instinct to where we like things sometimes that are discongruent and it's actually the reason why we like it things that are all the same you know what we call it Bland right we don't want to we don't want to just in uh we want different flavors and textures and notes and when you make a salad we don't just put it in a blender right unless we broke our jaw or I mean we want things in in a smoothie it's not just getting something go ahead and try this just take your uh uh I I just collagen yeah I'm just trying to think of all these things that we use anymore that if we don't take our CG and we're going to die and your bee Po and whatever it is all these things and just take these tasteless supplements and you take instead of getting rid of all these Amazon boxes cut them up put them in your blender with some collagen Right add a little bit of water grass-fed water and and drink it and tell yourself that tastes good and some of you that's the equivalent of what you eat every morning and you keep telling no this is good this is good but you know what you really crave just a different note of something I think I'm going to add cam to my cardboard box because that's what we look for it's things that sometimes Clash that excite us it's things that are discongruent it's the it's the hook in a song it's the change of cord it's the pattern all these things it's part of our human nature to be led astray and so this is what abstain from all appearance of evil it's giving shape deceptive form is what I'm referring to is giving a a shape this perceived Dimension which is against nature actually something that's contrary to the word something that it is not the Divine proportion now I'm going to try to do this in just a few moments and I think we got so much here we're just going to have to cut it short but on this verse a woman not wearing a garment that pertains to a man this is true today all that do so are Abomination to God God has not now that the now that Jesus died on the cross and the blood was shed and and God and the church has been instituted God's not like pants and homosexuality hey I don't care that's God's not that way anymore it was Abomination then it's Abomination now you can argue what that might be but you better accept that there is a conduct there is a dress that God hates and notice just how this is connected with this distinction between male and female 1 Corinthians 11: 8-5 I'm wanting I'm going through this obstain the appearance of evil for a nature to be covered up in a way to deceive because there's another side to this there's another side to this that we're not going to have time to get into but there's a way that it's uncovered to seduce or used to seduce and well so would touch on this in a little bit but notice these principles here 1 Corinthians 11: 8-15 for the man is not of the woman but the woman of the man this difference in Natures neither was the Man created for the woman but the woman for the man and all the Patriarchs said don't say it for this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the Angels nevertheless and all the matriarchs said neither is The Man Without The Woman neither the woman without the man in the Lord for as the woman is of the man even so the man is also by the woman amen man but all things of God so God has arranged it to be so that now we say well the woman was from the man but now Every Man Has Come From a woman and there is the the necessity of that Union to bring forth this proper child the advances in DNA though are startling I don't see how much longer that we can continue to exist as a as a as a the world before God God takes us out of here and destroys these nations as they are scientific advancements are just staggering so it says now in verse 13 judge in yourselves is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered and then he says does not even nature itself teach you that if a man have long hair it is a shame unto him right so there's something in nature telling us that by Nature a man is to be a certain way by Nature a woman a certain way and he's saying let me just ask yourselves is it right is it proper is it seemly is it something that is acceptable does it seem right that a woman would look this way and a man would look this other way but if a woman have long hair it is a glory to her for her hair is given her for a covering without getting into the details of this she recognize right away this is a New Testament scripture that is Paul is teaching on the way a woman should look way a woman should present and he's using this distinction between genders by appearance by feature even their hair there's a brother Bram does make references to uh uh bangs and Beetle haircuts and there's and there's ways that he's identifyed at the very least that it's not just anything goes for the man when it comes to how he Styles his hair lets his hair grow out and it's certainly not up to the churches to come up with this rubric to where we look like we're a u conservative male salon it's like no these are the approved haircuts right and we make sure that everyone just has the same highend tight no this isn't the military right that but there is this acknowledgment that there these things mean something to God Proverbs 11:20 remember how the frow word was one that departs it's crooked it's perverse it's when the true nature of the thing we've lost view of it they that are a froward heart are Abomination to the Lord but such such as are upright in their way are his Delight someone of a perverted disposition their ways are crooked or deceitful is an Abomination to the Lord for a man to dress as a woman is an Abomination a man that dresses as a woman is abomination to God try to create a 21st Christ who just loves it oh look cute Bob no ain't going to work churches can try to be Progressive and there's great there's stories and books and all sorts of uh instances where conservative pastors have had their children come out and they completely shifted their Paradigm to where they now accept endorse and nurture and cultivate queerness as if it's accepted in the word of God and what they've done is they've done they've done a kickback to a culture that hated the person despised the person ruined the person maybe even abused and perverted the person and didn't take accountability for their own shortcomings and didn't recognize that the devil is the one that does this and that there's a hatred for the sin and the one that loves it needs to meet a Christ that loves them that can transform them and this is these things this forwardness this perverseness God now if someone was to hate me or cancel me or say that I'm being hateful I have a responsibility in my conviction and my as I feel my uh commission is to tell you what the Bible says amen thank you Lord and and if I was to face somebody and they were to say try to extract from me my position a a and how do you really feel about it I could be very H comfortable saying this is what the Bible teaches and my responsibility is how can I be Christ with the word that is Christ so that I don't turn it into a blood Force instrument to destroy people or I don't completely take away its use and utility but taking its sharpness out or just outright rejecting it in 1 Timothy chapter 2: 9 and 10 we're about out of time here in like manner also I'm kind of jumping right into the middle of a thought th that women Adorn themselves in modest apparel and it's not just the apparel but with shamefacedness and sobriety get somewhat specific not with broided hair or gold or pearls or costly array but which becometh women professing godliness with good works he gives specifics but then he gives us this metric this measuring stick that one a woman ought to Adorn herself with those garments and with that in a way that is becoming of women that profess godliness I'm only going to open up the door to a future service here but there's two different aspects both in Deuteronomy chap 22:5 the man dressing as a woman the woman dressing as a man and even this scripture here there's two different aspects there's this principle of roles which is headship and hierarchy nature but then there's also this principle of modesty that Timothy's referring to here and that has to do with sexual attraction so that to dress with sobriety this this soundness of mind this self-control there's this meekness to it it's subdued the shamefacedness means that you're not dressing to draw attention to yourself that there is still some sense of shame or some bashfulness or blush knowing what these parts are and knowing how person is made that there is some sort of shame or bashfulness there is and this word shamefacedness means there is a regard and a respect for others the the Battle of rights to where people want to have the right to dress a certain way and not be treated a certain way and there's a lot of nastiness says well if you're going to dress like that I'm going to treat you like what you look like and people just think they can treat anybody how they want and it's just this free-for-all and it's it's it's pale it's a conglomeration of color and everything else it's it's disgusting and nobody's right in that Arena but it sure seems like it would be nice if somebody shows up at at a grocery store dressed a certain way that you could they could be charged with sexual harassment just for the way that they're dressed it's not the society we live in anymore but there's no shamefacedness that out of respect for you I'm going to dress a certain way out of regard for others I'm going to be a certain way it's one of the reasons why you should be very careful and watch for how you would dress and act in front of your children at home in the privacy of your home so that you're showing respect to your children so that they never become so desensitized to that that when you're at somebody else's house around somebody else's parents that there's not this sense of Shame and blush towards like that's not right that's improper to be shamefaced it means it's not appealing to the lust of the eyes not dressing to be attractive or desirable so there's this element that we're going to have to get into later that deals with these garments that pertain to a woman or a man there's a way that a woman could dress and even a man could dress that in other words it's being done to try to seduce to uh encourage certain feelings and even in the garments the way that they would be worn it it's too fold because let me just say this cuz I'm I'm not trying to hide anything I don't believe that a sister should wear a garment that pertains to a man our Prophet taught what that was slacks and pants I don't think that a man should wear garments that pertain to a woman we shouldn't be out there wearing I don't care how Scottish you think you are don't wear a skirt right there certain things that a man should not do or wear a dress and they're trying to just mix that up completely mix it up say hey I'm comfortable in my own skin I can dress however I want there is a manner of dress which confuses the gender genders and swaps them or signals that God hates and if your argument is that a garment that pertains to a man they say well there's man pants and there's women pants so I'm just going to wear women pants well you know where you transgress is in the shamefacedness because it's going to draw attention to your figure well then I'll just wear man pants then you're going to transgress in the principle of roles and that's why there's a phrase pants in the family that's why a man who's gay will marry a woman and she's called his beard right I'm not joking because she's a front the beard a man has a beard not a woman so there's this it even goes to facial hair and the way they wear your hair it's all signaling it has something to do with rolls hierarchy nature or it has something to do with this modesty and sexual attraction something to think about but to be modest is to be well arranged women Adorn themselves in modest apparel it's not just the apparel itself but there's a shamefacedness and sobriety well arranged seamly is what it means in a good appearance that's suitable to those that would profess godliness suited to be seemly suited for this purpose or character when one has a sense of modesty they are restrained by a sense of propriety and humility they're moderate even in their self-regard they're moderate in the way that they would present themselves so it's to not cause another person to stumble or to be offended Genesis 3:16 as I'm just wanting to touch on this the man and the woman they're different natures and to be adorned in this modest apparel and it's this it's suited for their character and their nature in Genesis 3:16 unto the woman he said thy desire last part thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee a garment that pertains to a woman identifies a woman as a woman a garment that pertains to a man identifies a man as a man a change in dress confuses the roles I know that sounds maybe Antiquated in vintage or whatever it is but sometimes vintage is more expensive and more valuable more desirable but a change in dress can change the role it's a sin of the pride of life that instead of a woman dressing in a way that indicates her status and and I don't mean socially politically or economically but just she is a woman thy desire shall be to thy husband he shall rule over thee doesn't create a domineering dominating uh dictator but it does establish headship as Christ is to the church and as the church would dress herself in subjection to Christ and be arrayed in his word and to dress in a way that's complimentary the church itself spiritually is array in a way that's complimentary to Christ a woman dress is in a way that's complimentary to the man and the man also complimentary to the woman and notice again how this fits this call to modesty or holiness fits with this nature of the man and the woman in their relationship to one another 1 Peter 3: 1-6 my closing scripture likewise ye wives be in subjection subjection to your own husbands that if any obey not the word they would also they also May without the word be won by the conversation of the wives the way she lives for woman has a husband that does not believe the word if she can be a woman real lady and she gets up in the morning and says you're a good for nothing drunker husband and she puts her pants on and goes out and digs ditches to make a living your husband's going to like that arrangement for quite a while isn't he keep digging ditches honey can I buy you a new shovel a new pair of pants you want to wear my boots right sounds like a good a a a good arrangement for a drunkard but a woman who's a real woman and serves her husband and lives like a lady that's the will win without her words that's what can win a man while they behold your chased conversation couple with fear who's adorning what this woman this woman who is in subjection to her husband this is describing a woman's role and her nature and her subjection to her husband whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of platting the hair and a wearing of gold or putting on of apparel it is speaking to a married woman and who is she trying to impress we do realize that women dress for other women maybe more than they do for men anymore but let it be the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptible even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit which is in the sight of God of great price the things that God loves the things that God values for after this manner in Old Time the holy women also who trusted in God notice Adorn themselves being in subject under their own husbands the requirement of Deuteronomy 22:5 is not that God hates pentalon or God hates britches no God hates a woman that would dress as a man and God hates a man that would dress as a woman because there's a distinction in nature and that the woman should be in subjection to the man and the man ought to be loving and caring and a protector a a and bold for his wife and it says here that a woman adorns herself being in subject to her husband that the way that a woman dress is for the purpose is identifying as a woman and that fashion and the world would want to change that and it's all a matter of denying your role and your place in interrupting the proper relationship and Harmony you'd have not only with God but also your husband the same goes for men even as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord whose daughter as you are as long as you do well and are not afraid with any amazement we cannot disconnect the requirement of we cannot disconnect God hating those that transgress Deuteronomy 225 from his original design his original form the way that God originally intended things to be and it comes back to Nature being complimentary maybe I say this in a joking way but nobody wants to wake up in the morning and get ready for work and say honey have you seen my work boots and she says oh I'm wearing them I've got to I I I've got to do and now there may be things that we share but we don't share our Old Spice body wash right there's things that are for a man there's things that are for a woman and that's the way that God wants it some friends of ours got married here recently and we're out of town at the wedding and found a really neat card to give the the friends of ours who were getting married and Elizabeth was just getting ready to write in it and all of a sudden I don't know if it's one of the kids notic and said Mom that says Mr and Mister like man that was a really cool card could we just write s on that that you know the other one it's like you don't even you wouldn't even think about it anymore right that's in congruent I mean if somebody wanted you to bake a cake and it would say Mis and M Mister you'd like typo right they forgot to put the misss they forgot the S but that's where we live anymore things are so confused and listen if we could be debating about how many genders there are and whether or not one has a right to do this and whether not one has a right to that and CH change gender and be able to have children all those different things seems like a really small thing like you're arguing about pants you're really quibbling about whether or not a woman cuts her hair it's like we got bigger fish to fry over here we're trying to figure out just how many genders there are and letting everybody be who they want to be and there's a way that the whole thing has been done as kind of a distraction from God's heart and the things we value remember life is the process of determining value in order to simplify your lives we want to know what God values we want to know what God loves we want to know his attitude towards things so I can simplify my life to that Brothers you can come to your instrument let me just I'm going to skip to the last slide brother John is the the statement from the church age book I think it's important for me to express this hundreds of quotes that I could read and if I could say this that the law is full of requirements as we already read that you you have things you can't mix your walls in your in your Linens but God never said that was an Abomination to him if there's a scripture that gets close I haven't found it and I may have to adopt another Paradigm I guess if I found that the word was very clear on something but I'm just trying to call to mind that there's things that were prescribed in the Old Testament that once we come into the New Testament circumcision is no longer bound by requirement the abstaining from meats and the dietary laws that govern the Jews are explicitly said look these things don't carry over into this new Covenant because there it wasn't there was things that God said were foul or detestable or abominable because it was the unclean nature of the thing but now under the New Testament there is things that you could that you would bless and you could receive and and you wouldn't the only reason why you wouldn't is because it would stumble somebody else it's not according to God's original nature but then they come into the New Testament we find that Paul is specifically pulling things out of the law in reaffirming them that this is not the law this is the law of God this is the nature of God this is the law of life and the spirit this is this is what governs us as Christians and they come into the New Testament and that's why we can stand very solidly in the New Testament about God's attitude towards sexual perversion God's attitude towards certain ways that men and women would present themselves and and God's attitude towards certain things did not change because of the Cross and I believe in the same way that Paul preached a gospel at the inauguration of the Christian church as the gospel turned to the Jews from the Jews to the Gentiles that Paul was affirming things in God's word for for the church that brother brandham comes in our day in this 20th century as we lead into the 21st century and tells us the things that pertain to God's mind in his heart am there was a time when there would it wouldn't even necessarily be there was things that we did not have to consider could you imagine let's just go back to 1642 and say Frederick is it sin to drive an electric vehicle and he say it just what's an electric vehicle tell me and he well there is there is a there's a life we're living today that if a somebody in the world there somebody this real genuine born again Christian from other centuries would be like you guys are mad [Music] we can say well if it wasn't in the original then we don't want to do it now and so we we got to walk everywhere we go and you can't wear hookas because those didn't exist you got to find a genuine leather sandals right and well that's not the picture that's not the painting So then how does the picture get painted in a way that pleases God what are those things that are Abomination what are those things that are foul and loathsome to God it's not eating cornfed beef right that might be a wise dietary decision on your part when it comes to genetic makeup and the way what your gut agrees with but God's not going to judge you if you're eating cornfed beef I'm going to get a quote tomorrow where brother brandham said something about cornfed [Music] beef so I I I this is what a point I was trying to make and I I'm sorry I I've just wandered into a maybe a rabbit Trail brother Brown was very precise about women wearing pants cutting hair men dressing a certain way their hair even one of the things that's always been some somewhat peculiar to me is men wearing shorts and and the history of it and the requirement that men shouldn't do it and you realize it's for a reason what is it that what is it that he was identifying at the time that might we might be able to bring back to some principle in scripture and the natur of God not to turn shorts into Abomination but the man wearing them right I'm just saying think about that what is it that comes back to in the word of God so brother bam says as he's writing this take a look around examine the people as they walk by and the multitudes you see can you pick out those that have the appearance of Christians watch how they dress watch how they act hear what they say see where they go surely the there ought to be some real evidence of the new birth amongst all those we see go by but few there be yet today the fundamental churches are telling us they have millions saved and even spirit filled spirit filled spirit filled can you call women spirit filled who go around with frizzy bobbed hair Eliza was having problem with frizzy hair this morning I was like oh she's going to get it when I get to that it's not bed by God grace but she was like Dad my hair is Frizzy what do I do it's like well just use my conditioner honey frizzy bobbed hair shorts and slacks halters and briefs all painted up like Jezebel that's a question can you call them spirit filled and this to me is the kicker CU he's not answering that maybe it's rhetorical if these are adorned in monest app Peril has become with Christian women I would hate to think what it would be like if I had to witness a display of in modesty right woo yes here we are 21st century that's this this is why we are where we are today is what moved the needle when men and women could act and dress like they did in the world people in churches thought we could move even closer and still be different so we don't move the needle and say Well they're just wearing uh bikinis in the world and they're just wearing this and showing this and this and they're dressing this way and they're saying this and doing this then as long as we're in this space and a lot of the conservative Evangelical religious women that are praying for Trump a and so happy with with the the way America's going and we're going to be a Christian Nation they look they they look the part of what the Bible says was wrong it it violates scriptural principles of modesty and the roles of a man and a woman in the difference of nature but yet they they feel they're better off because they identify as a woman in their blue jeans and their Pearl buttons Pearl snapped western shirt and a ball cap on and cowboy boots and they're real Trad wife they're a real woman because they're comparing it to to the woman who became a man who has a beard who's expecting a baby with the woman that's a man and and whatever it is and they feel like they're more women they are not in the image that God wants a woman to be in don't let the devil use a deceptive form to make us feel that as long as we're wearing this and wearing that and not as like the world is that we're somehow Spirit appropriately representing [Music] godliness this is the Bible truth this is the message truth this is what we ought to be teaching our children [Music] God bless you let's stand and if you could just pray with me let's bow our heads in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're just going to close the service now and just transition from here we go into a youth meeting Lord and many that are here are going to go to lunch and fellowship maybe even talk about these things and Lord I I just pray that I have no knowledge that anyone here would even be confused or uh resistant or reluctant to not believe this principle of Deuteronomy chapter 22:5 Lord we see here in this church that men dress as men and women dressed as ladies and that there is this image at the very least that of this modesty and Holiness to wear to dress in uh appropriate attire and Lord to the extent that there'd be anyone here who wrestles with this or maybe recently saved or whatever the circumstance may be they find that this blurring of Distinction in dress and maybe they dressed in a way that was uh forward and perverse in a garment that pertained as we would say in the message that pants or slacks or shorts or whatever it might be and and it's reminiscent or triggers this sense of legalism and bondage and hatred Lord I trust that they could take this in a spirit that it's intended that we do not preach a clo Clos line gospel and we do not take the responsibility for making sure that everyone dresses a certain way but I do believe that the word has to be preached in the way that it was given so that the person can examine themselves and Paul even said just judge yourselves is this seemly is this appropriate is there any impropriety in this does not nature itself teach us that men and women are different and Lord does it not follow that according to the word of God because their Natures are different that their dress ought to demonstrate the same Lord yes it is balancing as we didn't have time to get into the the principle of modesty and sexual attraction Lord may we recognize that there's a way that we dress as men and women that shows respect to the other gender that shows respect in regard to other people Lord it would be oh God I just feel like there's just a a tsunami of emotions and feelings and thoughts that I'm struck with in light of the debates and challenges that we face today in school and and the social economic climate and all that Lord that if we could just if we could have somehow just stayed with the word of God we wouldn't have these issues today so I pray that you cause us to be those throwback Christians the real vintage believer to catch your heart to know your mind and to see your way that we can not transgress in these Abominations not so that we could be sanctimonious and somehow signal to others that we have virtue but that we could be differential and respectful to others but then also be a Christ that others see and would know there is a Highway a holy way bless our people today may you be the Difference Maker in this sermon I pray in the name of Lord Jesus Christ amen
