[0:00] If you'd like to jot this title down,
[0:01] day of reckoning, so you keep in mind
[0:03] that we are looking at a particular day
[0:06] and a particular time on this subject of
[0:09] judgment and rewards. And I I say this
[0:13] at the outset as I've looked at this
[0:14] subject um there there's so much that's
[0:17] related to not because the Bible
[0:19] emphasizes it so often and there's a lot
[0:21] of a lot of deep teaching on the subject
[0:24] either whether it be in the message or
[0:25] the Bible. There's not a there's not one
[0:27] sermon spent on it by brother Brandham.
[0:29] There's not uh you know several
[0:31] instances or scriptures packed together
[0:33] that's unpacking what it means to uh
[0:35] stand before the judgment seat of Christ
[0:36] and what kind of rewards you're going to
[0:38] be receiving. But you'll find that it's
[0:40] in the Bible from the beginning to end.
[0:42] It's in the message. It's just little
[0:43] statements and references to this. And
[0:46] in certain places there's different
[0:48] terminologies and images used. And so I
[0:51] just want to say it at the outset that
[0:53] today I'm I'm just I feel in my heart
[0:54] just such liberty just to continue to uh
[0:57] maybe re-emphasize some things but in a
[0:59] way of just trying to uh help us to
[1:02] appreciate the fact that there are
[1:04] rewards that brother said too little
[1:05] time is spent on laboring for and that
[1:08] these are things that we ought to value
[1:10] and put more emphasis on. So that's
[1:11] really my heart's desire is to encourage
[1:14] you through this and share with you from
[1:16] the word of God um this principle that
[1:18] seems to be in so many different places
[1:20] and because it's there maybe we can uh
[1:22] be more diligent to pursue these eternal
[1:25] rewards that are available to us and
[1:27] then to also also be encouraged as we
[1:30] labor for Christ. And as we've already
[1:33] ministered on this subject for a few
[1:34] other services I do encourage um those
[1:37] who consider this their home church. I
[1:38] really encourage you to go back into um
[1:41] the archives and listen to the other
[1:42] services. I feel that it would give
[1:44] greater context if you've only heard one
[1:46] here or one there. If you only hear this
[1:48] one, um if I'm not going to force you uh
[1:51] to go back, I'm not going to look at the
[1:52] analytics. Go, hm, looks like Glendel's
[1:54] not streaming this week. Um but if you
[1:57] could go back and listen to it for your
[1:58] own good, especially if you have
[1:59] questions. I think the other sermons
[2:01] we've already ministered on it will kind
[2:03] of give the context if there's some
[2:04] questions because in just one service
[2:06] you might seem to be leaning a little
[2:08] heavy in one area and I want to stay
[2:10] balanced in the word of God. Now in
[2:12] Romans chapter 14 10 and 12. I'd like to
[2:15] start here. We use this on Wednesday
[2:17] night. I look at verse 12. I want to
[2:19] keep verse 10 up there because I'm going
[2:20] to refer to it. Says, "So then every one
[2:22] of us shall give account of himself to
[2:24] God." On Wednesday night, we introduced
[2:26] two related concepts, very closely
[2:28] related words could actually maybe be
[2:30] used interchangeably in some instances,
[2:33] but the concepts were responsibility,
[2:35] which was our emphasis and title
[2:36] Wednesday night, and accountability.
[2:39] Accountability was my working title for
[2:41] this service. uh God dealt with me more
[2:43] a day of reckoning because I've been
[2:44] studying on the timing of judgment, the
[2:46] time of this judgment and it just seemed
[2:48] like the Lord kind of zeroed us in on
[2:50] this uh maybe to begin to look at the
[2:52] timing of everything but this
[2:53] responsibility and accountability
[2:55] and I think using these subjects and
[2:57] this is how God has dealt with me in
[2:59] this way. You look at something that's
[3:01] you see in the Bible from the beginning
[3:02] to end and you ask yourself where do you
[3:04] start? And what you don't want to do is
[3:05] just print out all the instances in the
[3:07] Bible where it says crowns or all the
[3:08] instances of rewards and just turn a
[3:11] page and read quote after quote and
[3:12] scripture after scripture because you
[3:14] just don't word search. You don't just
[3:15] look for uh like terminology. You really
[3:18] look for the inspiration of the word of
[3:20] God and God inspired these two
[3:22] particular principles to give context to
[3:24] the subject of judgment and rewards.
[3:26] It's kind of a way to approach it that
[3:28] we can start uh nailing down certain
[3:30] things in scripture. And so these
[3:32] eternal rewards are referenced um that
[3:36] are available to the believers. Brother
[3:37] Bam uses that phrase are a theme that's
[3:38] throughout scripture. And there's places
[3:41] where you hear it and you might think,
[3:42] "Oh, that pertains to this life."
[3:44] There's places where you hear it and you
[3:45] think, "Oh, that pertains to the gift of
[3:47] eternal life." And sometimes they aren't
[3:49] just related to this life. Sometimes
[3:51] they're not just related to eternal
[3:52] life, but there are the eternal rewards
[3:55] that God has promised the believer who
[3:56] serves him. And there's different
[3:58] references that are just it's just said
[4:01] uh even as the scripture says so every
[4:04] one of us shall give account of himself
[4:05] to God. It's just said as a matter of
[4:08] fact without any explanation as to what
[4:10] that might be. And so there are
[4:12] references and illusions to uh rewards
[4:15] and to the judgment for rewards is
[4:17] almost just foregone conclusions. Yep,
[4:19] there's rewards. Yep, there's crowns.
[4:20] Yep, there's going to be a time when
[4:21] we're judged uh even as believers to be
[4:24] examined for what our reward will be.
[4:25] And so there's a lot to unpack and today
[4:28] I want to I'm just going to continue on
[4:30] doing that. And so um I just again I
[4:33] think responsibility and accountability
[4:34] are means to look at the truth of
[4:37] rewards. And so Wednesday night we
[4:39] defined responsibility this way. The
[4:41] condition of being responsible or the
[4:43] fact that you are accountable or have to
[4:45] answer for something. And so as we read
[4:47] here in Matthew chapter 25, there was a
[4:49] responsibility given uh to these these
[4:52] servants and they were responsible for
[4:54] five talents. They were responsible for
[4:56] two talents. They were responsible for
[4:58] the one talent. And that means they had
[5:00] ownership of it and had stewardship over
[5:02] it. And therefore, this was their uh
[5:04] their responsibility. They were told
[5:06] that this is what they were responsible
[5:08] for. And so when Paul says, "So then
[5:10] every one of us," there verse 12, Romans
[5:12] chapter 14:12, and then I want to read
[5:15] verse 10. He says, "So then every one of
[5:16] us shall give account of himself to
[5:18] God." Because of verse 10.
[5:21] It's because of verse 10. He's saying
[5:23] that every one of us shall give account
[5:24] to God. And he says uh or or verse 10 is
[5:27] built on this principle of hey why do
[5:29] you judge your brother? Why do you set
[5:31] it not thy brother? Why do you despise
[5:33] your brother? Why do you uh resent your
[5:36] brother? Why do you judge your brother?
[5:37] Why do we have these attitudes of him
[5:40] who does this and those who think that's
[5:41] a sin you judge him and then those who
[5:43] do it look at the one who does it and
[5:45] despises them. Think about what he's
[5:47] talking about, right? There's some
[5:48] people who feel the liberty to do
[5:50] something and they go, "Oh, I can't
[5:52] believe you go to San Diego. Don't you
[5:53] know that place is going to sink?"
[5:55] Right? And they and they and they judge
[5:57] you and then the person that goes and
[5:59] looks at the person who won't go and
[6:00] they despise them, right? And they kind
[6:03] of both look at each other. He's saying,
[6:04] "HEY, DON'T YOU guys realize
[6:07] that you're going to have to answer for
[6:08] your attitude? You have to answer for
[6:10] the way you treat one another? You have
[6:12] to answer for all these uh ideas that
[6:14] you get about one another that aren't
[6:15] even word- based in those things." So,
[6:17] he's saying, "Hey, he's really kind of
[6:18] trying to drill down. You know, I just
[6:20] don't know why I picked San Diego, but
[6:22] it's just one of those things. Maybe
[6:24] Sister Julie, I know you guys are going
[6:25] to San Diego. I I'll just say it for
[6:27] your sake. It's just kind of it's what I
[6:29] do for brother Michael to keep him
[6:30] humble,
[6:32] and it's not hard."
[6:39] He says, "So why do you have these
[6:40] attitude towards one another? For we
[6:42] shall all stand before the bema, the
[6:45] judgment seat of Christ.
[6:47] Like if you realize that one day for all
[6:49] your little attitudes, all your little
[6:50] judgments, all your peculiar thoughts
[6:52] and those things that one day you'd have
[6:54] to answer for them, maybe you'd be a
[6:55] little bit more circumspect
[6:57] about them. And so Paul is saying it in
[7:00] such a way to really challenge the
[7:02] believer because the believer says,
[7:03] "Hey, I know I'm justified. Never did it
[7:05] in the first place. I know that my soul
[7:07] will not have to answer for sin on that
[7:09] day because it's been judged already and
[7:11] I have eternal life. And Paul is saying,
[7:13] if you ever thought for a moment that
[7:16] because your soul is justified, you
[7:18] still won't answer for the what you do
[7:19] in your flesh, think again.
[7:22] And all the believers were like,
[7:24] right, I thought I could sing justified,
[7:27] right? All the way to white throne
[7:28] judgment. But there's going to be a
[7:29] moment where you have to stand before
[7:30] the judgment seat of Christ to answer
[7:32] for these things. And so it says that we
[7:35] are going to be judged according to our
[7:38] responsibility.
[7:39] Whether or not we have faithfully
[7:41] discharged our duty, whether or not
[7:42] we've been faithful to not only the
[7:44] tenants of Christianity and to the
[7:46] nature and spirit of Christ, but the
[7:47] very specific things that God has asked
[7:49] us to do. So he says we must give
[7:52] account of himself, the individual.
[7:55] Every man must bear his own burden, what
[7:57] he's been laden with, what he's been
[7:58] tasked to carry, whatever his
[8:00] responsibility is. Uh there's things
[8:02] that a man will answer for within the
[8:04] family that the wife will not have to
[8:05] answer for, but she will have to answer
[8:07] for things herself. There's things in a
[8:09] church that the pastor answers for, the
[8:11] congregation won't, but there's things
[8:12] that the congregation will. And there's
[8:14] we all have different levels of
[8:16] accountability. But that's what it's
[8:17] being said is we have to answer or give
[8:20] explanation for our words and for our
[8:22] deeds. If I could put it this way, for
[8:24] our character.
[8:24] Amen.
[8:25] They have to answer and give reason. and
[8:27] and this logos this reasoning in the
[8:30] account of a judgment to explain or
[8:32] justify yourself before the bema the
[8:34] judgment seat of Christ. So
[8:36] accountability is defined this way. It
[8:39] means answerable.
[8:41] Literally liable to be called to
[8:44] account. Notice when you are when you
[8:46] are accountable that means at any moment
[8:48] you could be asked why did you do this?
[8:50] What were your reasons for doing it? You
[8:52] have to answer for this. You're the one
[8:54] that had the responsibility. Therefore,
[8:55] you're the one that's held accountable.
[8:57] And when a person has the
[8:58] responsibility, accountability means
[9:00] that if it doesn't get done, they're the
[9:02] ones that have to pay the price even if
[9:04] they had asked somebody else to do it
[9:07] because they're the one that is
[9:08] answerable for it. They're the ones that
[9:10] are accountable. So accountability is
[9:12] being liable to be called to account. It
[9:14] is being held responsible for whether if
[9:17] I could put it this way in the context
[9:18] I'm meaning it. We are going to be held
[9:20] responsible for whether we performed our
[9:22] duty and how we performed our duty.
[9:24] Right? It's not so much that it's just
[9:26] uh the the once we if we got it done, it
[9:29] didn't matter how we did it. No, it
[9:30] matters even to God how we do it.
[9:33] Matter of fact, as we'll touch on here
[9:34] in a moment, there's certain things we
[9:35] can do with the wrong motive and we
[9:37] haven't done it.
[9:38] It doesn't count.
[9:41] And so it is being responsible for
[9:44] whether we have done what we're asked to
[9:46] do or whether or how we fulfilled our
[9:48] responsibility. So it in looking at this
[9:50] word accountability
[9:52] uh there is going to be a moment that
[9:53] Paul is saying every one of us shall
[9:55] give account of himself. We shall all
[9:58] stand before the judgment seat of
[9:59] Christ. Paul just in his writing to them
[10:02] uh I don't I don't say casually but he
[10:04] just refers to something so definitively
[10:07] that maybe some of us would be like
[10:09] could you tell me a little bit more
[10:10] about what that is? Is that is that
[10:12] white throne or when is this? But he
[10:14] just says it as a matter of fact. And so
[10:16] he's referring to a moment of
[10:18] accountability.
[10:19] There is uh the time when you'll have to
[10:22] be answerable for your conduct. And if
[10:25] there isn't a moment of accountability,
[10:27] is there any real true responsibility?
[10:30] If if you can't be held at account for
[10:32] it, if it's I if I'm not responsible for
[10:35] filling my neighbor's gas tank or making
[10:37] sure they're charging their electric
[10:38] vehicle, uh you know, if I'm not
[10:40] responsible for it, I can't be held
[10:42] accountable for it. But if I'm given the
[10:44] responsibility but there's no
[10:46] accountability for it then it's easy
[10:48] just to like nah you know it'll charge
[10:50] itself right or they can get gas another
[10:52] time it's very easy when you know
[10:54] there's no accountability to not fulfill
[10:58] your responsibility so it becomes that
[10:59] inspiration for responsibility
[11:02] and so that's where I get my my title
[11:05] day of reckoning
[11:07] because there is it's our time to answer
[11:09] if I could put it that way
[11:10] your your day of answering our time of
[11:13] answer and it will be a time or a moment
[11:14] of accountability where our life's work
[11:17] even in its totality and even the
[11:18] specific instances that make up that
[11:20] body of work which is called our
[11:21] testimony which is reflective of our
[11:23] character there is going to be a day of
[11:26] reckoning
[11:27] right
[11:27] the sermon hear ye him brother Bram says
[11:29] and Christian you're going to be
[11:31] responsible before God after you
[11:35] accepted Christ as your savior for your
[11:37] life god is going to hold you
[11:41] accountable
[11:43] I thought the way that he worded it was
[11:45] so fitting because he says, "Christian,
[11:48] you're going to be responsible before
[11:50] God for your life
[11:52] after you've accepted him after you've
[11:55] received the Holy Spirit." He says,
[11:56] "You're going to be responsible for your
[11:58] life. God is going to hold you
[12:00] accountable." So, there has to be this
[12:02] moment of accountability, this day of
[12:04] reckoning when you will be held
[12:05] accountable. I I don't know if it needs
[12:07] to be said, but I'll say this that
[12:09] there's no question that the law of the
[12:11] harvest still applies within our daily
[12:13] lives and within this life. There's
[12:15] sacrifices you make that God will reward
[12:17] you in this life and in the life to
[12:19] come. There's things that take place in
[12:21] this life. And we suffer the loss
[12:22] because of certain things. And so, we're
[12:24] not completely disregarding any
[12:26] application to this time now. The
[12:27] correction of God, the chastisement of
[12:29] God, and we hope to get into that a
[12:31] little bit, how God is using that for a
[12:33] means and for a particular end. But
[12:35] we're going to be held responsible.
[12:37] Brother Bamman, in the sermon, the seed
[12:38] is not heir with the shock. Just a very
[12:40] straightforward, simple statement. And
[12:42] we will be accountable for what we do
[12:44] with the word of God.
[12:47] To those of us who have received it, to
[12:49] those of us who have heard it, we even
[12:50] know there's a class of people that
[12:52] though they live good lives, if they've
[12:54] heard the truth, brother Bam says
[12:55] they're condemned at white throne
[12:56] judgment
[12:57] because they didn't receive it. They
[12:58] didn't have the right attitude towards
[13:00] him. So, we will be accountable for what
[13:02] we do with the word of God. If I could
[13:05] say this as uh maybe not so much as a
[13:07] caveat, but just as a qualifier, I I'm
[13:09] not attempting I'm not going to attempt
[13:11] to give perfect clarity uh on every
[13:13] detail about rewards and the day of
[13:15] reckoning and these different things.
[13:17] But I want us to understand the general
[13:18] principle. I I to me just even for
[13:21] myself personally uh there's this real
[13:24] hunger and desire just to be able to
[13:25] make sense of everything a and place
[13:27] what the reward is and even look at the
[13:29] different crowns that are mentioned in
[13:30] scripture and say oh well you have this
[13:32] crown and then you have this crown and
[13:34] you have this crown and you have these
[13:35] different crowns and is one for this and
[13:37] one for that you look at the different
[13:38] rewards through the seven church ages
[13:40] each age having a different reward and
[13:42] how brother Bham taught it you there's
[13:44] this maybe desire to try to make
[13:46] everything fit in a very neat and clean
[13:47] picture but God often times s doesn't
[13:50] want it to fit perfectly.
[13:52] He wants faith to kind of be the thing
[13:54] that fills in very vividly the truth of
[13:56] it.
[13:57] If we could explain it, maybe we rob you
[13:59] of the beauty that faith gives a picture
[14:01] when you see it by faith. And it's much
[14:03] more vivid and much more clear when we
[14:05] can see it by faith and not just because
[14:06] we can explain it every detail. But I do
[14:09] want you to uh I do want to I want you
[14:11] to understand at least the general
[14:13] principle to this morning of a day of
[14:15] reckoning for our character. And I'll
[14:19] say I think I mentioned this on
[14:20] Wednesday night. It really I feel like
[14:22] I'm going really really slow today. So I
[14:23] apologize. There's uh it puts into
[14:26] perspective a lot of different things.
[14:28] And there's things that we might say,
[14:29] well, what does it matter doing this?
[14:30] And what does it matter doing that? And
[14:32] why do we have to do this and why do we
[14:33] have to do that? This gives perspective.
[14:35] Amen.
[14:36] Because there may be things as
[14:37] Christians you do not do and you do not
[14:39] want to do and and you don't do and it
[14:41] doesn't rob you of your salvation. It
[14:43] won't take away the gift of eternal life
[14:44] that you have. You can't break the seal
[14:46] and God takes something away from you.
[14:48] And so maybe there's not the loss of
[14:50] salvation, but it helps you to
[14:52] understand why we ought to labor because
[14:54] he's promised us more benefits and
[14:56] blessings when we make those sacrifices
[14:59] and we do those things that please him.
[15:01] I want to start with this quote from
[15:03] church age. You say start. Yeah. Yeah.
[15:05] This is where I want to start this
[15:07] morning. Chapter five of the church age
[15:08] book. Uh we read it Wednesday night, but
[15:11] I want to start with this because I want
[15:12] to start specifically look at the reward
[15:14] that God gives to his messengers or to
[15:17] we'd say the messengers or prophets or
[15:19] maybe those that handle the word of God.
[15:21] So if we can see this very clearly,
[15:23] maybe it'll help us to understand how it
[15:25] applies to others. Says, "Yes, I can see
[15:27] that God is going to give a special
[15:29] reward to his messengers who have
[15:31] faithfully discharged the responsibility
[15:34] he has placed upon them." So God gives
[15:35] them a responsibility and they
[15:37] faithfully discharge it this way.
[15:39] Receiving the revelation of the word for
[15:41] that age and faithfully preached it in
[15:43] their day and lived what they preached.
[15:45] So he's saying if they have received the
[15:47] revelation of the word for that age and
[15:48] faithfully preached in their day and
[15:50] lived what they preached, they will
[15:52] receive a great reward. Brother Brandham
[15:55] even indicates this and we see it
[15:56] indicated in his own ministry that
[15:58] because he had chosen the harder way
[16:00] that a great portion of heaven awaited
[16:02] him and this was because as a messenger
[16:04] he had caught the revelation for the
[16:06] word of his day faithfully preached it
[16:07] lived what he preached and therefore
[16:09] brother says they give a special reward
[16:12] he uses another phrase a great reward
[16:16] wasn't to be the messenger
[16:17] the reward wasn't to receive the
[16:19] revelation the re reward wasn't the
[16:21] power of that revelation to live the
[16:23] word and to preach it, but rather it's
[16:25] something in addition to those things.
[16:28] And in 1 Corinthians chapter 3, we'll
[16:31] read verses 6 to15. And we might we
[16:33] might work in a couple other scriptures
[16:35] as we read through this, but 1
[16:37] Corinthians chapter 3 6-15. I want you
[16:40] to see how Paul approaches this very
[16:42] same concept. Brother Ram says, "Those
[16:45] who faithfully discharge the
[16:46] responsibility receive a special reward
[16:49] or a great reward." He says,"I have
[16:51] planted, Apollos had watered. I have
[16:54] planted, Apollos watered, but God gave
[16:56] the increase." So then neither is he
[16:59] that planteth, that's Paul, anything.
[17:01] Neither he that waterth, that's Apollos,
[17:04] but God that giveth the increase. So it
[17:06] still all goes to God. This is the
[17:08] attitude of the labor. The labor never
[17:10] waters and then says, "I watered. What
[17:12] are you going to give me for watering?"
[17:13] Right? He just This is God that gives
[17:15] the increase because this is his
[17:17] planting. You are his vineyard. You are
[17:19] his buildings. He says, [snorts] "Now he
[17:20] that planteth, Paul, and he that waterth
[17:23] are one." That means they have the same
[17:24] purpose.
[17:25] That though one does something and
[17:27] another does something else, one is
[17:29] planting in one's water. And you say,
[17:30] "Well, man, if it never got planted,
[17:32] what does it mean to the water?" Or if
[17:33] it never if it got planted and it's not
[17:35] watered, what does it mean if it
[17:36] planted? Nobody's trying to measure or
[17:38] weigh who had the greater
[17:39] responsibility. They both are looking to
[17:41] God who gives the increase. And
[17:43] recognizing that we have the same
[17:46] purpose, not not to grow our churches,
[17:48] not to grow the number of people we
[17:50] baptize. Paul was even pretty open about
[17:52] the fact that he baptized none of you
[17:53] except, right? He wasn't trying to get
[17:56] notches in his belt for these things. He
[17:58] just looked at it and said, "We're all
[17:59] serving the same purpose." So whether
[18:01] this person does this or whether that
[18:03] person does that, our goal at the end of
[18:04] the day is to reach God's elect. Our
[18:06] goal at the end of the day is to fill up
[18:07] the word of God. And so he says those
[18:09] that labor, he says, are one. And then
[18:12] he says, in every man shall receive his
[18:15] own reward according to his own labor.
[18:18] I I don't believe it's a it it it's used
[18:20] as a contrary or but he's saying though
[18:23] we are serving one purpose. And uh we
[18:27] are going to have to answer for our own
[18:30] labor. A man shall receive his own
[18:32] reward according to his own labor. He's
[18:35] going to receive in proportion to how he
[18:38] labored.
[18:39] We catch that. He's going to receive
[18:41] according to how he labored.
[18:44] Now, if I could just cover some key
[18:46] principles at this point. I think these
[18:48] are very key for us to uh to to think
[18:51] about. It's God that graciously
[18:55] grants these rewards.
[18:57] I I I want to emphasize it here because
[18:59] I've in the beginning I think some of my
[19:01] emphasis was a lot on the difference
[19:02] between a gift and a reward. And so
[19:05] that's a necessary distinction. But then
[19:07] I don't want us to tip over too heavy on
[19:09] the other side where we begin to think
[19:11] that God owes it to us as a debt.
[19:13] Amen.
[19:14] It's God that promised them.
[19:16] So it's his it's his promise. To me,
[19:19] it's one of those things where whenever
[19:21] uh we tell our children, if you do this,
[19:23] then we'll let you do that. And then
[19:25] they feel that they've done this. So
[19:27] they come to you and they say, can we do
[19:28] that? And you said, well, no, you know,
[19:30] something else happened. Yeah, you did
[19:31] this, but you also did this, that, and
[19:33] the other. So, you can't have that. AND
[19:34] THEY'RE LIKE, YOU PROMISED, you said.
[19:38] It's like, okay. I mean, all right.
[19:41] Well, now I promised not to do it,
[19:44] right? And so, it's like that there's
[19:47] almost like this demand. You owe it to
[19:48] me as a debt. And that would be a
[19:50] dynamic where the child is forgetting
[19:52] they didn't make the rules.
[19:54] Wasn't their promise. And it's not owed
[19:55] by debt.
[19:57] But God graciously promises a reward for
[19:59] labor as an encouragement to do it.
[20:02] Amen. This is just God's grace. I really
[20:04] want you to catch this part. It's still
[20:06] it's still his grace
[20:08] and and it's still his grace and not
[20:10] even our motive for it.
[20:12] God rewards the believer in recognition
[20:14] of their faithful service of his own
[20:16] free will. Not because he has to.
[20:19] Not because we require him to. Not
[20:20] because there's some contract. It is not
[20:22] a similar contract between an employer
[20:25] and an employee where the employer would
[20:27] owe it by law. And there's certain uh
[20:29] contextual things to it that make this
[20:31] an obligation. And the employee could
[20:33] demand it. And if the the employer is
[20:34] not paid, he can demand the recourse in
[20:36] a court of law. Uh God graciously of his
[20:39] own will says, "You know what? If you do
[20:41] it, I'll reward you." So we have to
[20:43] realize rewards are still given by God's
[20:45] grace
[20:46] and not solely on our merit or by
[20:48] obligation. It is of grace, not debt.
[20:50] That's right.
[20:51] That God promises us these rewards.
[20:53] These are key principles. And because it
[20:56] I just think it's beautiful the way that
[20:58] God does it. We know that there's
[21:00] sometimes there's some reward programs
[21:01] that say if you spend so many dollars,
[21:04] we're going to give you so much back or
[21:06] here's a coupon uh for $50 off. And you
[21:09] you go and you said, "Hey, here's a
[21:10] coupon for $50 off." And they say, "I'm
[21:12] sorry, that's only for days that not
[21:14] ending in Y, right?" And you have to
[21:16] read the fine print. And you figure, oh,
[21:18] well, great. You know, uh is does leap
[21:20] your account? Uh, you know, there's
[21:23] there there's things that automatically
[21:24] begin to tell you how you can't do it
[21:25] and why you couldn't do it. And some of
[21:27] the scratchoff games they have at these
[21:28] restaurants or whatever where if you get
[21:30] all the letters, you're going to get a
[21:31] million dollars. And they just never
[21:33] give out all the letters.
[21:35] And so there's they they have their own
[21:37] rules and they make it harder on you to
[21:39] actually qualify for the reward or
[21:41] qualify for THE PRIZE. BUT GOD EMPOWERS
[21:44] the believer to accomplish their
[21:46] responsibility when he gives them the
[21:47] Holy Ghost. Amen.
[21:49] So the Bible even tells us it's not him
[21:51] that willth him that runth, but God that
[21:53] showeth mercy. And then he says it's
[21:55] both I in you both to will and to do of
[21:57] my good pleasure. And so God says if you
[22:00] will accomplish your responsibility, I'm
[22:01] going to give you a reward. And guess
[22:02] what? I'm going to give you the Holy
[22:03] Ghost. It'll make you do it.
[22:06] I'm just going to I'm going to I'm going
[22:07] to KIND OF PUT IT ALL IN YOUR FAVOR.
[22:09] AMEN.
[22:09] AMEN.
[22:10] OH, THERE'S ALL THESE THINGS I HAVE TO
[22:11] DO. WELL, I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU the Holy
[22:12] Ghost because it can do it.
[22:14] And so he actually empowers the believer
[22:16] to accomplish his responsibility when he
[22:18] gives him the Holy Ghost. So God is
[22:20] wanting he's wanting us. It's it's of
[22:22] old free will that he's going to give us
[22:24] these rewards. So this is not of debt.
[22:25] It's still grace because he promised the
[22:27] prize if I put it that way by his grace.
[22:30] And then he gives us the Holy Spirit to
[22:31] obtain the prize by his grace. It's
[22:34] something God does because he loves us.
[22:36] Amen.
[22:37] And so God does not propose the promise
[22:40] and does not offer the promise of a
[22:42] future reward so that the future reward
[22:45] becomes our motive for labor. These are
[22:47] key principles here at the outset. We
[22:48] may run out of time and and have to pick
[22:50] up on some of these things later, but
[22:52] it's important to catch these. He does
[22:54] not promise or or propose or suggest or
[22:57] tell us about the reward for labor so
[23:00] that the reward itself becomes our
[23:01] motive for it.
[23:03] And there's different scriptures that we
[23:04] could use to show that where there is a
[23:06] reward, it never indicates that the
[23:09] reward was the incentive,
[23:11] that the labor itself had the proper
[23:13] motive.
[23:14] And so the motive of our labor is our
[23:17] love of God and our desire to please
[23:19] him.
[23:19] Amen.
[23:20] And this ought to be expressed from
[23:22] every believer's heart and I find it
[23:23] clearly in the message of the hour. Paul
[23:25] is very particular about the prize and
[23:27] wanting to obtain and he teach gives us
[23:29] a lot of our robust teaching on the
[23:31] rewards. Brother Brandham al likewise
[23:33] gives us a lot of uh things on rewards
[23:36] when you can see this theme. But then he
[23:38] also says I don't need a reward.
[23:40] If I could just pat him on his feet,
[23:43] I'd be dearly paid. And so our motive
[23:45] isn't the reward. Our motive is the
[23:47] desire our love for him and our desire
[23:48] to please him in so much that you
[23:51] scripturally if you labored only because
[23:54] of the reward and not out of love for
[23:56] his word, it's actually not service.
[23:57] Right?
[23:59] So if the motive isn't correct, and the
[24:00] Bible's very clear on this, if the
[24:02] motive isn't correct, then it's not as
[24:03] if God is obligated because there's
[24:05] people who do many wonderful works in
[24:07] his name and he says, "Hey, I don't even
[24:09] know you."
[24:10] So there's things that qualify it. If I
[24:12] can say this as the believer that it is
[24:14] not our motive is not the reward, but
[24:17] the reward is his encouragement to us to
[24:19] do it. Our motive is our love for God
[24:21] and our desire to please him. The Bible
[24:23] says in Galatians 5:6, "For in Jesus
[24:25] Christ, neither circumcision avaleth
[24:27] anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith
[24:29] which workketh by love."
[24:32] Faith which workketh by love avails, not
[24:34] faith which works by a hungry a hungry
[24:37] heart to just get rewards and accumulate
[24:39] rewards and accumulate rewards. We are
[24:41] not like those who merely go shopping
[24:43] just so they could get points or fly on
[24:45] airline flights just so they can get
[24:47] miles, right? We're we're not of those
[24:49] who are just doing it to GET THE STATUS.
[24:51] OH, IF I CAN do this, if I can if I can
[24:53] attain this, if I can attain this, I get
[24:54] a different status. No, we do it because
[24:56] we love God. We do it because we want to
[24:58] please him. We have a faith which works
[24:59] by love. So, the promise, these are key
[25:02] principles. It's still God that
[25:04] graciously promises the reward. It's
[25:06] it's of grace and not debt. It's a God
[25:09] who has graciously promised the reward
[25:11] and then empowers us with his own Holy
[25:12] Spirit to do what is necessary to
[25:14] receive it. And then our motive is not
[25:16] the reward itself. Our motive is to
[25:19] please God. So the promise of reward is
[25:21] not our motive to act but it's our
[25:23] encouragement our stimulus
[25:25] in acting. So continuing now in 1
[25:28] Corinthians verse 9 chapter 3:9
[25:33] he says for we are laborers together
[25:35] with God. You're God's husbandry. You're
[25:37] God's building
[25:39] according to the grace of God which is
[25:41] given unto me as a wise master builder.
[25:43] I have laid the foundation and another
[25:45] buildeth thereon. So Paul is saying that
[25:48] I have a labor and this has been the
[25:51] grace of God that's given me the
[25:52] responsibility to lay the foundation.
[25:55] Having laid the foundation, Paul
[25:56] recognizes that people will build on the
[25:58] foundation that he laid. So he says,
[26:00] "But let every man take heed how he
[26:02] buildeth there upon." So Paul is this
[26:04] messenger of this age says, "For other
[26:06] foundation can no man lay than that is
[26:08] laid, which is Jesus Christ." Paul, it
[26:10] was Paul's responsibility who received a
[26:12] grace of God. He even says, "A special
[26:14] dispensation of grace was given to me to
[26:16] minister to you." So he ministers and
[26:18] what does he established? Jesus Christ.
[26:20] The revelation of Jesus Christ being
[26:21] established in that age as it was
[26:23] necessary at that time. He's preaching
[26:25] and Paul's proh revelation then was
[26:27] prophecy for today. Brother Bram said,
[26:30] and so he says, "Now there's going to be
[26:32] those that are going to build on this
[26:33] foundation of Jesus Christ. Now, if any
[26:37] man build upon this foundation, gold,
[26:39] silver, precious stones, and you can
[26:41] immediately tell there's a difference,
[26:42] right? Gold, silver, precious stones,
[26:46] wood, hay, stubble. Which ones are
[26:48] alike? Which ones are not alike?
[26:51] But circle those that um that are are,
[26:54] you know, that are alike and mark
[26:55] through those that are not alike.
[26:57] There's things you look at immed,
[26:59] silver, precious stones, wood, hay,
[27:02] stubble. As you'll see, the gold,
[27:04] silver, and precious stones are those
[27:05] good works, those good things that are
[27:07] built upon the foundation. But the wood,
[27:10] hay, and stubble would be the dead or
[27:12] the uh unfruitful works that are built
[27:14] upon the same foundation. So Paul says
[27:16] that a man will build either with gold,
[27:18] silver, precious stones, or wood, hay,
[27:20] or stubble. And in verse 13, every man's
[27:23] work shall be made manifest for the day
[27:26] shall declare it. It's going to be made
[27:28] manifest. It's going to prove what it
[27:29] really was all along. Not just what we
[27:32] saw it, what you thought of it. More
[27:33] importantly, because if you think about
[27:35] something, it's going to be important to
[27:36] catch here in a moment. When you do it,
[27:38] you think, "Oh, yeah. This is awesome.
[27:41] I'm going to get an A+, right?" And then
[27:43] you get it back and it's incomplete,
[27:45] right? And you're like, "Wait a minute.
[27:46] This was awesome. Why are you give you
[27:48] follow the wrong instructions, wrong
[27:49] assignment, whatever it was, you
[27:51] realize, oh, okay." So he's saying it's
[27:53] going to be proven what it actually was
[27:55] because it shall be revealed by fire and
[27:58] the fire shall try every man's work of
[28:01] what sort it is.
[28:03] The word there try means to test or
[28:04] examine. It's going to prove it. It's
[28:06] going to scrutinize it. Paul is saying
[28:09] that every man's work, whatever sort it
[28:11] is, is going to be tried. And he's
[28:12] already said that every man shall
[28:14] receive his own reward according to his
[28:16] own labor. So in in my breath today, I
[28:19] don't want you to I want you to come
[28:21] back to that idea that Paul is talking
[28:22] about a man receiving a reward for his
[28:24] labor. And he says it's going to be his
[28:26] labor is going to be tried as by fire.
[28:28] It's going to be revealed by fire and
[28:30] the fire shall try it. It's going to
[28:32] examine it. He's going to test it, prove
[28:34] it to approve it or to deem it valuable.
[28:37] It's going to assess a quality, a worth
[28:39] or character to the work. He's going to
[28:41] judge it. And so this is Paul saying
[28:44] that a man's work according to his
[28:45] responsibility is going to be examined.
[28:48] And it's going to be examined to
[28:49] determine a reward, not punishment.
[28:52] Have I mentioned that a lot? It's to
[28:54] determine a reward, not punishment. So
[28:57] there is not a sentence that would
[28:58] follow the scrutiny. There is no uh
[29:01] there not going to be remedial. There's
[29:03] no retribution when you're tested and
[29:05] judged and examined. In this instance,
[29:07] God is not going to say, you know what,
[29:08] do it all over. You need to start all
[29:09] over. Try again. He's not going to send
[29:10] you to the back of the line. you're not
[29:11] going to get another opportunity to do
[29:12] it. There's certain things. There's
[29:14] nothing punitive where it just wants to
[29:16] make you hurt for what you did. And
[29:17] there's nothing remedial where we need
[29:19] to rehabilitate you so you can do
[29:21] better.
[29:22] And so in our criminal justice system,
[29:24] uh even in our legal system, there's
[29:26] times when things are assessed and it's
[29:28] punitive. It's to punish. It's
[29:30] retribution. It's to punish the person
[29:31] for how they acted. But then there's
[29:33] other components that they want to
[29:35] remediate the person. They want to
[29:36] rehabilitate them. They want them to uh
[29:39] change and then come back into society
[29:41] in a way that they can uh benefit
[29:42] society and prove that they're changed.
[29:44] There's nothing of that sort taking
[29:46] place in this moment. There's no
[29:47] sentence. There's no retribution.
[29:49] There's no punishment. But yet you are
[29:51] examined. And in this examination, verse
[29:54] 14 says, "If any man's work abide, which
[29:56] he hath built thereupon, he shall
[29:57] receive a reward."
[30:00] So he comes back to this idea that if a
[30:03] man's work abides, if it remains, if it
[30:06] survives the scrutiny, he receives a
[30:08] reward. Why? Because every man shall be
[30:10] receive his own reward according to his
[30:12] own labor. So if our if our if just
[30:15] using this symbolic language that Paul
[30:17] is using, if our labors remain after the
[30:20] judgment, after the scrutiny, after the
[30:22] trial or the test, then he said there's
[30:24] a reward for that work. So we can though
[30:27] I believe Paul's being very specific
[30:29] here at a minimum to him and Apollos and
[30:31] anyone who builds upon the foundation of
[30:32] Jesus Christ. I think it presents to us
[30:34] a scripture then of how Christ is the
[30:36] foundation in our souls and then what is
[30:38] built upon that are our works and our
[30:40] testimony. As brother Brandham says that
[30:42] after we've accepted him, we're going to
[30:44] be held accountable for our responsible
[30:46] for our lives. The elect therefore will
[30:49] stand before Christ and answer for her
[30:52] conduct.
[30:54] All of us. we will stand before Christ
[30:57] and answer for our character and our
[30:58] attitude.
[30:59] Second John 8 says, "Look to yourselves
[31:01] that we lose not those things which we
[31:03] have wrought, but that we receive a full
[31:06] reward." Again, it's him granting
[31:08] rewards to faithful believers, but we
[31:10] ought to look to ourselves that we lose
[31:12] not those things which we wrought, those
[31:14] things which we labored for, and that we
[31:16] receive a full reward. So, there's a
[31:18] full reward. In other words, you can't
[31:20] earn more than this. saying labor so
[31:23] that you get a full one, a perfect
[31:24] reward, a complete reward. And Paul is
[31:27] saying when we labor for that, for the
[31:29] Lord and we and and we work for God and
[31:31] we build upon this foundation, this
[31:33] experience of the new birth, the labor
[31:35] which is acceptable to the judge abides.
[31:39] It survives and then is rewarded
[31:41] accordingly.
[31:42] So Paul says in verse 15, if any man's
[31:44] work shall be burned, he shall suffer
[31:46] loss. So in the analogy, which ones
[31:48] survive? the gold, silver, precious
[31:50] stones. The ones that don't survive are
[31:51] the wood, hay, and stubble. When he uses
[31:53] the analogy of fire, he's saying these
[31:55] things are purified by fire. These
[31:56] things are revealed by fire. There's
[31:58] certain things, there's a lot of things
[31:59] that gets in the way, and then you
[32:00] purify and realize there's that's real
[32:02] gold
[32:03] that once you got once you burned
[32:05] everything else away. This is kind of
[32:06] the encouraging part. I don't know if
[32:07] you're all thinking, man, this is
[32:09] getting more and more dark and foroding.
[32:11] I hope we sing happy songs when he's
[32:13] done.
[32:14] Uh this is the fun part because he's
[32:16] saying all the gold in your life will be
[32:19] revealed.
[32:21] All the wood, hay, and stubble is going
[32:22] to disappear
[32:23] so that you don't have to go into heaven
[32:25] with a bunch of stubble.
[32:26] Has nothing to do with beards, but you
[32:28] won't have to go into heaven with wood
[32:30] and hay.
[32:31] You're going to go in you're going to go
[32:32] into heaven with that those perfect
[32:34] precious stones, the gold and the
[32:35] silver, those things that remain.
[32:37] [snorts] The man, if any man's work
[32:39] shall be burned, he shall suffer life
[32:40] loss, excuse me. But he himself shall be
[32:43] saved. Yet so is by fire.
[32:46] It's it's a phrase that maybe um
[32:49] confusing to some and a lot of people
[32:51] wrestle with, but he's using just the
[32:53] analogy
[32:55] that if any man's work shall be burned,
[32:57] he shall suffer loss. The loss of the
[32:59] work,
[33:00] but he says he himself shall be saved.
[33:02] Yet so as by fire. He's just saying
[33:04] holding with the analogy, there may be
[33:06] loss of labor, but there is not loss of
[33:07] life. Amen.
[33:09] If you have eternal life, you may be
[33:10] building a lot of wood, hay, and
[33:12] stubble, and you're not going to get to
[33:13] keep it.
[33:14] It's all going to be burned down,
[33:16] but you will not lose your salvation. He
[33:18] shall suffer loss. It means he'll
[33:20] forfeit that special reward that brother
[33:22] Brandon called it or great reward. Paul
[33:23] is talking about he shall receive a
[33:25] reward. He shall suffer loss. He
[33:26] forfeits that re uh reward. It's a loss
[33:29] of some peculiar honor or praise that
[33:32] was due him if he had gold, silver, and
[33:34] precious stone.
[33:36] Right? Paul is looking at something not
[33:39] gained in this suffer loss. Something
[33:41] actually the root of that word uh uh is
[33:44] is something is curbed or restrained. I
[33:47] was just studying that word in greater
[33:48] detail uh and just what it means to
[33:50] suffer loss. It means there's something
[33:52] that's restrained, something that's held
[33:54] back. The word is translated in Luke to
[33:56] cast away.
[33:58] That if any man's work shall be burned,
[33:59] he shall there's something restrained or
[34:01] curved. There's something that he can't
[34:03] obtain to, something he cannot have. So
[34:05] there's this loss for what he could have
[34:07] been do had he labored and and and built
[34:10] with stone precious stones.
[34:12] And in in the sense that we might be I
[34:14] think I referred to this a moment ago in
[34:16] the sense that we might be expecting a
[34:17] greater reward
[34:20] uh that can be there is this sense it
[34:22] may be regarded as a loss if we don't
[34:25] win it.
[34:25] In the sense that oh I'm expecting this
[34:27] and I ought to do this and boy that was
[34:28] really really good and and you might be
[34:30] thinking well I just know one thing's
[34:31] for sure. when I'm judged at that day,
[34:33] I'm going to get a reward for uh for,
[34:35] you know, converting my neighbor uh uh
[34:38] and baptizing them in my swimming pool
[34:40] and and or you're just fully expecting
[34:42] and you get there and everything's
[34:43] destroyed and you go, "Man, what
[34:44] happened? I thought I at least saved one
[34:46] soul." And it's like, well, you you did
[34:47] it for all the wrong reasons and it was
[34:49] your testimony that undermined it in the
[34:50] end because you started getting on them
[34:52] for not going to church and they got
[34:53] really really discouraged and you're
[34:54] like,
[34:56] right,
[34:57] it's just an example just by way of
[34:59] analogy to understand that Paul is
[35:00] saying that what it is a sense of loss
[35:03] because it may be what one expected to
[35:06] gain.
[35:07] So the labor Paul is saying that work
[35:09] the labor that is the result that it
[35:11] results in wood hay and stubble which
[35:14] that which is not accepted is stripped
[35:16] away or not regarded worthy of reward.
[35:19] Again the believer cannot lose their
[35:20] salvation.
[35:21] It's a free gift
[35:24] and and they ever remain on the
[35:25] foundation which is Christ.
[35:27] So this is what you build not what what
[35:29] is laid. The foundation is laid is
[35:31] Christ. You don't lay that foundation.
[35:32] The foundation is Christ. And then
[35:34] whatever you you remain on that
[35:36] foundation, you cannot lose that. This
[35:37] is your life's work. This is your
[35:39] testimony.
[35:41] And those very things that you build
[35:42] upon that foundation, Paul is saying,
[35:43] are going to be investigated, going to
[35:45] be examined by the word, going to be
[35:46] looked into. And all that is good is
[35:49] approved. And all that is imperfect or
[35:52] inferior is removed.
[35:55] And if I can say this, I I believe that
[35:57] this in the scripture, this principle is
[35:59] clearly applied to those who preach the
[36:01] gospel at the very least in the context
[36:03] of what Paul is saying, context of what
[36:05] brother Brandham said. So let's see Paul
[36:07] applied this to himself in first
[36:09] Corinthians chapter 9 22- 27.
[36:15] I appreciate your patience this morning.
[36:17] I know you're being very diligent,
[36:19] listening very intently. I recognize
[36:22] that there's a labor in that that you're
[36:24] you're using your your mental faculties
[36:27] to strain and to hear and to understand
[36:29] and and you yourself are wanting to put
[36:31] these things together. So, I know that's
[36:32] a that taxes you. I know it may be warm
[36:35] for some. It could have been a very very
[36:37] long week and so you're tired. Um I I
[36:40] get that. I don't take it personal if
[36:42] you fall asleep. If I did, I would be
[36:44] the most depressed person on the face of
[36:45] the earth. I'm just kidding. I I don't
[36:48] take it personal when people fall
[36:49] asleep. Um, if I ever feel that I I'm
[36:52] the reason why they fell asleep, I will
[36:53] take it upon myself to wake them up.
[36:57] And so verse 22, to the weak because I
[37:00] am weak that I might gain the weak.
[37:01] Paul's attitude now. I made all I made
[37:03] all things to all men that I might by
[37:05] all means save some. That was his
[37:07] desire. Says, "And this I do for the
[37:09] gospel sake that I might be partaker
[37:11] thereof with you of the blessings and
[37:13] benefits of the gospel. I I want to
[37:15] partake in them." He's saying, "Know ye
[37:17] not that they which run in a race run
[37:18] all?" Again, this is chapter nine. We've
[37:20] just read from chapter 3. This is all
[37:22] we're initially drawing from the first
[37:24] Corinthians to see Paul using this theme
[37:26] to the Corinthian church of rewards. He
[37:28] says, "All run everyone runs in a race,
[37:32] but one receiveth the prize." So now he
[37:35] tells them, "Run that you may obtain the
[37:37] prize."
[37:38] Run to get something out of the race,
[37:40] not just to finish, but run to obtain.
[37:42] And every man that striveth for the
[37:44] mastery is temperate in all things. He
[37:46] shares a similar principle with Timothy
[37:47] that if you're going to strive for the
[37:48] mastery, you need to be temperate. You
[37:50] need to do certain things. You have a
[37:52] responsibility to care for yourself so
[37:54] that you can win the prize. Now they
[37:55] that do it to obtain a corruptible
[37:56] crown, but we an incorruptible.
[37:59] I therefore so run not as uncertainly,
[38:02] so fight I, not as one that beatth the
[38:05] air. Now, lest there be any confusion,
[38:09] we know that we cannot earn a new body,
[38:13] right? like that that that that that is
[38:15] promised us. The baptism of the Holy
[38:16] Ghost is the guarantee of the
[38:18] translation, the change. And so yet
[38:21] there still is a certain labor and
[38:24] desire to strive for rewards.
[38:29] And then even to the extent that we use
[38:31] this to re to
[38:34] apply to an incorruptible body, we are
[38:36] still laboring for the moment, right?
[38:39] When we are all changed, we're living
[38:41] for that. We want to not that we can
[38:42] earn it necessarily, but we can fill
[38:44] things up. We can accomplish what God
[38:46] wants us to accomplish. Says, I
[38:47] therefore so run not as uncertainty
[38:49] certainly so fight I not as one that
[38:52] beatth the air, but I keep under my body
[38:56] and I and bring it unto subjection, lest
[38:59] that by any means when I have preached
[39:00] to others, I myself should be a cast
[39:03] away. It's not the same word that's used
[39:06] earlier as suffer loss, but it's the
[39:07] print the same idea because to cast away
[39:10] it means not approved or displeasing.
[39:13] And so there's one Paul is saying that I
[39:16] and you you hear what he's saying. I
[39:18] become weak and I might gain the weak. I
[39:19] become all things and I might save some.
[39:21] I do this so I can be a partaker in the
[39:22] gospel with you. Paul has a great
[39:24] attitude and he says now you ought to
[39:26] run and strive to obtain. He says I do
[39:28] this. This is the way that I live. Lest
[39:31] by any means when I have preached to
[39:33] others, I myself sh self self should not
[39:35] be approved.
[39:37] Should not be accepted. It not be would
[39:39] be found not deserving of the reward.
[39:42] Amen.
[39:43] This is what Paul is explicitly saying
[39:45] that I want to labor correctly and I
[39:47] want to labor the right way and I want
[39:48] to labor for the right THINGS BECAUSE I
[39:50] DON'T WANT TO BE THAT GUY WHO preaches
[39:52] my entire life and because I didn't
[39:54] preach preach the word of God with the
[39:56] right motive and because I didn't labor
[39:57] correctly, I am found I'm not found
[39:59] worthy of the full reward that I stood
[40:01] to receive. Paul is clearly referring to
[40:03] his responsibility, his labor, his
[40:05] works, not his salvation. He wasn't
[40:07] worried that he could become a castaway
[40:09] and that his soul would be banished to
[40:11] hell or that he would suffer punishment
[40:12] for disobedience. He had already
[40:14] possessed the gift of eternal life. He
[40:16] wasn't afraid of losing his soul. But he
[40:18] dreaded displeasing God and losing any
[40:20] rewards.
[40:21] The idea of being a castaway is when
[40:23] I've labored and labored and labored and
[40:24] when I would stand worthy to receive, as
[40:26] brother Bam said, a special reward. when
[40:27] I would stand to receive what I just
[40:29] taught you. In chapter three, Paul is
[40:30] saying, I don't WANT TO BE THAT GUY WHO
[40:32] WHO LAID A FOUNDATION, WHO WATERED and
[40:34] was doing all this work, uh who planted,
[40:36] laid the foundation and planted, I do
[40:38] all this work, and then I stand there
[40:39] ready to be to receive a reward
[40:41] according to my labor. And he says, just
[40:44] entered into the joy of thy lord, and
[40:46] there's nothing given with it.
[40:51] As the Bible says in Revelations 3:11,
[40:53] "Behold, I come quickly. Hold that fast
[40:56] with thou which thou hast that no man
[40:58] take thy crown.
[41:01] You lose something you stood to receive
[41:03] one that was seemingly earned or gained.
[41:05] What is it? This is a missed
[41:06] opportunity. It's a missed eternal
[41:08] reward that's available to the
[41:09] believers.
[41:10] The Bible says that behold fast that
[41:12] which thou hast that no man take thy
[41:15] crown. What does it imply? Crowns can be
[41:17] lost.
[41:19] There can be potential unfulfilled.
[41:22] Things that you could have gained are
[41:23] not gained. Therefore, it's considered
[41:25] laws,
[41:26] right?
[41:32] If only the IRS would let us do that
[41:34] [snorts]
[41:36] in Matthew chapter 10 verse 42. This
[41:38] would the the the scriptures around
[41:40] preceding this are really good to read
[41:42] in that if you receive a word in uh
[41:43] receive a prophet in the name of the
[41:44] prophet um and and it and a righteous
[41:47] man in the name of a righteous man and
[41:49] it's saying that you shall receive a
[41:51] reward and there's like this descending
[41:52] order of prophet righteous man then just
[41:54] disciple the least of them and in each
[41:56] instance the motive for receiving them
[41:58] is because of what they deserve or who
[42:00] they are the respect that's accorded to
[42:02] them not the reward you're going to get.
[42:04] So again, another place that moderates
[42:06] this idea that we're we're not just
[42:07] laboring for rewards, but we get rewards
[42:09] because we labor. Said, "Whosoever shall
[42:11] give to drink unto one of these little
[42:12] ones a cup of cold water only in the
[42:15] name of a disciple, verily I say to you,
[42:18] he shall in no wise lose his reward.
[42:23] He has secured a reward for his service.
[42:25] He secured it." And so this suffer loss
[42:29] is not gaining the rewards that are
[42:31] available to the believer. as brother B
[42:33] said used that phrase the eternal
[42:35] rewards that are available and Paul knew
[42:37] then Paul as he's saying this that I I
[42:40] don't want to preach and labor and then
[42:41] be a castaway and be deemed unworthy or
[42:43] unfit for the reward he knew he would
[42:45] have to answer for how he fulfilled his
[42:47] responsibility in other words Paul knew
[42:48] there'd be a day of reckoning
[42:50] he knew that there would be a moment
[42:52] when he was held accountable remember in
[42:53] going beyond the curtain of time we
[42:55] shared it Wednesday night how brother
[42:56] Brandham is comes to that place where he
[42:58] said are these Brandhams and he sees all
[43:00] these converts and then he says well I
[43:01] want to see Jesus' and he says, "Wow,
[43:04] uh, he's he'll come one day and when he
[43:07] comes, he's going to come to you first
[43:09] and he's going to judge you by what you
[43:12] preached.
[43:13] He's going to judge you for your
[43:15] responsibility." He says, "Will every
[43:16] brother says, "Will everyone be
[43:17] responsible?" WHAT ABOUT PAUL? AND he
[43:20] said, "Paul will be responsible for his
[43:22] day."
[43:23] RIGHT? SO PAUL KNEW, PAUL knew that
[43:25] there would be this time. Brother
[43:26] Brandham sees it and going beyond the
[43:27] curtain of time. It's referenced that
[43:29] he's going to come and you're going to
[43:30] be judged a with your people and your
[43:32] subject's going to be judged by what you
[43:33] preach. So, there's going to be a moment
[43:34] in time when you're all being held
[43:36] accountable. You recognize just even how
[43:38] God is going to hold us accountable for
[43:40] what we received in this message.
[43:42] And you look back for people who are
[43:44] with Luther and you're like,
[43:46] I I I may be able to do that.
[43:49] Like, I would have been fine with that,
[43:52] right?
[43:53] But no, we didn't. That's not all WE
[43:55] GOT.
[43:56] WE GOT IT ALL. AND I SAY, "THANK GOD."
[43:58] WE'RE LIVING IN THIS golden age. We're
[44:00] living in this most wonderful age
[44:01] there's ever been, this bride age. This
[44:03] is a wonderful time to live. But there's
[44:04] a greater accountability because we've
[44:06] been tasked and given a greater
[44:08] responsibility. So Paul knew he would
[44:09] answer. Brother Brandham knew that he
[44:10] would have to answer. He said, "Someday
[44:12] I'm going to have to answer for what
[44:14] I've done here on earth. I'm going to
[44:15] have to answer for my stewardship." We
[44:17] read all those statements on Wednesday.
[44:20] Brother said, "I'm going to be held
[44:21] responsible. I'm going to have to
[44:22] answer." And he was clearly pointing to
[44:23] a day of reckoning, a time where he
[44:25] would be judged. So Paul when he comes
[44:27] to the end of his ministry 2 Timothy
[44:29] chapter 4 7 and 8 I fought a good fight
[44:31] I finished my course I kept thee faith
[44:35] and he says henceforth in other words
[44:36] because
[44:39] because of this there's laid up for me a
[44:41] crown of righteousness which the Lord
[44:43] the righteous judge shall give me at
[44:45] that day.
[44:47] This is a clear application to those
[44:49] that minister clear application to
[44:50] himself personally.
[44:53] And I say that just so that you don't
[44:55] feel that I'm trying to force just one
[44:57] way of looking at this. Brother Brham
[44:59] said he'll give a special or great
[45:00] reward to the messengers who faithfully
[45:02] carry out their responsibility. Paul is
[45:04] saying that God is going to give each
[45:05] man according to his labor. And we may
[45:07] think, well, he was talking about
[45:08] planting. He's talking about water. He's
[45:09] talking about those who build upon the
[45:10] foundation that's been laid. And so if
[45:12] we only want to view it in that context,
[45:15] Paul then affords us that example that
[45:17] here he is as a laborer who didn't want
[45:19] to be a castaway. He wanted to be deemed
[45:20] approved. And so when he comes to the
[45:22] end of the road, he's saying, "I fought
[45:24] a good fight."
[45:24] Amen.
[45:25] I've done it well. I finished my course.
[45:27] I've labored. I've labored well. And he
[45:29] knew that there was a reward that was
[45:30] laid up for him that he shall give me at
[45:33] that day.
[45:35] You remember, Brother Brand likewise
[45:36] could say he heard that prophecy. A huge
[45:38] portion of heaven awaits thee. That's
[45:40] not salvation. That's not being allowed
[45:42] to enter in. It's a greater expansion of
[45:44] stewardship in heaven. It's a greater
[45:46] expansion and blessing and benefits uh
[45:49] uh that are granted to him that he shall
[45:50] give me at that day.
[45:53] And Paul is speaking of himself. We
[45:54] could see it being applied to brother
[45:55] Brandham. But Paul is also drawing from
[45:57] the general principle of judgment and
[45:59] rewards at that day. A day of reckoning,
[46:02] a day to answer. And he says, "And not
[46:04] to me only, but unto all them also that
[46:06] love his appearing." Right.
[46:10] For all them that love his appearing,
[46:12] God has stored up for them a crown for
[46:15] they that have labored well those who
[46:17] have done right.
[46:20] So then he concludes the book of
[46:22] Corinthians with this scripture 1
[46:24] Corinthians 15:58.
[46:26] We pulled from chapter 3. We pulled from
[46:28] chapter 9 just to see this thing that
[46:30] that Paul just kind of mentions. he
[46:32] slips in and out of. And he says in 1
[46:34] Corinthians chapter 15:58, "Therefore,
[46:36] my beloved brethren, be ye steadfast,
[46:39] unmovable, always abounding in the work
[46:41] of the Lord. For as much as you know
[46:43] that your labor is not in vain in the
[46:45] Lord."
[46:47] What you do for his sake will be
[46:48] rewarded. He's telling them as as I've
[46:51] told you that I labor a and I and I've
[46:54] laid a foundation and I've planted and
[46:56] I'm going to receive a reward according
[46:58] to my labor. polace has watered and he's
[47:00] going to receive a reward according to
[47:01] his labor. And I've said that a man
[47:02] needs to be careful how he builds upon
[47:04] this foundation. If he's using gold and
[47:06] silver and precious stones or wood, hay
[47:08] or stubble and God's going to judge it
[47:09] and whatever remains will be rewarded
[47:11] and whatever is uh is burned away. He
[47:14] suffers the loss of that labor. He
[47:15] doesn't get a reward or payment for it,
[47:17] so to speak. He's teaching this to him
[47:19] and he comes to himself and he says,
[47:20] "Hey, I live by this principle because I
[47:23] don't want to be the guy who lays the
[47:25] foundation, plants, and then labors and
[47:27] labors and labors." and then at the end
[47:28] has not lived it well. If anything, we
[47:31] say this is exactly what brother Bam's
[47:32] referring to when he says that those
[47:34] messengers who faithfully discharge
[47:35] their responsibility not only received
[47:37] the revelation and preached it but lived
[47:39] it.
[47:40] And Paul said, I don't want to just be
[47:41] the guy that gets revelation and
[47:42] preaches it, I want to be the guy that
[47:44] lives it so that I can receive a special
[47:46] reward. And he's telling him, I want to
[47:47] be that guy that receives the reward. He
[47:50] tells Timothy later on that I finished
[47:52] my course. I'm going to receive my
[47:53] reward. So he sums up his letter to the
[47:55] Corinthians, saying, "Now you be
[47:57] steadfast and unmovable, always
[47:59] abounding in the work of the Lord, which
[48:00] is your whatever your responsibility is.
[48:04] For as much as you know that your labor
[48:05] is not in vain in the Lord, know that
[48:07] your laboring will be rewarded."
[48:11] In other words, he's saying, "If I if
[48:12] I'm rewarded as the messenger, then
[48:14] there's a reward for you as the
[48:16] believer."
[48:18] Now, if you could, we're we're getting
[48:20] very very very close to entering the
[48:22] after hour.
[48:24] and I can go quickly through these next
[48:26] um two script three scripture readings,
[48:29] but you'll have to kind of hold tight to
[48:31] it. If there's a question, you can very
[48:33] easily pull me into things and that'll
[48:35] be fine because we'll have more time
[48:37] later. Um if not, we can catch up while
[48:39] we're waiting in line to get our rewards
[48:40] on the other side. Hey guys, come here
[48:43] real quick. Let me just finish this.
[48:44] Ephesians chapter 6 5 to8. I want I want
[48:47] to read through this so you recognize
[48:48] that Paul again is building on this
[48:50] principle of receiving a reward.
[48:52] servants, be obedient to them that are
[48:54] your masters according to the flesh with
[48:56] fear and trembling and singleness of
[48:57] your heart as unto Christ.
[49:01] There's been a lot of unfaithful
[49:03] so-called Christians that used the
[49:06] teaching in both the Old Testament and
[49:07] the New Testament to support race-based
[49:09] slavery to support the stealing of men,
[49:13] the kidnapping, the subjugation, and the
[49:15] mistreatment of others. And Paul when
[49:18] he's dealing with servants, it's not the
[49:20] same kind of slavery that we have in our
[49:22] mind in maybe more modern times, there's
[49:24] actually tremendous teaching on there's
[49:26] actually teaching in the Bible against
[49:27] doing that very thing.
[49:28] So the type of bond servant or what we'd
[49:31] call slavery or servants and masters in
[49:33] the scripture are very different than
[49:35] what we saw uh uh in later times in wi
[49:39] with with uh cruel slavery.
[49:42] And though even this is where I find
[49:44] myself drawing from this, even though
[49:47] there were those who mistreated servants
[49:49] and treated them harshly, that was never
[49:51] the intent of the system where a man
[49:53] could sell himself in order to redeem
[49:55] certain things and to buy off certain
[49:57] debts. And there's certain orders and
[49:58] structures to it. But Paul nonetheless
[50:00] is referring to those that would be part
[50:01] of that structure. And he tells the
[50:03] servants uh be obedient to their
[50:06] masters. Now don't think or modern day
[50:08] slavery or even the the horrible stain
[50:10] on our nation when it comes to slavery.
[50:13] It's a different type of servitude. He's
[50:15] tell them to obey with fear and
[50:16] trembling as unto Christ.
[50:18] Right?
[50:19] So the servants ought to serve their
[50:21] masters as they would serve Christ.
[50:23] Because Paul says not with eyes service
[50:25] as men pleasers but as the servants of
[50:28] Christ doing the will of God from the
[50:30] heart. So it's the will of God that we
[50:31] would obey our employers. It's the will
[50:33] of God that a servant would obey his
[50:34] master. It's God's will that you enter
[50:36] into if you enter into a contract with
[50:38] somebody or an agreement or an
[50:39] obligation that you would fulfill it.
[50:42] Right? If you promise to do something
[50:44] that you would actually do it. He says
[50:46] with good will doing service as to the
[50:49] Lord. Again, he's wanting us to think
[50:50] more of what our duty would be to God by
[50:53] virtue of our relationship to this
[50:54] person. Not just the one-way contract or
[50:57] two-way contract with the individual
[50:59] with do good will doing services to the
[51:01] Lord and not to men knowing that
[51:03] whatsoever good thing any man doeth the
[51:05] same shall he receive of the Lord
[51:07] whether he be bond or free. Amen.
[51:10] So even the the the the the masters the
[51:13] word is used here is one that ought to
[51:16] treat servants well because he is going
[51:19] to receive if he does wrong as Paul
[51:21] touches on it later and we're actually
[51:22] skipping that verse in Colossians where
[51:23] he that has done evil is going to
[51:25] receive of that. If you've mistreated,
[51:26] you've done things wrong. But if you do
[51:28] good as unto the Lord, you know that the
[51:30] same you shall receive from the Lord.
[51:33] This I I believe that [clears throat]
[51:36] there is a reward in this life. But it's
[51:38] Paul's also teaching building upon the
[51:40] same principle that if you do well and
[51:42] you labor for the Lord, the Lord sees
[51:44] it.
[51:45] Whatever you do as you do it under the
[51:46] Lord, he sees it and he will a man will
[51:48] receive of the Lord.
[51:50] Amen.
[51:51] For how he served here on earth.
[51:53] Right? Jesus says in John 12:26, "If any
[51:56] man serve me, let him follow me, and
[51:58] where I am, there shall also my servant
[52:00] be. If any man serve me, him will my
[52:03] father honor."
[52:05] So there's honor for service rendered,
[52:06] not just for the minister. This is for
[52:08] any man who will live his life
[52:10] correctly. Any man who will honor God in
[52:11] the way that he treats other people and
[52:13] the way he fulfills his responsibility.
[52:15] So this is wherever you are as a
[52:16] student, if you're honest, if you don't
[52:18] cheat, if you treat your fellow students
[52:19] right, if you respect your teacher, if
[52:21] you do what's expected of you, if you go
[52:22] to class, if you do your work, all these
[52:24] different things, you know, that counts,
[52:27] right? And the Bible touches on so many
[52:29] things about uh ambition and doing a job
[52:32] well and and and and all the things that
[52:34] relate to cleanliness and all all the
[52:36] ways that we would live our lives and
[52:38] keep our homes even in the uh uh the
[52:40] care of things that we own. IT ALL
[52:42] SPEAKS OF OUR testimony as Christians.
[52:45] And if any man will serve Christ, he
[52:48] says his father, any man, he will f his
[52:51] father will honor that man who serves
[52:52] him. So as it relates to servants, the
[52:55] Bible is saying that if any man will do
[52:57] service as unto the Lord, he shall
[52:58] receive of the Lord. In Colossians
[53:01] chapter 3 23 to 24, excuse me, verse 18,
[53:05] we'll start with verse 18. And I think I
[53:06] put this in the slide, not just verse
[53:08] 23, but Colossians chapter 3 18- 24.
[53:13] I include these first few verses because
[53:17] though what he's saying is going to be
[53:19] very close to what he says in Ephesians
[53:20] chapter 6,
[53:22] I love how we can apply this to these
[53:23] other parts. Wives, submit yourselves
[53:25] unto your own husbands as it is fit in
[53:27] the Lord. Husbands, love your wives and
[53:29] be not bitter against them. Children,
[53:31] obey your parents in all things, for
[53:32] this is well pleasing unto the Lord.
[53:34] Notice how even in these natural
[53:35] relationships, God has a sense of
[53:38] expectation as to what you ought to do.
[53:41] And in doing this, if you do it
[53:43] faithfully, he's like, "I'm going to
[53:44] reward a person. I'm going to reward
[53:46] this person. I I'm not forgetful." This
[53:49] fathers, provoke not your children
[53:50] anger, lest they be discouraged. These
[53:52] are all ways that we have relationships
[53:54] that impose upon us an obligation. And
[53:56] God is going to hand hold us accountable
[53:58] for how the husbands love their wives.
[54:00] Going to hold us accountable for how we
[54:02] provoked our children. He's going to
[54:04] take away my salvation. No, he's not
[54:05] going to take away your salvation.
[54:06] Though some sort of serial abuse may be
[54:08] indicative of a lack in it,
[54:10] right? A lack of lack of repentance, a
[54:13] lack of remorse, uh uh uh you know, some
[54:15] patterns of behavior can be indicative
[54:17] that Christ does not dwell there. But if
[54:19] you believe that you've have the Holy
[54:21] Ghost and you're serving God and your
[54:22] soul has been sealed, you're still going
[54:23] to be accountable for the way that you
[54:25] treat your wife, the way that you
[54:26] reverence your husband, the way that you
[54:27] treat your children. And he transitions
[54:30] to servant. So now he's just picked up
[54:31] on all these different relationships.
[54:33] Servants, obey in all things your
[54:35] masters according to the flesh, not with
[54:36] eye service as men pleasers, but in
[54:38] singleness of heart, fearing God. Very
[54:40] similar to what he said to the Ephesian
[54:42] church. And whatsoever ye do, and I
[54:44] would say that this would apply to all
[54:46] of us. Whatsoever ye do, do it heartily
[54:48] as to the Lord and not unto men, knowing
[54:51] that of the Lord, ye shall receive the
[54:53] reward of the inheritance, for you serve
[54:56] the Lord Christ. believe it was brother
[54:58] Tim Cross who used this scripture and
[55:00] it's what anchored it and solidified it
[55:02] in me to venture into this subject of
[55:04] judgment and rewards is he read this
[55:06] scripture as you shall receive the
[55:08] reward of the inheritance which means
[55:10] you re shall receive as you're due the
[55:12] reward
[55:16] in other words all that is done for his
[55:17] sake in love for him is going to be
[55:20] divinely rewarded whatsoever you do do
[55:23] it heartily as in the Lord and not unto
[55:25] men you know sometimes maybe in certain
[55:26] relationships It's very difficult for us
[55:29] to do our duty in the face of one who's
[55:31] not doing theirs. And it becomes hard
[55:34] when we only see it as us doing it for
[55:36] them.
[55:37] But it might get easier. I'm just going
[55:39] to give you a little bit of grace. It
[55:40] might get easier when you do it as under
[55:41] the Lord and not for them.
[55:43] There may be people who don't deserve
[55:44] the respect, but out of respect for the
[55:46] office, you give it as under the Lord.
[55:48] There are certain ways that it's very,
[55:49] very hard for me to do it for that
[55:51] person because they haven't demonstrated
[55:52] the faithfulness. They've hurt or
[55:53] they've caused this or they've let me
[55:55] down. They've done all these things. but
[55:56] yet you still have a responsibility to
[55:58] them. And none of those things that
[55:59] you've just elicited relieve you of that
[56:01] responsibility. You'll find that it's it
[56:03] looses the power in you to serve or to
[56:06] look out after to not provoke whatever
[56:08] it might be when you realize I'm going
[56:09] to do this as unto the Lord. Amen.
[56:11] Amen.
[56:12] Knowing from whom my reward will come.
[56:16] That there is a promise then to the
[56:18] wives, to the husbands, to the children,
[56:20] to the parents,
[56:22] to whatsoever you do, do it unto the
[56:24] Lord.
[56:26] I think they Sister Rebecca may be in
[56:28] the back with their children. Sister
[56:30] Rebecca Cruz uh was sent a note just
[56:33] testifying of how much the service meant
[56:35] on Wednesday night because
[56:38] there was this emphasis on all the
[56:40] labors that mothers undertake to be in
[56:42] service and you get your kids ready and
[56:44] you come to church, you do it all on
[56:45] your own and you get to church and you
[56:46] can't sit in service and you go sit
[56:47] somewhere else because the kids uh need
[56:50] to eat or one's fussing or whatever it
[56:51] is and you think what was it all what
[56:53] was it? What was worth it? What was the
[56:55] point? I didn't get anything out of the
[56:56] service. No, you're going to get
[56:58] something out of it. Amen.
[56:59] You're going to get something out of it
[57:01] because you didn't do it as under the
[57:02] church. You didn't do it as under the
[57:03] pastor. You didn't do it as under the
[57:04] preacher. You did it because you knew
[57:06] this is where you wanted to be and this
[57:08] is where your you want your children to
[57:09] know that you want to be
[57:11] and it's going to pay off for the
[57:12] children even in this life. But then God
[57:14] also sees and hears and knows. And he
[57:16] says knowing that you shall receive the
[57:18] reward
[57:20] for you serve the Lord Jesus Christ.
[57:22] This is not just for ministers but for
[57:23] husbands, for wives, for children, for
[57:25] labors, for servants. There is a REWARD
[57:27] OF THE INHERITANCE TO those who serve
[57:29] and serve faithfully. So Paul says in 2
[57:32] Corinthians 5:9 and 10, we're going to
[57:33] try to go real fast here. Wherefore we
[57:35] labor that whether present or absent, we
[57:37] may be accepted of him, may be pleasing
[57:38] to him. This is our ambition. This is
[57:40] why we labor. For we must all, this is
[57:42] now all of us now as he writes back to
[57:44] the Corinthians in his next letter. We
[57:45] must all appear before the judgment seat
[57:48] of Christ that everyone may receive the
[57:50] things done in his body
[57:53] according to that heath done whether it
[57:55] be good or bad. This would not have been
[57:58] strange material to the Corinthian
[57:59] church because he already touched on it
[58:01] so vividly in his first letter about a
[58:04] man answering for his labor and being
[58:05] rewarded accordingly. So he reminds them
[58:07] again that we will all stand before the
[58:10] judgment seat of Christ. That word there
[58:12] is beimma. It's a raised place, like a
[58:14] raised platform. You you'd get there by
[58:17] stepping up. It's not it's not that
[58:19] word's not used of the white throne
[58:21] judgment. It's only used in of this um
[58:23] when he says the judgment seat of
[58:24] Christ, this phrase, this bema, it's his
[58:26] throne. This stepping up that a man may
[58:29] receive. It's that grant of a reward
[58:31] proportional to what you did with your
[58:33] life. As brother Bram said, we're going
[58:35] to be responsible after we've accepted
[58:37] Christ for our life. We're going to be
[58:39] held accountable. And it's proportional,
[58:42] Paul says, to the things that we did in
[58:44] our flesh.
[58:45] Not was in your soul, right? That's his
[58:48] work.
[58:49] He's already given you that that gift.
[58:52] But you're going to answer for your work
[58:53] and for your efforts. As he said in
[58:54] Romans 14, as we read it already, we all
[58:56] shall stand before thee bema, the
[58:59] judgment seat of Christ. So then every
[59:00] one of us shall give an account of
[59:02] ourselves to God.
[59:04] That's the day of reckoning. It's the
[59:06] moment of accountability.
[59:09] I trust it's
[59:12] I trust that at the very least the
[59:14] principle is becoming clear
[59:17] that there's going to be a moment that
[59:19] you'll receive a reward for all that
[59:21] you've done.
[59:21] Amen.
[59:22] If you don't see it in this life, this
[59:23] is what gives it perspective because we
[59:25] there's things you preach and all if you
[59:27] do this and if you do that and God said
[59:29] this and there's people that seem to do
[59:30] everything that they thought they're
[59:31] supposed to do. Brother Aaron, I went to
[59:33] church. I paid my tithe. I did this. I
[59:34] did this, but this still happened. I did
[59:36] this and I did this and this still
[59:37] happened. and it just seems like all
[59:38] I've received in this life is heartache
[59:40] and loss and separation and didn't get
[59:42] this and lost that and tried to work for
[59:44] this and it just seems like through all
[59:45] of it everything keeps getting taken
[59:47] away and you said where is the promise
[59:49] of the the reward where's the promise of
[59:51] receiving where's the promise of getting
[59:53] something out of it it's like you just
[59:54] keep saving
[59:55] right
[59:56] like you're what what you stand what you
[59:59] have secured there pales as Paul said
[1:00:01] the suffering this present time not
[1:00:02] worthy to the glory that's going to be
[1:00:04] revealed to us whatever you just the
[1:00:06] attitude you have and that Perseverance.
[1:00:08] This is why Paul is even using a
[1:00:10] language of hold out to the end.
[1:00:11] Persevere. Brother Bon says we look out
[1:00:13] to the end when the rewards are given.
[1:00:15] We're not living in this life. We're not
[1:00:16] looking to this life alone. We're not
[1:00:18] trying to take this computation now and
[1:00:20] calculate. Well, I've paid this much in
[1:00:22] tithing. I've given this much to
[1:00:23] missions. I've done this and I've done
[1:00:24] this, but then I had I I did a balance
[1:00:26] sheet for my life and I've given more
[1:00:28] away than I have in savings. And you
[1:00:30] start asking yourself, when is it all
[1:00:31] going to measure up and life this life
[1:00:33] wasn't worth it? No. No. Slow down.
[1:00:35] There's going to be a day when God's
[1:00:37] going to reward you for everything
[1:00:38] you've done to serve him.
[1:00:41] Brother Bram says in the sermon, "Thy
[1:00:42] loving kindness." And those who are
[1:00:43] wayfairing men and women along life's
[1:00:46] journey, some of them, Lord, have been
[1:00:47] on the field for a long time. And not
[1:00:50] one thing have they ever did for thy
[1:00:52] glory that's hid from you.
[1:00:55] You remember every little deed and every
[1:00:57] heartache and everything that they've
[1:00:58] suffered for the kingdom's sake. Then
[1:01:00] someday they shall receive that great
[1:01:02] reward when the crowns will be given
[1:01:04] out.
[1:01:06] A day of reckoning, a moment and time
[1:01:08] when God will acknowledge your
[1:01:10] heartache, your suffering, every deed,
[1:01:13] and everything you did and settle up
[1:01:15] with you.
[1:01:17] That's when the tally is going to be
[1:01:19] made. That's when the judgment is made.
[1:01:21] I know it kind of carries with it this
[1:01:23] maybe this idea of this foreboing of,
[1:01:24] oh, THERE'S GOING TO BE FIRE AND MY W
[1:01:26] WORK'S GOING TO BE burned and you're
[1:01:28] going to suffer loss. But it's not meant
[1:01:29] to create this fear of judgment. It's
[1:01:32] certainly used to motivate us to labor
[1:01:34] correctly. But it also becomes to us an
[1:01:36] inspiration that it's worth it all.
[1:01:40] That as a believer, I want to persevere.
[1:01:42] I want to be faithful. I want to hear
[1:01:43] words from him on that day of, oh, you
[1:01:45] know, all that heartache and how you you
[1:01:47] didn't knuckle down and you could have
[1:01:48] given up and you could have quit and
[1:01:49] everybody else did this and everybody
[1:01:51] else did that. There there's people who
[1:01:52] make difficult decisions to please God
[1:01:55] and who do what they know is right for
[1:01:57] their families and for themselves. And
[1:01:58] and it comes with a great price. And if
[1:02:01] you never see the redemption on this
[1:02:02] side of it, KNOW THAT GOD SEES every bit
[1:02:05] of it and will grant you a proportional
[1:02:08] reward.
[1:02:11] And that's what we see in Matthew
[1:02:12] chapter 25. read verses verses 14 and 15
[1:02:19] and then we'll skip to verse 19.
[1:02:32] Bear in mind that we do not want to
[1:02:38] um
[1:02:40] we're we're looking at the specific
[1:02:42] principle of God rewarding a man for his
[1:02:43] responsibility. I'll say that for the
[1:02:45] kingdom of heaven is a man traveling
[1:02:46] into a far country who called his own
[1:02:48] servants and delivered under them his
[1:02:49] goods. And to one he gave five talents
[1:02:52] and to another two and to another one.
[1:02:54] To every man according to his several
[1:02:56] ability and straight he took his
[1:02:57] journey. So he didn't expect from some
[1:03:01] more. didn't give them more and expect
[1:03:03] something. He did it according to their
[1:03:04] gifting, according to their ability,
[1:03:07] their power. What was it within their
[1:03:08] power? So God God isn't gonna uh I'm
[1:03:11] saying this as a confession. God isn't
[1:03:13] going to make me a missionary, right? To
[1:03:14] Africa, right? That that's not what I'm
[1:03:17] that's not what I'm gifted to be. That's
[1:03:18] so he's not expecting me. Well, you
[1:03:20] didn't go enough times to that island
[1:03:21] where they don't have electricity. I I I
[1:03:23] by God's grace, that's not what I have
[1:03:25] to fulfill. So some they do a lot more
[1:03:27] than others and they have greater
[1:03:28] stewardships and greater
[1:03:29] responsibilities but he does it all
[1:03:31] according to their several ability uh
[1:03:33] and he takes his journey. So verse 19
[1:03:35] now he comes back after a long time the
[1:03:37] lord of those servants cometh and
[1:03:38] reckonth with them. That word reckonth
[1:03:41] mean he's rendering an account getting
[1:03:44] from them an account because notice when
[1:03:45] he reckons with them they tell him what
[1:03:48] they did. They give an account of their
[1:03:49] use of what was given to them. Reckoning
[1:03:52] you could even use some of your
[1:03:53] understanding of of of
[1:03:56] accounting or or balancing a book. Uh
[1:03:58] you know, just different things. It kind
[1:04:00] of has that same idea of reckoning
[1:04:02] something. Uh there's a computation. It
[1:04:04] comes from logos. The thought here is
[1:04:06] I'm going to talk to you and I'm I'm
[1:04:08] going to say, hey, what did you do with
[1:04:10] the five?
[1:04:11] What did you do with the two? And the
[1:04:12] reckoning is, well, this is what I did
[1:04:14] with it, and this is what I have, and
[1:04:16] this is why I have what I have. And you
[1:04:18] give an explanation. You give a thought.
[1:04:20] It's that day of reckoning. And he
[1:04:21] reckonth with them. this meeting between
[1:04:24] the Lord and the servant and they have
[1:04:26] the face to face and there's a judgment
[1:04:28] of what did you do with what I gave you
[1:04:31] and so he that received five talents
[1:04:32] came and brought other five talents
[1:04:33] saying Lord thou has delivered unto me
[1:04:35] five talents behold I've gained beside
[1:04:37] them five talents more and this is the
[1:04:39] response now his lord said unto him well
[1:04:41] done thou good and faithful servant thou
[1:04:43] hast been faithful over a few things
[1:04:45] that I gave you right I will make thee
[1:04:48] ruler over many things enter thou into
[1:04:50] the joy of thy lord
[1:04:53] He's going to share with him now because
[1:04:55] all things are in the possession of the
[1:04:56] the Lord. He says, "Now enter thou into
[1:04:59] enjoy with me all those things that are
[1:05:01] mine and I'm going to give you more of
[1:05:03] what's mine.
[1:05:04] I'm going to give you a greater
[1:05:05] stewardship. I'm going to expand to you
[1:05:07] uh what you what uh because of your
[1:05:09] faithfulness here, I'm going to give you
[1:05:11] more there." And he also said to him
[1:05:13] that received two, it's the same thing
[1:05:14] in verse 23, well done, good and
[1:05:17] faithful servant. Thou hast been
[1:05:18] faithful over a few things. I will make
[1:05:20] thee ruler over many things. Enter thou
[1:05:22] into the joy of thy Lord. What what is
[1:05:25] this that's taking place here? I'm using
[1:05:27] it to refer to that day of reckoning for
[1:05:29] us. That time when we will answer for
[1:05:32] what we had. And we don't need to be
[1:05:34] counting our talents saying, "Well, he
[1:05:35] gave him five. He only gave me two."
[1:05:37] Just what did you do with your two?
[1:05:38] Amen. That's good.
[1:05:39] Do you realize that even in this
[1:05:43] it's not even uh the one that had one if
[1:05:46] he would have gotten interest or just
[1:05:47] doubled even the one that the same thing
[1:05:49] was would been said
[1:05:50] right
[1:05:52] that the full reward for the that had
[1:05:54] five he when he when he doubled it he
[1:05:56] got his reward FOR THE ONE THAT HAD TWO
[1:05:58] he got his reward to the one that had
[1:06:00] the one because he didn't labor
[1:06:02] correctly and he didn't please the the
[1:06:04] Lord he says take away from him that he
[1:06:06] had and give it right?
[1:06:08] To the one that had 10.
[1:06:11] And and if I COULD JUST SAY THIS, WE'RE
[1:06:12] NOT TRYING TO INTERPRET or read too much
[1:06:14] into it, but you know what? I've lived a
[1:06:16] little bit. I think there's a lot of
[1:06:18] talents for us to steal,
[1:06:20] right? There's a lot of people that
[1:06:22] don't LABOR FAITHFULLY. THERE'S A LOT
[1:06:23] WHO HAVEN'T done the minimum with WHAT
[1:06:25] GOD HAS GIVEN THEM. And so, he who
[1:06:28] labors correctly stands to receive even
[1:06:31] those things which someone has not re
[1:06:33] labored for correctly.
[1:06:36] just using the expressions from the
[1:06:38] scripture. This is a time to answer.
[1:06:41] This is the moment. I'm going to close
[1:06:42] here with the the story brother tells in
[1:06:44] the sixth seal. This is when rewards are
[1:06:48] given
[1:06:50] when this Lord who's been gone for some
[1:06:52] time returns right
[1:06:54] at that meeting in the air
[1:06:55] and we're all gathered together. Brother
[1:06:57] Bman, one place says he likes it to the
[1:06:59] marriage supper. He says, "It's going to
[1:07:01] be like the marriage supper." And he was
[1:07:02] referring to that time when crowns are
[1:07:03] given out. Rewards are given out. That's
[1:07:06] what that's what I'm wanting you to
[1:07:07] recognize. This is a judgment for these
[1:07:10] crowns, for these rewards. You say,
[1:07:13] "Well, what what are they? What are
[1:07:14] they?" Well,
[1:07:16] the Bible calls them crowns, calls them
[1:07:18] rewards.
[1:07:19] And in some in some ways it's referred
[1:07:21] to greater a greater expansion of
[1:07:23] stewardship or or you're going to get
[1:07:25] you're going to have received talents
[1:07:28] that were available that weren't used.
[1:07:33] But what's important is just recognizing
[1:07:35] it happens.
[1:07:37] And the sixth seal, I'm closing on this.
[1:07:38] I don't I don't think this is going to
[1:07:39] be anticlimatic, but we're just winding
[1:07:41] down with this.
[1:07:44] He says, I want you to tell tell you a
[1:07:45] little thing happened.
[1:07:48] this was a dream and he's very
[1:07:50] particular that he wants us to know this
[1:07:51] is just a dream. I was asleep and it's
[1:07:54] after when he says uh after that time
[1:07:59] um maybe it's here on the next slide
[1:08:01] somewhere where he says about a month
[1:08:02] after that and he's referring to when
[1:08:04] his wife they they had a conversation
[1:08:06] about uh a thing and and about love and
[1:08:08] different things. He says I want to tell
[1:08:09] you a little thing happened. This was a
[1:08:10] dream. I was asleep and I've never told
[1:08:13] this publicly before. I told it to a
[1:08:14] couple people but never publicly before
[1:08:16] as I know of. I dreamed about a month
[1:08:19] after that after this conversation he
[1:08:20] had with Mida that I was standing one
[1:08:22] day and I was watching the great time
[1:08:25] that so this is a great time I was
[1:08:28] standing and watching that great time he
[1:08:30] says not the judgment now and the next
[1:08:32] slide not the judgment now
[1:08:35] he says I don't believe the bride goes
[1:08:38] to a judgment and and and and this these
[1:08:40] are my notes I realize I use my notes to
[1:08:42] make the slide that he says I don't
[1:08:44] believe the church and he corrects
[1:08:46] himself the bride goes to a judgement So
[1:08:48] the the bride, he says, I don't believe
[1:08:49] the bride goes to a judgment. But I was
[1:08:52] there when the crowns was being given
[1:08:55] out.
[1:08:57] Brother B, this isn't this isn't strange
[1:08:59] to him. When he had this dream, he knew
[1:09:01] exactly where he was.
[1:09:03] Not the bride being judged at white
[1:09:04] throne for salvation. He goes, "But I
[1:09:06] but not the judgment now. The bride
[1:09:09] doesn't go to that judgment, but I was
[1:09:10] there when the crowns were being given
[1:09:12] out. I had this dream of this time." And
[1:09:14] this is how he begins to describe it.
[1:09:16] And just uh I don't I didn't provide
[1:09:17] this because I just wanted you to listen
[1:09:19] to this. Uh uh and if I could maybe just
[1:09:21] amplify it even now. When brother Bham
[1:09:22] is coming to this place, he says, "I'm
[1:09:24] standing there when the crowns are going
[1:09:26] to be given out." Brother Bams used the
[1:09:27] language to say that one day there we
[1:09:29] live out to the end when the rewards are
[1:09:31] given. And brother Bam knew when he went
[1:09:33] beyond the curtain of time. He made that
[1:09:35] statement. I think we may have read this
[1:09:36] one on Wednesday or I just have it here
[1:09:38] in my notes where he said uh where I
[1:09:40] want to see Jesus.
[1:09:42] So this is the moment now. He's standing
[1:09:44] off to the side. This is the day when
[1:09:45] crowns are going to be given out. So
[1:09:47] this is the moment when he's going to
[1:09:48] see Jesus. And he had said this before,
[1:09:50] I want to see Jesus. And the guy says,
[1:09:52] he's higher than this. Someday he'll
[1:09:54] come and you'll be judged by the gospel
[1:09:55] that you preached.
[1:09:57] He says, well, will Paul have to be
[1:09:59] judged? Will Paul have to be judged by
[1:10:01] his crowd? He said, yes.
[1:10:03] So brother B is saying that he's wants
[1:10:04] to see Jesus. And he says he's going to
[1:10:06] come and when he comes, you're going to
[1:10:08] be judged.
[1:10:09] And he says that that's when there's a
[1:10:11] judgment. And when there's a judgment,
[1:10:13] he's going to receive a reward. Remember
[1:10:14] the uh he said because thou HAS CHOSEN
[1:10:17] THE HARDER WAY AND IT WAS THE CORRECT
[1:10:19] AND PRECISE WAY a huge portion of heaven
[1:10:21] awaits thee. Remember how Paul said I've
[1:10:23] finished my course so I henceforth has
[1:10:25] laid up for me a crown. SO THIS IS THAT
[1:10:27] TIME BROTHER BENHAM SEES IT IN THE SIXTH
[1:10:29] SEAL AND HE SHARES THIS DREAM. He said
[1:10:30] I've shared with people but I've never
[1:10:31] publicly shared it and I don't know that
[1:10:33] he ever shares it again. And he's trying
[1:10:34] to tell this time and he uses such clear
[1:10:36] and precise language. I was there when
[1:10:38] the crowns were being given out. Brother
[1:10:40] Brandham individually was going to
[1:10:41] answer for his labor. Right?
[1:10:43] You remember in going beyond the curtain
[1:10:45] of time, very strange thing happens in
[1:10:47] that when he's in that when he tells the
[1:10:49] vision and he sees his horse think
[1:10:51] Prince
[1:10:52] and then he SEES HIS DOG FRITZ IS THERE
[1:10:54] AND AND Fritz is licking his hand and
[1:10:57] and these are things that are happening
[1:10:58] to brother Bam when he goes beyond THE
[1:10:59] CURTAIN OF TIME. HE said there was Fritz
[1:11:01] there licking me on the hand. This is in
[1:11:02] the fifth when he tells this he says and
[1:11:04] just then I heard a voice and it cried
[1:11:06] out all that you ever loved.
[1:11:10] And he says reward for my service.
[1:11:13] Now think about that.
[1:11:15] Think about how special
[1:11:18] this is. This is the one place I could
[1:11:20] see where brother Bam gives us any
[1:11:22] details what a reward might be.
[1:11:24] I mean, I don't know if that gets you
[1:11:26] excited that there could be there or
[1:11:28] something. But this is remarkable,
[1:11:30] right? Because brother Bam isn't it's
[1:11:32] all that you loved.
[1:11:34] All that you ever loved and all that
[1:11:35] ever loved you, God has given you. And
[1:11:37] the only evidence that we have that it
[1:11:39] refers to was his pets, a horse and a
[1:11:41] dog.
[1:11:42] So we don't want to read too much into
[1:11:44] that, right? We don't want to read in
[1:11:44] and say, "Well, anybody that ever loved
[1:11:46] Brother Brandham's going to be there,
[1:11:47] right?" Because then we would all just
[1:11:48] want to fall in love with William
[1:11:49] Brandom.
[1:11:50] And you'd probably be sorely
[1:11:51] disappointed because that's not the
[1:11:53] qualification. He says, "All that you
[1:11:54] ever loved and all that ever loved you,
[1:11:56] God has given to you." It's this very
[1:11:57] specific scene that has taken place. And
[1:12:00] here's Fritz and here's Prince. And
[1:12:01] brother Bam says, "Reward for my
[1:12:04] service."
[1:12:05] Amen.
[1:12:08] God knows just how to reward
[1:12:12] his people.
[1:12:14] And so, Brother Brandham says, "Here I
[1:12:15] was when the crowns were being given out
[1:12:17] in this dream." He's standing there
[1:12:19] where the where these things are going
[1:12:20] to be given. And let me just read
[1:12:21] through. I might read through it just
[1:12:22] word for word or just make reference to
[1:12:24] it. It says, "And the great big throne
[1:12:26] set up there, and Jesus and the
[1:12:29] recording angel and all was standing
[1:12:31] there, and there were stairs, stair
[1:12:33] steps like coming down this way of white
[1:12:35] ivory running down in a circle and made
[1:12:37] a panoramic like this and went out so
[1:12:39] that all this great host standing out
[1:12:41] there could see what was happening." So,
[1:12:43] it was arranged to where this is in a
[1:12:44] dream now. And I believe in the dream,
[1:12:45] it's symbolic of this time, this moment
[1:12:48] when these rewards going to be given
[1:12:49] out, when the crowns are going to be
[1:12:50] given out. And he describes it as
[1:12:51] panoramic and the stairst steps where
[1:12:53] one would have to rise and ascend. And
[1:12:55] to me it's descriptive of that judgment
[1:12:57] seat of Christ, that raised place, this
[1:12:59] panoramic. Everyone can see this moment
[1:13:02] in this time. And I was standing over
[1:13:04] back to one side and I was just standing
[1:13:06] there, never an idea I had to walk them
[1:13:08] steps. I was standing there and I'd see
[1:13:09] a recording angel would call a certain
[1:13:11] name. And I recognized that name. And I
[1:13:13] looked way back out there and here come
[1:13:14] the brother walking or the sister walk
[1:13:16] up there like that. The recording angel
[1:13:18] there by the side of Christ. He says
[1:13:19] just a dream. Now I think he's wanting
[1:13:21] to recognize the symbolism of it and not
[1:13:24] the literalness. He says and watching
[1:13:26] and their names were on there and I
[1:13:28] found in the book of life he'd look out
[1:13:29] over there and say it is well done my
[1:13:31] good and faithful servant. Now enter in.
[1:13:34] It's a moment of validation. It's a
[1:13:36] moment of reckoning. Well done. You did
[1:13:38] it. Come up. Receive this. I looked back
[1:13:40] where they was going and there were new
[1:13:42] there was a new world and the joys. It
[1:13:44] said enter into the joys of the Lord
[1:13:46] that's been yours since the foundation
[1:13:47] of the world. And he talked about, "Oh,
[1:13:48] it's wonderful. I see people jumping up
[1:13:50] and down and to hear another name
[1:13:52] called. Oh, I know him. THERE HE GOES.
[1:13:54] WATCH HIM GO. ENTER IN THE JOYS OF THE
[1:13:55] LORD. OH MY, PRAISE GOD. JUST THINK."
[1:13:58] Just like they would say, "Orman
[1:13:59] Neville." And then that's old brother or
[1:14:01] Neville. There he is. And that's been
[1:14:03] prepared for you before the foundation
[1:14:04] of the world. Enter in. Oh, brother
[1:14:06] Neville just changed and just start back
[1:14:08] in there screaming and hollering. Boy, I
[1:14:09] would just shout AND SAY, "GLORY TO
[1:14:11] GOD."
[1:14:13] standing over here by myself having a
[1:14:15] wonderful time watching my brother go in
[1:14:17] and a recording angel stood and said
[1:14:18] William Brandham and I never thought I'd
[1:14:21] walk have to walk that so then I was
[1:14:23] scared I thought oh my like that hi
[1:14:25] brother Brandham God bless you brother
[1:14:26] Brandham pat him as I go saying how he
[1:14:28] is he's going through the great big
[1:14:29] crowd getting called up God bless you
[1:14:30] brother Brandon God bless you brother I
[1:14:31] was going thank you thank you thank you
[1:14:33] like coming out of a meeting or
[1:14:34] something you know and I was going to
[1:14:35] have to walk the these great big ivory
[1:14:40] steps
[1:14:41] and I started walking up through there.
[1:14:44] Just as I made the first step, I stopped
[1:14:47] and I looked at his face and I thought,
[1:14:50] I want to get a good look at him this
[1:14:51] way. And he stopped.
[1:14:55] It was his moment to answer.
[1:14:58] It was that time when crowns were being
[1:15:00] given out and he just stopped and he
[1:15:02] says, "I want to get a good look at
[1:15:03] him." Because this was his day of
[1:15:05] reckoning.
[1:15:06] He had a dream of that time. He said he
[1:15:08] would answer. And that moment that he
[1:15:10] would stand before him and have to
[1:15:11] answer. And that was the moment.
[1:15:14] He says, "It's just a dream now. It's
[1:15:15] just a dream." But he knew in the dream
[1:15:17] what it was referring to is that time
[1:15:19] when we'll all be gathered together to
[1:15:21] meet the Lord in the air and we'll stand
[1:15:23] before the judgment seat of Christ and
[1:15:24] receive our crowns.
[1:15:26] And so John writes in 1 John 2:28 says,
[1:15:28] "Now little children, we'll maybe use
[1:15:30] start with this the next time. abide in
[1:15:32] him that when he shall appear we shall
[1:15:35] have confidence
[1:15:37] and not be ashamed before him at his
[1:15:40] coming.
[1:15:41] What is it referring to? They that abide
[1:15:44] in him bring forth much fruit and there
[1:15:47] will be no shame before him at the
[1:15:48] judgment
[1:15:50] but we will have a reward.
[1:15:53] I'd like to invite the musicians to
[1:15:54] come.
