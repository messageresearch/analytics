the lord jesus christ amen praise the lord while we're standing i'd like to read from hebrews chapter 1 hebrews chapter 1 verses 1 to 13. and take just a little bit of a lengthy scripture reading here at the outset and in doing so mention some things that we won't come back to but yet it just it seems to capture just a full picture of jesus christ and some points that we want to visit this morning hebrews chapter 12 verses 1 to 13. happy belated christmas for those who might have missed christmas greetings and we're glad to see many at the hou in the house of the lord some who haven't been here in a while so we welcome you back uh so happy to see you i know that there's some that are traveling that are away several that aren't here this morning many that are streaming we trust that god would be with them and protect them and keep them safe as they travel happy new years to you if we don't see you this thursday instead of having a wednesday service we're having a watch night service on this thursday so we're moving wednesday to thursday if enough of you want a wednesday service we could still do that but we thought it might just be nice to move wednesday to thursday and have a watch night service at 10 o'clock here and uh we don't really have a program or anything we're just going to watch that night and so we're you're welcome to come but if you're not able to make it we say happy new year to you and we're looking forward to what god has in 2021 not just because we're leaving uh 2020 behind i mean just i saw somebody posted something that said just wait till 2020 turns 21. oh oh what do we have what do we have in store for us once it turns 21 but we just believe god has something great in store for us in the coming year i think it would be wonderful of what we what we have in 2021 as a meeting in the air amen could we all agree new bodies we're all 18 to 21 years old i think it would be wonderful the eternal youth meeting would be kicked off with the meeting in the air that's what i'm looking forward to hebrews chapter 1 verses 1 to 13 god who at sundry times and in diverse manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the worlds who being the brightness of his glory and the expressed image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high being made so much better than the angels as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they for unto which of the angels said he at any time thou art my son so this is he's asking kind of the record rhetorical question at what time is he asking told an angel or said an angel thou art my son this day have i begotten thee and again i will be to him a father and he shall be to me a son and again when he bringeth in the first begotten into the world he saith and let all the angels of god worship him and of the angels he saith who maketh his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire but under the sun he saith thy throne o god is forever and ever a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of thy kingdom thou hast loved righteousness and hated iniquity therefore god even thy god hath appointed the anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows and thou lord in the beginning has laid the foundation of the earth and the heavens are the works of thine hands they shall perish but thou remainest and they all shall wax old as death the garment and as a vestureth shalt thou fold them up and they shall be chained they shall be changed so he's speaking of even the changing of the heavens and the earth but thou art the same and thy years shall not fail but to which of the angels saith he at any time sit on my right hand until i make thine enemies thy footstool oh my what remarkable words paul is using to the hebrews to get them to thinking about who this christ is so desire god would bless these scriptures that we've read you may be seated we continue on the subject of god created and i realize um i get as the as i'm looking into these things and studying them they can just seem very very fresh because they're newly inspired and recently inspired and the whole subject to me can seem as if it's new inspiration and we're looking at something new for the first time and then i kind of take a step back and i begin to look at a few things and i realized well uh we've been ministering on this subject uh and vain staying very tight to certain scriptures in the beginning of the of the bible in genesis chapter one uh through even chapter four some very consistent themes that we've been looking at and so this morning i realized well i'm repeating and probably revisiting a lot of familiar themes even scriptures and quotations and this morning i want to revisit specifically some principles from a couple of earlier parts and um i can't recall just offhand where there was a couple things that we uh mentioned and didn't go into great detail on but i felt just to continue on where we were last time um and then go back and pick up just a couple scriptures and maybe some statements we had used a couple months ago and a few services ago and revisit them in greater detail and in doing so my burden is that we would see christ would come into plainer view i believe we're all looking at him and he's becoming sweeter to us he's becoming more real but we realize that there's still greater clarity and a more perfect understanding that we can have of christ and that would be my desire in ministering i i believe that one of the uh greatest things that could happen as we listen to the word is we fall in love with christ all over again um that there's something rekindled and something fresh that's inspired inside of us so we'd want christ to come into plainer view and also my burden is that and in revisiting some of these things and it's not going to be don't kind of brace yourself for just a repeat uh but in revisiting some particular things and emphasizing things again the burden is that you it would be able to become more personal and maybe for some of us for the first time personal that the word would become very personal to us or more personal and i pondered this and i realized it's easy and i think we could all agree it's very easy to read the bible to this to listen to the prophet preach these things and teach these things about the bride and it's very easy to believe it about the bride they say yes that's we believe that we believe that but it's it's important that you believe it about yourself there's no bride without you i'm not talking about how you spell it i'm just saying there's no you maybe you could look and say there's no bride without i right there's an eye in bride there's got to be really for to mean something to you uh you want to catch the personal revelation that you the eye is in the middle of this bride that you're part of it and because i find that we can often times you find out somebody's sick you know you know what i just believe god can heal you and i believe you're going to be made well and we can believe for somebody else but then when it's our own difficulty our own trial try to place ourselves in the promise it's a little bit more difficult and it's so important not that you just believe these things are true about the bride but that you believe them about yourself that you are a part of this and and not believing about this person or that person but rather you see yourself being positionally placed within the body of christ you recognize that the work of god is for you personally that he which have begun this work it's a work he's begun in you when you begin to think about in the beginning god created it's something he had thoughts about you not about this just this bride and we're like oh the bride is fantastic the bride is marvelous the bride is sinless the bride is perfect the bride will never fall and the bride is justified and the bride is going to conquer every sin and the brian has perfect faith and then you're not part of it listen a perfect bride cannot be made up of imperfect members you can't have a bride with perfect faith and then all of us just kind of kind of luke warm no whatever speaks of the bride speaks of you individually you've got to believe it for yourself and so that's my real uh real the real burden that's being placed upon my heart and revisiting some of this is not to look at it so much from the the standpoint of the bride but for christ to come into plainer view and as he comes into plain of you you recognize your position in christ now let's look at revelations chapter 3 verse 14 as we just took a few moments there to kind of set the foundation in revelations chapter 3 verse 14 i'm picking up with the thought we were looking at last time about jesus christ being the beginning of the creation of god and then i'm going to use a few uh new quotations and maybe and then a couple familiar ones or at least one that we used before just to see how brother branham identified who the beginning of the creation of god was he says and under the angel of the church of the laodiceans right now this is the address to the seventh church age and what he's about to say is remarkable because now that he's speaking to the last church age he's going to signify the end of the ages and how the god's ultimate purpose and his cr and what he was desiring to do is going to be finished at the end of the seventh church age she says under the angel of the uh of the church of the laodiceans right these things say the amen which is the last now it's the finishing the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god so by bringing in this phrase the beginning of the creation of god it does he's not referred to this uh in these addressed to the churches until the last age and it's signaling that now what god has begun is going to be finished we're nearing the end now with the very purpose of god it with creation and brother branham makes this statement referring to this scripture in the future home he says the holy blood that was created by god the blood the life the creation of god jesus was the beginning of the creation of god so when god began to form within the womb of mary jesus christ the body of jesus christ this was not gentile blood it was not joseph's blood it wasn't mary's blood he didn't use any elements of the flesh of man of any kind but god began to form within the womb of mary a son which was going to have the blood of god the dna of god he was deity from birth amen why because god took the word and began to form within the womb of a virgin flesh and it's genesis i mean i just wonder if they could take a dna test they look and go well this is different because it was not it wouldn't have bore any resemblance to some other markers that humans would have had but yet it was something that god was creating it was divine it was deity being formed within the womb of a virgin so the holy blood that was created by god and brother brahman says does this begin to form jesus is the beginning of the creation of god and he says god made in creation he was spirit the bible said he is the beginning of the creation of god how did he begin in the womb of a woman so that this is looking at a very specific expression of god's creation or god creating himself and it comes into view now it's going to be expressed through jesus christ now we know there has been creation before this in the beginning god created but all of this is foreshadowing and leading up to this expression in jesus christ so all these other things had to be here in order for christ or god even himself to have reason and purpose of being for him to express himself because god cannot be expressed fully expressed outside of redemption so the momentum of everything was coming to this place but now this is something distinct this is something supernatural he says god being a spirit is now going to be expressed in the flesh now skipping to a later part this is just a few paragraphs several paragraphs later in the same message but she received seed now speaking of the woman what was it god himself he was the beginning of the creation of god now let's we can we can admit that when it comes to the godhead there's somewhat of a paradox and that that's why you know trinitarianism and a lot of these other isms try to explain the godhead but god is one but yet god being one expressed himself in his son and then the son helps us to understand god becoming in god's desire because he says father i pray that they also you and i would be one even as the son and the father were one so we realize that there's something to the expression of god and the oneness that god has with the son we are also invited to share in that so the oneness is god's not one like your fingers one there's something something particular about this godhead and then it's even the oneness like your fingers one the trinitarians say well you have three parts to your finger and you have this part this part this part and they have this uh multiple personalities and multiple persons that make one and i had a friend who'd gone to theological school trying to explain it to me and he said you know really we can't ever we can't fully understand the trinity because it would be like if we lived in a one-dimensional world and a three-dimensional object dropped down into it you wouldn't be able to relate to it when he was done i said that's just really that's just kind of kind of some weak sauce there my friend and i think he kind of admitted it but we can we are to know god and know him as the one true god the lord is one but now god this one god who formed himself into the logos still spiritual still supernatural is now becoming flesh in jesus christ it's not another god and he's coming becoming flesh and it's god himself that's being expressed so then now skipping several paragraphs again paragraph 3 58 the germ of god the life of god was designed in the womb of a woman which was the earth and then the life of god come in so he was the beginning of the creation of god so the germ of god is formed in designed in the womb of a woman and this woman representing the earth she came from the earth and then the life of god comes in he was the beginning of the creation of god in this mernian church age revisiting the same the same principle god come down in a blood cell not through a man but by the holy ghost and in that virgin womb a tabernacle for the purpose of death was built that's a heavy phrase a tabernacle for the purpose of death my cup runeth over glory you know there was that much much water in that one i can go longer the more water i have so this is really good so a tabernacle for the purpose of death was built the seat of the woman came that's bringing us to genesis 3 15. the seed of the woman came in order that he be bruised to bring us our salvation when the holy ghost came upon mary he created within her womb the cell that would multiply and become the body of our lord that cell was created it was the beginning of the creation of god that is who jesus is and that holy one was filled with holy blood even the blood of god that tabernacle came to birth and notice he grew to be a man this is remarkable to see that god designed it this way that god had it come forth this way the very tabernacle which was built for the purpose of death it is built by the very spoken word of god it is god's word being made flesh materializing in this body which is jesus the son of god then this it was the blood of god the holy one was filled with holy blood and that's what brother adam identified when we talked about the deity of jesus christ he specifically identified the fact that he was the blood of god and he says this it came to birth then it we scripture tells us he increased in stature and wisdom and favor with god and man and this is the son of god the sinless one the perfect one increasing that becomes a lesson to us that there's that he's being made he's growing he's coming into his own expression of perfection he grew to be a man and then this one who is filled with the blood of god this divine one this deity one he has there comes a time when the logos now comes and steps into this body for his ministry at 30 years old when he comes to the jordan river to be baptized and now the word is fully made flesh in jesus christ brother branham in the message seed of discrepancy says jesus christ for he was the seed of god he was the beginning of the creation of god he was nothing less than god this is the beginning of the creation of god jesus christ this comes in the middle of the book the momentum from in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth you could just imagine that everything was building for this climactic expression of this messiah this redeemer this one jesus christ god himself now the beginning of the creation of god how was it that god just kind of hid this plan and let it lay dormant and hid it from the wise and prudent and now he comes forth his the beginning of himself being made manifest himself being expressed though foreshadowed in creation now it's coming to its perfection and it's a little baby laying in a manger in the message why it had to be shepherds and i believe we read this statement last time he started a new creation what was it a creation of himself actually this i think this statement we didn't read last time maybe but he started a new creation a creation of himself now keep that in mind a new creation so this is something it's not the same creation where you're doing the same thing you can you can make pancakes uh for breakfast and then you do the same thing the next morning it's the same recipe it's the same elements and you wouldn't say oh a new creation your kids would say uh we had that yesterday yeah but it's new pancakes i real i get that it's different pancakes but it's the same process it's the same elements it's the same it's the same pancakes we're eating the same thing no we're not eating the same thing you ate those those are this is something new it's the same it's the same thing just repeat it again but now this is a new creation it it it's nothing that had been done before a creation of himself god was made flesh and dwelt among us the bible said in the beginning of the creation of god god was created in human form in jesus christ his son god dwelt so now this is god in human form now just remember some of the statements we've been reading over the last few months about how the bride is god in human form so you see the the symmetry now to when we say things about the bride we're not you can't say anything about the bride that wouldn't be represented in christ she's not greater than christ she is who she is because of christ god created a human form in jesus christ his son god dwelt he built his tabernacle of flesh and bones and lived in that tabernacle god emmanuel god with us he built himself a house to live in it so he could reflect his word to his subjects through that and we did read this last time you know what god is when you see christ you know what god is when you see christ you want to know god you can only know him as the son reveals him so you know what god is when you see christ so now god is going to become known he's not going to be the unknown god he's not just going to be the god that thundered upon the mountain he's not just going to be the god that gave commandments to moses he's not going to be just remain this mysterious one but through jesus christ god is going to become and i want to be careful maybe even saying this but god can be apprehended ultimately as paul said i desire to apprehend as i am apprehended as god fully knows and understands me through jesus christ god can begin to be known and through a process of revealing himself we can come to a place where we can apprehend him oh to know him it's beautiful jesus christ the beginning of the creation of god now in colossians chapter 1 verse 15. speaking of christ says who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature now i want to take this phrasing here and i want to and i want to kind of take the image and look at that a little bit when it says who is the image of the invisible god the first born of every creature him being the beginning of the creation of god this must be a greater or more perfect creation than what had prior that had been previously he is the image of the invisible god so when christ becomes the creation of god or god created himself it's the creation of something greater now that you could say this is my thesis statement that jesus christ the beginning of the creation of god it was ushering in something greater than what had been created previously and when god created as we read through it in genesis chapter one when god began to create it says that he saw that it was good and he expresses this six different times as he as he goes through each day of creation he sees it and it's expressed at different points in each day or at different times and god does something but six different times god sees what he has spoken into creation and what has come to be and he says he saw that it was good which means excellent it means agreeable it means pleasant or pleasing to god god saw that it was good this is pleasing to me god could very well say he saw god saw that it was pleasing to himself that it pleased him for this to be expressed this way and then in genesis chapter 1 verse 31 it says then god saw everything that he had made and behold because now he's coming to the end of creation he sees everything that he had made and behold it was very good so god could create something god says let there be light and there's light and god said that's good now was it this is the light by the spoken word this is perfect light no no no weakness in it no no nothing defile in it nothing uh nothing about it that would be imperfect he calls it good because it was a perfect creation let there be light this is perfect light it's shining but now god looks at the process as it's unfolded and he looks at it and it's not just good it's very good exceedingly greatly good so you can have good which means it's not bad and not in a dismissive sense when somebody's how is that you know that's not bad and you say and if you say good it's something that there's not bad in it god saw and it was good but now it's exceedingly or greatly good now ponder this again as we're just referring back to some things that we've mentioned over the last several services in genesis chapter 1 verse 27 god made man or man was made in god's image and after the bible says after god's likeness and so man's made in the image of god after god's likeness so there's a holy image that adam possesses and there's a likeness or resemblance that he has but yet still being in that image and after that likeness there was still a more perfect image that could come forward and be expressed and we saw that in genesis chapter 3 verse 22 where after adam had taken of the tree of knowledge of good and evil god actually makes this declaration that man has become as one of us so though he was made in the image of god and after his likeness adam did something and then knew something that made him more like god and god said he's become like us not perfectly like us otherwise he would he could not have died but he says he's become as one of us to know something so this knowledge brought him into a further expression of god are more like god and then it says lest he put forth his hand and take of the tree of life and live forever we need to guard the tree of life so he saw that though adam was made in the image of god and after his likeness there was a more perfect image or knowledge or understanding or expression that could still come forth so there was still yet a more perfect image not expressed by adam so christ who is in the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature in colossians chapter 1 verse 19 says for it please the father that in him should all fullness dwell so in creation god said it is good it is good it's pleasing it is pleasing and displeasing he looks at all of creation he says this is very pleasing but now with christ again this pleasure this being agreeable he says for please the father we can say it was exceedingly and greatly pleasing that in christ should all fullness completeness dwell so now this is christ this is a different expression than adam because adam we could adam the fullness of god did not dwell in adam though he was in the image of god and after the likeness of god it pleased god it was pleasing to god it was after his desire his purpose and his will that not in adam but in christ all the fullness would dwell so then christ is as it says in verse 15 he is the image of the invisible god the exact likeness so it says he is the image of the invisible god god remained invisible though man made after his image or in his image and after his likeness was clearly tangible and visible god remained invisible so there's a distinction now being made how that christ is now the exact likeness or the perfect representation of god and you'll find that even in the hebrew and as you think about it just think about our language and how we would use something an image is greater than the likeness adam was created in the image of god but christ perfectly expressed the invisible god christ expressed glories that the first adam only in part represented or only in shadow expressed this is part of my thesis adam in the beginning expressed certain glories and had certain things but yet christ now expresses glories and expresses things and does things that adam only was expressing in shadow or type or in part because christ who is the image of god when it speaks of this and we come to later places where paul is continuing to write to understand who christ is and his difference from adam to say he is in the image of the invisible god this image speaks of more than a resemblance because it relates to coming from the original if you could think of it this way like a child becomes the living image of a parent and you say well he that's the image he now possesses the life the dna he's come forth he says he looks like his parents why he is now in the image of his parents it's not just somebody who looks like so-and-so but he's in the image of it the image of something would be looking in a mirror or a reflection in the water when you see your reflection of what you said that's my image why because it is you being reflected but then you see something in the clouds you go oh that looks like a lion that's likeness because it's not an image when you look in the mirror it's not a likeness it's the image i want you this is an important principle to catch the the the image and likeness is one thing but to be in the image of the invisible god it speaks of more than a resemblance a likeness is merely a resemblance a likeness isn't literally derided from the original you could use the original as a pattern and it can be like it it's not but there's no derivative from an original an image is derived from the original a likeness is merely a resemblance of an original but an image is the expression or the reflection of it you have the original and then a reflection it comes from it it's in the image of it like a son comes forth and he's part of that original father he's in the image of his father but then you could run into somebody said man if i didn't know better you just you look just like brother so-and-so and they say brother who i don't know him not related to him even brother david was at the beginning of service or not at the beginning of service but when we were coming in this morning he comes in and he points to brother michael and he says he goes now i don't know this young man he goes but he's in the image he might even use those very words he's the expressed image of his father what because the characteristics that he would have that we'd be akin to brother paul you say yeah i could see brother paul jenkins in and the way that he looks and and especially this morning when he said it i don't know if your beard's just coming to the place when it accentuates it or what i was like you know what i can see that i can absolutely see that and you see now he's not doesn't just look like him because he's derived from brother paul what has he become he's in the image of him oh man that's just exciting this is really good stuff brother aaron the image is the expression of something it's derived from the original or the reflection of it so it's directly connected to there has to be an original that's being portrayed and let's express this in john chapter 1 verse 18 no man hath seen god at any time the only begotten son so at this point he's the only birth begotten son which is in the bosom of the father so now it speaks to his heart purpose origination this is where he comes from he comes from the bosom of the father the only begotten son he hath declared him so no man had seen god the expression of god they can see his backside they can see types and shadows there could be ways that he's represented even in flesh but to see god no man had seen god at any time but now the only begotten son is declaring the invisible god because he's the image of the invisible god he's the reflection of the invisible god not just a likeness in something that resembles him he is the image of the invisible god and the bible says he have declared him it's not just a snapshot jesus wasn't a snap of god that would kind of go away after a while and you better be sure to take a screenshot so you can keep it no this is something that to declare means to unfold as a narrative you would have to watch him and keep your eyes focused on him and you'd see him unfold and as he speaks and as he moves and as he makes himself known god is unfolding as a narrative so you can't just take a snapshot of jesus distributing bread and say well in that the fullness of god has expressed no you've got to keep your eyes on him you've got to keep focused on him you have to stay connected to him because it's through christ that god is declared he unfolds as a narrative i'm so glad that we're walking in this today that god is unfolding to us as the bride of jesus christ as a narrative as i listen to brother branham preach go christ is unfolding to me as a narrative as we come together and sit under the preach of the word god is unfolding to me as a narrative as i watch your life as i hear of testimonies as i see healings as we fellowship together god is unfolding as a narrative it's becoming known to us being declared and so as we come to hebrews chapter one we'll pull from it verses two to six as he's talking about jesus christ and lord laid the foundations of the heavens and the earth they'll be folded up and they'll be changed just as a garment that waxes old but god is the same and he said to his son thy throne is forever the scepter of righteousness is the scepter of thy kingdom he's speaking of jesus christ and it says this god now verse two god hath in these last days spoken to us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of all things now as a son he has been appointed god making this divine appointment this ordination by whom also he made the worlds who being the brightness of his glory christ now is the brightness of god's glory who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of this person and upholding all things by the word of his power when he hath by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high so now god is expressed through his son christ is the brightness of god's glory he's the expressed image of god and the holding of all things by his power when he had by himself purged our sins and god by himself purged our sins through the creation of god the beginning of the creation of a god created a man god created a body because we know this is again the paradox of the god god cannot die so he created his son jesus christ he is now through the the purge by the shedding of his own blood he purges our sins he's raised up seat at the right hand of majesty on high verse 4 being made so much better than the angels now the bible actually says being made lower than the angels right speaking of the condescension down to flesh being made lower than the angels as we see some sort of hierarchy in realms and dimensions but now he's saying even though he came as a man in the image of a man he's made so much better than the angels this places him differently in the the economy of god as he hath by inheritance well how is it because he's a son that's appointed he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they this is god's plan this is god's will this is the way god established it if we in the flesh drew up a will or we could say i want all of this to go to this person i want all this to go here this one gets my estate it's by appointment by inheritance by what's been ordained he has been by god's own divine ordinance he's obtained a more excellent name than the angels for under which are the angels that any time thou art my son this day have i begotten thee they were beings that were created by god but now he he an angel doesn't share in what jesus christ says he is a begotten son and again i will be to him a father and he shall be to me a son and again when he bringeth in the first begotten into the world he said and let all the angels of god worship him christ obtaining the more excellent name than of the angels and he is the brightness of god's glory the express image of his person christ is the image of the invisible god not just a likeness we can see likenesses even in the old testament characters we can see a likeness of god in adam but now this is the express image of his person the bible calling in colossians 1 15 he says the first born of every creature this is god's firstborn and being the firstborn this is god's rule and this is god's law in the beginning that being the first born of god he now becomes heir of all things the firstborn of every creature speaks of dominion the government shall be upon his shoulders it speaks of him uh uh his his dominion his government is going to be his it speaks of him being the highest rank the firstborn in a family and this is why with god this was god's rule in god's law from the beginning and then we see it expressed in israel the law of the firstborn and that's where you find and this is uh actually you know i just thinking about it i think man praise the lord i probably could have an opportunity to minister on it brother of another says the law of adoption the law of adoption it refers to the old testament the law of adoption in the old testament but and and you don't necessarily you can't go back in the scripture and find specifically it says this is the law of adoption what was it it's the law of the firstborn therein you see the law of adoption the first born son would be heir to all things and if his conduct and his character remained in harmony with that of the father he would become heir of all that the father had that's the law of adoption you say well where do you get that from look at reuben who by his character and by his actions was disinherited that's the law of adoption he remained a son but he lost something and so now we could look back and see god always had this law on this principle that the firstborn all government is going to be his the firstborn of god is going to have dominion he's going to be heir of all things he's going to obtain all things he's going to be the most preeminent he's going to be the highest one in rank he is going to be the one that's going to receive me and be in my stead this is going to be the son so adam was not the first born from god jesus christ was and you look to the old testament and it's always pointing to the law of the firstborn which now is made manifest in scripture says the first begotten or the only begotten the first born of every creature and so the psalms actually speaks of it prophesies it 80 psalm 89 27 also i will make him my firstborn higher than the kings of the earth speaking of this i will make him he will be created the firstborn higher than the kings of the earth and to the jews the word firstborn was synonymous to king if you said firstborn it was the preeminent one the one highest in rank and that's why you even see in monarchies that's the first born son is going to be the heir to the throne that's why it was so it'd be so important to have a son because he then becomes the heir and you know your domain your kingdom your name the son becomes the bearer of the family name he obtains that name he obtains the inheritance and he goes forward as a builder and continue to build that legacy and a builder of the family name this is all contained in the language in the words of the hebrews and even within their kingdoms this son is going to come forth he's going to be a king so to a jew to say firstborn spoke of the preeminent one a king a great one it even speaks of prince now i know that we're maybe thrown off a little bit by the united kingdom because you have the queen of england and then you have the princes and you have so many different princes and then you're like well you have prince william and you have this prince prince henry and you have uh i don't know all that maybe you can just start naming traditional names george and henry and all these they're the princes right and not princesses but they're princes and you still have princesses and we think oh king queen prince but there's something about the word prince in scripture got to be careful doesn't mean a junior to the king in revelations 1 5 think about this if we take the united kingdom queen of england approach to this you get things really backwards and from jesus christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth you read that with the carnal understanding say oh isn't that nice all these kings have a little prince isn't that cute but the word prince there means the chief the ruler the leader he's the prince of the kings of the he's the chief of the kings he's the commander of the kings he's the greatest of all the king he has a more excellent glory than all the kings wow he's the firstborn he's the king of kings that's what it means he's the prince he's the prince of peace that doesn't mean the devil's the king of peace he's the prince he's the leader he's the commander he's the highest nobody else has power over your peace he alone has power over it give yourselves to him claim it yes he's the prince he's the command he's the leader of the kings that's what it means when he's the image of the invisible god the express image of his person the firstborn the king of every creature so in christ who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature in him it pleased the father that all the fullness of god would dwell who'll be in the brightness of his glory the expressed image of his person the first begotten into the world he says when he bringeth the first begotten into the world all the angels of god were to worship him we looked at it last sunday matthew chapter 1 verse 18. now the birth of jesus christ was on this wise when as his mother mary was espoused to joseph before they came together she was found with child of the holy ghost the birth of jesus christ to beget the to engender the genesis the genos the genes of jesus christ he has begotten his birth god is developing them god is creating again now there's and we looked at the birth of jesus christ is on this wise it's in contrast to all the other begets that we see in genesis matthew chapter one uh those first several 16 verses there so and so begat so and so begat but now jesus christ is not the product of a man and a woman therefore he comes from the man and joseph begat jesus christ not mentioned it has to change the narrative because now god who is the holy ghost the child within mary is the creation of god god is engineering god's genesis the genes of god are now being projected into this sinless flesh who bypasses the original sin god is developing blood cells god this is such an incredible moment god by the original spoken word of genesis 1 28 god is creating again and in creating again it's the redemption of the creation that fell god's not starting all over had god wanted to start all over he could have just taken that seed and said all right another galaxy or he could have just planned it that way i'll create uh i'll create the milky way and i'll have an earth there and we'll start we'll see where that goes but i'll also have a snickers galaxy over here so that if something goes wrong over here in the milky way then i could just take the word there in the milky way and place it over on the earth and the snickers galaxy and there we can get our our creation that's perfect how come so many chocolate bars or things in the galaxies they're named after chocolate you've got mars you've got sn wait wait it's not a snickers galaxy that's just creation of my own hey brother the bible says you the word that we have go create a world and live on it i've just created the snickers galaxy glory all that chocolatey nutty goodness the milky way doesn't have nuts right that's that's not really a type this galaxy's full of nuts now there's two things i want to mention very quickly before we go forward because god is creating again and this is this is part of this thesis the principles of creation let me say this way the principles of redemption require that it be greater that what's coming forth is greater because that's the mystery of redemption that it's it's when it's when it's brought back it achieves a greater glory and we see that's just the principle of this body when it's redeemed is not just going to be the same body it can get sick and die right it's going to be glorified and so the redemption of our souls didn't put us in a state to where it could fall again it's sealed right can never can never be defiled never be corrupt so the principle of redemption then when something has fallen and been redeemed in redemption is an expression of something greater and that's a prince that's one of the mysteries of redemption because redemption is not i got sick to get sick again that's not redemption that's healing so the redemption of something to it the redemption of our body is to not put us in a body that could then get sick and die again so there's something great this is the glory to be revealed in us so redemption requires and necessitates something greater so that's the principle of redemption that requires something greater then the principles of creation also require that if god creates a new then it's greater than the prior creation if god creates again it's greater and this is where i'm i'm referring back to some principles maybe we'd mentioned before but i'm going to take more time just to kind of nail this down tight so the message why it had to be shepherds god says god is fixing to make another creation he's creating mortal earth mortal life angels sing in heaven so in the beginning when god created mortal earth mortal life the angels were singing in heaven but here he's creating new life so another creation new life not adam's life now it's not gonna be adam's life living in a body that wasn't uh uh made through the combination of a man and a woman it's new altogether new life eternal life for man and he's singing to his subjects through angels on earth not in heaven heaven had eternal life they sang to the heavens when the mortal creation come in and here the immortal creation is coming in and now they're singing to earthly people so it's another creation it's different it's distinct from the prior creation that god had had that god had brought forth and that involves now this this god is fixing to make another creation because it's distinct from the prior because it's distinct from the difference the prior creation and it being different it evokes something about god a law of god comes into play there's something about god now if he's creating something new there's a characteristic of god that's made manifest now this is drawing on a lot of things that we've tried to make very plain in the in the word creation is an expression of the invisible god brotherhood is teaching us this that the creation is an expression of the creator so as a creator creates he with each creation it's moving closer to his full expression so an artist could create something and said that expresses something about the artist but the more you have of his work the more you understand his thought process and his style you can look at one pain he says well what do you think an impressionist what's your thoughts on this say well it kind of favors this a little bit but then you see the nectar say okay i kind of see maybe something developing and then you see the next one the next one and you look at the body of work and you can even see some evolution and style and and refinement of certain characters are honing in on a particular way that an artist wants to express themselves and you look at the whole body of work and you say this is who this person is and so god is not just merely one who creates uh who just does one little thing say oh there's all of god but if god creates something he's expressing his creation if he creates again he's expressed in that creation and so go as with each creation it's moving full to a fuller expression of the creator we read a statement that brother branham said when god's creating from the smallest form and the single cell organism uh those are my words but god created from the very beginning the first few cells and as he begin to create uh with more cells and more cells and comes out with the polywog or a frog and then evolutes up and creates another he says god working in a pattern that's the phrase he uses god working in the pattern he says kind of a evolution rising praise higher in another place looking at how god created in the beginning he says making something greater and greater he makes this statement they kept getting higher blood higher form of life higher form till it climbs up into the man realm so higher blood higher form of life until it climbed up into the the man realm now remember brother abraham is saying that the blood of jesus christ isn't the blood of man so he say higher blood if you start out with the blood of a frog and then if in just and you evolved up he said higher blood higher blood higher blood higher life and you come to this form of a man if god ever created another blood would he drop back that wouldn't be the nature of god if god creates a new blood it's got to be higher each the expression then as god climbs up into the man realm the expression evolved with each creation it says greater higher greater higher so when god created the monkey the monkey was perfect it's perfect you have nothing else to compare it to it's the evolution of perfection it's evolved up to that but then when it takes another step perfections evolved the frog was perfect but with another creation it became more perfect became more excellent it was good it was good it was good it was pleasing and pleasing and so it's an evolution of god creating in the message the serpent seed brother man said the highest form because it evolves climbs up into the man realm the highest form is the human being god started at the bottom and made right up until he brought plum into his image brought it from the birds and the beast and on until he got to the image of god he made man in that image that's the highest form so man in creation man was the highest form now when i read these you might feel like brother aaron you're kind of building a box to impeach yourself just stick with it this just notice this principle's got to be understood as god creates when he comes to the man that's the highest form why because that was the last creation he says and after in the message mark of the beast and the sill of god after a while brewed a little more god brooding over the earth what come out next was probably the flowers and vegetations and the birds flew out of the dust of the earth and then come the animal life and kept getting higher life higher life higher life higher life until finally a man come up in the very image of god highest form higher life higher life it keeps evolving involving evolving in the message conferences he kept getting greater greater greater greater so it's great it's greater greater greater greater greater and finally the earth reflected the reflection of him that was brooding so this is now a likeness that we see in the earth because god looked upon man he sees a likeness or an expression of himself he says the the like is the reflection of him that was brooding god and he was in the image of god never did anything come higher than a man even to our beloved sisters a woman she's not in the original creation so brother branham deals with this in a few other places he says in flashing red light the last creative being that god ever created was a man a woman is a byproduct from a man and the reason why brother benham goes through this uses this language and you'll find that in the the sermons where he's referring to this it's to make the expression to make it understood that the woman was not a new creation god created man and then man was the highest form man was the highest life man was in the light after the likeness of god and had the image of god upon him if the holy image that he loses when he falls but then he didn't then create the woman because had he created the woman next she would have been greater it would have been a higher life so then he takes from the original adam and he makes a woman who's the same material as adam he separates her out so now she is not greater than adam and we've heard it expressed in the marriage ceremony that he didn't take a heel bone so the woman would be under the feet he didn't take the head a bone from the head that she would rule over man but he took something from his side because she's a counterpart she's co-equal it's the it's the highest life but now she's a further expression of the same life the same flesh the same blood had god just created something new she would have been greater it'd have been a higher blood because god doesn't bat god doesn't fall back it's the devil that did that it's the devil that corrupted the devils defiled and weakened the nations so if god had created eve apart from adam it would have been a greater creation because whenever god creates anew it is greater because god's an evolutionist god evolves in his creating if it's if he creates something and it's the same as what's been created already then it's not a new creation he's made pancakes again same recipe same element same image same expression so now in the message power of transformation so now you can see how this evolved to where man after the likeness of god god achieved something in man he says i'm going to stop right there because that's the highest form that i want it to evolve to but notice how god brother bannon places it it come like by evolution power of transformation like he was learning more all the time like he was learning all time and that's what science says you know what all these elements now evolve and it takes some of the same characteristics but now you have a different life a higher life they see that he says making something greater and greater he says but see now this is the image i want you to catch he was above it all right there's a statement that i thought i had had that i'd used at one time and i've it's been several years now where i haven't been able to find it so maybe i'm kind of giving up that it was there but it was something that where brother man expresses this thought that god is always moving to the kingdom it's a momentum and god is always moving to express the perfect god is moving to express the eternal there's a light that shines and it shines what more and more as unto a perfect day it's it's not an imperfect light but god is always moving to perfection he's always moving to full expression and so now when you see this trajectory or this image that's being expressed something greater something higher higher higher higher greater greater greater greater greater then he makes this statement god's above it all so then you see like this almost like a thermometer or some kind of something that's being measured as it evolves up he was above it all and just let it evolve up to that so he stops at man everything he began to bring upon the earth from botany life and fish and so forth come on into birds and animals and then something in his own image a man and stop there because it was up to his perfection of what he wanted at the time what god wanted because he had this place creation in a particular state that it would express something about his character but then satan had to come and defile it to create a sin to deform the creation because then he says when satan accomplished what was necessary so god allowed it this is now it's evolved up to what he wanted this is god above it all he lets it evolute up to that but we know adam is not god he's like god he's in the image of god there's a likeness now there is there's a mold where god has now taken himself and he's created a likeness which is a resemblance in the earth now you could still use the same language of image and likeness but now brother branham says the holy image of god leaves adam when he falls so that's taken away but when you come to image and likeness in the new testament when the christ is the expressed image of his person or the image of the invisible god that's something different than what adam was so now listen to this statement in the message it wasn't so from the beginning he says i'd like for science to answer this one if there's such a thing as evolution and they claim it came some other way they claim it could come some other way why don't something rise higher than a man we have no species higher than a man so brother graham's identifying this species homo sapien er nothing higher than a man because he's in the image of god but then he makes this statement nothing can go beyond its creator so god then as he creates is above it all and he lets it evolute up to man so then man is the highest the next is god god is above it all higher blood higher form of life higher form greater greater higher life higher life higher life higher life until finally it comes into the realm of man here comes the man who comes in the image of god so now god has created up to where he has a resemblance he's god here's the resemblance he says nothing can go beyond its creator so now the phrase the beginning of the creation of god has to take on new life to us now god brought man up to a likeness and an expression but he was not the creator he was in the likeness of the creator man cannot go beyond his creator the beginning of the creation of god is the creator the beginning of the creation of god jesus christ then is the last evolution of god into himself because it's god creating himself in the beginning of the creation of god god becoming tangible god becoming flesh and it can't go beyond its creator but it's come to its creator the becoming god has become in jesus christ so then there's so many statements we could use here but let's just use one from the message lean not unto thy own understanding jesus was a virgin born son and was not altogether a man but he was god the god man and he was more than a man he was a man plus adam was a man adam man jesus christ is a man plus what was he adam plus god amen it evolved up to the perfection that god wanted but now in jesus christ man becomes god or better yet god becomes man that's he called a god man more than a man he calls him a man plus now we could read dozens dozens of quotations to you to emphasize that but we realize this is something that god had become so now let's look at this statement i try not to say so now so often in the church age book chapter 9 the laodicean church age says as he stands there revealing who he is in this last age this is to support what we've just shown you higher blood higher form of life higher form god is fixing to make another creation here he's creating a new life immortal life is coming in so this is a this is even higher higher than what adam had as he stands there revealing who he is in this last age he calls himself the author of the creation of god which is the beginning of the creation of god this is another creation this has to do with the church this is a special designation of himself he is the creator of that church the heavenly bridegroom created his own bride now in the image of adam and the woman where did the woman come from from adam so where is this bride come from she's not in a sandbox and god just kind of creating some that's what the earth was that's what adam was that's what creation was but when the woman come forth she came forth from adam not in another sandbox when the bride comes forth god's not using another galaxy another sandbox it's the same material as the groom so he says the bride the same as the groom so this is a special designation of himself designed from himself he is the creator of that church the heavenly bridegroom created his own bride as the spirit of god he came down and created in the virgin mary the cells from which his body was born i want to repeat that he created the very cells in the moon of mary for that body it was not enough for the holy spirit to simply give life to human ovum supplied by mary that would have been sinful mankind producing a body this would not have produced the last adam it would have produced something like the original adam of him it was says lo a body thou father prepared for me god not mary provided that body mary was the human incubator she carried that holy child and brought him to birth it was a god man he was the son of god he was the new creation man and god met and joined he was the first of this new race he is the head of this new race adam represents uh and maybe race might confuse us a little bit because we think of ethnicity this is not ethnicity this is not culture this is a new species this is something god evolved god evolved and he made man pure man full man full homo sapien adam represents humanity represents from from the earth and he and it represents life and a triumph being but now the next step in the evolution of god's creation in the next creation was the beginning of the creation of god it is a new creation man and god now meet the capping of the the capstone it's the capstone now united with humanity to make one beautiful creation oh hallelujah he was a new creation i think even brother branham used the language it's not adam just patched up right not adam just kind of with some new clothes on come here adam let's give you a makeover ah this wasn't some kind of remodeling job we're kind of all brought into the room all right open your eyes you're like oh it looks so different that's just something that's been patched up listen i don't want i just don't want this house to get a chip in joanne's makeover i want a new one no in this one covering up some old moldy studs i want a new body to match a new soul clean inside and out completely renovated completely changed in its atoms so he was of the new creation man and god met and joined together the first of a new race a new species using that word he's the head of this new race god then if he created again god had created something greater second adam's greater than the first although adam typed christ although adam foreshadowed christ he's not greater than christ first corinthians 15 45 to 47 i have i must go quickly here as so it is written the first man adam was made a living soul what does that connect him with it connects him with the earth he's made a living soul he has life just like the animals when adam has made a living soul he now is that spirit adam in a body and now adam in the completion of the man his soul spirit body the only difference from him and the rest of animal life is he has a soul and so but he's now has this affinity to the earth his body's come from the earth he has this uh affinity to animal life he's called a living soul this is remarkable god ordains him as a living soul to be the preeminent living soul over all creation that's the commandment in genesis 1 29-31 this is the commandment that he's to live under the first adam was made a living soul and you could just put a butt in here but but the scripture has just a semi-colon the way we haven't written out the last adam was made a quickening spirit that's different one thing to be a living soul being something totally different to be a quickening spirit it's one thing to be living another thing to be life-giving adam was made a living soul christ is made a life-giver adam was made alive christ makes you live what's greater it's greater to be one that can give life to be life-giving to just be merely living oh hallelujah christ was made a quickening spirit how be it that was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural and afterward that which is spiritual talk about first man adam second man christ the first man is of the earth earthly adam the second man is the lord from heaven now why would god do it that way god principles of redemption require it and then also for us to understand we all come by first birth natural but we need a second birth supernatural it's in there that we not get discouraged listen anything you could complain about any sin any temptation any weakness i i know this gets some people getting oh it's kind of maybe that pentecostal in them they don't believe in predestination they go oh don't go there you're going to make them so predestinated they're just going to sin every day of their life no no no no a revelation of predestination delivers you from sin amen you're like wait a minute i'm ordained from the beginning to be sinless then i want to start sinning i don't want to do it anymore i want to stop it it doesn't drive people into more on goddess and more filthiness no preach predestination preach it sure preach it plain listen so i can say this with absolute shirt to the elect all your ups and downs and in and outs and backslidings and doubts and weaknesses that's a product of the first birth it's there you're sticky you've got hooks in your elbows however you want to say it but listen to be born again from above put you in connection not with just a living soul but a quickened spirit and we feed this flesh with our doubt we feed our first birth by listening to false doctrine and the reasonings of man let this message raise you up out of first birth mentality and let the mind of christ have preeminence in you that's why even the perverting of the teachings of how a son of god comes into the image of christ it tries to bring you into bondage and legalism and keep you broken so you always need some man to fix you but listen meet christ get the inside teacher the first man is of the earth the second man is the lord of heaven it says earlier in that chapter first corinthians 15 22 for as in adam all die that's where that's where we get that's that's what adam does for us we all die in adam even so in christ shall all be made alive something about this life-giver something about this quickener romans 5 12 wherefore as by one man's sin entered in the world referring to adam and death by sin and so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned this is because of adam the first man the first human humanity so adam has allowed sin to enter humanity so now death by sin so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned that's man that's adam that's you and i by first birth we've been reading romans 3 23 for all have sinned adam sinned we've all sinned in adam by one man's sin entered and come short of the glory of god that includes adam adam fell short of the glory of god we all fall short of the glory of god because of sin but christ is the expressed image of his glory so it says in romans 8 3 for what the law could not do and that it was weak through the flesh just men keeping ordinances god sending his own son notice how beautiful this is i hope that you can fully grasp this and i i'll go ahead and just tell you what you're thinking i know i've preached over an hour at this point but i really hope this really strikes you god sent in his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh the likeness of simplifies it resembled sinful flesh but it wasn't sinful flesh it just looked like it because in the likeness of sinful flesh was the express image of the glory of god oh that gives me hope that gives me hope that this flesh though it looks like a man who's fallen the express image of christ can be seen in me god sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and foresin condemned sin in the flesh what a beautiful love story he was in the likeness of sinful flesh and then what did he do he didn't sin he took it on he didn't sin he became it by hanging on a cross in the likeness of sinful flesh but sinless why he was a different creation it was a different specie a new creation all man and all god the bible says in second corinthians 5 19 to wit that god was in christ reckless reconciling the world what world the world that god had created the world that god loved everything embodied in the perfect garden of eden that's the world that god loved why because the bible says if you love the world and the things the word the love of god is not in you so it's not all the cosmos not all the things that are worldly and in the world but the world that god loved the world he wanted to reconcile is in the beginning god created the world the heavens and the earth and all the things that were therein by the original spoken word the seeds that are laying there that's how what god wanted to reconcile how is he going to do it by this last step evolution where now man and god become one and when that happens when it seals what does it do it redeems the whole thing just something tran something connects and now a way is made the breach is gone man and god can be joined together in the to achieve what god had in his heart in the beginning was a new creation god in christ god and man perfectly joined the beginning of a new species he was the first man of a new brother man uses the term race but again new race to define something different than mankind or humanity let me just find orient myself here we had to uh pause a few services so i've got to somehow fit i got to find a way to capture back those three services we lost so i might just i'll grab a little bit from that sunday we didn't have if you don't mind doesn't mean i'm going to preach four hours i could no question that's definitely possible to be the group like you guys people someone said the other day man you preached more than an hour you know i think i said my dad would leave or something like that and i'm like uh is he wanting to visit anytime soon now an identified masterpiece of god i'll try to read through these quickly because i want you to catch this the image of christ he was so much in the image of god until him and god became one i and my father are one what a living that was for god to so live in him that his whole life was wrapped in god no wonder it was a masterpiece satan come to him every time god thought he had a masterpiece satan got in adam and the woman god's first masterpiece he god and moses he broke the commandments but when he come to this masterpiece that was god's own choosing why god had appointed this one to be the firstborn god appointed this one to be the first begotten god had appointed this one to be the heir of all things he had foreigned him it didn't do him satan no good he stayed true to god when god looked at him and seen he was tempted 40 days in the wilderness like moses of course all those men foreshadowed him the law was broken but when he satan the great tempter and tried to tempt him he found he didn't find moses there no sir he had a 5 000 watt volt that singed his wings when he jumped up against that one it is written he said adam took down but jesus ii out of the masterpiece that had been come for the redeemer he said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god there he had a masterpiece yes sir he said something else he said it's also written thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god get thee hint satan there was a masterpiece he said it is written that's what he put his first adam behind and he fell and satan marred it but he could not mar this one no matter what he done in so much so god said this is my beloved son hear ye him everything i give everything over to him you hear him they were one they were the same one god lived in him making him god emmanuel on earth he was a perfect lamb all the perfect masterpiece of redemption now he says adam satan came to adam and through the temptation when he put his first adam behind that he fell in satan martin why he put adam behind the word right and as long as they stayed behind the word they wouldn't fall but satan could tempt him and it was possible that they step outside of the word because they were behind the word the conditional covenant if you don't do this they were behind the word but now with abraham god makes an unconditional covenant and it's i will but who is the covenant with the seed after him and the seed was not too many as israel jacob and judah and all these different ones but to one christ so the unconditional covenants to christ i will so he doesn't just place christ behind the word the word becomes christ the word is in christ i can stand behind this pulpit use your imagination if you put this pulpit in me i can't get out from behind it why not become part of it that's why it says you cannot mar this one they were one in god's power to transform he says and satan tried and tried again do everything one night laying in the back of the ship he seen him asleep he said i'll destroy him right now but he couldn't he tried to tempt him into doing the wrong thing but he couldn't do it why christ now he'd been sprayed with the repellent of predestination now what have you been sprayed with that's what did it are you predestined are you predestinated are you ordained are you elect you've been sprayed with the same thing hallelujah listen we've got the oil there's only one essential oil i don't mean to offend anybody i'm not talking doterra young living or anything else somebody wants to create the only essential oil is the baptism of the holy ghost wherein you become baptized in the body of christ and only those who've been sprayed with the repellent of predestination i put lavender well elizabeth sister listen puts lavender on my big toe if i'm not feeling well so i i'm i'm not preaching against essential oils one of the funniest things i've ever seen was a medic a cartoon of a medic on a battlefield treating a wounded soldier all shot shot up he goes he touched me says don't worry i've got some lavender oil on you and he goes i feel it working already i'm calm sprayed with the repellent of predestination it can't be deceived go back to that statement he's been sprayed with repellent of predestination it can't be deceived no no the word said he'd be here but not only he but she not only him but you the word said she would be here sprayed with the repellent of predestination the bible says in romans 8 29 to 31 for whom he did for no he also did predestinate he foreknew you therefore he predestinated you to be conformed to the image of his son his son is the expressed image of the glory of god now you likewise become a bear of the image of god why by predestination thanks be to god he's also predestinated you to be changed quick and translated transformed into the image of his son who is the expressed image of his person why so that christ would be the firstborn among many brethren same parent same thing so if you have a recipe and you make pancakes on sunday and then you make they use the same recipe and you make pancakes the next morning it's the same thing why same same material same process so then christ is a new creation deity in flesh and then if he's going to have a brother right you can't make pancake water or you know you can't make pumpkin waffles and say it's the same thing as the buckwheat pancakes you made the day before different recipe different thing but now this is a new creation and then we likewise predestined to become in the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren and then he says this moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified the image of being justified but not sanctified and sanctified and not sealed with the holy ghost and there be any chance to fall short only applies to the make-believer who confesses justification and confesses sanctification but to the elect you can not miss it if you are justified you by scripture are already glorified by scripture if you are sanctified you are already perfect you have perfected forever them that are sanctified him that have been justified they're already glorified why you've been sprayed with the repellent of predestination you can not miss it if i'm justified i'm already glorified i might as well walk into my sanctification i might are you might as well walk into the baptism of the holy ghost why i'm ordained to it he's already glorified you if you're justified what shall we say then to these things what things anything anything if god before us who can be against us he's for you if god before you who can be against you let them withstand you let them lie about you whether it be health whether it be a lie whether it be rumor whether it be found let it stand it will fall why if god before us and so much is meant in that not that he's just on your side but he's in you he is you improving his word he was the beginner of the creation of god god and creation god with a little part of the creation here that god was living in himself he was the beginning of that creation of god from him begets many sons so this new creation is going to be surrounded by others who have the same material so the bible says in second corinthians 5 17 therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature a new creation old things are passed away behold all things are become new all things are become new this is a promise saints any man be in christ how do you get in christ by one spirit you're baptized in the body of christ and when that happens all things become new it speaks that you have now left pure humanity and you're coming into fellowship with deity and now when you speak deity speaking now it's christ being formed in you now there's something that's connected you you've bridged the gap you've come to the missing link it's been your your person is being perfected oh it's so wonderful to be born again brother branham in the church age book says he was of the new creation man and god met and joined together he was the first of this new race he is the head of this new race then he quotes second corinthians 5 17 if any man be in christ so now you are connected to this he's a new creature all things are passed away behold all things have become new it says there you can see that though man was of the old order or creation now in union with christ he has become the new creation of god he quotes ephesians 2 10 for we are his workmanship created in union with christ jesus unto good works ephesians 4 24 and that ye put on the new man which is after god is created in righteousness and true holiness as this is the new man you're created anew by the new birth you are a new man after god created in god's image not just in his likeness but now you're an image of god so he says the new creation is not the old creation made over it or it could not be called a new creation if it was adam patched up and renovated if it was adam just with a little something a little bit of flavor and added in this is not the new creation then but the new creation is not the old creation made over it could not be called a new creation this is exactly what it says it is new creation it is a another creation distinct from the old one now let's pause take a deep breath i'm not doing this for myself now but who's he talking about you he's quoted second corinthians 5 in a man being christ he's a new creature ephesians 2 10 we are his workmanship created in christ jesus ephesians 4 24 that ye put on the new man so he's not talking about jesus anymore he's talking about you the brethren that were to come he says this is another creation distinct from the old one no longer is he dealing by ways of the flesh that's how he dealt with israel he chose abraham and of abraham's issue through the godly isaac line but now out of every kindred tribe and nation he's purposed a new creation he is the first of that creation he was created in the form of man now by his spirit he's creating many sons unto himself god the creator created himself a part of his creation now this is my words now in who in creating sons and daughters of god by a new birth god the creator created himself in a part of his new creation this is the true revelation of god this was his purpose colossians 3 10 and have put on this is us now by virtue of the new birth and have put on the new man which is created in the image of god which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him wow you put on a new man renewed in knowledge what's this knowledge after what's this mind after it's after the image of him that created you the image it's derived from it's the likeness just like a child bears the image of a parent in that in that image it's not divisible from him you can't take it out the child bears the image he just doesn't resemble somebody he's in the image of somebody god having children does not have men he has god daughters god sons and the revelation of jesus christ personally to you quickens you to what a higher life a new life a new man this new man is christ formed in the believer it's the image of god being formed in flesh think of all the scriptures you could start using to support them and i want to close with this uh this is my closing thought i'm not closing it's my closing thought i'll try to make this very quick it's just a lengthy statement i want to read here in a moment so in god so that we see them that we are new creations created new in christ this is god now creating again as it were but in this new creation you know what's foreshadowed in the beginning the new creation is portrayed in the first creation of man because god makes man in his image and after his likeness but now there's a knowledge that we're the new man is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him second corinthians 4 6 for god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness so now he's going back to in the beginning when god spoke and commanded light to shine out of darkness he now says hath shined in our hearts by what spoken word creation again just as god created in the beginning what did we see it was foreshadowing the creation that god would do in you light driving away darkness to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ your new creations foreshadowed in the beginning when god created brother braham says in god's provided place of worship you are then not yourself you are a new creature for the greek there means a new creation you've been recreated again the power of god comes upon you and you become created a new creature which brings the whole physical being spiritual being in everything in subject to the word of god no other way that's the promise you are created new a new creature as so then as the second adam which the bible says is the lord of heaven is more glorious than the first man of earth right so is god's image created in us by the new birth greater than the image that adam held if the second adam was more glorious than the first man of earth then we by a new birth created in the image of god by the new birth it's a more glorious image than the image that adam held it's just afternoon let me read this statement from the church age book brother braham says in revelations 2 8 these things saith the first and the last which was dead and is alive and the brother man says now these are not the words of a man a mere man could he speak from the grave could he speak from the grave would say i am the first and the last which was alive and is dead right he has an end the first thing that happens to a man is that he is born is alive and the last thing that happens to him is that he dies but this is one where he says was dead and is alive so he says so this is not a man speaking this is deity now as brother brahman starts doing the contrast remember how brother brahman says on one hand the woman is this on the other hand the woman is that right one hand she's foul on the other hand she's glorious and virtuous now brother man's going to do the same thing and he says man adam took life and turned it into death but this man jesus took death and turned it into life adam took innocence and turned it into guilt this one took guilt and turned it into righteousness adam took a paradise and turned it into a waste howling wilderness but this one is coming back to turn an earth rocking and reeling with destruction into another eden adam took a life of fellowship and joy with god and turned it into a desert a spiritual darkness that brought forth all sin moral decay pain suffering delusion and corruption that wars within the souls of men but this one from all the tragic death and degradation that filled mankind brought forth a life of righteousness and beauty so that as sin once reigned unto death even so might men now reign in righteousness by one christ jesus oh hallelujah thank god for the gift of his son thank god that he's not just another adam not just another prophet not just another man that was redeemed by the blood of god listen don't make the mistake of preaching some third adam doctrine jesus christ is the last adam brother branham is not the third adam some prophet from africa is not the third adam there's not a third or a fourth or fifth or sixth adam there's the last adam jesus christ listen when you recognize him you don't need an eighth messenger when the seventh introduces you to christ you don't get an eight you don't come to an eighth messenger amen you're not looking around for something to come back and be used again you've been married to christ so let's just look at it here i'm not going to read it you just look at it here genesis chapter 1 verses 26 to 28 god said let us make man in our image and after our likeness you realize that's prophecy again partly expressed in adam so god when he speaks he's not only prophesying the creation of man the first creation of humanity but he's also prophesying the new creation of himself because adam came in the likeness god with the resemblance of god but there was going to come one who was god was the god man so in the beginning god created man in genesis 1 which typed the beginning of the creation of god brother graham says adam was a type of christ in every figure he says the first adam and eve typed the second adam and eve what was it a type it was always a type and brother branham said this i thought i had this earlier in my notes i might have skipped right over it but i wanted to read it again at the close but listen what brother braham says then about adam and christ he says satan couldn't cross him up talking about adam satan crossed adam or talking about christ satan crossed adam up right but now he says satan couldn't cross him up no no he was a different type of adam wouldn't it it wasn't adam again he's different than adam christ the original seat of genesis 1 is what a new man adam typed him adam may have looked like him he may have looked like adam adam may have foreshadowed him adam may have portrayed him might adam might have acted out things that christ would ultimately do but christ is the full supreme perfect reflection of god as a god man he's the express image of his person the perfect image of the invisible god but adam only came so far and foreshadowed him so satan could cross him up adam then not being deceived though could walk out portraying foreshadowing christ but christ being the original seed he could not fall but the baby says and knoweth it not in the beginning of the creation of god when god to begin to create bring you into existence now we can look at this differently in the beginning of creation of god when did he begin to bring you into existence naturally you begin to come into existence when eve became the mother of all living but supernaturally you come into existence when genesis 1 27 begins to form in the womb of a virgin he says in the beginning of the creation of god now god begins to create and now your your genesis is in christ bring you into existence see you started back there as a seed and work down to where you are now and then you were all in christ who was the beginning of the creation god you're all in christ then when christ died he died to redeem all of you and you are a part of this word so now you you have connection you're connected to christ don't disassociate yourself from christ don't think of yourself as a step-brother god's adoption is not taking an orphan in making them a son you become you express sonship by a new birth and god's adoption is the placing and the maturing and the full revelation of who you are in christ coming into your heart word after word line after line precept after precept and a son of god coming to the full knowledge and revelation of who i am as a son and as a daughter we're not orphans we're not beggars were part of the word so he says christ was a different type of adam and then what does he say in god of this evil age about the bride she's not like eve she's not that type of a woman why you came not born between satan and the serpent you've come from christ by a new birth and he wasn't that type of atom nor you typed that that type of woman bible says in first peter 1 23 being born again born born born again thank god i'm born again don't ever let it become a little bee in a little a it's capital b capital a born again from above it puts eternal life into you being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the word of god this word birth which liveth and abideth forever that brings you right back to the very thing that adam couldn't partake in adam was never born he says lest he reach forth and partake of the tree of life and what live forever something sealed off mankind goes into chaos humanity creation goes into chaos but one day this seed is going to come christ is going to come and then you being born from above by incorruptible seed live and abide forever i believe brother paul lovell sends out quotes on a daily basis sometimes at like three o'clock in the morning and he must be studying on the the new birth how it's see when you're born again you have eternal life you can't be separated from god because every quote's just been about the new birth and how lifting up that new birth and how important it is how preeminent is he sent this morning the statement brother man says your new life is the lamb's book of life your marriage certificate where your true eternal germ from the beginning takes hold that's what the new birth is your new life which was in the lamb's book of life where your true eternal germ from the beginning takes hold why it was always there so sister elizabeth if you could come i want to read this last statement my last my last quote in the church age book chapter 7. maybe we could sing that song in moments like these the key of c church age book chapter seven but the man says that great royal seed jesus christ was planted he died and that life that was in him came up through the wheat plant and is reproducing itself in multitudes of wheat seeds having the same life in them and being like the original because by spirit they are original now we can see why the redeemed bought back by the original owner bride the redeemed bride she was in him as eve was in adam notice those principles those are very thick heavy principles he just kind of puts in there bought back by the original owner there's redemption the bride was in him as eve was in adam so it's got to be the same material same life same bone same creation now we can see why the redeemed bride cannot ever have her member names taken off the record she is part of him she is in the throne she can never be judged everyone in the bride is a member of him and he loses none eliot has a shirt that says when some lose none christ got the same thing he loses none all that the father hath given me will come he will lose he will not lose one why they've been spread with the repellent of predestination that's why satan has not taken there's no depth of sin there's no depth of corruption there's nothing too great that this love of god can't reach down path and redeem an elect seed of god i say stand upon the promise use your own life as an example if he could redeem me he could redeem the worst the lost whoever it is while god will lose not one every one in the bride is a member of him and he loses none i'm resting in that i rest that i will not let the devil bring fear condemnation doubt i won't let it work he's got no room to work in that way the only thing the devil can do is just remind you that there's more work to be done thanks for reminding me devil there's more work to be done thanks for reminding me that means there's more coming there's a greater glory coming greater deliverance coming greater peace coming thanks for reminding me there's more patience coming thanks for reminding me there's more sensitivity coming thanks for reminding me this tongue is going to be bound thanks for reminding me i'm going to have greater discernment thanks for reminding me devil whatever you want to place on me only i can flip it around and say that means this is what god's bringing for me you bring doubt god's got more faith for me you bring sickness god's got more healing for me whatever you bring satan i'm just gonna flip it around and say god's got more wow greater glory greater glory greater glory until it comes into the perfect image that's what god has for you don't doubt it for a second believe it walk in it let's stand on our feet thank you for your patience today thank you for being just such wonderful pullers and listeners to let me deliver this burden with this link just thank you i appreciate it let's bow our heads we're going to bow our heads and speak to the almighty god not as a beggar not as an orphan but as his image the bible talks about us if we look into the bible he says brother branham said you're looking at god christ face to face and then what did paul say we were looking into a mirror so if we're looking into a mirror and we see ourselves what does god see when he sees you [Music] he sees himself so you're not coming to him as an orphan you're not coming to him as a beggar when we pray this morning don't beg ask we kind of say it just to be a little bit pen with our grammar but when our kids say can i have a drink he said i don't know can you because we're wanting him just to ask don't worry about ability he can just ask just ask whatever you have need of today just ask not as orphans not as beggars not as children who've been merely adopted into a family and taken on a name know you've been ordained to obtain an inheritance by election by origination by image not resemblance you are bone of his bone flesh of his flesh life of his life you are a part of the word you are in the image of him that created all things you are as his daughter as his son in his image when he sees you he sees himself and he cannot deny himself so you can ask today there's so many needs that i desire to ask for that would it be for the correa family and sister ruth's father and her brother the pastor of jericho tabernacle i think of brother homer longoria sister erica uh parker's going in for treatment for her sickness and i think of all these different ones that are sick and needy and body's sister sandy contradicts i believe god's gonna bring her to this church he's gonna bring her forward and she's gonna believe she's gonna walk in her healing there's so many different needs i believe that we should just ask believing he's the same yesterday today and forever if you want deliverance this morning lift up hands that are free let those broken chains hold you back no longer there's something you desire come before god say god i believe [Music] sister gina pinkston's sister sister desiree went in for a surgery and with the complications of the surgery came within breaths of dying just a surgery that should have been perhaps routine within a few days the doctors say there's nothing we can do for she's dying how god could come and mend and heal and raise up and make well not because god's a healer because we're asking not as beggars but his bride why do we ask for these things that god would be glorified god encourage us today let's pray heavenly father we appreciate you it means more to us today to say father it means more to us to be called a son or a daughter of god lord may it be so as i expressed in the beginning my burden is that christ would come into plainer view may they fall in love may we all fall in love with christ all over again may the image become more perfect and likewise lord as you become more understood may we personally become more connected with it but i i i can believe it about the bride it's so plain it's so clear brother i'm so particular the bride the bride he names her the scriptures named this body we can say it about the body which is the fullness of christ that filleth all in all we can say it about the bride which is the lamb's wife but lord i i am in that bride may i claim it for myself for the deliverance that i desire for the health that i desire for the peace that i desire for the liberty that i desire lord may i believe in that if it applies to christ it's my inheritance because i am a joint heir with them if it applies to the bride it applies to me because i am a member of it am i standing steadfast in my justification that i never did it in the first place that my member name can never be removed from that book that you will not lose one lord i rejoice in the testimony well i'll just speaking lord of brother aaron jones who has so been so desirous to express his testimony how he says this can be nothing other than god who's doing what he's doing there's no other way to explain it a young man who's been out of church for 10 years would call on a saturday night and i just want you to know i'm going out of town with my family so don't be alarmed if i'm not there in the morning oh god may you raise this young man up to be a fire brand for you may it be a revival sweep through his family lord may it inspire us to believe may we make a commitment to this one that we'll pray will minister to lord will believe all things are possible and i thank you lord jesus for giving us yet another example of the supernatural that's moving within our midst so that we can believe for ourselves that you will do what you have promised i commit the people to you today as we commit ourselves to your word in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen it can be wonderful and this all climaxes with the meat and in the air and then we shall see him as he is and we'll be like him even in our bodies but until then i want to see him as he is in his word and seeing him in his word i'm changed from glory unto glory greater greater higher higher until this man becomes a god man that's the process where he now sings yield to it rest in it amen if you need anything from god we can pray for you petition the lord for you let's just worship for a few moments tell him that we love him
