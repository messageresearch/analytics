[0:00] we're just going to jump right into this
[0:02] this evening and just touch on a few
[0:04] points that will pick up on what we were
[0:05] talking about last Wednesday as we took
[0:08] a service on Love's evidence and will
[0:10] continue on part two of that and I think
[0:14] we kind of we're definitely towards the
[0:16] end focusing on some of the attributes
[0:18] of human love that are associated with
[0:21] perfect love and how that you just can't
[0:23] take certain attributes of what we call
[0:25] love or kindness or being sweet and
[0:27] gentle and Associate that with Divine
[0:29] love because there are attributes that
[0:31] we would think are related to love that
[0:33] are not perfect love and as we read here
[0:35] about what the fruit of the spirit is we
[0:38] know that the fruit of the spirit is the
[0:40] manifestation of the promised word the
[0:42] fruit of the spirit is the manifestation
[0:44] of the word and it's when it's not the
[0:47] word that's manifesting itself then it
[0:49] becomes fruits and not fruit because it
[0:51] is the fruit of the spirit but then once
[0:53] it just becomes humanistic and you're
[0:55] kind of grabbing hold of certain things
[0:56] then there's no harmony with the nature
[0:59] of God there's no cohesiveness among
[1:01] among those other attributes so it just
[1:03] becomes fruits of the spirit and but we
[1:06] know that the fruit of the spirit is an
[1:08] inward work of Grace by the word and
[1:10] when that begins to manifest it's
[1:12] singular the fruit of the spirit and has
[1:14] different ways that that fruit we enjoy
[1:16] that fruit and it is through that joy
[1:18] and that meekness and that Temperance
[1:20] and the peace and the long-suffering but
[1:21] when it's the inward work of Grace the
[1:23] fruit of the spirit manifests in those
[1:25] different ways
[1:26] but if we took those different things of
[1:28] joy and peace and long-suffering and
[1:30] gentleness and goodness and faith and
[1:32] meekness and Temperance those can all be
[1:34] just mere human emotional states and if
[1:37] they're just an emotional state that can
[1:40] be duplicated in other words it's not
[1:42] actually the fruit of the spirit but
[1:43] it's it's impersonated through human
[1:45] behavior
[1:46] and when we say impersonated when we say
[1:48] any one of these things can be
[1:49] impersonated what we're saying is it can
[1:51] look like the fruit it can sound like
[1:53] the fruit it can feel like the fruit or
[1:55] that which the spirit produces but it's
[1:57] just a carnal uh human emotion or it's
[2:00] just carnally inspired it's not the word
[2:01] that's doing it but we know that one
[2:04] thing that cannot be impersonated one
[2:06] thing that cannot be duplicated that is
[2:07] the word of God
[2:09] and in the word even in saying that I
[2:11] know when we think about the word cannot
[2:13] be impersonated there's a mysterious
[2:14] element to that saying well then what is
[2:16] the word if the word is kindness and I'm
[2:18] impersonating kindness am I not
[2:19] impersonating the word but when it's the
[2:21] word in you acting that cannot be
[2:24] impersonated it can only be duplicated
[2:27] in a carnal way but you can't replicate
[2:29] the word itself
[2:31] and so I think some of the things we
[2:34] were Minister on last time to kind of
[2:35] help catch us up to this evening is the
[2:38] holy spirit is the life of God living in
[2:40] you to perform his word to perform the
[2:42] word of God and that's the best way for
[2:45] me to describe perfect love perfect love
[2:46] is the holy spirit in you performing
[2:49] God's word and some of the things we've
[2:51] kind of touched on through these last
[2:53] few weeks is that perfect love it
[2:55] protects always protects God's purpose
[2:57] perfect love is not always be kind but
[3:01] it's always be kind to preserve God's
[3:03] purpose oh it's not just love your
[3:05] neighbor and as long as you quote
[3:07] unquote make your neighbor feel loved
[3:09] that's doing it but no it must preserve
[3:11] and protect God's purpose because the
[3:13] holy spirit is desirous of God's perfect
[3:17] will being performed not just trying to
[3:19] make the other person feel good
[3:20] and so even in manifesting perfect love
[3:23] to somebody else it may hurt or offend
[3:24] it might even hurt or offend us but it
[3:27] never hurts or fends God's will
[3:29] and so we could say the word expressed
[3:31] is perfect love expressed and I'm going
[3:33] to touch on some points in the scripture
[3:35] to kind of help reinforce that it's a
[3:37] Divine manifestation of the word is love
[3:41] now tonight and I've kind of been
[3:43] holding off on these things they fit
[3:45] kind of just as support for all the
[3:47] things that we've been ministering on
[3:48] perfect love but I want to look at the
[3:50] connection between the word and perfect
[3:52] love or charity so the connection
[3:54] between the word which is God which God
[3:56] is the lover and and perfect love which
[3:59] is charity and that's why we're calling
[4:01] the manifestation of love as Love's
[4:03] evidence
[4:04] and if you could
[4:06] I know tonight I know it's kind of a
[4:08] Wednesday night but I will ask you just
[4:10] to please Focus you might have already
[4:12] had a really really rough week and an
[4:13] even worse day today than Monday which
[4:16] may be not easy not that hard because
[4:17] Monday was a holiday hopefully for most
[4:19] people
[4:20] but I feel that when it comes to
[4:22] preaching the word of God you can't you
[4:24] can't take a night off
[4:25] and so if you could this is going to
[4:27] build tonight and
[4:30] um I like to do that on Wednesday nights
[4:31] because I think that if if anyone who
[4:34] missed service just happens to hear
[4:36] about how it went or catch it I would
[4:38] want them to be able to say I wish I was
[4:40] there and so if that's my sole
[4:42] motivation tonight and it does you good
[4:43] then that I think that'll suffice
[4:45] but in looking at this if you could just
[4:47] focus because the first I'm going to go
[4:49] through three connections there's more
[4:50] there's different ways you could say
[4:51] this but I think this will help us to
[4:53] understand that perfect love is the
[4:55] manifestation of the word
[4:57] the first connection I want you to see
[4:59] between God and perfect love is God is
[5:01] the word
[5:03] and God is love John 1 1 it says in the
[5:05] beginning was the word and the Word was
[5:07] with God and the Word was God so many
[5:09] different places we could go to to see
[5:11] how that God being the Eternal one the
[5:15] invisible one who then formed himself
[5:17] into the logos which would be an
[5:19] expression of God and we could say in
[5:20] the beginning was the word and then
[5:22] these words are this word is the the
[5:25] heart of God the thoughts of God his
[5:26] thoughtfulness expressed so we
[5:28] recognized just in terms of formula God
[5:31] is the word in the beginning was the
[5:32] word and the word is God and then as
[5:35] we've read in first John chapter 4 verse
[5:37] 7 for Love For Love is of God and then
[5:41] it says God is love
[5:43] and so we know that God is love and God
[5:45] is love that means it's not just God is
[5:47] loving or God is kind but it makes love
[5:49] or charity this essential attribute of
[5:52] God that can be descriptive of God it's
[5:55] like God is love
[5:57] and so when we see that God is the word
[5:59] the Bible says that God is love so
[6:00] that's a connection between the word and
[6:03] perfect love
[6:05] now the second connection just do you
[6:06] see how how much kinship there is
[6:08] between God and this perfect love the
[6:11] Bible says that God's word will never
[6:12] fail
[6:13] it'll never pass away and God's love
[6:15] will never fail
[6:17] in Matthew chapter 24 verse 35 it says
[6:19] Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my
[6:21] words shall not pass away now what Jesus
[6:25] says my words we have to realize it's
[6:27] not just the the the grammar he's using
[6:30] or the physical words that he's saying
[6:31] that this is just a man when he says my
[6:33] words but when he says my words he's
[6:35] speaking about the word of God as John
[6:38] said in John 3 34 for he whom God hath
[6:40] sent speaketh the words of God for God
[6:43] giveth not the Spirit by measure unto
[6:45] him so when Jesus says my word shall not
[6:47] pass away it's God that gave him the
[6:50] words to speak he said the words that I
[6:52] speak unto you they are spirit and they
[6:54] are life he said I am the way the truth
[6:56] of life he he the words that he speaks
[6:58] are they are spirit and they are life
[7:00] they're not just merely the words that I
[7:02] speak to you but he's saying the words
[7:04] that I'm speaking these are the words of
[7:05] God he said I do nothing of myself but
[7:08] as my father taught me I speak these
[7:10] things so when he says the words that I
[7:12] speak shall never pass away Heaven and
[7:15] Earth shall pass away but my word shall
[7:17] ever pass away he's saying the word of
[7:19] God will never fail
[7:21] it'll never pass away and then the Bible
[7:24] says in First Corinthians 13 8 charity
[7:26] never faileth
[7:28] says but whether there be prophecies
[7:30] they shall fail whether there be tongues
[7:31] they shall cease whether there be
[7:33] knowledge it shall vanish away but
[7:35] charity never faileth now I'm just using
[7:38] quick scriptures that we can grab them
[7:40] hold of to recognize these connections
[7:41] between the word and perfect love
[7:44] because I believe it's very important
[7:45] for us to understand how love manifests
[7:47] itself we looked at how love looks we're
[7:49] looking at Love's evidence it says
[7:51] charity never faileth and there's
[7:52] another thing that never fails and
[7:54] that's God's word
[7:55] so you have the connection God is love
[7:57] and God is his word the word will never
[7:59] fail charity will never fail
[8:02] and then this verse first John 2 17 it
[8:05] ties us into the next connection but it
[8:06] says in the world passeth away and the
[8:09] lust thereof but he that doeth the will
[8:11] of God abideth forever
[8:14] so it reminds us that the world the
[8:16] things of the world will pass away the
[8:17] lust of the world will pass away hatred
[8:18] has an end because the object of hate
[8:20] will cease to exist but this love he
[8:23] that doeth the will of God abideth
[8:25] forever and that leads us to the third
[8:27] connection that the scriptural trait of
[8:29] perfect love or the love for God is
[8:32] keeping God's word
[8:34] now this it's in this area I think I'll
[8:36] probably be staying for the rest of the
[8:37] evening even though we're going to move
[8:39] Beyond these connections
[8:41] but I want I'm using that phrase keep
[8:43] the word of God because I think
[8:45] sometimes and I believe it's an
[8:46] appropriate word and it's true to obey
[8:48] the word of God is a scriptural trait of
[8:50] perfect love but it's not just obedience
[8:53] and the reason why I say that is because
[8:55] it's not just some people it's not just
[8:59] obedience and I'd say because some
[9:00] people obey out of fear
[9:03] the wrong kind of fear they'll they'll
[9:05] obey they'll do what someone says solely
[9:07] out of fear they say fear is a great
[9:08] motivator and some leadership styles are
[9:10] to Simply motivate the People by fear
[9:12] into subjection and so some obey and
[9:15] even obey the Bible out of the wrong
[9:17] kind of fear it's not the fear that one
[9:20] who loves someone has that reverential
[9:22] respect and desires to please them and
[9:24] never would want to offend them it's
[9:26] more of a fear of punishment the wrong
[9:28] kind of fear so love is not just
[9:31] obedience but love and this is hopefully
[9:33] becomes very very clear to you love is
[9:35] keeping the word of God and that's a
[9:37] special phrase
[9:38] in John chapter 14 verses 23 and 24
[9:42] Jesus answered and said unto him if a
[9:44] man loved me he will keep my words my
[9:47] father will love him and we will come
[9:49] unto him and make our Abode with him he
[9:52] that loveth me not keepeth not my
[9:54] sayings and remember His words are not
[9:56] just his words they are the word of God
[9:58] the words that I speak unto you their
[10:00] spirit and life the words that I speak I
[10:02] have been taught by the father my my
[10:04] word is the word of God the words that I
[10:06] speak are the words of God he says he
[10:08] that loveth me not keepeth not my
[10:10] sayings in the word which you hear is
[10:11] not mine but the fathers which sent me
[10:15] so he's saying if you love me you'll
[10:17] keep God's word it's not just his words
[10:19] but it's God's word I remember that love
[10:22] is not just sacrificial but love is
[10:25] submissive to the word of God that when
[10:28] Jesus gave down laid down his life as
[10:31] his greater love than this hath no man
[10:33] then he laid down his life for his
[10:35] friends and lays down his life for laid
[10:37] down his life for us it wasn't that
[10:39] laying down his life was the ultimate
[10:41] expression of love because that's the
[10:43] most you could give but this Greater
[10:45] Love was not just sacrifice but he laid
[10:48] down his life in obedience to the word
[10:50] as we read in first Samuel 15 how that
[10:53] Saul thought through worship and through
[10:55] sacrifice and and offerings to God that
[10:57] it was somehow cover the fact that he
[11:00] had not obeyed God's word and the
[11:01] prophet says hath the Lord is greater
[11:03] delight and birth burn offerings and
[11:05] sacrifices as in obeying the voice of
[11:07] the Lord is does he does he tell you to
[11:10] do something and then if you offer
[11:11] sacrifice he's like oh you know what
[11:13] never mind since you got me a gift and
[11:15] you did something nice for me and you
[11:16] worship me it doesn't matter that you
[11:17] disregarded what I taught he says no it
[11:20] says to obey is better than sacrifice
[11:23] and to hearken than the fat of rams
[11:26] and I think this a lot of times it kind
[11:29] of calls out where a lot of nominal
[11:32] Christianity is today as they think
[11:33] through extravagant worship and through
[11:36] pyrotechnics and everything else if they
[11:38] could just Heap praise upon Gods with
[11:40] their lips and they could just show a
[11:41] lot of Honor with their lips and say
[11:43] well through this worship and this
[11:44] extravagance and all that we're giving
[11:45] and all that we're trying to do to serve
[11:47] this is a sacrifice of praise this is a
[11:50] sacrifice of service we're trying to do
[11:52] God a service but yet he says how can I
[11:54] receive that when you won't do what I
[11:56] ask you to do
[11:57] so I'd much rather you just obey the
[11:59] word that would mean more to me as the
[12:01] one that you profess the love then all
[12:03] these other extravagant things that
[12:05] you're trying to do absent doing what I
[12:07] would ask you to do
[12:09] and so Jesus is saying he that keeps my
[12:11] word this is a it's kind of love this
[12:14] kind of obedience is submissive to the
[12:16] word of God not just sacrificial but
[12:18] it's submissive to the word of God in
[12:20] first John 2 5 but whoso keepeth his
[12:22] word in him verily is the love of God
[12:25] perfected hereby no we that we are in
[12:27] him I know we've covered a lot in first
[12:30] John already through these several parts
[12:31] in this series but notice again how this
[12:34] is that scriptural trait of perfect love
[12:36] is to keep the word of God he will keep
[12:39] my words he that keeps my words if a man
[12:41] loves me he keeps my words who so
[12:43] keepeth his word when God's word is kept
[12:46] it says verily in him is the love of God
[12:49] perfected in other words God's love is
[12:51] satisfied
[12:52] the objective of love the the very
[12:55] objective of him loving us and US loving
[12:57] him is accomplished when we keep his
[12:59] will
[12:59] so when God's word is kept God's love is
[13:02] satisfied he's satisfied his love that
[13:04] he projected to us his accomplish his
[13:06] objective and then our love for him
[13:09] receives it satisfaction when we keep
[13:11] his word
[13:13] going back to Saul's offerings uh at
[13:16] that time of war and he's offering up
[13:18] these sacrifices and God says you know
[13:20] what or when he did not obey uh to to
[13:23] slaughter everything so I kept these
[13:25] things for sacrifice in both instances
[13:27] God wanted him to obey and that would
[13:30] satisfy desire that's what God wanted it
[13:33] would have satisfied Saul to obey the
[13:35] word of God but instead he tormented
[13:37] himself through Disobedience so
[13:39] whosoever keeps the word of God it's in
[13:42] that that love is satisfied
[13:44] in first John chapter 5 verses 2 and 3
[13:47] it says by this we know that we love the
[13:49] children of God and there's a key phrase
[13:51] because you cannot love the children of
[13:53] God unless you love God and keep his
[13:55] Commandments
[13:57] so if you say you love the people of God
[13:59] and you say that you love the children
[14:00] of God but you do not love God and keep
[14:02] his Commandments then you don't know
[14:04] that you love the children of God
[14:06] oh I know that I love you and say well
[14:07] that's the greatest thing I could do is
[14:08] to love one another how do I know that I
[14:10] love you if I don't love God and keep
[14:12] his Commandments if those two are
[14:14] sacrificed for the sake of loving you I
[14:17] can't actually love you
[14:18] so for by this we know that we love the
[14:20] children of God when we love God and
[14:23] keep his Commandments for this is the
[14:25] love of God that we keep his
[14:27] Commandments and his Commandments are
[14:30] not Grievous
[14:32] I hope to spend a little bit of time on
[14:34] this enough for us to catch a deeper or
[14:36] maybe not catch just to remind you of
[14:38] the depth of this verse
[14:40] to when it says that we keep his
[14:42] Commandments and I would join this when
[14:44] he says he that will keep my word and he
[14:46] that keepeth his word when it says that
[14:48] we this is the love of God that we keep
[14:50] his Commandments I believe it's a
[14:51] principle that's easily misunderstood
[14:53] maybe even more easily misapplied and
[14:55] probably it's easier for us to misapply
[14:57] it to other people than it is ourselves
[14:58] but we can live under a wrong conception
[15:01] of this and Miss what God means when he
[15:03] says keep my Commandments because again
[15:06] we could say if you love me you'll obey
[15:08] me and and I think that's maybe a fair
[15:10] way to summarize what the Bible's saying
[15:12] if you love me you'll obey me but again
[15:15] it's not just obedience in other words
[15:16] we're not just checking a box we say the
[15:18] Bible says to do this and I just need to
[15:20] do it and that somehow absent some
[15:22] whatever's in your heart your motive and
[15:23] objective and how you feel when you're
[15:25] doing it and this is exactly what John
[15:27] is touching on he says this is the love
[15:28] of the love of God that we keep his
[15:30] Commandments and in the keeping of it it
[15:32] can't be Grievous
[15:34] because it's not it's not just that you
[15:36] do it but there's something to it
[15:37] there's some benefit in it there's some
[15:39] desire attached to it and so when it
[15:42] says keep his Commandments it does not
[15:44] mean that obedience becomes our task or
[15:46] obligation
[15:48] this is the love of God that we keep his
[15:49] Commandments it's not like okay so
[15:52] you're telling me that unless I love God
[15:53] I'm going to go to hell forever and the
[15:55] only way I can love God is if I do what
[15:57] he says and so all right well then I'll
[15:59] just do what he says and we look at his
[16:00] well this is some sort of task
[16:03] um I hope this is so maybe okay to say
[16:05] this but I've been studying on a thought
[16:07] and I think right now my working title
[16:09] is the the shadows of Catholicism
[16:11] and just how much the how the Shadows
[16:15] there's still Catholicism in a lot of us
[16:17] and the way that we worship God it's
[16:19] under that strict dogma of penance and
[16:22] Punishment and tribulation
[16:25] and purgatory and that's the motivation
[16:28] like everything we do is a motivation to
[16:30] somehow avoid God's judgment it's the
[16:32] wrong way to love God
[16:34] because love is not a task or an
[16:36] obligation because it says here to keep
[16:39] he that keepeth his Commandments
[16:41] the word is translated to reserve to
[16:43] observe to watch or Preserve
[16:46] and so the word to keep he that keeps
[16:48] his Commandments it means to take care
[16:50] of
[16:51] to guard to keep hold to keep pure to
[16:55] reserve or observe
[16:58] so when the Bible says when we love God
[17:00] we keep his Commandments it's not just
[17:02] in the strict obedience to it but we're
[17:05] regarding it
[17:06] we're keeping his Commandments pure
[17:08] we're keeping them whole the Commandment
[17:09] there is a charge or injunction that
[17:11] which an office requires or prescribed
[17:14] so there's some prescribed rule
[17:16] according to uh how things are done
[17:18] properly
[17:20] so when he says that this is my this is
[17:22] God's love this is how we know that we
[17:24] love God we're going to guard
[17:26] that what is required of us we're going
[17:29] to keep pure what he expects from us
[17:31] we're going to preserve this virtue by
[17:33] by the result of this Union that we have
[17:36] of them with him this obligation that we
[17:38] have is not by by law but it arises from
[17:42] relationship
[17:43] to take care of to keep pure to to
[17:46] preserve uh this this charge or this is
[17:50] injunction that's required by my
[17:52] relationship to God
[17:54] he says in this commandment is not
[17:56] Grievous meaning heavy or weighty I
[17:58] think is the other ways that it's
[17:59] translated but it's not burdensome
[18:02] severe violent cruel unsparing or
[18:07] trouble
[18:09] this is the love of God that will keep
[18:12] and guard
[18:13] his his word we'll keep it pure so it
[18:17] it's obedience but it's also it's
[18:20] preserving what the intent of it it's
[18:23] the value of it to keep pure to keep
[18:25] hold to reserve it to take care of it
[18:27] and and as I keep the word this isn't
[18:30] trouble for me
[18:31] it doesn't trouble me to do it in other
[18:33] words I don't find my soul
[18:35] unrest I don't find my peace taken away
[18:38] from me it's not violent it's not cruel
[18:41] it's not severe to keep the word of God
[18:44] now if we could keep that in mind that
[18:46] in keeping the word of God it's not
[18:48] severe or violent
[18:50] that this is this is the love of God
[18:52] that I keep his Commandments and in
[18:55] keeping it I don't find myself brought
[18:57] down
[18:59] I find that in keeping the word of God
[19:00] it's not violent or cruel
[19:03] this reveals the true nature of love
[19:05] this this reveals how it looks how it
[19:08] manifests the character and traits of
[19:11] love
[19:12] if you look at Romans chapter 13 verses
[19:15] 8 to 10 with me
[19:17] he says oh no man anything but to love
[19:20] one another so it says that we have some
[19:22] debt of love to one another
[19:24] for he that loveth another hath
[19:26] fulfilled the law now that's that's
[19:28] quite a mouthful that when I have loved
[19:31] you I have fulfilled the law he says for
[19:33] this Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou
[19:35] shalt not kill Thou shalt not steal Thou
[19:37] shalt not bear false witness Thou shalt
[19:39] not covet and if there be any other
[19:42] commandment it is briefly comprehended
[19:44] in this saying namely Thou shalt love
[19:46] thy neighbor as thyself
[19:48] we've already identified how Jesus
[19:50] Christ teaches this very thing that this
[19:52] is all the law and the prophets hang on
[19:54] this
[19:55] that they can all be summarized in this
[19:58] Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
[20:01] and he says love worketh no ill to his
[20:04] neighbor
[20:06] therefore love is the fulfilling of the
[20:09] law
[20:10] I think that says that to me
[20:13] is significant as we've already read it
[20:15] in Galatians that all law is fulfilled
[20:17] in one word
[20:18] to love thy neighbor as thyself
[20:21] uh I think that's something we ought to
[20:22] constantly remind ourselves of because
[20:24] the Bible's saying it and it's written
[20:26] right now very plainly it's repeated
[20:28] several times there's often emphasis in
[20:30] it that all the law is fulfilled in one
[20:32] word to love thy neighbor as thyself and
[20:34] again it instructs us that we have to
[20:36] love ourselves correctly to love our
[20:38] neighbors correctly those of us who are
[20:40] self-loathing and hate ourselves and you
[20:43] know can't love ourselves or forgive
[20:45] ourselves it may be why we treat
[20:46] everyone else the same way but there's
[20:49] there's a lot more in there there's a
[20:50] lot in it love thy neighbor as thyself
[20:52] it says love worketh no ill to his
[20:55] neighbor therefore love is the
[20:57] fulfilling of the law
[20:58] so love renders when it says oh no man
[21:01] anything but to love one another love
[21:03] renders what is due
[21:05] and we say what is due it's not what you
[21:07] think it is but it's what's proper
[21:09] what's right
[21:11] not so much as a debt or obligation but
[21:13] because it's right
[21:15] so when love gives what is due and you
[21:17] owe the debt to love one another it's
[21:20] not because you're in deficit but it's
[21:22] because it's what is right
[21:24] this is what is expected of Christians
[21:26] this is how Christians ought to act in
[21:29] their words and their attitude and their
[21:30] treatment of other people that they
[21:32] ought to love one another because it's
[21:35] right
[21:37] and so as we've said before perfect love
[21:39] preserves God's perfect will this is
[21:42] righteousness
[21:44] this is just this is pure
[21:47] and and we could say that if you're
[21:48] keeping God's will that you you you're
[21:51] under this injunction to do what is
[21:53] right and it's to love one another
[21:56] and it's saying in loving one another
[21:58] you'll never do any of the things he
[21:59] mentions here
[22:01] Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou
[22:02] shalt not kill Thou shalt not steal thus
[22:03] shall not bear false witness they shall
[22:05] not covet there be any other commandment
[22:07] there it's all briefly comprehended in
[22:09] this saying in other words he's saying
[22:10] if you'll love your neighbor as yourself
[22:12] you will not do any of these things
[22:15] the same is said of what he says in the
[22:17] works of the flesh adultery fornication
[22:18] uncleanness lasciviousness idolatry
[22:21] witchcraft hatred variance emulations
[22:23] wrath Strife seditions heresies Indians
[22:25] murders drunkenness revilings and such
[22:27] the like these are all associated with
[22:30] not loving your neighbor as yourself
[22:35] because it says in loving your neighbor
[22:37] you cannot work ill
[22:39] that means evil
[22:41] or wickedness
[22:43] you cannot act with the bad motive
[22:45] towards your neighbor
[22:46] you cannot act with the wrong objective
[22:49] if you say well I heard where if if
[22:51] they've ever heard the truth they're
[22:53] condemned and so I hate them so much I'm
[22:55] going to share the truth with them and
[22:56] hope he rejects it
[22:58] that's the wrong motive
[23:01] to say that it works no ill it's not
[23:03] destructive or injurious
[23:05] love cannot work evil towards somebody
[23:08] else love cannot work wickedness towards
[23:11] someone else
[23:16] amen now
[23:19] I know that there's there's a thought
[23:20] here we say okay it can't work evil it
[23:24] can't be Wicked
[23:26] it it can have the wrong motive can't be
[23:28] jealous
[23:29] it can't hate can't have variance
[23:32] and I want to say it this way but it
[23:34] also cannot compromise the word of God
[23:38] and you can certainly compromise the
[23:40] word of God in any one of those
[23:41] attributes
[23:43] but we cannot compromise the word of God
[23:45] for the sake of quote unquote loving our
[23:48] neighbors
[23:50] in other words loving your neighbor
[23:51] cannot directly cause confusion
[23:53] regarding God's word
[23:55] loving your neighbor cannot pervert
[23:57] God's will
[23:59] cannot pervert God's word you can say
[24:01] well I'm just loving my neighbor and
[24:03] cause confusion about God's attitude I'm
[24:05] just loving my brother and serving my
[24:07] brother and cause confusion about what
[24:08] God's word is I think that that kind of
[24:10] begins to open up a little bit depth to
[24:13] it to where we should never be hateful
[24:14] we should never be spiteful we should
[24:16] never be arrogant we should never be
[24:18] cruel we should never be injurious but
[24:20] we cannot love if we're not keeping
[24:23] God's word but I'm keeping it pure if
[24:25] we're not standing for truth and
[24:26] standing for what is right
[24:28] in Genesis chapter 4 verse 7 after Cain
[24:30] after Abel's sacrifices uh received by
[24:34] God and God had respect unto able
[24:36] sacrifice and Cain gets very very angry
[24:38] and God says to Cain if thou doest well
[24:41] shalt thou not be accepted
[24:43] and if thou doest not well sin lieth at
[24:45] the door
[24:46] and I believe next week when we pick up
[24:49] on love and hate we'll touch more on
[24:51] this hopefully next week
[24:53] but God's love in this instance this was
[24:55] God's love being projected to Cain
[24:58] and it did not change in the presence of
[25:01] Cain being the very soul and or angry
[25:04] it did not change truth
[25:07] our god did not change the Revelation to
[25:09] make it any easier he didn't see Cain
[25:10] get all upset and go oh whoa you know
[25:13] what calm down and God didn't say now if
[25:15] I don't just step in and let them get
[25:17] happy with what he offered he's going to
[25:19] end up killing Abel God did not
[25:20] compromise
[25:22] he did not Pat Kane on the back he just
[25:24] said well if you'll just do what your
[25:27] brother did if you'll just do right
[25:29] you'll be accepted he says but if you
[25:30] don't that's sin
[25:32] and that was this is this is how that
[25:35] God is showing love even decaying by
[25:37] giving an opportunity to know what is
[25:39] right love in that situation didn't say
[25:41] oh poor Cain he's at a disadvantage
[25:43] because he's just born a little bit
[25:44] different he's got these Tendencies and
[25:47] you know you know maybe it's unfair to
[25:49] have him you know be hacking a lamb and
[25:51] getting blood everywhere you know after
[25:53] all it's a pretty pretty nice job there
[25:55] Kane it's real beautiful altar God could
[25:57] not do it because love wouldn't let him
[26:00] and the notice in Mark chapter 10 when
[26:02] the Rich Young Ruler came and is
[26:03] requesting what it would take uh to live
[26:06] forever and how do you have eternal life
[26:07] it says then Jesus beholding him loved
[26:10] him
[26:11] now we can say oh that he had love but
[26:14] the word there is beholding him he
[26:16] projected love to him he showed him love
[26:20] and that's what it means to love one
[26:22] another it's to show love it's it it's
[26:25] that it's that projection of love and
[26:27] the spreading of love because if you
[26:28] can't just say that it's it's not the
[26:31] same Union that the believer has with
[26:32] God and the love between them but now
[26:34] it's a projection of love
[26:35] and he says beholding him loved him and
[26:38] he said said unto him you're perfect the
[26:41] way you are are just pay your tithes
[26:44] keep doing what you're doing and you'll
[26:46] have Treasures in Heaven and you'll live
[26:48] forever
[26:51] wait a minute
[26:52] sorry
[26:54] I was reading the newfangled Bible
[26:59] one thing about lack us well that's real
[27:01] nice right gonna come gonna cut right to
[27:04] the chase of where he's lacking go thy
[27:06] way and he hit somewhere it hurts sell
[27:09] whatsoever thou Hast and give to the
[27:11] poor and thou shalt have treasure in
[27:13] heaven and come take up the cross and
[27:16] follow me
[27:17] so it says Jesus beholding him loved him
[27:20] and said unto him what he said is how he
[27:23] loved them
[27:25] he projected love he loved him when love
[27:27] he projected left him by speaking truth
[27:30] but not compromising and saying ah you
[27:32] know what he probably needs to sell
[27:34] everything but he's a rich guy he's
[27:35] lived a certain way he's young Let Him
[27:37] Live his life this is his opportunity
[27:39] but he told him what he needed to hear
[27:42] and we know the words that he speak
[27:43] spoke word those given to him by the
[27:45] father but here he is when Jesus asked
[27:49] him to do this one thing you lack that's
[27:52] love
[27:53] he spoke a hard saying to him and he
[27:55] projected love to him and he told the
[27:56] truth to him and this is how he loved
[27:58] his neighbor
[28:00] and and when he asked him to do this
[28:02] sell everything
[28:04] take up a cross in this there's loss
[28:06] there's sacrifice there's a burden
[28:08] there's a change of Lifestyle there's an
[28:09] upheaval of everything that he would
[28:11] love and a letting go of things that
[28:13] were dear to him and maybe a life of
[28:15] trouble ahead of him but what Jesus
[28:16] asked him to do was not injury
[28:19] because the love worketh no ill to your
[28:21] neighbor there's no evil though there
[28:23] was pain
[28:25] there was no evil even though there
[28:27] might be some hurt
[28:30] there was no evil though it might be
[28:31] hard
[28:33] because that's what love is
[28:36] love is keeping God's word even if it
[28:39] hurts
[28:41] and I find that
[28:43] obeying's real easy until it hurts
[28:47] Luke chapter 6 verse 27 it says but I
[28:51] say unto you which here love your
[28:52] enemies
[28:53] do good to them which hate you
[28:58] have we studied this out to find out
[28:59] whether or not he really said this
[29:01] because this is problematic
[29:03] right
[29:05] to those who hear love your enemies
[29:10] any person any church any organization
[29:12] any individual brother Branham said any
[29:14] church any organization
[29:16] any person that reasons against one
[29:18] punctuation of God's word is your enemy
[29:21] right
[29:22] and you're to love them
[29:25] even those that are anti-word
[29:28] even though that are untied to the
[29:30] spirit those that walk in the work in
[29:31] the works of this flesh those that walk
[29:33] against the spirit says love your
[29:35] enemies do good to them which hate you
[29:39] to love your enemy and to do good
[29:42] requires both the absence of evil
[29:45] but it also requires the presence of
[29:46] Truth
[29:48] you cannot love your enemies and do good
[29:50] unto them and do evil so not only does
[29:52] it require the absence of evil but it
[29:54] requires the presence of truth because
[29:56] you can't actually love them
[29:58] by essentially keeping silent or
[30:00] becoming a chameleon
[30:03] and trying to become inoffensive
[30:06] for the sake of not offending
[30:09] I say the highest form of love you can
[30:10] show towards your enemies is Manifest in
[30:12] the true nature of the word
[30:14] it's the highest form of love that you
[30:16] can show to your enemies is by
[30:18] manifesting the true nature of the word
[30:19] if you knew that God required something
[30:23] of someone and they're doing something
[30:26] against the word of God it's not the
[30:28] love of God to mock them it's not the
[30:30] love of God to condemn them it's not the
[30:32] love of God uh to kind of whisper about
[30:34] them behind your back but to project
[30:35] love would be to show them the right way
[30:39] in first Thessalonians 5 15 see that
[30:41] none render evil for evil unto any man
[30:45] but ever followed that which is good
[30:47] both among yourselves and to all men
[30:51] speaking evil
[30:52] lying being envious the competitiveness
[30:56] the malice against one another towards
[30:58] someone is not love
[31:00] to be competitive with someone is not
[31:02] love to be jealous of someone in this
[31:04] base sort is not love to speak evil of
[31:07] somebody is not loved to lie about
[31:08] somebody's not love
[31:13] amen is that I hope it's maybe not for
[31:16] maybe it's you're thinking this is about
[31:17] as simple as brother Aaron has ever been
[31:19] in his life and that means I'm improving
[31:23] good
[31:24] but I want I hope that you can just just
[31:27] see how simple and plainness is
[31:30] that we are to love one another but if
[31:32] we're actually loving one another it's
[31:34] in the nature of the word of God it's
[31:36] protective of God's perfect will
[31:38] it won't cause confusion about what
[31:40] God's word is because there's sometimes
[31:42] people say well I did that because I
[31:43] want to be a witness
[31:45] or you know I did this because I was
[31:47] wanting to show love and and I'm not
[31:49] using any specifics maybe I have some in
[31:51] mind uh but it's important to take a
[31:54] step back and ask yourself as much as I
[31:56] was trying to show myself friendly as
[31:58] much as I'm trying to show love to my
[31:59] family as much as I was trying to be
[32:01] considerate and sensitive did it cause
[32:03] confusion about the word of God did it
[32:06] cause confusion about where your
[32:07] loyalties lie did it cause confusion
[32:09] about what the right way is
[32:13] and I guess I could also say the
[32:14] opposite that sometimes when we're
[32:16] wanting to make a point that they're
[32:17] wrong the way you do it does it cause
[32:20] confusion about the nature of God does
[32:23] it cause confusion about the spirit of
[32:24] God
[32:26] now in each one of these things that you
[32:29] to you oh uh you owe it to love one
[32:31] another because to love one another is
[32:32] fulfilling the law that love works no
[32:34] evil or malice towards his neighbor
[32:37] that in doing that you are not
[32:40] compromising and cannot compromise the
[32:42] word of God in loving your neighbor
[32:44] because if you compromise the word of
[32:45] God to love you have not loved your
[32:47] neighbor
[32:48] and so there's a lot of things that we
[32:50] could say it is not there's maybe a lot
[32:51] of things we could say it is
[32:53] but when it says to love your neighbor
[32:55] it says nothing about your neighbor's
[32:57] response
[32:59] it says nothing about how the world
[33:00] feels when it says do good to them which
[33:03] hate you and love your enemies the way
[33:05] that we love them it says nothing about
[33:07] the world's response it says nothing
[33:08] about their pinion but that loving
[33:11] doing God's will is never cruel or never
[33:14] violent
[33:18] I had it I think maybe it might be in my
[33:20] notes for next Wednesday where Paul when
[33:21] he's standing up in Acts 2 24 he says
[33:23] I've been here several days and you
[33:26] don't see me causing a revolt
[33:27] right I'm not in the temple causing
[33:29] trouble I'm not out trying to stir stuff
[33:31] up I'm not trying to start a a coup or a
[33:34] revolt
[33:36] because keeping God's word does not
[33:39] enjoying us to ever be cruel or violent
[33:44] so if I with that I I kind of want to
[33:47] just take a step further and it connects
[33:49] back to keeping his Commandments
[33:52] perfect love is not subjection by fear
[33:55] or by force
[33:58] because this perfect love is not owed
[34:00] in the sense of debt that we might think
[34:03] it was or poverty
[34:05] when we love God it says and we keep his
[34:07] Commandments and his Commandments are
[34:09] not Grievous
[34:10] in other words when we love God our
[34:12] desire is to guard and to take care of
[34:15] his word
[34:16] when we love God our joy is to fulfill
[34:19] his word
[34:20] so our our action is willingly given
[34:24] it's not this task that says well if you
[34:26] love God
[34:27] um you'll go to church
[34:29] and how many people go to church with
[34:31] this idea that somehow by going they
[34:34] love God when they're only going because
[34:36] they take attendance
[34:39] they're only going because they don't
[34:41] want to prove themselves to be a fraud
[34:43] by not going I think I said it in the
[34:45] very beginning that I never wanted to
[34:47] create a culture in this church where
[34:48] people go to be seen or they go because
[34:51] they don't want people thinking what's
[34:52] wrong with them they're not there and
[34:54] hey if it creates the kind of culture
[34:56] where it's easy for people not to go to
[34:57] church I get it that's maybe the
[34:59] downside but it's so much better when
[35:02] everyone there wants to be there can I
[35:05] get a witness whoa
[35:08] right
[35:09] it's so much better when the people are
[35:11] there there because they love God and
[35:14] that's when you have a beautiful Feast
[35:16] of Charity when we're yeah it was hard
[35:19] to be here and yeah maybe there's other
[35:20] things to do and and I had to claw my
[35:22] way through hell it seemed to get here
[35:23] but I want to be here why do you want to
[35:25] be here well if I'm not there I'm not a
[35:27] Christian
[35:28] no I'm there because I love God I'm
[35:30] there because there's benefits I get
[35:32] from I'm there because I love the people
[35:33] of God and I recognize that my presence
[35:36] there is also a benefit to somebody else
[35:40] that's why they I guess I think I've
[35:42] joked about it here that when you go to
[35:44] church on Sunday morning
[35:46] you you you love church you go on Sunday
[35:48] evening you love your pastor and that's
[35:50] why we don't have a Sunday evening
[35:51] service
[35:53] and if you go on Wednesday nights it's
[35:54] because you love the word
[35:56] and the truth is That's why you should
[35:58] be there anytime when the doors are open
[35:59] when you're a Christian and you want to
[36:02] be there because the doors are open it's
[36:03] love that does that
[36:05] Islam that drives you to do it
[36:09] it's something willingly given it's a
[36:11] desire to keep his word it's a desire to
[36:12] guard it and I hope that as we are kind
[36:15] of wrapping this up here soon that it
[36:17] there's a a depth to that where it's not
[36:20] just the Bible says to do this okay I'm
[36:23] going to do it but there's something
[36:25] that quickens you to be like wow yeah I
[36:28] get it don't you all that are here
[36:30] tonight get why this being at church on
[36:32] Wednesday night's important that's why
[36:33] you're here
[36:34] you really this isn't just a worthless
[36:35] exercise when I see families that drive
[36:38] uh long distances to be here on a
[36:39] Wednesday night they're not just doing
[36:41] it because they're earning miles
[36:44] right there's no executive Platinum
[36:46] level they're going to get lean into
[36:47] sometime in July they're doing it
[36:49] because they recognize the value and
[36:51] benefit of it and why God makes it
[36:52] available and why God asks for them to
[36:54] do it
[36:57] now if I could say maybe I'm trying to
[36:59] find the right words to say this
[37:01] to love God and perfect love is not
[37:04] subjection
[37:06] it's not bondage by force or fear
[37:10] it's not
[37:12] necessarily to keep his word is not
[37:14] necessarily what love demands
[37:16] but it is what it does when it's
[37:19] perfected
[37:21] it's not so much that well it's demanded
[37:23] but it's what it does when it's
[37:25] perfected
[37:26] because when we come back to perfect
[37:28] love cast out fear
[37:31] it's when you do what when you willingly
[37:34] and by Desire by love want to keep God's
[37:37] word and do what his word ask you it's
[37:40] because you trust his will
[37:42] you trust him that you trust that what
[37:45] he's asking you to do that even if it's
[37:47] not perfectly understood love desires to
[37:49] keep the word
[37:51] that you recognize that you know what I
[37:53] may not understand all the consequences
[37:55] or implication I may not understand
[37:57] perfectly why I'm being asked to do this
[37:59] but there's something inside of you that
[38:01] recognizes this is the word of God and
[38:03] God has purpose he has intent he has
[38:05] meaning behind it and therefore I desire
[38:08] to keep it because I know that God means
[38:10] well
[38:12] it comes back to even how Jesus
[38:14] expresses if any one of you if your son
[38:16] would ask you for bread would you give
[38:18] him a stone because even in that there's
[38:20] this trust and there's this
[38:21] understanding it love trust the desire
[38:23] or the Need Love wants to meet the need
[38:25] what love wants to remove all the
[38:27] berries and all the obstructions and so
[38:29] when we love God it's not that we have
[38:30] to completely figure it out but there's
[38:32] a part of us that trust what he's asking
[38:34] us to do
[38:37] so second John 1 6 and this is love that
[38:40] we walk after his Commandments
[38:43] this is the Commandment that as you have
[38:45] heard from the beginning you should walk
[38:46] in it
[38:49] and let me emphasize this love is the
[38:51] gift of God
[38:54] it's not something that we must find
[38:55] ourselves
[38:57] and find within ourselves first
[39:00] and then bring to him as a debt
[39:02] that if I love God I'll keep his
[39:05] commandments so I got to First find that
[39:07] I love him
[39:09] and then bring it to him as if I owe it
[39:11] to him or bring it to him as if it's a
[39:13] debt this love is a gift
[39:16] it's not something you're going to find
[39:17] within yourself first and then present
[39:19] to him as if you owed it to him but it
[39:21] is it is a gift of God and John is not
[39:24] saying that love is a task or love is a
[39:26] chore but love has a nature love has an
[39:28] Evidence this is the love of God that
[39:30] you keep his Commandments and it's not a
[39:32] it's not violence to you it's not
[39:34] trouble it's not severe this isn't
[39:36] slavery this is this is something you're
[39:38] voluntarily and willing to do because of
[39:41] love
[39:43] because it's this is how love manifests
[39:46] itself
[39:47] now if you've had the if you've had if
[39:49] you've thought about this statement then
[39:51] then we're on the same kind of the same
[39:53] level in the same wavelength if you
[39:54] hadn't I think this might
[39:56] kind of shove something into view that's
[39:58] going to be very thought provoking
[40:00] because God loves us
[40:03] and we know he does because he told us
[40:05] and because he sent his son to die for
[40:07] us he manifested it he he loved us
[40:10] initially by having love for us and then
[40:13] he projected love to us in action by
[40:15] sending his son to die for us and that's
[40:17] how we know and can perceive the love of
[40:19] God so herein we know the love of God
[40:21] because he told us and he proved it
[40:24] and then the question is well how shall
[40:26] I prove my love to him
[40:29] how is it that I love him by keeping his
[40:31] Commandments right and his Commandments
[40:33] are not Grievous to me
[40:35] how do I keep his how do I keep I shall
[40:37] prove my love to him I know that I love
[40:39] the children of God when I love God and
[40:41] keep his Commandments how do I prove his
[40:42] love how do I prove my love to him how
[40:44] do I show that I love him by loving one
[40:46] another because loving is fulfilling the
[40:48] law all these things begin to line up
[40:50] and then notice how brother Branham says
[40:51] it in the church age book and how shall
[40:53] I prove my love to him by believing what
[40:55] he said
[40:56] and then this this remarkable phrase and
[40:58] by conducting myself with joy admits the
[41:01] trials that he and his wisdom allows to
[41:04] come to pass
[41:06] that's a hard thing
[41:08] I have failed this time and time again
[41:12] I prove my love it's the manifestation
[41:15] of his love in my life when I can
[41:17] conduct myself above my trials
[41:19] it's the proof of my love to him when I
[41:22] trust him whenever I'm going through
[41:24] that we could say this that if
[41:27] and and maybe maybe it's best left for
[41:30] the some of these future services but if
[41:32] God allows something to happen
[41:35] his word tells me that that must be
[41:37] material that God can use for good
[41:41] because all things work together for the
[41:42] good
[41:44] that that there has to be something
[41:45] about the love of God to where he has
[41:48] his his thoughts about me what he's a
[41:50] plan for me he has a predestinated
[41:52] objective for me as the object of his
[41:54] love he's going to bring me to
[41:56] Perfection and that Perfection changes
[41:58] where I'm at presently
[42:00] but not only does it change where I'm at
[42:02] presently it redeems my past because
[42:04] love reaches back and says I can use
[42:06] that I can use that I can use that I can
[42:08] use that no matter what it is because
[42:10] the Bible says he works all things
[42:12] together for the good to them that love
[42:14] God
[42:15] so my if I love him it tells me that my
[42:18] past is material that God can use for
[42:21] good
[42:24] and so conducting myself with joy in the
[42:27] midst of the trials which he and his
[42:28] wisdom allows to come to pass that I
[42:31] would say that's when love would pay off
[42:33] right that's Love's payoff
[42:36] but isn't it hard
[42:38] isn't it hard to do
[42:40] it's difficult
[42:42] we've been trying to approach these
[42:43] scriptures from the standpoint to where
[42:44] we don't create a litmus test to say ah
[42:46] well if you fear you don't have love but
[42:48] says no that's what Love's for
[42:51] and I will say this that I know for
[42:52] myself
[42:54] my some of my biggest regrets
[42:57] have to do it the way not because the
[42:59] trial I went through but the way I
[43:00] conducted myself in the midst of it
[43:03] and I believe there may have been a time
[43:04] in my life where I wrestled with God's
[43:07] will when it comes to the trial and
[43:09] there's things that we'll face in life
[43:10] very terrible things very horrible
[43:12] gut-wrenching things and unfaithfulness
[43:14] and sin and and things that we know are
[43:17] pure evil and you'll face it you'll and
[43:19] you'll wrestle with whether or not it's
[43:21] God's will when you say it's contrary to
[43:22] God's will in his word that one would do
[43:25] that but if it's happening to you you
[43:27] have to believe that God can work all
[43:30] things together for the good
[43:33] and then the part that I had to learn is
[43:35] that even in the face of things that
[43:37] clearly to me would be unfaithful and
[43:39] against God's word that if he allows it
[43:42] to come to pass it's his wisdom that has
[43:44] allowed it
[43:45] and that you do not have to wrestle with
[43:47] whether or not this is a trial that God
[43:49] under wisdom allowed to come to pass
[43:51] because there's no way that you could
[43:53] ever say aha this is a trial that God in
[43:55] his wisdom did not allow in his wisdom
[43:57] this one got by God
[44:00] right so if you're going through a trial
[44:02] it means his wisdom let it through
[44:05] all the trials are lining up they're all
[44:07] just kind of lining up trying to get you
[44:09] can I get some can I get them I'm here
[44:10] can I get to him can I get to him I want
[44:12] to get to him I want to cause financial
[44:13] trouble I want to ruin their marriage
[44:14] can I get to him can I get to him
[44:15] they're all trying to get in there and
[44:17] God is wisdom is saying no you can go
[44:18] but you can
[44:21] his wisdom has allowed it to come
[44:23] so no matter what it is if you're going
[44:25] through it his wisdom has allowed it to
[44:27] come to pass so it's in that moment at a
[44:29] time I must conduct myself for Joy
[44:31] amidst the trials that he and his wisdom
[44:34] allows to come to pass
[44:37] now joyful conduct
[44:40] I want you to think about it in terms of
[44:44] there's a there's a true joyful conduct
[44:46] and then there's the one we think of
[44:47] right that when we're going through it
[44:49] it just means kind of skipping along and
[44:51] happy and so how are you doing brother
[44:53] oh you won't believe it guess what
[44:56] everything's falling apart everything's
[44:59] burning at this very moment and I'm just
[45:03] Tickle Pink
[45:05] I mean this guy's an arsonist right he
[45:08] set it on fire he must have got an
[45:10] insurance policy why is this guy well no
[45:12] this is Joy uh it could be delusion you
[45:15] could be you could be completely uh not
[45:19] con you know grasping the situation but
[45:21] there's a Godly sorrow I want to look at
[45:23] this in scripture there's a Godly song
[45:24] There's a worldly sorrow
[45:26] so there's a Godly joy and there's a
[45:29] worldly Joy
[45:30] Paul said in a way that's caused called
[45:32] heresy
[45:33] he served the Lord in a way that against
[45:35] acceptable conduct and the way it's
[45:37] against uh acceptable opinion and the
[45:40] way that I call heresy in other words
[45:41] there's an accepted reality there's an
[45:43] accepted truth and you're worshiping God
[45:45] in a way that's not accepted
[45:47] so to conduct ourselves with joy may be
[45:49] in a way that's not acceptable to the
[45:51] world
[45:52] it may be in a way that's contrary to
[45:54] popular opinion so as we think about
[45:56] this in second Corinthians 7 10 it says
[45:58] for Godly sorrow worketh repentance to
[46:00] Salvation not to be repented of but the
[46:03] sorrow of the world worketh death
[46:05] if you have time go back and reread this
[46:07] chapter chapter seven for that before
[46:08] next Wednesday or maybe in preparation
[46:11] for the service Godly sorrow Works
[46:13] repentance but there's a worldly saw
[46:15] that worketh death
[46:16] so there's a counterpart if there's a
[46:18] Godly sorrow and a worldly sorrow
[46:20] there's a Godly joy and a worldly Joy
[46:23] first Thessalonians 4 13 but I would not
[46:25] have you be ignorant Brethren concerning
[46:26] them which are asleep that you sorrow
[46:28] not even as others which have no hope
[46:31] isn't this what we remind ourselves of
[46:34] when we see a loved one pass away and a
[46:36] Christian pass away as we say look as
[46:38] Christians we don't cry like the world
[46:39] cries we don't grieve like the world
[46:41] Grieves yes we grieve yes we sorrow
[46:44] Sorrowing and grieving is an act of
[46:45] praise and it's okay to Saul it's okay
[46:48] to grief but we don't do it like the
[46:49] world it's not tormenting it doesn't Rob
[46:52] us of our peace in Christ that there's a
[46:55] type of grieving and mulling over
[46:56] something and turning it over and
[46:58] turning over they'll lead you to
[46:59] questioning God and lead you to abandon
[47:01] your faith and lead you to despondency
[47:03] and depression but there's a way that
[47:05] you can grieve in a Godly way
[47:07] as there's Godly sorrow that leads to
[47:09] repentance in a worldly Saul that leads
[47:10] to death we don't sorrow like the world
[47:13] as those that do not have hope
[47:16] so there's a worldly joy and there's a
[47:18] Godly Joy
[47:19] I want to conduct myself with Godly Joy
[47:21] amidst the trials that he and his wisdom
[47:22] allows to come to pass
[47:25] if I could say our say this our conduct
[47:27] During trials are different
[47:30] than the worldly response
[47:33] I read this this is in a letter that
[47:36] brother Vincent van Gogh
[47:38] wrote in a letter to Theo in 1877 but it
[47:41] struck me and it was in reading some of
[47:43] these letters that inspired me actually
[47:44] on the series on perfect love
[47:47] I know some of you may only know Van
[47:48] Gogh in his end but listen to what he
[47:50] writes he says there is something better
[47:52] than the glory of worldly things
[47:54] it is the feeling when our hearts burn
[47:56] within us on hearing the word
[47:58] that is faith in God love for Christ
[48:01] belief in more immoral in immortality in
[48:04] a life after this life
[48:07] there's something better than the glory
[48:09] of worldly things
[48:11] and he said what is it it's the feeling
[48:13] in our hearts that burn within us on
[48:14] hearing his word
[48:15] and what is it that's faith in God love
[48:18] for Christ
[48:19] it's belief in immortality what is it
[48:21] that's burning in our hearts as
[48:22] Christians when we hear the word of God
[48:23] it's eternity
[48:25] it's life after it's life beyond this
[48:26] life
[48:27] sometimes we say life after this life
[48:29] and we think in this chronology in the
[48:31] sense that once this Earth is over
[48:33] everything's gone and we slip into
[48:34] heaven or we slip into hell but it's
[48:36] life beyond this life it's real life now
[48:38] there's a real life and he says there's
[48:40] something better than the glory of
[48:42] worldly things there's something better
[48:43] than the joy of worldly things there's
[48:45] something better than the happiness this
[48:47] world brings it's the feeling in our
[48:48] hearts burning within us when we hear
[48:50] the word what is it that is faith in God
[48:52] and love for Christ
[48:54] so when brother Branham says conduct
[48:56] myself with joy it's different than
[48:57] worldly happiness
[49:00] and if you hadn't kind of already
[49:01] figured out what I where I'm leading
[49:03] with this this joyful conduct is keeping
[49:05] the word
[49:07] it has to be
[49:08] because how is it that we prove our love
[49:10] for him by keeping his Commandments how
[49:12] else can we conduct ourselves a joy
[49:14] unless we're keeping his word
[49:18] third John verse 4 says I have no
[49:20] Greater Joy than to hear that my
[49:22] children walk in truth
[49:26] There's No Greater Joy
[49:28] has anyone ever said to you and I don't
[49:30] mind if you give a hearty amen or throw
[49:32] your hand in the air unless maybe the
[49:33] person who said it here is here and you
[49:35] you want to be a little bit discreet and
[49:37] you could just kind of do that
[49:38] that one you do
[49:40] but has anyone ever said to you well I
[49:42] hope you're happy
[49:46] anybody okay thank you
[49:49] and you knew they didn't mean it
[49:52] well I hope you're happy
[49:54] I hope you just have the time of your
[49:56] life
[49:59] they don't really mean it
[50:00] what there's no real it's it's this
[50:04] sarcastic kind of Catty thing well I
[50:06] hope you're happy and and there's hatred
[50:08] behind it
[50:10] and and I believe that as Christians
[50:14] we can be sincere
[50:17] when someone stares truth in the face
[50:19] and leaves it
[50:21] and says they're happier and I believe
[50:22] the love of God can say in our hearts
[50:24] well I'm happy for you
[50:27] and I'm glad you're happy
[50:30] but I would have no Greater Joy
[50:33] than to see you walk in truth
[50:36] that's not incompatible
[50:39] I know maybe it's kind of late all of a
[50:41] sudden open up that box
[50:44] but I have no Greater Joy than to hear
[50:47] that my children rocked in truth I could
[50:49] say as a father that I do desire above
[50:51] all that my children would walk in truth
[50:54] and that I believe is by election
[50:58] and so maybe second to that I want them
[51:00] to be happy I don't want them to be full
[51:02] of anxiety I want I don't want them to
[51:04] be despondent I don't want them to be
[51:06] troubled I don't want them to live their
[51:07] lives in fear and bound by complexes
[51:10] I have no Greater Joy than to hear that
[51:13] my children walk in truth
[51:15] and as this relates to conducting myself
[51:17] with joy and that joyful conduct is
[51:20] doing God's will because there's no
[51:22] Greater Joy than children walking truth
[51:23] why because they'll find no greater
[51:25] happiness than walking in truth so my
[51:28] joy is commiserate with their Joy they
[51:30] will find no greater satisfaction you
[51:32] cannot find any I could say and I
[51:34] testify tonight and I know that I'm not
[51:36] alone but I say this to young people and
[51:38] to strangers There Is No Greater Joy in
[51:40] this world than loving God
[51:43] There's No Greater Joy than walking in
[51:46] truth
[51:46] and when you love somebody somebody you
[51:48] want that forum
[51:51] and in John chapter 13 verse 17 after
[51:54] Jesus has given the Commandments to wash
[51:56] one another's feet he says if you know
[51:57] these things
[51:59] happy re if you do them
[52:04] now
[52:07] I feel like such a rookie preacher
[52:10] to try to close on this because now
[52:13] we've just we've been hammering against
[52:15] something and now it's just it's just
[52:17] opened up and we're all going to be like
[52:20] okay now we need to stick around for a
[52:22] while or maybe it's just me
[52:26] but if you know these things
[52:28] happy are you if you do them
[52:30] this knowledge is not like the world
[52:35] intellectual faith
[52:39] produces anxiety and misery in doing
[52:44] people who have tried to serve God and
[52:46] serve the message and fulfill the word
[52:48] of God through intellectual Faith find
[52:50] themselves bound with anxiety bound with
[52:53] fear bound that depression bound with so
[52:57] many uh hatred bitterness
[53:00] those that have tried to subject others
[53:02] through their intellectual Faith have
[53:04] sown into people fear left a bad taste
[53:07] in their mouth according to the word of
[53:09] God because the Bible says if you know
[53:10] these things happy or if you do them but
[53:12] this knowledge is beyond if you read it
[53:16] do it doesn't mean if you know it in
[53:19] terms of the Bible says to do this but
[53:20] this no here is is deeper than that
[53:24] remember I said religion in church
[53:26] becomes very unsafe when we lose the
[53:28] love side of the love of God this is how
[53:30] religion becomes so unsafe when it
[53:32] becomes Dogma
[53:33] when it demands obedience by Authority
[53:35] and not love when it demands your
[53:37] obedience by Authority not by revelation
[53:41] come on
[53:46] it's when that
[53:47] it's when the word is presented that way
[53:49] as dogma and we're forced to obey it
[53:52] that's why we're not happy in doing
[53:55] because the knowledge that's spoken of
[53:57] here
[53:58] look at verse 7. verse 17 if you know
[54:02] these things happy are you if you do
[54:03] them and he's not just saying did you
[54:06] hear me say it then do it and you'll be
[54:08] happy he says if you know it
[54:11] he says in verse 7
[54:13] Jesus answered and said unto him what I
[54:16] do thou knowest not now
[54:18] but Thou shalt know hereafter
[54:22] and he's not just meaning after I say it
[54:25] what I'm about to do and what I'm doing
[54:27] now you will understand from a semantic
[54:30] standpoint you'll understand from a
[54:32] logistics standpoint they said they're
[54:33] going okay you took a towel you washed
[54:36] the feet how hard is this to duplicate
[54:39] right how hard is it to do this when it
[54:43] all I have to do is say you have to just
[54:44] get a basin wash one another's feet and
[54:47] we're happy if we do it he said no he
[54:49] says you're not going to know it once
[54:51] I've done it you're going to know
[54:52] hereafter
[54:54] when the Holy Spirit reveals to you the
[54:55] purpose when that which is the spirit of
[54:57] truth comes when the when the comforter
[54:59] comes and reveals to you the meaning
[55:02] When Love is the keeping and not just in
[55:04] obeying
[55:06] because he says if you know these things
[55:08] the word they're no is the same cannot
[55:10] see the kingdom of God in other words if
[55:12] you understand these things
[55:15] not if you just know it but if you
[55:16] understand it if you see it in a sense
[55:18] of understanding this is the happiness
[55:20] only true love can bring because you
[55:23] know it's connected with a deeper
[55:24] purpose
[55:25] because the keeping of it is born from
[55:28] love and not bondage and not Duty and
[55:30] not obligation and not not an injury or
[55:32] fear
[55:34] the keeping of it is comes from
[55:36] revelation
[55:38] if you know these things happy are if
[55:41] you do them I want to say it's when
[55:43] knowledge comes by revelation
[55:45] and brother Brahm says Satan hates
[55:46] Revelation but we love it
[55:49] he said he don't like it at all because
[55:51] it upsets his plans
[55:54] in other words there's a lot that he
[55:56] wouldn't he doesn't mind if you do it by
[55:59] the letter but he hates it when you do
[56:00] it by love
[56:02] he hates it when you do it by revelation
[56:04] and he says I have this is how I conduct
[56:07] conduct myself with joy admit in the
[56:09] admits the trials that he and his wisdom
[56:11] allow us to come to pass is if I do the
[56:14] word of God and I'm keeping the word of
[56:16] God that he's revealed to me
[56:20] brother Branham in Christ is the mystery
[56:21] God revealed musicians you could come
[56:23] now he uses the definition from
[56:26] Webster's Dictionary on Revelation it's
[56:28] an act of revealing or communicating
[56:31] Divine truth
[56:33] Revelation is an act of love
[56:38] it's how God gives Joy to the loved
[56:41] it's a stimulation of Revelation
[56:44] that when I'm going through a trial and
[56:46] I'm going through a difficulty I'll find
[56:48] my joy in the revelation of God's word
[56:55] in this statement where brother Graham
[56:56] says it what was once in God's mind is
[56:59] now in the body of Christ
[57:01] Jesus making love to the church
[57:03] Whispering secrets to her
[57:05] in the midst of the trials that he and
[57:07] his wisdom allows to come to pass
[57:09] that's how I can conduct myself with Joy
[57:11] by staying ever connected to the word of
[57:13] God
[57:14] because God is his word
[57:17] and God is love
[57:19] the word will never pass away
[57:21] his love will never pass away and he
[57:23] that keeps the word he too
[57:26] shall never pass away because he's the
[57:28] object of God's love
[57:30] and that love is eternal
[57:32] therefore the love is eternal
[57:35] I hope he opens up another dimension
[57:39] I could say this that it's during those
[57:41] times of grieving
[57:43] times a struggle times a trial when
[57:45] nothing seems to be going right
[57:49] if I could say this I hope this
[57:50] resonates
[57:51] in in a Discerning way
[57:54] you'll find
[57:56] that worldly things are much easier to
[57:59] achieve
[58:01] when things are going bad
[58:04] much easier than
[58:06] keeping the word of God
[58:10] you say oh well things are rough I I
[58:12] can't exercise and I don't eat right and
[58:14] I don't get out and do mow the lawn and
[58:15] for those who live somewhere else and I
[58:18] I I there's all these things that I
[58:20] don't do
[58:21] when I'm going through a tough time and
[58:23] and I say and it may not be easy to do
[58:26] any one of those but you know what's
[58:27] even harder is to keep the word of God
[58:30] to conduct yourself with joy
[58:32] I implore you that in the hard times in
[58:35] the tough times in the weak times stay
[58:37] connected with the stimulation of
[58:39] Revelation
[58:40] do the things you know are right comes
[58:43] back to the very thing that I think that
[58:44] inspired this series in the beginning as
[58:46] I was praying last year about God would
[58:48] want me to minister to the church and
[58:49] what is needful and how he looked at
[58:51] what I know God's will for me this year
[58:53] there's things that we should never lose
[58:55] sight of that we ought to be doing
[58:58] and why is it that one of the first
[58:59] things we stop doing when we go through
[59:01] a hard time is we stop serving one
[59:03] another
[59:04] you stop loving one another
[59:07] it's because those are the things that
[59:08] Satan hates
[59:11] but I encourage you
[59:13] to know deeper no deeper
[59:16] no deeper
[59:18] what love have it loves evidence is
