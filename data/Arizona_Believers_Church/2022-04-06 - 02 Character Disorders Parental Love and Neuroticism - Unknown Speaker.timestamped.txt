[0:00] brother brandon makes this statement he
[0:01] says it's a nervous age
[0:03] what is it then i give this solemn
[0:05] warning to the church stand still
[0:08] god always commands us stand still
[0:11] before he does anything and then he
[0:13] makes this statement the church is in a
[0:15] neurotic stage every church just
[0:17] proselyting and pulling and fussing and
[0:19] stewing it's a neurotic age but stand
[0:23] still
[0:23] and and i want to focus i kind of want
[0:25] to amplify some of these things these
[0:27] comments he's making here on the church
[0:30] is in a neurotic stage that's quite a
[0:32] statement and i think if a uh if a
[0:35] minister
[0:36] if brother brenda makes that statement
[0:38] then it it means something and it's
[0:40] something very important
[0:42] it's good to see you brother matthew
[0:44] i saw somebody on the corner of my eye
[0:46] and didn't know who it was but it's good
[0:48] to see you i was actually just texting
[0:49] you before i walked out so this is an
[0:51] odd an odd manifestation of a response
[0:53] to my text messages but uh god bless you
[0:56] it's good to see you
[0:57] but it says it's a neurotic stage and
[1:00] then he says it's a neurotic age now
[1:02] this is very important because i believe
[1:03] this is a prophet diagnosing certain
[1:05] things
[1:06] and so what i'd like to talk about today
[1:08] and i don't know if this is going to
[1:09] work so i might it might have timed out
[1:12] on me
[1:12] but uh is
[1:14] a second installment on our uh of our
[1:17] segment called character disorders
[1:19] and so
[1:21] this is um
[1:23] would maybe be part two if you're
[1:24] writing it down
[1:25] but this this installment is going to be
[1:27] on parental love and neuroticism and i
[1:30] know that might be somewhat of a catchy
[1:31] phrase but you're going to see just
[1:33] exactly where we drew it from
[1:35] is on this is character disorders and
[1:38] that's kind of the segment which we said
[1:39] we wouldn't necessarily do it in the
[1:40] series things in sequence but god just
[1:42] really i just punched me with it early
[1:44] this morning
[1:46] and and take this this subject of
[1:48] parental love and neuroticism so we have
[1:50] what could be the way we would title it
[1:52] uh zero two character disorders parental
[1:54] love and neuroticism
[1:56] and because of some of the themes
[1:59] with with the adult sermon you get a
[2:01] free kid's entree
[2:03] uh a free kid's meal so it's kids eat
[2:05] free on wednesday night because of the
[2:07] subject matter so almost combining two
[2:09] different things and so aren't you
[2:11] excited about this kids with this the
[2:13] sermon for the adults you're going to
[2:14] get to eat free tonight
[2:16] and we're not sure what that means just
[2:18] yet but maybe we'll all get there
[2:20] eventually now in revelations chapter 3
[2:22] verse 17 it says god is looking at the
[2:25] age and he says and know us not that
[2:27] thou art wretched and miserable and poor
[2:30] and blind and naked this is the
[2:32] assessment of the laodicean age the time
[2:34] that we're living in now
[2:36] different from their own self-estimation
[2:38] or rich we're increased with goods have
[2:40] need of nothing but yet god looks past
[2:42] the exterior the veneer of wealth the
[2:44] veneer of happiness and memes and all
[2:48] sorts of things that make people feel uh
[2:50] that they're doing well but he's
[2:51] identifying this last church age as the
[2:54] worst of all the ages
[2:56] uh one thing that's note is every other
[2:57] age gets a compliment except laodicea
[3:00] and that's something to note and that
[3:01] it's and he's saying the people are
[3:03] afflicted they're uncomfortable if we
[3:04] just put it mildly and we're trying to
[3:07] be politically correct just
[3:08] uncomfortable but the word wretched it
[3:10] means it's a combination of two words
[3:12] which means to endure
[3:14] trial
[3:15] not in the trials that a christian would
[3:16] endure but these are trials and
[3:17] afflictions of uh
[3:19] of the unbeliever of the of the one
[3:21] denying god the one who's lost and
[3:23] anxious
[3:24] and unsettled and so the way that god
[3:27] describes it even as we've already read
[3:29] as the church is in a neurotic stage
[3:31] it's an age
[3:32] that is depressed
[3:34] is in an age that is miserable
[3:36] and brother brandon makes these
[3:37] statements i don't have the slide there
[3:38] but just ponder god's diagnosis of our
[3:41] time now he says this age boasts of its
[3:44] tremendous stores of worldly goods catch
[3:46] the phrase but the people are less happy
[3:48] than ever
[3:50] this age boasts of its spiritual
[3:51] attainments but the people are less sure
[3:53] of themselves than ever isn't it
[3:55] remarkable that when you can get more
[3:57] money it doesn't resolve happiness when
[3:58] you can achieve certain things it
[4:00] doesn't necessarily resolve happiness
[4:01] but they have goods less happy than ever
[4:04] spiritual attainments less sure of
[4:05] themselves than ever key phrase less
[4:07] sure of themselves self-doubt
[4:09] questioning
[4:10] and then he identifies just the
[4:12] advancements in technology going from
[4:14] horse and buggy to the rocket age in
[4:16] just several decades and he says the
[4:18] human mind and soul and spirit cannot
[4:21] comprehend or keep abreast with all the
[4:24] changes that have come upon the earth
[4:26] can't even keep up so why why is it we
[4:28] see certain things rising up why do we
[4:30] see certain problems that are very
[4:31] prevalent we might think that our
[4:33] technological scientific and medical
[4:35] advancements would insulate us or at
[4:37] least help us to overcome certain things
[4:40] but it's actually giving rise to these
[4:42] things and he says that the man cannot
[4:45] keep up with it so there's a
[4:46] psychological impact there's a physical
[4:48] impact
[4:49] i i don't mean to
[4:51] inspire any of the the foil hat people
[4:54] here or the
[4:55] uh are the conspiracy theorists but
[4:57] how do they know that you can't fill up
[4:59] all the spectrums of the bandwidth and
[5:00] there's not a fallout when you do it
[5:02] i shared this with someone the other day
[5:04] in sedona and they said oh that gave me
[5:05] chills i thought oh wait never mind
[5:07] shouldn't be talking about this here in
[5:08] sedona but it's true you don't know what
[5:11] happens when you fill up all the
[5:13] bandwidth could there be a physical
[5:15] fallout and he's saying mankind cannot
[5:17] keep up with this and then he says
[5:19] inside is a dark void cavern that is
[5:21] crying out in torment and without a
[5:24] known reason men's hearts are failing
[5:25] for fear and the world is so darkened
[5:28] that this age could well be called the
[5:30] age of neurotics
[5:33] it's a church he says the church is in
[5:35] it's an erotic stage now we could say as
[5:36] an assessment of not just the church age
[5:39] but god's diagnosis of our time this
[5:42] is prevalent over all society it is an
[5:44] age of neurotics
[5:46] in second timothy chapter 3 verse 1
[5:48] timothy paul writing to timothy says
[5:50] this know also that in the last days
[5:53] perilous times shall come
[5:56] a perilous means hard to take or hard to
[5:59] bear troublesome dangerous it comes from
[6:02] the root to be harsh fierce and savage
[6:04] so we can say these are savage times
[6:06] these are fierce times these are harsh
[6:08] times and therefore it's times that are
[6:10] hard to bear
[6:11] times that are very difficult or
[6:13] troublesome man can't take it and it
[6:15] seems as if how can we go any further
[6:17] how can this continue
[6:19] and brother branham says in this i want
[6:21] to use this kind of as a summation as
[6:22] this introduction of the time that we're
[6:24] living in the spirit of the world today
[6:26] is neurotic
[6:27] identifies in different places how it's
[6:29] just think something's building up it
[6:31] says attention
[6:32] it's pressure
[6:34] it's wearing the mind the mind isn't
[6:37] made to handle these things the body
[6:38] then isn't made to prop up the mind
[6:42] you realize that right the bible even
[6:44] tells us that when a man is sick his
[6:45] spirit will bear him up in his sickness
[6:47] and his weakness of his body the spirit
[6:49] just says hey you got to go to work you
[6:51] just suck it up you pull yourself up by
[6:52] the bootstraps and you get to work you
[6:54] do that by the spirit that's in you but
[6:56] when the spirit gets out of cater and
[6:58] the spirit gets breached the body no
[6:59] matter how strong it is
[7:01] can't just
[7:02] reach in there and tell the spirit come
[7:04] on let's get going you can't train
[7:06] enough to dig down deep and get your
[7:08] spirit in line and so it's a weariness
[7:11] it's a crumbling you're built up all
[7:13] this pressure's built up all this
[7:15] tension and mankind's being impacted by
[7:17] it
[7:19] so we live in a neurotic age
[7:23] i wanted to define this in such a way to
[7:25] kind of zero in on what this word means
[7:28] i would as i gave the same caveat as i
[7:30] gave a caveat when we first introduced
[7:32] the concept of uh character disorders
[7:35] and the anti-spiritual personality
[7:37] disorder i didn't have slides because i
[7:39] wanted you to focus very intently on
[7:41] what i was saying
[7:42] and not so much getting lost in the
[7:44] terminology because we're just bringing
[7:45] this back to the word i think maybe we
[7:48] started off on this so you know what
[7:49] we're you probably already can begin to
[7:50] anticipate that this can be closely
[7:52] connected to a spiritual fame a word
[7:54] theme things in the bible that we can
[7:57] learn from but in a very general sense
[8:00] someone who's neurotic is someone who
[8:01] behaves strangely
[8:03] and so it's they exhibit strange
[8:05] behavior in some ways they exhibit some
[8:07] unreasonable anxiety so there has to be
[8:10] some baseline in order to say someone's
[8:12] neurotic you have some uh reasonable
[8:14] behavior you have some a reasonable
[8:16] threshold of worry or fear anxiety and
[8:19] someone who is a neurotic you'd say
[8:20] they're not this is unusual out of the
[8:23] norm behaviors for somebody in this
[8:24] situation and so there's some
[8:27] uh
[8:28] just i say that because you'll find many
[8:30] times brother branham's referring to
[8:32] neurotic behavior and its deviation from
[8:34] what would be correct spiritually
[8:37] so deviation from what would be correct
[8:39] morally it's deviation from what human
[8:41] humanity used to deem uh uh proper
[8:44] indecent and then someone begins to
[8:46] deviate from they says that's neurotic
[8:47] behavior they're insane to dress that
[8:49] way they're insane to act that way so in
[8:51] that way neurotic could be used kind of
[8:53] in a sense to explain that someone's
[8:55] conduct does not conform with what is
[8:57] usual or normal in that particular
[8:58] situation
[9:00] but the neuroticism
[9:02] which is kind of maybe more what uh
[9:04] we're looking at is you could even see
[9:06] brother branham identifying it the bible
[9:07] identifying it it's defined by a
[9:09] tendency to towards anxiety
[9:13] negativity and self-doubt
[9:15] this would maybe be more of a textbook
[9:17] definition so neuroticism is kind of the
[9:20] worst case scenario thinking you're
[9:21] always just imagining the worst
[9:24] and because of that it leads to high
[9:25] levels of guilt it leads to high levels
[9:27] of worry and fear and depression and so
[9:30] these things kind of feed into some of
[9:31] the uh the 157 things we were talking
[9:34] about before the dsm-5
[9:37] on the um the disorders of the of a
[9:39] person personality disorders
[9:41] and i will say this that it is
[9:45] a neuroticism from a um
[9:48] maybe i would maybe don't want to use
[9:50] the word clinical but an academic
[9:52] or uh treatment standpoint it exists on
[9:54] a spectrum
[9:56] and they say that all of us are at least
[9:58] a little bit neurotic
[10:00] and could we get an amanda that all of
[10:01] us at least to some level are are
[10:04] neurotic now this is different from
[10:06] neurosis which would be something
[10:07] entirely different and would be more
[10:10] clinical but we're looking at
[10:11] neuroticism or to be neurotic and this
[10:13] is a statement that i found that i
[10:15] thought really summed this up real well
[10:16] it's a fundamental domain neuroticism a
[10:19] fundamental domain of personality that
[10:21] has enormous public health and
[10:23] public health implications
[10:25] impacting a wide array of
[10:27] psychopathological and physical health
[10:29] care concerns
[10:31] it contributes to the occurrence of many
[10:33] significantly harmful life outcomes as
[10:35] well as impairing the ability of persons
[10:37] to adequately address them
[10:40] they recognize that neuroticism is
[10:42] implicated in a lot of
[10:43] bad life outcomes neuroticism
[10:45] implicating a lot of pathological
[10:47] problems and physical health care
[10:49] problems and not only does it cause that
[10:51] or may be correlated but it also impairs
[10:53] a person's ability to then address
[10:56] whether the physical or mental need that
[10:58] is caused by it so it can create a very
[11:00] damaging cycle
[11:02] and so with that in mind let me read
[11:03] this statement says everybody has become
[11:05] a neurotic
[11:06] the whole world is a neurotical age and
[11:09] we know there's something wrong
[11:11] now what i want to pose and the question
[11:13] i want to ask tonight is how did we get
[11:15] there
[11:16] how do we get to a place where brother
[11:18] bannon could make such stark statements
[11:19] and that
[11:20] in one sense in second timothy chapter 3
[11:22] paul would prophesy it
[11:25] and then we come to revelations chapter
[11:27] 3 verse 17 and and again in symbolic
[11:29] form it comes to pass
[11:31] that mankind has they become neurotics
[11:34] it's prophesied in the last days they'll
[11:35] be perilous then in revelations 3 17 17
[11:38] though it's prophecy i want to say that
[11:40] it shows the fulfillment or the fruit of
[11:42] that seed prophecy that everything has
[11:45] become a neurotic age
[11:48] and
[11:48] i want us to think about how we got
[11:50] there but then also i want to ask
[11:52] if the word prophesied it do you think
[11:54] you could solve it
[11:56] if the word knew it was going to be here
[11:58] do you think the word would make
[12:00] provision for it
[12:02] do you not think that if the word said
[12:03] hey in the last days it's going to be a
[12:04] neurotic age you do not think that the
[12:06] word would then provide some treatment
[12:09] or care for the neuroticism that exists
[12:11] in the world today
[12:13] and i can demonstrate this to you from
[12:15] an academic scientific standpoint and
[12:18] show you that the the doctors and
[12:20] scientists have a language to use to
[12:23] describe the maladies of the mind and
[12:25] the problems with people today and then
[12:28] you could and then you can go right to
[12:29] the bible and see that the bible knows
[12:31] already
[12:33] and was written to address it
[12:36] god knew we knew he'd be insane in the
[12:38] last days you know what he began to do
[12:39] all the way back in the old testament in
[12:41] the beginning god created the heaven and
[12:42] the earth so he would provide us with
[12:44] our own bible
[12:46] our own psychiatric bible or our own
[12:48] dsm-5 he provided us with something that
[12:51] we could consult and go to to address
[12:54] this problem
[12:55] so i've already answered it if the word
[12:57] prophesied it yes it can solve it
[13:00] now this is this next statement here is
[13:02] just going to open up the door in terms
[13:04] of what what i'm uh what inspired me
[13:06] it's from the message great coming
[13:08] revival he says the whole air has become
[13:10] contaminated with the powers of the
[13:12] underworld and the powers of darkness
[13:15] now this will get the republicans
[13:16] feeling really good about themselves
[13:18] we'll look out over the world now and
[13:19] find around how communism is weaving its
[13:21] way in isn't that right it's the
[13:23] communist
[13:25] and says why we could get out on the
[13:27] street and we here in america we take
[13:29] for instance like i was passing a place
[13:30] a while ago in your city the lovely city
[13:32] not only that but my city and everywhere
[13:34] you find these mothers out working these
[13:36] war plants and things that come in their
[13:38] children with babysitters
[13:40] now again a lot of times what we do is
[13:42] we would attribute this to well that's
[13:43] just chauvinism or that's uh misogyny
[13:46] right that's what we would attribute it
[13:47] to her that was just the prevailing
[13:49] dominant mindset of men in that day but
[13:51] brother graham's not just saying this
[13:53] because he doesn't think women should
[13:55] work it's because there's a there's
[13:56] something that's being forsaken
[13:58] and this is important to catch because
[14:00] you could just read this like that's
[14:01] right all these women out there working
[14:03] in the plants but it's not that wasn't
[14:05] the problem it's the other part that's
[14:06] really the problem and here he gets to
[14:08] it
[14:09] he says
[14:10] oh it's a disgrace our american women
[14:12] ever put on a pair of overalls and went
[14:14] into a war plant to work i don't care
[14:16] how much that hurts but it's a disgrace
[14:18] and this is the key it's a breaking the
[14:20] backbone of this nation
[14:23] that little baby of yours needs you
[14:26] so it wasn't it wasn't that it was just
[14:28] because there was a woman out there
[14:29] working in a plant it's because
[14:31] something is abandoned something
[14:33] forsaken some standard let go
[14:35] and so you could take and i hope i'm not
[14:38] venturing out you'll find that when
[14:39] brother banham dealt with a woman
[14:41] working he was very sensitive to
[14:42] situations that would put a sister in a
[14:45] position where she needed to work so
[14:48] it's not just the job itself that makes
[14:49] a woman wrong or evil or out of her
[14:51] place but it's what's being abandoned or
[14:53] forsaken or let go of and not honored
[14:55] when it
[14:56] happens and listen i think there's a lot
[14:59] of misogynist who grabbed these quotes
[15:00] in the message and used them to beat up
[15:02] women and it produced the wrong result
[15:04] because we missed what was being taught
[15:06] by the prophet
[15:08] not just looking at in the age that he
[15:10] was in the language he's using at the
[15:12] time but taking a step back and saying
[15:13] well why was it such a disgrace because
[15:15] there was a baby at home that needed the
[15:17] mother
[15:19] and he says god gave you that baby to
[15:21] raise yourself
[15:23] for you to raise the baby not the baby
[15:25] to raise you he god gave you that baby
[15:26] to for you to raise not some babysitter
[15:30] that's right now i know this is hard
[15:31] even in the times we're living in an
[15:33] hour this can be very very hard but
[15:35] watch what he says here not long ago
[15:37] they had some of these doctors that said
[15:39] let the baby lay and cry you nurse it at
[15:41] a certain time you don't pick it up if
[15:44] it cries let it cry it out
[15:47] and i think there's two different
[15:48] schools of thoughts i forgot because
[15:49] it's been a long time since we've
[15:51] had a a baby in the family uh that would
[15:54] have to be by this schedule but it's
[15:55] either on demand or on certain times and
[15:58] so maybe there's still a debate that
[15:59] rages between among mothers nowadays
[16:01] like well i do it every morning at such
[16:03] and such time and i don't wait till such
[16:04] and such time and and uh even though it
[16:07] seems certainly relevant to that i'm not
[16:08] saying that brother brown is waiting in
[16:10] on that debate necessarily but he's just
[16:12] saying there used to be this theology or
[16:13] this idea of let the baby cry
[16:16] cry whine cry if it's not that certain
[16:17] time that you nurse it just let it lay
[16:19] there and cry you don't pick it up if it
[16:21] cries let it cry it out he says they did
[16:23] that 25 years ago
[16:25] he said that was a great belief amongst
[16:27] the doctors i want to come right back to
[16:28] that phrase in a moment that was a great
[16:30] belief amongst the doctors come to find
[16:32] out it hatched out a bunch of neurotics
[16:36] he's making this direct connection that
[16:38] there was this approach to motherhood
[16:39] this was approach to parenthood there
[16:41] was this approach to infants that was
[16:43] basically saying let them cry leave them
[16:45] alone
[16:46] and stick very rigidly to the schedule
[16:48] of feeding them and brother man says you
[16:50] know what it did it produced neurotics
[16:52] this is his his diagnosis and he says
[16:56] let nature have its way
[16:58] god knows what's best that baby needs
[17:01] love this is where i get the phrase
[17:03] parental love and neuroticism because
[17:05] brother graham's just connected to two
[17:08] the the the the holding withholding
[17:10] and the one part from that teaching
[17:13] hatched out a bunch of neurotics but he
[17:15] says the baby needs love
[17:17] if you take
[17:18] love away from it you'll make a brute
[17:20] out of it
[17:21] that baby's got to have love
[17:24] you've got to take care of it and today
[17:25] the mothers become bar flies out around
[17:27] the ballroom and things like that and
[17:29] the whole morals of the nation is
[17:30] breaking and everything we're at the end
[17:32] of the road
[17:34] in
[17:36] in again i'm not wanting to limit just
[17:37] how far-reaching those statements are
[17:40] and just what brother branham was
[17:41] intending by referring to certain things
[17:43] in the workplace or here even with bar
[17:45] flies and and bar rooms
[17:48] but notice how the fallout and the
[17:51] consequence how much greater it is
[17:54] when you have a mother who's out doing
[17:55] those things and is leaving a baby at
[17:57] home
[17:58] he's saying there's a direct consequence
[18:00] if you take love away from it you make a
[18:02] brute the baby's got to have love so if
[18:05] they if they abide by what the doctors
[18:07] were saying take a step back leave them
[18:09] alone feed them at certain times it
[18:11] produced neurotics and he says but
[18:13] nature the very nature that god gave the
[18:15] mother he knows what's best and the baby
[18:18] needs love
[18:19] so you see the connection that we're
[18:21] making there
[18:22] so this statement that brother browner
[18:23] makes is a great belief among doctors
[18:27] so i i've gone back and i've actually
[18:29] come across these things through the
[18:30] years in my in my reading and studying
[18:32] and i know many of you may uh be
[18:34] familiar with some of these things that
[18:35] we're going to touch on but i want to i
[18:37] want to identify what this great belief
[18:39] amongst the doctors was and it's uh it's
[18:42] well documented it was a frequent um
[18:45] assertion and then even later on begin
[18:47] to be greatly debated so it's very easy
[18:49] to find a lot of materials within
[18:51] the academic circles on these things and
[18:53] in the early 1900s many psychologists
[18:55] believed that showing children affection
[18:58] served no real purpose
[19:00] i thought well you show them affection
[19:01] it's just a sentimental gesture and has
[19:03] no developmental impact and this is what
[19:05] they believe they believe that to rub a
[19:07] kid on the head or to hug him or to kiss
[19:09] him on the cheek this is just sentiment
[19:11] this is just a sentimental gesture and
[19:13] it does not impact the child in any
[19:15] measurable way
[19:17] and this is what they believed and they
[19:19] actually went so far as to think that
[19:21] this kind of behavior affection would
[19:22] spread diseases and and that they
[19:24] believed it would actually lead to adult
[19:26] physiological uh psychological problems
[19:29] later on in life that if you love on
[19:30] them and care for them not only could
[19:32] you inflict them with some disease but
[19:33] also later on they'd have a
[19:34] psychological problem as a result of it
[19:37] and then this statement
[19:39] is very
[19:40] shocking i wanted to put it in that
[19:42] neurotic age font but this is john b
[19:44] watson he's the founder one of the
[19:45] founders of behavioral psychology
[19:48] and i'm not wanting to use this as an
[19:49] indictment of that discipline but he
[19:51] said when you're tempted to pet your
[19:52] child remember that mother love is a
[19:54] dangerous instrument
[19:57] okay dr watson
[20:00] when you are tempted to pet your child
[20:02] remember that mother love is a dangerous
[20:04] instrument that's quite a statement but
[20:06] this is the prevailing idea of this is
[20:09] the great belief amongst doctors when
[20:11] brother bam says 25 years ago he says in
[20:13] 1954 he is bulls eyeing this attitude
[20:16] and this idea that this is the way we
[20:18] think this is the way we believe that
[20:20] when you're tempted to show affection to
[20:22] your child when you're tempted to let
[20:24] that motherly love be expressed to that
[20:25] little and remember it's dangerous
[20:28] it could cause diseases it could cause
[20:29] psychological problems later on so it
[20:32] builds up this great belief amongst
[20:34] doctors that you let the baby cry you
[20:36] only nurse it at certain times don't
[20:38] pick it up if it cries let it cry it out
[20:41] he says it hatched a bunch of neurotics
[20:44] in the 1950s and 60s a behaviorist and
[20:47] the psychoanalyst believed that babies
[20:49] became attached to their mothers merely
[20:51] because they provided them food
[20:54] they thought this is the only reason why
[20:55] a child an infant becomes attached to a
[20:56] mom this is the only reason why there is
[20:58] seems to be this attachment they called
[21:00] it attachment theories how they explored
[21:02] it it's solely based upon the fact that
[21:05] the mother feeds them and that's why
[21:07] that's what they look at they say the
[21:09] mother is only to provide food in
[21:11] providing food that's why they get
[21:13] attached and so it's not necessary that
[21:15] there be any other
[21:16] signs of love or expressions of love to
[21:18] the child because that'll only be
[21:20] problematic because after all a mother's
[21:22] love is a dangerous instrument
[21:26] so it makes this statement even more
[21:27] striking this is the early 1900s then
[21:29] even the 50s and 60s this is the
[21:31] prevailing attitude and notice what
[21:33] brother brown says in 1958 i'm reading
[21:35] these next two statements to zero in on
[21:37] this time period mom is having a little
[21:39] innocent fun he's talking about women
[21:40] out partying and everything maybe their
[21:42] husbands were home babysitting or some
[21:44] hired child is taking care of their
[21:46] children he says god gave you them
[21:48] children to take care of them yourself
[21:51] and it's your responsible to god
[21:53] we don't have juvenile delinquency it's
[21:55] parental delinquency
[21:57] where is the delinquency not being at
[21:59] home taking care of the children he says
[22:01] some mothers have got away from their
[22:03] duty they want to run to
[22:04] bar rooms and carry on and run all night
[22:06] long and leave their children grow up
[22:09] so where where could we say is the
[22:11] transgression
[22:13] the the removal of the mother from her
[22:15] duty in the home to grow and raise her
[22:17] child up
[22:19] that's the duty that's being forsaken he
[22:20] says no wonder they grow up in that
[22:22] neurotic age
[22:24] god gave you that child to raise and to
[22:26] take care of
[22:27] we read it from 1954 this is 1958 he's
[22:30] looking at neurotic behaviors in
[22:32] children and teenagers and people today
[22:35] and he's saying that the reason why we
[22:36] see this rise of neuroticism in people
[22:39] is because they've this detachment of
[22:41] parents to their children
[22:43] and because they're not showing them
[22:45] this they're not showing them the proper
[22:47] care that is that is their
[22:49] responsibility before god so there's
[22:51] some scriptural standard he says they
[22:53] just leave their children to grow up
[22:54] they're detached they're not involved so
[22:56] no wonder they grew up to be neurotics
[22:58] because god gave you that child to raise
[23:00] and to take care of
[23:03] and i would i would kind of posit here
[23:05] that
[23:06] it is a scriptural duty therefore
[23:08] there's a scripture way to fulfill it
[23:10] and and so there's there's maybe
[23:12] perversions
[23:14] of
[23:15] the parenthood that uh subscribe to
[23:18] maybe a counter uh belief system than
[23:21] than the ones espoused by these doctors
[23:23] that want you to be very very involved
[23:25] and overbearing and i would say that if
[23:27] it's not the word of god you're going to
[23:29] find yourself going from one ditch into
[23:30] another
[23:32] then in the message thirsting for life
[23:34] he says that's what breaks up homes
[23:37] i'm sorry if i went too far there
[23:42] we're competing how did that happen now
[23:43] you guys know where i'm going i hate
[23:45] that
[23:46] sorry my fault
[23:47] and thirsting for life he says that's
[23:49] what breaks up homes that's what spoils
[23:51] children he's talking about parents
[23:52] being out of the home out partying all
[23:54] night he says that's what breaks up
[23:56] homes parents not being in their place
[23:58] we can always blame the kids
[24:00] right
[24:02] but the parents i thought for sure that
[24:03] the front row would just be getting
[24:05] ready to carry me around on their
[24:06] shoulders if they could
[24:08] it's the parents out of place it's
[24:10] parental delinquency and he says that
[24:11] that's what makes neurotics
[24:14] it's not even the drug use of the kids
[24:15] it's not the video games of the kids
[24:17] it's not it's not the atmosphere in the
[24:19] environment necessarily at school he
[24:20] said it's something in the home he's he
[24:23] makes the statement that the backbone of
[24:25] this nation is broken and that's what
[24:27] causes the neuroticism in the children
[24:30] not because the schools are broken
[24:31] because the malls are broken because the
[24:33] internet is broken because the all these
[24:35] things but it's because something that
[24:37] god designed to protect and guide the
[24:39] children has been broken or lost its
[24:41] compass and therefore that's how the
[24:43] children become neurotics he says that's
[24:45] what makes teenage delinquency is when
[24:47] motherhood and fatherhood is broke
[24:50] i often emphasize this when i read these
[24:52] statements is just when you read how
[24:54] dark the age is and how awful things are
[24:56] and how things have gotten to where
[24:57] there's so much delinquency just take
[24:59] the opposite if it's broken parenthood
[25:01] that caused it then strong parenthood
[25:03] can resolve it
[25:05] if broken parenthood is what caused the
[25:07] problem then god can bring a strong home
[25:09] and a strong atmosphere in the home and
[25:11] it be the inoculation and the defense
[25:13] against it so in the diagnosis of the
[25:15] problem is the solution kind of invert
[25:18] always invert if a broken home caused
[25:20] the problem then a unified home can fix
[25:23] it
[25:25] he says that's what makes neurotics now
[25:28] in august 31st 1958 so i read from 54 58
[25:34] 1960 on august 31st 1958 harley
[25:38] harry harlow presented an address at the
[25:40] 66th
[25:41] american psychiatric association their
[25:44] annual convention was the 66th
[25:47] three times seven
[25:50] it's a 66 apa convention and he gave his
[25:53] address and it was titled the nature of
[25:54] love
[25:56] and
[25:57] harlow presented the results at this
[26:00] talk called the nature of love he
[26:01] presented the results of a set of exp
[26:03] experiments he had done
[26:05] kind of the culmination of a lot of
[26:06] observations and just over decades these
[26:08] things kind of added up
[26:10] and so
[26:11] harlow began his career
[26:14] using non-human primate research i think
[26:16] he started at the university of
[26:17] wisconsin begin this
[26:19] primate research laboratory
[26:21] and because he needed regular access to
[26:23] monkeys it kind of sounds funny but
[26:26] because he needed regular access to
[26:27] monkeys he kept infants in a nursery and
[26:30] so he would separate these baby monkeys
[26:33] away from their parents and away from
[26:35] their mothers they would be born and
[26:36] very early on he would separate them
[26:38] from their mothers put them in a nursery
[26:39] because he needed quick access to them
[26:42] to operate the experiments and you'll
[26:43] find that if there's criticisms
[26:45] of
[26:46] harry harlow it is his treatment of
[26:48] animals it really was extreme the things
[26:50] he began to do to try to explore human
[26:53] behavior
[26:54] and so as he took these baby monkeys
[26:56] away from their mothers and he had him
[26:58] in a nursery he still had some monkeys
[27:00] that were still with their mothers and
[27:02] he observed that what he would call
[27:03] maybe the nursery monkeys the ones
[27:05] separated from their mothers behaved
[27:06] very differently than their peers that
[27:09] lived with their moms
[27:11] and he noticed that the ones in the
[27:12] nursery more reclusive they had clear
[27:14] social deficiencies he found that even
[27:16] they clung to um their cloth diapers and
[27:19] and they they just acted very
[27:21] differently socially and in their
[27:22] behaviors and mannerisms than
[27:24] the the behavior of those who were
[27:26] connected to their mom
[27:28] and then it was in the 1950s and
[27:30] certainly this is not things on the
[27:31] front page of the jeffersonville times
[27:33] these are not things you'd be really
[27:34] here being discussed it was more within
[27:36] academia in the 1950s certain
[27:39] researchers began to kind of take on and
[27:41] address this notion
[27:42] uh that physical contact from parents
[27:44] was bad they they looked at uh this
[27:48] prevailing id in the early 1900s this
[27:50] idea that we said brother branham talked
[27:52] about uh the belief system amongst the
[27:54] doctors and he he took it
[27:56] and and these certain scientists and
[27:58] these uh
[27:59] doctors began to say you know what we
[28:01] think there's a flaw in this rationale
[28:03] there's something missing in this
[28:04] approach and they begin to examine
[28:07] whether or not there was this was true
[28:10] this prevailing idea amongst doctors was
[28:11] true
[28:12] and these other researchers begin to
[28:14] argue that mothers provided more than
[28:16] just food
[28:18] that there there's this unique bond that
[28:20] was formed between a parent and a child
[28:22] that positively influenced the child's
[28:24] development and positively influenced
[28:26] the child's mental health
[28:28] so remember brother brown said this
[28:29] great belief amongst doctors was leave
[28:31] them alone
[28:32] only feed them at certain times and so
[28:34] leave brother graham's identifying this
[28:36] psychoanalyst thought that the mother's
[28:38] love is a dangerous instrument be sure
[28:39] you don't exercise it don't pet the
[28:41] child stay away keep arms length there's
[28:43] a lot i can use and statements and
[28:44] quotes and examples of how this
[28:46] prevailed in even what was publicly
[28:48] taught to parents at the time fathers
[28:51] were expected to be more detached
[28:52] mothers were cautioned to be
[28:53] affectionate but then there's this
[28:55] change in the 1950s where some
[28:57] researchers are looking at it and and
[28:59] just because it's a researcher just
[29:00] because it's science doesn't mean
[29:01] they're going to come up end up
[29:03] discovering something false
[29:05] really only the only thing that science
[29:07] can achieve in their discoveries is
[29:09] something that god has already
[29:11] set in motion or something god has
[29:13] already created it's their conclusions
[29:15] that are off base
[29:16] but generally something that's not a
[29:17] hypothesis but that they prove you say
[29:19] god's the one that set that in motion to
[29:21] begin with
[29:22] but remember there's a lot of theories
[29:23] out there
[29:25] and so
[29:26] harlow came up with an experiment then
[29:28] as this counter idea began to develop
[29:30] that no mothers me are more than food
[29:32] but there's a bond there that's very
[29:33] critical to development he came up with
[29:35] an experiment to study the bond
[29:38] and he published a book later on called
[29:41] learning to love which kind of
[29:43] encapsulated all these um
[29:46] experiments and again remember
[29:48] it first began with him observing how
[29:50] monkeys separated from their mothers
[29:51] behave very differently than the ones
[29:53] that remained with their mothers so he
[29:55] came up with an experiment
[29:57] and he created two different
[29:59] surrogate mothers their fake mothers are
[30:01] called they're they were made up of
[30:04] inanimate they were not real moms they
[30:06] were made out of wire and there was one
[30:08] that was they called a cloth mother it
[30:10] was made with a nice cherry cloth and it
[30:12] was very soft and it's the one that's on
[30:14] your right
[30:16] excuse me you're left
[30:20] i turned that one around in my head but
[30:22] it's the one on your left
[30:24] and this one was soft and it may be a
[30:26] more
[30:27] uh normalized face
[30:29] and maybe we could call this the soft
[30:31] mom
[30:32] and they made another one that was made
[30:33] out of wire just bare wire that's all
[30:35] that it was and if you notice in the
[30:37] image
[30:38] on the one on your right
[30:40] that one would provide food
[30:43] so they would put a bottle there on the
[30:44] one on the right it's just a wire mother
[30:46] but this other one would never provide
[30:48] food but it was soft
[30:50] and it was more comfortable
[30:52] and so
[30:53] the infants as they observed this to
[30:55] some tremendous degree the infants went
[30:57] to the wire mom only for food
[31:00] they only went to the one on the right
[31:02] when they were hungry but they preferred
[31:04] the soft mom when they weren't eating
[31:06] to the point to where they they were
[31:08] always hugged up next to it and they
[31:10] were always very close to it and and
[31:13] and and held to it just like they would
[31:14] a mom
[31:16] and they learned they leaned on this
[31:19] soft mom for comfort
[31:21] it's inanimate it never spoke to it it
[31:23] never fed it it never picked at it it
[31:25] never did anything to declare to it that
[31:27] it was alive but yet it it represented
[31:29] something more soft and more
[31:30] affectionate more inviting and they
[31:32] leaned on it for security
[31:34] and i could i could spend a lot of time
[31:37] just getting to the studies because it
[31:38] was it was amazing just how many many
[31:40] different ways they studied this but
[31:42] they even presented it in a strange
[31:44] situation scenario where they would test
[31:46] the the monkey in a scenario that was
[31:48] strange and unfamiliar to them and if
[31:50] they put him in a strange environment
[31:53] with without a mother or with the wire
[31:54] mother they were scared and they were un
[31:57] unwilling to explore but just the
[31:59] presence of this soft mom in the room
[32:02] made them feel more comfortable to
[32:04] explore and understand their
[32:05] surroundings
[32:07] that they would present them with what
[32:08] was called a fear test and they had a
[32:10] stuffed animal i think it was a dog that
[32:12] would bark or make loud noises and
[32:14] without the mom there just the wire mom
[32:17] they cowered they were scared they cried
[32:18] out in fear but then the presence of the
[32:20] soft mom just her being there made them
[32:22] more bold they weren't scared sometimes
[32:24] they would pick at it or they would be
[32:26] they wouldn't be afraid to address the
[32:28] stuffed animal and they observed this
[32:30] behavior amongst monkeys
[32:33] and what they began to deduce is that in
[32:36] this experiment is that there was a
[32:37] primary need for closeness within these
[32:40] infants
[32:41] and this affectionate bond was very
[32:43] critical to development because they
[32:45] began to recognize that there was
[32:47] developmental disorders in the monkeys
[32:49] that did not have a mom and the monkeys
[32:51] that only had the wire mother because
[32:52] they they had a control group and had
[32:54] ways that they were able to analyze this
[32:56] and they could see even in their
[32:57] physical
[32:58] maladies that they had digestive issues
[33:00] even though they may weigh the same they
[33:02] had very terrible digestive issues
[33:04] and there was personality things that
[33:07] they observed in ways that they could
[33:08] see that there's a definite definitive
[33:10] impact of having the presence of a mom
[33:13] even when you could say that this image
[33:15] here that it preferred this the warmth
[33:17] the softness over the one that gave it
[33:20] food
[33:21] and these findings of harlow and some of
[33:24] these other researchers at the time
[33:25] contradicted the traditional ideas
[33:27] of how spoiling a chair you avoid
[33:30] spoiling the child that was what avoid
[33:32] spoiling the child
[33:34] emotions don't matter
[33:37] these things are are dangerous you
[33:39] should avoid them don't spoil them don't
[33:41] be affectionate don't worry about
[33:42] nurturing some sort of emotional health
[33:45] because emotions don't matter these
[33:47] things are kind of hard hardwired all
[33:49] you need to do is give them food and the
[33:50] rest of itself rest is going to take
[33:52] care of itself
[33:53] now this is what science is arriving at
[33:57] but it's rep it's only showing us it's
[33:59] only discovering what brother brahma had
[34:00] already said in this particular instance
[34:02] almost 10 years earlier
[34:04] if it's 1958 when harry harlow gets up
[34:06] there and presents the presents this in
[34:08] the nature of love you can go back to
[34:09] 1954 where brother branham himself is
[34:11] calling out these doctors and saying
[34:14] you've got it wrong the baby needs love
[34:16] he says let nature have its way that
[34:18] baby needs love and then harlow harry
[34:20] harlow gets up there and says the nature
[34:22] of love the babies need love he's maybe
[34:25] a little bit late to the party but he's
[34:26] getting it right
[34:30] and i bring these in just so you can see
[34:33] how this message
[34:35] is uh you can say well brother ben why
[34:37] don't you just read to us the quotes
[34:38] well um
[34:40] i i feel led to do it this way
[34:43] and i think it's i think it's striking
[34:45] for us and i want us to have confidence
[34:46] in this word
[34:48] that yeah we could maybe you could buy
[34:50] the book the nature of love maybe you
[34:51] could buy or the the learning to love
[34:53] and you could buy the book nature of
[34:54] love but i want to come to something
[34:55] here in a minute and say even those
[34:57] things miss it
[34:59] because
[35:00] all hairy harlow is saying is they need
[35:02] love but does he know what love is
[35:06] this is something within nature within
[35:08] these monkeys but when it comes to a
[35:10] more complex individual in the family
[35:12] unit and fathers and mothers and
[35:14] children and the demands upon their time
[35:16] and think about the neurotic age that
[35:18] we're living in and the these the
[35:20] diagnosis that we have from revelations
[35:22] 3 17 there should be some heightened
[35:24] awareness that if science can deduce
[35:25] this
[35:26] in the laboratories with monkeys how
[35:28] much lar much larger of an issue is it
[35:31] with us as humans
[35:33] and this message god have provided a way
[35:36] there's your answer right there god hath
[35:39] provided a way
[35:40] he says i was talking to a young lady
[35:41] just a few moments ago that was
[35:42] suffering from a nervous condition
[35:45] she said how she had tried to overcome
[35:47] it now i'm not much of a christian
[35:48] science or unitarian i don't believe
[35:50] there's anything like mind over matter i
[35:52] believe god is a healer
[35:54] he says the lady was born in that
[35:56] nervous condition her mother and father
[35:58] died now she was born in that nervous
[36:00] condition now he's going to explain this
[36:03] her mother and father died when she was
[36:06] a child a baby and was raised up
[36:08] just tossed about everywhere and never
[36:11] had the proper love and care that a baby
[36:13] has
[36:14] you're recognizing this
[36:16] i i left it out of my my notes tonight
[36:20] um i i would say intentionally but maybe
[36:22] even inadvertently there's a number of
[36:24] studies of orphanages one very very
[36:26] striking studies in orphanages in
[36:28] romania and then other studies of
[36:30] russian orphanages that found that this
[36:33] kind of sterile approach to children in
[36:35] orphanages was you just feed them
[36:38] and you don't provide any love or care
[36:40] there's no touch there's no affection
[36:41] that's shown to them and in some cases
[36:43] the death rate in orphanages was 100
[36:48] and they found that where the death rate
[36:49] was high where the death rates were high
[36:51] is orphanages that just operated by the
[36:53] sterile they just need to be changed
[36:54] they just need to be fed and the
[36:56] developmental disorders the mental
[36:57] disorders and even the death rates and
[36:59] those were exponentially higher but when
[37:01] they begin to train the nurses to hold
[37:04] to caress to care for to spend time with
[37:06] the death rates plummeted
[37:09] why because the lack of affection and
[37:10] warmth
[37:11] caused caused them to die
[37:14] the children the infants would actually
[37:15] die because of the lack of love
[37:18] why because god made us
[37:20] to experience that love to experience
[37:22] that so he says that she was raised up
[37:24] tossed about everywhere and never had
[37:25] the proper love and care that a baby has
[37:27] you know mother i want to tell you
[37:28] something
[37:29] now this is going to strike us here i
[37:31] know i got a little boy back there and
[37:32] he's really rankly spoiled
[37:35] is every word thus saith the lord
[37:38] and he's really rankly spoiled but i
[37:40] would rather have him that way
[37:43] keep following along
[37:44] i believe it'll make a better man out of
[37:46] him if god lets him live then so there's
[37:49] a it's not just i want him spoiled but
[37:52] there's an opposite he's contrasting to
[37:54] then to let him scream and cry and upset
[37:56] his little self
[37:58] so he's not saying that we all need to
[37:59] go out and just wrinkly spoil our
[38:01] children for some of you it's too late
[38:03] for others maybe we have enough time
[38:04] right but obed we have enough time to
[38:06] spoil you we can just give you all the
[38:07] things you want but he's not saying that
[38:09] he prefers spoiling the child to raising
[38:12] them the right way but he's saying i'd
[38:13] rather him be spoiled than to be
[38:16] detached emotionless leaving him alone
[38:19] letting him scream letting him try to
[38:21] figure his way out and having him suffer
[38:24] from that emotional detachment
[38:27] he said god if god lets him live then
[38:29] i'd rather him be spoiled than this
[38:32] other side this great belief amongst
[38:34] doctors
[38:35] and so he brings it right to this point
[38:36] this is where i think he's zeroing in on
[38:39] this maybe some people will just end on
[38:41] he's rankly spoiled
[38:43] and not care to read the rest but he's
[38:44] making a very beautiful point here and
[38:46] here some a few years ago some normal
[38:48] modern witch doctors
[38:51] said let that baby cry don't pick it up
[38:53] all things like that don't let grandma
[38:55] touch it
[38:57] he says you know what i hatched out what
[38:58] they hatched out you see what it is a
[39:00] juvenile delinquency a bunch of
[39:02] neurotics
[39:04] what did it produce delinquency
[39:07] but who is delinquent the parents
[39:10] and he's saying that when we thought
[39:12] this idea don't let them cry don't pick
[39:13] it up just ignore their pleas ignore
[39:15] their needs and things like that don't
[39:17] let grandma touch it he says there are a
[39:19] bunch of neurotics he says god made a
[39:20] baby to be loved that's why he made a
[39:23] mother to love a baby
[39:26] that's why we're supposed to be this way
[39:27] god made it that way
[39:29] listen and any time that you upset god's
[39:32] program you must remember you are wrong
[39:35] and will be wrong as long as you are
[39:37] upsetting god's program follow god's
[39:39] program do it the way god said do it
[39:42] god hath provided a way god hath
[39:45] provided a way to love our children god
[39:47] hath provided a way to raise our
[39:49] children god has actually provided a way
[39:51] for us as believers to navigate an
[39:53] insane age and to treat our children in
[39:56] such a way with respect and decency and
[39:59] to raise them in such a way to we
[40:00] protect their minds from being neurotic
[40:06] made a baby to be loved
[40:08] we could take oh love is tough and this
[40:10] tough love idea and these certain ideas
[40:12] of love and we can miss it by a million
[40:14] miles
[40:16] he says the juvenile
[40:18] the juvenile delinquency is because god
[40:20] made children
[40:21] to have the parental love and parental
[40:23] care
[40:24] and so he gave parent he made parenthood
[40:27] for that purpose
[40:30] isn't it striking
[40:32] do you not can we see it then
[40:34] in in what brother branham said and the
[40:37] parallel at the exact same times what
[40:39] science said on one hand but then what
[40:41] they ultimately begin to discover on the
[40:43] other
[40:44] they begin to discover that brother
[40:46] branham uh not that they discovered the
[40:48] eureka moment was you know hairy
[40:49] harlequin that preacher in kentucky was
[40:51] right
[40:53] but it's being preached it's been
[40:54] expressed it's in the word of god and
[40:56] then scientists and the integrity that
[40:58] they approach these things at times
[41:00] they're discovering these things and
[41:01] they're being honest with themselves and
[41:03] even the peer review process and the way
[41:05] things get published is very very uh
[41:07] very remarkable in these studies because
[41:10] there's often times
[41:11] in when there's this honesty that they
[41:13] want to arrive at the right conclusion
[41:15] they let things be tested let others try
[41:17] it out and they see these things to be
[41:18] correlated because they're wanting to
[41:20] arrive at things at solid conclusions so
[41:23] they have this idea these behavioral
[41:25] psychologists have this idea and then
[41:27] these other doctors begin to look at and
[41:28] explore they say wait a minute we're
[41:30] finding evidence to the contrary and
[41:32] that's in their realm but let's take a
[41:34] step back and recognize that the word of
[41:36] god recognizes the air and shows that
[41:38] god is provided away
[41:41] and i don't know that science would say
[41:43] well yeah we're in a neurotic age and
[41:44] everyone's going crazy and this is
[41:46] insane and evil persist and this is
[41:48] satan's eden and this is why these
[41:49] things are happening no they might think
[41:51] we're more advanced than we've ever been
[41:52] we've got access to more medicine than
[41:54] we've ever had we got access to more
[41:55] treatments and more programs so we've
[41:57] got to figure out a way to do this but
[41:58] let's come back to it's the word of god
[42:00] that sets the standard it's the word of
[42:01] god that addresses these issues
[42:04] so we read in the very beginning
[42:05] ephesians chapter six verse four
[42:08] this is this is the way that god
[42:09] provided just look at how the bible
[42:11] speaks to this and it says ye fathers
[42:13] provoke not your children to wrath
[42:14] that's a phrase very very heavy phrase
[42:17] it's just a full phrase in my mouth
[42:18] provoke not your children to wrath
[42:21] but bring them up
[42:23] graze them up mature them grow them
[42:25] bring them up remember brother man says
[42:27] oh you just leave your kids to grow up
[42:29] by themselves he says but bring them up
[42:31] in the nurture
[42:32] and admonition
[42:34] of the lord
[42:36] the nurture and admonition of the lord
[42:38] nurture means the whole training and
[42:39] instruction of the child
[42:42] the nurture of the lord
[42:44] the word nurture is a very deep word a
[42:47] very full word and it actually is
[42:48] referring to the full cultivation of the
[42:51] child mentally and physically
[42:54] it's not just providing him with
[42:56] something to eat so that his body
[42:58] matures but it's the cultivation of the
[43:01] mind and his morals
[43:03] paul isn't saying you know fathers
[43:04] provoke not your children to wrath by
[43:06] only feeding them tv dinners but bring
[43:08] them up with proper nutrition and
[43:10] grass-fed beef and avoiding grains and
[43:13] anything white and bleached flowers and
[43:16] any white sugars but it's more bring up
[43:18] in the nurtures the cultivation of the
[43:20] mind and the morals
[43:22] the word nurture it's instruction which
[43:25] aims to increase virtue
[43:28] in a lot of places in the word of god
[43:29] this very word is translated to
[43:30] chastisement
[43:32] and we automatically we think chastise
[43:34] we think pain right we think the belt
[43:36] the switch
[43:37] i'm going to scourge you and chastise
[43:38] you
[43:39] but chastisement is discipline
[43:41] or instruction
[43:43] and chastisement
[43:46] isn't harsh discipline it isn't loveless
[43:49] discipline
[43:50] if it's loveless and harsh it's not
[43:52] chastisement of the word of god
[43:55] sometimes we just get this wrong mental
[43:56] image of chastisement and though there
[43:59] could be some a punishment and some
[44:01] infliction of pain and during a
[44:03] particular age to reinforce certain
[44:04] things it's not shame and and the
[44:07] experience of this uh condemnation and
[44:11] shame that you try to impose
[44:12] chastisements make you just feel how bad
[44:14] and nasty you are no it's instruction
[44:16] which aims to increase virtue
[44:20] and then this phrase admonition the
[44:21] nurture of the lord and the admonition
[44:23] of the lord admonition is exhortation
[44:26] exhortation in this sense is the proper
[44:29] placing the proper setting of the mind
[44:31] and the emotions
[44:34] raise them up
[44:35] in the nurture of the lord
[44:37] teach them in a way that promotes virtue
[44:39] increases their virtue and cultivates
[44:41] their mind and their morals and and the
[44:42] whole training and instruction of a
[44:44] child develop their character and
[44:45] increase their increase their virtue
[44:47] within their spirits and then admonition
[44:49] this is an exhortation in other words
[44:51] there's praise there's instruction
[44:52] there's virtue that places them and
[44:54] settles their mind and emotions
[44:58] it's the bible is directly addressing
[45:01] this great belief system among he said
[45:02] modern witch doctors which said leave
[45:04] them alone don't speak to their emotions
[45:06] don't show any affection and the bible's
[45:08] saying no there has to be some nurture
[45:10] and admonition that is properly placing
[45:13] their mind that is properly balancing
[45:15] their emotions
[45:17] the word actually speaks to and you look
[45:19] at the other places it's used uh not
[45:21] used very often necessary but in other
[45:23] places it's improved means to improve
[45:25] their reasoning so they can reach god's
[45:27] solution
[45:29] in other words improve their thought
[45:30] process by going through his thought
[45:32] process
[45:34] teach your children to do that
[45:36] teach your children to process things
[45:38] the way god would process things improve
[45:40] their thought process improve their
[45:42] their handling of their emotions their
[45:43] measure of their emotions so that
[45:45] they'll reach god's solution
[45:47] i would say and maybe sister elizabeth
[45:49] could uh back this up maybe later don't
[45:51] need to do it on camera
[45:53] but that a lot of our instruction to our
[45:55] children is regulation of emotions
[45:58] and we spend a lot of time validating
[46:00] that you have every right to be
[46:01] frustrated you have every right to be
[46:03] mad you have every right to be hurt and
[46:04] upset yes i understand this is a
[46:06] disappointment this is painful
[46:09] and
[46:10] but you have to learn how to handle
[46:12] those
[46:12] emotions i i i don't want to be quick to
[46:15] tell them they're wrong to cry no
[46:17] crying's normal and you're gonna cry
[46:19] that's fine but there are certain things
[46:20] that you can exhibit when you're upset
[46:22] when you frustrated when somebody does
[46:23] something to harm you say no you can't
[46:25] do that you have to learn to process
[46:28] these things a different way and also
[46:30] reach god's solution so that if someone
[46:32] strikes you that hurts you get angry you
[46:34] want to strike them back but what would
[46:36] be god's solution to the problem
[46:39] you want to teach them
[46:41] to go through his thought process
[46:46] bring them up in the nurture and
[46:47] admonition of the lord
[46:49] ephesians 4 15 says but speaking the
[46:52] truth in love we address this here
[46:53] recently the christians got it all
[46:55] backwards we just thought when we tell
[46:56] somebody the truth that is love
[46:59] but no it means the truth has to be
[47:00] spoken in love
[47:02] speaking the truth in love it's not just
[47:04] taking quotations and waving them in
[47:06] people's face and scriptures you know
[47:08] what the bible says about this the bible
[47:09] says about that but the truth has to be
[47:11] spoken in love otherwise it doesn't
[47:13] cultivate
[47:15] it's only going to tear down
[47:17] but speaking the truth in love may grow
[47:20] up into him in all things which is the
[47:22] head even christ notice the spiritual
[47:25] this is the very literal scripture that
[47:26] the men men of god are to speak the
[47:28] truth in love and it's this truth with
[47:31] love and this relationship between the
[47:33] two and this motivating factor of
[47:35] speaking the truth that actually is
[47:36] going to nurture and cause someone to
[47:39] grow that speaking the truth in love
[47:41] will cause the church to grow up into
[47:43] christ and to all things and what i
[47:45] would say is that we can gather from
[47:47] that is something similar analogous to
[47:50] us who are to teach our children to
[47:52] raise them up and to bring them up in
[47:54] the nurture and admonition of the lord
[47:56] it's speaking the truth in love and that
[47:58] element not in a worldly sense but in
[48:00] the element of what really is godly love
[48:03] what really is godly nurture and
[48:04] admonition what really is showing care
[48:06] and concern for your child that's what's
[48:09] going to cause him to grow up into the
[48:10] right image
[48:16] if i could quote harry harlow
[48:19] one more time
[48:21] he says if monkeys taught us anything
[48:25] if monkeys have taught us anything it's
[48:27] that you've got to learn to how to love
[48:30] before you learn how to live
[48:33] that that could go on instagram right
[48:36] with the nice beach in the background of
[48:37] sunset maybe a nice filter
[48:41] if monkeys have taught us anything
[48:42] that's that you've gotta learn how to
[48:44] love
[48:45] before you learn how to live
[48:47] and i thought that's profound
[48:49] that really is profound it kind of has a
[48:51] real catchy ring to it and i would say
[48:54] that there's probably a way that we
[48:55] could sit down as believers and figure
[48:56] out just maybe the right way to express
[48:58] it scripturally but that if it's not
[49:00] until not until you're living in the
[49:02] love of god it's not until you have
[49:04] eternal life which is living for others
[49:06] and and this love of god is motivating
[49:08] it's not until then that you can
[49:09] actually learn how to live
[49:11] and we might be able to find a way to
[49:13] substantiate it but yet i wanted just to
[49:14] point this out and i read this just to
[49:16] come to this
[49:18] that though he could have make profound
[49:20] statements such as this
[49:22] and he could experience even from i
[49:24] think was the 1930s when he began to do
[49:26] this research and observe these
[49:27] differences among these monkeys that had
[49:29] parental care and ones that didn't and
[49:31] then was motivated by this uh
[49:34] this
[49:35] idea that you know
[49:37] love didn't matter affection didn't
[49:38] matter emotions didn't matter and then
[49:40] you begin to see maybe this other
[49:42] uh side come up and say well wait a
[49:43] minute we think these things are very
[49:44] important in developmental of the
[49:46] development of a child
[49:48] he took the went to great lengths when
[49:50] he began to see his i want to test this
[49:52] hypothesis i want to test these things
[49:54] and he was so rigorous he got so
[49:56] consumed with it that his experience
[49:58] began to get more and more
[49:59] seemingly harsh and social deprivation
[50:01] and different circumstances with these
[50:03] monkeys
[50:04] but he was despite his dedication to
[50:07] this learning to love the nature of love
[50:09] and his dedication to child development
[50:11] research
[50:13] harry harlow was an alcoholic absentee
[50:15] father
[50:18] isn't that amazing
[50:20] the one who's in his laboratory
[50:23] and knows just how horrible detachment
[50:26] can be
[50:28] still didn't have enough
[50:29] in knowledge
[50:32] to motivate him to correct
[50:36] think about it
[50:37] you would think the best father in the
[50:39] world right like the best husband in the
[50:40] world would be chapman right the one who
[50:42] knows all the love languages
[50:44] no i don't think the guy has a
[50:45] relationship with any of his wives let
[50:46] alone his children
[50:48] right
[50:51] and some of the other ones that get a
[50:52] lot of air time over pulpits
[50:54] they have horrible relationships with
[50:56] their children
[50:58] because sometimes even though they're
[50:59] quoting scripture they've left the
[51:00] spirit of it out
[51:03] and you can't do that you can't do that
[51:06] listen the message can be preached till
[51:07] people are blue in the face and the
[51:09] spirit be out of it
[51:11] the real spirit of it the real the real
[51:13] thought behind it and it's not hitting
[51:14] the mark and maybe everyone culturally
[51:16] conforms and they look like they look
[51:19] like they're believers but where's the
[51:20] spirit of it where's the nature of it
[51:25] so despite all that
[51:28] there still was an element missing
[51:31] that could take an alcoholic absentee
[51:32] father who knew everything
[51:34] scientifically and cause him to act in a
[51:37] way that would address the need
[51:40] brother brandon makes this statement he
[51:41] says it's just built up pressure
[51:43] it's the age that we're living in
[51:46] a neurotic age where people don't know
[51:48] what to do where they're going
[51:51] and the doctors don't have the answer
[51:52] for it
[51:54] because the psychiatrists are being
[51:55] doctored by the psychiatrist
[51:58] so they have not the answer
[52:00] harry harlow didn't have the answer
[52:03] and that's exactly what brother branham
[52:04] said the doctors don't have the answer
[52:06] the psychiatrists are being doctored by
[52:08] the psychiatrist so they don't have the
[52:09] answer
[52:11] they can tell you what the problem is
[52:13] and they can use science to remedy
[52:15] certain maladies and to try to address
[52:17] certain things but they don't really
[52:18] have the answer he says and then in
[52:19] another place then the nervous neurotic
[52:21] age that we're living in and you know in
[52:23] all of this the doctors don't have the
[52:24] answer because they're plagued with it
[52:26] too
[52:28] they don't have the answer they don't
[52:30] know what to do
[52:32] but i'm so glad god does
[52:35] i'm so glad christ is the answer to this
[52:37] and if this seems like a just an over
[52:39] generalization it's the one time you're
[52:41] absolutely dead on correct when you just
[52:43] want to generalize christ has the answer
[52:46] this word has the answer
[52:48] to the neuroticism in this neurotic age
[52:50] where people don't know what to do
[52:52] they're less sure of themselves than
[52:53] ever they're self-doubt it's leading to
[52:54] anxiety it's leading to worry this this
[52:57] situation their home makes it even more
[52:59] problematic it's manifest itself
[53:00] everywhere science says oh you know what
[53:02] what we need is we need the parental
[53:04] care we need the love of a mother we
[53:05] need the attentiveness of the parenthood
[53:07] this needs to be strong in order to
[53:08] properly nurture children to not be
[53:10] neurotics and the very ones that are
[53:12] espousing that can't overcome it and
[53:15] can't remedy it why because it takes
[53:17] something more
[53:20] i'll just i'll end with this scripture
[53:22] second timothy chapter 3 verses 16 to 17
[53:25] all inspiration is all scriptures given
[53:28] by inspiration of god and is profitable
[53:32] for doctrine
[53:34] yes for reproof
[53:36] for correction for instruction
[53:38] there's your nurture and admonition for
[53:41] instruction in righteousness
[53:43] the word of god given by the breath of
[53:45] god the heart of god the thought of god
[53:48] the god who made the human mind
[53:50] i want to expand upon this more later
[53:52] that god made the human mind and the
[53:54] human body in this alignment of
[53:57] body spirit and soul perfect in the
[54:00] beginning
[54:01] the fall interrupts this
[54:03] so in the beginning adam would have been
[54:05] perfect harmony with his spirit his
[54:06] emotions and everything the fall now
[54:08] begins to throw emotions and embody
[54:10] spirit and soul out of cater the soul
[54:12] gets darkened so now it's a warfare
[54:14] between the mind and body satan has
[54:16] access now to those realms uh which we
[54:18] could get into a greater degree and it's
[54:20] very very fascinating to see it in the
[54:21] word of god
[54:23] and do you not think that god from the
[54:25] very moment that these things begin to
[54:27] unfold that god wasn't writing a book
[54:30] a manual
[54:31] he wasn't providing a word that would be
[54:34] able to address the mindset and the
[54:36] mentality of people at the end time he's
[54:38] like no no no i wrote it already a
[54:40] thousand years ago
[54:41] i'd already provoked a few thousand
[54:43] years before that i even in the
[54:45] beginning laid out the way these things
[54:48] work upon the mind so you can go all the
[54:50] way back to genesis chapter 3 and begin
[54:53] to recognize
[54:55] how this human mind can be manipulated
[54:57] and controlled and break down and be
[54:59] susceptible to certain things
[55:01] so all scripture is given
[55:03] by god's inspiration and is beneficial
[55:06] and profitable for reprove correction
[55:08] instruction and righteousness
[55:09] for what that the man of god and i would
[55:12] say that we all as believers may be
[55:14] perfect throughly furnished unto all
[55:16] good works
[55:18] and i believe that that is speaking
[55:20] about the totality of our person
[55:22] not just the salvation of our souls but
[55:24] emotional harmony and the wellness of
[55:26] our body
[55:27] god is the one who can not only save the
[55:30] soul and heal the body but align our
[55:32] spirits
[55:34] that we might be truly furnished unto
[55:36] all good works
[55:38] the word of god is meant for that the
[55:40] word of god is the answer
[55:44] so that's the second installment of
[55:46] character disorders
[55:48] and the subject of parental love and
[55:50] neuroticism now do you know where i got
[55:52] the title
[55:53] brother braham says that failure of
[55:55] parental love that caused the
[55:57] neuroticism so it's our love even our
[55:59] love towards one another
[56:01] that can be health
[56:03] against the
