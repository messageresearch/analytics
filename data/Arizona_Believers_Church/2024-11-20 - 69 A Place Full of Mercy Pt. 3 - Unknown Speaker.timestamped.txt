[0:00] that is such a a remarkable reading and
[0:02] there's a lot there that we could
[0:03] Fellowship on in that and we'll come
[0:06] back to it here in just a few moments
[0:08] but I'd like just to reset our subject
[0:10] on a Place full of mercy and I've HED
[0:14] that through the last several Services
[0:16] we've been able to see with an honest
[0:18] look at the message of the hour and the
[0:19] scriptures that are being fulfilled that
[0:21] we're living in a moment when mercy is
[0:23] of great concern that when we see uh the
[0:26] totality of things and the finality of
[0:28] things and we see the IM of a body
[0:30] change and uh the signs around us
[0:33] everywhere then we know that uh Mercy
[0:35] becomes a very critical question and
[0:37] it's the question that brother brandham
[0:39] had when he preached uh the souls that
[0:40] are in prison now and he's probing and
[0:43] he's even asking questions could it be
[0:45] and it's because judgment was striking
[0:49] and brother B makes those statements how
[0:51] that judgment is striking that the
[0:52] Judgment hour of judgment is at hand and
[0:55] these are things that brother brandham
[0:56] was saying in his ministry uh preaching
[0:59] the Flash ing red lights and God doesn't
[1:01] send a warning God doesn't judge a man
[1:03] until he first sends a warning and so
[1:05] brother bram's using a language in a lot
[1:07] of his sermons still preaching some
[1:09] Evangelistic and still trying to bring
[1:11] the the whole message in a way to where
[1:14] uh people could understand what God had
[1:15] been doing in the church ages and all
[1:17] the different facets of God's Great
[1:19] Beauty but yet in there he's mentioning
[1:21] things to get people's attention about
[1:23] the the urgency of the time that we're
[1:25] living in I think the sermon the token
[1:27] would be a very good one to see where
[1:29] brother Ms I identifying this great need
[1:32] and get under that token get under that
[1:33] token the hour of judgment is striking
[1:36] and get under that token and then
[1:37] desperations because it was in a time
[1:39] when that that plague is coming that
[1:41] Death Angel is going to pass and you
[1:43] needed to be under that token in order
[1:45] to be
[1:46] rescued and I want to use tonight just
[1:49] uh will'll be very focused on if I could
[1:52] say it this way on how Mercy works of
[1:54] course I there's just no way you take a
[1:56] Wednesday night and tell you everything
[1:58] about how Mercy works and and uh don't
[2:01] get too superstitious if you've come
[2:02] across the word mercy in the last few
[2:04] weeks as you've been studying your
[2:05] Bibles that doesn't vindicate me CU it's
[2:08] everywhere uh you know there just really
[2:10] you know he preached about Jesus and I
[2:11] saw that in my Bible he he must be
[2:14] Vindicated uh but there's uh I want to
[2:17] look at how Mercy works by looking
[2:19] specifically at Paul this uh juncture in
[2:22] the Apostle Paul's life so it's going to
[2:24] be focused I think but there's just a
[2:26] lot of breath that the Holy Spirit can
[2:27] give to you tonight now in Ephesians
[2:30] 2:4 I want to start with this I do
[2:32] encourage you to go listen to the sermon
[2:34] The God Who is rich in Mercy January
[2:36] 19th 1965 right here in Phoenix at the
[2:39] westward hoe he says but God who is rich
[2:42] in Mercy for his great love wherewith he
[2:44] loved us he said the greatest thing is
[2:47] being rich which is abounding in Mercy
[2:49] or kindness and more than material
[2:52] possessions and more than wealth and
[2:53] more than all those things that if we
[2:55] could uh that God being rich in Mercy
[2:57] should mean more to us than anything
[2:59] else else and we know that mercy God who
[3:02] is rich in Mercy for his great love
[3:04] wherewith he loved us if we look there
[3:06] in the context of Ephesians chapter 2 we
[3:08] see that Mercy came in the form of Jesus
[3:11] Christ in that Paradox of him being a
[3:14] substitute of the atonement for us so
[3:16] God has Mercy on us because of our sins
[3:19] by bringing satisfying or appeasing his
[3:22] wrath or judgment in Christ so Christ
[3:24] was that form of Mercy or he contained
[3:27] that Mercy as being the atonement
[3:29] himself or The Substitute now I want us
[3:31] to just start right there with God who
[3:33] is rich in Mercy and he sends us Jesus
[3:36] Christ so let's look at Romans chap 3:
[3:38] 19- 26 as I was going through these
[3:42] scriptures this week I thought well this
[3:43] is just really like a a Bible study or a
[3:46] Sunday school lesson but a lot of times
[3:48] I heard we're just going to have a
[3:49] Sunday school lesson kind of just to
[3:51] signal to us we're going to get out of
[3:52] here pretty quick uh but I don't
[3:54] necessarily look at it that way uh but
[3:57] this is just real focused on scripture
[3:59] tonight and I hope there's a lot that
[4:00] you can grab a hold of verse 19 now we
[4:04] know that what things soever this the
[4:06] law saith it saith to them who are under
[4:09] the law that every mouth may be stopped
[4:12] and all the world may become guilty
[4:15] before God so there's this idea of all
[4:17] men being guilty and it puts men in this
[4:19] precarious situation especially whatever
[4:21] the law says we all guilty before God
[4:24] therefore by the Deeds of the law there
[4:26] shall no flesh be justified in his sight
[4:30] for by the law is the knowledge of sin
[4:32] it's a a unique facet of the law that
[4:36] Paul brings up and how that the laws is
[4:38] what gives us a consciousness of sin and
[4:40] the law is what condemns us and the law
[4:42] tells us that we really can't govern
[4:44] ourselves we need something else to
[4:45] restrain us and so all that the law can
[4:48] do is give us a knowledge of what is
[4:49] wrong and uh we try yet we're guilty
[4:53] before God by it and no flesh is
[4:55] justified by the law well that's all
[4:57] that Israel was under was the law so he
[4:59] says but now the righteousness of God
[5:02] without the law is manifested now what
[5:05] was that how is it manifested we know
[5:08] it's manifested in Jesus Christ being
[5:10] witnessed by the law and the prophets
[5:12] which pointed to Christ we see that in
[5:15] the scripture even the righteousness of
[5:17] God which is by faith of Jesus Christ
[5:19] unto all and upon all them that believe
[5:23] so the righteousness of God Is by faith
[5:25] through Jesus Christ in them that
[5:27] believe there's your formula of faith in
[5:29] Jesus Christ and there's this
[5:31] righteousness of God which you gain
[5:33] through believing in Jesus Christ he
[5:35] says for there is no difference verse 23
[5:38] for all have sinned and come short of
[5:40] the glory of God but we so we can all of
[5:43] us being in sin we can only have the
[5:45] righteousness of God through Jesus
[5:47] Christ and our faith in him so this is
[5:50] our way to being accepted by God by
[5:52] being right before God being correct or
[5:54] Justified or uh being deemed right and
[5:58] correct before God so he said says verse
[6:00] 24 being justified freely by his grace
[6:02] through the Redemption that is in Christ
[6:05] Jesus by faith uh which faith is by
[6:08] Jesus Christ is through Jesus Christ you
[6:11] just see this pattern here now speaking
[6:13] of Christ Jesus is whom God hath set
[6:16] forth to be a
[6:18] pritu through faith in his blood now
[6:20] there's a a a phrase there he has been
[6:24] set forth as this propitiation through
[6:27] faith in his blood so he can't be this
[6:30] perpetuation without
[6:32] faith faith in it through faith in his
[6:34] blood to declare righteousness for the
[6:37] remission of sins that are passed
[6:39] through the forbearance of God so it's
[6:42] this longsuffering of God a forbear he
[6:44] was he he he didn't judge he didn't
[6:46] condemn so there's this forbearance of
[6:48] God and then he declares this remission
[6:50] of sins of sins that are passed through
[6:53] faith in this
[6:55] perpetuation through faith in his blood
[6:57] he has set forth as a perpetuation then
[6:59] he says says in verse 26 to declare I
[7:01] say at this time his righteousness that
[7:03] he might be just and the justifier of
[7:06] him which believeth in Jesus so how is
[7:09] one Justified how is one right or
[7:12] correct through faith in Jesus Christ
[7:14] through faith in his blood and through
[7:16] by the faith of Jesus Christ we are
[7:18] partakers of the righteousness of God
[7:20] through uh by this work of the calvary
[7:23] the sacrifice that was made this word
[7:26] perpetuation I know you've probably
[7:27] heard this before even ourselves having
[7:29] recently referred to it uh it's kind of
[7:32] a it's a word maybe if you say too often
[7:34] you start getting a little bit of a list
[7:35] but perpetuation it's a means of
[7:38] appeasing so if someone's angry it's
[7:40] plating it's
[7:41] satisfying and so it's a means of s
[7:44] appeasing someone's wrath or anger or
[7:47] something that's being required an
[7:48] example would be the blood of a
[7:50] sacrifice that was shed under the law
[7:52] was a pretu it was a means of appeasing
[7:55] or satisfying a requirement and
[7:58] perpetuation comes from the root word to
[8:00] be merciful or to make reconciliation to
[8:04] show Mercy or be merciful is what is
[8:06] meant in this word he has set him forth
[8:08] to be a pritu a means of appeasing and
[8:12] since there was a means of satisfying a
[8:13] means of appeasing that is done through
[8:15] Mercy that is done in being merciful and
[8:18] it's used of the cover of the Ark in the
[8:21] most holy place which was called in some
[8:23] places the lid of propitiation so this
[8:26] is a when he said he set him forth to be
[8:28] this it it's referencing even that
[8:31] special place in the holiest of holies
[8:33] the most holy place this lid of pritu
[8:36] this Ark uh of the Covenant there
[8:39] between the cherubims and he said he set
[8:41] him forth to be a
[8:43] perpetuation in Hebrews chapter 9 verses
[8:45] 1 to5 so we could see this aspect in
[8:49] Jesus Christ it says then verily the
[8:50] first Covenant had also ordinances of
[8:53] divine service and a worldly Sanctuary
[8:56] this is him showing these different uh
[8:58] outer Court inner Court uh would be this
[9:02] uh worldly Sanctuary for there was a
[9:03] tabernacle made the first wherein was
[9:05] the Candlestick and the table and the
[9:06] showbread which is called the sanctuary
[9:09] and after the second Veil The Tabernacle
[9:13] this is he shall hide me in the secret
[9:15] of his Tabernacle uh he shall set me up
[9:17] upon a rock there's in this uh there
[9:19] between the cherubims where God dwells
[9:21] this is that place that David longed to
[9:23] be after the second Ville the Tabernacle
[9:25] which is called the holiest of all which
[9:28] had the golden sensor and the Ark of the
[9:30] Covenant overlaid roundabout with gold
[9:33] wherein was the golden pot that had mana
[9:35] and Aaron's Rod that budded and the TA
[9:37] tables of the Covenant what is he
[9:40] describing in the house of the Lord the
[9:42] most holy place where God dwelt and over
[9:45] it the cherums of Glory over of Glory
[9:49] shadowing The Mercy Seat notice how it's
[9:51] one word mercy seat of which we cannot
[9:54] now speak particularly this word mercy
[9:57] seat is the same exact word you used in
[9:59] Romans 3 perpetuation so he said whom
[10:02] God hath set forth to be a perpetuation
[10:04] through faith in his blood we could read
[10:06] it and over it the cherubims of Glory
[10:09] shadowing the
[10:10] perpetuation of which we cannot now
[10:12] speak particularly or we could read it
[10:14] this way that God hath set forth to be
[10:18] whom Jesus Christ God hath set forth to
[10:20] be a mercy seat right now think of this
[10:24] what this means cuz I I I I this is very
[10:27] helpful for me just in my walk with with
[10:29] the Lord to understand cuz when we think
[10:31] Mercy seed I know we sometimes literally
[10:33] get this idea in our minds that there's
[10:35] a place set in heaven that is a chair
[10:39] and that as long as Jesus Christ is
[10:40] sitting in that chair there's mercy and
[10:42] so if he gets up
[10:44] like okay false along right and so it's
[10:47] almost like this thing he's like and
[10:50] he's just tempting us to think no mercy
[10:51] yes mercy no no no no but it's it's not
[10:54] that it's that God has declared Jesus
[10:56] Christ as The Mercy Seat he the place of
[11:00] reconciliation through faith in his
[11:02] blood he is a mercy seat through this
[11:04] work of Calvary he becomes this uh pritu
[11:08] this a means of appeasing and so in
[11:11] Jesus Christ God has set him forth to be
[11:13] a mercy seat so he is a place of
[11:16] judgment because he's going to judge the
[11:17] World by one man Jesus Christ but Jesus
[11:21] Christ has also been set forth as a
[11:23] means of reconciliation as a means of
[11:25] satisfying God's
[11:27] Wrath now let's turn to Acts chapter 17
[11:30] we'll start where we did at the
[11:32] beginning in verse
[11:33] 22 we'll read on down to verse 31 again
[11:36] now let's just look at this how this
[11:39] Mercy is working I think it's wonderful
[11:41] to do this because in Reading in Romans
[11:44] and Hebrews we we see even according to
[11:46] Ephesians that something has happened
[11:48] and Christ has been set forth as a mercy
[11:51] seat and for sins passed and you wonder
[11:53] well this haven't happened since this
[11:56] has happened where do we stand right now
[11:59] what what's the uh what's the verdict
[12:01] are we all guilty before God and how
[12:04] does God condemn those past and those
[12:06] present and those future so Paul stood
[12:08] in the midst of Mars Hill and said ye
[12:11] men of Athens I perceive that in all
[12:13] things you are too superstitious for as
[12:16] I passed by and beheld your devotions I
[12:18] found an altar with the inscription to
[12:20] the unknown God so this is the god they
[12:23] did not know so they're ignorant they
[12:24] have no knowledge of this God they're
[12:26] admitting it whom therefore ye
[12:28] ignorantly worship
[12:30] the one that you have proclaimed to be
[12:32] worshiping ignorantly I will declare him
[12:35] to
[12:36] you you've been praising God you've been
[12:39] worshiping God but he's not known to you
[12:40] he's an unknown God you've had these
[12:42] superstitions and these means of
[12:44] worshiping a deity that you didn't know
[12:47] but now I'm going to declare him to you
[12:49] so that you're no longer ignorant so
[12:52] whom you therefore have been worshiping
[12:53] ignorant I'll preach him to you and then
[12:55] he kind of gives this sermon God that
[12:57] made the world and all things therein
[12:59] seeing that he is Lord of Heaven and
[13:00] Earth dwelleth not in temples made with
[13:03] hand so you're not going to find him
[13:04] here in your altars you're not going to
[13:06] find him in these worldly um edifices
[13:08] these are things that man makes neither
[13:10] is he worshiped with man's hands as
[13:12] though he needed anything seeing he
[13:14] giveth to all life and breath and all
[13:16] things so he's clearly establishing
[13:18] there's one God who's above all and he
[13:21] hath made of one blood all nations of
[13:22] men for to dwell on all the face of the
[13:24] Earth and have determined the times
[13:26] before appointed and the bounds of their
[13:28] habitation now we might be thinking wow
[13:30] this is kind of real Elementary but if
[13:32] someone believed in multiple deities and
[13:34] they they thought Venus was going to do
[13:36] this and Saturn was going to do that and
[13:37] all and not the planets but the gods and
[13:39] there was this idea of all these
[13:41] different mythical Gods he said no
[13:43] there's not a whole bunch of gods
[13:44] there's one God who made everything he's
[13:46] the god that's above all and he's set
[13:48] and determined all these bounds and he's
[13:50] caused by one blood not some from this
[13:52] deity and some from this mythology but
[13:55] by one blood we've come into this Earth
[13:58] and of all all mankind of of speaking of
[14:00] everyone says that they should seek the
[14:03] Lord if happily they might feel after
[14:05] him and find him though he be not far
[14:08] from every one of us so it was in Man by
[14:12] thirst and by desire that God would that
[14:15] they would seek after him and if one
[14:17] would genuinely seek after him he said
[14:19] that they would find him because he's
[14:20] not far from us and he says for in him
[14:21] we live and move and have our being as
[14:24] certain also of your own poets have said
[14:25] for we are also his offspring very
[14:29] it's neat to go back and find the
[14:32] different pop culture references that
[14:35] Paul was using in his time and the
[14:36] things that he would call back to that
[14:38] to somebody here in Athens would be like
[14:40] see what you did there right because
[14:42] there was he was uh he would be able to
[14:44] make it relatable to them I just find it
[14:46] really fascinating he said for as much
[14:48] then as we are also his offspring we
[14:50] ought not to think that the godhead is
[14:52] like unto gold or silver or stone Graven
[14:55] by Art in man's devices so we can't make
[14:57] him he doesn't need our hand hands he's
[14:59] declaring God to them and then he says
[15:02] and the times of this
[15:05] ignorance the times of this ignorant
[15:07] could be them thinking that the godhead
[15:09] is likened to gold or silver Stone by
[15:11] Art Graven by art or man's devices but
[15:13] we can say that the ignorance is
[15:15] certainly ignorantly worshiping him as
[15:19] in verse 26 whom you are ignorantly
[15:21] worshiping this one that you are
[15:22] ignorant of and you've had this time of
[15:24] ignorance I'm going to declare God to
[15:27] you he says the times this ignorance God
[15:30] winked at in other words there was a
[15:32] time when the fact that you were
[15:33] ignorant God didn't hold it to your
[15:36] charge that God let you worship
[15:38] ignorantly that God didn't judge you and
[15:40] that God was longsuffering and he was
[15:42] forbearing but now this God at one time
[15:45] was merciful if we could say that
[15:47] because of your ignorance but now
[15:49] commandeth all men everywhere to repent
[15:53] he's not just the god of the Jews he's
[15:54] not just the god of the mountains he's
[15:56] not just the god of the Israelites and
[15:57] the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob he's
[15:59] a God to Those whom he calls to and who
[16:01] he beckons to and who he wants to draw
[16:03] upon so he commands all men everywhere
[16:06] to repent now why is he asked all men
[16:09] everywhere to repent because Heath
[16:11] appointed a day in the which he will
[16:13] judge the world in righteousness by that
[16:15] man whom he hath ordained wherefore he
[16:17] hath given Assurance unto all men and
[16:19] that he hath raised him from the dead
[16:21] and then they kind of mock him about the
[16:23] resurrection of the dead but Paul now
[16:26] sets forth this moment where those who
[16:30] had been ignorantly worshiping God and
[16:33] don't really know him and and honest
[16:35] about it that listen there was a time
[16:38] when your ignorant worship was get okay
[16:41] but now he has sent forth his son Jesus
[16:44] Christ and he's manifestly declared him
[16:46] to be the Christ and you have to believe
[16:49] upon him and through this sacrifice I
[16:51] know I'm adding maybe a lot more to the
[16:53] gospel as Paul would have taught it that
[16:55] by this uh by this pretu and by this
[16:59] sacrifice we're to repent of our sins
[17:02] we're to uh be identified with this
[17:04] sacrifice so he says he commands men
[17:07] everywhere to repent because one day all
[17:10] men are going to be
[17:12] judged in maybe not in this exact moment
[17:14] well I refuse to repent lightning
[17:16] strikes them and they're gone doesn't
[17:18] happen that way he's saying there's
[17:19] going to be a day and there's going to
[17:20] be a time appointed when we're all going
[17:22] to be judged and we're going to be
[17:23] judged by the attitude towards the word
[17:26] of God going to be judged by what did
[17:29] with the word of God or attitude towards
[17:30] the word of God and there's going to be
[17:32] some who when they're judged though they
[17:34] may not have uh fully received the word
[17:37] of God but they showed Mercy to those
[17:39] who were the word and mercy shown is
[17:42] Mercy given so there's a lot of things
[17:44] that work in the Judgment but we see
[17:46] here that there's going to be a time of
[17:47] judgment so God is God knowing that he's
[17:50] going to judge all men is saying okay
[17:53] now we need to repent then we need to
[17:55] repent in Acts chap 14: 16 it's a very
[17:58] short verse who in times past suffered
[18:01] All Nations to walk in their own ways
[18:03] who is this God God in times past or in
[18:07] times of ignorance allowed man to walk
[18:09] in darkness now what allowed him to do
[18:12] that was his longsuffering it was he
[18:14] wasn't being
[18:15] wishy-washy I there was I think Sunday
[18:18] morning I want to get into maybe more
[18:19] detail on this aspect of Mercy as we
[18:22] referred to it on Sunday and I thought
[18:23] i' just carry that thought on Sunday
[18:25] over to Sunday morning just uh put this
[18:27] in here for the Wednesday night uh
[18:29] Gathering is that God's mercy isn't weak
[18:33] it's it's not spineless it's it's not uh
[18:36] boundless in the sense that he has no
[18:38] standards so God in times past or in
[18:43] times past suffered All Nations to walk
[18:45] in their own ways he allowed men to walk
[18:48] in darkness there was a time when we
[18:49] could say that ignorance was an excuse
[18:52] and God was merciful because of that
[18:55] ignorance you can say well what what do
[18:57] you expect the Gentiles to do what do
[18:58] expect the reprobates to do they even
[19:01] have a hunger inside of them to worship
[19:02] something Beyond themselves and so that
[19:04] they're sincere and they're worshiping
[19:06] and sincerity and they're they're
[19:07] wanting to do right and they they're not
[19:09] necessarily looking to themselves but
[19:11] they're trying to make sense of the
[19:12] world it's the reason why you found all
[19:14] sorts of Nations and people worshiping
[19:16] different things because like man fire
[19:18] just ruined our entire Village and they
[19:20] worship the fire god like man if we
[19:22] don't get rain we're not our crops
[19:24] aren't going to grow so they worship the
[19:25] clouds and there was a way that they
[19:27] recognized they were behold into
[19:29] something Beyond themselves and they
[19:30] tried to appease it through offerings
[19:32] and chants and meditation so these were
[19:34] things that man could be doing sincerely
[19:36] but the hour had come when they were
[19:38] sincerely wrong yes because God is going
[19:41] to declare to them Jesus Christ and so
[19:43] God was merciful because there was no
[19:44] clear way made for them to be brought
[19:46] into fellowship with the one true God
[19:48] but we can say now Christ has forever
[19:50] consecrated this new way this new way
[19:54] had been made to receive the same Mercy
[19:58] that they received in their ignorance
[20:00] cuz what was God doing he was forbearing
[20:02] even to think that there's some that God
[20:04] has Mercy on and that they'd never heard
[20:06] the gospel and God isn't going to judge
[20:08] them by the fact that they haven't
[20:10] heard and that's mercy so now there's a
[20:14] new way it's a way to receive the same
[20:17] Mercy you would have had in ignorance
[20:19] you catch that I don't know if that's
[20:21] maybe a an odd way of distinguishing it
[20:23] but let's watch how it works with
[20:26] Paul in 1 Timothy chap 1:
[20:30] 3-16 this reading will contain one of my
[20:33] favorite phrases in scripture extra
[20:35] credit if you can guess what that is as
[20:38] I besought Thee to abide still Ephesus
[20:41] when I went into Macedonia that thou
[20:43] mightest charge some that they teach no
[20:45] other Doctrine neither give heed to
[20:47] fables and endless genealogies which
[20:49] minister questions rather than Godly
[20:51] edifying which is in faith so do now the
[20:54] end of the Commandment is Charity of a
[20:56] pure heart and of a good conscience and
[20:58] a faith and unfeigned for which some
[21:01] having swerved have turned aside unto
[21:05] vain
[21:07] jangling that just about describes it
[21:09] all these days vain jangling Desiring to
[21:13] be teachers of the law understanding
[21:15] neither what they say nor what they
[21:17] affirm but we know that the law is good
[21:20] if a man use it lawfully knowing this
[21:22] that the law is not made for righteous
[21:24] man but for the Lawless and disobedient
[21:27] for the ungodly and for sin ERS for
[21:29] Unholy and profane for murders of
[21:31] fathers and murders of mothers for
[21:33] manslayers for whoremongers for them
[21:35] that defile themselves with mankind for
[21:37] MERS for liars for perjured persons and
[21:40] if there be any thing that is contrary
[21:42] to sound Doctrine he was on a
[21:45] roll he says according to the Glorious
[21:47] Gospel of the Blessed God which was
[21:49] committed to my trust Paul is such an
[21:52] amazing guy and he's just kind of just
[21:55] this burn list right whoremongers and
[21:57] them that defile them Stealers Liars
[21:59] perjured persons he's really and then
[22:01] notice verse 12 and I thank Christ Jesus
[22:04] our lord who hath enabled me for that he
[22:07] counted me faithful putting me into the
[22:10] ministry who was before a blasphemer and
[22:13] a persecutor and injures I he's just
[22:17] kind of gone through quite the resume of
[22:18] the Monger those that defile
[22:20] themselves with mankind for men Stealers
[22:21] Liars purged persons any other thing
[22:23] contrary to sound Doctrine to murders of
[22:25] mothers and fathers profane Unholy
[22:27] ungodly Lawless
[22:29] disobedient quite a Rowdy bunch a lot of
[22:32] vain jangling in those
[22:34] sentences Bas or
[22:37] sorts lwd fellows he says but I no so he
[22:42] says I'm a blasphemer persecutor and
[22:43] injures but I obtained Mercy because I
[22:47] did it ignorantly in unbelief now it may
[22:50] be saying this a little bit in a
[22:52] condescending way but I really want you
[22:53] to catch what he just said I was a
[22:55] blasphemer I was a persecutor and I was
[22:57] inous
[22:58] but I obtained Mercy something in this
[23:01] phrase you'll find in several places I
[23:04] obtained Mercy it's not so much
[23:06] something that's incidental but it's
[23:07] something that you receive that you
[23:09] carry the benefit of
[23:12] forever it's not just uh well you know
[23:15] Mercy in this instance and then mercy in
[23:17] another instance but it's something that
[23:19] is Everlasting I obtained Mercy because
[23:21] I did it ignorantly and unbelief now
[23:23] hold that in your thought and the grace
[23:25] of our Lord was exceeding abundantly
[23:27] with all faith and love which is in
[23:28] Christ Jesus he's saying to himself this
[23:31] is a faithful saying and worthy of all
[23:33] acceptation that Christ Jesus came into
[23:35] the world to save Sinners of whom I am
[23:38] chief he he's even competitive I guess
[23:41] in some ways about who is the bigger
[23:42] sinner chiefest of Sinners and your
[23:45] Revelation added nothing to mine when I
[23:46] came amongst you he's uh and he says so
[23:49] he's chiefest of Sinner who was a
[23:52] blasphemer or persecutor in inous but he
[23:55] obtained Mercy because he did it
[23:58] ignorantly in unbelief now quite a
[24:00] statement I don't mean to make light of
[24:01] it but I really want you to see what
[24:03] he's setting forth and maybe look at it
[24:04] with some rawness to it because then he
[24:06] says how be it for this cause I obtained
[24:09] Mercy now why was Paul who was a
[24:12] blasphemer a persecutor he was a
[24:14] murderer
[24:15] too why was it that he obtained mercy
[24:18] and then he kind of adds this caveat but
[24:20] I was ignorant in my unbelief why did he
[24:22] obtain Mercy that in me first Jesus
[24:25] Christ might show forth all
[24:26] longsuffering
[24:28] for a pattern to them which should
[24:31] Hereafter believe on him to life
[24:34] Everlasting Paul is saying that God
[24:36] wants to use me to demonstrate how Mercy
[24:39] works that is a pattern not just for
[24:42] everyone but it's a pattern to those who
[24:44] will believe on Jesus Christ it is a
[24:47] pattern to those who were persecutors
[24:49] and blasphemers and injurers and
[24:51] murderers and profane people disobedient
[24:53] and Unholy they he I am a pattern to you
[24:56] that though you were deep in sin and you
[24:58] couldn't be the chiefest because he was
[25:00] the chiefest but though we be princes of
[25:02] sinning and almost the chief sinner he
[25:04] is saying that God wants to use me as an
[25:06] example of how his Mercy will work if
[25:09] you believe on
[25:10] him he says he's a chief sinner he
[25:13] claims and being a chief sinner who a
[25:15] blasphemer a persecutor and a murderer
[25:18] he claims ignorance as the reason for
[25:20] him obtaining
[25:22] mercy and not just the only reason why
[25:26] he obtained Mercy but that God dealing
[25:29] with Paul in his ignorance shows how
[25:31] God's mercy Works cuz notice Paul's not
[25:34] saying he's not up there as a continued
[25:37] persecutor he's not up there as a
[25:40] continued uh injures person to other
[25:43] people Paul is not doing the same things
[25:45] he did before and says God's been
[25:47] merciful to me isn't God
[25:49] wonderful right he's not necessarily
[25:51] just continuing to live in the Sin but
[25:53] he's saying that I'm an example of how
[25:55] God's mercy works the way that God dealt
[25:58] with me in my ignorance shows how God
[26:01] will extend Mercy to those who believe
[26:03] on him to everlasting life
[26:06] amen I'm not I wouldn't ask that you see
[26:09] it this
[26:11] way or demand that you know that this is
[26:14] your understanding as you read these
[26:16] scriptures but I would challenge you to
[26:19] search it and pray about it to un to
[26:21] catch why God was wanting to use Paul as
[26:24] a pattern to those of us who would
[26:26] believe after him
[26:28] to those who would come later and live
[26:31] lives that were sinful and find
[26:33] ourselves because Paul is not one that
[26:34] would claim ignorance like why didn't
[26:36] even know there was a God too late for
[26:38] that right I didn't even know there was
[26:40] supposed to be a messiah too late for
[26:41] that he said is touching the law
[26:44] blameless he was well taught he knew the
[26:46] law he knew the he knew the word he knew
[26:48] the requirements and he was very zealous
[26:50] in these
[26:52] things and he's an example of how God
[26:54] deals with people in their ignorance so
[26:57] let's look at Acts chapter 9 I just will
[26:58] choose to use this telling of the story
[27:01] verse one and Saul this is Paul now yet
[27:04] breathing out threatenings and Slaughter
[27:07] against the Disciples of the Lord now
[27:09] could you imagine if
[27:10] somebody kind of read his
[27:13] telling I was inous to people and I
[27:16] wasn't a very good guy and then you find
[27:17] out he's breathing out threatenings and
[27:19] Slaughter against the Disciples of the
[27:20] Lord Paul did not delete this
[27:22] tweet still here for everyone to read
[27:26] went unto the high priest
[27:28] and desired of him letters to Damascus
[27:31] to the synagogues that if he found any
[27:33] of this way whether they be men or women
[27:35] he might bring them bound into Jerusalem
[27:38] wow okay he now wants to go into Syria
[27:41] he wants to go to Damascus and round up
[27:43] any Christians and these these
[27:45] synagogues these places of teaching and
[27:47] he wants to round up not just the men
[27:49] but the women and bring them bound to
[27:51] Jerusalem to kill
[27:53] him he's breathing out threatenings and
[27:56] Slaughter against the Disciples of the
[27:57] Lord so he goes and he asks for
[27:59] permission to persecute to hunt down all
[28:03] these so-called Christians so now he's
[28:05] got the papers and he's on his way verse
[28:06] three and as he journeyed he came near
[28:08] Damascus and suddenly there shined round
[28:10] about him a light from heaven and he
[28:12] fell to the Earth and heard a voice
[28:14] saying unto him Saul Saul why
[28:16] persecutest thou me and In This Moment
[28:20] Paul
[28:22] recognizes God is revealing himself to
[28:25] him that this isn't he had too much to
[28:27] eat this isn't a a sorcerer trick he
[28:30] says who art thou
[28:32] Lord and the Lord said and this is a
[28:35] very beautiful phrase I am
[28:38] Jesus first uh red flag for him or it's
[28:42] in that moment he's like oh I think I
[28:45] messed up this isn't going to go well
[28:49] who are you Lord I'm Jesus whom thou
[28:53] persecutest Jesus is now at the right
[28:56] hand of the father on high God is
[28:58] revealed himself to him and he does it
[29:00] through Jesus Christ he says I'm Jesus
[29:03] whom you are persecuting and who was he
[29:05] persecuting how is he persecuting Christ
[29:06] through his body which was on Earth
[29:09] through those of that way that he was
[29:12] breathing out threatenings to and
[29:13] slaughtering the Disciples of the Lord
[29:15] were Christ on Earth that's why they
[29:17] called them Christians and Jesus says I
[29:20] am them whom you are persecuting is it
[29:22] hard for thee to kick against the Pricks
[29:25] was there something working so deep
[29:28] within the consciousness of Paul even in
[29:30] his subconscious where God was calling
[29:32] to him and the more that he called to
[29:34] him the more he fought against it the
[29:35] more he wrestled with it and he
[29:37] trembling and astonished said Paul is
[29:39] just broken in these very short moments
[29:42] Lord What wilt thou have me to
[29:47] do I imagine I I don't I I I I'm not I
[29:52] wouldn't just say well this is all that
[29:53] was said and it would be certainly
[29:58] acceptable to think that maybe there was
[29:59] more going on or more time or more
[30:01] wrestling and maybe it wasn't just
[30:03] immediate but maybe there's some
[30:04] agonizing moments going by but notice
[30:07] Paul is caught up in this moment who are
[30:08] you Lord Elohim yahovah who are you I'm
[30:13] Jesus you're persecuting me is it hard
[30:16] to keep fighting against this thing
[30:18] that's prodding your conscience and he
[30:21] says he he's resigned Lord what wil thou
[30:23] have me to do he said you're not Jesus
[30:27] you know just he just said what would
[30:29] you have me to do and the Lord said unto
[30:30] him arise and go into the City so he's
[30:32] going to continue to Damascus and it
[30:34] shall be told thee what thou must
[30:37] do Christ reveals himself to a
[30:40] blasphemer he reveals himself to a
[30:42] persecutor he reveals himself to some to
[30:45] someone who is breathing out
[30:46] threatenings and Slaughter against the
[30:47] Disciples of the Lord and is on his way
[30:49] to do
[30:50] it and his response is well what would
[30:54] you have me to do and this is what Paul
[30:56] is pointing out when he says he is a
[30:58] blasphemer when Paul uses the term
[31:00] blasphemer we're not talking about
[31:02] people who say well I prefer a Chevy and
[31:04] the Ford guy is like
[31:05] blasphemy right you know you drive an
[31:07] electric car blasphemy that we just use
[31:10] the term so loosely but in Leviticus
[31:13] 24:16 he that blasphemeth the name of
[31:15] the Lord he shall surely be put to death
[31:18] who art thou Lord I am Jesus whom thou
[31:20] persecutest Leviticus 2416 comes into
[31:23] play and all the congregation shall
[31:24] certainly Stone him as well the stranger
[31:27] as he that is born in the land when he
[31:29] blasphemeth the name of the Lord shall
[31:31] be put to
[31:32] death if anything this is what Paul
[31:35] thought he was
[31:37] enforcing as this Zealot as this one
[31:40] after the order of penhos said I'm going
[31:43] to follow after and hunt down all these
[31:46] people who blasphemed the name of the
[31:48] Lord by saying Jesus Christ is the Lord
[31:50] by saying Jesus was the Messiah I'm
[31:52] going to put him to death according to
[31:55] the law and Paul by saying he's a
[31:56] blasphemer has put himself guilty
[32:01] himself and we notice that it was the
[32:03] Holy Ghost working in the Disciples of
[32:05] the Lord it was Christ making himself
[32:07] known and revealing himself to these
[32:09] disciples and Jesus says in Matthew
[32:11] 12:31 wherefore I say unto you all
[32:12] manner of sin and blasphemy shall be
[32:14] forgiven unto men but the blasphemy
[32:17] against the Holy Ghost shall not be
[32:19] forgiven unto
[32:21] men they are in danger of Hellfire the
[32:24] Bible says them that would blaspheme the
[32:26] Holy Ghost it in this moment that a lot
[32:29] of people point out that Paul says he
[32:31] was a blasphemer that his blasphemy was
[32:33] of the Holy Ghost which Jesus said it
[32:35] shall not be forgiven unto men and Paul
[32:39] yet asserts that me as a blasphemer as a
[32:41] persecutor as one who harmed the body of
[32:44] Christ and breathed out threatenings and
[32:45] actually murdered Stephen and these this
[32:48] blood is on my hand and I'm guilty of
[32:50] the blood of the CH children of God I
[32:52] did so ignorantly and obtained Mercy
[32:56] that I might be an example to
[32:59] others so as we continue to read his
[33:01] testimony in this moment of Contrition
[33:04] who are you what should I do tells him
[33:06] to go arise and go to Damascus and I'll
[33:09] show you what to do verse 7 and the men
[33:11] which journeyed with him stood
[33:12] speechless hearing a voice but see no
[33:15] man and Saul arose from the earth and
[33:17] when his eyes were open he saw no man
[33:19] but they led him by the hand so he's
[33:20] blind even though he could physically
[33:22] open his eyes and all were still there
[33:24] he could not see but they led him by the
[33:27] hand and brought him into Damascus and
[33:29] he was three days without sight and
[33:31] neither did eat nor drink and there was
[33:33] a certain disciple at Damascus named
[33:35] ananas and to him said the Lord in a
[33:37] vision ananas he said behold I'm here
[33:41] Lord so there's a is he says ananas
[33:44] calls him ananas recognizes it to God
[33:47] behold I'm here Lord and the Lord said
[33:49] unto him arise and go into the street
[33:51] which is called straight and inquire in
[33:54] the house of Judas for one called Saul
[33:56] of Tarsus for behold he prayeth so Paul
[33:59] is praying he's seeking L he's
[34:01] responsive to he he's uh pouring his
[34:05] heart out to God because he's in this Mo
[34:07] state of Contrition knowing that God's
[34:10] revealed himself and Paul hath seen in a
[34:12] vision a man named ananas coming in and
[34:15] putting his hand on him that he might
[34:17] receive his
[34:18] sight then ananas answered Lord I have
[34:22] heard by many of this man how much evil
[34:25] he hath done to thy Saints at Jerusalem
[34:28] now I guess I could make a lot of jokes
[34:29] here and try to put it modern language
[34:32] but he's saying Paul Saul of Tarsus has
[34:35] been murdering disciples and you want
[34:38] me to show up as a disciple and say yeah
[34:42] uh I'm a
[34:44] Christian and he's and God says and so
[34:47] he says here here he is he knows he's
[34:49] heard and here he hath Authority from
[34:51] the chief priest to bind all that call
[34:53] on thy
[34:54] name so here's that that role of black
[34:57] blasphemy and this this uh this those
[35:00] that blaspheme the name of the Lord
[35:01] we're going to put him to death we're
[35:02] going to Stone him he said he's got
[35:04] papers to do that I would be one that's
[35:06] guilty but the Lord said unto him verse
[35:08] 15 go thy way for he is a chosen vessel
[35:11] unto me to Bear my name before the
[35:13] Gentiles and Kings and the children of
[35:15] Israel for I will show him how great
[35:17] things he must suffer for my name's sake
[35:21] and ananias went his way and entered
[35:23] into the house and putting his hands on
[35:25] him said brother Saul Wow Wow for ananas
[35:31] to be able to do that I don't know what
[35:34] he had to
[35:35] overcome I don't know if ananas ananas
[35:38] has some pretty good details about what
[35:39] he's done to the Saints at Jerusalem and
[35:41] knew enough that he was there with
[35:42] papers to take care of them could have
[35:44] ananas L lost loved ones could he
[35:47] suffered great harm and when it goes he
[35:50] doesn't extend his hand and be like well
[35:52] Mr Tarsus right he says brother Saul the
[35:57] Lord Lord even Jesus that appeared unto
[35:59] thee in the way as thou camest so he
[36:01] knows he's speaking what the Lord has
[36:02] showed him has sent
[36:05] me that thou mightest receive thy sight
[36:08] and be filled with the Holy
[36:10] Ghost now I want you to imagine this
[36:12] Paul the Apostle Paul I could kind of
[36:15] get lost in this particular reading
[36:17] right here but I really want you to
[36:18] catch this here's Paul that God's going
[36:20] to use before Kings before Gentiles to
[36:23] the children of Israel and he's going to
[36:25] show them things to come he doesn't give
[36:27] him the Holy Ghost on the road to or on
[36:29] the road to Damascus doesn't give it to
[36:31] him then he blinds him doesn't fill with
[36:34] the Holy Ghost then he says what I'm
[36:35] going to do is I'm going to have ananas
[36:36] come from the those one that is in the
[36:39] way one that you would have killed or
[36:41] dragged to Jerusalem and soon murdered
[36:43] and stone I'm going to have him come and
[36:45] lay his hands on you and speak the word
[36:47] to you that you might receive your sight
[36:49] I have come at his request to pray for
[36:52] you that you might be filled with the
[36:54] Holy Ghost verse 18 and immediately
[36:57] there fell from his eyes as it had been
[36:58] scales and he received sight for withth
[37:01] and arose and was baptized in the name
[37:04] of Jesus and when he had received meat
[37:07] he was strengthened then was Saul
[37:09] certain days with the disciples which
[37:11] were at
[37:11] Damascus man I can't wait to hear the
[37:14] stories in straight way he preached
[37:17] Christ in the synagogues he shot up in
[37:20] Damascus to go to the synagogues with
[37:22] papers to murder them all he was going
[37:24] to judge them going to drag them all
[37:27] back to Jerusalem to have him stoned and
[37:30] he shows up and he's going to reveal the
[37:33] new
[37:34] Shalom the new place of Peace the real
[37:38] king of kings he's going to preach to
[37:40] him Christ right there in the very same
[37:42] synagogues where he would have brought
[37:43] papers of condemnation he's now
[37:45] preaching Christ the son of God but all
[37:48] that heard him were amazed and
[37:51] said is this not he that destroyed them
[37:53] which called on his name in Jerusalem
[37:56] and came hither for that intent that he
[37:58] might bring forth them bound to the
[37:59] chief of priest I just think of that
[38:01] Meme with that kid holding holding that
[38:03] styrofoam Kip like he kind of overhears
[38:06] it he's like they know yeah they knew
[38:10] here he was this is the one that
[38:12] destroyed them which called on his name
[38:13] in Jerusalem who called us blasphemers
[38:16] and he came to Damascus that he might
[38:19] bring us bound back to Jerusalem
[38:21] ultimately to Stone us and now he's
[38:24] preaching
[38:25] Christ yeah certainly this is is a ruse
[38:28] right he's trolling us right if we say
[38:30] Amen does that mean he that's how he
[38:32] finds us
[38:33] out like if we agree he's like Jesus is
[38:37] the Christ and we're
[38:41] like if we say anything like don't say
[38:44] anything this is a
[38:46] trick I mean we really do need to get
[38:48] ourselves in our their shoes about how
[38:50] peculiar this would be They're All
[38:52] Amazed isn't this the one that was going
[38:53] to murder us has he not murdered before
[38:56] but Saul and increase the more in
[38:58] strength and confounder the Jews which
[39:01] dwelt dwelt at Damascus proving that
[39:03] this is very Christ this is very
[39:07] Christ
[39:11] my if I could say it this way when Paul
[39:14] excuse me when God or Christ made
[39:16] himself known to Paul Mercy was
[39:19] extended right in that very moment he
[39:21] was a murderer he was a blasphemer and
[39:23] he would have done
[39:25] more but God shows up what' he do he
[39:28] told him go to Damascus and he gave
[39:30] Paul's praying now as he's in Damascus
[39:32] and God gives him a vision of what to do
[39:34] next and what did God say I'm going to
[39:36] send you ananas and this is what he's
[39:38] going to do and what I what we can take
[39:40] from this and I believe this is absolute
[39:42] solid that we could take
[39:44] this and I I imagine brother elzer you
[39:47] could just see this so plain that God
[39:49] Saul is O obeying go to Damascus where
[39:53] did he go he went straight to Damascus
[39:55] and now he's praying because he's going
[39:56] to be shown what to do next
[39:57] I'll show you what to do so he's praying
[39:59] Lord show me and God shows them ananas
[40:01] is going to come and you let him pray
[40:02] for you and you let him baptize you and
[40:04] you call on the name of the Lord and you
[40:06] repent and these are the things that's
[40:07] going to happen and Paul was obeying the
[40:09] revealed word at every
[40:11] opportunity and where did he find Mercy
[40:16] in Jesus in the very body that he was
[40:19] persecuting in the very one that he
[40:22] would have put to death that's where he
[40:23] found the mercy because God didn't
[40:25] necessarily Grant it to him there when
[40:27] when the light overshadowed him and men
[40:28] were hearing voices and Paul is struck
[40:30] blind but he had to send ananas who had
[40:32] the spirit in him whom God had been
[40:34] communing with and ananas is the one
[40:36] that extends this Mercy to Paul God had
[40:38] to have somebody there to give Paul the
[40:41] opportunity and the reason why we still
[40:43] read of Paul in the manner that we do
[40:44] because Paul in his state in his broken
[40:47] State and in whatever character he had
[40:49] in him at the time to accept
[40:51] it and listen there's a lot a lot of
[40:54] people who would be lesser men to Double
[40:56] Down on their persecution double down on
[40:59] their platitudes double down on their
[41:01] religious exercises double down on their
[41:03] pretense and continue to defame and
[41:06] blaspheme the message of the hour by
[41:08] preaching false Doctrine and pedling
[41:10] their own self-righteousness but Paul in
[41:12] that moment was
[41:13] broken he said what do I need to
[41:16] do and he said go have this this one
[41:19] who's in the way because he's the way
[41:22] that you can receive Mercy
[41:27] and then
[41:29] God did this Acts chapter n so that we
[41:33] could understand how God's mercy Works
[41:38] how that we obtained Mercy even in a
[41:40] time in a moment where it seems God's
[41:42] commanding men everywhere to repent
[41:44] ignorance was an excuse until
[41:47] now up until this moment this worked but
[41:51] now that this has happened God's Mercy
[41:53] is available but only as he offers it
[41:59] and brother brandham says in the sermon
[42:00] The God Who is rich in Mercy now that's
[42:02] the only way to obtain Mercy is to
[42:04] follow the instructions that God has
[42:06] give us to follow in brother John I
[42:08] think it's there and the next all these
[42:10] quotes I'm going to be using all come
[42:12] from uh I hope I did put it in there God
[42:14] rich in Mercy now that's the only way to
[42:18] obtain maybe I didn't put this one in
[42:20] there that's the only way to obtain
[42:21] Mercy is to follow the instructions that
[42:25] God has given us to follow in
[42:28] that's the only way he can show Mercy is
[42:30] when we follow what he said
[42:33] do think of this now if I could say
[42:36] anything brother brandham is established
[42:39] in this not that we would go back and do
[42:40] an autopsy on ages past not that we
[42:42] would try to figure it out while in the
[42:44] days of Hezekiah no we just want to look
[42:46] at it right now in our time the only way
[42:48] to obtain Mercy is to follow the
[42:49] instructions that God gives us to follow
[42:52] Paul did exactly that Paul was right up
[42:55] to a very moment up to a Time time when
[42:58] Jerusalem ceased and now Paul is
[43:00] continuing in this old way continuing
[43:02] under the law he's one of these zealots
[43:04] who would have been recognized as
[43:05] someone who is very zealous for the
[43:06] cause of Yahweh whom Jehovah would shine
[43:09] his favor upon Israel because you stood
[43:11] for righteousness and you you Stone
[43:13] Those blasphemers and you hold it held
[43:15] tight to the law but now God reveals
[43:17] himself to Paul and Paul needs to follow
[43:20] the instructions that God gives and
[43:21] that's why Paul obtained
[43:24] Mercy brother B said God is rich in
[43:26] Mercy Mercy to those who will follow
[43:28] after him not after a Creed but after
[43:31] God brother Bron preached this in
[43:34] 1965 and I believe it was necessary for
[43:37] him to be able to emphasize where this
[43:39] place of Mercy
[43:41] is I don't think he would take back
[43:44] anything he had preached to that point
[43:45] after those seals are opened wouldn't
[43:47] water down any of it as a matter of fact
[43:49] he continues to reinforce to reinforce
[43:52] and to make clear and make clear these
[43:53] events that have transpired and how
[43:55] serious they are not that we would get
[43:57] mysterious about it mystical and weird
[43:59] but this is just the reality this is the
[44:01] way it is and now he's pointing us to
[44:03] God's
[44:05] instructions I think this one's there it
[44:07] says and the whole human race would have
[44:08] been wiped out at that
[44:11] time but God rich in
[44:15] Mercy he's talking about in the days of
[44:18] Noah God rich in Mercy would not let the
[44:20] innocent perish with the
[44:21] guilty okay now how does that work and
[44:25] he went away and made a provided way for
[44:27] the ones that wanted to come in that
[44:29] wanted to do what was right he made a
[44:32] way of Mercy for those who desired mercy
[44:34] and he prepared an
[44:38] ark Moses was a witness excuse me Noah
[44:41] was a witness and a testimony he gets to
[44:42] Moses here in a minute what was he
[44:45] testifying judgment's coming here's a
[44:47] way
[44:47] out remember he talks about them being
[44:50] locked in that Ark God shuts the door as
[44:52] the raindrops fall and there it sits for
[44:55] a moment as a witness to them before
[44:56] they're over overcome by
[44:58] judgment he he said in other words he
[45:01] put some wings on his Eagles that they
[45:03] could fly above the judgment and not
[45:05] drown with the chickens but he made a
[45:07] way of Escape in the days of
[45:10] Noah as it was in the days of Noah this
[45:13] caused him to do that to provide it
[45:15] because he was rich in Mercy notice that
[45:19] God being rich in Mercy doesn't mean wow
[45:21] the imagination of men is only evil
[45:23] continually and their sins have reached
[45:24] under heaven and his imagination is just
[45:28] filthy and ungodly
[45:30] and but I'm just so full of Mercy carry
[45:36] on there came a time when he said no
[45:38] enough's enough un lest I cause all the
[45:41] innocent to perish with the guilty I'll
[45:43] give him
[45:44] witness he continues later he says he
[45:46] made a provision for those who wants to
[45:48] be redeemed he made a provision for
[45:50] those who wants to be healed and that
[45:53] because that he did this makes him rich
[45:55] in Mercy as he has always been rich in
[45:57] Mercy it must be if you refuse this
[46:01] there's nothing left but the Judgment
[46:03] because sin must be judged I believe
[46:07] that's the phrase that we could really
[46:08] zero in on if you refuse
[46:11] this God is rich in Mercy he's always
[46:15] been rich in Mercy but now God provides
[46:17] a way and the only way to obtain the
[46:19] mercy that he's rich in the only way to
[46:22] obtain the mercy that he wants to
[46:23] abundantly Supply is to follow the
[46:25] provided way to obtain the
[46:29] mercy brother bradam says this and today
[46:32] friend the only way that we can ever
[46:34] have favor with God God is rich in Mercy
[46:37] today but we've got to respect what he
[46:40] said about it you can't take what
[46:43] somebody else said you got to take what
[46:45] God said he said let every words be
[46:47] every man's word be a lie and mine true
[46:50] today we're told all you have to do in
[46:52] many places is join church have a Creed
[46:54] and something like that or say a prayer
[46:56] or put your name on a book or be
[46:57] sprinkled or baptized a certain way or
[46:59] something like that that's all you have
[47:01] to
[47:02] do but that's
[47:04] wrong I love this part because that
[47:07] sentence just could have kept going on
[47:08] and on and on in that same
[47:11] accent to be an eagle of God you've got
[47:14] to follow the word day by day you've got
[47:17] to continue feed upon the
[47:21] word as we walk in the light as he is in
[47:24] the light we have Fellowship one with
[47:27] and the blood of Jesus Christ his son
[47:28] cleanses us from all unrighteousness
[47:30] it's only under that bleeding bloody
[47:33] word it's only under that dripping word
[47:36] that word which is being crucified again
[47:38] in this hour it's only under that light
[47:41] am that we continue to have this
[47:44] fellowship and it says you're an eagle
[47:46] if you continue to feed upon that
[47:49] word that seems to maybe nail it down
[47:53] pretty tight what the standard is and
[47:54] say well what if I make a mistake well
[47:56] just get up up keep walking in the light
[47:58] Don't Turn back don't forsake it don't
[48:00] give
[48:02] up God is rich in Mercy today but we've
[48:05] got to respect what he said amen just
[48:07] pulling some of these things together
[48:08] and I could emphasize this in place
[48:10] after place after place after place and
[48:12] we maybe will'll get to it in the
[48:13] scripture on Sunday how that God's Mercy
[48:16] is available to those who fear Him God's
[48:20] Mercy is renewed and it's granted and it
[48:23] covers those who keep his
[48:25] Commandments and that's this Mercy is
[48:28] available but Mercy isn't going to be
[48:31] available to the one who continues to
[48:33] refuse and to reject truth the one who
[48:36] continues to refuse Mercy when it looks
[48:38] him in the
[48:41] face let me use this statement in
[48:44] closing he says God is the word and it
[48:47] was made flesh and dwelt Among Us now
[48:50] that he might bring forth the other
[48:52] attributes of
[48:54] God take time to listen to this sermon
[48:57] The God Who is rich in Mercy listen to
[48:58] it coming up on an anniversary of it 60
[49:00] years next month or excuse me in January
[49:02] next year and I just think I've just
[49:05] been going through it so full so full of
[49:09] beautiful
[49:10] statements and he says the body Jesus
[49:12] was the body of God an attribute so
[49:14] Jesus was an attribute of God uh and and
[49:18] he is set forth to to bring forth these
[49:21] other attributes and then he says Moses
[49:23] seen him pass the back part of him no
[49:26] man had seen his his face but now we see
[49:28] him we have beheld him see him as the
[49:30] sacrifice now he was an attribute of God
[49:33] being displayed the
[49:35] word that's what he
[49:37] was now if we could keep in our minds
[49:39] the image of Acts chapter n and when any
[49:42] believer comes to God he becomes God's
[49:45] attributes attribute of his word he's
[49:48] used to manifest the word that's
[49:50] promised for that
[49:52] day that's right God rich in Mercy has
[49:55] never left left us without a testimony
[49:58] he's rich in Mercy and brother brandham
[50:01] in the sermon talks about how Moses was
[50:03] a testimony of righteousness Noah was a
[50:05] testimony God never left us left us
[50:07] without a testimony and here's Paul who
[50:10] is a blasphemer a murderer he was one
[50:12] that should have known better as
[50:14] touching the law blameless and was out
[50:16] to kill more Christians and what did God
[50:18] do he sent him ananas as a bear of God's
[50:22] mercy Paul under his own convictions had
[50:26] blasted fed the name of God and should
[50:28] have been subject to the punishment he
[50:30] carried out on
[50:32] Stephen but God rich in Mercy didn't
[50:35] leave him without a
[50:36] testimony and he used ananas to manifest
[50:39] the word that was promised for that day
[50:41] and he does it yet the same
[50:44] today there must be a voice and a
[50:46] witness and a testimony of Mercy in this
[50:50] hour even to those who are ignorantly
[50:53] worshiping I I'm hold I've been holding
[50:55] back this statement but just keeps
[50:57] pressing in my heart as I as I preach
[50:58] brother Brown when he preaches the
[50:59] revelation of Jesus Christ which is a
[51:02] church a series when he preaches he says
[51:04] there's an hour coming when you're
[51:05] sincerely
[51:06] wrong in other words you're sincere
[51:09] you're sincere but there's an hour
[51:10] coming when your sincerity will no
[51:13] longer count on and all this sincerity
[51:16] and all this effort and all the
[51:18] platitudes and everything you're doing
[51:19] God may be uh in it now and God may be
[51:22] blessed in it now and God may bring
[51:24] forth fruits out of it now and God may
[51:25] be able to meet you where wherever you
[51:26] are in these things now but there's
[51:28] going to become a time when your
[51:29] sincerity no longer matters and you're
[51:31] wrong and you've got to repent you've
[51:33] got to come out You' got to accept the
[51:35] truth you can't accept the Fable of what
[51:37] they've made Jesus Christ
[51:40] into and this applies to all not just
[51:44] those who don't believe the message
[51:46] because there's a lot of message
[51:46] Believers who've turned it into fables
[51:49] just the same
[51:52] amen I'm so glad he's rich in
[51:55] Mercy in Matthew 12:31 we read it a
[51:58] moment ago wherefore I say unto you all
[51:59] manner of sin and blasphemy shall be
[52:00] forgiven unto men but the blasphemy
[52:03] against the Holy Ghost shall not be
[52:04] forgiven unto men just going pushing a
[52:07] little bit further tonight because we
[52:09] have the time not going to be much
[52:10] longer at
[52:11] all but this blaspheming the Holy Ghost
[52:16] is the
[52:18] unpardonable and it's always been
[52:19] debated and I think within the Catholic
[52:21] Church they have different well suicide
[52:23] is the unpardonable sin there's
[52:25] different things you can do that if you
[52:27] terminate a life these things that you
[52:29] can never be forgiven or if you pay
[52:30] enough money maybe it can be but brother
[52:32] B said what is the unpardonable sin to
[52:34] reject truth when it's presented to
[52:36] you why because if you reject truth you
[52:39] reject Mercy because truth doesn't
[52:42] say Rowan you never did anything wrong
[52:45] ever you're fine you're okay you don't
[52:47] need to change a thing that's not how it
[52:49] works the truth says all men have sinned
[52:52] and come short of the glory of God the
[52:54] truth said that God's a just God
[52:57] that the truth begins to tell us as Paul
[52:59] did let me declare unto you the truth
[53:01] this God whom you've been ignorantly
[53:02] worshiping let me now remove your
[53:05] ignorance and make you accountable and
[53:06] now you're going to have to make a
[53:07] decision so the unpardonable sin it just
[53:09] to me makes so much sense to reject
[53:11] truth when it's presented to you he said
[53:13] you'll fight your way to Hell says it's
[53:16] not easy to go to hell you have to
[53:18] reject truth as they sang on Sunday
[53:21] there is a cross in the way full of
[53:23] Mercy full of Truth full of grace and
[53:26] most people want Mercy apart from truth
[53:29] they want Mercy apart from righteousness
[53:32] yeah they can say I don't want God's
[53:33] justice I want his Mercy but they don't
[53:35] want any of his
[53:37] truth and so that where there is freedom
[53:40] where there is Liberty from bondage
[53:42] where there's an appeasing uh God's
[53:44] Wrath is in the truth Jesus said You
[53:46] shall know the truth and the truth shall
[53:49] make you
[53:51] free Brothers Adam said God rich in
[53:54] Mercy has pulled us out of that chaos
[53:56] and let us see it before the thing hits
[53:58] here before the Judgment hits he lets us
[54:01] see the chaos of Babylon he lets us see
[54:03] the chaos of organized religion he lets
[54:05] us see the chaos of false Doctrine human
[54:08] Traditions lies and dishonesty he pulls
[54:12] us out of the chaos before it hits
[54:16] us and if you want to take time to go
[54:18] through the message of the hour to find
[54:19] these things that brother BR begins to
[54:20] emphasize he emphasizes the these things
[54:23] to support this this truth that Mercy
[54:25] can be found there's mercy found but
[54:27] it's in his instructions it's in God's
[54:29] only provided place of worship it's in
[54:32] it's in the in the token it's in these
[54:34] different things he begins to point us
[54:35] to Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[54:37] and forever who's revealing himself and
[54:39] he's preaches these things it is the
[54:40] rising of the sun who is this mezic he
[54:43] begins to preach sermons to get us to
[54:44] recognize this is where God is revealing
[54:47] himself Sauls of tarus recognize now
[54:50] what you need to do to recognize God
[54:52] who's stopping you on your on Damascus
[54:54] he's shining his light to you he's
[54:56] revealing himself to you he says he that
[54:59] believes not the full word of God is a
[55:01] sinner and we know according to the the
[55:03] word of God that the full word of God is
[55:04] Born Into manifestation this is why it
[55:07] meant so much to brother Bram even when
[55:08] he's preaching souls in prison now he
[55:10] says that the truth is presented to us
[55:13] through the opening of the word says
[55:15] it's opened up the entire
[55:18] Bible that what he tells us and he says
[55:21] in souls in prison I he says when the
[55:23] truth is presented to a person for the
[55:24] last time and they refuse to rece
[55:26] receive it according to the book of
[55:27] Hebrews there's not anything left in the
[55:29] world that can save them they're
[55:31] finished no repentance No Redemption
[55:33] there's nothing left for them and when
[55:35] truth of the Gospel has been proven
[55:37] thoroughly Vindicated and turn around
[55:38] and walk away from it they're finished
[55:40] he says it's awful but I have to tell
[55:44] it now you can put all sorts of spin on
[55:47] it you can say well if you don't accept
[55:49] the truth that William brandom's coming
[55:50] back in an
[55:51] airplane then you're lost and you're
[55:53] finished well okay
[55:57] and if he doesn't are you lost and are
[56:00] you finished and he say yep and say man
[56:03] I would trust in a shed blood of Jesus
[56:05] Christ more than I would a rickety old
[56:08] aircraft yes I'm going to I'm going to
[56:10] hold to the word which he promised I'm
[56:11] going to hold to the word which has been
[56:13] revealed I'm going to take it into my
[56:15] bosom and I'm going to hold to it I'm
[56:16] going to cling to this Jesus Christ
[56:18] that's been revealed to me I'm going to
[56:19] get away from the scarecrows that that
[56:21] try to make it blasphemy to believe in
[56:23] Jesus Christ they make it blasphemy to
[56:25] hold to the the blood of Jesus Christ to
[56:27] look into the word of God and recognize
[56:29] the things that are happening in this
[56:30] day listen there's a lot of people that
[56:32] have used this own personal gain and
[56:35] benefit at the cost of people's lives
[56:37] and their and their their tenderness and
[56:40] their virtue and they stand today as
[56:43] scarecrows to Jesus
[56:45] Christ the the the things that have been
[56:48] committed by the Catholic Church the
[56:49] things that have been committed by
[56:50] Mormonism and the names of all sorts of
[56:52] prophets have been used by filthy
[56:54] perverted ungodly men to build their own
[56:56] kingdoms and persecute and Destroy and
[56:59] harm people who've been sincere yes
[57:02] exactly and it's caused people to run
[57:04] away and flee from things naming Jesus
[57:07] Christ or naming and teaching things
[57:09] that pertain to the scripture or things
[57:11] associated to the ministry of William
[57:12] brandom and I believe there's got to be
[57:13] a voice of Mercy in this hour that's not
[57:16] identified with the defilers that's not
[57:18] identified with the false prophets that
[57:20] doesn't attach itself to some name but
[57:22] comes back and says yes Jesus Christ the
[57:24] same yesterday today forever am amen
[57:28] believes in
[57:29] Redemption believes in the purity of the
[57:32] Gospel yes believes in R religion pure
[57:36] and
[57:38] undefiled that would believe that these
[57:40] things in their
[57:42] purity come to a place where we will
[57:45] Express the character and nature of
[57:49] God out of a pure
[57:53] heart an unpretentious love
[57:56] a clear
[58:00] conscience God help us I I I I just I
[58:04] just I'll just say it and I I I'm not
[58:07] saying this as a clickbait title to
[58:08] shock you but it's controversial in some
[58:11] circles to say Mercy's in the
[58:14] bride brother BR said the mercy seats in
[58:16] your
[58:17] heart he goes into great detail these
[58:19] are the very things I've been tracking
[58:20] the very things I've been trying to find
[58:21] a way to bring it out so we could see
[58:23] that these things are scriptural and
[58:25] what is what is say now he's put up a
[58:27] scarecrow puts up a scarecrow to it so
[58:30] we'll keep our mouth shut and think that
[58:32] we can have ceremony and we could have
[58:34] hands and all sorts of things that we do
[58:36] and God doesn't need our hands he wants
[58:38] our hearts if there's going to be a
[58:40] place of Mercy it's going to have to
[58:41] come from a pure heart and I believe I
[58:43] believe that we could say that there's
[58:45] things fulfilled in this hour that are a
[58:46] paradox and it sure looks like the lamb
[58:49] has come forward to take the book and
[58:51] loose the seals thereof and because he's
[58:53] done that some day of Mercy is over but
[58:55] as look into the word of God the prophet
[58:57] saying don't say there's no more Mercy
[58:59] yeah that day may be passed but I say
[59:02] there's still Mercy because I'm going to
[59:04] stand in this hour and I'm going to have
[59:05] a heart that sze and cries and I'll say
[59:08] Lord be merciful to The Sinner be
[59:10] merciful to The Backs slatter be
[59:12] merciful to those who need healing be
[59:14] merciful to those who need salvation and
[59:17] let my voice be a voice of
[59:19] Mercy amen and not just to those who are
[59:22] out there far from us but those the
[59:24] closest to me yes amen amen that I
[59:27] wouldn't just exhibit a a yo-yo of Mercy
[59:31] but I could find some way to be merciful
[59:33] to my children that don't yet have the
[59:35] Holy Ghost can't yet discern truth don't
[59:38] know how to live stable lives and their
[59:39] hones are out of control God helped me
[59:42] to be under
[59:44] Mercy we need it more than
[59:47] ever there's things that our children
[59:49] will battle their circumstances they
[59:51] might find themselves in that there was
[59:53] a day and age that if that cropped up in
[59:54] a church just kick them out right take
[59:56] people and beat them out behind a
[59:58] Woodshed people in the name of the
[59:59] message blooded their fist on young men
[1:00:02] who got caught doing certain things that
[1:00:04] wasn't Mercy that's right it was it was
[1:00:07] the blasphemy that Paul was guilty of
[1:00:09] but there's many that cannot claim
[1:00:13] ignorance God help us to not be guilty
[1:00:17] of the sins of Prior
[1:00:19] generations and stand for the
[1:00:21] righteousness of the word of
[1:00:24] God and take Jesus Christ into our bosom
[1:00:27] believe it with all that is in us and be
[1:00:30] a Place full of Mercy let's pray
[1:00:33] musicians come gracious Heavenly
[1:00:35] Father Lord I plead I plead for myself
[1:00:39] that you'd be merciful to me
[1:00:42] Lord I've I've made
[1:00:45] mistakes L growing up in a time when a
[1:00:48] lot of these things maybe weren't
[1:00:50] understood and people did the best they
[1:00:53] could and I've seen the Apostle worship
[1:00:55] I've seen the man worship I've been
[1:00:57] slapped in the face by men who called
[1:00:59] themselves
[1:01:00] Apostles I've been beaten Lord by those
[1:01:04] who named this
[1:01:06] message Lord there's scars and things in
[1:01:09] my past that have been buried that I
[1:01:11] probably don't even
[1:01:12] remember they carry in me the
[1:01:15] trauma
[1:01:17] Lord of Truth handled in
[1:01:21] unrighteousness but Lord I will not be
[1:01:23] used as an instrument to cry out against
[1:01:25] your mercy amen and I will not be used
[1:01:28] as an instrument of
[1:01:30] judgment but would softened my
[1:01:33] heart that I could cry all the more have
[1:01:36] mercy on them for they know not what
[1:01:37] they
[1:01:40] do and Lord I pray that you help us in
[1:01:43] this end time it's confusing time it's a
[1:01:46] lost
[1:01:48] time and Lord we hear voices and yet
[1:01:50] we'll hear them the
[1:01:52] more that this word is cultish it's
[1:01:55] abusive it's
[1:01:57] Sinister it's
[1:01:59] [Music]
[1:02:01] fleecing and
[1:02:04] Lord If we're honest with
[1:02:07] ourselves we can't say that that hasn't
[1:02:09] been done in the name of the message or
[1:02:11] in the name of William
[1:02:13] Bram but we have to answer for our
[1:02:15] hearts we have to answer for our
[1:02:17] Revelation our
[1:02:19] stand so Lord if we've done anything to
[1:02:21] profane this message if we brought any
[1:02:23] smut on it
[1:02:26] if we're not representing Christ
[1:02:28] well what can we do
[1:02:31] Lord show what show us what we must
[1:02:35] do Lord Heal us of our hurts and our
[1:02:39] complexes help us to not be
[1:02:42] instinctively angry or spiteful to those
[1:02:46] who cast down what we believe in and
[1:02:49] speak horribly of the things that we
[1:02:51] find precious but may
[1:02:53] we understand where one might be coming
[1:02:55] from and recognize
[1:02:58] that people with experiences that are
[1:03:01] very very
[1:03:03] real people who've traveled down paths
[1:03:05] that many of us will never know
[1:03:07] of they need Mercy just as much as we
[1:03:10] have received
[1:03:12] Mercy some may act today in a manner
[1:03:15] which is
[1:03:16] Blasphemous
[1:03:18] injures and
[1:03:22] persecuting and perhaps Lord they do it
[1:03:24] ignorantly
[1:03:27] that they might obtain Mercy Lord is
[1:03:29] what we would
[1:03:30] pray I believe there's coming a time
[1:03:32] when there will be no more no more voice
[1:03:35] no more
[1:03:37] truth there bit time as brother Brandon
[1:03:40] would say when that Rapture goes and
[1:03:44] when that Rapture takes us
[1:03:46] into another dimension in a changed body
[1:03:50] theophany to glorify it a meeting in the
[1:03:53] air it's sealed forever Lord
[1:03:57] the testimony of what they did and what
[1:03:59] they said how they acted and their
[1:04:02] attitude some having sealed their
[1:04:05] testimony with blood will find
[1:04:06] themselves on that day of
[1:04:07] judgment re receiving eternal
[1:04:18] life keep the door open
[1:04:22] Lord if it be but for just a few more
[1:04:25] days
[1:04:27] father help us to find lost
[1:04:31] souls help us Lord to empathize with
[1:04:34] others who are
[1:04:41] hurting may we not be hard-hearted and
[1:04:44] indignant and allow a righteous
[1:04:47] indignation to well up inside of us but
[1:04:51] just as brother brandham Cried Out Lord
[1:04:54] show us how to reach them show knows
[1:04:55] what to do and the right things to
[1:04:58] say I want to minister Grace not a Grace
[1:05:01] a brandom Grace or a tabernacle Grace
[1:05:05] Lord I want to be able to
[1:05:06] minister the grace of Jesus
[1:05:09] Christ I want to I want to be an
[1:05:13] ananas who could find that one who finds
[1:05:15] himself strick and blind now and is
[1:05:17] pleading oh God what must I do what must
[1:05:19] I
[1:05:21] do and be one that can be the Hands of
[1:05:25] Christ
[1:05:27] who prays and the scales fall from their
[1:05:29] eyes and they see you as you
[1:05:32] are and they receive the Holy Ghost yes
[1:05:36] I know that you're alive and well Lord I
[1:05:37] won't water it down I believe that Mercy
[1:05:40] exist today through Jesus
[1:05:43] Christ I believe that the blood is still
[1:05:47] effective but I do believe Lord that
[1:05:51] there'll come a time when people will
[1:05:52] reject
[1:05:53] you they'll reject you you and once
[1:05:57] they've rejected truth there's nothing
[1:05:59] left but
[1:06:00] judgment so let us be voices of Truth
[1:06:03] Lord not that we would cause judgment to
[1:06:07] come but that it would find the redeemed
[1:06:10] that it would find a heart who's at
[1:06:11] least willing just to believe in you and
[1:06:13] accept
[1:06:14] you hold fast to a profession Lord I
[1:06:18] know that end time of evangelism isn't
[1:06:20] just the Harvest of people who want to
[1:06:21] accept you as their Savior and confess
[1:06:24] you and be BT in the name of Jesus
[1:06:26] Christ we we could do that a lot as a
[1:06:28] program I know that's not what end time
[1:06:31] evangelism is but while we're still here
[1:06:33] growing and feeding on the word of God
[1:06:35] use us for Divine Healing use us for for
[1:06:38] those to see you to receive you
[1:06:42] and perhaps we'll find a lost soul in a
[1:06:46] Lex seed in this gleaning
[1:06:49] time bless us tonight as our service is
[1:06:52] soon dismissed be with us in our worship
[1:06:55] go with those who've been here tonight
[1:06:57] the weariness of the week and the
[1:06:59] demands of tomorrow morning cling to us
[1:07:01] they're right here in our face so father
[1:07:03] be gracious as they've been patient
[1:07:04] tonight I ask all this in the name of
[1:07:06] the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen let's
[1:07:10] stand
