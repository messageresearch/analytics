[0:00] hebrews chapter 4 verses 9 to 16
[0:05] there remaineth therefore a rest to the
[0:08] people of god
[0:09] oh my in that wonderful just maybe just
[0:11] stop there and
[0:13] and just ponder how beautiful that is
[0:14] there remaineth therefore a rest to the
[0:16] people of god
[0:18] for he that is entered into his rest he
[0:20] also hath ceased from his own works as
[0:22] god did
[0:22] from his let us labor therefore to enter
[0:25] into that rest lest any man fall after
[0:27] the same example
[0:29] of unbelief and the example of unbelief
[0:31] would even be
[0:32] how their hearts were hardened uh the
[0:35] children of israel's hearts were
[0:36] hardened for the word of god is quick
[0:39] and powerful and sharper than any
[0:41] two-edged sword we want to identify this
[0:43] later if we
[0:44] if lord willing will get to this place
[0:47] in the sermon tonight how
[0:49] in talking about rest this is where this
[0:51] scripture is placed
[0:53] and we're all very familiar with hebrews
[0:54] 14 12. how excuse me 4 12 or the word of
[0:57] god is quick and powerful it's a
[0:58] discerner
[0:59] but notice the context is rest and it
[1:02] says for the word of god is quick and
[1:03] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[1:05] sword
[1:06] piercing even to the dividing asunder of
[1:08] soul and spirit and of the joints and
[1:10] marrow
[1:10] and as a discerner of the thoughts and
[1:12] intents of the heart
[1:13] neither is there any creature that is
[1:15] not manifest in his sight
[1:17] but all things are naked and opened
[1:19] under the eyes of him with whom
[1:20] we have to do sin then that we have a
[1:23] great high priest that is passed into
[1:25] the heavens
[1:26] jesus the son of god let us hold fast
[1:28] our profession
[1:30] if we have not a high priest which
[1:31] cannot be touched with the feelings
[1:33] of our infirmities but was in all points
[1:36] tempted like as we are
[1:37] yet without sin let us therefore come
[1:40] boldly
[1:41] unto the throne of grace that we may
[1:43] obtain mercy
[1:44] and find grace to help in the time of
[1:47] need
[1:47] that's just encouraging scripture
[1:49] reading we desire the lord would make it
[1:51] alive to us more tonight by revelation
[1:54] you can take your seats
[2:02] if you'll give me the liberty to do it
[2:04] i'm just going to jump into this without
[2:07] really any background or pointing out
[2:09] what's uh what's foundation
[2:11] and what we've gone over in the past i
[2:12] just want to jump into this
[2:14] but i will qualify by saying if you
[2:15] recognize some there's some familiar
[2:17] things
[2:18] if you agree with it that's your cue to
[2:19] a man
[2:21] so i'm not gonna maybe not gonna say
[2:23] this is what we said last time this week
[2:24] i just want to jump right into it
[2:25] because i want to get to a particular
[2:27] point tonight
[2:28] in james chapter 1 verse 5 the bible
[2:31] says
[2:32] speaking about wisdom and let me just
[2:34] say we're speaking
[2:35] on revelation resolves complication
[2:38] and wisdom from above so i do want to
[2:40] remind you we're on this subject of
[2:42] revelation resolving complication
[2:44] and a wisdom that god wants to give us
[2:46] from above so james says
[2:48] if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of
[2:50] god that giveth to all men
[2:52] liberally and abradeth not and it shall
[2:55] be given him
[2:56] this is a promise you can take to the
[2:58] bank god is saying
[3:00] james is saying if you lack wisdom then
[3:02] ask god for wisdom and he will give you
[3:04] even more than what you're asking
[3:06] and he won't chide you for it he won't
[3:08] upgrade you he won't rebuke you he won't
[3:10] say you
[3:11] full that's exactly what you need it's
[3:12] about time you figured it out
[3:14] he loves to grant wisdom and as we saw
[3:16] when god came to solomon in a dream and
[3:19] said you can have whatever you want
[3:20] solomon asked for and god said i've
[3:22] given it to you it's something that
[3:23] really pleased the lord
[3:25] and in the time that we're living in now
[3:27] we need to call upon god for revelation
[3:30] more than anything else and so wisdom
[3:33] i'm not separating wisdom as being
[3:35] something different
[3:36] from revelation revelation is divine
[3:38] communication it's
[3:39] knowledge it's wisdom it's understanding
[3:41] being communicated by god
[3:44] and though we could take each one of
[3:45] those words and maybe
[3:47] use them differently and apply them in
[3:48] different ways i want to kind of
[3:50] keep them all together that wisdom knows
[3:53] how to use the knowledge of god and that
[3:54] understanding gives us the ability to be
[3:56] wise in certain affairs and to be
[3:58] prudent and
[3:58] kind of looking at them as a whole that
[4:00] revelation imparts knowledge divine
[4:02] knowledge it imparts
[4:03] understanding it gives us it gives us
[4:06] wisdom
[4:06] and when james says if any of you lack
[4:09] wisdom then ask god for wisdom he's
[4:11] speaking of the word that this is formed
[4:13] from
[4:14] is from forming the best plans and using
[4:18] the best means for their execution
[4:20] that's what it means to be wise you can
[4:22] form the best plans
[4:23] and then also know and use the best
[4:26] means to execute those plans
[4:28] a lot of people can be idea guys you
[4:30] could come up with great ideas but lack
[4:32] the ability to execute
[4:33] many times successful startups are
[4:36] you know they're successful because the
[4:38] guy who comes up with the idea
[4:40] knows how to hand it off to the right
[4:41] person to execute and there's a lot of
[4:43] great ideas that
[4:44] that die in that infancy stage because
[4:47] the idea guy is not willing to let go
[4:49] and doesn't have the wisdom
[4:50] to see something through execution and
[4:52] so wisdom is
[4:54] the finding the best plan but then also
[4:56] the best means to fulfill or execute
[4:58] that plan
[5:00] and when we speak of wisdom from above
[5:02] this is the supreme intelligence
[5:04] from god and even in the bible when you
[5:06] would if you were to look up the
[5:07] definition of wisdom as it relates to
[5:09] god
[5:10] this is supreme intelligence and when we
[5:13] talk about supreme intelligence
[5:15] it's important that we're not talking
[5:16] about being super religious or super
[5:19] spiritual
[5:20] but i want you to think of it in terms
[5:22] of being practical knowledge
[5:24] we may think right now man if i had the
[5:26] mind of god to know everything then i'll
[5:28] know
[5:28] uh i'll know how to day trade or i'll
[5:30] know how to get in and out of bitcoin
[5:32] so that i don't suffer the ups and downs
[5:34] of cryptocurrency
[5:35] and you might think in your mind that's
[5:37] how you would want to utilize this
[5:38] supreme intelligence
[5:40] but as much as that might seem practical
[5:42] to you
[5:43] it would be even more practical than
[5:45] that and it wouldn't be some kind of
[5:47] supreme intelligence to know
[5:48] where we can line up to get the best
[5:50] deals and those things but something
[5:51] that would make sense in everyday life
[5:53] and not
[5:54] not like a superpower let's not think
[5:56] about divine intelligence being a
[5:58] superpower that uh
[5:59] superman would have or uh i almost said
[6:01] batman but i don't know if he even has
[6:02] any superpowers he just has a lot of
[6:04] toys
[6:05] and so this is something that is uh we
[6:08] can be very
[6:09] practical knowledge and it's
[6:12] knowledge the word wisdom as it relates
[6:14] to just the human knowledge that james
[6:16] is talking about says if you lack wisdom
[6:18] it's a
[6:18] it would be a skill it would be
[6:20] knowledge of both
[6:21] human things and even divine things so
[6:24] it's a to have wisdom it's knowledge of
[6:26] human things things that they relate to
[6:27] the human
[6:28] life but then also things that relate to
[6:30] the divine that you acquire
[6:32] through being very perceptive acuteness
[6:33] but also by experience
[6:35] this is what james has said if you lack
[6:36] something you can ask god to have an
[6:39] understanding of human things and divine
[6:41] things
[6:42] he says if any of you lack wisdom ask
[6:44] god this is what
[6:45] wisdom relates to it's the skill in
[6:47] managing affairs
[6:49] it speaks of being prudent or having
[6:50] discretion it's the knowledge of
[6:53] in practice of truth so when james says
[6:56] ask for wisdom it speaks of divine
[6:57] intelligence intelligence of human
[6:59] things
[7:00] even intelligence of things related to
[7:01] god things that would normally be
[7:03] acquired through experience
[7:05] or through yourself being perceptively
[7:06] saying you can actually ask
[7:08] god for this and he'll give it to you
[7:10] and
[7:11] solomon as we referenced a moment ago he
[7:14] asked god for
[7:15] an understanding heart that's the phrase
[7:17] that he uses he says i
[7:18] god give me an understanding heart too
[7:21] and this is the phrase
[7:22] to discern between good and bad
[7:25] so we we often reference uh solomon in
[7:28] terms of wisdom that what
[7:30] he asked for was wisdom and what he
[7:32] received his wisdom
[7:33] the scriptures identify it that way we
[7:35] as bible believers identified that what
[7:36] he asked for was wisdom
[7:38] and that's what he received and so this
[7:40] is godly wisdom if we want to ask god
[7:42] for wisdom or receive wisdom from above
[7:44] it's understanding to discern what is
[7:47] right
[7:48] to ask god for wisdom is to discern what
[7:50] is best
[7:51] and that's exactly what solomon asked
[7:53] for i i want to have an understanding
[7:55] heart to discern
[7:57] what is the best thing to do what is the
[7:58] proper thing to do to know he says he
[8:00] says to discern judgment it means to
[8:02] discern what's the right thing the
[8:04] righteous thing the thing that would be
[8:05] pleasing to the lord
[8:07] and so god gave him what i think the
[8:10] phrase i may have used last time was
[8:12] practical discernment this is something
[8:14] that can be useful
[8:15] not something that you can use at a
[8:16] party and say i can guess what number
[8:18] you're thinking about right now
[8:19] or tell somebody you know what they had
[8:21] eaten for breakfast that day
[8:23] there's just a way that we could think
[8:25] about discernment where it's just all
[8:26] about reading thoughts but if it's
[8:28] anything it's having the mind of god
[8:29] made known to you
[8:31] god was the one that had the knowledge
[8:32] of what a person's sickness was god was
[8:34] the one that knew what the doctor was
[8:35] telling somebody
[8:36] so when brother branham stood before a
[8:38] patient in a prayer line
[8:40] and he could tell them what was
[8:41] happening in their life it wasn't
[8:43] because he read a prayer card or was
[8:44] reading their thoughts it's because the
[8:46] thoughts of god
[8:47] was the knowledge of god of past present
[8:50] and future was being imparted to the
[8:52] prophet
[8:52] and so that we can accept that that
[8:55] dynamic is available to a man who's
[8:56] redeemed by the blood of jesus christ
[8:58] because it was demonstrated to us in the
[9:00] ministry of brother branham and that's
[9:02] what god can give us he can give us
[9:04] practical discernment and what solomon
[9:08] demonstrated is
[9:09] in his wisdom as we read in in kings is
[9:12] that he was not a child anymore because
[9:13] he says i'm a child
[9:15] and i know not how to go out or come in
[9:18] this is what the preface of solomon
[9:19] asking for wisdom is he acknowledged his
[9:22] own weaknesses when he says i'm
[9:23] i'm but a child i'm a child i know not
[9:25] how to go out or come in
[9:26] he's not talking about his age uh
[9:29] because he's believed to have been
[9:30] you know a full adult by the time that
[9:32] he asked this but he's talking about his
[9:34] knowledge and his understanding
[9:36] say my perception of things isn't fully
[9:38] developed my discernment of things
[9:40] isn't isn't is it mature it's not
[9:42] perfect i don't have enough experience
[9:43] in managing the affairs of a
[9:45] of a nation and a country and a people
[9:47] this great so this is because i'm a
[9:49] child
[9:50] and i don't know how to go out or come
[9:52] in give me wisdom
[9:54] and that phrase to go out or come in i
[9:55] believe joshua uses it about himself
[9:57] moses uses it about to this going out
[10:00] and coming in because it's an allusion
[10:01] to leadership
[10:02] it's actually an illusion to a shepherd
[10:05] who would go in and come out before the
[10:07] sheep
[10:07] and so he says i don't know how to go
[10:09] out or come in he's referring to
[10:10] leadership and headship and
[10:11] guidance and referring to how a shepherd
[10:14] ought to be with the with the
[10:15] congregation
[10:16] with the group of people with the nation
[10:17] he says i'm just gonna be honest god i
[10:19] may be the king and my name may be on
[10:21] the marquee
[10:22] but i really don't have the wisdom and
[10:24] the heart that a king should have for
[10:25] people so wonderful as this
[10:27] i don't know how to go out or come in
[10:29] and what a beautiful place to be before
[10:31] god
[10:31] were you willing to be humble and abase
[10:33] yourself and say lord i need help
[10:35] and solomon and having that kind of
[10:36] humility he's saying i don't know how to
[10:39] lead properly i don't know how to
[10:40] fulfill my duties and it's a phrase then
[10:42] that's used in the old testament to talk
[10:44] about one's fulfillment of the duty in
[10:46] the role that they're called to
[10:48] so he's addressing these particular
[10:50] things about himself
[10:51] i don't want to be a child anymore i
[10:53] want to have a understanding heart to
[10:55] discern and so the scriptures if you
[10:58] want to look at it scripturally
[11:00] scripturally the wisdom that solomon
[11:01] asked for
[11:02] was the ability to judge right or the
[11:05] ability to discern correctly
[11:08] to look at a situation and to understand
[11:10] it to look at a situation and be
[11:12] sensitive to all the things that will
[11:13] relate
[11:14] to it to where it's not just a knee-jerk
[11:16] reaction it's not just being legalistic
[11:17] about something
[11:18] but he could take a look at it and say
[11:20] all right this is the situation
[11:22] now on the surface this is what it might
[11:23] be um could you imagine if you
[11:25] if you were faced with two harlots
[11:27] arguing over a baby
[11:28] and i'm not i don't want to be rude to
[11:31] all of us but really with a lot of the
[11:33] uh religious spirits we have and we're
[11:35] all being included this if you don't
[11:37] agree you don't have to amen if you
[11:38] think it's true of me you can say man
[11:39] i'm fine with that
[11:40] but in our legalism and the way we judge
[11:43] things and how harsh we could be
[11:44] if two harlots came and stood before us
[11:46] and said an argument over baby you know
[11:48] what we'd probably say
[11:49] well it's your lifestyle you asked for
[11:52] it you probably know who the dad is why
[11:53] are you worried about who the mom is
[11:54] deal with it get over it figure this out
[11:56] you're a couple harlots
[11:58] this is what you asked for this is what
[12:00] you should did you expect to have
[12:01] anything different
[12:02] and we'd be so abrasive and so crude and
[12:04] so rude perhaps
[12:06] where solomon looks at it and doesn't
[12:07] judge him because of their lifestyle he
[12:09] doesn't judge him because of the
[12:10] mistakes that they made
[12:11] doesn't judge him because well these are
[12:12] two known harlots we know who they are
[12:14] they probably got what they asked for
[12:15] and joking around you know they probably
[12:16] don't know the daddy is little mom
[12:18] right he just said you know what i want
[12:21] to have wisdom god give me an
[12:22] understanding heart
[12:23] and his discernment was first expressed
[12:26] in its purity
[12:27] it was inoffensive though it was bring
[12:29] me a sword could be very grating
[12:31] but he used it in such a way to bring
[12:33] out the truth and so what he had and
[12:35] what he had received was the ability to
[12:37] discern correctly
[12:39] and it was more than just knowing the
[12:41] right thing to do
[12:42] but it was the way in which he
[12:43] administered the correctness the way
[12:44] that he addressed a particular situation
[12:47] to bring out the truth and achieve an
[12:49] equitable fair or righteous result
[12:51] and we're not lifting this up in the way
[12:53] that if well if i ever become a judge or
[12:55] if i ever become a king
[12:56] but you right now as kings and priests
[12:58] you right now as sons and daughters of
[13:00] god with whatever
[13:01] dominion you have i could say for rowan
[13:03] whatever you face as a young man
[13:05] you can ask god for wisdom to judge
[13:07] correctly
[13:08] wherever you are in your life you can
[13:10] ask god for the kind of wisdom
[13:11] that solomon was endued with and and so
[13:14] we're using this phrase discernment or
[13:16] to discern
[13:17] it means to distinguish or perceive
[13:19] differences so when you look at
[13:20] something it may present itself as one
[13:22] thing but you can recognize
[13:24] it's actually different than what it's
[13:25] presented itself itself as
[13:27] that if you're looking for something
[13:28] that's you're wanting to know if
[13:29] something's wrong
[13:30] but yet it's crying out to you i'm an
[13:32] angel of light this is the right thing
[13:34] this is the best thing
[13:35] discernment is able to realize no as
[13:37] close as it may look to right
[13:39] it's not right that's what discernment
[13:41] is it's sharp insight it's the
[13:43] perception
[13:44] of something very obscure have you ever
[13:47] and i think i've done a really good job
[13:49] the last few services of not mentioning
[13:50] food but i'm gonna whatever streak that
[13:52] was
[13:53] we're breaking it tonight have you ever
[13:57] read a food review from like a real food
[13:58] critic
[13:59] and you're like i want to write a review
[14:01] of this restaurant so you go on yelp
[14:02] you're like
[14:03] the food was really good you know and
[14:06] then you're like i need to
[14:07] i love the presentation it just doesn't
[14:08] come off but you read about somebody who
[14:10] knows to write about food you're like
[14:12] how do they think about food that way
[14:14] because they have an even more
[14:15] discerning palate you just taste good to
[14:17] you but they can actually tell you
[14:18] what's in it and how it tastes like this
[14:20] and how it tastes like that
[14:22] and p that just shows they have a
[14:23] different kind of perception and can
[14:25] recognize certain things a certain way
[14:27] say well then you shouldn't do that and
[14:28] you shouldn't do this
[14:29] and it all speaks to someone having
[14:30] discerning taste
[14:32] people can be like that when it comes to
[14:33] the way they dress they just have a
[14:34] different
[14:35] a way of taste and dress a different
[14:37] kind of discernment to know perception
[14:38] to know
[14:39] these colors don't go together you're
[14:40] not supposed to do this you're not
[14:42] supposed to do that
[14:43] and we attribute these kind of skills or
[14:45] gifts or talent sets or
[14:46] whatever ability we talk about even it
[14:48] being discerning so when it comes to us
[14:51] as being sons and daughters of god to
[14:52] have discernment it's the perception of
[14:55] something that may not be obvious to
[14:56] everyone else
[14:58] and so if god gives you discernment on
[14:59] something you have to realize i'm
[15:01] standing on something that god has given
[15:03] me
[15:03] a discernment that god has given me even
[15:05] if nobody else recognizes it really
[15:07] god has given me this kind of
[15:08] discernment to realize no this is this
[15:10] is really what's happening
[15:11] and it's something that you can perceive
[15:14] that's maybe very obscure to everyone
[15:15] else
[15:17] let me say this too that the discernment
[15:19] that god will give you will always line
[15:20] up with
[15:21] the word that he's given in philippians
[15:24] chapter 1 verses 9 to 10
[15:29] and this speaks to something that's
[15:32] developing in our christian lives and
[15:34] this i pray
[15:35] that your love may abound yet more and
[15:38] more so this is an abounding love a
[15:40] growing love
[15:42] and this is how it's expressed in
[15:44] knowledge
[15:45] and in all judgment so when our love for
[15:47] the word increases we don't get
[15:49] more wishy-washy and have less of a
[15:52] backbone and become more less
[15:54] discerning and have less of a
[15:55] distinction but actually our
[15:57] knowledge and discernment becomes
[15:59] sharper and more clear
[16:01] now there's kind of the the two the two
[16:04] ditches to this truth is a lot of times
[16:06] when people
[16:06] claim to be coming more in love with
[16:08] christ they get more
[16:09] welcoming and more accepting and they're
[16:11] not worried about this and not worried
[16:13] about that
[16:14] and those that profess to really have
[16:16] the love of god they're really just kind
[16:18] of ooey gooey and
[16:20] mushy and they're really really sweet
[16:21] but there's really no backbone
[16:23] there's really no truth that kind of
[16:25] under guards their experience where
[16:26] they're really standing on a principle
[16:28] and so love is not what you think it is
[16:31] love is not an emotion and contrary to
[16:33] popular songs love is not a verb
[16:35] love is something that is discerning and
[16:37] love is associated with the word of god
[16:39] it's associated with the person
[16:41] and so on the other end you can't take
[16:43] love and say well love is corrective and
[16:44] then get real rigid and hard and abusive
[16:47] and legalistic with it in both those
[16:50] either way
[16:51] you're in a ditch because where love
[16:52] really excels is as it grows and abounds
[16:55] you have a more comprehensive knowledge
[16:57] and a more full
[16:58] judgment or discernment of things so he
[17:01] says that you may approve which the word
[17:03] approve is translated also to discern
[17:06] in the scripture that you may approve or
[17:07] discern test or try
[17:09] things that are excellent the ability to
[17:11] perceive and recognize things
[17:12] that's excellent that's very good that
[17:15] you may be sincere
[17:16] and without offense till the day of
[17:18] christ that you may be correct that you
[17:19] may be righteous in your judgments
[17:21] righteous in your feelings and your
[17:22] opinions so philippians
[17:25] when paul writes this he talks about a
[17:27] growing love
[17:29] a love that abounds it's an experience
[17:32] it's a character that's increasing to
[17:34] maturity
[17:36] and a love that's maturing is something
[17:37] that in even the mark of it here that
[17:39] your love would abound yet more and more
[17:41] it's marked by a more
[17:42] comprehensive discernment how can you
[17:45] tell you're getting falling more in love
[17:47] with the word of god how can you tell
[17:48] that you're falling more in love with
[17:49] jesus christ
[17:50] your discernment and your perception of
[17:52] right is increasing
[17:54] the further you fall in love with god
[17:56] and the more a closer relationship you
[17:58] have with jesus christ the more
[18:00] present he is in your thinking the more
[18:01] present he is in your life
[18:03] aren't we don't we recognize that when
[18:04] we're really in tune with the spirit
[18:06] that we're a little bit more perceptive
[18:08] to other spirits
[18:10] not open to them but we're perceptive of
[18:11] them we realize wait a minute i'm not so
[18:13] sure
[18:14] and as you're walking with god and
[18:15] walking with the clean conscience you
[18:17] become a lot more sensitive
[18:18] not just to spirits but even to how
[18:20] other people feel you don't become more
[18:22] bullheaded and
[18:24] and rough you become more sensitive and
[18:26] understanding and god gives you wisdom
[18:28] how that you can
[18:28] handle certain circumstances this is
[18:31] what paul is lifting up is a growing
[18:33] love that's marked by
[18:34] a a growing discernment that gives you
[18:37] the ability
[18:38] to recognize situations to be very
[18:40] prudent in situations that you're facing
[18:42] and to make the right kind of decisions
[18:45] so it's a growing something that's
[18:46] maturing
[18:48] in hebrews chapter 5 verses 10 to 14.
[18:53] paul is wanting to preach who is this
[18:55] melchizedek
[18:57] but he says melchizedek called of god as
[18:59] a high priest after the order of
[19:00] melchizedek
[19:01] and he wants to preach who is this
[19:02] melchizedek but he says in verse 11
[19:04] of whom we have many things to say and
[19:06] hard to be uttered
[19:07] seeing your dole of hearing i would like
[19:10] to preach who is this melchizedek but
[19:11] you're not ready for it
[19:13] it's a lot of things that are hard to be
[19:15] understood about him but you're dull of
[19:17] hearing
[19:18] and it wasn't speaking to natural
[19:19] ability to hear what paul was saying or
[19:21] the natural ability to read
[19:23] what he was writing but it was the
[19:24] ability to perceive and kind of pick up
[19:26] what he was laying down he says do you
[19:28] get what i'm saying and
[19:29] we've experienced it before personally
[19:31] we say well you're not listening and the
[19:32] person can repeat back to us
[19:34] exactly what we said and we realized
[19:36] they heard us
[19:37] but they're not listening that they can
[19:40] repeat what i'm saying but are they
[19:41] really catching what is being said
[19:43] they're really able to to identify
[19:46] what's in his heart so he's saying
[19:47] you're dull of hearing
[19:48] and then he then he unpacks it this way
[19:51] and it's so so
[19:52] profound for when for the time you ought
[19:54] to be teachers
[19:56] you ought to have grown to a place where
[19:58] you could be the one teaching
[19:59] you ought to have come to a place in
[20:01] your experience with your knowledge of
[20:02] the word of god and the spirit that's
[20:04] growing within your heart
[20:05] you should have come to the place where
[20:07] you could be teaching but instead of
[20:08] being the teacher
[20:09] you have need that one teach you again
[20:12] which be the first
[20:13] principles of the oracles of god they're
[20:16] needing to be taught and re-established
[20:17] because they're not maturing they're not
[20:18] growing as they ought to they're not
[20:20] able to go on
[20:21] unto the perfect one he says and we and
[20:23] are become such as have
[20:24] need of milk and not strong meat
[20:28] so he's using this picture then of a
[20:30] baby
[20:31] of one who ought to be advancing through
[20:34] the stages of more solid food and then
[20:36] be one who's marked by even a more
[20:38] mature child who can handle
[20:39] handle meat and chew on strong meat he
[20:41] says we're going all the way back to
[20:43] more toddler and infancy stage
[20:44] where your primary diet needs to be that
[20:46] of milk because you can't
[20:48] handle strong meat now again he's using
[20:50] what we might say is the analogy or the
[20:52] type of childhood or
[20:54] not of a toddler or an infant in this
[20:57] case
[20:57] as the word means a babe it means one
[21:00] that's not able to speak
[21:02] it's not a spoken word baby but it's a
[21:04] baby who's not able to speak
[21:05] and he says this verse 13 for everyone
[21:08] that useth milk
[21:10] is unskillful in the word of
[21:11] righteousness for he is a babe
[21:13] now don't be offended you're still a
[21:15] babe right
[21:17] at least you're not dead or stillborn
[21:18] you're a babe in
[21:20] christ you're a young one in christ so
[21:22] if there's any kind of rebuke or
[21:24] correction you take comfort realizing
[21:26] i'm only being corrected because i am a
[21:27] son and being a son he's correcting me
[21:30] and it's not re uh retribution and just
[21:33] chastisement for the sake of making you
[21:35] feel bad he's saying look
[21:36] you're a son or daughter of god but
[21:38] you're being very childlike
[21:39] and there's more for you to grow into
[21:42] there's more for you to understand and
[21:43] experience
[21:44] so he says everyone that uses milk is
[21:46] unskillful in the word of righteousness
[21:49] for he is a babe and i'll just read and
[21:50] go back through this so we can go more
[21:52] quickly
[21:53] but strong meat belonging to them that
[21:55] are full age
[21:56] even those who by reason of use have
[21:59] their senses
[22:00] exercised to discern both good and evil
[22:03] so just as solomon said i am but a child
[22:05] i don't know how to go out or come in
[22:07] and he asks for a discerning heart paul
[22:10] is now speaking about discernment
[22:12] and to understand discernment he wants
[22:14] to use this image of even a baby or an
[22:16] infant that has to be fed milk before it
[22:19] can handle strong meat
[22:21] and if you look at it in the spiritual
[22:23] sense so he says he's unskillful in the
[22:24] word of righteousness
[22:26] he's looking at it as a babe if we look
[22:28] in the natural to understand the point
[22:30] he's trying to make in the spiritual
[22:31] a babe lacks understanding a babe lacks
[22:35] wisdom
[22:36] it lacks a proper view of the world it's
[22:38] still learning it's still trying to
[22:40] understand things
[22:41] the world is its laboratories we could
[22:42] say and through experience and through
[22:44] teaching
[22:44] it's trying to figure everything out and
[22:47] a babe doesn't know
[22:48] good from evil this is something that it
[22:51] learns through time
[22:52] it learns what an angry face is it
[22:54] learns what a smile is it learns these
[22:56] different things
[22:57] as it begins to walk in this world and
[23:00] relate to certain circumstances
[23:02] and we can say even even is it not does
[23:04] it not know
[23:05] good and evil but it's actually inclined
[23:07] to evil
[23:09] and they're more inclined to think that
[23:11] because they want to do it and they're
[23:12] inclined to do it that they're justified
[23:14] because they feel that way
[23:16] so that's how a babe is characterized
[23:18] and i i often say this about a baby if
[23:20] you hand them something what's the first
[23:21] thing they do
[23:23] put it in their mouth the first thing a
[23:25] baby does is you hand it to them it
[23:27] doesn't matter what it is it's
[23:29] because it's their way of trying to
[23:30] figure out what this thing is they do
[23:31] two things they put it in their mouth
[23:32] and then they bang it they throw it
[23:33] what's going to happen to this
[23:35] what they're they're trying to learn but
[23:37] if we start thinking about how
[23:39] paul is looking at the the hebrews and
[23:42] saying you should be teachers
[23:43] you're not teachers you've become as
[23:45] babes then he's actually
[23:47] questioning their ability to know what
[23:48] they should put in their mouths and what
[23:50] they shouldn't
[23:52] are they able to rightly handle the
[23:53] things that are being divided to them
[23:55] so a spiritual babe just as a natural
[23:57] babe doesn't have this proper view and
[23:59] doesn't know good from evil
[24:00] a spiritual babe is not discerning it's
[24:03] unskilled
[24:04] in the word although it's been birthed
[24:06] by it it hasn't grown and been properly
[24:08] nurtured
[24:09] not yielding to the nurture in order to
[24:11] be able to take that word and use it
[24:12] properly
[24:14] we could say and i could say this with
[24:15] absolute sureness that if you've been
[24:17] born again by the spirit of god
[24:19] you have the word in you the word is at
[24:22] your disposal
[24:23] now the utility of it is going to relate
[24:25] directly to your faith and the increase
[24:27] of your faith
[24:28] and how is your faith going to be
[24:29] increased by hearing the word so as you
[24:31] hear the word your faith increases as
[24:33] you grow in knowledge and wisdom of the
[24:34] son of god
[24:35] then it makes your faith and your
[24:37] knowledge of the word
[24:38] more practical where it's not just all
[24:41] zeal with no wisdom so there's a
[24:42] principle
[24:43] that is identifying that although you've
[24:45] been birthed by the word
[24:47] you need your experience in the word to
[24:50] be enriched so that you could take
[24:51] wisdom
[24:52] and be skillful in the word of
[24:53] righteousness
[24:55] claim it no matter where you are in your
[24:57] experience with god you have the word of
[24:59] righteousness what i want to be a
[25:00] skillful with that word
[25:03] i don't want to take a hand of faith and
[25:04] grab the sword and just use it to cut
[25:06] everybody up and to cut this down and
[25:07] cut that down
[25:08] i want to be able to i want the lord to
[25:10] be able to take that word and make let
[25:12] it be effective
[25:13] and bring forth the fruits of
[25:14] righteousness in my life and in my
[25:16] testimony
[25:17] in the way that i impact others
[25:20] and so he says that by who by reason of
[25:23] use those that are foolish strong meat
[25:25] belongs to them that are full age
[25:27] so it's by by participation with the
[25:30] word as he says
[25:32] by reason of use have their senses
[25:34] exercised to discern both good and evil
[25:36] by participation with the word that this
[25:39] understanding and judgment is vigorously
[25:41] used
[25:42] to discern that if you if you could if
[25:45] you can
[25:45] use the word once then you're going to
[25:48] become more proficient the next time you
[25:49] use it
[25:50] the more you use it the better you're
[25:52] going to get at it the more you are in
[25:53] practice
[25:54] of using the word and applying the word
[25:56] and looking to the word and saying lord
[25:58] what does your word say about this
[26:00] lord what does your what does the word
[26:01] say about that the more you use the word
[26:03] the better you get at it it says the
[26:05] strong meat is characterized
[26:07] by those who are full age those who are
[26:08] full age are the ones that are feeding
[26:10] on strong meat
[26:11] because by reason of use by the vigorous
[26:14] use of the word of god
[26:15] they've gotten to where their their
[26:16] discernment is sharper
[26:19] and that's what's being expressed the
[26:21] bible says in first corinthians 14
[26:23] 20 brethren be not children in
[26:25] understanding how being in malice be
[26:27] children be innocent be ignorant of
[26:28] malice be ignorant of evil things
[26:30] but in understanding be men
[26:34] that means have have a spiritual insight
[26:37] that is matured
[26:39] have a faith that begins that begins
[26:43] as a as a faith which is uh
[26:46] there's a even as we think about the
[26:48] statue of a perfect man faith is
[26:49] something
[26:50] that in itself is without any offense
[26:52] and faith itself
[26:53] is out without any blemish but your
[26:56] faith can become
[26:57] perfect faith how did how did
[27:00] then abraham's faith reach its full and
[27:03] supreme expression
[27:04] through his works so you can have faith
[27:07] but faith without works is dead but then
[27:09] faith is made perfect
[27:10] when the fruit of it is expressed and
[27:13] the real benefit
[27:14] and and what it means and what it can do
[27:16] if you don't have faith and it's not
[27:18] practical then we could say then what
[27:19] good
[27:20] is it so you have faith let it become
[27:23] practical you have the word of god let
[27:24] it work
[27:25] and in understanding be men have a
[27:27] matured spiritual insight
[27:29] have a matured faith which is practical
[27:31] which is useful which makes a difference
[27:34] so he says it as a as far as being
[27:36] having understanding don't be a child
[27:38] with respect to understanding
[27:40] and he uses the same language to the
[27:42] corinthian church
[27:44] elsewhere in first corinthians where
[27:45] he's talking about your babes and your
[27:47] carnal and you fuss
[27:48] and you fight and so he's identifying a
[27:50] immature way of thinking
[27:52] and the answer to an immature way of
[27:54] thinking is to have a more godly mind
[27:56] a more mature way of thinking that
[27:58] aligns with the spirit of god and aligns
[28:00] with the word of god
[28:01] so the answer then to this is he says
[28:03] you should be teachers but now you need
[28:05] to be taught again because you're
[28:06] unskillful in the word of righteousness
[28:08] you're more like a babe in christ
[28:10] and so what would they need in order to
[28:12] come to a place where they could have
[28:13] more discernment
[28:14] they need the word and so peter wrote it
[28:17] this way in first peter 2 2 as newborn
[28:19] babes
[28:20] desire the sincere milk of the word that
[28:22] ye may grow
[28:23] thereby so as paul desired to the
[28:27] philippians that their love would abound
[28:28] more and more
[28:29] in more discernment then as we feed on
[28:32] the word of god feeding on the word we
[28:33] mature in wisdom
[28:34] feeding on the word we mature in
[28:36] understanding these are things that
[28:37] become
[28:38] sharper become clear become more readily
[28:40] available to us
[28:41] and so our insight and our judgment
[28:43] becomes deeper
[28:45] our insight in our judgment becomes more
[28:47] profound we can recognize differences
[28:50] the more you look into the face of
[28:51] christ the greater you are able to
[28:54] recognize him when you look away from
[28:55] him
[28:56] and what i mean by the more you're
[28:57] looking into the word you're more of the
[28:59] hearing your word the more you're able
[29:00] to recognize him as you look go through
[29:02] the world
[29:05] and hopefully the more you're softer
[29:07] your spirit becomes
[29:10] so that when you don't see christ right
[29:11] away you have an instinct to try to
[29:13] bring them out
[29:15] we're going to run into a lot of
[29:16] situations with people where we don't
[29:17] we're not met with christ first
[29:20] and we've got to have a way to bring it
[29:22] out of them
[29:23] because all too often let's just all
[29:24] admit it everybody here we could go
[29:26] ahead and
[29:26] you know turn off the cameras and we
[29:27] could all just have an open mic and we
[29:29] know we can talk about how
[29:31] we've been mistreated we've been abused
[29:33] we've been misunderstood
[29:34] and yet we know that inside of us is
[29:36] something good and we know a lot of
[29:38] times we got what we thought
[29:40] we deserve but really what we needed is
[29:42] we needed somebody who could understand
[29:44] us and look past our flesh and look past
[29:46] our lack of wisdom and look past our
[29:48] arrogance and look past our pride
[29:49] and know that deep down inside of this
[29:51] person is christ and i want to find a
[29:53] way to bring
[29:54] it out of them i want to provoke them
[29:56] unto love and under good works i don't
[29:57] want to harden them i don't want to
[29:58] abuse them i don't want to push them
[29:59] away i don't want to
[30:01] beat them up because they're not what
[30:02] they should be but recognize and believe
[30:04] that inside of this son or daughter of
[30:06] god is christ
[30:07] and i am i'm not seeing it but i believe
[30:10] it's there and i want to find a way to
[30:11] bring it out of them that's wisdom
[30:16] and so as newborn babes what we desire
[30:18] is we desire the milk of the word
[30:21] too often maybe we use oh that's just
[30:23] milk and we use it in a way to be
[30:25] dismissive but none of us will ever get
[30:27] to steak if we don't come through the
[30:29] milk
[30:30] you're never gonna be able to handle
[30:31] meat unless you come through the milk so
[30:33] we've got to have the milk we've got to
[30:34] feed on the word of god and then if
[30:36] we're properly feeding on the word then
[30:38] we mature
[30:39] in the amount of word that we can
[30:40] process that we can digest and the
[30:42] nutrients that we're deriving from the
[30:44] word
[30:44] the milk has done its job we've matured
[30:46] now we're taking more of the word
[30:48] we're deriving nutrients from it and
[30:50] what is it doing it's maturing
[30:51] our discernment and therefore it's
[30:54] maturing as our experience matures
[30:56] our discernment matures so this is
[30:58] something that we can claim
[31:00] as a believer to have mature
[31:02] understanding mature discernment
[31:05] as newborn babes desire the sincere
[31:07] sincere
[31:08] milk of the word god wants to teach us
[31:12] to know
[31:12] right and wrong god wants to teach us
[31:16] what is right
[31:17] and god is teaching us what is right god
[31:19] is teaching us what is proper god is
[31:21] teaching us
[31:21] the principles in his word and his
[31:23] thoughts towards things
[31:24] and and and the certain uh way that he
[31:27] views things and the principles that uh
[31:30] that form the foundation for decisions
[31:32] and there's ways we say that the bible
[31:34] says don't do this but then there's also
[31:35] an understanding to realize
[31:37] why you're not supposed to do that that
[31:39] there's a thing that we say well this is
[31:40] what the law says and this is what the
[31:42] word says but there's an understanding
[31:43] to unders
[31:44] to recognize what god is achieving by
[31:46] that
[31:47] jews as an example we could say in the
[31:49] exodus that he told the children of
[31:51] israel to get all the leaven out of the
[31:53] house
[31:54] well it wasn't just to get it out just
[31:56] to have a rule
[31:57] but god had established prior to that
[31:59] that if you eat any leaven during these
[32:01] seven days
[32:02] you'll be cut off from your inheritance
[32:03] be cut off out of israel
[32:05] so god had a rule we could say to get
[32:07] all the leaven
[32:08] and that's part of applying the token to
[32:10] your home get all this
[32:11] filth out get all the trash out get the
[32:13] leaven out of your house
[32:15] and it's not just to have a legalistic
[32:17] rule or ideal
[32:18] but it's to keep from making a mistake
[32:21] or transgressing
[32:22] in something that's important to god
[32:25] and that's the wisdom behind it so god
[32:27] wants us to teach us what is right and
[32:29] he wants to empower us
[32:30] to do what is right with an
[32:32] understanding not just a robot that's
[32:34] been programmed to do it
[32:36] even as parents we could say that we
[32:38] teach and correct our children
[32:40] in a way that they can have an
[32:41] understanding of right and wrong
[32:44] not just operate according to a code a
[32:46] set of rules
[32:47] if they're not taught to understand what
[32:49] is right and what is wrong if they're
[32:50] not taught
[32:51] to be able to recognize things that are
[32:54] uh
[32:54] that are erroneous and we're not
[32:56] imparting to them understanding when we
[32:58] teach them
[32:59] then they just have a list of rules and
[33:00] whenever they're put in a situation like
[33:02] well
[33:02] let me read here yeah that's not on here
[33:06] i don't know what to do
[33:07] you want to be giving them something to
[33:09] where they can make a judgment
[33:10] themselves and say well
[33:11] i've been taught this i've been taught
[33:12] that i've been warned about this i've
[33:14] been warned about that
[33:14] they've been encouraged enough in the
[33:16] positive things and discouraged enough
[33:18] from negative things
[33:19] to when they're put into a situation
[33:21] we've given them some resources that
[33:23] they can draw upon
[33:24] in a time when they need it and that
[33:26] should make a lot of sense to us because
[33:27] that's what god is doing
[33:29] god is wanting us to come to a place
[33:31] where moses
[33:32] stood in a position where god said i've
[33:34] taught you enough why
[33:35] christ speak i've taught you enough i've
[33:38] trained you enough you know well enough
[33:40] now is the time to speak
[33:41] and that's the kind of training that god
[33:42] wants to do for us as children
[33:45] psalms 119 has two different places that
[33:48] speak to this kind of hunger that we
[33:49] ought to have it says teach me good
[33:51] judgment and knowledge verse 66
[33:53] psalms 1 19 66 teach me good judgment
[33:56] and
[33:57] knowledge that judgment there is
[33:58] translated elsewhere to taste
[34:01] the ability to recognize the ability to
[34:03] discriminate teach me good taste
[34:06] let me have good taste let me have good
[34:08] judgment teach me the ability to
[34:10] recognize
[34:11] in verse 125 i am thy servant give me
[34:15] understanding that i may know thy
[34:16] testimonies
[34:18] it says give me understanding it means
[34:19] to discern to be perceived to
[34:21] distinguish
[34:22] to be disturbed discerning to have
[34:24] understanding to be prudent says make me
[34:26] wise
[34:28] make me to have an understanding heart
[34:29] to discern what is best to discern what
[34:31] is proper
[34:32] to do the things that are the better
[34:34] things to do so it's saying
[34:35] teach me good judgment teach me
[34:37] knowledge
[34:38] give me understanding these are things
[34:40] that we should be asking for and praying
[34:42] for
[34:44] this discernment they're asking for it's
[34:46] a manifestation of the spirit
[34:48] of truth ponder that for a moment the
[34:51] spirit that you have received is a
[34:53] spirit that searches all things yea the
[34:54] deep things of god
[34:55] the spirit you have received is the
[34:57] spirit of truth
[34:59] it is associated with understanding and
[35:01] wisdom and knowledge he shall teach you
[35:02] all things he shall show you things that
[35:04] are to come the spirit that you have
[35:06] received is the spirit
[35:07] of truth and so wisdom is a
[35:10] manifestation of the spirit of truth
[35:13] now this may seem to be a little bit uh
[35:16] well let's just say we're turning a
[35:18] corner here in marriage and divorce
[35:20] brother bradham says
[35:22] but now that the seals are opened the
[35:24] spirit of truth directs us to the word
[35:28] now as he's preaching marriage and
[35:29] divorce 100
[35:31] applicable 100 within context brother
[35:34] branham is saying
[35:35] now that the seals are open the spirit
[35:37] of truth is directing us to the word
[35:39] in this instance so he says that
[35:41] explains why all the mistakes have been
[35:42] made down through the ages
[35:44] because the seals were not opened this
[35:46] was not revealed
[35:48] now as it relates to marriage and
[35:49] divorce and this great great question
[35:51] that was on the people's minds of can i
[35:53] do this and can i do that what's the
[35:54] right thing to do what's the wrong thing
[35:55] to do
[35:56] and all these people had this very very
[35:58] heavy question brother branham is
[36:00] identifying that now that the seals are
[36:02] open
[36:02] the spirit of truth can point you to the
[36:04] word and
[36:06] give you the correct judgment on the
[36:08] matter and he's saying the reason why
[36:10] mistakes have been made
[36:11] is not because men were not sincere
[36:13] because people didn't love truth
[36:14] but rather this had not been made known
[36:16] yet now if that's true with respect to
[36:19] marriage and divorce
[36:20] it's true elsewhere that the spirit of
[36:23] truth
[36:24] has been opened up to us and now the
[36:26] spirit of truth which we have received
[36:27] can direct us to the word and where we
[36:30] would have made mistakes before and
[36:32] where mistakes have been made in the
[36:33] past and people were just doing the best
[36:35] they could with what they have
[36:36] now we can say lord let the spirit of
[36:38] truth come and direct me
[36:40] to the word so that re mistakes are not
[36:42] repeated
[36:44] something that's been turning over and
[36:45] over in my heart over the last week
[36:47] is that we god has raised up people who
[36:50] are absolutely cycle breakers
[36:55] that that's what's going to characterize
[36:56] this generation that goes in a body
[36:58] change it's breaking the cycle of
[36:59] revival and death it's repeated itself
[37:01] and there's cycles and families and
[37:03] there's habits that are perpetuated and
[37:04] there's ways that things have been done
[37:06] for generation to generation but when
[37:08] the spirit of truth directs us to the
[37:10] word we can look back and say
[37:11] this is the reason why mistakes have
[37:13] been made the seals were not opened yet
[37:15] this was not revealed so i challenge you
[37:18] to take this very truth about the word
[37:20] being made available to us
[37:22] and let it be very practical john 8
[37:26] 32 says and ye shall know that means
[37:28] perceive and understand the truth
[37:30] you shall perceive and understand you
[37:32] shall have an intimate knowledge of the
[37:34] divine you shall perceive and know the
[37:36] truth
[37:36] and the truth shall read it make you
[37:40] free
[37:41] it shall make you free so this is
[37:44] this is a scripture that's very familiar
[37:46] to us but when we can know and perceive
[37:48] truth there's a liberty in it
[37:51] when we can know and perceive what is
[37:52] right we can know and perceive what is
[37:54] not false we
[37:55] know and perceive and understand the
[37:57] truth then knowing the truth that truth
[37:59] is able to set us at liberty
[38:01] and release us from bondage and so just
[38:04] as we read from marriage and divorce
[38:06] make this very real the revelation of
[38:08] the word can give you
[38:09] practical wisdom and can give you
[38:11] practical discernment
[38:13] that if i can know the truth about a
[38:14] matter a matter does not have to hold me
[38:16] in bondage
[38:17] if i can know the truth about a decision
[38:18] or the right thing to do then i'm not
[38:20] brought under the power of the anxiety
[38:21] of it
[38:24] revelation of the word can give you
[38:26] practical understanding
[38:28] to make your way through your daily life
[38:31] we read it last time i believe it was on
[38:33] sunday we need discernment
[38:35] we need the discerning by the word
[38:37] that's right take the word god's words
[38:39] always right we can't discern by what
[38:41] people think
[38:42] what intellectuals tell us what
[38:44] psychiatrist tells
[38:46] us and the intellectuals it's what you
[38:47] think or what your intellectuals are
[38:49] telling us
[38:49] we've got to go by what god says
[38:53] so when you're asking for wisdom from
[38:55] above when you're asking god
[38:56] for wisdom and he says god it says let
[38:58] him ask of god because he'll give
[39:00] you're not asking for a new opinion
[39:02] you're not asking for consensus you're
[39:04] not asking for what everyone else would
[39:05] think would be right and what everyone
[39:07] else would agree with you're asking for
[39:08] god's judgment on the matter
[39:11] god i want to know what your word says i
[39:13] want to know what you say i want to know
[39:14] what's pleasing to you
[39:16] so now that the seals are open the truth
[39:18] is being expressed to us
[39:20] we can take the truth of the of the
[39:22] opening of the word
[39:23] and we can make it something that's
[39:25] relevant every day of our lives
[39:28] quickening power brother said and rise
[39:30] into the sun quickening power
[39:31] gives discernment to know what's wrong
[39:34] with you and what to do and what you've
[39:35] done and what you ought to not have done
[39:37] and what you should have done and what
[39:38] you will be if that's what quickening
[39:40] power does
[39:41] that's what i want if quickening power
[39:44] gives discernment then i want to know
[39:45] what's wrong with me i want to know what
[39:47] to do
[39:47] i want to know what i have done and what
[39:49] i ought not to have done i want to know
[39:50] what i should have done and what i will
[39:52] be
[39:52] and quickening power is what can give me
[39:54] that kind of understanding
[39:57] quickening power gives us discernment
[39:58] and what is it brother adam says about
[40:00] quickening power
[40:01] in this very message he says quickening
[40:02] power has come to us to open the seven
[40:04] seals he says what was that
[40:07] the intelligence of a man know the
[40:09] quickening power of god
[40:11] so quickening power is not the
[40:13] intelligence of a man it's not even
[40:15] brother branham's opinion on it
[40:17] it's not the intellectual property of
[40:18] brother branham brother venom is the
[40:20] vessel that's in giving declaring to us
[40:22] god's mind and god's thoughts that's
[40:24] when you go back and you read in the old
[40:26] testament and you find that it says
[40:27] don't do this it's an abomination unto
[40:29] the lord the prophet the writer is not
[40:31] guessing
[40:32] god said hey if you do this that's an
[40:34] abomination to me and the guy's like wow
[40:36] okay make sure they know this this
[40:39] is an abomination why that's god's mind
[40:41] not theirs
[40:42] and so this is something being expressed
[40:44] the quickening power that's come to us
[40:46] at the open of the seals the quickening
[40:47] power to came that came to open
[40:49] is not the intelligence of a man it's
[40:52] the headship of christ
[40:54] therefore if we read christ is the
[40:56] mystery of god revealed then we
[40:57] who believe that the new birth is the
[40:59] person revelation of jesus christ
[41:02] personally to us then the new birth
[41:04] gives us
[41:05] access not to a man's intelligence but
[41:07] to the intelligence of the son of man
[41:09] and i want to live by that
[41:13] i'm admonished in that sermon to let him
[41:15] have preeminence
[41:18] because it's christ who opened those
[41:20] seals he says he is those seals for the
[41:22] whole word of god is christ
[41:23] and christ is the seals that were opened
[41:25] what is the opening of the seals
[41:27] revealing christ
[41:30] the revelation of jesus christ resolves
[41:32] complication quickening power has come
[41:35] to us to open up these things to us to
[41:37] give us understanding
[41:38] not to make us mysterious not to make us
[41:40] different if you do that you only get
[41:42] missed the program
[41:44] you only get out of step is to do it to
[41:46] make you live an overcoming life
[41:48] i mean honestly what good would it do if
[41:51] we could all
[41:52] figure out the correct interpretation of
[41:55] the seals and of the thunders and the
[41:57] third pool
[41:58] and the tent vision and we had the
[42:00] perfect complete understanding of
[42:01] it but it didn't make any difference in
[42:03] our lives still don't know how to love
[42:05] our wives
[42:06] still don't know how to provoke not our
[42:07] children to anger still don't know how
[42:09] to
[42:09] do things right and and respond to
[42:12] situations the right way
[42:13] if we were just honest we'd say what
[42:15] good is all that done
[42:18] and that's why paul in a way of not
[42:20] suggesting that you could know all the
[42:21] mysteries
[42:23] and have not charity but say look if you
[42:25] don't have christ the word
[42:26] who is the god is love right
[42:30] and god is the word in the beginning was
[42:31] the word and the word was god
[42:33] and god is love so love and the word are
[42:36] married together and can never be
[42:37] separated
[42:38] so what good would it do for you to know
[42:40] all the mysteries and not have the word
[42:43] love in your heart if you don't have the
[42:45] difference maker
[42:46] if it's something that's not making a
[42:48] difference so when we i'm going through
[42:49] these few moments here to lift up these
[42:51] things
[42:52] about knowing the truth and the open of
[42:54] the seals
[42:55] to to take the revelations that we have
[42:57] been
[42:58] taught that have formed the foundation
[42:59] of the wonderful experiences
[43:01] we've had in the lord and the teachings
[43:03] that we've sat in a heard for decades
[43:05] and realized that everything that lifted
[43:07] up christ and made him more clear in
[43:09] this message
[43:10] and showed us the fulfillment of first
[43:11] thessalonians that showed us the
[43:12] fulfillment of revelations 10
[43:14] that showed us the fulfillment of luke
[43:15] 17 30. at the end is to accumulate so
[43:18] that it comes right down in our hearts
[43:20] and it anchors in such a way to where we
[43:22] live the right kind of life in the
[43:23] presence of god
[43:27] right in the middle of laodicea christ
[43:29] stands at the door knocks
[43:31] and christ is standing at the door
[43:33] knocking to call us out of lao to see
[43:35] his
[43:35] chaos you shall know the truth and the
[43:38] truth shall make you free
[43:39] john 8 36 says if the son therefore
[43:42] shall make you free
[43:43] you shall be free indeed
[43:46] this is the promise that he gives us
[43:48] that if we can receive the revelation of
[43:50] jesus christ
[43:51] it's going to begin to resolve a lot of
[43:54] the things in our personal lives
[43:56] that there's there's people we know and
[43:59] it could be even ourselves
[44:01] that really what we need at the end of
[44:02] the day is to be born again
[44:05] and just that alone changes flips things
[44:09] around so significantly in your life to
[44:11] where we're not even talking about the
[44:13] same things anymore
[44:15] because we sit down and talk about this
[44:16] and talk about that and talk about this
[44:18] and talk about that
[44:19] that you want to bring the p come to a
[44:22] birth
[44:23] once you come to a birth then you've got
[44:25] the life and the nature inside of you
[44:27] and then there's just a way that things
[44:28] work and there's a dynamic at playing
[44:30] it's not you just trying it's not just
[44:32] the preacher trying to keep you in line
[44:33] but there's a there's a mechanic there
[44:35] that works with the dynamics to take you
[44:37] from what you were to change you to a
[44:39] son or daughter of god you've been
[44:40] birthed
[44:41] into the body of jesus christ you've
[44:42] been baptized in this body and now
[44:44] you're made
[44:45] subject to the laws of god and now you
[44:48] can
[44:48] grow in grace and wisdom and
[44:50] understanding and when you've been made
[44:51] free
[44:52] you are free indeed all by that
[44:55] experience
[44:59] let's turn to hebrews chapter 4.
[45:12] now
[45:15] notice as we read this
[45:19] how that he's talking about rest
[45:22] and ceasing from our own works
[45:26] there remaineth therefore hebrews 4 9
[45:28] we'll read to verse 16 again
[45:30] there remaineth therefore a rest to the
[45:33] people of god
[45:35] for he that has entered into his rest he
[45:37] also has ceased from his own works as
[45:38] god did
[45:39] from his let us labor therefore to enter
[45:42] into that rest lest any man fall after
[45:44] the same
[45:45] example of unbelief the image that paul
[45:48] is presenting to the hebrews is ceased
[45:50] from your own strife your own works
[45:52] labor to enter into his rest
[45:56] to a place that he wants you to rest and
[45:58] then the
[45:59] very in the very context of laboring to
[46:02] enter into rest
[46:04] he says for the word of god is quick and
[46:06] powerful
[46:08] now he's he's not kind of changing the
[46:10] subjects of what you should find a place
[46:12] to rest now let me talk about the deep
[46:13] things for a second
[46:15] somehow our rest is associated with
[46:18] this powerful word somehow you're
[46:21] laboring the
[46:22] interest and you being comfortable and
[46:23] secure in that rest and your full
[46:25] understanding of what that rest
[46:27] offers you something about this rest is
[46:30] made available to us and made perfect
[46:32] in us and it has meaning and substance
[46:34] to us in this discerning word we begin
[46:36] to read about in verse 12.
[46:38] if you only catch this part in this
[46:40] whole sermon just catch
[46:42] this part that something about the word
[46:45] the word that is expressed here in
[46:46] hebrews 4 12 the dynamics and the power
[46:49] and the ability of the word
[46:51] is what your rest is is made available
[46:54] to you by
[46:55] it's what makes the rest what it is for
[46:58] the word of god is quick and powerful
[47:00] and sharper than any two edged sword
[47:02] remember we're to take the sword of the
[47:04] spirit which is the word
[47:06] solomon said give me a sword bring me a
[47:08] sword the sword represents discernment
[47:10] it represents something that's sharp
[47:12] something that's
[47:12] a powerful he says the word of god is
[47:14] sharper the knee to its sword piercing
[47:16] even to the divide and asunder of soul
[47:18] and spirit and of the joints
[47:20] and marrow and as a discerner of the
[47:22] thoughts and intents of the heart
[47:26] our rest is related to a word
[47:30] that can discern our rest is related to
[47:33] a word that can take things that are
[47:34] fleshly and put them in the flesh
[47:36] things that are spiritual and put them
[47:37] in the spiritual things that are in the
[47:38] soul put them in the soul
[47:39] the arrest relates to word which is
[47:41] discerning and can rightly divide among
[47:43] soul body and spirit
[47:45] or soul spirit body body spirit soul is
[47:48] you'd want to work out
[47:49] in or in and out he's saying that the
[47:51] word of god is quick and powerful the
[47:52] word is quickening power
[47:55] quickening power gives us discernment
[47:56] quickening power has come to us
[47:58] the word of god which is nighty which is
[48:00] even in your mouth is quick and powerful
[48:02] sharper than any twiddle sword and is a
[48:04] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[48:06] the heart
[48:06] this is what we need then if we need
[48:10] discernment we need the discerning word
[48:12] that's what we discern by he says we
[48:14] discern
[48:14] by the word so right now he's kind of
[48:17] come to this
[48:18] and it kind of forms this center of all
[48:20] this labor therefore to enter into your
[48:22] rest they say neither is there any
[48:23] creature that's not manifest in his
[48:25] sight what the sight of the word the
[48:26] word of god
[48:27] but all things are naked and open to the
[48:29] eyes of him with whom we have to do
[48:32] he hasn't left the subject of rest and
[48:34] he is now amplifying further what the
[48:36] word is the word is a person
[48:38] the word of god is quick and powerful
[48:39] there's nothing that is hid from his
[48:41] sight god's sight
[48:42] all things are naked and open before the
[48:43] eyes of him with whom we have to do
[48:45] and so saying we must enter into rest
[48:50] and then he brings into our mind we're
[48:51] thinking about this discerning word this
[48:52] word that can discern
[48:54] he says in verse 14 see and then that we
[48:56] have a great high priest
[49:00] i are you can you let's just focus now
[49:03] for just a few more moments
[49:06] that we want to find rest in this
[49:09] chaotic world
[49:12] it's it's this world just has a way of
[49:13] making us restless
[49:15] and we're just always resting no matter
[49:16] what seems to come up and we all that's
[49:18] good it satisfied that but we're kept
[49:20] constantly restless the way that
[49:21] laodicea could be described is they
[49:23] didn't realize just how restless they
[49:25] were
[49:25] oh i'm good i don't need anything no i'm
[49:29] no
[49:29] i'm good i i'm not no i'm i'm good i
[49:32] don't need anything
[49:33] right and the whole time they're just
[49:34] jonesing for more they just got to have
[49:36] more no i'm good i don't i don't need
[49:37] anything no i'm good
[49:40] they're restless i said we could come to
[49:42] a place of contentment
[49:44] we can find rest for our souls come unto
[49:45] me all you are burdened and everything
[49:46] come to me take my yoke take my burden
[49:49] and you'll find rest in your souls
[49:50] he's talking about coming to a place
[49:51] where we can be content we can be
[49:53] satisfied
[49:53] when you know the truth it sets you free
[49:56] you can cast down these
[49:57] off these weights you can cast off this
[49:59] baggage you can cast off all these cares
[50:01] about what everyone else is thinking you
[50:02] can cast off all these cares about what
[50:04] would this person say what would that
[50:05] person say
[50:07] you know what this beard represents me
[50:09] overcoming what everyone else thinks
[50:13] i don't know if that's true for brother
[50:14] lucas and whoever else
[50:16] but and maybe more appropriate for him
[50:18] he doesn't care how it looks
[50:20] but that's what that's what some things
[50:22] represent our life is no longer being
[50:24] under the weight of what everyone else
[50:25] is thinking i just want to know what god
[50:27] says
[50:28] oh my goodness you're going to start a
[50:30] church in phoenix brother aaron
[50:31] what is everybody going to think oh i
[50:33] hadn't thought about that
[50:35] because god just told me that's what he
[50:36] wanted me to do and i thought you know
[50:38] what that's good enough
[50:40] one brother asked me he said brother and
[50:41] i just got one question we support you
[50:42] one
[50:43] thousand percent we're right there right
[50:44] behind you it's wonderful we just have
[50:46] one question
[50:46] why phoenix and i said oh that's
[50:50] that's easy i didn't choose phoenix god
[50:52] did
[50:55] it i didn't sit down in pros and cons
[50:57] what should we do
[50:58] i found the mind of god god communicated
[51:00] to by divine revelation what one ought
[51:02] to do it
[51:03] and confirmed it in the way that god can
[51:05] you you're set at liberty then you're
[51:06] not worried what would this person do
[51:07] what will that person do what's going to
[51:09] happen what's going to happen to our
[51:10] kids
[51:10] we could just rest knowing just do what
[51:12] god says to do he knows how to work it
[51:14] out
[51:15] brother braham said he'll do the rest
[51:18] there's a way there's just a way things
[51:19] work out when you do what he wants you
[51:20] to do
[51:21] yeah go ahead go do that but there's
[51:23] nothing no go ahead do it
[51:24] try me go ahead do it
[51:27] okay lord i'm going to trust you well
[51:28] good that's that's what you should do
[51:32] then you shall have rest in your soul so
[51:34] this is what he's walking us through
[51:35] and then he says this about the word the
[51:38] word he brings this rest
[51:39] the word the word and now he says we
[51:40] have a high priest
[51:42] this is forming the next part of how we
[51:44] enter into our rest we have this rest
[51:46] that's made available to us
[51:47] it's going to come by this word this
[51:49] discerning word he says we have a high
[51:50] priest
[51:51] that is passed into heavens jesus the
[51:53] son of god let us hold fast
[51:55] unto our profession let's hold fast our
[51:57] profession sin that we have this high
[51:59] priest
[52:00] for we have not a high priest which
[52:02] cannot be touched
[52:03] with the feeling of our infirmities
[52:09] we need discernment right it's what we
[52:12] need we need discernment
[52:14] we shall know the truth and the truth
[52:15] shall make you free now this is what you
[52:17] have access to
[52:19] your call upon god for revelation if
[52:20] you're asking god for wisdom
[52:22] he says for we have not a high priest we
[52:24] cannot which cannot be touched
[52:26] with the feeling of our infirmities but
[52:28] was in all points tempted like as we
[52:30] were
[52:31] yet without sin this is the person
[52:34] you're asking for guidance from
[52:36] this is the person you're asking to give
[52:37] you wisdom and he's someone who can be
[52:39] touched by what you're going through
[52:42] he's somebody that knows and has been
[52:44] tempted in all points like we were
[52:46] there's nothing we can go to him on and
[52:48] he starts scratching his head
[52:49] hmm hadn't thought about that well i'm
[52:52] not sure
[52:53] let me pray about it this is a one who
[52:55] has been tempted in all points like as
[52:57] we were
[52:58] and here's the beautiful part yet
[53:00] without sin so he knows how to make it
[53:02] through on the other side without
[53:04] blemish
[53:05] he knows how to help you navigate the
[53:07] labyrinth of laodicea he knows how to
[53:08] tell you where to go and how to come out
[53:10] how to go in
[53:11] he can give you wisdom for the moment
[53:13] that you're living in
[53:14] because he can be touched by the feeling
[53:16] of your infirmities he can be
[53:17] empathetic with whatever you're going
[53:20] through
[53:21] take it to the lord you can say lord i
[53:22] don't know what to do lord i'm
[53:24] struggling lord i'm at my wits in
[53:26] and you can say i feel you i know what
[53:27] you're going through i've been through
[53:29] that and i came out on the other side
[53:31] without sin without blemish
[53:33] that's the one you can go to and talk to
[53:37] notice just how beautiful it is he says
[53:39] let us therefore come boldly under the
[53:41] throne of grace that we may obtain
[53:42] mercy and find grace to help in time of
[53:46] need
[53:48] this is what the revelation of the word
[53:49] gives us access to
[53:51] his rest and a source of wisdom
[53:55] he was in all points tempted like as we
[53:58] were
[53:59] he can be touched oh can he be touched
[54:00] by the feelings of a housewife yes
[54:03] in all points he's been tempted like as
[54:04] unto you were there's nothing new under
[54:06] the sun as it said
[54:07] so he can in all points he can give the
[54:09] wisdom we need
[54:11] we don't just go to him when we need
[54:13] healing
[54:14] we do but not just only when we need
[54:17] healing
[54:18] we're not only praying when we're sick
[54:19] and when we're about to eat
[54:23] and it seems to be the promises that
[54:24] seem to be more pronounced to us is ye
[54:26] shall lay hands on the sick and they
[54:28] shall recover
[54:29] and if this person is sick anointed with
[54:30] oil and it seems the promises that are
[54:32] more pronounced to us is the fact that
[54:34] he is a divine healer he's also a divine
[54:36] resolver of doubts
[54:37] dissolver of doubts he's also a divine
[54:39] leader he's a divine comforter
[54:42] he's a divine guide if we could come to
[54:44] the place like brother brandon said i
[54:45] don't even want to walk without you
[54:47] i don't want to fish on the bank without
[54:48] you god let you be
[54:50] the one who's divinely holding my hand
[54:52] and leading me through this
[54:53] because he wants to do it if we'll just
[54:56] yield to him and let him
[54:59] he wants to be able to not just give us
[55:02] help when we're sick
[55:04] but it's everything
[55:07] seeing that we have this high priest let
[55:10] us come to him
[55:11] so we can find grace to help when we're
[55:14] needy
[55:16] that's what it can come down to i need
[55:18] grace i need grace in this situation i
[55:20] need to figure my way out of this i need
[55:22] to know what the right thing is to do
[55:24] the bible says in first john 4 1 this is
[55:26] our last scripture
[55:28] and i want to use just one example i
[55:29] haven't been able to get to
[55:33] first john 4 1 beloved believe not every
[55:36] spirit
[55:38] that would be the simple that the
[55:40] proverbs calls out
[55:41] gullible believes everything whatever
[55:43] said
[55:44] it's the wrong kind of simple believe
[55:46] not every spirit but try
[55:48] the spirit the word they try is prove or
[55:51] discern
[55:52] approve discern but try discern the
[55:54] spirits whether they are of god
[55:56] because many false prophets are gone out
[55:58] into the world brother graham said in
[56:00] one place that we ought to have
[56:01] discernment
[56:02] to know the spirit in a man whether it
[56:04] be of god or not
[56:08] that could be used in such a way to say
[56:10] well i've discerned his spirit he's
[56:11] he's not a christian but it even would
[56:14] be discernment to know that even though
[56:16] what he's doing may seem wrong you
[56:18] discern his spirit he's sincere in what
[56:19] he's trying to do
[56:23] the bible tells us not to believe every
[56:26] spirit but to try them to discern them
[56:28] to test them
[56:31] let me ask you this as we bring this to
[56:33] a close if we are asked to discern
[56:35] spirits
[56:36] then would god not give us the ability
[56:38] to do it
[56:41] if he asks you if he asks you to try his
[56:43] spirits would he not then be the one
[56:45] that
[56:45] empowers you and gives you the ability
[56:47] to do it and so he says i want you to
[56:49] discern spirits i want you to discern
[56:51] spirits and then we're like
[56:52] okay all right i guess i'll go do it
[56:53] like no no no let's back up
[56:55] he's told you to do it so then what we
[56:57] should say well then lord help me do it
[56:59] then lord give me this ability just as
[57:01] cain who said hey if you do well will
[57:03] you not be accepted he's like well no i
[57:04] don't want to do well he should have
[57:06] said well then what's well
[57:08] what's right when the spirit of the lord
[57:10] told brother branham uh you can do this
[57:13] to bind the greatest and the least he
[57:14] says but you must be more sincere
[57:16] or he said he said you can you can bind
[57:18] this spirit the greatest to the least
[57:20] brother brampton say
[57:21] thanks i appreciate it and then run off
[57:23] he said then what must i do
[57:25] there's the wisdom sometimes we think
[57:27] wisdom is knowing what to do the wisdom
[57:28] is knowing you don't know what to do
[57:30] and that's the best place to start and
[57:32] say lord then give me wisdom
[57:34] maybe that could be the starting point
[57:36] for all of us your brother aaron you've
[57:37] been saying this for five parts well
[57:38] then
[57:38] let me hopefully i can say it for the
[57:40] last time tonight let us all start by
[57:42] admitting that we don't have it all
[57:43] figured out we don't have all the
[57:44] answers and we need him to give him to
[57:46] us
[57:49] if he's told us to try the spirits then
[57:52] he must give us the ability to do
[57:54] so if the church in this last days which
[57:57] you are part of
[57:58] the bride of jesus christ in the end
[58:00] time is going to discern
[58:02] and withstand the antichrist spirit and
[58:05] in discerning and withstanding the
[58:06] antichrist spirit it's going to make
[58:07] satan powerless before her
[58:09] if we can do that then we can have a
[58:11] god-given ability to exercise wisdom and
[58:14] discernment in our daily lives
[58:18] right if you're gonna have the power
[58:22] to discern the two spirits within the
[58:24] framework of the christian church
[58:26] and discern and withstand the antichrist
[58:28] spirit and through that discernment make
[58:30] satan completely powerless before you
[58:32] if that's the greatest thing that this
[58:34] church is gonna climax under
[58:36] then does that not translate to where
[58:37] god could be giving you now wisdom in
[58:39] your daily life
[58:42] that we're so focused on maybe what the
[58:43] end result's going to be one day we're
[58:45] going to be able to put death under our
[58:46] feet well maybe how about being able to
[58:48] put this situation in its place
[58:50] and i want to start there in just
[58:52] victory stone after stone how's this
[58:54] wall going to be how is this temple
[58:56] going to be built
[58:56] stone after stone after stone revelation
[58:59] after revelation after
[59:00] word upon word upon word lord i want to
[59:03] don't want to be daydreaming about the
[59:04] finished wall i don't want to be
[59:05] daydreaming about a castle beyond the
[59:07] river
[59:07] i want to go ahead and take stone after
[59:09] stone after stone
[59:11] revelation after revelation and i want
[59:12] to build my wall i want to build my home
[59:15] and i want to do it step by step stone
[59:16] my stone because if i can do that one
[59:19] day
[59:19] then i can do this job today if one day
[59:22] i'm gonna be able to look death in the
[59:23] face and say devil you can't handle me
[59:25] get under my feet death you're you're
[59:27] you've done you've caught taken a bride
[59:29] remember for the last time if one day by
[59:31] revelation i know i'm gonna do that then
[59:32] right now i can look inside my home and
[59:34] say the spirit's not right
[59:36] lord what's wrong in my family what's
[59:38] wrong in my life what's taking place
[59:40] and bring spirits under control and have
[59:42] the discerner go through your heart and
[59:43] go through your life and uncover things
[59:45] not for your detriment and not to your
[59:47] shame but that you can be
[59:49] edified and christ can be glorified
[59:53] how much more you think well
[59:56] how practical is that brother aaron
[1:00:01] i've been asking god to give me wisdom
[1:00:03] when to say yes
[1:00:05] i feel like i say no to my kids all the
[1:00:07] time
[1:00:09] you say no so much i realize there's got
[1:00:12] to be a wisdom in this
[1:00:14] you can't just keep saying no what are
[1:00:16] you trying to achieve
[1:00:18] no you can't do this no you can't do
[1:00:19] that and i thought my kids would a man
[1:00:21] louder
[1:00:21] at that point eliza that was your chance
[1:00:24] and and it's like you're always saying
[1:00:26] no but i realize
[1:00:28] there's not there's not wisdom and just
[1:00:29] always saying no if there's no wisdom
[1:00:31] behind it
[1:00:32] what are you trying to accomplish what
[1:00:34] are you achieving by restricting
[1:00:36] forbidding what are you trying to
[1:00:38] achieve with all these rules what are
[1:00:39] you trying to accomplish
[1:00:40] with the way that you're going about
[1:00:41] this there's got to be something at the
[1:00:43] end of the day you're promoting
[1:00:44] so you can take a step back and say are
[1:00:45] all my nose promoting what's valuable or
[1:00:48] all my nose promoting
[1:00:49] uh what ought to be and for me maybe
[1:00:52] god's dealing with me to know when to
[1:00:53] say yes and have wisdom to say yes
[1:00:55] maybe for you it's wisdom when to say no
[1:00:58] maybe there's too many yeses and that
[1:00:59] just goes to show
[1:01:00] that there's ways that god is dealing
[1:01:02] with us there's things that we're
[1:01:03] working through there's things that
[1:01:04] we're facing for the answer isn't for me
[1:01:06] to come up and say
[1:01:06] everyone this week say no to this it's
[1:01:09] find the mind of
[1:01:10] god to know the right thing to do in the
[1:01:11] situation you're going through
[1:01:13] so that when you give the answer there's
[1:01:15] wisdom behind it to promote the virtuous
[1:01:17] result
[1:01:17] that it ought to bring that's what
[1:01:21] wisdom is
[1:01:23] wisdom can be a situation where you just
[1:01:25] know what you can give your kids what
[1:01:26] you can allow your kids to do
[1:01:28] so that you're not just always creating
[1:01:30] a restrictive environment
[1:01:32] and promoting the wrong kind of virtues
[1:01:35] on the other hand it could be knowing
[1:01:36] when to say
[1:01:37] no because you're not promoting the
[1:01:39] right environment and you'd recognize
[1:01:41] you know what
[1:01:41] i'm letting them do these things and
[1:01:43] it's not promoting the promoting the
[1:01:44] virtuous spirit
[1:01:45] that we should have in our homes that's
[1:01:47] wisdom
[1:01:51] in world war ii how do you like that for
[1:01:53] segway
[1:01:55] set that up real good in world war ii
[1:01:57] there was a
[1:01:59] they had brought together a secret group
[1:02:00] of scientists estheticians and
[1:02:02] mathematicians
[1:02:04] and they had done it was a civilian
[1:02:05] group of people and they'd done it with
[1:02:07] this uh
[1:02:07] it's classified as the word i was
[1:02:09] looking for and
[1:02:11] the military presented them with a set
[1:02:12] of data to find a solution a very
[1:02:14] specific problem
[1:02:16] and the question was as the as the
[1:02:19] military was experiencing in the
[1:02:20] uh with re uh in their military aircraft
[1:02:24] is in the dog fights and all the the
[1:02:28] missions that they were going on
[1:02:29] the planes that were getting shot down
[1:02:31] planes were returning and they wanted
[1:02:32] they were wrestling with this idea
[1:02:34] of how can we fortify the planes without
[1:02:36] making them too heavy to fly
[1:02:38] so they ask themselves where's the
[1:02:40] optimal place to put extra armor
[1:02:43] in order to protect the planes against
[1:02:45] bullets
[1:02:46] so the military is looking for
[1:02:47] efficiency we want to bulk up the plane
[1:02:49] but we can't bulk it up too much because
[1:02:51] then it won't fly
[1:02:52] so what we want to do is we want to
[1:02:54] protect with less armor
[1:02:56] by concentrating on the places where the
[1:02:58] armor should be
[1:03:00] are you following me anybody just the
[1:03:03] eyes that seem the brightest right now
[1:03:04] i'll just focus on it i'm just going to
[1:03:06] tell you a story brother john
[1:03:07] so i can get through this so like we got
[1:03:09] to load these planes up with armor but
[1:03:11] if we put armor all over the whole plane
[1:03:13] it won't be able to fly so let's
[1:03:14] concentrate our armor in the places
[1:03:16] where the
[1:03:17] where we need it the most so that the
[1:03:19] plane would be able to fly
[1:03:20] put it in the place of the greatest need
[1:03:22] and they thought well let's put it in
[1:03:23] the place where the planes are getting
[1:03:25] hit the most
[1:03:26] so they wanted to know how much armor
[1:03:28] belonged on those parts of the plane
[1:03:31] and they gathered all these statitions
[1:03:33] and these mathematicians together and
[1:03:34] they presented them with all the data
[1:03:36] and said our planes are being hit here
[1:03:37] and they're being hit there and this is
[1:03:38] where most of the planes are being hit
[1:03:40] and what we want to know is where should
[1:03:41] we put the armor on all these places
[1:03:43] they're being hit
[1:03:44] to be the most efficient so that we can
[1:03:46] continue in this war and see a
[1:03:47] successful result
[1:03:49] and one of the mathematicians abraham
[1:03:51] wald
[1:03:53] looked at the situation and had an
[1:03:54] answer that was completely outside the
[1:03:56] box
[1:03:58] it was as if solomon was standing there
[1:03:59] and says bring me a sword like
[1:04:01] we're talking about airplanes swords
[1:04:03] aren't going to do our airplanes any
[1:04:04] any good besides all our pilots are
[1:04:07] equipped with
[1:04:08] guns in case something happens no bring
[1:04:09] me a sword he completely thought outside
[1:04:11] the box
[1:04:12] and what he told him is the armor
[1:04:14] doesn't belong where the bullet holes
[1:04:16] were
[1:04:18] the armor the armor belongs where the
[1:04:20] bullet holes aren't
[1:04:25] because the data they were using were on
[1:04:27] the planes that returned
[1:04:29] and so as the planes returned like man
[1:04:31] there's bullet holes all over this plane
[1:04:33] and they said they had a bunch of bullet
[1:04:34] holes
[1:04:35] here so we need to load this part up but
[1:04:37] what abraham wald said
[1:04:38] is the planes that aren't returning are
[1:04:41] the planes that were shot somewhere else
[1:04:43] than where these bullet holes are
[1:04:45] and thought about it completely
[1:04:46] different and i'm using a natural
[1:04:48] example just to see
[1:04:49] how the wisdom of god can work in our
[1:04:51] lives oh it's so obvious
[1:04:53] there's a thousand bullet holes on the
[1:04:54] wings make the wings heavier but this
[1:04:57] guy sits back and says you know what in
[1:04:59] all these airplanes you notice how few
[1:05:00] bullet holes are actually in the engine
[1:05:04] and why was that because the airplanes
[1:05:06] that got shot in the engine
[1:05:07] they weren't coming back and so the
[1:05:10] wisdom was
[1:05:11] put the armor where the bullet holes
[1:05:13] aren't
[1:05:14] and this is the way that it was
[1:05:15] described the reason the planes were
[1:05:17] coming back with fewer hits to the
[1:05:18] engine
[1:05:19] is that planes that got hit in the
[1:05:20] engine weren't coming back
[1:05:23] and here's a mathematician in a
[1:05:24] situation that would be life or death
[1:05:26] trying to resolve this war trying to
[1:05:27] figure out a way
[1:05:28] to conquer the enemy and the prevailing
[1:05:30] theory and the prevailing idea would be
[1:05:32] like we want to find the best place to
[1:05:34] put armor where the most bullet holes
[1:05:35] are
[1:05:36] stat by statistic statistics and using
[1:05:38] math
[1:05:39] which place is the best and this guy
[1:05:40] said hold on you're going about it all
[1:05:42] wrong
[1:05:42] you don't want to put the armor where
[1:05:43] the bullet holes are you put them where
[1:05:45] they aren't
[1:05:50] i thought about it this way and i think
[1:05:51] it's even written this way
[1:05:53] his wisdom wasn't confined to the
[1:05:56] military's
[1:05:57] assumptions whatever their assumptions
[1:06:00] were whatever their justifications were
[1:06:03] like they had these justifications this
[1:06:04] is why we need to do this but he had a
[1:06:06] wisdom that just turned it upside down
[1:06:07] and said no you're going about it all
[1:06:08] wrong
[1:06:10] if it's a if it's kind of a an
[1:06:11] eye-catching story if it's something
[1:06:13] that kind of
[1:06:14] gets your attention i hope that in this
[1:06:16] moment as we use that example in
[1:06:18] a real world scenario life or death a
[1:06:20] military
[1:06:21] trying to figure out a way to keep
[1:06:22] planes in the air and to conquer an
[1:06:24] enemy
[1:06:24] that that kind of wisdom that was on
[1:06:26] display to allow them to make a decision
[1:06:29] when life and death depended upon it
[1:06:31] just as much as it worked in this
[1:06:32] mathematician this abraham wall
[1:06:34] we've got even something greater as it
[1:06:36] relates to the warfare that we're
[1:06:38] engaged in where we could take something
[1:06:40] that all these people have their
[1:06:41] justifications and their reasons and
[1:06:43] their assumptions
[1:06:44] and we could take a step back and say
[1:06:45] wait a minute we're thinking about it
[1:06:46] all wrong
[1:06:47] this is the right thing to do
[1:06:52] all right go ahead and ask me what's
[1:06:53] your point brother aaron i'm glad you
[1:06:55] asked
[1:06:57] we know we're living in an evil day it's
[1:07:00] a chaotic
[1:07:00] confusing complicated age we know we're
[1:07:04] living in an age that's crazy
[1:07:06] we know that god has called us to
[1:07:08] righteousness we know that he's called
[1:07:09] us to uprightness that the mark of this
[1:07:11] age it's been said as perfection
[1:07:14] and then we recognize that our
[1:07:15] relationships are at best complex
[1:07:17] and in reality we probably could say
[1:07:19] they're they're really just complicated
[1:07:22] we have family strain strains in the
[1:07:24] family we have habits we have pressures
[1:07:26] we have all sorts of voices
[1:07:29] how are we in the circumstances we are
[1:07:31] in
[1:07:32] how are we going to raise our children
[1:07:34] correctly today
[1:07:36] how are we going to mend our marriages
[1:07:37] how are we going to enrich our marriages
[1:07:40] how can we make it through the social
[1:07:41] political uh
[1:07:43] and economic upheaval and the divide
[1:07:46] that exists
[1:07:47] there's this divide that keeps getting
[1:07:49] bigger and bigger
[1:07:51] just in society how are we going to be
[1:07:54] able to get it through that there's a
[1:07:55] divide that seems to be
[1:07:56] getting bigger and bigger even with
[1:07:57] respect to fellowship and people we love
[1:07:59] and people that believe this message
[1:08:01] how are we going to navigate this how
[1:08:02] are we going to get through it this is
[1:08:03] what the point i've been trying to make
[1:08:04] wisdom from above
[1:08:07] that's how you're going to do it it's
[1:08:09] the only it's the only wisdom we can
[1:08:11] rely on
[1:08:11] and since that's the only thing that's
[1:08:13] going to get you through this then
[1:08:14] ask for it and ask god to give you say
[1:08:18] god give me spiritual insight
[1:08:20] and spiritual sensitivity because what i
[1:08:22] need is discernment in this end time
[1:08:24] to make it through this filthy age clean
[1:08:27] and remind yourself over and over again
[1:08:30] that the one you're asking for wisdom
[1:08:32] is one who can be touched by what you're
[1:08:33] going through
[1:08:35] and has been tempted in all points such
[1:08:37] as we were and was without sin
[1:08:40] so he knows what to do if we could stand
[1:08:44] together and pray
[1:08:47] what's going to do it wisdom from above
[1:08:52] what do we need to do ask for it
[1:08:57] with our heads bowed let us go to the
[1:09:00] lord in prayer
[1:09:02] a gracious heavenly father i so
[1:09:05] appreciate a congregation of people that
[1:09:07] will
[1:09:08] hang on every word not because it comes
[1:09:12] from a friend or not because it comes
[1:09:14] from
[1:09:16] someone that they have the utmost carnal
[1:09:21] confidence in and just enjoy the manner
[1:09:23] in which they speak but lord i believe
[1:09:25] it's because
[1:09:26] they know a promise that you made that
[1:09:29] you would speak to them through gifts
[1:09:31] that you've given them
[1:09:34] and so we gather in a hotel conference
[1:09:36] center on a
[1:09:37] wednesday night not to play church
[1:09:41] not even as it were have church
[1:09:45] but to hear from you and i believe that
[1:09:49] we have heard from you tonight
[1:09:56] and you've spoken about the king's sword
[1:10:01] in such a way to where
[1:10:04] as our hands grab a hold of this
[1:10:07] it means more to us than it ever has
[1:10:12] lord we think about generations past to
[1:10:15] blaze the trail of god sent a prophet
[1:10:18] blaze the trail of holiness and blaze
[1:10:20] the trail of the opening of the word and
[1:10:25] the casualties along the way of lost
[1:10:27] children and
[1:10:28] broken fellowship even lives that end in
[1:10:32] ruin
[1:10:36] i believe lord that a generation
[1:10:38] succeeds
[1:10:40] these prior ones and takes the momentum
[1:10:44] from the one past
[1:10:46] and is pushed forward deeper in your
[1:10:48] word
[1:10:52] as it were the last breath of this
[1:10:54] generation that preceded this says
[1:10:57] take it all the way go further than we
[1:11:00] were able to go
[1:11:02] do more than what we were able to do
[1:11:06] knowing that what we have been passed is
[1:11:08] the baton that they were carrying
[1:11:11] so there's no shame there's no rebuke
[1:11:12] there's no correction by
[1:11:14] saying lord let me take it
[1:11:18] further deeper higher
[1:11:22] wiser that's what i pray lord
[1:11:27] i would not be where i am today had it
[1:11:30] not been for godly
[1:11:31] men that went before me godly parents
[1:11:33] and godly labors and godly efforts
[1:11:38] and lord in light of all that's been
[1:11:39] done in these cloud of witnesses lord i
[1:11:42] stand upon these truths and i say lord
[1:11:43] give me
[1:11:44] a deeper intimate knowledge of you give
[1:11:46] me a greater understanding of your word
[1:11:48] and let me
[1:11:49] lord with the spirit of truth that's
[1:11:51] been given us the revelation of this
[1:11:53] message that's been imparted to us
[1:11:54] lord may become more practical may
[1:11:56] become more
[1:11:58] more simple to us may become
[1:12:02] an everyday reality and i ask that you
[1:12:05] give wisdom to us
[1:12:06] as husbands and mothers and fathers and
[1:12:11] wives and children whatever calling we
[1:12:14] may be
[1:12:15] in are just thinking about circumstances
[1:12:19] that people find themselves in
[1:12:20] and thinking that they maybe they had
[1:12:22] moved way beyond that and these things
[1:12:24] are in the past they find themselves
[1:12:25] being challenged in a situation that
[1:12:29] they thought was
[1:12:30] long behind them are you giving them a
[1:12:34] chance now lord
[1:12:36] to do it right
[1:12:41] give us wisdom lord i pray you give us
[1:12:45] wisdom
[1:12:47] lord made this wisdom be the kind that
[1:12:50] is from above
[1:12:52] that's pure easily entreated
[1:12:59] maybe the kind of wisdom that can bring
[1:13:02] out christ and somebody else
[1:13:04] we commit ourselves to you tonight thank
[1:13:06] you for your presence with us
[1:13:08] bless us lord as we worship be with your
[1:13:10] people as they go
[1:13:11] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[1:13:13] pray amen
