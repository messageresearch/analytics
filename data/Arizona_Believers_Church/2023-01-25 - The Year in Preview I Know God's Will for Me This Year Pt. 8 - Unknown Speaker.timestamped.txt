[0:00] the year in preview we know God's will
[0:02] for us this year the three six things
[0:05] we've been looking at let's just look
[0:06] back at some of the three the three
[0:07] things we've been looking at on
[0:08] Wednesday night there's one Sanctified
[0:10] the whole your home gather around the
[0:13] word and live for others and I just want
[0:15] to point one thing I think we've covered
[0:17] these in a general enough way to where
[0:19] we understand what each one of these
[0:20] things refer to but in looking back to
[0:23] live for others that we addressed last
[0:25] Wednesday night we kind of look at it as
[0:26] a product of the Sanctified home in the
[0:30] practice of gathering around the word so
[0:31] the order of this was important to where
[0:34] with a Sanctified home and a discipline
[0:36] of gathering around the word we put
[0:37] ourselves in position to fulfill this
[0:39] third part of God's will for us and
[0:42] that's live for others and so we were
[0:43] wanting to see this order as important
[0:46] so when we look at these other three
[0:48] things that we are kind of identifying
[0:50] with us as a church and things we do as
[0:52] Believers of attend church contribute
[0:55] tithes and offerings and support
[0:57] missions we've looked at assembling
[1:00] together we've looked at giving this
[1:02] past Sunday and tonight we want to spend
[1:04] a little bit of time looking at support
[1:05] missions and I just want to say this
[1:08] before we go deeper into it that the
[1:10] order is again important with respect to
[1:12] this that assembling and contributing to
[1:15] get together kind of puts us in the best
[1:17] position then to Faithfully support
[1:19] missions and Sunday morning hopefully
[1:22] we'll take a little bit of time to share
[1:24] with some of the missions projects that
[1:25] our church is currently laboring in and
[1:28] supporting and then even just a
[1:30] statement or two of brother branham's
[1:31] about giving towards that so we'll save
[1:33] that for Wednesday that relates
[1:35] specifically to our churches giving and
[1:37] what we're doing the mission field but
[1:38] we want to tonight before we get into it
[1:41] just mention how these first two things
[1:43] just as sanctifying your home and
[1:45] gathering on the word puts you in the
[1:47] best position to live for others it's
[1:49] really the same image when it comes to
[1:50] us as a church that as we assemble
[1:52] together as a body of Believers and we
[1:54] contribute and we're giving according to
[1:55] the will of the Lord as we have feel led
[1:57] in our heart then that puts us in the
[1:59] best position to support missions
[2:00] because it wouldn't be right to focus on
[2:03] everything else if our home is in order
[2:05] it wouldn't be right to try to serve
[2:07] others when we're not serving at
[2:08] Jerusalem first or charity beginning at
[2:10] home and the Bible says in First
[2:12] Corinthians Chapter 14 verse 40 let let
[2:15] all things be done decently and in order
[2:18] that decently it's honestly and and with
[2:21] a fixed succession and that's how God's
[2:23] will is God's Will has an order and
[2:26] you'll find that order is very very
[2:27] important and sometimes we say oh it's
[2:29] God's will for this and it's God's will
[2:31] for that and and typically God's Will
[2:33] has a time and a season for it to be
[2:35] fulfilled in he has somebody that he's
[2:37] calling to do it and so it's not just
[2:39] well just kind of grab and whatever
[2:41] happens throw something in the air and
[2:43] whatever sticks and that's what I'm
[2:44] going to do but God has an order as to
[2:46] how things are done and it's
[2:48] understanding that order that really
[2:50] gives us a sense of satisfaction when
[2:52] we've done it in order so we want to do
[2:54] things honestly and in God's order God's
[2:56] succession how he's arranged it and do
[2:58] it that way and that's what we're
[3:00] wanting you to think in terms of these
[3:01] six things as we could refer to them all
[3:03] as six things together if you try to
[3:06] find some way to arrange them where it
[3:07] works out just right I think you might
[3:09] find it a challenge to rank them one to
[3:11] six uh but it's just a matter of knowing
[3:14] that with respect to ourselves
[3:16] individually and personally as it
[3:18] relates to our stewardship at home those
[3:19] are the three things that we must do and
[3:21] when it comes to a church or attending
[3:23] church and our service to a body in our
[3:25] participation with the local body the
[3:27] order is important
[3:29] now in looking at the subject of
[3:31] supporting missions or support missions
[3:33] as the will of God for us and let's not
[3:35] lose sight of that that that is
[3:38] what we're looking at is the year in
[3:40] preview is God has told us what his will
[3:43] is so we're having a little bit of a
[3:44] glimpse of what our year holds for us
[3:46] what path he wants us to go in and so
[3:48] let's look at this subject of support
[3:49] missions in Mark chapter 16 verse 15
[3:52] this is a very obvious place to go with
[3:54] respect to this and I wanted to share
[3:57] this just to point out what brother
[3:59] Branham said about this and how that we
[4:01] all come under this burden he said unto
[4:03] them go ye into all the world and preach
[4:05] the gospel to Every Creature that's all
[4:08] the world and so for the gospel to go
[4:10] all to all the world I believe that this
[4:12] responsibility is the responsibility of
[4:15] the body of Christ that it doesn't fall
[4:17] on any one local church and it doesn't
[4:19] fall on any one region or any one
[4:22] country but if you are part of the body
[4:24] of Christ and all of us professing to be
[4:26] part of the body of Christ we should
[4:28] feel the burden of this commission not
[4:30] only to evangelize our community and
[4:32] witness to our friends and be a light to
[4:34] those we come in contact with but we
[4:36] should have a burden about the gospel
[4:38] needing to go to Every Creature to all
[4:40] the world
[4:41] and that there should be some at a very
[4:44] minimum a consciousness of that burden
[4:47] and a prayer that this should be
[4:48] happening because this burden that the
[4:51] gospel should go to all the world is a
[4:53] burden and responsibility for the body
[4:56] of Christ and in the message indictment
[4:58] brother Branham says and he after
[5:00] quoting this scripture he says and if it
[5:01] ain't half reached yet and there are
[5:04] millions die every year that don't even
[5:06] hear the name have never even heard the
[5:08] name of Jesus
[5:09] and this phrase is why I'm using this
[5:11] statement so it's still
[5:13] the general orders it's still a
[5:16] commandment of God
[5:17] does use enough a statement that kind of
[5:20] kind of zeroes in on some things that
[5:23] you could use to really build what this
[5:25] commandment means and he says it's still
[5:27] the general orders it's a commandment of
[5:30] God so he can say it's God's will it's
[5:32] God's will that we go into all the world
[5:33] and preach the gospel that's still a
[5:35] commission that is upon the Christian
[5:37] church if you're a Believer if you have
[5:39] been impacted by this message I believe
[5:41] as long as we're still here going still
[5:43] breathing that we're under that
[5:44] commission and he says it's still the
[5:47] general orders now he's using a military
[5:49] term
[5:50] and the general orders are a set of
[5:52] rules that guide a Sentry Duty in the
[5:55] U.S military maybe our military folk can
[5:57] just amen just a tad louder uh if if we
[6:00] hit it just right but these are a set of
[6:01] rules that would guide the the guards
[6:03] the Sentry Duty for the U.S military and
[6:06] it kind of describes the proper conduct
[6:08] for someone who has that responsibility
[6:11] and the first duty of century Duty or
[6:13] the general orders in the U.S military
[6:15] is I will guard everything within the
[6:18] limits of my post and quit my post only
[6:21] when properly relieved
[6:23] that sounds pretty good doesn't it is
[6:25] this is there a series in the making
[6:26] here I kind of like this I'll guard
[6:29] everything with the within the limits of
[6:31] my post was it what's post to post a
[6:33] duty when brother bam talks about a post
[6:35] of Duty it is talking about it's a
[6:37] military term when you have your post
[6:39] you have the place that you're going to
[6:40] be and post is used in other context but
[6:43] here when he says it's the general
[6:44] orders if that first order is that I
[6:46] will guard everything with the limits of
[6:48] my post and quit only when properly
[6:51] relieved
[6:52] my what a thought when it comes to our
[6:54] post to duty as Believers these things
[6:56] that we've been sharing with you these
[6:57] six things are part of your post to duty
[6:59] they're all part of your general orders
[7:01] it's the will of God for you at your
[7:03] post as a Christian and that post a duty
[7:06] it speaks of an area where regular
[7:08] duties are performed and so we have a
[7:10] poster Duty in the house of God you have
[7:12] a poster duty at home you have a posted
[7:14] Duty as a Believer and brother Ram says
[7:17] that this commission is part of our
[7:18] general orders and I want you to think
[7:19] about this thought of a general order I
[7:22] will guard everything within the limits
[7:23] of my post and I'll only quit my post
[7:25] when properly relieved this church
[7:28] hasn't been relieved yet of this
[7:29] commandment in this general order she's
[7:31] still on Watch and I say this church
[7:33] talk about the Church of Christ the body
[7:35] of Christ she's still under this
[7:37] commission to go in all the world and
[7:38] preach the gospel and we shouldn't quit
[7:40] until relieved of that order
[7:42] relieved of that post the second one is
[7:44] I will obey and I like this because
[7:47] there's general orders and the general
[7:49] orders contain a a
[7:52] specific order so that you can't ever
[7:55] use the general orders as an excuse not
[7:58] to do something you're asked to do he
[7:59] says I will obey my special orders and
[8:02] perform all my duties in a military
[8:04] manner
[8:05] and the church said yes sir right
[8:09] I will obey my special orders and
[8:11] perform all my duties in a military
[8:13] manner there's a way in which we perform
[8:15] our duty it says military manner in
[8:17] other words there's a certain way that
[8:19] you should dress there's a certain way
[8:20] you should act the way a certain way you
[8:22] should perform in a certain way that's
[8:23] expected of those who are in the century
[8:25] Duty and they have a general orders and
[8:28] they're called to guard something
[8:29] they're called to do something and they
[8:31] must do it in a military manner I
[8:33] believe for those of us who are
[8:34] fulfilling God's will for our lives
[8:36] we're only fulfilling it when we have
[8:38] done it in a christ-like manner
[8:40] kind of when we think about obedience
[8:42] and we teach our children what obedience
[8:43] looks like and we tell them that
[8:45] obedience is done um it's done
[8:47] immediately uh completely and cheerfully
[8:50] and that even if you get the job done
[8:52] but you don't do it immediately and you
[8:54] don't do it completely and you don't do
[8:55] it with a smile on your face then you
[8:57] haven't done it right and you can't go
[8:59] back and say well I did it if you didn't
[9:00] do it immediately completely and
[9:02] cheerfully that's not obedience and I
[9:04] think that's kind of a way that we can
[9:05] enforce this idea or look at this idea
[9:08] of what it means to complete something
[9:10] in a military manner there's a way that
[9:12] it has to be done so you can say that it
[9:14] has been done it says and I will obey my
[9:17] special orders within the context of the
[9:20] lives that are represented here today we
[9:22] can say with thus saith the Lord that
[9:24] these six things are God's will for you
[9:26] but many of you will have to carry out
[9:28] special orders many of you will have
[9:30] things that are more specific and even
[9:32] more precise and call you to do certain
[9:33] things and there's other areas in the
[9:35] word of God that a certain calling in
[9:37] your life or certain circumstance in
[9:39] your life is going to ask you to do
[9:40] something more specifically and part of
[9:43] our general orders are to obey the
[9:45] special orders
[9:47] I like that
[9:49] and so this part of this general orders
[9:51] is go into all the world and preach the
[9:53] gospel to every creature
[9:55] and that is what begins us to that's
[9:57] what caused us to begin to think about
[9:59] what missionary work would be and we'll
[10:01] get into the definitions of it here in a
[10:03] moment in Matthew chapter 9 verses 35 to
[10:06] 38 and Jesus went about all the cities
[10:08] and Villages teaching in their
[10:10] synagogues in preaching the gospel of
[10:12] the kingdom and healing every sickness
[10:13] and every disease among the people
[10:16] but when he saw the multitudes he was
[10:18] moved with compassion on them this is a
[10:20] burden now for Souls this is burdened
[10:22] for the sick it's burdened for those who
[10:24] can't hear and his burden is because
[10:27] they fainted and were scattered abroad
[10:28] as sheep having no Shepherd
[10:30] that there was they weren't being
[10:32] properly fed they're not being nurtured
[10:34] they're not being cared for they're not
[10:35] being guided and there's this burden
[10:37] that he had so then he said unto his
[10:39] disciples the Harvest truly is plentius
[10:41] or his Harvest is great but the laborers
[10:44] are few
[10:45] and in light of his burden and his
[10:47] assessment there is a need that needs to
[10:49] be addressed there's a harvest that is
[10:51] ripe and there need to be laborers
[10:52] laboring in that Harvest and there's a
[10:55] great labor but the Harvest but there's
[10:57] no labors he says pray ye therefore the
[10:59] lord of the Harvest that he will send
[11:02] forth laborers into his Harvest
[11:05] and so we are to go into all the world
[11:07] and preach the gospel and then Christ
[11:10] sees multitudes hurting and lost and
[11:12] without a shepherd and needing to be
[11:13] taught and needing to be clothed and fed
[11:15] and cared for spiritually and he says
[11:18] because of this great need we ought to
[11:19] pray that there'll be laborers sent into
[11:22] this work to labor for those who have no
[11:25] Shepherd who are scattered abroad and
[11:27] who are fainting and it's the sending
[11:29] forth labors into his Harvest that I
[11:31] want to use as a description of
[11:34] missionary work or as we say support
[11:37] missions and say in support missions it
[11:40] doesn't mean we try to find the missions
[11:41] brother Travis and I saw a mission here
[11:43] recently there's the oldest one in
[11:45] Arizona and so it's not trying to find
[11:47] one of these beautifully ornate missions
[11:50] that we can find out in the desert
[11:51] somewhere and said well what mission are
[11:53] we supporting is it the Our Lady of the
[11:55] dunes or is it Our Lady of the of the
[11:57] Saguaro what what which what mission do
[11:59] we want to support but missions as
[12:01] missionary work
[12:03] that's what we're trying to support
[12:05] and a missionary is one sent on a
[12:07] mission to spread the word to a new
[12:10] region or to a people
[12:11] and so when we think missionary work and
[12:14] just to delineate among Ministries and
[12:16] things we think about an evangelist I
[12:18] know that to us an evangelist is
[12:19] somebody who moves around a lot and
[12:21] sweats a lot right and Travis preaches
[12:23] at different churches we say oh he's an
[12:25] evangelist and so we're looking more at
[12:26] the manner in which someone preaches as
[12:28] opposed to the manner or even the gift
[12:30] they hold but evangelism a domestic
[12:32] evangelist here in the states who travel
[12:34] through and preach at a lot of different
[12:35] churches he has a different burden he
[12:37] has a different uh uh role that he plays
[12:39] within the body of Christ and and he is
[12:42] preaching at churches that are already
[12:43] established and works that are already
[12:45] thriving and doing the work of God and
[12:47] part of that Church's responsibility and
[12:49] having that evangelist come in is so
[12:51] that he can minister to the needs as a
[12:53] minister to the body of Christ the needs
[12:55] that are in that church but then also
[12:57] that church is supporting that work and
[12:58] that evangelist it gives them an
[13:00] offering and supports them and moves
[13:01] them on his way so it's the body of
[13:03] Christ working together and those things
[13:04] but that that labor is different than
[13:07] one who would go overseas or go
[13:09] somewhere where the word isn't
[13:11] established and where it hasn't been
[13:12] spread and then begin to find and work
[13:15] in an area to produce or promote and
[13:17] establish kind of the churches that we
[13:20] have so often and frequently here in the
[13:21] United States that evangelists can visit
[13:23] so missionary work is different in that
[13:26] regard
[13:27] and that's what we're referring to when
[13:28] we say missions I think of my Uncle
[13:31] Dennis when it comes to a missionary
[13:33] I so admire his gift I admire his burden
[13:36] I admire his labor in the gospel
[13:39] and his what he'll do is he'll go right
[13:42] now he's been spending a lot of a lot of
[13:44] attention in Bulgaria and our church
[13:46] here has supported the the printing of
[13:48] church age books and the Bulgarian
[13:49] language through his through his labor
[13:51] and his work that he's doing and he just
[13:53] goes to somewhere and he tries to find
[13:55] somebody who's a Christian or somebody
[13:57] who believes or finds someone's to talk
[13:59] to and then he just starts talking to
[14:01] him tries to build up a relationship and
[14:02] just sees where the Lord's going to take
[14:04] it
[14:05] he's not just pulling out his book and
[14:07] saying all right there's a message
[14:08] Church in Sophia there's a message
[14:10] church here this is a message Church
[14:11] there and just calls the pastors or
[14:13] emails and say hey I'm going to be in
[14:15] the area could I hold you a meeting
[14:17] I've known preachers do that they
[14:19] actually email somebody overseas and say
[14:21] hey I was thinking about coming uh it's
[14:23] going to be in the country and and then
[14:25] the person says well if you're going to
[14:26] be in the country why don't we schedule
[14:27] you for this date and then they plan
[14:29] their trip right they're only just doing
[14:32] a little bit of a fishing Expedition
[14:33] that's not missions that's fishing
[14:36] that's Visions but we're talking about
[14:38] people who go somewhere where there's
[14:40] nothing and just say Lord show me
[14:42] somebody who's faithful show me somebody
[14:43] I can work with and the testimonies that
[14:45] brother Dennis McGeary can share is just
[14:48] phenomenal it'll raise your faith it'll
[14:50] encourage you to see that God is still
[14:52] working in a book of Acts way
[14:54] because that's really what the Acts of
[14:55] the Apostles were it wasn't established
[14:57] it was an established churches in their
[15:00] Capstone it was establishing churches
[15:01] period
[15:03] and that's what real Apostolic work is
[15:05] is brother banham takes that idea of a
[15:07] missionary and he says it's really an
[15:09] apostle an apostle scripture he's a
[15:11] delegate it's a messenger one sent with
[15:14] orders
[15:15] and those apostles were sent out to
[15:17] establish the Christian church to
[15:19] establish the faith and that's what
[15:21] missions refers to is spreading the
[15:23] gospel in an area where it hasn't taken
[15:25] full root or maybe is just being
[15:27] established or if I can take it a step
[15:29] further where there's a need in
[15:31] supporting that work and those who are
[15:33] doing it
[15:34] and the message convinced and then
[15:36] concerned brother Brown says I want to
[15:38] say that the greatest call there is in
[15:40] the earth to my opinion is the mission
[15:42] Fields anyone who is a missionary is an
[15:45] apostle for the word Apostle means one
[15:46] cent and the word missionary is one cent
[15:49] so they're both the same word or used
[15:51] the same and why they ever preferred to
[15:52] call themselves missionaries I don't
[15:54] know but it's a good word or apostles
[15:57] and so I know maybe Apostolic order and
[16:00] apostles can cause some people to get a
[16:01] little bit leery because there's been
[16:03] those self uh professed Apostles who've
[16:06] tried to establish certain structures
[16:08] and orders here I'm familiar with some
[16:09] in North America that were the Apostle
[16:12] and so they had all their churches that
[16:14] kind of they were over and they
[16:15] controlled and all the tithes went to
[16:17] the Apostle and so maybe there's been
[16:19] some mechanics of apostleship and
[16:21] apostles that could kind of give us a
[16:23] little bit of a suspicion or a little
[16:25] uneasy feeling about it and it's maybe I
[16:28] would want to point that out necessarily
[16:30] to bring it into our view but I'll
[16:31] mention it just to say this there are
[16:34] true apostles who are doing the work of
[16:36] the Lord in a missionary sense and
[16:38] brother I'm saying who we call a mission
[16:39] is really someone who's like an apostle
[16:41] someone who sent with orders to
[16:43] establish things and introduce things
[16:46] and he says it's the greatest call there
[16:48] is on Earth in his opinions to the
[16:49] mission fields
[16:52] and the sermon Lord show us the father
[16:54] and it suffices us he says back to the
[16:56] missionary offering we're greatly
[16:59] appreciative of that we know that when
[17:01] you're doing missionary work you're
[17:02] doing exactly what the Lord said is that
[17:05] right
[17:05] for he said go you into all the world
[17:07] and preach the gospel to every creature
[17:09] and that's the general orders of Christ
[17:11] and with and know then that that's right
[17:15] we can't go wrong when we're doing
[17:17] missionary work
[17:18] well that's to me that's really good if
[17:20] somebody's just in a run of doing a lot
[17:23] of bad things and a lot of bad luck and
[17:25] you want to figure out how to get out of
[17:26] the rut I mean you could pretty much you
[17:28] could look at this and say well all I
[17:30] one thing I know I can do is do what's
[17:32] right
[17:33] and start and pull myself out of that
[17:36] rut he says you can't go wrong when
[17:37] doing Mission work one place he said the
[17:39] word admissions is always right
[17:42] that's remarkable to think about this
[17:44] that he's he's putting this in one sense
[17:45] and he's in no way being dismissive of
[17:47] what we do here it's in no way and being
[17:49] dismissive of assembling ourselves
[17:50] together and contributing or sanctifying
[17:53] our home and gathering around the word
[17:55] and living for others you realize that
[17:57] it's all those things that kind of feed
[17:59] into this sense of having a burden for
[18:01] Missions and wanting to serve others and
[18:03] do something for other people and you
[18:04] realize I can't go wrong when I'm doing
[18:06] this
[18:08] because the word admissions are always
[18:09] right
[18:10] and so when it comes to missionary work
[18:12] I may be able to I think here in a
[18:14] moment we might touch on a few areas I
[18:15] realize now I didn't put together a
[18:17] slide for that I think we'll be okay as
[18:19] we run through it but the body of Christ
[18:21] through local churches and that's kind
[18:23] of the way that we have some sense of
[18:25] community and not necessarily
[18:27] organization but affiliation and
[18:30] camaraderie and laboring together the
[18:31] body of Christ through local churches
[18:33] that's the way that this responsibility
[18:36] is fulfilled
[18:38] and I believe that every local church
[18:39] when I say local it speaks of the body
[18:41] of Christ around the world that has some
[18:43] sort of local Gathering or symboling has
[18:45] some part of responsibility in this work
[18:47] to some level we should be conscious of
[18:50] and burdened by the work of getting the
[18:53] word out to those who haven't heard it
[18:56] and this opportunity
[18:58] to spread the gospel or spread the word
[19:00] to a new region to our people is
[19:02] obviously much greater
[19:04] uh in in areas overseas it's much
[19:07] greater in areas where Christianity
[19:09] hasn't been established there's a lot of
[19:10] Works taking place in in uh Muslim
[19:14] nations and places where there isn't
[19:15] Christianity uh going back to the labor
[19:18] that brother Dennis has been doing for a
[19:19] number of decades he was one of the
[19:21] first going into countries after
[19:24] communism fell and now they're being
[19:26] more welcoming to uh they could have
[19:28] Ministries come in he's been doing it
[19:29] for decades since the fall of Communism
[19:31] in some of these Eastern European
[19:32] countries that's where the opportunities
[19:34] present themselves but I'll say that the
[19:37] opportunity to support missions is much
[19:39] greater than just going overseas to
[19:41] preach
[19:43] and for some of the ministering Brethren
[19:45] here I know have done this and continue
[19:47] to do it the the few that are here
[19:49] tonight I know you've all labored in
[19:50] missionary work and gone overseas and
[19:52] and even uh brother Manuel you even know
[19:55] what it's like to start with a young
[19:56] church and be one that's there
[19:58] establishing things and getting a church
[20:00] started there in Mexico and so uh
[20:02] brother Loyola I know it's been overseas
[20:04] and that going over to preach I could
[20:06] say this and I don't mean to offend
[20:07] anybody but just going over to preach
[20:09] isn't being a missionary because I've
[20:10] done that a lot and I ain't a missionary
[20:14] of course because I'm going to places
[20:16] where there's churches that are already
[20:17] established and they have Bibles and
[20:19] they know the message
[20:20] but the opportunities are more than we
[20:22] have to think bigger than supporting
[20:24] missions as just paying for brother
[20:26] Airlines brother Aaron's air brother
[20:27] Airlines okay there's a brother Airlines
[20:30] praying for brother pilate to fly the
[20:32] airlines over there to go preach
[20:34] somewhere it's more than that there's
[20:35] more opportunities in that
[20:37] in the sermon the end time brother bam
[20:39] says I'm so happy to be here brother
[20:40] Moore was just telling me that they had
[20:42] taken up an offering for missionary work
[20:44] to be given over to me for missionary
[20:46] work and brother Branham in the few
[20:48] places I say few but in the several
[20:49] places he refers to this he's always
[20:51] very careful to say I'll use it for that
[20:54] and I'm not going to use this for myself
[20:55] personally even and I don't know if we
[20:58] are going to read this maybe Sunday
[20:59] morning but he kind of makes this
[21:00] comment some places that if somebody
[21:02] needs a sandwich or somebody needs a
[21:03] meal I'm not going to take it out of
[21:05] this I'll use my own money for that
[21:06] every penny going towards missions is
[21:09] going to go to that not even for these
[21:10] meetings we're doing here he's saying
[21:12] it's going to go towards that
[21:14] and he says thank you may God bless you
[21:16] I just don't know how to say it it's
[21:18] just something about missionary that I
[21:20] just love it and I just know that you're
[21:23] doing God's will when you give to
[21:25] missions
[21:26] so now you can't go wrong when doing
[21:29] missionary work now we can't all do
[21:31] missionary work but we can't go wrong
[21:33] when we're giving to missions if I could
[21:36] put it that way and I know maybe I'm
[21:37] using a different language but let's
[21:38] just put this way you're in God's will
[21:40] when you give to missions and you ain't
[21:42] wrong if you're in God's will
[21:44] that is right it's not fair that one
[21:46] person hear the gospel twice when
[21:47] somebody hasn't heard it once
[21:49] everybody should hear the gospel at
[21:51] least once and I want to do my part to
[21:53] try to take the gospel to everybody that
[21:54] I know how every place so it's kind of
[21:56] giving you idea of what he thought
[21:58] missions was it wasn't just going to
[22:00] establish conventions establish meetings
[22:02] and established churches let's go into
[22:03] those places where people can hear the
[22:06] gospel for the first time used to be on
[22:08] the difference difference of the
[22:09] remunerations of the meeting and what I
[22:11] had left over I'd give it to charity
[22:12] organizations and so forth now I have
[22:15] nothing at all against them not at all
[22:17] and I think they're all fine every one
[22:18] of them from Salvation Army and
[22:20] Volunteers of America the Red Cross
[22:21] polio drives and many things like that
[22:23] it's good to give to those things but I
[22:26] thought the people that comes to my
[22:27] meetings were people who are usually
[22:30] poor people and they're interested in
[22:32] the kingdom of God
[22:34] while much of the world of the people to
[22:36] the common run of the people that
[22:38] doesn't go to church businessmen and so
[22:39] forth write checks for them drives and
[22:41] so forth for thousands and thousands of
[22:43] dollars while poor missionary suffers
[22:45] with the lack
[22:47] truly unique the way he's viewing this
[22:50] that there's a lot of causes that get
[22:52] all the tension and businesses are
[22:53] behind it and they support it he says
[22:55] but the poor people that come to my
[22:56] missions are to my meetings have a
[22:58] burden to see that the word get out and
[23:00] they can't give as much
[23:01] and he says to all these thousands of
[23:03] dollars are going to these tax
[23:04] deductible organizations and things he
[23:06] says while the poor missionary suffers
[23:07] in fact we know that we like to see
[23:09] everybody well we like to see people
[23:11] that's hungry be fed but you know the
[23:14] soul is the most important thing of
[23:15] anything in the mortal
[23:17] that's why missionary work isn't isn't
[23:20] uh
[23:21] building hospitals it's not building
[23:23] schools it's not providing medical
[23:24] equipment those things can be ancillary
[23:27] and the other and even providing food
[23:29] isn't missionary work but those are
[23:31] other ways that can be done things that
[23:33] can be done in a thriving missionary
[23:35] work where you can provide food you can
[23:37] provide medical supplies you can provide
[23:39] toothbrushes and toothpaste and things
[23:41] like that or maybe toothpaste might be
[23:43] better term to use just to encourage
[23:45] keeping them right
[23:47] but there's uh there's things that can
[23:49] go along with it that's part of it but
[23:52] the goal isn't just to you know a can
[23:54] drive and food drives and clothing and
[23:56] things like that the goal is the soul
[23:58] but you know the soul is the most
[24:00] important thing of anything in the
[24:01] Mortal because that's the thing that
[24:03] lasts forever
[24:04] I believe that every Christian is
[24:06] obligated to be a missionary so I take
[24:08] it back I am a missionary
[24:10] I am a missionary just not in the way we
[24:13] were thinking about it a moment ago he
[24:14] says I believe that every Christian is
[24:15] obligated to be a missionary I believe
[24:17] every Christian is obligated now not so
[24:20] much as you have to go over in the old
[24:22] countries and preach or something
[24:24] but if you can't go you can help send
[24:26] somebody else what you do to send
[24:29] somebody else
[24:35] I thought I had this statement in here
[24:38] where he says if if all you can do is
[24:40] just pray
[24:42] I think you've probably heard those
[24:43] statements before you can't send someone
[24:45] pray for them
[24:47] so it's not that you have to go over in
[24:49] Old countries or preach or something but
[24:50] if you can't go you can help send
[24:53] somebody else it's what you do to send
[24:55] somebody else
[24:58] and so there's a lot of different ways I
[24:59] could say that we support missions and
[25:01] I'd put it this way by praying
[25:03] primarily praying
[25:05] praying for and then providing for
[25:07] missionary work and those that are
[25:08] working in missionary work which would
[25:10] be missionaries
[25:12] and there's different areas of support
[25:15] that in these different areas that I
[25:16] want to share different things that you
[25:18] can do to support but they all kind of
[25:20] relate to the establishment of the word
[25:22] or getting the word to the people or
[25:24] keeping the word before the people
[25:25] making it available for them
[25:27] and here are just a few things that we
[25:29] could do as a church or things that you
[25:31] can do as a Believer and I say that
[25:34] since our church is new and we've only
[25:35] been here not even two and a half years
[25:37] and that for many of you for many years
[25:39] you've been supporting missionaries
[25:40] supporting Mission Works and there's a
[25:42] lot of wonderful missionary missionaries
[25:45] within the message and uh labors within
[25:47] the masses that are doing things from
[25:48] Bible Believers to present Truth
[25:50] Ministries and there's a lot of
[25:52] different ones you may already be
[25:53] supporting and so as you've had this uh
[25:55] Habit and discipline of already doing it
[25:57] I think that's wonderful so we're not
[25:59] trying to divert your attention away
[26:00] from that but even in those causes and
[26:03] what's being done in those Ministries
[26:04] and and Mission Endeavors for us also as
[26:08] a local church if we're going to be
[26:09] supporting missions or missionary work
[26:12] we're going to be praying
[26:13] and we're going to be providing for the
[26:15] spread of the message and the providing
[26:17] for the missionary work that's being
[26:18] done and the ways that we can do it if
[26:20] your financial resources that are needed
[26:22] takes Financial Resources to send
[26:24] missionaries and the most effective
[26:26] missionaries are the ones that are
[26:28] already there
[26:29] right if you're wanting to evangelize uh
[26:33] some of the tribes in Tanzania I would
[26:36] be the worst missionary to have do that
[26:38] the fact that there may be you know a
[26:41] cannibal hiding in a hole in the ground
[26:42] it might just be enough for me to say
[26:44] yeah I don't know they could stream it
[26:45] if they want I mean is it the word
[26:48] aren't if they're elect to it they're
[26:50] gonna hear it right so why do I need to
[26:52] go and risk life and limb and and this
[26:54] Peril by preaching the gospel but
[26:57] there's financial resources needed for
[26:58] those missionaries that are in these
[27:00] countries already living there among the
[27:03] people even of the of the language of
[27:04] the people that are uh spreading the
[27:07] gospel and going into regions and areas
[27:09] where the message hasn't gone and these
[27:11] Financial Resources many times are just
[27:13] it's the monthly salary that that man
[27:15] needs because it goes away for hours at
[27:17] a time and leaves his family behind he
[27:19] can't work other jobs and so sometimes
[27:21] they need a salary and you think man a
[27:24] salary well listen they can get on get
[27:25] by with a lot uh less than we can here
[27:28] and so for just a few hundred dollars
[27:30] sometimes you could support a missionary
[27:32] and he can have that as a monthly salary
[27:34] and that's kind of his he knows he's got
[27:36] enough to put food on the table and pay
[27:37] his rent or the different things they
[27:39] might have responsibility to do and then
[27:40] he can drive out into the bush and
[27:42] travel different places and evangelize
[27:44] and so a lot of the costs that are
[27:46] associated that Finance given and
[27:48] Financial Resources supports beside
[27:50] Beyond monthly set monthly salary is all
[27:52] the transportation costs to buy a
[27:54] motorcycle have a vehicle gas and
[27:56] different things like that and repairs
[27:57] that's a ways where money or financial
[28:00] resources can actually support and
[28:02] provide for missionary work
[28:05] and then as a missionary we would be
[28:06] going out
[28:07] and as he would be going into areas to
[28:10] spread the message and find converts
[28:12] once this happens missionaries establish
[28:14] churches
[28:15] and when they establish this church
[28:17] they're doing it where none existed
[28:18] before
[28:19] and so they're not they're they're
[28:21] having to find places to meet they're
[28:23] having to build buildings they're having
[28:25] to get all the tools and and the
[28:28] resources the physical resources that
[28:29] they need to have church and they need
[28:31] uh they need chairs and they need pulpit
[28:33] and they need a they need a building
[28:35] they need a roof and I've preached in
[28:37] churches that were made out of mud I've
[28:38] preached in places uh that are just kind
[28:41] of cobbled together and there's things
[28:42] that they do to have a facility and
[28:44] that's a way that you can support
[28:45] missions by helping with the
[28:47] establishment of the actual building or
[28:49] the building of a church
[28:50] and so where there's a need there's a
[28:53] need to build the new churches
[28:55] and then there's a need to teach the
[28:57] Ministries that are being raised up and
[28:59] those that are faithful sometimes they
[29:00] leave organization or they're just
[29:02] getting this call to preach and you have
[29:03] this need to teach new ministers
[29:06] and I would say that this for me
[29:07] personally and I don't often just try to
[29:09] give you actually most often and
[29:12] hopefully nearly always avoid giving you
[29:14] my opinion or my personal burden on
[29:16] things but for me this has been the most
[29:18] remarkable paradigm shift for me when it
[29:20] comes to missions I'd say most
[29:22] importantly the Believers need the
[29:24] message
[29:25] and they need it in their language or a
[29:27] language they can understand
[29:29] and that to me is kind of the end game
[29:31] the Translating the printing and the
[29:33] Distributing of the message in these
[29:35] areas where someone has gone broken new
[29:38] ground found converts and Believers and
[29:41] now they establish a church and what
[29:43] they need is they need the message for
[29:45] themselves
[29:46] when I first had the opportunity to go
[29:48] overseas and minister
[29:49] I was overwhelmed with the burden
[29:52] and the needs that existed and I did it
[29:54] a few times I remember having this sense
[29:56] of well they we need we need people
[29:59] going back on a monthly basis we need
[30:01] someone always there and you see the
[30:03] needs and the burden and I remember I
[30:04] had in my mind how how often can I go
[30:07] back or how often can we be going back
[30:09] and just for a guy like me with the
[30:11] limit of exposure I had maybe it was a
[30:13] little bit overwhelming and I remember I
[30:15] was having lunch with brother Biscoe and
[30:17] we were just sitting down fellowship and
[30:18] he began to share with me his his vision
[30:20] and burden and missions
[30:22] and as he was sharing it it just for me
[30:24] I had this tremendous paradigm shift
[30:26] because he was saying what we like to do
[30:28] is go to an area and get the message in
[30:31] the people's hands and so we established
[30:32] printing stations we as we translate
[30:34] message and we duplicate and we do all
[30:36] these things and then a light bulb went
[30:38] on I thought oh of course
[30:41] that's all they need
[30:43] because that's all we have too that like
[30:46] that's the that's the real heart of why
[30:48] we're here is we had access to the word
[30:51] of God and we heard that voice and it
[30:53] changed things for us and we have the
[30:54] privilege of continuing to feed on it
[30:55] and I knew then that just because the
[30:58] color of my skin or the my use of the
[31:00] English language didn't make me more
[31:02] qualified than the man of God that was
[31:05] being raised up in these other countries
[31:06] the only difference was I had nearly
[31:09] 1200 sermons in a language I could
[31:11] perfectly understand and he may not have
[31:14] any
[31:15] and I realized that if he could get all
[31:17] that I have his ministry will be far
[31:19] greater and far effective than mine
[31:20] could ever be
[31:22] and so for me really I really desire to
[31:25] see these other things done and work
[31:26] together to establish these things
[31:28] whether it be monthly salaries from
[31:30] missionaries whether it be building
[31:31] churches but at the end of the day if we
[31:33] can just at least get the message into
[31:35] people's hands they'll be just as rich
[31:38] as we are here in America
[31:41] because they really need the message
[31:43] brother babe says you're doing God's
[31:44] will when you give to missions we're
[31:46] doing God's will if we can support a
[31:48] work in any one of these areas he says
[31:50] you're doing God's will when you give to
[31:52] missions when you lend support when you
[31:53] do something in any one of these areas
[31:55] whether it be sending missionaries
[31:57] building churches providing the message
[31:59] in their language duplicating
[32:00] translating there's a lot of different
[32:02] things that we could do as Believers to
[32:04] work to support missions
[32:08] and so that's
[32:09] uh I think that's pretty
[32:13] pretty clear on it's God's will for us
[32:15] it may beg some more questions on just
[32:17] exactly what does missions work look
[32:19] like
[32:20] but it for me it's that laboring in a
[32:23] field that is still being cultivated and
[32:26] being established and we may not have
[32:28] opportunities to support Works where
[32:30] people are going into where there hasn't
[32:31] been any message before and maybe
[32:33] there's already some message churches
[32:35] that might have needs and may have need
[32:37] a new roof or they may need a new
[32:39] building and those are different ways
[32:40] that we can support it but one thing I
[32:42] definitely still see the need is to get
[32:44] the message in people's languages
[32:46] the labor that brother Paula Fontaine
[32:48] engaged in for a number of years he
[32:50] caught the burden and the vision of
[32:51] getting the entire message translated
[32:53] into Spanish and he made it a singular
[32:55] goal and over many different years I
[32:57] can't remember just how long it took but
[32:58] a few years ago they finally finished
[33:00] translating the entire message into
[33:02] Spanish and now it's available for
[33:04] anybody that speaks Spanish if they can
[33:06] get it digitally if they want to print
[33:07] it it's available the Believers there in
[33:10] in the Congo as Shekinah and brother
[33:13] Richard dioka and the vision they had
[33:14] with Shekinah Publications to get the
[33:16] entire message translated into French
[33:18] and so you have these major languages
[33:21] that have many many countries that speak
[33:23] those things these are critical moves of
[33:25] God to get the the word of God in the
[33:28] language of the people and these are
[33:30] ways these are ways that we can support
[33:32] somehow some way be involved through
[33:34] prayer or providing some resources in
[33:38] these areas is missions work and I hope
[33:40] that you that gives you a little bit to
[33:43] go by when I say support missions
[33:46] a lot of things you can do as a family
[33:47] whether it be to save money or every
[33:48] night when you do your devotions pray
[33:50] for missionaries pray for Mission work
[33:52] if you want to know the needs we could
[33:54] be in a better habit at the church just
[33:56] saying we should be praying for this one
[33:57] and praying for that one
[33:59] and sharing these things with you
[34:00] because I think we'll grow as a church
[34:02] if we do it
[34:04] grow in the right ways
[34:06] and so let me just use a few things to
[34:10] kind of sum up this thought
[34:12] and I think I think it fits really well
[34:14] with this idea of support missions but
[34:15] we read Psalms 37 23
[34:19] maybe in the first service on this
[34:21] subject the steps of a good man are
[34:22] ordered by the Lord
[34:24] and he delighteth in his way it speaks
[34:25] of how even a powerful man his steps
[34:28] must be according to God's will or even
[34:31] a man of strength can succumb to
[34:32] weakness
[34:34] that the steps of a good man a powerful
[34:35] man is still his steps are ordered by
[34:38] the Lord and that is his protection that
[34:40] is ultimately his his strength or his
[34:42] buttress the very thing that's going to
[34:44] lift him up the steps of a good man were
[34:46] ordered by the Lord and he delighteth in
[34:47] his way the will of God is our source of
[34:50] happiness
[34:51] it is our source of satisfaction and
[34:54] inspiration that when we're doing the
[34:56] will of God that's when you're going to
[34:57] be the most happy
[34:58] it's not when you're making as much
[34:59] money as you think you ought to make
[35:01] when you're gonna be the most happy it's
[35:02] when you know you're doing the will of
[35:03] God and I could testify to this as a
[35:05] family right sister Elizabeth that we
[35:07] are as happy as we are today because we
[35:09] know we're in the perfect will of God
[35:11] and we constantly tell each other we're
[35:13] just happy we're where God wants us to
[35:15] be we're happy doing what God wants us
[35:17] to do and your greatest source of joy is
[35:20] going to be finding contentment in the
[35:22] place that he puts you in doing what it
[35:24] is he wants you to do
[35:26] and as believers
[35:28] we have different responsibilities we
[35:30] have this order we have this place that
[35:31] we need to walk in and that's going to
[35:33] be the source of your joy and a sermon
[35:35] by faith Moses how many been using their
[35:37] Psalms devotional you don't have to
[35:39] raise your hands you may give me a
[35:40] complex oh wow look look everybody's
[35:42] using it well if you read it yesterday
[35:43] you'll recognize this and by faith Moses
[35:45] but the real inspiration comes by doing
[35:48] the will of God whether it's just a one
[35:50] or just a handful
[35:52] real inspiration comes by doing the will
[35:54] of God if you're kind of in these
[35:56] doldrums you don't feel inspired you
[35:58] don't feel motivation you just don't
[36:00] feel like you have much enthusiasm
[36:01] there's just no there's not really any
[36:03] growing or groaning to do more you don't
[36:06] have that kind of that oomph that you
[36:08] need he says inspiration comes by doing
[36:09] the will of God
[36:11] we're going to find inspiration we're
[36:13] going to find Delight we're going to
[36:14] find pleasure in doing the will of God
[36:15] whether it's a big church or small
[36:16] Church it matters not whether he's a
[36:18] great eloquent speaker just the man that
[36:20] hardly knows his ABCs it doesn't matter
[36:22] it depends on the message that he's
[36:24] bringing whether it's inspired by the
[36:25] word of God or is it inspired by
[36:27] intellectuals conceptions of human
[36:29] inspiration
[36:31] but I believe we could take from this
[36:32] that real inspiration comes by doing the
[36:34] will of God
[36:35] as brother Branham told us that when it
[36:37] comes to going into all the world and
[36:39] preach the gospel it's still the general
[36:40] orders and he comes back to it later in
[36:43] that one statement we read where he says
[36:44] it's the general orders to do this to go
[36:46] into all the world and preach the gospel
[36:48] it's the orders that he gave the church
[36:50] it's the things that we steal are
[36:51] burdened by and must do together with
[36:54] that and these other things we've been
[36:55] mentioning as Believers we have duties
[36:57] and responsibilities
[36:59] and these duties and responsibilities
[37:01] that we have as Believers and if even if
[37:03] it's just these six things I've
[37:04] mentioned it gives us Direction every
[37:06] day of Our Lives
[37:08] it kind of gives us if you want to call
[37:10] it a spiritual bucket list if you want
[37:11] to call it a spiritual to-do list if
[37:14] it's a um an eternal day minder or
[37:16] something you've got something that's
[37:17] reminding you of the things that you
[37:18] must be doing and that you ought to be
[37:20] doing as a Believer these duties and
[37:22] responsibilities and these six things
[37:25] are part of God's will for us therefore
[37:26] it's the source of our inspiration and
[37:29] it is things that are not without
[37:31] purpose they're not without some outcome
[37:33] or consequence God isn't asking us to do
[37:36] any one of these without a promise to
[37:38] benefit and bless us to give us some
[37:40] sort of guidance to lead us and guide us
[37:42] brother Banner the sermon total
[37:44] deliverances says I wonder this morning
[37:46] as Christians if we've yielded our own
[37:48] will and yielded ourselves so complete
[37:51] to God till God can trust us the place
[37:53] that he has put us
[37:55] wow we're yielded enough of to our own
[37:58] will yield ourselves so completely God
[38:00] until he can trust us in the place that
[38:02] he's put us I wonder this morning of
[38:04] myself if I could be so yielded to God
[38:06] till God could trust me could trust
[38:07] brother Neville could trust our trustee
[38:09] board our Deacon board or our members of
[38:11] our church we all have a place and we
[38:14] got a duty
[38:16] we all do
[38:18] from the from the young men on this
[38:19] front row to the young ladies to my left
[38:21] they all have a place that we all have a
[38:23] place we have a part and can we be so
[38:26] yielded to this
[38:28] can we be so given over to his will can
[38:30] we be so uh completely trusting of God
[38:33] that he can trust us where he's put us
[38:35] because we have a place and we have a
[38:37] duty and we want to be about doing that
[38:41] brother Bram says in the sermon
[38:43] Witnesses I'd kind of held this quote
[38:45] didn't know just exactly where it fit in
[38:46] I'm just going to use it to kind of sum
[38:47] this up before we get to our text here
[38:49] he says seek ye first the kingdom of God
[38:52] that's what each one of these things
[38:54] becomes gasoline to or direction to a
[38:57] momentum to is seeking first the kingdom
[38:59] of God because think about it we say oh
[39:01] seek ye first the kingdom of God a lot
[39:03] of us can say well what does that even
[39:04] mean
[39:05] what does it mean to seek first the
[39:06] kingdom of God well there I've shared
[39:09] with you six things that are ways that
[39:11] we seek first the kingdom of God because
[39:13] there's something that we're giving to
[39:15] God and each one of those we're giving
[39:16] it to him first we're letting him have
[39:18] the preeminence
[39:20] and brother bear says seek ye first the
[39:21] kingdom of God and the sermon Witnesses
[39:23] he says have you ever witnessed that to
[39:24] be the truth put God first pay your
[39:27] tithes first pay everything first pay
[39:31] God pray first at morning pray all
[39:34] through the day give God the first place
[39:36] and everything you'll be a witness
[39:40] wow you want to live for others
[39:42] you wanna you wanna be a you want to
[39:44] support missions he's given us the
[39:45] template
[39:46] put God first pay your tithes first pay
[39:48] everything first pay God pray first at
[39:51] the morning pray all through the day
[39:52] give God the first place and everything
[39:54] then you'll be a witness
[39:56] that's how you seek first the kingdom of
[39:58] God and then seeking first the king God
[40:00] your life without even you having to
[40:02] open your mouth is a testimony
[40:04] is a witness of the things of God we
[40:06] have to realize that all of us are
[40:07] ambassadors of this message that in the
[40:10] things we say the things we do the
[40:12] things we allow to have the preeminence
[40:13] the things we pursue the things we talk
[40:15] about all these things or are part of us
[40:17] witnessing the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[40:21] and these things are God's will for us
[40:24] this year
[40:26] and if we'll take a look for a few
[40:28] moments
[40:29] if you have your Bibles handy we'll be
[40:31] looking at a few of these scriptures in
[40:33] the Book of Joshua
[40:36] in chapter six as we read those first
[40:39] five verses Joshua the book in The Book
[40:40] of Joshua Israel
[40:42] conquers Jericho
[40:44] and I want you to
[40:47] identify this element
[40:49] that conquering Jericho was the explicit
[40:52] expressed will of God that he told them
[40:55] to go to Jericho March around these
[40:57] walls so this was something that they
[40:59] were told to do this wasn't Joshua just
[41:01] saying oh well look this is the first
[41:03] one here this must be what we need to do
[41:05] but God said to do this this was part of
[41:07] the plan this is part of the vision part
[41:09] of the mission
[41:10] and as we read already the conquest of
[41:12] Jericho was very complex
[41:15] you could take some of the statements
[41:17] that are in the word of God and think
[41:18] that well why didn't God just kind of
[41:21] Thunder out and Tear Down the Walls and
[41:23] kill everybody before they got there
[41:24] there's certainly Miracles we see in the
[41:25] Old Testament where everyone in the camp
[41:27] is just dead or everyone is just flat or
[41:29] giant hailstones fall down but God told
[41:31] uh the Israelites to do things to make a
[41:34] motion to obey a certain order and I say
[41:37] it actually is kind of very unique it's
[41:39] a detailed it's complex it's repetitive
[41:43] right I mean it seems I know the
[41:45] numerologists kind of get really excited
[41:47] about the story but we're going to walk
[41:49] around once for six days and then on the
[41:51] seventh day we're gonna walk around uh
[41:53] these seven times around the wall and it
[41:55] seems to be it almost seems unnecessary
[41:57] because God is certainly able to do do
[42:01] more and it's even counterintuitive
[42:02] right but it was God's will
[42:06] and one thing I want you to take to
[42:07] heart tonight is we've mentioned these
[42:09] things and we've even tried in terms of
[42:10] the book of haggai we weren't trying to
[42:13] make the emphasis to build the Temple of
[42:14] the Lord but the emphasis was that was
[42:16] an analogy of doing the will of God or
[42:19] leaving the will of God undone that's
[42:21] what I'm trying to emphasize tonight
[42:22] that them conquering Jericho was the
[42:25] will of God and he wanted them to do it
[42:26] a particular way and in doing it that
[42:28] way they were fulfilling God's Will and
[42:30] it brought about a great victory
[42:32] and what I want you to take to heart in
[42:34] this is even in these things we've
[42:35] shared and other things that you hear in
[42:37] the word of God that are very detailed
[42:39] and precise and there are general orders
[42:40] and the things that we ought to do or
[42:42] even in the special orders that God
[42:44] gives us orders he establishes a
[42:46] standard he tells us how that we ought
[42:48] to act he gives commands in order that
[42:50] we might grow in his grace
[42:53] he does it for for momentum he does it
[42:55] for progress and God's will is used to
[42:59] challenge us and he asks us to do
[43:01] something because he just doesn't want
[43:03] to do it for us he wants us to do
[43:06] something so that we can see him do it
[43:08] and so it's his will I want you to
[43:10] recognize just the wisdom of God when it
[43:12] comes to applying the token in Exodus
[43:14] chapter 12 there was very specific
[43:16] things they were asked to do and very
[43:17] detailed things they're asked to do and
[43:19] it would all be touch points with God
[43:22] it all be ways that they're being
[43:24] conscious of the attitude of God and
[43:25] what God likes and it's one of those
[43:28] things that you begin to ask questions
[43:29] and they sometimes maybe do it with
[43:31] their spouses and things they say well
[43:32] do you know what their favorite color is
[43:33] and what do they eat for breakfast and
[43:35] what are the ages of your children and
[43:37] when were they born and who is your
[43:38] their primary care physician and the
[43:41] dads are kind of like ask Mom
[43:43] right and maybe you don't know all the
[43:45] answers but the more you know how people
[43:47] like things the more you know about them
[43:49] and how particular they are and so God's
[43:51] word establishes these requirements and
[43:54] he's wanting us to do it for the growth
[43:56] of our faith to stimulate us to become
[43:58] more christ-like and he gives us
[44:00] detailed requirements and things that we
[44:02] ought to do and it's his will
[44:04] challenging us to do his will in making
[44:07] that a goal it helps us to lay aside
[44:09] distractions
[44:11] and it and it makes us more disciplined
[44:13] to avoid hindrances
[44:15] I mean if you think about it say well
[44:17] Lord says oh well you know just just
[44:20] conquer Jericho
[44:22] and so I mean I wonder how many years
[44:24] they might have sat there
[44:26] trying to figure out a way to conquer
[44:27] Jericho
[44:28] but there's something about God giving
[44:30] you general orders and giving you
[44:31] marching orders and telling you what to
[44:32] do you're like well he told me to do
[44:34] this and I know this is going to work
[44:36] it's a way of focusing us and getting us
[44:38] away from the things that we ought not
[44:40] to do
[44:41] and it says this in verse 17 and 18 of
[44:43] Joshua 6 now as they're going to go
[44:44] forward and do this and the city shall
[44:46] be accursed even it and all that are
[44:48] therein for to the Lord only Rahab the
[44:50] Harlot shall live and she and all that
[44:51] are with her in the house because she
[44:54] hid The Messengers that we sent there's
[44:55] your missionaries going forth and ye in
[44:59] any wise keep yourselves from the
[45:01] accursed thing
[45:03] lest you make yourselves accursed when
[45:05] you take of the accursed thing
[45:07] and make the camp of Israel a curse and
[45:10] trouble it
[45:11] it really says the accursed thing it
[45:13] says the city shall be accursed so the
[45:15] accursed thing was anything that related
[45:17] to the city they weren't to take
[45:18] anything out of it they were to to
[45:20] anything in it and those therein were
[45:23] accursed all possessions people you name
[45:25] it except for Rahab this person and her
[45:27] family so the accursed things were those
[45:30] things that were ordained to destruction
[45:32] again what I want you to use this as
[45:34] analogy of is the analogy of doing God's
[45:37] will that for the those in the Book of
[45:38] Joshua they were to conquer Jericho
[45:41] leave nothing leave everything behind
[45:43] let it be a curse let it be destroyed
[45:45] and save only Rahab they weren't to take
[45:47] anything out of it so we may not be
[45:49] asked to March around the walls of
[45:50] anything we may not be tasked with
[45:52] walking through rubble and making sure
[45:54] we're saving rahab's family use it now
[45:56] for us as a template of God's attitude
[45:59] towards us doing what he has asked us to
[46:01] do
[46:02] and as we read the story in Joshua we
[46:05] see that Israel conquered Jericho with
[46:07] ease and this was a great miracle
[46:10] this was an imposing city that was
[46:12] impenetrable
[46:14] that had walls that they could not tear
[46:16] down Israel did not have the means to
[46:18] destroy it so the strong walled city
[46:20] that was fortified against all attackers
[46:23] and could not be destroyed by human
[46:24] hands Israel conquered something that
[46:27] they themselves were not able to conquer
[46:29] but in doing the will of God the walls
[46:31] fell just exactly the way that it was
[46:34] supposed to happen
[46:36] and chapter 7 begins with us telling us
[46:39] that Aiken has now taken in a cursed
[46:40] thing and he's disobeyed the Lord but
[46:43] not everybody knows this the Storyteller
[46:45] kind of shares it with us so that we can
[46:47] understand what's about to happen
[46:49] when they go to fight this next battle
[46:51] in chapter 7 verse 2 and 3 and Joshua
[46:53] sent men from Jericho to I.E and I
[46:56] believe that's the right way to say it
[46:57] uh e and not AI is artificial
[47:00] intelligence we should be very
[47:02] afraid of that
[47:04] and Joshua sent Men We Shouldn't Be
[47:06] Afraid of Anything But Joshua sent men
[47:07] from Jericho to a AI as some people say
[47:10] but it's AI which is beside Beth Haven
[47:12] and on the east side of Bethel and spake
[47:15] unto them saying go up and view the
[47:16] country
[47:17] and the men went up and viewed I.E and
[47:19] they returned to Joshua and said to him
[47:21] let not all the people go up let about
[47:23] two or three thousand men go up and
[47:25] smite and make not all the people to
[47:27] labor for their for they are but few now
[47:30] to think of this contrast they just had
[47:31] this huge Victory and destroyed Jericho
[47:33] so now that they've destroyed Jericho
[47:35] they see the city of Ahi which was a
[47:37] weaker City the word all he means
[47:39] literally heap of ruins
[47:41] that's what it means and so they're
[47:43] thinking well we just destroyed Jericho
[47:45] and Jericho's become a heaper heap of
[47:47] ruins because of us now we're
[47:49] approaching a city that's already a heap
[47:51] of ruins and they're thinking we we
[47:53] don't even need as much might as much
[47:55] things as we did to defeat Jericho and
[47:57] what happens they sin but a few thousand
[47:59] men up to attack the city and 36 men die
[48:03] in 3 000 flee from the enemy
[48:07] now we could break out into our breakout
[48:10] groups and have some side discussions on
[48:12] this and begin to ask ourselves the
[48:14] questions why
[48:16] and I'm sure I could get a lot of very
[48:18] um wonderful answers from different
[48:20] people here who the word of God kind of
[48:22] catches them from different perspectives
[48:23] but I'll just State the obvious here
[48:26] one of the reasons why they failed is
[48:28] God never told him to do it
[48:30] it's one of the things that's explicitly
[48:32] missing in the text God told them to do
[48:34] what they did to Jericho and maybe
[48:36] Joshua saw this as a weaker enemy and
[48:39] acted outside of the general orders and
[48:41] he looks at this he's like oh well let's
[48:42] just go do it let's just go take it it
[48:44] seems smaller this seems logical this
[48:46] seems like an easy grab let's just go do
[48:48] this and maybe on the high of that
[48:50] Victory and we've got to be very careful
[48:51] when you get excited because of the
[48:53] victory you can immediately begin to
[48:55] presume and you fall flat on your face
[48:57] and what the devil starts to do is
[48:58] question the victory don't ever question
[49:00] the victory question your attitude post
[49:02] Victory and whether or not you
[49:04] adequately gave God the glory whether or
[49:06] not you checked yourself and made sure
[49:07] you were still in his will and you knew
[49:09] what the general order still were
[49:10] because as a church I believe that God
[49:12] is blessing us supremely but as He
[49:15] blesses us supremely we want to be
[49:16] supremely humble recognizing it as
[49:19] nothing but his grace
[49:21] is
[49:22] and they flee
[49:25] and
[49:26] and they're in a 36 men die after
[49:28] destroying Jericho without a loss
[49:31] but God never told him to go
[49:35] he acted presumptuously he's a he's kind
[49:37] of acting outside of God's orders
[49:39] because God had said in Exodus chapter
[49:40] 23 verses 29 and 31 I will not drive
[49:44] them out from before thee in one year
[49:47] Joshua's trying to accelerate the
[49:49] timeline
[49:50] trying to accelerate what God's doing
[49:53] and he goes forward but notice the
[49:55] wisdom of God lest the land become
[49:56] desolate and the Beast of the field
[49:58] multiply against thee by little and
[50:00] little I will drive them out from before
[50:03] thee until thou be increased and inherit
[50:05] the land
[50:06] and I will set thy bounds from the Red
[50:08] Sea even Under the Sea of the
[50:09] Philistines and from the desert of the
[50:10] river and I will deliver the inhabitants
[50:11] of the land in your hand and thou shalt
[50:13] drive them out before thee
[50:16] but you don't need to try to do it all
[50:17] at once one after another on your own
[50:19] timeline and what you think is the will
[50:21] of God and how you think you should do
[50:22] it I'll do it and I'll do it little by
[50:24] little
[50:26] because recognize the wisdom of God that
[50:27] if he was to go and and he vanquishes
[50:29] I.E and he vanquishes this one and These
[50:31] Guys these three thousand men just take
[50:33] over all of Palestine just send these
[50:35] Mighty Men they'll go and they conquer
[50:37] and they drive everyone out and then
[50:38] they all come back around Jericho and
[50:39] it's like well the land is completely
[50:41] rid of all of our enemies and he says
[50:43] then the field is going to multiply
[50:45] against thee the Beast of the field is
[50:47] going to multiply against thee because
[50:48] you haven't grown enough to be able to
[50:51] possess all this land
[50:53] to give you all this land but you're not
[50:55] mature enough to handle it I'm going to
[50:57] give you all these promises but you kind
[50:58] of got to grow into it I'm going to give
[51:00] you a Ministry but you've got to kind of
[51:02] grow up in order to fulfill it
[51:04] and this is what's being expressed in
[51:06] this and this is something that Joshua
[51:08] left behind and wasn't thinking about is
[51:10] God promised to do it but you had to do
[51:12] it by little and little you had to do it
[51:14] according to God's Will and according to
[51:15] God's program
[51:18] each Victory requires maturity
[51:21] each Victory is to promote growth
[51:23] and every Victory there's Lessons
[51:25] Learned there's weaknesses exposed and
[51:27] God wanted to use this Battle of Jericho
[51:29] there for a very specific reason he gave
[51:31] these very hard details and say well you
[51:33] could say that you obeyed and marching
[51:35] around six times and obeying and March
[51:37] around on that seventh day but you have
[51:39] to stop after the victory and assess did
[51:41] we do it God's way did we do it the
[51:43] right way are we sure that nobody has
[51:46] partaken in the accursed thing
[51:49] because even victories sometimes can
[51:50] expose weaknesses
[51:53] and I believe that we can't try to do
[51:55] more until we've done the least
[51:58] there's things we want to do for God
[52:00] there's things we want to accomplish
[52:01] there's things that we want to see
[52:02] happen in our lives and we have I want
[52:04] to I want this to happen in 2023. this
[52:06] is the year I've been praying for this
[52:07] for year after year after year I want
[52:09] God to do this well don't think you're
[52:10] going to be able to do something like
[52:11] that if you're not just doing these
[52:12] little things
[52:15] doing all these things that we've got to
[52:16] do we can't try to do more until we've
[52:18] done at least what he's asked us to do
[52:19] we must follow his plan
[52:23] we can conquer things that are seemingly
[52:25] unconquerable when we're in his will
[52:28] but we fall to the weakest of things
[52:30] when we're out of his will
[52:33] the walls of Jericho can just fall like
[52:35] that when we're in his will and then
[52:37] come up to a heap of ruins and succumb
[52:39] to it run away from it be fearful of
[52:42] things
[52:43] think of it that's that's the that's
[52:45] what's been happening in our lives our
[52:46] great victories were because we were in
[52:48] his will his grace that's put us there
[52:51] and we find ourselves in the battle that
[52:53] we ought to be in I don't know if we
[52:54] used it uh recently but I I recall using
[52:57] the book of Nehemiah and how that they
[52:59] had a job to do at the wall and whether
[53:01] at the wall they have a hammer on one
[53:03] hand and a sword in the other and as
[53:05] they're labored on the wall the promise
[53:06] was is anybody attacks you while you're
[53:08] laboring we're going to sound the
[53:10] trumpet and we'll meet him in the battle
[53:11] and we'll conquer him at the wall but
[53:13] whatever you do don't leave the work to
[53:15] go fight the devil in the plane of oh no
[53:18] right the valley of oh no is what it was
[53:21] because there that's not where you're
[53:22] laboring you can't fight a battle where
[53:25] you're where you're not supposed to be
[53:26] laboring
[53:28] as the battle comes you where you're
[53:29] labor and you're in the will of God as
[53:31] Moses came up against the Red Sea he was
[53:33] in the Commandment he was in the order
[53:34] he was doing what God was wanted him to
[53:37] do so when he came up against the Red
[53:38] Sea he had to know God would come on the
[53:41] scene
[53:43] and so we there's you look at this I
[53:45] want to use the word template
[53:48] circumstances in your life where you've
[53:49] seen great victories it's because you
[53:50] found the will of God you humbled
[53:52] yourself to the will of God you asked
[53:53] for his help but where we've seen
[53:55] probably our greatest weak or their
[53:57] greatest failures is when we stepped out
[53:59] of his will
[54:00] and even the smallest of things get us
[54:02] scared
[54:04] and cause us defeat
[54:06] but it's because his will is the most
[54:08] important thing
[54:10] and so Joshua immediately knew something
[54:12] was wrong in Joshua 7 6 it says Joshua
[54:15] rent his clothes and fell on the earth
[54:16] upon his face before the Ark of the Lord
[54:18] until the evening time even tied
[54:20] he and the Elders of Israel and put dust
[54:23] upon their heads this is that humility
[54:25] to recognize something's not right
[54:26] something's wrong
[54:28] and as Josh was calling upon the Lord in
[54:30] verse 10 it says and the Lord Senator
[54:31] Joshua get thee up wherefore Elias thou
[54:34] thus upon thy face and God now is going
[54:37] to be very very specific Israel hath
[54:38] sinned and they've also transgressed my
[54:41] Covenant which I commanded them for they
[54:42] have taken of the accursed thing and
[54:45] have also stolen and disassembled also
[54:47] and they've put it even among their own
[54:49] stuff
[54:51] therefore the children of Israel could
[54:53] not stand before their enemies but they
[54:55] turn but turn their backs before their
[54:57] enemies because that's what Joshua's
[54:58] lamenting how is it when does Israel
[55:00] turn their backs on their enemies
[55:01] because they were accursed neither will
[55:03] I be with you anymore except you
[55:06] destroyed the cursed thing from among
[55:07] you can I just put it this way I'm not
[55:10] making commentary on anything that you
[55:11] might find of the world among your own
[55:13] stuff I'm talking about the will of God
[55:16] we have to be doing God's will
[55:19] up sanctify the people and say sanctify
[55:21] yourselves against tomorrow for thus
[55:23] saith the Lord God of Israel there's an
[55:25] accursed thing in the midst of the O
[55:27] Israel
[55:28] thou canst not stand before thine
[55:30] enemies until you take away the accursed
[55:32] thing from among you
[55:33] we can't stand before our enemies until
[55:35] we're standing in the perfect will of
[55:37] God
[55:38] because if you're standing in the
[55:39] perfect will of God and the enemy stands
[55:40] there that's your that's your comfort
[55:43] well I'm wearing I'm where he wants me
[55:44] to be
[55:45] so if the enemy's facing me he's either
[55:49] facing me because this is what God wants
[55:51] me to face or he's facing me as a
[55:53] challenge to God's Will and we're like
[55:56] that ain't my battle
[55:57] right
[55:59] we're just looking at this guy saying
[56:00] bruh
[56:01] you picked the wrong fight
[56:03] because I'm just here because God wants
[56:05] me to be here and if you're going to try
[56:06] to move me you got to deal with somebody
[56:08] else and that's when David said the Lord
[56:10] the battle is not mine it's the Lord's
[56:12] what a place to be as Believers when we
[56:14] know in his will I'm doing as well I'm
[56:15] doing this when we were met without
[56:17] position we know just keep doing his
[56:19] will God will fight your battles
[56:22] and Joshua instead of him
[56:25] God the way he kind of rebukes him
[56:27] instead of asking these other questions
[56:29] why when did Israel ever turn their back
[56:32] and run from the enemies Joshua should
[56:34] have been asking did we obey
[56:36] where did we go wrong we did this we did
[56:38] this are we not Sanctified did we do his
[56:40] will are we doing God's Will and he
[56:42] could have realized man I was presuming
[56:44] to go to Ahi to begin with
[56:46] but God was using Jericho to teach
[56:48] Israel a lesson
[56:50] Joshua gets ahead of God's plan
[56:53] but if I could just use it this way and
[56:55] maybe use it as something for us to
[56:56] remember as we go forward Joshua needed
[56:59] to take personal assessment after the
[57:01] victory now take inventory of things
[57:05] the brother Brown talks about it so much
[57:07] people getting caught up in the
[57:08] inspiration and the enthusiasm and
[57:10] Campground cramps and camp meeting stars
[57:13] and whenever things happen we're feeling
[57:14] really good really good really good but
[57:16] we want to slow down say am I doing
[57:17] God's will
[57:18] I don't want to think just because
[57:20] there's enthusiasm just because there's
[57:21] Miracles just because there's signs just
[57:23] because they're wonders I don't just
[57:24] because we're getting the right results
[57:25] Lord am I am I in your word
[57:27] am I doing the things you want me to do
[57:30] and that's what we ought to be doing
[57:31] Lord am I in your will am I doing your
[57:33] will
[57:34] am I obeying your general orders kind of
[57:36] take assessment where where am I take
[57:38] corrective measures on where I am right
[57:41] now
[57:42] in your will
[57:44] so God says this in verse 14 in the
[57:46] morning therefore you shall be brought
[57:47] according to your tribes this is where I
[57:48] want to bring it down to us tonight
[57:50] and it shall be that the tribe which the
[57:52] lord taketh shall come according to the
[57:53] families thereof so they're all to come
[57:55] as tribes and then it was going to
[57:57] narrow down
[57:58] one by when the Lord would identify
[58:00] that tribe that was now kind of like no
[58:03] it's going to be here
[58:05] it's kind of like like DNA testing right
[58:08] we've got certain markers we know it's
[58:10] here and now it's getting more precise
[58:11] more precise more precise and it says in
[58:14] the tribe which Lord take a shall come
[58:15] according to the families thereof
[58:17] and the family which the Lord shall take
[58:19] shall come by households
[58:21] and the householders the Lord shall take
[58:23] shall come Man by man
[58:28] and that's the way we want to start
[58:30] as Believers as for me and my house
[58:33] we come Man by man verse 16. so Joshua
[58:36] rose up early in the morning and brought
[58:37] Israel by their tribes the tribe of
[58:39] Judah was taken
[58:41] and he brought the family of Judah
[58:43] and he took the family of the Tsar
[58:44] Heights and he brought the family of his
[58:46] All rights Man by man and zabdi was
[58:49] taken and he brought his household Man
[58:52] by man
[58:55] if it got I could say this that at the
[58:56] end of the day the responsibility didn't
[58:58] rest on Judah it didn't rest on the
[59:00] family didn't rest on the household it
[59:02] rested on the individual
[59:04] and for us I believe our greatest
[59:07] strength are those who are here as
[59:09] individuals that Arizona believer's
[59:11] Church isn't your strength it's not your
[59:13] protection it's not how you know that
[59:15] you're right and say bless God we know
[59:16] our ABCs or however we want to look at
[59:18] it that's not it the strength of this
[59:19] church are the individuals that make it
[59:21] up and the individuals that are leading
[59:23] their families that are part of this
[59:25] church so we all now at this moment I
[59:27] share this with you at the close of this
[59:30] series that what we want to do is we
[59:31] want to take inventory Man by Man head
[59:35] of household individual by individual
[59:37] Lord it is my responsibility to follow
[59:40] in your will it's not anybody else's
[59:42] responsibility and Lord I want to do
[59:45] your will and I want to come Man by man
[59:47] before you and say Lord search my heart
[59:49] see if there be anything that I'm not
[59:51] doing that I ought to be doing anything
[59:53] I'm doing that displeases you and I
[59:55] believe that each one of you
[59:56] individually can hold yourself
[59:58] accountable to the Lord and then what I
[1:00:00] would pray for you is that God would put
[1:00:02] you somewhere where you have the kind of
[1:00:04] Believers around you that not only hold
[1:00:07] you accountable to God's will but give
[1:00:09] you the resources that you need and the
[1:00:11] strength and encouragement that we need
[1:00:12] in a dark time like this to stay in his
[1:00:15] will and find the next step in his will
[1:00:17] and we promise as a church to do that
[1:00:19] for one another can you say Amen that we
[1:00:22] promise us as Believers as fellow
[1:00:24] Believers in a dark time and a terrible
[1:00:25] time in a trying time that we make this
[1:00:28] commitment to one another that I'm I'm
[1:00:29] with you we're here for you this isn't a
[1:00:33] popularity contest this isn't a
[1:00:35] accumulate assets contest this is a
[1:00:37] Rapture that we're wanting to see this
[1:00:39] is staying in God's Will and we're here
[1:00:41] for one another to support one another
[1:00:43] and I want to be faithful as a pastor to
[1:00:46] preach a word that provides you the
[1:00:47] resources to stand before God Man by man
[1:00:51] and be found faithful
[1:00:55] and keep these things in mind and in
[1:00:57] your heart as you do the will of God
[1:00:58] that there's many scriptures and stories
[1:01:00] in the word that we can use as an
[1:01:02] analogy of staying in his perfect will
[1:01:05] and I believe that we know the year in
[1:01:07] preview
[1:01:09] and we know God's will for us
