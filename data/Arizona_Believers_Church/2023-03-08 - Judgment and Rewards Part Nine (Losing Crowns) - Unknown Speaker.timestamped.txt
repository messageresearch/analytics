[0:00] I'm I'm going to jump into this uh with
[0:02] the on this subject of judgment rewards
[0:04] is part nine um continued on losing
[0:07] crowns. Uh we kind of began this
[0:10] particular uh subtitle on last Wednesday
[0:13] night on uh when we were looking at
[0:15] character development. Last Wednesday
[0:16] night we had ministered on character
[0:17] development and how that our character
[0:20] determines our rewards. I think we can
[0:22] kind of see that explicitly in the
[0:24] scripture. As we grow in conduct, we
[0:26] grow in character that that's even
[0:27] expansion of stewardship in this life
[0:29] and then something that is also u a
[0:32] companion to that in the next life and
[0:34] in eternity. And we were using um
[0:37] through these last two services the idea
[0:39] that if as we grow our character as it
[0:42] determines our reward, it it it speaks
[0:44] of coming into the full possession of
[0:46] the inheritance of our godly
[0:48] inheritance, the inheritance that God
[0:50] would like to give us. and Sunday we're
[0:52] specifically looking at and focusing on
[0:54] the law of adoption and how that in the
[0:56] law of adoption in the natural and it's
[0:59] important to look at in terms of the
[1:00] natural it was used as a framework to
[1:02] understand God's truth of adoption. So
[1:05] God has a process that we can call
[1:07] adoption. God has a a a um a culmination
[1:10] of things that we could see and type in
[1:12] the law of adoption. So we're looking at
[1:14] the law of adoption and recognizing that
[1:16] brother Brandham was using it as a way
[1:18] to understand God's process for us. And
[1:20] I almost titled tonight's service the
[1:22] process. Um I didn't want to confuse
[1:24] that with anybody's nickname. So we just
[1:26] left it to losing crowns. But the law of
[1:28] adoption is used as a framework to
[1:30] understand God's process. And so he was
[1:32] using brother Brandon when he taught on
[1:34] the law of adoption. He was using Old
[1:36] Testament laws he referred to it. He's
[1:38] using some of Paul's teaching. So that's
[1:40] connected to Roman law. And he was using
[1:42] as a type to show how that God will
[1:45] grant a full inheritance to his sons.
[1:47] like this is how God goes about a
[1:50] process to turning over the kingdom,
[1:52] turning over all things to his children.
[1:55] And so again, brother Brandham used the
[1:57] law of adoption as a type of God's
[1:59] process in forming us into the image of
[2:03] God or into the image of Christ who was
[2:05] a son who is in the image of the father
[2:07] and then we likewise in the image of him
[2:09] uh and therefore we're joint heirs and
[2:11] all the the joining of those things
[2:12] together. So adoption refers to a
[2:15] process and the timing of a legal
[2:18] transfer of our inheritance and God God
[2:20] giving us power and ownership and
[2:22] inheritance. And we pointed out that the
[2:24] principle that we want to derive from
[2:26] what brother Brandham's teaching was is
[2:28] that if a child of God and he uses a son
[2:30] in the uh examples of the Old Testament
[2:33] under Roman law, if a son demonstrated
[2:35] the proper character, if he was like the
[2:37] father, then he received the full
[2:39] inheritance. There was this I can trust
[2:41] you. I now want to turn it over to you.
[2:43] In Lukeapter 16:12, it says, "And if you
[2:46] have not been faithful in that which is
[2:47] another man's, who shall give you that
[2:49] which is your own? If you're faithful in
[2:51] little, you'll be faithful in much. If
[2:53] you're unjust in little, you'll be
[2:54] unjust in much." And so, this is the
[2:56] idea and the principle that God is
[2:58] measuring your character by how you
[3:00] handle what little he gives you. And
[3:03] what we recognized is that if you are
[3:05] given something and you don't handle it
[3:06] well, God deals with you as sons and he
[3:09] corrects the way that you handle it
[3:11] because he wants to give you more.
[3:13] That's his desire is to give you more.
[3:15] So God is going to correct your
[3:17] character, going to correct your
[3:18] conduct. He's going to put you through
[3:20] things to test you. And there's a way of
[3:21] he's wanting to bring out of you that
[3:23] good, bring out of you that
[3:24] faithfulness, bring out of you that
[3:26] fruitfulness. And so the principle here
[3:29] is that if you are an heir to something,
[3:31] if you don't demonstrate faithfulness
[3:33] with what is another man's when it's
[3:35] your father's, how is he going to commit
[3:37] to you as a full possession the true
[3:39] riches
[3:40] if you can't demonstrate faithfulness?
[3:41] And so an heir uh in this way is not
[3:44] does not receive the full inheritance
[3:46] until he was proven. Brother Brand said
[3:48] until he was proven or he says until his
[3:50] character was tested. Those are the
[3:52] terminologies. We're just re reh
[3:55] rehearsing some things from Sunday. He
[3:57] said he would be an heir of all the
[3:58] father had if his character was white
[4:00] right. But first his character had to be
[4:02] proved. He says now you ministers know
[4:04] where I'm going to. It's the placing of
[4:06] a son. But his character if his
[4:08] character didn't show up right he didn't
[4:10] inherit anything. He was just a son.
[4:13] And this is where the judgment and
[4:15] rewards. We've been looking at the
[4:16] concept of rewards. And this is a future
[4:18] inheritance for a life lived well here
[4:20] on earth as a son or daughter of God.
[4:22] And we're using it in two ways. I'd say
[4:24] to better understand rewards, but then
[4:26] also to better understand who we are as
[4:28] sons and daughters of God. Um, and maybe
[4:30] clear up some things that sometimes are
[4:32] confusing um on the new birth and on
[4:34] adoption. But he's saying if his
[4:36] character didn't show up right, he's
[4:37] still a son. He loses his inheritance.
[4:40] That's where we took the the terminology
[4:42] losing crowns. It's a loss of rewards.
[4:44] It's a loss of a portion of inheritance
[4:46] because of the lack of character
[4:48] because of the the the lack of
[4:50] reflecting the desire of the father and
[4:52] and bringing forth the hundfold and
[4:54] being fruitful. And so we'll just we'll
[4:56] keep this title slide there for a few
[4:57] moments, brother John, until we get to
[4:59] uh hear ye him there in 57 because I
[5:01] want to read I want to kind of go over a
[5:03] few quotes real quick that I don't have
[5:04] slides for. These are brother talking
[5:07] about the loss of crowns when crowns are
[5:10] given out. the loss of rewards. When
[5:11] rewards are given out, where we are
[5:13] judged, not to determine whether or not
[5:15] we'll stay in a glorified body, not to
[5:16] determine whether or not we're going to
[5:17] stay in eternity. Not to determine any
[5:19] kind of condemnation, but the extent of
[5:22] what we will receive as a reward.
[5:24] Brother said, if he's not obedient and
[5:26] the right kind of son, he continues as
[5:27] son without any reward. So there's he's
[5:31] always a son, but he loses his reward.
[5:33] This is what he says in these hear ye
[5:34] hymns in these adoption sermons. The
[5:36] child is always a son certainly but he
[5:38] but it loses something. These are the
[5:41] ways that brother Ram was identifying.
[5:42] This is so you can understand why he was
[5:45] preaching u and using adoption. It was
[5:47] in no way to to ruin people or destroy
[5:50] people. It was to help people and to
[5:52] encourage them. Says uh he was just a
[5:54] castaway but he was always a son. And he
[5:57] even used Paul as an example and what he
[5:59] said that Paul was recognizing that he
[6:02] could labor for God, but if he didn't
[6:03] bring his body under subjection, then he
[6:05] would lose his reward. He said that when
[6:07] you get the Holy Ghost, your son's God
[6:09] or daughter. That's true. But if you
[6:10] don't obey God, walk in the light, walk
[6:12] in the word, believe God, then you won't
[6:14] have any inheritance. So notice that
[6:17] you're a son, you've got the Holy Ghost,
[6:19] you can't take salvation away. But the
[6:21] loss for not living faithfully was an
[6:23] inheritance. He says, "If you don't obey
[6:24] God, you lose an inheritance." He said,
[6:26] "Well, it's just exactly the way God
[6:27] does it yet." So, this is God's pattern.
[6:30] Says, "And your conduct each day as the
[6:31] Holy Spirit brings it before the Father.
[6:34] Gives away the things that you do, and
[6:35] you're still a son and daughter, but
[6:37] you'll never be brought to a place where
[6:39] you should be." I think that one's maybe
[6:41] one of those outstanding ones. You'll
[6:43] never be brought to a place where you
[6:45] should be. And there's a recognition
[6:48] that there's people do it all the time.
[6:50] They use quotes to their own advantage.
[6:51] they use to their own advantage uh
[6:53] unlawfully or disgracefully. They'll
[6:55] twist and distort certain teachings so
[6:57] that they can justify living ungodly or
[7:00] so they can justify condemning other
[7:01] people. And what we're wanting to do is
[7:03] take away from this the mind of God and
[7:05] what his what his desire is for us. And
[7:08] so I want to look at more closely
[7:10] tonight how the prophet uses the subject
[7:12] of adoption and in particular recognize
[7:15] that he's using it when he uses it and
[7:17] all these oh dozens of times that he
[7:19] preached this type of subject that he
[7:21] was using it to correct the attitude and
[7:23] conduct of the church and of the
[7:25] Christians who claim to be the church or
[7:26] claim to be Christians. So, as I as I
[7:29] walk through these tonight, and I'm I'm
[7:30] glad that it's a Wednesday night crowd
[7:32] because maybe uh it's just uh uh you're
[7:35] going to you're going to find that
[7:36] there's a pat on the back for you
[7:37] tonight when I read some of these
[7:38] quotes. And that uh just we can be very
[7:41] careful. I think you you've been in all
[7:42] these services, you're tracking these
[7:44] together, which is good. And be very
[7:46] careful that we don't resort maybe to
[7:48] some prior way of thinking or we resort
[7:50] to the negative or begin to look at it
[7:52] through a legalistic uh condemning lens,
[7:55] but look at it from a positive
[7:56] standpoint. how a father would deal with
[7:58] his child and how the father would want
[8:00] to give him everything. He wants to do
[8:02] that. His son is the builder of the
[8:04] family name. This is the one that's
[8:06] going to be in the image of the father.
[8:07] So, he's not anxious just to condemn him
[8:09] and write them off and say, "You're no
[8:10] good. I'll go get another one." He wants
[8:12] this to work out, right? And so, look at
[8:15] this in a way that is um has a lot of
[8:17] grace for yourselves. And then also
[8:19] remember, brother Brandham used the law
[8:21] of adoption as a type for the truth of
[8:24] God's process or the truth of God's
[8:26] adoption. And so if we look at the
[8:29] framework of the natural adoption, we
[8:31] have to be careful that that's not the
[8:32] truth. That's the type. And so some of
[8:35] the things that brother Brandon gives as
[8:36] an example and some of the stories he
[8:38] gives and the ways that he's using it.
[8:40] Sometimes what we do is we draw the
[8:42] truth from that instead of sticking to
[8:44] the truth and just amplifying or
[8:46] understanding it better through the
[8:47] type. We make the type the truth at the
[8:50] exp or the the type the truth at the
[8:52] expense of the truth
[8:53] because now we're just lifting up the
[8:55] type and and and we say, "Oh, well, no.
[8:56] If this happens and that happens and
[8:58] this has to happen and the next thing we
[8:59] know, we're all kind of waiting for a
[9:00] ceremony, right? Where angels are all
[9:02] gathered together and everybody watches
[9:03] us get a brand new robe and we've gone
[9:05] too far with the type." Oh, just keep
[9:08] that in mind on the type because I could
[9:11] even say this that if uh we could take
[9:13] the word of God and show that there is
[9:15] an adoption in terminology and in truth
[9:18] that is taking a gentile who was a
[9:21] repbate who was not an heir who
[9:22] seemingly did not have any inheritance
[9:24] in the promise of God. And so there's a
[9:26] there's a terminology used in
[9:28] Christianity in gentile Christianity of
[9:30] being adopted, but that's a different
[9:32] type than the one that brother Brandham
[9:34] uses for the law of adoption and the one
[9:36] that he uses for the Roman law of
[9:37] adoption. It's a different type than the
[9:39] one he uses that Paul preaches about and
[9:41] that he uses in here ye him. So we can
[9:43] use a terminology that speaks of an
[9:45] adoption that's more like what we would
[9:47] do today to take a child that's not our
[9:48] own and formally make them a part of our
[9:50] family and they become an heir. They
[9:51] have every right and privilege within
[9:53] the family and they had having not been
[9:55] one before. So we can use that we've
[9:57] been taken out of the world. We've been
[9:58] taken out of sin. Now we are seated in
[10:00] heavenly places in Christ Jesus, adopted
[10:02] into the family. But the that's a
[10:04] different type than the one that brother
[10:06] Brandham uses on the law of adoption.
[10:08] Amen.
[10:09] So I feel like we're all caught up now
[10:12] together to go a little bit further in
[10:14] this. So now the prophet is using the
[10:16] subject of adoption. Let's just look at
[10:17] this very carefully now together. And I
[10:21] want this is where I want you to be
[10:22] careful and and and just uh not be too
[10:27] quick to lean too far one way, but just
[10:29] say, "Lord, help me to catch what you're
[10:31] trying to say." Because brother Bam is
[10:32] going to use really really strong
[10:33] language. He's going to be very very
[10:34] pointed, and I don't want to do anything
[10:36] to change it. Like, I don't want to say,
[10:38] "Ah, well, I know he's call balling out
[10:40] the women for doing this. I know he's
[10:41] balling out the man for doing that, but
[10:42] that doesn't really matter." No, it
[10:44] does. It absolutely does. But I wouldn't
[10:47] want that that language to aggravate it
[10:49] in the sense where you start thinking
[10:51] now so negatively about the process that
[10:53] you don't recognize the way brother
[10:55] Brandon was trying to bring the believer
[10:57] along for more
[10:59] and I think I'll touch on that later but
[11:01] if maybe I'll just say it now and maybe
[11:03] this is a good place to say it. I want
[11:05] to bring it back into the context of
[11:07] rewards that that this the subject of
[11:10] rewards to me helps us understand
[11:11] adoption so much better and at least it
[11:13] does for me. And there's two other
[11:16] elements at play when brother Brandham
[11:18] is preaching through the 50s and early
[11:19] 60s on adoption. He he has a role as a
[11:22] messenger to the church age. He has a
[11:25] role of a prophet to turn the hearts of
[11:26] the children back to the faith of the
[11:28] Pentecostal fathers. He's a son of man
[11:30] that's going to be revealing the son of
[11:31] man. He is actually the angel of
[11:33] revelations 10:7. He has a lot of
[11:35] ministries, a lot of scriptural
[11:36] ministries. So there's things that
[11:38] brother Bram has to do to address
[11:39] Leodysia. He has to address Leodysia.
[11:42] And in his address to this is a key part
[11:44] in his address to Leodysia he doesn't
[11:47] compliment her
[11:48] right
[11:49] because God doesn't
[11:51] and so he has to come with the
[11:53] correction he has to come with the
[11:54] rebuke he has to come with with calling
[11:56] now bringing them back to even the
[11:58] things that God had just soon done in
[12:00] the Leodysene churches. He's got to call
[12:02] them back real quick to get away from
[12:03] some of the things that they were
[12:04] falling away to. And so he's speaking in
[12:07] a way to correct and bring people out of
[12:09] things and bring them back to where they
[12:10] ought to be. And he speaks to a mixed
[12:13] audience. In speaking into a mixed
[12:15] audience, he was careful to not preach
[12:18] in such a way to where he takes robs
[12:20] everybody of their experience. And these
[12:23] people have sat there said, "Hey, I've
[12:24] seen the power of God. I felt the power
[12:25] of God. I've seen things manifested."
[12:27] And you're sitting there telling me I'm
[12:28] a dirty good for nothing serpent seed
[12:30] because I'm making all these kinds of
[12:32] mistakes. It wouldn't have been
[12:33] fruitful.
[12:34] So, there's a way that Brother Brandham
[12:36] spoke to them as sons because they
[12:38] claimed to be sons.
[12:40] Right? And then also it's so it's
[12:42] important that even if they're not elect
[12:43] and they're not sons, they're sons and
[12:45] daughters in there,
[12:46] right?
[12:47] That they have to have the message
[12:49] preached to bring them out of it.
[12:50] And so there's you have to recognize
[12:52] even the principle in the church age
[12:54] book where brother Bam says because they
[12:55] claim to be the church, he speaks to
[12:56] them as a church.
[12:57] So brother Bam's going to speak that
[12:59] way.
[13:00] And then also in the church are elect
[13:01] that have got to come out of it. So he's
[13:03] got to speak in a way to get their
[13:04] attention, cause them to come out of it.
[13:06] So there's a lot more that could be
[13:07] said. I could spend a whole sermon on
[13:08] that side. But then there's also another
[13:10] element which I think is very important
[13:12] is the dispensational element that
[13:14] brother Benham is addressing because
[13:15] he's talking to a church that's been
[13:17] restored back to the full new birth. The
[13:19] new birth itself, back to the
[13:21] restoration of the gifts, the baptism of
[13:23] Holy Ghost is coming to the church. And
[13:25] here they are. They come right up to
[13:27] this this image and even having the
[13:29] restoration of the gifts brings us back
[13:30] to the book of Acts and the way the
[13:32] church would have looked in the book of
[13:33] Acts. They're baptized in the name of
[13:34] Jesus Christ. The gifts are being made
[13:36] manifest. There's healing ministries.
[13:37] There's revivals taking place. But guess
[13:40] what? That's not all.
[13:42] Right? There was a rapture. And so,
[13:44] Brother Bam had to take those who had
[13:45] been born again and recognize the fact
[13:47] that we're living now in a time, in a
[13:49] season where it's calling a church, not
[13:51] only a bride out of a church, but it's
[13:53] going going to go into a third exodus.
[13:56] So, he had to get the attention of those
[13:57] who the Holy Spirit is dealing with that
[13:59] there's going to be more. It's not just
[14:02] being Pentecostal. It's not just the new
[14:03] birth. It's not just the restoration of
[14:05] the gifts, but it's a perfection of our
[14:07] faith for a translation. And brother
[14:08] Brandham had to bring them in
[14:10] dispensationally. He was saying this is
[14:12] the time of adoption. In what sense? The
[14:15] change of our bodies to it? The the
[14:17] adoption redemption of this body. And so
[14:20] that was the that was the uh that's
[14:22] another element in this is the
[14:25] dispensational side. And then we'll come
[14:27] back uh maybe to the reward side here in
[14:29] a little bit. So now in the sermon hear
[14:31] ye him
[14:37] it sounds like coughs are becoming the
[14:39] new yawn. If you hear somebody else
[14:40] cough you're going to start coughing.
[14:43] Like when someone yawns it's universal.
[14:45] You see someone yawn everyone starts
[14:47] yawning. You just talk about the more I
[14:48] talk about yawning some of you are going
[14:50] to yawn. And here ye it says this is not
[14:52] meant to hurt but it's meant to put
[14:54] something before you. Key phrase he's
[14:56] not doing it to hurt. He wants to put
[14:58] something before you. something's before
[14:59] you is something uh that should ought to
[15:02] be something you not only consider but
[15:04] maybe reach for. He says how do you
[15:06] think the Holy Spirit must be to go
[15:07] before God and he's talking in the
[15:09] context of the adoption process. Go
[15:11] before God to bring our character, our
[15:13] fussing, fighting, making differences,
[15:15] separating brotherhood. How do you think
[15:17] it must be when he has to go before the
[15:19] father and say, "Your child didn't go to
[15:21] church tonight. The bells rung, but he
[15:24] stayed home to look at television." And
[15:26] all the people here said,
[15:29] "Come on, they can't hear you. There's
[15:30] no congregational mics." Yeah, you can
[15:33] say amen as loud as you want to. You can
[15:35] even say, "Hey, did you get that so and
[15:37] so?"
[15:40] Cuz because remember now the devil
[15:42] pulled one over on us and we're not
[15:43] streaming on a screen. We stream on
[15:46] televisions now.
[15:48] Glory.
[15:51] So your child didn't go to church
[15:52] tonight. The bells ring, but he stayed
[15:54] home to look at a television. He said,
[15:55] 'How it must be to say your daughters
[15:58] that you gave the Holy Spirit. Oh,
[16:00] they're dressing so immorally till
[16:02] they're making men on the street lust
[16:04] for them. How that must hurt the Holy
[16:06] Spirit to bring such a mess as that.
[16:08] These are Brother Bram's words.
[16:10] We might say dressing immoral, they
[16:12] don't have the Holy Ghost. Staying home
[16:13] and watching TV, they don't have the
[16:15] Holy Ghost. Sounds like a logical
[16:16] debate, but let's just go with what
[16:18] Brother Bam's saying because he doesn't
[16:20] want it to hurt. He's wanting to put
[16:21] something before them.
[16:23] So, he's correcting the age. He's
[16:24] correcting their behavior in Galatians
[16:27] 3:es 1-4. Remember later on in the book
[16:30] of late the next chapter where Paul is
[16:32] giving them ex the example of adoption
[16:34] and he's showing them how that the Jews
[16:36] they were they were called to be
[16:38] positionally placed as witnesses of the
[16:40] Messiah when he was to come but they
[16:42] missed their adoption. And he was
[16:44] showing that how that Christ had come to
[16:45] redeem them from the law that they would
[16:47] be placed to be uh witnesses of the
[16:49] Messiah around you know around the
[16:51] world. having missed their adoption.
[16:53] Paul is coming back to that and brother
[16:55] Brandham uses it as the pattern of the
[16:58] Jews now becomes a pattern for the
[16:59] Gentiles because now he has given us the
[17:01] Holy Spirit. Now we're sons and as sons
[17:04] we're hes and now he's given us the Holy
[17:06] Spirit as a tutor to bring us to a place
[17:08] of rapturing grace and to perfection.
[17:11] And so that this is what he says before
[17:13] he brings that principle in. Oh foolish
[17:15] Galatians, who hath bewitched you that
[17:18] ye should not obey the truth
[17:22] before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath
[17:24] evidently set forth have been evidently
[17:27] set forth crucified among you. So you've
[17:29] seen this.
[17:30] It's evident. This is your faith. You
[17:32] believe it. But someone's bewitched you
[17:34] to where you're no longer obedient.
[17:36] You're not obeying the truth. And then
[17:37] it's uh becomes more pronounced. He
[17:40] says, "This only would I learn of you.
[17:43] receive ye the spirit by the works of
[17:45] the law or by hearing of faith. What did
[17:48] Paul do? Didn't take the Holy Ghost away
[17:50] from them.
[17:50] He says, "Do you remember why you got
[17:52] the Holy Ghost?"
[17:54] Setting forth that they did have the
[17:55] Holy Ghost, but now influences were
[17:58] keeping them from obeying the truth.
[18:01] And I know that this would probably be
[18:03] some people get really, really nervous.
[18:05] Oh, really sounds like he's preaching in
[18:06] such a way where people are just going
[18:08] to use it as an excuse to do whatever
[18:10] they want. You know what? Those people
[18:12] do that no matter what you say.
[18:14] True.
[18:15] The downside of not preaching it this
[18:17] way is the people who want to do right
[18:19] feel like they can't.
[18:20] Come on.
[18:21] And the ones that can feel like they
[18:23] shouldn't, right?
[18:25] Some of you could say amen because that
[18:27] was you.
[18:27] There's just a way that the message can
[18:29] be preached where it's defeated. You
[18:31] feel guilty. You feel unworthy. You
[18:32] might as well give up. Why should you
[18:33] even try? And you're always kind of
[18:34] looking for that catch. When is it just
[18:36] going to click and be get get easy? It
[18:38] ain't going to get easy.
[18:39] This is the fight. This is the battle.
[18:41] This is the war. Have confidence in your
[18:42] election. Watch the hand of God work in
[18:44] your life. You see a you see a growth
[18:46] and you see an overcoming. Stick to that
[18:48] pattern. Stick to that process. Don't be
[18:49] get don't get discouraged. And so Paul
[18:52] says, you receive the spirit by faith is
[18:54] what he's implying. So he says, "Are you
[18:56] so foolish having begun in the spirit?
[18:59] Are you now made perfect by the flesh?"
[19:03] So that's they're trying to bring them
[19:04] back in Judaism. They're trying to bring
[19:06] them back in a former light and bring
[19:07] them back under legalism and under
[19:09] bondage and back to circumcision and
[19:10] keeping of the law. And and it's like
[19:12] the the law could never produce that
[19:14] righteousness. The only thing that's
[19:16] going to produce righteousness now is
[19:18] righteousness by faith.
[19:20] And faith which workketh by love. And
[19:22] you got to operate under those
[19:23] parameters. You can't go back to
[19:24] legalism. You can't go back to doing it
[19:26] by law. You can't go back to doing it by
[19:28] ordinance.
[19:29] And the New Testament doesn't work by
[19:30] ordinance and law either.
[19:33] It has to be by the spirit. So, he's
[19:35] challenging them to look at their
[19:37] disobedience, their bewitching, their
[19:39] foolishness. These are strong words,
[19:41] but he's not taking away the power that
[19:43] God gave them by the new birth to
[19:45] overcome the bewitching, to become
[19:47] obedient, and to no longer be foolish.
[19:49] And he continues, he says, "Have you
[19:51] suffered so many things in vain? If it
[19:54] be yet in vain, what would the vanity
[19:56] be?" Because they suffered, they stood
[19:58] to gain a reward.
[19:59] Amen.
[20:00] Because they suffered, there was going
[20:01] to be a portion of heaven awaiting them.
[20:03] because they suffered. God was going to
[20:04] be mindful of everything that s they
[20:06] suffered. He says, "Why would you put
[20:08] this in jeopardy? Why would you make all
[20:10] your suffering in vain by going right
[20:12] back to the thing you were called out
[20:13] of? Going right back to the mindset that
[20:14] was that you were liberated by by the
[20:16] baptism of the Holy Ghost." And so the
[20:18] vanity would be the loss of a reward.
[20:20] Have you suffered so many things in
[20:22] vain? So as brother Brandham corrects
[20:24] the age, you also see where Paul is
[20:26] correcting the Galatians.
[20:28] And and if I can say this about the ones
[20:30] brother Brandham is speaking to and even
[20:31] the ones that Paul's addressing, their
[20:32] character
[20:34] was not being found because their
[20:35] conduct, their behavior was not being
[20:37] found worthy of honor, worthy of praise.
[20:39] There was no con uh commenation like
[20:41] say, "Hey, Adam boy, good job. You're
[20:43] doing great." There was something that
[20:44] needed to be corrected. So the Lord was
[20:46] disciplining them. The Lord was
[20:48] correcting them and said, "Hey, look,
[20:49] there's there's this bewitching. There's
[20:51] this misunderstanding. There's these
[20:52] things you aren't doing right." And so
[20:54] you'll find a theme that when brother
[20:56] Brandham teaches on adoption, you'll
[20:57] find this theme
[20:59] I in the adoption context of rebuking uh
[21:03] cha chastising the believer, questioning
[21:06] what they're doing uh in making
[21:08] statements about the report of the
[21:09] tutor, what he might say. And as he's
[21:11] doing it, he's really he's uh reproving
[21:14] the believer for their disobedience.
[21:17] How can you claim to be a Christian and
[21:18] do this? And I'm just kind of
[21:19] paraphrasing. How could you have the
[21:21] Holy Ghost and do this? How could you do
[21:23] this? Be a Christian and do that. And
[21:24] there's a lot of challenging and
[21:26] correction that's coming to the church.
[21:28] The sermon hear ye him. He says, I've
[21:30] often wondered how the Holy Spirit must
[21:31] feel in the presence of God bringing the
[21:34] conduct of our modern day church with so
[21:37] much world in it. People so dilatory,
[21:40] those that he's been graceful to get to
[21:42] and given the new birth.
[21:45] Oh, it must be terrible. And to think
[21:46] that in these last days, how corrupt our
[21:48] church is getting to be. On Wednesday
[21:50] night, instead of going to the prayer
[21:52] meeting, they stay home to watch
[21:53] television.
[21:59] This is brother Bradam correcting
[22:00] bringing I'm just being being comedic. I
[22:03] guess it's just I find it interesting
[22:06] that these quotes fall on a Wednesday,
[22:07] right? But again, it's to encourage you.
[22:10] Wasn't talking about me. You say, "Not
[22:12] me. I was there.
[22:16] But were you looking at the slide? At
[22:18] least you weren't staying home. People
[22:20] are dilatory. Their conduct's being
[22:22] brought up. And he says, "These are
[22:23] people who are staying home on Wednesday
[22:25] night instead of going to prayer
[22:26] meeting." And he said, "And these are
[22:28] people that he's been graceful to and
[22:29] given the new birth."
[22:31] Again, just think very carefully about
[22:33] this. I know there's a way we want to
[22:34] think today, right now, you know, how
[22:37] would we address this? How we would say
[22:38] it? Um, I just don't think we ought to
[22:41] enter into that. We ought to derive from
[22:42] this the truth that brother Brandham
[22:43] said he's meant meaning to put before
[22:45] the people. Brother Brandham says in
[22:48] another sermon here you hear him hear
[22:49] me. He says now what if this child was
[22:50] disobedient.
[22:52] How that teacher must have blushed when
[22:54] he came in the presence of the father
[22:56] and would say to him sir your boy is
[22:57] your boy is very disobedient. Oh he
[22:59] won't learn. He won't listen. I just
[23:02] can't do nothing with him. These are the
[23:04] examples. This is brother Bam taking the
[23:07] template the in this case the process
[23:10] and the framework of the natural
[23:12] adoption of the tutor giving a report
[23:14] and the teachers and the governors
[23:15] giving a report back to the father and
[23:18] dramatizing right how the holy spirit
[23:20] could come before the father and say
[23:22] he's disobedient he won't listen he's
[23:24] dilatory this is his conduct um he
[23:26] doesn't obey they're not obeying and and
[23:28] they're doing this and bringing up your
[23:30] character and bringing up these
[23:31] different things and you'll find that in
[23:33] all these different sermons brother
[23:34] Brandham rebukes them for for holiness.
[23:35] He rebukes them for their worldliness.
[23:37] He rebukes them for denying divine
[23:38] healing. He rebukes them for not
[23:40] listening to the Holy Ghost.
[23:42] These are severe rebukes.
[23:45] Very, very strong statements. And such
[23:47] strong statements to where it's not
[23:49] unreasonable for someone just to say, "I
[23:52] don't even think these people had the
[23:53] Holy Ghost." Right? You say, "How could
[23:55] they deny divine healing? How could they
[23:57] be worldly and how could they dress in
[23:59] such a way to cause men to lust after
[24:01] them and say that that may be a logical
[24:03] argument, but that's not what brother
[24:05] Brandham's saying.
[24:06] But remember, brother Brandham's not
[24:08] trying to establish a doctrine or a
[24:10] truth
[24:11] that someone with the Holy Gh Holy Ghost
[24:13] can do those things. He using the
[24:15] example of adoption to correct the
[24:17] church.
[24:17] Amen.
[24:18] And to challenge the individual. Paul
[24:21] does a similar thing in Hebrews chapter
[24:22] 5 12 to 14. Just want to look at this
[24:25] pattern of disciplining, correcting,
[24:26] reproving. For when the time that you
[24:28] ought to be teachers, you have need that
[24:30] one teach you again, which be the first
[24:33] principles of the oracle God, oracles of
[24:35] God, and to become such as have need of
[24:37] milk and not of strong meat. What is he
[24:39] saying? You should be so much further
[24:40] down the road by now. You ought to be
[24:42] mature. You ought to be handling the
[24:44] deeper things. You ought to be the
[24:45] teachers. You ought to be the ones that
[24:46] are bringing up other people. But now,
[24:48] I've got to teach you again. And he's
[24:50] going to use the example of immaturity.
[24:53] For everyone that useth milk is
[24:55] unskillful in the word of righteousness,
[24:56] for he is a babe. But strong meat
[24:58] belongth to them that are of full age,
[25:01] even those who by reason of use has have
[25:03] their senses exercised to discern both
[25:05] good and evil. This is a consistent
[25:08] theme in brother Brandham's adoption
[25:09] teaching maturity. And here Paul is
[25:12] talking to the Hebrews and he says,
[25:13] "There's a lot more that we ought to
[25:15] say. There's a lot more that we ought to
[25:16] be teaching. But when the time that you
[25:18] were I would have expected you to have
[25:21] stewardship of teaching, you still need
[25:23] to be trained. You still need to be
[25:25] taught. And he says, I I I need to feed
[25:27] you milk because you're still immature.
[25:30] You're not skillful. You haven't grown.
[25:32] You haven't learned these things and
[25:33] become more adept in the word of God.
[25:35] And your understanding hasn't increased
[25:37] because these things that I'd like to
[25:38] give you belong to people who are of, he
[25:40] uses the phrase, a full age. Right?
[25:43] And it's not so much that you turn 21,
[25:46] but it's that same idea in the principle
[25:48] of adoption that we referred to on
[25:50] Sunday that those tutors and governors
[25:52] and the father, they wanted to give the
[25:54] inheritance to the son. So there was an
[25:56] age where legally it could be conveyed
[25:59] to them, but there was this discretion
[26:01] to say he's not ready yet. And they had
[26:03] these junctures where they could keep
[26:05] extending it and extending it as I found
[26:07] the latest I could find is even to the
[26:08] age of 35 where they were still going to
[26:11] give them a chance to say, you know
[26:12] what, you finally earned it, buddy.
[26:14] We're all in here. It's yours. And so
[26:17] that would even be applicable in this
[26:19] sense. You can't just say, well, I've
[26:21] been in the message for 21 years. I'm
[26:22] old enough to to create squirrels. No.
[26:25] Uh-uh. It would it's the idea of are you
[26:27] maturing? Are you growing? It's not just
[26:30] uh the pedigree of who your father is.
[26:32] And it's not just your the legacy of
[26:33] what church you go to. And it's not just
[26:35] how many years you've managed to hold on
[26:36] and not walk away. It's what does your
[26:39] life declare in terms of fidelity to the
[26:42] truth.
[26:44] What's your character express? And so
[26:46] the principle of maturity comes up quite
[26:48] a bit when brother speaks on this. And
[26:49] there's so many quotes that I could have
[26:51] used. I'll just refer very quickly to
[26:52] them. In part two of the adoption
[26:54] series, he says, "Now when the father in
[26:55] the Old Testament understood that his
[26:57] son was come of age, this time appointed
[27:00] the father, this particular season, he
[27:02] says, and has been seasoned out unto
[27:04] adoption, child trained, reared, taught,
[27:07] tried, proven, tested, right? They're
[27:09] born a child, but they're right, they're
[27:12] a son, right? Then, but then they'll
[27:15] never be no more than just a child, just
[27:17] an ordinary son until they mature and
[27:19] show what they are."
[27:21] Amen. So it's an idea of maturity.
[27:24] Brother A says another place a certain
[27:25] day when this child become matured. One
[27:28] place he's talking about the Holy Spirit
[27:29] coming back to the father and reporting
[27:31] and the father says you think he's well
[27:32] matured like has he grown yet? Is he a
[27:35] has he is he now of full age? Is he able
[27:38] to handle strong meat? Can I give him
[27:39] the next part? He says in another place
[27:42] the son become tutored up brought up
[27:44] getting more mature. The concept is
[27:46] maturity a growing up. That's a
[27:48] character development. As Paul says in 1
[27:51] Corinthians chapter 13 11, when I was a
[27:53] child, I spake as a child. This is when
[27:56] we're we're looking at the idea of
[27:57] perfection and completeness. When I was
[27:59] a child, I spake as a child. I
[28:00] understood as a child. I thought as a
[28:02] child, but when I became a man, I put
[28:04] away childish things.
[28:06] This is what manhood involves. Manhood
[28:08] doesn't mean I've turned to certain age,
[28:10] but manhood evolves. And manhood
[28:12] manifests itself as childish things are
[28:14] put away. his childish things lose their
[28:16] emphasis. His childish behaviors and
[28:18] judgments and discernments and and all
[28:20] those things. As I put it away, I become
[28:21] a man. As I put it away, I become a man.
[28:23] And that's the mark of a man that's
[28:25] maturing. It's a mark of a son and
[28:26] daughter that's maturing is you don't
[28:28] just one time all of a sudden go from
[28:30] child to man. It's the process
[28:34] scripture. the scriptural process from a
[28:35] new birth developing into this image of
[28:38] a of a full-grown son or daughter of God
[28:40] who's mature, who's thinking about the
[28:42] word of God maturely, who's handling
[28:44] circumstances maturely, who's loving God
[28:46] with the mature love. And as Paul was uh
[28:50] correcting the Hebrews, what's the very
[28:52] next thing he says in Hebrews 6? Let us
[28:54] go on into perfection.
[28:56] This is what we ought to be doing. We
[28:57] ought to be striving for this. Our
[28:58] ambition ought to be this. And when he's
[29:00] speaking about that which is perfect is
[29:02] to come, he's saying when I became a
[29:04] man, I put away childish things.
[29:06] I grew up.
[29:08] And as we had read on Sunday, brother
[29:09] Bram said that if the child has been
[29:10] tutored, has been obedient when it comes
[29:13] to a maturity, the age of maturity, he
[29:16] says if he has not been obedient when he
[29:18] comes to the age of maturity, then the
[29:19] child is always a son certainly, but it
[29:22] loses something. Remember that when he
[29:24] comes to this point where hey when you
[29:26] ought to have been this is the time this
[29:28] is the juncture where I could give it to
[29:30] you but he loses the opportunity
[29:34] and I would say not necessarily for good
[29:37] because brother Benam never condemned
[29:38] the church and said you blew it you lost
[29:40] it you had your chance
[29:42] he's correcting them telling them don't
[29:44] suffer in vain
[29:46] if it yet be in vain in other words
[29:48] there's still a chance still an
[29:50] opportunity still rewards to be gained
[29:52] so he comes back to the Galatians In
[29:53] Galatians chapter 4 19, my little
[29:55] children of whom I travail and birth
[29:57] again until Christ be formed in you. You
[30:01] are heirs of God. You are sons and
[30:02] daughters of God. The Holy Spirit has
[30:04] come into your heart and and transformed
[30:06] you into new creatures. Now you are sons
[30:08] and daughters of God. And as sons and
[30:10] daughters of God, you're heirs. So he's
[30:11] putting you under the leadership and the
[30:13] guide of the Holy Spirit to bring you to
[30:14] a place of adoption and rapture and
[30:16] grace. He's there to bring you to the
[30:18] image of the father. All the different
[30:19] terminologies maybe we could fit into
[30:21] that picture. And Paul is saying the
[30:23] same thing to these little children that
[30:24] he is travailing as if in birth himself.
[30:27] What an incredible image. Until Christ
[30:29] be formed in them just as a child would
[30:32] be born and they would grow to the image
[30:34] of the father. Paul is travailing as in
[30:37] giving birth that they too from their
[30:39] birth would come into the image of
[30:40] Christ.
[30:42] And brother Brandham says in the sermon,
[30:43] if God be with us, you can't expect a
[30:45] baby to be born born a man. It's got to
[30:48] grow to it. And if we grow and and we
[30:51] grow in Christ to the full statute,
[30:56] not somebody get converted tonight and
[30:58] tomorrow go preach the gospel because
[31:01] that would be stewardship. That'd be
[31:02] possession, use of gifts. These are
[31:04] things that would be related to a
[31:06] person's growth and maturity and
[31:07] development. He says we grow up into
[31:09] manhood into the stature of Christ.
[31:11] Amen.
[31:12] You're not born again, converted one
[31:14] night and then the next night full
[31:16] possession of gifts to use gifts and to
[31:19] walk in stewardship. He says, "No, you
[31:20] grow into manhood."
[31:23] This is what Paul is saying in Ephesians
[31:24] chapter 4. So, this is where we could
[31:26] just refer to this very quickly. I think
[31:28] we're doing pretty good on time. Then in
[31:31] Ephesians chapter 4, 11-6,
[31:35] Paul is looking at how that God has
[31:36] placed gifts in the church to edify the
[31:39] believer. That's verses 11 and 12. Uh
[31:42] for correction, for instruction, the
[31:43] speaking of the truth and love. These
[31:44] are the things that are being expressed
[31:46] um in this. He says in verse 13, to
[31:48] bring us to the measure of the stature
[31:50] of the fullness of Christ. This is why
[31:52] the the instruction is given. This is
[31:53] why the teaching is given. This is why
[31:55] ministries are existing and the message
[31:57] is made available. This is why we're
[31:58] feeding on the word of God. So that we
[32:00] can um be edified, come into the
[32:03] measure, the stature, the fullness of
[32:04] Christ. It says in verse 15 that we may
[32:06] grow up into him
[32:09] which is the head. This is the growing
[32:10] up. When I became a man, I put away
[32:12] childish things. It's the very image
[32:14] that we have to be that we have to be
[32:16] very connected to that when we're born
[32:18] again, we are sons and daughters of God.
[32:20] And now we've entered into a lifetime
[32:24] process,
[32:25] right?
[32:26] Of growing into his image and becoming
[32:28] what he wants us to be.
[32:30] Amen.
[32:31] It's a process of a lifetime. It's a
[32:33] process of this what this life is for.
[32:35] And that we want to recognize that that
[32:37] when we when we had children, yeah,
[32:39] maybe when your child is born, you're
[32:40] like, "Why won't they talk to me? Why
[32:41] aren't they helping with THE DISHES?"
[32:42] AND COME ON, do something. You just lay
[32:45] there and eat and sleep and cry. Hey,
[32:49] you you've got to be trained.
[32:51] Got to grow. Got to learn these things.
[32:53] It's the same thing as a Christian.
[32:55] It's the same thing as a believer. We
[32:57] can't try to use all those types because
[32:58] I don't want to talk about spiritual
[33:00] DIAPERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. But
[33:01] there's definitely an image that we see
[33:04] in a process of how it works in our
[33:06] lives with children and how it's a
[33:08] lifetime
[33:10] of a relationship of a father to a son,
[33:12] a mother to her son, and parents to
[33:14] their sons and daughters. It's a
[33:16] lifetime of a relationship. I will not
[33:18] be absolved of my responsibility as a
[33:20] father at any point in my lifetime.
[33:23] Yeah. Amen.
[33:24] I will always HAVE TO BE A FATHER to my
[33:26] son, a father to my daughter. I will
[33:28] have to demonstrate to my sons and to my
[33:30] daughter. It's something that I feel the
[33:32] weight and responsibility for for my
[33:34] entire life. And so God did not just
[33:36] birth you say now you got my life. You
[33:38] figure it out and I'll see you in the
[33:39] rapture. No, now he takes that life and
[33:41] he matures it. He grows it. He
[33:43] cultivates it. In the same way that the
[33:45] law of adoption provides us a framework
[33:47] to understand how a natural man would
[33:49] give full possession to his natural son,
[33:51] God is doing the same things with us as
[33:54] spiritual sons and daughters. He wants
[33:56] to give it to you. He even wants to give
[33:57] you that gift of preaching for you to
[33:59] exercise it and use it. But he wants to
[34:01] watch your character first
[34:03] before you step into that. And brother
[34:04] Bram's using that example here. Verse 14
[34:07] to me just sums it up so well. That we
[34:09] henceforth be no more children tossed to
[34:12] and fro and carried about with every
[34:14] wind of doctrine
[34:16] by the slight of men and cunning
[34:18] craftness whereby they lie and wait to
[34:19] deceive.
[34:20] This is this is what brother Brandham is
[34:24] drawing from in the law of adoption.
[34:26] This is what Paul is teaching to the
[34:28] church at Ephesus that we be no more
[34:31] children.
[34:33] That we take this ex experience that we
[34:35] have avail ourselves to the gifts that
[34:37] God placed in our midst and let the word
[34:40] of God that comes forth from those gifts
[34:42] and from the word of God that we read in
[34:44] our Bibles, the word of God that we feed
[34:45] on in the message of the hour, let it
[34:48] mature us and grow us. We're laying in
[34:50] the presence of the sun to get all the
[34:53] greenness baked out of us,
[34:54] right?
[34:55] I want to grow. And in the same way that
[34:57] we have grace on children that we don't
[34:59] allow him to do certain things until
[35:01] they turn a certain age, just legally
[35:02] recognize that God knows our process and
[35:05] our arc and our development and he's
[35:07] patient with us and he's working with
[35:09] us. And what we want to see is not be
[35:11] able to just figure it all out overnight
[35:13] and not just all of a sudden find that
[35:14] magic button that just changes
[35:16] everything, but realize I am a son and
[35:18] daughter of God with my soul that is
[35:20] eternally sealed and saved. And
[35:22] therefore, I am at liberty no longer
[35:24] under the law of sin and death. I'm at
[35:26] liberty to become all that he wants me
[35:28] to become. And I want to fight my way
[35:30] through every trial trial. I want to
[35:32] fight my way through every difficulty. I
[35:33] want to RAISE MYSELF UP AFTER EVERY
[35:36] MISTAKE. I want to look to the cross. I
[35:38] want to remind MYSELF I'M JUSTIFIED. I
[35:40] WANT TO HAVE THAT kind of grace for
[35:41] others. I WANT TO DO EVERYTHING I can to
[35:44] be the very heart of God in the time
[35:46] that I'm living in. And we DO IT WITH A
[35:48] POSITIVE ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE PROMISE.
[35:50] AMEN.
[35:52] YES, SIR.
[35:54] That we be no more children. Brother Ram
[35:56] says in the sermon, "You must be born
[35:57] again. Tonight you're a sinner. Tomorrow
[35:58] you're manifested sons of God." What was
[36:00] he calling out? The wrong kind of
[36:02] adoption teaching that persisted at the
[36:04] time about manifested sons. the
[36:07] manifested sons were the ones that were
[36:08] getting the Holy Ghost. The manifested
[36:10] sons, it was happening in kind of this
[36:11] religious gimmick. He says, "You can't."
[36:13] And he was correcting that doctrine that
[36:15] was going around. He says, "Tonight
[36:16] you're a sinner. Tomorrow you're
[36:17] manifested sons of God. You got Elijah's
[36:19] mantle. You got this. You're doing
[36:20] that." He says, "Nonsense.
[36:23] Where do you get that in the word?
[36:25] Babies are not born men. They're born
[36:26] babies and grow to men."
[36:28] Amen.
[36:30] It's a it's a challenge to even our own
[36:33] impatience, right? and our own
[36:35] misunderstanding of how that God works.
[36:38] So, he comes to this conclusion in a lot
[36:39] of these sermons. I think this one just
[36:41] kind of wraps it up really well because
[36:44] if I could kind of if I could recap it
[36:45] this way, uh Paul is correcting the
[36:49] Hebrew church, the Corinthian church,
[36:53] the Galatian church, then to the Ephesus
[36:56] church, which we know Ephesians
[36:57] parallels Joshua. He this is he's
[37:00] wanting to place them, right? Brother
[37:02] says predestinate unto adoption. says
[37:04] this is Paul now taking that church and
[37:06] placing them positionally. And so it it
[37:08] gives us that image and that mirror then
[37:10] of how God dealt with Israel, how the
[37:12] law of adoption worked in the Old
[37:13] Testament, how that it worked under
[37:14] Roman law. And in each one of these
[37:16] instances,
[37:18] there's this correction wherever
[37:19] something isn't right.
[37:22] And the idea is you claim you have the
[37:25] Holy Ghost, but you're doing this. God
[37:27] can't adopt you, right? You're you you
[37:30] claim to be sons and daughters of God,
[37:31] but you're doing all these things. God
[37:32] can't place you. your ins and outs, your
[37:34] ups and downs, your fussings, your
[37:35] fightings. God can't trust you with the
[37:37] kingdom. You got this, you're doing
[37:38] that, you're staying at home, you're
[37:39] doing this, you're doing that. God can't
[37:40] trust you with more. God can't trust you
[37:42] with more. And what he's trying to say
[37:43] is you you shouldn't be doing that
[37:45] because God has more he wants to give
[37:47] you. And until you get this straight,
[37:48] there's not going to be more.
[37:50] Remember the first series, first sermon
[37:52] in this, I know I mean you remember
[37:53] perfectly. You know the date, you know,
[37:54] whether it was a morning or an evening
[37:56] called the next step. And it was the
[37:58] idea that if we're doing the things that
[37:59] we ought to do, we know the will of God
[38:00] for us this year. there's six things
[38:02] that we can wake up every morning and
[38:03] know this is the will of God for me this
[38:05] year and do those things because if
[38:07] you're doing those things and you're
[38:08] doing those things things faithfully
[38:09] there's a next step
[38:10] there's greater stewardship there's more
[38:12] and there's rewards for doing that and
[38:14] there's and there's more that you can
[38:15] enter into that has its own reward and
[38:18] so brother Bham is correcting you're not
[38:19] doing things right and and there's a
[38:21] cost for this you you you'll always be a
[38:23] son you have the Holy Ghost that's fine
[38:24] you'll always be a daughter of God but
[38:26] you lose something you lose rewards you
[38:28] lose inheritance you don't never come to
[38:29] the place that you ought to be in Right?
[38:31] He's bringing all that out. So he says
[38:33] it and what he's saying is you need to
[38:35] be adopted, but your character and your
[38:36] conduct's keeping you out of it.
[38:39] So disobedient who manifested a lack of
[38:42] holiness, worldliness, divi, deny divine
[38:44] healing, not listening to the Holy
[38:45] Ghost. Uh he called them rousabouts and
[38:47] renegades and uh dilatory and their
[38:50] conduct and their character, all those
[38:52] things. And he's saying they they cannot
[38:56] be adopted, right?
[38:59] and and he's saying they need to be
[39:00] adopted. But let me just point this out.
[39:02] He's not saying the problem is because
[39:04] they weren't adopted.
[39:06] The problem was keeping them from it.
[39:08] So in the sermon here ye him, he says
[39:10] what we need is adoption. Without
[39:13] qualification, he says sons and
[39:14] daughters need adoption. So he doesn't
[39:17] say the disobedient or the obed. He's
[39:18] just saying that's what sons and
[39:19] daughters need. This is God's principle.
[39:20] This is God's program of growing,
[39:22] putting away childish things and
[39:23] growing. But how can the church, the
[39:25] Pentecostal church and the Methodist and
[39:27] Baptist churches be adopted until they
[39:29] come to discipline?
[39:31] We've got to be disciplined first.
[39:41] I think there's a lot there to um just
[39:44] how Catholicism
[39:46] bleeds over into our Christian
[39:48] experience where we feel that we've got
[39:49] to we've got to beat ourselves and harm
[39:52] ourselves and castigate ourselves and
[39:54] make us feel worthless or make us feel
[39:56] hurt and feel pain in order to
[39:58] experience forgiveness.
[39:59] Come on.
[40:02] It's there is a I I I see the image of
[40:05] how we we must be awakened to the
[40:07] horrors of our sins in order to
[40:09] experience forgiveness. But do I always
[40:11] have to become an ungenerate, reprobate
[40:13] heathen and not born again
[40:16] every time in my experience in order to
[40:18] feel the love of God and be accepted of
[40:19] him?
[40:20] Do I always have to be in the mind of
[40:22] the son who wasted his inheritance? When
[40:24] he comes back, just make me a servant.
[40:25] He's like, "Come on, you're my son. Get
[40:26] over here."
[40:27] Right? I don't want to fall into that
[40:29] mindset. So, he's saying they've got to
[40:31] come to discipline. We don't It's not
[40:33] discipline that gets us the Holy Ghost.
[40:36] Right? I I I never I wasn't disciplined
[40:39] to get the Holy Ghost. It was grace
[40:41] that brought me to the Holy Ghost. It
[40:43] was realizing, oh, I should have been
[40:45] done with to start
[40:46] and he's given me this opportunity and
[40:48] he woos me with his love. And so now,
[40:50] having received and been a beneficiary
[40:51] of his love, brother Bam's touched on
[40:53] correction and improvement and
[40:55] instruction and growing and maturing.
[40:57] Says we've got to come to discipline.
[40:58] You got to come to discipline first. God
[41:00] could NOT TRUST HIS THIS power with the
[41:03] church.
[41:04] It's hard to tell what you would do.
[41:08] How could a father trust his business
[41:10] with the boy that would might simply
[41:11] pollute his whole inheritance? So, it
[41:14] has to do with more.
[41:16] He's not weighing whether or not he
[41:18] wants to. It's not the adoption process
[41:20] and he's he's at the orphanage, right?
[41:23] He's kind of going,
[41:25] "Yeah, you look like a rough case. You
[41:27] know, I'm going to sit down. I'm going
[41:28] to interview everybody and I'm going to
[41:30] I'm going to I'm going to find out what
[41:31] they're like. I'm going to play uh
[41:32] doomlings with them and see whether or
[41:34] not they've got the character to handle
[41:35] it if somebody punishes them with the
[41:37] card or let's play the game of sorry and
[41:39] see whether or not you get mad and quit
[41:40] the game. And so you're just sitting
[41:41] there saying, "Nah, you know what? I've
[41:43] been coming all these Saturdays teaching
[41:45] you how to play this game. You still
[41:46] make the same mistakes. I'm looking for
[41:48] somebody else who knows how to play this
[41:49] game right to become my son."
[41:51] That's not the discipline. It's the son
[41:53] who stands to benefit to receive more.
[41:56] Right?
[41:57] And he says the god, he doesn't want to
[41:59] give it to you yet. He can't trust you
[42:00] with this kind of power. You might
[42:02] pollute his whole inter. He says he
[42:03] couldn't do it. The church has got to
[42:06] come to a place where it's discipline.
[42:08] God's on that work right now.
[42:10] Discipline.
[42:12] That means he's still engaged in the
[42:14] process.
[42:16] He's still committed to giving you all.
[42:20] It's his promise.
[42:21] I'm going to work with you. I I'll just
[42:23] testify. I don't like to bring myself
[42:24] into view with in these things, but I'll
[42:26] just testify. God has never quit on me.
[42:30] He's never quit on me. He He He has
[42:33] proven himself to me over and over and
[42:35] over again. No matter what mistake that
[42:37] I would make, and no matter how uh how
[42:40] how uh awful I may feel, no matter how
[42:44] obvious the right response is in the
[42:46] moment, and I don't get it, God has
[42:47] never said, "You blew it. That's it.
[42:49] You're not my son."
[42:50] He's still faithful,
[42:52] saying, "It's still not in vain, Aaron.
[42:55] Keep doing it right. Keep trying. Keep
[42:57] make it right. Apologize when you can.
[43:00] Just keep keep fighting for the right
[43:01] things.
[43:02] I'd love to bring in view to you just by
[43:05] way of picture and I maybe we could
[43:06] amplify it at some other time. You look
[43:08] at the difference between Saul and
[43:09] David.
[43:11] Who sinned the worst.
[43:13] Saul every time he sinned he was wanting
[43:15] to worship or to sacrifice. And you know
[43:18] he I thought I would save these things
[43:19] to sacrifice. A and then I we were
[43:22] waiting for you and you hadn't come yet.
[43:24] So we offered sacrifice. It's almost as
[43:25] if his transgressions were in more a
[43:27] more sincere area where well we wanted
[43:30] to worship before he went to war and you
[43:32] weren't here so we offered sacrifice
[43:33] because we knew we needed to do that.
[43:35] And then he goes to battle and he's
[43:37] supposed to kill everything and he
[43:38] retained some things and and Samuel's
[43:40] like what is it I hear? He says that the
[43:41] bleeding rams goes yeah we were going to
[43:43] SACRIFICE THIS TO GOD. WE'D BE SITTING
[43:45] OVER THERE going yeah you know this guy
[43:47] seems pretty spiritual if you ask me.
[43:50] Meanwhile David's over here what? fill
[43:52] in THE BLANK,
[43:53] RIGHT?
[43:54] DOING THIS and then doing that and we're
[43:57] like OFF WITH HIS HEAD. AND GOD SAYS
[43:59] THAT'S A MAN AFTER my own heart.
[44:01] David's a man after my heart. Why? Not
[44:03] because he had the the the propensity or
[44:05] the capacity to do those evil things,
[44:07] but he had the capacity to repent.
[44:10] He had a heart that God loved because it
[44:13] was a heart that could learn.
[44:15] In other words, David had the right kind
[44:16] of heart that could turn even those
[44:18] mistakes into the right kind of
[44:20] character. Whereas Paul had to receive
[44:22] another spirit to rule
[44:24] because his heart could never be turned
[44:26] into good character. Whereas David had a
[44:28] heart that could become character.
[44:34] And it's the process of discipline that
[44:35] God is using to bring us to that place.
[44:38] Amen.
[44:38] Of character.
[44:41] So let me bring in now what I would say
[44:44] is this kind of clarity that the subject
[44:46] of judgment and rewards gives to this
[44:49] because now we want to use judgment and
[44:51] rewards now as this view again or bring
[44:53] us back to that viewpoint again I'm just
[44:56] using judgment rewards as a framework to
[44:57] understand or using judgment rewards
[44:59] recognizing judgment rewards as a truth
[45:01] that stands on its own and then we see
[45:03] all these other places where it's
[45:04] applicable right
[45:05] and a lot of things of responsibility
[45:07] and day of reckoning all these other
[45:08] ways that we see that the scripture
[45:10] speaks to this and understanding that
[45:12] there's going to be a day where every
[45:14] son and daughter of God will stand
[45:15] before the judgment seat of Christ and
[45:18] and answer right this idea of adoption
[45:22] this youth of adoption helps us
[45:24] understand where does he lose his
[45:25] inheritance where does he lose his
[45:26] rewards it has applicability to that
[45:28] time as brother Brandham even refers to
[45:30] it and so this is where I'd like to
[45:33] bring this clarity in because brother
[45:34] Brandham is looking at the condition of
[45:36] the church he's looking at the
[45:38] Christian's behavior here and he doesn't
[45:41] have any good things to say about it. Uh
[45:43] at least when he's talking about the
[45:45] disobedient and how they need adoption
[45:46] and their dilatory and their conduct and
[45:48] and it's not good. And as I've
[45:50] referenced already, it would be very
[45:51] easy uh to question whether the
[45:54] disobedient had the Holy Ghost or even
[45:56] said how could they be Christians and
[45:58] dressed that way. He says they smoke,
[46:00] they don't go to church, they they they
[46:02] don't believe in divine healing. A lot
[46:04] of things that they have to say about
[46:05] it. And uh and I know that there's some
[46:08] that would even read that list of things
[46:10] and it's wouldn't be they wouldn't be
[46:12] crazy to assume there's no way they have
[46:14] the Holy Ghost and do all those things,
[46:16] right? They just say there's no way they
[46:17] could be smoking, drinking, defying
[46:19] themselves, committing fornication,
[46:20] running around, cause them into lust
[46:21] after. There's no way they could do all
[46:23] of that and have the Holy Ghost. But
[46:25] notably, Brother Brandham said they had
[46:27] the Holy Ghost.
[46:29] He said it. He's the one that's looking
[46:32] at the situation. I don't need to argue
[46:34] with that point. He said it. But what I
[46:36] know he did say is that they couldn't be
[46:38] placed.
[46:40] That these who were demonstrating this
[46:41] kind of behavior, he's saying that they
[46:42] couldn't be placed. These that were
[46:43] demonstrating that kind of behavior
[46:45] could not be adopted. And as I
[46:47] referenced before, it's a paradox. But
[46:49] remember, consider the mixed audience.
[46:51] Consider that he said it in such a way
[46:54] to to not take away from them their
[46:56] experience entirely or to not take away
[46:59] the experience of all of them entirely
[47:01] because no doubt he's preaching to
[47:02] people who never had the experience and
[47:04] others who did have the experience and
[47:06] were confused by the experience of other
[47:08] people. So he had to speak in a way that
[47:10] had the grace to not rob everyone of
[47:13] their experience to whatever degree it
[47:15] was. So he had just the right way to
[47:17] speak that I would say if they did not
[47:19] have the Holy Ghost and their conduct uh
[47:22] their conduct demonstrated it. They
[47:24] would know that there was still more in
[47:26] their experience, humble themselves,
[47:28] repent, seek the tutelage and the
[47:30] guidance of the of the of the teacher
[47:32] and take a step further and be closer to
[47:34] the seal if they didn't have it
[47:37] because he's the way he dealt with them
[47:38] would be a way of of grace. And so also
[47:40] remember the dispensational element as
[47:42] well that exists that brother Brandham
[47:45] has bring us to a time of adoption which
[47:46] is tied to the rapture. Rapturing grace
[47:48] and adoption is tied to that. But this
[47:51] the rewards this is the part that I want
[47:54] to uh use it in in closing
[47:58] uh it's a term of art closing
[48:03] and it's it's up to you to interpret it.
[48:06] Right? I'm the artist. You interpret the
[48:09] closing however you would like. [snorts]
[48:12] But in the concept of rewards, we read
[48:14] the statement at the very very beginning
[48:16] of this series, maybe part two or part
[48:17] three, where brother Brandham is writing
[48:19] in the church age book, the Ephesians
[48:20] church age. He says, "How beautifully
[48:21] the savior praises and commends his
[48:22] children. He takes full account of their
[48:25] fine spiritual attitudes and behaviors."
[48:27] And he says he knows that there's
[48:29] weakness, but he's not yet correcting
[48:30] them because of the weakness. He does
[48:32] not yet cry out against it. Isn't that
[48:34] just like the Lord? He says now remember
[48:36] when we get to Leodosa he doesn't even
[48:38] take time to compliment him because
[48:39] there is no compliment it's just rebuke.
[48:41] So brother Brandham does is in that very
[48:43] pattern of the leotiness. He's rebuking
[48:45] first rebuking first. Rebuking first and
[48:48] he says and then so the message is be
[48:50] zealous therefore and repent. So this is
[48:51] what I want you to recognize that God is
[48:53] doing. He knows how to encourage us in
[48:55] the right matters and discourage us in
[48:57] the wrong matters.
[48:59] And he says this is how that God deals
[49:01] with each one of us this way.
[49:04] He knows how to encourage us in the
[49:07] right matters, discourage us in the
[49:09] wrong matters. We need to learn a lesson
[49:11] how that God deals with each one of us.
[49:12] So he says, "Don't ever be discouraged,
[49:14] saying of God." And what does it refer
[49:15] to? For God is not ungracious to forget
[49:18] your labors of love. What is the very
[49:19] subject matter? Whatever we do, even
[49:21] giving a cup of cold water to someone
[49:23] has a reward and blessing from the Lord.
[49:25] So in the context of ultimately
[49:27] receiving a reward and blessing is the
[49:30] nature of God to discourage us in the
[49:33] wrong things and encourage us in the
[49:35] right things. And so in light of our
[49:37] inheritance and our reward, God wants to
[49:39] first discourage us in the wrong things.
[49:42] But he also wants to encourage us in the
[49:44] right things. Amen.
[49:46] And I believe when we understand this
[49:48] concept of God giving out rewards and
[49:51] crowns and a full inheritance, this
[49:52] whole picture of what brother Brandon
[49:53] was trying to present to us as believers
[49:55] becomes clear because I think we could
[49:58] all agree it's easy to see what the
[49:59] disobedient lacked. I mean, because he
[50:01] spells it out so plainly. They're doing
[50:03] this, they're doing that, they're doing
[50:04] this, they're doing that. And our our I
[50:06] our reaction might be just if we looked
[50:09] at that side alone and maybe you all
[50:11] could be honest with me if as I read
[50:13] those statements some of us might have
[50:15] been saying doesn't sound like a
[50:16] Christian to me doesn't sound like what
[50:19] a a church should look like people
[50:21] staying home watching television people
[50:22] dressing worldly I know that our our
[50:24] tendency is then to say those aren't
[50:26] Christians and then we what we decide is
[50:28] that what brother Brandham was doing is
[50:30] he was using the framework of adoption
[50:32] to bring those people to a birthight And
[50:35] if that's the only picture, the only
[50:37] part of the picture we looked at, it's c
[50:39] it's certainly logical
[50:42] and maybe you wouldn't be wrong to try
[50:43] to use that line to catch the attention
[50:46] of the sinner, to catch the attention of
[50:47] the disobedient a and to bring him to a
[50:50] place of a birth and a seal.
[50:52] But that's not the only part of the
[50:53] picture that brother Brandham paints.
[50:56] We could look at the disobedient sign
[50:57] and be like, "That guy's aroused about.
[50:59] He's a renegade. It's hard to imagine
[51:00] that he even has the Holy Ghost. I don't
[51:01] know why Brother Brandham said he had
[51:02] the Holy Ghost." But in order to see the
[51:04] picture more clearly, we recognize that
[51:06] he says that child needs adoption and
[51:07] will never get his reward and we'll
[51:09] never get his inheritance. What we need
[51:10] to do is change the picture.
[51:14] Turn the page or look at the son on the
[51:16] other hand. These are all terminologies
[51:17] that brother Brandham used because what
[51:18] about the other son that brother
[51:20] Brandham paints in the picture?
[51:23] There was a disobedient son and there
[51:24] was a unobedient son and he was one that
[51:30] also needed adoption.
[51:33] Abraham says in the sermon, "Hear ye
[51:34] him." These are all different here ye
[51:36] him too.
[51:38] I hear them, brother Aaron. I hear them.
[51:40] Says, "Oh, I wish I had the voice of God
[51:42] and could stand here and the time we
[51:44] could stay on that for hours of the
[51:46] disobedience of the church of God and
[51:48] the Holy Spirit is bringing that word
[51:49] back and forth.
[51:54] I could He's saying I could spend hours
[51:56] on how the church is disobedient and not
[51:58] where it ought to be." He says, "Now,
[52:00] but what if that child has done good?"
[52:03] Oh, how the sp Holy Spirit likes to
[52:05] bring their character.
[52:08] He's changing the picture.
[52:09] If all we focused on the disobedient, I
[52:11] think we'd have a we'd have a we'd have
[52:13] a an understanding. It's a little bit
[52:15] imbalanced and we would be okay. We'd be
[52:17] justified to say, "Well, I think they
[52:19] need the Holy Ghost, Brother Aaron. I
[52:20] think there's no way that that sister
[52:21] could be doing that brother could be
[52:23] doing that. You mean they're doing these
[52:24] things and how could they have the Holy
[52:25] Ghost?" And we've got the quotes to
[52:26] prove it, right? But again, brother's
[52:28] using a framework. He's using drama.
[52:31] He's addressing his audience. He's he's
[52:32] he's very consistent in how that he does
[52:34] this. So, we're not we don't want to
[52:36] just look at one side of it and build a
[52:37] doctrine out of that. We don't want to
[52:38] use the type and the type itself becomes
[52:40] the doctrine or the truth. We got to
[52:42] look at the whole picture because
[52:43] brother Brandham just didn't talk about
[52:44] the son on the one hand. He talked about
[52:45] the son on the other. He says, "I could
[52:47] spend all night for hours about the
[52:48] disobedient. But in order for the
[52:51] picture to be right,
[52:52] what about the other son who does good
[52:55] and how the Holy Spirit likes to report
[52:57] on his character?
[52:58] He says in adoption part two, that
[53:01] adoption series part two says, "But now
[53:02] let's change the picture."
[53:04] Now the father, his son is a good boy.
[53:07] So you have a bad boy who needs more
[53:10] correction. You have a bad boy that
[53:12] needs more attention. You have a bad boy
[53:13] that needs to be taught more. You have a
[53:14] bad boy that needs some discipline. But
[53:16] now you got a good boy. He says let's
[53:19] change the picture
[53:21] and here you him. He says now when the
[53:22] father finds a child that's obedient.
[53:25] How he likes to come and say sir your
[53:27] boy is a perfect child. How obedient
[53:29] your children are. How they love to
[53:32] worship you. This is different.
[53:35] This is a complete different image that
[53:37] he's wanting to break raise up before
[53:38] the people. He says in another sermon
[53:40] he'd hear ye him. He says but la now
[53:42] let's change the picture. This is the
[53:46] language that he used. On the other
[53:48] hand, let's turn the page. Let's change
[53:49] the picture. We've looked at this
[53:51] disobedient guy so much. We see their
[53:53] sins. We see their disobedient. We hear
[53:54] the rebuke. We hear the challenge. But
[53:56] in order to have a better understanding,
[53:57] let's change the picture. He says, "And
[54:00] perhaps, what if this child is an
[54:01] obedient child? Oh, they're just at the
[54:04] father's business." Does just the same
[54:07] thing the father does. Does the things
[54:10] that's pleasing as Jesus said he did.
[54:14] What? This is a this is a son that's
[54:16] coming into the image of the father.
[54:18] This is the son that the f the tutor's
[54:20] coming back saying, you know what, he's
[54:23] doing exactly what you do. He's
[54:25] learning. He's picking this up. I told
[54:27] him this is how you do it. That's how he
[54:28] does it. And and brother Bam does kind
[54:30] of leave out maybe the corrective
[54:32] measures that might have took place. He
[54:33] said he was kind of coming to a point. I
[54:34] asked him to do something. He disobeyed.
[54:36] He did this. I had to bring a little
[54:37] correction, but he got right back in
[54:38] line. He's doing these things. Brother
[54:39] Bram's kind of given this glowing report
[54:41] that the tutor must have. does things
[54:43] just as Jesus did. This is what Paul
[54:45] encouraged the Ephesian church to do now
[54:47] that they have these gifts operate in
[54:48] their midst. He says, "Be therefore
[54:50] followers of God as dear children. Walk
[54:52] in love as Christ also loved us, hath
[54:55] given himself for us as an offering and
[54:56] a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling
[54:58] savor." And what does he say in verse
[55:00] 10? Proving what is acceptable. Proving
[55:03] what is acceptable unto the Lord.
[55:05] Proving our lives are going to prove
[55:06] what's pleasing. Prove what is
[55:08] acceptable. This is what we ought to be
[55:09] doing. being followers of God as dear
[55:11] children. We become imitators of God.
[55:14] The only way that we can imitate Christ
[55:16] is when we are like his son who is in
[55:18] the image of God.
[55:20] So we are we are followers of God as
[55:22] dear children. This is what brother B
[55:24] was talking about. Oh, he's just like
[55:25] you. He does the same things the father
[55:27] does. He's doing everything pleasing
[55:29] just as Jesus did.
[55:31] The sermon hear ye him.
[55:34] I never I didn't count all these but
[55:36] they just keep coming one after another.
[55:38] He says, "But what if he was a good
[55:40] boy?" And when THE FATHER SAID, "HOW IS
[55:42] MY SON PROGRESSING?" OH, the tutor says,
[55:45] "Father, you know what? Your boy is just
[55:48] exactly like you. He's about your
[55:50] business. He does it just the way you
[55:52] would do it. Why? The whole kingdom here
[55:54] can see your reflection right in that
[55:56] boy." Oh my. That's what we want. That's
[55:59] it. Reflections of Jesus Christ.
[56:02] He knows how to discourage us in the
[56:04] wrong matters. But now, what is he
[56:05] doing? encouraging us in the right ones.
[56:08] He's used adoption to say, "See all
[56:10] these things here? It's not fruitful.
[56:13] Get away from it. Shun it. Recognize the
[56:15] leaven of it. Teach your children not to
[56:16] do those things." But now he's putting
[56:18] before us the right image. And he's
[56:19] encouraging us in the right matters. He
[56:21] says that's what we want to be
[56:22] reflections of Jesus Christ. And you'll
[56:24] find that what he's referring to is when
[56:26] the life of the father is being
[56:27] manifested in the sun. It's being
[56:29] expressed. The life by the birth is
[56:32] being expressed. When we as sons and
[56:34] daughters of God are allowing the life
[56:36] which we receive by the new birth to be
[56:38] expressed to be manifested out. This is
[56:40] what he's referring to. And as I've said
[56:43] already to be careful a and to be very
[56:46] uh very sensitive to the subject matter
[56:48] and and try not to fall into any uh any
[56:50] fanaticism with it. We can't even as we
[56:54] look to both sides of this picture. We
[56:55] we don't want to get legalistic. We
[56:57] don't want to create a standard that
[56:59] dishonors the word. What God is doing is
[57:01] God is discouraging in the wrong
[57:03] matters, encouraging in the right
[57:04] matters.
[57:05] Why? Because there's a full inheritance
[57:07] to be gained.
[57:08] He's discouraging in the wrong matters.
[57:10] He's encouraging the right matters
[57:11] because he wants to give you the
[57:13] kingdom. So he's discouraging in the
[57:14] wrong matters so that you can your
[57:16] character can grow that you can be in
[57:17] the place to receive a, as John said, a
[57:19] full reward.
[57:22] Part two of the adoption series, Brother
[57:24] Brandham says, but now let's change the
[57:26] picture. Now the father, his son is a
[57:29] good boy. We referred to it just a
[57:30] moment ago. He says that he's a tutor.
[57:32] Here's a tutor. The Holy Spirit. He
[57:34] said, "I'm going to walk."
[57:38] The child said, "I'll walk right with
[57:40] you.
[57:41] I'll go I'll go right with you." So,
[57:43] following the leadership of the Holy
[57:45] Spirit, right? The tutor. This is this
[57:46] he's there in your life. They that are
[57:48] the sons of God are led by the spirit of
[57:50] God. So, this is a son with the Holy
[57:52] Ghost. And the Holy Spirit says, "I'm
[57:53] going to go on a walk." And the son
[57:55] says, "I'm going on a walk."
[57:57] All right? He grabs the leash, right?
[58:00] Let's do this. I'm at the door waiting.
[58:02] Let's go. I'm going on a walk. The child
[58:04] said, "I'll go right with you." Oh, the
[58:06] hill's awful high, son. I'll go with
[58:08] you. I got confidence in you. If I start
[58:11] to get tired, you'll raise my head up
[58:12] and hold me on.
[58:14] This is different.
[58:16] You know, we actually have the picture.
[58:17] The Holy Spirit tells us to go on a walk
[58:21] and says, "And it's a high heel and
[58:22] we're I don't think I can make it." He's
[58:23] like, "Are you even my son?"
[58:26] We got to completely Don't WE HAVE THE
[58:28] PICTURE COMPLETELY BACKWARDS? WE HAVE
[58:30] THE HOLY SPIRIT TELLING US TO HIKE A
[58:31] MOUNTAIN and he's DOWN THERE WITH THE
[58:33] STOPWATCH.
[58:35] COME ON, YOU
[58:37] You've been in the message this long.
[58:38] You can't even make it UP THIS LITTLE
[58:40] MOLEHILL.
[58:41] THAT'S WHAT WE GET IN our mind that we
[58:42] think that's exactly what the Holy
[58:43] Spirit's doing. As opposed to the Holy
[58:45] Spirit, let's climb this mountain. It's
[58:47] like let's I'm going to climb this
[58:49] mountain. Said I want to climb it with
[58:50] you. He's like, hey, it's a large
[58:52] mountain. He said, but you're aren't you
[58:53] leading? Right.
[58:54] I got confidence in you, Lord, that if
[58:56] it gets too hard, you'll bear me up.
[58:58] That if I need the right kind of uh
[59:00] technique, if I need the right kind of
[59:01] equipment in the right moment, you'll
[59:03] give me what I need to climb this
[59:04] mountain. You're there with me through
[59:06] this whole process. HE SAYS, YOU'LL
[59:07] RAISE MY HAND up and hold me on.
[59:10] But there's lions up on the hill there.
[59:12] Don't matter as long as you're around.
[59:14] Don't make a bit of difference. I'm
[59:15] walking right on in. Who's the
[59:17] confidence in anyhow? Not yourself. Not
[59:20] your OWN ABILITY. THERE'S TROUBLE UP
[59:22] THERE. It's slick rocks. I don't care.
[59:24] As long as you're holding my hand, I'LL
[59:25] WALK RIGHT WITH YOU. I'LL WALK RIGHT
[59:27] WITH YOU. This is what the father wants
[59:30] to see. This is what JESUS CHRIST DID.
[59:33] THIS IS PERFECTION. THIS IS WHAT HE'S
[59:36] WANTING TO GROW US to and GIVE US TO. I
[59:38] I I'VE SAID IT BEFORE. HE'S WANTING TO
[59:40] HE'S trying to teach you to trust him.
[59:43] God does not put you through the paces,
[59:45] PUT YOU THROUGH SUFFERING SO THAT YOU
[59:47] LACK confidence in your experience. HE'S
[59:50] DOING IT THAT YOU GAIN MORE CONFIDENCE
[59:52] IN HIM.
[59:53] Let's not let it work to the contrary
[59:55] WHERE I'M LESS SURE OF MYSELF AS A SON
[59:57] AS I'VE EVER BEEN BEFORE. NO, YOU OUGHT
[1:00:00] TO be certain that you're A SON AND MORE
[1:00:02] CONFIDENT THAT HE'S YOUR FATHER AND MORE
[1:00:04] CONFIDENT THAT HE'S GIVEN YOU WHAT IT
[1:00:05] TAKES. AND THIS is what he wants to use
[1:00:07] to get us to a place
[1:00:09] as a son that makes him proud.
[1:00:11] Amen.
[1:00:13] The the the perfection here that honors
[1:00:15] Christ is not the Holy Spirit says, "I
[1:00:18] want to climb that mountain." and you
[1:00:19] say, "You stay there, buddy. I can do
[1:00:20] this." It's dependency.
[1:00:23] He says, "If you're holding my hand,
[1:00:25] I'll walk right with you." Oh, you know
[1:00:26] what? Your dad used to do that.
[1:00:30] That's good. Yes, sir. Get on top of the
[1:00:33] hill there.
[1:00:34] He said, he's recognizing Christ. That's
[1:00:36] what Christ did.
[1:00:39] And so now he says, "You know what,
[1:00:40] Father?" Now he reports,
[1:00:43] "Your son is just like a chip off the
[1:00:45] old block. He is absolutely exactly like
[1:00:48] you. Every word that you say, he says
[1:00:51] amen to it.
[1:00:55] Now, how many here just by show of hands
[1:00:57] would say that you're you're somewhat
[1:00:59] familiar enough with the teaching on
[1:01:01] adoption and the subject of hearing him
[1:01:03] to know what brother Brandham said about
[1:01:07] the obedient son.
[1:01:09] He needed
[1:01:12] adoption,
[1:01:14] did he not? Right?
[1:01:15] Did not all this behavior, we'll read
[1:01:17] some of the statements here in a moment.
[1:01:18] Did not all this behavior put him in a
[1:01:20] place where now the father could trust
[1:01:22] him
[1:01:23] and give him the full inheritance?
[1:01:25] Brother Brandham never drew the
[1:01:27] conclusion, now that son is a son who's
[1:01:29] already adopted.
[1:01:31] That's not how brother Brandham taught
[1:01:32] it. He didn't teach it that that son's
[1:01:34] already adopted. He actually says he's a
[1:01:36] chip off the old block. How could he be
[1:01:38] a chip off the old block in the nature
[1:01:39] of the father if he didn't have the
[1:01:41] father's life?
[1:01:43] How could he be doing all these things
[1:01:45] and being led of the spirit if he was
[1:01:47] not a son learning to be a son?
[1:01:51] No, this is brother Brandham giving us
[1:01:53] the necessary balance to the picture of
[1:01:55] the of the child of ob disobedience and
[1:01:58] giving us the picture or the disobedient
[1:02:00] child. Not say the child of
[1:02:01] disobedience, but the disobedient child.
[1:02:02] He's given us this picture so that we
[1:02:04] can come out right. He says, "I'm not
[1:02:06] TRYING TO SCOLD YOU. I DON'T WANT THIS
[1:02:07] TO HURT. I WANT TO PUT SOMETHING BEFORE
[1:02:09] YOU." AND YOU can't walk out with the
[1:02:11] conclusion when he's done correcting the
[1:02:13] disobedient. You have to stay around
[1:02:15] because the disobedient through
[1:02:17] correction ARE GOING TO BECOME THE
[1:02:19] OBEDIENT.
[1:02:20] And so maybe it's not so much a change
[1:02:22] OF PICTURE WHERE YOU'RE looking at A
[1:02:24] DIFFERENT CHILD, BUT YOU'RE looking at a
[1:02:25] different year in the yearbook.
[1:02:27] You're looking at a different page IN
[1:02:29] HIS LIFE STORY. THIS IS WHAT HE WAS
[1:02:31] THEN, BUT this is what he is now. This
[1:02:32] is what he used to be, but this is WHAT
[1:02:34] HE IS NOW. WHY? BECAUSE HE IS STILL
[1:02:37] WORKING ON HIS SON. That's good.
[1:02:40] And he comes all the way to point. He's
[1:02:41] a chip off the old block. He's exactly
[1:02:42] like you. Every word that you say, he
[1:02:45] says amen to it. That is the evidence of
[1:02:48] what?
[1:02:50] The evidence of the Holy Ghost. Brother
[1:02:52] says in a number of different places,
[1:02:54] this is the true evidence of the Holy
[1:02:55] Ghost. So, he's affirming the
[1:02:57] experience. He's showing us that this is
[1:02:59] a son who has been born again by the
[1:03:01] baptism of the Holy Ghost, who is still
[1:03:04] in the process, but is achieving the
[1:03:06] results.
[1:03:08] This is a fruitful child of God. One
[1:03:10] walking in obedience, suffering
[1:03:11] according to the will of God. And
[1:03:13] brother Brandham uses I I want to read a
[1:03:16] from uh I'm going read from a new here
[1:03:18] ye him and then another one that I may
[1:03:20] have quoted from before. Two more quotes
[1:03:22] from here ye him just to bring this to
[1:03:24] this clincher. Brother Brand was using
[1:03:27] the subject of adoption to encourage us
[1:03:29] to press on for more.
[1:03:31] Amen.
[1:03:32] To encourage thou those who are
[1:03:34] struggling with disobedience to
[1:03:36] struggling with certain things. He's
[1:03:37] saying there's more.
[1:03:39] There's more here to provoke love, to
[1:03:42] provoke obedience, to to stir them up,
[1:03:44] to stir up their experience. And he's
[1:03:46] doing this to encourage those who are in
[1:03:49] the pattern of obedience to remind them
[1:03:52] that this is what God rewards,
[1:03:54] that it's not in vain. And so in the
[1:03:57] sermon, hear ye him in 62, he says, and
[1:03:59] he's done this just exactly the way you
[1:04:01] do. This is that report of the the
[1:04:04] tutor. No different, just exactly. It's
[1:04:06] just like you there. It's your life in
[1:04:09] them. Sure. And you look at all the
[1:04:11] things that Brother Brandham says this
[1:04:12] son does. He goes up to the prayer
[1:04:13] meeting. He lays hands on the sick and
[1:04:14] they recover. He believes in baptizing
[1:04:16] the name Lord Jesus Christ. He's
[1:04:17] overcoming sin. He goes to church. He's
[1:04:19] doing this. And he's naming all these
[1:04:20] things that he does. And he's saying
[1:04:22] that this is the son who's following the
[1:04:25] leadership of the Holy Spirit. And this
[1:04:26] is the son that has come to the place of
[1:04:28] adoption, a place of trust. And we don't
[1:04:31] want to make the mistake of ever
[1:04:33] suggesting that that son was doing it by
[1:04:35] his own discipline
[1:04:37] to earn the new birth
[1:04:39] or by his own discipline to earn the
[1:04:41] baptism of the Holy Ghost. We've changed
[1:04:43] the picture. We're using a different
[1:04:45] type.
[1:04:45] Amen. We've we've ch we changed it all
[1:04:47] together because now we use the same
[1:04:49] brother is saying let's look at
[1:04:50] something and we can only if we if we
[1:04:52] try to use it if we look at it that this
[1:04:55] is teaching to try to bring us to a seal
[1:04:56] of God then this is what's happening
[1:04:58] with the obedient son and he's earning
[1:05:00] the new birth
[1:05:01] and brother Bam never taught that
[1:05:03] right
[1:05:04] so this is to encourage us your life in
[1:05:07] him for sure you can sure tell he's a
[1:05:09] son of God because he was BORN AFTER YOU
[1:05:11] HE DOES THE SAME THING STAYS RIGHT WITH
[1:05:13] YOUR WORD NEVER MISSES A WORD STAYS
[1:05:15] RIGHT INTO IT PUNCHES IT RIGHT on
[1:05:16] through. Oh, the father must say,
[1:05:18] "That's wonderful." And there come a day
[1:05:21] then if this son continued on, there
[1:05:24] come a day to what they call the placing
[1:05:27] of a son.
[1:05:30] There came a time to reward the
[1:05:31] faithfulness. There came a time to give
[1:05:33] him a greater inheritance.
[1:05:35] There came a time to where now he had
[1:05:36] would come into possession and heir,
[1:05:38] falls, but says to all that the father
[1:05:40] had to come into legal possession of it.
[1:05:42] Again, remember it's a type
[1:05:45] to understand God's process.
[1:05:48] And I wouldn't even I would say that we
[1:05:50] should be very careful. Maybe I come
[1:05:52] across very forceful and very
[1:05:53] convincing. I think that we should be
[1:05:55] very careful to not try to put a period
[1:05:58] on it in the sense that say, "All right,
[1:05:59] well then this is how it works." That if
[1:06:00] we just are all good and we get there on
[1:06:02] the day of judgment, then God's going to
[1:06:03] give us legal possession of everything.
[1:06:05] It's a framework to understand the
[1:06:07] process that we're in
[1:06:09] and knowing that there's a promise of an
[1:06:10] inheritance down the road.
[1:06:13] We read this as the last statement.
[1:06:14] Musicians, you're welcome to come now.
[1:06:16] He says, we read this last Sunday at
[1:06:18] some point. The father took him out into
[1:06:20] a public place and set him up before the
[1:06:21] public place. Before the public, this is
[1:06:23] the obedient son. The son that looked
[1:06:26] just like the father. This is the son
[1:06:27] that was doing these things, right? He
[1:06:29] says his same son that had been born in
[1:06:32] his home years before all the time his
[1:06:35] son but his character and his conduct
[1:06:37] had brought him to another office.
[1:06:42] This is the image. This is what the
[1:06:43] image is of the of the adoption process.
[1:06:47] The obedient son to receive praise, a
[1:06:49] higher praise, a greater honor
[1:06:51] ultimately receives that full
[1:06:52] inheritance.
[1:06:54] It's that as we mentioned on Sunday,
[1:06:55] this is a new reward of praise. This is
[1:06:58] a new reward of honor that he could come
[1:07:00] into a new office. The the the nobleman
[1:07:02] went away to receive a new kingdom,
[1:07:03] Christ is going away to prepare a place.
[1:07:05] And that when the nobleman comes back to
[1:07:07] those who are faithful with the with the
[1:07:09] pound are given 10 cities and another
[1:07:11] faithful with the pound was given five
[1:07:12] cities. He says, "What is it?" It's the
[1:07:14] new office. It's the new opportunities.
[1:07:16] [music] It's the ruling and reigning
[1:07:17] with him in the millennium. It's that
[1:07:19] it's part of that image of the child
[1:07:21] training and the rearing that we're
[1:07:23] going through now as sons and daughters
[1:07:24] of God to bring us to that place where
[1:07:26] [music] he can trust us.
[1:07:29] And the point of teaching on adoption or
[1:07:32] what [music] what brother Bam is
[1:07:33] pointing out and how he's teaching on it
[1:07:34] to me drives home
[1:07:37] the point that God drives home the point
[1:07:38] that brother Bam drives [music] home is
[1:07:40] that God's not finished with you yet.
[1:07:43] Brother Bram didn't pronounce judgment
[1:07:46] on the disobedient. He just reminded
[1:07:48] them, you keep going like that, you're
[1:07:50] going [music] to lose something.
[1:07:52] But he changed the picture to give us a
[1:07:54] separate image and understanding that if
[1:07:56] there's a [music]
[1:07:57] if there's a faithfulness, then there's
[1:07:59] a reward for faithfulness.
[1:08:02] There's a there there's a challenge, I
[1:08:05] [music] believe, that's coming forth to
[1:08:06] say with everything that is in you,
[1:08:07] pursue perfection from a place of
[1:08:10] [music] promise.
[1:08:12] Makes no sense to be an orphan at the
[1:08:15] foot of a cross begging for him to make
[1:08:17] you a son. [music]
[1:08:19] Makes no sense for us to be the beggars
[1:08:22] at his door [music] begging for him to
[1:08:24] give us bread. At it it completely we
[1:08:27] what we've done is we've taken ourselves
[1:08:29] out of our position. [music] We've if
[1:08:31] anything whatever place that we did have
[1:08:33] by the new birth we've completely
[1:08:34] abandoned it and now we assume the the
[1:08:37] position of orphans and beggars [music]
[1:08:39] asking God to do something for us where
[1:08:40] he says no you come to where your place
[1:08:43] is [music] and as a son and daughter you
[1:08:46] can pursue perfection because it's a
[1:08:48] promise
[1:08:50] and I believe that we ought not to let
[1:08:52] the goal discourage us when Jesus says
[1:08:53] be therefore perfect as your heavenly
[1:08:55] father which is in heaven is perfect. We
[1:08:57] ought not to let it discourage us. In
[1:08:58] other words, we could look at that and
[1:09:00] say, "I'll never make it." But we ought
[1:09:01] to have the attitude of this son who
[1:09:03] says when he says, "Be ye therefore
[1:09:05] perfect even as your heavenly father is
[1:09:06] perfect." He says, "Well, then I'm going
[1:09:07] to be perfect." Well, it means it means
[1:09:09] a perfection that no human can attain
[1:09:11] to. [music] Well, I know I can't, but
[1:09:12] aren't you leading me? Aren't you going
[1:09:14] to guide me? You wouldn't ask me to do
[1:09:15] something if you wouldn't equip me to do
[1:09:17] it. There's this attitude of saying,
[1:09:18] "God, if you want me to do it, then
[1:09:20] you're both in me to will and to do of
[1:09:22] your good pleasure." And therefore, as
[1:09:25] believers, as sons and daughters of God,
[1:09:26] we ought to be ambitious.
[1:09:28] Yes, sir.
[1:09:29] We ought to be positive. We ought to be
[1:09:30] craving a positive gospel. We ought to
[1:09:33] be hearing the word of God in a positive
[1:09:35] way that we know is building me up as a
[1:09:37] son or daughter of God and reminding me
[1:09:39] that that uh eternity is in me. Oipence
[1:09:43] is in me. The power to go create a world
[1:09:45] and live on it is in me. THEREFORE, IF
[1:09:47] I'VE GOT POWER LIKE THAT, THEN OH GOD,
[1:09:50] TRAIN ME TO HAVE THE RIGHT KIND OF
[1:09:52] CHARACTER TO USE THAT [music] POWER.
[1:09:56] And recognize that the more that we
[1:09:58] surrender, the more that we can live
[1:10:00] like that.
[1:10:02] As Paul says, [music] being confident of
[1:10:04] this very thing, that he which hath
[1:10:07] begun a good work in you will perform it
[1:10:10] until the day [music] of Jesus Christ.
[1:10:16] Now
[1:10:17] a lot of translations say he will
[1:10:18] [music] perfect it. He will complete it.
[1:10:21] And the word there is a perfection. It
[1:10:23] is completion. But Paul says it as a
[1:10:26] process.
[1:10:28] He will perform [music] it until the day
[1:10:30] of Christ.
[1:10:32] He will keep doing it until you [music]
[1:10:35] stand before the judgment seat. He's not
[1:10:38] finished with you yet.
[1:10:40] [music]
[1:10:40] He there's a song that I heard recently
[1:10:43] and I just like the chorus. It's uh it's
[1:10:45] it just taken a hymn and adds a little
[1:10:47] bit of a bridge to it. He's not [music]
[1:10:49] done with me yet. His presence goes
[1:10:50] before me. That there's a to know that
[1:10:54] I'm following him and he's not finished
[1:10:57] through my weaknesses, through my
[1:10:58] mistakes, through all my years as a
[1:11:00] husband, [music] through all my years as
[1:11:01] a father, through all my years as a
[1:11:02] minister. That he's not done with me yet
[1:11:04] in any one of those capacities.
[1:11:06] Amen.
[1:11:06] That this isn't the final outcome. Even
[1:11:08] [music] as Paul, if Paul could come to
[1:11:10] the place to where say, "I do not act as
[1:11:11] one who is apprehended. I'm still
[1:11:13] pressing for more rewards. I'm [music]
[1:11:14] still pressing for a greater prize."
[1:11:16] Then that ought to be our attitude in
[1:11:18] this I in with this understanding that
[1:11:20] he which has begun the work [music] will
[1:11:23] continue to perform it
[1:11:26] until completion. As the psalmist said,
[1:11:28] "The Lord will perfect that which
[1:11:30] concernth me."
[1:11:32] He will perfect that which concernth
[1:11:35] [music] you.
[1:11:37] I believe that that's a confidence that
[1:11:39] we can have as believers
[1:11:41] and I believe that we ought to live in
[1:11:42] that with everything [music]
[1:11:44] that is in us.
[1:11:46] Just wanted to sum up a little bit more
[1:11:48] on losing crowns. I think Lord willing
[1:11:49] maybe [music] this Sunday we'll finish
[1:11:50] this subject on judgment and rewards.
[1:11:53] Amen.
