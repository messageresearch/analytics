[0:00] continue on the where we were on Sunday
[0:03] as this has been a series on the house
[0:04] of the Lord a lot of things that we've
[0:05] touched on continue on Sunday but I'm
[0:07] just going to change the title a little
[0:09] bit it's going to be housed but homeless
[0:11] and so the idea is you're housed but yet
[0:14] you don't have a home and that's been
[0:16] something that's been a consistent theme
[0:18] in this house of the Lord and even
[0:20] though the title in the series implies
[0:22] the house of the Lord we're looking at
[0:25] this Dynamic that we've emphasized quite
[0:27] a bit in the beginning I'm going to
[0:28] repeating some things this evening
[0:30] on how that you could have all the image
[0:33] of a house but yet not have the real
[0:35] feeling of a home and that's what we're
[0:37] touching on the unhoused as we used it
[0:40] Sunday the unhoused and the homeless we
[0:42] use that kind of title to express that
[0:44] you can be the unhoused and you could be
[0:47] the homeless and it could be one person
[0:49] those could be two different people you
[0:50] could be uh without a home but yet have
[0:53] a house you could have a home but not a
[0:55] house and so there's different ways that
[0:56] you could describe that so the unhoused
[0:59] they lack that physical shelter and it
[1:02] it it focuses whether or not someone has
[1:03] a permanent place to put their
[1:05] possessions or lay their head or a
[1:06] permanent resident whereas to say
[1:09] someone that is homeless and we're
[1:10] looking at maybe even the evolution of
[1:12] our uh language even to the point to
[1:14] where we may not have traditional
[1:16] housing but they have a home and they
[1:19] they they're unhoused they don't have
[1:20] the physical structure but yet they have
[1:23] uh they feel a part of a community they
[1:24] have certain resources uh that they
[1:26] could draw upon they have access to
[1:28] certain relationships um and they have a
[1:30] sense of belonging to where they could
[1:31] be in a tent Community a home community
[1:34] of homeless people they don't have
[1:35] traditional housing but yet they feel
[1:37] like oh this I have some sense of Home
[1:40] in how I'm living and we used the
[1:43] example of a church like this one as a
[1:46] house and how this church would be a
[1:49] traditional place of gathering a
[1:50] traditional place of worship and how
[1:52] that someone could be as a Christian you
[1:55] can be housed because you go to church
[1:57] but yet homeless and we're using that
[1:59] example uh even tonight still drawing on
[2:02] that example that you could have a place
[2:04] of worship a place that you go a place
[2:06] that you attend and a place that you say
[2:08] that's your church but yet something's
[2:10] lacking in the experience that's not
[2:13] what a a church should be it's not that
[2:15] home church that brother brandham said
[2:17] that we ought to have and where we're
[2:20] focusing on as the issue is you could
[2:22] have um the unhoused we say oh the
[2:25] solution is just buy them a place to
[2:26] live but homelessness often isn't an
[2:30] issue of housing but it's an issue of
[2:32] vision and it's issue of character and
[2:35] even if we looked at the uh epidemic
[2:38] that we might have in our nation or in
[2:39] our city that sometimes there's a he
[2:41] healing that needs to take place where
[2:43] someone isn't able to work and not being
[2:45] able to work they're not able to make a
[2:46] living uh and and not making a living it
[2:49] leads to a housing crisis and so it
[2:51] could be physical disability it could be
[2:53] a mental health issues and so what they
[2:55] need is a healing they need something to
[2:57] minister to them in their actual need
[2:59] not just throw a house at them because
[3:00] there's some people in their condition
[3:02] that if you gave them a house they would
[3:03] squander it because they wouldn't have
[3:05] maybe the mental fortitude at that time
[3:07] and the mental illness and they don't
[3:09] want to waste it but they they struggle
[3:11] they have weaknesses they have sickness
[3:13] both in body or in mind and so it's not
[3:15] an issue just as merely giving them a
[3:17] place to live but it's a matter of um
[3:21] providing them a vision a life worth
[3:24] living and something to strive for it
[3:26] was characterized this way as I read it
[3:28] about that initial homelessness that
[3:30] became a crisis in America it was a loss
[3:32] of character and a perceived emerging
[3:35] emerging moral crisis that threatened
[3:37] leld ideas of home life now that phrase
[3:40] Lon held ideas of home life today I want
[3:43] to start looking at that idea of home
[3:45] life rather than on the lack of a
[3:47] permanent home so when this became an
[3:49] issue after the Civil War and in the
[3:51] industrial era and even into the turn of
[3:53] the century they weren't looking at it
[3:55] as oh these people need houses they're
[3:56] like these people need character uh
[3:58] they're they're not living the
[4:00] traditional they don't they don't value
[4:02] the ideals of a home life they don't IDE
[4:04] value the stability of home life they
[4:06] don't even value their role within a
[4:07] home because a man would just be out
[4:09] working and traveling around and maybe
[4:11] he sends money back maybe he tries to
[4:13] keep connected with home uh with his
[4:15] family but they recognized that it was a
[4:17] problem o of not being committed to a
[4:20] place homelessness was well there's no
[4:21] place there's no position there's no
[4:23] purpose a sense of belonging no value
[4:25] for things that had long been held as
[4:28] valuable we read it from Proverbs 29:8
[4:32] where there is no vision and this is a
[4:34] Divine Oracle a revelation from God if I
[4:37] could put it this way where you do not
[4:38] know the will of God where you do not
[4:40] have an understanding of the will of God
[4:42] the people perish but he that keepeth
[4:44] the law who follows in his will happy is
[4:47] he so without a purpose life is
[4:50] perishing no matter how you're living it
[4:53] no matter how wonderful it may seem to
[4:55] be uh life cannot satisfy and it cannot
[4:58] bring the comfort and peace that one
[5:00] desires if they're not living according
[5:02] I'll say this about Christians those who
[5:04] ordained to follow God those who are his
[5:06] elect seed you cannot be happy unless
[5:08] you're keeping that law for your life
[5:10] that word for your life that will for
[5:12] your life so where you're living uh uh
[5:14] without purpose without Vision then
[5:16] you're going to be disappointed life is
[5:18] going to be uh just hit or miss it's
[5:20] perishing as the scripture says they'll
[5:23] perish they Wonder aimlessly they're not
[5:25] disciplined they're they're unrestrained
[5:27] so they can go here they can go there
[5:29] they can do this can do that and there's
[5:30] no no force or no uh principle that's
[5:34] guiding them and so we may be housed but
[5:38] without a purpose without intent without
[5:40] Vision brother was fellowshipping uh
[5:42] with me and just on his family and his
[5:44] vision he says that he needs to remind
[5:46] himself to be more intentional at times
[5:48] as a family and I think that's good that
[5:49] we need to think about what are we doing
[5:51] uh momentum can just kind of swallow us
[5:54] up where it's just kind of the uh uh
[5:56] it's physics we're just headed down the
[5:58] road a a and this certain inertia that
[6:00] we have and it just we just keep doing
[6:02] what we're doing and we don't stop to
[6:03] say what direction am I headed and do I
[6:05] need to apply some Force to it to get it
[6:07] going the right direction or to slow it
[6:09] down because life just has a way of
[6:11] accumulating and so if you don't you may
[6:13] be housed but if you don't have a vision
[6:15] you won't have a home one religious
[6:18] group defined it this way at the turn of
[6:19] a century or after the Civil War a
[6:21] crisis of men this homelessness was a
[6:23] crisis of men let loose from all the
[6:26] habits of domestic life wondering
[6:28] without aim or home remarkable to Define
[6:32] it that way that this was at the core
[6:33] again they weren't saying we need to
[6:34] have better housing we need to provide
[6:36] them with an apartment we need to excite
[6:38] them about a plot of land and a a nice
[6:40] mansion but it was more a character
[6:42] issue to where they had become
[6:44] untethered from the habits of domestic
[6:46] life and we're wandering without home
[6:49] and without an
[6:50] aim now I want to be able to run this in
[6:53] parallel because I think there's a
[6:54] spiritual parallel for us as individuals
[6:56] a and making our hearts home for the
[6:58] Lord Jesus Christ and finding our
[7:00] purpose and belonging in the body of
[7:02] Christ not in a church not in a public
[7:03] identity not in a group move and so
[7:06] there's this application that we could
[7:07] have to us as individuals and our coming
[7:10] to our place and our position
[7:12] understanding our role in the economy of
[7:13] God and and so that's always there but
[7:15] we're using Church life as an example of
[7:18] home life and and I do not believe that
[7:21] church life is the ultimate I believe
[7:22] Church affords us some types of the
[7:24] ultimate which is your individual life
[7:26] or your home life and we're using Church
[7:29] Life to say as we expounded upon it
[7:31] Sunday you could be housed in a church
[7:33] but not have a home Church you have a
[7:36] church house and some people have church
[7:38] in their house right and they tell
[7:41] themselves because they play tapes in
[7:42] their home that they have a church but
[7:44] yet when we really dig into what brother
[7:45] bandam said about what a church is
[7:47] there's more to it than than than just
[7:50] saying that you're going through the the
[7:52] Motions of
[7:54] something
[7:57] okay now let's answer this let's posee
[8:01] the question and then I have the luxury
[8:02] of being the one that ask it so I have
[8:04] all my material to answer it what is
[8:07] home uh when we speak of home what
[8:09] images arise and What feelings arise uh
[8:13] this has kind of a personal thing it
[8:15] means a lot to me and my family because
[8:17] we did travel extensively and even there
[8:20] was a point in 2019 where we were
[8:22] essentially homeless living out of a
[8:24] Buick Enclave until we got to the next
[8:25] stop and the next hotel or the next home
[8:28] and for 6 months once we were just on
[8:30] the road and we didn't feel that we had
[8:31] a home and and that house you know we
[8:34] had a house but yet even the children
[8:36] the children didn't necessarily think of
[8:37] that as home us being together is what
[8:40] made it home to where even after we had
[8:42] moved to North Carolina and we were
[8:44] there for three or four months uh Jack
[8:47] had asked the question is Dad done
[8:48] preaching here like when are we going to
[8:50] pack up the car and drive to the next
[8:51] stop a a and yet so there's an idea of
[8:54] that we had an idea of home that wasn't
[8:56] necessarily rooted in the house that we
[8:58] had built and so what what thoughts
[9:00] arise what images and feelings do we
[9:02] think about when we think about home and
[9:04] I want to look at two phrases home is
[9:06] where the heart is and just the
[9:08] utterance home sweet home and home
[9:11] suggest a community in some of the
[9:14] definitions it would have to imply some
[9:15] sort of traditions or rituals that are
[9:17] associated with your life a and things
[9:20] that a family does I think it's good to
[9:22] think of it this way cuz some families
[9:24] do things that your family don't do uh
[9:26] some families May uh well some families
[9:28] may not open Christmas gift at all but
[9:30] you know just for the sake of
[9:31] conversation uh some families may open
[9:33] all their Christmas gifts on Christmas
[9:35] Eve and then another family may open
[9:37] them all on Christmas morning and so
[9:39] when you enter another family through
[9:40] marriage and you're there and it's like
[9:42] Christmas Eve comes and the husband
[9:44] wants to open all the gifts
[9:45] like we don't do that well it's like
[9:49] who's the wi anymore right because this
[9:51] is a new family new family unit so
[9:53] there's there's Traditions that can be
[9:54] established or even kept that speak of
[9:57] what home is and how families are and
[9:58] our family do this and our family does
[10:00] that and every family is
[10:03] different and there's people who find
[10:05] themselves comfortable in families that
[10:07] are loud around the dinner table
[10:09] laughing at each other picking on each
[10:10] other and having a good old time and for
[10:12] some other people they may be like that
[10:15] would be an awful
[10:16] family there's families that get
[10:18] together on Thanksgiving and they all
[10:19] wear the same thing right and for some
[10:22] families there may be that particular
[10:24] Dynamic and it's toxic because you have
[10:26] one person who's controlling all of it
[10:27] and whose heart would be broken if you
[10:28] didn't show for Thanksgiving and it's
[10:30] more of manipulation and emotional abuse
[10:32] that does it but then for other families
[10:34] they're all excited about it because
[10:37] that's the every family is different and
[10:40] so the ideas of family of of a home it
[10:43] has to do with tradition and possessions
[10:45] and valuables and the phrase home is
[10:47] where the heart is as I tracked it back
[10:49] to a poem uh to where home is where the
[10:53] heart is published in 1829 that they
[10:56] don't get give an author to it but it
[10:58] kind of speaks to the idea and even the
[11:00] phrase now speaks to the idea that home
[11:02] and family this idea of home and the
[11:05] family that's there that's associated
[11:06] with are the greatest emotional bond
[11:09] that you may be somewhere but home is
[11:11] where your heart is the Bible even tells
[11:14] us uh that where your treasure is there
[11:16] will your heart be also so it's what you
[11:19] treasure it's what you value it's what's
[11:21] important and this uh poem published in
[11:24] 1829 it was used to express the idea
[11:26] that the physical structure is not the
[11:28] home where you are even presently in the
[11:31] manner of life you're living don't
[11:32] necessarily make it home but it's where
[11:34] you feel safe and comfortable and loved
[11:37] and and the poems that are a lot of them
[11:39] written kind of build looks like they're
[11:40] building off the same literature they
[11:42] speak of relationships and connections
[11:44] and
[11:45] belonging there was one published in
[11:47] 1836 called the home of the heart it's
[11:50] unsigned we don't know who the author is
[11:52] but it was published in Massachusetts
[11:55] and one of the stanzas is yet here's
[11:57] deep affection the wonderer to bless a
[12:01] mother's fond welcome a sister's caress
[12:04] isn't that right
[12:07] Sons yet here's deep affection the werer
[12:10] to bless the Wonder is blessed in this
[12:12] deep affection the mother's fond welcome
[12:14] as sister's caress far dearer than
[12:17] Cottage or proud princely dome for homes
[12:20] where the heart is and this is sweet I
[12:23] love how it just interrupts at the very
[12:25] end there and so it speaks of deep
[12:27] affection that one who is roaming finds
[12:30] and is blessed by when he comes back to
[12:32] that place and it identifies the
[12:34] mother's welcome or the sister's caress
[12:36] and it's better than a princely dome
[12:38] it's better than a cottage for home is
[12:40] where the heart is and that's sweet and
[12:42] so we also have the expression home
[12:44] sweet home and it expresses uh the
[12:47] pleasure at being in home or returning
[12:50] to home like oh I've been traveling I've
[12:53] come back home sweet home as I've
[12:55] already alluded to it the image of home
[12:57] is probably different for a lot of us
[12:59] uh individually there maybe some Vin
[13:01] diagram where it all overlaps for us but
[13:03] for some people home is in another
[13:05] country home is a particular place or
[13:07] it's a feeling that they can have in
[13:09] different uh in different areas but the
[13:11] idea of home that's that place of peace
[13:13] and provision and comfort safety and
[13:15] rest again we've said before a place of
[13:17] belonging it even is rooted in a place
[13:19] of beginning so something you're
[13:21] connected to or have a tie to John
[13:24] Howard Payne in the tradition of great
[13:25] poets uses all three names he uh writes
[13:29] the poem home sweet home sweet home and
[13:32] this is the one that brother brandham
[13:33] references several times I'll just read
[13:35] the whole thing just for cool points it
[13:38] says mid pleasures and palaces though we
[13:40] May Roam be it ever so humble there's no
[13:42] place like home the charm from the sky
[13:45] seems to hollow us there which seek
[13:47] through the world is near met with
[13:49] elsewhere home home sweet sweet home
[13:52] there's no place like home oh there's no
[13:54] place like home how s Sweet did his sit
[13:57] neath the Fawn father's smile and the
[14:00] caress of a mother to soothe and beguile
[14:02] let others Delight mid new Pleasures to
[14:05] Ram but give me oh give me the pleasures
[14:07] of home home home sweet sweet home
[14:11] there's no place like home oh there's no
[14:13] place like home to thee I'll return
[14:16] overburdened with care the hearts
[14:18] dearest soulless will smile on me there
[14:21] no more from that Cottage again will I
[14:23] roam be it ever so humble there's no
[14:25] place like home home home sweet sweet
[14:28] home there's no place like home oh
[14:30] there's no place like home oh give me
[14:35] no I could just start getting into
[14:37] poetry at this moment but you see the
[14:39] feeling of it and the meaning behind it
[14:41] and these different ones I'm referencing
[14:43] from 1829 this one from 1823 1836 when
[14:47] you begin to have this homelessness
[14:49] crisis after the Civil War and
[14:51] industrialism comes in and and cities
[14:54] where it's more um it's different
[14:55] different Lifestyles and you have men
[14:57] leaving the the Homestead to go work in
[15:00] in plants and those things the idea of
[15:02] Home becomes very different
[15:04] Transportation kind of expands The
[15:06] Horizon of where men can work and we
[15:08] have this moral crisis that threatens
[15:11] the long held ideas of home life these
[15:13] ideas of home life are expressed in
[15:16] these poems expressed in these lines of
[15:19] home sweet home and and there this is
[15:21] where the a Wonder finds is blessed by
[15:24] this deep affection and it talks about
[15:26] the mother and the sister and the father
[15:28] so it's these
[15:29] relationships and the love that each one
[15:32] has for another that when overburdened
[15:33] with care my heart's dear soulless will
[15:36] smile on me there it's a place where my
[15:39] burdens can be set free it's a place
[15:41] where though rejected and hurt elsewhere
[15:43] I can find acceptance and love there be
[15:46] it ever so humble there's no place like
[15:49] home I know you all as message Believers
[15:52] are familiar with all those different
[15:53] places that brother Branham quotes that
[15:56] very poem and as we used this scripture
[15:59] even over the last couple months in
[16:01] Isaiah
[16:03] 32:18 and the effect of righteousness is
[16:05] going to be this and my people shall
[16:07] dwell in a Peaceable habitation and in
[16:10] sure dwellings and in quiet resting
[16:13] places I said this is a perfect summary
[16:16] of what home ought to be that it's not
[16:18] the structure it's not the the uh it's
[16:21] not marble countertops it's not
[16:23] necessarily the crown molding in the
[16:25] living room and the things that would
[16:27] just trim something out to be gorgeous
[16:29] and very beautiful but this is what
[16:31] makes a place home that it's Peaceable
[16:33] it's sure and it's a quiet resting place
[16:37] that Peaceable habitation as we've
[16:39] emphasized before it's not a place of
[16:40] fighting it's not where you're sleeping
[16:42] with the Enemy it's a place where you
[16:45] can rest be at peace where there is no
[16:48] Strife assured dwelling place means it's
[16:51] secure you can be confident all the
[16:53] resources that you would have need of
[16:55] that's the place where it's provided so
[16:57] there is no Strife there is striving and
[17:00] for it to be a quiet resting place
[17:02] there's no there's this sense of ease
[17:04] even when you have to labor such that
[17:06] it's not just a place of Labor where
[17:09] you're working and doing laundry and
[17:11] cleaning and looking after the kids but
[17:12] it's a place where you can rest and
[17:15] there's no tension there's the tension
[17:16] is
[17:18] released we want to have Peaceable
[17:20] habitation sure dwellings and quiet
[17:22] resting places that's what we would want
[17:24] our church to be that's how we would
[17:25] want our spirits to be our spirits to
[17:27] find and that's how we want our homes to
[17:29] be remember how that brother bradam said
[17:32] home is not the house it's the order of
[17:34] the house so it's not the house but it's
[17:36] the order that makes it a home it's the
[17:38] character on the inside that makes a
[17:40] home so you could have a house but if
[17:42] you don't have the right character if
[17:43] you don't have the right order the right
[17:45] Arrangement it is a house and you can be
[17:47] housed but you can still be homeless
[17:49] because he said the home is a order of
[17:51] the
[17:53] house it's I had some share different
[17:55] articles with me how that uh when I
[17:57] ministered this on Sunday day and it I
[18:00] wasn't really conscious of it but the
[18:01] Supreme Court is taking up issues
[18:03] related to homelessness and there's a
[18:05] lot of article and opinion pieces so
[18:07] people were sharing different things to
[18:08] me and the New York Times actually had
[18:11] kind of put at the very top of their uh
[18:14] publication on Sunday uh it was an
[18:17] opinion piece from February when I
[18:18] tracked it down it was called a life
[18:20] without a home was the the the whole
[18:22] piece and they had these different
[18:24] opinions and articles contained in this
[18:27] where it says a tent is not a home and
[18:28] couch is not a home or a a car is not a
[18:31] home a motel is not a home and it would
[18:33] say a mo a home is not a motel or a car
[18:37] is not a motel and it like a fill-in the
[18:38] blank and they repeated it over and over
[18:40] again and they mentioned how that in in
[18:43] 2007 they begin to actually keep record
[18:45] of the number of homeless people in the
[18:48] United States and this past year uh
[18:52] there they re revealed the LA latest
[18:54] count that they did revealed the highest
[18:56] number of unhoused people in the history
[18:58] since they've been counting it and they
[19:00] estimate that 3 point of of this record
[19:03] number so focus with me here I may be a
[19:05] little nervous and and knew at this so I
[19:07] may be a little Shifty but you're a
[19:09] veteran so stick with me but an
[19:11] estimated 3.7 million Americans live at
[19:14] someone else's house and they call it
[19:17] couch surfing or doubling up and and I
[19:19] realize even for some of you some of
[19:21] these things are very real we're not
[19:22] just talking about statistics you read
[19:24] about you've lived this and so what
[19:26] doubling up is it's not your house
[19:28] you're living in someone else's house
[19:30] now again I'm wanting to run this
[19:32] parallel of this Dynamic that makes a
[19:34] house a home and that just because we
[19:36] have a house that we call our own maybe
[19:38] we don't have a place that we can call
[19:40] home right and that can go with churches
[19:43] and that can go with our own families
[19:45] and it is called homelessness hidden in
[19:49] plain
[19:50] sight so there's people who are not
[19:52] staying in their own place they're
[19:53] sleeping on someone's couch they're
[19:55] living in someone's house they're
[19:56] doubled up with someone else and either
[19:58] the uh Department of Housing and Urban
[20:00] Development doesn't even count these
[20:03] that are doubled up in their
[20:05] homelessness count they don't even
[20:07] consider them as unhoused they just say
[20:10] Well they're living with somebody
[20:11] they're living somewhere so don't we
[20:13] don't include them in our statistic
[20:14] they're saying there's over 3.7 million
[20:16] that are living in someone else's house
[20:18] doubling up or couch surfing and this
[20:21] New York Times article said it this way
[20:22] it all conjures a Rosy scenario in which
[20:26] someone takes in friends or family
[20:27] members Who Fallen on Hard Times
[20:29] offering them Comfort safety and a roof
[20:32] over their heads now that's the idea
[20:34] right Comfort safety but in reality
[20:37] doubling up is a much more complicated
[20:39] under the radar form of H homelessness
[20:43] not Holiness
[20:45] homelessness I hope you're able to still
[20:48] stay connected to the spiritual
[20:49] principles of even yourself individually
[20:51] our churches and especially that that
[20:53] life we live as a family in our houses
[20:56] that doubling up is a much more
[20:58] complicated under the radar form of
[21:00] homelessness it may be a temporary
[21:03] solution a precursor to living in a
[21:04] shelter or on the street or part of a
[21:06] cycle of housing instability that
[21:08] involves crowded living conditions and a
[21:10] devastating lack of privacy and safety
[21:14] so it's just kind of this veneer for a
[21:15] moment for a season for a time oh you're
[21:18] living with something but it could just
[21:19] be a temporary solution where it's just
[21:22] a precursor to being in a homeless
[21:23] shelter or living on the street or part
[21:25] of this crisis of instability
[21:28] that are are scenarios where it's a
[21:30] devastating lack of privacy and safety
[21:33] so I would say that these who are
[21:34] doubling up who are couch surfing living
[21:36] out of cars or in motels in these
[21:38] different places they're housed but
[21:40] homeless they may have the physical
[21:42] shelter or as it that things says a roof
[21:45] over their heads but they don't have
[21:46] much of anything else that home should
[21:50] be now again think of your family your
[21:53] family life or quote unquote your home
[21:55] life and think of an experience at
[21:57] church and I want you now to begin to
[21:59] think of this idea of being housed in
[22:03] church but you're really couch
[22:06] surfing and if anyone's thinking is he
[22:08] trying to run us off like is this not
[22:10] home come on but I'm wanting you to
[22:12] think about it even if it's a way to
[22:14] understand maybe your prior experience
[22:15] or understand what someone else is going
[22:17] through or constantly checking up with
[22:19] yourselves to make sure you're not
[22:21] surfing on somebody else's couch here
[22:23] right you find hey I want to be in the
[22:25] will of God I don't want to just be
[22:26] doubling up because now listen to these
[22:28] EXP experiences that they elicited from
[22:30] these people who were living with
[22:32] friends and family and doubling up and
[22:33] they didn't have a place they could call
[22:35] home even though they had a roof over
[22:37] their head now as we run that parallel
[22:39] that analogy from this past Sunday think
[22:41] of it in these terms I'm going to read
[22:43] from uh five different people that are
[22:47] yeah five different people who've had
[22:48] this experience and may just be four
[22:50] here says this is one's experience in
[22:52] living with somebody we've got to be
[22:54] quiet we can't talk loud brother John if
[22:56] you want to just as soon as you hear
[22:57] that key you could pop this up I realize
[22:59] I have that I forgot all about the slide
[23:02] we can't have fun we can't do nothing
[23:05] it's like living in jail we got to be
[23:07] sneaky because of the neighbors they're
[23:09] really set in their ways and they ain't
[23:11] trying to have nobody that stay over
[23:13] there that don't live there so this is a
[23:16] we have to be quiet we can't talk loud
[23:17] we can't have fun it's no fun we can't
[23:20] do anything it's like living in
[23:22] jail another person in their expenses
[23:25] about this individual who offered them a
[23:27] place to stay it was a woman with her
[23:28] child he makes me feel like we're
[23:30] welcome to stay in his house but it's a
[23:32] little uncomfortable because now that
[23:34] I'm staying there our relationship I
[23:36] want you to think spiritual about this
[23:38] our relationship went from a friendship
[23:39] about about work to some odd feeling
[23:42] like he likes me or wants to date me but
[23:44] we have nowhere else to go I notice how
[23:47] being in a place you don't belong that
[23:48] you can't call your own Le LS itself to
[23:52] awkward relationships with
[23:54] others or even to the one who owns the
[23:56] house that makes you feel
[23:59] awkward because they keep telling you
[24:01] there that he's your spiritual husband
[24:03] and you got to listen to
[24:06] him and then another one said it this
[24:08] way it can cause a strain on even the
[24:10] best
[24:11] friendships as much as it's nice that
[24:13] people will do that it's a burden for
[24:15] them to take up that extra
[24:17] space I I just look at these phrases
[24:19] that we've kind of collected here on the
[24:21] screen another person said living with
[24:23] my sister feels terrible and everybody
[24:25] said no living with my sister feels
[24:27] terrible it's very
[24:29] tense so here's one it's family and and
[24:31] this is maybe a sister that they love
[24:33] and a sister that loves them enough to
[24:34] say hey you're in bad times come live
[24:36] with me but they're doubled
[24:39] up again think very deeply about this
[24:41] it's obviously a situation where there's
[24:43] a power Dynamic that that is out of
[24:45] balance because one has more resources
[24:47] or it's their house their name's on the
[24:49] deed they're paying the mortgage and so
[24:50] there's not the shared responsibility
[24:52] they're not in it together they're not
[24:53] partnered you're at a disadvantage you
[24:55] go and move in with your sister and
[24:57] you're living with your sister cuz
[24:58] you've fallen on Hard Times you can't
[25:00] pay your own bills and now that you
[25:01] begin to live with them even though this
[25:03] is a person you love it feels terrible
[25:05] and it's very tense amen now let's just
[25:09] take these words and I I thought I'd
[25:11] changed it to just jail but I maybe I
[25:12] didn't update it living in jail an odd
[25:14] feeling a strain terrible tense
[25:16] uncomfortable does that describe
[25:19] home now it may describe your
[25:22] house hopefully not but that's not what
[25:26] home should be home should never be
[25:28] terrible home should never be tense or a
[25:31] jail it should never be an odd feeling
[25:33] or uncomfortable that's not the way that
[25:36] home should be in Proverbs chap 21:9 it
[25:40] says it's better to dwell in a corner of
[25:42] the Housetop than with a brawling woman
[25:44] in a wide house other words you'd be
[25:46] better off couch
[25:48] surfing you'd be better off renting out
[25:50] the corner of a housetop than living
[25:53] with a brawling woman in a wide house
[25:56] now this isn't I'm not just picking on
[25:58] women that are
[26:00] Brawlers uh but I would say that any
[26:02] situation where there's brawling going
[26:04] on in the house you'd be better off in
[26:05] the corner of a rooftop than having a
[26:07] really nice house and a bunch of
[26:08] brawling taking place therein I know it
[26:11] may seem to be calling out the women in
[26:12] this in verse 19 it's better to dwell in
[26:14] the wilderness this is some tough stuff
[26:16] it's better to dwell in the wilderness
[26:18] than with A continuous and an angry
[26:21] woman I didn't want too loud of an amen
[26:24] there said it's better to be homeless
[26:28] or if I could say better to be
[26:30] houseless than to live with a
[26:32] contentious and angry
[26:34] woman because if you live with a
[26:36] brawling woman if you live with a
[26:37] contentious and angry woman let me just
[26:39] phrase it this way a brawling man a
[26:41] contentious and angry spouse a selfish
[26:44] and angry children if everyone is
[26:46] emotionally um upset and these words
[26:49] speak of strife and contention and this
[26:51] judging and even speaks of being vexed
[26:54] or frustrated there's this
[26:56] tenseness if anything I think these
[26:58] words could describe a jail so you say
[27:00] you're better living in the wilderness
[27:01] than in the jail of that house you'd be
[27:04] better living in the corner of a hous
[27:06] toop than living in that terrible
[27:08] condition that you're living in now and
[27:10] it speaks to the idea that the the
[27:12] atmosphere in the place that you live is
[27:15] going to determine whether or not it's
[27:16] really worth living there and these
[27:19] people in their experiences they they
[27:21] have a place that they can lay their
[27:23] head they may have a place where they
[27:24] can keep some of their limited
[27:25] possessions but they can't they can't
[27:27] live as want to they got to be quiet
[27:29] they can't be loud they can't have fun
[27:30] it's like living in jail it's
[27:32] uncomfortable friendship that we once
[27:34] had is now changed where it's this odd
[27:36] Dynamic and there's pressure there
[27:37] because there's a disparity in
[27:39] relationship and it becomes a strain
[27:41] even in the best of friendships and and
[27:43] it feels terrible and it's very tense
[27:45] what this is it's it's it'd be better to
[27:47] live in a different situation than even
[27:49] to live in that
[27:51] situation I know maybe that's those are
[27:53] difficult words to say but if the
[27:54] Bible's going to say you'd be better in
[27:55] the corner of a housetop than the live
[27:58] in a contentious terrible uncomfortable
[28:01] striving tense situation then it speaks
[28:04] that we ought to have a different kind
[28:06] of
[28:07] atmosphere where we
[28:10] live and they go on to note in this
[28:12] article a life without a home in this
[28:14] opinion piece that contains several
[28:16] different um articles that are written
[28:18] by different authors and expresses the
[28:20] Vantage points of different people who
[28:22] are
[28:23] unhoused it talks about how beyond the
[28:25] day-to-day challenges for themselves
[28:27] whether it's trying to to get a job or
[28:29] uh uh or you know shower in these
[28:31] different things and these different
[28:32] conditions and the challenges of the
[28:33] living conditions it they they identify
[28:37] how this kind of situation impacts
[28:40] children in Greater ways than it does
[28:42] the
[28:42] Adults now again think of church and
[28:45] think of home and one person said of
[28:47] their children they're behaving poorly
[28:49] in school my oldest is always worried
[28:52] about me and has a hard time focusing
[28:54] the kids seem depressed more now now
[28:58] I realized the the tendency would be to
[29:01] think yeah if I was living out of a car
[29:02] if I was living with a a sister and it
[29:04] feels terrible and it's tense and and
[29:06] you look at those different
[29:07] circumstances it's easy for us just to
[29:09] become a spectator and just learning
[29:12] maybe this of another person's
[29:14] experience it's just anecdotal but now
[29:16] just think of ourselves as I'm trying to
[29:18] present a scenario where we have not
[29:20] made our houses
[29:21] homes and even though we have a roof
[29:24] over our heads the interactions among
[29:26] family members creates an environment
[29:28] that produces the same type of behaviors
[29:30] in children because they don't feel
[29:32] comfortable in the place that they're
[29:33] living as they ought
[29:36] to and that could be the same even in
[29:38] churches we don't think sometimes just
[29:40] how negatively children could be
[29:42] impacted in
[29:45] churches just by the atmosphere and the
[29:47] spirit in a church and I realize
[29:50] sometimes we people will um assess
[29:52] whether or not they want to attend a
[29:53] church by what it can do for their
[29:55] children and they're looking in a very
[29:57] shallow way
[29:58] by whether or not there's a bunch of
[30:00] kids there or a youth group or and
[30:02] things like that instead of considering
[30:04] overall what's the character of the
[30:06] church and what kind of impact will that
[30:08] have on my children do I want them to
[30:11] become what that church is turning out
[30:14] right just I'm just giving some
[30:16] practical things
[30:17] tonight in another place this person
[30:20] writes of their daughter I know it
[30:21] affects her she tries to hide it she's a
[30:24] child I want her to be a child I don't
[30:26] want her to worry about why mommy's up
[30:28] set these are adult concerns those are
[30:30] things that she shouldn't have to wor
[30:32] have on her mind I wish she didn't have
[30:33] to experience any of
[30:35] that problems it if you're just housed
[30:39] are you following me if we're just
[30:42] housed there's something missing that we
[30:45] all need when we're just housed when
[30:48] we're homeless in our own houses when
[30:50] we're homeless in our churches there is
[30:51] a deficit spiritually there is a damage
[30:54] that we as adults are incurring and
[30:55] we're living through the strain of it
[30:57] and wrestling with things that are
[30:58] taught or way things are done and we
[31:00] experience it as family and we try to
[31:02] maybe hide it from the children and
[31:03] listen we don't really do a good job of
[31:05] it but yet we try to protect them in
[31:07] some ways but yet even without them
[31:09] knowing completely what's going on in
[31:11] the church politics and the fact that we
[31:13] don't have a home church we just have a
[31:15] church house they feel it and experience
[31:17] it
[31:18] too I'm going to go ahead and read this
[31:20] one it's lengthy and I I think it might
[31:22] just be the phrase that they use at the
[31:24] very end so my only goal is making
[31:27] making sure my kids stay happy so they
[31:29] don't think about the situation we're in
[31:31] every time they start doubting or they
[31:33] get weary I just say this is just going
[31:35] to make us stronger it's going to bring
[31:37] us closer together you could tell your
[31:39] kids about this so they could say my mom
[31:43] she did not give up she did not give up
[31:45] she kept fighting I think that's that's
[31:48] admirable and it's say because this is
[31:50] this is a person who's thinking about
[31:52] the future and wants to overcome this
[31:54] and even recognize this isn't ideal and
[31:56] I got to keep fighting I want to go on
[31:57] she says my kids are the reason why I'm
[31:59] not in a crazy house right now and I
[32:02] just thought what a unique phrasing cuz
[32:05] in some way she is in a crazy house but
[32:07] she's saying the far far worse is if I
[32:09] didn't have my children if I wasn't
[32:10] looking out after my children I would
[32:12] have gone insane she says I probably
[32:13] should have been years
[32:15] ago as as I read these experiences
[32:18] whether it be on that first part as we
[32:20] dealt with the house but homeless and
[32:22] now the challenges to children in the
[32:25] family it shows us how that just
[32:27] providing
[32:28] mere housing especially where we're
[32:30] doubled up especially where we're couch
[32:32] surfing or in these different uh
[32:34] Dynamics where we don't have some sense
[32:36] of ownership or belonging it leads to
[32:38] those Force relationships we're just by
[32:41] virtue of this proximity to this
[32:42] individual and this frequency of
[32:44] interaction that well there's some Duty
[32:46] or obligation you owe to them or yet
[32:48] they feel that they have some power over
[32:50] you and whenever you're in a scenario
[32:52] where it's someone else's house and you
[32:54] don't feel you're at home it's going to
[32:56] lead to that codependent
[32:58] dependency and codependency gives rise
[33:01] to all sorts of negative Dynamics think
[33:04] of how that it might be that if you're
[33:05] going to be homeless and if you don't
[33:06] have if you you're going to be houseless
[33:09] and so without this place to go you
[33:11] don't have a place to live and how that
[33:12] could be like I'm completely dependent
[33:14] upon you I'm at your mercy and that can
[33:17] lead to abuse and manipulation and
[33:20] control and a lot of negative Dynamics
[33:23] upon that individual because they don't
[33:24] have any ownership they don't have any
[33:25] say they don't have there's no sense of
[33:28] belonging this is out of
[33:30] necessity and God forbid that we would
[33:32] ever be in a place where well there's
[33:33] just nowhere else to go to church so I
[33:35] just guess I got to be a prisoner or
[33:37] there's just nowhere else I can go that
[33:39] lends itself to very negative
[33:43] Dynamics home needs to be a place of
[33:45] Love needs to be a place of Grace and
[33:48] forgiveness I'll read quotes that
[33:49] substantiate this in a
[33:51] moment and this is what this is what was
[33:54] in my heart on Sunday and I'll say it
[33:56] here and I think it in my mind I want to
[33:58] just maybe develop it more in just a a
[34:00] sermon in
[34:01] itself but if it's just
[34:04] housing if you're just couch surfing you
[34:06] can always find another
[34:08] couch if just a motel you can always
[34:11] find another one with the different
[34:13] rates if it's just a car you can always
[34:15] move that car around you maybe you could
[34:16] change cars there's a lot of different
[34:18] ways of looking at this but my point
[34:19] would be this if it's just housing you
[34:21] always have the option to
[34:23] change if it's just doubling up you
[34:26] always have the option of moving out
[34:28] whenever things get
[34:30] uncomfortable whenever things get
[34:32] terrible whenever things are are just
[34:33] not the way that you want them to be
[34:35] when things get tough you don't have to
[34:37] bind closer together when things get
[34:40] hard you don't have to work through
[34:43] through things and you don't you don't
[34:45] have to compromise and find a way to
[34:47] keep the harmony keep things together
[34:48] are you following me that if it's just a
[34:51] house you don't have any there's nothing
[34:53] you don't have anything to it and those
[34:55] who are running just a house don't have
[34:58] that sense of community where they're
[35:00] cultivating it it's just well if you
[35:01] don't like it
[35:03] leave right when it's just a house
[35:05] there's no sense of well how can we keep
[35:07] the family together how can we make this
[35:08] work and and how can we see that every
[35:11] everyone's needs are taken care of
[35:13] whether it be the individual whether it
[35:14] be the father the father who just wants
[35:16] to have a house and it's his house it's
[35:18] like it's my way or the highway soon as
[35:20] you don't do things the way I like it
[35:22] around here that's the day you need to
[35:23] leave and you know what that that's a
[35:25] lot of posturing
[35:27] may be true but man if you ever get to
[35:30] that you've kind of lost you've lost
[35:32] things things you've got to that point
[35:35] where brother bam says a pastor can fire
[35:37] the whole board if he wants to and start
[35:41] over
[35:43] right amen if he
[35:46] wants that's the only time I've ever had
[35:48] to say
[35:50] it can you guys say Amen come on where
[35:53] are you let me hear it can the Deacon
[35:55] say right he says he can fire the the
[35:57] whole board deacons trustees and start
[35:59] over he once he goes I hope it never has
[36:01] to come to that right and if the nuclear
[36:04] option is the one you mentioned every
[36:05] time someone just seems to
[36:07] disagree you want me to kick you out the
[36:09] church huh you want me to bring you
[36:10] before the board huh you want me kick
[36:12] you out it's if that's what you always
[36:14] go to you've created a nasty
[36:16] environment right you've created this
[36:18] hostile work environment you've created
[36:20] this housing this doubling up this couch
[36:23] surfing it's just a car it's just a
[36:24] motel it's just a tent it's not really
[36:27] what should be a
[36:28] home because when things get tough It's
[36:31] hit the road you're either told to hit
[36:34] the road or you hit the road yourself
[36:35] and a lot of people have left housing
[36:38] because at the end of the day the right
[36:39] kind of atmosphere was never cultivated
[36:41] within the home or the church to where
[36:43] they felt that they could be heard they
[36:45] could that problems could be addressed
[36:47] or that there was this character of
[36:49] Christ in their midst to where no matter
[36:51] how hurt and wounded or how sinful they
[36:53] had been that they could come to the
[36:55] right place again and receive healing
[37:00] I I hope that that image is you can kind
[37:02] of grasp that idea that when it's just a
[37:04] house there's no loyalty to the house
[37:06] again it's not house sweet house it's
[37:08] not home is where the house is but it's
[37:11] it's a different different
[37:14] connotation so let me say this as I'm
[37:16] trying to wind this sermon down we don't
[37:19] have a housing crisis we have a home
[37:23] crisis brother brandom said the American
[37:26] home today is uncertain
[37:28] that's right and if I could say this I
[37:30] think if for doing an autopsy on
[37:32] it a postmortem or whatever we might
[37:35] call it or hot washing if we were to
[37:37] examine it and look at it the home
[37:40] crisis is what has led to this housing
[37:44] crisis there's there's things aren't
[37:46] happening in the house that used to
[37:49] happen that put people in a position to
[37:51] succeed when they leave the house or
[37:53] provide the resources they would need
[37:55] when life gets difficult we've become
[37:57] completely untethered from what home
[37:59] life used to
[38:01] be and homes should be providing more
[38:04] than just food and shelters Luke 12:23
[38:07] says the life is more than meat and the
[38:09] body is more than rainment some have
[38:11] taken the idea of family or Parenthood
[38:13] to be that I want to provide them with a
[38:15] house I want to provide them with food
[38:17] and clothing I want to make sure they
[38:19] get their education maybe postsecondary
[38:21] education and different things I want to
[38:23] make sure they get all that and then
[38:24] they're on their own and we just let
[38:25] them loose and I've done my job and
[38:27] there's no real cultivating of
[38:29] relationships there's no sense of moral
[38:31] responsibility if anything anymore
[38:33] there's actually talk about we won't
[38:34] even identify their gender till they
[38:36] want to identify it we don't want to
[38:38] impose anything on them until they got
[38:39] to make their decision and Parenthood is
[38:42] getting to the place where it's
[38:42] completely hands off so the concept of
[38:45] traditional Parenthood is completely
[38:47] broken and brother B says you break
[38:49] Parenthood you break the nation and the
[38:51] reason why we have the insanity the
[38:53] reason why and this is me saying this
[38:55] the reason why that we have such a
[38:58] unhoused population and such a crisis
[39:01] when it comes to housing it comes back
[39:03] to
[39:04] character comes back to vision and
[39:08] responsibility where at some point even
[39:10] as Americans we got away from the right
[39:12] kind of ideals where you just didn't
[39:15] have this
[39:16] problem as even reading in this article
[39:18] I think it ends on this note that in in
[39:23] Nashville they kicked out a um a bunch
[39:26] of homeless people from this encampment
[39:29] and then built and then we're going to
[39:30] build new houses there for homeless
[39:33] people to live in and so when it was all
[39:35] said and done they put 191 people in
[39:38] houses and caused another 397 to no
[39:41] longer have a place to live it's like
[39:43] this is a this is something where you
[39:45] can't do something to help somebody
[39:47] without hurting somebody else if you
[39:49] raise their tents if you mow down their
[39:52] uh their their their shelters and you
[39:54] take whatever they their shanties
[39:55] they've set up and just plow them down
[39:57] where are they going to go what are they
[39:58] going to
[39:59] do it it is a crisis and it's not one
[40:03] that we as a church can solve it's not
[40:05] ones that we we're not the policy
[40:07] writers we're not the ones that have to
[40:08] figure it out but we can say this if
[40:11] there's if we look at an in sense of at
[40:13] the end of the day it comes down to this
[40:15] lack of vision and purpose what can I be
[40:17] doing in my own house to maybe even
[40:20] ensure against
[40:22] literal insanity and homelessness
[40:28] I this is I recommend this Ser sermon as
[40:30] being one maybe for you to go and listen
[40:32] to lifting him up out of History it's a
[40:35] lengthy
[40:36] statement I'm going to read through this
[40:38] and then I have um three more quotations
[40:41] to share with you as well of our as well
[40:43] as our text I think we're doing good on
[40:45] time if this quote takes me too long we
[40:48] can just pick up on at a later time and
[40:49] finish these notes but brother bam says
[40:51] and lifting him up out of History we
[40:53] have a home life
[40:55] crisis and I want say not a housing
[40:58] crisis a home life crisis it seems like
[41:02] the home life is running out into
[41:04] shallow
[41:06] water it used to be in a home listen to
[41:09] these things these are the things that
[41:10] make a house a home and provided the
[41:14] kind of nurturing environment that
[41:15] children and families needed in order to
[41:18] keep things together and godly it used
[41:19] to be in a home that a father the head
[41:21] of the house would sit down in the
[41:22] morning and would speak with his family
[41:24] and they would all take out the old
[41:25] Family Bible and read just a little bit
[41:28] and all gather around the table and have
[41:30] prayer you don't see that no
[41:33] more now families may be such to where
[41:36] you don't have the the the father and
[41:38] the son going out to the field and the
[41:40] daughters are all in the home and maybe
[41:41] you don't have the same traditional
[41:43] families and Lifestyles and different
[41:45] times of going to work and those things
[41:47] but the idea is that there was something
[41:50] common they're gathering around that had
[41:52] some spiritual benefit or purpose to it
[41:55] says you don't see that anymore so not
[41:57] just just in the literal application of
[41:59] it being in the morning but in that idea
[42:02] that the family is serving a higher
[42:03] purpose and when the day was done and Ma
[42:06] had the dishes washed they'd all Gather
[42:08] in and read some more of the Bible and
[42:10] pray before going to bed when he says
[42:13] they don't do that anymore he's meaning
[42:15] families don't pray together and they
[42:16] don't read their Bibles together and
[42:18] another thing they do don't do is eat
[42:20] meals
[42:21] together he said juvenile delinquency
[42:23] certainly was hard thing to find in them
[42:26] days when families ate together prayed
[42:28] together read the Bible together the
[42:30] boys all went to the fields to work and
[42:32] the girls helped mom with the washing
[42:33] down at the
[42:34] creek and I mean I guess we're glad that
[42:37] doesn't happen right but but today we
[42:39] just push a little button the dishes are
[42:40] all done and Ma's in the car and gone to
[42:43] the card party or out she's rattling
[42:45] around the streets and the work's done
[42:47] by a tractor so he's saying as we have
[42:50] evolved in our technology and certain
[42:53] jobs have become easier to do and the
[42:55] Father and Son aren't out plowing in
[42:57] field all day close by and the mom and
[42:59] the daughter aren't washing clothes in a
[43:00] creek and cooking meals in the house he
[43:03] says we just don't have nothing but a
[43:04] bunch of lazy idle
[43:14] people this is these are this is the
[43:18] prophet diagnos in the condition of
[43:20] America and home life is broken now as
[43:23] we're trying to use this example of home
[43:25] life for church life and our own
[43:27] individual lives this has specific
[43:28] application to our lives now specific to
[43:31] our family lives but there's also this
[43:33] parallel in
[43:35] churches right when you could just push
[43:36] a
[43:39] button home life is so neglected till
[43:41] the Bible is laid back till they have to
[43:43] hunt for an hour to find one in many
[43:45] homes in America this is a true story I
[43:47] was in a pastor's
[43:49] home who was telling me there's a lot of
[43:51] things that scriptures that haven't been
[43:53] fulfilled that we should be looking to
[43:54] be fulfilled and this is a pastor's home
[43:56] and and and I was just likeoh like what
[43:59] I'd love to hear it he's like well
[44:00] brother Aaron I can't find a Bible in
[44:02] I'm like I'm in your house can't find a
[44:04] Bible Well little did I know he was
[44:05] trying to build a case to leave the
[44:06] message he says they go to church on
[44:08] Sunday and how convenient it was he
[44:10] couldn't find a Bible for me he says
[44:12] they go to church on Sunday morning for
[44:13] the religion for about 20 minutes since
[44:16] the pastor takes about 30 minutes he's
[44:18] called on the board what is it home life
[44:20] is running out notice the connection
[44:22] he's now making home life is running out
[44:25] so Church Life is running out it used to
[44:27] be that father and mother loved and
[44:28] honored and cherished one another now
[44:31] this is where we're coming to the ideas
[44:33] of home we read home sweet home and uh
[44:36] the the home of the heart and these
[44:37] different poems that I read in the
[44:38] beginning it wasn't just so that I could
[44:40] scratch my poetry itch it was read so
[44:43] that we could see that the caress of a
[44:45] sister the welcoming of a mother the
[44:46] father's care and all these things have
[44:49] something to do with what home what
[44:50] makes a house a home and when we begin
[44:53] to lose those kind of relationships and
[44:55] connections father to son and daughter
[44:57] mother to children father husband and
[44:59] wife together then a family though they
[45:01] may be housed together ohow they may
[45:05] just as well be in a homeless
[45:07] shelter they may just as well be
[45:09] doubling up with each
[45:12] other couch surfing in your own house
[45:15] because it used to be that father and
[45:16] mother loved and honored and cherished
[45:18] one another and when she was old and
[45:19] gray and wrinkled up and her poor little
[45:21] old face was all Dro up in her glasses
[45:22] hanging down over her nose pop loved her
[45:25] just as well as he did when she was
[45:27] young and pretty this is really
[45:29] interesting but today I don't mean to be
[45:30] critical when she gets a little old he
[45:32] just swaps her for a new model seems to
[45:35] be that way like swapping cars or
[45:37] something so he says seems like that
[45:39] real family love doesn't exist much more
[45:43] just Something's Happened home life is
[45:45] running out he keeps saying it home life
[45:47] is running out home life is running out
[45:49] home life is running out he'll say it
[45:51] again we don't have the old American
[45:53] home as we used to have it long years
[45:54] ago uh maybe Sunday I'll get into some
[45:57] of the specifics of how home life has
[45:59] changed and and just how that's
[46:01] transpired maybe as a way to help us he
[46:03] said there's another thing I'd like to
[46:04] say another thing is running out is
[46:06] friendship is running out thought it was
[46:08] remarkable that even brother Lucas in
[46:10] his prayer talked about being better
[46:11] fathers and friends and and these things
[46:13] friendship is running out running out it
[46:15] doesn't seem like we have the friends
[46:16] that we used to have and the friends
[46:18] that we have are not loyal friends like
[46:20] they used to be that reminds me of the
[46:23] prayer request I forgot to write down
[46:25] brother loyal is preaching back back in
[46:28] his hometown of Minnesota where he grew
[46:30] up uh where he used to live I don't know
[46:32] if it's home or what it is but he still
[46:33] conss himself to be living here he's
[46:35] just unhoused if you guys didn't know
[46:37] that he lost his apartment was moving
[46:39] Apartments I hope it's okay to say this
[46:41] and one lease was expiring and he had
[46:43] signed a lease on a new place and two
[46:44] weeks before he was to move into his new
[46:46] place the apartment called him and said
[46:47] ah we're canceling the lease because he
[46:48] had too good of a deal so he became
[46:51] unhoused and so being unhoused he was
[46:53] like you know what my I know where my
[46:54] heart is I know where home is just
[46:56] because I don't have a house doesn't
[46:57] mean I don't have a home and he got a
[46:58] new job cuz his job offered him
[47:00] Severance and he got a new job and he's
[47:01] been traveling a lot more and he took it
[47:03] as an opportunity to go back and visit
[47:04] family and do a little bit of traveling
[47:06] and when we talked about I said just be
[47:07] sure you know you're in the will of the
[47:08] Lord just make sure I don't have I can't
[47:10] give you an opinion on it you're a young
[47:12] man this is an opportunity you need to
[47:13] find whether not the will of the Lord
[47:14] and so he's been do traveling a lot with
[47:16] work and he was going to be home this
[47:17] week but he was asked to minister so
[47:19] let's pray for him because loyal is
[47:20] ministering he's a loyal
[47:22] friend and he'll be ministering this
[47:24] Sunday so that was my other prayer
[47:26] request it made it into the middle of
[47:27] the sermon friends that we have are not
[47:29] loyal friends like they used to be they
[47:31] just leave town for months at a
[47:34] time but when you think about what makes
[47:36] friends is all we have to do is friend
[47:38] request somebody and if they accept it
[47:41] oh we're friends wow follow me back
[47:44] right and that's how we're connected I
[47:47] get these emails from LinkedIn do you
[47:48] want to connect with and read those
[47:50] because this is an unprovoked prompt
[47:53] right you haven't expressed any interest
[47:56] in Lucas Rubik as a developer but yet
[47:58] they're asking whether or not you want
[48:00] to connect with him on LinkedIn you're
[48:01] like oh did he did he seek me out no
[48:03] they're just trying to get you to
[48:04] connect with
[48:05] somebody and so things are so
[48:08] superficial the friendships that we have
[48:11] it used to be I can remember when
[48:12] someone got sick in the neighborhood
[48:14] that everybody come around and they
[48:15] helped them with all their work and
[48:16] lended a hand to anything could be done
[48:18] set them up with all night set up with
[48:20] them all night at times and I've often
[48:22] said it's the truth that we can hardly
[48:24] know the neighbors dead until we see it
[48:25] in the paper he says
[48:28] friendship you following how much things
[48:31] have changed and we may have neighbors
[48:34] but it's not what a neighbor used to be
[48:36] we might have neighborhoods but it's not
[48:37] like used to be we might have houses but
[48:39] they're not homes Papa has a key to the
[48:42] house and mama has a key and they're
[48:43] both out and gone half the night the
[48:44] children they don't know where they are
[48:46] and the little ones are with the
[48:47] babysitter and that's the way life is
[48:50] lived you have to recognize how he's
[48:52] talking about families pulled apart into
[48:55] their own different directions they have
[48:57] their own Visions their own goals the
[48:58] own thing own things that they like to
[49:00] do do you know the Bible predicted all
[49:02] these things so what is it then it's
[49:04] that we're standing in a position
[49:06] watching these things run out he said
[49:08] let's take Church life this is where it
[49:10] all begins Church Life is running out
[49:12] the people just take the church today
[49:14] almost for an idol like a totem pole go
[49:17] set in church five minutes and I've done
[49:19] my religion pay your little contribution
[49:20] whatever it is to pay the pastor and
[49:22] they don't make that up if they don't
[49:23] make that up they make a little supper
[49:25] and make it up to the pastor and if he
[49:27] ain't satisfied he hauls off to
[49:29] somewhere that'll get him a better wage
[49:31] no
[49:32] commitment listen when you're just
[49:34] housed there's no responsibility if
[49:36] things go sideways you just leave when
[49:38] you're just when you're just uh just
[49:41] housed or couch surfing there's no
[49:44] accountability and here it's just this
[49:46] Dynamic to see the pastor is not
[49:47] divinely called anymore just seems like
[49:49] he begins to be a mil ticket to the
[49:51] pastor that the people wherever offers
[49:52] him the most money there he goes it
[49:54] shouldn't be that way it shouldn't be
[49:56] that a man was called of God to a
[49:58] community now we have defined that to
[50:01] mean that if God calls a man to a state
[50:03] he's the pastor of the whole state or
[50:05] the city but Community speaks of a
[50:07] different type of
[50:08] relationship than just proximity or just
[50:11] a zip code or you know the pastor of
[50:13] Maricopa or Phoenix but he calls a man
[50:16] of God to a community to cultivate the
[50:18] sense of community to have a
[50:20] responsibility to that community and
[50:21] oversight over him and not just be like
[50:23] oh I don't like this Arrangement and
[50:24] just leave and if he had to lay there
[50:27] like Elijah did on top of a mountain at
[50:28] the brook cherith and expect the crows
[50:30] to feed him he ought to stay in his
[50:32] Divine calling till his Divine mission
[50:34] is fulfilled no matter if he gets a
[50:36] penny or not it should be the call of
[50:38] God
[50:39] first but it seemingly it's changed to
[50:41] the call of money or bigger position
[50:43] something on that
[50:44] order think of that just in home life
[50:47] how much how quickly we abandoned we
[50:50] abandoned places for a better job better
[50:53] position he said something on that order
[50:55] or to become a more popular person in a
[50:57] bigger church or something like that and
[50:59] then the church they have let down they
[51:01] begin to run out he said just watch it
[51:05] unfold there's a lot in that I had to go
[51:08] through it maybe quick more quickly than
[51:09] I had anticipated but as he de details
[51:12] home Life Church
[51:15] Life and in these sermons of Uncertain
[51:18] sound and and even this lifting them up
[51:20] out of History goes through this quite a
[51:22] bit on how there's home life is
[51:23] uncertain Church Life is uncertain
[51:25] National Life is uncertain life itself
[51:27] is uncertain politics is uncertain and
[51:29] he goes through that he's talking about
[51:31] how relationships are different now the
[51:34] relationships of mother husband and wife
[51:37] are different then the relationship of
[51:39] the father and mother to Children is
[51:41] different and there's a lot of
[51:43] independency and what they say and what
[51:45] they do and what their responsibilities
[51:47] are and he even describes in church life
[51:49] where there's no accountability and
[51:50] people just leave and come and go and do
[51:51] whatever they want he saying these these
[51:54] are things running out why because we
[51:56] have a home life crisis not a housing
[51:58] crisis in the message in uncertain sound
[52:01] he says home life is uncertain we've
[52:03] never had a time when we had so many
[52:04] divorces in peace time as we got now
[52:07] what's remarkable is to find that the
[52:09] number of divorces is either has leveled
[52:11] off or even is getting smaller but what
[52:13] we find is more people are just
[52:14] cohabitating and not marrying so
[52:17] sometimes when you dig into the data
[52:18] it's not it's not a a Rosy scenario it's
[52:21] that this idea of home is completely
[52:24] broken home life is uncertain our home
[52:27] life is broke up years ago it used to be
[52:29] that mother and dad were at home at
[52:30] night if it wasn't for church or
[52:32] something and they never let their
[52:34] children roll in the streets and run
[52:35] around all night
[52:37] long or the worldwide web or the
[52:41] internet Highway you know just there's a
[52:43] way that we could be roaming and it it
[52:45] can be virtual right just put the
[52:47] virtual headset we're on the we're and
[52:49] so he says and now days it seems to be
[52:51] kind of a popular opinion oh how you
[52:54] just go to the modern house today look
[52:56] at what it is Papa he has to hurry down
[52:59] to the pool room the boys are playing
[53:01] pool or they're bowling or something him
[53:02] and Ma sisters at the Canen I just love
[53:05] every we using phrases the kids are like
[53:07] Mom what's a canteen what's bowling
[53:09] what's the pool room is that an indoor
[53:11] pool that's what
[53:13] we and so there's a Junior's got a hot
[53:18] rod uh sister's had a canteen or some
[53:20] rock and roll party Junior's got the hot
[53:22] rod out seeing how he can run run down
[53:24] and that's about home life now just put
[53:26] in here now all the different things
[53:29] that we do in our afternoons or evenings
[53:31] or even on our Saturdays our daily lives
[53:33] where everyone's off doing their own
[53:36] thing it's not a home anymore it's a
[53:40] house that's what he's identifying even
[53:43] if we're not running off in the pool
[53:44] room H H as as men or out bowling as
[53:47] boys or at the canteen as girls or got a
[53:51] hot rod or these things it's something
[53:52] about the home life is missing we're not
[53:55] together anymore our relationships are
[53:58] aren't as strong and connected as they
[53:59] used to be he said and the Bible oh it's
[54:02] a great book but it's put in the drawer
[54:04] somewhere until the pastor comes
[54:07] in and we just don't have the home life
[54:10] we used to have home life is so
[54:16] uncertain this is statement after
[54:19] statement after statement I could share
[54:21] with you actually was going through a
[54:22] number of them today and just kind of
[54:24] piecing them out uh just so that it
[54:26] wasn't just being overloaded and you'll
[54:28] find sometimes a brother R is
[54:29] emphasizing a little bit different angle
[54:31] and so there's some other principles I'd
[54:32] like to explore in this subject so
[54:35] there's going to be more statements
[54:36] we'll share with you we talking about we
[54:38] we have a crisis in the home and home
[54:40] life crisis and in each one of these
[54:43] scenarios I would describe it this way
[54:45] because there's no home life it's
[54:47] homeless they're housed but homeless
[54:51] whether it be the home he described or
[54:52] the church he described they're housed
[54:55] but homeless
[54:57] and it's a
[54:58] crisis a crisis in which he describes
[55:00] the loss of love the loss of support the
[55:02] loss of togetherness there's that loss
[55:05] of support of for one another even in a
[55:07] community there's this not looking out
[55:09] after one another there's a there's just
[55:11] so many different ideas brother Bram
[55:13] talks about Dr Spock and he talks about
[55:15] all these ideas that just flood people's
[55:17] minds and a lot of psychology and how to
[55:19] raise families and how to how to conduct
[55:21] ourselves and we've gotten away from the
[55:23] real principles of the word of God and
[55:25] responsibilities and accountabil to one
[55:26] another and he's saying the home is gone
[55:30] and because the home is gone the house
[55:32] is no longer the shelter that it should
[55:34] have be yeah it's a roof over the head
[55:37] but where's the Comfort where's the
[55:38] belonging now it's become a jail now
[55:40] there's tension now there's H there it's
[55:43] it lacks all the things that home should
[55:46] have and it gets to where now home's not
[55:48] even a place worth fighting for because
[55:50] after all it's just a house and you can
[55:52] always get one of those you can always
[55:53] move out you can always separate you can
[55:56] always change churches it's not a place
[55:58] worth fighting
[55:59] for and I I I want to close with this
[56:03] and and and this is what I'm going to
[56:05] say until I
[56:07] close we can pray for and believe that
[56:11] God will heal these
[56:12] things that if you have a house but not
[56:15] a home we can pray for God to heal it
[56:17] because homelessness is the result of
[56:19] some conditions uh maybe uh some some
[56:22] sickness some breach some harm H and
[56:25] something's lacking to where you don't
[56:26] have home and so as I look out on the
[56:28] congregation I would say that all of us
[56:30] except for maybe loyal we have a house
[56:32] we have a place that we live we have a
[56:34] place that we have can have on our
[56:35] driver's license that's the per that's
[56:37] our permanent place of residence but if
[56:39] we we have if we don't have that I
[56:41] believe God can provide it 100% I have
[56:44] no doubt that God can provide shelter
[56:46] for those who don't have it but let me
[56:47] say this if your living situation your
[56:50] house whether it be your church or
[56:52] whether it be the place that you live as
[56:54] together as a family or even if it's by
[56:56] yourself if it doesn't feel like home
[56:59] whatever has taken home away from it God
[57:02] can heal
[57:04] it brother brandham is in prayer and
[57:06] he's praying at the end of a sermon I
[57:08] just thought it was so beautiful he said
[57:09] if it's domestic trouble straighten up
[57:11] the home Lord Give
[57:13] Peace where there's trouble there's a
[57:15] loss of peace and comfort and stability
[57:17] where there's trouble we can't say that
[57:19] we live in a Peaceable habitation and
[57:21] ass sure dwelling or a quiet resting
[57:22] place where there's trouble we can pray
[57:25] for God to straighten up the home and
[57:27] give peace
[57:29] Amen in 2 Chronicles 5: 13 and
[57:33] 14 there an hour ago that we had read
[57:36] this so if the kind of the the language
[57:38] has been lost in this just notice how
[57:40] beautifully this fits it came to pass as
[57:43] the trumpeters and singers were as one
[57:46] trumpeters don't use their voice they
[57:48] use their breath they use an instrument
[57:50] the singer is vocalizing hears two
[57:52] different offices two different callings
[57:53] two different sounds but somehow some
[57:55] way they come
[57:56] one to make one
[57:59] sound and to not make one sound in
[58:02] praising and thanking God for an
[58:03] excellent draft pick by the Arizona
[58:05] Cardinals but they come to one sound to
[58:07] be heard in praising and thanking the
[58:09] lord and when they lifted up their voice
[58:12] with the trumpets and symbols and
[58:13] instruments of music so now it's not
[58:16] just the trumpets and the singers but
[58:18] it's all instruments and all symbols and
[58:20] all these together now though they have
[58:22] different callings and different offices
[58:23] and different gifts and different
[58:24] talents they're working together
[58:26] supporting one another making beautiful
[58:28] music as one as one
[58:31] voice and praise the Lord and they say
[58:34] the same thing for he is good for his
[58:36] mercy endureth
[58:38] forever and as this Oneness had come
[58:40] into this Gathering of the trumpeters
[58:41] and singers and all instruments of music
[58:43] and symbols and all the voices come
[58:46] together with the same praise and
[58:47] thanking the lord and the same thing
[58:48] he's good and his mercy endureth forever
[58:51] that then the house was filled with the
[58:52] cloud even the house of the Lord so that
[58:55] the priest could not stand to minister
[58:56] by reason of the cloud for the glory of
[58:58] the Lord had filled the house of God and
[59:02] it's then that God made it
[59:05] home when it was in its place when there
[59:07] was Unity when he was being lifted up
[59:10] when they are of the same mind in the
[59:12] same objective even though they have
[59:13] different callings and different jobs
[59:15] and different roles as I've said before
[59:18] uh uh you know our wives don't have the
[59:21] same jobs that we do as husbands and
[59:22] husbands don't have the same jobs as our
[59:24] wives and thank God
[59:27] right just leave it at that there's no
[59:30] need to say well you don't do what I do
[59:33] good thing
[59:35] right and it's good that you're not
[59:37] doing their job so we realized through
[59:39] all the differences and different
[59:40] desires that when family life is broke
[59:42] up in Harmony and Oneness and common
[59:45] objective and goals get broke up that's
[59:47] when we provide a basis for disharmony
[59:51] disunity that's it goes back to A House
[59:54] Divided but this describes such a
[59:56] beautiful scenery in the house of the
[59:59] Lord that that's when God came he's like
[1:00:01] now that's where I
[1:00:02] dwell and that's what makes it
[1:00:05] home that's what made the structure of
[1:00:08] the temple remember how we talked about
[1:00:10] when the the tent walls were erected and
[1:00:12] as soon as that last piece came into
[1:00:14] place the presence of God came now here
[1:00:16] in the temple there's this point where
[1:00:18] all are lifting up things together and
[1:00:20] the presence of the Lord comes it speaks
[1:00:23] to this this concept and this idea that
[1:00:26] we can uh we can refer to in the world
[1:00:29] as home having a home and home sweet
[1:00:33] home and oh there's no place like home
[1:00:35] oh there's no place like home well this
[1:00:38] is this spiritual sense We should strive
[1:00:40] for this feeling in our
[1:00:45] houses I guess I'm realizing now that
[1:00:47] maybe it's a different set of notes
[1:00:48] where I have some statements uh that I
[1:00:51] thought maybe we had this evening maybe
[1:00:52] it's for
[1:00:54] Sunday I'm I'm just doing my best as a
[1:00:57] Christian and as a pastor to apply
[1:00:58] myself to the word of God for your
[1:01:00] benefit and so your feedback your
[1:01:02] testimony your prayers your testimony
[1:01:04] it's all it's all encouraging me to know
[1:01:07] whether or not we're meeting your needs
[1:01:08] because that's what's most important
[1:01:10] this I I'll say this I am not a
[1:01:12] professor and you're my students and so
[1:01:14] I have a curriculum and you need to
[1:01:16] learn it and make a good grade it's the
[1:01:18] opposite function where you're the ones
[1:01:22] that uh uh have something God wants to
[1:01:24] say to you and I just want to be his
[1:01:26] mouthpiece and so you're going to get
[1:01:28] what you need not what I want you to
[1:01:29] learn by God's grace so hold me
[1:01:31] accountable to that but do your part in
[1:01:33] prayer and
[1:01:34] communication so here here's a statement
[1:01:36] I think I might have this one Jehovah
[1:01:38] JRA do I have that one brother John
[1:01:40] let's follow this I want to close with
[1:01:41] two more statements but as I've said
[1:01:43] that though we could be housed but
[1:01:46] homeless whatever has made us homeless
[1:01:49] God can heal
[1:01:50] it and brother brandom and and I want to
[1:01:52] bring this back to that uh these
[1:01:54] comments that we were making
[1:01:56] in bringing how that children were
[1:01:58] behaving poorly and they seemed
[1:01:59] depressed and tense and Ang uh anxious
[1:02:02] and those things brother Braham said
[1:02:03] here's another thing and he's in
[1:02:05] discernment and I wanted to use this
[1:02:06] other part before that was real powerful
[1:02:09] he goes remember your life couldn't hide
[1:02:11] now you're having trouble at home a
[1:02:14] domestic trouble that's right it's your
[1:02:17] husband and you're praying for him
[1:02:20] because he's
[1:02:21] unsaved and then he says sir I would be
[1:02:24] saved and give my heart to Christ Jesus
[1:02:27] so it it it it reads as and it sounds as
[1:02:30] if the husband could be there and here's
[1:02:34] this woman who has trouble at home
[1:02:35] domestic trouble the husband's not saved
[1:02:37] and now notice how remarkable this
[1:02:39] statement is I would be saved to give my
[1:02:42] heart to Christ Jesus so these children
[1:02:44] could be
[1:02:46] well straighten up your home and make it
[1:02:48] right that tension will always be at the
[1:02:52] children that's just so moving
[1:02:56] that where husband and wife are not in
[1:02:58] harmony the children no matter how much
[1:03:00] you can fake it the children will fill
[1:03:02] it why because you have a house form not
[1:03:05] a home it's a broken home we even use
[1:03:08] the phrase oh they come from a broken
[1:03:09] home they are raised in a broken home
[1:03:11] and a lot of times we use it to describe
[1:03:13] children who are raised in single parent
[1:03:16] households why because what home should
[1:03:18] be's been
[1:03:20] broken he says you should get your heart
[1:03:22] right so these children can be well
[1:03:24] straighten up your home and make it
[1:03:25] right the tension will always be at the
[1:03:28] children and I say this I express this
[1:03:31] to the families who are streaming at
[1:03:32] home I express this to those of us who
[1:03:34] are here and this great burden that we
[1:03:36] have for those all of us together as a
[1:03:38] family and as we're raising children
[1:03:39] this lay to Sea and darkness that we
[1:03:42] have got to be providing the right kind
[1:03:43] of atmosphere at home we must have a
[1:03:45] vision for our families we've got to be
[1:03:47] intentional we've got to be deliberate
[1:03:49] with the way that we're living because
[1:03:51] the tension in the father in the mother
[1:03:54] in the home will rob a child of the home
[1:03:57] life and the tension will always be at
[1:04:00] the
[1:04:01] children and then notice this next
[1:04:03] phrase do you believe that if I pray for
[1:04:05] the children you can accept the healing
[1:04:09] of the
[1:04:10] children that
[1:04:12] powerful do you believe that if I can
[1:04:15] pray for the children you can accept the
[1:04:18] healing of the children that that that
[1:04:21] speaks to me it gives me confidence to
[1:04:23] believe that if the the the atmosphere
[1:04:26] that the house hasn't been right and the
[1:04:27] children have been damaged and harmed by
[1:04:29] it that we can pray and God can heal
[1:04:32] it because he says and I'll pray that
[1:04:34] your husband this night will become
[1:04:35] God's servant so that your troubles will
[1:04:37] be
[1:04:38] ended I believe that no matter what our
[1:04:40] home lives have been like to this point
[1:04:42] no matter what our church experiences
[1:04:44] have been like even if it's failures and
[1:04:45] shortcomings in this church here I
[1:04:48] believe that God could
[1:04:49] heal right now the Sheep God can mend
[1:04:54] God can make better God can make
[1:04:56] God could cause us as as whether it be
[1:04:58] Pastor as husbands and and fathers to
[1:05:00] come greater to our position come closer
[1:05:02] to our calling be more serious about the
[1:05:05] things that God has called us to be a
[1:05:07] and accept that our failures have caused
[1:05:09] the tensions in the children and pray
[1:05:12] that God would heal our
[1:05:16] children could we just bow our heads in
[1:05:18] a word of prayer as you remain seated
[1:05:20] maybe just to think about these things
[1:05:32] brother brandom in another sermon the
[1:05:33] seven compound names of
[1:05:36] Jehovah he says heart trouble nothing's
[1:05:39] hard for God is it he's just doing
[1:05:41] discernment one after another he just
[1:05:43] heals all kinds of
[1:05:46] diseases he says God bless you just go
[1:05:48] on your road rejoicing being happy he
[1:05:51] said you have the same thing so just
[1:05:53] keep going God's made you well and he
[1:05:56] will make every person well in this
[1:05:57] building right now if you'll believe it
[1:05:59] will you believe
[1:06:04] it and he says this he tells him to
[1:06:07] stand to your feet just a minute he says
[1:06:08] God is our refuge and strength very
[1:06:11] present help in the time of
[1:06:13] trouble brother Ram talks about trouble
[1:06:16] at home domestic trouble uses that
[1:06:20] phrase often or a few times at
[1:06:23] least and he said God is our refuge and
[1:06:26] strength the very present help in the
[1:06:28] time of trouble and he says the crisis
[1:06:30] is
[1:06:32] on let me say the home life crisis is
[1:06:36] on he said the battle is
[1:06:40] on would you agree with me even our
[1:06:43] young couples I look at some I think
[1:06:45] about some of the young newly married
[1:06:46] couples they know the battle is on they
[1:06:48] know there's a a battle for home life
[1:06:50] there's a battle for PR uh preeminence
[1:06:53] there's a battle for the right things
[1:06:54] the crisis is on it's not a housing
[1:06:56] crisis it's a home crisis he says the
[1:06:59] crisis is on the battle is on he says
[1:07:01] raise up your hands and touch the
[1:07:03] lifeline now and move home with
[1:07:06] it
[1:07:07] Hallelujah in Jesus Christ's name may
[1:07:10] you receive it that's what I express to
[1:07:13] you tonight if you could even in your
[1:07:15] own Hearts Reach Out touch the lifeline
[1:07:18] get a hold of God he says move home with
[1:07:22] it oh Hallelujah if I could say it this
[1:07:25] way way you don't have to change your
[1:07:27] address you don't have to pack up a
[1:07:29] Pinsky you don't have to go across the
[1:07:31] country but you can say tonight I'm
[1:07:33] moving back home I'm going back home I'm
[1:07:37] going to move home tonight I'm going to
[1:07:39] take a hold of the word of God in the
[1:07:41] presence of Christ and I'm going to move
[1:07:42] home with it I'm going back to the same
[1:07:45] old house I'm going back to the same old
[1:07:47] apartment I'm get going back to the same
[1:07:48] old condo I'm going back to the same old
[1:07:51] hotel but now I'm going
[1:07:54] home cuz I'm going with a purpose in my
[1:07:56] heart to live
[1:07:58] differently to give Christ the
[1:08:00] preeminence to gather around the right
[1:08:03] things because the uncertainty and the
[1:08:05] Brokenness that crept into the home was
[1:08:08] de directly reflective of Christ being
[1:08:12] pushed
[1:08:14] out and as families differed over Sports
[1:08:17] and politics and food and education and
[1:08:22] fashion and all sorts of things they
[1:08:24] lost commonality with one another and
[1:08:26] they no longer fellowshipped as friends
[1:08:28] and there was not the togetherness in a
[1:08:30] family and Things become
[1:08:33] toxic and all the the numbers of adult
[1:08:36] children arranged from their parents is
[1:08:38] so staggering it's become a subject of a
[1:08:41] lot of study as of late for many
[1:08:44] academics and psychologists and
[1:08:46] sociologists and they find that it was
[1:08:49] those parents provided a house they
[1:08:51] provided cars they provided education
[1:08:53] they provided a lot but the most
[1:08:56] important part of the relationship was
[1:08:58] missing the most important part that
[1:09:00] being a real relationship not
[1:09:03] just being
[1:09:08] [Music]
[1:09:10] related I do think there's a lot of
[1:09:12] people not here I think we just have
[1:09:14] such a wonderful group but I do
[1:09:15] acknowledge that even as beautiful as I
[1:09:18] believe this church is if someone
[1:09:19] doesn't belong here you're your couch
[1:09:24] surfing I still believe it would be our
[1:09:26] responsibility to love you to take care
[1:09:28] of you to provide everything that you
[1:09:29] would have need of but pray most
[1:09:30] importantly that God would not keep you
[1:09:34] homeless but there's a lot of people who
[1:09:37] find themselves just merely
[1:09:41] housed and I would want each one of us
[1:09:43] to be such a a radiant example of God's
[1:09:48] love that you become a water tower to
[1:09:52] those who don't know where home is
[1:09:55] that you could be something that's
[1:09:57] lifted up and they find their way back
[1:10:00] home to the waiting arms of a
[1:10:02] father to a place of
[1:10:05] belonging and if we want to be honest
[1:10:08] with ourselves tonight and say that yes
[1:10:10] I've paid the
[1:10:11] mortgage I've cooked the meals I've done
[1:10:13] all these things as parents but I'm not
[1:10:16] doing a good job of providing a home for
[1:10:19] my spouse or for my children let's just
[1:10:22] pray
[1:10:23] tonight that God would
[1:10:26] heal our children our
[1:10:29] spouses and let's touch the lifeline and
[1:10:32] move home with
[1:10:34] it stand to your feet if you'd like
[1:10:36] prayer
