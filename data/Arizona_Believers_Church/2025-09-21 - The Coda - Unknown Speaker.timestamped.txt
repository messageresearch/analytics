[0:00] 1 Corinthians chapter 15
[0:03] 12-28. Now if Christ be preached that he
[0:05] rose from the dead, how say some among
[0:08] you that there is no resurrection of the
[0:10] dead? That's correcting doctrine there.
[0:13] But if there be no resurrection of the
[0:15] dead, then is Christ not risen? And if
[0:18] Christ be not risen, that is our
[0:19] preaching then is our preaching vain.
[0:22] And your faith is also vain. I think
[0:24] that's very key there. Yay. And we are
[0:26] found false witnesses of God because
[0:28] we've testified of God that he raised up
[0:30] Christ who he raised not up. If so be
[0:32] that the dead rise not. For if the dead
[0:35] rise not, then is not Christ raised. And
[0:37] if Christ be not raised, your faith is
[0:38] vain. Ye are yet in your sins.
[0:43] Then they also which have fallen asleep
[0:45] in Christ or perished. If in this life
[0:48] we have o hope in Christ, if in this
[0:51] life only we have hope in Christ, we are
[0:53] of all men most miserable. But now as
[0:55] Christ risen from the dead, and become
[0:57] the first fruits of them that slept. For
[0:59] since by man came death, by man came
[1:01] also the resurrection of the dead. For
[1:04] as in Adam all die, even so in Christ
[1:06] shall all be made alive. But every man
[1:08] in his own order, Christ the first
[1:10] fruits, afterward they that are Christ
[1:12] at his coming.
[1:14] Then cometh the end, when he shall have
[1:17] delivered up the kingdom to God, even
[1:18] the Father, when he shall have put all
[1:20] put down all rule and all authority and
[1:22] power. For he must reign till he hath
[1:24] put all enemies under his feet. The last
[1:27] enemy that shall be destroyed is death.
[1:29] For he hath put all things under his
[1:31] feet. But when he saith all these things
[1:34] are put under him, it is manifest that
[1:36] he is expected, which did put all things
[1:38] under him. And when all things shall be
[1:40] subdued unto him, then shall the son
[1:42] also himself be subject unto him that
[1:44] put all things unto him, that God may be
[1:47] all in all.
[1:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. We desire God just really make
[1:52] this alive to us this morning. You can
[1:54] be seated.
[1:56] I hope the title doesn't catch you off
[1:58] guard, but the title is the kod. On
[2:01] Wednesday night, we ministered on the
[2:02] prelude. And speaking on the prelude, we
[2:04] were using it in a m musical sense and
[2:06] how that it's a piece. The prelude is a
[2:09] part of a musical piece uh that is the
[2:11] introduction sets the tone. It kind of
[2:14] foreshadows and it's a real critical
[2:15] part of a musical composition and how
[2:18] that God has used the prelude even in
[2:21] sending the word to his prophets or
[2:23] using these uh ways of of introducing or
[2:26] foreshadowing and we used it even how
[2:29] that the prelude establishes the key and
[2:33] John the Baptist was the prelude to
[2:34] Christ and even in future revealings of
[2:36] Christ there is the prelude even in
[2:39] Malachi 4 there's a prelude for uh the
[2:41] comingings of Elijah
[2:43] and so or with the coming of Elijah and
[2:46] so the kota within a musical piece it is
[2:49] that passage that brings it to an end.
[2:52] So the kota is the end that part of the
[2:55] musical piece that finishes or ends the
[2:59] uh uh that composition and it could be a
[3:02] very simple the kota could be very
[3:04] simple could just be a few measures or
[3:06] it can be an entire section in itself
[3:08] but the kota is the end. We had the
[3:10] prelude, the beginning. Now we're
[3:12] looking at the end. And and we're kind
[3:14] of using it in this sense of the art of
[3:16] music. And the kod is actually necessary
[3:20] in the climax after building the
[3:22] momentum from the prelude of the piece
[3:24] itself to let it all accumulate. This is
[3:28] what a visionary does when they compose
[3:29] a piece. they it's been something that's
[3:31] seen as not just something optional but
[3:33] almost as critically necessary so that
[3:36] everything kind of accumulates up to
[3:38] this climactic finish and when it ends
[3:40] it creates some sense of balance because
[3:42] it's looking back it's gathering
[3:44] everything together and it kind of sums
[3:46] it all up and you're left feeling this
[3:48] sense of resolution and that's what
[3:50] happens when a song begins and you
[3:53] establish that consonant key through the
[3:55] prelude when it ends and maybe there's
[3:57] dissonance and there's a bridge and
[3:58] there's different places and the way
[4:00] that the melody and the composition
[4:02] unfold, but then the ending on the
[4:03] consonant is stable. It's restful.
[4:08] Whereas dissonant endings, that's what
[4:10] has that tension, that unresolved
[4:12] conflict. I'm sure some of you have
[4:14] heard it before where a song ends and it
[4:16] ends on a note that just seems like it
[4:18] hasn't ended, leaves you wanting more.
[4:21] and and actually there's times when that
[4:23] happens where it actually gives a little
[4:24] bit of a hook in you because you're
[4:26] you're you're restless wanting to find
[4:28] that conssonance and so the kota is that
[4:32] climax that highest point uh to or that
[4:35] finishing climax of the piece and I
[4:39] believe that as God composed the
[4:41] masterpiece and has conducted it down
[4:43] through the ages with the prelude and
[4:44] now the unfolding of ages the Holy
[4:46] Spirit is leading to that climactic
[4:48] finish that great ending
[4:50] the kota to God's masterpiece. And it's
[4:54] with the end in mind that I I want to
[4:56] focus today on these things because as
[4:59] Paul is writing, he says that if there's
[5:02] not a resurrection of the dead, then our
[5:04] faith is in vain. And that if we only
[5:07] have hope in this life, we can have
[5:09] faith. But he's saying that we of all
[5:11] people are most miserable. And the
[5:13] reason why is because our faith is not
[5:15] just based upon living a good life and
[5:18] and making an impact in this life, but
[5:20] it's connected to something beyond this
[5:22] life. We have faith in a Jesus Christ
[5:25] who died and rose again.
[5:27] &gt;&gt; So then if that faith has been rendered
[5:29] half because we believe Christ has died
[5:32] but in fact he did not raise again and
[5:34] there is no resurrection, we of all
[5:35] people are most miserable.
[5:38] So we we're thinking about and
[5:40] contemplating the finishing the kota in
[5:43] Matthew 24:6 he says and you shall hear
[5:46] of wars and rumors of wars see that you
[5:49] be not troubled for all these things
[5:50] must come to pass but the end is not
[5:53] yet. So he said there's a lot of things
[5:55] that are going to happen a lot of
[5:57] intervening intervals and interludes and
[5:59] bridges and a lot of different uh
[6:01] choruses and verses a lot of things
[6:03] happening but as these things happen
[6:05] just know the end is not yet. He says in
[6:07] verse 14, "And this gospel of the
[6:09] kingdom shall be preached in all the
[6:11] world for a witness unto all nations and
[6:14] then shall the end come." So Jesus is
[6:18] saying that there is a work to be done
[6:21] that in Christ who has come, died,
[6:24] buried, risen, ascended, has now sent
[6:27] back his holy spirit, given gifts to
[6:29] men, whereby the gospel, even through
[6:31] you can be preached unto all nations.
[6:33] and that there's a filling up and then
[6:35] there's a finishing point.
[6:37] &gt;&gt; There is a point where this ends. The
[6:40] Bible even speaks that if the days are
[6:42] not shortened, there'll be no flesh
[6:43] saved. That there's there's an end point
[6:45] to this. There's even an end in mind
[6:48] when God says uh to Adam and the woman
[6:51] to multiply and replenish the earth.
[6:54] That there's the sense of filling it up
[6:56] to its end point.
[6:58] In Philippians 1:6, he says this in
[7:02] admonishing the believers, being
[7:03] confident of this very thing, that he
[7:05] which hath begun a good work, he started
[7:07] it, he began it,
[7:08] &gt;&gt; will perform it until the day of Jesus
[7:11] Christ.
[7:12] &gt;&gt; That perform means bring to an end.
[7:15] &gt;&gt; There is a composer of of of his of a
[7:18] will and a desire and a plan for your
[7:20] life. He has composed it. Now, the Holy
[7:23] Spirit is conducting it and you are
[7:25] performing that will. And he will bring
[7:27] it to an end. Amen.
[7:29] &gt;&gt; He started it. He will complete it. He
[7:31] will finish it.
[7:33] &gt;&gt; He says in Revelations 22:13, I am alpha
[7:37] and omega, the beginning and the end. He
[7:40] is the key, the beginning and the end.
[7:42] The kota, the first and the last. That
[7:46] has a that's a means of wrapping it up.
[7:49] That's a means of starting it and
[7:50] finishing it. I do think that it speaks
[7:52] to to this idea of an all-encompassing
[7:56] endless God. But he's also saying that
[7:58] I've hid the end from the beginning.
[8:00] There's something about the beginning
[8:01] and the end. There's things that it
[8:03] relates to, but I am the mystery of the
[8:04] first and the last, the beginning and
[8:06] the end. The kingdom of God has these
[8:08] boundaries that sum it up.
[8:11] First Peter 1:es 3-9. I found that I was
[8:15] drawing significantly from uh Peter's
[8:18] letters
[8:19] says, "Blessed be the God and father of
[8:21] our Lord Jesus Christ, which according
[8:23] to his abundant mercy hath begotten us
[8:26] again were born again unto a lively
[8:29] hope." So this is a forwardlooking hope
[8:33] by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from
[8:34] the dead. Is this not what Paul was
[8:36] preaching in chapter 15 of 1 Corinthians
[8:39] that if Christ be not risen from the
[8:40] dead, there is no resurrection? And he's
[8:43] saying if Christ is risen, which our
[8:45] faith tells us he has, then there will
[8:47] be a resurrection of the believer.
[8:51] &gt;&gt; He that believeth, though he were dead,
[8:52] yet shall he live. So there is this hope
[8:55] of the resurrection
[8:57] by the resurrection of Jesus Christ. And
[9:00] this resurrection is in verse four, to
[9:01] an inheritance incorruptible and
[9:04] undefiled that fadeth not away, reserved
[9:06] in heaven for you.
[9:08] &gt;&gt; Aren't you so glad you have a
[9:09] reservation?
[9:11] It's reserved. You have, if this body
[9:14] dies, you already have one waiting for
[9:17] you.
[9:19] &gt;&gt; And it's reserved for those who are kept
[9:21] by the power of God through faith unto
[9:23] salvation, ready to be revealed in the
[9:26] last time. So this hope looks to this
[9:28] ending point. So he says, "Wherein ye
[9:31] greatly rejoice, this salvation, though
[9:34] now for a season, if need be, you're in
[9:35] heaviness through manifold temptations."
[9:38] This is that wars, rumors of wars,
[9:40] toiling, struggles, fighting,
[9:41] dissonance, all these things that
[9:43] greatly rejoice in this faith uh which
[9:46] is to and the salvation which is to be
[9:48] revealed
[9:50] that verse seven that the trial of your
[9:53] faith the testing the proving of your
[9:55] faith being much more precious than of
[9:58] gold that perisheth. Which is more
[10:00] precious? The faith or the trying? Both.
[10:03] &gt;&gt; The tried faith. This faith is so
[10:04] precious. The trying of it makes it
[10:06] purges it, makes it pure, though it be
[10:08] tried with fire that your faith may
[10:10] might be found unto praise and honor and
[10:12] glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ.
[10:14] And think of just how beautiful these
[10:16] words are from one Peter who knew him.
[10:20] &gt;&gt; Walked with him in the flesh. He says,
[10:22] "Whom having not seen, ye love."
[10:25] &gt;&gt; If that does not describe the gentile
[10:27] bride, it's you whom having not seen ye
[10:31] love. In whom though now though now you
[10:33] see him not yet believing ye rejoice
[10:36] with joy unspeak unspeakable and full of
[10:39] glory. This is p these are powerful
[10:41] words. This is describing who you are as
[10:44] a Christian. You haven't seen him
[10:46] &gt;&gt; but I've seen him in this. He's revealed
[10:48] himself to me. I know him that. Yes. And
[10:49] that's the beauty of it. You know him
[10:51] through the key of faith. you know him
[10:54] by revelation and you rejoice
[10:56] &gt;&gt; with joy and full of glory and you're
[10:58] looking forward to um things to come and
[11:02] you're believing that he's present now.
[11:03] That's the kind of faith that God wants
[11:05] you to have
[11:06] &gt;&gt; and that's the faith that's going to be
[11:08] tried
[11:09] &gt;&gt; is the faith that believes in having not
[11:11] seen through the heaviness and the
[11:14] manifold temptations.
[11:16] He's speaking he's speaking of very real
[11:19] challenges and persecutions
[11:21] and he says receiving the end of your
[11:23] faith even the salvation of your souls.
[11:27] So there's a finishing of your faith.
[11:29] That's why Paul said if we have faith in
[11:32] Christ but there be no resurrection then
[11:34] our faith is in vain because that faith
[11:36] speaks of an ending.
[11:39] &gt;&gt; We read it earlier in our text 1
[11:41] Corinthians chapter 15 21- 24. This is
[11:44] where he's saying if if we if Christ be
[11:47] not raised, your faith is in vain and
[11:49] you'll always be in your sin. Because if
[11:51] those that fell asleep in Christ perish,
[11:53] then in this life we only have hope,
[11:55] then we're most miserable. But he says
[11:58] that for since by man came death, by man
[12:02] came also the resurrection of the dead.
[12:03] That's Jesus Christ. For as in Adam all
[12:05] die, even so in Christ shall all be made
[12:07] alive. And then notice this. But every
[12:10] man in his own order. So it's showing
[12:12] this this work of God unfolding through
[12:14] the ages
[12:16] &gt;&gt; that there has been a cycle of revival
[12:18] and death. There has been many who have
[12:20] died in the faith believing in God and
[12:23] th those that believed in him though
[12:26] they were dead. They're living in a
[12:29] dimension of saints waiting in their
[12:31] theophony because the promise that you
[12:34] have an inheritance already reserved for
[12:36] you in heaven. So it's every man in his
[12:38] own order. Christ the first fruits. He
[12:40] was the firstborn among the dead.
[12:41] Afterwards, they that are Christ at his
[12:44] coming. Here is the resurrection to a
[12:46] new body. Then cometh the end.
[12:50] &gt;&gt; And when he says this, we could think
[12:51] say the end. The end. The end. And we
[12:53] might look towards the very end of the
[12:55] Bible. But this is a particular end when
[12:57] he shall delivered up the kingdom of
[12:58] God, even the father. For when he hath
[13:00] put down all rule and all authority and
[13:03] power. He's speaking specifically about
[13:05] death being triumphed over until finally
[13:09] the kota the ending then cometh the end
[13:12] when all and all will be in God.
[13:16] So if there is an end
[13:19] and we find that Jesus is raising the
[13:21] end in view when he says you're going to
[13:22] see a lot of these things happen but
[13:24] this has to happen then the end cometh
[13:27] and that there's a certain particular
[13:29] order of these unfolding but yet we have
[13:31] a faith that is tethered to something in
[13:33] the end. Peter writes in 1 Peter chapter
[13:36] 4:7 but the end of all things is at
[13:39] hand. Now notice this theme in the New
[13:42] Testament. They all wrote as if any
[13:43] moment the end would come. And it's
[13:46] important to live that way.
[13:48] &gt;&gt; It's important to live that uh I'm I'm
[13:50] going to through prudence plant my
[13:52] potatoes and live as if as if I have a
[13:55] lifetime yet instead ahead of me. So
[13:57] therefore, I'm going to teach my
[13:58] children. I'm going to establish correct
[14:00] order. I'm going to do all these things
[14:01] that a prudent wise man will do
[14:03] according to the scripture. Uh a brother
[14:05] uh shared with me a quote this morning.
[14:08] A and brother Nathaniel uh brother
[14:11] pastor Nate as we might call him.
[14:13] Brother Nathaniel Saias shared a quote
[14:15] from Lamb and Dove where God said,
[14:16] Brother Ram says, "We should have an
[14:18] intelligent church." And woo, I just
[14:20] imagine there's some people out there
[14:21] just had a heart attack and thought for
[14:23] sure that was AI, right? Because you
[14:26] can't have you can't have intelligence
[14:28] uh and believe the message. But there is
[14:31] uh an intelligence we have to have which
[14:33] is wisdom, prudence.
[14:36] &gt;&gt; So we should live as if our children are
[14:38] going to have grandchildren. So, we want
[14:40] to leave a legacy for our grandchildren
[14:43] so that when they raise their there's an
[14:45] inheritance for their for our sons
[14:48] through their children. And and I'm
[14:50] referring specifically to scriptural
[14:52] principles there. But then at the same
[14:54] time, we have to have an end in view.
[14:58] &gt;&gt; And that's what Paul is saying. If all
[15:00] you only look to this life alone for
[15:02] your faith, you're going to be
[15:03] miserable. So we want there to be this
[15:05] kindling and this if I could even say
[15:08] perhaps an edge or something unresolved
[15:10] in us that's always wanting to get to
[15:12] the end
[15:14] &gt;&gt; a goal in mind to say no matter how good
[15:17] it gets here no matter how pleased I am
[15:18] here no matter how well God is moving no
[15:20] matter how happy how happy I am in my
[15:22] marriage no matter how beautifully my
[15:23] children are being raised no matter how
[15:25] powerful the Lord is moving in our
[15:26] church services and the people that God
[15:28] gives us to serve God with I can say
[15:31] that with a group and I mean this from
[15:32] the bottom of my heart that the fact
[15:34] that I'm serving God with you all who
[15:36] are here this morning, it if the Lord
[15:38] was to terry another 50 years, it's
[15:40] going to be a wonderful journey to do it
[15:42] together.
[15:43] &gt;&gt; And that's how I feel. The people that
[15:45] God puts in your life and you're around,
[15:46] it's like, man, it's just wonderful to
[15:48] see God give us this kind of fellowship
[15:51] if this is going to linger. But there
[15:53] still must be a part of us that says,
[15:54] "But I'm not just here to stay, and I
[15:57] don't want to just go to a grave and
[15:59] remain there. I want my faith to see
[16:02] beyond this life.
[16:06] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[16:07] &gt;&gt; so Peter writes in first Peter chapter
[16:09] 4:7, "The end of all things is at hand.
[16:12] Be ye therefore sober in watch unto
[16:14] prayer." This is that deliberate mindset
[16:17] of enduring until the end. He that
[16:19] endureth to the end. There's this sense,
[16:23] this dissonance of the end is not yet,
[16:26] but it's nigh. It's here. It's ending.
[16:28] And if there is an ending, be sober and
[16:32] watch.
[16:34] Jesus says in Luke 14:es 28 to30,
[16:38] "Which of you intending to build a power
[16:40] tower, excuse me, intending to build a
[16:43] tower siteth not down first, and
[16:45] counteth the cost, whether he have
[16:47] sufficient to finish it." These are good
[16:49] instructions for um IKEA purchases,
[16:54] right? Look at all the parts, follow the
[16:56] instructions, make sure they're all
[16:57] there. I saw a joke the other day. I
[16:58] thought it was really good. They said
[16:59] that the there was a newly elected
[17:02] Swedish uh prime minister and they said
[17:05] he should have his cabinet put together
[17:06] by the end of the weekend.
[17:10] That's a political joke there. That was
[17:12] a good one. That's a number of levels
[17:14] there. Very layered.
[17:16] But you if you're going to build
[17:17] something, count the cost, budget, make
[17:20] sure you have the resources to finish
[17:23] it. Amen.
[17:24] &gt;&gt; It's one of those things that maybe
[17:26] haunt a lot of us is all the unfinished
[17:28] products.
[17:29] Uh I got a stack of analog cards, to-do
[17:32] cards, where it's like today, next day,
[17:35] and someday. And I should just order a
[17:37] pack of some days
[17:40] because there's this I need to do this.
[17:42] I need this. It gets uh further and
[17:43] further away. I have a spring cleaning
[17:45] list that obviously I'm going to get to
[17:47] maybe next spring.
[17:49] But you have to count whether you have
[17:51] sufficient to finish to end lest happily
[17:54] after he hath laid the foundation and is
[17:57] not able to finish it. Strong
[17:59] foundation, great foundation. But he
[18:01] says if it's not finished, all that
[18:03] behold it begin to mock him. And I want
[18:05] you to focus in on this aspect.
[18:07] Foundation's being laid and and work
[18:11] begun. But it's in the lack of finishing
[18:13] that the mocker is engaged. It's in the
[18:17] lack of finishing where you do not have
[18:20] the requisite
[18:22] uh um uh compliment or the the
[18:26] completion.
[18:28] And this is what they say saying this
[18:30] man began to build and was not able to
[18:33] finish.
[18:35] So foundations are wonderful, but you
[18:37] got to have a vision for what the
[18:38] finished product's going to look like.
[18:41] Something that you're aiming for.
[18:44] if you're not able to finish it, that's
[18:46] where the criticism comes from. Now, not
[18:49] solely
[18:51] uh due criticism, but even unwarranted
[18:54] criticism often is in the lack of a
[18:56] finish or the way that it's finished.
[18:58] So, that that lack of finishing becomes
[19:00] the sore spot. So, Paul writes in 1
[19:02] Corinthians chapter 9 vers 24, "Know ye
[19:04] not that they which run in a race run
[19:06] all, but one receiveth the prize?"
[19:09] Notice this. I think I might have had uh
[19:11] my scriptures uh mixed up there where it
[19:15] says where I had 2 Corinthians 9:6 put
[19:17] down there. But the the emphasis there
[19:20] is completing is important
[19:23] because a source of mockery is to not
[19:25] finish something. So he says in verse uh
[19:28] verse 24, "Know you not that they which
[19:30] run in a race run all, but one receiveth
[19:33] the prize.
[19:35] So run that you may obtain
[19:38] &gt;&gt; the prize. that there's a prize I'm
[19:40] aiming for. Paul talked about a reward
[19:43] which is being set before him that he
[19:45] might apprehend the high calling, the
[19:47] mark for the prize of the high calling.
[19:48] So, we are to run the race. We all run.
[19:51] He says, "But do you not know that even
[19:53] in our own sports, in our Olympics, that
[19:55] everyone runs, but there's only one that
[19:57] obtains the prize." And he's not trying
[19:58] to tell you you better outrun the next
[20:00] person. Uh it's more it's not the same
[20:04] facing a bear attack where if you run
[20:05] into a bear, just run faster than the
[20:07] person that's with you. It's you all
[20:09] have to run and the only way you can run
[20:11] is run in a manner such that you obtain
[20:13] the prize for you.
[20:16] &gt;&gt; It's that finish line.
[20:18] &gt;&gt; In Hebrews 12:es 1 to2, I hope you can
[20:20] see a lot of familiar scriptures that
[20:22] we've been repeating over this year.
[20:24] Wherefore, seeing we also are compassed
[20:25] about with so great a cloud of
[20:27] witnesses, let us lay aside every
[20:29] weight, all these preludes, all these
[20:31] believers that have gone before us, and
[20:34] the sin which doth so easily beset us,
[20:36] and let us run with patience the race
[20:39] that is set before us.
[20:41] &gt;&gt; There is a course before us. There is a
[20:44] race that you must run. That's why Paul
[20:46] said, "I have run my race. I have
[20:47] finished my course." He'd come to the
[20:49] kota of his course. He'd finished his
[20:51] faith. His faith was bringing him to he
[20:53] says the prize that is laid up for me
[20:55] and for all those who finish their race.
[20:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:59] &gt;&gt; So let us run looking unto Jesus the
[21:01] author and finisher of our faith.
[21:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:05] &gt;&gt; Who for the joy that was set before him
[21:07] endured the cross despising the shame
[21:08] and is set down at the right hand of the
[21:10] throne of God. We are to run
[21:14] and run in this race
[21:18] with the end in mind,
[21:21] with the goal in mind. You find this
[21:24] even to our young people that may say,
[21:25] "Well, if I can just graduate homeschool
[21:26] and then if I could just go to college
[21:28] and there's these benchmarks in life
[21:30] where you feel like maybe it's going to
[21:31] settle down and it's going to be you're
[21:33] going to kind of reach this plateau and
[21:34] you can just rest." No, this life is
[21:36] about laboring a and working and
[21:39] persevering and there's always going to
[21:40] be something next. and you come to
[21:41] retirement and you've saved up your
[21:43] whole life and you have enough money for
[21:44] retirement. Then you retire and you're
[21:46] bored to death being retired and so you
[21:48] want to figure out something to do so
[21:49] you could spend all the money before you
[21:50] have to leave it to your kids and there
[21:52] so there's always something next.
[21:53] There's always something left. Put up
[21:55] our donation link, brother John, for
[21:57] those facing that quandry.
[22:00] I'm kidding.
[22:01] But there is always a fa our faith has
[22:04] to be connected to something beyond
[22:06] tomorrow and the next day but an end.
[22:10] Notice how Jesus said that the mockery
[22:13] comes to those who don't finish. And so
[22:14] we got to run this race with the finish
[22:16] in mind in second Peter chapter 3:es 3
[22:19] and 4. Knowing this first, that there
[22:20] shall come in the last days scoffers
[22:24] and their mockery. Notice the source of
[22:26] their mockery. They're walking after
[22:27] their own lust. No, remember that first.
[22:29] Remember that you cannot get truth from
[22:32] a critic.
[22:34] &gt;&gt; You cannot get truth from a scoffer. The
[22:36] mockers and scoffers seek understanding
[22:39] and truth. And the Bible says they
[22:41] cannot find it.
[22:43] &gt;&gt; And so the scoffers are walking after
[22:45] their own lust. And they say, "Where is
[22:48] the promise of his coming?" And what is
[22:51] it they say? For since the fathers fell
[22:54] asleep, all things continue as they were
[22:56] from the beginning of creation. All
[22:59] things continue. In other words, it
[23:00] began. There's a foundation, but it's
[23:03] never ending.
[23:05] It's just this continuous uh unfolding
[23:07] without the hope of an end. And even in
[23:10] their eyes, they have this sense of,
[23:11] well, this is how it should end, and
[23:13] this is how it should be, and this is
[23:14] the promise of the end, and this is the
[23:16] last days, and it is at hand. And yet,
[23:18] here we are. It's been so many decades
[23:20] or so many hundreds of years or
[23:21] thousands of years, and everything just
[23:23] continues as it is
[23:26] because it's it's connected with that
[23:28] instinct of a mocker to look at a
[23:30] foundation and with a lack of a
[23:32] structure that's been completed and
[23:34] finished, mock it. So their mockery is
[23:36] in some ways connected to the lack of an
[23:40] end.
[23:42] And I believe that we must be convinced
[23:45] of a finish line.
[23:47] &gt;&gt; And if we can be convinced of an end, we
[23:50] should be focused on that. Not in a day
[23:53] or a date or even an idea of what that
[23:56] should look like, but rather the fact
[23:58] that we have there is an end to come.
[24:00] Then cometh the end. We've seen the
[24:03] prelude. We're in the masterpiece, but
[24:05] there's going to be a finish. So, we
[24:07] have an aim and a goal and objective
[24:09] about even if it's to scriptural
[24:12] principles related to this climactic
[24:15] finish that God wants to achieve in his
[24:17] bride.
[24:21] If you could look again at 1 Corinthians
[24:23] 15, we read, we went back over those
[24:25] verses in chapter in verses 21 where he
[24:27] says that death came by one man, life
[24:29] will come by another, but every man in
[24:31] his own order. says, "Then cometh the
[24:33] end."
[24:35] And he says, "When so the then cometh in
[24:38] when all things going to be delivered."
[24:40] Notice he says in verse 50, "Now this I
[24:42] say, brethren, that flesh and blood
[24:44] cannot inherit the kingdom of God,
[24:45] neither do corruption inherit
[24:47] incorruption." This is specifically
[24:49] related to this end. He says, "Behold, I
[24:51] show you a mystery." I just put this as
[24:53] the mystery of the kota because that
[24:55] kind of sounds mysterious.
[24:57] We should use this with other believers,
[24:59] right? Right? I said, "Well, do you
[25:00] understand the mystery of the Kota?" And
[25:03] they like, "Well, what is that?" Go,
[25:04] "Well, I think maybe you need to look
[25:06] into the mystery of the prelude." Right?
[25:09] They're like, "Is this a car?
[25:13] We shall not all sleep, but we shall all
[25:15] be changed."
[25:17] So, there's the sleeping and the living,
[25:21] &gt;&gt; but all of us are changing
[25:23] &gt;&gt; in a moment, in the twinkling of night,
[25:25] at the last trump.
[25:27] For the trumpet shall sound, and the
[25:29] dead shall be raised incorruptible, and
[25:30] we shall be changed. Notice the finality
[25:34] of this, the last trump. This finality
[25:36] doesn't mean there's not any more
[25:38] trumpets or something to sound, but it
[25:39] relates to the end, the climax of
[25:42] something in particular, it shall sound,
[25:44] and the dead shall be raised
[25:45] incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
[25:47] For this corruptible must put on
[25:48] incorruption, and this mortal must put
[25:51] on immortality.
[25:52] So when this corruptal shall have put on
[25:54] incorruption and this mortal shall have
[25:56] put on immortality, then shall be
[25:58] brought to pass the saying that is
[26:00] written, death is swallowed up in
[26:02] victory.
[26:03] &gt;&gt; What was it we read? That he must reign
[26:05] till death be put under his feet. The
[26:07] last enemy that shall be destroyed is
[26:09] death. I love the layering even of that
[26:11] prophecy because there is a death which
[26:14] is the result of sin that is completely
[26:16] vanquished in the bride. When there's
[26:18] those that do not taste death, that
[26:20] shows the justification. It shows the
[26:22] final uh uh condemning of death and the
[26:24] power no longer over the believer by by
[26:26] the blood of Jesus Christ. And then
[26:28] there's layerings of this prophecy to
[26:30] where in the end death is actually
[26:32] destroyed itself.
[26:35] &gt;&gt; And and it's that second death.
[26:38] &gt;&gt; But here he's talking about this time of
[26:39] this changing death is swallowed up in
[26:42] victory, not in defeat, not just in the
[26:46] lake of fire.
[26:48] So Paul writes this in 1 Thessalonians
[26:50] chapter 4 13 to18
[26:55] and I I I find it
[27:00] um let me see if I could just turn
[27:02] there. He he mentions how don't be
[27:05] troubled
[27:06] e even as it were if it was by letter
[27:09] from us.
[27:11] And so I was thinking of how Paul
[27:14] instructed the believers to read his
[27:15] letters in churches.
[27:18] And so there was uh you know they take
[27:20] Paul's letters and they would read them
[27:21] and share them and they'd quote the
[27:22] Apostle Paul to one another. And and I
[27:25] thought that he said do not be troubled
[27:27] as it might some might think that even
[27:29] as letter by us and if we're worried
[27:31] about AI
[27:33] creating a fake message or sermon even
[27:36] where it's in the voice of brother don't
[27:38] worry about it. Paul's believers would
[27:39] be like, "Man, let me tell you, there
[27:41] was this forger back in the day who'd
[27:44] perfected Paul's exaggerated large
[27:46] handwriting, and man, you had to know.
[27:48] You just had to know God and have the
[27:50] Holy Spirit and not worry about whether
[27:52] or not the letter was from Paul." So,
[27:54] don't worry about what AI can do.
[27:56] There's something about the genuine that
[27:57] can always sp identify the artificial.
[28:01] &gt;&gt; And hey, if it agrees with the word,
[28:04] hey,
[28:05] &gt;&gt; I like that. But the you're you're
[28:08] trusting in the Holy Spirit.
[28:10] &gt;&gt; 1 Thessalonians chapter 4 13-18. But I
[28:13] would not have you be ignorant, brother,
[28:14] concerning them which are asleep.
[28:17] This is uh this is about
[28:21] uh um death.
[28:24] He's writing this to the Corinthians,
[28:26] but let me talk to you about those. I
[28:27] show you a mystery. We're not all going
[28:29] to sleep. It's what he's writing about
[28:31] and saying, "Wow, you know, if there's
[28:32] not a resurrection, then we of all
[28:34] people are most miserable."
[28:37] So, he's writing to the Corinthians in a
[28:39] way to encourage them and uplift them to
[28:40] look to the resurrection. Even you who
[28:43] have the resurrection and life in you
[28:45] now, we're still forwardlooking. So, we
[28:47] should not sorrow as others who have no
[28:49] hope because Peter said, "We begin born
[28:51] again unto a living hope, which is that
[28:53] incorruptible inheritance. For we
[28:56] believe that Jesus died and rose again,
[28:58] even so them also which uh them also
[29:01] which sleep in Jesus will God bring with
[29:03] him. For this we say unto you by the
[29:06] word of the Lord, that we which are
[29:09] alive and remain under the coming of the
[29:11] Lord shall not prevent them which are
[29:12] asleep will not come before. because he
[29:14] said to the Corinthians, "Every man in
[29:15] his own order. For the Lord himself
[29:18] shall descend from heaven with a shout,
[29:20] with the voice of the archangel, and
[29:22] with the trump of God, and the dead in
[29:25] Christ shall rise first. Then we which
[29:28] are alive and remain shall be caught up
[29:30] together with them in the clouds to meet
[29:34] the Lord in the air." Notice when he
[29:35] descends in this scriptural prophecy.
[29:38] It's not to set feet on earth through
[29:41] his own corporal body
[29:43] &gt;&gt; to reveal himself to the Gentiles.
[29:45] &gt;&gt; There's that coming even to the Jews
[29:48] &gt;&gt; that they're looking forward to. A
[29:49] coming of the corporal body to reveal
[29:51] himself to the Jews. That's after we're
[29:53] gone.
[29:54] &gt;&gt; But to the bride, this mystery of the
[29:56] kota, to the gentile church, which is
[29:59] his body that he reveals this mystery of
[30:01] in his own ministry, that upon this rock
[30:03] will I build and lay the foundation of
[30:05] my church. and he's going to finish it
[30:07] to this climactic finish. The Lord
[30:09] himself shall descend and we will meet
[30:12] him in the air.
[30:14] &gt;&gt; And so shall we ever be with the Lord.
[30:17] &gt;&gt; Those are just and the pun is intended
[30:20] rapturous words,
[30:23] &gt;&gt; thrilling words. So he says in verse 18,
[30:25] wherefore comfort one another with these
[30:28] words.
[30:29] &gt;&gt; So the kota is a source of comfort.
[30:33] That's right.
[30:34] &gt;&gt; The the true ending.
[30:38] Jesus who for the joy which was set
[30:40] before him endured the cross, the death,
[30:45] the agony, the rejection, the
[30:47] persecution, the beatings, the
[30:48] despising, the lies, the falsities, all
[30:51] those things. And then even the death,
[30:52] the excruciating death for the joy which
[30:55] was set after that but yet before him.
[30:59] So for us, we may look at our lives and
[31:01] say, "Oh, well, I I'm sick. I'm getting
[31:03] old. I may have to die." Listen, there
[31:05] is no shame in dying.
[31:08] &gt;&gt; Zero. None.
[31:11] &gt;&gt; Death has lost its sting.
[31:13] &gt;&gt; There's no victory. The devil may dance
[31:15] on your grave, but you'll forever be the
[31:18] soul that got away.
[31:21] &gt;&gt; He can burn your house to the
[31:22] floorboards. He can dance through your
[31:24] minds. He can do all sorts of things. He
[31:26] wants to torment you. a a and rail
[31:29] against you, but you'll never be his.
[31:33] &gt;&gt; And in the end, you will always be and
[31:35] he'll have he'll be finished.
[31:38] &gt;&gt; And so, we're looking past sufferings of
[31:40] this present times, graveside services,
[31:43] our own death. That's not going to I
[31:46] fear I'm not going to be afraid of
[31:47] death. Yes, it can seem to be
[31:48] bittersweet in terms of those you leave
[31:50] behind. But let us live such a life to
[31:52] if we actually left loved ones behind,
[31:55] they could take courage and the life
[31:57] that we lived and the legacy we left to
[32:00] say, I am not I may miss them, but for a
[32:02] few days or years, but one day I'll see
[32:05] them again in a meeting in the air.
[32:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[32:08] &gt;&gt; Because their lives weren't shaken and
[32:10] rattled at the prospect of death.
[32:12] &gt;&gt; They knew God worked all things together
[32:14] for good. Amen.
[32:17] &gt;&gt; We shall meet the Lord in the air
[32:20] together.
[32:22] &gt;&gt; Comfort one another with these words.
[32:25] &gt;&gt; That's the the coder, the resolution.
[32:29] The grave is dissonant, isn't it? The
[32:32] grave is foroding and suspenseful what
[32:34] lays in the end. But the the
[32:36] resurrection, the meeting in the air
[32:40] resolves everything. There's even this
[32:41] sense I believe even as brother Brandham
[32:43] described it as who's going to be there
[32:45] right there's this resolution
[32:50] and brother Bradam says in the sermon
[32:51] power of transformation this is the
[32:53] climax age
[32:56] this is the age beyond those
[32:58] denominations
[32:59] &gt;&gt; we could take um brother Bradam's
[33:01] sermons especially since we have 1200 of
[33:02] them and we have the words recorded that
[33:06] we could hear and we could transcribe
[33:07] and we could we could even use analytics
[33:10] to go through and comb through the
[33:11] message and we could try to distill it
[33:13] down to all these different points that
[33:15] if you're a Christian, you must do this
[33:17] and and and it could be incredibly
[33:19] misleading.
[33:21] But what one of the main things that you
[33:23] have to that brother Brandon was
[33:25] pointing to is the last times, the end
[33:28] of times.
[33:29] &gt;&gt; That that's the day and age, the time
[33:31] that we're living in is the climax of
[33:34] the ages, the ending time.
[33:36] And truthfully,
[33:39] I don't know that there should be much
[33:40] debate even for those who re would
[33:42] reject u brother Bram's ministry or they
[33:45] say they don't believe it's scriptural
[33:46] or if they don't even believe he was a
[33:48] prophet or even a Christian. Whatever
[33:49] those reasons are, if someone was to
[33:51] believe in Christ in the Bible, I think
[33:53] most people would probably agree that
[33:55] it's getting pretty late.
[33:59] &gt;&gt; They might have their own reasons for
[34:00] doing it,
[34:02] &gt;&gt; but that's one of the things that to
[34:03] recognize is this is a climactic time.
[34:05] the climax age,
[34:07] &gt;&gt; the age of the finish. In Zechariah 4:es
[34:11] 5-9, then the angel that talked with me
[34:13] answered and said, "No, knowest thou not
[34:15] what these be?" And kind of skipping
[34:17] into the middle of this, and he they
[34:18] said, "I I said, no, my lord." So what
[34:20] do these things mean? Then he answered
[34:22] and spake unto me, saying this, "This is
[34:24] the word of the Lord unto Zerubable,
[34:26] saying, not by might, nor by power, but
[34:28] by my spirit, sayeth the Lord of hosts."
[34:31] &gt;&gt; How's he going to do it? He's the one
[34:33] composing. He's the one conducting. He's
[34:35] the one both to will and to do of his
[34:37] good pleasure in you. This treasure and
[34:38] earth and vessels. Who art thou, oh
[34:40] great mountain, before Zerubable. Thou
[34:42] shalt become a plain.
[34:44] &gt;&gt; This speaks of this ministry of Christ,
[34:46] the Lord himself. And he shall bring
[34:48] forth the headstone. That's the
[34:49] capstone, the finishing thereof with
[34:52] shoutings, crying, grace, grace unto it.
[34:55] &gt;&gt; This is that finishing.
[34:58] This is a finishing scene. Even in this
[35:00] chapter says, who has despised the day
[35:02] of small things? It's the finishing up.
[35:04] It's the buttoning up. Moreover, the
[35:05] word Lord came unto me, saying, "The
[35:07] hands of Zerubel have laid the
[35:09] foundation of this house. And though
[35:11] it's been mocked and laughed at and
[35:13] scorned and ridiculed as rubble, his
[35:16] hands shall also finish it.
[35:19] &gt;&gt; The Lord will bring again Zion. He will
[35:22] repair her walls. He will establish her.
[35:25] She will come forth."
[35:27] &gt;&gt; And thou shalt know that the Lord of
[35:29] hosts hath sent me unto it.
[35:32] There's a foundation. There is a
[35:34] beginning. There is an alpha.
[35:36] &gt;&gt; There is a first.
[35:38] &gt;&gt; There is an omega. There's a completion.
[35:41] There is a last. We are in the kod.
[35:46] &gt;&gt; We are in the final section of God's
[35:49] great masterpiece.
[35:51] &gt;&gt; It could be yet just a few more
[35:54] measures. It could be that as we've seen
[35:56] this beautifully unfolding entire
[35:58] section and it may seem that it lasts
[36:00] for quite some time but this is God how
[36:02] God composed it. Amen.
[36:05] &gt;&gt; Some some composers who've written
[36:08] songs, they have these outros or what we
[36:10] might say in gospel music a tag that
[36:13] plays out for a very long time. And God
[36:16] has written this last piece, this kota.
[36:18] And it seems to be much longer than
[36:20] perhaps we thought it was. But we're
[36:22] right here in these final this is the
[36:24] ending.
[36:29] Jeremiah 29 10-14.
[36:33] Well, I I I want to read this in
[36:35] closing. I have one more scripture after
[36:36] this one. And I'm reading this with the
[36:40] intent that I want you to put yourself
[36:43] in the the position of the Jews who were
[36:48] given a promised land, weren't faithful
[36:50] or obedient, and because of that, they
[36:51] were carried away captive into Babylon.
[36:54] &gt;&gt; But by prophecy, they were going to come
[36:56] out of that captivity.
[37:00] And
[37:06] we
[37:08] we likewise are here in Babylon.
[37:12] We're in this prison house of a flesh.
[37:16] We we suffer great pains. I would even
[37:19] say that
[37:21] a lot of people's criticisms of maybe
[37:23] you may feel that in your life the
[37:25] criticisms aren't so much about the fact
[37:27] that you have a foundation and you're a
[37:29] Christian, but it's everything that's
[37:31] happened afterwards.
[37:33] Not so much that you've backslid, but
[37:35] just the fact that you're all still here
[37:37] or you've lost this and this person
[37:39] doesn't believe and you don't have that
[37:40] and this hasn't happened and that hasn't
[37:42] happened. And it may be this sense of
[37:44] well everyone looks at this my testimony
[37:46] back then when I came to the Lord and
[37:48] everyone is now looking at me saying
[37:50] well where has it got you? You still
[37:52] just kind of I mean look where you are.
[37:56] &gt;&gt; But God's not done yet.
[37:58] &gt;&gt; For thus sayeth the Lord that after 70
[38:00] years be accomplished at Babylon, I will
[38:02] visit you and perform my good word
[38:04] toward you in causing you to return to
[38:07] this place. This is very familiar
[38:10] scripture. For I know the thoughts that
[38:11] I think toward you, sayeth the Lord,
[38:14] thoughts of peace and not of evil, to
[38:17] give you an expected end.
[38:20] &gt;&gt; God's thoughts of you are these complete
[38:22] thoughts. He has he's for he has the the
[38:24] beginning from the end and the in
[38:26] between. Brother Jake, that's why I
[38:27] really loved your song this morning.
[38:29] Until then,
[38:31] &gt;&gt; it the song speaks of a beginning, the
[38:33] difficulties in the middle, but there's
[38:35] going to be a day and a time when my
[38:37] eyes will behold that city. But until
[38:39] then,
[38:40] &gt;&gt; going to persevere. I'm going to endure
[38:42] in the meantime, in the middle,
[38:46] &gt;&gt; knowing that that God has thoughts of
[38:49] peace for me to give you a finish.
[38:54] &gt;&gt; He calls it an expected end.
[38:57] Just that that stroke of his
[38:59] masterpiece, then shall you call upon
[39:01] me, and you shall go and pray unto me,
[39:04] and I will hearken unto you. This is
[39:05] what we do in the cod. This is what we
[39:07] do in the ending. If I'm in the ending,
[39:09] if I'm expecting an end, then I'm going
[39:10] to pray. I'm going to call upon him and
[39:12] you shall seek me and find me when you
[39:14] shall search for me with all your heart.
[39:16] Perhaps that's what we need to do about
[39:17] the end.
[39:22] &gt;&gt; And I will be found of you, sayaeth the
[39:24] Lord, and I will turn away your
[39:26] captivity, and I will gather you from
[39:28] all nations and from all the places
[39:30] whether I have driven you, sayith the
[39:31] Lord. and I will bring you again into
[39:33] the place whence I caused you to be
[39:36] carried away captive.
[39:38] &gt;&gt; I will bring you back home.
[39:40] &gt;&gt; The the beginning point
[39:43] they were driven away into all this
[39:46] dissonant meandering but then finally he
[39:48] resolves it brings them right back to
[39:50] what they believed in the first place.
[39:54] I think that we have a duty to look at
[39:56] the composition, the masterpiece, the
[39:58] word that God's given us and just see it
[40:00] accumulating all up.
[40:02] If we aren't convinced of the end time,
[40:04] if we're not convinced of the moment
[40:06] that we're living in, and we misperceive
[40:08] where we are now, it's very easy to
[40:10] misinterpret what has been, well, maybe
[40:12] God didn't do this for me, or maybe this
[40:14] wasn't real. And all this all these
[40:16] questions begin to arise. But if you can
[40:17] let it all accumulate up in your heart
[40:19] and consider whether it be of God or
[40:21] not,
[40:23] because we're in these last moments.
[40:26] If our musicians could come
[40:30] my final scriptures in Psalms 138 67 and
[40:33] 8.
[40:35] Though the Lord be high, yet hath he
[40:38] respect unto the lowly,
[40:45] the humble, the broken,
[40:48] the vulnerable.
[40:49] This is the necessity of evil.
[40:52] But the proud,
[40:54] he knoweth the far off.
[40:57] So he's high, but he's near the
[41:00] brokenhearted.
[41:02] He's near the humble. The proud he
[41:04] knows, but he's distant.
[41:07] So he says, "Though I walk in the midst
[41:09] of trouble,
[41:11] for in the time of trouble, he shall
[41:14] hide me. Though I walk in the midst of
[41:15] trouble, thou wilt revive me." Anybody
[41:19] here just need a little pickme up, a
[41:22] little reviving?
[41:24] Man, maybe I should preach a sermon on
[41:26] caffeine, spiritual caffeine.
[41:30] And and and because I mean, you think
[41:31] about it, we I just need a pickme up. I
[41:33] just need a jolt. And uh and and so
[41:37] whether whether you're trying to micro
[41:39] dose things to stay just primed and
[41:41] focused all day or taking something just
[41:43] to get jacked and real ripped up for a
[41:45] good workout, we want God to revive us.
[41:50] &gt;&gt; Thou shalt stretch forth thine hand
[41:53] against the wrath of mine enemies. Thy
[41:56] right hand shall save me.
[41:58] [Music]
[42:00] &gt;&gt; I believe he fights your battles now.
[42:02] Amen.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; I believe if you have experienced loss
[42:05] in this life that you ought to look at
[42:08] it differently and say, "Well, there's
[42:09] got to be victory in there somewhere."
[42:13] &gt;&gt; But no matter what you face now that has
[42:16] caused you to feel low regardless of
[42:17] your pain and your trouble and what you
[42:20] seem to be afflicted by, his hand is
[42:23] still reaching out to you.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; It will come against the mockery and the
[42:29] scoffing and the wrath of your enemies.
[42:30] Even that enemy which is death that
[42:32] would eat up your flesh, his right hand
[42:34] will save you.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; So he says in verse eight, the Lord will
[42:39] perfect that which concernth me.
[42:43] &gt;&gt; The Lord, this may not sound good in
[42:45] some context, but the Lord will finish
[42:46] you.
[42:48] &gt;&gt; He what what your fears are, your
[42:51] worries, those things that antagonize
[42:53] you, the Lord will accomplish.
[42:56] He'll give purpose and reason to it.
[42:58] This thing has bothered me my whole
[43:00] life. This haunts me. I don't know how
[43:02] to make sense of this. God will perfect,
[43:04] accomplish, resolve, and bring to an end
[43:08] all those things that worry you. All
[43:10] those things that bother you, all those
[43:12] things that concern you, he will finish
[43:15] it.
[43:17] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[43:17] &gt;&gt; He will perfect it.
[43:20] So the psalmist says, "Thy mercy, oh
[43:22] Lord, endureth forever."
[43:25] And he sings it as a prayer, but I
[43:26] believe we should take it as even an
[43:29] absolute promise. Forsake not the works
[43:32] of thine own hands.
[43:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; You are his work. You are his
[43:36] masterpiece.
[43:38] I could say this with absolute certainty
[43:40] today. It's not too late to believe in a
[43:44] great finish.
[43:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:47] to look positively towards the word of
[43:49] God
[43:51] &gt;&gt; because he says, "Forsake not the works
[43:53] of thine own hands. You are his uh
[43:56] masterpiece. You are his building. You
[43:58] are his husbandry.
[44:01] You are his creation.
[44:04] You are the one that he's working on."
[44:06] And listen, even if there's times as
[44:07] he's forming us and we get along
[44:09] comfortable and we've tried to fight
[44:11] ourselves off the off the wheel and and
[44:13] maybe we fall and we get broken up, he
[44:16] just kind of gathers it back in again.
[44:19] Brother Victor, this is your chance to
[44:20] amen begins to work that clay a little
[44:22] bit, right? There's a point where you
[44:24] have to throw it away. Has to start all
[44:26] over and go through the process. But
[44:27] they could even still reuse that.
[44:31] But God knows just how to work it
[44:34] &gt;&gt; in your life. He's still making you. And
[44:37] sometimes where we are is maybe we're in
[44:40] that last firing part
[44:44] &gt;&gt; in the kiln. That's why it's getting so
[44:45] hot.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; But what is it doing? It's creating that
[44:48] glaze,
[44:49] &gt;&gt; that perfect patina, that beautiful
[44:51] look.
[44:52] &gt;&gt; And you look at it and go, "Oh man, when
[44:54] I've made this and when or when it was
[44:56] being made and I looked at it, I
[44:58] couldn't really see just how beautiful
[44:59] it was." But God used just the way he
[45:01] made me,
[45:03] &gt;&gt; just exactly what he allowed to take
[45:05] place. Remember the the flaw paradox?
[45:08] How God fills in the cracks with himself
[45:10] and he's producing something beautiful,
[45:12] something perfect. Sometimes we have in
[45:15] our minds what perfection looks like.
[45:16] But I just would rather take his way of
[45:19] perfection. Jesus Christ, the lamb of
[45:21] God, does not look like a perfect son of
[45:24] God. As I read his life story and the
[45:27] narrative and the arc of his life, I see
[45:29] a lot of things that are troublesome and
[45:31] disconcerting. But I believe the Bible
[45:33] what it says he did only that which the
[45:35] father told him to do. That he was
[45:37] without sin. And though he was beaten
[45:39] and broken and lied and persecuted and
[45:41] misunderstood, God has raised him up to
[45:43] great glory. And I believe that if God
[45:46] raised Jesus Christ from the dead and he
[45:48] sits at the right hand of God right now,
[45:50] forever making intercession for you,
[45:52] that we have every right to believe in a
[45:55] great glorious finish. And we're living
[45:57] in those moments right now.
[45:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; This is the ending.
[46:02] &gt;&gt; This is the time. And God will perfect
[46:05] your masterpiece.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; We can have that assurance. We can
[46:09] believe it with all of our hearts. He
[46:11] will perfect. He will end. He will
[46:12] finish that which he started. If you're
[46:15] uncertain, just go back to the prelude.
[46:18] If you're uncertain, just go back to the
[46:20] whole composition. Start to rehearse
[46:22] again all the things that has unfolded
[46:25] through these different movements and
[46:26] these different and then you realize now
[46:28] we're living out the end that ties up
[46:30] all the loose ends that looks back and
[46:32] it builds momentum and it ends it with a
[46:36] meeting in the air.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; I'm living for that.
[46:40] We had a theme in our family for quite
[46:41] some time. We haven't lost this vision.
[46:43] But the rapture is our goal.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; And I'm more aware than ever that we're
[46:48] going to have to live the word to leave
[46:50] here.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; But I don't ever want to forget why I'm
[46:54] living.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; And it's because I want to meet him in
[46:59] the air. And if we go by the way of the
[47:01] grave, any one of us go by way of the
[47:03] grave, we know, we have a promise, we
[47:05] have an assurance that we'll meet the
[47:07] Lord in the air.
[47:09] and forever all of us together be with
[47:12] him. If we could stand today,
[47:18] [Music]
[47:23] take that hand of faith and grab a hold
[47:26] of the key
[47:28] because that's what the ending is.
[47:31] Christ the resurrection and the life.
[47:35] He that believeth in me, though he were
[47:37] dead, yet shall he live. And he that
[47:40] believeth in me, shall never die.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; There's going to be a people on earth
[47:46] who are alive and remain.
[47:49] I believe we're living in a great time.
[47:51] Let's pray. Our gracious heavenly
[47:52] father, as we close this service in
[47:55] prayer, I'm praying that your grace
[47:56] would be upon your people,
[48:00] Lord. just feeling this inspiration
[48:02] through early last week and just filled
[48:04] it building for some time.
[48:07] My prayer is that these words would
[48:09] comfort us.
[48:11] I know that we face a lot of pressure
[48:13] especially in this day and age where
[48:15] there's so much so many podcast and
[48:17] blogs and vlogs and
[48:20] uh so many influencers
[48:23] whether it be Tik Tok or through shorts
[48:24] or X or whatever it might be that tell
[48:27] us all about family planning and what it
[48:31] means to be a traditional wife and what
[48:33] it means to be a man and how to run
[48:37] homeschool properly and having a vision
[48:40] and all these lofty ideals sometimes
[48:42] that just bear down so hard on us
[48:46] and we feel like, man, I got to come up
[48:48] with a business plan. I got to get a
[48:49] private placement memorandum together. I
[48:51] got to figure out my mission statement.
[48:53] Lord, I believe that we can say very
[48:55] simply on a very high level.
[48:58] I want to see you one day in the air.
[49:02] That the time that I'm living in now is
[49:03] I'm living for a rapture. I'm living for
[49:06] a change.
[49:08] And Lord, I know that has a lot of
[49:09] ramifications, but it kind of sets that
[49:12] overarching principle
[49:15] to ask myself what things are expedient,
[49:17] what think what things aren't. And it
[49:19] can just be as simple as that is that I
[49:22] want my life to be lived by the word
[49:26] so that I hasten the day that I see you
[49:32] as you are in that glorified body. Am I
[49:34] in my own? and to ever be with the Lord.
[49:38] Lord, may we have a greater vision for
[49:40] Dakota, this ending, this great
[49:42] climactic finish where these notes are
[49:44] being played out. We're not looking for
[49:46] another movement, Lord. We're not
[49:47] looking for another section. We're not
[49:49] looking for another composer or leader
[49:51] or chorus. This is the ending. May we be
[49:54] faithful in it, Lord.
[49:57] Comfort those hearts that are hurting.
[49:58] Lord, there's others who've lost loved
[49:59] ones.
[50:01] Others, Lord, that we've heard of that
[50:03] have uh being buried, Lord, is even
[50:08] those that are facing great trials,
[50:10] great crossroads of decisions to be
[50:12] made. Our prayers are with them, Lord.
[50:15] We love you. We pray a special blessing
[50:17] upon brother Andrew today and his 40th
[50:19] birthday. We appreciate him. Be with him
[50:21] in his travels. Be with his family as he
[50:23] leaves them behind. Be with my family,
[50:25] Lord, as we travel.
[50:27] Lord, bless these people.
[50:30] Lord, I honestly say just buried in my
[50:32] soul that my wife and I have found
[50:36] vacation so much more enjoyable because
[50:38] we so look forward to being back home
[50:40] with these believers.
[50:42] And so, Lord, we know that as our trip
[50:45] winds down, there'll be no dread in
[50:47] returning back. But we pray that you
[50:48] bless us on our trip and be with those
[50:50] that we leave behind. We love you. We
[50:52] ask this in the name of Lord Jesus
[50:53] Christ. Amen.
