[0:00] Romans 1311 to13 it
[0:03] says and that knowing the time now that
[0:07] it is high time to wake out of sleep for
[0:11] now is this our Salvation nearer than
[0:14] when we
[0:15] believed the night is far spent the day
[0:19] is at hand let us therefore cast off the
[0:22] works of darkness let us put off put on
[0:25] the armor of light let us walk honestly
[0:28] as in the day not in rioting or in
[0:31] drunkenness not in U chambering or
[0:34] wantedness not in strife and
[0:37] envying let you may be
[0:41] seated um I I believe that's a fitting
[0:44] scripture today um when there's a lot of
[0:47] people that's what they're doing they're
[0:49] out in the night in drunkenness they're
[0:52] doing all these things right but if we
[0:55] can stay in the light as a Christian I
[0:57] think that's the best thing to do um if
[1:00] You' like to turn with me also to
[1:02] Genesis or you don't have to but I'm
[1:03] going to read this real quick Genesis
[1:07] 32:31 it's um in the story of Jacob
[1:11] where Jacob wrestles with the man it
[1:14] says the Angel God he after he was done
[1:19] he asked the man what's your name the
[1:22] man didn't want to tell him his name but
[1:24] he had a revelation that he said well I
[1:26] just met God face to face right and here
[1:29] in 32:31 it says and he passed over
[1:32] Pinel the sun rose upon him and he
[1:36] halted upon his thigh yeah so um I I I
[1:40] think that's such a good picture to see
[1:44] because the day has come he's a happy
[1:48] man right he's limping it looks like he
[1:51] the Bible says that he overcame but in
[1:53] reality he just got beat up by by an
[1:56] Angel by a man by God right but he
[1:59] prevailed right and now finally the son
[2:03] is on him and whatever he was afraid to
[2:06] face that day he was able to face it
[2:09] because he went through that long hard
[2:11] night I want to read a little scripture
[2:16] or a little quote from brother brandham
[2:18] and
[2:19] Shalom where he says my New Year's
[2:21] message is to the church elected in
[2:23] Jesus Christ for
[2:26] 1964 not not just to the church groups
[2:30] but the elect lady the lady of the
[2:32] church Christ bride see that's who I'm
[2:35] addressing we're facing here in our two
[2:38] subject that we read two scriptures
[2:41] rather a very contrast one to another in
[2:44] Isaiah it says arise and shine for the
[2:48] glory of God has come upon you the light
[2:50] is here and then the very next verse he
[2:53] says gross darkness is upon the people
[2:57] right and when we are in a mixture his
[3:00] of light and darkness then my address to
[3:03] the church is Shalom peace let's find
[3:07] out what it's all about see we're facing
[3:10] this year with both Darkness and Light
[3:14] Where We Are The World is one of the
[3:16] most chaotic times of Darkness that it
[3:18] ever has stood in and is standing in
[3:22] again the the Most Blessed light that it
[3:25] ever did Shine in and there is there it
[3:28] is so that's one thing that we can see
[3:32] is brother brandham he he said the these
[3:35] um these words and if you ever listen to
[3:38] I'm sure everybody's listened to Shalom
[3:40] yeah but he
[3:43] was always showed and reveal to to us
[3:47] that the seven Church ages they
[3:51] represented the moon so when Jesus left
[3:55] the scene and he said I promise that I'm
[3:57] going to send the comforter that that
[3:59] was a nighttime right the darkness went
[4:03] over the Earth and he said now I'm going
[4:06] not going to have my full presence on
[4:08] the earth or or My fullness upon the
[4:10] Earth but you little flock are going to
[4:13] reflect my word right so throughout the
[4:16] seven Church ages the churches reflected
[4:20] Jesus Christ and every Church reflected
[4:24] a portion of Jesus Christ the Bible says
[4:26] ye are the light of the world so it
[4:29] wasn't his direct presence anymore but
[4:32] it was through the church the seven
[4:34] Church ages had the moon phases right
[4:37] because he said that the church was a
[4:39] type of the moon and the only way the
[4:42] light would be shown to the world is
[4:44] through this moon right and so now that
[4:47] you can't
[4:48] see the sun anymore but you can see the
[4:52] light through the
[4:53] church and we find brother brandham he
[4:56] says in Shalom we find out the moon and
[4:58] the heavens reflects the light of the
[5:00] Sun in the absence of the sun right so
[5:03] the son said hey I've got to leave I've
[5:07] got to go but I'm going to send a
[5:09] comforter and then you are the light of
[5:11] the world now so there's an absence of
[5:14] the Sun and that now there's a Darkness
[5:17] over the whole entire world right and
[5:19] and brother brandom says that's a
[5:21] darkness of worldism of
[5:24] unbelief this whole Darkness but the
[5:26] churches would always reflect that light
[5:30] and here at night it if you look
[5:35] throughout the whole Bible it it
[5:37] say if you would like to see in certain
[5:41] scriptures like Matthew 25 uh scriptures
[5:45] in uh Psalms 30
[5:49] 18 it talks about the night as being a
[5:52] time of striving weeping and and and
[5:55] almost awaiting time that there's going
[5:58] to be a getting a ready time in the
[6:01] gospels um the night also becomes
[6:03] something like a uh an apprehension a
[6:07] trial potentially symbolizing a
[6:10] spiritual TR struggle whenever Jesus
[6:12] whenever he gave the Last Supper there
[6:15] was a struggle right there was a stress
[6:18] there was something going on there
[6:19] because the night was there there was a
[6:22] struggle because the day was about to
[6:24] happen and and Jesus was going to be
[6:27] crucified so
[6:30] the the night always seems like there's
[6:32] going to be a struggle a weeping a
[6:35] travail something's going to
[6:38] happen brother brandham he says that
[6:40] when Jesus was there in Gethsemane he
[6:42] says Prevail means wrestle and overcome
[6:45] oh my The Garden of Gethsemane when the
[6:48] blood dropped down from his face he was
[6:51] overcoming see see he was
[6:55] overcoming so when Jesus he was there
[6:58] praying to God there was a prevailing
[7:01] there was a wrestling there was a
[7:02] weeping there was something going on
[7:04] where Jesus needed something from God so
[7:08] at night that's what it was and
[7:10] throughout the seven Church ages that's
[7:12] what it has been right it has been a a
[7:15] weeping a
[7:17] striving for
[7:19] something that's what it has been in
[7:21] Psalms 35 it says anger endureth but a
[7:25] moment but his favor is life yes weeping
[7:30] may endure for a night but joy cometh in
[7:33] the
[7:34] morning now um this word weeping may
[7:38] endure for a night the word endure is is
[7:41] in the Hebrew word is to Lodge or to
[7:45] sojourn and it's almost like a person
[7:48] coming in and lodging with you so so
[7:52] it's almost somebody coming in and it's
[7:55] a stranger that is going to stay there
[7:57] for a night yeah wow and and and weeping
[8:00] is not you it's not the bad thing
[8:04] there's something that caused the
[8:05] Weeping right so there there's there's a
[8:08] something that caused the struggle and
[8:10] now weeping has come right and and and
[8:13] so it says like as a person but joy
[8:17] comes in the morning meaning there's
[8:20] another person coming and it's going to
[8:23] cause the Hebrew word joy and somebody
[8:27] to cause to chout and and that's what's
[8:30] going on today where there is a weeping
[8:33] there is a a crying out for
[8:36] something now brother brandham he starts
[8:39] talking about this mixture of light and
[8:41] darkness that this is different than all
[8:44] the other ages because all the other
[8:46] ages they had this light on in the moon
[8:50] every time but whenever he starts
[8:52] talking about this this is completely
[8:54] different right that many many events
[8:57] they occurred in that time and revealed
[9:00] that the light the the lights that he
[9:03] drew on the
[9:05] board they they changed in the lady oia
[9:08] so do you remember whenever he had that
[9:11] Revelation and the Lord showed him how
[9:16] to draw those the moon phases and
[9:18] showing okay the light this is how the
[9:21] light is going to be in every
[9:24] Age and and things happened during this
[9:28] message that brother Brandon preached in
[9:30] Shalom where he said that there's now
[9:32] there's a mixture there there's a total
[9:34] blackout yet there's light right and it
[9:37] says that because there's been a lot of
[9:41] uh events that happened and what what
[9:43] happened and so brother Brandon preached
[9:45] that message in I believe January 1st or
[9:50] January 12th
[9:52] 1964 and the event that happened was in
[9:55] December 30th
[9:57] 1963 where they was a complete blackout
[10:01] of the Moon in North America and he said
[10:04] that was a sign to the church that God
[10:08] sent out a sign and he said that means
[10:12] something and and after that days after
[10:16] I believe in January 4th the pope
[10:20] visits Israel and in in this in uh
[10:24] January 6th he goes and he goes to the
[10:26] Orthodox church and it says if you could
[10:29] look it up in in uh Google but they went
[10:31] and they they gave themself a kiss of
[10:35] fellowship and and it was showing that
[10:38] the churches went into complete darkness
[10:42] brother Bram says that Total Blackout
[10:45] shows that every single church every
[10:49] church that calls thems by a
[10:51] name has gone into blackout complete
[10:55] blackout and and and and turned their
[10:58] self away from Christ right and that
[11:02] that
[11:04] eclipse encapsulates what that was
[11:06] brother brandham he says in recognizing
[11:09] your day preached in
[11:11] 1964 he says then we see before the
[11:14] Seven Seals that hid all the Mysteries
[11:17] me not knowing what I was drawing on the
[11:19] board for the church ages I never God
[11:23] knows just by Vision I draw it out not
[11:27] knowing that God year and 6 months later
[11:30] I was going to vindicate it in the skies
[11:32] by the moon and slip across the national
[11:36] papers I did not know that I didn't know
[11:39] that there'd be a mysterious blackout in
[11:41] the moon to represent the lady OA age
[11:45] now the papers you only get six um now
[11:51] you only get six ages but it's the lady
[11:54] oia Church age um was completely blacked
[11:58] out completely and if you notice the
[12:00] spiritual application as God said it in
[12:03] heaven when I set it here on Earth I
[12:06] left a little bitty space as you see
[12:09] just a teeny little bit of light and
[12:12] that was before the very elected was to
[12:14] be called from the earth the reason I
[12:17] placed it on here um for the seventh age
[12:21] but God put it in the heavens and it was
[12:24] totally blacked out means maybe the last
[12:27] one is called from the lady a age we
[12:30] don't know there could be a sermon on it
[12:33] so brother Bram he showed that in this
[12:36] last day which is called the lady oia
[12:38] Church age whenever he drew the moon and
[12:41] he put a little light showing the
[12:43] reflection of Christ every church had
[12:46] that reflection of Christ he showed a
[12:48] little bit of light right and he said
[12:51] this is going to be the little light
[12:52] before the going away of the church that
[12:56] there was going to be a little bit of
[12:57] light but then God coming in and giving
[13:02] a total blackout of the Moon showed that
[13:05] there was no more light in this age
[13:09] brother brandham he showed that there
[13:11] was no more light that the light was not
[13:13] reflecting Jesus or the moon was not
[13:16] reflecting Jesus Christ
[13:19] anymore and the L and that's lady oia we
[13:22] know what lady oia means it's it's the
[13:25] people's rights see I I believe that the
[13:28] lady o age encapsulated every single
[13:32] church that denominated themselves now I
[13:35] just wanted by curiosity I wanted to see
[13:37] what denominate meant it means to label
[13:41] it means to name so every time a church
[13:45] would come and say this is our Doctrine
[13:48] this is what we believe this is who we
[13:50] are they put a period and they separated
[13:54] themselves from the light it's not that
[13:57] God he he said you know what I'm do away
[13:59] with lady oia but the Bible or brother
[14:01] brandham said that because of her
[14:04] actions right because of her
[14:07] actions she pushed him out of the
[14:10] door and because of her name it showed
[14:14] what her character was right that she
[14:17] was going to push him out brother Bram
[14:19] he says in the samirian church age he
[14:21] says now the church name is associated
[14:24] with the nature of the
[14:26] character now you're talking about the
[14:28] lady see a church age that had the
[14:31] Pentecostal age that had the methodists
[14:34] that had the lutherans that had all
[14:36] these
[14:37] people and her name that that's what her
[14:40] names
[14:41] were brother Bram called them
[14:43] Blasphemous
[14:45] names he said it's the nature of her
[14:47] character did you notice with Samaria
[14:50] meaning bitter and did you know each one
[14:52] of the church now it's the church name
[14:54] that has something to do with the
[14:56] character of the church
[14:59] I could say something here but I better
[15:01] not cuz you get me wrong see your name
[15:05] does too you you might not know it but
[15:08] it does oh yes you know it's numer um
[15:11] it's numerology no it's not or you say
[15:14] it's numerology no it's not when Jacob
[15:16] was born they called him Jacob which was
[15:20] supplanter but he wrestled with the
[15:22] angel and God changed his name to Israel
[15:25] a prince is that right Saul was Saul of
[15:29] Tarsus a mean fellow but when he come to
[15:32] Jesus he was called Paul Simon was a
[15:36] Simon but when he was come to Jesus he
[15:39] was called Peter a little Stone oh yes
[15:41] sir your name Associates your it has an
[15:45] impression on your character and and we
[15:48] know that in the Jewish culture in the
[15:51] Bible names were very important right I
[15:54] believe the the word uh name in Hebrew
[15:58] is sh
[16:00] which it's it's
[16:03] uh the same word used for soul which is
[16:08] uh
[16:09] Nisha so the the Jews the Hebrews the
[16:13] Israelites they knew that your name that
[16:17] their names were tied to something
[16:19] deeper than just oh yeah that's so and
[16:22] so so every time there was a character
[16:25] change or every time something happened
[16:28] sign significant in that person's life
[16:30] they would name that child they would
[16:32] name them and say you know what because
[16:35] of my sorrows because of this I'm going
[16:37] to name him this right job he was an
[16:40] Afflicted man there was people that was
[16:42] favored from God so they were named that
[16:45] person and they would walk in that
[16:48] name and here the reason I'm saying this
[16:51] is because this lady oia Church age that
[16:55] name is tied to that church right even
[16:59] to the point where they kicked Jesus out
[17:01] and now there's a completely blackout in
[17:05] the
[17:06] church brother Bram says the name Leia
[17:09] means people's rights was very common
[17:11] and was given to several cities in honor
[17:13] for Royal ladies so named and if you
[17:17] look at what what the message was to the
[17:20] lady OAS to the lady oia Church age it
[17:23] was um well I'm going to do this well
[17:27] I'm going to do that well you think
[17:29] you're this but you're really this and
[17:32] brother brandham he says Darkness this
[17:34] lady oia Church age when
[17:37] Jesus when which is the
[17:39] word in in the lady oia Church age was
[17:42] outside the church knocking at the door
[17:45] trying to get in darkness gross Darkness
[17:48] upon the people was that right preached
[17:51] that in Shalom showing that they're the
[17:54] ones that cause the darkness it's
[17:56] because of their desire brother bam said
[17:58] it was world
[17:59] worldliness and her name showed who she
[18:01] was and her actions brought the
[18:03] manifested darkness in the
[18:07] church now now um he continues on he
[18:11] says that the Pentecostal CH Church age
[18:14] is the lady oia Church age the Methodist
[18:17] Church age is the lady oia Church age
[18:20] all of these these um churches and names
[18:24] it is the lady oia brother Bram says
[18:27] we're not living in that Pentecostal age
[18:29] anymore he said we're not we're living
[18:32] in another age see we're not living in
[18:35] the Methodist age we're living in
[18:37] another age we're living on up here in
[18:41] the bright age calling out of the church
[18:44] and getting it together for the Rapture
[18:47] and that's the age that we're living to
[18:50] my honest opinion that's the
[18:54] truth now how are we in the bright age
[19:00] because every church is associated with
[19:04] this with a name yeah now how are we in
[19:07] the bride age when there has been um
[19:10] Believers that represented the bride
[19:13] from Paul's time all the way to the 21st
[19:15] 20th century but now we're in the bride
[19:19] age Paul Paul was bride the people that
[19:22] followed him they represented the bride
[19:24] and all these other people represented
[19:26] the bride but now we're in the bride age
[19:29] right now now now it's outside of this
[19:33] dark church that is no light and there
[19:36] there's a separate church now how is
[19:39] that
[19:41] possible there was something that caused
[19:43] this Darkness brother brandham says that
[19:46] that whenever the sun comes up it
[19:49] presses the
[19:51] darkness whenever there's light that
[19:53] starts coming up it presses the darkness
[19:57] to where the the the darkness gets even
[19:59] gross Darkness gets even worse what
[20:03] caused this brother brandom he says in
[20:06] Shalom he says when you see Darkness
[20:08] settling here or or here in Shalom he
[20:11] says now in the heavens above did you
[20:14] notice I'm looking on this the light the
[20:17] picture out there in Life magazine that
[20:21] the brother lives here in in this home
[20:24] has it put on his wall the triangle of
[20:26] light now it's strange that brother
[20:29] brandham called it a light because we
[20:30] know it as a
[20:32] cloud but he said that this was a light
[20:36] right now now you have to understand
[20:38] that brother brandham it was
[20:40] 1964 it was January and he's saying all
[20:44] this something is going on here right
[20:47] now to us
[20:49] maybe you you know life goes on and all
[20:51] of this but in
[20:53] 1964 something was going on
[20:56] right he said there's Darkness going on
[21:00] well how do you know because the the
[21:03] signs have been showing that the church
[21:06] has rejected Jesus
[21:08] Christ well why did they reject Jesus
[21:10] Christ because first the sun has to
[21:12] start moving up in order for the
[21:15] darkness to start pressing on to the
[21:19] people and so before December 30th you
[21:23] go all the way to the springtime a cloud
[21:27] appeared and that Cloud
[21:29] represented the fullness of the
[21:32] word where where the word was going to
[21:35] be shown the light came that was the
[21:39] rising of the sun there right so as the
[21:43] sun rose and it showed the revealed word
[21:47] the word for our day that was going to
[21:48] take us out of any denominational
[21:51] thought anything that was going to uh
[21:54] make us stuck in this world that word
[21:57] those Seven Seals was going to reveal
[21:59] everything to us yes so that light came
[22:03] up and then months after the darkness
[22:06] came right but first that sun had to
[22:10] rise first that revealed word so this is
[22:14] happening in present time in actual
[22:18] time it's happened years and years and
[22:21] years Ando ago and people might say well
[22:23] what does it apply to me well people are
[22:26] rising today yes because as that word
[22:30] has been given there's people barely
[22:33] receiving it right now there's been
[22:35] people that we say there are loved ones
[22:38] or people that we love that are out in
[22:40] the world they don't know anything about
[22:42] it but yet maybe they're catching a
[22:45] revelation of the word and as they're
[22:48] catching that Revelation they're
[22:50] stepping out of that Darkness stepping
[22:53] out of the worldism and stepping into
[22:56] the light
[22:59] amen he called it a cloud he called that
[23:03] cloud a light and it was the face of the
[23:05] Son of God and that represented the
[23:08] seals that was going to be open to bring
[23:11] back the son through the fullness of the
[23:14] word he was going to bring him back he's
[23:17] been absent this whole
[23:19] time he's been allowing all these things
[23:22] but now Shalom good morning the son is
[23:26] coming yes he was going to come and he
[23:30] was and and and it took another light
[23:32] brother Brenham says to identify him he
[23:37] says when you see Darkness settling
[23:41] Darkness just before the day we know
[23:43] that the morning star is hanging out
[23:45] yonder to introduce the coming son so
[23:48] before that sun comes he says there's a
[23:51] Morning Star right to introduce so every
[23:55] time you see that sun you're going to
[23:56] see a Morning Star and what it's doing
[23:59] it's saying Shalom right it's
[24:02] introducing the coming
[24:04] son it's it's a going between it's
[24:07] always Darkness just a few minutes
[24:09] before the day black um blackout comes
[24:13] the moon fails to shine the darkest
[24:16] before day is because the light is
[24:19] pressing the darkness but the Morning
[24:22] Star comes out and says good morning
[24:25] Shalom that's him Among Us his word
[24:28] being
[24:29] identified and it took this star to
[24:32] identify him to say hey he's here that
[24:37] we we shouldn't live below the blessings
[24:40] God has given us that we we have the
[24:45] fullness and he's the one that
[24:47] identified him brother brandham he says
[24:50] and God's provided only provided place
[24:53] of worship he says and the
[24:55] name is in the word
[24:59] because he is the word so how do you
[25:02] identify him he showed he said his name
[25:07] well what was his name it's in his word
[25:09] because he is the word amen so what is
[25:12] he then the word interpreted is the
[25:16] manifestation of the name of God no
[25:18] wonder flesh and blood has not revealed
[25:21] this to you but my Father which is in
[25:24] heaven has revealed this to you who I am
[25:27] and upon on this rock I'll build my
[25:30] place of worship and the gates of hell
[25:32] can't shake it down amen so the name it
[25:37] identifies him and what's that name he
[25:39] said that's the word
[25:43] manifested that's the word he the word
[25:46] is in the name and the word in is
[25:49] interpreted is the manifestation of the
[25:52] name of God right so every time that
[25:55] word becomes new to you when it becomes
[25:58] open to you you've seen the name you
[26:01] know who he
[26:02] is and and and it it might not sound
[26:07] like much but why are we called the
[26:09] bride yes because there was somebody
[26:12] just like John says he was the friend of
[26:14] the
[26:15] bridegroom right and he had to come and
[26:17] he had to present the bride to the
[26:20] husband right and so we are in a bright
[26:24] age because this is now the time yes
[26:28] whenever the bride and the bridegroom
[26:30] come together right and his name was
[26:33] identified and whenever the bridegroom's
[26:36] name is identified and the bride is
[26:38] coming her name has to
[26:40] change she's not going to be her maiden
[26:43] name anymore she's not going to be
[26:45] Pentecostal no more right she's not
[26:47] going to be sinner no more she's not
[26:50] going to have her Earthly name once she
[26:53] comes together with the bridegroom her
[26:55] name has to change am and it was the
[26:59] friend of the bridegroom that came and
[27:01] he said behold here is here he is and he
[27:05] revealed him to the bride and the bride
[27:07] she changed her name from the church and
[27:09] all those things to bride right right
[27:12] she changed it and what was she was
[27:15] standing in the presence of the son yes
[27:18] she was standing in the presence of the
[27:21] Lord Brother brandham he says in once
[27:26] more he says you say a name he means
[27:28] nothing then why did he change his uh
[27:31] change Abram's to Abraham why did he
[27:34] change Saul's to Paul Simon's name to
[27:38] Peter why did he change his own name why
[27:42] did he change Jacob to Israel not until
[27:45] he wrestled with the Lord not until he
[27:48] overcame but when Jesus overcome death
[27:51] Hell In The Grave the Bible said he had
[27:53] a new
[27:54] name and J when Jacob overcame and if
[27:58] the church can
[28:00] overcome she will stop saying I'm
[28:03] Methodist Baptist
[28:05] Presbyterian I believe this way I'm this
[28:08] I'm that when she can overcome her
[28:10] Creeds and the worlds that draw her in
[28:14] there she'll come back to the Bride of
[28:16] Jesus Christ Miss Jesus Christ and
[28:20] people say well you know we believe in
[28:23] the name of Jesus Christ yes but in that
[28:26] name has the word in there yes in that
[28:30] name there's more to it than just say
[28:33] Jesus because you know I was thinking
[28:36] about Paul how he was Sol of
[28:39] Tarsus he was persecuting the church he
[28:42] knew the
[28:43] word but whenever the light came to
[28:48] him he began he he he had a conception
[28:51] of what that light was he had enough
[28:54] Revelation to sayl who are you
[28:58] see he's asking for his name right and
[29:02] whenever he gave his name he said I am
[29:06] Jesus it wasn't just a name all the
[29:09] scriptures tied
[29:11] together he realized what he was
[29:14] doing he realized that every single
[29:17] thing that maybe he was taught in in in
[29:20] in with gelia and all of that had been
[29:23] tied together because now he there's a
[29:25] name attached to the word yeah that's
[29:29] that's what it is good it's just not oh
[29:32] just the name of Jesus what where is the
[29:36] Revelation where is the word where the
[29:38] life can be changed because every time
[29:41] you meet this word every time you'll
[29:43] meet this son every time you encounter
[29:47] Jesus Christ the word you've got to
[29:50] change you've got to change from the
[29:53] condition that you're in you've got to
[29:56] change from one place to another another
[29:58] because there's no way you can't
[30:02] change you know when I was thinking
[30:05] about all of this I was thinking about
[30:08] Jacob I was thinking about
[30:10] how Jacob he had a terrible issue going
[30:15] on he's been a supplanter he's been a
[30:17] deceiver his whole life yeah and now
[30:20] it's finally catching up to him right
[30:22] finally when it seems like everything is
[30:24] going right he's got his blessings he's
[30:27] got his children
[30:28] and the Lord tells him go back home and
[30:31] I'm going to bless you and he goes and
[30:34] he starts going back home but he's got a
[30:36] big problem the very person that he
[30:38] stole every single blessing before he's
[30:41] got to confront him right he's got to go
[30:45] back his name is Jacob and I I I myself
[30:50] personally I attach myself to that my
[30:53] Earthly name my Earthly position the way
[30:57] I was born and raised and everything
[31:00] that's attached to Jacob and though
[31:03] Jacob was a blessed man though though
[31:06] God loved him and even as he was going
[31:09] and if you look at chapter 32 it says
[31:11] that a host of angels went to go meet
[31:14] him he was he was a blessed man but yet
[31:18] when he came to confront his brother man
[31:22] he was having a rough time he tried to
[31:25] figure out everything and once that
[31:27] night came in in he started to think he
[31:31] started to figure out things he said you
[31:34] know what we're going to separate the
[31:36] car
[31:37] Caravans you're going to go and you know
[31:40] he had sheep goats and what have you but
[31:43] he separated them he said just in case
[31:47] these guys are killed the other ones can
[31:49] escape so he goes and he starts sending
[31:53] Caravans there of people his servants
[31:57] all of the goods and saying you know
[31:59] what this is for Esau these are presents
[32:02] let him know that this is from his
[32:04] servant Jacob and and that this is for
[32:09] him finally the last night
[32:13] comes and he sends out
[32:15] everybody and the Bible says that the
[32:18] night and he went to sleep there that
[32:22] night and he the Bible says that he
[32:24] arose
[32:26] up and he got his wife and his kids this
[32:29] the most precious people to him he said
[32:31] okay you guys are the last before me I
[32:35] need you to go over there and I need you
[32:38] to make friendly there with Esau and
[32:42] I'll meet you there and he goes and they
[32:45] they go and the Bible says that he was
[32:48] there left
[32:49] alone and in
[32:52] night and and a man came there didn't
[32:56] say an angel didn't say we we we don't
[32:58] know who it was well we do know yeah but
[33:01] the Bible says a man
[33:03] yeah and
[33:05] we the Bible doesn't say it's very vague
[33:08] there's no intention no nothing but I
[33:11] really like how brother Aaron brought it
[33:13] it was a man to come wrestle with God or
[33:16] it was a man to come wrestle with Jacob
[33:18] and it wasn't necessarily to go and
[33:20] Prevail over Jacob right I believe that
[33:24] there there was intention there with God
[33:27] yeah that Jacob this deceiver this this
[33:30] person that has supplanted and deceived
[33:32] everybody took all of his blessings with
[33:35] his own hands he says now you you've
[33:37] you've got to change yeah right you've
[33:40] got to wrestle it out and and the main
[33:42] blessing is not going to come from you
[33:45] it's not going to come from your own
[33:47] devices and you thinking about it no
[33:49] you're going to meet me face to
[33:52] face and I don't come here to just knock
[33:55] you out but I I want to rest and I want
[33:58] to see where you're
[34:00] at and it was during that time Jacob
[34:04] began to wrestle it out yeah Jacob began
[34:07] to fight for his life I I believe that's
[34:11] where the church has been for years yeah
[34:14] and this in this
[34:15] wrestle and this weeping yeah and this
[34:19] weeping towards the night right crying
[34:22] out to the Lord getting more from the
[34:24] Lord asking the Lord for a blessing
[34:28] yes
[34:30] yes and there there's a point where the
[34:34] Bible says that the day was coming yes
[34:38] and the angel they they both have two uh
[34:41] conf inner confence going on in inside
[34:43] of them if you just read it if you read
[34:46] it for face face value
[34:49] Jacob could not leave that night without
[34:52] the
[34:53] blessing he could not face the sun with
[34:57] without
[35:00] changing before that son arose a change
[35:04] had to
[35:05] happen before he he had to receive that
[35:09] son with
[35:11] gladness and here this Angel he could
[35:15] not be here when the sun revealed
[35:19] himself he couldn't he just like John
[35:22] said I have to decrease so that he may
[35:25] increase so here at the breaking of the
[35:28] day where I believe that's where we're
[35:30] at today right at the breaking of the
[35:32] day he starts being desperate with them
[35:37] and the angel says I can't be I must
[35:39] decrease so that he must increase I
[35:42] can't be here yeah he said but Jacob
[35:45] says I can't be here or I can't face the
[35:49] son without my
[35:51] blessing without my
[35:53] change because if I'm still the same
[35:56] sinner if I'm still the same Pentecostal
[36:00] right the same message believer without
[36:03] any Revelation without any true
[36:05] experience of Christ how am I going to
[36:08] greet the
[36:10] son I need I I need the angel I need
[36:14] that morning star to say good morning
[36:16] welcome him yes welcome him in so
[36:20] there's this fight between both of them
[36:23] saying I need something from you before
[36:25] you leave
[36:29] they fight and they fight and he turns
[36:32] and and there's there's a point in I
[36:35] believe in the first seal where brother
[36:37] brandham he stops referring to the
[36:39] people as a
[36:40] church he said and this this is this is
[36:44] during the opening of The Seven Seals
[36:46] right right the the son has already
[36:49] shown himself and now in the sky a
[36:53] representation of what God was going to
[36:55] do reveal himself to the people right
[36:58] and he says before all of these things
[37:01] I'm no more calling you church I'm no
[37:04] more calling you something that the that
[37:06] is a Blasphemous
[37:09] name no more something that's going to
[37:11] be just a diff different people but the
[37:14] same
[37:16] spirits but I got to call you bride yes
[37:20] and he said you're no more going to be a
[37:23] supplanter you you know what I like is
[37:25] he asked him what his name was first
[37:27] right yeah and you know what I I put my
[37:29] name
[37:30] there what's your
[37:32] name what what do they call you yeah
[37:37] well my name is
[37:38] Jacob I'm a
[37:41] sinner I I mess up all the
[37:44] time I have
[37:46] habits I have this I have
[37:49] unbelief whatever whatever our human
[37:52] nature is whatever our human struggle is
[37:56] we put it there
[37:58] we put it in that
[37:59] struggle what do they call
[38:02] you I'm mess up all the time I'm this
[38:06] I'm that I'm a
[38:08] failure put it all on that wrestling
[38:11] match put it all while you're striving
[38:15] with
[38:17] God if you truly desire something you
[38:20] put it all you don't Reserve anything
[38:23] see Jacob was used to
[38:26] reserving he was used to oh well I'll do
[38:29] this but he always had a trump up his
[38:31] sleeve he always knew how to get his
[38:34] Blessing one way or another without
[38:36] being scaved or without any scratch he
[38:39] did that to his father-in-law he did
[38:41] that to his brother to his own father he
[38:44] did that
[38:45] too now he's face to face with God now
[38:49] he's face to face with the
[38:52] word there's it's a mirror now right
[38:56] there there's no faking yeah there
[38:58] there's no going going around it what's
[39:01] your name what's your
[39:04] failures what's the things that that
[39:06] hinder you put it all on there I'm I'm
[39:11] no good I'm a sinner I'm an unbeliever
[39:13] I'm this I'm that you'll no more be
[39:16] called that no
[39:17] more you'll no more be called a failure
[39:21] you'll no more be called a deceiver a
[39:24] sinner right a just a church member
[39:28] but you will be my bride yes you will be
[39:32] my bride why is she called bride because
[39:34] she takes on his name what is his name
[39:38] it is the manifested word you take on
[39:41] the word yourself yes you are Miss word
[39:45] yes you'll no more be called Jacob you
[39:47] are
[39:49] Israel and when when he received that
[39:52] just like Saul he says Lord who are you
[39:57] yeah who are you and God didn't want to
[40:01] say I believe God revealed it to
[40:04] him the only reason I know that is
[40:08] because the Bible says when he left that
[40:11] place he says I'm going to call this
[40:13] place
[40:14] Pinel cuz I've just gone face to face
[40:17] with
[40:18] God it was just a
[40:20] man it was just a regular man but he
[40:23] knew who he was yes what's your name
[40:27] Saul said who are you Lord he says I'm
[40:30] Jesus and from that moment
[40:33] on he he gave his life for the Lord he
[40:38] had a different revelation of all the
[40:40] study and everything that he had all all
[40:43] of his
[40:45] credentials didn't matter because now he
[40:48] knew the
[40:49] Revelation he had the Revelation when he
[40:52] met the sun he met that
[40:55] light he said who are you he said you'll
[40:59] no more be called Jacob but your name is
[41:02] Israel a prince one who prevails against
[41:06] against God and over
[41:10] people and it's amazing because he
[41:13] represented all the children of
[41:17] Israel why why are we called bride why
[41:19] is this called a bride age is because
[41:22] this is the time of the
[41:24] marriage one day we'll have a marriage
[41:26] supper but this is the time when we
[41:30] unite and every single person that has
[41:33] been called bride throughout the whole
[41:35] seven Church ages are represented in
[41:39] you so that's why they can be called
[41:42] bride because there was people here to
[41:45] take the hand and once you took the hand
[41:49] your name Miss Jesus Christ Miss bride
[41:53] represented the whole seven Church
[41:55] ages Eve she was the mother of all she
[41:58] represented
[42:00] all Abraham his name was Elohim the ham
[42:04] part but Abram was the father of
[42:07] all so it mixed together and now he
[42:11] represented millions and millions and
[42:13] millions of people in one
[42:15] man he represented them and today you
[42:19] represent those that have died and gone
[42:23] on as we Unite with Christ and we get
[42:27] ready for what's next we Face a new day
[42:32] we're not living in darkness no more
[42:35] we're not living in in in other ages
[42:38] anymore we're living in the light yes
[42:41] and and as we're living in the light
[42:43] there's people that that are still
[42:45] seeing the break of a new day yes
[42:48] there's maybe still people out in
[42:49] darkness in drunkenness that still need
[42:52] something but the bride she's waking up
[42:55] yes the bride she's stepping out into
[42:58] the break of a new day and this
[43:02] word even though the the prophet has
[43:05] gone the word is still saying good
[43:07] morning yes he's saying good morning
[43:10] bride you're not a church anymore you're
[43:12] not a sinner anymore you're the Bride of
[43:14] Jesus Christ good morning well all these
[43:18] things are happening it doesn't matter
[43:20] we are in that day yes we are in another
[43:24] age it's amazing because
[43:28] in the scripture that I read previously
[43:31] he says that he passed over penuel and
[43:35] the RO a sun rose upon him and he halted
[43:38] upon his
[43:39] thigh there the Sun finally
[43:42] Rose the sun on his back and now he can
[43:46] face everything that he was afraid to
[43:49] face
[43:51] see he had a right to be scared as
[43:54] Jacob because all of his offenses
[43:57] towards his brother towards his family
[43:59] was
[44:01] Jacob so he was afraid because Jacob has
[44:05] to face his
[44:07] judgment Jacob has to face everything
[44:10] that he's gone
[44:11] through and Jacob he will not be able to
[44:14] face
[44:15] it he has to face that
[44:19] judgment that's why he was afraid and
[44:23] God had to change
[44:24] him he was a different person so it was
[44:27] no more Jacob no more schemes no more no
[44:31] more backsliding no more deceiving no
[44:34] more he was a different man his name was
[44:37] Israel a
[44:39] prince beat up limping yeah but it
[44:43] showed that was a sign that he met
[44:46] God sometimes we come in come into the
[44:50] message come into whatever with pride
[44:54] saying I know it all I know this I know
[44:56] that but we'll leave limping yes we'll
[45:00] leave understanding that God is God yes
[45:04] we'll understand that there's a greater
[45:06] thing out here yes that it it'll never
[45:09] be like everything
[45:12] else that's the one thing I I love is
[45:17] that though it seems like we're doing
[45:21] this just for ourselves and and we're
[45:23] we're getting our family yet there
[45:26] there's people
[45:27] the whole seven Church ages depending on
[45:30] the bride
[45:32] here if You' like to stand with
[45:35] me just wanted to give that out a little
[45:41] encouragement if You' like to pray as
[45:43] the um musicians would like to come
[45:47] up Heavenly
[45:50] Father lord it's such a
[45:54] honor that we were chosen for
[45:58] the great Revelation that you gave to us
[46:02] Lord even though we didn't deserve
[46:05] it when we look at our
[46:08] fleshly lives when we look at the Jacob
[46:11] part of our
[46:12] Lives yet father it was
[46:17] predestinated even before they were born
[46:19] he said the young the older Shall Serve
[46:22] the
[46:23] younger you already had it pre-planned
[46:27] before the foundation of the
[46:29] world and even though there's a part of
[46:34] unworthiness unsecure
[46:37] insecurity Lord you already had this in
[46:40] your mind father you had each and every
[46:42] person here father and as we Face a new
[46:46] year Lord we can face it with confidence
[46:50] knowing that you're with
[46:52] us that no matter what happens
[46:55] Lord you'll be
[46:58] there whatever step we make you said
[47:01] I'll be with
[47:03] you whether it's through the valleys
[47:05] through the deserts you said I will be
[47:08] there with you lord lord I just ask that
[47:11] you put that special confidence in each
[47:14] and every person as we face this new
[47:18] year maybe some facing it with trials
[47:21] facing it with certain things yet father
