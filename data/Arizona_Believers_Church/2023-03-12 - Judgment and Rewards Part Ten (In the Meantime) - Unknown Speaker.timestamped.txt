[0:00] this morning as I've already mentioned
[0:01] as we have here on this slide on
[0:03] judgment and rewards part 10. in the
[0:05] meantime this is a conclusion of a
[0:07] series that has been about crowns that
[0:09] are available to the believer to gain
[0:10] there's been a lot of things taken from
[0:12] the message of the hour to substantiate
[0:14] those rewards that are made available to
[0:16] his faithful Saints how that God is
[0:18] faithful to remember all your efforts to
[0:21] please him and all too little time is
[0:23] spent in laboring for these things and
[0:26] so we have these things very I hope very
[0:28] fresh in our minds on the the subject of
[0:29] what rewards are and the bride's
[0:31] judgment for those rewards there's no
[0:33] condemnation because you already have
[0:35] the gift there's no judgment for eternal
[0:37] life because you already have that by
[0:38] the baptism of the Holy Ghost but it's
[0:40] your life being examined in that
[0:42] sunlight if as kind of as by fire to
[0:45] determine your reward in second
[0:47] Corinthians chapter 5 verses 9 to 10
[0:49] we're just going to lay some Foundation
[0:51] this morning on the general judgment for
[0:54] rewards it says wherefore we labor that
[0:56] whether present or absent we may be
[0:58] accepted of him he's saying saying that
[1:00] I labor so I can be pleasing I want to
[1:03] please him I want my efforts to be
[1:05] pleasing to him I want my work and my
[1:07] labor as a Son of God and as a minister
[1:09] whatever capacity God may use you in and
[1:12] that you're called to I wanted to please
[1:14] him and the pleasing is so relevant
[1:17] because it's not just a moment of
[1:18] satisfaction for God but he says for we
[1:21] must all appear before the bhima that
[1:24] word there's bema the Judgment seat of
[1:26] Christ it gives this image of a throne a
[1:28] raised place the Judgment seat of Christ
[1:30] that everyone may receive the things
[1:33] done in his body receive proportionally
[1:36] or receive something related to what he
[1:39] has done in his body in his flesh in his
[1:42] life according to that he have done
[1:44] whether it be good or bad so we know
[1:47] that one day the elect will be gathered
[1:48] together to Christ all the elect all the
[1:50] bride through all ages will be gathered
[1:52] together to Christ and there will be the
[1:55] giving of crowns the giving of rewards
[1:57] and those are the words that brother
[1:58] Branham uses and so this judgment day of
[2:00] Christ we talked about this is the Day
[2:02] of Reckoning where we're held
[2:03] accountable for our responsibility and
[2:05] we have to answer for what we did with
[2:07] what God gave us brother Branham saying
[2:09] in many different places one day I'll
[2:11] have to answer one day I'll have to
[2:12] answer one day I'll have to answer and
[2:14] we realize that couldn't be white Throne
[2:16] judgment because at White Throne he's
[2:17] not answering so there is a time where
[2:19] we answer back to God and this is that
[2:21] judgment seat of Christ Paul says it in
[2:23] Romans chapter 14 for we shall all stand
[2:26] before the Judgment seat of Christ and
[2:28] he says so that every one of us shall
[2:30] give account of himself to God he's
[2:33] going to answer of his Works to God the
[2:36] comforting thing is is it when the fire
[2:38] in that image and Paul uses the image of
[2:41] a fire we can be comforted in knowing
[2:43] that anything we did that was wrong or
[2:45] any mistakes we made any would pay or
[2:47] stubble works of the flesh are going to
[2:48] be burnt up so you're not going to have
[2:50] to answer for lies you're not going to
[2:51] have to explain bad conduct you're not
[2:53] gonna have to explain why you did this
[2:54] to that person why you did that to the
[2:55] person that's all covered by the blood
[2:57] what remains is what you did for Christ
[2:59] this lasting Legacy of the things that
[3:02] you did for him your characters we
[3:04] referred to character development that
[3:06] you take with you and there's so many
[3:08] different places in scripture a dozen or
[3:11] so scriptures we could have used over
[3:12] the last few weeks that we haven't used
[3:13] we're in Proverbs it says and he shall
[3:16] shall he not render to every man
[3:18] according to his Works will he not give
[3:20] according to man's works it says in
[3:22] Jeremiah that I search the heart I tried
[3:24] the Reigns The Lord does to give every
[3:26] man according to his ways and according
[3:28] to the fruit of his doings this is a
[3:30] principle that not only applies in this
[3:32] life in the law of the Harvest but it
[3:33] applies most perfectly even at the
[3:36] Judgment seat of Christ where we're
[3:38] going to get the good from all the good
[3:40] that we did
[3:41] because the scripture does speak of the
[3:43] Paradox where the wicked prosper and the
[3:45] righteous suffer and say well it doesn't
[3:47] seem like he's getting what his he
[3:48] deserves but we're going to get what we
[3:49] deserve one day in the recognition the
[3:52] praise and the honor and glory for all
[3:53] that we do for Christ
[3:55] and it says in Revelations chapter 22
[3:57] verse 12 and behold I come quickly and
[4:01] my reward is with me
[4:03] as even the Lord said unto Abraham in
[4:06] Genesis chapter 15 I am thy shield and
[4:09] thy exceeding great reward there's a
[4:12] truth to this coming and this revealing
[4:14] of himself where he his reward is with
[4:17] them but then he is also our reward he
[4:19] is who we are first rewarded with and so
[4:21] there's a beautiful image of him being
[4:23] our reward because my reward is with me
[4:25] to give every man according as his work
[4:28] shall be that's even in the summation of
[4:31] it what what is your work what's the
[4:32] body of work that you're presenting and
[4:34] I have a reward for those for everyone
[4:37] that stands before me there'll be a war
[4:38] reward according to his work whatever it
[4:41] shall be
[4:43] and now if you'll turn your Bibles to
[4:45] first Thessalonians chapter 4
[4:47] as we're going to be covering a lot of
[4:49] ground today the Judgment seat of Christ
[4:51] as it's referred to in Corinthians and
[4:53] Romans and these different places where
[4:55] we will not be ashamed before him at his
[4:57] coming it is after the change of our
[4:59] body or that first resurrection or the
[5:01] resurrection of the dead and the change
[5:03] of the living
[5:04] it's in that season after that change
[5:06] and before the Millennium that we have
[5:08] the wedding supper it's during that time
[5:10] that brother random refers to the giving
[5:11] of crowns it's during that time that
[5:13] were gathered to him it's in that day of
[5:15] the Lord in which we're our works are
[5:17] going to be examined and we see in first
[5:19] Thessalonians chapter 4 verses 16 to 17
[5:21] for the Lord himself shall descend from
[5:24] heaven with a shout with the voice of
[5:26] the Archangel with the Trump of God and
[5:28] the dead in Christ shall rise first now
[5:31] we are taught that this is the order of
[5:32] this great Rapture that will take place
[5:34] in the last days this is the order of
[5:37] the Rapture that takes place in our day
[5:39] then we which are alive and remain shall
[5:41] be caught up together with them in the
[5:43] clouds to meet the Lord in the air and
[5:45] so shall ever we ever be with the Lord
[5:49] now we see just such significant
[5:51] scriptural events they don't all happen
[5:52] at one time but there is going to be a
[5:56] the Lord himself shall descend with the
[5:58] Shout with the voice and with the Trump
[6:00] the shout is the Lord's a shout of
[6:02] commanders the stimulating crime to
[6:05] gather the bride to himself it is the
[6:07] living bread of life bringing forth the
[6:09] bride and we know that the shout is a
[6:12] messenger with a message to gather God's
[6:15] bride together to Christ the word this
[6:18] is where it's transpiring this is what
[6:19] we're receiving today under the revealed
[6:22] word and under the revelation of Jesus
[6:24] Christ it is him Gathering that Gentile
[6:26] bride to himself making himself known in
[6:29] the fullness of his word and and these
[6:31] uh and when that happens we're gathered
[6:34] together at the climax of all these
[6:36] events is a change of our body to meet
[6:38] the Lord in the air and it's at that
[6:40] meeting in the air when the rewards come
[6:42] I want you to keep that in mind it's at
[6:45] that meeting there uh after that season
[6:47] or in that season in this process of the
[6:49] first resurrection that these rewards
[6:51] are going to come but it's this shout we
[6:53] know in Revelations 18 there's a voice
[6:55] that says come out of her my people that
[6:57] you being up partakers of her plagues so
[7:00] this message which calls us out is
[7:02] preserving Us in the end time for these
[7:04] great promises and it's also saving us
[7:07] from the judgments that are to come and
[7:10] in Matthew chapter 25 verse 6 it says at
[7:12] midnight as it gives the parable of the
[7:13] wise and foolish virgins it says and at
[7:15] midnight there was a cry made behold the
[7:18] bridegroom cometh go you out to meet him
[7:21] so this cry announces the bridegrooms
[7:24] coming this is that is stimulating cry
[7:27] it's an order or command uh specifically
[7:30] a stimulating crime that you signal for
[7:32] action it's the same word that's used
[7:33] and there shall be a shout given it's
[7:36] the message that's stimulating cry that
[7:38] gives a command for Action what is it
[7:40] behold the bridegroom cometh go you out
[7:42] to meet him that cometh speaks of a
[7:45] person's arrival that means to appear to
[7:47] come and to be and he shall arise and
[7:49] when he does you want to run out to meet
[7:51] him you want to meet him when he's risen
[7:53] when he's making his appearing and he
[7:55] says anybody to him cometh go you out to
[7:58] meet him
[7:59] and so the Midnight Cry is a command
[8:01] it's not just oh he's here or he's
[8:04] coming but it puts the bride into action
[8:06] to go out and to meet him which is to go
[8:08] out to depart to him
[8:12] and so if I could say this the message
[8:14] Reveals His descending
[8:17] when he realizing brother Brandon
[8:18] preaches the Rapture message Everything
[8:19] Changes where he's he's been very very
[8:22] definitive and it should clear things up
[8:23] from souls in prison to the preaching of
[8:25] the seals and all the things that he
[8:26] says that this is the things the very
[8:28] things he's been looking at that the
[8:30] Lord himself has descended with the book
[8:32] open revealing himself spiritually to
[8:34] his elect and so this coming or this
[8:37] revealing is for a union
[8:39] right it's for the the wedding to take
[8:40] place it's for the United which is not
[8:43] had not yet happened in Prior ages the
[8:45] union of the bridegroom to his bride and
[8:48] not just so we can say that we're
[8:49] married and got a ring but for for a
[8:51] translation let it draw the rest of them
[8:53] from the grave and we go in a Rapture so
[8:55] it's in the climax of The Rapture that
[8:57] we're going to be changed
[8:59] changed in a moment in in our atoms and
[9:03] then gather to the wedding supper in the
[9:05] sky as we use those terminologies and to
[9:08] the Judgment seat of Christ
[9:10] and if I could say this just to maybe
[9:13] give vent to some of the things I'm
[9:15] studying
[9:16] that there there has been such a
[9:19] dichotomy expressed Between Heaven and
[9:22] Earth
[9:23] to where Earth is the bad place it is
[9:26] where evil is and then all we're longing
[9:28] to do is to one day disassociate from
[9:30] Earth and just go live in heaven and to
[9:32] view the two is completely separate and
[9:34] you want to you want to avoid hell and
[9:35] you want to make it to Heaven and Earth
[9:37] is just that Proving Grounds to
[9:38] determine which place you go but we're
[9:41] going to come back to earth one day
[9:43] and so there's something to realize even
[9:46] our time here on Earth matters so much
[9:48] to God because it's a spoken word
[9:51] attribute of his original creation
[9:53] and in all our longing to go home what
[9:55] we don't realize is there's just going
[9:57] to be a temporary departure from here
[9:58] just to come right back to it even in a
[10:01] way that we can say this is home
[10:03] and there's just a process that it's
[10:05] entered into itself to put into the
[10:07] condition that it'll be for eternity
[10:09] and so we will go we will be gathered
[10:11] together to him to meet him in the air
[10:13] and we see even what the things that are
[10:15] going to unfold even to bring us back to
[10:16] that eighth day but my title is in the
[10:18] meantime
[10:20] that means that's when you're if I could
[10:23] say this way considering what has
[10:24] happened the the events that have
[10:26] transpired in our day whether we're
[10:28] looking at first Thessalonians 4 uh Luke
[10:30] 17 30. Revelations 10 1. we can see all
[10:32] these things that have happened today uh
[10:35] and what has happened and what will be
[10:37] in light of the fact that one day I am
[10:39] going to have to stand before the
[10:40] Judgment seat of Christ and I believe
[10:42] this theme has already been very very
[10:44] clear that in all the places that Paul
[10:45] is speaking about Behavior he refers to
[10:48] that you may be found unto praise honor
[10:50] and Glory that we not be ashamed before
[10:52] him at his appearing and that we can
[10:54] have boldness in that day of judgment
[10:55] there's all these things that he says to
[10:57] give character give a little bit of
[10:59] color and context our conduct here say
[11:02] oh well we all got the Holy Ghost we're
[11:03] all just kind of waiting and doing a
[11:05] bunch of pandemics and economic Cycles
[11:07] until the last Soul comes in and then we
[11:09] can all get out of here wrong Viewpoint
[11:11] right wrong Viewpoint there's uh there
[11:14] if in light of what has been and what
[11:16] will be especially beyond that change of
[11:18] our body how should we live
[11:21] what ought our vision to be to the
[11:23] phrase in the meantime means the time
[11:24] between two things
[11:26] or the time before something happens and
[11:29] so being sealed as we are and knowing
[11:32] one day that we'll have to answer to him
[11:33] as we will what do we do in the meantime
[11:37] how ought we to live in the meantime
[11:40] I'd like you to look again at Hebrews
[11:42] chapter 10 we're going to walk through
[11:43] verses 30 to 39 we'll be jumping in and
[11:46] out of it as we go hopefully we'll make
[11:47] a little bit better time
[11:49] but this is a scripture that speaks to
[11:51] this concept of judgment and Rewards
[11:54] and I believe provides us a framework
[11:59] to address the mean time
[12:01] for we know him that hath said Hebrews
[12:03] chapter 10 verses 30 to 39 so I've noted
[12:05] that we'll be going all the way to verse
[12:07] 39. we'll jump out of this a few times
[12:09] to refer to other scriptures for we know
[12:11] him that hath said Vengeance belongeth
[12:14] unto me
[12:15] I will recompense meaning I will repay I
[12:19] will re-render I will reward this is a
[12:21] character of God he says and again the
[12:24] Lord shall judge his people
[12:27] now Paul is bringing judgment and
[12:29] rewards into view
[12:31] and there is a Vengeance that's going to
[12:33] take place on the wicked there is a
[12:36] reward that we could say that they have
[12:38] but also God will recompense and reward
[12:41] his people and He will avenge his elect
[12:43] he will vindicate them he will judge
[12:45] them but Paul is bringing the idea and
[12:47] as we read this you'll see that it
[12:49] certainly uh unfolds this way he's
[12:52] saying that the Lord rewards and the
[12:55] Lord will judge and so he can even say
[12:57] the Lord is going to judge his people he
[12:59] judgeth among the gods he is there as an
[13:02] authority that's going to judge among
[13:04] his people to determine rewards so Paul
[13:07] is bringing rewards and judgment into
[13:09] view
[13:09] and then he in the next chapter Hebrews
[13:12] chapter 11 verses 24 to 26 by faith
[13:15] Moses when he was come to years and I'm
[13:18] using this to give
[13:20] um some more understanding to when he
[13:21] says I will recompense the Lord shall
[13:23] judge his people and He will reward he
[13:25] will recompense he's going to use in the
[13:27] next two chapters an example of how that
[13:30] things happened in this life and there
[13:32] there's a reward for it by faith Moses
[13:34] when he was come to years refused to be
[13:36] called the son of Pharaoh's daughter
[13:38] choosing rather to suffer Affliction
[13:40] with the people of God than to enjoy the
[13:43] pleasures of sin for a season
[13:46] uh very uh weighty very heavy sentence
[13:49] there in verse 25 he would rather suffer
[13:51] in this life if it be just for a season
[13:54] not
[13:56] worrying about the pleasures that he
[13:59] could have achieved in this life so he's
[14:00] bringing himself under subjection to the
[14:02] will of God
[14:04] in verse 26 is what gives him this
[14:06] motivation esteeming the reproach of
[14:08] Christ greater riches than the treasures
[14:11] in Egypt so
[14:13] just the reproach meant more to him than
[14:16] anything the world could offer him
[14:19] and and so what the world could offer he
[14:21] says look I'd rather be uh Associated
[14:23] and and be reproached with the people of
[14:25] God than to have everything you can give
[14:27] me and that's enough and
[14:29] it says for he had respect unto the
[14:33] recompense of the reward
[14:35] the price that he was paying pelled in
[14:38] comparison to what it would purchase
[14:40] the suffering with the with the
[14:42] reproaches of Christ where there was
[14:45] greater Treasures in it it had greater
[14:46] purchasing power for he had respect he
[14:50] appreciated he valued the recompense of
[14:53] the reward what he stood to gain the
[14:55] value of the reward his brother Matt
[14:56] says uh far too little time is spent
[14:58] laboring for the rewards of God we don't
[15:00] esteem it and respect it enough we don't
[15:03] value it enough and and this is coming
[15:05] back to Moses's attitude he's saying he
[15:07] knew the reward was coming so whatever
[15:09] he did in this life he considered it
[15:12] purchasing power and he considered it
[15:14] equity for the rewards that were to come
[15:17] and he and it's even to be said that man
[15:19] what I have to pay in light of what I
[15:21] get small price
[15:23] that's one way we ought to think about
[15:24] him then it says in Hebrews chapter 12
[15:26] verse 2 looking unto Jesus the author
[15:28] and finisher the Perfecter the completer
[15:31] of our faith so there is a beginning and
[15:33] there ought to be a finishing who for
[15:35] the joy that was set before him endured
[15:38] the cross so it was what is after the
[15:41] cross that he was looking to he wasn't
[15:43] looking to the few days of fun that he
[15:46] had with the disciples
[15:47] um it wasn't just the meal that he had
[15:49] before he was put on trial then
[15:51] crucified it's what comes after the
[15:54] cross and he was able to endure the
[15:56] cross in light of what would come after
[15:58] the cross
[15:59] so he could despise the shame before the
[16:02] cross and suffer the cross because he
[16:04] knew he'd be sitting down at the right
[16:06] hand of the Throne of God
[16:09] so in both instances Paul is using Moses
[16:12] and now Jesus Christ to show that the
[16:15] reward that was to come inspired them
[16:18] that there was a promise of a reward
[16:19] that comforted them there was the
[16:21] promise of a reward that stirred him up
[16:22] that in the dark moments in the Deep
[16:24] trials Moses knew that there was a
[16:26] reward there was going to be a payoff
[16:27] that for Christ he knew this life it
[16:30] paled in comparison to the glory that he
[16:32] would not only have with the father but
[16:34] that would be shared with you
[16:37] and these things became inspiration I
[16:39] want you to be able to recognize when he
[16:41] says I will reward I will recompense
[16:43] when the Lord judges his people he
[16:45] amplifies that with Moses he amplifies
[16:47] it with Christ
[16:49] and so verse 31 as we come back to
[16:51] Hebrews chapter 10 verse 31.
[16:57] he says it is a fearful thing to fall
[16:59] into the hands of the Living God
[17:02] he is just sad that the Lord shall judge
[17:04] his people and so now as he kind of
[17:06] gives us this perspective he says and it
[17:07] is a fearful thing to fall into the
[17:10] hands of a living God to fall under his
[17:12] displeasure
[17:13] to fall into the hands of living God
[17:14] means too it is a fearful thing to
[17:17] displease him
[17:19] it's not merely just carrying with it
[17:20] the
[17:21] uh the idea that oh you're going to be
[17:23] punished you're going to be judged but
[17:24] if we're going the Lord is a rewarder
[17:27] and we're going to be God is going to
[17:28] judge his people and it ought to be and
[17:30] it is a reverential thing that we would
[17:33] not displease him
[17:35] the Lord shall judge his people in other
[17:37] words Paul is saying this judgment is to
[17:39] be respected there should be a reverence
[17:42] for this time there is this that we
[17:44] ought to have this Consciousness that
[17:45] the Lord is a rewarder and he will judge
[17:47] his people and it and and it's a fearful
[17:49] thing to know that I could stand before
[17:51] him who's redeemed me who gives me this
[17:54] this blessed Holy Ghost who's done all
[17:55] these great things for me it's a fearful
[17:58] thing that I would fall into his hands
[18:00] and displease him
[18:02] so Paul Paul then
[18:05] as we go to verse 32
[18:07] he both Comforts and encourages them
[18:10] with respect to the meantime
[18:13] in other words we're gonna God's Gonna
[18:15] judge his people and it's a fearful
[18:17] thing that we would displease him and so
[18:19] he's going to both Comfort them and
[18:21] encourage them with respect to the
[18:22] meantime because now if if they hadn't
[18:24] known before and say hey did you know
[18:26] even though you're filled the Holy Ghost
[18:27] you're gonna have to stand before Christ
[18:29] one day and he's going to examine you
[18:30] for reward and we might be like oh oh
[18:33] oops right and Paul says well but I
[18:37] don't want you to give up now and say
[18:38] man it's way too late in the game for me
[18:39] to even start trying I might as well
[18:40] just give up he he Comforts them about
[18:43] that moment and he's encouraging them
[18:46] he says but
[18:48] call to remember it's the former days in
[18:50] which after ye were illuminated or
[18:52] quickened after you came to the
[18:54] knowledge of this truth he endured a
[18:55] great fight of afflictions
[18:58] and what does he talk what is he wanting
[18:59] him to think about God will judge his
[19:01] people he will recompense if you've
[19:03] suffered he'll pay you
[19:05] and and going forward in the meantime be
[19:08] conscious of this but also remember
[19:09] these are things that you have done
[19:11] these are things that God has noticed
[19:13] these the fight of afflictions partly
[19:15] whilst you were made of gazing stock
[19:16] both by reproaches and afflictions and
[19:20] partly while she became Companions of
[19:22] them that were so used so you yourself
[19:24] suffered reproaches and afflictions
[19:26] or you ministered to those who were
[19:30] in some ways maybe that's the that's the
[19:31] cycle that we can always be on
[19:34] we're either helping somebody who's
[19:35] Afflicted or we're being Afflicted and
[19:38] maybe our afflictions ought to teach us
[19:39] how to deal with the afflicted
[19:41] and he says and for ye have compassion
[19:44] of me and my bonds and took joyfully the
[19:46] spoiling of your goods you gave of
[19:47] yourself you opened yourselves up you
[19:48] served you ministered not only have you
[19:50] endured the fight of afflictions and
[19:52] been made a gazing stock by reproaches
[19:54] and afflictions you were a commit
[19:55] companion to those who were fighting
[19:57] afflictions and became a gazing stock by
[19:59] reproaches and afflictions and he says
[20:01] and you had compassion to me in my
[20:03] situation
[20:04] and took joyfully the giving of yourself
[20:07] the giving of your resources and your
[20:09] assets the giving of your goods to
[20:11] support me and as they gave they were
[20:13] conscious of what knowing in yourselves
[20:16] that you have in heaven a better and an
[20:19] enduring substance this pertains to our
[20:22] inheritance this pertains to our reward
[20:24] which will come in the Hereafter these
[20:26] are the things that we stand to receive
[20:27] we're not waiting to get eternal life
[20:29] after the bodies change we're not
[20:31] waiting to get the Holy Ghost after the
[20:33] body changed but there are crowns to be
[20:34] gained there's rewards to be won and
[20:36] he's saying in heaven you have a better
[20:38] and an enduring substance you've spoiled
[20:40] your goods here for the cause of Christ
[20:42] but there's only something uh
[20:44] proportional being gathered laying up
[20:46] Treasures in Heaven that is a more
[20:48] enduring substance that rust cannot
[20:50] corrupt and the moth cannot destroy that
[20:53] no man can still that's been gathered
[20:55] into heaven
[20:57] and Paul is recognizing to them
[21:00] that any labor without a reward is
[21:03] bondage
[21:04] and that any labor without without
[21:06] enjoying the fruits of it is a burden or
[21:09] a strain
[21:10] that if we labor and do not enjoy the
[21:12] fruits the Bible is very clear that
[21:13] that's burdensome if we labor and we do
[21:15] not receive the rewards of it that's
[21:17] bondage God recognize it there's a
[21:19] there's a principle in human nature even
[21:22] in Ecclesiastes it's good for a man to
[21:24] to work and enjoy the fruits of his
[21:26] labor in other words it's bad for a man
[21:28] to work Time After Time After Time and
[21:30] not get to enjoy the fruits of his labor
[21:32] the very reward for the one that sows is
[21:35] the Harvest the sower uh has the reward
[21:39] of the fruit of the seed that he sows
[21:42] and so it's the fruit that's going to
[21:44] come up after this laborious process
[21:46] that is his reward I labor i i a plant I
[21:49] water I grow I I fight with the ground I
[21:52] do all these things to cultivate and his
[21:54] reward is to enjoy the fruits of his
[21:56] labor if not it's servitude
[21:59] right if there wasn't payment if there
[22:01] wasn't reward if there wasn't something
[22:02] given then it is merely bondage and a
[22:04] strain and Paul's recognizing that
[22:08] so verse 35 he says cast not away
[22:10] therefore your confidence which hath
[22:12] great recompense of reward
[22:17] it speaks of that word recompense of
[22:19] reward it's payment of wages due
[22:22] cast not away therefore your confidence
[22:24] which have great recompense of reward
[22:26] brother Brown says the recompense of God
[22:28] is too lightly esteemed
[22:30] Paul may very well be saying in such a
[22:32] way to say you don't esteem the
[22:35] recompense of God more enough that it
[22:37] recompense or those Eternal rewards of
[22:39] God are too lightly valued
[22:42] it's a fearful thing to fall into the
[22:43] hands of living God in other words you
[22:45] don't esteem the recompense of God
[22:46] enough you don't think enough about how
[22:49] awful it would be to displease them or
[22:51] how how much you ought to uh you want to
[22:55] present things to him that he's happy
[22:57] with if I could put it that way you just
[22:58] don't want to let them down
[23:00] there's so many different translations I
[23:01] read I want to read just from a couple
[23:03] other places this phrase cast not away
[23:06] therefore your confidence which hath
[23:07] great recompense of reward do not
[23:10] therefore fling away your Fearless
[23:12] confidence for it has a glorious and
[23:14] great reward
[23:15] notice the forward-looking future
[23:17] looking uh concept of whatever my
[23:20] confidence is in the days of My Flesh
[23:22] there's a great recompense for it what
[23:24] was for Moses there was for Christ
[23:27] in the living Bible do not let this
[23:29] happy trust that's that Fearless
[23:31] confidence this happy trust in the Lord
[23:32] die away no matter what happens remember
[23:35] your reward
[23:37] Paul is intentionally using a language
[23:39] to say that what you suffer here what
[23:42] you labor and hear what you do here we
[23:45] ought to never trivialize and keep your
[23:47] confidence up keep your commitment up
[23:49] your fortitude up do what you know you
[23:51] ought to do because God is a rewarder
[23:54] and that we ought to esteem it we ought
[23:56] to recognize it's a fearful thing to
[23:57] displease him and that the recompense of
[23:59] God is too lightly esteemed he's
[24:01] presenting that before us and he's
[24:02] saying then cash not therefore away your
[24:04] confidence which is your freedom
[24:08] it's not just necessarily A boldness or
[24:11] maybe a disposition that may be confused
[24:13] for arrogance but it's really speaking
[24:15] about a liberty to act and live as you
[24:17] ought
[24:17] cast not away therefore your Liberty
[24:21] cast not Therefore your your freedom to
[24:23] do as you ought I I don't be
[24:26] unrestrained in living for him
[24:29] that's where so it's you've been set
[24:31] free you've been liberated your sons and
[24:32] daughters of God you are not Bond
[24:34] servants you are not orphans trying to
[24:36] win God's favor you are not uh Beggars
[24:39] at the foot of the cross you are his
[24:41] children that he has this whole Plan of
[24:43] Redemption was for you they in
[24:45] everything that he's done we say oh and
[24:47] everything we see Christ well you only
[24:49] see a Christ because he wanted to have a
[24:51] bride you only see a Christ because he's
[24:53] a savior and he wanted to save somebody
[24:55] so if there's a Christ there has to be a
[24:58] redeemed that Christ redeems they said
[25:01] oh I see a redeemer in every verse I see
[25:03] a messiah in every verse if there was
[25:05] never a you the Christ means nothing the
[25:08] Redeemer means nothing
[25:11] and so this confidence is your freedom
[25:14] to live unrestrained for him to be at
[25:17] Liberty to please him to serve him with
[25:19] everything that is in US cast not there
[25:21] far away your freedom
[25:23] he's teaching us and elsewhere to to not
[25:26] use our freedom for the wrong things
[25:28] why because in this Liberty that we have
[25:30] in Christ why not use it for the good
[25:34] for and then verse 36 again I believe
[25:36] this is just emphasizing this all the
[25:38] more for you have need of patience
[25:40] that after you've done the will of God
[25:42] you might receive the promise it's not
[25:44] the Holy Ghost
[25:47] it's the promise of the reward
[25:50] the promise of recompense
[25:52] the things he uses Jesus and Moses as an
[25:54] example of the next chapter he's going
[25:56] to use uh the the the the faith and he's
[26:00] going to use this these examples that we
[26:02] can see in these
[26:03] uh and these in Moses and Jesus that the
[26:07] reward meant something to them
[26:09] so he says you have need of patience
[26:10] just like Moses said just like Christ
[26:12] had that you might receive the reward
[26:14] the recompense
[26:15] in James chapter 1 verses two to four my
[26:17] brother counted all joy notice how
[26:19] parallel this is to what Paul is
[26:21] teaching when you fall into diverse
[26:22] Temptations this could be used of the
[26:25] reproaches and the afflictions
[26:27] and if you say no that's Temptations and
[26:30] I've got a lot of them and I'm counting
[26:31] it all joy uh it assumes the resistance
[26:34] there too
[26:35] it says brother count it all joy when
[26:37] you fall into diverse Temptations
[26:38] knowing this that the trying of your
[26:39] faith worketh patience
[26:41] and remember it's that Faith which is
[26:43] more precious than gold and Peter said
[26:45] even the the faith is more precious than
[26:48] gold and the trying of it is more
[26:49] precious than gold
[26:51] it says but let patients have her
[26:53] perfect work that you may be perfect and
[26:55] entire wanting nothing I hope that the
[26:58] sermon on character development gives us
[26:59] a little bit more context this is a full
[27:02] age
[27:03] and it's even saying let it have its
[27:05] perfect work there's a yielding to this
[27:07] then that I can get in the way of it I
[27:09] can stunt the maturity and the growth of
[27:11] this word there's things I can do that
[27:13] can ask you the manifestation and the
[27:16] expression that there ought to be of
[27:17] this life that's inside of me I let it
[27:19] have its perfect work that you may be
[27:20] perfect an entire lacking nothing for
[27:23] completeness
[27:24] that means if there's a potential I mean
[27:26] it
[27:27] if there's something that I can earn as
[27:29] John said a full reward a full
[27:32] inheritance legal possession in other
[27:34] words let patience have the perfect work
[27:36] and if you yield and let patients have a
[27:38] perfect work in you then this process of
[27:40] character development this process of
[27:42] resisting temptation this process of
[27:44] suffering is working for you a greater
[27:47] weight of glory in that day that you
[27:50] receive your acknowledgment and your
[27:52] Commendation from the Lord
[27:55] let it have its perfect work that you
[27:57] may be perfect an entire one to nothing
[27:59] I'm going to leave nothing behind
[28:02] he have need of patience Paul is saying
[28:04] the Believers already illuminated It's
[28:05] Quickly quickened the soul has been
[28:07] sealed but he's saying there's more to
[28:09] labor for
[28:11] there's more to look for to gain in your
[28:13] life that yes as the Son of God I'm not
[28:15] born a fully mature man on the day that
[28:17] I received the Holy Ghost I'm I'm
[28:19] positionally placed in the body of
[28:20] Christ as a son yes but now I've got to
[28:23] grow to maturity
[28:25] and let patients have a perfect work for
[28:27] you have need of patience that after
[28:28] you've done the will of God that that
[28:30] doing the will of God then speaks to my
[28:32] life's ambition
[28:34] I know the will of God for me I want to
[28:36] I want to do the things that please him
[28:38] that you might receive the promise
[28:40] quickly I just want to reference I just
[28:42] allude to it I don't have the side here
[28:43] but in Matthew Chapter 13 where he gives
[28:46] the Jesus gives the parable of the sower
[28:47] and the word seed fell on different
[28:49] grounds different types of ground in
[28:51] different conditions and one is it's
[28:53] good seed and ground that otherwise
[28:55] would have been good ground but the
[28:56] ground the other things in the ground
[28:57] choked it
[28:59] and it didn't it did not bring forth
[29:01] fruit unto perfection
[29:03] but then Jesus refers to the good ground
[29:06] and in this good ground the word is sown
[29:08] and you find this in verse a then also
[29:10] in verse 13. and in that good ground is
[29:13] the word which is sowed and in that
[29:15] ground it brings forth what some 100
[29:17] fold some 60-fold some 30-fold the
[29:21] ground the good ground with good seed
[29:24] brought forth to different measures
[29:26] and and you can find a great principle
[29:29] this in the Old Testament and what these
[29:30] measures would meant and so it speaks to
[29:32] varying degrees of fruitfulness it
[29:35] speaks to varying degrees of development
[29:37] and and the yield that one ought to
[29:39] bring same ground same word different
[29:42] yields we're all good ground and we're
[29:45] all feeding on good word then what I
[29:47] want to do is Avail myself to the
[29:49] process I'm just going to take Paul's
[29:50] word for it I have need of patience that
[29:52] after I've done the will of God I might
[29:54] receive the promise I'm going to take
[29:55] James word for it that I have need of
[29:57] patience to let patience do its perfect
[29:59] work that I may be perfect and entire
[30:01] wanting nothing that I should bring
[30:03] forth and all the young people said uh
[30:06] handy right bring forth a hundred fold
[30:10] that's what ought to happen is I want to
[30:12] bring forth the hundred yeah as they as
[30:14] the song was brother Philip you might
[30:15] know it a 99 and a half just won't do
[30:18] that's what I'm striving for trying to
[30:20] make a hundred that I wanted I want it
[30:22] all I don't want to leave anything
[30:23] behind
[30:26] it is it Pokemon where it's catch em all
[30:28] or something like that is that the
[30:29] phrase somebody has a bumper sticker or
[30:31] a tattoo of that uh did you want to have
[30:34] that kind of ambition and that mindset I
[30:35] want to get them all
[30:38] and then he says then bring us right
[30:40] bring us right back in to verses 30 to
[30:44] 31.
[30:46] the Lord will recompense the Lord will
[30:47] judge his people it's going to be a
[30:48] fearful thing to stand before the in the
[30:50] hands of the Living God so it kind of
[30:51] steps away and says but listen you're
[30:53] doing good look at all the things you've
[30:54] done keep it up don't Cast Away your
[30:56] confidence keep doing what you're doing
[30:57] you're doing the right things because
[30:58] what you need to do is to endure you
[31:00] need to be patient you need to be
[31:01] persevering so that you continue to do
[31:03] the will of God and receive the promises
[31:05] that I'm talking about and so he brings
[31:07] it right back into the rewards for yet a
[31:09] little while and he that shall come will
[31:10] come and will not Tarry
[31:12] a judgment time where Works will be
[31:14] examined
[31:15] a time when the Lord will judge his
[31:17] people and recompense
[31:19] Paul says in First Corinthians chapter 4
[31:20] verse 5 therefore judge nothing before
[31:22] the time until the Lord come who will
[31:24] both bring to light the hidden things of
[31:26] darkness and will make manifest the
[31:27] councils of the heart
[31:29] and then shall every man have Praise of
[31:31] God
[31:32] this speaks of a time and examining time
[31:34] that we should judge nothing before it's
[31:37] times you should not look in a field uh
[31:39] if you're looking at any field we want
[31:41] to believe that it's good ground with
[31:43] good seed and that our objective even
[31:45] with our children and maybe objective in
[31:47] Ministry is to never question the
[31:49] quality of the ground and always preach
[31:52] good seed
[31:53] so you got good ground you got good seed
[31:56] and and therefore you'd have some sort
[31:58] of stewardship to see that the ground is
[31:59] free of those things that would choke
[32:01] out the life and keep it from bringing a
[32:02] hundredfold but don't judge it before
[32:04] it's time don't say oh you're just a
[32:07] bunch of 30 percenters you're lousy no
[32:08] good 30 percenters you're leaving 70
[32:10] percent on the table I might as well
[32:12] just quit and go find somebody to bring
[32:14] forth a hundred no judge nothing before
[32:16] it's time
[32:18] but then the Lord's going to come and
[32:19] he's actually going to judge the hidden
[32:20] things the councils of the heart the
[32:22] motives and objectives and their things
[32:23] and the circumstances in a person's
[32:25] desire and you may be able to admiring
[32:27] your bushel but you could have done a
[32:29] lot more with what you had than what
[32:30] this person did over here
[32:32] you ever think about it the woman that
[32:34] gave two mites that says she gave all
[32:36] he says she gave more
[32:42] there's a lesson in perfect love in that
[32:46] he's going to manifest the councils of
[32:47] the heart and then shall every man have
[32:49] Praise of God I love that I take great
[32:51] comfort in knowing that he saved me by
[32:54] his grace and he's preserved me by the
[32:56] same and I will stand before him one day
[32:58] and he will praise me
[33:00] but I don't want to leave any Praises
[33:02] out
[33:03] to be founded to praise honor and Glory
[33:05] I want to have a lot of crowns that I
[33:07] can give them
[33:09] on that day when the saints crown him
[33:12] brother Branham brings this in because
[33:13] there's an end time application to this
[33:15] as the Dark councils of the hearts are
[33:17] being made manifest he says in the
[33:19] church age book do you know that he's
[33:20] revealing the heart secrets of men and
[33:22] women in the age in which we are living
[33:24] who else could reveal the secrets of the
[33:26] heart but the word himself and so this
[33:27] is a an aspect of judgment now and
[33:30] reward now
[33:32] the wigged one judgment the son of man
[33:35] Ministry there's judgment now but
[33:37] there's reward now I am thy Shield an
[33:39] exceeding great reward he says and he
[33:40] quotes from Hebrews chapter 4 there in
[33:42] that ellipses he's quoting from Hebrews
[33:44] chapter 4 verse 12 how the word of God
[33:45] is sharp and Powerful it is the word it
[33:48] is performing where unto it was sent for
[33:50] it the word is full of power
[33:53] it is the same spirit that was in Jesus
[33:55] the word that is present again in the
[33:57] church in this last age as a last sign
[34:00] trying to head the people off from
[34:02] judgment
[34:03] for they that reject him the word are
[34:06] now already come into judgment
[34:08] crucifying him afresh
[34:11] and so the word is judging us presently
[34:13] now and you are either accepting the
[34:16] word and going into this under the
[34:18] Specter of judgment crucified him afresh
[34:20] or you're being judged worthy of himself
[34:24] a great reward a bridegroom
[34:26] these things are taking place now for a
[34:28] little while this judge
[34:30] is going to begin a judgment as Paul is
[34:32] saying verse 38 now the just shall live
[34:35] by faith
[34:37] will just shall live by his faith is
[34:39] what the Old Testament says but if any
[34:40] man draw back
[34:43] think of this the context for ye of need
[34:45] of patience keep going
[34:47] keep going so that you can receive a
[34:49] full reward and he says now the just
[34:51] shall live by faith but if anybody any
[34:53] man draw back my soul shall have no
[34:54] pleasure in him if any man will shrink
[34:57] back retreat in other words lose
[34:58] confidence
[35:00] therefore displeases God he loses
[35:03] rewards wasting rewards because he says
[35:05] my soul shall have no pleasure in him
[35:07] but we are not of them who draw back
[35:09] unto Perdition but of them that believe
[35:11] to the saving of the Soul so the one
[35:13] that does not shrink back a retreat and
[35:15] displeases God that's the one that
[35:17] preserves his reward that's why he says
[35:19] we're not uh we don't draw back under
[35:21] Perdition that prediction means to be
[35:23] wasteful
[35:24] means to ruin or to suffer loss the loss
[35:26] of money is a word it's actually used
[35:28] for in another place so we we live by
[35:31] faith and we will not draw back because
[35:33] if we draw back that displeases the Lord
[35:35] so we are not like those who are going
[35:37] to stop short and be wasteful we are not
[35:40] those who are going to stop short and
[35:41] lose anything
[35:42] we cannot be sons of Perdition as was a
[35:45] Judas but we can be prediction be given
[35:48] to Perdition in that we waste available
[35:50] opportunities that we don't labor for
[35:53] the Eternal rewards that are made
[35:54] available to the faithful Saints
[35:58] to the saving of the soul that means
[35:59] they obtain the saving the obtaining of
[36:02] the purchase possession to receive one's
[36:04] property of the soul that which the soul
[36:06] merits the fact that I am a Son of God
[36:09] by the Seal of God has merited me an
[36:13] heir of God it has married me joint
[36:15] heirship with Jesus it is given putting
[36:17] me in line to receive a great
[36:18] inheritance and therefore I am one that
[36:20] believes and I follow faith and I live
[36:23] in quarterly that I might receive the
[36:25] fullness of the legal possession of what
[36:27] his duty Paul says where is the the Holy
[36:30] Ghost which is the earnest of our
[36:32] inheritance until the Redemption of the
[36:33] purchased possession under the praise of
[36:35] his glory
[36:37] that's what the saving of the Soul
[36:38] refers to
[36:40] but the just shall live by faith in
[36:42] Hebrews chapter 11 verse 6 but without
[36:44] faith it is impossible to please him
[36:46] for he that cometh to God must believe
[36:48] that he is
[36:50] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[36:51] diligently seek him this is Paul
[36:53] revisiting that we have need of patience
[36:58] that we ought to not draw back that we
[37:01] should live by faith forward movement
[37:03] not drawing back to be wasteful
[37:06] but to believe and to the approach the
[37:08] full possession of the Soul
[37:11] for without faith it is impossible to
[37:13] please him for he that cometh the God
[37:14] must believe that he is and he is a
[37:16] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[37:18] him if I could say this seek to please
[37:22] him
[37:24] this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well
[37:26] pleased
[37:28] this announcement at the Jordan River
[37:30] this uh brother Branham takes that opens
[37:33] it up in whom I'm well pleased to dwell
[37:35] but now on Mount Transfiguration which
[37:37] is the same theme of hear ye him right
[37:40] Mount Transfiguration adoption in all
[37:42] those 19 different places that he
[37:43] preaches that sermon titled that way
[37:45] hear ye him he adopted his own son that
[37:47] day and it speaks again of his pleasure
[37:49] in his son
[37:52] and he is a rewarder of those that seek
[37:54] Him seek to please him rewarders of
[37:56] those who understand it's a fearful
[37:58] thing to fall in the hands of the Living
[38:00] God these are the things that's being
[38:01] represented in this scripture brother
[38:03] Brown says well
[38:06] before I go forward in this there's more
[38:08] to this verse than we realize
[38:10] I think I'm going to come back to it
[38:12] here in a moment
[38:13] there's a there's a beautiful mystery in
[38:15] each age
[38:16] presented here
[38:18] a principle of God and so we ought to
[38:21] have respect for the recompense we ought
[38:24] to have reverence for the reward that
[38:26] the reward that he has promised us you
[38:28] have need of patience that after you've
[38:29] done the will of God you might receive
[38:31] the promise that you might receive the
[38:32] payout and the payoff for for obeying
[38:34] God
[38:35] and brother Branham says each message to
[38:38] each age holds out an incentive to the
[38:40] believer encouraging him to be an
[38:42] overcomer and thereby rewarded of the
[38:45] Lord
[38:46] so every age everyone's recognizing this
[38:48] in every age there are rewards for those
[38:51] who have received the word for their day
[38:53] and have pursued Christ
[38:57] that have received the word for their
[38:59] day and through this patience constant
[39:01] steady heart have brought forth fruit
[39:03] unto Perfection there are rewards for
[39:06] those who've received the good seed the
[39:07] word into good ground and have brought
[39:09] forth 30 60 and 100 fold in every age
[39:13] the message now this is the part I want
[39:14] you to zero in on the message for each
[39:17] age in itself holds out an incentive
[39:21] as it says in Revelations 2 chapters 2
[39:24] and 3 that there's a reward for the
[39:25] overcomer
[39:26] that means that for there must be there
[39:28] if there's a labor there's opposition
[39:30] there's difficulty there's labor
[39:31] overcoming labor opposition difficulty
[39:33] there's a fight I'm going to labor but
[39:34] if it's labor then there has to be a
[39:36] reward or it's bondage
[39:37] so in every age he gives a reward
[39:40] an incentive is the expectation of
[39:42] reward that motivates effort or inspires
[39:44] action
[39:45] in every age the message holds out an
[39:48] incentive or a reward to motivate effort
[39:50] and Inspire action every age has its own
[39:53] incentive it's not a repeat of the
[39:55] reward of the prior age but each message
[39:57] holds out an incentive
[40:00] and this is where I'm wanting to bring
[40:01] out just another aspect of rewards
[40:03] because in the meantime I think we ought
[40:04] to be we ought to acknowledge the
[40:06] incentive or incentives we ought to be
[40:09] recognizing in the meantime what I'm
[40:10] laboring for
[40:12] and so each message holds out an
[40:15] incentive that encourages us to overcome
[40:17] and when we overcome or rewarded
[40:21] in Matthew chapter 10 verse 41
[40:28] we looked at these verses and how that
[40:29] Jesus in each instance
[40:33] recognizes that the the pure motive is
[40:36] not necessarily the reward
[40:38] but because it's due
[40:40] that if we do things because we're
[40:42] thinking well if I just do it I know God
[40:44] will bless me but we're not doing it
[40:45] because it's the will of God
[40:47] then there's a vacuum there's something
[40:49] missing
[40:50] you cannot take the Christ and the grace
[40:52] out of it and just try to achieve some
[40:55] form
[40:56] right but notice it says he that
[40:58] receiveth the prophet in the name of a
[40:59] prophet shall receive a prophet's reward
[41:02] and he that receiveth the righteous man
[41:04] in the name of a righteous man shall
[41:05] receive a righteous man's reward
[41:08] here's the key to the meantime
[41:11] it can be very very specific here for
[41:13] the next several moments
[41:15] he that receiveth the prophet in the
[41:16] name of the Prophet shall receive a
[41:18] prophet's reward
[41:20] and
[41:21] when I first ministered all this a
[41:23] number of years ago
[41:24] God had inspired something to me and I
[41:26] was studying it studying and in my mind
[41:28] God kept bringing me back to this quote
[41:30] where brother Brown answers what this
[41:32] reward is
[41:33] and I and I read it and I'm like uh well
[41:36] my inspiration
[41:38] isn't tracking that and so that I felt
[41:40] like maybe this is a barrier to me or a
[41:43] boundary that maybe maybe this isn't the
[41:45] this isn't the real inspiration you have
[41:47] to check that sometimes to find out
[41:49] whether or not be of God
[41:51] and so there was I I just kept being
[41:53] drawn back to it drawn back to it and I
[41:55] felt very inspired to preach on the
[41:56] subject and so convinced the point where
[41:58] I was like I'm just going to go ahead
[41:59] and take this quote and I'm going to use
[42:00] this quote just to acknowledge it and
[42:02] say this is the truth this is exactly
[42:03] nothing changes here but bring this
[42:05] other principle out of the message and
[42:06] this is the quote that kept coming to my
[42:08] mind he that receiveth the prophet the
[42:09] name of the Prophet shall receive a
[42:10] prophet's reward and it says he that
[42:12] receiveth the righteous men in the name
[42:13] of righteous men shall receive a
[42:14] righteous man's reward but focusing on a
[42:16] prophet's reward
[42:18] brother Brown in August of 1964 is asked
[42:21] brother Brandon if you have time please
[42:22] explain Matthew 10 41 I would like to
[42:25] know what is a prophet's reward and I
[42:27] love it I'm just going to embellish it
[42:29] this way the person's thinking if you
[42:31] have time because this has got to be a
[42:32] really big answer
[42:34] right if you've got time maybe you can
[42:37] get that tent you've been wanting to get
[42:38] and do about 30 days on this because I
[42:41] would love to hear the answer and
[42:42] brother Brahm says a prophet's reward is
[42:44] to be a friend with a prophet
[42:46] done right that's it he just answers it
[42:50] and so that they want to know what a
[42:52] prophet's reward is is to be a friend of
[42:54] the Prophet that's a reward he's your
[42:56] friend
[42:57] very simple very straightforward but
[43:01] you'll recognize that as the brother
[43:02] about him answers this question this is
[43:05] a mouthful
[43:06] that when he says this because it's not
[43:10] just flippant
[43:11] but if you receive a prophet in the name
[43:13] of a prophet he's actually answers he's
[43:15] a friend he's actually bundled up a
[43:17] great mystery in this very simple act uh
[43:20] uh answer the reward of a prophet is to
[43:23] be a friend of a prophet
[43:25] and so in John chapter 15 verses 14 and
[43:28] 15 this is how the Lord began to deal
[43:30] with me you are my friends if ye do
[43:32] whatsoever I commend you
[43:34] henceforth I call you not servants for
[43:36] the servant knoweth not what his Lord
[43:38] doeth but I have called you friends for
[43:40] all things that I have heard of my
[43:42] father I have made known unto you so
[43:44] notice these two prongs to a scriptural
[43:46] friendship you're a friend if you do
[43:49] what you're commanded to do and if
[43:52] secret things are shared with you so
[43:54] these are the characteristics of a
[43:55] scriptural friendship you're obedient
[43:57] to what you're what's taught and you
[44:00] hear secret things
[44:02] you're obedient to the things that the
[44:04] prophet says and the prophet reveals to
[44:06] you Mysteries and so this is what a
[44:09] scriptural friendship is when brother
[44:10] Benham says oh when you receive a
[44:12] prophet in the name of a prophet you
[44:14] receive a prophet's reward to be his
[44:16] friend he wasn't just saying you can be
[44:18] his buddy you can be his pal you can go
[44:20] fishing you can go hunting you can Pat
[44:22] him on the back and say oh my my buddy
[44:24] you're such a good friend but he's
[44:26] saying that friendship speaks of
[44:28] something else
[44:29] brother Brown takes it says he said I
[44:31] call you my friends and a friend tells
[44:33] his friends all things
[44:35] this is what brother Branham is bringing
[44:37] out this a friend calls you I call you
[44:39] my friends and a friend tells his
[44:40] friends all things so if you receive a
[44:43] prophet in the name of the Prophet the
[44:44] benefit of that friendship is now he is
[44:47] sharing with you all things
[44:49] and you can receive what he says you're
[44:51] not suspicious you're not running him
[44:53] down you're not castigating this
[44:54] character you can receive from him
[44:57] says in James chapter 2 verse 23 and the
[44:59] scripture was fulfilled which saith
[45:01] Abraham believed God and it was imputed
[45:03] unto him for righteousness and he was
[45:05] called the friend of God
[45:09] this he was called Abraham was a friend
[45:11] of God because he believed him and God
[45:13] spoke to him God walked with him
[45:16] they did not say it of Moses that God
[45:18] spoke to Moses face to face as a man
[45:20] with his friend
[45:22] and so a reward for receiving a prophet
[45:24] is embodied in friendship
[45:26] and this kind of friendship
[45:29] scriptural friendship and aren't you
[45:31] glad for that
[45:33] because none of us could be his buddy
[45:36] we're actually to the point now where
[45:37] not many are even of the age where we
[45:39] could have been even if we had the
[45:41] opportunity if we are alive during his
[45:43] time we can't be his buddy we can't be
[45:45] efficient pal but we can be a scriptural
[45:47] friend
[45:48] we can still receive a prophet in the
[45:50] name of a prophet and receive the reward
[45:52] of friendship which then begets The
[45:55] Obedience to what he taught and the
[45:56] receiving of the Mysteries that he
[45:58] brought
[46:00] and so when you receive a prophet in the
[46:02] name of a prophet the prophet that we've
[46:04] received in this hour is that of the
[46:06] spirit of Elijah and Malachi chapter 4.
[46:09] and it tells us that a kalijah comes
[46:10] before the great and Dreadful day of the
[46:12] Lord before the Bible says the Wicked
[46:14] with the righteous walk out on the ashes
[46:16] of the wicked
[46:18] and so the ministry of Elijah
[46:20] is the the spirit of the prophet
[46:25] and I want to use the the ministry of
[46:27] Elijah to see the incentive
[46:30] that this message holds out to the
[46:32] believer today
[46:33] because each message holds out an
[46:35] incentive to the believer
[46:37] encouraging them to overcome now
[46:40] this message was more than just the
[46:42] rebuke to laodicea and the promise to
[46:45] the reward the overcome of laodicea
[46:46] there was a message that even followed
[46:48] that
[46:51] and so let's look at the ministry of
[46:53] Elijah in First Kings chapter 17. I'll
[46:55] read verses 12 to 16 but let me just set
[46:57] it up for a moment
[46:59] this is Elijah and the spirit that he
[47:02] has on him is going to be used five
[47:03] times in the scripture and and it's
[47:06] called the spirit of Elijah it's not the
[47:07] man but it's the anointing and the
[47:09] ministry the characteristics of his
[47:10] ministry that he had
[47:11] and there's a Great Famine in the land
[47:13] and after the brook has dried up he
[47:14] comes to Zarephath
[47:18] the Bible says that the Lord had
[47:19] commanded a widow
[47:21] and we where we pick this story up the
[47:23] Widow of Zarephath is getting ready to
[47:26] die along with her son
[47:29] and in verse 12 she said and Lord thy as
[47:31] the Lord thy God I liveth because he
[47:33] asked for a cake he asked for some meal
[47:35] and he says I have not a cake but a
[47:37] handful of meal in a barrel and he'd
[47:38] asked for water previously and a little
[47:40] oil in a cruise and behold I'm gathering
[47:42] two sticks that I may go in and dress it
[47:44] for me and my son that we may eat it and
[47:46] die so death is what's next
[47:49] Elijah said unto her fear not go and do
[47:51] as thou has said but make me there of a
[47:54] little cake first and bring it unto me
[47:56] and after make for them for thy son for
[47:59] thus saith the Lord God of Israel the
[48:01] barrel of milk shall not waste neither
[48:03] shall The Crucible oil fell until the
[48:05] day that the Lord sendeth rain upon the
[48:08] Earth and she went and did
[48:11] did she receive a prophet in the name of
[48:14] a prophet yes because she went and did
[48:16] it's not to have a roommate not to have
[48:17] a buddy not to have a companion she went
[48:19] and did according to the saying of
[48:21] Elijah and she and he and her house her
[48:24] son did eat many days
[48:26] and the Bible says in the barrel of meal
[48:28] wasted not neither did the crucified oil
[48:30] fail according to the word of the Lord
[48:33] which he spake by Elijah
[48:37] so it wasn't just Elijah it wasn't just
[48:39] a hungry man's request we're trying to
[48:42] get into a psychology well he's been
[48:43] down by a brook talking to Ravens for a
[48:45] long time and he's a little bit hungry
[48:46] and he's a little bit scatterbrained and
[48:48] he doesn't know this was the utterance
[48:49] of God this was an unreasonable demand
[48:51] this is now God speaking by Elijah fetch
[48:55] me some water she goes to do it make me
[48:57] a cake she says you know what I could
[48:58] get you some water but I only have
[49:00] enough meal and oil to make a cake for
[49:02] me and my son and they were going to die
[49:03] because death is what's next and he
[49:06] speaks a message to her he says listen
[49:07] you make me one first then you make one
[49:10] for you and your son and I promise you
[49:11] this is a promise if you do what I said
[49:15] you'll have all the oil needs you have
[49:16] all the meal you need sometimes we whine
[49:19] and complain about the word sometimes we
[49:21] want to complain about the anointing
[49:22] well are you doing what you're supposed
[49:24] to do because this message has unlimited
[49:28] meal in unlimited oil
[49:33] and she went and did what he said and it
[49:36] wasted not and it wasn't Elijah but it
[49:38] was by according to the word of the Lord
[49:39] which he spake by Elijah
[49:42] so even in this we can see of incentive
[49:45] to the believer because this is part of
[49:46] a prophet's reward provisioned during a
[49:48] time of famine
[49:49] this is the part of Elijah's reward that
[49:51] if you receive the spirit of Elijah he
[49:53] feeds you during a spiritual drought
[49:55] when you receive the message of Elijah
[49:57] when you receive him and you obey what
[49:58] he says and you follow his precepts then
[50:00] you are walking in a pattern where he's
[50:02] going to give you substance during a
[50:05] famine
[50:06] where it will not run dry it will not
[50:08] run out
[50:10] and so the word of God from Elijah is
[50:12] embodied in that meal in that oil
[50:15] and then her receiving it this is the
[50:16] other part I want you to catch
[50:18] she testified death is what's next
[50:22] and think about the whole picture
[50:25] what intervened
[50:27] a woman's going about her day
[50:29] and it's appointed unto her to die
[50:31] her and her son she knows it's certain
[50:33] and Elijah Elijah walks up with a
[50:37] message
[50:38] that if she receives
[50:39] bypasses death
[50:42] takes that certain death and pushes it
[50:44] away
[50:45] because she went and did what was she
[50:47] doing she wasn't just labing for herself
[50:49] she was laboring for the Lord
[50:52] because she provided for the servant
[50:54] first she was spoiling of her Goods for
[50:55] the servant of the Lord she was doing
[50:57] what Paul was saying in Hebrews chapter
[50:58] 10. you've spoiled your goods from my
[51:00] behalf you've given of yourself don't
[51:01] Cast Away your confidence because it has
[51:03] great recompense of reward and so she
[51:05] was laboring for the Lord and what did
[51:07] God do he rewarded her for that
[51:09] because she gave him the first place she
[51:11] didn't say well I'll tell you what I'll
[51:12] make one for me and if there's any left
[51:14] over I'll feed you she'd abandoned
[51:16] herself to the cause
[51:18] and was willing to suffer the
[51:19] consequence knowing that's a fearful
[51:22] thing to displease the Lord
[51:25] and so the reward God rewarded her
[51:28] by preserving her and her son
[51:30] but if you continue reading in verse 17
[51:32] after this great intervention
[51:35] The Widow's son dies
[51:38] and you can imagine the test that this
[51:41] must have been to her faith
[51:43] and how that she would say oh well I you
[51:45] know we were just scrounging around in
[51:46] the world and we were just trying to
[51:48] find sticks and we had just a little bit
[51:49] of milk a little bit of oil and it was
[51:50] just a famine but you know the ministry
[51:52] of Elijah came and brought a message and
[51:54] it started to feed us and we fed many
[51:56] days and it was awesome and our whole
[51:57] family was serving God and everything
[51:58] was great and everything's wonderful
[52:00] then a test came and you could just
[52:02] imagine how her neighbors might have
[52:04] been sitting there on the fence saying
[52:06] yeah so what did Elijah do for you again
[52:08] tell me all these great stories
[52:10] like some good it did you because now
[52:12] your son's dead right she bragged about
[52:15] the prophet bragged about the message
[52:16] bragged about what he'd done for and now
[52:18] I'm sure her test her confidence is
[52:19] tested in Elijah
[52:21] and it's expressed in even her
[52:23] interactions but notice what happens in
[52:25] verse 22.
[52:26] and the Lord heard the voice of Elijah
[52:30] and the soul of the child came into him
[52:33] again and he revived
[52:35] despite the test despite the trial there
[52:38] was a reward
[52:40] for what she had done
[52:41] there was an incentive that Elijah was
[52:43] holding out to her that maybe wasn't
[52:45] apparent in the first feeding maybe it
[52:48] wasn't Apparent at first when he was
[52:49] sustainer during a time of drought in a
[52:51] time of famine but there was still yet
[52:53] another promise that when she suffered
[52:54] death within her family and the loss of
[52:56] her son that there was something that
[52:58] could be moved in this ministry of
[52:59] Elijah and he spoke and the soul of the
[53:02] child came into him again and this dead
[53:04] son was raised back to life
[53:07] I want you to recognize the the benefit
[53:09] that she received when in this moment in
[53:13] this instance was that death came and it
[53:16] was defeated
[53:17] the the prophet's reward is that death
[53:19] was knocking and it stayed away but now
[53:22] death makes it and death is overcome by
[53:25] it and there was a direct connection we
[53:28] ought not to miss this there was a
[53:29] direct connection between her efforts to
[53:31] serve Elijah and her efforts to to serve
[53:34] him with the meal in the oil there was a
[53:36] direct connection with her between her
[53:38] efforts to sustain the profit and the
[53:40] rewards that she was receiving
[53:43] a direct connection between her labor
[53:46] and her faith and the Reviving of her
[53:48] son
[53:49] amen this is
[53:50] the part of the spirit of Elijah
[53:54] remember the to receive a prophet name
[53:56] of prophets to receive a prophet's
[53:57] reward
[53:59] and second Kings chapter 4 verses 8 to
[54:02] 10.
[54:04] let's look at another example of the
[54:06] spirit of Elijah
[54:08] because Elijah wanted
[54:10] that exactly Elisha wanted that exact
[54:13] anointing
[54:14] on him represented by that double
[54:16] portion
[54:17] and it fell on a day
[54:20] that Elisha passed a shoonom
[54:23] so this is where was a great woman
[54:25] shunamite woman
[54:26] and she constrained him to eat bread
[54:29] and so it was
[54:31] that as often as he passed by he turned
[54:33] in thither to eat bread
[54:35] and she said unto her husband a catch
[54:38] just the labor and the care that she has
[54:39] for God's servants
[54:41] notice that whatever it was whatever
[54:43] unction she had to serve him she obeyed
[54:45] It Whatever inspiration she had to
[54:46] minister to this man she gave of her
[54:48] home she gives her resource she gives of
[54:50] her bread and remember Jesus said in so
[54:53] much that you've done it unto the least
[54:54] of these my brethren
[54:56] you've done it unto me
[54:58] so what she's doing is to the Lord
[55:01] and there was a reward even in a glass
[55:02] of water merits award notice what she's
[55:04] doing for the Elijah a lot this Elijah
[55:06] Ministry on Elisha and she said unto her
[55:08] husband verse 9 behold now I perceive
[55:10] that this is a holy man of God which
[55:11] passeth by us continually
[55:14] let us make a little chamber I pray thee
[55:16] on the wall and let us set for him there
[55:18] a bed and a table and a stool and a
[55:20] Candlestick and it shall be when he
[55:22] cometh to us that he shall turn in
[55:24] thither
[55:25] and he did this notice this labor and
[55:28] this care
[55:29] that this family began to give to Elisha
[55:32] Elisha being under this anointing the
[55:34] spirit of Elijah
[55:36] this is something that she had done to
[55:39] serve Elisha and in doing so serves God
[55:43] and this service is not going to go
[55:44] unnoticed
[55:46] all these efforts towards this uh this
[55:48] ministry is not going to go unnoticed if
[55:50] I can say it this way her efforts were
[55:51] registering in heaven
[55:53] her efforts were being noticed by a God
[55:55] who rewards by God who gives
[55:58] and we recognize
[56:00] in this story
[56:02] well let me just
[56:07] let me just continue to read let me just
[56:09] go back to this quote I think I have it
[56:11] there
[56:12] in Ma and and as I was reading this it's
[56:16] been a number of years some of you may
[56:18] heard me preach this to some degree
[56:19] elsewhere
[56:22] um but these
[56:24] when God kept bringing me back to this
[56:26] quote
[56:30] my inspiration was the Elijah's reward
[56:33] the prophet's reward in this end time
[56:34] what does it present to us and begin to
[56:36] see a pattern in Elijah's Ministry and I
[56:38] was thinking think of this pattern think
[56:40] this is the reward this is the reward of
[56:42] this day this is the incentive that god
[56:43] holds out to the believer inspiring him
[56:45] to press on and motivating him to press
[56:47] on and then I kept coming back to this
[56:49] quote well he's a friend he's a friend
[56:52] and then and I and I kept wrestling with
[56:54] it and the Holy Spirit kept telling me
[56:55] go back to it go back to it go back to
[56:57] it and I can't say well he's a friend
[56:59] he's a friend he's a friend and and more
[57:01] opened up well it means more to be a
[57:02] friend than just to be a buddy you you
[57:04] you become a servant you obey you render
[57:06] to him what is due uh you receive secret
[57:09] things so I begin to see friendship in a
[57:11] much deeper way but I was like no I see
[57:12] this pattern in the lives of a minute
[57:13] Elijah's Ministry this is this is the
[57:15] reward of Elijah this is the word of
[57:17] Elijah so I came back to this brother
[57:18] Branham if you have time please explain
[57:20] Matthew 10 41 God kept bringing me back
[57:22] to it over and over again I'm like I
[57:23] know I get it he's a friend
[57:26] can you please I'd like to know what is
[57:28] a prophet's reward please explain
[57:29] Matthew 10 41. I'd like to know what a
[57:31] prophet's reward is I know it's going to
[57:32] take a lot of time so do it when you've
[57:34] got time right
[57:36] prophets rewarders to be a friend with
[57:37] the prophet
[57:38] and if they want to know a prophet's
[57:40] reward is is to be a friend of a prophet
[57:43] that's reward he's your friend
[57:45] and then brother Brandon says
[57:47] like the shunamite woman
[57:50] it might come in handy sometime
[57:52] it did with her Watch God's servants
[57:55] brother Brandon wasn't just he says yeah
[57:57] you're right this would take a lot of
[57:59] time
[58:00] but let me just get it in real quick you
[58:02] receive a prophet in the name of a
[58:03] prophet you'll receive a prophet's
[58:05] reward that's to be a friend of a
[58:07] prophet and if you become a real friend
[58:08] of the Prophet you do what he says and
[58:11] you catch the Mysteries it's going to
[58:13] come in handy sometime
[58:15] and he says like the shunamite woman
[58:17] Hallelujah it might come in handy
[58:19] sometime and what happened for the
[58:21] shunami woman not only did she make a
[58:23] place for Elisha not only did she give
[58:25] them bread not only did she give them a
[58:27] bed not only did she show care to him
[58:29] but when her son died
[58:31] when he passed away she said I've got to
[58:33] go to this servant and in the Elisha
[58:35] said well I want this servant I don't
[58:37] have him but she said I don't want some
[58:39] other man I want to go to the prophet I
[58:41] want to I want to hear it from him and
[58:43] Elisha does what he comes to the home
[58:45] and he comes to this place wherein this
[58:47] he lived and this woman served and he
[58:50] received of their home and there laid
[58:52] this dead son in a family that had
[58:54] labored for him and he travails and what
[58:57] does he do he raises the Sun from the
[59:00] dead
[59:04] this dead son comes back to life this is
[59:06] the spirit of Elijah so when brother
[59:08] Brown says oh prophet's reward is to be
[59:10] a friend of a prophet he just lays out
[59:12] this great mystery he's pointing to the
[59:14] mystery of true friendship he's pointing
[59:15] to the potential of its reward he's
[59:17] pointing to the incentive
[59:20] the Friendship itself has its own reward
[59:23] this was the shunamites woman's reward
[59:25] for friendship with Elisha just like the
[59:28] Widow of zaraphat
[59:30] you catch what's happening the Widow is
[59:32] there a fact and I love how the women
[59:33] are being brought into the view in this
[59:35] because then it helps us to understand
[59:36] this speaks of me as the elect of God
[59:37] the the Bride of Jesus Christ death was
[59:41] knocking on the door by famine and by
[59:42] drought but Elijah came and and
[59:45] prevented death death came to the family
[59:47] and Elijah came and raised him from the
[59:49] dead now you have the same thing happen
[59:51] with the of my woman and it's the
[59:54] very image that brother Branham wants us
[59:55] to see when it comes to a prophet's
[59:57] reward with Elijah for this day referred
[1:00:00] to the scripture he said Remember the
[1:00:02] shoot of my woman
[1:00:04] come in handy sometime
[1:00:09] the spirit of Elijah on Elijah and
[1:00:11] Elisha holds the mystery of the message
[1:00:13] incentive
[1:00:15] in the new 10 in the Old Testament
[1:00:17] there's only three instances of the Dead
[1:00:18] being resurrected we've already read two
[1:00:20] of them to you
[1:00:22] Elijah in first king 17.
[1:00:24] twice by Elisha one here in Second Kings
[1:00:27] four
[1:00:29] and then another time by Elijah has any
[1:00:31] surprises twice by Elijah once by Elijah
[1:00:33] twice by Elisha
[1:00:34] second Kings chapter 13 the bones of
[1:00:36] Elijah Elisha are in a grave
[1:00:39] and some Israelites are trying to bury a
[1:00:40] man real quick and the enemy's coming
[1:00:42] and Elisha's bones are in there and in
[1:00:45] their haste they throw the dead man upon
[1:00:47] the bones of the prophet
[1:00:49] and he comes alive
[1:00:51] I want you to think about what it Matt
[1:00:53] what it means the spirit of Elijah what
[1:00:56] it represents what this ministry
[1:00:57] represents a dead man's bodies
[1:00:59] resurrected when it touches the bones of
[1:01:01] a dead Prophet why because God was
[1:01:03] wanting you to have respect for the
[1:01:05] reward he's one you have respect for the
[1:01:08] anointing and respect for the ministry
[1:01:09] of Elijah that there's something he
[1:01:11] wants to convey to us in the ministry of
[1:01:13] Elijah a spirit that he uses five times
[1:01:15] in every single instance he's one is to
[1:01:18] recognize the power and potential of it
[1:01:20] John who in the spirit of the Elijah
[1:01:22] came forward doing what introducing the
[1:01:25] truth and the life he came pointing to
[1:01:28] the resurrection and the life that's
[1:01:30] what Elijah's Ministry represents life
[1:01:33] and Resurrection
[1:01:34] [Music]
[1:01:36] we're pointing to the Elijah of our day
[1:01:38] would be the fourth but what happens
[1:01:39] with the fifth
[1:01:41] Revelations 11 11.
[1:01:44] Elijah is Resurrected
[1:01:47] so Elijah of Malachi 4 is associated
[1:01:49] with the reward of a resurrection in the
[1:01:52] rapture
[1:01:53] he's associated with power over death
[1:01:57] that's the prophet's reward
[1:01:59] he's your friend
[1:02:01] like the shunamite woman
[1:02:03] it might come in handy sometime
[1:02:06] you don't think the prophet was pointing
[1:02:07] to something
[1:02:10] the Elijah of Malachi 4 is associated
[1:02:12] with this reward this is what I'm
[1:02:13] wanting new to esteem as we close this
[1:02:15] series esteem the recompense of God
[1:02:17] there is a reward that's held out to us
[1:02:19] who believe the message
[1:02:21] there's a reward held up to us by the
[1:02:24] message this Shout
[1:02:25] it might come in handy sometimes
[1:02:28] a reward in the face of spiritual death
[1:02:30] a reward in this Faith at the face of
[1:02:32] spiritual famine
[1:02:35] a reward in the time of plagues of
[1:02:37] deception
[1:02:38] a reward in the time of literal death
[1:02:42] even Elijah's own life speaks to this in
[1:02:45] second Kings chapter 2 verse 11.
[1:02:47] it came to pass as they still went on
[1:02:49] Elisha is not going to take his eyes off
[1:02:50] Elijah
[1:02:52] and talk that behold there appeared a
[1:02:54] chariot of fire in the horses of fire
[1:02:55] imparted them both asunder and Elijah
[1:02:57] went up by a whirlwind into heaven this
[1:02:59] was this is Elijah's literal reward
[1:03:03] to be swept away bypassing death
[1:03:05] in the first instance of the ministry of
[1:03:07] Elijah not only does he raise prevent
[1:03:09] death and raise the dead but he doesn't
[1:03:11] even die himself
[1:03:13] what is it that God's trying to the
[1:03:15] figure that he's trying to show to us
[1:03:16] brother Adam said the message
[1:03:18] Investments about Elijah after he got
[1:03:19] old and tired he was ready to go home he
[1:03:22] didn't even have to die his payoff come
[1:03:25] God just sent him down a chariot and
[1:03:27] some horses and packed him up into the
[1:03:29] heavens so even Elijah's own reward
[1:03:31] speaks to the message incentive he says
[1:03:34] his payoff come this is the payoff of
[1:03:36] Elijah Elijah is a partaker of the
[1:03:38] firstfruits of his own reward that he
[1:03:40] shall not taste death
[1:03:42] the layout of sin Church age brother man
[1:03:44] who preaches Elijah did not have to die
[1:03:46] he was translated and was taken up into
[1:03:48] heaven why why a type of the church at
[1:03:51] the end of this Elijah that will come
[1:03:54] a type of the Bride that's going to be
[1:03:56] called out by revelations 18 4. a type
[1:03:58] of the Bride that's going to be called
[1:03:59] out of the church at the end time the
[1:04:00] type of the Bride that's going to be
[1:04:02] raised up by the ministry of Elijah why
[1:04:04] did God preserve Elijah so that he would
[1:04:06] be a type of the Bride in the last days
[1:04:08] that comes under the anointing of
[1:04:10] Malachi 4. at the end of his time the
[1:04:12] church will go in the Rapture without
[1:04:13] going through the shadows of death it'll
[1:04:15] be the rapture
[1:04:17] in the meantime this is the reward
[1:04:19] that's extended to us this is the goal
[1:04:21] that we ought to keep in mind
[1:04:23] this is something that we ought to
[1:04:24] patiently pursue and put everything we
[1:04:26] we do in light of this great precious
[1:04:28] promise that is put before us
[1:04:30] the Bible says in Hebrews chapter 11
[1:04:31] verses 5 to 6 we read verse 6 earlier
[1:04:34] and I said there's a great mystery in
[1:04:35] this there's so much more to this by
[1:04:37] faith Enoch was translated that he
[1:04:39] should not see death and was not found
[1:04:41] because God had translated him for
[1:04:43] before his translation he had this
[1:04:45] testimony that he pleased God
[1:04:48] this is Enoch's testimony
[1:04:50] and notice it's a testimony that he was
[1:04:54] translated before he died and his
[1:04:56] testimony was before he was translated
[1:04:58] he had a testimony that he pleased God
[1:05:01] this is the very thing that Paul said we
[1:05:03] ought to do we ought to make it our
[1:05:05] ambition that we would please him we
[1:05:07] should not want to displease him it's a
[1:05:10] fearful thing to displease him this is
[1:05:12] the image that he brings up after
[1:05:13] telling us what he did in Hebrews
[1:05:15] chapter 10 that Enoch walked with God
[1:05:18] and was not found as it says in Genesis
[1:05:19] 5 24 and Enoch walked with God and was
[1:05:21] not for God took him this is the mystery
[1:05:24] of Hebrews 11 6 because he says for
[1:05:26] listen to it I'm just getting too
[1:05:28] excited I guess but without faith it is
[1:05:30] impossible to please him for he that
[1:05:32] cometh the God must believe that he is
[1:05:34] and that he's a rewarder of them that
[1:05:36] diligently seek him he's talking about a
[1:05:38] translation he's talking about a
[1:05:41] resurrection you've got to want it bad
[1:05:43] enough to seek it
[1:05:46] we begin to have a theme in our home and
[1:05:48] maybe this is put a little bit crudely
[1:05:50] and this was early on in its
[1:05:51] developmental stages Rapture a bust
[1:05:55] and we begin to have this burden and
[1:05:56] vision in our home that we we want to
[1:05:59] examine what we do by whether or not
[1:06:00] this is facilitating the body change
[1:06:02] for ourselves and for our children am I
[1:06:05] in a church that's given me the
[1:06:06] resources I need to possess every
[1:06:08] promise am I hearing a word that's going
[1:06:10] to lead me to a body change am I
[1:06:12] diligently seeking him because unless I
[1:06:15] have a faith that diligently seeks
[1:06:17] unless I have a hunger that I want every
[1:06:20] single promise unless I come under
[1:06:22] desperation and say God you promised
[1:06:24] elect right in this end time that she'd
[1:06:26] put every devil under her feet including
[1:06:29] death and until I get desperate to have
[1:06:31] the last funeral for an elect seed am I
[1:06:34] really going to see it
[1:06:38] and if I could say this
[1:06:41] just by way of
[1:06:43] supposing or conjecture
[1:06:46] I pray to God that he doesn't have to
[1:06:48] send pandemic after pandemic to weed out
[1:06:50] all the elect who aren't hungry enough
[1:06:52] for a rapture
[1:06:55] brother Brown said Enoch was translated
[1:06:56] from Death By God's transforming power
[1:06:58] why did God do that
[1:07:01] for a type of the rapturing church
[1:07:02] that's coming
[1:07:04] and he says yeah Elijah was the same
[1:07:07] why did God do it as a type for us
[1:07:10] that we could have this testimony
[1:07:13] that we please God
[1:07:15] we have this testimony that we believe
[1:07:17] he's a reward of them that diligently
[1:07:18] seek him so we seek him in his promises
[1:07:20] this is a secret too in the meantime
[1:07:23] that we ought to be pursuing the prize
[1:07:25] to ought to be some hunger and ambition
[1:07:27] and a heart to gain every Crown this I
[1:07:30] share this is this is the incentive that
[1:07:31] this message holds out to us that this
[1:07:33] is something that we realize the message
[1:07:35] wants us to take into consideration to
[1:07:37] live for the reward of this hour
[1:07:40] build around in the sermon
[1:07:42] excuse me chapter seven of the church
[1:07:43] age book says and they shall walk with
[1:07:45] me my wife was going to sing a song
[1:07:47] today that she wrote about walk with me
[1:07:49] and just we ran out of time he said this
[1:07:52] that is what God says he will bestow
[1:07:53] upon them for this upright that is part
[1:07:56] of their inheritance that he's reserved
[1:07:58] for them if they are willing to walk
[1:08:00] with him to the toils and snares of life
[1:08:02] and be an honor to him he was going to
[1:08:05] reward him this is the example of Elijah
[1:08:07] this is the example of Enoch he's going
[1:08:10] to reward him he is not forgetful of our
[1:08:12] labor of love God will always recompense
[1:08:14] us for our efforts to please him
[1:08:16] he always will and the sermon
[1:08:19] inspiration someday brother when the son
[1:08:21] refuses to shine when the moon goes down
[1:08:23] and the stars hide their face from the
[1:08:25] earth and the last sermons preached and
[1:08:27] the Bible's laying closed the church
[1:08:28] blowed into bits and the rocks are
[1:08:30] convolting and crying out I want to know
[1:08:32] him
[1:08:34] as the poet in the song said I see Adam
[1:08:36] Shake Eve and say Eve this is it honey
[1:08:38] Eve reaches over and shakes Abel and
[1:08:41] Abel shakes Seth Seth shakes Noah Noah
[1:08:44] shakes Abraham the time has come and
[1:08:46] notice he says know him in the power of
[1:08:48] his resurrection know that my
[1:08:50] inspiration that's been leading me and
[1:08:52] been clashed as a fanatic and whatever
[1:08:54] more it's brought me to the line it's
[1:08:57] brought me to the pain off place
[1:08:59] oh this is why Paul says you have need
[1:09:02] of patience then after you've done the
[1:09:04] will of God you might receive the
[1:09:05] promise don't give up little bride
[1:09:07] there's a prize for perseverance
[1:09:10] it's brought me to a pain off-place
[1:09:12] mothers you old gray-headed mothers and
[1:09:14] daddies here I say this to the veterans
[1:09:16] amongst us who persevere there's so many
[1:09:18] terms of the message so many ups and
[1:09:20] downs and church splits and revivals and
[1:09:22] meetings and interpretations but you've
[1:09:24] stayed faithful you've seen things come
[1:09:26] and go he says it's brought me to a pain
[1:09:28] all place and he says don't worry the
[1:09:31] inspiration that's LED you to Christ and
[1:09:33] you've come through many dangerous toils
[1:09:35] and snares don't worry some morning
[1:09:38] it'll pay off it'll pay off there's a
[1:09:41] reward that's coming
[1:09:43] that's why Paul says let no man beguile
[1:09:46] you out of your reward in a voluntary
[1:09:47] humility let no man cheat you from every
[1:09:50] incentive that this message holds out
[1:09:52] just as they rebuked the Galatians whose
[1:09:54] Bewitched you you become fools that you
[1:09:57] obey not the truth what are you saying
[1:09:59] you've got it in you to win you've got
[1:10:01] it in you to gain don't let anybody
[1:10:03] cheat you out of it
[1:10:06] Hebrews 12 1-3 wherefore sin that we are
[1:10:09] also confessed about with so great a
[1:10:11] cloud of witnesses let us lay aside
[1:10:13] everywhere wait and the sin which does
[1:10:15] so easily beset us and let us run with
[1:10:17] patience
[1:10:19] Paul building on that Hebrews 10. in the
[1:10:21] meantime what ought we to do
[1:10:24] run our race with patients that is set
[1:10:25] before us
[1:10:27] Paul did so he says I finished my course
[1:10:28] and henceforth there's laid up for me a
[1:10:30] crown
[1:10:31] and what do we do we look unto Jesus the
[1:10:32] author and finish of our faith
[1:10:35] who for the joy that was set before
[1:10:36] endured the cross despising the shame
[1:10:39] and to sit down at the right hand of the
[1:10:40] Throne of God for consider him that
[1:10:43] endured such contradictions of Sinners
[1:10:45] against himself lest ye be wearied and
[1:10:49] faint in your minds
[1:10:50] consider Moses consider Jesus consider
[1:10:53] all these ones who endured with the
[1:10:55] prize and view
[1:10:57] think of the reward unless you get weary
[1:11:00] think of the reward unless you think
[1:11:01] it's not worth it think of the reward
[1:11:02] unless you think it's all in vain think
[1:11:04] of the reward
[1:11:05] what was the quote we read in the begin
[1:11:07] this year I'm looking forward now what
[1:11:09] I'm looking forward to now is what I'll
[1:11:10] do in this coming year towards the
[1:11:11] betterment of the Kingdom doing more all
[1:11:13] that I can do for the kingdom of God
[1:11:15] and the things that we tried to express
[1:11:17] to you this year and this first quarter
[1:11:19] of the year we've just been pretty much
[1:11:21] on one theme we know the will of God for
[1:11:23] us so let's do it
[1:11:25] let's be faithful in it let's let's in
[1:11:28] our home sanctify our home and gather
[1:11:30] our families and ourselves even as
[1:11:31] individuals around the world and let's
[1:11:33] have a life that's living for others I
[1:11:35] know that's God's will for me I know
[1:11:37] that's a work he wants to be under eight
[1:11:39] to undertaken and I don't want to stand
[1:11:41] before him on that day having not done
[1:11:43] the will of God and therefore not
[1:11:44] receiving a promise I don't want to be
[1:11:46] one that stands before him on that day
[1:11:47] and I disappoint him because I didn't
[1:11:50] know do what I knew I should do I want
[1:11:52] to assemble myself together as I have an
[1:11:54] opportunity I want to give of my
[1:11:56] resources in tithes and offerings I want
[1:11:58] to support missions I want to do the
[1:12:00] things I know that God wants me to do
[1:12:02] not just because solely that I ought to
[1:12:05] do it but I know that it pleases him
[1:12:07] unless I get weary and faint I know that
[1:12:10] it pleases him and if it pleases him he
[1:12:13] Rewards yeah
[1:12:16] we could have our brothers come to their
[1:12:18] instruments
[1:12:20] brother man says if you only look for
[1:12:22] today you'd be a miserable person
[1:12:27] look to the end out there and live for
[1:12:30] that out to the end
[1:12:32] you know if all you did is look today on
[1:12:34] a Sunday you wake up you go
[1:12:36] I guess I gotta go to church again pay
[1:12:37] my tithes and offerings support missions
[1:12:39] and sing a few songs and go home because
[1:12:42] that's
[1:12:43] when the church doors are open you know
[1:12:46] yes Christian's gonna be there right and
[1:12:49] that's that's what you're doing
[1:12:50] and it's all you focus on
[1:12:52] if you only look for today you'd be a
[1:12:54] miserable person
[1:12:55] you know what that may explain the
[1:12:57] misery people go through when they go to
[1:12:58] church
[1:12:59] because they're only looking at I guess
[1:13:00] today we need to be there they're going
[1:13:01] to notice if I'm not there
[1:13:03] but he says look out to the end to live
[1:13:05] for that
[1:13:06] when you can live out to look out to the
[1:13:08] end and live for that then you realize
[1:13:09] wait a minute
[1:13:10] today just about today
[1:13:13] is about tomorrow
[1:13:14] and tomorrow will be about the next and
[1:13:16] every single one of these are just
[1:13:17] stepping stones to the great promise and
[1:13:19] you know that there's a reward today
[1:13:21] you may not receive it today but there's
[1:13:23] a reward for doing what he asked us to
[1:13:25] do
[1:13:27] in the sermon in time evangelism if I
[1:13:29] could just use a few more of these
[1:13:33] a couple just a couple more quotes here
[1:13:37] brother man I'm in this sermon the end
[1:13:38] time evangelism he's referred to the
[1:13:41] woman that washed Jesus feet and Simon
[1:13:42] was sitting there scoffing at her
[1:13:44] mocking her
[1:13:45] and just how much she had to go through
[1:13:47] to get to that place where she was
[1:13:48] willing to be ridiculed and looked down
[1:13:50] upon
[1:13:52] she's so he's using this woman that
[1:13:54] washed Jesus feet but he's working off
[1:13:56] of also the type of Rebecca who watered
[1:13:57] the camels of Abraham servant
[1:14:00] he says here comes his brother remember
[1:14:01] uses calls him Elisa that he comes and
[1:14:05] he's going to get a bride for Isaac so
[1:14:07] Abraham is sent his servant to go find a
[1:14:09] bride and the message the messenger has
[1:14:11] this image this Vision that the one that
[1:14:13] comes and Waters my camels that's the
[1:14:15] one that's going to be the the bride to
[1:14:16] my servant son
[1:14:18] [Music]
[1:14:19] so Rebecca goes to draw water and she's
[1:14:21] going to go draw water for her family
[1:14:23] but something in her serves and gets
[1:14:27] water and gets this water Waters the
[1:14:30] camels
[1:14:31] and and so this is the type that brother
[1:14:32] Brown's drawing on he says all the way
[1:14:34] down now so he's now speaking of the
[1:14:36] woman that washed Jesus feet all the way
[1:14:37] down she had nothing at all
[1:14:39] but just a fear that she wasn't doing
[1:14:41] the right thing
[1:14:43] is there someone here that has a fear of
[1:14:45] that
[1:14:46] Maybe
[1:14:47] but it needed to be done
[1:14:49] but her reward come at the end
[1:14:52] and that reward he what was it
[1:14:55] went through all that to hear thy sins
[1:14:57] be forgiven
[1:14:59] oh think of all the things she had to
[1:15:00] suffer what she had to give up
[1:15:01] everything she had to overcome but that
[1:15:03] reward we said thy sins be forgiven thee
[1:15:05] so now he brings it on us you might hear
[1:15:07] me preach these messages you might see
[1:15:09] the Holy Spirit discern and do great
[1:15:11] things and perform Miracles you might
[1:15:12] pray and it would never come to pass go
[1:15:15] on your reward comes at the end
[1:15:18] wouldn't that be better then
[1:15:22] wouldn't it be better then
[1:15:23] you say yeah
[1:15:25] because that's what he says
[1:15:27] you think you realize so much sometimes
[1:15:29] what we want is the Vindication in this
[1:15:30] life
[1:15:31] I wanna I wanna pray till I speak in
[1:15:34] tongues I want to see the dead Rays when
[1:15:36] I lay my hands on them I want to have a
[1:15:37] I want to have a church service where
[1:15:39] everyone is excited and moving and
[1:15:41] shouting and dancing and praising so
[1:15:43] that I can have some sort of affirmation
[1:15:45] that I'm in it that everything's working
[1:15:46] everything's fine he says you know what
[1:15:48] none of those things may happen to you
[1:15:49] he says but your reward comes at the end
[1:15:51] he says go on your reward comes at the
[1:15:52] end wouldn't that be better anyways
[1:15:54] but he still doesn't exclude us from
[1:15:56] service he says do Jesus a service
[1:15:59] that's the end time message
[1:16:02] what's the end time message do Jesus a
[1:16:05] service he had a bride God's looking for
[1:16:09] character this is the character that
[1:16:11] Rebecca had when she came to the well
[1:16:13] she had the kind of character that the
[1:16:15] servant was looking for for her his
[1:16:16] master's son and he said that's the end
[1:16:19] time message to God a service
[1:16:22] demonstrate the character that's
[1:16:24] becoming of the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:16:28] I'm doing a service knowing that through
[1:16:31] all your tears through all your giving
[1:16:33] through all your pouring out even if it
[1:16:35] would be in the image of crying upon the
[1:16:38] feet of Jesus and pouring the oil upon
[1:16:40] his feet and drying it with your hair
[1:16:43] and this messy scene that the world just
[1:16:45] wants to criticize and make fun of even
[1:16:48] if that be it just stay in service
[1:16:51] there's a reward that comes at the end
[1:16:56] and brother Brad him in the fifth seal
[1:16:58] picks up this image of Rebecca again
[1:17:00] he says remember when the servant of
[1:17:03] Abraham Eliezer when you come to get
[1:17:05] Rebecca
[1:17:06] there's a reason why we had two Rebecca
[1:17:09] Singh
[1:17:10] all right
[1:17:12] Rebecca when the servant of Abraham
[1:17:14] Eliezer when he came to get Rebecca she
[1:17:16] mounted up on her camel the very camel
[1:17:19] she watered
[1:17:21] very camel that she served
[1:17:24] the very thing that she gave attention
[1:17:25] to what was it that saved the shun of my
[1:17:27] woman's son the very Ministry she
[1:17:30] supported what was it that saved the
[1:17:31] Zarephath Widow and her son the very
[1:17:34] Ministry she supported think about the
[1:17:36] reward that they came down to he said
[1:17:38] Rebecca she mounted off her camel and it
[1:17:40] was the camel that she wanted he brings
[1:17:42] this beautiful image before us she rode
[1:17:44] the camel to meet her unseen bridegroom
[1:17:47] the very thing she watered was the very
[1:17:50] thing that took her to her future home
[1:17:53] and husband and it's the same thing
[1:17:55] today the very thing that the church is
[1:17:59] watering that is the seed the seed of
[1:18:02] the word it's the very word that becomes
[1:18:04] alive and Carries us to our unseen
[1:18:07] bridegroom I say it's worth it to water
[1:18:10] it's worth it to serve it's worth it to
[1:18:12] give my all I want a hundredfold
[1:18:16] this very thing that I'm watering it's
[1:18:18] carrying me to a meeting in the air
[1:18:20] though I've United with them now
[1:18:22] spiritually though there's an invisible
[1:18:24] Union though there's been an unfolding
[1:18:25] of the invisible God's objective all
[1:18:27] along is that one day it would be United
[1:18:30] in flesh and full visible manifestation
[1:18:33] the very thing that you're watering is
[1:18:35] this image of Rebecca
[1:18:37] is the very thing that's coming alive
[1:18:38] and carrying us to our unseen bridegroom
[1:18:40] I want to encourage you in the meantime
[1:18:42] there's going to be a day we're all
[1:18:43] going to have to answer and that in
[1:18:45] itself is fearful enough so in the
[1:18:46] meantime keep the incentives in view
[1:18:49] there's goals that we're labing for
[1:18:51] there's crowds that can be gained
[1:18:53] and we ought to press with everything
[1:18:55] that's in US
[1:18:57] brother Brown said there's a reward for
[1:18:59] Overcomers
[1:19:01] there's a reward for Overcomers he says
[1:19:04] press on Lily
[1:19:06] did Lily sing too
[1:19:10] I just have never felt more Vindicated
[1:19:11] in my life guys I mean come on
[1:19:14] I was going to use Esther as a type too
[1:19:17] and Michael the Archangel and Micah the
[1:19:20] prophet and being loyal
[1:19:22] Joshua
[1:19:24] it was a masterpiece and I've just run
[1:19:26] out of time
[1:19:28] [Music]
[1:19:30] press on Lily if it's in you lay aside
[1:19:35] the mud and everything else
[1:19:36] impressed towards the top
[1:19:39] this is the message telling us don't
[1:19:42] quit
[1:19:43] don't give up and and I know that this
[1:19:46] is maybe fearful ground to step on
[1:19:49] because for some they may say well
[1:19:51] brother Aaron if you give them if you
[1:19:52] give them room if you give them an
[1:19:53] answer they're going to take a yard and
[1:19:55] if you just don't nail it down tight
[1:19:56] you're not going to give them any room
[1:19:57] to uh to Mo you're going to give them
[1:19:59] too much to room to move and it's going
[1:20:01] to be to their detriment I I want to say
[1:20:03] don't Cast Away Your Liberty
[1:20:05] don't Cast Away your confidence I could
[1:20:08] preach you today it says from this point
[1:20:09] on you're gonna you're gonna prove
[1:20:11] whether or not you're a daughter of God
[1:20:12] from this day on you're going to prove
[1:20:13] whether or not you're going to be in
[1:20:14] eternity from this down you're going to
[1:20:16] prove whether or not you end up in Hell
[1:20:17] or end up in heaven I just want to
[1:20:19] change the tone just a little bit and
[1:20:20] say whatever you do don't waste the
[1:20:22] opportunities that you have the
[1:20:24] pressures of Life the disappointments
[1:20:26] the Fallen away the sin the abuse
[1:20:28] everything we go through can beat upon
[1:20:30] an individual to the point where they
[1:20:32] just don't they don't want to even go on
[1:20:33] anymore they don't want to go to church
[1:20:35] they don't want to persevere the wait
[1:20:37] has just been too much and the mod has
[1:20:40] just been too much the pond has just
[1:20:41] been too sticky the darkness has been
[1:20:43] just been too great but I say press on
[1:20:46] Lily
[1:20:48] press through all of it don't give up
[1:20:50] don't let it beat you into submission to
[1:20:52] lay out a church to no longer give your
[1:20:54] all to no longer use your gifts but say
[1:20:57] I know there's gold inside of me that
[1:20:59] God is trying to dig out I want to lay
[1:21:01] aside the mud I want to lay aside
[1:21:02] everything else I want to press up to
[1:21:04] the top
[1:21:06] where my full reward will come
[1:21:09] press on with everything that's in you
[1:21:11] I believe that we can do it
[1:21:14] because I know it's in you
[1:21:16] and I want to see you do it let's do it
[1:21:19] together in the meantime
[1:21:21] let's labor for these incentives
[1:21:24] let's do it together
