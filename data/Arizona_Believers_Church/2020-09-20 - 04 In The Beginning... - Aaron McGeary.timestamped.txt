[2:46] control of this service for your glory
[2:47] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[2:49] pray amen
[2:51] amen praise the lord revelations chapter
[2:55] 3
[2:55] verse 14. i'm going to read this
[2:59] and then just jump right into the word
[3:01] revelations chapter 3 verse 14
[3:04] wow powerful atmosphere in here today
[3:07] and i know that by faith we sense that
[3:10] and you wouldn't even have to
[3:14] sense anything necessarily within your
[3:16] spirit as far as an emotion or
[3:18] feel anything in your body as far as
[3:19] some sort of sensation
[3:21] by faith we believe that he's where his
[3:23] elector gathered where two or three are
[3:25] gathered in my name
[3:26] there i am in their midst and so upon
[3:28] that promise alone we can confess
[3:30] god is in our midst and he's promised
[3:32] that he would meet us he promised he'd
[3:34] be with us even in us to the end of the
[3:36] world
[3:36] so we always are confessing that we're
[3:38] always believing that
[3:39] and where he is the supernatural is so
[3:42] we just open our hearts to him to do the
[3:44] supernatural for us today revelations
[3:46] chapter 3 verse 14
[3:48] it says and unto the angel of the church
[3:50] of the laodiceans right
[3:52] and it's remarkable because he does not
[3:53] give himself this
[3:56] designation in any of the other church
[3:58] ages these things saith the amen
[4:01] the faithful and true witness in this
[4:02] part the beginning
[4:04] of the creation of god and wonderful he
[4:07] saved that revelation
[4:09] for the end time the beginning of the
[4:11] creation of god he's expressing
[4:13] something to us
[4:14] in this day a revelation to us in this
[4:16] day to give us confidence
[4:17] who we are in this end time god bless
[4:19] you may be seated
[4:26] we're so happy to see so many of you out
[4:28] to the house of the lord today
[4:30] we trust that you're come just in
[4:31] obedience uh to the the leadership the
[4:34] holy spirit your life
[4:35] even obedience to the word that uh
[4:37] brother brahm says you
[4:38] you can't be a christian and not go to
[4:40] church and
[4:42] so you know you've at least you at least
[4:44] checked that box today
[4:45] but it just doesn't take going to church
[4:47] to be a christian
[4:48] we have to be quickened by the word of
[4:50] the seal of god the baptism of the holy
[4:52] ghost
[4:53] become new creatures in christ jesus and
[4:55] that's our prayer that's our desire is
[4:56] to see
[4:57] uh to see people come to the lord be so
[5:00] soul saved and the
[5:01] and the lost their souls to be caught by
[5:03] the word of god so i trust that you're
[5:05] inspired
[5:06] um to evangelism in this end time
[5:09] not that there's going to be a harvest
[5:11] of thousands but to find that soul
[5:13] that you can touch and reach out to and
[5:16] we're so grateful to be able to announce
[5:18] that today we're going to have a baptism
[5:20] and my son elliot he's 12 years old he's
[5:22] expressed his desire to be baptized
[5:25] and i just thank god for those kind of
[5:27] fruits and
[5:28] so be in prayer for him we'll have a
[5:29] baptismal baptismal this afternoon and
[5:32] we'll give you the information
[5:33] at the end of the service now i want to
[5:36] read genesis chapter 1 verse 1
[5:39] we've just read in the beginning or the
[5:41] beginning of the creation of god
[5:43] and it's designating you read that it's
[5:45] in the red letter in your bible
[5:47] and it's designating christ the word
[5:50] and how he's expressing himself as the
[5:52] amen he's the alpha and omega he's the
[5:54] first and the last
[5:55] the faithful and true witness the
[5:57] beginning of the creation of god
[5:59] and then we could back up into the
[6:01] middle of the book and we see that john
[6:02] writes in the beginning was the word
[6:05] and now we go all the way back to the
[6:07] beginning of the bible it says in the
[6:09] beginning
[6:09] god created the heaven and the earth
[6:12] we've been focusing on
[6:13] the beginning and specifically what has
[6:16] been represented in the creation of the
[6:18] heaven and the earth
[6:20] and i want to just read a few things a
[6:22] few statements to
[6:23] recap kind of the trajectory that we've
[6:26] been on to this point
[6:27] and how that we've identified in the
[6:29] word of god how that jesus christ was
[6:32] the union of heaven and earth
[6:34] so there was a blending and a fusion of
[6:37] divinity and humanity
[6:39] in jesus christ and brother branham
[6:41] pointed out to us that that
[6:42] is the beginning of the creation of god
[6:45] and he makes this statement when god
[6:47] created himself a body
[6:49] and come down and lived in it that's the
[6:51] beginning
[6:52] of the creation of god now god himself
[6:55] cannot be created because he's an
[6:56] eternal being
[6:57] so there couldn't be nothing and then
[6:59] god was created that just doesn't make
[7:01] sense
[7:02] even in terms of the scripture and it
[7:05] certainly doesn't make sense in terms of
[7:06] science
[7:07] science has definitively concluded and
[7:09] they're very certain about this
[7:11] that you cannot get something from
[7:13] nothing so in order for there to be
[7:15] something
[7:15] there had to be something before it so
[7:17] only something can from
[7:19] come from something that's always been
[7:20] in that scientific principle alone
[7:23] they must believe that everything
[7:24] creation came from or what we know today
[7:26] came from something
[7:28] that had always been because you can't
[7:30] get something from nothing so there's
[7:32] god the eternal
[7:33] existing uh by himself he is el ella
[7:36] elohim
[7:37] he is a strong one he's the
[7:40] self-existing one
[7:41] and then he doesn't create himself in
[7:43] this scripture
[7:44] but the other it's the beginning of
[7:46] god's creation so god is now creating
[7:49] something
[7:50] and this is an expression of himself
[7:52] brother branham says it again this way
[7:54] he is the beginning of the creation of
[7:56] god
[7:56] and god is eternal but when god created
[7:59] a little baby that was conceived in the
[8:00] womb of a virgin
[8:02] and she began to develop these cells
[8:04] within her to bring forth this little
[8:06] baby
[8:06] that was the beginning of god's creation
[8:10] and that is then looking at how jesus
[8:13] christ himself
[8:14] is the beginning of the creation of god
[8:17] so this is a new creation
[8:18] this is a different creation and then
[8:21] brother branham makes this statement and
[8:22] christ is revealed in his own word he
[8:24] says god was in the beginning
[8:26] and he kept coming down through the
[8:28] prophets and on down
[8:29] until god himself became human like us
[8:32] plumbed down at the foot of the ladder a
[8:35] baby born in a manger
[8:36] hated rejected despised a bad name in
[8:38] everything he was
[8:40] so you could look at this image of how
[8:41] that god was in the beginning
[8:44] and he has been condescending down from
[8:46] the very moment that he formed himself
[8:47] into the logos
[8:48] to when he created heaven and earth and
[8:50] then the days of creation and then even
[8:52] all through the new test of the old
[8:53] testament
[8:54] it is god descending down and he says
[8:57] once he's come into jesus christ
[9:00] he comes down to the foot of the ladder
[9:02] and now god has expressed himself
[9:04] in his son just as he had desired to do
[9:07] in the very beginning
[9:08] he says then he started rising and from
[9:11] the feet he began to build
[9:13] the church the bride coming on back and
[9:16] now coming out into the headstone
[9:18] where it all joins together and makes
[9:20] one great transfigured body
[9:22] of jesus christ so he looks at it as
[9:25] christ
[9:25] is god condescended down into christ now
[9:28] he's saying that god who came down from
[9:30] the heaven to the earth
[9:32] now god's bringing earth up to the
[9:33] heavens just as there's been a
[9:35] condescending down of god now there's an
[9:37] ascension of humanity
[9:39] and so as the heavenly had become
[9:40] earthly now the earthly is becoming
[9:43] heavenly
[9:44] and that's the process that's taking
[9:45] place even through the church ages it's
[9:47] god taking humanity
[9:49] and raising it up to be seated in
[9:50] heavenly places in christ jesus
[9:53] so god was at the beginning
[9:54] condescending down into earth
[9:56] and now he is rising bringing earth up
[9:58] into heaven
[9:59] so the beginning of the creation of god
[10:01] is jesus christ
[10:03] and then he expresses this in the church
[10:06] age book chapter 9
[10:08] to where we're looking at now not just
[10:10] jesus christ as the beginning of the
[10:11] creation of god
[10:13] but this part that is rising is also
[10:15] part
[10:16] of the beginning of the creation of god
[10:18] he said this is another creation
[10:20] this has nothing to do with the church
[10:23] this is a special designation
[10:25] of himself so it's not the church but a
[10:27] designation of himself
[10:30] and let me just express this we're all
[10:31] family here today
[10:33] and so if something goes haywire with
[10:34] the sound i'm not going to be
[10:36] embarrassed so you don't need to be
[10:37] embarrassed
[10:38] if the string cuts off we apologize to
[10:40] all the streamers
[10:41] but what's important is that the word is
[10:43] preached in person
[10:44] to you who are here so we're family so
[10:47] if you get tired you need to stand up
[10:48] it's not going to bother me
[10:50] if the baby starts crying it's sweet
[10:51] music to my ears we're all comfortable
[10:53] we're all family no one should be
[10:55] nervous hey guess what we don't even
[10:57] have deacons
[10:58] to grab you by the ear and pull you out
[11:00] and say you tell you what you better
[11:01] keep that kid quiet
[11:02] we're just all family here and we're
[11:04] just gathered around the word of the
[11:05] lord so
[11:06] you just relax and don't be nervous or
[11:08] worried if this is your first time
[11:10] we're gathered around the word there's
[11:11] no complexes there's no fears there's no
[11:13] worries
[11:14] just let the word have preeminence so
[11:16] this is the beginning of the creation of
[11:18] god
[11:18] this is the scripture he's referring to
[11:20] revelations 3 14 this is another
[11:22] creation
[11:23] and remember brother brown said when the
[11:24] woman came out of adam
[11:26] she was not another creation he said
[11:28] because she had
[11:29] been had she been another creation she
[11:31] would have been greater
[11:33] so that's a principle that brother
[11:34] branham places within the word of god
[11:37] so as to understand that if god ever
[11:39] creates again
[11:40] it's got to be greater so now in jesus
[11:42] christ it's something greater
[11:44] it's a further evolution of himself a
[11:46] further evolution of god which was
[11:48] prefigured or foreshadowed in adam
[11:50] but now it's a another creation and this
[11:52] one is not a church
[11:54] but it's a special designation he says
[11:57] this has to do with the church
[11:58] this is a special designation of himself
[12:01] i read it incorrectly a moment ago
[12:03] this has to do with the church this is a
[12:05] special designation of himself
[12:07] he is the creator of that church the
[12:10] heavenly bridegroom created his own
[12:12] bride
[12:13] so it's not just jesus christ but now
[12:15] it's his wife
[12:16] it's the bride so it's not just creating
[12:18] the man that's creating the woman again
[12:20] or bringing forth the woman from that
[12:22] creation he says he was of the new
[12:24] creation
[12:25] man and god met and joined he was the
[12:27] first of this new race
[12:29] he is the head of this new race
[12:32] this is the this is this new creation
[12:36] and i'm just reading these statements
[12:37] just to gather this all together so we
[12:38] can go forward
[12:40] this new creation is not the old
[12:41] creation made over or it could not be
[12:43] called a new creation
[12:45] aren't you glad that when you become a
[12:47] new creature in christ jesus
[12:48] you're not just the old person with the
[12:50] band-aid on
[12:52] i'm so glad that when i was born again
[12:54] by the baptismal he goes
[12:56] he didn't just pick me up and clean me
[12:58] up and put a band-aid on my wounds but
[13:00] he made me a new person
[13:02] and he made me such a new person on the
[13:04] inside that my
[13:06] soul is in an eternal condition now by
[13:09] the baptism of the holy ghost
[13:11] and in reality nothing can be added to
[13:13] my soul to make it any more perfect
[13:15] it is already in an eight day eternal
[13:18] condition
[13:19] and when we stumble in our spirits make
[13:21] mistakes in our flesh when we
[13:23] backslide when whatever is that we do we
[13:25] might get a little bit cold
[13:26] our soul remains there as a reminder
[13:29] that it's greater than whatever we
[13:30] experience in our bodies whatever we
[13:32] experience in our spirits
[13:33] and it reminds you that you are
[13:35] quickened you are raised you are not the
[13:37] old person
[13:38] patched up you are a new creature in
[13:40] christ jesus
[13:41] and so we need to become disciplined in
[13:43] confessing from our souls
[13:45] that when our minds begin to doubt when
[13:47] we experience difficulties when even our
[13:49] bodies are sick
[13:50] you say body the fact that you're sick
[13:52] is no testimony that i'm not a daughter
[13:54] of god
[13:55] in my soul i'm well in my soul i'm
[13:58] healed
[13:58] and my soul actually has a new body
[14:01] within
[14:02] it that's going to be developed around
[14:04] this body
[14:06] and you just confess that you anchor in
[14:08] them so he says we are a new creation
[14:10] not the old one patched up
[14:11] he says or it could be called a new
[14:13] creation this is exactly what it says
[14:15] new creation it is another creation
[14:17] distinct from the old one
[14:19] so this is what puts you in harmony with
[14:21] jesus christ
[14:22] so he says he is the first of that
[14:24] creation he was god
[14:26] created in the form of man now by his
[14:29] spirit
[14:30] he's creating many sons unto himself
[14:33] otherwise the bible could not call him
[14:35] the first born among many brethren
[14:38] notice the bible does not say the
[14:39] firstborn among many
[14:40] step brothers half brothers
[14:44] doesn't say it it's brethren he is the
[14:46] first born among many so he is
[14:48] uh the being the firstborn among many
[14:50] there are certain things rights
[14:52] attributes characteristics in the law of
[14:53] the firstborn
[14:54] that would be attributed to christ and
[14:56] now he's saying that there's many
[14:58] that are also born of the same word and
[15:01] the same spirit
[15:02] says their god now has by his spirit his
[15:04] creating sons and to himself
[15:06] god the creator creating himself a part
[15:09] of his creation
[15:11] right let's just be honest with
[15:13] ourselves it's hard to kind of get your
[15:14] head around that
[15:16] god the creator created himself a part
[15:18] of his creation
[15:19] this is the true revelation of god this
[15:22] was his purpose
[15:23] not just to have a son christ jesus but
[15:26] to have many sons and daughters like him
[15:28] to himself
[15:29] this is the true revelation of god this
[15:31] was his purpose we understand that this
[15:33] great home of the bride is to be here
[15:35] on earth and i want to
[15:39] take just a a kind of a detour for a few
[15:41] moments
[15:43] and i've pondered this deeply over these
[15:45] these weeks as we've
[15:46] thought about these things the the
[15:49] burden of the word
[15:50] that's expressed in approaching the
[15:52] subject of in the beginning
[15:54] it's not just to have a new take on
[15:56] genesis chapter one not just to fill
[15:58] your head with
[15:59] with types and and shadows listen you
[16:02] don't ever see a type and then build a
[16:03] truth around it you can only use types
[16:05] once you see the truth
[16:07] so if we use a scripture as a type it's
[16:09] only because i'm pointing you to a truth
[16:11] that we already know in the word of god
[16:13] but that's not the purpose of the
[16:14] exercise the burden is so that you would
[16:16] recognize
[16:17] who you are the burden is so that you
[16:20] can see yourself in the mirror of
[16:22] god's word and read this bible as a way
[16:25] of saying this bible is trying to
[16:27] communicate to me
[16:28] who i am for the moment that i'm living
[16:30] in right now
[16:32] not trying to communicate to you
[16:33] something where you're just merely
[16:34] reading a history or even communicate to
[16:36] you something so that you can
[16:38] look forward to something else but to
[16:40] give you boldness for the moment that
[16:41] we're living in
[16:42] right now so that we can overcome the
[16:45] challenges that we're experiencing right
[16:46] now
[16:46] and meet the mark of this age right now
[16:49] god is wanting you to see yourself in
[16:51] the mirror of god's word
[16:52] so that you can say if this is what i
[16:54] was and this is what i'm going to be
[16:56] then i must be that right now that
[16:59] unbroken continuity
[17:01] of the word that has been and the word
[17:03] that will be is the word that
[17:05] is now the same yesterday today and
[17:07] forever
[17:08] and there's so many pressures upon us so
[17:11] many distractions
[17:13] there's there's junctures of time even
[17:15] naturally there's events that are taking
[17:17] place politically
[17:18] that there's there's things that are
[17:20] taking place globally in terms of a
[17:21] pandemic
[17:22] there's social pressure there's
[17:24] political pressure there's great changes
[17:25] in shifting in economies
[17:27] and this is globally and there's a lot
[17:29] of unrest
[17:30] uh even here at home especially here in
[17:32] the united states and we're conscious of
[17:34] that
[17:35] uh we're we're in tune to the the
[17:37] political things around us the social
[17:39] things around us
[17:40] and it's very difficult for us to not be
[17:43] impacted by
[17:45] uh them and no matter how much we preach
[17:47] faith you would never want to be
[17:48] dismissive
[17:49] that there's things that are taking
[17:50] place in the world today that directly
[17:52] impact us
[17:53] uh there's things that are going to
[17:55] affect us and there's things that
[17:56] decisions that are made and
[17:58] turns that take place in our life that
[17:59] are out of our control that are natural
[18:02] that impact us and so we wouldn't want
[18:03] to be remiss and say just pull yourself
[18:05] up by your bootstraps ignore it get over
[18:07] it
[18:07] the word is the same but what we want to
[18:09] do as believers
[18:10] is see how the word addresses those
[18:12] things around us
[18:14] see how that modern events are already
[18:15] being made clear to us by prophecy we
[18:17] can place them where they are in
[18:18] scripture
[18:19] and that gives us confidence as jesus
[18:21] said i'm telling you now what's going to
[18:23] happen so that when it happens you can
[18:24] have comfort
[18:26] that i told you beforehand and we can go
[18:28] into the word of god and see
[18:29] we've been warned beforehand these
[18:30] things would happen and it gives us
[18:32] confidence that god
[18:33] already warned us therefore he's made
[18:35] provision for us
[18:37] and in the message recognizing your day
[18:39] and its message
[18:40] brother branham's using this language of
[18:44] national force so we could say political
[18:46] force economic force
[18:48] social force political force national
[18:51] force put israel in her homeland
[18:53] and we see that through a a war through
[18:56] the hand of
[18:57] of perverse men who brought a a a
[19:00] genocide
[19:01] upon a people and and through that what
[19:05] was called even termed the holocaust
[19:08] which which happened you got to be
[19:09] careful that you don't give yourself
[19:10] over to conspiracy theories
[19:12] because then you just go right into a
[19:13] path where you just start denying things
[19:15] that are scriptural things that are in
[19:16] the word of god
[19:17] and so the holocaust that takes place
[19:20] and to be able to call it the tender
[19:22] hand of jehovah
[19:23] is absolutely astounding but what was it
[19:25] it was god allowing national force
[19:27] because god deals with israel after the
[19:29] flesh
[19:30] to put israel back in a natural land and
[19:32] because it was a natural land there's
[19:34] natural forces that took
[19:36] all these jews scattered all around the
[19:37] world and forced them back into their
[19:40] natural land
[19:41] he says national forests will put the
[19:43] church in the world council of churches
[19:46] so natural things national forest
[19:48] politics
[19:49] economic social pressure all sorts of
[19:52] natural things will put the church
[19:54] in the world council of churches just as
[19:56] it put israel in their homeland
[19:57] he says but this is where we come in
[20:01] the power of god will put the people in
[20:03] the bride
[20:05] natural force won't do it political
[20:07] pressure is not going to put one member
[20:08] of your family
[20:09] into the bride economic pressure will
[20:12] not put any member of your family in the
[20:14] bride
[20:14] your own personal pressure upon them
[20:16] will not put them in the bride
[20:18] the power of god will put the people in
[20:21] the bride
[20:22] he said the world force is this way the
[20:24] world force is that way but god forces
[20:26] upward the spirit of god which is the
[20:29] word of god my word is spirit and life
[20:31] so the word is the spirit
[20:33] will put the bride in her
[20:36] place in the beginning god created the
[20:39] heaven and the earth and the earth was
[20:40] without form and void and darkness was
[20:42] upon the face of the deep
[20:44] and the spirit of god moved upon the
[20:46] face of the waters
[20:48] this is now god now showing that the
[20:50] word the spirit of god which is the word
[20:51] of god
[20:52] that's what moves upon darkness that's
[20:54] what moves upon chaos
[20:55] that's what moves upon the void that's
[20:57] what moves upon the brokenness and the
[20:59] darkness
[21:00] and then brings something out of it it
[21:02] doesn't take natural force it doesn't
[21:04] take national force but it takes the
[21:06] word of god to move upon something
[21:08] and he says it will put the bride in her
[21:10] place
[21:13] she'll recognize her position in the
[21:15] word by what the word of god
[21:17] then she's in christ it'll put her in
[21:19] her place no
[21:21] national force will do it but national
[21:23] force did drive israel to the homeland
[21:26] national forces of the world council
[21:27] churches council churches will drive
[21:29] every organization into it so we see
[21:32] national forests doing its part
[21:36] and god will use natural things in our
[21:37] lives there's things that get our
[21:39] attention even our emotions and there's
[21:41] ways that god gets our attention but at
[21:42] the end of the day
[21:43] it's the word of god that puts us in our
[21:45] place
[21:47] there can be all sorts of uh things
[21:49] transpired in our lives to turn
[21:51] turn our lives upside down and cause us
[21:53] to rethink what's going on and
[21:55] cause great harm and it could be a loss
[21:57] of a job it could be uh
[21:58] interpersonal relationships it could be
[22:00] a lot of things that are taking place
[22:01] things getting turned upside down
[22:03] and it could be getting people's
[22:04] attention oh my lord i want to be in
[22:06] your graces i want to be in your will i
[22:08] and even a desire to surrender yourself
[22:10] to the lord and and you can look at all
[22:12] these external things that are getting
[22:13] your attention but if you
[22:15] don't come and surrender yourself to the
[22:17] word of god
[22:18] you'll still be subject to the same
[22:20] forces
[22:23] and those same forces that put you in
[22:24] that state of anxiety
[22:26] to come to church and to try to serve
[22:28] god if you haven't yielded yourself to
[22:30] the power of god
[22:31] those very same forces can then work on
[22:33] you to get you right back out of church
[22:35] again
[22:36] because it's not those things that
[22:38] ultimately lurk upon the believer
[22:39] it is yielding ourselves to the power of
[22:41] god he says but the power of god will
[22:43] raise the bride
[22:44] into glory out of it it's the power of
[22:47] god to raise the bride
[22:48] into glory out of the out of the
[22:50] churches out of laodicea
[22:52] out of these things that we see around
[22:53] us
[22:55] the power of god will put the bride in
[22:57] her place
[22:58] and the statement is used so frequently
[23:00] i think it begins to lose its meaning
[23:02] and i don't want to join my voice with
[23:04] all those
[23:04] who are repeating it just so that it
[23:06] dulls our ears to the significance of it
[23:08] but when brother brahma is preaching
[23:10] christ as the mystery of god revealed
[23:12] which is which is just the silence from
[23:15] that seventh seal being lifted
[23:17] and it's been very directed towards the
[23:19] bride it's a message speaking directly
[23:21] to her
[23:22] to understand who she is and he says if
[23:24] the church only knew its position
[23:27] and this isn't just knows it's it's it's
[23:29] nomination
[23:30] but a full understanding of where it's
[23:33] placed
[23:33] he says it will one day then the rapture
[23:36] will go when it knows what it is
[23:38] so there's a there's a power that comes
[23:39] with the position he says oh if it only
[23:41] knew its position why the power of god
[23:44] is wanting to place the church
[23:45] in her position to recognize her
[23:48] position in the word
[23:49] and that that's gonna force her upwards
[23:53] oh if the church only knew its position
[23:56] he says this
[23:57] in 1957 see if the church so if the
[23:59] church only knew its position
[24:01] he says and the greatest hindrance in
[24:03] the church is fear
[24:05] they're afraid that it just won't work
[24:07] he says well
[24:08] it just won't for you that way it just
[24:10] will not work
[24:11] that way it must be absolutely believers
[24:14] he says not make believers but believers
[24:16] from
[24:16] the heart so the hindrance upon the
[24:20] church
[24:20] he says the greatest hindrance is fear
[24:22] he said it's the worst thing the devil
[24:23] could put on you is fear
[24:25] why there can be a confession of faith
[24:28] but if it's mixed with doubt it hinders
[24:31] that
[24:32] it it weakens your resolve it causes you
[24:35] to place your faith
[24:36] in a state of advance well it's kind of
[24:38] on pause well i believe but
[24:39] we believe but he's saying no it's not
[24:41] going to work for you that way
[24:43] we need to know our position without
[24:45] qualification
[24:46] we need to know our position without any
[24:49] kind of contingencies and to abandon
[24:50] ourselves
[24:51] to the place that god has called us to
[24:53] say lord you've called me to this this
[24:55] is what i am this is what the bible says
[24:57] about me
[24:57] and any voice of doubt or reason that
[24:59] comes to speak up you just say sit down
[25:01] sit down sit down this is what the word
[25:04] has to say about me
[25:05] and you're just telling every voice to
[25:06] quiet down
[25:09] and know your position and not allow a
[25:11] voice of reason a voice of history a
[25:12] voice of affection whatever it might be
[25:14] to bring up fear and cause you to doubt
[25:16] because it's hindering your faith
[25:20] and there's the the message comes and it
[25:22] tries to attack
[25:23] i say it tries it attacks and addresses
[25:26] this fear that brother abraham
[25:26] brethren's talking about
[25:28] in the sermon the god rich in mercy he
[25:30] says now
[25:31] we are a part of god you always was
[25:35] you don't remember it because you were
[25:36] only an attribute in god
[25:38] you were only in his thinking your very
[25:41] name
[25:42] if it was ever on the book of life it
[25:44] was put there before
[25:46] the foundation of the world he knew what
[25:49] you were
[25:50] he says i'm only saying this not to mix
[25:53] up doctrine but to straighten it out
[25:55] that we might get away from this fear
[25:58] and scare
[26:00] the doctrine of election the doctrine of
[26:02] predestination
[26:03] is it's one that the devil wants to
[26:05] muddy solely
[26:06] cause confusion on always leave the door
[26:09] open for you're in and then you're out
[26:11] but brother brahms trying to nail it
[26:13] down you were always a part of god
[26:17] and the reason why he's trying to nail
[26:18] this down is not to mix up
[26:20] doctrine but to straighten up doctrine
[26:23] and by straightening up
[26:24] doctrine he says it will help us to get
[26:26] away from this fear and scare
[26:29] and so if the church only knew its
[26:31] position and the greatest hindrance on
[26:33] the church today is
[26:34] fear fear of taking that position fear
[26:38] of believing there's some weakness in
[26:40] that position so the word is saying
[26:41] you're in this place from before the
[26:43] foundation of the world
[26:45] and i'm wanting to teach this i'm
[26:46] wanting to straighten this out so you
[26:48] can get away from fear and scare he says
[26:49] you don't know who you are
[26:51] you're not going to be but now you are
[26:54] the sons of god
[26:55] you always were the sons of god for when
[26:58] god had you in his thinking
[27:00] at the beginning we're going all the way
[27:03] back to the beginning to understand that
[27:05] what has unfolded from genesis chapter 1
[27:07] verse 1
[27:08] to today is not coincidence it's not
[27:10] happenstance
[27:11] it's not just the the the lottery that's
[27:14] resulted in where we are today and we
[27:16] see the confusion the chaos and all the
[27:18] uncertainty like oh
[27:19] where is this handed where is it going
[27:20] what's the end going to be god can say
[27:22] i have thoughts about you that i've had
[27:24] from the beginning
[27:26] thoughts of peace to bring you to a
[27:28] determined end
[27:29] to bring you to a place of safety to
[27:31] bring you to a place of at rest
[27:33] and in the last days to bring a great
[27:35] triumph and a great glory
[27:37] in the midst of great darkness
[27:40] don't worry about all the fear and scare
[27:42] don't worry about the economics don't
[27:44] worry about the politics
[27:45] don't worry about all the things that
[27:46] are being said to cause hindrance to
[27:48] cause doubt he says get away from the
[27:50] fear and scare
[27:51] this is where you're tied to not branham
[27:53] tabernacle not to a church
[27:54] not to a man but to god who in the
[27:56] beginning had you in his thinking
[28:00] he says you have to be some part of you
[28:02] your life that's in you now had to be
[28:04] with god
[28:05] before there well before he was even
[28:08] become material
[28:10] here on earth before it was anything
[28:13] god you were one of his attributes he
[28:15] knowed what your name would be
[28:18] and it continues on talking about even
[28:19] the color of hair the color of your eyes
[28:22] he knew what it would be so it gives me
[28:25] confidence that he liked he liked
[28:27] if you like the color of my hair maybe
[28:29] he likes the thinness of it
[28:31] and i can save save money on not having
[28:33] to go out and get a hair transplant
[28:35] and different things say lord as brother
[28:38] said i haven't lost to one
[28:39] amen listen in christ there's nothing
[28:41] you haven't lost here that you haven't
[28:43] already gained there
[28:44] 100 fold is going to be restored back to
[28:46] you let's not wring our hands and fret
[28:49] and worry and be anxious just have this
[28:51] attitude god's in control
[28:53] god's looking out after this what was
[28:55] one of the things that creeped into the
[28:56] church that caused its demise
[28:58] how can we protect this great truth you
[29:01] don't need to go into protection mode
[29:03] god's the watcher god's the keeper
[29:06] there's a there's a little security sign
[29:07] in front of my house that we're renting
[29:09] it says
[29:09] i think it says adt no and this is no
[29:12] commentary on security systems but it
[29:13] said this house is protected by adt
[29:16] and i wanted to put on there this house
[29:17] is protected
[29:19] uh by the scripture it says if the
[29:20] watchman if god doesn't watch the house
[29:22] the watchman watcheth in vain
[29:24] that's who we're trusting in so the
[29:26] watchmen still watch
[29:29] doesn't say god watches the city the
[29:31] watchmen don't watch we still watch
[29:33] but we're trusting that god's watching
[29:34] also lest our watching is not in vain
[29:37] that's who we're trusting in
[29:38] that's who we're believing in and so
[29:40] when brother branham brings us to this
[29:42] your life that's in you now had to be
[29:44] with god before
[29:45] there even before he become material on
[29:48] earth before there was anything
[29:49] you were in him this isn't just this is
[29:53] to show us that it's not just god being
[29:55] expressed in creation
[29:58] if there's something being squeezed out
[30:00] something being portrayed
[30:02] then you are being expressed as being a
[30:04] part of him
[30:06] you are a part of him so as god begins
[30:08] to express himself in his creation
[30:10] let's identify with that creation
[30:14] and now that's uh i want to just take a
[30:16] step further in this
[30:19] and um if i know it may seem to be a
[30:21] little bit hot it's hotter on this side
[30:23] of the room than it is that side
[30:25] uh and uh so i don't know if uh if this
[30:28] is
[30:28] if this is like the the valley and and
[30:30] that's the
[30:31] i mean you're facing east i think that
[30:33] works out well i think
[30:34] maybe you're not facing these i don't
[30:36] know which direction you're facing but
[30:38] listen to this now as we want to look at
[30:40] genesis 1. and i i realize i'm going to
[30:42] have to start
[30:43] maybe uh going a little bit quicker here
[30:46] and so i'll make reference to these
[30:48] things instead of reading it in the book
[30:49] of genesis genesis chapter 1
[30:51] details god creating the physical
[30:55] visible realm that the earth exists
[30:58] within
[31:00] and so this is now god creating this
[31:02] this
[31:03] atmosphere and firmament and the and
[31:06] galaxies and
[31:07] and universes that the earth exists
[31:10] within it's what's
[31:11] physical it's what's visible it is what
[31:14] is observable that's what science is
[31:15] observing even
[31:16] with their telescopes and their
[31:19] satellites they're observing the
[31:20] physical
[31:21] creation that the earth exists within
[31:23] regardless of how expansive that is
[31:25] genesis chapter 1 is describing that
[31:28] expanse
[31:29] and detailing the creation of this
[31:31] physical
[31:32] visible realm that this earth exists
[31:34] within
[31:35] and as we've been reading in the
[31:37] beginning god created the heavens and
[31:38] the earth and we read verse two
[31:40] we've made reference to that we've
[31:41] looked at that in some detail
[31:43] i want to look at verses three and four
[31:45] and god said
[31:46] let there be light and there was light
[31:50] and god saw the light that it was good
[31:53] and god divided the light from darkness
[31:56] now as we've seen already that in these
[31:59] first two verses something's being
[32:00] expressed to us
[32:01] that portrays an uh a a reality in our
[32:05] own personal lives whether we identify
[32:07] with the
[32:07] the void and darkness of chapter two and
[32:10] the spirit of god moving upon those
[32:11] elements to change them and to bring
[32:13] forth a new creation
[32:15] but we also identify with the heaven and
[32:16] the earth there's different ways that
[32:18] we've
[32:18] we've identified this now in verses
[32:20] three and four
[32:21] something is being expressed to us for
[32:24] our
[32:24] benefit and i want to go through a few
[32:28] um elements just to a few principles
[32:31] that i'm just kind of laying down and
[32:32] there's a part of me that likes to
[32:34] uh and you may have experienced this
[32:36] before to take one point
[32:37] and just drill it down to where you just
[32:39] kind of exhaust every quote every
[32:40] scripture you nail it down where it's
[32:42] airtight and like well you can't
[32:43] disagree with that
[32:44] that's exactly what that means but i
[32:46] just want to make reference to these
[32:47] things very quickly
[32:49] just to understand these building blocks
[32:51] light represents life
[32:53] so in the beginning god said let there
[32:57] be light
[32:58] and there was light so light represents
[33:00] life
[33:01] and light came by the spoken word god
[33:04] said let there be light and there was
[33:06] light so light came by the spoken word
[33:09] and the word now characterizes it god
[33:12] saw the light
[33:13] and now it characterizes the light as
[33:15] good
[33:16] so the spoken word bring for brings
[33:19] forth light
[33:20] and then the word says that light is
[33:22] good so that's the characterization of
[33:24] light
[33:25] now to substantiate that light is
[33:28] equated with life brother brahman says
[33:29] in the message turn on the light
[33:31] no life can come outside of light
[33:34] light produces life there could be no
[33:37] life outside of light
[33:38] natural or spiritual there must be and
[33:42] only light can come by the word of god
[33:44] god's word is the light when it's
[33:47] manifested
[33:48] now that's a mouthful god's word is
[33:50] light
[33:51] when it's manifested so when the word is
[33:53] manifested
[33:54] that's light when the word is manifested
[33:57] and it's light then that's what brings
[33:59] life because a life comes by light
[34:01] that's natural and spiritual
[34:03] he says in looking under jesus only
[34:05] god's word produces
[34:07] light he says in a man that can turn on
[34:10] the light he says
[34:11] these are just principles i'll just
[34:12] summarize very quickly that light comes
[34:14] by the spoken word
[34:15] and without light nothing can live
[34:18] so light comes by the spoken word and
[34:20] then with light
[34:22] comes life he says in christ is the
[34:24] mystery god revealed the word only has
[34:26] life
[34:27] says again just in a little bit after
[34:29] that the word produces
[34:31] its own life so when god says in the
[34:34] beginning
[34:35] god said let there be light and there
[34:37] was light
[34:38] and it was characterized as good he's
[34:41] taking light
[34:42] and he's associating it with the word
[34:44] which is life
[34:46] light is life this is good
[34:50] and once the light is manifested then
[34:53] darkness is exposed
[34:56] to this point there there's there's now
[34:58] going to be a distinction
[35:00] where there's going to be a division if
[35:02] all you knew was darkness it said well
[35:03] this is darkness it's just the reality
[35:05] but then once light comes and once light
[35:07] begins to be expressed
[35:09] there's a contrast between light and
[35:11] darkness
[35:12] and darkness now represents death
[35:16] when god sees the light he characterizes
[35:19] it as
[35:20] good and he says and he separated the
[35:22] light divided the light from the
[35:24] darkness
[35:25] so he's dividing good from bad
[35:28] good from evil as you might say so it
[35:30] stands darkness stands opposite to light
[35:34] and it's created because of light
[35:38] and and i think that's maybe uh that
[35:40] might be a clumsy way of saying it and i
[35:42] and i
[35:42] i can do that both personally and behind
[35:44] the pulpit maybe use a real clumsy way
[35:46] of asking a question a real clunky way
[35:48] of expressing something
[35:49] but if you could understand this that
[35:52] darkness we gain
[35:53] understanding of what darkness is in
[35:55] light of light
[35:57] so there's something that darkness is
[35:58] made manifest by light
[36:00] and in ephesians even says that
[36:02] whatsoever dust just make manifest
[36:04] is light now in isaiah chapter 45
[36:07] verse 7 and i know i'm throwing a lot
[36:10] out there and i apologize for that
[36:13] the the in the beginning god said let
[36:15] there be light
[36:16] light came by the spoken word and by
[36:19] light comes
[36:20] life and god says that is good
[36:24] he says that is good so then he says
[36:27] this in isaiah 45 verse 7 so that we can
[36:29] see the difference between
[36:31] as god divided the light from darkness
[36:34] so that we can see this
[36:35] he says i form the light
[36:39] so god says i form the light light is
[36:42] formed
[36:42] because it comes from the word but now
[36:44] it says and
[36:45] create darkness now and i'm not just
[36:48] trying to be patent or
[36:50] you know take differences in words and
[36:52] try to make a point that that isn't
[36:53] relevant and
[36:55] and bring us down a path that really has
[36:57] no substance to it
[36:58] but i believe it's a distinction that is
[37:00] important that
[37:02] god forms light from himself or from the
[37:05] spoken word
[37:06] god said let there be and there was yes
[37:09] it's a creation
[37:10] but it's a further expression from
[37:12] something that is existing that's
[37:14] already there which is god
[37:15] but then he says and i create darkness
[37:17] so darkness is created
[37:19] and it comes from a and i know this
[37:21] distinction may not make
[37:23] much sense right now but it's something
[37:25] separate now i
[37:26] form light i create darkness these are
[37:28] two different words that are being used
[37:29] it says i make peace and create evil i
[37:32] the lord do all these things
[37:35] so light is formed it comes by the
[37:37] spoken word of god but then
[37:39] once light is formed darkness is created
[37:42] and whereas light is equated with good
[37:45] darkness is equated with evil
[37:47] i form the light i make peace i create
[37:50] darkness i make dark create darkness and
[37:52] create evil so darkness is associated
[37:54] with evil darkness is associated with
[37:56] those things that are bad
[37:58] light is associated with good life and
[38:01] peace so then when jesus christ comes in
[38:04] matthew chapter 4 verse 16
[38:06] the people which sat in darkness saw
[38:08] great light and to them which sat
[38:11] in the region in shadow of death light
[38:14] is
[38:15] sprung up so people are sitting in
[38:17] darkness under the shadow of death and
[38:19] what happens
[38:19] a great light comes people are sitting
[38:22] in darkness and under the shadow of
[38:23] death
[38:23] light is sprung up that's the answer to
[38:26] death
[38:26] that's the answer to darkness you're not
[38:28] going to get life out of death you're
[38:30] not going to get darkness
[38:31] light out of darkness light comes life
[38:33] comes as opposed to
[38:35] death and darkness so just like it was
[38:37] in the beginning where there was
[38:39] darkness and there was void and there
[38:40] was
[38:41] depravity the spirit of god begins to
[38:43] move upon the face of the waters god
[38:45] says
[38:45] let there be light and there was light
[38:47] and now darkness has a distinction
[38:49] darkness stands in contrast to light and
[38:52] what is it it's
[38:52] light springing up where there was a
[38:54] shadow of death it's light springing up
[38:56] where there was darkness
[38:58] so when christ comes we see once again
[39:00] just as heaven and earth in genesis
[39:02] chapter 1 verse 1
[39:03] when christ came heaven and earth
[39:05] embraced they kissed now we see again
[39:07] with christ
[39:08] it's reviving what was happening in the
[39:10] beginning light has sprung up when
[39:12] christ comes
[39:14] and brother banham says this about
[39:15] darkness he says what is satan
[39:17] anything contrary to the word he doesn't
[39:20] have salvation
[39:21] he doesn't have light his kingdom is
[39:23] darkness in the end thereof is death
[39:25] darkness and death are satan's kingdom
[39:28] and i like this brother brown repeat it
[39:30] again what is satan's kingdom
[39:31] anything contrary to the word of god
[39:34] death and darkness are contrary to the
[39:36] word which is
[39:36] life and light
[39:40] darkness and death are satan's kingdom
[39:42] so what's being portrayed in genesis
[39:44] chapter 1 verses 3 and 4
[39:46] is not merely an account of how that god
[39:50] brings forth life and brings forth
[39:51] creation and sets the stage for the
[39:53] garden of eden
[39:54] but god's expressing something in this
[39:57] god's identifying
[39:58] light from darkness separating them it's
[40:01] john chapter 1 verses 1 to 5.
[40:03] in the beginning was the word and the
[40:04] word was with god and the word was god
[40:06] the same was in the beginning with god
[40:08] all things were made by
[40:10] him the word which is god and without
[40:11] him was not anything made that was made
[40:14] in him was life in the life was the
[40:17] light
[40:17] of men and the light shineth in darkness
[40:21] and the darkness comprehended it not and
[40:24] it says john
[40:25] came to bear witness of that light john
[40:27] wasn't the light
[40:28] so even in this day just as john bore
[40:31] witness of the light and he himself was
[40:33] not the light
[40:34] in this hour any minister of god or any
[40:37] prophet is
[40:38] not the light but they bear witness of
[40:40] the light
[40:42] and so this scripture is showing once
[40:44] again in the beginning was the word
[40:47] and life is the light of the light of
[40:49] men is a life the light shines in
[40:51] darkness
[40:52] is shown in darkness in genesis 1 is
[40:54] shining in darkness in the days of
[40:56] christ
[40:56] on earth and the darkness cannot be
[40:58] penetrated by it
[41:00] but yet it's still shining so darkness
[41:03] does not have the capacity though
[41:06] the darker the color the more light it
[41:07] absorbs it does not
[41:09] absorb the light to its demise it lacks
[41:12] the ability to reflect the light it
[41:14] lacks the ability to internalize it and
[41:16] project it back out
[41:17] so it absorbs it can't really understand
[41:19] it or comprehend it
[41:20] it's dead to the light and that's the
[41:23] expression of christ that is coming
[41:25] so jesus says in john 3 19 and this is
[41:27] the condemnation
[41:29] that light has come into the world and
[41:31] men love darkness rather than light
[41:33] because their deeds were evil
[41:35] it's the contrast between light and
[41:37] darkness between good and bad
[41:41] so the in the begone in the beginning
[41:45] and in the beginning of the creation of
[41:46] god he's separating
[41:49] light from darkness and this is an
[41:51] expression to us
[41:53] this is expressing something to us today
[41:56] and in the message it is the rising of
[41:57] the sun
[41:59] there was a time when the world was
[42:00] laying in utter darkness
[42:02] is without form and was void and was all
[42:05] covered with water
[42:06] and it was laying there in the dark
[42:08] dismal gloomy atmosphere
[42:11] and the spirit of god moved upon that
[42:13] water and said let there be light
[42:15] god had a reason to do that
[42:19] god doesn't just move upon your heart
[42:21] without a purpose without a reason
[42:24] that that's why we you just you just
[42:26] don't want to have a charismatic service
[42:27] just for the purpose of the spirit of
[42:29] god moving
[42:30] and get yourself worked up bodily
[42:32] exercise prophet little
[42:34] and if that relates to physical exercise
[42:36] i could use a little prophet
[42:38] but as it relates to worship and getting
[42:40] all excited and everything it profits
[42:42] little
[42:42] the spirit of god moves for a reason he
[42:45] just doesn't pour out his spirit so that
[42:46] we can say i dreamed i spoke in tongues
[42:49] i did this i did that
[42:50] lord let it accomplish your purpose let
[42:53] it
[42:53] further your objective may it make a
[42:56] permanent difference lord
[42:58] so he says the spirit of god moved upon
[43:00] the water he had a reason to do that
[43:02] for down beneath that water there was
[43:05] seeds that he had planted
[43:07] and it had to that had to have that
[43:09] sunlight to make it live oh that's what
[43:12] the moving of the spirit is ultimately
[43:14] for
[43:15] to make seeds live to make life live to
[43:18] bring more life out of you
[43:20] lord if your spirit moves within a
[43:22] service may i not just
[43:23] radiate within the four walls of my
[43:25] tabernacle man i just radiate within the
[43:28] the confines of a convention service or
[43:30] a camp or a church service
[43:32] but lord let my life then be lived out
[43:35] before the people before my family
[43:37] let it be at work let it be a school
[43:39] let's be on the job lord
[43:40] let life be brought out of me by light
[43:45] let it bring it out of me it had to have
[43:49] that sunlight to make it live
[43:50] and because there was a deep calling to
[43:52] the deep because there was a seed that
[43:54] needed light to live there had to be
[43:56] light come forth
[43:57] to bring expression so the spirit of god
[43:59] moved upon the face of the waters
[44:02] why there were seeds that were planted
[44:03] there and it had to have sunlight to
[44:06] live
[44:07] this picture that brother branham paints
[44:09] in genesis chapter 1
[44:10] it's gloomy it's dismal it's dark but
[44:13] there's a seed in there
[44:14] so the word has to come forth as
[44:16] sunlight to make it live
[44:19] now listen to what he says in the
[44:20] message shalom
[44:22] the world is one of the most chaotic
[44:24] times of darkness that it's ever stood
[44:26] in
[44:27] now this is january 12 1964.
[44:31] i've read to you from december 29 63
[44:34] january 25th 1964 and now that we're
[44:38] reading from
[44:39] january 12 1964 there's a theme
[44:42] of all these things he's identifying
[44:44] right here at this transition from 63 to
[44:47] 64.
[44:48] and he's identifying it's shalom there
[44:51] is a man here
[44:52] who can turn on the light what he says
[44:55] no matter how dark it gets
[44:58] there's a man here who could turn on
[44:59] light and rapture
[45:01] that church and he tells the story of
[45:03] how a boy and a girl go down in these
[45:05] deep dark caverns and they're in these
[45:06] caverns and all of a sudden this
[45:07] engineer turns the light off and it gets
[45:09] really dark
[45:10] and this little sister begins to cry out
[45:12] and fear and scream
[45:13] oh no oh no but her brother
[45:17] maybe his name was william is standing
[45:20] there
[45:21] and she's like brother bill brother bill
[45:23] oh no what are we going to do it's dark
[45:25] but he's the one standing next to the
[45:27] engineer
[45:29] so he says don't worry honey there's a
[45:32] man here who can turn on the light
[45:34] and rapture the church don't worry
[45:36] sister how dark it gets don't worry how
[45:38] depraved against
[45:39] don't worry about it there's a man here
[45:41] who can turn on the light
[45:42] i'm so glad that we had a prophet who
[45:44] was standing next to the engineer
[45:46] and knew no matter how dark and chaotic
[45:48] laodicea is
[45:49] there has been a rising sun for the
[45:52] bright age
[45:54] shalom good morning thy light has come
[45:57] rise and shine it hasn't risen upon the
[46:00] world but it's risen upon thee
[46:02] and his glory shall be seen upon thee
[46:05] he's expressing this so he says in
[46:07] shalom
[46:08] the world is one of the most chaotic
[46:09] times of darkness that it's ever stood
[46:11] in
[46:11] and yet it's standing in again
[46:14] the most blessed light that it ever did
[46:16] shine in
[46:18] wow now he says that because he's
[46:21] standing next to the engineer
[46:23] the difference is just like it was in
[46:25] the beginning
[46:27] this is how he wants us to understand it
[46:28] so i'm going to go back to the beginning
[46:30] so you can understand where we're
[46:31] standing now this isn't a fruitless
[46:33] exercise to examine genesis chapter 1
[46:36] because in christ is the mystery of god
[46:37] revealed that's what we're going back to
[46:39] restored back to eden and now when he's
[46:42] looking at the condition of laodicea he
[46:43] says it's just like it was
[46:44] in the beginning he says it's just like
[46:47] it was in the beginning when there was
[46:48] gross darkness upon the earth
[46:50] and the spirit of god moved upon the
[46:52] face of the water and said let there be
[46:54] light
[46:54] and god separated the light from the
[46:56] darkness
[46:57] and i believe that we are now living in
[46:59] that hour again
[47:01] that when god is separating light from
[47:04] darkness
[47:05] and he's pressing it to the other side
[47:07] of the world
[47:08] that the light might be made manifest
[47:13] if you should do anything you should
[47:14] make it personal don't make it political
[47:16] don't say oh
[47:17] if that's the case then this party's got
[47:19] to win if that's the case then this has
[47:20] got to happen
[47:21] don't make it political listen if right
[47:24] all of a sudden
[47:25] all the candidates stepped down and you
[47:27] had some god-fearing
[47:29] uh a christian believed in the oneness
[47:32] of god
[47:32] baptized in the name of the lord jesus
[47:34] christ and he was to become
[47:36] the next president of the united states
[47:38] it still doesn't change
[47:40] a thing does it change a thing
[47:44] god's word moves right on god is going
[47:47] to use whatever is there
[47:49] god's word is going to be fulfilled
[47:53] so we wouldn't say oh reset things are
[47:55] going to be different
[47:56] you know salvation's come to america no
[47:59] this thing's on a path
[48:00] let it take its path i'm on a different
[48:02] one
[48:04] in the preview of the bride laodicea
[48:06] which brethren said that church that
[48:07] walked by
[48:08] was the the church from united states of
[48:10] america
[48:11] he said and he catches it later and when
[48:13] he preaches a couple weeks later
[48:15] i didn't recognize it then but he says
[48:16] this is laodicea
[48:18] and what was she doing dancing to the
[48:20] beat of rock and roll
[48:21] naked and going down into chaos going
[48:24] down into the darkness and at the same
[48:26] time laodicea is going into the darkness
[48:28] what was the bride doing
[48:30] rising up and what was the thing that
[48:33] got the bride out of step
[48:36] she was watching who was going down i
[48:38] wonder what's next for them
[48:40] and then she gets out of step don't take
[48:42] your eyes off the third pull
[48:44] don't get your eyes on the squeeze don't
[48:46] try to figure out all the national
[48:48] forces
[48:49] and how they're going to work on you the
[48:50] word is what works on you
[48:53] the word is what going to do it i don't
[48:55] want to be distracted by what's going on
[48:57] around there
[48:57] i don't want to be distracted by what's
[48:59] happened in the world today master no
[49:01] mass pandemic or no pandemic
[49:03] it's the word that's working mightily in
[49:05] me
[49:06] that's what's making the difference
[49:12] the only the only the only mask i'm
[49:16] worried about is anyone that would keep
[49:18] me veiled from christ
[49:20] and i'm so glad he's unveiled himself
[49:23] he's removed his mask in this hour for
[49:24] us to see him as he is
[49:26] he says once again we're living in that
[49:28] hour when god is separating light from
[49:30] darkness
[49:30] here we are in the end and god's doing
[49:34] what he did in the beginning
[49:35] he says the same thing and what's the
[49:38] fair first characteristic
[49:40] of christ in the rapture brother brown
[49:44] brings a great revelation
[49:45] of how the rapture is a cycle it's a
[49:47] process
[49:48] and he preaches the rapture message and
[49:51] he brings it into
[49:52] a a reality that is not
[49:55] a church waiting for something to happen
[49:58] but a church experiencing something that
[50:01] is happening
[50:02] in that the rapture is not a date on the
[50:04] calendar but the rapture is the word
[50:06] made life and the word made light when
[50:08] it's manifest in the time that we're
[50:10] living in right now
[50:11] and it's the resurrection and the life
[50:13] made known to his elect and his bride
[50:15] right now
[50:16] because the lord himself has descended
[50:18] with a shout
[50:20] out it is the rising of the sun that's
[50:23] the time we're living in now and brother
[50:24] bam takes psalms 27 verse
[50:27] verses 1 to 5 and what's the very first
[50:30] characteristic that comes into view
[50:32] in the rapture cycle the lord is my
[50:35] light
[50:36] and my salvation the lord is the
[50:39] strength of my life
[50:42] oh hallelujah the lord is my light and
[50:45] my salvation the lord is the strength of
[50:46] my life so what does david say
[50:48] whom shall i fear of whom shall i be
[50:51] afraid
[50:51] while light has come light is life
[50:54] therefore i do not fear death
[50:56] light has come its deliverance and
[50:58] salvation from darkness
[50:59] therefore i do not fear i will not be
[51:02] afraid i will not be a
[51:04] fearful i and this will i be confident
[51:08] oh praise the lord the lord is my light
[51:11] and because he's light he's my salvation
[51:14] that's the very first characteristic
[51:16] that he reveals himself as in the
[51:17] rapture
[51:18] is light because once again god is
[51:21] separating
[51:22] light from darkness in the chaos and the
[51:25] blackness of laodicea
[51:26] when the holy spirit wanted to write it
[51:28] out
[51:29] and it was even in the heavens with the
[51:31] blackout of the moon
[51:33] she was completely black there was no
[51:35] light left
[51:36] and brother branham wanted to he wanted
[51:38] to keep giving a sliver of light
[51:40] but it was total darkness and it's right
[51:43] when it's totally blacked out
[51:46] that god speaks at the opening of the
[51:47] word and what does he bring
[51:49] light separated from darkness
[51:53] it's a light that not even laodicea can
[51:55] brag about because she's put christ
[51:56] outside the church
[51:58] she can't say oh i i had that light
[52:00] that's where that came from no it's
[52:01] completely blacked out
[52:03] and then god stands on the outside
[52:05] behold i stand at the door knock
[52:08] a fugitive in his own church so once
[52:11] again
[52:12] just as he did in the beginning god is
[52:14] separating light from darkness
[52:17] so if i could uh just reset a little bit
[52:22] god in the beginning and in the
[52:24] beginning of creation of god he's
[52:26] separating light from darkness
[52:27] and he describes it in the rising of the
[52:29] sun how the spirit of god moved upon the
[52:31] water
[52:32] because there were seeds there and it
[52:33] had to have sunlight to live
[52:36] then brother bam says that's the time
[52:37] we're living in now in the message
[52:39] shalom we're living in a time where
[52:40] god's doing
[52:42] the same thing what does that mean
[52:44] there's got to be seeds here
[52:45] that need to live and the darkness of
[52:47] laodicea will never produce it
[52:49] the church cannot produce it it's got to
[52:51] take the word which is light which
[52:53] brings life
[52:54] to produce it so in the fourth seal he
[52:57] says this
[52:58] in genesis chapter one it said in the
[53:00] beginning god created heavens and earth
[53:02] period that's all now the world without
[53:04] form
[53:05] and void god said i believe every seed
[53:08] and he says and i and he's in this
[53:09] conversation sorry
[53:10] he says i believe every seed was laying
[53:12] right there from some other civilization
[53:15] or something
[53:18] okay very interesting there's many
[53:20] different theories on even what it means
[53:22] before the foundation of the world and
[53:24] based upon the construction
[53:25] of the greek there's many theologians
[53:27] that believe that there was a world that
[53:29] existed with satan being the ruler over
[53:32] it
[53:32] before god uh began to say let there be
[53:36] light
[53:37] and banish satan and begin to place him
[53:39] in another realm and bring forth
[53:40] creation
[53:41] and there's a lot of rich things to read
[53:43] about and to explore in these things
[53:45] now brother mann says there was season
[53:47] maybe from another civilization or
[53:48] something
[53:49] and he said as soon as the water lifted
[53:51] off the light struck it
[53:52] up come from the trees and everything
[53:54] this is where i'm describing
[53:56] this process and and i wish he could
[53:59] have
[53:59] labored more on on that thought says
[54:03] the same thing with the human being
[54:06] it's a type then what god did in the
[54:09] beginning
[54:10] and this is where i i wanted to go into
[54:12] these different principles from future
[54:14] home
[54:15] uh and to express some of these uh these
[54:17] parallels and these types and we have
[54:19] the
[54:19] we have the privilege of his god teres
[54:22] the union in the sky
[54:23] and the change of our body maybe we'll
[54:24] have time to get into those things
[54:26] i know in my heart i would love to have
[54:28] an evening service as god would allow us
[54:29] to be able to do that
[54:31] for those who'd want to fellowship
[54:32] around the word in the evening but he's
[54:34] saying the same thing with the human
[54:35] being it's a type
[54:36] so what happened in genesis chapter 1 is
[54:39] a type of what god wants to do with the
[54:41] human with the individual with his elect
[54:44] what god has done to the earth god also
[54:46] does the individual
[54:48] whether it be fire spirit water spirit
[54:50] and the baptism the blood
[54:52] water and spirit all those different
[54:53] elements the same thing he does the
[54:54] earth the same thing he does to the
[54:56] person
[54:56] he says when all the mist is moved away
[54:59] and the revealed truth to that real seed
[55:02] laying there still dermatized
[55:04] and the light of the gospel can strike
[55:06] it by true indication of the word
[55:07] it will live hallelujah so i can see
[55:12] myself in genesis chapter one
[55:14] there was darkness there was void there
[55:15] was confusion but down in that earth was
[55:18] a predestinated seed
[55:20] and it needed the sunlight to live so
[55:22] god said let there be light and there
[55:24] was light
[55:25] and god began to separate the light from
[55:27] the darkness to do what
[55:28] to bring life out of that seed and
[55:31] that's the same thing god's doing today
[55:34] he's separating light from darkness not
[55:36] to build a great church
[55:38] not to build people up in arrogance or
[55:39] heal their humanity
[55:41] but to bring life out of the elected
[55:43] seed to bring
[55:44] life out of the humanity and all that
[55:46] mystery that's in your life
[55:47] once it's moved away by the revealed
[55:49] truth to the seed laying there
[55:51] then the light of god's gospel can
[55:53] strike it by true vindication
[55:55] you will live oh praise the lord
[56:00] the revealed truth is that so the
[56:03] dynamics of the word being preached to
[56:05] you
[56:05] driving away the mist and a revelation
[56:07] of the word striking to the seed
[56:10] the beginning was a type of that
[56:13] the beginning was a type of what you're
[56:15] experiencing now in laodicea
[56:18] and the message man that can turn on the
[56:19] light
[56:22] he says god separates light from
[56:23] darkness and he separates death from
[56:26] life
[56:27] he does it by his word
[56:31] his word is what always brings forth now
[56:33] the seed was already upon the earth
[56:35] i believe god had planted the seed and
[56:37] just as long as the sun could get to
[56:39] that seed it would begin to grow
[56:41] and that's the reason it only taken days
[56:42] to bring forth these things because the
[56:44] seed was already earth
[56:46] all it needed was light and that's the
[56:48] way
[56:49] god has today keep an eye on that
[56:52] parallel
[56:53] that's the way god has today his seed is
[56:55] already here his word
[56:57] the only thing it needs is light on it
[57:00] and he is
[57:01] that light for he is the word and the
[57:03] word
[57:04] and the light are the same thing the
[57:06] life in there is the light of the word
[57:08] is the life the germ of life lays within
[57:11] the grain and the grain
[57:12] is the life is what breaks forth and
[57:13] brings forth the life out of the grain
[57:16] that's the way that christ in the word
[57:18] makes the word
[57:19] do what it's supposed to do just like
[57:21] the life in the grain of wheat or
[57:23] whatever it is
[57:24] it makes the wheat do what it's supposed
[57:27] to do because it's the life
[57:28] that's in it that's if you want to
[57:32] you want to do what you're supposed to
[57:33] do let the word work on you
[57:36] it makes the word the wheat it makes the
[57:38] wheat do what it's supposed to do
[57:41] it was brother barry i made the comment
[57:44] over the last several months about the
[57:46] buried coffee
[57:48] he said that we in in these terms
[57:51] you wouldn't want to accomplish by
[57:52] legislation what needs to be
[57:54] accomplished by revelation
[57:58] we can come up with legislation and we
[58:00] can legislate a lot of things that we
[58:02] see in the word
[58:03] and just make it as law make it
[58:05] legalistic and make it
[58:06] legislation and then us being
[58:10] creatures of habit and some of us even
[58:13] being more disciplined than others
[58:14] we can tow the line of legislation
[58:18] but it never be revelation
[58:22] and then just change the law
[58:25] and then what happens you just go right
[58:26] back but if it's by revelation
[58:28] you can mess with the letter of it all
[58:30] you want but if what you're living is
[58:32] revelation then there's no
[58:34] legislation that changes that it's a
[58:36] revelation to you it's anchored it's the
[58:38] same yesterday today and forever
[58:40] and so it's the light of the gospel that
[58:41] makes you do what you're supposed to do
[58:43] just like the light of the the life and
[58:45] the grain does what it's supposed to do
[58:46] because the life that's in it
[58:48] so life is only by the word of god made
[58:50] manifest
[58:51] life comes only by the word of god made
[58:54] manifest
[58:56] as long as it's just in the book like
[58:58] this
[58:59] it can still be questioned
[59:04] as long as it's a book as long as it's a
[59:06] tape as long as it's an mp3
[59:08] as long as it's just letter you can
[59:10] question it
[59:11] and i can say this about you looking
[59:13] into it or whether people look at you
[59:16] and question it as long as it's in a
[59:18] book it can be questioned
[59:20] but once in your life once it's lived
[59:22] out in your life
[59:23] there's no more question to it
[59:26] oh i don't know about this i don't know
[59:28] about that as long as it's in the book
[59:29] ask the questions
[59:30] reason with the question with it wrestle
[59:32] with it but once god has spoken to you
[59:35] then you can no longer question it
[59:38] you could say hey that's a good question
[59:40] all i know is god spoke
[59:42] well i never thought about that i didn't
[59:44] know that word meant that that's that's
[59:45] outstanding but god spoke
[59:48] as long as it's in this book it can
[59:50] still be questioned as long as it's only
[59:52] in printed form it can be questioned
[59:53] as long as it's only preached behind a
[59:55] pulpit it can still be questioned but
[59:57] once it's lived out in your life there's
[59:59] no more questions
[1:00:03] as long as it's just in a book and he
[1:00:05] says like this
[1:00:06] it can still be questioned well i don't
[1:00:09] want to just live by a book
[1:00:12] i want to live by the lamb's book of
[1:00:13] life
[1:00:15] as long as it's in a book it can still
[1:00:17] be questioned
[1:00:19] it's time that we start reading the
[1:00:20] right book
[1:00:23] because your book of life none of us
[1:00:25] have a good one
[1:00:27] and when i say good it's blemish blim is
[1:00:29] free it doesn't matter how old you are
[1:00:32] you look at your book your baby book you
[1:00:34] look at your history like okay
[1:00:36] all right i'm not perfect but start
[1:00:38] reading from a different book
[1:00:40] the lamb's book of life doesn't record
[1:00:42] one of your mistakes
[1:00:43] one of your heirs it it it records your
[1:00:46] character
[1:00:47] which is your name the book the the
[1:00:49] books that are open and people are going
[1:00:51] to be judged according to the works why
[1:00:52] their life is recorded in the record of
[1:00:54] the wheat plan
[1:00:55] but you're the seed all that's there is
[1:00:56] the germ all that's there is the life
[1:00:59] not the record of the plant
[1:01:01] as long as it's just in a book it can
[1:01:02] still be questioned but when it's made
[1:01:04] manifest then you see the product of
[1:01:06] what it spoke of being manifested
[1:01:08] then that is light on the word the word
[1:01:10] said so
[1:01:11] then when it comes to past that is life
[1:01:13] in light
[1:01:14] light bringing life light brings life
[1:01:17] you put into the basement cover it over
[1:01:19] and never bring forth anything because
[1:01:20] it can't
[1:01:21] there's no light there but as soon as
[1:01:23] light strikes it
[1:01:24] then it'll bring forth life if it's a
[1:01:26] dermatitis seed
[1:01:27] that's the same thing it is in the word
[1:01:29] the word
[1:01:30] is god when the light strikes it it
[1:01:32] brings the word to life
[1:01:34] again that's what god is doing today
[1:01:40] separating light from darkness and in
[1:01:42] the message shalom as we've quoted from
[1:01:44] it in the one in january
[1:01:47] 19th 1964. this is just a week after he
[1:01:50] said the world's in one of the most
[1:01:51] chaotic times it's ever been him but the
[1:01:53] most blessed light
[1:01:54] because god just like he was at the
[1:01:55] beginning is separating light from
[1:01:57] darkness
[1:01:58] he's referring to the fulfillment of
[1:01:59] revelations chapter 10.
[1:02:01] he says stand the symphony stay in god's
[1:02:04] word
[1:02:05] no matter how hard it is stay right
[1:02:09] with it wherever god is beating
[1:02:12] sometimes he causes trouble to break the
[1:02:13] bands to set you free
[1:02:15] he does that oh my if there's trouble
[1:02:18] just say lord break the bands
[1:02:20] sometimes god causes trouble to break
[1:02:22] the bands to set you free
[1:02:24] and we're running from the trouble that
[1:02:26] god's wanting to use to break the bands
[1:02:28] he does that you say well i don't know
[1:02:30] what to do he does what's the difference
[1:02:35] you're just playing the part he's the
[1:02:37] one that's got you in his hand
[1:02:39] he directs you remember it's all done by
[1:02:41] a sign
[1:02:42] we see the time we're living in by the
[1:02:44] sign we're living and so we know what
[1:02:46] the symphony does today
[1:02:48] it's a separating time taking the light
[1:02:50] from the darkness
[1:02:52] he says let's say it together so you
[1:02:54] won't forget it because i feel to say
[1:02:56] this
[1:02:57] and then and then it says that brother
[1:02:58] adam speaks and the congregation speaks
[1:03:00] in union
[1:03:01] union it's taken the light from the
[1:03:03] darkness
[1:03:04] he says let's say it again it's taking
[1:03:06] the light from the darkness
[1:03:09] what's happening it's taking the light
[1:03:11] from the darkness
[1:03:12] now before you start looking at that on
[1:03:14] a political spectrum an economic
[1:03:16] spectrum a personal relationship
[1:03:18] spectrum
[1:03:19] a geographical spectrum you have to
[1:03:21] first recognize that where it matters
[1:03:23] the most
[1:03:24] is the light he's taking out of you and
[1:03:27] separating from the darkness that was in
[1:03:28] you
[1:03:30] this is a personal experience what good
[1:03:32] would it be for there to be darkness
[1:03:34] in me and i'm i'm glory and and all the
[1:03:36] separation that's taken around me
[1:03:38] and i'm stiff arming everything else and
[1:03:40] i'm trying to get away from this and i'm
[1:03:42] trying to separate from that and i'm
[1:03:43] refusing this and i'm refusing that
[1:03:45] but light's never been separated or been
[1:03:47] brought out in me
[1:03:48] so that's what god is doing today he is
[1:03:51] separating he's taking light
[1:03:53] from darkness all the darkness and the
[1:03:55] death that i was in god
[1:03:57] is taking light out of that
[1:04:00] he says that's god's symphony he's shown
[1:04:02] it in the heavens he's shown it on the
[1:04:04] blackboards he's shown it by himself
[1:04:05] he promised it in the word we see it
[1:04:08] vindicated he's separating the wheat
[1:04:09] from the chaff he's taking the light
[1:04:12] from the dark
[1:04:15] amen because that's what he did in the
[1:04:18] beginning
[1:04:19] he took light from darkness
[1:04:23] now i'll uh i i've been right around an
[1:04:27] hour long
[1:04:28] here and i still have about an hour to
[1:04:31] go
[1:04:33] and i'm gonna i'm gonna just cut it
[1:04:35] short of that
[1:04:37] 59 minutes would be short of another
[1:04:38] hour i'm going to cut it short of that
[1:04:41] but maybe lay just a few uh elements in
[1:04:43] there for next time
[1:04:45] so let's look at genesis chapter 1
[1:04:46] verses 14 to 18.
[1:04:51] oh i just want to go through this so
[1:04:53] quickly and god said let there be lights
[1:04:55] and the firmament of the heaven genesis
[1:04:56] chapter 1 verses 14 to 18.
[1:04:59] god said now we're looking at another
[1:05:04] part of the creation and look how god is
[1:05:06] really with light and darkness
[1:05:08] god said let there be lights in the
[1:05:09] firmament of the heaven to divide the
[1:05:11] day from the night
[1:05:12] and let them be for signs remember how
[1:05:15] brother branham said what happened in
[1:05:16] the beginning it's a type the same thing
[1:05:17] with the human being it's a type
[1:05:19] so he says let it be for signs and for
[1:05:21] seasons and for days and years
[1:05:23] and let them be for lights and the
[1:05:24] firmament of the heaven to give light
[1:05:26] upon the earth and it was so
[1:05:28] and god made two great lights now
[1:05:35] this there
[1:05:38] there's a i'll just try to bring this
[1:05:42] out even if i have to do it slowly
[1:05:43] when light came and it's referred to in
[1:05:45] matthew chapter 14 it says those that
[1:05:47] sat in the
[1:05:48] in darkness saw great light so now in
[1:05:51] the beginning it says and
[1:05:52] he made two great lights the greater
[1:05:54] light to rule the day
[1:05:56] and the lesser light to rule the night
[1:05:58] he made the stars also
[1:06:00] and god set them in the firmament of the
[1:06:02] heaven to give light upon the earth
[1:06:04] and to rule over the day and over the
[1:06:07] night
[1:06:08] and to divide the light from the
[1:06:09] darkness and god saw
[1:06:11] that it was good so there's two great
[1:06:13] lights a greater light to rule the day a
[1:06:15] lesser light to rule the night
[1:06:17] so god is we look at these scriptures
[1:06:19] and there's a lot more we'd like to
[1:06:20] amplify in this
[1:06:21] but god is writing a bible and
[1:06:24] because we know when he put the stars in
[1:06:26] their place and he places the stars and
[1:06:28] the heavens
[1:06:29] that's the zodiac and brother man says
[1:06:30] it begins with the virgin it ends with
[1:06:32] the lion
[1:06:33] you see his first come you see a second
[1:06:34] coming and so god is writing the bible
[1:06:36] in the heavens as he's placing the stars
[1:06:39] he's writing the bible so what is he
[1:06:41] doing he's hiding a mystery in the
[1:06:43] heavens
[1:06:44] and as he places these things there's a
[1:06:46] drama that's being hidden there there's
[1:06:48] a story that's being told
[1:06:49] and there's a lot of people that look to
[1:06:51] the stars and they see these elements
[1:06:52] and they draft these things out
[1:06:54] but what god is doing is he's writing a
[1:06:56] bible his first bible in the heavens
[1:06:58] and he's hiding a mystery but he's also
[1:07:01] placing a representation of you
[1:07:03] in the heavens he's placing a
[1:07:06] representation of you
[1:07:07] in the sky not just a creation but an
[1:07:10] expression
[1:07:11] and brother branham in the lamb's book
[1:07:13] of life says we live by the alms of the
[1:07:15] people being ministers he's talking
[1:07:16] about
[1:07:16] we're all poor none of us are rich he
[1:07:18] says but brother in africa one little
[1:07:20] black boy about this high
[1:07:21] or a prostitute off the street yonder in
[1:07:23] louisville one soul saved
[1:07:25] in eternity when that star is shining
[1:07:28] yonder
[1:07:28] our name will be wrapped into it that's
[1:07:31] your value
[1:07:32] catch that you lead a soul to christ
[1:07:35] your name is wrapped up in that
[1:07:38] your name is forever connected with it
[1:07:41] and he calls
[1:07:42] it a star if you lead someone to the
[1:07:44] lord in eternity when that star is
[1:07:45] shining
[1:07:46] your name is wrapped up in that star he
[1:07:49] said there's your value
[1:07:50] he says what's good all the money all
[1:07:52] the popularity people to pat you on the
[1:07:54] back you become a great person
[1:07:56] what does that do to you not a bit it
[1:07:58] vanishes and stays here on the earth but
[1:08:00] one soul saved you'll see your name
[1:08:02] wrapped into it as long as the morning
[1:08:04] stars shall glitter
[1:08:07] so brother abraham identifies a soul
[1:08:10] saved a soul baptized in the body of
[1:08:12] christ
[1:08:12] he identifies them as a star so in
[1:08:15] genesis chapter 1 verse 16 he says he
[1:08:17] made the stars also
[1:08:19] god is placing the stars in their
[1:08:22] position
[1:08:22] and as he does he's representing every
[1:08:25] soul
[1:08:26] that's going to be placed into the body
[1:08:28] of christ the heavenly body of christ
[1:08:31] he's showing each star that's placed
[1:08:33] that represents you being placed
[1:08:35] and when you witness and you share from
[1:08:37] your heart when you speak the truth
[1:08:39] and that catches the attention of a soul
[1:08:42] that is lost
[1:08:42] and they come to christ your name is
[1:08:45] positioned
[1:08:46] in that star that means you had a
[1:08:48] representation
[1:08:49] already in genesis 1 16 of that soul
[1:08:53] and your connection with it as long as
[1:08:56] the stars are shining
[1:08:58] we can believe that their souls to be
[1:09:00] saved
[1:09:02] that my name can be wrapped up in it in
[1:09:05] eternity when that star is shining
[1:09:06] yonder
[1:09:07] he says in the working of the holy
[1:09:08] spirit where's value at then what is it
[1:09:10] i can think if i get one soul saved one
[1:09:13] little black boy or whatever it might be
[1:09:15] as long as there is an eternity and that
[1:09:17] light
[1:09:18] and the star of god is shining in glory
[1:09:21] my name will be associated with getting
[1:09:23] that soul saved
[1:09:25] oh a light and the star of god is
[1:09:28] shining in glory
[1:09:31] when the son of god comes into the body
[1:09:34] of christ
[1:09:35] he says it's like a star a star of god
[1:09:38] shining in glory he's equating us to
[1:09:40] stars
[1:09:42] in isaiah chapter 14 verses 12 to 14 how
[1:09:44] are fallen from heaven or lucifer
[1:09:46] son of the morning however cut down to
[1:09:49] the ground which does weaken the nations
[1:09:51] for thou hast said in thy heart i will
[1:09:53] ascend into heaven
[1:09:54] i will exalt my throne above the stars
[1:09:58] of god
[1:09:59] brother branham and god of this evil age
[1:10:00] says sons of god now
[1:10:02] so when he looks at the stars of god he
[1:10:04] calls them the sons of god
[1:10:06] that is the daughters of god it's the
[1:10:08] children he says i will sit also upon
[1:10:09] the mount of the congregation
[1:10:11] in the sides of the north i will ascend
[1:10:13] above the heights of the cloud
[1:10:15] i will be like the most high
[1:10:18] so satan wanted to achieve equality he
[1:10:21] wanted to achieve
[1:10:21] oneness but god had made him
[1:10:25] without the ability to create
[1:10:28] but in god having created this for
[1:10:31] contrast god had reserved oh hallelujah
[1:10:35] god had reserved a place for someone
[1:10:39] to be co-equal in every respect
[1:10:42] including the ability to create and it
[1:10:46] drove
[1:10:46] lucifer to madness why he wanted
[1:10:49] that place he wanted to exalt himself
[1:10:53] above the stars of god
[1:10:55] he wanted to be like the most high but
[1:10:57] god
[1:10:58] had reserved that designation for one
[1:11:01] person
[1:11:03] for christ and his bride he wanted to
[1:11:07] express himself in his son
[1:11:09] and express himself and a daughter in
[1:11:11] bridegroom and bride
[1:11:13] god wanted to become that and satan
[1:11:15] caused himself
[1:11:16] to want to ascend above that and what
[1:11:20] the stars of god
[1:11:22] so what's being dramatized in the
[1:11:24] heavens the bible
[1:11:26] says the heavens declared the glory of
[1:11:28] god
[1:11:29] christ himself was the glorious of the
[1:11:31] only begotten of the father
[1:11:32] the heavens declared the glory of god
[1:11:34] their line goes throughout all the earth
[1:11:36] and there's no place where their voice
[1:11:38] is not heard
[1:11:39] while the heavens are speaking the
[1:11:42] heavens declare god's
[1:11:44] glory the firmament shows his handiwork
[1:11:45] psalms 19 1-6
[1:11:48] in them he says hath he set a tabernacle
[1:11:51] for the son
[1:11:53] which is as a bridegroom coming out of
[1:11:55] his chamber as rejoices as a strong man
[1:11:57] to run a race
[1:11:58] his going forth is from the end of
[1:12:00] heaven and his circuit unto the ends
[1:12:02] and there is nothing hid from the heat
[1:12:04] thereof
[1:12:05] this is beautiful poetry about the the
[1:12:08] sun the moon and the stars their
[1:12:09] relationship their harmony
[1:12:11] and how the sun the moon and the stars
[1:12:13] are all declared in the glory of god
[1:12:15] and there's no place on earth where that
[1:12:17] voice is not heard
[1:12:20] the heavens declare the glory of god
[1:12:24] christ himself is likened unto the
[1:12:26] morning star he calls himself in
[1:12:27] revelations chapter 22 verse 16
[1:12:29] i am the bright in morning star
[1:12:34] so we see him as the son he's typed as
[1:12:37] the morning star he's typed as the son
[1:12:39] in them hath he said in the heavens he
[1:12:41] said a tabernacle for the son
[1:12:43] but then the very next verse says and
[1:12:45] the spirit and the bride say come he's
[1:12:50] the bride and morning star
[1:12:51] and the spirit and the bride together
[1:12:53] now in unison their voice is one
[1:12:56] it's not just the son speaking alone by
[1:12:59] himself
[1:12:59] now the spirit and the bride are in
[1:13:01] unison saying come
[1:13:03] now her voice is his voice now it's
[1:13:05] united throughout all the earth
[1:13:07] revelations 10 8 to 11 prophesy again
[1:13:11] and and the into the circuits of the
[1:13:12] earth from the ends thereof
[1:13:16] christ who is in the image of god in the
[1:13:18] glory of god we beheld his glory the
[1:13:19] glories of the only begotten of the
[1:13:20] father
[1:13:22] that's first corinthians 11 saying man
[1:13:24] is in the image and glory of god
[1:13:26] it says but the woman is the glory of
[1:13:28] the man
[1:13:29] so it says the heavens declare the glory
[1:13:31] of god it's not just the son that
[1:13:33] declares his glory
[1:13:34] but it's also the daughter that declares
[1:13:36] his glory
[1:13:38] the bride is the glory of christ the
[1:13:39] mystery of god now and this is just
[1:13:41] where i have to use summary language and
[1:13:42] try to wrap this up
[1:13:43] the bride now has come to a place where
[1:13:46] the mystery
[1:13:47] has unfolded to the fullness
[1:13:52] the bible says and he has put all things
[1:13:54] under his feet ephesians 1
[1:13:55] 22 and 23 and has put all things under
[1:13:58] his feet
[1:13:59] and gave him to be the head over all
[1:14:01] things to the church
[1:14:02] now he defines the church which is his
[1:14:04] body the fullness of him
[1:14:07] that filleth all in all the bride
[1:14:10] is the fullness of him that filleth all
[1:14:13] in all when it comes out into the
[1:14:15] complete
[1:14:16] in this hour the full manifestation in
[1:14:18] this hour
[1:14:19] that's the season that we've arrived in
[1:14:21] the hour of the fullness where he says
[1:14:23] it comes out into his body which is his
[1:14:25] fullness the fullness of him that
[1:14:27] filleth on
[1:14:28] all i notice when he says that
[1:14:31] he had put all things under his feet
[1:14:34] so he's put all things underneath his
[1:14:36] feet that he might be the head to his
[1:14:38] body
[1:14:40] and his body is the bride the fullness
[1:14:43] of him the bride is the fullness of him
[1:14:45] and he says but all things have to be
[1:14:46] under his feet
[1:14:49] now in the in the beginning god
[1:14:51] separated light from darkness
[1:14:52] light is life darkness is death
[1:14:56] and in first corinthians chapter 15
[1:14:58] verses 25 and 26 for he must reign
[1:15:01] till he hath put all enemies under his
[1:15:03] feet
[1:15:05] the last enemy that shall be destroyed
[1:15:07] is death
[1:15:09] so watch what god was doing now and and
[1:15:12] i i won't apologize for going along
[1:15:14] because this next part is just so
[1:15:15] exciting you'll forgive me
[1:15:17] you just immediately within the next 20
[1:15:19] minutes like
[1:15:20] justified brother aaron
[1:15:24] notice what's being foreshadowed now
[1:15:26] this is the this is why
[1:15:28] i apolo i do apologize if i've labored
[1:15:30] it too long myself
[1:15:32] but i this is the part that just so
[1:15:34] thrills me for us to see this
[1:15:36] something is being foreshadowed in the
[1:15:38] beginning now
[1:15:39] that you ought to just reach out to grab
[1:15:41] a hold of and claim
[1:15:43] he says in genesis 1 16 and god made two
[1:15:46] great lights
[1:15:47] the greater light to rule the day and
[1:15:50] the lesser light to rule the night
[1:15:52] and he made the stars also so
[1:15:54] individually
[1:15:55] we are stars but now we see the sun
[1:15:59] which is christ and the moon
[1:16:02] collectively
[1:16:03] which is the bride and brother banham
[1:16:05] refers to the sun and moon it says just
[1:16:07] like the bride
[1:16:08] and bridegroom and speak to the rock he
[1:16:11] says in genesis when god made the sun
[1:16:13] and made the moon
[1:16:14] now the moon is the wife of the sun when
[1:16:16] the sun goes away the moon reflects the
[1:16:18] light of the sun
[1:16:19] on the earth now but think about this
[1:16:23] i'm getting excited
[1:16:25] what did he make the moon to rule over
[1:16:30] he made the sun to rule over the day
[1:16:33] but he made the moon to rule over the
[1:16:35] darkness
[1:16:37] he made the moon to rule over the night
[1:16:40] hallelujah he made you to rule over
[1:16:42] darkness
[1:16:42] he made you to rule over death in the
[1:16:45] very beginning he says it's not going to
[1:16:46] be the sun that rules the day
[1:16:48] but it'll be my wife she'll be the one
[1:16:51] to rule the darkness
[1:16:52] she'll be the one to defeat death oh
[1:16:55] hallelujah romans 16
[1:16:57] 20 and the god of peace shall brew satan
[1:17:00] under your feet shortly
[1:17:03] oh from the very beginning satan knew
[1:17:06] there'll be a seed come
[1:17:07] there's going to be a man born of a
[1:17:08] woman he's going to crush my head
[1:17:10] so the very first son born of a woman
[1:17:13] what did he cain do
[1:17:14] he killed him why he was afraid his head
[1:17:17] would be crushed
[1:17:18] and he's always been after that one but
[1:17:20] listen he can't do it this time
[1:17:23] he can't stop her she
[1:17:26] will crush his head the god of peace
[1:17:29] shall bruise satan
[1:17:30] under your feet shortly why because he
[1:17:33] must reign
[1:17:34] until all his enemies have been placed
[1:17:37] under his feet
[1:17:38] and the last enemy which shall be
[1:17:40] destroyed is
[1:17:41] death the last enemy that shall be
[1:17:43] destroyed is darkness
[1:17:44] and there was one that was made to rule
[1:17:46] the darkness
[1:17:47] and it was the moon
[1:17:52] the bible says in isaiah 30 verse 26
[1:17:54] moreover the light of the moon
[1:17:56] shall be as the light of the sun
[1:18:00] no longer just a reflection no longer
[1:18:04] just a glimmer of light and darkness
[1:18:06] but behold thy light has come and the
[1:18:09] glory of the lord has risen upon thee
[1:18:11] and his glory shall be seen and they why
[1:18:13] the light of the moon has become
[1:18:15] as the light of the sun
[1:18:18] the same intensity the same fervency the
[1:18:20] same power the same glory
[1:18:22] the light of the moon shall be as the
[1:18:24] blood of the sun and the light of the
[1:18:26] sun shall be seven
[1:18:27] fold as the light of seven days
[1:18:31] in the day that the lord binded up the
[1:18:33] breach of his people
[1:18:34] headstone being united with capstone and
[1:18:37] healeth the stroke of their wound
[1:18:39] what is the stroke of sin death it's
[1:18:42] this day
[1:18:43] the light of the moon is the same as the
[1:18:44] sun
[1:18:46] you can look out you can see the sun you
[1:18:48] can see the moon there might be the odd
[1:18:50] time when the moon is glowing in such a
[1:18:52] way where you wonder
[1:18:53] there could be an odd twilight time
[1:18:54] where the sun may look like the moon
[1:18:56] that's not what's being expressed here
[1:18:57] saying the light of the moon shall be as
[1:19:00] brother man said life of his life power
[1:19:02] of his power
[1:19:04] she is him
[1:19:07] he writes into chapter three of the
[1:19:08] church age but the true church of jesus
[1:19:10] christ the bride is likened to pure gold
[1:19:12] her righteousness is his righteousness
[1:19:14] her attributes are his own glorious
[1:19:16] attributes
[1:19:16] her identity is found in him what he is
[1:19:19] she is to reflect
[1:19:20] what he has she is to manifest there is
[1:19:22] no fault in her
[1:19:24] she's all glorious within and without
[1:19:26] from the beginning to ending she is the
[1:19:28] work of her lord
[1:19:29] and all his works are perfect in fact in
[1:19:32] her is summed up
[1:19:33] and manifested the eternal wisdom and
[1:19:36] purpose of god in her is summed up
[1:19:41] and her summed up the eternal wisdom and
[1:19:43] purpose of god
[1:19:44] she is his righteousness her attributes
[1:19:48] are his own glorious attributes
[1:19:50] in the thigh tree and church age he says
[1:19:52] this about the bride this is when he's
[1:19:54] drawn the contrast between mystery
[1:19:55] babylon and the bride
[1:19:56] i'll just take what he says about you
[1:19:58] she is called the bride of christ
[1:20:00] she has called new jerusalem she's
[1:20:01] exalted to heaven sharing the very
[1:20:03] throne of god
[1:20:04] as the only place befitting such a queen
[1:20:07] you take the place that satan wanted no
[1:20:10] wonder he's howling no wonder he hates
[1:20:12] you no wonder he tries to turn things up
[1:20:14] side down and cause you to doubt these
[1:20:16] things bring draw you into the wrong
[1:20:18] places and cause confusion because you
[1:20:20] are called and ordained
[1:20:21] to occupy a place that was only reserved
[1:20:24] for you
[1:20:26] oh you are exalted to heaven
[1:20:30] sharing the very throne of god as the
[1:20:32] only place
[1:20:33] that's be fit for you there's only one
[1:20:36] place
[1:20:36] that's that's worthy of you the very
[1:20:39] throne of god
[1:20:40] to place you anywhere else you're more
[1:20:43] you're worth more
[1:20:45] he'd do you a disservice he says there's
[1:20:47] only one place i could put you
[1:20:49] that would do you any credit it's in my
[1:20:51] place
[1:20:53] the only place i could put you that
[1:20:55] could express to you how much i love you
[1:20:57] is my place the place i have to raise
[1:21:00] you to the highest place
[1:21:02] i have to exalt it to the highest place
[1:21:04] so that you can understand that's how
[1:21:05] much you're worth to me
[1:21:08] what is it darkness and delight from
[1:21:10] death and to life
[1:21:12] from the dust of the earth to the stars
[1:21:14] of heaven
[1:21:16] that pondered that and i thought of this
[1:21:21] when he says you're exalted to heaven
[1:21:26] you're exalted the new jerusalem you
[1:21:28] exalted to heaven
[1:21:31] and there's a time in the bible there
[1:21:34] was a woman named hedessa
[1:21:36] in the bible and she's a jew living in
[1:21:40] captivity
[1:21:43] and there comes a time when at this
[1:21:46] junction
[1:21:49] it's life or death for the jews
[1:21:53] and she's at this crossroads of life and
[1:21:56] death
[1:21:58] and it's the pivotal it's the pivotal
[1:21:59] story in the book of esther
[1:22:02] it says in chapter 2 verse 7 and he
[1:22:04] brought up talking about mordecai which
[1:22:05] is a small man
[1:22:07] maybe like five seven kind of like
[1:22:08] brother branham's height
[1:22:10] a small man he brought up hedessa
[1:22:13] brought up means he raised her up caused
[1:22:15] her to be faithful
[1:22:15] odessa means myrtle tree so here's this
[1:22:19] hedesa even that maybe a hard sounding
[1:22:21] hedessa
[1:22:22] it's earth brown it has its roots into
[1:22:24] the earth he says he raised her up and
[1:22:26] he says
[1:22:26] that is esther he's somebody to his
[1:22:29] niece or his cousin
[1:22:31] he brought up podessa his uncle's
[1:22:33] daughter he brought her up and it's not
[1:22:35] just tedessa
[1:22:36] but it's esther so though she has a name
[1:22:39] given to her that's myrtle tree that's
[1:22:41] earthbound that's rooted into the earth
[1:22:43] she's given another name
[1:22:44] in this as a gentile her name is star
[1:22:48] so she has one representation which is
[1:22:50] earthbound but she has another
[1:22:52] representation which is heavenly which
[1:22:54] is esther
[1:22:55] and it was already signifying though she
[1:22:57] was a captive
[1:22:58] though she was a prisoner though she was
[1:23:00] a slave in babylon
[1:23:02] as odessa she had a destiny for the
[1:23:04] throne
[1:23:06] and in esther chapter 3 verse 13
[1:23:09] at this conspiracy of haman it says
[1:23:11] there were letters sent by post all the
[1:23:12] king's providences
[1:23:14] to destroy to kill and to cost to perish
[1:23:17] all
[1:23:18] jews this is the proclamation that goes
[1:23:21] out and we know from the book
[1:23:22] once it's said it can't be reversed
[1:23:26] the king could not say never mind
[1:23:30] uh you can't they you can't kill them
[1:23:35] but god by ordination by predestination
[1:23:39] had taken a hedesa and made her an
[1:23:41] esther
[1:23:42] and where was she placed right in the
[1:23:44] king's house
[1:23:46] and mordecai goes to and he's talking to
[1:23:48] her this time this is the next chapter
[1:23:49] verse 14 of chapter four
[1:23:51] and he's talking to esther listen think
[1:23:53] about what's happened haman has put this
[1:23:55] conspiracy into the place
[1:23:56] it's appointed for all of us to die and
[1:23:59] our lives are at stake
[1:24:00] it says if you hold your peace at this
[1:24:02] time then there's shall be enlargement
[1:24:04] and deliverance arise to the jews from
[1:24:06] another place
[1:24:07] but thou and thy fathers how shall be
[1:24:09] destroyed and who knoweth whether thou
[1:24:11] art come to the kingdom for such a time
[1:24:14] as this
[1:24:16] he's trying to tell her esther look at
[1:24:18] the path that you've taken
[1:24:21] how could it be that you're placed here
[1:24:23] now
[1:24:24] for this time this season these things
[1:24:27] that are taking place
[1:24:28] this is no coincidence you can't make
[1:24:29] this stuff up
[1:24:31] god has placed you in the king's house
[1:24:33] he's given you favor
[1:24:34] you're here now why because you're the
[1:24:37] source
[1:24:39] you're the source of our deliverance now
[1:24:41] let's all us wise men
[1:24:43] not all the king's counselors not all
[1:24:45] the ones that have been with them
[1:24:46] not all the wise men of the kingdom not
[1:24:48] all the ones that are his counselors
[1:24:49] but you the the hadessa the myrtle tree
[1:24:53] that's been made an esther
[1:24:54] to sit in his court you're the one
[1:24:56] through which the deliverance will come
[1:24:59] and so she was inspired by the message
[1:25:01] of the hour
[1:25:02] and the very next chapter in ephesians
[1:25:04] chapter five verses one to three excuse
[1:25:05] me esther chapter five
[1:25:07] verses one to three now it came to pass
[1:25:08] on the third day
[1:25:11] esther put on her royal apparel stood in
[1:25:14] the inner court of the king's house
[1:25:15] here's the bride's resurrection
[1:25:17] on the third day she puts on her royal
[1:25:19] apparel dressed in the
[1:25:21] god's word and stood in the inner court
[1:25:24] of the king's house over against the
[1:25:26] king's house and the king sat upon his
[1:25:28] royal throne in the royal house
[1:25:29] over against the gate of the house and
[1:25:31] it was so
[1:25:33] when the king saw esther now remember
[1:25:36] it was death to go there without being
[1:25:38] summoned
[1:25:41] what brought her faith
[1:25:45] by the message of the hour gave her
[1:25:47] faith to look at death
[1:25:49] and not be afraid of it anymore the
[1:25:52] message of the hour gave her confidence
[1:25:54] in the one that was in that room the one
[1:25:56] that was in the inner chamber
[1:25:57] the one that she would be seeing face to
[1:25:59] face with the host of camp again
[1:26:01] against me i will not fear one thing
[1:26:03] have i desired that will i seek after to
[1:26:05] behold the beauty of the lord to inquire
[1:26:07] in his temple
[1:26:08] i'm not afraid to come into the inner
[1:26:09] court why he's called me by my name
[1:26:11] he summoned me well i didn't hear it
[1:26:13] it's in here it's in my heart confidence
[1:26:15] draws me
[1:26:16] i know for such a time as this i could
[1:26:18] come boldly before the throne of grace
[1:26:23] and the king saw esther stand in the
[1:26:25] court and she obtained favor in his
[1:26:27] sight
[1:26:29] and the king held out to esther the
[1:26:30] golden scepter that was in his hand so
[1:26:32] esther drew near
[1:26:33] touched the top of the scepter then said
[1:26:34] the king unto her what wilt thou queen
[1:26:36] esther
[1:26:37] and what is thy request it shall be
[1:26:39] given thee to the half of the kingdom
[1:26:42] and i read one time in a commentary that
[1:26:44] this didn't simply mean she got her half
[1:26:46] it meant the rest of it was hers too
[1:26:49] that this is his way of saying it's all
[1:26:51] yours
[1:26:53] whatever you desire and what she asked
[1:26:56] for
[1:26:56] in the the next days that unfolded
[1:26:58] through these feasts
[1:27:00] feasting with her king in the presence
[1:27:02] of her enemy
[1:27:04] hallelujah seven-fold core seven-course
[1:27:06] meal
[1:27:07] feasted in the presence of her enemies
[1:27:09] is through that opening of that word and
[1:27:11] that communion with her king
[1:27:12] that she unfolds the conspiracy of this
[1:27:15] one who would bring her to death and she
[1:27:17] shares it with him
[1:27:18] and the king being unable to reverse the
[1:27:20] decree empowers her and her people
[1:27:24] to defend against the threat of death
[1:27:27] oh hallelujah and they gave her this
[1:27:30] commandment when the king granted the
[1:27:31] jews
[1:27:32] which are in every city to gather
[1:27:34] themselves together
[1:27:35] and to stand for their life to destroy
[1:27:38] to slay
[1:27:39] and to cause to perish all the power of
[1:27:42] the people
[1:27:42] in the province that would assault them
[1:27:44] listen death is still
[1:27:46] active death will still work on others
[1:27:48] death still has rain
[1:27:50] darkness has rain but there's a people
[1:27:52] in earth today
[1:27:54] that says i do not have to die because
[1:27:56] of sin death does not have hold over me
[1:27:59] i've been empowered by the word of god
[1:28:01] to look at death that would come to my
[1:28:03] door
[1:28:03] my family my children and say death no
[1:28:06] more
[1:28:08] why because he raised up the moon he
[1:28:10] raised up an esther from the dust to the
[1:28:12] stars
[1:28:13] not to rule over the day but to rule
[1:28:15] over death to rule over darkness
[1:28:17] that's my place
[1:28:22] he empowered the jews to say you've come
[1:28:25] to murder me
[1:28:26] i've got a right to fight back and to
[1:28:29] place death under your feet
[1:28:31] and it says in the next chapter thus the
[1:28:33] jews smote all their enemies
[1:28:35] with the stroke of the sword and
[1:28:37] slaughter and destruction and did what
[1:28:39] they would to all those who hated them
[1:28:43] let me just take a victory swig
[1:28:49] praise the lord
[1:28:54] it's beautiful the last enemy that shall
[1:28:57] be destroyed
[1:28:58] is death darkness and death are satan's
[1:29:01] kingdom
[1:29:02] what is light doing now separating light
[1:29:04] from darkness
[1:29:06] which light did it give to rule over
[1:29:08] darkness
[1:29:09] gave that to the bride and he says so
[1:29:12] when this corruptable
[1:29:13] shall have put on in corruption in this
[1:29:16] mortal you know what the word mortal
[1:29:17] means
[1:29:18] destined to die determined to die
[1:29:22] but it says when this mortal shall have
[1:29:23] put on immortality
[1:29:25] then shall be brought to pass the same
[1:29:27] that is written death
[1:29:28] and swallowed up in victory
[1:29:33] i'm living for that moment i'm living
[1:29:36] for that hour
[1:29:38] because that's the destiny of this bride
[1:29:39] in this end time
[1:29:42] we'll invite sister cassandra to come
[1:29:46] genesis chapter 22 verse 17 says this to
[1:29:49] abraham
[1:29:50] that in blessing i will bless thee and
[1:29:52] in multiplying i will multiply
[1:29:54] thy seed now remember it was to seed
[1:29:58] as to one that's to whom the promise was
[1:30:01] given
[1:30:03] and the the seed is christ
[1:30:06] but he is going to have a multiplication
[1:30:09] why because he's bringing many sons into
[1:30:11] glory
[1:30:12] and notice what he refers to left first
[1:30:14] he refers to first in the multiplication
[1:30:17] i will multiply thy seed as the stars
[1:30:20] of the heaven that's the first one
[1:30:23] that's mentioned
[1:30:24] what does that represent the royal bride
[1:30:27] to the royal abraham
[1:30:29] he says it has the sand which is upon
[1:30:31] the seashore that's the natural lineage
[1:30:33] to natural abraham
[1:30:35] but the first one that is mentioned is
[1:30:37] the royal bride
[1:30:39] to the royal bridegroom the stars of
[1:30:42] heaven
[1:30:43] and thy seed shall possess the gate
[1:30:46] of his enemies that's your promise
[1:30:50] why because he's made you to rule over
[1:30:52] darkness
[1:30:53] you have dominion right now over sin the
[1:30:55] world the flesh and the devil
[1:30:57] that's your that's your position today
[1:30:59] in christ
[1:31:01] you've been raised from the dust to the
[1:31:03] stars
[1:31:07] as i pondered this
[1:31:11] i was looking at the message desperation
[1:31:17] he says you can't be desperate till god
[1:31:19] speaks to you
[1:31:21] as god spoke to you
[1:31:24] he says old church rise and shake
[1:31:28] yourself
[1:31:30] pinch your conscience wake yourself up
[1:31:34] in this hour
[1:31:35] we must be desperate or perish
[1:31:40] there's coming forth something from the
[1:31:41] lord i know it is thus saith the lord
[1:31:43] there's coming forth something and we
[1:31:45] better get desperate
[1:31:47] it's between life and death it'll pass
[1:31:50] through us
[1:31:50] and we won't see it that tells me if
[1:31:53] it's between life and death then i need
[1:31:55] to get
[1:31:55] desperate he says oh church rise and
[1:31:58] shake yourself
[1:32:00] could we do that ourselves personally i
[1:32:02] must rise and shake myself i gotta wake
[1:32:04] myself
[1:32:05] pinch my conscience i must be desperate
[1:32:07] to perish
[1:32:09] that's why he said the days of playing
[1:32:11] church is over this isn't this isn't
[1:32:13] playing games we're not playing games
[1:32:15] with laodicea
[1:32:16] we can't think for a moment we've got
[1:32:18] the upper hand on this because we think
[1:32:20] we know who we are
[1:32:21] but we have to have a revelation there
[1:32:23] must be a desperation that comes with it
[1:32:25] i believe
[1:32:26] god has spoken to us because he's spoken
[1:32:28] to us i can get desperate
[1:32:31] you can't be desperate till god speaks
[1:32:33] to you go rise
[1:32:34] shake yourself make this part of your
[1:32:37] personal prayer today
[1:32:38] i want to shake myself i want to pinch
[1:32:41] my conscience
[1:32:43] i must be desperate or perish today in
[1:32:46] this hour once again
[1:32:47] he's separating life from death light
[1:32:50] from darkness
[1:32:51] i must be desperate it's between
[1:32:55] life and death let's stand to our feet
[1:33:04] he's made you
[1:33:07] to rule over the darkness

[1:34:05] for them

[1:34:08] own life or how many times they've moved
[1:34:10] and all the different places they've
[1:34:12] gone and their ups and downs and their
[1:34:14] ends and out may they look to the new
[1:34:15] book

[1:34:19] the beginning you place the star there
[1:34:21] and that star has never fallen

[1:34:31] hung in the gallery
[1:34:33] of god's elect one day you'll come to
[1:34:35] your place in your position in the body
