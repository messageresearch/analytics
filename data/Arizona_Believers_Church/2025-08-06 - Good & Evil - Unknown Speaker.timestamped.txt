[0:00] Romans chapter 7 verse 14. For we know
[0:02] that the law is spiritual, but I am
[0:04] carnal sold under sin. For that which I
[0:07] do not, that I that which I do, I allow
[0:11] not. For what I would, that do I not.
[0:14] But what I hate, that do I. If then I do
[0:17] that which I would not, I consent unto
[0:19] the law, that it is good. Now then it is
[0:22] no more I that do it, but sin that
[0:24] dwelleth in me. There's a lot of lot of
[0:26] heavy words here. For I know that in me,
[0:28] that is in my flesh, dwelleth no good
[0:30] thing. For to will is present with me.
[0:32] But how to perform that which is good, I
[0:34] find not. For the good that I would, I
[0:36] do not. But the evil which I would not,
[0:39] that I do. Now if I do that I would not,
[0:42] it is no more I that do it, but sin that
[0:44] dwelleth in me. I find then a law, a law
[0:48] that when I would do good, evil is
[0:50] present with me. For I delight in the
[0:52] law of God after the inward man. But I
[0:54] see another law in my members. Warren
[0:56] against the law of my mind and bring him
[0:58] into captivity to the law of sin which
[1:00] is in my members. Oh wretched man that I
[1:02] am. Who shall deliver me from the body
[1:06] of this death? And verse 25 is the
[1:08] answer. I thank God through Jesus Christ
[1:10] our Lord. In other words, he will.
[1:13] &gt;&gt; So then with the mind I myself serve the
[1:15] law of God, but with the flesh the law
[1:18] of sin. What a contrast. Amen. You can
[1:21] be seated. My title this evening is good
[1:24] and evil. Good and evil. I like to say
[1:28] at the outset that we're grappling with
[1:30] the concept of evil. And I believe that
[1:33] there is uh some sense of reframing it
[1:38] or speaking about it in such a way to
[1:39] where we can accept its existence. It
[1:41] doesn't mean that we have to accept evil
[1:43] or believe that evil is okay, but it's
[1:46] understanding why we even suffer it. And
[1:49] believe it or not, the concepts of good
[1:51] and evil are widely debated and it's a
[1:53] really hot uh topic with respect to
[1:55] philosophy. And maybe that's what's been
[1:58] debated throughout all ages is these
[2:00] concepts of good and evil. But we're
[2:02] looking at it in the reality of
[2:04] Christians, the reality of truth and how
[2:07] that there can be evil and the existence
[2:09] of evil when there is such a good God
[2:11] that we serve. And so I think there's a
[2:12] lot to wrestle with. And one of the
[2:14] things that God dealt with me in coming
[2:16] to this place is that when we've been
[2:18] preaching on God's creation and the art
[2:21] of God and his purpose in expressing us,
[2:24] there is this idea of perfection uh
[2:27] which would say maybe is the antithesis
[2:29] to sin where sin is to miss the mark and
[2:32] perfection is you meet the mark and
[2:33] there's a great beauty in that and
[2:35] there's a lot to be desired in that.
[2:37] then we can get the sense that well if
[2:39] there's any imperfections if there's
[2:40] anything lacking then we we're kind of
[2:42] out of the program of God but I believe
[2:44] that we have to we have to think more
[2:46] scripturally about these things I hope
[2:48] that looking at this subject will help
[2:49] us do that and even understand why
[2:52] things have happened to us in our own
[2:53] lives and why we bear the scars of
[2:55] certain things and we've lost the
[2:57] privilege of certain things through bad
[2:59] fortune or through our own mistakes even
[3:01] in our own ignorance sometimes we do
[3:02] things and it comes back to us where
[3:05] it's like I didn't know had I known at
[3:07] the time, I never would have done this.
[3:08] And it's really difficult uh to truly
[3:12] move beyond that in a sense or to live
[3:14] free of that. And though you can't
[3:16] change what's happened, there's a way
[3:18] that God can help give it a bigger
[3:20] picture. You can look at it in the end
[3:22] and say, you know what, I thank God
[3:24] &gt;&gt; that he's delivered me from that. I
[3:27] thank God that he's been able to use it
[3:28] for these purposes. And there's a lot
[3:30] that we could just even kind of
[3:32] freestyle on in the outset because
[3:33] there's so much in this. Now on Sunday
[3:36] we were using a principle in music
[3:37] theory and how that uh the use of
[3:39] consonants and dissonance is used in
[3:42] order to produce a sound this sense of
[3:45] completion and rest. Uh Preston and I
[3:48] were at the piano and I mentioned
[3:49] something. He goes well that's neat too.
[3:51] He said but this here over here he said
[3:54] but this is not really how it is. And we
[3:55] went to the piano and he started showing
[3:57] me different things and he started using
[3:58] a lot of fancy terminologies and like I
[4:01] told brother Mike already I'm I'm in
[4:03] over my head. Uh but it was enjoyable
[4:05] just to see how those things certain
[4:07] chords can be used and it creates some
[4:10] sort of suspense but then when the
[4:13] consonant is played it resolves that. I
[4:15] think even the Jaws theme is just this
[4:17] alternating uh suspenseful anticip
[4:22] right you want it to to you want it to
[4:24] resolve right without something jumping
[4:26] out of the water to eat you. And so
[4:28] there's this these two principles of
[4:30] consonance and dissonance. Consonants as
[4:32] we try to define it here is something
[4:34] that is agreeable or pleasant, good or
[4:37] pleasing is one way to say it. So if
[4:39] there's consonants, it it kind of it
[4:41] fits. It harmonizes that it doesn't
[4:44] fight or oppose. It's it's agreeable.
[4:46] There's harmony. But dissonance is
[4:48] something that is just simply
[4:50] disagreeable or unpleasant. And it's a
[4:52] sound that in itself seems like it's
[4:55] lacking something to be complete. It
[4:57] needs something uh to complete it and
[4:59] and and resolve it. And so there's ways
[5:02] that you could describe this peace and
[5:04] conflict, rest and tension, and these
[5:06] are these stability, instability, and
[5:09] those are ways that we could frame this
[5:10] in the concept of music theory. But it
[5:12] it really is the classic good and evil
[5:15] or good versus evil maybe how some
[5:17] people say it. And I I'll say this that
[5:20] the truth that we see or this principle
[5:22] in music uh that shows that you can have
[5:25] good and you can have consonants and
[5:27] dissonance or good and evil and somehow
[5:29] it creates something that's engaging or
[5:31] beautiful as far as a masterpiece. Uh
[5:33] that's not the truth. That's just seeing
[5:35] something in music that mirrors a truth
[5:37] that we see in God's word or as a type
[5:40] in God's word. So you see how God works
[5:42] and how God does things. Brother
[5:44] Brandham even says that God likes to
[5:46] surprise you. says like a husband
[5:48] getting a gift for his wife and he says
[5:49] just hold you in suspense. Well, well,
[5:51] that doesn't seem very fair, does it?
[5:53] Why does God wait till the last minute?
[5:55] Why didn't God just show up before
[5:56] Lazarus passed away and perform the
[5:58] miracle to heal him? But God just has
[6:00] this nature like a husband trying to
[6:02] surprise his wife. He doesn't want the
[6:04] surprise to be spoiled. He waits to the
[6:05] last moment and then God does this
[6:07] surprise. And that's just the way that
[6:08] God is. It's the way that God has
[6:10] manifested himself through time. So it's
[6:12] not that music theory holds the truth,
[6:14] but this principle in music is used as a
[6:16] type to see this truth that we can
[6:18] identify when it comes to the nature of
[6:20] God or the reality of the scripture that
[6:22] good and evil are existing together, but
[6:24] yet God's going to make something
[6:25] beautiful out of it. And I would say
[6:28] that music itself is engaging and
[6:30] beautiful when these two things
[6:32] consonants and dissonance are creatively
[6:34] combined. And brother Brandham uses the
[6:37] phrase the law of contrast to to kind of
[6:40] set forth uh these two this existence of
[6:42] these two different things. Whether we
[6:44] say consonants for that which is good or
[6:45] dissonance for that which is evil. He
[6:47] uses that phrase law of contrast. And
[6:50] there's a lot that goes into this law
[6:52] and I'd like to just define it in the
[6:54] simple sense that it's the perception of
[6:55] something perceiving something or
[6:57] thinking of something is likely to
[6:59] trigger the thought of its direct
[7:01] opposite. in that you see this law of
[7:03] contrast when you think of something
[7:05] cold or you perceive cold you think of
[7:07] the opposite hot. I don't know if it
[7:09] applies, but I do remember very vividly
[7:11] that when uh for Elliot's first summer
[7:14] in Phoenix back in maybe 200, I don't
[7:16] know, maybe nine or so. It was a really
[7:18] really hot summer and and he was uh he
[7:21] went outside and it was really really
[7:23] hot and I think my his uncle Matthew and
[7:25] maybe a crew were doing some work
[7:26] outside was here in Phoenix and and he
[7:29] went outside and it was really hot. So
[7:31] he came indoors and he asked for his
[7:32] coat, his winter coat because it was hot
[7:35] outside. And the way that I framed it
[7:37] was that the feeling of hot immediately
[7:39] began to think about cold and he
[7:41] remembered when he was cold he wore a
[7:42] jacket. And so I think the logic was
[7:44] lacking there a little bit at one years
[7:45] old. But there's the law of contrast
[7:47] that when you experience one thing or
[7:48] perceive one things you begin to think
[7:50] of it in terms of its opposite. That's
[7:53] that's the law of contrast. When you
[7:54] perceive something it's likely to
[7:57] trigger its direct opposite. In Genesis
[8:01] 3:7, I believe this is the law of
[8:03] contrast being manifested and to come
[8:05] into existence because once they ate the
[8:08] fruit of the tree of knowledge of good
[8:10] and evil, it says, "Their eyes were
[8:11] opened and they knew that they were
[8:13] naked and they sewed fig leaves together
[8:15] and made themselves aprons." What was
[8:18] operated? The law of contrast. They had
[8:20] been naked but not ashamed. But now that
[8:22] they've perceived something and their
[8:25] eyes are open, they immediately begin to
[8:27] think of the opposite, which was no
[8:29] shame. They begin to think of uh
[8:32] righteousness and they begin to think of
[8:33] holiness. And this perception of the law
[8:35] of contrast motivated them to begin to
[8:38] dress themselves and then it caused them
[8:40] to even hide themselves. So I believe
[8:42] it's that law of contrast that's taking
[8:45] place where this perceiving of one thing
[8:48] makes you think of the opposite. In
[8:50] Romans chapter 7
[8:52] 14, we'll read to verse 21 uh just for
[8:55] time sake here. And he says,"For we know
[8:57] that the law is spiritual, but I am
[8:59] carnal, sold under sin." So there's some
[9:02] debt to sin. He's in in he's a in
[9:06] bondage to sin. So there's your uh even
[9:09] if you want to use it in a philosophical
[9:11] sense that if there is in fact a slave
[9:13] morality or enslavement or a bondage
[9:15] that's created between a master and a
[9:18] servant, it's really between the
[9:19] individual and sin. And so for that
[9:22] which I would do, I allow not. For that
[9:25] which I do, I allow not. There's this
[9:27] wrestling. For what I would, that do I
[9:28] not. But what I hate, that do I. What a
[9:32] awful wrestling. If then I do that which
[9:35] I would not, I consent unto the law,
[9:38] that it is good, now then it is no more
[9:41] I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in
[9:43] me to to hate, to do those things that
[9:45] he would not. For I know that in me,
[9:47] that is my flesh, dwelleth no good
[9:49] thing. There's these principles of good
[9:50] and evil, good and evil, hatred and
[9:52] love. For to will is present with me,
[9:54] but how to perform that which is good, I
[9:56] find not. For the good that I would, I
[9:59] do not, but the evil which I would not,
[10:01] that I do. Maybe you go home and read it
[10:04] in the Amplified Bible or some other
[10:06] translations just to get it more
[10:07] clearly. But I think you kind of get an
[10:09] idea of what he's trying to say. Maybe
[10:10] it leaves a little bit to be desired.
[10:11] Like Paul, could you say it in a less uh
[10:14] clunky way? But what I want to do, the
[10:17] good that I want to achieve, the good
[10:19] that I desire to express, I find that I
[10:21] I don't have it in me to do. And the
[10:23] evil that I don't want to do, it seems
[10:25] to be that's what's the easiest.
[10:27] &gt;&gt; Right?
[10:28] &gt;&gt; Now, if I do that, I would not. Again,
[10:30] he says, "It's no more I that do it, but
[10:32] sin that dwelleth in me." This is in his
[10:34] flesh. Now, some will say this is Paul
[10:37] prior to his new birth experience. And
[10:40] that would certainly be contrary to what
[10:42] brother Brandham teaches, but it would
[10:44] also begin to obscure the idea that we
[10:47] in our flesh are going to wrestle with
[10:49] evil until the day we die. Not that
[10:51] we're always going to commit evil or
[10:53] that we always gonna say, "Well, I'm
[10:54] sorry if I commit fornication. I'm sorry
[10:55] if I cheat on you, honey. Sorry if I do
[10:57] that. Sorry if that. I'm just sold under
[10:58] sin. I'm just like Paul. The Apostle
[11:00] Paul couldn't do any better but to do
[11:01] evil. That's just an excuse and that's
[11:04] just as wrong as the other idea that
[11:06] this is just preconversion.
[11:08] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham's teaching teaches us
[11:10] that in within this framework that
[11:12] there's this acknowledgment that the
[11:14] flesh, the body is not redeemed.
[11:16] Therefore, it can get sick. The spirit
[11:18] is not yet fully redeemed. Therefore, it
[11:20] can doubt. It can get angry. It can
[11:22] desire. It can struggle. So then he just
[11:25] designs it this way or phrases it this
[11:27] way. Okay, we'll just summarize it with
[11:28] verse 21. I find then a law principle
[11:31] that when I would do good, evil is
[11:34] present with me.
[11:37] That even when I do good, there's evil.
[11:40] They exist. They coexist side by side.
[11:43] They're there. This is Paul and the
[11:45] reality of a Christian. This is the
[11:46] reality that you presently live in. Even
[11:48] when you do good, there's evil present.
[11:51] So when you do evil, there's good
[11:52] present. It's good and evil existing. in
[11:55] the sermon hearing recognizing acting on
[11:57] the word of God as we read Sunday he
[11:59] said that where there is good there is
[12:01] evil where there is right there is wrong
[12:04] so we know there is good we know that
[12:06] there also is evil but he's saying where
[12:08] they exist the other also exist
[12:14] uses the phrase the law of contrast
[12:18] and I would say that if you never knew
[12:20] anything but good
[12:22] then you would just know that as what it
[12:25] is.
[12:26] &gt;&gt; But it's when you perceive what good
[12:29] actually is. There is this this inverse
[12:31] of evil.
[12:33] &gt;&gt; There was this reality in the Garden of
[12:35] Eden where they were so innocent. They
[12:37] didn't have a vocabulary or an
[12:38] experience or a concept of evil. They
[12:42] only knew God. They only knew the
[12:43] reality of everything being perfect. I
[12:45] mean, they they they had it made. It was
[12:48] something complete. But it's the it's
[12:51] the perception even of evil then that
[12:53] really gives the context for good. He
[12:55] says and we will never no matter what
[12:57] our environment may be ever be able to
[12:59] shake ourselves from the presence of
[13:00] either.
[13:02] Even David said though I make my bed in
[13:04] hell thou art with me.
[13:06] &gt;&gt; So no matter where we are and no matter
[13:07] how evil it seems in life, there is a
[13:10] good or some present uh there's some
[13:12] good somewhere. But he says there's
[13:14] always good and evil. Proverbsap 15:3
[13:19] says, "The eyes of the Lord are in every
[13:20] place, beholding the evil and the good."
[13:24] There's evil and good all around us. As
[13:26] God's eyes uh walkth about looking to
[13:28] and fro through the earth, God sees good
[13:30] everywhere. He sees evil everywhere.
[13:34] In Isaiah 45:7, he said, "I form the
[13:37] light. I make peace.
[13:41] I create darkness and create evil." And
[13:44] he says it this way. I form the light
[13:45] and create darkness. I make peace and
[13:47] create evil. Notice how each one is
[13:49] phrased in such a way to where the light
[13:51] having been created and formed and set
[13:54] apart. It necessitates this existence of
[13:56] darkness. I make peace. And the very
[13:58] fact that there's peace is in contrast
[14:00] to evil. I the Lord do all these things.
[14:04] I would I I could posit this and I don't
[14:06] necessarily mean to do it in a even in a
[14:08] philosophical sense, but the existence
[14:11] of good and free will to choose it
[14:14] requires there to be an evil.
[14:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. If there's only good and you have
[14:17] the choice, then you're not going to go
[14:19] wrong.
[14:20] &gt;&gt; I I choose the good. Well, that's all
[14:22] that's all you had to choose from is all
[14:24] good. It's kind of that's that
[14:26] frustrating experience of going to a
[14:28] restaurant and asking the server, "So,
[14:29] what's good here?" And like everything.
[14:31] And you know then that you're probably
[14:33] going to pick the wrong thing. But they
[14:34] say everything's good. Well, that's not
[14:36] reality.
[14:38] And here when God said, "I set before
[14:39] you blessing and cursing there. In order
[14:42] for there to be blessing, there has to
[14:43] be the absence of it. And the full
[14:45] weight of it understood in the cursing.
[14:48] So we've expressed before what's true
[14:50] liberty unless there's some restrictions
[14:52] on that liberty.
[14:54] It's just absolute existence. This is
[14:58] this is something to really consider and
[15:00] think about. I I've been really I it
[15:04] seems to be the theme that just keeps
[15:05] coming up. But if you reject the idea of
[15:08] God, then you have to wholly embrace the
[15:10] concept of evil.
[15:12] &gt;&gt; Right?
[15:13] &gt;&gt; If if there is no truth, if there is no
[15:16] God, then then you have to give yourself
[15:18] wholly over to the other side, anti-
[15:20] good.
[15:21] &gt;&gt; So there in order there for it to be
[15:23] good,
[15:24] it requires this evil. Remember, God
[15:28] didn't remove darkness. He just put it
[15:30] in its place.
[15:32] &gt;&gt; God could have vanquished all darkness.
[15:34] He could have just tried to replicate
[15:35] that existence in the seventh dimension
[15:37] where he is where there is no night
[15:39] where there is uh no darkness at all.
[15:42] Instead of doing that immediately on
[15:43] earth when mankind when he was creating
[15:45] and he separates this chaos and this
[15:47] confusion and darkness he didn't just
[15:49] get rid of it but he divided it and he
[15:51] used it.
[15:54] And as we were sharing on Sunday
[15:57] the concepts of
[16:00] evil, we read in Romans chapter 8 28.
[16:03] And we know that all things, and that
[16:05] would have to include quote unquote bad
[16:07] things. All things work together for
[16:10] good to them that love God, to them who
[16:12] are the called
[16:13] &gt;&gt; according to his purpose. This is quite
[16:16] a qualifier.
[16:18] &gt;&gt; If we say, "Well, everything works for
[16:19] the good." We say, "Yes, for
[16:22] &gt;&gt; those that love God." Amen.
[16:23] &gt;&gt; And those who are called according to
[16:25] his purpose. So there's two binding
[16:28] elements or qualified elements that
[16:30] first you love God.
[16:32] &gt;&gt; And if you love God, there's this fear
[16:34] reverence for him. There's a trust. So
[16:37] all things work together for the good to
[16:39] them that love God. And then if I say
[16:42] two binding elements, maybe we'll just
[16:43] say it's one. Those that love God. And
[16:46] those that love God are them who are
[16:48] called according to his purpose. So then
[16:51] if you love God, you're trusting in his
[16:53] purpose. You're trusting in his will.
[16:54] And there's quite quite a lot that's
[16:56] meant here. So all things work together
[16:58] for good. It's not a change in semantics
[17:02] or terminology to say, "Oh, that's bad.
[17:03] That's bad." And we realize later, well,
[17:05] actually that's good. Like a lot of
[17:07] what's happened in the day and age that
[17:08] we're living in now. At one time, we
[17:10] could say that kind of behavior was not
[17:12] normal. As a matter of fact, you go even
[17:14] before that, that was illegal.
[17:17] &gt;&gt; This was absolutely illegal. And now the
[17:19] very things that were illegal are now
[17:22] celebrated as actually desirable or
[17:24] good. That is not a change in what uh
[17:27] from evil to good. That's a change in
[17:29] semantics. That's a change in
[17:31] terminology. That's saying, well, this
[17:33] thing over here that we used to think
[17:34] was evil, well, we just kind of socially
[17:36] constructed that and we're going to
[17:38] remove the stigma and now we're going to
[17:39] embrace it and say it's actually good.
[17:41] It's desirable.
[17:43] &gt;&gt; Even one of the arguments for population
[17:44] control is same-sex marriages.
[17:47] Can you imagine that? That's their
[17:49] solution. Wow, we're becoming overpop
[17:50] populated. And it's the insanity of
[17:52] rejecting the reality of God's word.
[17:56] &gt;&gt; So when all things work together for
[17:58] good, I know for myself, my
[17:59] understanding of this scripture I is is
[18:02] growing in that
[18:05] we could even look at things that are
[18:08] evil and bad and we might ask ourselves,
[18:11] how can there be any good that comes out
[18:13] of it? How can we even make sense of it?
[18:16] Well, we don't need to make sense of it.
[18:18] We desire to. We We want to understand
[18:21] within the context of our own existence,
[18:23] in the context of our lives, how this
[18:24] fits. But we know that if we love God,
[18:27] he has a purpose. And in the end, we
[18:30] won't be left desolate.
[18:32] &gt;&gt; In the end, this won't destroy me. It
[18:34] may shake me. It may be something that I
[18:36] have very difficult time with. There may
[18:37] be triggers. There may be scars. There
[18:39] may be losses of opportunity. But I know
[18:41] in the end, it'll all be made right.
[18:43] Amen.
[18:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:45] &gt;&gt; I believe even in my understanding of it
[18:47] is that this isn't just rebrand. It's
[18:50] we're not rebranding evil as good.
[18:54] And it's maybe even more than just
[18:56] saying, well, they all form this recipe
[18:58] of a good outcome,
[19:00] but it's it's understanding that those
[19:03] things aren't determinative.
[19:05] That this evil cannot hinder God's
[19:08] purpose for you. It cannot prevent God's
[19:10] love. in the context of this very
[19:11] chapter, God is going to end evil with
[19:14] good
[19:17] and that it can't nothing can separate
[19:18] you from his love. In Isaiah 5 20 it
[19:22] says, "Woe unto them that call evil good
[19:24] and good evil." This is a woe. Woe,
[19:29] right? This stop. Don't do it. This
[19:32] there this is a uh something displeasing
[19:34] to God. To call something evil good is
[19:37] wrong. And and he says, "And to put
[19:39] darkness for light and light for
[19:41] darkness." So to call evil good and good
[19:43] evil, to put darkness for light and
[19:45] light for darkness, that put bitter for
[19:46] sweet and sweet for bitter. These are
[19:48] different things.
[19:50] They have different characteristics.
[19:52] They have distinctions.
[19:55] There is a there's a danger there's a
[19:57] woe to those that would look at
[19:59] something evil and try to rebrand it as
[20:01] good. So that if it's evil, it has to
[20:04] retain its essential characteristic or
[20:06] characterization or character as evil.
[20:10] No time can change that.
[20:13] That so when we say all things work
[20:15] together for good, you're not going to
[20:16] end up one day at 66 years old and say I
[20:20] believe my father's abusive attitude
[20:22] towards me and crippling me and making
[20:24] me blind by beating me incessantly for
[20:26] 30 years was good.
[20:29] &gt;&gt; No, that's horrible. Right.
[20:31] &gt;&gt; That's bad.
[20:32] &gt;&gt; So, it's not You can't change what's
[20:35] evil and call it good.
[20:37] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[20:38] &gt;&gt; You can't take darkness and say it's
[20:40] actually light. But God will resolve all
[20:42] evil by bringing good to you.
[20:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:49] &gt;&gt; And causing you to rest.
[20:52] He resolves the evil because he's going
[20:54] to bring you to a place not where you
[20:56] not where you doing a revisionist
[20:58] history on everything and say, "Oh,
[20:59] well, everything was always this way. It
[21:01] was always good." You just come to a
[21:02] place and say, "Lord, I accept I I
[21:04] accept you. I'm at peace with you."
[21:08] Now, if we could, I want to look at the
[21:10] origins of good and evil in the context
[21:13] of the lives that we live now. Modern
[21:15] life, maybe the biblical genealogy of
[21:18] morality and the genesis of evil. Where
[21:20] does it come from?
[21:22] look at it from a scriptural standpoint
[21:24] because we could say, well, how do we
[21:26] get our concepts of evil? And we might
[21:28] begin to look more socially in terms of,
[21:30] well, how do us as Americans view it? We
[21:32] might look to our law and the code of
[21:34] law and we might look to certain ideas.
[21:35] And you go to other civilizations and
[21:37] you recognize these different frameworks
[21:39] and attitudes and ideas and you'll find
[21:41] that in different countries in different
[21:43] regions and different areas and
[21:44] different cultures there different
[21:46] levels maybe morality and they said they
[21:48] I derived this conviction this morality
[21:50] based upon my ancestors and the
[21:52] evolution of our thinking and our sense
[21:54] of justice and equity even to the point
[21:56] to where if we use the musical concept
[21:58] in some cultures a dissonant chord isn't
[22:01] disagreeable.
[22:03] If you started playing the Jaws theme,
[22:05] they might be like, "This is very nice."
[22:07] Right? And you say, "Very nice. My
[22:09] skin's crawling." Because they don't
[22:11] perceive the dissonance the same way
[22:13] that we in our western culture would
[22:15] perceive it the same way. So, in some
[22:17] ways, there's these ideas of things
[22:18] shifting and it's hard to nail it down
[22:20] and hard to pin it down. So, we could
[22:22] just look at the Bible and at least say
[22:24] from the biblical perspective, this is
[22:27] the genealogy of morality or good. This
[22:29] is where the genesis of evil is. Genesis
[22:32] chapter 2:9, we see them in the same
[22:34] verse. And out of the ground made the
[22:35] Lord God to grow every tree that is
[22:38] pleasant to the sight and good for food.
[22:40] There's two ideas, pleasant,
[22:42] pleasantness and good. It was visually
[22:46] pleasing and actually satisfactory to
[22:48] eat. But then he transitions to things
[22:51] that do not grow out of the ground, nor
[22:53] are they just merely beautiful to the
[22:55] eyes, nor can they be eaten in the way
[22:57] that a tree that grew out of the ground.
[22:59] says, "The tree of life also in the
[23:00] midst of the garden."
[23:02] &gt;&gt; So now there's the tree of life in the
[23:03] midst of the garden and the tree of
[23:06] knowledge of good and evil.
[23:08] Although it doesn't say it's also in the
[23:10] midst of the garden, it's mentioned this
[23:12] way in the sense that they are in the
[23:15] midst of the garden. Brother Random the
[23:16] church age group book describes it as
[23:20] being woven together and growing
[23:23] together as two vines.
[23:25] So you have the tree of life and the
[23:28] tree of knowledge of good and evil.
[23:30] &gt;&gt; So there's not just the tree of good and
[23:32] evil. It's the tree of knowledge.
[23:34] Knowledge of what? Knowledge of good and
[23:36] evil.
[23:37] &gt;&gt; Prior to their eyes being open, they
[23:39] only had knowledge of
[23:42] God. Good.
[23:45] &gt;&gt; The tree of knowledge, that's skill or
[23:47] perception. So it's the skill or
[23:49] perception of good and evil. It's a
[23:51] discernment or understanding wisdom in
[23:54] good or evil or and evil. Notice how
[23:57] it's one step further. Not just a
[23:59] knowledge of good, not just a perception
[24:01] of good, but now there's this perception
[24:03] of what is good and what is evil. Good
[24:06] is defined. Even in the Hebrew, the word
[24:08] is agreeable or pleasant. Speaks of
[24:09] welfare, prosperity, happiness, or
[24:11] something that is a benefit. A tree of
[24:13] things agreeable. Knowledge of things
[24:15] that are agreeable or pleasant.
[24:16] Knowledge of consonants or this evil.
[24:20] Oh, I'd love it. Before we go on, God in
[24:22] the first two chapters of Genesis, he
[24:24] remarks eight times about the goodness
[24:26] of his creation. He saw that it was
[24:29] good. He saw that it was good and he
[24:30] sees it very good. It's it's right. It's
[24:32] appropriate. It's becoming. That's all
[24:34] that it was.
[24:36] But then evil is something disagreeable
[24:38] or unpleasant, a distress, a misery, a
[24:41] calamity, an injury, a wrong, some sort
[24:44] of detriment. Whereas the the good is a
[24:46] benefit. But now we have the tree and
[24:48] the knowledge of good, things that can
[24:50] be a benefit, things that are pleasing,
[24:51] things that are happy, things that lead
[24:53] to prosperity. But then we have this
[24:54] knowledge also of things that are evil
[24:57] that cause injury or wrong or a
[24:59] detriment. And it's this tree, the tree
[25:03] of knowledge, of good and evil. The tree
[25:06] of knowledge of good and evil is in
[25:09] contrast to the tree of life. What is
[25:12] the tree of life? It's the tree of
[25:13] eternal life.
[25:16] The tree of knowledge of good and evil
[25:17] is a mixed tree.
[25:19] It's not just evil, right? It's not just
[25:22] a tree of knowledge of evil, but it's
[25:24] the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
[25:26] It's mingled good with bad.
[25:28] &gt;&gt; You're going to have both. If I could
[25:30] say this, all life on earth originates
[25:32] from that tree.
[25:34] &gt;&gt; If we all originated from the tree of
[25:35] life, there would be no death. There
[25:37] would be no sin. But all that was that
[25:40] lives today in the world that we live in
[25:42] today comes from the tree of the
[25:45] consequence or fruit of the tree. Our
[25:48] genealogy goes back to the tree of
[25:50] knowledge of good and evil. Therefore,
[25:53] all that is in the earth now and all
[25:56] that was good then now breathe the
[25:59] atmosphere of evil.
[26:04] But Christ,
[26:07] he is that tree of life in 2 Corinthians
[26:10] chapter 5 21. For he made him to be sin
[26:13] for us. Not in his genesis, but in his
[26:16] death. He wasn't sin from the beginning.
[26:19] He made him to be sin for us. There's
[26:21] the wounding. There's the marring. This
[26:23] is what made him a masterpiece.
[26:25] This is where that which is good now
[26:27] bears that which is evil. And now he
[26:29] even takes upon himself the tree of
[26:31] life. now bears the fruit of the tree of
[26:34] knowledge of good and evil in order to
[26:36] resolve it.
[26:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[26:38] &gt;&gt; Takes him who knew no sin that we might
[26:41] be made the righteousness of God in him.
[26:44] So Jesus Christ does not come from this
[26:46] evil economy. Really believe the the
[26:49] truth of the original sin helps us to
[26:51] understand who Christ is. If really it
[26:53] was just eating the apple uh that caused
[26:57] the fall, then I believe Jesus should
[26:58] have just been born and been give me a
[27:00] good hearty amen now. Been born from a
[27:03] woman through mother and father alert
[27:05] and then been on the carnivore diet.
[27:08] Come on. Come on, Republicans. Give me a
[27:10] hearty amen.
[27:11] &gt;&gt; Red meat, water, salt. Come on now.
[27:15] It was that's all that would have
[27:16] resolved it. Don't eat fruit.
[27:20] But we know that's not what he did. He
[27:22] was not born of an evil economy. In
[27:23] Psalm 51:5, behold, David says, I was
[27:26] shapen in iniquity and in sin did my
[27:28] mother conceive me.
[27:30] &gt;&gt; That doesn't mean she was in an
[27:31] adulterous affair. It doesn't mean he
[27:32] was conceived by someone other than his
[27:35] uh his father, though there's some that
[27:38] take the scripture to say imply that he
[27:40] was illegitimate.
[27:42] But he's saying, I was con the very act
[27:44] itself puts a stain on me. As Job said,
[27:47] how can the man be justified with God?
[27:49] Or how can he be clean that is born of a
[27:51] woman? Job 25:4
[27:55] not know it teaches us that Christ was
[27:57] not conceived in sin. He was not born
[28:01] between a man and a woman. Therefore,
[28:02] he's not stained by the original sin.
[28:06] Those of us who are born of a woman, we
[28:08] are born with sin
[28:11] uh in in our members. We're not clean
[28:14] from birth because in sin were we
[28:16] conceived. It's by virtue of that uh
[28:18] sexual conception and therefore this
[28:21] birth by the woman that we come forward
[28:23] into this world as this wrestling of
[28:26] good and evil
[28:28] &gt;&gt; in our flesh. But Christ, he's the tree
[28:30] of life.
[28:31] &gt;&gt; Think about this principle. Maybe do
[28:33] some uh searching in the scripture.
[28:35] Christ is the tree of life. Christ is
[28:37] the beginning and Christ is the fountain
[28:40] and Christ is where things begin. You're
[28:43] looking at Colossians that he might have
[28:44] the preeminence. Christ is the tree of
[28:46] life. He's the fountain of all
[28:47] understanding. He's the fountain of all
[28:49] wisdom. He's the fountain of all power.
[28:51] &gt;&gt; So this Christ is the Bible says the
[28:54] wisdom of God.
[28:55] &gt;&gt; Really think about that when Sunday I
[28:57] want to come to further this idea of how
[29:00] that evil exists amongst us
[29:03] and use the concept of death and how we
[29:05] all have to face that and we suffer and
[29:07] it's it's it's awful. You find that it's
[29:10] wisdom that is opposed to death. So
[29:13] Christ is that wisdom and power of God.
[29:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:17] &gt;&gt; Revelations chapter 22:2, Christ is that
[29:20] tree of life. And in Revelations chapter
[29:22] 22, it says, "In the midst of the street
[29:23] of it, that new Jerusalem, the city of
[29:25] God, on e either side of the river, was
[29:27] there the tree of life, which bare 12
[29:29] manner of fruits and yielded her fruit
[29:31] every month, and the leaves of the tree
[29:32] were for the healing of the nations."
[29:34] &gt;&gt; One thing you'll notice now is that
[29:36] there is no tree
[29:39] of knowledge of good and evil. It's not
[29:41] there.
[29:42] &gt;&gt; It's there in the beginning. It's
[29:44] remarkable the contrast of what we see
[29:46] in the beginning. All the Eden, the
[29:47] garden of God, the pleasure place of God
[29:49] and and his delight and everything was
[29:51] perfect and everything was wonderful.
[29:52] But yet God is setting that up.
[29:57] He knew it wouldn't end up there. As a
[29:58] matter of fact, he didn't want to though
[29:59] he started there. That's not where he
[30:01] wanted to end. He wanted to bring it to
[30:02] Revelations. He wanted this this heaven
[30:05] and earth with no evil in it at all.
[30:09] And so this tree of knowledge of good
[30:11] and evil, though it doesn't exist in
[30:12] Revelations 22, it exists in the garden
[30:14] because iniquity was first acquired by
[30:16] Lucifer in heaven.
[30:20] This is how brother Brandham places it
[30:22] in the sermon perfection. He said, "This
[30:23] great chain of perfection was broken by
[30:26] time space."
[30:28] Brother Brandham was using the phrase
[30:29] and the terminology before Stephen
[30:31] Hawkings. So I just believe that Stephen
[30:32] Hawkings plagiarized brother Brandham.
[30:36] &gt;&gt; That's where I'm going to leave it. We
[30:38] should have a, you know, don't believe a
[30:40] Stephen Hawking website. This great
[30:42] chain of perfection was broken by time
[30:44] space. Time came because of sin. Let's
[30:48] draw a picture of time. And I know most
[30:49] of you are probably familiar with this.
[30:50] It's talking about this chain of pro
[30:52] perfection. If you want to use a figure
[30:53] eight, the sign for eternity. It's this
[30:55] unbroken circle. It's just always the
[30:57] same. He says, but let's draw a perfect
[31:01] circle forever and ever then all at
[31:02] once. Sin dropped in. And he says, "Put
[31:05] a little hickey or a little drop in the
[31:07] chain." So it comes down now. So you
[31:09] have your circle and then something
[31:11] breaks off of it. And he says, "Eternity
[31:15] continues on, but now that it kind of
[31:17] has this appendage or this breakoff
[31:19] point called time, he says it's not in a
[31:22] perfect condition." He calls it a gap.
[31:24] There's a little gap that comes down,
[31:25] breaks over this way, goes out this way.
[31:29] Now that's that to me that just adds
[31:31] this other dimension to it. At one time
[31:33] all you have is eternity,
[31:34] &gt;&gt; right?
[31:35] &gt;&gt; And now all of a sudden as eternity
[31:37] continues, something just kind of breaks
[31:38] off,
[31:39] &gt;&gt; right?
[31:39] &gt;&gt; Like what do we do with this? I we might
[31:42] as we grow old we might get skin tags.
[31:44] It's like forever just was contin of a
[31:45] sudden something came. What do we do
[31:47] with this? This doesn't fit. It says God
[31:50] had to do that because Satan caused it.
[31:53] &gt;&gt; When did he have to do that?
[31:55] Think think about this.
[31:58] when God I I guess I don't even think
[32:01] I'm getting no I'm not getting to it
[32:02] tonight.
[32:05] God told him the day you eat there of
[32:06] that day you die
[32:09] &gt;&gt; there and and there had to be there's
[32:12] day and night there's intervals there's
[32:14] concepts of life and death a tree of
[32:17] life and a tree of knowledge of good and
[32:19] evil. So when this moment where God has
[32:22] to do that because Satan caused it, he
[32:25] says, "And it dropped down to a space of
[32:26] time for the trying and the perfecting
[32:29] and for the purging of the lost that God
[32:31] by his sovereign grace might someday
[32:33] lift that little hickey or gap back into
[32:36] the perfect circle.
[32:38] So time begins because of sin,
[32:42] &gt;&gt; right?
[32:43] &gt;&gt; Time begins because of sin. If you want
[32:44] to understand maybe a parallel to that,
[32:46] the church ages begin because of a
[32:48] falling away.
[32:50] the entire gentile church age is the
[32:52] consequence of a falling away. So, as
[32:55] long as you're in church age mentality,
[32:57] you're fallen.
[33:00] You're you're subject to cycles of
[33:01] revival and death.
[33:04] And so, as soon as time, this time, this
[33:06] concept of time, if I could say, drawing
[33:09] from what brother Brandham's teaching is
[33:11] that time is the result of sin. And God
[33:13] is using time in order to deal with evil
[33:16] &gt;&gt; to deal with the devil and all his
[33:17] angels and to eradicate once and for all
[33:20] purge evil.
[33:25] &gt;&gt; So that's why we have
[33:28] if I can say this is why you have in the
[33:31] garden of Eden the tree of knowledge of
[33:33] good and evil. That's why you have
[33:34] intervals of day. That's why you have
[33:37] this a lot of elements that we hold so
[33:39] dear to our current existence existed
[33:41] then. and say, "How do we get there in
[33:43] this place where one small step becomes
[33:45] this falling point for all of humanity
[33:47] and mankind?" God had to deal with sin,
[33:51] put man upon the basis that he would
[33:53] choose.
[33:55] Things have unfolded from then. But this
[33:57] tree of knowledge of good and evil is in
[33:58] the garden because iniquity begin in
[34:00] heaven. And now time becomes this place
[34:02] where God wants to deal with evil. Jesus
[34:05] uses the parable this way. Matthew
[34:07] chapter 13 read a few verses 24- 26 and
[34:11] then skip to verses 36 to 40 says and
[34:14] another parable put he forth unto them
[34:16] saying the kingdom of heaven is likened
[34:17] unto a man which sowed good seed in his
[34:20] field but while men slept his enemy came
[34:23] and sowed tears among the wheat and went
[34:27] his way. Now using this in symbolic form
[34:29] as a parable, he's wanting to teach a
[34:31] concept. But we can we can see that
[34:33] there's a lot in this that there's a
[34:36] sewing of good seed. And when God
[34:38] created the heavens and the earth, all
[34:40] seed was there by the spoken word. And
[34:43] each seed was to bring forth of its
[34:44] kind. And he saw that it was good. Each
[34:46] species, each genus, each one after its
[34:49] own kind. He says, "This is good."
[34:52] But while he slept and when God took his
[34:54] rest on that seventh day, it's in that
[34:56] time that Satan does what? He takes the
[34:59] seeds and he mingles them.
[35:01] &gt;&gt; And in doing so, it changes the original
[35:03] order.
[35:05] So while men slept, his enemy came and
[35:07] swed tears among the wheat and went his
[35:09] way. But when he the blade was sprung up
[35:11] and brought forth fruit, then appeared
[35:13] the tears also. So now it's not just
[35:16] producing the original, it's producing
[35:18] something else. So now they desire to
[35:21] know the meaning of this parable and
[35:22] they say Jesus sent the multitude away
[35:25] and went into the house and his
[35:26] disciples came and says declare unto
[35:27] this the parable of the tears of the
[35:29] field.
[35:31] This wouldn't be uh completely unknown
[35:34] to them in the sense that when Jesus
[35:36] said you're of their father the devil
[35:39] what do they say? we be not born of
[35:40] fornication.
[35:41] &gt;&gt; Right?
[35:42] &gt;&gt; They had this idea that the genesis of
[35:44] evil began in the garden,
[35:47] &gt;&gt; right?
[35:48] &gt;&gt; That they were there was the wicked one
[35:50] of whom the children of the earth, the
[35:51] Gentiles, they were the wicked ones, but
[35:53] they believed that they were the
[35:55] righteous nation by natural birth. And
[35:57] so it says, "Well, tell us more about
[35:59] the tears of the field." And he answered
[36:00] and said, "He that sweth the good seed
[36:02] is the son of man." So there's good
[36:05] seed. And we say if there's good seed,
[36:08] then there's bad seed.
[36:09] &gt;&gt; Right?
[36:10] &gt;&gt; Monsanto is not mentioned at all here.
[36:12] But the field is the world. The good
[36:14] seed are the children of the kingdom,
[36:16] but the tears are the children of the
[36:17] wicked one. I know that kind of drives
[36:19] us to this razor razor's edge where
[36:21] we're the good kids and everyone else is
[36:23] the bad kids, right?
[36:25] All the other kids, well, with the
[36:27] pumped up kicks, right? They're the bad
[36:29] ones. They're the bad ones. They're the
[36:31] evil ones. And we're the good ones.
[36:34] We're the ones that are are the holy.
[36:36] We're the ones that are righteous. Now,
[36:38] we're all in that same boat. There's
[36:40] children of the kingdom of God, and they
[36:44] are born of incorruptible seed, which
[36:46] liveth and abideth forever. And the
[36:48] tears are the fruits of the wicked one.
[36:53] &gt;&gt; We don't even need to just drill it down
[36:54] to this idea that we're all by natural
[36:56] birth going to decide, you're going to,
[36:57] you know, there's some sort of DNA test
[36:59] to determine whether or not you're a
[37:00] child of God or a child of the devil.
[37:02] But these are the fruits of the wicked
[37:04] one. Wherein is righteousness? Wherein
[37:07] is your relationship to God? It's
[37:08] through Jesus Christ by a new birth.
[37:11] That's why I said there's none good but
[37:12] God. So here it's not just trying to
[37:15] base it in genealogy, but where the the
[37:18] good things are sed by God because every
[37:20] good and perfect gift cometh down from
[37:21] the father of lights, you being a child
[37:24] of God. But now they have the fruits of
[37:26] the wicked one. He says the enemy that
[37:28] swed them is the devil. The harvest is
[37:31] the end of the world and the reapers are
[37:32] the angels. As therefore the tears are
[37:34] gathered and burned in the fire, so
[37:36] shall it be in the end of this world.
[37:41] There's your resolution.
[37:43] Evil is gathered together. But notice
[37:46] the reason why we have evil is because
[37:50] of what Satan swed in the beginning. Now
[37:52] he he can't sow good. He can only
[37:55] pervert evil good to evil.
[37:58] He could always he can only do something
[38:00] to what God originally formed by adding
[38:02] to or taking away and changing the
[38:04] concept context of it in order to bring
[38:06] forth evil. So it is the devil that has
[38:10] swed evil seed.
[38:14] So in this life it's inescapable
[38:17] inescapable.
[38:19] There's going to be evil and there's
[38:21] going to be good in whatever forms it
[38:23] may be.
[38:26] In Matthew 7 15 to20 he says beware of
[38:29] false prophets which come to you in
[38:30] sheep's clothing but inwardly they are
[38:33] raven and wolves. Ye shall know them by
[38:36] their fruits. This is the real teaching
[38:39] point. Do men gather grapes of thorns or
[38:43] figs of thistles? You know a tree by its
[38:47] characteristics.
[38:49] &gt;&gt; Does the does the grape vine have the
[38:51] thorns? Does the fig have the thistles?
[38:54] Are are you gathering uh think of the
[38:56] the fruits of the tree and their their
[38:59] availability and their readiness and are
[39:01] they do you gather grapes with in a
[39:03] thorny tree? Are you gathering figs in a
[39:05] a tree full of thistles? He says even so
[39:08] every good tree bringeth forth good
[39:10] fruit. But a corrupt tree bringeth forth
[39:13] evil fruit.
[39:16] So the tree of uh life brings up forth
[39:18] only good fruit.
[39:20] God can only bring forth good fruit. But
[39:22] once a tree is corrupted, it brings
[39:25] forth evil fruit. A good tree cannot
[39:28] bring forth evil fruit, neither can a
[39:30] corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. You
[39:32] have a tree of good, you have a tree of
[39:34] good and evil.
[39:38] Every tree that bringeth not forth good
[39:40] fruit is heuned down and cast into the
[39:42] fire. So here's your going back to say
[39:46] going back, but go forward to Matthew
[39:48] chapter 13. The tears are gathered
[39:50] together and burned in the fire. the
[39:52] fruit of the bad seed. The fruit of the
[39:54] seed sown by the devil is burned in the
[39:56] fire. So that tree which bringeth forth
[39:59] fruit that is not good is cut down and
[40:02] cast in the fire. Wherefore by their
[40:04] fruits ye shall know them.
[40:06] A primary objective in looking at
[40:08] Matthew chapter 13 and Matthew chapter 7
[40:10] is just to see good and evil.
[40:13] There's good seed and there's bad seed.
[40:15] There's good and there evil. A tree is
[40:18] known by its fruit. It's the fruits that
[40:19] speak of whether or not the life is pure
[40:21] and whether or not it's good. I was
[40:23] going to go to James, the book of James,
[40:24] where it speaks of how can a fountain
[40:26] give forth sweet water and bitter water
[40:28] together. It can't.
[40:31] And he and he's kind of chastising them
[40:32] in terms of how can you use a mouth to
[40:34] bless God but with the same mouth pour
[40:36] out cursings. And he's saying you don't
[40:38] get these contrasting things from the
[40:40] same pure source.
[40:42] &gt;&gt; There's got to be something mixed in,
[40:44] something that contaminated it. Amen.
[40:46] &gt;&gt; So there is in life good and evil,
[40:51] &gt;&gt; right?
[40:52] &gt;&gt; Have we not experienced good? And when
[40:55] we do, who do we thank for it? God.
[40:58] &gt;&gt; Have we also experienced evil?
[41:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, we experienced it. It's very real.
[41:04] And being born again and following
[41:06] Christ has not just changed the world to
[41:09] where now everything is just perfect.
[41:11] &gt;&gt; No matter what happens, we can just say,
[41:13] "Man, isn't that good? Isn't that nice?
[41:15] That feels good. There's still hurts.
[41:16] There's pains. There's rejection.
[41:18] There's still evil in all its various
[41:20] forms.
[41:21] If you could turn to Ecclesiastes
[41:23] chapter 3 and have been reading a lot
[41:24] about how Solomon looked at life, what
[41:26] was his conclusion? Vexations.
[41:28] &gt;&gt; Vanity. Vexation. Over and over again.
[41:30] This is his conclusion.
[41:32] It's quite uh concerning for those of us
[41:35] who don't have the same wisdom nor the
[41:37] same wealth
[41:39] that he had because he tried to resolve
[41:41] it through entertainment. He tried to
[41:43] resolve it through good food. He tried
[41:44] to resolve it through these pursuits and
[41:46] passions and through through all sorts
[41:47] of ways like through his wisdom and
[41:49] through the flesh and so figured that if
[41:51] I maybe I could unlock this key and then
[41:54] I'll find that it's not vanity anymore.
[41:56] But then he even realized no matter how
[41:57] much wealth I accumulate it, I'm going
[41:59] to die one day because death now forms
[42:01] this huge problem and who's going to
[42:02] have it after me? So what good did it do
[42:04] me? He was no matter how much wisdom I
[42:06] had, I couldn't figure this one out. And
[42:08] so as he wrestles with it, one of the
[42:10] most important passages in this, I think
[42:12] maybe one of the most familiar, but I
[42:14] think also misunderstood is Ecclesiastes
[42:17] chapter 3:es 1 to8.
[42:21] To everything there is a season and a
[42:23] time to every purpose under the heaven.
[42:27] We recognize this. This is there's a
[42:29] time for every one of these. As the the
[42:32] the the poet said, you know, there's a
[42:34] turning, right? Turn turn to everything.
[42:36] There's a season, a time to every
[42:37] purpose under heaven. A time to now
[42:39] think. A time to be born and a time to
[42:41] die. A time to plant and a time to pluck
[42:45] up that which is planted. A time to kill
[42:47] and a time to heal. Not notice this this
[42:50] pattern. Consonant dissonance.
[42:54] One's good being born good dying bad.
[42:57] Plant good. Now you're plucking up what
[43:00] I just planted. That's like the ending
[43:02] of life. But you see this interval. Time
[43:04] to break down and a time to build up. A
[43:05] time to weep and a time to laugh. A time
[43:07] to mourn, a time to dance. These are
[43:08] these contrastings. A time to cast away
[43:10] stones. A time to gather stones
[43:12] together. A time to embrace and a time
[43:14] to refrain from embracing. A time to
[43:16] get, a time to loose, a time to keep and
[43:20] a time to cast away. A time to rend and
[43:22] a time to sew.
[43:24] You rip, but yet then you mend. A time
[43:26] to keep silence and a time to speak. A
[43:28] time to love and a time to hate. Now we
[43:31] begin to read this as excuses, right?
[43:33] Oh, guess what time it is?
[43:36] time to hate, a time of war, and a time
[43:38] of peace.
[43:40] As you read this, you see that this
[43:42] alternate cycle of a time to plant, but
[43:46] then there comes a time when that which
[43:48] is planted is plucked up. So, it's
[43:50] seasons and times, these intervals even
[43:53] in this, not every single instance can
[43:55] necessarily be cast this way, but this
[43:57] these intervals of good and evil. And
[44:00] the time here doesn't necessarily mean
[44:03] that we got to be watching the calendar
[44:04] because we want to know whether or not
[44:06] Tuesday is a crying day or a laughing
[44:09] day,
[44:10] but rather it just means that time here
[44:12] means an experience
[44:14] &gt;&gt; or the occurrence
[44:16] &gt;&gt; or the occasion. Therefore, we don't we
[44:18] don't have this idea in our minds, I've
[44:20] loved, but guess what? Now it's time to
[44:22] just flat out hate
[44:23] &gt;&gt; and it's a time to God's appointed a
[44:26] time. No, it just means there's times of
[44:28] joy.
[44:29] There's times of love and a time of
[44:31] hate. There's times of life and a time
[44:32] of death. It's the very idea here, the
[44:35] time to kill, right? And all the
[44:37] assassins are kind of like, hey, it's my
[44:38] time. But it says a time to kill. It
[44:41] means there it's a time to die by
[44:42] violence or to succumb to illness.
[44:45] &gt;&gt; In other words,
[44:47] I almost say death is never really
[44:48] timely.
[44:50] &gt;&gt; Someone say, "Oh, my my uncle dies."
[44:52] Like, was was it timely?
[44:54] Hey, I mean, maybe we use the phrase a
[44:56] timely demise, but really, no matter how
[44:58] you look at it, it's like, you know,
[45:00] they knew they were dying for like 12
[45:01] years and you're thinking, "Oh, isn't
[45:02] that good?" And you're thinking, "No,
[45:04] no, that's horrible." Or they just went
[45:07] in an instance, they didn't suffer at
[45:09] all. Listen, there's not a way, I'm just
[45:11] going to say, there's not a way to look
[45:12] at death from here and say, "Wasn't that
[45:15] good?"
[45:20] &gt;&gt; So, there's a time to kill. That just
[45:21] means that it doesn't mean that we now
[45:23] have this justification that well
[45:24] sometimes it's okay to kill but it means
[45:27] there's a time to die
[45:29] but then a time to heal. So there's
[45:31] times and occasions where someone dies
[45:34] due to violence but then there's times
[45:35] when someone who has suffered violence
[45:37] heals.
[45:39] These are just occurrences. These are
[45:40] just experiences or occasions.
[45:44] There's times when we're happy. There's
[45:46] times when we're sad. There's moments
[45:48] and occasions. This is life. To
[45:50] everything there's a season and a time
[45:52] to every purpose under the heaven. So
[45:54] life has this appointment
[45:57] appointed cycle of seasons and changes.
[46:00] Seasons of this, seasons of that.
[46:03] Ecclesiastes chapter 1:es 1:7 Solomon
[46:06] has already observed this in nature. The
[46:08] words of the preacher, the son of David,
[46:09] king of Jerusalem. Vanity of vanity,
[46:11] sayeth the preacher. Vanity of vanities,
[46:13] all is vanity.
[46:15] What profitth have a man of all his
[46:17] labor which he taketh under the sun?
[46:19] What a great question. One generation
[46:22] passeth and another generation cometh,
[46:24] but the earth abideth forever. So what
[46:26] is this? Humanity comes and goes, but
[46:28] now you have this ever abiding earth.
[46:30] But now he makes this observation. The
[46:32] sun rises and the sun goes down and
[46:35] haste to the place where he arose. He
[46:37] goes in a cycle. The wind goth toward
[46:39] the south and turneth about unto the
[46:40] north. It whirleth about continually and
[46:43] the wind returneth again according to
[46:45] his circuits. That's why some say that
[46:47] when we drink water, we're drinking
[46:48] billions of years old water because it
[46:50] just it's just part of the cycle. All
[46:52] the rivers run to the sea yet the sea is
[46:54] not full under the place from whence the
[46:56] rivers come. Fiv return again. He's
[46:59] observing everything's going in these
[47:01] cycles.
[47:03] everything even in nature there's this
[47:06] way that there's these cycles these
[47:07] waves these circuits these ever
[47:10] repeating patterns
[47:12] it's in nature man dies he's not seen
[47:15] from again the next gen generation comes
[47:17] it kind of passes
[47:20] that's what the the the the reality even
[47:22] of death is you know when some people
[47:24] say well losing their parents
[47:26] is such a a difficult thing because now
[47:28] they realize they're next
[47:30] &gt;&gt; right they're kind of your your parents
[47:32] kind of form this bull work like they're
[47:34] the generation that's aging but then
[47:36] when they pass away it's like I I'm the
[47:37] one that's now up to bat I'm the one
[47:39] that could suffer suffer this next and
[47:42] there's these cycles and he says so
[47:43] everything there's a time for this
[47:44] there's a time for that vanity of
[47:46] vanities and he says but then I even re
[47:48] look at the earth that seems to always
[47:50] abide and exist despite who's living
[47:52] upon it but itself has cycles
[47:57] &gt;&gt; so if everything's vanity
[47:59] and though we there's a time to be born
[48:01] and we live out our lives And we know
[48:02] that it's just a march to the graveyard
[48:04] and we all die. Then what are we to do?
[48:07] How do we cope with this?
[48:11] I maybe even say this, how do we stay
[48:12] good?
[48:14] Because if there truly is no
[48:18] if there is no ultimate reality of
[48:21] eternal life,
[48:23] do that. So what some people say that
[48:25] eternal life in and God it was a
[48:28] construct in order to uh moderate
[48:30] behavior.
[48:32] You ever heard that before?
[48:34] Ever heard that before?
[48:36] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; I mean, this is one of the tenants of
[48:37] some a philosophy. In order for man to
[48:40] moderate behavior and to give purpose to
[48:41] life, they had to invent an afterlife,
[48:43] &gt;&gt; right?
[48:44] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, you just live and you die.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; And so, if you only have this idea that
[48:47] one day you're going to live, I think
[48:49] we've already talked about it in our
[48:50] services here, how that if that it it's
[48:52] in the reality of the life beyond this,
[48:54] if there's no reality of consequence
[48:56] beyond this, then just live life to the
[48:58] fullest.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; What? Minimize pain, maximize pleasure.
[49:03] &gt;&gt; The nihilism of, hey, this is what I got
[49:05] to do with life. And there's really no
[49:06] evil except you trying to prevent my
[49:08] will to power to enjoy everything that I
[49:12] can enjoy. And because I want to get the
[49:13] most out of life and make myself happy,
[49:15] then I'm going to rise above all of your
[49:18] attempts to deprive me of what I call
[49:20] pleasure.
[49:24] There really is no good except your own
[49:29] if we don't recognize the conclusion of
[49:31] all this. When I say your own good, your
[49:33] own pleasure. Ecclesiastes 12 13 and 14.
[49:39] He has he has scoured the world. He's
[49:42] tried everything. He's ranted for 11
[49:44] chapters and he says, "Let us hear the
[49:46] conclusion of the whole matter.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; He figured it out. Fear God and keep his
[49:50] commandments.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; For for this is this is what's right for
[49:54] man.
[49:56] This is his purpose.
[49:58] That's the whole duty of man. What what
[50:00] binds them together? What upholds him?
[50:02] What gives him purpose and meaning? And
[50:03] and he doesn't just say it merely as
[50:05] this emptiness. But then he even brings
[50:07] in delight. For God shall bring every
[50:08] work into judgment with every secret
[50:10] thing whether it be good or whether it
[50:12] be evil.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; Let us hear the conclusion of the
[50:15] matter. He says, "Fear God and keep his
[50:18] commandments." So when Solomon has
[50:20] looked at everything and it said
[50:21] everything's vanity, the only thing that
[50:23] resolved these continual cycles was this
[50:26] reality that I to fear God to keep his
[50:29] commandments because God's going to
[50:31] judge good and evil.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; So he says we ought to fear God and do
[50:38] good.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; In this life that we live, there's evil
[50:44] all around us. is an atmosphere of evil.
[50:47] And he concludes, "Fear God and do
[50:50] good."
[50:52] I believe this would be a good principle
[50:53] to express to anyone. Fear God and do
[50:57] good.
[50:59] Let me just try to reach a conclusion
[51:01] here through several scriptures that
[51:02] we'd like to share with you. I think
[51:04] they all just kind of connect together.
[51:05] But in Psalms 34:es
[51:08] 11, 12, 13, and 14 says, "Come ye
[51:11] children, hearken unto me. I will teach
[51:13] you the fear of the Lord.
[51:16] That's the beginning of wisdom.
[51:19] This is this is this is where we begin
[51:21] to perceive and have the right
[51:23] perception and discernment of right and
[51:26] wrong. What man is he? Good question.
[51:29] What man is he that desire desireth life
[51:32] and loveth many days that he may see
[51:34] good? What man is that? Wouldn't every
[51:38] man say, "Well, I I want life. I want to
[51:40] live a long time. I want to seek good
[51:43] but what's your construct?
[51:46] He says keep thy tongue from evil, thy
[51:49] lips from speaking guile.
[51:52] Depart from evil and do good. Seek peace
[51:54] and pursue it.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; This is the whole duty of man. Fear God.
[52:00] Depart from evil. Do good. Seek peace.
[52:05] Pursue it. This is this is principles of
[52:08] good living.
[52:10] This is a good way to just ask yourself
[52:11] every day, am I departing from evil? Am
[52:14] I doing good? Am I seeking peace? Am I
[52:18] pursuing peace? Listen, young people,
[52:20] and uh your your relationships with your
[52:22] siblings, those siblings, right? Those
[52:24] little sisters, like how do we deal with
[52:26] them? Seek peace.
[52:29] How what what's going to promote peace?
[52:32] Not not the division. Because notice,
[52:34] begin to examine your your base
[52:36] instincts and your selfish nature that
[52:39] often times when we find ourselves
[52:40] really upset about something. It's when
[52:43] we feel that we are being deprived.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; When my pleasure is not maximized, when
[52:48] they get away with it and I never do,
[52:51] &gt;&gt; when there's some some benefit to
[52:53] someone else and you feel like it's
[52:54] being withheld from you and therefore
[52:56] you want to object. It says, "If I don't
[52:58] get mine, I don't want anybody else to
[53:00] get theirs."
[53:01] And therefore you want to upset the the
[53:03] balance. You want to upset the peace.
[53:05] But he's saying depart from evil and do
[53:06] good. Seek peace and pursue it.
[53:09] In order to pursue good, you have to
[53:11] discern good.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; You have to discern between good and
[53:14] evil. Look for good. Do good. And when
[53:17] you see evil, avoid it.
[53:20] Says in Psalms 37:27, "Depart from evil
[53:23] and do good and dwell forever more."
[53:27] These are the principles of life.
[53:30] In order to depart from evil, there has
[53:32] to be an existence of it.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; There's some that argue that after niche
[53:37] that there is no absolute evil. There's
[53:39] no objective evil. There's no evil that
[53:41] actually exists. We all just have our
[53:43] different varying definitions of it. But
[53:45] when we do that, we completely erase
[53:47] legitimate of scripture.
[53:50] And this becomes just kind of well that
[53:51] for I mean, if you're a Jew, right? If
[53:54] you're a Jew and you want to listen to
[53:56] one of your former kings or one of his
[53:58] songwriters
[54:00] in his songwriting conference said,
[54:02] "Depart from evil and do good." And they
[54:05] just say, "Well, that just depends on
[54:07] some context." No, the Bible saying,
[54:08] "Depart from evil and do good and dwell
[54:10] forever more."
[54:12] God chastising uh Israel in Jeremiah
[54:16] 4:22, "For my people are foolish," is
[54:18] foolish. They have not known me. They
[54:21] are Scottish people. I remember reading
[54:23] it one time saying Scottish and I was
[54:24] like I knew there was something wrong
[54:25] with the Scottish. Ireland forever says
[54:28] they are soughtest children and they
[54:30] have done un they have none
[54:32] understanding. They are wise to do evil.
[54:35] Isn't that a weird saying? Wise to do
[54:37] evil but to do good they have no
[54:38] knowledge.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; An amazing saying.
[54:42] They're keen on evil. They can figure
[54:43] that out. But that to do good they have
[54:46] no knowledge.
[54:48] In some ways, I feel like Paul is
[54:49] amplifying this to say that man, I'm
[54:51] wise to do evil. I want to do good, but
[54:54] it seems I don't have the knowledge or
[54:55] the wherewithal in me to do good.
[54:58] We say, "Yeah, this is the present state
[55:00] of the believer or the the fallen man.
[55:03] We can we we we we can be our ingenuity
[55:06] is to evil,
[55:08] but there's no knowledge to do good."
[55:10] But yet, he says, "Depart from evil and
[55:12] do good." That requires a wisdom, a
[55:15] perception.
[55:17] Jesus says in Luke chapter 6:35, "But
[55:19] but love ye your enemies and do good and
[55:23] lend hoping for nothing again." There's
[55:25] a lot a lot a lot of here lot here that
[55:28] you could get into dig into that you
[55:30] could look at these principles. Do good
[55:32] lend hoping for nothing again. And your
[55:34] reward shall be great. Love your enemies
[55:37] and do good.
[55:40] And ye shall be the children of the
[55:41] highest.
[55:43] You're going to be the children of God
[55:45] if you can do this. Love your enemies
[55:47] and do good. Speaks to some selfishness.
[55:49] You're lending this genuiness to you
[55:52] where it's not contrived. It's not
[55:53] selfish. It's not for your own benefit
[55:56] that you do it as under the Lord. You're
[55:57] going, you're willing to help, not
[55:58] because I, hey, I'm just kind of
[56:00] investing in a future kickback here, but
[56:03] you're willing to love your enemies and
[56:04] do good. And you shall be the children
[56:06] of God, the children of the highest. For
[56:08] he is kind unto the unthankful and to
[56:13] the evil.
[56:15] What's the first thing we say when
[56:16] somebody says they're sorry? No, you're
[56:18] not. Right? No matter who it is, right?
[56:21] I'm sorry. No, you're not. If you're
[56:23] sorry, you'd have never done it. You are
[56:25] sorry. You're the sorryest one I've ever
[56:26] met. Right? I mean, it's like, whoa.
[56:29] Okay. Well, all right. Looks like
[56:31] there's two selfish people here having
[56:33] this conversation. And there this we are
[56:36] to do good. God is kind to the
[56:38] unthankful and to the evil. Isn't there
[56:41] times you do something and the very fact
[56:43] that they don't show gratitude begins to
[56:44] grate you a little bit? Like, well, if
[56:46] they're not going to be grateful, you
[56:48] know, if they're not going to be
[56:48] thankful, if they're not going to be
[56:49] happy. I saw a license plate on the way
[56:51] to church today. It said grateful. I
[56:53] thought of Marawn Lynch, but he said
[56:55] thank was his word was thankful.
[56:59] There's
[57:01] ways that that it works against our base
[57:03] instinct in our nation. Why? Because
[57:04] we're selfish. But he says God's kind to
[57:06] those who aren't even grateful and to
[57:08] the evil.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; And we're to depart from evil and to do
[57:11] good. 1 Peter chapter 3:es 8 to 12. Go
[57:15] ahead musicians if you want to take your
[57:16] place. Says, "Finally, be ye all of one
[57:18] mind, having compassion one of another.
[57:20] Love as brethren, be pit pitiful."
[57:23] Really need to know what that means
[57:24] because a lot of us would say, "I'm
[57:25] there." Be pitiful. Be courteous. Be
[57:27] merciful. Have compassion even as
[57:29] another rendering, I guess. Not
[57:31] rendering for evil for evil or railing
[57:34] for railing. Oh, this is high standards,
[57:36] &gt;&gt; but contraries blessing, knowing that
[57:38] you are there unto called that you
[57:40] should inherit a blessing.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; For he that will love life.
[57:46] Sunday, I want to pick up on this love
[57:48] of life, he that will love life, what's
[57:51] he quoting from? Who is it that desires
[57:54] life and loves life with loves many days
[57:56] that he may see good? He that will love
[57:58] life and see good days. It's quoting
[58:00] from Psalm 34. Now let him refrain his
[58:02] tongue from evil and his lips that they
[58:04] speak no guile. Let him assue evil,
[58:07] depart from evil, and do good. Let him
[58:10] seek peace and ensue it.
[58:14] For the eyes of the Lord are over the
[58:16] righteous, and his ears are open unto
[58:19] their prayers, but the face of the Lord
[58:21] is against them that do evil.
[58:26] This is life.
[58:29] Life is full of good. It's full of evil.
[58:32] If we experience enough evil, we might
[58:33] just accept it as our lot in life and
[58:35] say, "Well, I'm going to go down this
[58:36] evil way." Don't ever be weary and
[58:37] welloing. Don't let your compounded
[58:40] misery and your losses and your failings
[58:42] and all the things that begin to
[58:43] accumulate to put you in this shadow of
[58:46] evil, but realize there's evil. It's
[58:48] going to exist. It's going to breathe
[58:49] around us. We're going to suffer abuses.
[58:51] We're going to have traumas. We're going
[58:52] to have losses. We're going to have
[58:53] heartaches. We're going to have death.
[58:54] There's going to be divorce. There's
[58:55] going to be a lot of things that
[58:56] believers and child children of God
[58:58] experience. things that are shameful,
[59:00] things that are reproach. A lot of
[59:02] things happen, but pursue good.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; Depart from evil and do good. Even says
[59:10] of that virtuous woman in Proverbs 31
[59:12] that she'll do him good and not evil all
[59:15] the days of her life. That's what she
[59:17] wants to do. She wants to do good.
[59:20] Doesn't want to do evil.
[59:23] So, Proverbs 14:22 concludes. I say
[59:26] concludes, but I think this this is
[59:28] where I'll end. Do they not heir that
[59:30] devise evil?
[59:32] [Music]
[59:33] But mercy and truth shall be to them
[59:35] that devise good.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; There's Christ. To those that desire
[59:40] good, that seek good,
[59:43] that want to work good, mercy and truth,
[59:48] to those that devise good.
[59:53] If there was an absence of evil and we
[59:55] just said, "Well, everything's good."
[59:57] But then to each his own, right?
[1:00:01] Yeah. Whatever whatever feels good,
[1:00:03] whatever you desire, however you want to
[1:00:04] identify, there's no
[1:00:08] there's really no evil per se. It's just
[1:00:11] what we might want to call evil. But if
[1:00:13] you think it's good, then who am I to
[1:00:15] tell you that your good is evil?
[1:00:17] No,
[1:00:19] that's not it.
[1:00:21] There is good and evil. And maybe as
[1:00:24] Christians, we don't need, you know, a
[1:00:26] lot of teaching and several part series
[1:00:27] on the fact that there's evil and the
[1:00:29] fact that there's good. But maybe it is
[1:00:31] good for us to pause and realize that
[1:00:33] when God says he's going to work all
[1:00:34] things together for good, it doesn't
[1:00:37] mean we have to look at evil and say it
[1:00:39] is good.
[1:00:41] Call it what it is. It hurts. Stinks.
[1:00:44] It's horrible. It's awful. Still hurts.
[1:00:46] Even though sometimes it's years past,
[1:00:50] still causes a scar. It still has a
[1:00:52] shadow. It still seems to have old me.
[1:00:54] Nobody, you should not be should not
[1:00:56] force yourself or let anybody force
[1:00:58] yourself to look at that and call it
[1:01:00] good. It's evil. But know that God is
[1:01:04] mindful of the evil that we experience.
[1:01:08] That God is going to resolve it and that
[1:01:10] we can't we don't have to be defined by
[1:01:12] our scars. Though we may be there may be
[1:01:15] this necessity of weakness. There may be
[1:01:17] this requirement in our lives that we
[1:01:18] suffer certain things. But God is able
[1:01:21] to produce rest and glory with that
[1:01:23] whatever material we have to work with.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; And some of us have been raised in
[1:01:28] really really awesome circumstances and
[1:01:30] situations to hear truth, be raised the
[1:01:32] right right way. But yet through our own
[1:01:34] rebellion and through our own
[1:01:35] experiences, we find ourselves venturing
[1:01:36] into paths where we heap upon ourselves
[1:01:38] sorrows and experiences that compound a
[1:01:41] certain depression or misery all the
[1:01:42] days of our lives. But even when it has
[1:01:44] been our own stubbornness, God says that
[1:01:47] can't hinder good
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; because I'll ultimately bring you to
[1:01:52] rest, the expected end. Oh, but my
[1:01:55] journey has been this. My journey's been
[1:01:56] that, but this is where I'm going to
[1:01:58] bring you.
[1:01:59] I went the hard way. I know I you didn't
[1:02:02] have to do that, but this is where I'm
[1:02:03] going to bring you. And when you can
[1:02:05] love God, fear God, and keep his
[1:02:08] commandments, when you are those that
[1:02:10] love God and called the loved of God,
[1:02:13] have a there's a purpose that God has
[1:02:15] for you,
[1:02:17] then no matter what the circumstance
[1:02:19] path you go on, no matter where you go
[1:02:21] and what you do, you realize in the end
[1:02:23] that none of that can ever change. No
[1:02:26] matter where you've been, none of that
[1:02:27] can ever change where God said he's
[1:02:29] going to put you.
[1:02:31] No matter where those keys wonder when
[1:02:33] and brother Mike is playing sometimes
[1:02:35] you'll hear him in a song and you hear
[1:02:36] maybe brother loyal on the bass and you
[1:02:38] hear brother Joshua on the trumpet or
[1:02:39] playing the guitar and you hear what you
[1:02:41] seems to be the melody and all of a
[1:02:42] sudden he's going on a run
[1:02:45] and you hear the keys
[1:02:47] it's going no matter where it goes it's
[1:02:49] going to come right back to the rest
[1:02:52] going to resolve on Christ and he's
[1:02:54] promised it. So I express I'm expressing
[1:02:57] this concept of good and evil because I
[1:02:59] believe that we need to expose evil for
[1:03:02] what it is, not water it down. Nor do I
[1:03:05] want there to be anybody who feels left
[1:03:08] out because their lives don't fit that
[1:03:13] message cookie cutter that we think
[1:03:15] everybody else is living, right? Don't
[1:03:17] we look at everybody else and go, "Man,
[1:03:19] that's family's got it all together.
[1:03:21] Beautiful family, right? beautiful
[1:03:24] fabric, wonderful fit, everything just
[1:03:26] perfectly set in order. But then you
[1:03:28] don't know the whole story, right?
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; And you know in your story, don't think
[1:03:32] for a moment that God's given up on you
[1:03:35] just because you've suffered.
[1:03:38] He'll use it all for his glory and for
[1:03:39] somebody else's benefit. Let's stand
[1:03:42] today together.
[1:03:44] Thank you for your attentiveness
[1:03:45] tonight.
[1:03:50] This is my
[1:03:54] desire
[1:03:58] to honor
[1:04:02] you.
[1:04:06] Lord, with all my heart
[1:04:11] I worship you.
[1:04:21] All I have within me,
[1:04:27] I give
[1:04:29] you
[1:04:31] praise.
[1:04:36] All that I adore
[1:04:40] is in you.
[1:04:50] Lord, I give you my heart.
[1:04:55] I give you my soul.
[1:05:00] I live for you alone.
[1:05:05] Every breath that I take,
[1:05:09] every moment I'm awake,
[1:05:15] have your way in me.
[1:05:20] Sing it again. This is my desire.
[1:05:26] This is my
[1:05:29] desire.
[1:05:32] Oh, to honor
[1:05:35] [Music]
[1:05:37] you,
[1:05:41] Lord, with all my heart.
[1:05:46] I worship you.
[1:05:56] All I have within me.
[1:06:01] Oh, I give
[1:06:04] you
[1:06:06] praise.
[1:06:08] Oh,
[1:06:10] all that I adore
[1:06:15] is in you.
[1:06:18] is in you.
[1:06:22] Oh
[1:06:24] Lord, I give you my heart.
[1:06:29] I give you my soul.
[1:06:34] I live for you.
[1:06:39] Every breath that I take,
[1:06:43] every moment I'm away,
[1:06:48] oh Lord, have your way.
[1:06:52] Oh Lord, I give you my heart.
[1:06:58] I give you my soul.
[1:07:03] I live for
[1:07:08] every breath.
[1:07:11] Oh, every moment I'm awake.
[1:07:17] Lord, have your way.
[1:07:22] Amen. Let's just yield to his desire.
[1:07:26] Just align our desires with his.
[1:07:31] It's a great wrestling out
[1:07:34] would God predestinate evil and why does
[1:07:37] God allow evil? I think it's something
[1:07:40] we wrestle with
[1:07:43] and humanly we'll never
[1:07:47] we'll never achieve a satisfactory
[1:07:49] answer
[1:07:50] if we're being honest intellectually or
[1:07:53] just you know honest with ourselves and
[1:07:55] our experience our thoughts
[1:07:57] [Music]
[1:08:00] but I'm glad that God's word speaks to
[1:08:02] these things speaks of them speaks of
[1:08:04] the evil yet in the midst of all of it
[1:08:06] he tells us to pursue Good
[1:08:09] guys. When the writer says, "Rejoice in
[1:08:11] the Lord," you say, "Now?
[1:08:14] Do it now."
[1:08:15] Always.
[1:08:17] Yeah. In the midst of pain.
[1:08:20] You say, "Well, it's a it's a time to
[1:08:21] die." Well, rejoice.
[1:08:25] It's it's it's almost a a rebuttal to
[1:08:27] the evil. I'm not going to bury my head
[1:08:30] in the sand and say, "No, there's no
[1:08:31] evil. Everything God allows is good. And
[1:08:33] even though it might seem evil, we're
[1:08:35] just going to call it good because it's
[1:08:36] all going to work out for good.
[1:08:39] It's maybe zeroing in on the good, the
[1:08:42] goodness and the good things, the true
[1:08:44] life, the way the eternal life, those
[1:08:46] things true.
[1:08:49] And so whatever this evil is, whatever
[1:08:50] I've experienced, I I can't figure it
[1:08:52] out. So I'm going to cast all my cares
[1:08:55] upon him. Scripture I was going to use
[1:08:57] Sundays, he said, "Come unto me all you
[1:08:59] who are burdened." Everybody's weighed
[1:09:01] down with what? past the pains of
[1:09:03] sorrows, death, weeping, all those
[1:09:05] former things we see in Revelation. What
[1:09:07] is it? Come unto me. And he said, I will
[1:09:09] give you rest.
[1:09:12] All your dissonance, come to me and I'll
[1:09:15] give you rest. And he said, ah, I rest.
[1:09:18] And he says, take my yoke. There's still
[1:09:20] a yoking. He says, my burden is easy. My
[1:09:23] yoke is light. There's still there's
[1:09:24] still going to be heaviness, still
[1:09:27] sorrow. But what is suffering testify of
[1:09:29] glory?
[1:09:31] All our pain is pregnant with glory.
[1:09:34] And so, Lord, it's going to hurt. I'm
[1:09:35] going to suffer. But I know you'll
[1:09:38] always resolve.
[1:09:40] You'll resolve it for good. Let's pray.
[1:09:42] Heavenly Father, Lord, my heart's just
[1:09:44] moved tonight and looking into these
[1:09:46] things. I feel a great burden for
[1:09:50] our loved ones here, this family of God.
[1:09:53] We've suffered much.
[1:09:56] We might look at ourselves as a a local
[1:09:58] church and there might be a lot of
[1:09:59] things say how well we haven't suffered
[1:10:00] much. We didn't go through this. We
[1:10:02] haven't gone through that. But Lord,
[1:10:03] it's not this local gathering that is
[1:10:07] the body that suffers. It's the body of
[1:10:09] Christ. When it suffers, we all suffer.
[1:10:13] But when it rejoices, we all rejoice.
[1:10:16] And Lord, I I look out upon a
[1:10:17] congregation and very few of us align
[1:10:20] perfectly with the same experiences,
[1:10:23] same testimonies,
[1:10:25] the same life choices, the same
[1:10:27] consequences.
[1:10:29] We haven't all gathered here because we
[1:10:31] made it through a vetting process and we
[1:10:32] all came out as being qualified and
[1:10:36] we're in this special class. We're a
[1:10:38] magnet school. We're a special charter
[1:10:40] school for the gifted and talented.
[1:10:42] Lord, no.
[1:10:44] No, Lord. We've all we've suffered.
[1:10:47] We still yet suffer today.
[1:10:50] We all have our unique shames and scars
[1:10:52] and bruises.
[1:10:54] Some of us are still living with the
[1:10:56] consequences of bad decisions or things
[1:10:58] beyond our control. And how do we make
[1:11:01] sense of it? I don't know that we can
[1:11:03] make sense of it except to say, "I know,
[1:11:05] Lord. I know.
[1:11:07] [Music]
[1:11:08] I know that one day I'll be at rest."
[1:11:13] So in the meantime, I pray for peace. In
[1:11:15] the meantime, Lord, I want to pursue
[1:11:17] good. I want to do that which is right.
[1:11:18] I don't want to compound it. I don't
[1:11:19] want to become bitter.
[1:11:22] I don't want to be a fountain of
[1:11:23] complaining and criticism
[1:11:26] and the victim.
[1:11:28] But Lord, I can be called to be that
[1:11:31] fountain of all things good, sweet
[1:11:34] water. I can be a fountain of grapes and
[1:11:37] figs. I can be a tree of good to my
[1:11:40] family
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; that don't believe
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; to the unbelievers in my life. I could
[1:11:45] just be that that one that doesn't look
[1:11:47] at life and say, "Oh, well, nothing's
[1:11:49] bad." But say, "Yeah, it's tough." But
[1:11:51] you know what? I love him. The Lord's
[1:11:52] good. He's promised us good. He'll bring
[1:11:55] us good and keep believing and keep
[1:11:57] serving,
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; being kind even to the ungrateful and to
[1:12:01] the evil. Because that way, Lord, we
[1:12:02] we're the children of the most high.
[1:12:04] Amen.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; I pray that you bless the people
[1:12:07] tonight, their faithfulness, their
[1:12:08] diligence.
[1:12:10] Give us the rest we need tonight. Store
[1:12:13] our bodies. Keep us safe. I pray in the
[1:12:15] name of Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
