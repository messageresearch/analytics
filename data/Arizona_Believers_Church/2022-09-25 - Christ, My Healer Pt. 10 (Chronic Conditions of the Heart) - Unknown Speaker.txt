TRANSCRIPT
========================================
this is part 10 of Christ my healer I'm going to recap a few things on the promise of wholeness that was our subtitle last time was the promise of wholeness that speaks to soundness we were kind of identifying some completeness as it related to us as a person so that there's Harmony there's a union of the parts and that was the the real emphasis of the promise of wholeness and I had uh and we emphasized a lot on one particular aspect of that but in first Thessalonians let's read the statement from rising of the sun first and the sermon rising of the sun brother Brahman said these people who are fellow citizens of the Kingdom a possessor of quickening power so you're the possessor of quickening power he says Quicken it to them Lord just now it may the spirit go from Eagle to Eagle from word to word till the fullness of Jesus Christ be manifested in each one of the bodies for physical spiritual or any need they have need of that's the idea of wholeness is its every need supplied every issue remedied everything anything that would be causing some disharming or disunity anything that would not be promoting our soundness of mind and soundness of body anything that would be interrupting Harmony that the Holy Spirit would come for physical spiritual or any need that we might have and in first Thessalonians chapter 5 verse 23 and Paul making this statement which is just so round to me and so whole and very God of Peace sanctify you holy that means to be perfect complete in all respects that means entire nothing lacking so he says if we're to be Sanctified holy I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus so there's a prayer this is a scriptural promise this is a scriptural desire that we would be whole in our soul in our minds our spirits and our bodies that we would be whole in all those three parts we recognize that brother Branham teaches it this way that there is a a there's a soul a spirit and a body that were three parts and without any one of those you're not complete and so if any one of those is sick or or out of place or or harmed then we're harmed and we're not whole so that's the idea behind wholeness is that the entire person is is touched by the power of God the entire person is healed by the power of God we saw in Isaiah 53 how the atonement spoke to the sickness of our body the sickness of our soul and the sickness of our Spirits our grief and sorrow our iniquities our physical pain by his stripes we are healed so that's what that's what the atonement covers it covers the entire person covers All That You Are and So Divine Healing is more than just healing of the physical body and that's when we think Divine Healing we think oh my body being healed and I'll even I think we recognize this from the teaching of the message that Divine Healing of the body in a temporal sense is just pointing to the ultimate Divine Healing of the change of our body but this Divine Healing we limit it so much in its application and we think oh that means if I have cancer and they do a scan and I have a tumor on a particular organ and I'm prayed for and they come back later and the tumor is gone that's Divine Healing Abraham says all healing is Divine Healing so there's layers to Divine Healing and I'm wanting us to think more about the Divine Healing of the soul and the Divine Healing of our spirit because I think that's what might hold the key even to our physical healing and as brother bam says the born-again possess quickening power we looked at how he said the greatest Miracle is the healing of a sensic soul that's the greatest Miracle to be born again and brother random identifies how that sickness and sin are so closely related that you can't deal with sin without having dealt with sickness and that's what um that's kind of what we're looking at is when the soul the sickness of the soul is dealt with that has ramifications if they use chemotherapy and certain treatments and pills and and they give you a prescription say this description is going to take care of this problem in your body but there's all sorts of side effects and they're usually not good or I'll take that back they're always bad right they never say you're going to take this pill and it's going to help with the headaches and it's also going to give you 10 20 vision right they never say that and they say can cause blurred vision don't operate heavy machinery it's always bad well with this gospel whenever you take it and it heals the soul it can come with side effects and those side effects are very positive for the spirit and the body and and so you can't deal with sin without there being some effect upon the spirit and the body I've been looking at these instances in the scripture quite a bit this I'm just going to read from Matthew chapter 9 verse 5. but in the few places that it's mentioned I think there's a couple instances where Jesus uses this phrase and then it's uh mentioned a few times in the gospels from different perspectives but he says for weather is easier Matthew chapter 9 verse 5 for what is easier to say thy sins be forgiven thee or to say arise and walk and I asked the question what what is easier to tell someone that they they're to be healed or to to heal a sickness or to tell someone that their sins are forgiven now we know that both are accomplished by the same divine power that if you if you're to say to someone your sins are forgiven now you could say it all day long your sins are forgiven but it's only God who can remit those sins it's only God or by his power that sins can be remitted so it has to be connected back to divine power so both are accomplished by the same Divine omnipotence to heal the body or to heal the soul but one is seen and the other is unseen right and in the way that Jesus is saying he's saying what is harder you know something that you can actually see and verify or something that cannot be seen if I can do that which is seen and I could do that which is easy to verify do I not also have the power to forgive sins and so it's actually I hate just to kind of brush over it very quickly but you see that connection there we're saying the Forgiveness of sins and and the healing of the body are connected to the same divine power and in John chapter 5 verse 14 as we've read it already this morning when Jesus found this man in the temple I kept wanting to come up with the name for this man in the in in the Book of John and I couldn't really come up with the name if one strikes me I'll just use it because I want to refer to him you know Lemmy or whatever we want to call them so that whenever we I don't have to keep saying the man in John chapter 5 or the sick man uh in John chapter five or keep referring to him um so if you think of a nickname just text it to me and we'll do a poll we can do a Twitter poll or something and figure out what name should we use for the man in John chapter five I call him Cinco but he says uh he says he found Jesus finds him and the temple says behold Thou Art made whole sin no more or less the worst thing come on upon you so there's this connection again to where how one can be healed but the sin of unbelief can undo that why because sin and sickness are related and where their sin their the healing loses its hold I know that's a very um uh a very large thought that brother Bama always touches on how your healing is going to last as long as your faith does now to me that's a staggering comment we're going to read one here in a moment that's very uh very staggering when you consider it and even in Romans chapter 6 verses 22 and 23 it's basically telling us that by the New Birth the power of the law of sin and death has been broken and so by the new birth our souls are uh have been made free from the penalty of sin and and the law of sin so the soul is no longer under the penalty of sin it's no longer under the effects of sin it's been made whole and you have this wholeness in your soul and that's the greatest Miracle there is and we're since I'm preaching to Believers I think it's important to approach Divine Healing not so much in a convention style to where we're just trying to accomplish a healing for the sake of healing and for and to say just to prove that God still heals but so that your your faith can mature and faith can be more available to us in every situation that we need it we're approaching the subject of Divine Healing but we're really approaching the subject of a maturing faith and walking fully in the promises of God and believing him for everything and so when we have this newness of life in our soul then really we're no longer under the penalty of sin and that's when brother Branham touches I I Associated it with these statements where brother Brown talks about how healing is already in US the power of transformation he says and a healing comes from the inside let that healing come from the spirit that's in you and he's talking about those who've been regenerated by the new birth you have eternal life inside of you you have deity inside of you let the healing come from within so think of it this way and maybe hold this thought very near you it's a change of perspective because often we're always trying to chase healing as if it's something that we're trying to find and we give it we give it certain markers on the calendar we give it certain distinctions and the healing is already right inside of you we just use this type at the very end then we talk about cancer being in remission well the Bible says our sins are in remission or our soul is in remission there's no evidence of sin there's no signs of sin you're in full complete remission never to relapse that's the permanence of the new birth and so our soul is in full remission all evidence of sin is gone if you took a blood test you took a scan you took a cancer test you did a biopsy do it whatever you want on the sole and there's going to be no markers no signs even to the point it's a perfect Soul it's never been sick to begin with is that right Dr Jesus he says absolutely how do you know I put it there I've given you a transplant it's made new it's perfectly whole and so that's the thought on the promise of wholeness now my title today and I hope this hasn't messed your notes up just write it out into the margin if you've already taken the title spot but my title today is chronic conditions of the heart chronic conditions of the heart and so what my thesis is that there's barriers to a believer's healing that are often are the barriers to a believer's healing are often in our mental approach to it that so we're Believers so the word the promise has been given and we're Believers so how is it the promise given our faith to the promise what is it in that process that often interrupts our receiving what we even believe in because I think all of us 100 even if we asked the youngest here and they could understand the question they believe in Divine Healing they believe in the Miracles they believe in signs and wonders the faith is there so what is it that caused us to miss it well it's some that that Ravel or that crust that we can't get over that keeps us from receiving our healing brother says You must know how to approach God for healing like you do with salvation so you have to have the right approach and another state statement he says if you do not approach Divine Healing right you will fail to receive your healing that's that's it you don't approach it right so you can believe in it and we and the promise can be there but if you're not coming to it from the right angle he says you won't receive your healing and many times he says and many many times people want to be so tranquilized they want this that or the other so they're looking for something they're looking for even in their approach to Divine Healing they're looking for it to come a certain way they want to be tranquilized they want this they want that even if he's talking about in a literal sense of medication or in a spiritual sense just tranquilize me God and do a Divine surgery and heal me our approach has to be right so I'm wanting to address chronic conditions that actually keep us from being healed and to use that phrase chronic conditions of the heart it's we're looking at how heart problems can cause sickness when I say heart problems I'm not talking about the physical heart but how that the mind as we are Spirit soul and body we're looking at that Spirit part that mind part the emotional part that can actually cause sickness that could be the cause of the sickness so you say God you know deliver me of this and heal this so God could come around and heal the physical symptoms but you haven't dealt with the underlying cause and as long as the underlying cause is causing the physical sickness God can do all day long keep dealing with the symptoms but really what he wants to do is deal with the underlying cause or so it could be the actual cause but it all it can also be the prevention of healing because there's something in your approach something in your attitude that's not right now you say where's the phrase chronic conditions of the heart come from I I use chronic because chronic implies something to just persist it's recurring or it's lasting a long time or something very stubborn very difficult to eradicate and as we read in John chapter 5 verse 5 it says the man had an infirmity 38 years that would be a chronic condition this impotent man this sick man had a condition for 38 years this was a chronic condition that he had lived with and Jesus even in his healing of this man looks at it from the standpoint knowing that he had been there a long time so I want us to consider The Chronic conditions of our own heart and how that God must needs heal chronic conditions in our heart perhaps before he can heal the conditions in our body all right that's the that's the foundation James chapter 5 verse 13. this will be the scripture that will almost be a bookend to our thought this morning James chapter 5 verses 13 Even 14 and 15 we know he's if if there's any sick among you he says call for the Elders of the church uh and have them anoint you with oil and the prayer of faith shall deliver or save the sick so what is it that doesn't the prayer of faith heals the sick some of the mechanics to it or if you're sick in body call for the elders to come pray for you them with faith believing anoint you with oil pray for you and it says you shall be well but now this is the first part of that whole phrase is the question is any among you afflicted let them pray is any Mary let him sing Psalms this is a precursor this is what is asked these are the questions that are asked before he says if you're sick call for the elders have them anoint you with oil and pray for you and you will get well he asked the question are any of you Afflicted and that means to suffer trouble actually translated I believe in one place to endure hardness so when Paul asked are any Afflicted he's not referring to the same sickness in verse 14 necessarily but he's talking about the afflictions of the Mind the term Afflicted means a suffering mind the suffering of mind the suffering of emotions the suffering of passions are you finding yourself without ambition are you find yourself Melancholy you find yourself discouraged or you find yourself anxious is your mind all in turmoil are you suffering from emotional or mental or spiritual turbulence or difficulty that's the question he's asking before he gets to verse 14 and says if you're sick and body call for the elders he wants to know are you Afflicted are you married and he appoints to a very important and I can say often over element before we ask for prayer for sickness in the body I believe that it's written this way for a reason I think there's some weight to it that causes us to really examine this I think there's a reason why he asked these two probing questions first to like a doctor would say well where are you here for today and they say well I have this problem he's like well let's back up and starts asking you questions and they're wanting to know more about your situation it says oh have a headache we'll just take this they want to get to the bottom of it you want to find out so James asked are you Afflicted are you married there's things he's putting into place first and if I could use this phrase it's almost as if he's using before you ask for prayer for physical sickness he's at he's applying a conditioned precedent which in contract language that means something that needs to be done first before another thing can be done it's an event or condition that's required before something else can occur so before you call to the elders and ask them to come and pray for you and anoint you with oil that the prayer of faith May deliver you from your physical sickness are you Afflicted in your mind are you Merry and he's asking these questions first like it's our attention doesn't it James is actually looking at the condition of our emotions first before we get on the phone and call the Elders over now in John chapter 5 I'm going to read verse verse 7 to 15. I may not need to read this to you again in his completeness and I want to go a little bit quicker now so let's just really look at this Jesus asked him if he wants to be made whole and verse 7 he says well I have no man to put me in the water when the pool is troubled so notice the conversation do you want to be healed well of course I do but when the water is troubled other people beat me to it and I can't quite get in it but then Jesus just speaks he just kind of interrupts i i as if he's not even really dealing with the man's question but he says Rise take up thy bed and walk verse 8 just speaks to the man and immediately the man was made whole let's think of that soundness this completeness and notice what he does took up his bed and walked and on the same day was the Sabbath that's a very important part to know if you're a Pharisee right it happened on the Sabbath the Jews therefore said unto him that was cured it is the Sabbath day and I want you to recognize this it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed he answered them so there he rebuked uh he's rebuked um maybe we can just call him John John 5 answers and he says he that made me whole the same said unto me take up thy bed and walk so he says it's not lawful for you to be care in your bed you you've you've gone too far on the Sabbath we've been counting your steps you've gone too far and he's like oh well the man that healed me you know I was sick for 38 years the man who healed me he told me to do it so I did I did it I mean that was pretty good that was good good enough for me that immediately when this man made me well I thought what do you want me to do jump okay how high right it was just I'll do it and he says they asked him what man is that that said this to you verse 12 who said do you take up thy bed and walk and he that was killed verse 13 is very important he that was healed wished not who it was he didn't know who he was he didn't say you know this rabble Rouser this problem cause her he doesn't say anything he says for Jesus had conveyed himself away a multitude being in that place afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple and said unto him behold Thou Art made whole so he was healed of this amality of 38 years he says sin no more or less the worst thing come unto thee very important principle The Man departed and told the Jews that it was Jesus which had made him whole out maybe two quick hits on that number one notice how Jesus just I think I've mentioned this before already Jesus Takes that initiative and speaks to him and he's made whole and he has no prior knowledge of who of who Jesus Is Right now to me these are two things you could think about and I don't want to spend much more time on this other than just saying it it speaks to how we don't need to know a whole lot about Christ before we can be saved or before he can be healed prior knowledge and experience and activity in church and understanding and I know all about you I know everything you've done all it takes is a moment for someone who's never known anything about Christ never known anything about the message never known anything about the things of God in a moment without any prior knowledge of experience in the intellectual side and academic side of things can be changed and it also helps us understand how that Divine Healing isn't necessarily related to having prior knowledge or a prior understanding of something I think it's important to recognize those elements now the one thing I want to begin to very really enter into the record to recognize is in a lot of instances Jesus uh says oh you have little faith and oh you have little faith in some places he says no faith um the scriptures talk a lot about something being wrong with someone's faith and then he commends ones for great faith I haven't seen such a great faith oh what great faith and he compliments Faith but here there's no there's no comment about faith so he's not criticized or condemned for the lack of faith and really I will say this despite the fact that he displayed no faith at all Jesus did not withhold from him healing there's no there's no apparent display of Faith it's not like would you be made whole and he says well you know what I'm never the first one in the water but Rabbi if you would if you would pray since you're here I can be healed there's nothing to indicate that he had any faith but it's so there's no condemnation of his faith there's no remarking about little faith or corrupted Faith or weak Faith despite any evidence of him having faith Jesus still heals him now I think that's just an observation I'm not trying to make a Doctrine out of that just saying as we observe it and what we can conclude based upon the scripture is that he did not know who Jesus was and you're gonna have to stay real close with me today I would say that not only is he healed despite his knowledge but his ignorance of who Christ was may have benefited him his lack of knowledge may have helped him in this instance again really stay very close to me today because I'm going to be reading a lot of scriptures to look at that aspect of how this man in John chapter 5 didn't have any prior history healed in a moment and how that applies to us in Mark chapter 6 verses 1 to 6 it says and he went out from fence and came into his own country so these are people that would know him know his family know his history and his disciples follow him and when the Sabbath day was come he began to teach in the synagogue and many hearing him were astonished saying from whence half this man these things now instead of just listening to him in the context of a teacher who's sharing things and able to receive wisdom from him or resonate in their heart saying I don't know who he is or what his background is but this speaks to my heart this this is true this is real wisdom they say where did he get this what wisdom is this which has given him that even such Mighty Works were wrought by his hands how is it that he has wisdom and that these Mighty Miracles are being done by him that recognize this they're not so much wrestling with the fact that wow this is wise this is amazing where did he get it and wow these Mighty Miracles are of God where did he come from this wasn't coming from a real uh just a place of positive just inquisitive not quite sure just want to know like maybe I I remember one time I was in a meeting and a brother was preaching I'd never heard him preach before and it's maybe not a name you hear very much and I was sitting next to brother Donnie Reagan and I was like where's this guy been right and he goes in the word apparently and um and it was like duh man it was it was awesome and so sometimes you can ask and it wasn't brother Wayne awesome it was there's questions sometimes you have you're like hey where did this come from and it's not like where'd you get that you know did you cheat no it's it's a genuine maybe just a sincere question these aren't innocent questions because notice verse three it's not this the carpenter the son of Mary the brother of James and Joseph and of Judah and Simon are not his sisters here with us they had a problem with them because they knew things about them they knew his history they knew his mom and dad they knew his brothers and everyone always asked me were you the one that got kicked out of Louisiana Louisiana camp like no that was my brother's but they know your dad they know your mom they know your history they know all these things about you and that's what was the hang up right is it because they knew they almost Knew Too Much they couldn't just take it as from him that's why it can be very hard on uh when God raises up ministry within a church a lot of times the biggest problem isn't so much the person's inexperience or the immaturity it's everybody else is like I changed his diapers I've watched him since he was this and and they all have a really hard time imagine that the person standing before them is gifted they always see him as 12 years old I'm telling you I think my dad still thinks I'm 12 years old right because it's really hard to imagine oh this your son's almost 50 now he's he's seen some things he's been some places but that's just how people are they always they have a your history kind of travels with you we know his sisters we know his brothers we know his family history he's just a carpenter he didn't go to schools he's not a rabbi we know about this we know about that so Jesus says a prophet is not without honor but in his own country and among his own kin and in his own house and obviously there could be just logical explanations for this but watch the ramifications and he could there do no Mighty work save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk and healed them and he marveled because of their unbelief and he went round about The Village's teaching now his Fame had already been spread abroad everywhere when they remark about his teaching it's not that they're taking an issue with the moment something he's saying but they even know about all the mighty works that are being done by his hand and you'll read in several different places in the scripture where the fame about him was sent went abroad and people knew who he was and they're hearing things that are being said and they hear this testimony they hear that testimony and here were people with known best plus his ministry they rejected him based upon what they knew right and so when Fame is spread abroad and where someone begins to gain knowledge it's not always good knowledge is not always good Fame is not always always good and I guess I could say specifically when it comes to Christ that just because they knew doesn't mean they knew just because they heard doesn't mean they heard did you know that Jesus of Nazareth raised the dead and it's not like when they hear that and they believe the report they're like this is a miracle where is this teacher where's this Rabbi they're like who Jesus and they're all hung up on isn't he a carpenter I know his brother James right instead of being like he raised the dead right they're taking an issue with his 23andMe profile and so in Mark chapter 11 they asked the question again verse 28 they sent him by what Authority doest thou these things and who gave you this authority to do these things they're always questioning where does it come from who are you what have you done and in John chapter 5 again verse 10 the Jews do the same thing and the healing of this impotent man who Jesus just speaks to and he's made whole the Jews therefore said unto him that was cured it is the Sabbath day it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed and his answer is he that made me whole the same said unto me take up thy bed and walk now if you recognize this the issue is not with the healing it's in this particular place uh their issue is the fact if I could say it this way their problem relates to a religious legalism a religious tradition their Sabbath tradition the oral history that developed around the Sabbath all these extra weights and things they begin to place upon a person related to Sabbath and so this man is healed on the Sabbath day and like who cares you're not supposed to be walking around on the Sabbath day and so what was hindering them is this breadth of knowledge that they had about the details and the specifics and all these other things that were in the in the view and so their criticism hey you're not supposed to be walking with your bed on the Sabbath day Provence uh prompts of air revealing response from this man I'm doing with the man who healed me said dude said to do I'm doing what he said I'm not questioning it I'm not quibbling with it I'm just doing what he said but the ones that asked the question they're the ones that are always hyper focused on these details that really don't even matter in Matthew chapter 23 verses 23 and 24 woe and you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for ye paid tithe of mint and anus and cumin they tied on the spices to the precise measure you're so particular about the mint and the anus and the cumin they're very very particular and precise he says and have omitted the weightier matters of the law judgment mercy and faith and then he doesn't he's not saying it's wrong to be precise when it comes to tithing but he says these you ought to have done and not to leave the other undone but he's like you're so hyper focused on these nitty-gritty details you missed the big picture if the nitty-gritty details are part of the big picture you're fine but you've been blinded by this Precision you've been blinded by this legalism you've been binded by these particular elements and you've omitted the other parts that are even heavier or more weighty and I love the language he uses uh just how it's almost poetry how he says you tithe on this and you omit the weight of your matters it's beautiful language and then this verse 24. ye blind guides which strain at a net and swallow a camel strain on a net they can't swallow a net they choke on a net but can swallow a camel this is what this is quite the illustration of what these Pharisees were prone to do is strain on something that should be so easy to accept but can swallow all these other things that are uh that maybe shouldn't even be swallowed just I guess I'm realizing now I'd like to spend more time on this statement just how much it causes you to stop and think you strain on the net but you can swallow a camel but in John chapter 5 this man who was healed he didn't have any objection he's laying there maybe he didn't expect the waters to be moved on a Saturday but he wanted to hold his place and Jesus says would you be made whole he doesn't say yeah but it's a Sabbath sorry he has no objections when Jesus says take up thy bed and walk he didn't say well who are you there's no questions there are no objections there's no explanation even when they say hey it's the Sabbath day what are you doing walking around he says the one who healed me told me to do it so in his mind there's no objections there's no question there's no wrestling but watch the nature of the Pharisees in John chapter 9. I'm going to read to verse 21 this is a very long reading let's just read through it and enjoy these camel swallowers and the way that they approach these things in John chapter 9 verses 1 to 21 and Jesus passed by he saw a man which had been blind from his birth talk about a chronic condition and his disciples asked him saying is this not the nature of all of us master who did Sin this man or his parents that he was born blind the question even sounds funny did this man sin that he was born blind yeah he told a bunch of lies in the womb and I mean it just it ended it right there as far as his eyesight was concerned who sinned this manner's parents that he was born blind Jesus answered I take these things personal today neither this man sinned nor his parents but that the works of God should be made manifest in him I must work the works of him that sent me while this day the night cometh when no man can work as long as I'm in the world I am the light of the world and when he had thus spoken now without any prompting seemingly on the Blind Man's part but by him being called to their attention he spits on the ground makes clay of the spittle he Anointed The Eyes of the blind man with clay and said in him go wash in the pool of Salome which is in by interpretation sent the blind man he went his way therefore and washed and came seeing no objection from the blind man no like whoa wait a minute what are you putting on my eyes it just happens he does exactly what he's told and he's healed now the what causes Jesus to heal this man isn't the initial question of well why is he sick it's got to be a reason for it and perhaps if we could find the reason why he's sick and there's this wrestling he says you know what no man hath sinned that he is sick but that the work of God may be manifest and he does it he heals him verse 8. the neighbors therefore they which before had seen him that was blind said is not this he that sat and begged so now that he's healed the neighbors who know him like this is the beggar this is the blind man he's healed some said this is he the other said he is like him right he's like him but he's not him he's like the blind guy he's not the blame but he's like him he looks like he's just doppelganger it's not him but he said I am he oh no it's me I was the one that was blind but now sees therefore said then to him how were thine eyes opened he answered and said a man that is called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes and said unto me to go to the pool of Siloam and wash and I went and washed and I received my sight what an accurate testimony he's not trying to reason with it he's not saying well there's clay has these particular properties that when applied to the eyelids breaks up cataracts and things he just said this is what this is what happened no explanation Jesus healed me all healing is Divine Healing he says then said they unto him where is he he said I don't know and now this is where it starts getting interesting they brought to the Pharisees hymn that was that before time was blind and it was the Sabbath day when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes so this is the problem heals the guy's eyes and they want to get they want to start getting really patented about well what day was it um thanks for raising my dead mom but why on a Saturday right they take issue with the day the fact that it's Society then again the Pharisees also asked him who received his sight he said to them he put clay upon my eyes and I washed and do sea therefore said some of the Pharisees this man is not of God because he keepeth not the Sabbath day others say how can a man that is a sinner do such miracles and there was a division among them they say unto the blind man again really I think it's almost impossible for us to really get an idea of just how chaotic this scene was it's almost like it's some comedy sketch we should maybe have the youth group act this out sometime because it reads like a script and all the personalities and here's the guy's like hey I've been blind my whole life and now I see what kind of Sinner can do something like this do you realize it's a Saturday this man is a sinner and and it's all sorts of all this commotion and all the he's constantly being asked his testimony never varies but there's a division among them and this guy's pretty certain this man anointed my eyes with clay that he made with spit told me to go wash and I can see this is really simple Jesus healed me and now I see and they're all in an uproar and it says they they said to the blind man again what says Thou of him that he that open Thine Eyes what do you say about him he says he's a prophet but the Jews did not believe concerning him that he had been blind so now they doubt that he'd even been blind they're like wrong answer buddy and the and he received his sight so they didn't even believe his test might not really he hadn't been blind before this is somebody else like him he says until they called the parents of him that had received his sight and they asked them saying again think about how crazy this is can you just imagine all these rabbis running around you know all dressed up knocking on doors is this really the guy and they're all in this uproar not not like in a great way like nobody's saying this guy's eyes are opened it's everything else that's in the way and they knock on the door is this your son who you say was born blind how then does he now see his parents answered them and said very good answer we know that this is our son and that he was born blind but by what means he now seeth we know not or who hath opened his eyes we know not maybe a good answer for a lot of people who don't know he says he is of age ask him he shall speak for himself this is the what I want you to consider is we in our minds maybe just Backtrack on these several verses such a struggle for them to accept this miracle and instead of just accepting it they had so many questions even even when it came to the sickness the disciples like did this guy sin that he was born blind and Jesus might have been like what think about the question you just asked me okay was it his parents you know and maybe it was John that did it so he changes the question a little bit but no he says what about his parents they're like so they're they're trying to figure it out this is just the human mind let's figure it out why I could say this about about Elliot Elliot exhibited some various severe symptoms and was very very sick and then I believe God touches them and now what does everybody want to know who knew that he was sick not the Believers but the doctors like we're gonna get to the bottom of this right we're gonna find out what it is it's like well good luck right I don't have any confidence that I can be able to figure out what it was and I said well we're just kind of scratching our heads because that's just human nature it's inquisitive it wants to know it wants to figure things out there's almost this part of us that uh if we're not in the know that we feel as if something is missing or something is lacking so they had questions they had this need for answers they wanted to make sense of all of it and maybe if I could just take it a step further with the Pharisees it wasn't are you sure this is him this is really him he was born blind wow it was like okay so this was him okay well then what day was it and who is this man and this has got to be the devil and and Jesus was confronted with this a lot and he had to say is this house of Satan divided can Satan cast out Satan it really is a paradigm shift in a lot of ways and it's actually a challenge to us to be very careful that we're not just always super critical of things that God can do but it's such a struggle now Paul in second Timothy chapter 2 verse 23 tells us but foolish and unlearned questions avoid knowing that they do gender strifes that's exactly what's happening in John chapter nine maybe these aren't the exact questions that Paul is thinking about but I would say that these are a number of questions that lend itself to foolishness and unlearned questions where okay if you keep asking these questions what does the answer matter are we not asking questions that ultimately just get further away from the fact that God Is A Healer gets further away from the fact of the promise of God and you're trying to build a lot of context or add color or something when it's not even necessary I mean here's a good rule of thumb don't ask a question that you don't really want the answer to and so there's a lot of foolish and unlearned questions he says avoid foolish questions avoid ignorant questions avoid unlearned questions avoid asking questions that the answer is just going to lead to strive for disagreement now this could be in the context of uh with others but I'm wanting us to relate this to ourselves how that there's a way that we can start asking questions and wanting to build context and add color to something and it's just leading to more internal strife in our Spirits than it is leading us to a solution my title today was almost the Pharisee in me and then I thought you guys would just would be thinking maybe I was talking about myself only but then if I called it the Pharisee and you then it would be like I'm calling you out and I was like you know what just forget it the Pharisee in us that was it I think we should be honest about the Pharisee in US how each one of us have a have as it were the shadow of a Pharisee who's doing shadow puppets in our mind right one is to consider things what is this what does this look like and what do you see here and we're trying to read the tea leaves and divine in the cloud shapes and there's things that we find ourselves struggling with and this is where I'm coming to the real Crux of what I'm wanting to uh address today by God's grace is we need to be honest about our own struggles and our minds honest about the questions that we have even in our own lives of what if this happens what if it's because of this and what if that and what if what if what if what if we go all these what ifs and then maybe well what sin cause it did this happen did that happen how about we all been there before that in one of our most difficult trials and something is happening we begin to think oh no what have I done to deserve this oh no what did I do that was wrong oh no what if it's this what if it's that well let me just say if there's something you've done that's put you in that position then all you need to do is make that right because God is greater than the situation there's if that's what God is doing I don't know if I'm getting too far ahead of myself but there should there ought not to be any despair if he says well God am I sick because I sin he's like yeah then it's not like oh no it's like Lord forgive me for my sin he's like all right just waiting for you to ask right like we take some of these things on as if it's a sentence because we take the same that we take the same approach too Dr Jesus as we do to our doctors and and we've had some tests done and you're going to get the results and you get all anxious and you're all nervous about the results and oh no what are they don't ever be nervous about the results God has don't ever you're his bride you're the elect don't ever be worried about what he needs to share with you lay it on me Lord let me have it why because he's never going to give you a death sentence he's never going to say he got two months to live he's never he's never going to give make you feel fearful he's gonna say all right this is the deal but this is how we handle it all right this is the problem you've done this that and the other but this is how you fix it you're like I got it take up my bed and walk right there's there's always a remedy with him there's never this being undone there's no there's no despairing there's no when I say despairing like this is the totality this is the sentence this is over I've been rowing God always does things best and this is this is the Pharisee in us that kind of walks down these we it could be a one-man act John chapter 9 in our lives we're the ones asking all the questions we're the disciples on one hand were the Pharisees on another were the parents it's that this chaos in our spirits so James chapter 5 verse 13. we're coming back to this before we call for the elders and have them anoint us with oil and pray a prayer of faith that we might be delivered he says is any among you afflicted remember that Affliction is the Affliction of mind and emotions and passions let them pray is any Mary let him sing Psalms before you text the the minister group and ask for them to come and pray for you are you Afflicted in your mind then pray are you happy no then sing Psalms James is saying if you have an Afflicted mind you're weighed down with questions and speculations if you're if you're a little bit uh lacking hope or whatever it might be I think you could think about this in a very broad context for us that what James is addressing is not the physical sickness but the condition of a person's mind who may be sick physically and there it's very possible I say it's very possible let me just say we are often Afflicted in our minds by virtue of our sickness the the the the disappointments in life we can have scars we can have lost hopes we could have failed expectations a lot of things that kind of happened to us and because those things happen they can tend to have maybe the preeminence in our thought process and James is saying if you have an Afflicted mind then pray he puts it right within your wheelhouse as a Believer right in your responsibility that if something's not quite right in the way that you're thinking and feeling why don't you pray he says are any of you Mary which means to be be in good spirits to be happy to be glad or cheerful so he's saying do you have an Afflicted mind then pray to write your mind if your mind's Disturbed if you if you're losing hope if things are chaotic in your mind if the Pharisee in you has got a lot of shadow puppets that's causing you to see monsters and speculate and ask a bunch of questions and kind of clouds your view of the promise he's not saying call for the elders and have them pray for you he's saying get your mind right first and as a Believer you've got the power of God inside of you to begin to approach God through prayer and prayer will have the way of aligning your spirits in order to receive your healing not very bad I believe and I would assert that a restful mind and a good attitude are the prerequisites to Healing because before you call for the elders to lay hands on you he says are you Afflicted in your mind then pray you can maybe say it this way or if you're sick ask yourself first how are you emotionally what's your attitude like what's your attitude towards the promise if it's not where it needs to be pray are you sad sing Psalms get your spirit right then ask for healing because we have a different situation and this is where I want to make it relevant to us in this gentleman in John chapter five we have a different situation than he did in his mind it was I'm sick and I want to be well and that was it that was the only that was the only factor for him would you be made whole and he's like yeah I want to be made whole but I can't ever get in the water nothing is said about his faith good or bad and if I'm if if you say well brother you're taking you're taking some a very large leap here in in concluding this the scripture does not say he had bad faith or good faith it wasn't little it wasn't great it wasn't lacking it wasn't weak but regardless his condition did not hinder Christ and was the Bible says Matthew 13 58 and he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief so we know that unbelief can hinder God we know in other contexts unbelief does not stop God but there's Divine will that he does of his own accord there's other things that are to us and for us that requires our faith towards the promise and if we don't believe then we cannot benefit and we cannot receive he did not do Mighty works because of their unbelief so this man who was impotent for 38 years and who was sick for 38 years he was able to receive his healing and so it's not that because he had good faith but if I could just say he didn't have bad faith he didn't have a hypocritical Faith he didn't have a confused Faith he didn't have divided loyalties he wasn't like yeah but I was James was my best friend in high school I know too much about you right I dated your sister once this isn't going to work that's not what he he did have these objections to Christ and so brother Brown makes these two statements I don't have the quotes on a slide because they were just very very short but this is this is wow your healing might not be five minutes away your unbelief will keep it away from you as long as you live your healing may not be but five minutes away but your unbelief will keep it away for as long as you live your healing could be right there and the only thing keeping you from it is your unbelief I would say the same mechanics are at work with respect to the man in John chapter five the Healer was right there and the one thing that could keep him away would be his unbelief but in the absence of unbelief God is able to take that initiative and to heal him brother Brown says each person is a spirit and if the spirit is unbelief it hinders so we have a spirit about us we have a kind of an attitude like we said I mean let's just think of it this way have any of you ever been angry right yes like 100 participation we've all been angry but that doesn't mean you are angry right we've all been hungry but so it was a kind of a state of mind or a condition that we're in in the moment and therefore it characterizes us not because that's who I am in essence I'm always angry maybe angry would be a good one we're hungry and angry or we're angry because we're hungry but that's that's temporary because then we can do something and then we're no longer angry and just because you were angry doesn't mean that's what you always are so he says there's a spirit a person is a spirit and if in the moment it's angry if in the moment it's unbelief if in the moment it's hesitant if in the moment it's doubting I was going back over how Peter was able to walk on water and Jesus when he when he began to sink he says he had little faith wow little faith is all you need to walk on water and that's how powerful faith is but unbelief is so powerful that it's what will cause you to sink or the doubt is what he refers to the fear that comes in and interrupts the process so if in the moment our Spirits instead of being receiving receptive and open and free and happy if it's Afflicted and unhappy then that's what causes the characterization of the recipient that hinders the healing in the sermon I am the resurrection and the life Mary said behold the handmaid of the Lord she started rejoicing she was happy God had promised it she knew she was going to have that baby I believe I spoke something about it last night she didn't wait till she felt life she didn't wait till she was positive she didn't wait till any visible sign she just believed what the angel said was the truth there you are if you could just listen please this is coming right to the heart of it the trouble of it is we question God and if we question God we can't believe God now that doesn't tip us over into the realm of the agnostic or the atheist that is talking about if I could just say in that moment God says this is for you and you're like well but God who sinned and what about this and what about that then we're not believing God right the spirit becomes unbelief and that's what hinders our healing may be five minutes away God said your healing's five minutes away instead of us counting down 458 457 right instead of us counting down we're like yeah it'll still be five minutes away but you live your whole life and never get it right unbelief will keep it away it doesn't change the fact that it's five minutes away well you told me my my healing was five minutes away and it's been three weeks it's still five minutes away your unbelief hasn't started the clock yet the trouble is we question God and if we question God we can't believe God faith is the substance things hoped for the evidence of things you don't see tasteful smell are here we're only responding to the chronology we're only responding to the facts or the symptoms or the history well I need to know more about this I need to know more about that listen I know it's taken over the sports world but but the saber metrics and analytics and data it doesn't apply with God he said well in the history of divine healings nobody has ever been healed of lymphoma on a Tuesday after three o'clock if they had a mango for breakfast and so there's like this probably the percentage by with which you can believe you can be healed is it 99 listen it doesn't matter with God it doesn't matter if throughout all history it has never been done God is able but yeah we want to kind of shoehorn things into the picture well what about this what about that if I could say this because what what I'm re I'm relating to Believers and The Chronic conditions of the heart speaks to these conditions in our spirit and our mind that hinder us from receiving our healing and if I could put it this way sometimes Believers I'm talking about real Bona fides real Christian real genuine Believers have heard too much seen too much and felt too much until their heart is not centered on the promise [Music] it's not just the critics it's not just the Pharisees it's just not the neighbors it's not just the the people who heard it's us we're unlike the man by the by the pool because he's just there wanting to be healed and there's nothing else in the way but where they're going yeah but you know I've been I've been in this message 38 years and this has happened and this has happened and that's happened and I've prayed and I've asked for this and I've asked for that wow First Timothy chapter 1 verse 5 it says the end of the Commandment of his charity out of a pure heart and a good conscience and faith on feigned faith without the hypocrisy faith without the pretense faith not mixed with doubt faith not mixed with the put on so if we could say we have the faith and the mind of Christ in our soul it's whatever what is what has ever whatever is out front whatever it is that we're pondering in our minds whatever it is we're considering whatever the questions we're asking whatever the Pharisee in US is indicting in the moment he says we ought to the Commandment is a pure heart and a good conscience have to have a pure heart and a good conscience and a faith unfeigned faith unfeigned relates to how our heart the condition of our heart and the condition of our conscience these two other scriptures in first Timothy holding faith and a good conscience which some having put away concerning Faith have made shipwreck if I could say this wreck your conscience you're wrecking your faith if your conscience is wrecked your faith is hindered if your conscience is in turmoil your faith is trying to ride out the waves now does that mean your soul is in turmoil no your soul is wanting to step up Faith is ready to arise but where you are in the moment is the spirit of unbelief the spirit of doubt the spirit of chaos and everything is tossing to and fro and you have all these questions and the guy next to you can be a guy who's been sick 38 years and doesn't know anything about Christ doesn't know anything about the message and he's able to be healed but you're over there being rocked by your history rocked by everything you know rocked by all the quotes Rock by this Rock by that and you're there without the good conscience that faith has to be held in next verse the mystery of faith is held in a pure conscience I would say this is a this is a maturity of thought wow the more I thought about it yesterday it's like this this has to do with attitude and disposition not being pouty not being negative the promise isn't weak his faith isn't weak could it be the weakness of our minds then that's hindering our faith I cheated I just looked at the clock in second Timothy Chapter 2 we're doing great it's really really early in second Timothy Chapter 2 Verse 3 thou therefore endure hardness endured affliction endure turmoil as a good soldier of Jesus Christ listen Believers go through it yeah we've seen things we've heard things you don't we those of us who I look out upon a congregation that's that you're Christians you're Believers you're not new to this and even if you are you've been through things you see things uh when you come to Christ everybody's not patting you on the back and the longer we believe Christ more people aren't coming to see things the way we do we're more and more in the minority every day I'm sorry saying endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ you have to suffer Affliction you have to endure difficulty your minds are going to be buffeted you're going to go through a lot of turmoil a lot of Agony a lot of distress but he says endure it or to endure hardness but not become hard Bill Graham says in Victory Day it seems like a Christian the Christian Life if the fellow is not absolutely centered on Christ the Christian life seems like it holds so many disappointments and that is exactly true that we fail sometimes to see the grace in in the failed expectation we fail to see the blessing in the things that God has moved us away from or kept from us sometimes we fail to see the benefit that was achieved through the suffering so if someone's not completely centered on Christ all we see is the disappointment all we see is the suffering maybe all we see is that we've been sick for 38 years or so many weeks or for so long and we we suffer so many disappointments I've been praying for my healing I've prayed and prayed that this would happen this prayer wasn't answered this happened this person fell away this person was lost this happened this time and it just seems like all the disappointments piled up so Paul tells the Hebrews in chapter 12 verse 15 looking diligently lest any men fail of the grace of God and we fail to grasp and see the grace of God and whatever it is he allows for us to go through and if we fail to mix our condition with God's grace and his eternal view the root of bitterness is what Springs up lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled I could say this when I have endured personal hearts and things I've gone through personally with other individuals there's a part of you that is so hurt and so shocked that when you thought you should see Christ you see quite the opposite if you're not careful to realize that God still no that's what I knew that that would not destroy me knew that he could use it it wasn't going to Define me it wouldn't it wasn't going to defeat me and that my attitude towards it that I must conduct myself with joy in the midst of the trials that he and his wisdom allow us to come to pass and I don't need to say well was that inspired by Satan did God tell him to do it why did this happen but just have the right attitude towards it because if I don't that's when I can get bitter and a brood of bitterness will trouble you our experiences our disappointments lead to that bitterness you have to stay with me I'm going to try to go very very quickly here and the sermon uniting time and sign did I not give the title on that are there okay there it is I think one of the horriblest things is to see a man or a woman that's constantly complaining I've always thought God keep me from it say that weak and safe all the time you know the constant complaining you take whatever you need to that relates to this chronic condition of your mind complaining negativity fear doubt he says it weakens Faith all the time to complain well it's true it's not helping sometimes we think just because it's true it's okay to say it and well it's not complaining it's true no listen to this someone who's constantly complaining says that weakens Faith all the time now this principle he points to I know as we get older as they get older each one of us we're going to get something happen and something happened he's acknowledging that as you live things add up things happen all of us now listen we go through things we go through things we go through things he says I know those little things are going to keep accumulating that as you get older they just got to but he says listen I think one of the most horrible things is for Satan to Crown some person's life a grabbed old man or an old woman I hope I don't get to that place that should shock us brother Branham realize the potential for even a Son of God to get to the place where things just add up and in the end they're just cranky they're just critical they're cynical and they and this person that and this person this and no one preaches it the way I do it yeah right and that's all everything ever is like and you can't share anything oh well yeah guess what happened I was reading a quote the other day and brother Brad said this and I read that in 67 son right it's like oh sorry to bring up a bad memory it's like there's no rejoicing there's no Liberty there's no freedom they're cankered and crabbed up I hope I don't get to that place listen how he speaks this is the word being spoken to that person I hope I can bear it my burdens I hope I can bear it listen we're not saying Lord I don't want to go through it Lord I don't want to see it I don't want to experience it no I want to be able to bear it want to be able to go through it and get to a spot where I want my life crowned with the glory of God his long-suffering gentleness peace meekness and filled the Holy Spirit oh and I'm not asking that you take away the Buffett and you take away the pain you take away the rejection that you take away all the difficulties and problems but Lord let me mature to the place where my faith is not pouty my disposition is not negative and cynical and critical but Lord let me get to the place where I can be long-suffering gentle peaceful Meek because I'm filled with the spirit let that be the crowd let the man the crown of my life be that I never had another trouble but let it be that in the midst of my trouble I kept my spirit clean and I know that chronic pain causes causes chronic complaining I think my one of my children told me listen the church nobody in the church knows who ior is whenever I reference Eeyore okay well maybe we'll play a clip but it's the the donkey in Winnie the Pooh I almost said Peter Rabbit Winnie the Pooh and uh and he it's always this real dour right I think it was brother Eugene Braun who first used it I was like yes that's it that was a really good impression that scares me right but it's just that's the kind of that attitude it's always negative right horse walks into the bar and the bartender says so I have a long face right that's just kind of like always sad and always disappointed and always undergoing I I'll admit I've I've been that person because man we all can't be like brother John Andy's right look at everything I want everything to always be such a blessing right I want everything to always be so wonderful and that's where we really need to be in some ways to be positive to be under expectation like man this is the worst day of my life that means it only gets better what if it gets worse then that means the bet is gonna even be better and I know when we go through things chronically it's very real James chapter 5 verse 9 Grudge not against another brother unless you be condemned behold the judge standeth before the door if I could paint the picture very quickly if you just somehow related this to yourself grudging condemns you not just against one another because that's certainly true but the grudging the complaint Grudge means to complain and to groan it leads to your condemnation and you are even your own judge because you know when you're grudging and if you're a Believer you don't like it you know it's not right there's something in you that's telling you you know you shouldn't feel this way so you're condemning yourself it's not like God is sitting there going brother what are you thinking you're over there looking you said Aaron what are you thinking you don't need another to judge you fans at the door it's right there within you when we're grudging we feel condemned brother random says that God is in his people I'm wanting to I have to do I want to go through this very quickly to identify how that God is speaking the word is speaking to this inner turmoil not talking about the soul but we're wanting to address the healing of our body and there's places the believer gets that keeps them from having the right attitude towards the word he heals the Methodist Baptist Catholic Pentecostal and all God don't respect your church affiliation he expects your respects your faith in him he don't even you don't even have to be a Christian to be healed amen amen but in order to order to stay healed you have to become a Christian go ye and sin no more worst thing a worse thing than this will come upon you I think it makes a lot of sense but notice you don't have to be a Christian to be healed it says nothing about how long it'll last or how long you'll stay sickness free they say you don't have to be a Christian he says I've seen many times the callous saints come through the prayer line men and women who've lived Godly and failed to be healed when prostitutes on the street would come through the line and be healed depends on your faith why why would a saint be in a prayer line not be able to be healed and a prostitute would he says that the calloused saint what's callous not the soul it's the heart the heart's just calloused seeing too much heard too much thinking too much wondering too much questioning too much where the prostitutes just like the man who had the pool of Bethesda what he what yes and the message Elijah brother says sometimes the adults are so callous the Holy Spirit just can't speak to them so he of course the scripture suffered the little children to come unto me forbid them not such as the kingdom what is it about a little child their experience doesn't get in the way there the the the innocence when a child begins to talk about God and Jesus is admirable and when when my children talk about God and and especially as they when that very young it's so real to them that even their questions are very revealing because you realize they have accepted it so absolutely that it's ramifications are absolute to where it's like so if Jesus is in my heart what about this and what about that there's this innocence there's a sensitivity they're tender this is what a childlike faith is a child like faith is just takes God in his word and is not supplementing it with everything else that says but but there's no Pharisee in them brother in the sermon God's provided Place provided a way of approach to Fellowship says I see over here on my left even some little children you know the scripture speaks of a little child leading them in Isaiah chapter 10 their hearts not been pulled through so much of the world till they're young and tender they love God and God loves them and he can talk to them now this is us we've seen so many disappointments and things it's hard for our hearts and many times we get pulled through old true story magazines and stuff of the world and that should never have been there it's calloused it number of statements that talk about how the world callouses it but then it also relates to experiences the calicit disappointments and things things Harden our heart and listen don't think that as a Believer you can be pulling yourself to a bunch of nonsense and worldliness whatever it might be whether it be sports or entertainment and don't think that that doesn't have an effect on your heart that that doesn't impact you when you stand before God to ask for a promise it's callous it says God will take away every callous off you if you'll just let them make you tender sweet kind-hearted loving forgiving one another if you'll just have faith just believe I need Faith first from my mind and my heart I need to ask myself am I Afflicted if I am pray if I'm not happy I need to sing Psalms everyone says the little child wasn't callous like many adults you just have faith with belief there's a callousness there that's what I'm looking at in The Chronic conditions of the heart in second Kings chapter five we'll look at this very quickly if you read start with verse 1 to verse 14 it tells us how Naaman he was a captain in the Syrian Army and he had a wife uh who's I believe whose servant was a believer and and through the process the the king petitions they petition the king of Israel for healing about the prophet there's a there's a Healer in Israel there's a prophet in Israel in petition for healing and King Israel gets all upset about it but Elisha is like hey this is the chance for God to make himself known so Naaman actually come begins to come to Elijah as he comes Elijah he has ten silver talents he has six thousand pieces of gold and he's got 10 suits like he's going to load Elisha up for the healing it says in verse 10 and Elisha sent a messenger unto him saying go in wash in Jordan seven times and thy flesh shall come again to thee and thou shalt be clean now if you recognize this here's an important man come in with a lot of reward for the prophet for his healing and the prophet doesn't even meet with them talk about big timing the big guy right here's the here's the captain coming and the prophet said no just sent somebody else to go tell them what to do go wash in the Jordan seven times dip seven times a Jordan and you'll be clean notice naaman's response he was Roth and went away and said behold I thought he will surely come out to me and stand and call in the name of the Lord his God and strike his hand over the place and recover the leper this is what we think sometimes really this is how it has to happen surely this is the way that it ought to be and not are not obana and farpa rivers of Damascus better than all the Waters of Israel so now he's just taking issue with where he wants them to dip and everything May I'm not wash in them and be clean he is just angry right James would say are you happy apparently not sing Psalms are you Afflicted in mine yes yes pray like let's not worry about your leprosy because right now your biggest problem your healing is five minutes away but you got all sorts of stuff out front that's going to keep you from it so let's deal with this other stuff first let's think about these other things first because all he said you need to do is dip yourself in this water seven times and you'll be clean and you're over here going we didn't even come out to meet me and I thought for sure he'd lay his hands on me he would call him I thought it'd be a more demonstrative prayer I went up for prayer and all the brother said was receive his healing in the name of Lord Jesus Christ he didn't even raise his voice ah and he says in his servant came near his servants came near now they begin to recognize this I said my father if the prophet had bid me to do some great thing would have thou not have done it right so there's this pretense there's wrong kind of attitude says now if you were asked to do something very demonstrative something very visible something very important would have you done it and obviously he's like yeah how much rather than when you say it to thee wash and be clean like if you want something so great and demonstrative if you would believe that if sometimes listen I think this is so pertinent sometimes we're asking God to go ahead and write it in the sky and believe in the great thing and like that's going to be enough and it's like well if you would believe in that why don't you just simply believe it like if you could believe the great thing or want to do a great thing how much more just the simple taking God at his word so he says how about just wash and be clean and that made him no longer angry he was no longer Afflicted he was no longer disconcerted then he went down and dipped himself seven times in Jordan and to me this is the double application according to the saint of the man of God and his flesh came again like under the Flesh of a little child and he was clean there's your wholeness that's the kind of faith we need to have sometimes we're a name and sometimes we're a Pharisee we fought way too many battles we've experienced too much unbelief we've had too many disappointments we've got way too many calluses way too many scars and we can't just take the word of God from the prophet to believe it we start trying to dissect it we try to start reasoning with it instead of just taking the token and applying it instead of just doing what it says and listen that's where your wholeness is is to come back to be a simple childlike Faith to believe it and just do it his heart whether you want to talk about his mind or his emotions they were healed first they were aligned first in order for his body to be healed I didn't go so far as to say he he overcame his immature objections like yeah so what really sometimes we maybe need to listen to ourselves or we just need to be honest with each other on some of these things that say and say really you got all this going on and that's what you're worried about the other man said it this way and then Jesus came he said no one prayed no one touched it at all talking about that baby but God touched the baby the presence of the Lord was here to heal why did it get it it was a baby it didn't have the superstitions and callousnesses calluses and wonderings that we have we have superstitions wonderings calluses these are all the things that get in the way and Paul says having therefore these promises dearly beloved second Corinthians 7 1 let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the Flesh and spirit perfecting Holiness in the fear of God all unfilthiness we could look at the flesh the filthiness of the spirit defilement is that by which anything is defiled he's talking about the pollution of our spirits what pollutes our Spirits temper bitterness grudging unforgiveness we'll get into some more of these details the the connection between forgiveness and healing is so powerful Pride jealousy Revenge you say what is the fact that I hold a grudge against my parents have anything to do with my healing could be the reason why you're sick that's what the message teaches us could be the reason why you're sick you're like well what is why do I have to forgive them in order to be healed it may be the reason why you're not well you've grudged and it's bringing your whole body down discouragement being hopeless these are the chronic conditions of the heart and the message expectation brother says now just believe him tonight and he'll do you the same way for he's no respect to person he's respecting faith God will only honor Faith even your salvation sometimes won't atone for your healing not the merits of your salvation you're not healed by that you're healed by the Merit what a phrase the Merit of your faith I've seen Christians come to the platform renowned Christians and fail to be healed and see a prostitute walk on the platform be healed instantly because the Christian had been drugged through many places and the skeptic kind of believing wonder if the days of Miracles have passed and they'll go off missing it now instead of trying to apply that template to us what kind of skepticism may we have when it comes our healing it may not be that the days of Miracles are passed it but it may be some line of reasoning or questioning to what we've just been drugged through places well I've had this condition for so long or it just keeps getting worse or maybe this is going to happen and what we're doing is we're trying to come up with a scientific explanation or rationalize instead of just saying God can heal me whenever he wants to and that's just where I leave it right there and a poor prostitute come to the platform knowing she's guilty condemned before God there give her heart to Christ be healed instantly just walk away so it's on the Merit of your faith Merit of your faith the worth of your faith it's on the I just the the spiritual credit of your faith your faith is what gives the credit to marry something in his condition that's deserving of a reward condition of something the conduct that deserving meritorious you merited this it's something I listen it's a mouthful but he's saying that if on the merits of your faith that your faith is what brings it so the worth of your faith the value of the faith how clean and pure your faith is and that Faith relates to the condition of your heart because he says your own salvation isn't what is atoning for your healing so God's not looking at the condition of the soul to heal your body he's looking at the condition of your faith or your heart to Grant you the blessing what is he talking about he's talking about your mood that's what if you're in a bad mood you're not going to get healed maybe I should just put that as the title and just have one slide on the archive if you're in a bad mood you're never gonna get healed do you agree if you're in a bad mood you're never gonna get healed if you're in a bad mood you're not going to enjoy this service it colors everything it's your attitude brother man said your right mental attitude towards any Divine promise says he will bring it to pass if you can get yourself in position to believe that that promise was to you what does it have to do attitude questions speculations reasonings so by getting yourself in position what does attitude have to do with viewpoint how you view something says the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass if you can look at it in the right way that's what attitude is about you're feeling towards something your opinion your disposition is talking about your posture your point of view it's the way that you're looking at it let me close on this in first John chapter 3 verses 18 to 22. I'm skipping a quote where brother Brown says sometimes you can just call us yourself just by the way you read the promise you can callous yourself I'm closing here my little children let us not love and word neither in tongue but indeed in the truth and hereby we know that we are of Truth and shall assure our hearts before him for if our heart condemn us God is greater than our heart and knoweth all things grudges bitterness it all condemns us why you condemn yourself if you didn't know any better you wouldn't be condemned but you know better it's the chronic condition of the heart it's there in your spirit but he tells you if your hearts condemn you God's greater and knows all things he's wanting you to fill and know there's deliverance from this greater is he that is in you that there's a there's a that you're that's not the end of the story when we condemn ourselves it's the greatest condemnation but he says God is greater than your heart and then he says beloved if our heart condemn us not then we have confidence towards God you know he wants us to have hearts at Liberty and whatsoever we ask we receive of him because we keep his Commandments and do those things that are pleasing in the sight to be condemned it means to find fault with because of our experiences and we should never do that if we prayed for a billion people and not one of them got healed we should still expect in the next prayer a person is going to get healed I know that sounds crazy and maybe a a data person like listen but in God we trust everyone else bring data Bill what was your dad that first told me that he had a co-worker who had a sticker on a cabinet said that and I was like I'm going to use that the rest of my life [Music] nice it doesn't matter to me what the experience is I'm not going to lower my expectations it doesn't matter what I've been through it doesn't matter what's happened I'm not going to lower my expectations and we'll do it because of painful memories we talked about triggers and being numb there's a way that we build ourselves in a place where we never want to trust again because we don't want to be disappointed well that may work with somebody but don't do it with God past disappointments our own failures mistakes these all become The Chronic conditions of the heart I know I'm closing now if we could just ready our hearts now we just bring it to this close if you can make it really personal and I want to see you when when the Bible says if our heart condemns us God is greater than your heart I believe that God wants to address your Afflicted mind he sees that he sees the problem in your body but he says you know what sister I could and that's just your body and yeah it'll be better but the greater healing would be if I could take condemnation out of your heart the greater healing would be if I could help you with all your disappointments and all your past experiences that would be better because you've interpreted the data way incorrectly you thought because this happened it meant this and you thought because that happened it meant this and you've been busy trying to interpret the data when all I've wanted you to do is just trust me and don't try to have explanations don't ask a bunch of parasitical questions don't try to have it all figured out don't try to be legalistic this is at the end of the day this is what kept coming to my mind God is more interested in an intimate relationship with you than he is how well your body is and God will be happy to let you suffer a little physical trouble if in the end it causes you a deeper fellowship and communion with you because that's what he wants at the end of the day is deeper Fellowship more genuine communion with you and sometimes you're just like God will you hear my body thanks see you later glad I'm well it's the heart issue that's the very that's what came to my mind when the Holy Christ my healer it was about healing our hearts that's how it originally came to me last year now listen to this statement and please I just I have just a few things here to close on at in the sermon at Thy word he's in a prayer line and his sister comes before him he says do you believe I'm God's Prophet that he's sent to help you what a question how could how ought we to pose that to us do you believe that I will be able to by God know what's wrong with you this is so beautiful you've had a misunderstood life haven't you do you believe listen you can look at the statement all you you just keep looking at the quote but listen do you believe God can tell you what's wrong with you and he says you've been misunderstood haven't you he's wanting to he want to identify what's wrong many times many heartaches and trials you went through I see something a dark streak hanging down a long road behind you you've changed now listen she couldn't she couldn't see The Long Dark streak but she knew about all the misunderstandings she knew all about the heartaches she knew all about the trials and what was it it was a dark stream behind her that she carried with her and brother banham sees it and God was wanting to tell her what was wrong with her what's wrong with her is she's way too conscious and if you think that I'm just embellishing this too much this impacts me so deeply that why would God expose all her life's misunderstandings why we'd expose her trials and her hardships if it had nothing to do with her stomach trouble or her ability to receive healing for the stomach trouble so he tells her you've changed now so that she could realize that dark streak's not hers anymore that all the misunderstandings all the hardships all the past that's like a dark shadow chasing her he could say you've changed that's not you he blocked off he damned up the stream he separated her out and then he says you're suffering with the stomach trouble aren't you isn't that right stand on your feet and receive your healing in the name of the Lord Jesus and be made well it wasn't just a gimmick to get her to believe that the prophet knew what her past was it was God telling her what was wrong with her faith in order to receive her healing she believed enough to stand there and want her healing but maybe her condition I'm speculating maybe her condition was chronic maybe the doctor said you're going to have to live with the rest of your life then maybe they didn't know what they were going to do and she believed for her healing but all her misunderstandings all her hardships all her trials were behind you're like a dark shadow he said it's a long road behind you but you've changed now you've changed now take your faith off the dark stream and put it in the promise and go and receive your healing oh did Jesus not say let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me let's not let our hearts be the trouble or let not our hearts trouble us he says if you got perfect love of God in your heart you don't question God about anything well that seems like to be a rebuke but it speaks to the problem when the Bible said I'm the Lord that heals all that he sees as you say Amen Lord that's right that's me are we not taught that if you had cancer and didn't fear and believe God would heal you you wouldn't be in a bad place because it's not the diagnosis that's bad it's the subsequent fear in doubt that's where the healing comes first God what if God took away some things from us but never dealt the underlying suspicion and fear and hesitation because then the next time something happens we're right in the same boat I think it's a real beautiful picture if we could bow our heads the Bible says in Romans chapter 8 verse 26 the spirit helps us in our infirmities we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit will make it a session for us with groanings which cannot be uttered James said if you're afflicted pray he said if you're sad praise that's what I'm going to ask you today if you have a chronic condition of your heart I'm not talking about your body your sickness whether it be back pain or stomach pain or headaches whatever I'm not talking about the physical part I'm talking about the Heart part if you have a chronic condition of your heart he's a Healer of the broken heart he's a lifter of our heads as the scripture says Christ My Healer it'd even be a greater healing to heal your heart maybe our prayer we don't even know what to pray but the spirit will make intercession for us with groanings our heads are bowed I know sometimes we offer we ask if there would be a hand raised or or something along those lines but the Bible said if you're Afflicted pray then I'm just going to ask today that if there be anybody who has a condition in their heart pray [Music]
