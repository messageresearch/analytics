[0:00] so we're we're going to um this is part
[0:02] two on a subject we started a couple
[0:04] weeks ago called a matter of faith and
[0:06] my subtitle today is augmented reality
[0:09] and so um uh the if you're writing down
[0:12] titles and subtitles you keep track of
[0:14] that it's a matter of Faith part to and
[0:17] um the subtitle augmented reality your
[0:20] mind may be going somewhere with that
[0:22] but I want to kind of turn it around on
[0:23] its head a little bit but this is a a
[0:26] series of services that going to work as
[0:28] a companion to um the Services we're
[0:30] preaching on Christ my healer and as
[0:33] we've looked at the aspects of Christ
[0:35] being our healer and in the initial
[0:38] laying the foundation and focusing on
[0:40] the word of God and what our uh healing
[0:42] is based upon and our different
[0:44] approaches maybe we've spent some time
[0:46] looking at some of the negative
[0:47] approaches that kind of keep us from
[0:49] receiving our healing uh the subject of
[0:51] Faith just keeps coming up over and over
[0:53] again to me and so I want to uh start
[0:56] looking at the subject of faith and I
[0:59] recognize that we're revisiting some of
[1:01] the same principles that we touched on
[1:02] in a few Services last year on blind
[1:05] trust uh uh blind trust bad faith and
[1:08] I'm sure you all remember them perfectly
[1:10] um so it'll be in those moments that you
[1:11] say Amen because you remember it but
[1:14] we're going to be revisiting some of
[1:15] those same things but I think approach
[1:16] it from a different perspective but if
[1:18] you want to go back uh to some of those
[1:20] principles I think they'll be helpful
[1:22] let's look at Hebrews chapter 11 verse1
[1:24] I was going to read several scriptures
[1:26] from
[1:27] Hebrews uh as my text but I I just want
[1:29] wanted to use that story um of the
[1:32] Canaanite Woman as a background for what
[1:34] we're speaking on and this is a the
[1:38] maybe the most uh obvious um statements
[1:42] about faith because it's defining faith
[1:44] it says now Faith is the substance of
[1:47] things hoped for the evidence of things
[1:49] not seen one of the most important
[1:51] things that we have to grab a hold of
[1:53] immediately in this reading is Faith is
[1:56] the substance of things hoped for so
[1:59] it's the the things hope for are things
[2:01] promised by God otherwise you'd have no
[2:04] basis to hope for them so when it says
[2:07] faith is the evidence of things hope for
[2:08] it's not just things you want or things
[2:10] that you hope to come to pass but things
[2:12] that the word of God has declared which
[2:14] creates The Hope or the expectation of
[2:16] it to be and so faith is the substance
[2:20] of things promised by God that you are
[2:23] hoping for and faith is the evidence of
[2:25] Things Not Seen and to say it's the
[2:28] substance it means it has actual
[2:30] existence and that's a that's when we're
[2:32] getting into substance Faith as we might
[2:34] say it something that has actual
[2:35] existence and if it's the evidence it's
[2:37] the conviction of the reality of
[2:39] something though you don't see it and
[2:42] are you picking up on those uh I hope
[2:44] you're entering into fellowship with me
[2:46] on this principle tonight faith is a
[2:48] substance faith is an Evidence and some
[2:50] of the statements we made last time is
[2:52] that and what this verse is saying is
[2:54] that Faith comprehends as a full reality
[2:56] as actually existing Faith comprehends
[2:58] as a full reality what cannot be grasped
[3:01] by our natural senses and we know we
[3:03] have senses that declare to us certain
[3:05] things it's declaring to us whether or
[3:06] not it's hot in this room or whether or
[3:08] not it's cold or whether or not the
[3:10] lights are on those our senses are
[3:12] declaring to us but Faith comprehends
[3:14] the full reality of something that even
[3:17] our physical senses can't declare to us
[3:20] and what we wanted to express last time
[3:22] and we're going to share this tonight I
[3:24] know that I think most of you if not all
[3:26] of you were there is that faith is a new
[3:28] way of since it relates to a sense faith
[3:31] is a new way of seeing it's a new way of
[3:33] interacting in the world that we already
[3:35] exist in it's a new way of living within
[3:38] the natural world I think we use the
[3:40] phrase that Revel Revelation is the
[3:42] upheaval of human thought that you think
[3:44] one way when Revelation comes it turns
[3:46] it around it turns it upside down and so
[3:48] when Revelation comes it changes your
[3:50] thinking and then once your thinking
[3:52] changes it changes the way you see the
[3:54] world and the way that you interact in
[3:55] the world that you still exist in and as
[3:58] faith and we should look at Faith not as
[4:00] just something that is given one time
[4:02] and as just something we refer to but
[4:05] it's something that's ongoing it's
[4:06] something that's transforming us it's
[4:08] something that is a that is living and
[4:10] so Faith or the life of Faith or a
[4:13] living faith the Walk of Faith however
[4:15] you might want to describe it is a a
[4:17] constant uh revolution of our character
[4:19] it's a changing of our character uh in
[4:22] relation to how we view ourselves
[4:24] because we're coming to understand who
[4:25] we are in the word of God but it's a
[4:27] change of your character and how you
[4:28] relate to your neighbor
[4:30] to those among you and it's a change in
[4:31] the way that you relate to the world so
[4:34] faith is something that changes
[4:35] everything in your life and as we use
[4:37] the phrase uh or the term ecstasy in
[4:40] relation to Faith and use some
[4:42] principles in the scripture that show
[4:43] that ecstatic realm that Faith brings
[4:45] you into faith is beyond mental reason
[4:49] faith is beyond the carnal carnal
[4:50] experiences I I would say that one
[4:53] phrase that keeps coming up in my mind a
[4:54] lot is Faith is a new
[4:56] reality and that in it being a new
[4:58] reality there's something Transcendent
[5:00] about it that when it takes place and
[5:02] when it happens it transcends our our
[5:04] natural existence it transcends where we
[5:06] are now and it puts us into a new
[5:09] experience and that's what faith
[5:11] does how about if you disagree with me
[5:14] you say
[5:15] no that way when it's quiet I'll know
[5:17] you agree with me at
[5:19] least and maybe you shouldn't do that
[5:21] but if you disagree with me just say no
[5:23] brother Aaron and I'll just go to the
[5:25] scriptures more and more until we can
[5:26] all say
[5:28] Amen but when we um so then faith is and
[5:32] I want you to really hopefully you're L
[5:34] listening tonight very intently to grasp
[5:36] a hold of this because I really I feel
[5:39] that I'm not bringing anything new but
[5:40] I'm wanting to put an emphasis on this
[5:42] that has been extremely helpful to me is
[5:44] completely changing the way I live it's
[5:46] changing my approach to the word it's
[5:48] changing my approach to Faith and it
[5:49] really feel like it's getting very much
[5:51] more deeper into the things of God and
[5:54] faith and this is very simple but faith
[5:56] is power to live above the world right
[5:58] it's uh it's power power to sense and to
[6:01] know and to act in terms of a
[6:04] supernatural reality so we're living in
[6:07] this world and we're we're not of this
[6:09] world but we're in this world and we've
[6:10] only been given certain ways to exist
[6:12] within this world but faith comes along
[6:14] completely transforms our existence we
[6:17] haven't left this Earth but it changes
[6:19] the way that we relate to it amen
[6:20] changes the way we see the Earth it
[6:22] changes the way we see one another it
[6:23] Chang the way I see myself and so it's
[6:25] an entirely new way of living because I
[6:28] I perceive things different l i sense
[6:30] things differently I and so I act
[6:32] differently in this natural world and
[6:34] I'm doing it according to a different
[6:36] reality that has awakened me right and
[6:39] once it it's if you believed that the
[6:41] world was flat and better not maybe I
[6:43] shouldn't go into the flat earther uh
[6:45] rabbit hole but you you would think and
[6:48] I realize just how unfortunate this is
[6:50] but you would think once you perform the
[6:52] experiments that disprove your belief
[6:55] that the Earth is flat or you see a
[6:57] picture of the Earth and it's round or
[6:59] you see the curvature on the horizon you
[7:01] perform different light experience
[7:03] experiments you say wow this is pretty
[7:05] much proven that there's some curvature
[7:06] to the Earth and you would accept now
[7:08] that I've seen it I can't go back to see
[7:10] it some other way that's just using a
[7:13] natural a natural way of describing how
[7:15] once you've been enlightened to
[7:17] something you can't go back well that's
[7:18] what faith is is it opens up a whole
[7:20] another reality Supernatural so it's not
[7:23] natural it's above natural and then when
[7:26] that charges you you can never be the
[7:28] same right it's referred to as a sixth
[7:30] sense and I think I want to use it in
[7:32] that way probably read some statements
[7:34] tonight that enforce that it is a sixth
[7:36] sense that contacts and knows and
[7:38] perceives uh what is unseen it's a sense
[7:42] that is uh can catch and feel and know
[7:45] something that is invisible to human
[7:47] senses God can move in a way that we can
[7:49] all feel it whether you're a Believer or
[7:52] not amen but then there's a faith in God
[7:55] that senses his presence that senses his
[7:57] nearness senses his will knows his
[7:59] desires and that's what we're talking
[8:01] about in terms of a sixth sense now our
[8:04] subtitle is augmented reality I want to
[8:07] spend a few moments on this um concept
[8:10] of augmented reality I'll talk to you
[8:12] about what it is in the natural brother
[8:15] Travis I was going to maybe hunt you
[8:16] down to just go ahead and give a
[8:18] 10-minute synopsis of augmented reality
[8:20] and how that we can use it in our
[8:22] University Systems and that'd be a
[8:24] perfect thing for Dean of academics to
[8:26] do and we've had some short
[8:27] conversations on even how augment in
[8:29] reality um is it's kind of an emerging
[8:32] technology that's being adopted in a lot
[8:34] more disciplines and a lot more
[8:36] technological thing settings
[8:38] construction and everywhere else and how
[8:40] many have heard of augmented reality
[8:42] raise your hands if you've heard of it
[8:43] and I know all the kids play with it all
[8:44] the time the most simple way to say to
[8:46] augmented reality is when you take the
[8:47] phone you're going to do a selfie and
[8:48] there's a little filter you can put on
[8:50] that makes you look like a dog that's
[8:52] just augmented reality or spider crawl
[8:54] on your neck that's augmented reality so
[8:56] it's overlaying uh something visual or
[8:59] even auditory or some other it's the
[9:01] overlay of some sort of sensory
[9:02] information it could be visual it could
[9:04] be audible uh just some way in a simple
[9:06] way is it's the way of taking what is
[9:09] and then overlaying something on top of
[9:11] it as you view it through technology to
[9:13] enhance the experience and so augmented
[9:16] reality not alternative reality but
[9:18] augmented reality is an enhanced version
[9:21] of the real physical world that's what
[9:23] augmented reality is it's an enhanced
[9:25] version this is how they describe it an
[9:27] enhanced version of a the real physical
[9:30] world so as I mentioned before an
[9:32] example would be overlaying certain
[9:33] digital images um imposed on the
[9:36] physical you're in this physical
[9:37] environment but having a means to
[9:39] Overlay some other digital image on top
[9:41] of that how many remember years ago when
[9:43] Pokemon go just blew up and everybody
[9:46] was finally
[9:47] outside and I remember just how strange
[9:50] it was and I'm trying just to remember
[9:52] exactly when it was my wife and I we
[9:54] went somewhere think it was oh it was
[9:55] with you brother Chris and sister
[9:57] Valerie we' gone to a homeschool commit
[9:59] convention in Houston and one evening we
[10:00] went out for dinner and there was droves
[10:03] of teenagers and just hundreds of people
[10:05] running around this one place and one
[10:08] place to another all running around it
[10:10] was chaotic and it was because this
[10:12] augmented reality of Pokemon go and I
[10:15] don't even know if that's still a thing
[10:16] it might be Pokemon go go now but it was
[10:19] taken using your a mobile device and it
[10:23] would augment the reality take the image
[10:25] and you'd find something digitally
[10:27] imposed on that device to enhance your
[10:30] human existence or your physical
[10:32] experience and whatever you were going
[10:33] through and so augmented reality is
[10:36] achieved through using visual elements
[10:38] it could be used by achieved by using
[10:40] sound or other sensory
[10:43] stimuli but it's technology that
[10:45] generates it and and this is very broad
[10:47] how that they can use it and so objects
[10:50] in the real world this is where there's
[10:51] something that exists in the real world
[10:53] but then you take something computer
[10:55] generated that
[10:57] uh provides some per seal information to
[11:00] you so it's not really there it just
[11:02] takes what's really there and overlays
[11:04] something fake on top of it and so
[11:06] you're able to view it in reality
[11:09] through that technology even noticed now
[11:11] whenever you buy something on Amazon you
[11:13] can choose to view it in your
[11:15] room no matter what it is you want to
[11:17] view those toothpicks in your room you
[11:19] can view them in your room and that's
[11:21] augmented reality it'll take whatever it
[11:22] is you're buying and it presented in
[11:24] some form visually in your room and it's
[11:28] uh and I'm too bad brother Lucas isn't
[11:31] here because I found this definition and
[11:33] I knew this would just really light him
[11:34] up because in augmented reality it it
[11:36] can be across multiple sensory
[11:39] modalities and that's one of brother
[11:41] Lucas's 50 Cent words modalities and it
[11:44] can be visual auditory touch taste and
[11:47] smell it does doesn't have to be visual
[11:49] it could even be smell it could be audio
[11:52] it could be um touch something haptic
[11:54] where there's some sort of feedback
[11:55] these are ways that you take someone's
[11:57] experience and then you provide some
[11:59] input to it to enhance it and this is
[12:02] different than virtual reality virtual
[12:05] reality is entirely different uh where
[12:07] you take a um virtual you create a
[12:09] virtual environment created by computers
[12:11] created by technology and kind of
[12:12] immerse yourself in it and it's more or
[12:14] less a a a removal from the actual
[12:18] physical space into a virtual one and
[12:21] that's why videos of people on VR
[12:23] headsets are so fun to watch because
[12:25] people will literally jump into the wall
[12:28] thinking they've entered into a
[12:29] boundless sphere I remember the very
[12:31] first time and I think the only time I
[12:33] ever put a headset on in in what I was
[12:35] viewing you could Crouch down and when
[12:37] you crouch down there was a there was a
[12:39] table there on in my headset so at my
[12:43] age I needed a little bit of help
[12:44] getting up so I reached out to assist
[12:47] myself in getting up virtually and there
[12:50] was no table there to hold me up even
[12:51] though I could see it with my eyes but
[12:53] that's virtual reality augmented reality
[12:56] takes the existing real world
[12:58] environment takes your existing
[13:00] experience so it's this experience now
[13:02] and then it uses layers of information
[13:04] to enhance it this is a sign this is
[13:07] just the this is just the summary this
[13:08] is maybe what you'd find in a perspectus
[13:11] or someone trying to sell you their
[13:12] augmented reality technology it takes
[13:14] your natural human existence and we're
[13:16] going to augment it we're going to
[13:18] enhance it we're going to make your
[13:20] experience in this life better by using
[13:23] this intervening technology maybe it
[13:24] could be sound it could be feel it's
[13:26] like some of the uh I mean there's
[13:29] there's so many different things I
[13:30] thought of I just didn't want to get
[13:31] lost in the examples but you know what
[13:33] I'm talking about yes augmented
[13:35] reality now that's that's this on the
[13:38] science side but I I want to use this
[13:41] term and I hope that I can use it
[13:42] without losing losing anything but Faith
[13:46] enhances our real world environment amen
[13:49] so here we are in this world existing
[13:51] and we're having a physical experience
[13:53] and we're in this world but Faith
[13:55] enhances this experience by adding a
[13:57] layer of information right so if we're
[14:00] looking at something and they can put
[14:01] something and we're looking at this room
[14:03] and then we could use a technology to
[14:05] Overlay something and then it it's
[14:07] changed it it's added a character it's
[14:09] added a scene uh just like in our you
[14:12] can add a background to yourself when
[14:13] you're on a phone call and it's kind of
[14:15] augmented the reality to put you in a
[14:17] different setting and they can do it
[14:18] with a feel where you're doing something
[14:20] there can be vibration feedback to you
[14:23] um that simulates what you're watching
[14:25] and they could do it with smells now
[14:26] they do it with sounds all sorts of ways
[14:27] to make you feel that your experience is
[14:31] different than what you're experiencing
[14:32] and enhances it and it's the senses that
[14:35] augmented reality uses to be effective
[14:38] and so faith is a sense that is added to
[14:41] our existence that augments the reality
[14:44] that we're living
[14:45] in and whereas alter augmentative
[14:48] reality uses man-made sensory
[14:50] information Faith uses Divine
[14:52] information or mankind want through
[14:55] technology can impose something into the
[14:57] scene um add something to your
[14:59] experience to seemingly enhance it and
[15:01] it's man that has to do that therefore
[15:03] creating uh not necessarily something
[15:05] real but some uh false enhancement it's
[15:09] not authentic I was going to use maybe a
[15:10] title of authentic reality it's really
[15:12] not authentic but it's been augmented
[15:14] just as the world uses man-made sensory
[15:17] inputs to enhance their experience God
[15:20] provides us with sensory input that
[15:23] augments our physical
[15:27] experience augment means to increase or
[15:30] to enhance originally the earlier uses
[15:34] of the word in its atmology means to
[15:35] become more severe or to make larger in
[15:38] numbers 32:14 it's talking about how the
[15:41] the the two and a half tribes are
[15:42] wanting to stay on the other side of the
[15:45] Jordan River and they're saying why
[15:46] would you do this and and augment yet
[15:48] the fierce anger of the Lord toward
[15:51] Israel and so why would you make it more
[15:53] severe why would you make it to become
[15:55] greater and in the New Testament the
[15:58] word auxano
[15:59] uh it's translated to grow or increase
[16:01] or to grow up and it means to augment
[16:04] and it means to increase or to become to
[16:06] become greater in Acts 12: 24 to me this
[16:10] is the most beautiful summary of the
[16:12] book of Acts the word of God grew and
[16:15] multiplied that word there grew is
[16:17] augmented the word of God was augmented
[16:20] it it increased it became greater the
[16:22] word of God grew and
[16:25] multiplied and this verse is so
[16:26] beautiful to me the word of God grew it
[16:29] it it's it augmented means it's
[16:31] increased or it's multiplied or it's
[16:33] increased and it's multiplied if we
[16:35] could have that verse still up there the
[16:37] word of God grew and multiplied it grew
[16:41] individually right because the word is
[16:42] what it is you can't add to the word you
[16:45] can't take away from the word but the
[16:47] word of God grew that means to the
[16:48] individual it's augmented it's
[16:50] increasing it's growing and it's
[16:52] multiplying corporately so to the whole
[16:55] body to everyone it's the word there's
[16:57] no more than just the word the word
[16:58] can't multiply in the sense that you
[17:00] have the word then you have the other
[17:01] word but it's the word of God grew to
[17:03] the individuals becoming more and more
[17:05] real and it's becoming more and more
[17:07] real to more people so that's how the
[17:08] word of God can grow and
[17:10] multiply and so this is the faith of the
[17:12] first church this is the original faith
[17:15] and faith is when it says the word of
[17:17] God
[17:18] augmented the word of God grew it
[17:20] augmented Faith was augmenting the
[17:22] believer's
[17:24] experience I know this is maybe a unique
[17:26] way of saying it but I think it's very
[17:27] important for us to catch this principle
[17:29] of Faith first before we try to get into
[17:32] some of the other elements of it in
[17:33] Ephesians chapter 4 we talked about how
[17:35] we need to all come into the unity of
[17:37] the faith and and and and giving these
[17:40] gifts that speak the truth it says in
[17:42] verse 15 but speaking the truth in love
[17:44] we all now may grow up into him in all
[17:47] things we all grow up we augment we
[17:51] increase into Christ in all things
[17:54] another place that is used in 1
[17:56] Corinthians chapter 3: 6 and 7 seven
[18:00] Paul says I have planted apollis watered
[18:02] but God gave the increase so then
[18:05] neither is he that planteth anything
[18:07] neither he that WTH but God that
[18:10] augments God that giveth the increase so
[18:13] this is what we mean by augment to to
[18:16] increase uh to become
[18:18] greater and and I I realized that
[18:22] there's a way that we think to augment
[18:24] it's kind of like it's uh that Faith was
[18:27] augmented and so faith faith is becoming
[18:29] greater or God is increasing but there's
[18:31] a recipient of that that faith is
[18:35] augmenting it's being added to Faith is
[18:38] increasing so it's changing something in
[18:40] John chapter 1: 50 it says Jesus
[18:44] answered and said unto him because I
[18:45] said unto thee this is just a um how
[18:49] powerful the word of God is as we looked
[18:51] at this how that he comes it says oh
[18:53] behold an Israelite and whom there's no
[18:56] guile and and he's kind of he's caught
[18:58] off guard by that and he says Nathaniel
[19:01] saying well you know behold Thou Art the
[19:04] Christ the son of the Living God and
[19:05] Jesus says because I said unto thee I
[19:08] saw thee under the Fig Tree you
[19:11] believe so notice that what he said this
[19:14] this gift of discernment awakens
[19:17] something to Nathaniel to say this is
[19:19] the Messiah this is the Messiah sign so
[19:22] clearly there's a gift there and and
[19:24] it's and it's of God because the work of
[19:26] God is to believe on him whom he ha sent
[19:28] so when this discernment Works upon this
[19:30] elect seed he now believes that this is
[19:32] the Messiah and Jesus says because I I
[19:36] you manifested this gift before you you
[19:39] believe and he says Thou shalt see
[19:41] greater things than these now why would
[19:44] he see greater things than these because
[19:47] Faith was now working in his life that
[19:50] gift of discernment awakens of Faith he
[19:52] says now he believes and because he
[19:54] believes he's going to see greater
[19:56] things so faith is the augmenting of our
[20:00] reality when you have faith you have an
[20:02] augmented reality it makes us able to
[20:05] see things that other people won't
[20:08] see in Hebrews 11:3 it says through
[20:11] faith we understand that the worlds were
[20:14] framed by the word of God so things
[20:16] which are seen were not made of things
[20:19] which do appear now how is it that we
[20:22] understand I I broke this down in my
[20:24] mind to where no matter how you read it
[20:26] it all comes back to Faith you either
[20:29] understand that through faith the worlds
[20:30] were framed or through faith you
[20:32] understand regardless it comes back to
[20:34] Faith it's only by faith that you can
[20:37] understand that the worlds were framed
[20:39] by the word of God and we believe that
[20:41] it was by faith that the worlds were
[20:43] framed by the word of God and there
[20:45] conclusion so that the things which are
[20:47] seen we understand and believe by faith
[20:50] that they were not made by things which
[20:52] do appear in other words by faith we
[20:55] believe that something invisible made
[20:57] the things that are visible
[20:59] so Faith then is going beyond what can
[21:01] be seen it's going beyond the scientific
[21:03] process it's going beyond what can be
[21:05] proven it has a it reaches into
[21:07] something else and says we are all here
[21:09] and by faith I believe that we're here
[21:11] by the word of God now that does take
[21:15] Faith because you can I I believe that
[21:17] if anyone's going to be intellectually
[21:19] honest and they say that they do not
[21:21] believe in God or they're an atheist
[21:23] then and they accept science then they
[21:26] they they must if they accept science
[21:28] they must accept that it a scientific
[21:31] impossibility for something uh to come
[21:34] out of nothing right amen and so if if
[21:37] they believe in science they have to
[21:38] believe that something was already here
[21:41] before something else came and they can
[21:42] trivialize it and say well it wasn't
[21:44] something big it was something really
[21:45] small but whatever it was had to always
[21:48] be and then that's by faith we believe
[21:51] God created the heavens and the Earth as
[21:54] something invisible or unseen and Romans
[21:57] 4:7 17 speaking of Abraham it says as it
[22:00] is written I have made thee a father of
[22:02] many nations before him whom he believed
[22:05] even God who quickeneth the dead and
[22:08] calleth those things which be not as
[22:11] though they were so this is the faith of
[22:13] Abraham the father of our faith this is
[22:15] a distinct characteristic of faith can
[22:17] call things which aren't as though they
[22:20] are this is Faith it it actually say
[22:23] well there's no evidence of this or
[22:24] there's nothing showing this but faith
[22:26] says no there is something there is
[22:28] something something to it and he says he
[22:29] would he called those things which be
[22:32] not as though they were and I think it's
[22:34] beautiful how it's written here and we
[22:36] could pull this out even in the Book of
[22:38] Genesis but God said I have made thee a
[22:41] father of many
[22:43] nations it wasn't that God said it was
[22:46] the way it's written here I have made
[22:47] the so Abraham didn't take it even as a
[22:50] future promise he took it as he said he
[22:52] has then he has and that's the faith to
[22:56] believe I have made thee a father of
[22:58] many Nation ations so Abraham could say
[23:00] I am the father of many nations and call
[23:02] those things which be not as though they
[23:05] were speaking of Moses in Hebrews 11:
[23:09] 27 just looking at this uh maybe I did a
[23:12] poor job of setting this up but
[23:16] faith augments our
[23:19] reality and and I'm going to be going
[23:22] further in this and I think you'll
[23:24] understand better uh why I chose this
[23:27] phrasing of a augmented reality but it's
[23:30] through faith that we have understanding
[23:33] of how visible things got
[23:34] here faith is able to call things which
[23:37] aren't as though they are and then Moses
[23:40] by faith he forsook Egypt not fearing
[23:43] the Wrath of the king for he
[23:45] endured as seeing him who is
[23:49] invisible so this is what faith is able
[23:51] to do Faith Moses by faith saw Christ
[23:55] amen and it was by faith that he forsook
[23:58] Egypt and go back tonight after we go
[23:59] through this whole uh uh sermon tonight
[24:02] on augmented reality go back and read
[24:05] Hebrews chap 11 and look at Faith from
[24:07] the standpoint of something that the
[24:09] believer possessed that changed the way
[24:11] they viewed the world right and not so
[24:14] much just a an a a dogged determination
[24:18] to hold on to a particular
[24:19] outcome and I'm just I'm just going to
[24:21] hold on to it this way but it was
[24:23] something prior to that this is the
[24:25] first principle I believe of faith is it
[24:27] changes the way that you view the world
[24:28] like faith is not just well I'm going to
[24:30] hold on to this idea that if God heals
[24:32] me I'll become a Christian or that if
[24:34] God gives me this good job I'm going to
[24:35] go in the Rapture if God gives me this
[24:37] girl to marry then I know that he loves
[24:38] me you got to let go of some sort of
[24:40] idea of a faith being a particular
[24:43] outcome that's individualistic to your
[24:45] experience and that Faith first is
[24:47] something that transforms Your Existence
[24:50] in this world that's where Faith begins
[24:53] because if you haven't had that then
[24:55] you're still just a sinner who is making
[24:57] its way through the this world and can
[24:59] benefit by a momentary even an emotional
[25:02] Faith to receive healing on the platform
[25:04] and go home and your life not be a
[25:06] rearranged but when you're born again
[25:09] you begin to experience reality
[25:11] differently than anybody else does
[25:13] except another
[25:15] Christian and so this is what faith is
[25:17] it
[25:20] augments it enhances your experience by
[25:24] adding Divine information to what you're
[25:26] seeing and experiencing
[25:29] in the message perseverance brother Bram
[25:31] says faith
[25:32] finds sources that others don't
[25:35] see is that awesome Faith finds sources
[25:39] that others don't see it's why when you
[25:42] when you write papers in academics you
[25:44] have to provide
[25:45] sources well when you're Faith finds
[25:48] sources that other people can't see
[25:50] what's with all the blank spaces on your
[25:52] uh your bibliography page here well you
[25:55] got to have faith to see them
[25:56] Professor faith find sources that others
[25:59] don't see now if you don't have faith
[26:01] well then there's no need of trying to
[26:03] show it to you because faith can see it
[26:07] faith is the substance of things hoped
[26:09] for the evidence of Things Not Seen
[26:11] Faith sees what the blind people don't
[26:13] see faith is the Sixth Sense five senses
[26:17] are fine as long as they don't disagree
[26:19] with the sixth and that's a very
[26:20] important principle but the six sense is
[26:23] Faith it's the substance of things hoped
[26:25] for you don't taste see taste feel smell
[26:28] or hear but you yet you know it Faith
[26:32] tells you so and it's so sure that it's
[26:35] real that it comes to you a substance
[26:39] not just imagination it's something you
[26:42] have now this it's
[26:46] uh we by using it as a sense and we
[26:49] could use different examples and maybe
[26:51] it might be good to do this at some
[26:52] point of how that brother bam even in
[26:55] the first sermon that we have recorded
[26:56] faith is a substance utilizes different
[26:58] examples to say well how do you know
[26:59] this is orange juice because you can
[27:01] taste it how do you know this a piano
[27:02] because you can hear it how do you know
[27:03] this is a Pulpit because you can feel it
[27:05] and there's ways that our senses declare
[27:07] it to us and based upon that sensory
[27:09] input we know it's something well that's
[27:12] what faith is Right Faith provides us
[27:15] sensory input and therefore we can know
[27:17] by faith something we know by Revelation
[27:20] something that God has disclosed to us
[27:22] and this now this fits right in with
[27:24] what we've been talking about in Divine
[27:26] Healing in Christ our healer he says
[27:29] faith is a substance not just an
[27:31] imagination it's something you have I
[27:33] seen people come on the platform say
[27:35] brother brandom I've got all Faith well
[27:38] what are you doing up here
[27:40] then right so this is he's showing that
[27:43] this is Faith what it translates to and
[27:45] how it changes things and what it really
[27:48] is now as we read in Matthew chapter 15
[27:50] I just want to refer to this very
[27:52] quickly and how the kadite woman who was
[27:56] had a daughter who was grievously vexed
[27:57] with the Devil
[27:58] came running after him oh Lord son of
[28:01] David and the the disciples you just
[28:04] kind of ignores her he says he answers
[28:05] her not her word and I the way it's
[28:07] written in this particular place maybe
[28:09] she begins to bother the disciples and
[28:11] the disciples say hey can you get rid of
[28:12] her please and he says well I'm not sent
[28:14] but to the house of Israel the Sheep
[28:15] lost sheep of the House of Israel she
[28:17] was a
[28:18] gentile and but yet she still came and
[28:20] worshiped him and he get he's dismissive
[28:23] of her that it's not meant to take the
[28:25] children's bread and cast it to dogs and
[28:28] then she just replies true Lord yet let
[28:30] the dogs the dogs eat of the crumbs
[28:33] which fall from their master's table so
[28:36] she had a need brother bner makes
[28:38] reference to this it's very very
[28:39] powerful he says the reason why you
[28:40] don't have faith is because you you
[28:42] don't really have a need he's making
[28:44] that connection of how that you're not
[28:46] really believing because you don't have
[28:47] a need and that's why sometimes the word
[28:49] of God has to strip us down so much and
[28:51] God has to let us suffer so many things
[28:53] because we have to realize just how
[28:54] needy we are so we could come to that
[28:56] place of asking for Mercy oh God help me
[28:59] it make puts us in that
[29:00] desperation and so this brother Bram in
[29:04] the message
[29:05] perseverant this is from
[29:08] 1962 really it personally enter into
[29:11] this I think it's such an encouraging
[29:13] message for us tonight so this poor
[29:15] woman might have had many hindrances and
[29:16] he's talking about this very story here
[29:19] but her faith didn't have
[29:22] any I thought for sure someone was going
[29:24] to
[29:25] shout think about it she might have had
[29:29] some but her faith
[29:32] didn't you might have some but your
[29:34] faith
[29:35] doesn't we have many hindrances he says
[29:37] but her faith didn't have any you may
[29:39] have a lot of hindrances maybe your
[29:41] doctor says it can't happen but if
[29:43] you've got faith it don't make any
[29:45] difference what anybody else says your
[29:48] faith don't have no hindrance your faith
[29:51] sees it it's the substance of things
[29:53] hoped for the evidence of Things Not
[29:55] Seen now I want I hope I can impress
[29:57] this upon you this way that in that that
[30:00] literal example brother saying that she
[30:03] had many hindrances but her faith didn't
[30:05] this faith is
[30:06] unseen but she had many hindrances and
[30:09] what she did instead of giving all the
[30:12] credit to the hindrances she just went
[30:15] by her faith that didn't have any and
[30:18] when we experience a hindrance or
[30:20] something seems disconcerting or maybe
[30:21] there's some evidence contrary to what
[30:23] we're believing that's a hindrance but
[30:26] not to your faith
[30:28] in other words you can take something
[30:30] that is a hindrance and instead of
[30:31] applying it to your faith you can tell
[30:33] yourself and believe that faith has no
[30:36] hindrances because With God all things
[30:39] are possible but myself I have
[30:41] hindrances I have this experience I have
[30:43] this diagnosis what the doctor's telling
[30:45] me brother brand one place says it may
[30:47] be true but that doesn't matter to Faith
[30:51] amen says your faith sees it it says
[30:54] substance of things hop for the evidence
[30:56] of Things Not Seen so
[30:58] in that way what I want is I I want to
[31:00] tap into what my faith sees I'm allowing
[31:03] way too much sensory input from all
[31:05] these other things and it's keeping me
[31:07] from being able to lock into that
[31:08] channel where all of a sudden it's like
[31:09] I see it too I see it too I believe
[31:12] it and that's what brother Brown Excuse
[31:15] me that's what Jesus remarks at in
[31:17] Matthew
[31:18] 15:28 oh woman great is thy faith be
[31:23] unto thee even as thou Wilt the faith
[31:26] was greater than all the the
[31:29] hindrances great this great faith is
[31:31] attributed to this Gentile woman oh what
[31:33] a great
[31:34] faith that she would uh that she would
[31:37] believe despite all the
[31:39] obstacles she cries out to him he
[31:41] ignores her goes to the disciples they
[31:44] get fed up with her and tell Jesus to
[31:45] send her away she makes it to him again
[31:48] and begins to worship he says you're
[31:49] nothing but a dog you can't get anything
[31:50] for me she says well I can get the
[31:53] crumbs what would do that
[31:56] faith brother br says in the message
[31:59] perseverance again this is a just a
[32:00] little bit different than the ones we've
[32:02] read
[32:03] before uh and he says this little woman
[32:06] she was a Greek and a
[32:08] sarapan and she had heard about the fame
[32:11] of Jesus now how how does faith come by
[32:14] hearing hearing of the word she had
[32:16] heard of him and you know she might have
[32:19] had a lot of things to hinder her by her
[32:21] being a Greek so just there whatever it
[32:25] was in her life there was a lot of
[32:26] reasons why she could have been hindered
[32:28] a lot of reasons why she could have just
[32:30] accepted yeah sorry didn't mean to
[32:31] bother the rabbi go away he says faith
[32:34] cometh by hearing we know that and she
[32:37] had a lot of things to hinder her but
[32:40] Faith finds a source no other one knows
[32:42] anything
[32:44] about faith finds this source that no
[32:46] one can explain it it's something that
[32:49] you know others can't see it but Faith
[32:53] sees it Faith sees that where the
[32:56] natural eye doesn't see it but the
[32:58] inside eye sees that thing I I cannot
[33:03] emphasize enough that this is just
[33:04] simply what faith is there's a lot of
[33:08] ways that we could supplement that
[33:10] definition a lot of examples we could
[33:11] give there's a lot of other scriptures
[33:13] we could use um even a lot of statements
[33:16] and quotes and even tremendous sayings
[33:18] by other people that kind of tell us
[33:20] what faith is and it's essentially
[33:22] amplifying this thought that it's
[33:24] something that is in you that is very
[33:26] very real that senses things other
[33:28] people can't see I was going to uh touch
[33:31] on it
[33:32] tonight a couple attributes about faith
[33:35] how that faith has to have something
[33:36] that it's towards so there has to be
[33:38] some something that's placed in but it
[33:40] also has something has to have something
[33:42] against
[33:43] it and so there could be all sorts of
[33:45] things against this Faith but Faith sees
[33:47] what everyone else can't see finds a
[33:50] source that no one knows anything about
[33:51] finds the source that no one can explain
[33:53] sees what others can't see am what the
[33:56] natural eye does doesn't see it's an
[33:58] inside eye that sees that thing that's
[34:01] what faith is now if you if your faith
[34:04] isn't seeing anything in particular now
[34:06] that's the characteristics of it though
[34:09] to see things that you can't see in
[34:12] second Kings chapter 6 and the first
[34:14] eight verses it tells the story of some
[34:16] of the prophets and how that one was
[34:18] chopping wood I think it was and the an
[34:20] axe head flew into the the the water and
[34:23] they went and told Elisha Elisha we lost
[34:25] an AE and he says tell me about where
[34:27] iten happened and he chops off a branch
[34:28] and throws it on the water and what does
[34:30] the ax head do
[34:34] floats what's the science in that right
[34:37] and so I I I wanted to read the whole
[34:39] chapter but we could just make reference
[34:40] to it real quick this is just kind of
[34:42] demonstrating this life of faith that
[34:43] Elisha had where something that's
[34:46] contrary to science there's no
[34:48] scientific explanation why doing that
[34:49] would cause the ax head to float and and
[34:51] I'm sure that it's probably been done
[34:53] where science has tried to come up with
[34:55] a hypothesis that if the way of the
[34:57] branch was such and such and if it was
[34:59] thrown at such Force if it had plunged
[35:01] faster than the axe head was going down
[35:03] it could have caused this reverse
[35:05] propulsion and caus the axe head to
[35:07] float back up and they do that so that
[35:09] they can explain it away so that it's no
[35:11] longer Faith but we don't need the
[35:13] explanation we just believe that an axe
[35:16] had floated that's just the end of it we
[35:17] believe that that can happen now here's
[35:20] the the next story is this in verse 8
[35:22] then the king of Syria wared against
[35:24] Israel and took counsel with his servant
[35:26] saying in such and such a place shall be
[35:28] my Camp so this is his private counsel
[35:31] to his servants and the man of God sent
[35:33] unto the king of Israel saying beware
[35:35] that thou pass not such a place for
[35:37] thither the syrians are come down and
[35:39] the king of Israel sent to that place
[35:41] which the man of God told him and warned
[35:43] him of and saved himself there not once
[35:46] nor twice therefore the heart of the
[35:49] King was sore troubled for this thing
[35:52] and he called his servant so you kind of
[35:53] pick up what's going on the king of
[35:54] Syria is Waring against Israel and he
[35:56] whenever he picked his camp Camp King of
[35:58] the Israel would just avoid it they were
[36:00] always get out of the way of trouble he
[36:02] says will you not show me which one of
[36:04] us which of us is for the king of
[36:06] Israel and one of his servants said none
[36:09] my Lord oh King but Elisha the prophet
[36:11] that is in Israel tell the king of
[36:13] Israel the words that thou speakest in
[36:15] thy bed chamber and he said go and spy
[36:18] where he is that I may send and fetch
[36:20] him and it was told him saying behold
[36:22] he's in Doan therefore sent he thither
[36:25] horses and chariots and a great H and it
[36:28] came by night and compassed the city
[36:31] about these are real chariots real
[36:32] horses this is a real king this is a
[36:35] real Siege right so that morning the
[36:38] next morning verse 15 and when the
[36:39] servant of the man of God this is
[36:41] Elisha's servant was risen early and
[36:43] gone forth Behold a host compassed the
[36:47] city both with horses and chariots and
[36:50] this is what the servant sees when he
[36:51] walks outside and a servant said unto
[36:54] him alas my master what shall we do now
[36:56] what caused this consternation what
[36:58] caused him to cry out the fact that he
[37:00] went outside and not only did his eyes
[37:02] behold an army but his understanding
[37:05] told him this ain't good right right he
[37:08] knew this is the wrong Army these are
[37:10] the wrong dudes I'm in I'm in trouble
[37:12] we're in trouble and so he said went to
[37:14] the prophet and said what shall we do
[37:16] and he answered this is Elijah's answer
[37:18] fear not for they that be with us are
[37:21] more than they that be with them now
[37:24] what did I just wonder I wonder if the
[37:26] servant was a little sarcastic
[37:28] one two one two one two I saw more than
[37:31] two out there Elisha I don't think you
[37:34] understand this isn't a solder on the
[37:36] hill there's more he says no no there's
[37:38] more with us he said who who's the US
[37:40] you're talking about what you have a rat
[37:41] in your pocket who are you talking about
[37:43] there's got to there's more on that Hill
[37:45] than us in this tent and he says this
[37:48] and this and you I know you're familiar
[37:49] with this and Elisha prayed and said
[37:51] Lord I pray thee open his eyes that he
[37:55] may see
[37:57] now what what was Elijah what did Elijah
[38:00] have Elisha rather have to see that that
[38:04] this young servant didn't
[38:06] have he said I open his eyes that he may
[38:09] see and the Lord opened the eyes of the
[38:10] young man and he saw and what did he see
[38:14] beheld behold the mountain was full of
[38:16] horses and Chariots of Fire round about
[38:20] Elisha so the enemy had come and set
[38:22] itself against Elisha the servant comes
[38:24] out by natural eyesight in his h human
[38:28] only a human existence that's powered by
[38:30] the five senses of the body and the five
[38:32] senses of the mind he goes out there and
[38:34] sees this Army what he sees with his
[38:36] eyes he can now imagine with his mind
[38:38] that this is certain death for him and
[38:39] Elijah and he says Elijah Elisha help us
[38:42] help us what are we going to do he says
[38:43] oh there's more with us than with
[38:48] them and so he has to pray to open his
[38:50] eyes and when his eyes are open what
[38:52] does he see horse the mountain was full
[38:55] of horses and Chariots of Fire round
[38:57] about Elisha on Elisha's side so in that
[39:01] moment he's able to see what Elisha
[39:05] saw and it's not and I I believe that
[39:09] what this is this is an instance where
[39:11] he is able to see by faith that there
[39:15] were armies there was an Army with
[39:17] elishah that the natural eye couldn't
[39:19] see but God allowed those things to line
[39:23] up so that his reality was augmented to
[39:26] now when he looked at on the hill what
[39:28] was not there before but was there in
[39:32] reality right because he's the god of
[39:34] reality that realm is more real than the
[39:36] one that you or I in God allowed that
[39:39] Dimension to be imposed over the one
[39:41] that the servant was viewing and he
[39:43] augmented his reality and made him see
[39:46] that there were more with Elisha than
[39:49] was with
[39:51] Syria this is this is true and it says
[39:55] in Psalms 34:7 the the angel of the Lord
[39:58] encampeth round about them that fear Him
[40:01] and delivereth
[40:04] them this the scripture is literally
[40:08] setting forth the principle that in
[40:10] another dimension there are host that
[40:12] surround
[40:14] you in another dimension that the five
[40:17] senses cannot
[40:18] declare brother Bram goes to lyns to
[40:21] talk about the certain dimensions of
[40:23] Life Time and matter and then the fourth
[40:24] dimension he calls it a scientific
[40:26] Dimension and how it it exists it's even
[40:28] existing within this natural realm but
[40:29] it's not perceived through our five
[40:31] senses and how that science is able to
[40:33] use technology to to capture to send
[40:36] things through that medium and and pull
[40:38] things out of it and broadcast it's all
[40:40] part of the Physical Realm that we're in
[40:42] it's but it's an unseen realm there's a
[40:44] realm of faith of the supernatural that
[40:48] faith is the antenna faith is the
[40:50] receiver faith is the sense that can
[40:52] look into that and it and it it changes
[40:54] the way you view
[40:56] things and Angel the angel of the Lord
[40:58] and the host as it's often referred to
[41:00] as the angels of God are around about
[41:03] those that fear
[41:05] Him brother BR refers to the scripture
[41:07] and Christ is the mystery of God
[41:09] revealed and he says the five senses
[41:10] only contacts this
[41:12] world if you had I I trust that um it's
[41:16] only 806 I'm going at a pretty good Pace
[41:18] tonight we might be done uh before
[41:20] Culver's
[41:21] closes and he says the five senses only
[41:25] contact this world if you had no feeling
[41:28] you couldn't feel
[41:30] nothing right feelings wouldn't be
[41:33] nothing to you that would be another
[41:37] world because when he when he uses the
[41:39] scripture and he says that the angel of
[41:40] God are encamped about them that fear
[41:42] him it's in a dimension he said that the
[41:44] five senses do not declare and so the
[41:47] five senses not declaring it it's
[41:49] another world so he's going to just
[41:51] hammer down on this line that if you had
[41:53] no feeling the world the world it's
[41:55] another world where there's feeling it's
[41:57] a whole another dimension he says you
[41:58] know nothing about it if you had no
[42:00] sight what would you what you would look
[42:02] at would be another world you'd know
[42:04] nothing about it so these five senses
[42:06] are the only thing that God lets us
[42:08] loose to now there's another what sense
[42:12] called another one called Faith but by
[42:15] faith you walk up a ladder and finally
[42:17] you can get so high until you break into
[42:20] another world which is vision and
[42:24] there's there there's a uh there's a
[42:26] principle that brother looks at as as
[42:28] far as Faith Revelation and vision and
[42:30] which things are certain and how they
[42:32] work and and they're working in a
[42:33] completely different uh area different
[42:35] uses and different utilities but what
[42:38] he's what he's emphasizing is that sense
[42:41] is what opens up a world to you and if
[42:43] you couldn't see the world of sight is a
[42:45] whole new world to you if you couldn't
[42:46] feel the world of feeling is a whole new
[42:48] world to you if I could just put it this
[42:49] way it's all of the senses as we're able
[42:52] to use them that provide to us the
[42:54] reality that we exist within and some
[42:57] who's colorblind looks at all the same
[42:59] things that you look at but to them it's
[43:01] a world that is without color or certain
[43:04] color
[43:05] spectrums and and when and and so
[43:07] there's there's if whenever that sight
[43:09] is given to them to see the color it
[43:11] changes the world for them and does so
[43:14] in a dramatic way in certain instances
[43:16] and so he's saying that these five
[43:18] senses it's another one that you can on
[43:21] this faith can take you to a place where
[43:23] you break into another world which is
[43:25] Vision there you can see just just like
[43:27] if you never knew what it was you were
[43:29] feeling with your sense of feeling never
[43:31] seen it then your eyes come open and you
[43:33] could see it it would all be it would be
[43:36] all a mystery to that person who never
[43:39] could see it'd be a mystery to him but
[43:42] yet that's it so if everyone here was
[43:45] blind and that was just with that our
[43:47] shared experience we had this common
[43:49] experience of being blind and then all
[43:50] of a sudden someone was given sight to
[43:52] be able to see that's a different world
[43:54] now for that
[43:55] person and it's a to those who remain
[43:59] blind that's what faith is it's another
[44:02] sense that opens up another world so
[44:05] when Paul says we read this last time in
[44:06] Galatians 2:20 I am crucified with
[44:08] Christ nevertheless I
[44:11] live yet not I but Christ liveth in me
[44:15] and the life which I now live in the
[44:17] flesh I live by the faith of the Son of
[44:20] God who loved me and gave himself for
[44:24] me now the faith of the son of God
[44:27] first and primarily changes the way that
[44:30] you view the
[44:32] world faith in God is most fundamental
[44:35] level is to accept that a price was paid
[44:37] for your sins and by faith you touch
[44:40] that sacrifice you identify yourself
[44:41] with the blood that shed on Calvary and
[44:43] that's that faith that justifying faith
[44:45] that's going to put you into fellowship
[44:47] with Christ by the new birth and and
[44:49] that's a faith that is manifested apart
[44:51] from you doing
[44:53] anything right you just by faith
[44:56] believed and in believing you felt the
[44:58] Forgiveness of sins and by faith you are
[45:01] to be B you baptized in the name of Lord
[45:02] Jesus Christ but the the Regeneration by
[45:05] the new birth that is the work of God
[45:07] and that changes except you be borned
[45:09] again you cannot see or understand the
[45:11] kingdom of God and now with an insight
[45:13] into the kingdom of God you begin to
[45:15] look at life
[45:17] differently that's what the faith of the
[45:19] Son of God is primarily at its most
[45:21] fundamental level because that's the
[45:23] faith that Jesus Christ had from his
[45:25] birth even before he did a miracle right
[45:29] so he's at 30 years old he performs his
[45:31] first first miracle but prior to that it
[45:34] was the faith of the Son of God to view
[45:36] the World Through The Eyes of the
[45:39] father I hope that makes sense to you
[45:42] that we think of faith we think of
[45:43] turning water to the wine Faith being
[45:45] able to speak my hair back into
[45:47] existence and Faith being able to grow a
[45:49] couple inches and or whatever Faith
[45:51] might want to lose 40 pounds and I I
[45:54] want real substance Faith to heal my
[45:55] back I want substance faith to claim to
[45:58] claim that job promotion and and we look
[46:00] at Faith as being something that is
[46:01] going to be used in this moment to
[46:03] conjure up a a creation of something out
[46:06] of nothing but faith on its most basic
[46:09] level if it's not working here on this
[46:12] most basic level where you begin to see
[46:14] things differently and live differently
[46:16] and have a life of faith meaning you
[46:18] just live by the faith of the Son of God
[46:21] who loved you and gave himself for you
[46:23] apart from performing any Miracles I
[46:26] just see the World differently now come
[46:29] on
[46:30] Amen brother Bram said in a man running
[46:33] from the presence of the Lord he's
[46:35] talking about Christ he says what could
[46:37] he be but that perfect Immortal God made
[46:40] flesh and dwelt Among Us nothing ever
[46:42] compared with him he lived in a world to
[46:46] himself so Paul says I live by the faith
[46:48] of the Son of God the faith of the Son
[46:51] of God put Christ in a different reality
[46:54] says he lived in a world to himself if
[46:57] you ever Ed that phrase of one of your
[46:58] kids or somebody you knew they're in a
[47:00] world of their own they march to a Beat
[47:02] Of A Different Drummer or whatever it is
[47:04] the phrase that we use because it's like
[47:05] they they just they live on their they
[47:08] kind of live in a world all their own
[47:11] but we see them right here they only
[47:13] have the same five senses that you have
[47:16] to contact this Earthly home and they
[47:18] and they they they have the same
[47:21] capacity whether it be work in certain
[47:23] measures that you know to imagine and to
[47:26] feel and to think those different ways
[47:27] that we process Humanity they're still
[47:29] the same human being with these
[47:31] sensories to to try to work their way in
[47:33] this world but now Christ when he says
[47:35] he lived in a world to himself he did
[47:38] that by
[47:39] faith not because he was mute or blind
[47:42] or lacked sens the senses of feeling or
[47:44] taste he lived in a different world
[47:46] because he had a different
[47:49] reality and now I I I don't want to
[47:51] amplify this but I just want to read it
[47:53] to you this way in John chapter 8:36
[47:57] says if the son therefore shall make you
[47:59] free you shall be free
[48:03] indeed that means if the son hath made
[48:06] you free and it makes you free you shall
[48:08] be free in reality right amen now when
[48:12] we look at ourselves and maybe you could
[48:14] think of your own testimony that in the
[48:16] moment that you were set free from the
[48:18] law of sin and death nothing external
[48:21] permanently changed unless at that
[48:23] moment something terrible happened and
[48:25] you burned yourself and had a permanent
[48:26] disfigure fing I'm just saying in that
[48:28] moment that the soul is transformed
[48:30] there's nothing external that is
[48:32] permanently
[48:33] changed is that right we could even say
[48:35] that there's those there's things that
[48:37] permanently change but there things that
[48:39] will change in
[48:40] time and things that could be reverse
[48:43] you could have somebody who a sister who
[48:45] cuts her hair gives her heart to God her
[48:46] soul is transformed in that moment
[48:48] nothing externally nothing that the
[48:50] senses could declare has been changed
[48:52] but something has changed in her soul
[48:55] and then she may begin to let her hair
[48:56] grow out and it can grow out and grow
[48:57] out and that would be the visible
[48:59] evidence of a justifying faith that only
[49:01] God could see on the inside but it's
[49:03] changed the way she sees the world it
[49:06] changed the way she sees herself changed
[49:08] the way she saw the word now her life is
[49:10] coming into Conformity with what faith
[49:12] sees and it may take some time but that
[49:15] life is going to begin to look like what
[49:18] faith
[49:19] sees but things could happen you could
[49:21] lose your hair the hair could get uh uh
[49:24] get shorter just through uh old age or
[49:26] whatever it might be but that doesn't
[49:28] change Faith amen and in that moment
[49:30] where it says if therefore if the sun
[49:32] therefore shall make you free you shall
[49:34] be free in reality though nothing may
[49:37] seem to change about your physical state
[49:39] your physical wellness your financial
[49:42] ability or even the fact that you may be
[49:43] in prison right but you are free in
[49:47] reality why because that dimension of
[49:49] God is the
[49:53] reality and when that when that Dawns on
[49:56] an individual all though they might see
[49:58] chains in the
[50:00] flesh though they may see sickness in
[50:02] the body they know in reality they're
[50:04] well in reality they're
[50:10] free the faith of the Son of God is to
[50:12] live in a different
[50:15] world now you may have already thought
[50:17] about this statement I wasn't going to
[50:18] use it till I just felt impressed later
[50:20] this afternoon just to include
[50:22] this and I just have one more statement
[50:24] to read to you besides this one
[50:27] and the message everpresent water from
[50:29] the rock we are now in Heavenly places
[50:33] we are now in the power of the
[50:34] Resurrection now remember how we use
[50:37] that to kind of show that the Ecstasy
[50:39] that Transcendent experience where B was
[50:41] trans now we're there and that's what I
[50:43] was trying to show in that last one is
[50:45] in the spirit on the Lord's day that's
[50:46] the whole of the Christian Life oh to
[50:48] live there though I'm here I have
[50:51] something else I'm operating by and I'm
[50:53] in tune with yeah we talk about getting
[50:56] in the flesh
[50:57] right we ever used that phrase before we
[50:59] get in the flesh that's when we know
[51:00] that we're we're no longer operating
[51:02] under that the we know we're no longer
[51:05] operating in harmony with the nature and
[51:07] character of the word we recognize that
[51:09] well faith is to to be sensitive to and
[51:11] to see and to perceive the nature of God
[51:14] in every
[51:15] scenario in every situation that's why
[51:17] we need to press into it pray for
[51:19] Revelation more than anything because we
[51:21] want that to be the dominant trait the
[51:22] dominant sense he says we are now in
[51:25] Heavenly places we are now in the power
[51:26] of the Resurrection if there wasn't a
[51:28] law to that Sons and Daughters of God
[51:31] would create them a world out here and
[51:33] go live a private life on it
[51:38] amen some nice bass
[51:41] waters you know he's saying it he's
[51:44] saying it and I believe it am that
[51:47] settles
[51:48] it the sons of God would create
[51:50] daughters would create them a world out
[51:52] here and go live a private life on it
[51:56] you have have the power in you to do
[51:59] it if you got a shadow of the power of
[52:01] God in you you've got power to do it God
[52:04] is omnipotent you see what I mean the
[52:06] power that's in you will make he says
[52:08] you could speak a world into existence
[52:10] and go live on
[52:12] itlu let this Dawn on you really really
[52:14] sink in you could speak a world in
[52:16] existence and go live on it Hallelujah
[52:17] there you are that's what power is in
[52:19] the church now but it's controlled by a
[52:22] law and that law is not keeping a bunch
[52:24] of Commandments it's a law of faith
[52:27] Jesus said all things are possible to
[52:28] them that believe and if you can't
[52:30] believe whatever God will lead your soul
[52:31] to believe that is yours if you can
[52:34] believe it whatever God will lead your
[52:36] soul to believe that is yours every
[52:38] place The Souls of your foot can set
[52:39] upon by faith God gives it to you amen
[52:41] it's yours you possess it if you can
[52:43] find the key to this law of faith that
[52:45] opens it to you you see what I mean the
[52:47] power is controlled by now I'll go ahead
[52:50] and finish this up but I hope you're
[52:51] really thinking spiritually about this
[52:53] the power is controlled by if you are a
[52:55] son of God you are a daughter of God
[52:58] that never leaves
[53:01] you it's with you all the time but your
[53:05] faith gets away from it but it's still
[53:08] there you can have a lot of hindrances
[53:11] but there's no hindrance to Faith your
[53:13] faith can get away from his faith but
[53:16] the power to go create another world
[53:18] speak it into existence and go live a
[53:20] private life on it is inside of you now
[53:23] that's a part of your faith but that
[53:26] power operates by the law of faith says
[53:30] whatever this key of law of faith that
[53:32] opens up to you it's got to open it up
[53:34] to you so listen if you have the power
[53:36] to create another world and go live on
[53:39] it and live a private life on it you
[53:41] have enough power to unlock a different
[53:43] reality in this world here that you're
[53:45] living in you can you can create your
[53:49] reality right here Create Your
[53:51] Atmosphere you can create something by
[53:53] this key of Faith he says whatever this
[53:55] key of faith can open up to you can open
[53:57] up to you a supernatural reality and you
[54:00] can live in a world to yourself right
[54:02] here in this
[54:04] world because that power never leaves
[54:06] you it's always
[54:10] there and so brother Bram says this in
[54:12] the message perfect Faith you can see a
[54:14] lot of these things I've been pulling
[54:15] from from perfect Faith this last few
[54:19] Services he says Jesus lived in a world
[54:22] that no one knowed
[54:23] about he said he lived in a world to
[54:26] himself self he lived in a world that no
[54:27] one else
[54:29] knew
[54:30] so was he born of a woman yes did he did
[54:35] was he was he a baby was he a toddler do
[54:38] we see him at 12 years old did he grow
[54:40] and increase in wisdom and favor
[54:42] increased in stature he ate he slept he
[54:46] wept he he suffered
[54:48] hunger he died this is a man who had all
[54:52] the senses that we have he was tempted
[54:54] in all points in like manner that we
[54:55] could be tempted this says a man if we
[54:57] could say all man but also all God and
[55:01] he was here on this Earth it wasn't a a
[55:05] messiah Messianic
[55:07] hologram all right he's here this wasn't
[55:10] augmented reality he's here we handled
[55:12] him we touched them the the writers say
[55:14] that he lived in a world that no one
[55:15] knew about he was an odd person he lived
[55:18] in a world of perfect faith and the
[55:20] perfect God in which he
[55:22] was if we lived in a perfect faith of a
[55:25] Christian that we are we'd be a Mystic
[55:27] to the world the people wouldn't
[55:29] understand us a Mystic is someone who
[55:32] claims to have insight into Mysteries
[55:33] that nobody else
[55:35] understands so a Mystic somebody who has
[55:38] some sort of spiritual Supernatural
[55:39] Insight that's not available to Ordinary
[55:41] People so they become a wonderment to
[55:43] other people and so he's using this
[55:45] phrase Mystic and so in the strict
[55:47] definition of the word that's exactly
[55:49] what a genuine born again Christian is
[55:50] to somebody who can fully appreciate
[55:53] what a Christian is you become a
[55:55] wonderment Right you become a Wonder
[55:57] because now you have insight into
[55:59] Mysteries not understood by ordinary
[56:01] people who have not been born again he
[56:03] lived in a world of perfect Faith we'd
[56:05] be a Mystic to the world if we lived by
[56:07] Perfect Faith he says the people
[56:08] wouldn't understand you you'd walk in
[56:10] the spirit what the spirit said you
[56:11] would do it whatever it forbid you you
[56:13] would not do then the people would begin
[56:15] to say you'd be a Mystic person to them
[56:18] that's the way it is to all believers
[56:19] they are a Mystic that people don't
[56:22] understand because they live in a world
[56:24] to themselves Jesus lived in a world
[56:27] that nobody else could
[56:29] touch this is the life that I now live I
[56:31] live by the faith of the Son of God he
[56:33] lived in a re he lived in this world
[56:36] with an augmented
[56:37] reality he saw things other people
[56:40] couldn't see right like when he' sit sit
[56:42] around and say well if you could have a
[56:43] superpower what would it be right don't
[56:45] we sit around like adults and as adults
[56:47] and talk about if you could have one
[56:49] superpower and mine would be naps you
[56:52] know just let me if I could just take
[56:54] naps whenever I want but there's uh this
[56:57] that's the kind of superpowers you have
[56:58] when you're 47 years old you want when
[57:00] you're 47 but this this ability of
[57:03] Christ to see things that other people
[57:06] don't see and it's not x-ray vision and
[57:09] it's not imagination but it's Faith it's
[57:11] Faith
[57:12] isight such a beautiful thing I hope
[57:14] you're catching this I hope I hope it's
[57:17] becoming more of a reality to what this
[57:19] life of faith is what a walk of faith is
[57:21] what faith is when you say it's a matter
[57:23] of Faith you're in a whole another world
[57:25] Jesus lived in a world that no one else
[57:27] could touch the disciples couldn't
[57:29] understand him when he spoke to them
[57:31] they say this when he spoke to them they
[57:33] say this and they said why you talking
[57:35] riddles why don't we don't understand
[57:37] this how could this be they weren't in
[57:39] the world that he lived in but but he's
[57:42] there you see that they they weren't in
[57:45] the world that he was living in but
[57:48] they're sleeping on the same ground
[57:50] they're sleeping under the same Stars
[57:52] they're eating the same bread they're
[57:54] they're sharing in the same physical
[57:55] experience but here he is and it could
[57:57] be said that though they're in the same
[57:59] Dimension as it were he's living in
[58:02] another
[58:03] world this is so Supernatural to
[58:06] me I we take things we take things that
[58:09] are Supernatural like ghost and and
[58:12] these other things that really can't be
[58:13] seen and and can't be experienced and we
[58:16] call them we say that they're
[58:17] Supernatural and those are the things
[58:19] that uh seem to be so fleeting uh people
[58:22] just imagine but here is God in flesh
[58:27] and a man living in a whole another
[58:30] existence while everyone else around him
[58:31] is living in a different one just
[58:33] another plane another dimension I was
[58:36] going to I was going to do it I thought
[58:38] better of it hopefully I won't think
[58:39] better of it next time because I wanted
[58:41] to get into the how brother B talks
[58:43] about we live in these different
[58:44] dimensions and he was calling us this
[58:46] could just maybe wet your appetite he's
[58:48] calling us time space time space time
[58:50] space and at the turn of the century it
[58:53] was a phrase that first entered into
[58:54] scientific language of space time right
[58:57] and they finally here I am getting into
[58:58] it and they finally took our existence
[59:01] and said that we live within uh
[59:03] physically three
[59:05] dimensions and then with Einstein's
[59:08] theory of relativity he introduces a
[59:09] fourth one and it creates this
[59:13] four-dimensional existence that
[59:15] everything that has physical existence
[59:17] exists within space and that's that
[59:20] threedimensional space and then you add
[59:22] this fourth dimension of time and this
[59:24] is science now grappling with with the
[59:26] human existence that exist within space
[59:29] and time and you can move within space
[59:32] but you can't go backward in time and
[59:34] this is kind of what the theory of
[59:35] relativity is it's all really beautiful
[59:36] stuff it's wonderful reading if you want
[59:38] to if you want me to recommend some uh
[59:40] books for you don't ask but um there
[59:44] it's it's really just fascinating
[59:45] because this is scientist grappling with
[59:48] this reality and trying to make sense of
[59:51] how why you might perceive something
[59:53] differently than I do and it's all based
[59:56] based upon where you are in time and
[59:58] where you are spatially to one person
[1:00:00] well I saw this another person I see
[1:00:02] that and the theory of relativity is
[1:00:03] trying to resolve some of these things
[1:00:05] and they're just theories but they break
[1:00:07] human existence down into four different
[1:00:08] dimensions but now there's a whole
[1:00:10] different one there's a whole another
[1:00:13] dimension that now takes the one that
[1:00:15] we're living in and can wrap it all up
[1:00:18] into another existence I'm here in time
[1:00:21] I'm here in space I'm within the same
[1:00:23] three-dimensional existence in physics
[1:00:25] of everyone else I'm living
[1:00:26] chronologically in time but I've entered
[1:00:29] into a Heavenly realm and I'm living in
[1:00:32] another world right here on
[1:00:35] Earth see he lived that's it what they
[1:00:38] weren't in the world that he lived in
[1:00:40] they couldn't understand him nobody
[1:00:41] could understand him and so when a man
[1:00:43] lives by faith and walks by faith I mean
[1:00:45] substance Faith he is isolated from the
[1:00:48] entire world and becomes a new creature
[1:00:50] in Christ amen remember the emphasis in
[1:00:53] the the first part old things are passed
[1:00:55] away all all things are passed away
[1:00:56] behold All Things become
[1:00:58] new it's a it's it's meaning that now
[1:01:01] there's something so significant that
[1:01:03] has transformed
[1:01:05] everything you can say I I've been going
[1:01:07] to church my whole life but now that I'm
[1:01:09] born again it's like a new
[1:01:11] experience I've been listening to the
[1:01:13] message my whole life but now that I'm
[1:01:15] born again it's like I'm hearing the
[1:01:16] voice for the first time come on
[1:01:18] somebody that's exactly what it was
[1:01:19] that's how was behold all things became
[1:01:22] new you say well there still was smoking
[1:01:24] now your attitude towards it changed now
[1:01:26] well there was this drink and your
[1:01:27] attitude towards it changed all these
[1:01:29] different things everything is new now
[1:01:30] because you look at it from a different
[1:01:34] realm says we
[1:01:36] couldn't he was isolated in any man who
[1:01:39] has substance faith is isolated from the
[1:01:41] entire world and becomes a new creature
[1:01:42] in Christ now how can you be isolated
[1:01:44] from the entire world unless something
[1:01:46] has taken you and changeed the way that
[1:01:48] you interact within
[1:01:50] it cuz now when you see something your
[1:01:53] reality has been augmented amen and so
[1:01:55] you look at something and other people
[1:01:57] can't see it but by faith you see it
[1:02:01] that's why if you can begin to let this
[1:02:03] you can if you could let this become the
[1:02:05] seed of Faith think about what it grows
[1:02:06] into saints that if my faith is first
[1:02:10] just viewing things differently my faith
[1:02:12] first is living in a realm in a totally
[1:02:15] different world I'm thinking differently
[1:02:16] I'm listening differently I'm feeding on
[1:02:18] different things and that's where we
[1:02:19] start where does it Grow from there am
[1:02:24] we it's as if we start on the outside
[1:02:26] why I just don't feel like I have much
[1:02:27] faith I just don't feel like I have much
[1:02:28] faith that God would let me walk on
[1:02:29] water than I'd
[1:02:30] believe right and you're you're get
[1:02:33] you're getting it over into a realm to
[1:02:34] where it begins with this different
[1:02:36] world you live in says now you're
[1:02:39] getting into bride
[1:02:40] material you're getting into rapturing
[1:02:43] condition now think this is what
[1:02:45] rapturing faith
[1:02:48] is just skip a few statements and go to
[1:02:50] the next slide he says now you're coming
[1:02:53] into perfect Faith perfect Perfection
[1:02:56] that cannot fail that faith never fails
[1:03:00] yes he was a Mystic to them with his
[1:03:02] perfect faith and so is it now that
[1:03:06] those who have perfect Faith are a
[1:03:08] Mystic to
[1:03:10] others how do you become a Mystic to
[1:03:13] others because you have Vision that
[1:03:16] other people don't have you have Insight
[1:03:19] that other people don't have you see
[1:03:21] things that other people don't see now I
[1:03:24] realize in this day and age there's
[1:03:25] going to be things we see and we believe
[1:03:26] that the world is going to make fun of
[1:03:28] and going to mock going to criticize
[1:03:30] going to make it very very hard as we
[1:03:32] continue this life to maintain the
[1:03:34] convictions that we have but when it's
[1:03:36] faith when it's a matter of Faith you
[1:03:38] can't deny it any more than you could
[1:03:39] deny your physical existence
[1:03:43] now why because that's what this Faith
[1:03:45] becomes it becomes a a union of another
[1:03:48] reality to now I only look at this life
[1:03:51] through faith now there's times when my
[1:03:54] faith gets away from that
[1:03:56] faith and I lean more to the the my
[1:03:59] senses of the imagination and conscience
[1:04:01] and memory reason and affection I'm
[1:04:03] going more by all this other sensory
[1:04:05] input and I've kind of let this stagnate
[1:04:07] a little bit that's because I've I've
[1:04:09] taken I'm no longer letting Faith
[1:04:12] augment my reality do you understand
[1:04:13] what I'm saying I'm dropping down a
[1:04:15] little bit and what I need to do is
[1:04:17] through prayer and through
[1:04:18] sanctification have my life picked back
[1:04:21] up into that perch where I can now begin
[1:04:23] to see things again from a faith persp
[1:04:25] perspective things start happening in
[1:04:27] life we get a little bit discouraged we
[1:04:28] start despairing about our relationships
[1:04:30] we start despairing about our health we
[1:04:32] start despairing about our job why does
[1:04:33] that happen because we kind of get let
[1:04:35] our faith get away from this and we
[1:04:37] start living in this other realm and to
[1:04:39] come back up into a realm of Faith isn't
[1:04:42] necessarily to say thus sayith the Lord
[1:04:44] I'm going to be healed thus sayith the
[1:04:45] Lord I'm going to get a new job but it's
[1:04:47] to see things from such a complete
[1:04:49] different perspective that those things
[1:04:51] don't even really matter
[1:04:54] anymore you're living in a totally new
[1:04:57] world well why aren't you worried about
[1:04:59] another rebate why aren't you worried
[1:05:00] about another government handout why
[1:05:01] aren't you worried about the price of
[1:05:02] cryptocurrency right now I'm looking at
[1:05:04] things differently
[1:05:05] buddy you should you should have your
[1:05:08] reality
[1:05:09] augmented that's what you need you need
[1:05:11] to have your reality augmented well how
[1:05:12] do I get it what do I pay for what
[1:05:13] should I upgrade my system to you need
[1:05:15] to get born
[1:05:17] again then it becomes a matter of Faith
[1:05:20] praise the Lord oh it's been good to be
[1:05:22] in church tonight love you very very
[1:05:25] much thank you for your attention
[1:05:27] tonight could we stand together
