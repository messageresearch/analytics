TRANSCRIPT
========================================
genesis chapter 13 verse 11 says then lot chose him all the plain of jordan and lot journeyed east and they separated themselves the one from the other abram dwelled in the land of canaan and lot dwelt in the cities of the plain and pitched his tent towards sodom but the men of sodom were wicked and sinners before the lord exceedingly reading this portion is a part of my text because i just want to kind of enter this into the record as it were by reading it now and maybe make reference to it but i want this to this image to really stand out to us today and the lord said unto abram after that lot was separated from him this becomes a critical um qualifier or condition that after lot was separated now god's gonna speak to him in this manner and would not have done so until uh until he had separated brother ram teaching us that god left him alone until he stayed away from him he didn't come and visit him in this way until he had separated god speaking lift up now thine eyes and look from the place where thou art northward and southward and eastward and westward for all the land which thou seest to thee will i give it and to thy seed forever we realized that he would have looked out upon the very place that lot chose and so abraham is assured that though you may not possess it now there is a time that it will be given to you and so there was no regret or loss or jealousy any enmity that he would have and i will make thy seed as the dust of the earth so that if a man can number the dust of the earth then shall thy seed also be numbered arise walk through the land and the length of it and in the breadth of it for i will give it unto thee then abram removed his tent and came and dwelt in the plane of memory which is in hebron and built there an altar unto the lord the desire god would bless this word which we've read you can take your seats today i believe this is part 13 of supreme faith revealed in abraham and just i'm going to jump right into it really looking at where we were connecting where we were last sunday though we went into in greater detail wednesday night we're kind of looking at the aspect of abraham's journey being connected to adam's fall and how there's a there's a mystery that's hidden those first four chapters of genesis that's tied to the life and calling of abraham and i personally had been studying uh quite a bit on different aspects of the garden of eden and the city jerusalem naturally to israel and the new jerusalem spiritually in the bride and then literally to come in the eighth day and in the eternities and uh seeing how these themes were connected and i had thought in my heart just in the the depth of things that i was looking at being inspired by and being quickened to me and certainly excited about um i had felt in my heart that yesterday was going to be an easy day getting ready for service because for weeks these things had just been compiling and then yesterday morning it was just it was dead to me and i was like i don't like this i'm not writing a paper i'm not giving a speech so material means nothing it has to be anointed it has to be quickened and really just i wrestled all day long in just trying to find the channel and god opened up something to me that was part of it's been also stunning at the same time on the particular aspect in abraham's life which is very pronounced in the message of the hour of separation from lot to me i viewed it in the sense that it was this is a significant circumstance and it's very important uh to recognize and i thought well it would be worthy of maybe more attention than how i was feeling led uh or worthy of its own service in a way and i kind of was putting it way down the road in terms of looking at the subject but god uh had been answering the question to me of why why separate from law what was the what was the real purpose in that and we even posed the question last week why did he have to leave his family why did he have to separate from lot and we recognized that once he did and i'll just kind of get into it now well i'll just say that the lord has given me direction i'm not worried anymore and the lord just came on the scene and really focused me in on a particular thing that we'd been studying on and just amplified it and i just felt like it was anointed for this morning and so we're leaving some of the themes of wanting to really look at the garden of eden and what it represented and how abraham's life is the beginning of the foundation of bringing that and raising that back up and just identify how that when we were looking at abraham being separated from lot it reproduced the image that existed after the fall and this is answering the question well why did god separate him from family from his kindred from his country and then even from his family because god wanted to produce this particular image and in genesis chapter 3 verse 23 it says therefore the lord god sent him forth from the garden to till the ground from whence he was taken so adam being separated from the garden of eden as he walks out he walks shoulder to shoulder with his wife and we see man and woman leaving the garden moving towards death that's the image that we have man and a woman one man one woman leaving the garden no children as of yet a broken promise going forth out of the garden eden and we know that they're headed towards death so that's that's the image that we have of abraham and sarah as they come out of babylon and as they're traveling and then once god separates them from lot we see a man and a woman uh without children and really just ordained to death this is their lot in life they're going to come to a grave eventually but it also brings back the image of one man and one woman over under a covenant that existed just prior to the fall so he had the image of a man and his wife and that exists after the fall thrust out of the garden driven away and the way kept by these cherubim and it's uh they're banished from the garden of god we see this this image but i want to consider that also abraham and sarah are also reflecting the image that would have existed just prior to the fall and it says in verse 25 of chapter two kind of the closing words of the creation and the positioning of man in the garden and it's the kind of the last glimpse we get before we're introduced to the serpent who's the most subtle beast in the field it says and they were both naked genesis chapter 2 verse 25 and i haven't provided these scriptures and some of these statements i'm going to use here in a moment on the slideshow so don't think that brother john is lost i did not include these because i wanted to um i guess i just wanted you to look at me while i read these but i just felt like if you could just listen to what i'm saying i'm not going to maybe be dissecting these in great detail i just wanted to kind of use these in the foundation but it says in genesis chapter 2 verse 25 and they were both naked the man and his wife and were not ashamed now kind of a very peculiar scripture maybe if we would consider it in modern language or modern condition but this closes the scenes of god's perfect eden and this this garden of eden and we could spend so much time just rehearsing the perfection that existed but the man and the woman are existing in the garden of eden the garden of god this place of delight this paradise and they've been given a perfect promise and this perfect promise has been given by a perfect god and they're living with perfect love and it's the perfection of perfection and this is are these are the circumstances that the man and the woman are existing in and it's important to note that it's from perfection in perfect conditions that mankind fell and we and i think we realize that and it's part of the narrative it's part of what we accept but here they are in the perfection of perfection a perfect god with the perfect promise a perfect covenant perfect conditions everything around them was perfect but yet they fell from that condition and so as you would just read right from verse 25 into genesis chapter 3 it details the circumstances under which mankind fell from god's perfection this is where we're just we're identifying how the um there's this myth there's a hidden mystery in these chapters that's connected to and tied to abraham and so if you look at the circumstances of the fall in verse 4 genesis chapter 3 verse 4 it says and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die really there's a more more to the conversation that was held but this is a clearly a contradiction against god's word certainly he lies about the motives of god and he says because god knows the day you eat you're going to become enlightened and become his gods and no good from evil and suggesting that god is withholding good from the woman but it's in this statement you shall not surely die that therein is a lie it's just one word god said you shall die but now satan is contradicting the word and he he says you shall not die and so we read in genesis chapter 3 and we see that the fall is represented by the act of eating but we know that there's more that has transpired and it's just symbolic of a natural act but the the language that is used whether it be in the conversation that caused eve to believe a lie and then perverted her perception of the fruit to believe that it was good for food and to make one wise it represents an eve it represents the wrong conception the woman receiving the wrong thought receiving a lie and then it produces the act and so there's the wrong conception in heart and then there there's a wrong conception in body uh that produces uh the the what we would call the serpent seed or a hybrid blood but the original sin it produces the act of the original sin and the fallout from it it's all represented in this act of eating but notice some of these statements that brother branham makes about this he says it was one word that caused the whole mess to come eve disbelieved one word of god in the first of the bible one word caused the trouble that's this this interaction of the devil's lie causing eve to receive it and to believe it and he says it's just one word one word disbelieved and it caused trouble then he says one little word is what taken us in all this trouble i want you to kind of recognize that the emphasis on trouble and then he puts it in this light not disbelieve it but just misplace it in other words it wasn't an utter rejection of the whole thing it's just one part misplaced eve just had satan eve just had satan to miss just give her a reason so eve just had satan give her a reason that's all she needed now think about that it's not uh it's not that you would reject it in its entirety but just give you a reason not to receive it just give you a reason maybe just to believe it's not for you just give you a reason to think that it's not this way or that way all he had to do was just give her a reason and he says it's take it's what's given us all this trouble he says in another place eve questioned one little phase of god's word and what did it do caused all this trouble that we have numerous statements over and over and over again showing that it was in this in this act and this wrong conception that brings forth all the chaos we know all the sorrow we know all the misery we know all the trouble that we have all the conflict all the strife is derived from this this moment of this wrong conception and paul says in romans chapter 5 verse 12 wherefore as by one man's sin entered into the world and death by sin so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned i would love to take time to amplify this but i know i'm looking at a group of message believers who are well taught and and i believe that there would be a benefit in the exercise of amplifying this principle in scripture but we know that sin is unbelief there's a way that we look at sin and recognize that there's certain attributes of sin or all unrighteousness is sin but yet there is a but the ultimate sin really is disbelieving and it is unbelief and you can substantiate that by scripture and we'll touch on it in a moment just briefly but it's it's by by sin as one man's sin through as by one man's sin enter into the world and then death by sin so it's through the the through the fall in the garden that sin enters in unbelief enters in and then because of unbelief there is death and i want you to recognize that sin being unbelief and it it leads to death so this is if you want to die just disbelieve you want to remain in death just disbelieve sin is unbelief and now so there is a um maybe just a in my mind just to catch where i'm at we have adam and the woman represent as one man and his wife with a promise now thrust out of the garden of eden under a broken covenant and then there's um we come back and we see that even prior to the fall there was one man and one woman and so these things that i i want you to begin to consider is this points the fact that eve disbelieving brought trouble and through her disbelief sin entered and it brought death it points to another element that god is showing in abraham's separation from lot i wanted to i think in my mind i wanted to maybe do it a little bit different order but we'll do it this way that god is now in this we can see and recognize some a principle that god was wanting to establish in separating him from lot and the separation that god has portrayed relates to the sin in the garden of eden now i want you to ponder that so you can say well this is my thesis statement this is what i'm what i wanted to establish is that when god separates abraham from lot he is portraying something that was taking place in the garden of eden it's it it relates to the sin in the garden of eden so let's look at genesis chapter 13 verse 5 and i believe this is where my some of my slides begin genesis chapter 13 uh i want to read to i believe i'll be reading verses 5 to 13. but we'll kind of maybe go through it piece by piece here and lot also which went with abraham we identified prior that god said get away from your family but from the very moment that abraham began to journey his dad goes with them and lot goes with them he leaves his dad but lot goes with them goes down into egypt lot must have went with him because when he comes out lot's still with them and now comes this now comes the uh the scene and lot also which with abraham abram had flocks and herds and tents so lot now has accumulated a lot of resources a lot of servants and animals and possessions and the land was not able to bear them that they might dwell together this is peaceably and to be cohesive for their substance was great both of them both abram and lot so that they could not dwell together notice that there's it's just not working out all these cattle all these herdsmens all the flocks all the tents um they're in this land or this area and they're not harmonizing it says and there was strife between the herdmen of abram's cattle and the herdman of lot's cattle and the canaanite and the perizzite dwelled then in the land so you could say wow it was they're having conflict with one another but there's also conflict outside of the two of them listen we have enough conflict with the world right we have enough conflict in the job we have enough conflict with with people that we're distantly associated with and then we have conflict very close to us within family relations and conflict that becomes very near our house you can say well there's canaanite and parasite that made it difficult enough for abram but now there's conflict there near him within his family through lot and his herdsmen and the cattle and so abram recognizes this as the bible says there was strife and then abram recognizes this and abram said unto lot let there be no strife i pray thee between me and thee in between my herdman and thy heardman for we be brethren. notice that one could say well it was just the herdmen that were fighting well if that's where it began that's not where it ended because that naturally escalated to a conflict between abram and lot and it was not it would be natural that there could be conflict between servants and other family members and and this conflict of resources and all these different things and ultimately it would spill out into the relationship that abram had with lot and so lot recognizes that let's not have strife between you and i or between our herd men and so this to me is important to recognize that here when abram begins to speak this is our introduction to lot because to this point we just know that he's there but we don't know anything else about him other than maybe we could ascertain that he was either really dependent upon abram he was a good follower or he was a leech or he recognized the potential in abram or maybe he heard the promise we don't know exactly why lot keeps hanging around but to this point we just know he's there kind of in the shadows wherever abraham goes but now we're being introduced to his character now we are we recognize in our introduction to lot is he's causing abraham trouble i want you to recognize that part that now when we're introduced to lot and we begin to recognize the influence that he is having or the impact that he has in abraham's life he's causing trouble because the bible says that there was strife between the herd men abram said let there not be strife between you and i that means contention that means there was some sort of competition among the among the herdsmen competition among resources there was competition between abraham and lot and when the word strife is used it speaks of a provoking so lot's presence and his actions and his activities as they were very near abram were provoking abraham into certain feelings he said let not there be strife abraham is experiencing this maybe conflict and he's experiencing strife and he's experiencing this striving and maybe even a competition and saying well isn't there enough for us here and why does he do this and why does he do that and so there's this conflict that abraham begins to experience this is our introduction to lot he's causing trouble and brother brahm says as long as as long as lot hung around they had trouble recognize this characteristic then of lot he causes trouble and remember what began when eve disbelieved trouble now let's continue in verse 9 abram continue and let the not there be strife he says is not the whole land before thee separate thyself i pray thee from me if thou will take the left hand then i will go to the right if thou orth i'll depart to the right hand then i will go to the left i want you to recognize this abraham is bringing a separation his it's abraham's focus on the word that causes the separation but notice it causes lot to separate abram is actually kind of bringing abraham's faith is what forces the issue of separation and he says all right lot you go and wherever you go i will take the opposite it wasn't so much that abraham tried to pack up his stuff and move and pack up his stuff and get away and in the middle of night everybody be quiet we're leaving he's not going to know where we are he just he he said why don't you go and wherever you go i'll do the opposite and i so i want you to recognize there was something within abraham's stand in his conviction where he forces the issue and by deciding and recognizing what the word of god called him to do it causes lot himself to separate it's the shock that pulls away the seed can do nothing but stand in the position that it's placed and stand according to the word of god but it's abraham's faith that forces the issue and so he says you go left i'll go right you go north i'll go south you just choose because we can't keep hanging around i need to separate and we recognize that that was abraham obeying the word that was originally given to him and then as we begin to look at lot's decision it points to unrighteousness that lot in making his decision reveals more about his character remember this is our introduction to lot we want to know who this what this nephew was all about and what he stood for and what kind of person he was well when we start getting into the details his family is causing trouble his resources are causing trouble his servants are causing trouble for abraham and now when given an opportunity to separate his decision is through unrighteousness because he says let's separate in verse 10 and lot lifted up his eyes and beheld all the plain of jordan that it was well watered everywhere before the lord destroyed sodom and gomorrh now notice what what these cities represent in our understanding at the time they would have existed with this great beauty that you would have been in all of the cities and there would have been a an attraction and allure in terms of their amenities and their resources and where they were planted and and how beautiful it was even to the extent that god inspires moses to say even as the garden of the lord like the land of egypt as thou comest unto zoar it's describing something very fertile and verdant and very rich with minerals and access to water and and it would have been a very abundant place to live and even the bible identifies that this is the way it was before god destroyed it so there's some fallout consequence and there's there's death that resides in the land and it's not as beautiful today as it would have been then but this is not looking at it and the bible wants god wants you to recognize that lord is choosing sodom and gomorrah it's even it but it's beauty it has some sort of connection and relationship to the garden which has been lost to men but notice how it continues then lot chose him all the plain of jordan and lot journeyed east it's a lot of a lot of principles as it relates to him journeying east says and they separated themselves the one from the other there comes the separation and abram dwelled in the land of canaan and lot dwelled in the cities of the plain and pitched his tent towards sodom this is where the separation came now lord is clearly in sodom abraham dwells in canaan he's more in the wilderness he separated out from this plain of jordan because he said he saw all the plane and he chose him all the plane and this is what he wanted he chose the good land the choices the best and he kind of left abraham with the leftovers and something not to be desired but then the bible wants us to recognize that what lot chose he chose he chose knowing the wickedness and the unrighteousness even as it vexed them as the bible told us it says but the men of sodom were wicked and sinners before the lord exceedingly so recognize now as lot chooses he chooses something very beautiful and very pleasing to the eye and we can see in the temptation of lot as he lifted up his eyes and saw the plains of jordan well watered like the garden of god and this is what he chooses in the temptation of lot we see the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh and the pride of life that lord has chosen according to these things is the lust of his eyes the lust of the flesh and the pride of life these are the motivating factors and causing lot to choose sodom and gomorrah and all the plains of jordan instead of choosing something else he said well why would he chose something else well there the those men of sodom were wicked and sinners before the lord exceedingly but yet he is tempted to choose it because of these different desires that he has in these forces and these influences that are working upon him and we recognize these are the same temptations in the garden of eden where eve was tested she fell to the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh and the pride of life and lot's decision is associated with unrighteousness and wickedness and it's bringing up this image of lot choosing sodom and gomorrah now at the time that doesn't seem striking but to us now in hindsight we realize this speaks something about lot's character now abraham's separation from lot was literally from family as even as abraham called him his brother we realized that he was his nephew but yet it was this was family this was a close a close relationship and abraham's separation was from family and it would it was physical and so this is literally it's family that he separates from it's literally physical where he goes you choose a place i'm going to go the opposite we need to get physical distance between ourselves and and what it represents is this untangling where there had been this mixture and this working together and herdsmen of lot's household and herdsmen of abram's household and servants and resources and cattle and tents and they were always kind of mixed together where maybe one would say well whose cattle is this and whose land is that and whose tents are these and who's heard them to these maybe to the naked eye you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between abram and lot but god is not happy that it stayed that way god does not want there to be any confusion as to who the promise pertains to is that not what happened in the exodus out of egypt that god said that they must that the people will know that i the lord put a difference between israel and egypt he wants to divide between the two he wants to bring this distinction of the one who has the promise and the one that's just kind of hanging out near it and so there's an untangling of lot from abram they're mixed together they're kind of associated together but now god wants to unyoke them where they were together in one place serving in one place feeding in one place living in one place god is separating them out physically from family and there's this unyoking that transpires but i want to say this because i think it's very important that we have the right balance on this because it represents something deeper for us you say well abraham separated from his family and abraham got physical distance from his family it's that oh that in itself would never achieve the separation that god calls if that's all you think you need to do i just need to get away from my family i'm just going to get physically away from them well that that that that's without principle that's just you could just be physically distant from somebody and you can just be ghost in your family and it's not really going to produce anything so it represents a deeper principle for us and it expresses it expresses something very uh very important for us to recognize and this is just the real crux of how god dealt with my heart yesterday and the deeper principles related to the fall in the beginning and so listen to these statements from the message expectation god told abram it told him to separate himself from all of his kindred and god never did bless him anymore till he obeyed him fully he was blessing him but further blessing required full obedience as long as his father hung along why the old fellow caused trouble and then he got with lot and then lot caused trouble and until he separated himself and got away from all the unbelief shook away from him then god came down and talked to him and something happened now you're going to find this over and over and over again to the point to where i have pages and pages of statements where brother branham is zeroing in on this principle that when god separated abraham from lot it expressed the principle that we are to separate completely from unbelief it wasn't well find the family member that doesn't quite believe it the way you do and have nothing to do with them it's the principle of separating from all unbelief until he separated and got away from all unbelief why because lot lot was causing trouble his dad was causing trouble but the principle was he had to get away from unbelief and the sermon jehovah jireh abraham started off he had trouble as long as his daddy was with him the old fellow died he says he said as long as his daddy was with him he had trouble the old fellow died then he took his nephew and as long as lot was along there was trouble god said separate yourself now this is a characterization of the influence that these relationships are having upon abraham trouble as long as it's around there's trouble as long as there wasn't unbelief in the garden there was no trouble now the unbelief is hanging around abraham he has trouble separate yourself walk alone with him that's the way god wants you to do separate yourself from all unbelief and walk alone with god this is the principle now and i want to reinforce it with a couple other statements uh at least another statement that god is calling abraham to separate from lot and what it represents is separation from unbelief a couple more statements in this brother abraham says in genesis the 15th chapter when he taught abraham the separation when abraham was ready to separate himself from unbelieving lot the lukewarm church member so now he's calling him to separate he taught him separation when he was ready to separate from unbelieving lot what is unbelieving lot he's the lukewarm church belief member so he's not a believer he's more akin to the make-believer or unbeliever because it's not genuine faith he's the lukewarm church member this is what god told abraham to do now again i want him to express the principle that we're not merely looking at it on a family level or physical level or even a literal level in terms of the relationships that we have but it has a deeper meaning to separate from unbelief he said he's ready to separate himself from unbelieving lot he says in another place then abraham was commanded to separate himself from all unbelief and walk with god alone well who what was he asked to do it wasn't just to become nomadic and a loner it wasn't just isolation for the sake of isolation yes god was wanting to get one man alone with his wife so he could raise back up the image of the fallen man and the fallen woman but there's also a deeper principle connected to the separation that god wanted to separate abram from unbelief so he says he commanded him to separate himself from all unbelief and then it says and instead of getting weaker he got stronger so whereas when unbelief entered in the beginning it led to death now as abraham begins to separate from unbelief instead of getting weaker he gets stronger so abraham's strength and his growth of character and the the robust faith he had to stand upon mount moriah and offer up his son as a sacrifice he did not reach that perfection of faith while unbelief hung near but he achieved it by removing himself from things that brought the wrong influence and expressed the wrong image and he got stronger instead of weaker so abraham's separation from lot lays a pattern of our separation from unbelief that's what it expresses as we read wednesday night god calls for a total separation to abraham's seed this is an abraham and his seed after him god calls for a total separation to abraham's seed because that's what he called abraham and he asked are you patterning it are you following the pattern this instrument is abraham this instrument represents this seed after him he's the measure he's the means by which something is measured he's the he's the thing that's calibrating and measuring and he's the one that's taking the temperature he's the one that's uh uh that we used to uh as a means of correction and as a standard he said this instrument is abraham the instrument represents his seed after him god called abraham from a total separation from unbelief we do not establish the principle that you should not have anything to do with your nephews that's not the principle expressed in abraham it's a principle of separation from unbelief i don't think this would surprise you at all but the uh the the name lot means covering and what i mean surprise you just that not that you all would have guessed that but that it would have some meaning or significance behind it but lot means covering and here god is calling abraham to separate from lot it's a separation from unbelief it's a separation from make belief it's a separation from religion because religion is a covering and so here's lot hanging near as a as a representation his name is lot and he's kind of hanging near and he represents this religion this covering and what was it that man did in the fall as soon as he fell he went and made himself a covering to hide his guilt and his sin and now here's law that is just expressing what mankind's response was to unbelief instead of addressing the sin addressing the air and making himself available to god he runs from the voice of god and he makes himself his own covering to hide his doubt to hide his unbelief and this is what lot is representing a religion that a dissonance that tries to cover up the fact that one knows they're wrong knows they're not right no something is out of order in god's word lot represents the religion that hides unbelief that hides sin that hides doubt the choice of sodom by lot if i could just lay this seed in there when lot chose sodom and gomorrah at the time it's all the plain of jordan because it looked good financially and economically and for the pleasures of life but what does sodom and gomorre represent the end time condition of satan's eden the climax the pinnacle the peak as it was in the days of lot it represents the mystery babylon here he is making this decision that is identifying the end time conditions of satan's eden and what's attached to it judgment moses right in there before the lord destroyed sodom and gomorrah they're wanting us to understand that that lot chose falsely based upon appearance something that appeared that looked like the garden of god but yet it was a it was a mystery babylon it was a harlot it was filthy it was wicked and it was subject to judgment and so with this and i think this is probably this is evident and the the course that we've been taking this morning of course if that it's not like it's a class you're not getting credit for this with me but there's no quizzes no grade but in the past that we've been traveling in this subject i want you to recognize this god is addressing the root of sin in the beginning that caused the fall of mankind this is what's taking place when god separates abraham from law and you're like well you know if he's like well is that really what he's addressing we're identifying the clear type it's very clear in the message of the hour we could say that in the beginning it was these circumstances existed and now begin to look at what was behind god's separating abraham from lord and we'll see that there's a clear parallel to what happened in the beginning even down to lot meaning covering envelope to cover up and then that is that is religion and that is the covering and that's what man resorted to in genesis chapter 3 to cover his sin and his guilt there's a clear connection in parallel there's a mystery hidden in genesis 1 to 4 which is connected to the call of god in abraham's life which is instructive to us to recognize the faith that's being cultivated in us as believers today so god is addressing the root of sin in the beginning that caused the fall brother makes this statement i've got a few statements here that i want to read just to clinch this remember when god called abraham to separate from lot what was he doing calling him to separate from unbelief brother branham and the message deity of jesus christ that man lost his origin in the garden of eden his relationship communion with god was cut off there because of sin and unbelief unbelief in what the word of god this is what caused the fall sin and unbelief unbelief in the word of god a picture was painted one time to eve and told her how much brighter it would be if she just discard the word of god look over here to reason and lot looked up and saw the well-watered plains of jordan and now eve is caused to look up over here and was just given a reason to reason there is a difference between reason and god's word god's word is true reason is false you can't reason out nothing our mind is not good enough nor never will be to fathom god's eternal wisdom therefore you can't reason it and that could be comforting right when we don't understand it realize well i guess that makes sense got my little human brain here got the mind of god it's not always going to make sense so this can be a comforting notion right it doesn't have to make you feel foolish i'm like yeah that makes sense that's why sometimes i'm not always really fully grasping why god's allowing certain things and why things happen a certain way and that's why things don't often make sense it's because i'm really here in my canary brain and here's god with this professor from purdue this one who's speaking uh divine things in high wisdom that i can only understand through the spirit that's what brother brahms identifying here the mind can't grasp it and he says you can't reason it you just got to believe it and so then the picture was painted out back there through the our first father and mother and they fell and that broke off relationship with god and was driven from the garden of eden it's this is very beautifully put and well detailed but unbelief broke the conditional covenant in the garden of eden and i want i want to say this so you recognize this unbelief unbelief can't survive the conditional covenant unconditional covenant given to abraham that you're also a member of part of i think about that unbelief broke the conditional covenant but unbelief can never survive it breaks a conditional one but it can't survive an unconditional one that means it's it's got to go and so this is unbelief that causes the fall christ is a mystery god revealed what killed eve unbelief is that right their unbelief in what the unbelief in god no she had faith in god oh sure did she did she say there is no god no sir she wasn't an infidel well she said you know i don't believe his word at all oh no she believed all but one little thing and one little thing with all the unbelief it needed to what kill her what killed eve unbelief what was the sin in the beginning unbelief what caused the fall unbelief it says in first timothy chapter 2 verse 14 and adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression in other words she's the one that crossed the line she went over against the word of god and just one promise slightly doubted caused all the fall it's what caused the fall it's what caused the woman to conceive death that's what caused the woman to bring forth wickedness that's what caused the woman to bring forth a child who was of that wicked one all it took was for her not to reject god in his entirety but just misplaced the promise just one promise slightly doubted just one promise slightly disbelieved just a slight turn away oh just look for a moment at this and consider whether this be fair and reasonable and then heard transgression if we really thought about said yep god made a perfect eden and all eve did was eat an apricot and this is what we get for the next 6 000 years and we think man god is just really trigger happy i mean this is really unfair that escalated quickly and you're thinking just overeating the fruit that's it and we could think that this is very unreasonable this is very harsh and this is a very wicked god but it was her sin in itself is very tremendous and great and violated many different principles but there's a way that you look and says what was what was wrong with just this slight as as many people believe it just the partaking of fruit but do you realize that the lot's wife her sin in the same way just a slight look back in the place that looked like the garden of eden now sin conceived in sodom and gomorrah and it's like lot's wife can't pull herself away from what it represented and just slightly turning back she's turned to a pillar of salt what condemned her unbelief the transgression just crossing that line and the sermon what shall i do with jesus called christ like by the same means that the mother eve corrupted the whole world to a physical death the mother eve mother eve corrupt corrupted the whole human race to physical death by rejecting the word and accepting something almost like it oh just how subtle that it was by accepting something almost like it by rejecting the word and accepting something almost not a complete repudiation like the devil showed up and he he sewed together a red suit with a pitchfork tail you know a fork and tail and and a pitchfork he showed up with horns he's like aha andy and he was trying to scare her and she's like you know what you're a much better representation of the god i want to serve than this other one that comes down the cool the evening and created all this it's something very much like it she caused all physical death because she left the word and believed the true word all but just a little bit one little disagreement with the full word of god caused every heartache every death and everything has ever been on the earth eve done it the mother of death now you see where we're coming the mother of death notice she just disbelieved the word so eve how did you become the mother of death but just disbelieving one little promise one little thing skip in a little bit just to um to con make this more concise in just a paragraph or so later he says notice a daughter is a product of a mother and a father by union now here's something shocking but death physical death is the uniting of mother eve and satan together by disbelieving god's word it's very heavy very heavy but i think if you recognize the concept that's even symbolically being represented in the garden this isn't very hard to digest in terms of it being right but it is very weighty very heavy it says they united and brought in the product of death death is a product of uniting satan and eve together eve had the word satan is against the word and almost 99 and 99 hundredths of it satan admitted was right so close the bible said in the last days it would deceive the very elect if it was possible so how it comes in how it always been how how is it going out the same way united of unbelief and all the full word of god that's what brought death is uniting unbelief with the word unbelief just a little bitty part of it little bitty teeny bit 100th of one percent but it must be 100 percent that's all what caused the fall in the beginning unbelief what brought in all the trouble unbelief what did abraham have as long as he hung around lot trouble what was he doing when he called him to separate from lot calling him to separate from unbelief in john chapter 16 verses 8 and 9 this is just one scripture you can use to establish the principle that sin is unbelief and he's speaking of the comforter and when he has come he will reprove the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgment and then jesus comes of of sin righteousness and judgment and the next few several verses he says he will reprove the world of sin because they believe not on me this is showing us that sin is related to unbelief that sin in itself when it's distilled down at its most basic principle sin is unbelief sin is the root excuse me unbelief is the root of sin unbelief is the sap of sin it's the life of sin it's the chief power of all sin and i can say this unbelief is the sin unto death if all unrighteousness is sin and there's a sin not unto death there is there are attributes of sin but sin itself being unbelief it is the sin unto death and this is the part i want you to consider and i bring this in uh just knowing where where it stands in the word of god unbelief is the head of the serpent that christ was to crush it's the power of satan it was the power of the serpent it was the very thing that gave life that perverted life and gave manifestation to the devil's lies it was unbelief so unbelief is the head of the serpent that christ was ordained to crush it is the source of wickedness it is the source of evil it is the source of death it is the source of sin so in christ that he would bruise and crush the head of the serpent it was unbelief that he was going to crush so when god designated genesis chapter 3 verse 15 the seed of the woman that would crush the serpent's head then he designated to abraham abraham came under anointing that required him to ultimately separate from unbelief he had to because it was part of the promise that was designated to him that he would crush the head of the serpent which is unbelief think of it this way as i need to kind of move this along sarah's womb was dead the bible even tells us that abraham did not even regard the deadness of his own body so there's no way that life could ever come to sarah by abraham until there was separation until there was separation from unbelief because unbelief brought death and until there could be life come through abraham he had to separate himself from lot now i want i'd like to take i would have wanted to take more time on this particular aspect but i um i have confidence in your robust imagination and your ability to paint a picture in your mind and to allow something just to rise up and create an image an accurate image but think about abraham now he's in a wilderness this is the contrast between what lot chosen what abraham chose the bible's wanting to be wants us to take the liberty to realize that lot took the good land i mean he has the he has the yard in phoenix that's over an acre and it's all real grass not a synthetic in it it's all real grass and it's well watered and it it it thrives all year long and actually has trees because elliot doesn't believe there's any trees in arizona at least not in phoenix and everything is just this is beautiful and abra abraham i mean you wouldn't even call it a rock garden i mean he just doesn't have anything he's just in the dust he's in the wilderness and here is abraham in a wilderness roaming growing old uh facing conflict in a land he's a stranger in this land he's concerned about the perizzites and the canaanites fierce people and abraham is just kind of plucking up his tent moving around going here and there roaming to and fro in a vast world and it's not even able to enjoy the riches of the land that god had promised him that's the picture of abraham and now just picture the woman in the garden of eden you you can't get a more contrasting picture not just because it's a man in the wilderness and a woman in a garden but just you start to drill down on what the wilderness was and what the garden was and here abraham is in the the dry desert with the body that is failing him with the wife with the dried up womb without any natural possession without any children after him yet seemingly able to accumulate great wealth and escape from conflict but it's a great contrast to the woman in a perfect garden in a paradise surrounded by perfection perfection perfection perfection and that's the contrast and this is what is said of abraham romans 4 19 to 21 abraham being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about 100 years old neither yet the deadness of sarah's womb he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to god and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform wow that's remarkable especially when you consider the fact that eve was in the middle of everything that was perfect and slightly doubted just a little bit and abraham really has no reason to kind of look around like i'm fine everything's great but yet he's he says all is well his disposition is that he was fully persuaded no matter how far away it was he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief didn't consider the deadness all around him all the confirming circumstances all the confirming situations once he's separated from unbelief no matter how long time passed by his faith didn't get weaker it actually got stronger it's a paradox but think about it had abraham had the child at 75 he would have thought ah this whole boy still gots it right say sir i knew you could do it and they would have just thought hey we just you know just just happened late but it gets to the point to where it can only be god and so then it becomes only faith that you're counting on and that makes faith stronger when you're not not taking your focus and propping it up by all the other avenues all the other possibilities and everything well you know what maybe god will give me a job or the lottery's looking pretty good as long as you feel that you've got another escape route then faith is not loose to full be fully or if i could say it this way your faith is not free to fully persuade you but being fully persuaded so are we patterning it seems like such a clumsy word to say patterning it but are we patterning it how do we measure to this kind of faith abraham's faith growing stronger year after year why because it became more clear to him it was going to be god that does it and so he trusted in him alone as he walked with him and unbelief got further away he never had a reason to reason this part of the separation from lot there'd never be there wouldn't be this confusion about the promise notice what it says in 2nd corinthians chapter 6 verses 14 to 18. i want to bring out a very simple principle in this it reflected in god separating abraham from lot and it's connected to the fall in the garden which was by unbelief be not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness now notice the the um kind of the cadence here what communion hath light with darkness so what fellowship with righteousness righteousness with unrighteousness communion with light with darkness what concord with christ and have christ with belial or what part have he that believeth with an infidel and what agreement hath the temple of god with idols notice that beautiful cadence and the rhythm to that the fellowship that righteousness would have with unrighteousness the communion that light would have with darkness the concord that christ would have with below the part or portion that the believer hath he that believeth hath with an infidel would agreement would the temple of god have with idols and they are expressing different principles but it's more or less just to enrich this thought of what god is calling us to do when it says be not unequally yoked with unbelievers because then he brings it to this personal recognition as god hath he says for ye are the temple of the living god as god have said i will dwell in them and walk in them and i will be their god and they shall be my people this is a promise that was given to israel that repeats the promise that was given to abraham that i will walk with you and be your god this is some a promise he gave to abraham it's a promise repeated to the natural seat of abraham now paul is repeating to the royal seat of abraham it pertains to us wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate notice the call of separation as god separated abram out of babylon and brought him into canaan and ultimately separated him from lot he's now saying that we have to come out from under among them come out from among her my people wherefore come out from among them and be separate saith the lord and touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you notice the symmetry to the promise to abraham he had to separate then god could speak to him then god could come to him and will be a father unto you and ye shall be my sons and daughters said the lord almighty this is what god revealed himself to abram after separation i am the mighty god walk before me and be thou perfect this is a call clear call to separation from unbelief sometimes we just like to focus on the unbeliever so we we can pick and choose our friends well why don't you fellowship with someone oh well they're an unbeliever but it's not it's not the unbeliever it's the unbelief this is a separation from unbelief don't mix with things contrary to the word the contrary influences the contrary ambitions the things that try to take you away from the promise notice how it talks about fellowship communion concord part or portion agreement these are all terms of harmony these are all terms of unity and some commonality the portion they share in things what what sharing what harmony what agreement what common goal what motive do they commonly pursue and so he says do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers it means to join with one who has a different spirit to join one alien in spirit to not join so don't be unequally yoked don't don't join with something has a different nature don't join with something has it going a different direction because that causes conflict if a wagon train's going one way don't hit your wagon to it if you're wanting to go the other because that's competing in the in the progress you want to make this is the principle that's being expressed and it's drawn from paul is literally drawing from deuteronomy 22 10 wherein the law spoke thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together in other words don't unequally yoke a beast of burden don't take an ox and place them with a donkey or a mule don't have them plowed together why according to deuteronomy 14 the ox was a clean animal and the the ass was unclean and what what was it what did it relate to they had different natures the bible is pointing this uh this this uh this principle out that paul's saying be not unequally yoked and so one who had been read in the law and paul being versed in the law he's drawing from this image that's raised up in the law to where you wouldn't want to put an ox with a donkey you wouldn't want to put an ox with a mule because they have different kind of natures different work ethics respond to different kind of of commands and they're going to plow differently have a different canes a different pace can even have a different uh endurance and body structure he said this is this is not prudent this is not wisdom this is not going to facilitate the proper tilling of the ground and so when god is telling us through the word to not be unequally yoked we're considering more than just this physical isolation we're considering more than just this knee jerk while you don't believe life can't have fellowship with darkness we're considering what it is that god is wanting us to focus on and by virtue of our faith being focused it causes a necessary separation from all the forces that are trying to manipulate our view of the word of god and keep us back from the promise because think about it abraham and lot had different promises they had different natures as soon as god called abraham he begins to operate under a different nature they had different destinies therefore it was necessary for god to separate abraham from law to distinctly identify abraham's calling i cannot emphasize this enough to you to recognize that we have to be careful there's a way that satan wants to fold in different layers of unbelief and different colons and different uh stations and and and salvations and make us kind of all just one thing to where at the end of the day we find ourselves saying well then really how much different am i as the bride from everyone else what what what is difference is it we just get an early you know we get an early preview of eternity is that it like we get a sneak peek like buy fullest virgin we're getting to see this early but you'll be right where we are in just a moment we just get to see it we got like a vip pass we're in the green room there's more to it there is you are different the bride of jesus christ is different there's a there's such a uh god is very particular and distinct in the way that he describes things and the parables that are given and i cannot emphasize enough that you've got to recognize how how much different abraham was from lot lot that lukewarm formal cold foolish virgin unwise church member laodicean church member all the ways that he's described he has different promises he has different access to eternity he has different things he's judged by he is way different than abraham and god says as long as they're kind of hanging around and milling around then we're not going to recognize just how distinct i've made abraham and this difference that god is establishing within abraham comes up again when the king of sodom comes to him after the battle of the kings and wants to share a reward with abraham and he says i don't even want to take one thing from sodom because i don't want there to be any confusion as to what's blessed me and where my promise and my inheritance is he refused it whereas lot accepted it and lived there now abraham has this separation from unbelief and he knows there's a difference between those of sodom there's a difference of those that would pitch their tent towards sodom there's a difference and i am different as we mentioned wednesday night i want to mention it here as we oh goodness i'm about to say we're going to close but i got another page i didn't realize that whoa what are we going to do lot is still tied to babylon remember he leaves babylon but where does he end up sodom like man lot you did great you left sodom or you left babylon where are you now um i'm in sodom could you imagine you mail something to lot and it gets a change of address and you get a notice back and says his address has changed he's no longer in babylon you're like glory to god lot got the revelation his new address is sodom 666 sodom way sodom what is he doing anything oh that's horrible they start out so well hanging out with abraham and ends up in sodom what did he represent a distraction abraham a an influence upon him a a murmur we see in the the word of god how he's a murmur a complainer in the messenger kind of highlights some of those things and so lot signifies a confusion about the promise he he's representing what the mixing of the carnal with the spiritual him being family to abraham represents the old nature of abraham what does he measure by carnal eyesight carnal understanding this looks good this looks great unable to weigh the wickedness as being a detraction from wanting to have it this is what lot represents this is what lot signifies this is what god is separating abraham from and then the the message the communion then god showed in abraham what he would do for all not only was this blessed promise of the resurrection and eternal life given to abraham but to his seed after him the called the elected of god and we noticed that abraham out in the field where he was sojourning his brother he called it lot it really was his nephew his brother's son and the time come for the testing and lot weakened under the testing he has a perfect picture of the carnal believer today when the testings come to stay on the barren land abraham gave him his choice and lot lifted up his eyes and saw the fields the valley and it was full of grass it was also full of uh fine homes it was full of gaytis also full of sin there's your contrast but lot being of the carnal nature loving this present world more than the things to come chose rather to live luxurious in this life than to have life hereafter remember the different natures being unequally yoked different natures different desires different ambitions different things that feed different things that motivate different things that you're trying to accomplish abraham a perfect type of the true believer who's been washed in the lamb whose affections was set on the things above said i'll take the way with the lord's despised few regardless if it cost my popularity whatever it cost i'll take the way with the lord's few the working title i had for a lot of these things that i was accumulating and studying the supreme faith walks alone by necessity but by character he chose a perfect type of the true believer whose affections are set on the things above so abraham his sights are on eternity his side strong glory he seeks the city not made with hands whose builder and maker is god lot is only looking with the natural eye eventually that that's what drew them apart that lot was willing to go a direction that abraham was not willing to go and brother braham says in the message faith of abraham separate yourself think about this just let this kind of shake you i know we're kind of in the lateness of the service here but he says let's get out with god alone like abraham we are abraham's seed let's show it show that we believe god this is it's necessary there's a way maybe it's easier for men just to kind of just to simulate in and their wives to really stand out but there has got to be there is a calling and a measure given in the word of god whereby others will know they may not know exactly what we are and where we come from but they'll know there is a difference and there's enough in this word of god that we can embrace there's enough that we can stand for there's enough influence it can have on what we say what we do what we watch what we wear how we treat other people to where we can be show that we believe god but notice where the problem was and as long as abraham held on to two little things two little things was his dad and his nephew as long as abraham held on to two little things it was holding him back just two little things i ask you today what little things are you holding on to what are what little things could it be ideas could it be the past just little things that are holding you back they held back abraham because don't for a minute think that i'm uh this challenge is to lot it's to abraham you're abraham's seed so you're being challenged because you have a promise that is greater you have a calling that is greater and we could take a step and say are there things that are holding me back just two little things my past my future my ambitions my goals my ideas certain ideals bill graham says in the message look when your mind and eyes can be single to that word and focus that in until you see exactly what god is doing what a wonderful thing do you hear that when your mind and eyes can single be single to the word focus in on what god is doing that's a wonderful thing abraham saw it he did not look into the misunderstandings of the promise because there were but he didn't look to him what if he would look and see here i'm 75 years old and such as such a voice spoke to me and said i'm to have a baby my wife she's 65 years old about 15 20 years past menopause what would have he done but what did he do he never paid any attention to what the natural things were he looked at what god said it became such a reality to him till he didn't see anything else but what god said he left his home he separated himself from all unbelief anything that would try to pull him away he separated himself so he could walk alone that's what every genuine believer has to do separate yourself from these doubters and unbelievers and walk with christ it's life to you and abraham did such a thing and 25 years later we find him still believing the same promise why he had focused his mind to the will of god by the word of god and believed it if we can focus ourself to the plan of god to what god wants for us and what god promised us and let everything else alone no matter how long it is just keep believing romans 4 here we find romans 4 14 it said and he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief he didn't let unbelief contaminate him at all it's going to be nearest it's going to be in the land it's going to be right there in our face but we can't let it contaminate his he looked to one thing that was the voice that spoke to him that's what the church ought to do today look to the one thing the voice the word of god that speaks to us churches and people can speak any way but look to the voice it's the voice that eve disobeyed it's the voice that abraham submits to it's a contrary voice that sold the seeds of unbelief that caused her to stray to bring trouble and so when god calls abraham he's bringing us right back to the same image it's now a voice calling him to separate from the unbelief that has been sowed into humanity therefore abraham's separation from lot stands for our separation from unbelief to now begin to crush the head of the serpent that brought forth sin in the beginning the nature and character of lot points back to the nature and character of the woman in the garden where is she united with unbelief lot is united with unbelief he's characterized by it she's in a perfect eden with a perfect promise and a perfect god but the woman fails on one promise that's it just one and when god separates abraham he does it to release his faith so the promise could be fulfilled remember unbelief broke the covenant now unbelief can't survive the new covenant so god has to crush it he has to separate it he has to call abraham completely out of it we mentioned it wednesday night and it comes to my it comes in the image here now as i ponder this as we close the process that's taking place in abraham's life was a matter of god putting him in position to receive the promise everything's intentional everything even is symbolic he's an instrument and he's expressing something what god does to abraham he does to a seat after him now he's the instrument he's laying a pattern he's portraying something he's painted a picture and so god the process that's taking place in abraham's life is the process of god placing abraham in a position he's getting abraham in a condition to manifest the promise and so much of the things that are taking place in abraham's life we refer to as a preparation getting him in condition what is he doing he's conditioning abraham for supreme faith he's putting him through the paces he's exercising him he's causing conflict conflict delayed is conflict multiplied so he's allowing conflict to come and it's addressed he's increasing his character he's brought in his vision he's putting footsteps to the promise all these things are taking place in abraham because god is removing him and walking him through things and he's being put in the condition to what received the promise being placed in position brother branham says in the message perfect faith and i just i was wrestling with whether or not i should just leave this off and come back to it but i've been uh drawn to this the last few service services when a man lives by faith and walks by faith i mean substance faith he is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in christ there now you're getting into bride material notice what the separation was for to make a difference of the material to make a difference in the condition you're getting into rapture and condition now that means for each one of us not just the pastor deacon's trustees that means for the laity every individual walks in a world with god alone you're baptized into this kingdom there's nobody in there but you and god he gives the orders and you pack them out whatever he says there's not a shadow of doubt nowhere you walk right on if the lord says this there's nobody in the world can talk you out of it you go right on just the same he says now when we see this now you're coming into perfect faith perfect perfection that cannot fail i love the addendum perfect perfection that cannot fail that faith never fails yes he is speaking of christ he was a mystic to them with his perfect faith and so is it now with those who have perfect faith are a mystic to others this perfectly describes abraham he is the he is the first mystic as it was christ was a mystic with his perfect faith we know that we're taught that abraham's faith reached perfection made perfect by his offering of isaac upon the altar but a mystic is a person who seeks whether it be by contemplation or meditation or thought but seeks by even self-surrender to obtain a union with deity even if you just put it in a mysticism or some other uh other religion in the world a mystic would be somebody who by meditation and by discipline and self-surrender they're going to achieve this oneness and become one in this harmony with some sort of deity bible is using this language to describe jesus it's a language we can use to describe abraham and he is one who sought to become one with the divine it's one who believes in the spiritual apprehension of truths that are beyond intellect that's what a mystic would be in even a romanticized spiritual way or even kind of a uh um some of the religions of the world that want to attain to a nirvana or have some sort of uh style of meditation and reflection and contemplation or some sort of inner peace and some sort of harmony with nature it's one who believes in the apprehension of truths that go beyond the flesh and beyond the intellect and in this mysticism of christ we can see the same mysticism in abraham whereas he was seeking a city beyond the flesh a city whose builder and maker was god he was believing in things that could not even be ver verified physically abraham you're sterile your wife doesn't have any eggs there's no way you guys can have children no matter how bad it would seem he was bonded with the promise beyond he had crossed over he has a different viewpoint versus lord who all he can judge by are natural things and lack the spiritual discernment of the wicked that lays within the beauty what a difference and we are likened to the same when you come into perfect faith you are a mystic to others you're different you're an outlier you're separated from them brother mike if you could come in the message perfect faith again you just catch this this is at the very very end he says i'm working out something see it's taking this charge of faith and going right back to begin and come in to kind of raise faith in the bracket so this is a higher faith this is a growing faith this is a supreme faith this is a perfect faith a bracket where you've never noticed it that way before not a faith but a perfect faith remember eve had a faith but just misplaced a promise not a faith but a perfect faith built up in here and watch a perfect god with the perfect heart keep a perfect promise by his perfect word now we're right back where the woman was but in satan's eating watch a perfect god with a perfect heart keep a perfect promise by his perfect word that's right where abraham was he had an opportunity to watch a perfect god with the perfect heart keep a perfect promise by his perfect word which is sharper than a two-edged sword and a discerner of the thoughts of the heart it's what god manifested before abraham in genesis 18. so he says we are coming now to the perfection because the people have to come to this in order for the rapture notice the order perfection first then the rapture it's not rapture into perfection but it's rapturing condition for a rapture that's what's holding it away right now it's waiting for the church to come into that perfect raptured faith some uh transcribing that says i'm looking for it he says looking for it it means a lot of shaving down for me some of the earlier uh um transcription said shaking i think the same thought is conveyed in both but shaving down think about that a lot of shaving down a lot of carving away a lot of honing a lot of separate it means a lot of shaving down for me it means a lot for you could i say a lot more maybe means a lot for you but together we'll make it by the grace of god why abraham made it you're the seed of abraham you can't miss it but it means a lot of shaving down for me he says he's saying about himself a lot more for us perhaps but together we'll make it by the grace of god the image that's portrayed to us in god separating abraham from lot is not that we have some sort of disdain for family or those that don't see things the way that we do mention it wednesday night and it behooves us it behooves me to mention it again abraham's separation from lot produced no nastiness in abraham's spirit towards lot he maintained a christian spirit one that was willing to go to great lengths to see that lot was redeemed and rescued and sometimes the false conception of separation is what produces a nastiness produces a separation on the basis of personality and pretense and politics and for really the narcissistic ambitions of men who are afraid to be vulnerable and afraid to uh to admit mistakes and try to build up their own kingdoms and isolate and tear down other things and what we realize with abraham is he was fine with lot having everything was beautiful and perfect and he would take those things which weren't perfect knowing one day he would possess them all and he still maintained the right attitude towards lot we must do the same thing and recognize that the principle that god portrays in the supreme faith of abraham is that in separating from lot he reproduced the image of one man and one woman with the promise of children in the possession of a land identified in the first covenant to the man and the woman and the possession of a garden in eden but mankind lost that through the fall so in the separation from lot there's more that's represented he's also representing that abraham was being called away from unbelief that destroyed the original covenant and it's a testimony to us that we ought to accept right now as believers that if there be anything in me that's contrary to the word of god it shall not survive the unconditional covenant and that god will as long as necessary work upon me and shave me until every attribute of unbelief is gone so the separation is not so much external and my fingers pointed at you and my fingers pointed at that but it begins with me focusing on faith and that when abraham focused on the promise and he focused his eyes upon the word brother man said he focused his eyes on the voice it was when abraham began to focus his eyes upon the promise and he said lot why don't you separate from me we can focus on the promise and it'll be our refocused and re-energized and more deliberate purposeful faith that'll actually begin to cause the separation of unbelief that exists within ourselves the contrary nature the memories the ideas anything that's holding us back that's the separation that god wants to achieve if that's not what starts it then we're just cultish when we cut other people out we're just cultists when we look down on other people and cultists when we talk about this and talk about that and have a kind of elitist attitude towards everything else separation begins with inner self-reflection and self-awareness of god you're separating the royal seat in me from the seat of lot and let that be let that be the work that god does in us as believers let that be the principle that's expressed to us it's a very vast principle that has application a lot of areas but i want you to see that principle that it's a separation from unbelief stand together today [Music] thank you for your attentiveness today it's evident by the expression on your faces it's evident by the pull that you have upon the word as we close in prayer [Music] you have every right as the seed of abraham to lift a thought to him a prayer to him a heart to him it's a lot of needs that exist uh in in our church if you just look at it that way our local body here different relationships that we have and families that are represented here there's a lot of difficult decisions being made and difficult parts of journeys we have a lot to pray for it's a troublesome time in the world today but we can find solid footing i don't believe you can find it in him it's bowerheads you have a need look to him now heavenly father [Music] your word calls for a total separation from unbelief [Music] and i i come to you today with the desire that you as the potter would mold me in the image that you see me in [Music] lord i come to you willing to be vulnerable i come to you willing to be open about things that exist in my thought process and my instincts and my behavior even in my attitude towards others that more aligns with lot than it does with abraham and i want to be honest with myself today and maybe even self-aware enough to say lord i need help this isn't about what others have done to me it's about what is in me but what i allow to continue to exist about the lot instinct to the religion that tries to cover up and lord for a moment i'm willing to be vulnerable before your presence and let your heart word search mine and lord if there be anything in me that's contrary to the promise anything that would hinder and delay your visitation as it was with abraham lord i pray now you would bring a separation lord i can in my own self focus on the word of god and i do that now and i begin to take inventory of my daily habits and the life that i'm leading and things that i'm pursuing and the things that have become very close to me and begin to shape my thinking and my perceptions oh god i pray now that you would just catch the attention of every believer that's here this morning that is allowing themselves to have their view of this world shaped by a lot whether it be their own instincts their own feelings or view of the world or an ideology or anything that would try to mix itself with the promise or cover up something that needs to be made right oh god i pray today that there could be a genesis 13 experience in our lives to get the distance from sodom to get separation from the nature of lord to walk alone with you bless us we pray lord as we remember the requests that have been made [Music] lord the challenges that we're facing we commit ourselves to you bless us now as we are dismissed soon may your presence go with us may you be with the people may our eyes be upon the promise continually we love you we ask this in the name of the lord jesus christ amen
