[0:00] knowing where we're going with this
[0:01] Parable this morning I just get excited
[0:03] reading through it thinking of all the
[0:06] different applications and understanding
[0:09] that we can have and looking at this
[0:10] it's a remarkable scripture in light of
[0:13] the original sin and how that God in in
[0:16] the beginning created and it's the
[0:18] wicked one that comes later and so seed
[0:21] that perverts God God's creation so I
[0:24] know there's a lot of things that we
[0:25] could take to heart and gather from this
[0:26] but today we're going to be speaking on
[0:28] the seeds of the Kingdom now we started
[0:31] Wednesday night on a series on the
[0:34] kingdom and it's called The Kingdom
[0:35] Heaven's mystery Earth's glory and as we
[0:38] look at the Kingdom I'd say it's just a
[0:41] vast subject and I'm sure that you
[0:43] yourselves have probably even over the
[0:46] last few days if you were here Wednesday
[0:48] night notice just how frequently you can
[0:50] find references to the kingdom whether
[0:52] it be in the message of the hour in your
[0:53] Bible so it is a very very large subject
[0:56] and I don't I I try to resist the uh
[1:00] kind of that inclination where we're
[1:02] kind of wired to identify patterns as
[1:04] human beings and and so I could uh I
[1:07] could preach a sermon this morning on
[1:08] carpet or flooring and bring out all
[1:11] sorts of types and you go home and be
[1:12] like oh my goodness we have a floor this
[1:15] is so spiritual and that's not what I'm
[1:17] trying to do with the phrase the kingdom
[1:19] but you will find that it is a very vast
[1:21] subject that gives us an opportunity to
[1:23] cover many different principles so we
[1:24] just we'll just obey the Lord and how he
[1:26] would lead us and the things that he
[1:28] would want us to explore under this but
[1:30] I want to start today by going back to
[1:32] the beginning and identifying some
[1:34] principles from the start because I'll
[1:36] say the kingdom has been God's objective
[1:38] from the beginning uh even as brother
[1:41] Lucas was singing and even how it began
[1:43] a king isn't a king if he only has a
[1:46] throne and what a thought in that and
[1:49] what a a great thing to think about what
[1:51] was in the mind of God and what he was
[1:53] meditating on and what he was kind of
[1:54] his his heart was indicting uh and there
[1:57] is there's such connection with what
[1:59] we've been ministering on perfect love
[2:01] so I'm saying this isn't the we haven't
[2:03] finished the series on perfect love
[2:04] we've just transitioned to another view
[2:06] uh because truly if God is love and he
[2:09] Christ is that Capstone and charity is
[2:11] God and it's perfect love then really
[2:13] that's what we're ministering all the
[2:14] time and if the goal in this hour is to
[2:17] get the bride to recognize who she is
[2:19] then the word is show the word is a
[2:21] mirror to the bride so she can recognize
[2:22] herself but God has been the the kingdom
[2:25] is has been God's objective from the
[2:27] beginning and in the sermon countdown
[2:29] I'm just going to read a couple
[2:30] statements that we used on Wednesday
[2:32] and in doing this I hope to set forth
[2:36] before you some key principles that
[2:38] we're looking at in this series on the
[2:40] kingdom says as science achieves
[2:42] something Looking Backward and he gives
[2:44] these examples in this sermon countdown
[2:47] that even though it may seem like
[2:49] technology is advancing us forward
[2:51] brother Brahman says no it's marching us
[2:52] backwards uh and truly we could say that
[2:55] as technology it hit maybe at some point
[2:58] we felt like we had Advanced but now
[3:00] we've gotten back to just using our
[3:01] thumb and that's all we do anymore so I
[3:04] feel like did his technology is just
[3:06] marching us marching us backwards but
[3:08] they said God achieves going this way
[3:10] going forward to the kingdom and so God
[3:14] is achieving God had something he wanted
[3:16] in the beginning we read a couple
[3:17] Wednesdays ago how that God wanted to
[3:19] achieve for himself a Brides that's
[3:21] going to be God's achievement and so God
[3:24] achieves going this way and not I'm not
[3:26] sure just exactly which way brother
[3:28] Branham was appointing him if you
[3:30] conceptualized that one is trending
[3:32] downward or backwards or in a negative
[3:34] way God is saying God always goes
[3:36] forward to the kingdom whatever man does
[3:39] is regression whatever God does is
[3:40] progression God is always moving forward
[3:42] he's always advancing toward or forward
[3:45] to the kingdom that's a principle we
[3:48] understand if God acts if God moves if
[3:50] he doesn't act it's only to serve to
[3:52] further us to the kingdom
[3:54] now in the sermon Christ is the mystery
[3:57] God revealed he says we belong to a
[3:58] kingdom and the kingdom is the word of
[4:02] God made spirit in life in our own life
[4:06] that's uh that that's kind of maybe the
[4:09] whole substance of what is uh burning in
[4:12] my heart is the kingdom is the word of
[4:15] God made spirit in life in our own life
[4:18] so he said well what's the kingdom the
[4:20] kingdom of God is within you what does
[4:22] it mean to think about the kingdom well
[4:24] it's it's to have the life of God inside
[4:27] of you because the kingdom is the word
[4:29] of God living through his subjects
[4:31] living through his people he says to
[4:34] bring to pass every promise in this day
[4:36] as it did in that day when the word in
[4:38] God Was Won and that kind of hearkens
[4:40] back to the days of Christ so he's
[4:42] saying the word of God is one in his
[4:44] church makes the headship of the body
[4:46] that is redeemed to bring the message in
[4:48] the last day so you are a reflection of
[4:51] the message you have a part to play and
[4:53] then it says to be taken up from the
[4:54] dead in the resurrection to go back and
[4:57] restore again as Adam and Eve now notice
[4:59] how this comes right back to the
[5:00] beginning you know Eden is brought up so
[5:02] frequently in the sermon Christ is the
[5:04] mystery of God revealed that third
[5:05] purpose to restore it back to an Eden
[5:08] condition the kingdom he says in the
[5:10] it's rightly positioned in the beginning
[5:12] of the Garden of Eden he says the
[5:13] threefold mystery of God his body
[5:16] so his body his bride as part of this
[5:18] great mystery that's why we say Christ
[5:20] is the mystery of God revealed the bride
[5:22] is the mystery of God finished it's the
[5:24] consummation it's the completion
[5:26] and so in looking at this subject today
[5:28] the seeds of the Kingdom
[5:31] I I could say uh if just to kind of give
[5:34] some context to that we're wanting to go
[5:36] back and look at God's will in the
[5:38] beginning as we read that God uh the
[5:42] kingdom of God cannot be rightly
[5:43] established on permissive will brother
[5:45] Brahm says so the kingdom cannot be
[5:46] established fully on permissive will
[5:49] it's got to come back to his perfect
[5:50] will so we want to go back to the
[5:52] beginning to identify his perfect will
[5:53] and once we identify his perfect will in
[5:56] the beginning I think it gives us so
[5:58] much more purpose and color to why we're
[5:59] living today
[6:01] and and I just find myself having to
[6:03] draw from a Wednesday night so much in
[6:07] that to make this point there's such a
[6:10] there's a fine line between uh
[6:14] Living For The Rapture
[6:16] and and and and and being dismissive of
[6:20] where we are now in the sense that wow
[6:22] we want we want to get out of here we
[6:24] want to leave we want a Rapture I'm
[6:25] hungry about the body change and I want
[6:27] to go meet the Lord in the air and
[6:28] there's I believe there's this fine line
[6:30] that you can cross to where you've
[6:32] you've now are so forward-looking that
[6:35] you miss what's taking place right now
[6:36] and just how critical the now is to what
[6:40] it is you're longing for and so we don't
[6:42] want to find ourselves looking over
[6:44] today when it comes to how am I going to
[6:46] meet him in the air how can I see that
[6:49] this change comes you have to be
[6:51] recognizing your day and its message and
[6:53] what God is doing right now
[6:55] so this morning as we go forward in the
[6:57] seeds of the Kingdom if you could take
[6:59] your Bibles and turn to Genesis chapter
[7:01] 2
[7:02] verse 25.
[7:06] and since this church began a few years
[7:08] ago
[7:09] there's probably been no more
[7:11] scriptures we haven't we've probably
[7:13] used more scriptures and more thoughts
[7:15] from these first two chapters and first
[7:17] few chapters of the Book of Genesis
[7:19] uh than any other place perhaps
[7:22] and I find it's just endless in terms of
[7:23] what you can draw out of it
[7:26] and and even if we stopped drawing
[7:29] things out of it the the word that's in
[7:32] it uh
[7:33] requires emphasis and deserves emphasis
[7:36] so there's certainly a lot here I'm not
[7:38] trying to
[7:39] um anticipate your complaints to the
[7:42] repetition it just there's so much in it
[7:45] it's worth it to repeat it now I'm going
[7:48] to look at verse 25 and this is a
[7:50] conclusion I'm kind of looking at the
[7:52] end of the com the creation and as God
[7:55] had set everything forth and he's and
[7:57] point something out and hopefully be
[7:59] able to move forward very quickly he
[8:01] says and they were both naked the man
[8:04] and his wife and so as it kind of sets
[8:07] this in there and that phrase you could
[8:09] say the man and his wife were naked
[8:11] and not ashamed they were both naked the
[8:14] man and his wife and were not ashamed if
[8:17] I could say this
[8:18] I present to you that this is God's
[8:21] kingdom as we read from Genesis 1 all
[8:24] the way to Genesis 2 25 we can say this
[8:26] is God's kingdom man and wife living
[8:29] together in a perfect Eden nothing out
[8:31] of cater nothing out of order and I know
[8:33] we emphasize this a lot in the sermon
[8:35] perfect love so there's a lot that the
[8:37] series there's a lot that you can draw
[8:39] from this is God's kingdom this is his
[8:42] creation uh man and woman there in the
[8:45] Eden up over the whole earth ruling and
[8:47] reigning this is God's Kingdom and it
[8:50] was sovereignly created by God God did
[8:53] this sovereignly of his own will of his
[8:55] own ambition God set things forth it
[8:57] wasn't uh this wasn't an accident you
[8:59] find a lot of times in science that
[9:01] things were created by accident or
[9:03] invented or discovered by accident
[9:05] they're trying to do one thing else it's
[9:06] like oh look there's an earth over here
[9:08] what happened and let's just see how it
[9:10] unfolds and see how it plays out this
[9:12] was God being very deliberate very
[9:14] intentional I often think about brother
[9:16] kydry Diggs a sermon on
[9:19] uh God is intentional and just put it in
[9:22] such words we realize if God's
[9:23] intentional then he's he has intent in
[9:25] anything that he allows to happen and
[9:27] anything that he overtly does and so it
[9:30] says the man and his wife if we put it
[9:32] this way the man and his wife are naked
[9:34] and not ashamed or naked and unashamed
[9:37] this expresses a very deep mystery in
[9:40] God's heart
[9:41] that's kind of a peculiar statement
[9:43] would you agree with me it's kind of an
[9:45] odd way to end the description of
[9:46] creation you got Genesis 1 and now we
[9:49] come to this point where it says and the
[9:50] man and his wife are naked and unashamed
[9:52] they're like well where do we go from
[9:54] here that's kind of an odd way to end it
[9:56] but this is this is something that God
[9:59] sets forward for us to think about and
[10:02] perhaps chew on a little bit and say
[10:04] well this is this is God summarizing
[10:06] creation
[10:08] and a lot we know that Love's great
[10:10] Mysteries bound up in the purpose of the
[10:12] earth God's heart purpose is to get a
[10:14] bride of his own choosing to it the
[10:16] Earth was created creation is for the
[10:18] purpose of God achieving a bride for
[10:21] himself and so when it says that naked
[10:24] and ashamed it kind of sets the man and
[10:26] his wife said the man and his wife were
[10:28] naked and not ashamed it sets them forth
[10:32] this is the key to the uh I think for
[10:34] you to catch if you want the end to make
[10:37] sense this is a really good point just
[10:39] to pay attention and if you wake up in
[10:41] about an hour it'll still all make sense
[10:43] if you just catch this part when he says
[10:46] this the man and his wife are both naked
[10:48] and not ashamed it's very simple
[10:50] description isn't it if you were given
[10:53] one sentence to describe Eden you'd find
[10:55] yourself with a lot of commas
[10:57] right and you'd want to just keep going
[11:00] and going how could I describe it one
[11:01] sentence but God God feels that he's got
[11:03] a great way to express it and he says
[11:05] and they were both naked the man and his
[11:07] wife and were not ashamed and he's happy
[11:09] with that he's happy to set it for us so
[11:11] he describes it in a very simple
[11:13] unadorned terms
[11:15] when he says then man and his wife were
[11:17] naked uh and unashamed this is it's very
[11:21] peculiar but it's a very very deep
[11:23] what's what's in this image is vast
[11:27] and he describes them
[11:29] as naked and unashamed and there's
[11:33] those two words together
[11:35] begin to create this picture for me and
[11:38] I felt this I just felt this something
[11:40] welling up inside of me I said that's it
[11:41] this is this is part of what God wants
[11:44] us to see he describes them this is the
[11:47] key as seeds that had not yet blossomed
[11:51] that they are naked and unashamed he's
[11:54] describing the way that here they are
[11:56] bear
[11:57] but yet there's no shame in that
[12:00] there's no loss in that he describes
[12:03] them I'm saying could we consider that
[12:06] when he says they were naked and
[12:07] unashamed that he's describing them
[12:09] unadorned and unblossomed or in such a
[12:13] way that we could see that they are bare
[12:15] and fruitless but yet they have they
[12:18] they are they have the potential inside
[12:20] of them
[12:21] because fruit we know is the Flesh of a
[12:24] seed
[12:24] and so there's something in that which
[12:26] says well they were naked and unashamed
[12:29] naked as bare and this has physical
[12:31] application it's also very descriptive
[12:33] of their minds and their hearts and
[12:34] their emotions I was pure and so this in
[12:38] this description of them they're naked
[12:39] but then he says not ashamed and the
[12:42] word means they were not disappointed
[12:44] or there was no lacking or there was uh
[12:47] no anxiety for lacking
[12:51] in other words there was they were naked
[12:54] but yet there was no shame
[12:56] they were there was no fruit
[12:59] but they were not disappointed
[13:01] because being naked and they're being
[13:03] bare they're there and it's not as if
[13:07] well there's no potential here there's
[13:08] no opportunity there's no way up there
[13:11] was all power and potential of provision
[13:13] was available in the seed
[13:17] all power and potential of provision is
[13:20] available in the creation
[13:22] so when God describes them as naked
[13:24] they're bare but they're not ashamed
[13:26] there's no anxiety if nothing is else is
[13:29] Manifest there's no anxiety as to their
[13:31] condition because there's power within
[13:33] themselves to produce what they have
[13:36] need of
[13:38] and so there is man and women the man
[13:40] and his wife were not ashamed although
[13:43] they were naked and that's Genesis 2 25
[13:46] that ends chapter 2 but then chapter one
[13:49] is in the beginning God created the
[13:52] Heaven and the Earth
[13:54] now with those two scriptures Genesis 1
[13:57] and Genesis 2 25 they frame a picture
[14:00] that God wants us to look at when we
[14:02] think of creation that in the beginning
[14:04] God created then the very last words as
[14:06] it relates to that scene and as he gives
[14:09] that final brush stroke to the picture
[14:11] that he's painting it's and they were
[14:12] both naked the man and his wife and were
[14:14] not ashamed so this is these are
[14:16] bookends uh that kind of give us the
[14:19] shading to say I'm emphasizing this
[14:23] remember how brother Brown said that was
[14:24] the beginning or in the beginning before
[14:26] Genesis 3 before that in the beginning
[14:28] was eternity and so this is God's
[14:31] emphasis about an eternal Eden and these
[14:34] two scriptures kind of frame it so that
[14:36] we can look to it and say this is the
[14:38] picture of God's perfection
[14:40] and he says in the beginning God created
[14:42] that heaven we know that's the
[14:43] Tabernacle of God and it is the
[14:46] Tabernacle of Elohim it's the there's
[14:48] the heaven of Heavens there's a realm
[14:50] there's a dimension that God creates and
[14:51] and it has uh it's the highest of all
[14:54] orders
[14:55] highest of all Dimensions when it says
[14:58] God created the Heaven that speaks of
[15:00] the first uh the supernatural if we kind
[15:03] of extend that even into the stars and
[15:05] the heavens we know that that's God's
[15:06] first Bible so even before the written
[15:09] bible God wrote his word in the stars
[15:11] and in the heavens and so God creates
[15:14] the heaven and he creates the Earth we
[15:15] say the land as opposed to the heavens
[15:17] and the atmospheres as you read and we
[15:20] touched on this before as you begin to
[15:22] read from that point on The Narrative of
[15:25] the Bible of creation is solely relates
[15:28] to the Earth and what comes out of the
[15:30] Earth
[15:31] and we look at these as the seed
[15:32] chapters
[15:33] chapter 1 chapter 2 God is sowing seeds
[15:37] and he says in the beginning God created
[15:39] heaven and earth they're set forth as a
[15:41] singular creation not God created the
[15:43] Heaven there's a lot of narrative and
[15:44] there's different things that happen
[15:45] then God creates the Earth so they're
[15:47] not they're not mentioned as uh in
[15:50] separate instances but he chooses to
[15:52] mention them together existing together
[15:55] not separately existing or against each
[15:57] other that God created the Heaven and
[15:59] that's great and then God could the
[16:00] Earth and there was this battle between
[16:01] Heaven and Earth and all that's not the
[16:03] way that God sets them forth
[16:06] and we know that the very first
[16:08] attributes and characteristics that God
[16:10] gives the Earth is the chaos
[16:12] and then the spirit of God moved upon
[16:13] the face of Earth and that so that we
[16:15] could recognize first God's image the
[16:17] the Covenant God expressed his ambition
[16:19] in Genesis 1. Heaven and Earth is a
[16:22] great beautiful expression
[16:23] and then he gives us this grace to
[16:25] recognize that all of our chaos he'll
[16:28] remedy as the spirit of God moves upon
[16:30] the face of the water and brings brings
[16:31] order to our lives and so brother random
[16:34] says this and and fall into part of the
[16:36] world
[16:37] I think I have the word there I'm
[16:38] putting all sorts of interesting Easter
[16:40] eggs in my titles or my slides these
[16:43] days but the one who created the Heaven
[16:45] and Earth expresses himself back through
[16:47] his creation what he is in his program
[16:51] so when God creates this is the
[16:53] principle God expresses himself
[16:56] we could say that about artists and and
[16:58] people in authors and those that write
[17:01] and draw on different things and write
[17:03] poems that there's something about the
[17:04] Creator that's expressed in the creation
[17:06] and God is no different the one who
[17:09] created the Heaven and the Earth
[17:11] expresses himself in his creation what
[17:14] he is in his program so if we call
[17:17] Genesis 1 and Genesis 2 his program or
[17:20] his creation then he's expressed in that
[17:23] what he is is expressed in that what his
[17:26] plan is what his system is what he's
[17:28] wanting to accomplish God expresses
[17:30] himself in it and God is expressed in
[17:33] Genesis 1 1.
[17:34] that first expression of the Heaven and
[17:36] the Earth it portrays the Heavenly
[17:38] bridegroom and the Earthly bride
[17:41] it's portrayed in the very first
[17:42] sentence of the Bible what God is going
[17:44] to achieve he's going to have a Heavenly
[17:45] bridegroom he's going to become an
[17:47] Earthly bride
[17:48] and Genesis 1 1 in the beginning God
[17:51] created the Heaven and the Earth
[17:54] there's
[17:56] one of the translations into it to the
[17:59] Hebrews I believe I may have gotten this
[18:01] from one of their writings it says God
[18:03] in the beginning created substance of
[18:05] the heavens and substance of the Earth
[18:09] so the principle was that when God
[18:11] created and I know that you see this in
[18:13] the message of hour when God created it
[18:15] wasn't that God just created everything
[18:16] it was just all there in an instance
[18:18] that God said let there be and then all
[18:21] of a sudden everything just appeared and
[18:23] everything was there and it's full
[18:24] maturity that when God spoke his word is
[18:27] a seed and as God spoke that there was
[18:29] this process of this unfolding and so
[18:32] the principle is in the beginning God
[18:35] brought God brought into existence
[18:37] they have the substance and the things
[18:40] and the elements that would make up the
[18:42] Heaven and the Earth
[18:43] so at the very initial outset in the
[18:46] beginning God created heaven and earth
[18:48] even in seed form
[18:50] maybe not in the same way that we would
[18:51] think about natural seed but in some way
[18:54] God when he begins he begins with some
[18:56] element and from that element it's going
[18:58] to come everything else it's a great
[19:00] principle here he does this for a reason
[19:02] the Bible says in John 1 1 to verse 3 in
[19:05] the beginning was the word and the Word
[19:07] was with God and the Word was God
[19:10] the same was in the beginning with God
[19:12] all things were made by him and without
[19:15] him was not anything made that was made
[19:18] said the seed the word is a seed that A
[19:21] sower sowed in the ground
[19:24] he's taken a lot from The Parables of
[19:25] Jesus he says it over and over and over
[19:26] again the word is a seed that the soul
[19:28] were sowed and so in the beginning God
[19:31] created the Heavenly Earth the the
[19:33] elements are there in the beginning God
[19:34] creates the the very things from which
[19:36] all Heavens will come forth the very
[19:38] things from with all which all Earth is
[19:39] going to come forth he sets them forth
[19:41] in seed form in the beginning was the
[19:44] word and I'm trying to tell you the word
[19:45] is a seed
[19:46] and Satan's Eden brother bear says the
[19:48] Holy Spirit of God's holy word had a man
[19:50] and woman naked and didn't know it how
[19:54] beautiful life of the word the seed the
[19:57] word
[19:58] now notice how he describes if we could
[20:00] say Genesis 1 1 to Genesis 2 25 brother
[20:03] bam describes it as man and woman naked
[20:07] he says how beautiful the seed the word
[20:11] this says and he said in the life of the
[20:15] word the man and the woman are naked and
[20:17] not ashamed now think of them they're
[20:19] unadorned but there's potential brother
[20:21] Adam says here they are the Holy Spirit
[20:23] had man and woman naked and they didn't
[20:25] know it but they were not ashamed and he
[20:27] says how beautiful life of the word the
[20:30] seed the word in the beginning was the
[20:32] word in the beginning we see seed
[20:35] and God's power to transform he says God
[20:37] in six thousand years had planted all
[20:40] these wonderful seeds or he had spoke
[20:42] his word it shall be this way this tree
[20:44] shall be this shall be everything was
[20:47] perfect it was just good
[20:51] and he commanded each one of those seeds
[20:54] that they would be catch this they would
[20:58] transform themselves into the plant of
[21:02] which kind of life that the word of God
[21:04] had spoken in them should be
[21:07] remember in Genesis 1 how the life was
[21:10] in the seed to bring forth of its kind
[21:11] and after its kind and it was within
[21:14] itself and the flesh uh the seed which
[21:17] had flesh had power within itself to
[21:19] reproduce itself and that's all there in
[21:21] Genesis 1 and I didn't I didn't want to
[21:23] get bogged down and just looking at that
[21:24] because I think these statements are so
[21:26] good at summarizing he commanded each
[21:28] one of those seeds that they would trans
[21:29] with power in them to transform
[21:31] themselves into the plant that the word
[21:34] of God said they would be
[21:36] if it was an oak tree it'd bring forth
[21:37] an oak it was a palm it'd bring forth a
[21:39] palm
[21:41] because the great Creator had just sent
[21:44] forth his word and the word seed was
[21:47] there before the realed seed was ever
[21:49] formed
[21:51] and the word formed the seed now there's
[21:54] the
[21:55] there's an expression of Heaven and
[21:56] Earth
[21:57] that you have the word seeds there
[21:59] before the next Parts formed and said
[22:02] the word formed the seed see he made the
[22:04] world out of things that do not appear
[22:07] he made the world by his word God spoke
[22:11] everything into existence
[22:16] okay are we together in this
[22:19] now so in the beginning God created the
[22:22] Heaven and the Earth
[22:23] and then he says and in this with the
[22:26] man and his wife were both naked and not
[22:28] ashamed
[22:30] now there is uh there's a manifestation
[22:32] there's a picture that God's painted but
[22:34] what I would like to present
[22:38] is that even that is seed form
[22:43] even that in itself
[22:45] is just a beginning
[22:47] now in Matthew Chapter 13 let's look at
[22:49] verse 36 we read verses 24 to 30 wherein
[22:53] Jesus says the Kingdom of Heaven is
[22:56] likened unto a man which sowed good seed
[22:58] in his field
[23:01] so now in verse 36 then Jesus sent the
[23:04] multitude away and went into the house
[23:06] and his disciples came unto him said
[23:08] saying declare unto us the parable of
[23:10] the tares of the field in other words
[23:12] it's given unto us to know the mysteries
[23:15] of the Kingdom of Heaven unto them it is
[23:17] not given as you said yourself Jesus so
[23:20] now that we are alone could you declare
[23:22] and open up to us what you meant by the
[23:24] parable of the tares of the field he
[23:27] answered and said unto them he that
[23:29] soweth the good seed is the son of man
[23:34] now we can see this in creation this is
[23:37] so this is such a large thought that
[23:39] this is in no way I'm not putting a
[23:40] period on this I'm not an always say
[23:42] this is the way you've got to see it I'm
[23:43] only looking at it from a very very
[23:44] small angle he says the son of man is
[23:48] the one that sowed the good seed
[23:49] remember in his field
[23:51] is it in somebody's plot of land
[23:54] God created the Heaven and the Earth
[23:56] seed is sown in the earth it's his
[24:00] and he says the field is the world God
[24:03] created the world for a purpose
[24:05] the good seat are the children of the
[24:08] Kingdom
[24:09] so that this is God's desire he's always
[24:12] moving toward the kingdom
[24:14] and he says but the cares are the
[24:16] children of the wicked one
[24:18] the enemy that sold them is the devil
[24:21] now catch this the Harvest is the end of
[24:25] the world and the reapers are the Angels
[24:29] and therefore the tares are gathered and
[24:31] burned in the fire so shall it be in the
[24:34] end of this world now and he says this
[24:37] remember in the parable
[24:39] they said oh
[24:41] should we should we root out the tares
[24:43] now
[24:46] I'm just looking around making sure
[24:47] everybody's awake
[24:49] because if they're asleep and they don't
[24:52] get if they're not following each word
[24:54] there's gonna you can have a lot of
[24:55] explaining to do later
[24:58] at this moment as we see and I hope
[25:01] Genesis 1 is still in view Genesis 2 25
[25:03] and that picture that we've already
[25:04] framed we know in Genesis 3 The Wicked
[25:06] one it comes sows into Humanity a
[25:08] mongrelizing another seed that changes
[25:10] everything
[25:12] so now the the thought is why don't we
[25:15] just root out
[25:17] that seed
[25:19] why don't we just bleed out the terror
[25:21] why don't we just breed that out why
[25:23] don't we just get rid of that he says no
[25:25] no no Let It Grow
[25:28] let both grow together until the Harvest
[25:32] now what happens in the Harvest the
[25:34] seeds have reached they're full maturity
[25:37] the seeds have proven what they are it's
[25:40] a full plant it has seed mature seed
[25:43] inside of it so everything's grow up the
[25:45] fruit is perfect the fruit is mature and
[25:46] the seed on the inside would produce
[25:48] exactly what's on the inside of it any
[25:51] earlier it's no good any later would be
[25:52] no good there it's at the furthest
[25:55] advancement of the seed at the time of
[25:57] the Harvest because Jesus says
[25:59] immediately they thrust forth the sickle
[26:00] and harvest and so he says let them grow
[26:03] together until the Harvest because if
[26:06] you go too early
[26:08] you'll uproot the wheat along with the
[26:10] tears
[26:12] so now try not to get ahead of myself
[26:16] this is this to me is just floors me
[26:19] when I see this
[26:20] the the the the the the
[26:22] wisdom of God to say oh no no no you
[26:25] can't do that because he knows if you
[26:27] move in too quickly to uproot the tears
[26:30] he's like don't do that
[26:32] because I've already sewn wheat
[26:35] that's already in there
[26:37] and at any moment this happens too
[26:40] quickly then all the children of the
[26:43] Kingdom will not be made manifest
[26:45] you want to know why we're still here
[26:48] there's no there's still wheat
[26:51] that's got to come up
[26:53] and so this once that once that wheat
[26:57] has manifest the last germ has manifest
[26:59] then God has no other purpose for time
[27:04] ponder that for a while
[27:07] he said the Harvest is the end of the
[27:09] world so it's at the end of the world
[27:10] because he said let him grow up together
[27:11] until the Harvest until everything's
[27:13] come up out of the ground the sun amount
[27:15] shall send forth his angels and they
[27:17] Shall Gather out of his kingdom
[27:20] all things that offend
[27:22] Ed so the kingdom is what he wants
[27:27] he doesn't doesn't take the seeds and
[27:29] Transplant them into another world
[27:31] he gathers them out all things out of
[27:32] his kingdom the things that offend out
[27:34] of his kingdom he had a field he had it
[27:36] sowed he had it framed somebody else
[27:38] sold something in it he's going to
[27:40] address that and get rid of all the
[27:41] tears out of his kingdom
[27:45] it says and they shall be cast
[27:47] and shall cast them into a furnace of
[27:49] fire there shall be wailing and gnashing
[27:51] of teeth then shall the righteous shine
[27:53] forth as the Son and the kingdom of
[27:56] their father
[27:58] now that that brings a Jew to the
[28:00] kingdom
[28:00] that's where they're thinking Daniel
[28:02] chapter 2 Daniel chapter seven and now
[28:04] it's saying that the children of the
[28:06] Kingdom shall shine as the son
[28:10] now think of what the how Jesus there'll
[28:12] be no need of the son and how they'll be
[28:14] he'll be the light now the kingdom
[28:17] light
[28:18] the righteous shine forth as the son he
[28:21] says who have ears to hear Let Them hear
[28:25] now so that we could bring this Orient
[28:28] you to
[28:30] Genesis 2 25 brother Bannon takes this
[28:34] Parable and he says
[28:35] uh well brother Ram takes the in the
[28:37] beginning and he said that God placed
[28:39] all his seeds there
[28:41] and he said how did we what happened how
[28:43] do we come up with all these perverted
[28:45] seeds
[28:46] and he says in power of transformation
[28:49] and if I could say some sermons if
[28:51] you're looking for sermons to listen to
[28:52] and read uh
[28:54] God's power to transform
[28:57] and power of transformation
[28:59] and and future home in Christ the
[29:02] mystery just real short
[29:03] easy reading for you to dig into there
[29:07] or even the sermon on remarriage if you
[29:10] wanted to dig into that a little bit he
[29:12] says in all this great thing node would
[29:18] he could take a rest
[29:20] Genesis 1 Genesis 2 25 everything's
[29:22] there God can rest everything under
[29:25] control his seed was his word and his
[29:28] word is a seed Jesus said it was and
[29:31] everything would be all right because he
[29:33] said for to bring forth of its kind
[29:34] transforming only to its kind
[29:37] and so God sold all of his seeds into
[29:40] the Earth
[29:41] and then God took a rest
[29:44] on the seventh day he rested because it
[29:47] had all laid out there it was all there
[29:48] he could rest and then Brothers says
[29:50] when God spoke it he knew his word was a
[29:53] seed and it could bring forth of its
[29:55] kind
[29:57] so God created all the seed is in the
[30:00] Earth
[30:00] and he says he could rest because the
[30:02] seeds there in other words God doesn't
[30:04] need to add anything to manifest what he
[30:07] wants to manifest now if you could catch
[30:09] this it's all in the earth so God
[30:11] doesn't necessarily need to create
[30:13] anything again
[30:15] because the seed has already been spoken
[30:17] it's spoken as a word so in Genesis 1
[30:19] and Genesis 2 God somehow has already
[30:22] spoken
[30:23] all the word that'll ever manifest he
[30:26] says its first word then it materializes
[30:28] even Jesus Christ is the manifestation
[30:31] of Genesis 1 28. he says that word
[30:34] spoken brought forth flesh when it
[30:37] caught in the womb of Mary and brought
[30:39] forth Jesus and he was the beginning of
[30:41] the creation of God so God didn't have
[30:43] to speak again
[30:46] everything that he had ought was going
[30:48] to create was somehow I know it's kind
[30:51] of beyond our thinking but somehow God
[30:53] had spoken it and it was their invisible
[30:56] Supernatural in the heavens as it were
[30:59] waiting to materialize into something
[31:02] tangible
[31:04] and then so this is God now he's going
[31:06] to rest he's framed it Genesis 1 1
[31:08] Genesis 25. he's going to rest and then
[31:10] while God was sleeping is what some
[31:12] places Etc as God is resting Satan
[31:14] slipped in
[31:15] and in God's power to transform her
[31:17] power transformation he says now here
[31:19] comes that slimy dirty Deceiver
[31:21] right he brought around is going to
[31:24] Great Lengths in those sermons to show
[31:25] us this is God everything's laid out
[31:27] then why do we see the sin we have
[31:29] because the devil slipped in as the
[31:32] wicked one who sowed tares in God's
[31:35] field
[31:36] he's the one that sowed the false seed
[31:38] into the kingdom he's the one that broke
[31:41] the frame of Genesis 2 25 and Genesis 1
[31:43] 1. he's the one that came in and
[31:45] interrupted things now we say oh oh no
[31:48] but brother Adam says when Satan did
[31:50] that which was necessary to fulfill the
[31:52] plan of God because that Adam always
[31:54] remained in Eden he would have never
[31:56] known who God was he would have only
[31:58] known him as this really awesome dude
[31:59] that comes down in the evenings and
[32:00] walks with me and I think he made all
[32:03] this
[32:04] right I think I'm pretty sure God's the
[32:07] reason why all this is here and he would
[32:08] have known him as a Creator and he would
[32:10] have known him as one who could walk
[32:11] with him and it just wouldn't God would
[32:13] be like man he doesn't even know the
[32:14] half of me
[32:16] so God could not be fully expressed with
[32:19] just that frame so although we can say
[32:23] it was Perfection and it was Sublime God
[32:26] still even sets himself forth in seed
[32:30] form in the beginning
[32:33] oh
[32:40] in Genesis 2 4-7
[32:44] now Genesis chapter 2 verses 4 to 7.
[32:48] it says and these are the generations
[32:52] of the heavens and of the Earth
[32:55] when they were created in the day that
[32:58] the Lord God made the earth and the
[33:01] heavens these are the generations these
[33:03] are the results in the products
[33:05] of the heavens and the Earth
[33:07] this is what was within it the day that
[33:09] it was recreated because to say these
[33:11] are the generations so it's what
[33:13] heaven's generated what Earth generated
[33:15] because it's what sprung forth from it
[33:18] right
[33:19] so if a seed generated something we
[33:21] wouldn't say oh this seed kind of went
[33:23] out there and moved it so around and
[33:25] moved that around and created something
[33:26] no it was in the seed
[33:28] if if a seed grows and plant and brings
[33:31] something forth oh that was within it
[33:34] that's the generation of so it is the
[33:37] result or the product of these are the
[33:39] generations of the heavens and the earth
[33:41] when they were created and the day that
[33:43] the Lord God made the earth and the
[33:44] heavens in other words this is seed and
[33:46] this is what's within the seed and
[33:47] notice it says in every plant of the
[33:49] field before it was in the earth and
[33:51] every herb of the field before it grew
[33:54] in other words there was no shrub in the
[33:56] field yet in the earth no herb of the
[33:59] field had yet sprung up
[34:00] but the plant and the herb were already
[34:02] in the earth in seed form by the spoken
[34:06] word of God
[34:07] had already put it in there by the
[34:09] spoken word and though you don't see it
[34:11] as of yet the Bible tells us this is
[34:13] what's within the heavens this is what's
[34:15] within the earth when they were created
[34:18] every plant and every herb
[34:21] you know it's how we could even say that
[34:23] that makes it even more pronounced what
[34:25] brother Adams said the great Creator
[34:27] sent forth his word and the Word was a
[34:29] seed before the real seed was ever
[34:30] formed so there it was supernaturally
[34:33] spoken by God and this is the Bible
[34:35] saying that these are the generations
[34:37] this is the power and potential that's
[34:39] there every plant before it was in the
[34:41] earth and every herb before it grew
[34:43] existed first by word seed
[34:48] because this is for the Lord God had not
[34:49] caused it to Reign upon the Earth and
[34:51] there was not a man to till the ground
[34:53] so it's there already sown into the
[34:55] Earth the spoken word is already placed
[34:58] it there within the Earth but there went
[35:00] up a mist from the earth and watered the
[35:02] whole face of the ground now as we pause
[35:03] on that we say this is then the process
[35:06] of God's creation because that's going
[35:08] to allow whether it be some sort of
[35:10] germination and bringing forth of what
[35:12] was in there so in the earth God speaks
[35:15] there's seed now there's actual seed in
[35:17] the earth and it has not yet produced
[35:19] plant or tree or fruit until the next
[35:22] stage of development and God allows the
[35:25] water to then cause it to grow
[35:28] these are the generations
[35:30] of the heavens and the Earth
[35:33] and and now we get this image of all of
[35:35] a sudden now plant life is growing and
[35:37] then when brother Branham describes the
[35:39] formation of Adam I think baby describes
[35:42] it even as his toes is root Roots into
[35:45] the soil so now notice what it says in
[35:48] verse 7 and the Lord God formed man of
[35:51] the Dust of the ground and breathed into
[35:54] his nostrils the breath of life and Man
[35:57] became a living soul
[35:59] just as the plants were already in the
[36:01] Earth
[36:02] and just as the herb were already in the
[36:05] earth and the trees were on the earth
[36:06] man's body was already in the Earth
[36:09] so there was just these are the
[36:11] generations of Heaven and Earth man was
[36:13] first formed spirit being first
[36:15] Supernatural that gives him his Affinity
[36:17] with the heavens but now the heavens
[36:20] have a have a body in the earth already
[36:23] and so when God loves us water to come
[36:25] forth and each seed is bringing forth of
[36:27] its kind it's only natural that the body
[36:30] of man would come up at the same time
[36:32] because the body was already in the
[36:34] earth and it says and God formed it
[36:37] you know what that word formed is in the
[36:38] Hebrew predetermined it
[36:41] God predetermined the body in the earth
[36:45] God pre-ordained so it says God Lord God
[36:48] formed man of the Dust of the ground it
[36:51] wasn't that God said hmm now let's see
[36:53] what would work here what would work
[36:54] here it's almost as if when God spoke it
[36:58] and then the time came for the seeds to
[37:00] come forth man just came right up with
[37:01] it because God's spoken word had said it
[37:05] and when the season came for to manifest
[37:06] God didn't have to Scurry around and get
[37:08] everything ready it was just there in
[37:09] its seasoned to come right up
[37:15] that's why the Bible says in Genesis 3
[37:16] 18 and 19 Thor's Thorns also in thistle
[37:19] shall it bring forth Thee the land the
[37:20] Earth
[37:21] and thou shalt eat the herb of the field
[37:23] I really recommend I believe the last
[37:25] sermon we preached saw him here I am
[37:27] plugging my own channel I guess I really
[37:30] think you should listen to that to think
[37:31] about how the Earth was subject to a
[37:33] curse
[37:34] until Malachi 4 came
[37:37] and here the Earth is cursed and thorns
[37:39] and thistles bring forth from uh the
[37:43] ground and thou shall eat the herb of
[37:44] the field this is this is wasn't so
[37:46] there Susan in the sweat of thy face
[37:49] shall thou eat bread till thou return
[37:50] unto the ground for out of it was thou
[37:52] taken from thus Thou Art and unto thus
[37:54] shalt thou return
[37:56] the body returns to the ground where it
[37:58] was originally planted
[38:01] that's exactly where it goes back to it
[38:03] goes right back into the ground where
[38:04] God had originally planted it
[38:05] Ecclesiastes he says then shall the dust
[38:07] return to the Earth as it was
[38:09] and the spirit shall return unto God who
[38:11] gave it
[38:12] but I can say this this isn't the end
[38:15] think of this
[38:17] as it says you were taken out of the
[38:19] Dust
[38:20] and you go back to the Dust
[38:22] it is the permissive will of God
[38:24] to bring it back around to his perfect
[38:26] will
[38:27] God didn't allow all those elements to
[38:29] disintegrate and disappear forever
[38:31] that when man was formed from the ground
[38:33] he followed me are you with me when man
[38:36] was formed from the ground God allowed
[38:38] death to put it back in the place where
[38:40] it was before
[38:41] Now Catch what brother Brown says I
[38:44] could read to you maybe a dozen
[38:45] statements I'll only read to you two of
[38:47] them
[38:48] and of how brother Branham addresses
[38:50] this particular
[38:52] the thing that I'm wanting to bring
[38:54] before you this morning and the sermon
[38:56] turned on the light he says no life can
[38:58] come outside of light
[39:00] light produces light produces life
[39:04] there could be no life outside of light
[39:06] natural or spiritual there must be
[39:09] only light can come by the word of God
[39:11] God's word is a light when it's
[39:13] manifested these sermons that he
[39:15] preaches here in early 64. a lot of few
[39:18] of them in Arizona
[39:19] on uh turn on the light in Shalom
[39:21] there's a man here could turn on all
[39:23] those different things it's almost as if
[39:25] he could just write down everything he
[39:26] said yeah
[39:27] and so I just bought a highlighter about
[39:28] this big and went through the spoken
[39:30] wordbook
[39:32] because I didn't actually do that but
[39:34] it's it's just that powerful every step
[39:36] it's like get that oh yeah that that
[39:37] that
[39:38] so notice how each one of those is like
[39:40] principle principle principle he says
[39:42] there must be only light can come by the
[39:44] word of God God's word is light when
[39:46] it's manifested he said it's just a seed
[39:49] laying there
[39:50] as God planted all the seeds
[39:54] our bodies were on the earth before
[39:57] there was any life here or anything
[40:01] right
[40:02] the calcium POTUS petroleum Cosmic light
[40:05] whatever it was here when God created
[40:07] the Earth
[40:08] other words when God created the Earth
[40:11] he didn't just say well hmm dirt seems
[40:14] good or he's working on something over
[40:15] here let's say he's trying to create a
[40:16] star what do I do with this this is kind
[40:18] of grainy you know what I'll use this
[40:21] over here
[40:22] and used it to form the Earth he
[40:24] actually when he made the Earth he used
[40:26] elements that he wanted to use to make
[40:28] your body
[40:30] and if I can make this even more brother
[40:32] Brahm said the natural birth is even
[40:34] more Supernatural to him
[40:36] how that God watched out over jeans
[40:38] since the beginning
[40:40] that were already in the earth and knew
[40:43] just the way to watch over all of it so
[40:45] that it would produce you
[40:48] there's no AI out there that can do it
[40:51] hey this is what God he's saying our
[40:54] bodies were on the earth before there
[40:55] was any life there or anything the
[40:57] calcium pots petroleum caused me like
[40:58] whatever it was was here when God
[41:00] created the Earth
[41:01] it only took his spoken word to bring it
[41:03] into existence listen please just like
[41:06] it did botany life
[41:08] or tree life here it is oh whatever
[41:10] whatever life there is to be
[41:15] hell yeah but God had the prophet saved
[41:17] that he said that the seed is already
[41:19] there God planted all seeds our bodies
[41:22] were laying there and it takes the
[41:25] spoken word of God to bring it into
[41:26] existence whether it be botany life tree
[41:29] life or whatever life
[41:32] whatever life there is to be
[41:37] it's a transforming power in the seed
[41:40] Amen brother Adam said maybe hundreds
[41:42] and hundreds of years passed
[41:45] all this season there may be hundreds
[41:47] and hundreds of years passed but in its
[41:49] season it manifested botany life in a
[41:51] seasoned tree life manifested all the
[41:54] seeds there and brothers says it may
[41:56] take he's hundreds and hundreds of years
[41:58] could I say maybe even thousands of
[42:00] years
[42:01] but whatever life is to be
[42:04] it'll come up
[42:07] think deeply about these implications
[42:10] think very deeply about what it what the
[42:13] uh
[42:14] what is being
[42:16] implied
[42:18] in all of our bodies we're here on Earth
[42:22] and the sermon
[42:24] future home of the Heavenly bridegroom
[42:26] and the Earthly bride I hope I spelled
[42:28] everything right there
[42:29] he said this Earth holds those things
[42:32] but it wasn't made for that purpose what
[42:35] things thorns and thistles
[42:38] sin cause it to be like that
[42:40] and when I say these things is I'm
[42:43] referring to a lot of the things we see
[42:44] now
[42:45] because science brought these things
[42:48] but he's saying that's not what the
[42:50] purpose was
[42:51] sin caused to be like that it was made
[42:53] by God the Creator
[42:55] and all our bodies that we live in now
[42:59] were put on the earth when God created
[43:01] it because you are Out of the Dust of
[43:04] the earth it was all laid out here
[43:08] now when a a builder lays his material
[43:11] out he doesn't just
[43:14] you know kind of back the trailer up and
[43:16] then speed off and then just let
[43:18] everything just slide out
[43:20] right they lay things out in a logical
[43:23] way
[43:24] even as brother Joel Ray was showing us
[43:26] this uh
[43:27] this high tower the skyrise that they're
[43:30] building there in Vancouver and just the
[43:32] levels that they start with and the
[43:34] things that they have to build before
[43:36] they can build
[43:37] and the things that have to be in place
[43:39] so they can place the things that they
[43:41] need to have in place in order to place
[43:42] the things they need to have the
[43:44] building
[43:45] and so when they lay everything out and
[43:46] they plan everything out and if you
[43:48] haven't planned it properly all of a
[43:49] sudden things will bog down and slow way
[43:51] down it's like oh we didn't know if we
[43:53] had this set right we need to do this we
[43:55] need to do that he says when God himself
[43:56] began to create he says everything is
[43:59] laid out here
[44:00] when God himself created himself created
[44:03] you are in his thinking
[44:05] so as he's as he is laying it all out
[44:08] here you're in his mind
[44:11] so he's very deliberate I'm gonna put
[44:13] this here I'm gonna put that there he's
[44:16] laying everything out of this great
[44:17] master builder when God created it urine
[44:20] is thinking and in him the great Eternal
[44:21] was the thought which is his attribute
[44:24] and now sin caused all this to happen
[44:27] and God through this age is gathering up
[44:32] his material
[44:34] he's Gathering up his material he didn't
[44:36] lay the material out in this age he laid
[44:39] the material in Genesis 1 but it's in
[44:41] this age that he gathers up all the
[44:43] material that he meticulously laid out
[44:47] oh Hallelujah
[44:50] already laid there in the earth the
[44:52] seeds of the Kingdom
[44:58] so when he says that they were both
[45:00] naked the man and his wife and were not
[45:02] ashamed we say that's the family
[45:04] portrait Genesis 1 1 to Genesis 2 25.
[45:07] it's the mystery of Heaven expressed in
[45:09] the glory of the man and his wife
[45:12] naked unashamed as seeds
[45:15] I think deeply about this I'm making I'm
[45:18] making great time I'm doing awesome
[45:22] brother Aaron you're doing awesome
[45:23] you're doing good on time
[45:27] I think very concentrate with me I could
[45:29] I can wrap this up very quickly
[45:32] in seed form
[45:36] think very deeply very spiritually about
[45:37] this now
[45:39] God has always been moving towards the
[45:41] kingdom
[45:42] the seeds of the Kingdom were sown in
[45:44] Genesis 1.
[45:46] what God was going to achieve
[45:49] now this is if you listen to the end of
[45:51] this series on Wednesday
[45:53] then you'll understand what I was
[45:55] leading up to when I say this
[45:57] that the the Earth was not intended to
[46:00] be the Devil's Playground
[46:03] God didn't say let's give the devil a
[46:05] Sandbox to play in
[46:07] let's see what this backslidden angel
[46:09] can do
[46:10] so let's just create a Sandbox right
[46:12] where he can play in with all his
[46:14] viruses and everything he wants to do
[46:15] and we can just contain it here
[46:17] just to see what it does and then we can
[46:19] see how we can attack it and how we can
[46:20] address it that in some ways is how
[46:23] nominal religion wants us to view the
[46:26] Earth as a Sandbox for the devil to get
[46:28] all his viruses out and all his bad
[46:31] errors and all his poor programming out
[46:33] and it can all do this and it won't
[46:34] affect everything not going to affect
[46:36] eternity we're gonna let the devil make
[46:38] all his mistakes and then we'll we'll
[46:40] figure out what all those mistakes are
[46:42] and then we'll just kind of correct it
[46:43] in eternity and then we'll banish
[46:44] everything else to hell for eternity
[46:47] that's not time wasn't the time's
[46:49] purpose is not only for evil
[46:53] and so if we could begin to attack this
[46:56] idea that the Earth is a Devil's
[46:58] Playground and and time is only for evil
[47:01] then we can then it helps us to
[47:03] understand then the climate the darkest
[47:05] of all ages the climax of Satan's
[47:07] kingdom I want to look more at the
[47:08] Satan's kingdom the kingdoms of this
[47:09] world you're called to manifest the
[47:12] kingdom
[47:13] right now right here
[47:15] now wait until we get to White Throne
[47:17] judgment and say well what do you think
[47:19] you know did I make it
[47:21] and then and then we can shine as the
[47:24] sun oh there's something that has to
[47:26] happen now
[47:27] now First Corinthians chapter 15 verse
[47:30] 35 I'm gonna read to verse 49.
[47:34] and I'm going to read in a few other
[47:37] sermons
[47:40] and and a couple other places in
[47:42] Revelation and I may do this quickly
[47:45] because I'm just right at that spot
[47:46] where I can't stop now
[47:47] and
[47:49] um and and but I don't want to belabor
[47:51] some of it so I'll just come back to it
[47:52] at another point now you're thinking
[47:54] deeply you're thinking spiritually
[47:57] and maybe I'll just set this up for
[47:59] another time notice how Paul writes this
[48:02] because brother bam said in that
[48:03] threefold mystery of his of God his body
[48:06] that we're to bring the message in the
[48:08] last days and be taken up from the dead
[48:09] and the resurrection in this age he's
[48:12] Gathering up his material
[48:13] right there's a gathering up of all the
[48:15] material there's going to be those that
[48:17] shall not sleep
[48:18] it shall be changed but still all the
[48:20] material is going to be gathered up
[48:22] so he says
[48:23] he says this first Corinthians 15 start
[48:26] with verse 35 but some man will say I
[48:28] love how Paul anticipates the objection
[48:33] how are the dead raised up and with what
[48:35] body do they come
[48:39] well tell us what you really feel Paul
[48:40] thou full
[48:43] that which thou sowest is not quickened
[48:46] except it die
[48:50] this is a principle that we see in
[48:52] nature
[48:53] it's not quickened except it die
[49:01] oh how the devil
[49:04] the wicked one is snared in the works of
[49:06] his own hands
[49:08] the pit which he had dug for me he has
[49:10] fallen into the midst of himself he
[49:12] didn't know that death was necessary to
[49:15] Quicken the seed
[49:18] I know what I'll do I'll bring death and
[49:20] God's like oh look you do
[49:23] what'd you say nothing
[49:25] do what you need to
[49:27] whatever you do don't throw me in that
[49:28] Briar Patch right
[49:32] now fool that which I saw us is not
[49:34] quick and accept it die
[49:35] and that which thou sowest
[49:38] thou sawest not that body that shall be
[49:43] but bear or naked grain
[49:47] it may chance of wheat or some other
[49:49] grain you saw naked seed
[49:52] you don't sow the fruit the fullness
[49:57] you don't saw it in the glory that it
[49:59] will be
[50:01] you saw it and what it is
[50:04] but God giveth a body as it hath pleased
[50:07] him and to every seed I'm not gonna be
[50:09] able to read it today but he says in
[50:10] verse 51 behold I show you a mystery
[50:13] he's been speaking a mystery well before
[50:15] he says that and he gets to the
[50:17] resurrection of the seeds or the Harvest
[50:18] of the seeds but he's saying that God
[50:21] God will this is he's hearkening back to
[50:24] Genesis 1. he says God giveth the body
[50:26] as it pleased him this goes back to the
[50:29] languages Genesis 1 11 and the seed
[50:31] within itself to transform itself whose
[50:33] body is within itself whose life is
[50:34] within itself
[50:36] it's already in the seed to transform
[50:38] though it may be there naked and bare
[50:40] and it may look a particular way it's a
[50:42] seed and once it's gone through the
[50:44] process it'll bring forth the power and
[50:46] life that's inside of it that you don't
[50:48] yet see it may look beautiful now but
[50:50] you just wait you just wait when the
[50:53] life I gave it and the purpose I gave it
[50:55] just wait till it's Quicken
[51:00] God gave it a body as he had pleased him
[51:02] and to every seed
[51:04] this is God's program this is God's plan
[51:08] it gave it a body that's appropriate
[51:11] for whatever life there is to be
[51:14] thank you
[51:15] for whatever life there is to be
[51:19] so notice how beautiful this is all
[51:21] flesh is not the same flesh
[51:23] but there is one kind of Flesh of men
[51:25] another flesh of Beast another fishes
[51:27] and another of birds there are also
[51:30] celestial bodies embodies terrestrial
[51:33] but the glory of the celestial is one
[51:38] and the glory of the terrestrial is
[51:40] another there is one glory of the son
[51:42] and another glory of the Moon another
[51:43] glory of the stars but for one star
[51:45] different from another star in glory so
[51:47] also is the resurrection of the Dead
[51:51] how is it the dead are gonna be raised
[51:53] he says do you not know the principle of
[51:55] the seed do you not know that unless
[51:56] that body is sown into the Earth it
[51:58] cannot come up again and there may be
[52:00] one Glory that you see but the body that
[52:02] is sown is not the body that comes up
[52:05] it is sun and Corruption it is raised in
[52:08] incorruption it is sown in dishonor it
[52:10] is raised in glory it is sun and
[52:12] weakness it is raised in power it is
[52:15] sown a natural body
[52:17] is this raised a spiritual body there is
[52:20] a natural body and there is a spiritual
[52:22] body
[52:25] well he's preaching
[52:27] he is preaching and so it is written
[52:30] notice where he comes to the first Adam
[52:33] was made a living Soul the last Adam was
[52:37] made a quickening spirit
[52:39] how be it that was not first which is
[52:41] spiritual but that which is natural and
[52:43] afterward that which is spiritual the
[52:45] first man is of the earth earthy and the
[52:48] second man is the Lord of Heaven
[52:50] [Music]
[52:51] but is there not Redemption for that
[52:54] it's not not what the second Adam means
[52:57] Earth
[52:58] Heaven the first is natural the second
[53:01] is Supernatural
[53:03] as is the earthy so are they also that
[53:06] are earthy
[53:08] and as and as is the heavenly
[53:11] such are they also that are Heavenly and
[53:13] you can almost say there's one glory and
[53:15] there's another Glory
[53:16] there's earthy there's Heavenly there's
[53:18] first Adam there's last Adam but then
[53:20] notice what he says and as we
[53:22] have borne the image of the earthy
[53:26] we shall also bear the image of a
[53:29] heavenly
[53:31] look what he's just done that you who
[53:34] born the earthy who have come from the
[53:37] earth you too
[53:39] that will bear the heavenly
[53:43] for we shall be changed
[53:46] behold I show your mystery what is it
[53:49] it's the mystery of Heaven the mystery
[53:51] of Heaven is Earth and Glory
[53:55] we bear the image of the Earthly we'll
[53:57] bear the image of the heavenly
[53:59] this is the seeds of the Kingdom in
[54:01] Genesis 1.
[54:02] this is that no they'll come to their
[54:04] Harvest
[54:05] though Adam and the woman were there
[54:07] naked in Paris seeds God allowed him to
[54:09] go into the ground and every man after
[54:12] Adam has gone into the ground but just
[54:14] as we have borne the image of the earthy
[54:16] we will bear the image of the heavenly
[54:19] we will come into full manifestation
[54:25] in the sermon marriage and divorce
[54:27] Broadband says Genesis the seed chapter
[54:29] to every question in the Bible
[54:31] go I have to go back to the seed to see
[54:33] what kind of seed is in the field
[54:35] to find out what crops shall be this is
[54:37] the principle in First Corinthians 15.
[54:39] it's the principle in Matthew 13.
[54:42] now what kind of seed is on Genesis
[54:44] being the seed chapter we'd go back to
[54:45] Genesis
[54:47] remember
[54:49] good seed was sown
[54:51] right good seed was sown
[54:55] seeds of the Kingdom
[54:58] now
[55:00] the good seed that was sown
[55:02] I hope I'm not just opening up a
[55:04] gigantic Cavern
[55:06] that we need to mine out
[55:08] but before you even begin to think for a
[55:10] second
[55:12] that there's anything good
[55:14] and this
[55:17] I remember brother Donnie Reagan took a
[55:19] lot of heat for dramatizing someone
[55:21] combing their hair and saying
[55:23] look look and says you know something
[55:25] along the lines I look at you your
[55:27] serpent seed
[55:29] all right I didn't know why he took so
[55:31] much grief over it because we're born
[55:33] between Eve and Satan
[55:35] all right this flash is hybrid
[55:37] but God sowed good seed
[55:41] s seeds of the Kingdom
[55:44] so in Genesis 1 it's just the beginning
[55:46] and brother bam says in the sermon
[55:48] Satan's Eden having faith in all his
[55:50] word his seeds
[55:52] brought in Eden of Holiness love and
[55:54] eternal life this is just the beginning
[55:55] this is what he frames with Genesis 2
[55:57] 25. that's what God's Eden produced
[55:59] Holiness and it brought in Eden of
[56:01] Holiness of love understanding
[56:03] Perfection and eternal life that's what
[56:05] God planted
[56:06] that's a seed though
[56:08] because he says and in the end he said
[56:10] that's what God is planting his word his
[56:13] seed that's what his church will be at
[56:15] the end it'll be the same thing
[56:18] so I want to go quickly so that you can
[56:21] that we you can catch this perfect
[56:23] symmetry
[56:24] I'm going to fast forward to Revelations
[56:26] 21 because Barbara says this is what God
[56:28] was planting the beginning of the seed
[56:31] and and he and this is Paul is saying
[56:33] well if we born the image of the earthy
[56:35] and Adam was raised he was a a living
[56:37] soul and he was formed from the Earth
[56:39] but then when Christ comes and there's
[56:41] the key is all there in Christ the
[56:42] mystery is hidden Christ everything is
[56:44] there hidden in him he said he is now a
[56:47] quickening spirit
[56:49] and and if you if you you take that to
[56:52] what Paul is saying previously do you
[56:54] not realize that that which it's not
[56:56] quick and accept it die
[56:58] and so Christ when he dies this is part
[57:00] of that quickening
[57:02] for us but now let's go to the let's go
[57:04] to the end then because he saw good seed
[57:08] and it says in Revelations 21
[57:10] . I I and I I'll just maybe read I'll
[57:13] stop when I we get to a point here
[57:14] because I think I have to seven here he
[57:16] says and I saw
[57:18] a new Heaven and a new Earth
[57:21] for the first Heaven and the first Earth
[57:23] will pass away
[57:26] very very like a paradox here and there
[57:28] was no more sea
[57:30] and I John saw the holy city New
[57:33] Jerusalem
[57:34] coming down from God out of heaven
[57:38] what is it coming down to the Earth
[57:42] prepared as a bride adorned for her
[57:46] husband
[57:47] this is the fruit of Genesis 1. this is
[57:50] the fullness of God's hidden Mystery in
[57:52] the Earth
[57:53] it's no longer a bear seed it's no
[57:56] longer naked and unashamed but it's all
[57:58] in all the fruit of Heaven's Glory the
[58:01] man and the woman in the beginning were
[58:02] naked but now in the end the bride is
[58:05] adorned
[58:08] a bride adorned for her husband and I
[58:10] heard a great voice out of Heaven saying
[58:12] behold the Tabernacle of God is with men
[58:15] and he will dwell with them and they
[58:18] shall be his people and God himself
[58:19] shall be with them and be their God the
[58:21] Tabernacle of God which is the heavens
[58:24] shall be with men which are from the
[58:27] earth and that God shall wipe away all
[58:29] tears from their eyes now notice this
[58:31] Eden of Holiness in the end and death
[58:33] and sorrow and everything Satan brought
[58:35] you'll gather all those things out of
[58:37] his kingdom he says and there shall be
[58:39] no more death neither sorrow nor crying
[58:42] neither shall there be any more pain for
[58:44] the former things are passed away this
[58:46] is the Alpha and Omega the beginning and
[58:49] the end the Genesis 1 1 2 25 in the
[58:52] Revelation 21 this is Christ this is the
[58:56] fullness of the seed
[58:58] the seeds of the Kingdom matured to
[59:01] their full perfection
[59:04] the Tabernacle of God is with men in the
[59:06] sermon future home of the Heavenly
[59:07] bridegroom an Earthly bride he says
[59:09] notice the Tabernacle of God will be
[59:11] with man notice the former things have
[59:13] passed away
[59:14] this this thing has passed away this
[59:17] means that heaven has come down to
[59:20] resident with man
[59:23] do you realize what he's saying it's not
[59:26] about going to heaven to stay in heaven
[59:29] that's not yes we want to go to heaven
[59:32] yes we can't wait till we get out of
[59:34] here but could I just say and I can't
[59:36] wait to come back
[59:38] and I can't wait to stay not just a
[59:41] thousand years but forevermore
[59:45] because heaven comes down and resides
[59:46] with man
[59:47] [Music]
[59:49] just as he has in your soul
[59:52] Heaven and Earth are embraced
[59:55] Heaven and Earth are embraced once again
[59:59] in the beginning God created the Heaven
[1:00:02] and the Earth and he had this great
[1:00:03] vision and plan that one day they would
[1:00:05] be indivisible
[1:00:07] they would be forever United and so God
[1:00:09] in this program from the beginning was
[1:00:11] this Union of Heaven and Earth
[1:00:14] behold the Tabernacle of God is with men
[1:00:16] and I John saw the holy city New
[1:00:18] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[1:00:21] Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for
[1:00:23] her husband in verse 9 and there came
[1:00:25] unto me one of the Seven Angels which
[1:00:27] had the seven vials full of seven last
[1:00:29] plagues and talked with me saying come
[1:00:31] hither I will show Thee the bride the
[1:00:34] Lamb's wife
[1:00:35] remember he sees the city
[1:00:37] and described as a brider doing for her
[1:00:39] husband not a naked seed
[1:00:42] not a bear seed not the body that was
[1:00:44] sown but the body that would be
[1:00:47] not the first Glory
[1:00:50] but the lighter Glory
[1:00:52] the hidden Glory
[1:00:54] [Music]
[1:00:55] he said I'll show you the bride the
[1:00:57] Lamb's wife and listen he doesn't
[1:00:59] describe Genesis 1. he doesn't describe
[1:01:01] Genesis 2 and he carried me away in the
[1:01:04] spirit to a great and high mountain and
[1:01:06] showed me that great City the holy
[1:01:09] Jerusalem descending Out of Heaven from
[1:01:12] God
[1:01:13] having the glory of God
[1:01:17] that was the glory and the seed from the
[1:01:19] beginning it says and her light and then
[1:01:21] it begins to describe a full City all
[1:01:24] the elements that laid within the Earth
[1:01:26] everything God put in the trees
[1:01:28] everything that God put in the minerals
[1:01:29] all of you could just imagine it God
[1:01:31] laid the stones God laid the gems God
[1:01:35] laid everything in Genesis 1 and now
[1:01:37] he's taken all the material out of it
[1:01:40] and he's built himself a glorious New
[1:01:43] Jerusalem
[1:01:45] Hallelujah
[1:01:49] the seeds of the Kingdom standing in all
[1:01:52] their Glory
[1:01:54] as this beautiful city adorned and all
[1:01:56] these minerals and all these elements
[1:01:57] and all these things that would have
[1:01:58] described that were hidden there in the
[1:02:01] beginning
[1:02:03] comes back to Earth
[1:02:05] right back to Earth again but not as a
[1:02:08] seed that's being sown into death not as
[1:02:10] dust returning back to the ground but in
[1:02:12] the fullness of what it was meant to be
[1:02:14] in the beginning
[1:02:16] Hallelujah
[1:02:22] Brothers if you could come to your
[1:02:23] instruments
[1:02:26] somewhere we say that enough where they
[1:02:28] might think we have a Doctrine here
[1:02:30] that only Brothers can play instruments
[1:02:38] you think it will clarify for us please
[1:02:40] I'm just visiting today do you have a
[1:02:43] Doctrine you just kind of mention it
[1:02:44] just thinking they'll be like oh maybe
[1:02:45] they don't and you're like
[1:02:48] no we have sisters that play instruments
[1:02:51] they just don't preach
[1:02:55] behind the pulpit
[1:02:58] and Christ is the mystery of God
[1:02:59] revealed
[1:03:02] if you catch this Christ as a mystery
[1:03:03] God revealed I meant their lives are
[1:03:05] sermons
[1:03:07] I don't know what you guys are thinking
[1:03:12] oh you're thinking about the neighbor in
[1:03:13] the apartment next door
[1:03:15] and Christ is the mystery God revealed
[1:03:18] Elohim
[1:03:19] God manifest in flesh
[1:03:22] Jesus showing that he himself got in him
[1:03:28] will be manifested in his bride in the
[1:03:30] last days
[1:03:31] oh my
[1:03:32] I don't think I have that there just no
[1:03:35] end to it a revelation of God
[1:03:37] it's eternal
[1:03:39] it just keeps moving on and on and on so
[1:03:41] now here notice then
[1:03:44] one like the first Adam and Eve
[1:03:48] before sin separated them in death
[1:03:51] now Christ the second Adam in life
[1:03:55] redeems his bride from death
[1:03:58] and now on his way back to the original
[1:04:00] Eden restored back his bride and
[1:04:02] fellowship back with God as husband and
[1:04:04] wife in the Garden of Eden sure Christ
[1:04:07] and his bride now could I think if I
[1:04:09] could just offer this into evidence this
[1:04:12] is greater than the first because the
[1:04:15] first left the door open for failure
[1:04:17] this one seals it
[1:04:19] we can agree on that
[1:04:22] so God allowed the glory that first
[1:04:25] glory be expressed and Satan attacks it
[1:04:28] but God had hidden it already in the sea
[1:04:30] saying he's doing exactly what's
[1:04:32] necessary
[1:04:33] to bring the hidden Mystery of Heaven
[1:04:35] that's in it out
[1:04:38] he didn't Mar the Masterpiece he made it
[1:04:40] a masterpiece
[1:04:43] back with God as husband and wife in the
[1:04:45] Garden of Eden sure Christ and his bride
[1:04:47] and got it that day
[1:04:50] the kingdom is given over to the father
[1:04:52] he might be all in all he begins to
[1:04:55] quote these things why he's that
[1:04:56] speaking I'll hear David Christ David
[1:04:58] sit on the throne the king over the
[1:04:59] whole human race while they're yet
[1:05:01] thinking I'll know what they're thinking
[1:05:03] about before they speak I'll answer them
[1:05:04] the wolf and the lamb shall feed
[1:05:06] together the lion shall eat straw like a
[1:05:07] book and they shall feed together and
[1:05:09] lay down they shall not hurt nor destroy
[1:05:11] my Holy Mountain notice what he's
[1:05:12] describing he's caught up in this
[1:05:13] inspiration right back exactly to eating
[1:05:15] again as hard as it can go
[1:05:20] the seeds of all the potential that Eden
[1:05:23] represented God has brought it out in
[1:05:26] its most gradient full Glory
[1:05:29] Hallelujah
[1:05:31] stand with me
