TRANSCRIPT
========================================
speaking on a matter of faith part two on human or divine the question that we're asking about uh human faith or divine faith the question that maybe we even challenge ourselves with whether the faith we have is human or divine i just don't have the time this evening to back up to a lot of things from last wednesday but we'll make a few statements and revisit a quote here at the outset um that we'll try to reset everything where we're at in terms of our thought process on this um not necessarily in the whole series on a matter of faith but just that first part on human or divine we know that there are different kinds of faith that's what we're looking at and also different ways that they operate those two kinds of faith as we outlined them last time was a human faith that we could say is a mental faith an intellectual faith or an emotional faith and then on the other hand a divine faith and as we've been looking at divine healing i i want to put it in these terms because i think this is very helpful to us to understand how our faith operates both saved and unsaved can operate faith to be healed if someone experiences a miracle of divine healing uh not necessarily solely to the elect but both saved and unsaved can have faith to be healed have faith to operate a gift have faith to receive a blessing have faith to have a prayer answered and so faith can operate in a person at a level that activates the word of god even if they don't have the holy ghost and when jesus we used last time how he spoke to the fig tree doesn't really qualify it other than if you could have if you can believe and not doubt and have the faith the grain of a mustard seed you could speak to a mountain and have it removed and cast itself into the the ocean it just speaks to this powerful the ability or the the um the capability of faith and how it can operate and so i'm going to say this at the outset and this is kind of me kind of maybe getting it out there maybe my wheels would get going a little bit this faith that we're talking about in general faith can operate uh it can be the result of just human faith it can be a result of intellectual faith or mental faith but it can operate in such a way toward that faith that mental faith drops down into the heart and the heart accepting it and there not being any doubt and that's how faith can be the result of even intellectual faith is it comes down to a place where it drops into the human heart and god can perform things by his own sovereign power he can do things by his own will by his own intervention god can do things and perform them and it's not necessarily the function of anyone's faith it's just divine faith god intervening god acting god doing something but then there's also things that we can receive from god by using our own faith to act to operate his promises but imam talks a lot about it's your own faith that can use a gift and so there's a lot that relates to our own faith there's a lot that relates to his faith and there's this same word faith can be used in different contexts to refer to something that is absolutely divine but it can also be something that's just only human and i'm going to use this statement to i think that kind of gets a few key things out there for me because i'll be referring back to them or hopefully you'll see where they fit in as we go forward we've read this statement a number of times lately and it's a question and answer is in 1964. part one it says i've seen prostitutes come to the platform and be instantly healed and the sainted woman crossed the platform and miss it says sure it's based upon faith now those of you who listen to the message of the hour who read who've been in the message for your entire lives you've heard a number of statements to this point so this isn't the only place that he says it says in a lot of different places where the sinner is able to go through a prayer line and receive their healing but a christian is not same prayer line same hands maybe even the same prayer maybe even the same sickness and that uh as he uses race prostitute we'll just maybe say sinner this is one without the holy ghost is able to by faith because he says it's based upon faith by faith receive their healing and then a christian whom we wouldn't allege doesn't have faith but in that moment or in that instance is not able to receive their healing because it's based upon faith and something's not quite right in the way that they've approached the promise so in this instance and this is what we'll just be amplifying i think we ended last wednesday kind of on this example that the sinner is able to achieve some sort of unhindered faith where nothing is opposing it nothing is limiting their belief that they can be healed whereas the christian struggles intellectually struggles emotionally struggles in their spirit with uh with the the application of the promise to themselves you say ask a christian do you believe in divine healing they're always genuine christians say yes they're going to agree with the word of god but the reason why it may not act on them is there something else that's wrestling with the promise is it for me did i make a mistake am i not doing this right am i doing this wrong and that's why brother branham says in a number of places that a sinner can have enough faith to be healed but a christian miss it so i'm going to take a few moments to establish divine faith as a distinctly different faith this would be the faith of god this is a faith his it's even his gift to the elect in titus chapter 1 verse 1 and paul a servant of god an apostle of jesus christ according to the faith of god's elect and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness that's a very uh great phrase the faith of god's elect so there is a faith that i would say is unique to god's elect it is an elect of faith is kind of joined with the elective love it is something that is a unique to the believer and romans chapter 3 verse 3 paul uses another phrase for what if some did not believe shall their unbelief make the faith of god without effect so there is unbelief but then there's also unbelief with this related to us as humans that's within our ability and our power maybe that's um that's our that's our anti-superpower is to not believe as human beings and we all have it but then there is the faith of god that unbelief cannot make ineffective as he's uh we're taking this out of the larger context in chapter three here but he uses the phrase the faith of god so there's a faith of god a god a godly faith a divine faith and jude writing his letter says but ye beloved building up yourselves on your most holy faith praying in the holy ghost so this is this is a unique faith this is a faith that i would say is divine faith not just your faith but the most holy faith not just a faith but the faith of god not just believing but the faith of god's elect bill abraham in one place refers to divine faith he says that divine faith that's been placed in our heart by the holy spirit so there's a there's a faith that is placed in our hearts by the holy spirit as paul says that we are saved by faith in the way he says through grace by faith and referring to even both of them which is the gift of god the grace is a gift the faith is a gift of god so there is a divine faith that is placed inside of you by the holy spirit two statements uh to read in relation to that and again i'll hearken back to maybe a qualifier i gave last time there's a lot of things i'm wanting to say uh tonight a read from the message of the hour just so that we know what brother benham said kind of familiar with the phrases he's using the way that he's looking at faith and not in any way to try to explain faith so perfectly to where faith is no longer a matter of faith but think about the different ways that brother brahm talked about it so it gives us a better view of of the whole subject and so there's some of these things i'm just reading not with the with the intent that things would click immediately and all that explains everything but just to see the prophet's eyes on the subject and the sermon earnestly contend for the faith he says paul was down here in the natural realm with his ph.d he had an intellectual faith but he didn't have a divine faith there in no way is preaching against having a phd or a doctorate but he's just saying that paul down here in the natural realm had an intellectual faith but he didn't have a divine faith well learned understood um had a lot of things that he knew and even with that intellectual faith he's very zealous for what he believed but he says he didn't have a divine faith there's quite a difference in me having an intellectual faith than a divine faith there's where you my baptist friends failed to go on you get the intellectual faith by that but it must be a divine revelation of jesus christ to you so that so that just came out of the heart to you that just came out of the heart so he's referring to how the baptists believe and in believing they believe that they're saved and at the moment they believe everything is sealed and it's over but in the way that they believe they take the word of god in such a way to what they're believing is unto the baptism of the holy ghost and they don't take it all away to the seal of faith and they've structured in such a way toward the mental accept ascent or accepting something intellectually is enough to say oh put your name on a book shake hands with the preacher you're saved and brother says no that's just an intellectual faith it's got to drop down further where you get a divine revelation of jesus christ which is the new birth and that's got to come out of the heart he says the intellectual faith is not enough that's right but it only brings you to the holy spirit now that's a very large subject you have to mentally accept things you have to believe even in the mind that's the beginning part the word of god swings your mind to believe things but then it just brings you to a place to accept that gift of the holy ghost and he says the holy spirit is a personal experience of the birth the new birth regeneration making a new creature in christ so there's billy brown even using a language that divides intellectual faith from human faith and when we speak of intellectual faith brother braham uses the phrase mental faith we could say emotional faith with human faith those are all things that relate uh to this faith that he's referring to here as distinctly different from divine faith then in possessing the gate of the enemy after trial paul after he's had his revelation after he's no longer working with his phd in intellectual faith and has divine faith paul said none of these things bother me for he was tied to an absolute christ and every true achievement is tied to an absolute and my absolute is the word and everybody else is that's really born of the spirit their absolute is god's word now one thing that i think is notable is when he's talking about this kind of faith he's generally relating it to i almost want to say absolutely to a person who's been born again this kind of faith he's talking about if you've really been born by the spirit your absolutes the word i'm tied to it laid my hands upon it and it took my place and i've identified myself with him now watch how remarkable this is the way that he phrases this we knew that he promised to identify himself with us that brings genuine faith not your own faith but his faith something that you don't control he does it now that's that's a different that's a different level of faith it's a different kind of faith and uh and i'm just really trusting the lord just to give me the wisdom and how to express this to you today maybe one of the most difficult sermons these last two on this subject just to be sure that i'm absolutely within the bounds of the word of god because there's so many things that you could just kind of chase after and before you know it you're out in the middle of nowhere and it's not making real sense anymore according to the word of god and i want to be very careful that i don't try to explain it in such a way to where we're all intellectually like well what that makes a lot of sense let's just accept that definition and go forward i want to be able to share things from the word of god that may even retain some sense of mystery to it that your faith grabs a hold of and says that makes sense may not be able to explain it later to my wife but that makes sense and you really grab a hold of it understanding just how broad brother or the ways that brother brown looked at this and i just don't know if we'll ever have time we'll have time here at this time to go into some of these things but brother bram talks about having an intellectual faith and he uses a couple phrases that suggest that with an intellectual faith the worldliness can creep into that and so an intellectual faith can always kind of be hybrid it can get mixed with something and other things can be joined to it and that's the uniqueness of this kind of intellectual faith because we could take intellectual faith and it can be reasoned into anything anything it can be reasoned into and i almost want to go down my line of usual suspects like flat earth or whatever it might be your intellectual faith can be reasoned into a lot of things and be very fervent about it and believe it very convincingly but if it's not in the word of god then it clearly has to be entirely within the realm of the intellect and so you can have an intellectual faith that's based upon well-reasoned arguments factual claims even the evidence of things trial and error proof and evidences and putting your hands on thing in an intellectual faith is going to derive and conclude from a lot of other a lot of factors that are in those realms and so intellectual faith can be towards anything it can be inspired by things and that is just a faith that can be hybrid and mixed up but now brother adam says there's another faith a genuine faith saying that you don't even control why because it's a faith that comes by hearing the word of god and then a faith that only operates by the word of god paul talks about it it's peter rather um in the acts chapter three i think it's verse 16 and then later when he's writing one of his epistles he's talking about a faith which is by christ in his name by faith from him in him so it's a faith that is by him but then it's a faith that is to him so there's a faith that comes by jesus christ and that faith that comes by jesus christ points right back to jesus christ it's fed by jesus christ and so that's the faith a genuine faith that's not even your own it's not even something you can control because it's the word that controls it now that's a higher level of believing than absolutely believing uh that it it it did not rain and believing it did not rain and then stepping outside and saying well i guess it did rain because you see the evidence of rain this is a higher level of believing in a higher level of faith now to see an example of this intellectual faith i believe we can identify it here in luke chapter 22. read verses 31-33 this was our text and the lord said simon simon behold satan hath desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat but i have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not and when thou art converted strengthened thy brethren and then this is the faith of peter and he said in him lord i am ready to go with thee both into prison and to death. now what faith was that peter's own faith his own conviction his own belief his own uh dedication his own attachment to christ there's some say that this faith that he's referring to here was just kind of peter's paradigm of religion how it had shifted from judaism or not necessarily from judaism but shifted now to a belief and this is the messiah and so it's his it's his his own efforts to follow christ it's his own profession that he believes that christ is the son of god that comes into the world so i prayed that thy faith fail not and so when he says thy faith we would look at that as peter's own faith his personal acceptance of christ is his discipline to christ being a disciple of christ but he says i've prayed that it failed not and this word fail not it means utterly fail or to fail altogether and we know as we've already read that he he read he does not his faith falters i can put it that way it did falter but it did not fail because to say i pray that your faith would fail not it means that you would not ultimately reject christ that regardless of some doubts and regardless of ups and downs and regardless of a weakness i've prayed that ultimately you don't become apostate that you faith does not completely fall away so peter's faith did falter in that he denied jesus christ but he did not fail and it was according to what election because jesus said i'll pray for you and i've prayed for you that your faith failed not so absent election everyone has a faith that can ultimately fail so he says i've prayed that your faith fail not and when you are converted this is the divine transformation of peter's soul this is that this was what brings that genuine faith so when he's when he's converted strengthened thy brethren and when he's converted that's the seal of peter's own faith he believed and went all the way to the seal of god the baptism of the holy ghost and that's what converts peter to where now it's just not peter's faith to the point to where in acts chapter 3 he says did you think we did this that this man was healed by our own power at solomon's porch do you think this was us that did it but no this is the power of christ for this one by faith it through christ in his name has been made whole and said this isn't my faith this is the faith of christ and so this is this is a different this is the transformation of peter's faith in the sermon blind bartimaeus and i realize i may just be stacking bricks and there may not seem to be much mortar going in between them but i trust the holy spirit can do that as we continue and the sermon blind bartimaeus he says you're a wonderful set of people i don't believe you can find any more faith as what we would call and it kind of pauses a little bit and uh so this is just my comments i i don't know if he was gonna say i don't know if you could find any more intellectual faith or you know just kind human faith but he says i'll explain it tomorrow the levels of faith what human faith is and what divine faith is and the next morning i believe he speaks on what what is a vision one of them is the human faith and the other one is divine faith so brother i'm dividing those two again levels of faith there's a human faith and one is divine faith and i thought the remainder of this statement was beautiful because now he's going to begin to describe what he's wanting the audience to do at the end of this service he's wanting them to he says i just don't know if you can have any more and he's just a great wonderful very wonderful set of people uh and he says but there's levels of faith and he's not wanting to take away any faith that they do have but he's wanting them to recognize that maybe faith can go up a little bit higher maybe there's depths of faith that they haven't achieved before so he's saying there's a human faith and there's a divine faith but humanly speaking you're one of the finest audience i've ever spoke to that's right if you could only break through that little crust there it just divides right there now i believe it's okay for us to think about a divide between human faith and divine faith i think it's okay for us to do that because he says there's levels of faith so you have a level of human faith or maybe we could do it this way you have a level of human faith and then he's saying there's just a little crust here a little divide before you can get to divine faith he says just a little ravel if you could just go over it what's a ravel it's a tangle or a cluster when you unravel something that that's what that word is unravels to take a tangle or cluster and straighten it all out he says there's just a divide a crust just a little ravel if you could just go over it you'll go from the tributary out into the ocean you know what i mean just believe so there's a faith that we could have that he's not saying oh that's a pitiful faith that's an awful faith that's a perverted faith but he's saying it's almost like a tributary to the ocean if you'll just follow the source it's going to get you to the ocean and so we can have a human faith and intellectual faith when i say source if you could just follow what it's leading to rather and so you could have a faith that is not the ocean but yet it's somehow connected to it because how do we all have our minds mentally swing to believe the message of the hour how did we all have our minds awakened to the things of god by some something first striking us and being this genesis of faith in our intellect in our minds even if it was just for a moment like oh i didn't even know that before oh i believe and then immediately it drops down they say that's the greatest distance ever traveled is from the head to the heart and the man but it's in that moment that the head can be awakened the intellect can be awakened emotions and the intelligence all awakened but then there's this ravel this cross that you've got a breakthrough to get to divine faith he says you know what i mean just believe and this statement to me is very important just don't try to make it so orthodox what all you have to do and what all because you can make it this kind of this legalism this orthodoxy well i've got to do this and i've got to do that he's saying well let's just believe we get too much orthodox in our minds even as message believers a lot of things well did it come this way did it come that way is it this is it that he says no just be like a little girl a little boy that's reaching up to daddy's hands to get the lollipop he said here's son this is yours just like that believe it it'll happen i i i think that's tremendous that kind of helps us to understand that there's a promise and he's wanting us to reach for it because he says to reach for it and to not just intellectually enjoy the lollipop and daddy promised me a lollipop but do exactly what a little kid would do tell you right now if i promised my children something like that then they would just they would want it because there's times when we've promised things and we forgot all about it but not our kids if you tell them even if you told them in 2027 on september 3rd we're going to take you to freddy's for some frozen custard they will remind you on that date almost five years later says you promised it you said it was going to happen try watch one of my kids five years from now on september third and say what about freddy's i'm like what are you talking about man i said go into the archives bro it's in there because it's something that a kid does says odd take daddy at his word he says here's a lollipop it's yours it says just believe it it'll happen so there's an intellectual faith but then there's a ravel there's a crust there's something that we have to get beyond in order to get into divine faith now in uh luke chapter 8 verse 13 with this is just alluding to this i this thing sometimes i just have to cut down to just the statement otherwise just myself personally i start getting caught up in all the certain aspects of it and i want to just amplify and amplify it and then you just don't ever really get to the point but in luke chapter 8 and the parable of the sower we know the the seed is the word of god the different conditions of the ground are the wayside the stony places where there's thorns and then the good ground and we could type the the ground even to the condition of the person we could type it to just the recipient hearts and those that hear the word but the seed is the word and in every instance there's nothing wrong with the word there's something wrong with the ground that it falls in and how it's trampled under foot or it's snatched or it's strangled but then that good ground where it can bring forth a hundred fold and so christ interprets the part of they which they fall upon the rock and the stony places he says they on the rock are they which now the person it comes in view when they hear receive the word with joy and these have no root which for a while believe and in the time of temptation fall away so what what faith did they have if there's divine faith and there's human faith and jesus says that the word is broadcast and someone happily receives the word where did they happily receive it well i i believe that we could conclude that this is a word that was received intellectually emotionally intelligently and not wrong because it's the word it's not that they received a lie they received the word and this is a human faith because they believed for a while but it never found root it wasn't deep enough they didn't find root and so then something can tempt them in their minds in their emotions in their intellect and their intelligence in that in that intellectual faith that human faith they can be tempted and it lose their grip on that faith and then they fall away so human faith is characterized as being temporary human faith is weak human faith is emotional it's intellectual it can only go so far now it can be extremely disciplined and it can last for a very very long time and actually human faith in some ways we could say someone could hold it even to the point where they die but in itself it's not an absolute in itself it's not necessarily impervious it's something it isn't something that is permanently anchored in the soul it can be there can be very fervent very passionate supported and disciplined but jesus is saying that this kind of faith that is only received with joy and very gladly in an intellectual realm is temporary and you may believe for a while but in the hour of temptation fall away and so this is this is maybe where we're getting kind of to the heart of the matter human faith can be enough to result in temporary manifestations human faith can be enough to manifest itself into healing human faith can come rise to a level or be enough to uh to enjoy miracles or to see the blessings of god or experience certain things and again i think it harkens back to and hopefully we'll be able to uh express this in a way that you can visualize it may be that and i definitely want to come back to come to this in the end that you can have a person who's filled the holy ghost and a person who's not filled with the holy ghost and so the person who's filled with the holy ghost and the person who doesn't have the holy ghost can both enjoy some of the very same things using using faith on a certain level but then there's a believer that that's just a totally separate category and i hope that we express that enough for the first few services that there's a faith which is on another level connected in another dimension now we're just looking at faith in a broader spectrum and how that there can be an intellectual faith and in this intellectual faith it can operate in a way to actually achieve certain results in john chapter 5 verse 14 as we read it on sunday how the woman excuse me the man at the pool of bethesda christ is the one that starts the conversation with them he doesn't say oh put me in the water oh rabbi heal me jesus is the one that walks right up to him says do you want to be made whole he goes ah nobody can put me in the water and he and he says take up thy bed and walk and in that instance the man not even knowing who jesus was just took this man at his word it's like i'm just gonna take up my bed and walk and immediately the man was healed and so what happened in that moment if we could just diagram it this way is christ told him to do something and in his mind he didn't say well that's foolish why would i listen to you and then in his heart he didn't say ah i think i'd just rather wait and try to get my way into the water he just in the moment accepted it took up his bed and began to walk not even knowing who jesus was it's not until later that jesus comes to him the temple and it's in that conversation oh this is who it was it was jesus and so jesus tells him in the temple verse 14 afterward jesus findeth him in the temple and said unto him behold thou art made whole sin no more lest a worse thing come unto thee now that phrase is something i think we hear in the message of the hour a lot and it's a principle that we know a lot about that whenever there was a healing and someone was being healed and again we're talking about divine healing that someone receives their healing the charge is keep believing don't stop believing or because sin is unbelief or a worse thing will come unto thee in other words in that moment he had enough faith to take jesus at his word take up his bed and begin to walk and he was experiencing the benefits of it but jesus is saying if you disbelieve a worse thing will come on you so whatever happened was in this was temporary because his unbelief could throw him out of that wholeness and into a worse thing now there's dozens of statements i could use but just listen to these two brother bram says and that's just how long divine healing lasts as long as you believe it [Music] another place divine healing lasts just as long as your faith lasts with it have you heard these statements before yes remember i'm talking about your healing last as long as you believe it he says the same thing about your salvation and that to me that kind of kicks into a whole other area of conversation but he said your divine healing lasts as long as you believe it as long as your faith lasts with it so as long as you have faith to believe you're healed there's a power even in your own faith that can hold your body in subjection and keep you well and and i would say it's god that heals not you that healed but your faith in the promise has now held sickness at bay but as soon as you disbelieve then there's no longer there's no longer the the law of faith that's working against the disease or the sickness or the ill uh whatever ailment it may be and that can come right back on you again so he says the healing will last is your faith as long as your faith lasts now in the sermon god provided a lamb is this is this okay for you all of you individually tonight i know i struggled with it just getting ready to preach it something just i felt like i got gut punched as i was driving to church i don't know what it was i just got anxious i got worried i got all upset and had nothing to do with anything else other than maybe just the devil did a drive-by shooting or something and uh so i just been troubled in my spirit but i i think it's very important for us to get and i don't want us to miss this and the sermon god provided a lamb he said there's brother this is just it's not here but let me say it just before he says he said there's an intellectual faith and he says we are a trinity and he says we are like god he says our body our soul body and spirit so what he's about to say is based upon the fact that there's an intellectual faith and as he wants to deal with intellectual faith he wants to break us down to body spirit soul and so that's important to kind of understanding what he's talking about he says now intellectual faith is what and i know it's a fragment but i read it so you could realize bill graham what he's getting beginning to say is he's thinking about how intellectual faith works that's what's the matter with our revivals today now here it is now get it billy graham jack schuler many of great men oral roberts great evangelists on the field have combed this nation back and forth altar calls have been made till enough to convert a thousand americas not americans he says americas and and so he's he says but the reason it's the only it's only the people are brought to an intellectual faith so altar calls uh have been made and there's conviction and there's promises and there's professions so that they would just go a little deeper till that faith comes from the intellectuals and soaks down into the soul it would last so there can be a faith that we have intellectually and in terms of a conversion he says if it would just go deeper not just receive the word with joy and after a while and believe for a while but go to something deeper he's saying it would last that's the reason about 80 or 90 of the converts that come in a revival are gone before six months is gone is because they only have an intellectual conception so their conversion lasts as long as their faith lasts their experience lasts as long as their human faith or intellectual faith will last but when it comes to an experience of being born again of the spirit of god that anchors to eternity what is he highlighting this dynamic of how the word preached or things could be said and mentally we can grab ahold of it we could believe it any and even begin to walk and do some blessing as a part of it but it won't last unless it drops down in terms of conversion into the soul and so an intellectual faith can be a faith that never goes deep enough for a conversion and he's saying that something stops it it's there somehow but something stops it from going deeper now to kind of open up this subject a little bit on what brown's talking about because he says we're a trinity of body spirit soul in jeremiah chapter 29 verse 13 he says and you shall seek me and find me when you shall search for me with all your heart so we can't just be seeking intellectually academically with false motives you can't just be seeking with the human heart just emotionally just intelligently only but you have to research he says with all your heart there's something all-encompassing about it not just from the mind but also in the deepest part not just ah let's just see but he says you'll find me when you search with me with all your heart so if i could put it this way maybe you can do it intellectual faith can be some of it some of your mind it could be some of the person but it's not all there can be a part that believes but a part that doesn't a part that rejects it a part that reasons with it says you'll find me when you seek me with all your heart and so going back to the parable of the sower in matthew 13 verses 5 and 6 he says some fell upon stony places where they had not much earth in forthwith they sprung up because they had no deepness of earth remember brother braham says it's got to go deep enough it doesn't go deep enough so there was some ground but it was hard it was compacted it couldn't get any roots in they had no deepness of earth and when the sun was up they were scorched and because they had no root they withered away so there is a way that we can intellectually receive the word of god and in receiving intellectually we can receive it with joy we can hold it there in our minds but since it's not deep enough the scripture says it's shallow because it doesn't go deep enough it can't fully grow to the place where it can bring forth the fruit that that seed is intended to grow so the scripture and brother branham are identifying that there's a way that our minds can hold the word of god intellectually and believe but then the word of god speaks to faith where it's not just in the mind but it's from the heart if i could say maybe the whole heart whatever that might actually be that it's not just intellectually but there's some deepness to it it means really in reality in romans 6 17 he says but god be thanked that you were the servants of sin but you have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you it's not that you just believed from the mind but you obeyed from the heart so it takes it out of the realm of a weak faith the temporal faith took it out of the realm of something that was just human faith but it put it in the realm of divine faith that acts upon the promises of god or faith that comes from the heart it's deeper than just intellectual it comes from a real conviction in ephesians chapter 6 verse 6 now with eye service not as with eye service as men pleasers but as a servants of christ doing the will of god from the heart if you only do it for man you can do it intellectually from the mind you can do it from human emotion give sympathy on somebody you want to please your dad you want to make the pastor happy whatever it might be those things can only find their genesis in the mind in your emotions intellectual academic through feeling through thought through emotion through intelligence but when you do it from the heart that's deeper is this does that make sense in terms of brotherhood say well there's levels of faith there's a human faith but then there's a divine faith and again i i can't explain this in such a way where it's going to satisfy maybe every question every objection and i don't even want to try to explain it but just and i don't want to ex i don't want to express these things in a way to where it just gets real complicate complicated and con convoluted but just realize there's streams there's just a way that we can believe and it's intellectual but then it can go deeper where it's more than just intellect but it's associated with something in the heart watch how james speaks to prayer and believing in james chapter 1 verses 5 to 8 this is a good scripture to think about in regards to a matter of faith and then also in receiving your healing it says if any man lack wisdom let him ask god that that god giveth to all men liberally and abradeth not and it shall be given him what a beautiful promise and he says but let him ask in faith so if you lack wisdom you ought to ask god i think this speaks to the believer ask god for wisdom and he'll give liberty and he won't rebuke you for asking but you can't ask for that just anyway remember how james is going to say later that you ask a miss you ask for things because you want to consume it on your own lust there's some other motive some other objective something working in the human spirit that's requesting things or wanting things and desiring things and it's not really with the faith a genuine faith it says let them ask in faith not wavering so this is the issue wavering for he that wavereth is like the wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed for let not that man think he shall receive anything of the lord because to ask in faith could you to ask in faith is to have no wavering to ask in faith is there's no variance there's no i want this but asking faith is on some level or the seeking i'm seeking with my whole heart this is very clear to me this is something i want this is something i'm asking for this is something i desire and so to ask in faith is coming to a place with respect to that promise or the thing that you're asking for you're not wavering on it lord i i want this job but right and this and that and the other i really really like this girl but if this sister liked me now that's different right and it's not like you're just kind of weighing things and trying to figure things out it says i'm asking in faith not wavering and he says because if a man is wavering don't don't think that that's the kind of faith that's going to achieve a result so he's looking at the person and how a man can that he's saying ask for something he kind of drops down and teaches us something about faith and says you can't ask in faith if there's any kind of hesitation you can't ask in faith if there's any kind of contingencies any kind of doubt any kind of fear any kind of worry any any idea that maybe it's not so or it shouldn't be he says you've got to ask without wavering and then he drops this in in verse 8 a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways and to me i believe this is a separate principle that stands on its own but it points back to what he's saying if you have faith and you're a believer then you ought to ask in faith without wavering he says because a man who's double-minded is unstable he's not going to get what he wants a man who's unstable is a double-minded man he says is unstable he's restless in everything he thinks he has a there's a variance in how he feels and he decides nothing's ever certain nothing's ever sure a double-minded man is a doubter someone who is a waiver a waiver someone has divided loyalties is what the bible says so they're unsure they're uncommitted oh yeah i'll do that i think well yeah i i'm right behind you i got your back i mean you're way back right i mean there's just a way they're just you're just not sure where they stand he said a man that is double-minded is unstable in all his ways and then where brother branham places this scripture is not a person who has the holy ghost and then wrestles in their spirit but he takes it from the position of somebody who has not the holy ghost but believes in their mind and he says don't be double-minded throw your whole life to him and believe with all your heart so it's really the person without the holy ghost who who wrestles with this double mindedness because intellectually they can have all the faith in the world but right down in the heart of the matter they don't they can't the person without the holy ghost cannot have eternal life the brotherhood says don't be double-minded throw your whole life to him and so this person who's double-minded they don't have that eternal life on the inside of them so their their human ex their experience is only going to last as long as their human faith lasts brother braham said that's what's the matter with a lot of so-called christians today they cross breed with the world no wonder you can't ever be settled double-minded never able to come to the knowledge of the truth a man's got to know god by the new birth and be borned and filled with the holy ghost that's what keeps you from being double-minded so i know that we we like to use the scripture and i'm not saying it would be wrong to use it this way because i think there's still a principle that could be applied but brother branham takes the scripture says a double-minded man is a man who's trying to ask god for wisdom these are my words in james now that from the book of james is a man who's asking god for wisdom but he's doing it intellectually not from a heart of faith that possesses the mind of christ that's going to answer to the request but they want something from god and james said don't think that a man who's double-minded is going to get something from god because how can a man ask intellectually when even deep down in his deepest part is divided when there when there's no certainty there's no absolute there's no permanence there and he can be in one day out the next up and down he said this is a man with divided loyalties and so a double-minded man brother bran places him in these instances is somebody who may have human faith but doesn't believe in the soul doesn't believe in the heart and now two more statements and then i i'm going to close with some i'll have a couple more quotes but i'll close with some visual representations of this but these two statements i think will help us just add a little bit more uh for us to consider in the sermon glorified jesus he says now if you can look and live where you hear the gospel when you hear the gospel preached on the basis of the word that settles it you're healed right then right there but you cannot be healed by mental faith you've got to be healed by real living faith from your heart now if i could say this based upon this statement a number of other statements i've read but just using this statement because it's one of the places where broadband is very clear where it's the only place i could find where he says it but it's the only place he says it exactly this way you cannot be healed by mental faith and so i'm not saying he doesn't allude to it elsewhere in a similar way but he says it so clearly here you cannot be healed by mental faith but you've got to be healed by a real living faith from your heart and so again i think it points to this idea that you can have a mental faith where you believe something but your heart doesn't necessarily believe it right and so the mind you you the the you could have an intellectual emotional human faith but something else has to ultimately up and open up in the heart in order to embrace it and to accept it so sure you have to have a mental faith otherwise you can mentally not believe and that becomes the resistance that becomes the barrier so someone could say well okay i can accept that but then the heart still swinging around the heart's still varying this heart's not sure and so the mind can say okay i accept it but then there's still a deeper part that it has to travel to in order to become this real living faith to be healed he says it this way in the sermon i have heard but now i see then faith has a channel to move into if it doesn't then you've got mental intellectual faith not genuine faith from god that intellectual faith will get you nowhere might get you emotional but it won't get you the healing that you're looking for and i would say that a person who's looking for healing is not looking for a temporary healing but looking for wholeness they're looking they want to be in remission complete full remission they want it to be over they want to be done and so faith has to move into a channel if faith doesn't move to the proper channel then it remains mental faith or intellectual faith and it never becomes a genuine faith that is in that promise of god he says your intellectual faith may make you emotional but you're not going to receive the healing that you're looking for so he says in one way you cannot be healed by mental faith but then he says it this way the intellectual faith may get you emotional but not the healing you're looking for because he says in one place you can have enough mental faith to rise up out of a wheelchair he says it's true you can have enough mental faith to rise up out of the wheelchair out of a cot so mental faith can do that mental faith can work in such a way to where a person can activate a promise of god can embrace the promise of god but it's still just not purely mental it can be enough to where a person can receive it into their hearts and accept it but let me say this as long as it still is only that channel of human faith they've got to hold that faith because their healing is only going to last as long as that faith holds so i believe what brother branham is doing through a number of these statements and it's a wednesday night it's such a difficult subject for me to approach i've been very very difficult for me to harness these things to be able to share them with you i think it's good for a wednesday night audience but maybe there's we just don't have enough time to really expound upon a number of different ways that brother baum approaches this but i would say that brother branham is exposing a tangle of elements he's looking at a faith that can be all human but then he's looking at a faith that can be divinity mixed with humanity he's looking into faith that can be entirely within a particular channel but it's a law of faith and it's a law of faith that can operate outside of the elect operating that anybody can operate it it's a way that god's word now god can say god's specific purpose was for his elect but he had the right laws in order for that to be achieved and by virtue of those laws that are to god's elect there's others who can essentially exercise the authority of those laws to receive other ancillary blessings or off uh byproduct of blessings and it's all them humanly activating the word of god it says it over and over and over again that year it's your faith that uses the gift to his own gift of discernment in certain things it's your faith that does it's your faith that does it it's your own faith that does it so people by their own faith could reach into a realm and cause a gift to be be activated and even says that whenever it speaks something or says something that allows that person to just line it all up and accept it and receive their healing in that moment and it doesn't mean they have received the holy ghost and are sealed forever in the body of christ they have used a human faith that has a and i want to be careful i say it's almost a shadow of the divine faith because it's to a divine promise and god accepts it and god blesses it and grants a blessing so he's exposing a tangle if i like say that because i like the way he used that word ravel and he's he's saying things in such a way where he approaches it this way okay but then he approaches it from another way it's like all right and what i found is you try to put it all together it's expressing something to us that i want to be able to i want to visualize it for you and it may seem like we just slow way down and and may not be ending on the crescendo that we normally end on wednesday nights where we're running the aisle and we open up the doors and we just you know how it is okay you didn't didn't have to laugh that loud but let's consider let's consider the the two different states of a person so we won't say it's different two different people would just say one person in two different states and let's say it is a sinner so i refer to the sinner i mean unsaved or unsealed or a saint which should be saved or sealed the same that's the way i'm going to use that my nomenclature way i'm going to use it is you have the sinner that means they're not saved and now they could be saved at white throne but i say a sinner they do not possess eternal life they do not have the holy ghost but the saint is saved and they are sealed that's the language we're using now in this slide here in the slide 51 brother john hopefully that's where we're at now i hope you can see this all right and let's see if this works oh look at that i think i got it just okay i might be able to make this work where i can point for you so now um the this is if as you look at this i think the way i've tried to draw this out is this is the person and the colors may not match up for you perfectly but as we have the body um on this here try to make that color match up with this line here and so you have the body then you have the spirit which is that inner another realm and then you have the soul which i've marked here and i put it kind of gray because it's kind of a mixture right now this is the person as they are born and so in this person you have you have body spirit soul just represent it this way to you so we can begin to think about the trinity brother graham said and where intel intellectual faith resides now for the body the body has the five senses of what see taste feel smell and hear i still write them down still look at them and so those are the five senses that we have to that outer ring that peach ring that looks like there that's the outer person that's the body and um i'd originally maybe represented it where you had the mind maybe in the in the head and then you had the body but it's there's certain elements of taste and here and see it's all right here even in the physical part this outer person and then you have the spirit it's imagination conscience memory reason and affection those are the five senses or channels or gates to the spirit so that's every person is has a body this is the one right here that's getting tired has a spirit right that may be a little bit frustrated with the way the service is going but that's that's the body and spirit that's all every single one of us but then this is the person this is the state of a person who is not saved or sealed all of us have a soul and that soul is this part here that's represented by a heart i'm just using a heart to diagram this and i actually have it bordered with that blue part because there's this affinity to the unsaved person between that soul and the spirit because they're both natural still they're both carnal now i'm taking together uh uh you know years of brother brahms ministry 18 years of ministry uh brother brahms sermons where he's touched on these things and i feel very confident that i can express it in this way it would not be misleading but a child a person a teenager anybody who is unsaved in this world has body spirit soul the body has the senses of the uh of the flesh the spirit has the senses of the spirit and then the soul the way brother graham describes it quite a bit that i think helps us is the soul operates by free more agency in other words it's a decider it's a chooser to quote president bush i'm the decider and uh and so there's something that that makes the decision it comes to the conclusions and the the body and the mind can give the input the body and the spirit i think using the mind can sometimes be a little bit misleading but using the spirit and the body it takes in this information and it can accept or it can doubt it this is exactly how brother brown lays it out it can it can either uh some other place that can receive or reject is maybe other ways that it might be described so you have the body spirit soul you have the seed taste feel smelling here you have the imagination of conscious memory reason and affection in your spirit then in the soul there's free more agency in this soul and it can either reject or receive accept or doubt now to a born-again person this you still have the body spirit but now the soul there's been a nature change and that sense changes that sense there it is not just free moral agency anymore it is not operating of receive or doubt it can only it's only faith now so you still have a body you still have a spirit but now someone who's born again the soul has a nature change and now in the soul is only faith and so the soul is only going to respond to the word so when your spirit says well that's not true the soul may say but yeah it is right or the spirit may say well this is true and the soul's gonna say i don't think so why because it's only responding to the word of god the soul then is no longer it no longer has this capacity to receive or reject just anything and it's not even sorry based on free moral agency anymore it's sealed by god it really is the mind of christ it is a deposit of eternity you've heard from your theophany so now there's something eternal deposited in the soul the soul is sealed off remember from the sermon future home it's already in the eighth day nothing more can be added to it to be perfect and so now it's faith alone that resides there not doubt only faith but it's faith that can only be projected to the word it's a faith that can only uh be inspired by it's a it's a faith now that can only is the only thing it can really grab a hold of to work is the word otherwise if it's something else it won't it won't show this alignment and i put up there just exactly like this just so you can kind of see it in that way now i want to do a comparison between two people that demonstrates how faith works for both now this could be the same person in two different states and i'm going to read this to you and i don't know if you could if you could see this very well i realize the way it's being presented here here's a person who's not saved and i put here a snake in their heart and the heart's still gray the person over here has received the holy ghost and in there is this this is a heart that's been lit up by faith now here's how brother brown describes it in the sermon uh future home he says now here's a human heart and here's a human heart so now in this we have two human hearts you see that two people two different human hearts it's exactly the way he's drawing it up now this one over here has a snake in it and what he says that sin says here has the life this one over here has a dove in it which is the holy spirit here he has a life so this could be this two different states of the same person unsaved unsealed not born again they have body spirit soul but in the soul bremen says let's just put a snake there he's using this not as an absolute to create a doctrine but it definitely represents the hybrid nature of fallen man where he does not come direct from adam but he is hybrid born between eve and satan and he has this hybrid nature everything mixed in carnally so he has a body spirit and even his soul you could say is this malaise it's this a mongrelization it's this mixture so it's gray it it can accept it can doubt it can it can receive it can reject it has all these different elements to it but there's still a root of sin down in his soul and he says now he says now this one here i may not be able to see this very well it says this one here has malice hatred and envy see how that's superimposed over this person says this person here has malice hatred and envy and what causes it he says this is what's causing it this fellow here so it's the snake in the soul that is teaching the spirit and the body to have malice hatred and envy or the spirit to have it in the body to act on it it comes from this guy here well this one over here has love joy and long suffering or patience is how i put it here has long suffering and he says that he said that's what does it down here the dove so the reason why we act as sinners from birth is because you're born with the serpent nature so to speak a hybrid nature and it's what causes you to have malice and hatred and envy it's what causes you to sin and it comes from the soul which has not been regenerated or born again but over here we have love joy patience from the holy ghost that comes from within the soul now he says is this is this is slide 57 is that right brother john yes okay so now when you're asked or you're forgiven of your sins he says you've only done this you've only taken that away but the thing that made you do it is still there did you catch that i put it down here so you can see it actually i just forgot to put it up around the head is what i did but it's here so you can see it when you've asked for forgiveness and you've repented of your sin you've only done this in other words you've asked god to forgive you and it's kind of given you you've taken that out of your the human part the mind a sanctification of the mind because there's been some sort of agreement some accord and satisfaction of mine lord forgive me forgive my sins says you've taken this away he says but you still got this guy down in there but the thing he says the thing that made you do it is still there that's the old root of evil it's still there now again i'm demonstrating this visually so we can understand how faith works on the unsaved and the saved so now brother bam says now notice when you repent or baptize the name of jesus christ that he forgave you of your sins then secondly comes sanctification which sets your mind in order for holiness to think right the next comes the baptism of fire and holy ghost that god might dwell on us and the fire of god cleanses our hearts from sin and puts the holy ghost inside of us then we bring forth the same life that that this did because that's in us so now he's describing not just a person who has repented of these things he's done because he says when you do that it's only taken those things away but the guy that made you do it is still there so what's going to have to happen you have to keep coming back for this cleansing of the mind but never dealing with the root cause in the soul so what does he describe he describes a transformation now watch the animation how it happens the dove comes in takes away the snake and now the and the heart's changed this is what happens when you receive the holy ghost the dove comes down kills out the snake so now when someone's been born again they don't have doubt and unbelief in there they don't have well i want to believe and i want to accept but i also doubt and i also reject they don't have the both in there that is now gone and the only thing that's there is the dove and now the person has been changed from the inside from the soul and so i think so yeah i want to leave this up here to look at this and so i want to do the side by side uh comparison and for you to think about this of these people in two different states and i'm not talking about arizona or oklahoma but these two different conditions so the one on the left is the unsaved the one on the right is the saved the one on the left only has one nature human that's it that's all they have they have the human body they have the human mind they have the human soul in all its depravity and all of its weakness all of its strengths and all of its abilities the person on the left is unsaved so all they are is human but the person on the right the same person even now in a different state is both human but now there's divinity inside of them now there's deity on the inside of that soul even to the point where you can say that there's two natures now before we just run off into some doctrine on that and start want to have one wife on one nature and another wife on another nature think about it this way when you're purely human you are born body spirit soul as you begin to grow and learn that soul is is governing decisions and choices and making choices affecting and influencing your spirit influencing your body and then as it's acted in that as that control tower your entire life there are things that manifest in your body and things that are learned by your spirit and that becomes the person it's like your character your testimony your personality all these things can begin to achieve by nature and nurture and that's who you are but now when the soul changes the heart's been changed now there's a new life inside of you and even though the old snake is dead you've learned a lot from the other nature and so it still lives represented in your spirit in your body so when you're born again your nature changes but you still have a natural spirit amen think of it this way when you're unsaved you have a temporal body a temporal spirit and a temporal soul all of them can be destroyed it can be taste the second death never exist anymore but when you're when you're saved you still have a temporal body and a temporal spirit but you have an eternal soul so what happens to the elect at the rapture what's the what's that you see here unsaved you have saved and you have raptured think of it in the same way you have a glorified body a theophonic spirit and an eternal soul all of them eternal and so this is where when we still exist if you're unsaved you still exist in this channel of all human when you're saved you still have a human mind and a human body now as you look at this and this is just my way of expressing it to you as i close when we when we put it this way and we're saying this is a matter of faith that can work both for the unsaved and the saved it may seem overly simplistic or incredibly i think it's incredibly simple but yet it's complex and maybe it sounds i'm saying it's incredibly simple but it's complex and we realize that but i'm not there's no need to complicate it right the on and again i will say this as we look at this and we read as we've read these statements this is this is not doctrine in the sense that we're legalistic about this this is not to create a paradigm or some sort of construct where no it always has to fit in this way that's sometimes when we get in trouble because it always has to be threes and it always has to be sevens and as soon as something kind of varies from that you'll actually fight the word of god because you get real legalistic and rigid in your types and your numbers this is just a way that i'm wanting to present it to you to conceptualize the process and how the word preached can be heard accept it intellectually and drop even to a person's heart and they receive the benefits of it and still be in the condition that they are on the left because the unsaved believe mentally right and so when they believe mentally they're believing from the spirit and they're and they're believing from their emotions they're believing from their intellect they're believing academically and then when it comes to the soul to open up to accept to let in or to let out when it comes to the mind to kind of control that are you going to accept what the mind is thinking accept the mind that's been turned you can accept the mind that's looking to the promise looking to calvary when that part when the soul will say i believe and accept their healing god will heal a person who believes that way you know as they've had enough mental faith and in their in that realm of doubt and belief they believe it and that's why a prostitute could come to the platform and not be sanctified necessarily not have the holy ghost but still believe enough intellectually to go through the prayer line and have the power of god work on her enough for the soul to not resist it or reject it that soul acts as a womb of the spirit so the soul that that is being represented by a heart that whatever promise you're receiving it's got to take root there or it'll never come to life no matter how much you believe it in the spirit now how much you believe in that blue ring unless it comes down to the soul to believe it then it never going to manifest because that part is the womb where that's the only place that that promise can be effective but if you're still just holding it in those two realms as long as your intellect and your soul can agree you'll stay healed think about it as long as the soul and the mind remain remain in stasis as long as you don't start doubting your mind you'll stay healed as long as the soul doesn't choose to reject it you'll stay healed as long as those two remain but for the saved if i could put it this way and i want to read one more statement before we close it's really a matter of clearing out the tangle in our spirits because the holy ghost is there in the soul you've got it from the inside it's in a place where it's from the inside looking out and then we're taught that if the mind doesn't agree with it disagree with your mind when whenever whenever those other senses say anything different from the soul you're saying no from the soul you're saying nope and it's got to take everything there that's in that spirit because it's in the soul if it's in the soul it's where it belongs it's where it needs to be you've got it on the inside looking out but where the believer struggles is there's still that human cloud of the spirit that it's got to push through to manifest in the body so there's there's the same person can be at two different states that you can receive healing through an intellectual faith which is a function of aligning your human mind and your soul to believe a promise of god but that's just something temporary that's a temporal healing for a temple a temporary body but to be born again is to receive him in the soul and to be changed from the inside and this is what's represented here do i let me see if i have that quote i guess i do i'll just read it from you here bro john you could take over from here it's in the greatest battle ever fought now when he teaches the greatest back when he preaches the greatest battle ever fought brother brown uses his terminology just a little bit different i think you know where i'm going he's he uses body soul spirit but that's just a terminology or semantics he still teaches from the standpoint that we're body spirit soul the function of each is still the same but after the seals he never reverts back to this little period where he says body soul spirit so semantics can be different language can be different but in terms of the control tower where the heart is body spirit soul so he says your mind opens up and brother man says your mind is controlled by the soul if we're using the language he uses post after this when he and he never reverts back think of that your mind's controlled by your soul so the soul has this power to let in to let out to accept or reject to choose right it says your mind opens up and accepts the spirit or it rejects the spirit you can have little consciousness and little feelings little sensations and all things that has nothing to do with it that's just little sensations and things but when it comes to reality your mind opens it up your mind either accepts it or rejects it that's the whole that's the soul he says that's it friends god let none of them miss it it's your mind that opens up the door or closes the door or listens to your conscience listens to your memory listens to your affections but when your mind closes itself to those things and let god the spirit of his word come in it blows the rest of that stuff out every doubt is gone every fear is gone every sensation of doubt is gone every feeling is gone there's nothing standing there but the word of god and satan cannot battle against that no sir he cannot battle against it now we know that's truth that's where we want and this is where i think the emphasis over the last few services been you must be born again you no matter what's wrong with your body what's wrong with your spirit you want to know that your soul has been sealed that's the most important that's what we rejoice in and then if that soul is sealed what a great place to come from when we approach any promise of god amen brother brown i didn't bring the statement um and i'm not going to look i haven't even been looking at the time so i don't even know what time it is but brother branham talks about how that woman reached out and touched him by faith and was able to touch him by faith and he said she didn't even have a promise and yet she could by faith reach out and test him without a promise he says how much more should we this is someone who had faith and had in that human realm in that human state of being body spirit soul could believe enough to activate faith in god to receive her healing how much more should we who though we be in body and spirit but down in the soul have a promise and have the word of god how much more should we be activating the promises of god not intellectually not emotionally but down from the soul from that soul place and that's when you have even how the devil chose the mind chose that spirit and god chose the soul and when you get the soldier in the soul then it wants to meet the devil in that battlefield and that's where the believer's battle is your healing is not a ques a soul question it becomes a question of your spirit and let me tell you this there can be a point to where your soul and your spirit harmonize in a line and in that moment you're like healed or not healed i'm confident i'm just going forward i've got a promise with god and i'm not going to obsess about this i'm going forward we're not necessarily maybe talking about terminal situations or situations where you need to get desperate but when a person's at peace in their soul and they get everything blown out and they get the devil of doubt kicked out of there then they're the ones that can go forward and so i'm going forward i'm in i'm in this stasis i got my spirit subject to the word of god i'm bringing my body subject to the word of god i'm going forward because now it's a matter of faith not intellectual faith amen okay i'm done are you i like that nobody wanted to answer all right could we stand together
