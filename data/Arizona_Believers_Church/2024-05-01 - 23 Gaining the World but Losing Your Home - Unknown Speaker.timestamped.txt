[0:00] on Sunday we were ministering using the
[0:02] phrase uh from the devil uh I buy homes
[0:07] and in that using that phrase we were
[0:09] just looking at how Satan tricks us into
[0:11] giving up our homes uh the principle's
[0:14] been established that the house is the
[0:16] physical structure the home is something
[0:18] that's more
[0:18] intangible and how that we can surrender
[0:21] or forfeit that home life and that
[0:24] togetherness and those things that make
[0:25] a house a home while retaining the
[0:28] pretense of home or the Optics of home
[0:31] or just the house we were using the
[0:33] example in the garden how the Adam's
[0:34] home in Eden was sold in exchange for
[0:38] something that Satan offered the woman
[0:40] so there was this Bartered exchange
[0:42] where he was selling something she was
[0:44] willing to give something in exchange
[0:46] for that so it was a transaction I'd
[0:48] like to say it was a transaction for
[0:49] Value he made an offer um she accepted
[0:53] there was a consideration that was given
[0:55] and so there was this uh Satan was in
[0:58] the garden not to get the house but he
[1:00] wanted a home and it was brother Brenham
[1:03] talks about how Eve forfeited her virtue
[1:06] her virtuous rights he Eve sold her
[1:08] virtue and then there's a number of
[1:10] places where he's speaking of the devil
[1:11] and he says he sold too and he sold he
[1:14] sold he sold so we see the devil in the
[1:16] Garden of Eden um looking to uh make a
[1:19] deal and to make a transaction and what
[1:21] he wanted to buy was uh something that
[1:24] he could not create himself something he
[1:26] could not accomplish himself and brother
[1:29] Bradon makes the statement and the
[1:31] spoken word is the Original Seed he's
[1:32] speaking how Eve
[1:34] hybrid hybridized and hybrid something
[1:37] and brought the serpent in and he says
[1:39] listening for wisdom understanding
[1:42] knowledge so it's those three elements
[1:44] that he was offering her wisdom
[1:46] understanding and knowledge butam
[1:47] touches it in a number of different ways
[1:49] and if you look at the actual scriptures
[1:52] that deal with it then look at it
[1:53] through this lens how there was some
[1:55] wisdom understanding and knowledge that
[1:56] he was promising her it uh it it just it
[2:00] really opens things up to consider if
[2:02] there's something intangible or the the
[2:06] wisdom and the understanding knowledge
[2:07] or one thing but he always offers it in
[2:09] some package there's there's something
[2:11] he's giving you wanting you to uh relate
[2:13] to an enjoy or or to accept and we've
[2:16] been reading in Proverbs 24: 3 and 4 how
[2:20] that a house is built through wisdom and
[2:22] by understanding it is made firm and it
[2:25] is established and then through
[2:26] knowledge uh you can fill it up with the
[2:29] right kind of thing so wisdom builds
[2:31] understanding establishes in knowledge
[2:33] fills the rooms and every all the
[2:35] chambers with precious and pleasant
[2:38] riches so what Satan was offering her
[2:41] was wisdom understanding and knowledge
[2:43] so he was wanting to sell her what we
[2:45] would think would be the materials or
[2:47] the resources to have a home to build a
[2:49] house to establish it and to make it a
[2:51] home to fill it with all the precious
[2:53] and pleasant riches but it was a worldly
[2:56] wisdom a worldly understanding a worldly
[2:58] knowledge not in line with the word of
[2:59] of God and so we we were trying to say
[3:02] this that she sold her home and got
[3:05] Satan's Eden in exchang that the what
[3:09] he's used now to build his home and
[3:11] build his Eden is wisdom understanding
[3:13] and knowledge so through his wisdom he's
[3:16] built this home through un his
[3:18] understanding he's established it and
[3:19] has taken hold and with knowledge he's
[3:21] filling it not with these precious
[3:23] riches and pleasant riches but
[3:25] wickedness and brother baham says that
[3:27] Eve sold out to reasonings of wisdom and
[3:30] education says in one place that
[3:32] knowledge is what the devil sold Eve and
[3:36] we read that statement I thought it was
[3:38] very striking he says if you want to
[3:39] know what will be look at what has been
[3:42] and so that statement to me was this
[3:44] real important uh turning point of
[3:46] fulcrum to really uh use to say what's
[3:49] been in the garden and what's been
[3:50] through scripture is important to
[3:51] consider because he still wanted us to
[3:53] sell out to wisdom he's still wanting us
[3:56] to sell out to education he's still
[3:57] selling us knowledge not knowledge of
[3:59] the holy but he he's trying to sell us
[4:01] on his knowledge and he he's brother B
[4:04] says in one place he sold it to Eve and
[4:05] he sold it to
[4:07] us and so tonight as we go further in
[4:10] this subject if the home is more than
[4:12] the structure if the home is more than
[4:14] the furnishings and the things that we
[4:16] put in it then how can we forfeit our
[4:19] homes in the same way that Eve did and
[4:21] so I'm going to use this title tonight
[4:23] gaining the world but losing your home
[4:26] there may be a lot of things you gain it
[4:28] may be riches and it may be things that
[4:30] are uh luxurious things that are nice to
[4:33] have you may be able to have some sort
[4:35] of a pretense or the Optics of being
[4:37] successful but are we engaging in an
[4:41] exchange where we're getting something
[4:43] out of the world but losing something in
[4:45] our relationship with God and one
[4:46] another in the process and consider the
[4:50] ways that we do sell our homes on a
[4:52] daily basis in Mark 8: 36 and 37 for
[4:57] what shall it profit a man if he shall
[4:59] gain the hope world and lose his own
[5:01] soul or what shall a man give in
[5:04] exchange for his soul now again there's
[5:07] some of this tie into Sunday service so
[5:09] to the extent that it's review it's it's
[5:12] intentional now this verse 37 what shall
[5:14] a man give an exchange for his
[5:17] soul it's set forth this way that a man
[5:20] gains the world but in the process his
[5:22] soul is ransomed his soul is got
[5:24] exchanged then now having gained the
[5:27] world but paid the price of his soul
[5:30] the world is not enough to pay to get
[5:33] his soul back he says what can a man
[5:35] give in exchange for his soul though he
[5:37] has used the whole world uh gained the
[5:40] whole world and lost his soul he can't
[5:42] use the world to get his soul back so
[5:45] that should tell us that the world's
[5:46] going to offer us a lot of things um
[5:49] that we can give up in exchange for but
[5:51] what we get in exchange can't buy that
[5:54] back you need something greater you need
[5:56] a greater price you need the Lord to
[5:58] come on the scene and make the
[5:59] difference for for you and I want to
[6:01] look at it this way as if you look at
[6:03] Matthew chap 12 we'll touch on these
[6:05] things here quickly but the soul is to
[6:07] be the uh the place that the Holy Spirit
[6:11] dwells our soul becomes his the The
[6:13] Dwelling Place the habitation of the
[6:16] Holy Spirit and him having lived in him
[6:18] living in our souls it's kind of the
[6:20] idea is that it makes um our bodies his
[6:23] house to possess so the Holy Ghost is in
[6:25] our soul and then once he gets control
[6:27] of our soul he's taking possession of
[6:29] our minds ultimately one day to take
[6:31] full possession of this body so when we
[6:34] see that what shall it what shall it
[6:35] profit a man if his soul is exchanged
[6:38] for the world that soul is supposed to
[6:40] be the dwelling place of God so what
[6:42] you're giving up is his
[6:44] home and then in this image of a man
[6:47] being delivered from an evil spirit
[6:49] Jesus says when the unclean Spirit has
[6:50] gone out of a man he walketh through Dry
[6:52] places seeking rest Matthew 12: 43 to 45
[6:57] and I apologize if not every script rure
[6:59] and quote is in the slide deck tonight
[7:03] there were some things I just held back
[7:05] uh just so we could go quickly so when
[7:07] the unsp unclean Spirit has gone out of
[7:09] a man he walketh through Dry places
[7:11] seeking rest and findeth none this is
[7:13] the unclean
[7:14] Spirit then he saith I will return into
[7:18] my house from whence I came out so it's
[7:20] the unclean Spirit that's been cast out
[7:22] of a man so the spirit of a man is
[7:24] delivered from demon possession if we
[7:26] want to use that phrasing and now
[7:28] instead of the man being sealed with the
[7:30] Holy Ghost and finding somebody else
[7:32] resident in that person uh he comes back
[7:35] and it says he findeth the house the man
[7:38] empty swept and garnished and then it
[7:41] tells us that he goes and he finds seven
[7:43] other spirits that are more wicked than
[7:45] himself uh LW spirits of the baser sort
[7:48] and they enter in and dwell there and
[7:50] the last state of that man is worse than
[7:52] the first so we see the image according
[7:55] to even how brother bandham teaches this
[7:57] that he's this image of a man who is one
[7:59] possessed of an evil spirit it gets cast
[8:02] out of him but if nothing else takes
[8:03] possession if nothing else becomes the
[8:06] Lord of that house then he's empty and
[8:10] though he's empty it's not Barren it's
[8:13] swept and then garnished or adorned but
[8:15] he's not filled with the right
[8:17] things maybe he's filled with things
[8:19] that that evil spirit will actually find
[8:21] familiarity in things that this evil
[8:25] spirit can hide behind things that the
[8:27] evil spirit's like all right okay
[8:30] this is uh this isn't as foreign uh land
[8:32] as I thought it would be so you can be
[8:34] delivered but and then you fill yourself
[8:36] up with seemingly be is innocent things
[8:38] but it becomes a place for the devil to
[8:40] reside
[8:52] again so finding it
[8:55] empty we we need to be very careful in
[8:57] our own lives that we're filling our
[8:59] house houses up with the right things
[9:01] our minds our Spirits with the right
[9:03] things things that the devil would find
[9:06] uh it would make him uncomfortable to
[9:08] try to make that place a dwelling
[9:10] place but if I could describe it this
[9:12] way though it was garnished and adorned
[9:15] it wasn't it wasn't uh filled with
[9:20] things that would keep maintain The
[9:21] Possession and keep the wrong things out
[9:24] so there was a void or a vacuum for the
[9:26] world to
[9:27] enter and so in this
[9:30] exchange that he mentions how a man can
[9:35] exchange his soul for the world I want
[9:38] to use it as a parallel of exchanging
[9:40] our home for the world that the soul is
[9:43] to be a home for the Holy
[9:44] Spirit and we can in this in this
[9:47] emphasis is he's using it to teach a
[9:49] point uh not that any one of us should
[9:51] start going looking for that offer where
[9:53] we can actually gain the whole world for
[9:54] our souls but if the idea is that you
[9:56] could give up your soul but get
[9:58] something from the world in return and
[10:01] and and a man could find himself emptied
[10:03] out but not the Holy Spirit not take
[10:04] possession I want to use that as a
[10:07] parallel of how in our own personal
[10:08] lives we see that as the individuals but
[10:10] also in our families in our houses and
[10:12] in a church how we can exchange
[10:15] something of the world or something for
[10:17] the pretense or the Optics a and we pay
[10:19] the price but it creates this vacuum and
[10:22] in this exchange we lose out on the Holy
[10:25] Spirit and the presence of Christ I I
[10:28] think it's remarkable if you begin to
[10:29] think about just how many decisions we
[10:31] make every day I was fellowshipping with
[10:33] somebody on this I think it uh um
[10:35] recently on how many computations and
[10:38] things that we we decisions we make
[10:40] every
[10:41] day and how that and just how complex
[10:44] life is in those terms but transactions
[10:47] are being made every day we are making
[10:49] transactions every day as Spiritual
[10:52] Beings and we're either we're making
[10:54] transactions either to build our houses
[10:56] up to build our houses into homes or to
[10:58] sell it yeah
[10:59] now I know that may be like great you
[11:01] know now I've got to be worried about
[11:02] every decision I make whether I'm going
[11:04] organic or I'm going with this is it
[11:07] good the conversation was there's either
[11:09] good or evil and there's two influences
[11:11] God or the devil and so everything you
[11:13] do you go to reach for the you know milk
[11:15] and you're thinking am I being
[11:16] influenced by evil or good well relax
[11:19] right you know you should it be oat milk
[11:22] I think the sign I saw recently is oat
[11:24] milk the the milk that's actually made
[11:26] for humans
[11:30] it's good to have you back I'll I won't
[11:33] use it so I don't have to pay loyalty on
[11:36] it but there's in that sense I'm not
[11:39] saying this to make us nervous about
[11:40] every single decision but anything is
[11:43] say you know what I want to get serious
[11:44] about what motivates me I want to get
[11:46] serious about the the trajectory I'm on
[11:49] so that I don't get so legalistic I
[11:51] don't get so super spiritual to where
[11:53] I'm getting further away from God for
[11:54] the Optics of being Sanctified but
[11:57] recognize that there are very literal
[12:00] things we do every day to either build
[12:02] up our families or tear it down to build
[12:05] up the atmosphere in the home or to
[12:07] exchange it for Value to exchange it for
[12:11] something making doing transactions
[12:13] every day to sell our homes let me say
[12:17] that we can sell it piece by
[12:21] piece and we can also sell it Peace by
[12:25] piece because he promised us a place of
[12:28] a Peaceable habitation
[12:30] and we take peace that he's promised us
[12:32] and we exchange it and we begin to sell
[12:34] our peace peace by peace Joy by Joy Rest
[12:38] by rest for the things that the world
[12:40] has to offer so in selling it Peace by
[12:43] piece and that play on words uh Peace by
[12:45] peace isn't it isn't all at once but
[12:47] just foot by foot square foot by square
[12:51] foot footstep by footstep until the hole
[12:54] is gone just as one we could uh were to
[12:57] guard our hearts because out of it are
[12:59] the the issues of life and as we go
[13:01] through relationships and experiences we
[13:03] give up our our heart so often we're
[13:06] just piece by piece through our
[13:07] affections and our lust and our lovings
[13:09] and all those things that we're just
[13:11] giving heart our heart away over and
[13:13] over and over again to where no matter
[13:15] what we've done with our lips our hearts
[13:16] have always remained far from them and
[13:18] there's nothing left to give anymore and
[13:21] just as the children of Israel to go
[13:22] into were to go into the promised land
[13:25] and God said that he wouldn't drive
[13:26] everything out at once but by little and
[13:28] little he would drive them out until
[13:30] they were increased and inherit the land
[13:33] and it was footstep by footstep that
[13:35] they would take possession of their
[13:37] Homeland and so if possession is step by
[13:40] step and possession is is foot by foot
[13:43] then I can say that we can become
[13:45] dispossessed and we can sell it the same
[13:47] way inch by inch foot by foot if we
[13:51] build by square feet we can sell it by
[13:53] square
[13:55] feet we're putting our our houses up on
[13:58] S
[14:00] BNB and we let the devil rent out of
[14:03] room and he just doesn't want the room
[14:05] he wants to filter by whole
[14:08] house so we're transacting day by day
[14:11] gaining the world but losing our homes
[14:14] in Psalm 17 verse4 David has uh taken
[14:18] this this beautiful passage this prayer
[14:20] of David this confidence that he knows
[14:22] he's going to be found correct before
[14:24] the Lord but yet he has these enemies
[14:26] that are seeking after him to devour him
[14:28] to tear him down and we see the devil is
[14:31] in that that that's an image even of the
[14:33] devil but then he describes these men
[14:35] that want to harm him and he says
[14:38] deliver me from men which are thy hand
[14:40] oh Lord then he makes this phrase from
[14:43] Men of the world which have their
[14:46] portion in this life and it's this
[14:47] phrase I want us to really grab a hold
[14:49] of men of the world which have their
[14:51] portion in this life and then he
[14:53] describes them whose belly thou fillest
[14:55] with thy hid treasure they are full of
[14:57] children and leave the rest of their sub
[14:59] substance to their babes now what he's
[15:01] describing and I think even in the
[15:03] reading of this uh it kind of begs uh
[15:07] like what does this mean and and thy uh
[15:10] they're they're thy hand and their you
[15:11] fill their belly with these Hidden
[15:13] Treasures but as you take it all
[15:16] together men of this world which have
[15:17] their portion in this life and then he
[15:19] describes maybe how they would look and
[15:21] their their progeny but they their
[15:23] hearts are set Upon This World men of
[15:26] this world their hearts are set upon
[15:28] this world world and they don't have uh
[15:31] uh don't have or desire any other
[15:33] portion than what the world can offer
[15:35] their desires aren't set on things above
[15:38] they're not pursuing a Heavenly
[15:40] inheritance uh by appearances uh because
[15:42] their bellies are HID filled with hidden
[15:44] treasure and their children are going to
[15:47] receive a substance and a great
[15:48] inheritance by appearances they're
[15:50] prosperous uh by appearances they have
[15:53] land and they have wealth and they have
[15:55] all sorts of things and they have a lot
[15:56] of children and they can afford them and
[15:58] they're to pass down they couldn't even
[16:00] use up everything they have in this life
[16:02] so there's a great inheritance to be
[16:03] left to their children it's men of this
[16:05] world whose portions are in this
[16:09] life their their hearts are set on this
[16:12] world in Luke chapter 16:8 as we
[16:15] referred to it on Sunday how this uh
[16:18] unjust the Lord commanded the unjust
[16:20] Steward because he had done wisely for
[16:24] the children of this world are in their
[16:26] generation wiser than the children
[16:28] children of light the children of this
[16:31] world I I see this as a companion to the
[16:34] men of the world which have their
[16:36] portion in this life the children of
[16:38] this world are always scheming always uh
[16:42] conniving and contriving for uh ways to
[16:46] provide for
[16:48] themselves just as Satan is a
[16:49] businessman who's working every angle uh
[16:52] to gain something for himself to get
[16:54] something out of it for himself this is
[16:56] how the world operates this is how men
[16:58] of the world are they're not truly
[17:00] alteristic and say I just want to do
[17:02] this for you and we're wanting to do
[17:03] this for you listen when they when uh
[17:06] I'm not I'm try to get in trouble in an
[17:07] election year but when a certain side
[17:09] tells you that they're really pushing
[17:10] green initiatives you know for the
[17:13] benefit of the people you're going to
[17:14] find a lot of their initiatives actually
[17:16] are detrimental to the very communities
[17:18] that they brag that they brag that they
[17:20] love and they want to look out after and
[17:22] there's usually somebody who's getting
[17:24] green right their green initiatives have
[17:26] more to do with the almighty dollar than
[17:29] does with really uh the almighty earth
[17:31] right and so there's a there's usually
[17:34] some economics behind if you ever want
[17:35] to you ever want to find out why
[17:37] something is the way it is in the world
[17:39] just say what's the economics behind it
[17:41] whatever it is the economics behind
[17:44] it why are cold Goods square right and
[17:48] dry goods and and uh beverages that are
[17:52] not cold kept cold why are they round
[17:54] because shelf space is much cheaper than
[17:57] Refrigeration space and so they they
[17:59] want things to be uniform they want to
[18:00] pack more in it it's economics it's
[18:02] behind
[18:05] everything I read a book no I'm just
[18:08] kidding so the children of this world
[18:10] mind worldly things and not God Walk not
[18:14] as a Gentiles walk who walk after the
[18:16] vanity of their minds and they're
[18:17] they're seeking Earthly things as one uh
[18:20] translation renders it their whole
[18:22] ambition whether their inclinations be
[18:25] gring or
[18:26] refined their whole ambition whether
[18:29] they be greedy and Lusty or they seem
[18:32] very refin their whole ambition is
[18:34] bounded by this present sphere and they
[18:36] have no taste for anything beyond it
[18:39] this they're hungry for the world the
[18:41] things of the world they want wealth
[18:42] they want possessions they want cars
[18:44] they want houses they want stocks they
[18:46] they they want all these things they
[18:47] want to accumulate they're worried about
[18:49] this life and the the the reputation
[18:51] that they have so when Jesus says the
[18:54] children of this world are wiser in
[18:56] their generation than the children of
[18:57] light they're and their generation it
[18:59] means they're suited for the world that
[19:01] they're of the men of this world which
[19:03] have their portion in this life they're
[19:05] suited for this world that they're of
[19:07] because that's all they pursue that's
[19:09] all that they're interested in they seek
[19:11] nothing else but the world and what the
[19:13] world can give them you speak of
[19:15] spiritual things you speak of things
[19:16] that are Heavenly you think about
[19:17] storing Treasures up in heaven and they
[19:20] want to know what's the what's this can
[19:21] I look Heaven up online kind what's the
[19:23] ZIP code what's the run me the numbers
[19:26] uh uh I'm not going to do the market
[19:27] research just tell me if they put a
[19:28] Chick-fil-A there and I'll know the
[19:29] Market's good right you just they're
[19:31] they're in it for the money and when you
[19:33] tell them well Heaven's not on Earth
[19:35] Heaven's an atmospher and and Christ is
[19:37] a person who's unseen like well if I
[19:39] can't buy him if I can't benefit they
[19:41] don't want to have anything to do with
[19:42] it because they're wholly rooted in this
[19:44] present world and they want what this
[19:47] present world has to
[19:48] offer these are important things for us
[19:50] to consider when it comes to gaining the
[19:53] world and losing our homes Peace by
[19:56] peace where the world will offer us
[19:59] something and say you want this and
[20:01] you're like yeah I want that and you
[20:03] don't realize that in taking it it's got
[20:05] to take some place right right right it
[20:07] it it there's going to have to be some
[20:09] consideration
[20:11] given we know in Revelations 3:1 17 that
[20:14] the Bible tells us that leod deia's
[20:17] attitude is that they are rich and
[20:19] increase with goods and have need of
[20:21] nothing God's estimation of them as he
[20:23] sees them as they really are they are
[20:25] wretched miserable poor naked and blind
[20:28] and naked
[20:29] but yet they're so
[20:30] self-deluded in their riches and being
[20:33] increased with Goods that they H don't
[20:35] even want the
[20:36] Lord now I know it seems remarkable to
[20:39] think well brother Aaron we're not in
[20:41] danger at all of saying we don't want
[20:43] the Lord but really how comfortable have
[20:45] we gotten in our own abilities how
[20:47] comfortable have we gotten in what the
[20:49] Lord has done for us and we seem to get
[20:50] a little bit of momentum and we're
[20:52] thinking man I've got to think I've got
[20:53] this figured out God's blessing me
[20:55] things are working out we're making a
[20:56] little bit of money we're making a
[20:57] little bit of progress Things Are going
[20:58] good we found a good church things are
[21:00] really great but yet you begin to just
[21:02] kind of venture out on your own you're
[21:04] no longer depending upon God from start
[21:06] to finish you're no longer acting and
[21:08] behaving spiritually you're not humbling
[21:10] yourself and you kind of have this
[21:11] attitude that you don't need
[21:13] them because you're not humble anymore
[21:16] you're you're not you don't feel your
[21:18] weakness you don't feel you have too
[21:19] much self
[21:21] assurance and so those of Leo DEA have
[21:24] the abundance of things that give the
[21:26] appearance of stability they have the
[21:28] abundance of things that give the
[21:30] appearance of of Happiness they have the
[21:32] abundance of things that give the
[21:34] appearance of wealth that conspicuous
[21:37] spending uh there there are certain
[21:39] things that people buy and they buy them
[21:42] just for the sole purpose of saying look
[21:45] what I can
[21:46] afford a a and it's things that we might
[21:49] have I remember one time when I think
[21:52] when applications were just becoming new
[21:54] as we call them today apps for the cool
[21:56] kids uh and we were there were certain
[21:59] apps that were very very expensive and
[22:00] all they were is like a gold bar I was
[22:03] like what does it do nothing what's
[22:05] what's the point it's to show people
[22:07] that you paid $3,000 for that can't do
[22:10] anything else it's not going to be
[22:11] anything for but it's it's a um a status
[22:14] thing and and so there's a there's a
[22:16] mindset of being rich and increased with
[22:18] goods and finding Security in that to
[22:21] where it gives the appearance of having
[22:23] everything put together how gives the
[22:24] appearance of happiness and wealth
[22:26] brother Brown in the sermon Satan's Eden
[22:28] drawn a lot from this sermon this is a
[22:30] great time everybody has got money
[22:32] everybody can do this and everybody can
[22:34] do that money flow in every way and big
[22:36] cars and everything it really is the the
[22:40] the day and age we're living in and I'm
[22:43] not trying to trivialize anybody's
[22:45] financial situation and I'm certainly
[22:46] not making or dismissing the fact that
[22:48] there's some people that find themselves
[22:50] in Dire Straits where they are at a loss
[22:53] for or for money uh to pay for anything
[22:55] and they they have to beg for food and
[22:57] they lose their housing and there's some
[22:58] that even that we love and even some of
[23:00] us whove experienced situations where we
[23:02] feel destitute so it's a very real
[23:04] problem but anymore people can be quote
[23:06] unquote broke and still be able to buy
[23:08] $1,200 phones Drive decent cars get a
[23:12] lot of assistance and so our idea of
[23:14] poverty and depression and being broke
[23:17] is very different because everybody's
[23:19] got money everybody's got big things and
[23:21] everybody can get things it's just the
[23:23] way that things are right
[23:25] now and in Luke 17: 26 to 29 is I'm
[23:29] wanting just to kind of build up what
[23:31] this L Dean age is it says as it was in
[23:33] the days of Noah so shall it all be also
[23:36] in the days of the son of man we make
[23:38] this emphasis quite often instead of it
[23:40] remarking on the ungodliness of man and
[23:43] how his imagination was only on sin or
[23:45] evil continually and instead of raising
[23:47] up the the debauch things that they were
[23:49] doing he says they ate they drank they
[23:51] married wives and they were given in
[23:53] marriage and so it just seems very
[23:55] innocuous if we said well you know they
[23:57] were eating and drinking and you'd say
[23:59] well that's what people do around the
[24:01] dinner table and they were they were
[24:03] marrying and it just might mention
[24:05] things said this just seems to be what
[24:07] people do but yet this is really all
[24:09] they cared about the eating the drinking
[24:12] the Marans and even the giving in
[24:14] marriage there's some meanings behind
[24:15] that but it says they did this until the
[24:17] day that Noah entered the Ark the flood
[24:19] came and destroyed them all likewise as
[24:21] it was in the days of lot surely it
[24:23] would mention the the sexual depravity
[24:25] and the evilness and the wickedness but
[24:27] again it says they did eat they drank
[24:28] they bought they sold they planted they
[24:30] builded and I believe that Jesus uses
[24:33] the language that we can all identify
[24:35] with to say wow these are seemingly
[24:37] everyday innocuous routine things that
[24:39] we might be doing but yet it was
[24:41] something about the fact that really in
[24:43] the final analysis this is all they were
[24:45] doing it's all they cared
[24:47] about they ate they drank but yet it
[24:49] wasn't after spiritual things they
[24:51] bought they sold but it wasn't for the
[24:53] right kind of things they planted they
[24:55] build it but it was only Earthly things
[24:58] but the same day that lot went out of
[25:00] Sodom at rain fire and brimstone from
[25:01] Heaven destroyed them all no matter how
[25:03] much they ate they drank they bought
[25:05] they sold they planted they build it it
[25:06] still could not protect them from the
[25:08] Judgment that was to
[25:10] come and I believe that there's a real
[25:12] danger in just plowing ahead and making
[25:15] sure we have something to eat things to
[25:16] drink uhh uh clothes to wear buying
[25:19] selling planting building just getting
[25:21] in that routine of life in finding our
[25:23] Rhythm because there's a certain
[25:25] satisfaction we can find especially as
[25:26] men there's a certain satis action that
[25:28] our sisters can find in domesticating
[25:31] and there's a lot of ways we can just
[25:32] find that little that little pocket and
[25:33] feel real comfortable but if we're
[25:35] leaving out the things of God in all
[25:37] your planting buying selling and all
[25:40] that there's a transaction where you're
[25:41] losing spiritual things you're losing
[25:44] out on the blessings and presence of God
[25:46] and at some point there's going to be a
[25:48] noticeable noticeable deficit for
[25:52] believers and if you're not noticing it
[25:54] but yet it exists or you recognize that
[25:57] it exists and it doesn't bother you're
[25:58] like oh I never noticed that I guess I'm
[25:59] doing all right I would be very
[26:02] worried because these things that when
[26:04] the believer recognizes he's in deficit
[26:06] he gets very desperate and he realizes
[26:08] wait a minute I'm living far below my
[26:10] privileges doesn't matter to me if I
[26:12] make $10 million a year doesn't matter
[26:14] to me if I drive a nice car it doesn't
[26:15] matter to me if I can buy and I can do
[26:16] this and I can do that I can travel the
[26:18] world and I doesn't matter because what
[26:20] I need at the end of the day is I need
[26:21] the Lord in my life or none of this
[26:24] matters and brother Bram touches on how
[26:27] that it's a great time he's got money
[26:28] but he says it's the deceitfulness of
[26:30] the enemy we've never had a day like
[26:33] this we're now living it's Satan's eeden
[26:36] it's Satan's home this was supposed to
[26:39] be man's home God's creation is supposed
[26:41] to be home God created a garden in Eden
[26:43] this whole world was to be our domain it
[26:45] was to be our home it was to be our
[26:46] castle and it was sold in a transaction
[26:49] in the garden now Satan's made it his
[26:51] Eden he says there's never been a day
[26:53] like this it's the most cunning
[26:55] deceitful day and when I said see that
[26:58] see that it brings me to this that the
[27:01] Christian has to be more on his toe
[27:03] today than he ever was in any
[27:06] age we've got to be on our toes today on
[27:10] guard watching
[27:11] waking if we want to say
[27:14] concerned uh
[27:16] Discerning i' I'd rather I think it's
[27:19] better to be cautious and slow in things
[27:22] that just to think we're just going to
[27:23] rush in and if it messes up God will fix
[27:25] it for us I believe he does
[27:28] but sometimes there's a price to pay
[27:29] that we don't recognize in doing
[27:32] that there's a question leave it
[27:34] alone they need an answer now the answer
[27:37] is no there because there's a certain
[27:39] there certain thing I want to protect
[27:41] virtue I don't want to sell my home
[27:43] unknowingly
[27:45] unwittingly in mark 4: 19 Jesus in the
[27:48] parable The swer Good Seed was sewn into
[27:50] the world the seed found it sewn into
[27:52] the ground as the seed is being sewn
[27:55] there's different states of this ground
[27:57] and the state of the ground determined
[28:00] whether not the word was going to be
[28:02] fruitful and he says this about the seed
[28:05] that was sewn in ground where there was
[28:07] Weeds otherwise was good ground so it
[28:09] could nurture growth but it says in the
[28:11] cares of this world and the
[28:12] deceitfulness of riches we're living in
[28:15] an age where it says where the men of
[28:17] this world have their portion in this
[28:19] life and it's opulent it's conspicuous
[28:22] it's out there it's for show there's a
[28:25] lot of pressure anymore to meet certain
[28:27] Optics and and to keep up with the Jones
[28:30] there's a there's a lot of pressure to
[28:31] accumulate and we're living in an age
[28:33] where they're rich and increased with
[28:35] goods and brother says the
[28:37] deceitfulness in a Leo Dean age where we
[28:40] have to be on our toes more than there
[28:41] ever was in any age and it says the
[28:44] cares of this world the deceitfulness of
[28:46] riches why are they deceitful the riches
[28:48] are presented to us in a way that it
[28:50] satisfies but it's deceiving because
[28:52] it'll always leave us empty the house
[28:54] when it was found was empty no matter
[28:56] what it had been garnished with it left
[28:58] it in empty no matter how much it was
[29:01] accessorized and no matter how rich
[29:03] things were put into it and it could
[29:04] have all the instagrammable appeal
[29:06] inside of it but yet it was still empty
[29:10] because it was the deceitfulness and the
[29:11] vanity of riches the cares of this world
[29:14] the deceitfulness of riches and the lust
[29:15] of other things that phrase to me just
[29:18] kind of goes out and grabs everything
[29:19] else the lust of other things entering
[29:21] in choke the word and the word becomes
[29:26] unfruitful the of this world the
[29:28] deceitfulness of riches and the lust of
[29:30] other things entering in these are three
[29:33] things that we transact in that sell our
[29:36] homes in Satan's Eden brother bam speaks
[29:39] about how that Satan by his gospel
[29:41] programs of knowledge better education
[29:43] higher ethics civilization and so forth
[29:46] has Bewitched the people that want to
[29:48] serve God into believing his
[29:51] lie I I I I I know the instinct is to
[29:54] think but I don't believe the Trinity
[29:56] I'm not out there in denominations
[29:59] and and there's this uh and I think it's
[30:01] it's worth noting that you're here it's
[30:04] worth noting that you've come out of
[30:05] Babylon it's worth noting that you H you
[30:07] have you're not believing the lies of a
[30:09] denominational system and baptizing in
[30:12] titles and a a and believing a lot of
[30:14] false Doctrine but Satan is still very
[30:16] cunning he's still very deceitful and if
[30:18] he's not going to get you out on
[30:20] religion and false Doctrine he'll try to
[30:21] get into your life to get you out on
[30:23] worldliness and if he doesn't get you
[30:25] out on the base things of drugs and
[30:27] alcohol sexual perversion there's still
[30:29] a lot of other ways that we're selling
[30:31] our minds and selling our times and
[30:33] becoming slaves to lust that's not
[30:35] always in the marijuana and the and the
[30:37] crack cocaines and the things that we
[30:39] think it might
[30:41] be
[30:42] Bewitched bewitching the people that
[30:44] want to serve God through his lies
[30:47] through his salesmanship
[30:49] am it's programs of knowledge and
[30:52] civilization he says in this great
[30:54] deceitful age he's ready to take his
[30:56] throne by his people he's built himself
[30:59] with an intellectual educated scientific
[31:03] Eden science scientific preacher
[31:06] scientific Church scientific theology
[31:09] everything is scientific everything is
[31:12] on the basis of knowledge we call it a
[31:15] veil of knowledge lust lust knowledge a
[31:18] a veil of knowledge and lust is what she
[31:21] had been veiled with or a knowledge for
[31:23] lust it was something that he had
[31:24] captured her with
[31:28] I want us to take to heart this as a
[31:30] microscope and examine our hearts listen
[31:32] if you're being challenged in some way
[31:34] to to let go of the teachings of the
[31:36] gospel and to water down the word of God
[31:39] when it says that you ought to live a
[31:40] certain way and if you're wrestling with
[31:41] whether or not it says you should be
[31:43] baptized in name of the Lord Jesus
[31:44] Christ by all means the devil's trying
[31:46] to sell you a bill of goods that is that
[31:48] are aive he's trying to pull your faith
[31:50] away from the the true word of God he's
[31:52] he's trying to work in programs and
[31:54] better education and higher ethics and a
[31:57] and more accepting and drawing the
[31:58] bigger Circle and things like that sure
[32:00] he still works in that so whether it be
[32:02] those things in other programs he works
[32:06] deceitfully on the basis of knowledge he
[32:09] works deceitfully trying to sell us
[32:11] wisdom understanding and knowledge in
[32:13] order to get us to transact for things
[32:16] that we can possess to make ourselves
[32:18] feel good and make ourselves feel
[32:19] important but we're losing out on the
[32:21] real important things in doing
[32:24] so in this postmodernist world that we
[32:27] live in this leodan age this postmodern
[32:30] atmosphere in the the the atmosphere of
[32:32] leod deia there's a Lust For worldly
[32:34] knowledge contrary to the word of God it
[32:37] is
[32:38] completely uh enamored with the
[32:41] knowledge the tree of knowledge of Good
[32:43] and
[32:44] Evil and it's turned itself away from
[32:47] the way of the tree of life we wanted to
[32:49] present that in an image on Sunday that
[32:52] when man was kept from the way of the
[32:54] tree of life we're brought back to that
[32:55] in this hour to where we we can live now
[32:58] in this hour after the way the manner of
[33:00] Life the precepts the principles the
[33:01] knowledge the understanding of the tree
[33:03] of life and not just on the tree of
[33:05] knowledge of Good and
[33:07] Evil I mentioned it on Sunday about this
[33:11] book it published in 2011 on Western
[33:15] Civilization uh and it was explaining
[33:17] how that Western Civilization being
[33:19] relatively young in in the light of
[33:21] human history how it was able to take
[33:23] over the
[33:24] world and and the the author admits he's
[33:27] using a kind of phrase to he says to get
[33:29] my kids attention and get young people's
[33:30] attention he called these things killer
[33:32] apps that the western civilization
[33:35] developed and it was competition science
[33:38] rule of law modern medicine consumerism
[33:41] and work
[33:42] ethic and he says we call him killer
[33:45] apps he said I'm just using guess he was
[33:46] in 2011 he was using it to be cool uh
[33:50] but he said basically they institutions
[33:52] or they use these killer apps to create
[33:54] a unique set of social
[33:56] institutions that all of Western Society
[33:59] became engrossed in and adopted ideas of
[34:03] competition science rule of law modern
[34:05] me medicine consumism and work ethic to
[34:08] where there's things that we do today in
[34:10] American society that were foreign to
[34:12] Eastern Society foreign to European
[34:14] countries foreign even to to western
[34:16] eastern civilizations and so we
[34:18] developed a certain killer apps a way of
[34:20] life and a way of consuming and a way of
[34:22] growing a way of working the modern
[34:24] medicine rule of law and they became
[34:26] social inst institutions that we all
[34:28] became invested in and so those social
[34:31] institutions motivated Society to
[34:34] accumulate great wealth and become very
[34:36] very strong to conquer the
[34:37] world but now the East has co-opted them
[34:40] and China is doing the very same thing
[34:42] using competition science rule of law
[34:44] modern medicine consumerism and work
[34:46] ethic to create institutions that we
[34:49] join that we become a part of and we
[34:51] work within their
[34:53] framework and we should ask ourselves I
[34:56] I I like just how succinct this
[34:59] gentleman put it in terms of competition
[35:01] science rule of law modern meth medicine
[35:03] consumerism and work ethic this
[35:05] describes civilization and I believe
[35:07] it's describing to us Satan's
[35:14] Eden in can't remember just I think when
[35:17] we were ministering on and you'll have
[35:19] to remind me because you remember it
[35:20] perfectly we ministered three or four
[35:23] years ago on wisdom resolves the
[35:25] complexities a a and this in this day
[35:28] and age we living in I was joking about
[35:29] you remembering it but I remember going
[35:31] through this in great detail and so I'm
[35:33] going to I'm going to mention that and
[35:35] bring it back up and connecting to
[35:38] Satan's Eden that Satan created a lust
[35:41] in the woman for
[35:43] knowledge and then with knowledge became
[35:45] a lust for an
[35:46] experience right first she lusted for
[35:48] knowledge but then her knowledge created
[35:50] a craving for to act on
[35:54] it and this L to see an economy that
[35:56] we're now in that Satan has built this
[35:58] to his perfect Eden Satan's Eden he's
[36:01] built it to his Perfection we're now
[36:04] living in an age that is dominated by
[36:07] this Commerce of knowledge that leads to
[36:10] experience the and that's the endgame in
[36:13] all this is
[36:15] experience when we had this this
[36:17] onslaught of this information age and we
[36:19] called it a digital age we called a
[36:20] computer age or an Information Age it
[36:22] was a shift from
[36:24] industrialization to data
[36:26] computerization
[36:27] so you have this industrial things are
[36:29] working but then things get more H uh
[36:31] more in terms of digital or
[36:34] informational and as we could go through
[36:36] these things just even the how the this
[36:40] Industrial Revolution brings on this uh
[36:44] the Industrial Revolution brought on the
[36:45] Industrial Age so when you see this
[36:46] Revolution and you see things being
[36:48] turned upside down then this is where
[36:50] there's a revolution it brings on an age
[36:52] and now the the the digital Revolution
[36:54] is brought on the information age
[36:57] and each one of these revolutions if
[36:59] it's a revolution it causes a revolt and
[37:02] it's been a revolt against God's word
[37:03] and Faith with each one there has been a
[37:07] rebellion against God's word there's
[37:08] been a letting go of
[37:10] faith and this is kind of how the sociol
[37:13] sociologists kind of look at this in
[37:15] terms of this revolution this data
[37:17] Revolution that's led us into an
[37:19] information age and now that we've had
[37:22] this age of information for a number of
[37:24] decades now the information is leading
[37:26] us to a place where we can make
[37:27] application for of what we've learned
[37:29] and this digital age is now it's left us
[37:32] somewhat empty where there's only so
[37:34] much that could take place
[37:35] industrialization led to an industrial
[37:37] age and then once we get into the
[37:39] information age it leads to this uh this
[37:41] uh informational Revolution digital
[37:43] Revolution leads to an information age
[37:45] but mankind is not happy just knowing he
[37:48] wants to experience and so now we've
[37:50] entered into an experience
[37:52] age where the way that they describe it
[37:54] is we're not just passively sharing
[37:56] information we're not just
[37:58] passively uh acquiring information but
[38:00] we're actively now trying to show
[38:02] experiences things have to be very
[38:04] visual there was a time when oh email
[38:07] and chat and oh man that was that was
[38:09] great if you could text and you could
[38:10] you could get into uh log on to perch
[38:13] and get into the Believers chat and
[38:14] start to H H uh text one another and
[38:17] those things and get to know one another
[38:19] I mean there's things that you could
[38:20] that I thought that was amazing but now
[38:22] it's got to be video right and things
[38:25] it's we're trying to share experiences
[38:27] and and things are visual and they're
[38:29] all meant to sensitize and engage and to
[38:31] get us to desire those experiences
[38:33] ourselves the phrase that I have that
[38:35] has stuck with me the age of telling is
[38:38] over it is the age of
[38:40] showing true and so in Satan's dialogue
[38:43] with the woman there was this moment in
[38:46] his sales sales pitch where he was
[38:48] selling her on the idea brother B says
[38:50] oh the idea the idea the idea but then
[38:52] he said talk is cheap enough's enough
[38:54] it's time to get down to business can
[38:57] can we seal the deal do you want to
[38:59] experience it do you want to not just
[39:00] know it but really know it and so we're
[39:03] living in a time with all the technology
[39:05] with all the the digital Revolution with
[39:07] everything that we have it's not just
[39:10] innocent interacting with the
[39:11] information it's just not the innocent
[39:13] accumulation of knowledge it has the
[39:15] effect of causing us to seek after
[39:18] experiences it's the same method of
[39:20] operation that the devil used in the
[39:22] beginning where he tells he tells he
[39:25] tells we exper we we get knowledge get
[39:27] knowledge we get knowledge then we begin
[39:28] to act upon that
[39:30] knowledge now I use that that portion to
[39:34] set this idea up and I'm not sure just
[39:38] how I'm going to be able to unpack this
[39:41] tonight you know as far as I'm concerned
[39:44] there's never a shortage of inspired
[39:46] things from the word of God to dig
[39:47] into and
[39:49] so the uh you I'm not just trying to
[39:52] find you know fill the blank space on a
[39:55] page so we can make it through a
[39:56] Wednesday night
[39:58] you know we weigh these things out in
[40:00] our hearts hoping that we're sharing
[40:01] something that's a benefit to you and I
[40:04] hope there's been um a spiritual
[40:06] continuity with the things we've shared
[40:07] to this point because I want to just I
[40:09] want to put this in here as a challenge
[40:11] to be very very
[40:13] practical with the these different
[40:16] revolutions that came on the Industrial
[40:18] Revolution bringing on the Industrial
[40:19] Age the digital Revolution bringing on
[40:21] the information age a and then now we
[40:23] get in this age of experience life has
[40:27] changed quite a bit
[40:29] Lifestyles and the concept even of Home
[40:32] has changed and evolved
[40:34] significantly I'm going to kind of pull
[40:36] back the curtain on something for just a
[40:38] moment then we'll get back into the
[40:39] scriptures we'll get back to Revelations
[40:41] 3 but throughout all time the concept of
[40:45] Home has always been less physical and
[40:47] more intangible we said that it's
[40:49] feelings it's a place it's a belonging
[40:52] you can't put your finger on it but it
[40:54] feels like home home sweet home those
[40:56] ideas it's not how sweet house it's uh
[40:59] it it's there's no place like home not
[41:01] necessarily no place like
[41:03] house and so the if home is where the
[41:05] heart is and there is even this idea
[41:07] that it's not necessarily a physical
[41:09] thing but it's there's something to
[41:12] it now what's remarkable then if home
[41:16] has always been somewhat
[41:18] intangible I want to talk about this I
[41:20] want to point to this technology and
[41:23] whether we're referring to the internet
[41:24] or The Internet of
[41:25] Things uh but
[41:29] technology has created a virtual
[41:32] space that impacts our pride our
[41:35] self-esteem and our
[41:37] identity there was a time when your
[41:40] actual zip code said something about
[41:43] maybe what you class you were of and the
[41:46] car you drove the clothes you wore and
[41:49] and things could be relegated to what
[41:50] side of town you lived on or where you
[41:52] were from and your identity was wrapped
[41:54] up your pride was in things you
[41:55] possessed but nowadays there's very
[41:57] virtual spaces that have just as much of
[41:59] an impact on a person's Pride their
[42:01] self-esteem their self-worth and even
[42:03] their identity as physical things if not
[42:07] more that there's a lot of people that
[42:09] have more stock in their digital
[42:11] footprint and their image online and
[42:13] worry more about that than the reality
[42:16] of their natural lives that they're more
[42:19] interested in putting on a front that
[42:21] they're healthy more interest putting on
[42:23] a front that they're wealthy than they
[42:25] are about really looking after their
[42:26] health
[42:28] in gaining
[42:29] wealth because they have more there's
[42:32] more at risk in their minds there's more
[42:35] to gain in the pretense of the
[42:38] internet and so what's happened is this
[42:40] virtual space that is not even
[42:43] tangible this digital world that's been
[42:45] created this digital economy has invaded
[42:48] our domestic
[42:50] lives that life could have been
[42:53] described at one point a as home and
[42:56] house and who you marry and your
[42:58] children and what you ate and what you
[42:59] wore and the cars you drove and and
[43:02] there was some Rhythm to life where if
[43:03] the children the husband went out into
[43:05] the field with the sons and work they
[43:06] came back home where the women had
[43:08] remained that day and cooked and cleaned
[43:10] and there was just this this sphere of
[43:13] dwelling things that are tangible and
[43:15] things you could look out after and
[43:17] things that you could make improvements
[43:19] on and things you took pride and and
[43:21] things that had value and worth I hope
[43:23] that you could kind of fellowship with
[43:24] me just in that creating that picture
[43:26] very quickly but now there's an unseen
[43:29] image there's a second life there's an
[43:33] avatar there's an identity there's a
[43:37] Persona where these things are kind of
[43:39] out there and we're we're presenting
[43:41] ourselves a certain way and and we're
[43:43] worried about how people perceive us and
[43:45] we and we want to be looked at and
[43:47] belong and we exist in Realms May some
[43:49] of you might actually have a handle and
[43:52] some sort of forum or some sort of hobby
[43:54] or some sort of group and you have your
[43:56] own identity there they have no idea
[43:58] what you look like they have no idea who
[43:59] you
[44:00] are but you have some sense of belonging
[44:02] and worth in this Niche Digital
[44:08] World you
[44:10] identify with link or whatever it
[44:13] is you guys know what I'm talking
[44:16] about or Super
[44:20] Mario or Master Chief what I try to
[44:23] think of things I don't I don't know
[44:25] I'll play more video games
[44:29] but we identify and they become it's
[44:31] invaded our
[44:33] lives and this is a statement that I
[44:36] read that just overwhelmed me it was in
[44:38] a study it said as if there wasn't
[44:40] already enough going on under the
[44:41] surface in each home from age to
[44:44] Identity to gender politics other
[44:46] there's age politics identity politics
[44:48] gender politics politics politics
[44:50] politics this Network Technology brings
[44:53] the influences of these other
[44:55] stakeholders be careful what words you
[44:57] use but these influences of other
[44:59] stakeholders to bear on how we engage
[45:02] with the people with whom we share our
[45:04] most intimate
[45:05] lives may not sound like English so let
[45:08] me just try to figure out a way to say
[45:10] this our digital connections our lives
[45:13] beyond this the tangible our internet
[45:16] existence our gaming existence our the
[45:19] chat groups the forums everything that
[45:21] exists in that social media world that
[45:24] this being connected to things beyond
[45:26] our families and beyond our homes and
[45:28] our real living it brings the influences
[45:31] of the stakeholders and the individuals
[45:34] and those who have equity in all these
[45:36] other Realms to influence how we
[45:39] interact and engage and perceive the
[45:42] people that we love the most and the
[45:44] people that are closest to us physically
[45:47] and whom we actually share physical
[45:49] space with and sleep under the same
[45:52] roofs together
[45:54] with that the opinions and attitud of
[45:57] people in the world that we've never met
[45:59] we have a joke in our family when
[46:00] something says somebody wow we read this
[46:02] we read that and it's like is that Nancy
[46:03] in
[46:04] Tennessee right because just some random
[46:07] Tweeter and some exer in
[46:10] Tennessee is dropping knowledge and
[46:12] pining on stuff well that was the worst
[46:14] decision ever made and this happens and
[46:15] that happens and we just spout it off as
[46:17] if it's gospel and it's just Nancy and
[46:20] Tennessee God bless Nancy in
[46:23] Tennessee but we're more in tune to the
[46:26] opinions of Nancy in
[46:27] Tennessee we're more in tune to what
[46:30] These Guys these people will never meet
[46:32] people we can would never really know
[46:34] what they say and what they do oh did
[46:35] you see so and so is now cleaning their
[46:37] home with this did you see this
[46:38] influencer we're baking more recipes by
[46:41] Mormons and and whatever else and sewing
[46:44] clothes that the uh uh the Jehovah
[46:46] Witness make then we are in tune to the
[46:48] people around us who got really good
[46:50] ideas sor
[46:58] But continuing it says this network of
[47:01] digital things allows these other things
[47:04] of the world influence us and our
[47:07] perceptions and our interactions with
[47:09] those that we share our most intimate
[47:11] lives and we are now in the process of
[47:14] negotiating new
[47:16] boundaries with our time our attentions
[47:19] and our domestic order they say
[47:21] hierarchies but domestic order our
[47:24] domestic rankings our hierarchy of what
[47:26] we value you because of this other world
[47:30] that now exist and I I'm saying this
[47:32] because the concept of Home has changed
[47:34] to where now we don't we have exchanged
[47:36] something about home life for a digital
[47:39] world in this digital Revolution that we
[47:41] now need to experience and accumulate in
[47:44] that there there's been this exchange
[47:45] where home was very simplistic but now
[47:48] home isn't even what it used to be
[47:50] because now we're being influenced by
[47:51] all these outward things and we're
[47:53] having to negotiate new
[47:55] boundaries new boundaries with our time
[47:57] our attention and domestic order and
[48:01] responsibilities I mean does it does it
[48:03] strike something in you does it make
[48:05] sense what maybe the devil's trying to
[48:07] do I'm looking for eye contact and
[48:08] something does it make sense how there's
[48:10] been a shift in some of these things
[48:13] where before it's really simple man we
[48:14] need to straighten our home up and and
[48:16] it meant something but now there's such
[48:18] a flood of the world we've had to
[48:21] negotiate new boundaries and they say
[48:22] well what does this mean they use a
[48:23] phrase in this writing called home
[48:26] Multiplicity
[48:28] how that the rooms that we used to have
[48:29] for a specific purpose they were used
[48:31] for a specific use the bedroom was a
[48:34] place that you slept and kept personal
[48:36] possessions the kitchen was a place
[48:38] where you ate together a the the dining
[48:40] room table is a place that you ate
[48:41] together as a family that these rooms
[48:43] that had specific use and purposes have
[48:46] now been co-opted by other digital
[48:49] things other digital task used to be
[48:52] that you would maybe sleep in your room
[48:55] and that's where you kept your clothes
[48:56] but you can sleep in your room work in
[48:58] your room eat in your room never leave
[49:00] your
[49:01] room the kitchen table is a place where
[49:03] the family made meals but now it's a
[49:05] place where you do
[49:06] homeschool you do work right and you eat
[49:11] yeah I mean I'm not I'm not preaching
[49:14] against it beards on the other
[49:17] hand got a real problem with those
[49:20] things but I'm just saying just think
[49:22] just think realistically about our home
[49:24] life and how that life there there's not
[49:26] a there's not a wall anymore there's not
[49:28] divisions we don't get distance from
[49:31] certain things and and and and we know
[49:33] the specific things that something was
[49:34] used for this is the place where we do
[49:36] this this is the place where we do that
[49:38] our hes growing up we had a for some of
[49:40] us and the testimonies I've heard from
[49:41] others they had a room where that's
[49:42] where they listened to the message
[49:44] together and that's where they prayed
[49:45] together as a family but now we could
[49:47] carry the world with us everywhere we go
[49:49] and we can watch sports here we can do
[49:50] work here we can do all sorts of things
[49:53] everywhere and it's called This Home
[49:54] multiplicity to where what the way I saw
[49:57] in my mind is we've just divided up the
[49:59] home right the intangible idea of home
[50:02] and we sell it to all these different
[50:04] spheres because there's no sacredness
[50:09] anymore and the phrase they use this is
[50:11] a direct statement each online activity
[50:13] has imposed itself on our home
[50:16] practice we're experiencing a domestic
[50:20] transition and it says it complicates
[50:22] characteristics of the physical space
[50:27] just just leaning into that
[50:29] idea that the concept of Home has
[50:33] changed that when we
[50:35] changed the
[50:38] home in a in a spiritual sense it's it
[50:42] it's come to Bear even on what our
[50:44] houses are
[50:46] like in this home
[50:49] multiplicity our homes aren't
[50:51] sanctuaries
[50:53] anymore they're not a place of respite
[50:56] from the
[50:58] world but these Network Technologies
[51:02] have invaded our domestic space and each
[51:05] online
[51:07] activity is imposing itself on our home
[51:11] lives where you're going to need an
[51:14] internet connection for your
[51:16] toaster
[51:18] right there's certain things you buy now
[51:20] that are connected and if you don't use
[51:22] the the the designer brand replacement
[51:25] it tells
[51:27] you know it tells the company shut that
[51:29] thing off don't let it
[51:32] work was thinking today is that we had
[51:34] some problems here at the church with
[51:35] the air conditioner and brothers we're
[51:36] working hard to get it working I
[51:38] remember one time at a church I went to
[51:39] before it was 7 6:30 7:00 at night at
[51:42] the church and also the power went off
[51:45] like what happened the power went off
[51:46] and so I got a hold of somebody and I
[51:48] said hey our power is off called the
[51:49] secretary treasur and said the power is
[51:51] off and he's like oh no I haven't been
[51:52] paying the electric bill like well you
[51:55] better pay the electric Bill we're not
[51:57] going to be able to have church tonight
[51:58] so he called the power company made a
[52:00] payment and they turned the power back
[52:01] on never even visited the
[52:03] church so there's this connectedness
[52:05] with all things that can control and
[52:07] manipulate and we have all these
[52:09] tentacles of the world in our lives and
[52:11] it's complicating
[52:12] life to a high
[52:23] degree I I I'll I'm going to skip um
[52:27] quite a bit here and and maybe push it
[52:30] over to
[52:31] Sunday I think it'll work just well
[52:33] there I hope it
[52:35] does but as it was in the days of lot as
[52:38] it was in the days of
[52:40] Noah Jesus said even thus shall it be in
[52:43] the
[52:43] day when the son of man is
[52:47] revealed in that very picture of eating
[52:50] drinking
[52:51] planting building buying selling
[52:55] marrying all that and the judgments that
[52:58] followed it says the son of man's going
[53:00] to be
[53:01] revealed that in the midst of an age of
[53:06] experience in the midst of an age that's
[53:08] so caught up in the cycle of life and
[53:10] all the things of
[53:12] life that there is God is going to
[53:15] unveil himself and there's going to be a
[53:17] glimpse of the original
[53:20] Eden and there's going to be a
[53:21] revelation given to the people of God
[53:23] that stands in stark contrast to the
[53:25] attitudes of mindsets of the
[53:28] people the Bible says and by knowledge
[53:30] shall all of its Chambers be filled with
[53:32] precious and pleasant riches where there
[53:34] is Vision divine revelation there is
[53:37] true
[53:38] happiness there is where there is vision
[53:41] and Revelation where the revealing of
[53:42] the son of man is that's a Lifeline to
[53:46] be built up where the word of God is
[53:48] there's Health in my bones where the
[53:50] word of God is there's there's health
[53:52] for my house where the word of God is
[53:54] where the word of God can be lifted up
[53:56] that's substance I can live by that I
[53:58] don't have to be consumed with all the
[54:00] getting of the world with all my getting
[54:02] get wisdom and understanding that these
[54:04] are things that I can live by I can live
[54:07] by the word of God and not have to worry
[54:09] about bread I can live by the word of
[54:11] God and not have to worry about clothing
[54:13] I can live by the word of God and not
[54:15] have to worry about a house because
[54:18] these things are greater brother Bram
[54:21] and Satan's Eden says this is a great
[54:22] time everybody's got money everybody can
[54:24] do this and everybody can do that money
[54:25] flowing every way and big cars and
[54:27] everything and he says there won't be
[54:29] one of them in that
[54:31] City there won't be one car one
[54:35] airplane no brother John will say I I
[54:39] was a pilot like P pilot what your
[54:42] body no it'll be altogether a different
[54:46] civilization it'll be again a
[54:48] civilization not of knowledge not of
[54:50] science but of
[54:52] innocence and faith in the Living
[54:55] God not a civilization of competition
[54:58] science rule of law modern medicine
[55:00] consumerism and work
[55:02] ethic think how those broad headings can
[55:04] cover so much in our daily lives of what
[55:07] institutions we've subscribed to and the
[55:09] side hustles we have the accumulation of
[55:11] wealth and the consuming and the rule of
[55:13] law and modern medicine science and
