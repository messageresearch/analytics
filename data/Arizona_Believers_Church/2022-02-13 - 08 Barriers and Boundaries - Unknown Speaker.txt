TRANSCRIPT
========================================
first corinthians chapter 13 starting with verse one very familiar scripture reading is it speaking about charity it says though i speak with the tongues of men and angels of men and of angels and have not charity i'm a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol and though i have the gift of prophecy and understandable mysteries and all knowledge and though i have all faith so that i could remove mountains and have not charity i am nothing and though i bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though i give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing charity suffereth long in this kind charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself is not puffed up does not behave itself unseemly seek if not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoice in truth beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things charity never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away let's pray together heavenly father we're bowing our heads and our hearts before you today with an expectation that you desire to speak to us so now lord we purposely and deliberately lay aside any demand of our upon our thoughts in any other demand upon our time and we focus on you with this time that we do have together today lord we desired that you would speak to us in a special way and we're committing these things to you lord we pray for brother osario jr with this mass that they found lord may it just be gone may he be healed may there be no nothing detrimental may there any anything that's wrong lord just be cured now by by his faith in your word by this offering up of prayer lord for the different needs we have in our body and anyone that's sick anyone that's hurting anyone that finds themselves in a difficult situation and they're not sure which way to turn lord may you give them direction give them peace lord we pray even for brother loyal that he's preparing his heart to minister wednesday may you just bless him in a special way bless the congregation is it his first time ministering here lord we just would that anything be moved out of the way that would hinder and lord now as we approach your word come take control of it for your glory in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen you may be seated now this is part eight on the subject of barriers and boundaries and i'm just going to give a quick recap on the subject of setting limits because i want to take a step further today and just give a recap on how that we took from some luke chapter six matthew chapter five some different characteristics that jesus speaks of about the believer that some could use either to manipulate us into uh being manipulated uh or cause us you know put us in a position we have to compromise because well this is what a christian does and this is what a christian ought to do and we found that as we take the whole word into consideration that those things speak to a truth and they're immutable and they're perfect but yet you can't use the word of god to cause a believer to sin and so you can't use the word to justify evil and we saw that the word gives us authority to set boundaries and that instead in those boundaries it is for our protection but most importantly for our perfection that god has not just simply put things in his word so that we can kind of navigate this life and get through it without being bitter but it's to remove any hindrance or any barrier to us coming to perfect faith into the knowledge of the son of god in a in the full and complete way that god wants us to and we recognize that there's measures of faith that are given and we want that faith that we have to mature to full measure we want to be from faith to perfect faith we know that even we have a love and that paul in philippians prays that our love would abound more and more in more comprehensive knowledge and discernment and judgment and so there's things that abound and things that grow and so the word of god gives us these uh things to live by principles to live by in ways that you protect your spirit and and avoid certain offenses and allow in your spirit to be defiled so that that keeps you free to be influenced by the word of god and as we looked at the different instances where god is authorizing us to to set a boundary or to set a limit it kind of works the other way as a warning from god to not violate boundaries that if if there's a boundary in the word of god and we we can set that boundary but it also speaks to us as believers that we don't ever want to cross that boundary and we don't ever want to engage in hurtful conduct or be insensitive and i know this is maybe very elementary and not anything that's very deep and if you have a little bit of a part of you that wants your ear scratched for deep things just keep praying and and there's plenty of deep things to touch on and i know it may seem very shallow and very surface but maybe we just use an example that we can all relate to and i believe the holy spirit can make it just as deep as you need it to be in your life because there's a lot of applications of this and so in setting limits we saw how jesus used the uh said if if you get smite if someone smites you on the cheek uh on your right cheek you turn to them the other cheek and in the way even brother brandon approached that you would ask the question well brother what did you do that for it's uh the setting limits that's that's a part of saying you know what you just can't treat me any way you want to treat me or i i don't have to subject myself to behavior ideas or thoughts or opinions that uh harm my spirit and and weaken my faith i can make this decision i don't have to expose myself to everything because i'm a christian and because i have faith and and we can survive it all that's not what god asked us to do but in the responding we saw that there was this demonstration that when you do that you're demonstrating to others uh what is right again for your protection but also for their correction that when you as a christian can speak and when whenever you say something and there's some very interesting pr principles this is just kind of coming into my head it's something that i learned recently that uh i'm about to use a word that's going to cause a lot of people to flip out that in the koran that jihad all right you with me so far take up another offering after we teach on this one uh that jihad is that's merely being able to speak not in the sense that maybe we think about it maybe not the fox news paradigm maybe let's think of something maybe a little bit more moderate uh the politico maybe how they would use it that there's a um that there's the only thing that one thing you have within your right is to speak in the face of your oppression that you don't have to you don't have to overturn anything you don't have to overthrow anything but one way to do what is right not in the sense of declaring jihad on all the westerners and christianity but just to stand for your faith is the one thing you can do is to speak up in the face of oppression and i thought wow that's a very good principle because the word of god tells us that that is one thing that we can maintain and we can do is to maintain our profession to maintain the right words and to say the right things and jesus in telling us to turn the other cheek wasn't telling us to run the other way but but to respond in a particular way to the offense so it's not fleeing it's not fighting it's certainly not freezing in the face of the offense but it's having the right response that protects you and provokes the offender and we can even look at it the way it's a christ-like response that addresses the violation you respond in a way where christ says the christ character in you says that's not appropriate and and and you do it for your protection so that you don't have to be influenced to do something you wouldn't want to do and then and then also it signals to this other person that that behavior that they're they're wrong or they shouldn't suggest that you say well what application does this have it has a lot of different applications there's ways sometimes that when we're responding to a request that we give an excuse or we answer it in such a way to where it's like well you know i i don't i don't know about that or i'm busy or you know i i i i'm not feeling well right now i don't want to do that and basically what we're doing is we're putting up a barrier to why we can't do it right instead of saying i don't believe that would be conduct becoming of a christian and putting up a wall putting up a a boundary and so there's ways that we can approach things to where we're not saying the right thing we're not responding the right way to give our testimony and to signal and declare look this this is what i this is how i feel and these are my convictions and you're not trying to be offensive and reply back with some condemnation or something religious but you you show that there's a boundary there so that hopefully what they do is they respect that they say that's a boundary but if you give an excuse they're like that's a barrier let's work around it let's figure out a way for you to do this since those are just barriers and those are excuses and not really a reason why you're taking the position in the stand that you have so that's those are just some of the things we're thinking about in terms of setting limits now we're not leaving the subject of setting limits but i am changing kind of my uh my subject or the subtitle to love has limits and this is intentionally thought-provoking because i know immediately we all start thinking about the songs that how measureless and strong and and how you know there's even one song i've been wanting to sing uh it's your love is boundless and and in the very opening line of the first verse is your love has no limits your love knows no bounds and so it's kind of like well i'm kind of creating friction there tension and that's what's going to keep us engaged in this service when there's tension so maybe some of you to some of you it may be just click bait oh you know this is just kind of a catchy title love has limits but i hope that you understand this as we look into this further i was even thinking this morning how we say we can't put god in a box right but if god wants to get in the box nobody's gonna stop him right and so it's not a matter of us trying to limit something but it's to understand what something is and so let's turn in our bibles i think some of you may already be there you can open your app you can flip through your panels of apps whatever is you use or you could just look at the screen behind me and look at first corinthians chapter 13 as we read through our text again and touch on some points to initiate this subject this is just the beginning of looking at some of these things and love has limits it says though i speak with tongues of men and angels and of angels and have not charity i become i am become as a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol so there's one principle that i can speak with tongues of men and of angels but if i don't have charity then it's a sounding arrest it's a tinkling symbol it's something without distinction and though i have a gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though i have all faith so that i could remove mountains and have not charity i am nothing now i believe that you could take the position and it's not not that we would say you could make the argument and it's reasonable but paul is not explicitly suggesting that you could have the gift of prophecy understand all mysteries all knowledge have all faith to be able to remove mountains and not have charity but he's saying if i could right there but there is some he is touching on some principle that there's way things that you could know things that you could understand things that you could have the gift of prophecy and so it's maybe he's pushing it and being extreme well even if you had all faith and you could remove mountains and you could you could you had all knowledge of all the mysteries and you could uh you could prophesy but you don't have charity then what does it matter what does it mean at the end of the day what have you accomplished he says though i bestow and this kind of changes even you can see how these things each have their place speaking in tongues now this wisdom knowledge prophecy faith and now it's saying these actions these very acts of somebody they're unselfish acts and though i bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though i give my body to be burned so whether it be as a martyr for the cause of faith or sacrificial to preserve someone's life or bestow all my goods to give them away for charity as we might say and he says and have not charity it profiteth me nothing. so you notice in these in these first two verses that you have these gifts uh uh or the of power or greatness acts of power acts of greatness where someone could speak in tongues that's a demonstrable gift that would signify look at this person they have a gift and even to have a gift of prophecy and understand mysteries and knowledge and have all faith be able to move mountains now that's great power could you imagine what you might begin to think about somebody if they took west wing mountain and joined it with calderwood butte and created a bigger hiking trail you'd say wow this person's on another level and paul's saying but if you don't have charity he's saying i am nothing and then in verse three he's identifying certain acts of humility very very uh acts of service to give your body to be burned and whether to be a martyr for the cause or for faith or to preserve someone else's life or a self-sacrifice and give my oh sell all my bestow all my goods to feed the poor this is acts of service and he's saying but it prof it profiteth me nothing without charity so he's talked about gifts of tongues and prophecy uh knowledge and wisdom and of the mysteries all faith power to remove mountains even humility and sacrifice to give away your goods and to have your body to be burned this is the preface that paul is leading into this subject of charity at which he refers to as the best gift the thing to be desired now verse four charity suffereth long and this kind uh some of the other words that are used for kind is easy good gracious i think those are some of the words it's actually translated to in in the uh new testament easy good goodness and gracious but it suffereth long it means it's of a long spirit does not lose heart so it's some sort of fortitude and perseverance that perseveres patiently to charity suffereth long uh we find it charity is patient how some translations render it uh and it bravely perseveres this is a characteristic of charity it it suffers long it's patient it perseveres it's persistent it means to be patient in bearing the offenses and injuries of others that's what it means to be to suffer along your patient and bearing offenses you're you're patient in bearing in and putting up with the injuries from other people it means to be smile to be mild or slow to punish so it to suffer long you just uh you're you're slow you're slow to punish and then again kind is in the same sense shown to be mild it means to use kindness it means to be manageable to be pleasant as opposed to sharp or bitter and those are personality traits right we could think of people really sharp seem to be uh very pungent with their bitterness and so this is kind of the characteristic these are the characteristics of charity it's patient it's kind it's mild it it's manageable it's pleasant as opposed to bitter so charity suffereth long and is kind charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself is not puffed up does not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things charity never faileth but where there be prophecies they shall fail whether whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away now i want you to continue to look i don't know if i have them all there well they're not all fitting maybe on the one slide but think of this in the all these from verse four to verse eight and think of it this way what love is what it does what it isn't and what it doesn't you can see it's it's broke out in that that what it is and what it does what it isn't and what it doesn't do what it is is it suffers long it's patient it is it suffereth long so love is patient love is kind that's what it is what it does is it rejoices in truth it bears all things believes all things trust in all things trust all things endures all things that's the hope is a trust to confidence and this is this is what it is it's patient and kind what it does is it rejoices in truth and it bears believes trust and endures all things then it tells us what love isn't it is not puffed up it's an inflated view of self it's not arrogant and it's not easily provoked irritated or angered and then that's what love isn't and it's here's what love doesn't it does not envy it does not vaunt itself push itself forward does not behave indecently does not seek her own does not think evil does not rejoice in iniquity and it says does not fail and when it says that charity does not fail it loops charity then what it says kind of i'm saying it ends on that in what it is what it isn't what it does and what it doesn't it says charity never faileth it loops right back to charity suffers long because it means it endures it perseveres and so it kind of loops back so you have charity suffers long charity never failed paul creates this loop now where you begin charity suffers long and then it's a charity never fails it's looped right back into what charity is it's an eternal circuit charity is something that's unending in that way charity is something that it's it's always going to be because it suffers long it cannot be vanquished it cannot be destroyed the bible says many waters cannot quench love that says our god is a consuming fire and god is love so these certain attributes and characteristics when it comes to love that it's something that it perseveres it endures it'll it'll ever remain we sing the song the love of god it shall forevermore endure the saints in angel song throughout all eternity we're going to be experiencing this agape the love of god and so it says cherry never faileth it loops it right back into charity suffers long it's it's it's an unbroken continuity of what love is and it is a standard as we look at it what it is what it does what it isn't what it doesn't it's a standard by which we can judge our attitudes standard by which we can judge our action and say is this an act of love is this am i doing this out of love or is there some other emotion that is motivating this is there some other motive and objective that is at work something more sinister something less sincere maybe something that's hypocritical or there's some pretense engaged in it something we could just uh we can apply to ourselves that love the love of god if i have the love of god in my heart this is a template of what it is and what it does what it isn't and what it doesn't and so if something is trending in these other areas where it does not behave indecently and it seeks does not seek its own it's not easily provoked and think it's no evil see what what's rising up and what's being quick and motivated is not i'm not being provoked unto love and to good works but i'm now operating in another area which it just said a minimum is carnal and then when he says that whether there be prophecies tongues knowledge it'll fail cease or vanish away it loops back to verses one through three so he's kind of created this circle uh with uh from verse four to verse eight and beginning of verse eight which this is charity here but then he comes he loops right back to verses one through three about tongues and prophecy and giving of the body to be burned he comes right back to those things and he's saying don't measure yourself by these don't just say because you could speak with tongues kind of like well that's that has to be the evidence right then this i've got the holy ghost which is the love of god or i i um i have faith to move a mountain and i'm going to put it on my work so i'm going to put on my understanding of the mysteries and all these knowledge he's saying that that's not the appropriate measure because i was wanting to bring it back together that's not something that you're going to measure yourself by because those are things that you can too easily get puffed up in those are things that you're too easily can start to say hey did you hear those tongues i was talking in earlier today that was i hope they had that on tape right and you think really big of yourself you hear what i did with west wing mountain there's a certain uh way that those things provoke the flesh and there's a different nature to cherry there's a different nature to love and paul uses the phrase it profiteth me nothing since he's looping back where there's knowledge the prophecies tongues they're all going to fail cease and vanish he's looping back to verses one to three and what did he say about him profiteth me nothing it prevails nothing it's better it does some of the words are you translated also too is it's there's no advantage in it it's not better than anything else it profiteth me nothing it means to assist to be useful or advantageous you don't have the advantage on somebody else because you speak in tongues you don't have the advantage on somebody else if you give all your goods away and sell all your goods and give them to the fore these things do not make you better than anyone else to where you can look down on somebody else the knowledge and understanding we have in the word of god today with the benefit we have of a book that has been opened uh with the benefit we have of such a clear a clarity brought to us to the revelation of jesus christ that doesn't lift any of us up to where we look down upon anyone else and so this is uh he's saying it doesn't it doesn't distinguish you it says it profiteth me nothing it doesn't prove anything but he is he is saying and you have to be very disciplined he is saying that there's something about love that has a vindication to it now the love that we might say well love is the evidence of the holy ghost now we know that's not exactly accurate right because then there's a certain kindness and love and emotion that we could characterize with love and say oh well he's so loving he's so sweet he's so kind he must have the holy ghost well they could just be really good people and so there's it's it's not we're not saying that the holy that the charity and a certain emotion and i have to be very disciplined because i know i'm going to be stopping short in the middle of this subject today and they may be leaving some thoughts of well what is what what would be then the context of this but paul was saying this it's not an advantage to anyone else it's not a proof of anything but jesus does say in john 13 34-35 a new commandment i give unto you that must have really wrangled uh the uh the strict constructionist right of the ten commandments and it's not to be inter it's to be interpreted literally and we're strict constructionists and this is the ten commandments this is the original bill of rights uh there's no such thing as amendments to this there's no uh interpretation of it and he says i'm gonna give you a new commandment and uh some of the orthodox jews were pulling their curls out he says that you love one another as i have loved you that you also so it says that you love one another as i have loved you that you also love one another so he kind of says love one another like hey all right we can do this we can love i can love you bro and then he says as i have loved you that you also love one another well i would say they hadn't quite fully understood the depths of his love but that changes everything right i mean i feel like i can love my family i can love i i can have a love for my neighbor i can love you i can i can love my my brothers and i can love my sisters and this is something i can do but then it says but as i have loved you that's the love that i want you to love one another with and he says buy this the same love of christ should have brought in our hearts by this shall all men know that you're my disciples if you have love one to another this kind of love leaves a particular mark not necessarily one that would cause you to believe that this person is right or that this person is uh is correct or has the truth but it's one he says by this men shall know that you are my disciples that you believe what i taught that you are that you are christians he says if you have love one to another was it gandhi that said i have that i have no problem with christ my problem is with christians and why because he saw that there was some lack of continuity in the character nature of christ and what christianity had become and so it's not that people would look at you like isn't he a christ figure and isn't he just divine and isn't he wonderful but they'll know that you believe what christ taught by the way that you treat each other the way you treat other people that believe the same thing so he says if you have loved one to another so this kind of love leaves a mark and and and i'm it's a distinction because he says by this shall all men know that you all are my disciples you're subject to my word he says if you love one if you have loved one to another now brother branham identifies this in many different places and kind of uh putting the cr the emphasis on it which is correct that there is a way that we love one another that cigna is signaling is signifying and evidencing that we believe in christ that we are brothers and sisters following the same truth and in this people can profess allegiance to christ and i'm willing to fight for christ even willing to die for christ but not willing to love by his live by his word not willing to have his spirit the spirit the christ have not willing to have the love for others that he had for for us and and he's identifying this he's saying that there's people who will profess christ fight for christ i'm willing to lay down my life for christ but yet not live in the love of christ i hope i've got you thinking love has limits brother branham in the chapter 8 of the church age book he's talking about the philadelphian church age this age of brotherly kindness if we're talking about philadelphia in the united states that's the city of brotherly shove but in the in this is the city of brotherly love he says now we have already mentioned he's using strength the scripture there he says now we have already mentioned how the strength was returning it was the power of the inquisition had waned people left their homelands and demanded a freedom of worship the yoke of the hierarchy was being broken freedom liberty we're free right the governments were finding it wise not to champion one segment against another so there is a loosening of restriction there's a little bit more religious freedom and you have rights and you can do this and you can do that and and governments are not interfering so it's really a unique uh kind of overview of the changing political landscape but then he he makes this statement this is the part i really want you to focus on in fact well-meaning so they're well-intentioned they mean well but poorly led catch this you you you mean well but you're led wrong we're willing to wage war to defend their religious rights so jihad certain kinds of jihad aren't right and uh think about that just what are some of the platitudes anymore that motivate people religious rights and are willing to wage war right topple governments storm capitals you know you you name it in the name of what religious freedom but you can mean well but be poorly led well-meaning but poorly led people are willing to wage war to defend the religious rights perhaps the greatest show of strength of religion is not the overthrow of governments not the toppling of political powers not the changing of legislation he says but in this age was the fact that though france fell in revolution the great westland revival because that's where the move of god was right wesley would be the the messenger so it's though there was a revolution that toppled the government of france but where wesley's revival was initiated and beginning the great western revival kept the revolution away from great britain and saved her to be an instrument in the hand of god for many glorious years now this is a mouthful of things that relate historically and even to the imperialism of great britain but he's identified an attitude where people can mean well they have certain uh motivations and have certain desires something they're trying to achieve but he's saying in doing so they're led poorly people are willing to fight for christ defend christ stand for his honor stand for truth and the bible says this as this is true and they think by any means necessary i i should be able to defend the truth as long as i'm defending christ and i'm willing to die for christ but somehow in all of it the nature and spirit of christ gets left out well-meaning but poorly led why because they are willing to wage war to defend their religious rights when their religious rights don't tell them to wage war to defend them i know i'm just causing some thought here but i'm so glad i'm reading a statement from the church age book as i do it well meaning but poorly led i touch on it because there is a sense of passion and affinity and a an allegiance that i love god and it's my love for god which is and and again i'm probably going to do some a little bit of a my own kind of ping-pong go to this side and then back to the other side trying to keep it balanced if i could just get the the ball to kind of hover above the net that's where i want to be but there's a real zeal and a passion people can have for the word or for christ and be poorly led because it's not him leading and so the love for god can be very easily mischaracterized but then there's also a the love of god that's in my heart so you say well they have a love for god so they're zealous they're passionate and and they're going to do something and act contrary to the nature of god contrary to the love of god but then on the other side we're over here now are we over here on the other side there's an attitude well if you had the love of god in your heart you wouldn't do this and you wouldn't do that now that could be said in correct ways as paul says what love is and what it isn't what it does and what it doesn't but then on one hand there's a certain image that we can have of the love of god if you had it in your heart you'd do this if you had in your heart you wouldn't do that that isn't what we would expect could we agree to that and paul is purposely contrasting uh the things he says in verses one two and three and verse eight uh kind of that loop that loops back and prophecies and tongues and knowledge uh ceasing failing and vanishing coming right back into those characteristics in the first three verses he's contrasting it with verses four to seven what what love is what it isn't what it does and what it doesn't and when he puts it forth there's a way that we could just define all the words and begin to understand that there's something there there's there's things here being expressed that give us a measure of love and that tell us what love is but he's really identifying the mystery of the measure of love because we can read the words it suffers long and is kind it does this it does that it doesn't do this it doesn't do that it's it is it isn't and we can begin to see these things but yet there's a mystery to it and what is it going to look like when it's in flesh now to kind of show some continuity with how we've been expressing some things in uh luke chapter six matthew chapter four and setting limits and we kind of took those things and read them and say now does this mean that no holds are barred does this mean anything goes does this mean that we can we ought to be abused and mistreated and put up with anything that no matter what our circumstances are and yeah i know that job is doing this and i know this thing is doing that and i know you're having to go through this and go through that but you're a christian so you just need to put up with it right just get happy with the way the devil does things right and not say wait a minute no i don't have to subject myself to these things and identifying that by wisdom and discernment with the right thing to do is in those situations in the same way look at some of these characteristics of what love is does isn't and doesn't and i just want to focus on this that it what it it what it does is it bears which means it it even keeps secret when it bears something it keeps it it suffers all things it endures it calmly takes ill treatments and is not easily angered these are these are characteristics right so if if those were the standard right then just anybody could kind of wave it in our face you don't have the love of god and we could say and you don't either but that's kind of the game we could play we're not and it says it thinks no evil so here's a characteristic of the measure of love it it keeps secret and suffers when it's been injured and harmed and it endures it calmly takes poor treatment and and it's not easily anger that when someone buffets you or treats you wrong you don't get irritated and riled up and fired back and it doesn't think evil now that one's really uh interesting to where he says thinks no evil and so you can't think anything is evil or you can't have a bad thought well it's the same that's what charity doesn't do is it doesn't think evil and could we all agree that love is misunderstood this agape love the love of god it's misunderstood because the love which god is is not a warm feeling it's not sentiments it's not emotional affinity it's not attraction in in the sense of what we say oh i love that person i love this and i love that we're speaking we're using a language that is referring to human emotions but when god speaks of charity and it's agape and god is love and you're thinking of the life of god and the love of god and when the bible's saying that love is of god and god is loved and that's putting it outside of the realm of human emotion of love which some of us i would say all of us at some point have thought that we've experienced um and it's talking about a different kind of love um there are these and i'm not doing anything i trust i'm not saying or doing anything that would water down what we've said about what love is and what it does and what it isn't and what it doesn't because these are immutable attributes they're part of love you can't take them away they are part of love but they can be misrepresented to paint the wrong picture what love is what it does what it isn't what it doesn't do is defining the limits of love the parameters of love it's the frame of love that when you could find out what it isn't then you could put that outside the picture when you can find out what it does it's in the picture when you find out what it doesn't then it's not in the picture right so it's a way of framing love to begin to understand what it is and so love we can say his love knows no limits his love knows no bound it's measureless and strong but love is not limitless in the sense that anything goes love is not limited uh limitless in the sense that uh it's not patient and and endures and not easily angered and thinks no evil in the sense that you'd say well love is just kind of indiscriminate and accepts anything and we can't make it to be excessive that love is just it's excessive um extravagant and it's it's a reckless i think that even how some ways it's spoken of reckless well i know that there's a is it reckless love is that the name of the song am i getting it right and uh i'm trying to remember the way it was changed i heard someone sing where they changed the words instead of reckless love what was it eliza what precious wow what what a contrast reckless and precious now that my pitbull's name precious and my chihuahua's name reckless i just uh-huh okay what a difference and uh and so but you think about it that kind of the way the love is being expressed tonight it is reckless right because it's like i wouldn't do that it seems to be reckless but when you when and so it's speaking i'm not defending the song whoever wrote it you know michael crowder i'm not giving you a shout out i don't think it's him i just his hair always scared me so couldn't listen to anything by the michael crowder band so don't google who you the songs you like right because you'll see the artist like really really no please no that guy wrote amazing grace but um where am i so there it's from our perspective that we see right we say well that's reckless but from god's standpoint there's no risk right so from our vantage point it's reckless but so it's not authorizing us i'm just going to live recklessly i'm just going to love recklessly brother john i'm just going to well no no no god god wasn't being reckless he knew the outcome but from our vantage point it may seem stubborn and reckless and unrelenting but god is not excessive and extravagant in the way that we would he's not indiscriminate paul even says let your love be without dissimulation that's a love abounding and growing into more comprehensive wisdom and knowledge and discernment and he says abhor that which is evil cleave to that which is good so that's the real marker of love is it doesn't just love everything and love everybody it knows what's evil and it knows what's good there's a phrase all is fair in love and war have any of us used that recently to justify the things that we have said when we were arguing anybody it says all is fair and love and war is a statement that's often used in the context of relationships and to describe certain circumstances and situations but let me just say that's not true of god's word and his love and the phrase all is fair in love and war suggests that in certain situations any method of achieving an objective is justified right is that kind of your understanding all's fair in love and war means that certain certain situations in love and in war explicitly is referencing those that to accomplish a certain objective any means is justified to do it in war if you're in a battle you're in war then whatever it takes to win the war every means to do so is justified and it it's literally referring to the elimination of boundaries that would exist in normal situations like well in this situation that's not appropriate in that situation you would never do that but in love and war saying that in certain contexts all the boundaries all the rules all the order is removed and it's more chaotic and you can do whatever you want as long as it's related to this you could do whatever you want as long as you're trying to accomplish this and it's used to kind of justify the removal of rules and structure and order and the removal of boundaries because when it's love and when it's war by any means necessary is justified and that's just simply not true it may work to justify actions and activities it may even describe how that people when there's a natural love lose control of their of their emotions and lose control of their actions and lose control of their minds because and they're driven to conduct themselves and do things that they wouldn't normally do and say that's because it's driven it's motivated by this wrong kind of love so love has limits kind of using that a very explicit phrasing we're talking about uh repudiation of all sphere and love and war or how there's these on one hand these immutable characteristics of love cannot be used just to paint the wrong picture when i say love has limits it has boundaries it has a proper expression there is a way and i know i want to be very uh intentional and not expressing this too much because i would deserve more time there's a way that love acts there's a way that the love of god acts and therefore if it's the love of god that is acting there's a certain thing that it provokes right so i could take the truth and i can minister it with bitterness in my heart and guess what's being sewn with it bitterness and so i i could do things i could act i could do the right thing and what is it we're trying to we try to teach our children to it's not just getting the job done but it's doing it right and with the right attitude and so there's a certain way it says faith which worketh by love so that we could be working all we want with our faith but it's something that works it works by love it's effective it's beneficial it's uh it accomplishes successfully when it's motivated by the right thing so there's things that you could do that in you we could be well meaning and the objective may be right but when it's motivated by love and that's kind of the force that's working behind it then there's a certain way that it acts but then once the act has taken place there's a certain thing that it provokes and so you could say this that the devil will stand there to misrepresent the acts of love to reinterpret them to you so that it provokes the wrong emotions inside of you or we all we have to have the discernment to recognize that though true it's done in the wrong spirit and that's why you feel you feel yourself not agreeing with uh maybe i'm giving some people just loading them up with a tremendous excuse no you just didn't do it in love brother aaron like okay sorry i came on too strong but there's a way that you recognize i it's i'm not being provoked by this action i'm not being provoked in the way that i ought to be by this the word of god preached with the love of god ought to provoke you to love the word of god more certainly if you're elect to it and this is a very obvious reference here from the chapter for the church age book brother branham says how can god be justified excuse me well it's this is the question it was related to even the holocaust and god allowing his children to suffer and millions to be slaughtered in and we see god letting people go through difficult things and suffer tragic uh tragedies and sufferings and travesties so this is the question when you see somebody suffer the children of god those the chosen people how can god be just and loving so right and full of love if he stands by and watches his people suffer and he he quotes malachi chapter one verses one to three so he comes back to he says you see they could not figure out god's love so they have a they had a vision of love and it had a figure right i had a certain representation to them he says they could not figure out god's love because they have a figure of it and it's not matching they have a representation of it an image of it and saying wow this is incongruent with what my image is they thought love meant no suffering they thought that love meant a baby with parental care but god said that his love was elective love now that's that's powerful that it's not just this love that is just driven by emotions to where oh oh i don't want you to suffer and in the same sense a parental love that was going to be with the baby that it's you're you are tasked as a parent for a certain time in a child's a baby's life to be the protector absolutely and so you're protecting them from things that are harmful you even have you need to have a particular knowledge to know that at a certain time their body can't even process certain foods it's not that you need to get them used to it it's like the body's not even going to be able to do it so you wait and and you kind of hold back a little bit until they're old enough and you are responsible for being sure that they're not suffering needlessly and you're making sure that they're not you're responding to pains and cries this is part of a parental love this is what a parent ought to do and they think well if god is the ultimate parent then he ought to always be that way he said that it means that no suffering and sometimes this is a real downside to parenting parents don't want their kids to ever suffer and it's necessary come on children it's necessary that my children suffer right and not necessarily by my hand but it's necessary that they they they fail and they endure conflicting emotions and that they uh and that they they go through difficulties and they learn they learn to become more resilient they learn that things don't always work out and they can't always get what they want and and it's very important to have that balance to let your children suffer so there's a misrepresentation that even scales all the way down to parenting so oh well this is what a real parent would do this is what we have to do we have to protect and we ought to do this and we have to yield and we have to give that's not how parenting works but there is a failure love which is the kind of the love that's being described here they had they couldn't figure out god's love because they had their figure of filial love and in their ideophilia love why would you let someone suffer needlessly and ideophilia love i would love a baby and and i would care for it but he's saying no that's not how god's love works god's love is elective love keep that phrase in mind elective love filial love is the human love it's a different word that's used in the new testament the greek word filio it's of mere personal affection or passion if you have a filial love you can you can have a feeling of love for a burrito all right you can have that it's just a personal affection and there's no intelligence and uh that's what we're wanting to be on the ballot uh in the midterms is to be able to marry a burrito but it's uh it's just personal passion and what's interesting about the word you study the word there's no intelligence associated with it no no no higher intelligence no high purpose it doesn't have to you there doesn't have to be some sort of great uh objective and there doesn't have to be some meaning behind it you say well why do you love that i just do you so there's some people that engage in certain activities and they don't necessarily derive any benefit from it it's just something they enjoy doing so there doesn't have to be any purpose or no high higher purpose involved when it's just filial love but agape love they call the love of intelligence or an intelligent love it's a love which is has comprehension this agape love it's it's joined with the corresponding purpose it's a love of intelligence in reason not that you love intelligence but it's something that has reason and comprehension when you love something it's not because that you're unfamiliar with it you love it through knowledge you love it through understanding as we say about him to know the lord to know christ to truly know him is to love him and the more that we know of his love for us we love him in return because that's what agape love does it's joined with a purpose that this kind of love is is coupled with a kind of a corresponding higher intelligence higher purpose a higher meaning and so this agape love is vastly higher and greater than a human love because it's governed by a higher conscience when we say we love oh i love that and i enjoy this and i really like that and we use those terminologies that that's not necessarily governed by a higher purpose but the love of god is subject to and governed by a higher intelligence and higher reasoning but the man said love is elective that means love well let me say it this way love is deliberate it's very intentional and therefore the love of god can only act to to only act in a way that furthers the divine purpose the love of god can only act in a way to fulfill divine purpose so when when god is acting which god is love when he's doing something he's furthering his objective his own divine objective so it's not just for the sake of love alone but love works to fulfill the word of god brother branham says in one place i don't have these for you but just quick sniffers he says now you take the filial love when we have that love a mother for her baby will drive her right straight to a flaming fire to save that baby's life it's appropriate correct it'll make a man for his sweetheart lay down his life any time that's what filial level do now for someone for a man to sacrifice himself for his family's sake he's saying that's filial level do that um the love that would drive a woman into uh into a burning house to save a child filio love will do that and those are very positive emotions and feelings but it also it also causes a man to do what kill another man love will also motivate someone to take another man's life for the sake of love for the sake of passion so feel your love is a force it's a motivator something that causes somebody to do something but then brother brad i mean i i'm very glad that i'd had this here maybe had lost sight of it for a moment but brother branham when he's talking about compassion of christ and the love of jesus christ and he gives the example how he went to the pool of bethesda and walked right by all these people that were sick went right up to one man who wasn't as sick as everybody else and healed him and he's talking about how people don't understand compassion and he said compassion is to do the will of god and he says in one place but loves referring to agape love is to do the will of him that sends you so immediately we can't we we cannot use love the love of god my love for god and the love of god should have brought in my heart for everyone let's just all hold hands and sing kumbaya or michael row your boat ashore whatever you can do in g and let's do this that's not necessarily what the love of god looks like right the love of god is to do the will of him that sends you that's what love is love is a force love is a motivator in a in a filial context but it also is in the agape context but only to accomplish god's will only to serve god's purpose love has limits then in second corinthians chapter 5 verses 13 to 15. i i i guess i would like maybe just just to stop here because it joins to something else but maybe what we'll do is uh next sunday go we'll start again at this point here and i'll just go further so those of you who thought the super bowl was at noon and i was wrapping this up it's much later i believe so if you got excited for a moment now your hopes are dashed don't worry you should make kickoff as a matter of fact you could probably drive and make it there time by time and close because it's in la la so i think you you're all good got the car all fueled up and ready and you got your big foam finger go cardinals it says in ii corinthians chapter 5 verses 13 to 15. for whether we be beside ourselves it is to god or whether we be sober it is for your cause certainly in the context of paul you're mad well it's for god it's to god crazy for christ and whether we be sober it is for your cause for the love of christ constraineth us notice now constraining how limit it means to hold together lest it fall to pieces the the the the love of christ is holding me it presses in on every side it means to hold completely and the way paul's using this notice how you're saying the love of christ is holding me back the love of jesus christ the love of christ in my heart the love for christ the love for you constrainteth us because we thus judge that if we one died for all then we're all dead and that he died for all that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto him which died for them and rose again paul was saying that this love hol this love holds him back because he had to act in a manner that was consistent with the word he says the love of christ constrainted us and he says because one we can we judge that if one died for all then we're all dead and he died for all that they which should that live now don't just live to themselves but live unto him the one that died and rose again paul was saying that love actually held him back and kept him from acting maybe you could say in this sense that they thought well paul if he really loved us you would have done this and paul if you really loved us you would have done that paul's saying i do and this love constrains me this love keeps me from acting maybe in the way that you think i ought to act says that they which live should not live henceforth unto themselves in philippians chapter 2 verse 21 he says for all seek their own not the things which are jesus christ this is the problem he's identifying that people motivated by their own passions their own desires their needs their own wants that they're driven to do certain things but they're just seeking their own that even though it might have certain platitudes and the pretense of sincerity and sacrifice when you get when you get down to it you have to recognize there was something in it for them and do we not should we not all be aware of that when it comes to uh the our interactions in the world especially in business that nobody's in the business of altruism not even goodwill that's a for-profit thing i mean they they're taking your junk and i'm glad to give it to them but they're not turning around and giving it to people who need it they're turning around and selling it right actually their goodwill no it's it that's just to get you in the door to give your stuff up oh it's for charity i get a ditch no no there's a it's it's motivated by profit now if i've got some of the particulars not worked out quite right just straighten me up on it but my point is this our interactions day to day and someone's asking for something or they want to give you something if anybody wants to give you something it's fine to be like all right i think i know what's in it for me but what's in it for you or where are you gonna get me i appreciate everybody's prayers i got a car this week within 24 hours of telling the church everybody prayed i got a car look i don't care how much this guy tells me i ripped him off and i and i beat him down and got the best price and and i won i know he took me too hey i just bought a used car you don't leave a used car dealerships and yeah i really showed him if you think that they're laughing about you in the break room why because they're not in the business of making sure everyone has a car i mean mr mcgeary i'm not in this for the money i'm in this to see that good people like you can afford a good car and i know times are tough he didn't do that but we don't need the people are in it for themselves he says all seek their own not the things which are jesus christ and that's the beauty that's the beauty of of having the love of god in your heart it says it doesn't seek its own it's seeking a higher purpose is seeking a higher objective and not not misguided to think oh if you love somebody you'll do this for them well think again if you do that and maybe it makes them happy and helps them out but would it further the will of god in their life or become a barrier to god dealing with them would it become a barrier to them recognizing a need would it become a barrier to them fulfilling the the objective of christ in life you love operates by different parameters than the love that we have in our heart called filio i love it how he just says love of christ constrainteth us it just it created this image of being held back that love actually holds back because love itself is bound love is wrapped up and bound in the character of jesus christ love itself was embodied in the person jesus christ and brother branham is talking about the love of god and the the love of god being shed abroad in the apostles hearts i believe it was he says that love in their hearts was god's love for his own so the love that was in the hearts of the disciples was the love that god had for his own it's the same love therefore love has to act consistent with the nature of god god has boundaries see what i did there love actually consistent with the nature of god and it is in god's nature to to hold himself to his word god who feels all time and space limitless unending eternal omnipotent all-powerful formed himself into an image so he can begin to create confined himself to creation holds himself within a universe which he expands beyond it but god puts himself in a box so that we could know him so i don't ever want to put god in a box but if god put himself in his word so that i could know him then i don't want to break him outside of this to find him oh well you could just find him in nature you can find him in any religion and you could just find him in sincerity and just find him in good people okay all right i i feel ya i know what you're trying to say but god said this is where you'll know me i may be everywhere but if you want to know me this is where you're going to know me so he's a god of boundaries the god of order he's a god who's very controlled elective love is selective love it is discriminate it's very precise it's calculating but yet it's sincere just to kind of touch on it just briefly it says love does not behave itself unseemly in other words it does not behave indecently love is not rude love is never intentionally offensive to anyone but love is respectful to say that love does not behave indecently that means it will give to anyone their due it gives to anyone what their due suitable to the time the person the circumstance and that they're in if this is what someone is do if this is what someone deserves if this is what someone ought to have it will not withhold it does not it never behaves itself indecently love has limits you can't say well it's love but it's indecent you can't say it's love but it does not render what's due and what's right you cannot say it's love but it's intentionally offensive love in itself once you truly know it is an offense just in its true nature it doesn't need to intentionally be disrespectful i'm going to invite the musicians to come or just make ready to come and i want to close with the statement from trying to do god a service without it being god's will to maybe have good intentions and be well-meaning but be poorly led to feel that you have something motivating you something driving you but then once you look at it you're trying to accomplish it and even saying well look at what i'm trying to accomplish look what i'm trying to accomplish but it's not his will and if you want to read or listen to some of these services that he touches on this this is one in november 27th 1965 i think it's at a shreveport brother men's breakfast he says no matter how much your anointing is he's talking about you brothers you sisters who think you're called to preach he says no matter how much your anointing is you've got to get in god's provided position it's not just anointing but it's position and he's using the example of david bringing back the ark and putting it on an ox card and if we all found out the ark of the covenant was being restored back to israel there'd be a shout there'd be rejoicing you say well it's coming back it belongs it's ours right it belongs to us well then just get it back it doesn't matter how you get it it just matters that it's there even you could take this as well you just need to get in position well by any means necessary to get in position i just want to do it so i feel like i should be first chair piano player so i'm going to get micah sick and i'm going to tell some lies about them because i believe that's what god called me to do and by any means necessary because i want to be first chair that's my position it doesn't work that way so david he says david's anointing's right his his objective what he's wanting to do is right but he says but in doing it he got enthused and stepped over the boundary line well wait a minute i mean the boundary line does not the ark belong to israel does not the ark of the covenant belong it with israel and isn't it not declaring god's presence so should it just be a matter of getting it back in its place but through enthusiasm the wrong kind of emotion the wrong kind of inspiration he stepped over the boundary line what did he do he stepped over the boundary line when i was studying this even last year on the subject of barriers and boundaries and reading every place brother brown said boundary every place brother bram said barrier and boundaries and these things this is this this subject matter came up quite frequently where broadband talks about stepping over something instead of putting the ark in its original position he carried it on a new cart and not over the hearts of the levites it was supposed to be carried on the shoulder of the levites which is over the heart the word is not in the mind it's in the heart the word's not in your head it's in your heart not a new on a new cart what was that the cart he's saying is represented something new david did there spoke of every denomination there'd ever be thanks david he speaks of it right there in that act the ark of the covenant the word of god the presence of god this is it this is what it's all about this is what it's for but he says in that simple act he spoke of and signaled every he told us what every denomination would do from that moment on this is a characteristic in the mark of what denominations do it may be the word it may be the presence it may be the things that relate to god and it may your objective may be right and what you're trying to accomplish may be right but he's saying it's not according to the will of god remember if you're going to try to find out whether or not you're doing you're right whether or not something's right he says you check your mode and objective but check the word first too it's like i want to kill my neighbor because he smokes and it's just coming right over the fence and i think my kids are wanting to start they're going to want to start smoking and and you know he's done this and he's a bad person and so you start you're like yeah this is a really good argument but can we back up like what you're wanting to do regardless of what your reasons are it's contrary to the word and if that's not good enough it's illegal buddy you can't do that he stepped over a boundary line now he's saying the word is in the heart not in the mind denominations are represented here god's word is not to be carried by state presbyters or bishops and so forth of denominations and i know there's a i'll say this i feel that i don't need to defend preaching overtly i just do it right so you could be safe knowing that i'm not a hypocrite up here just preaching i believe in it but in the defense of it sometimes what happens and just go so far but notice where brother branham brings this balance in it the holy ghost the word is not to be carried by state presbyters or bishops uh uh so forth of denominations it's the baptismal holy ghost in the heart of man not in some ecclesiastical movement we say oh yes the heart of man the levites yes there's a great beautiful type there's a beautiful image that the word being carried by the levites the ministry but he says the holy spirit is a treasure of god's love in the heart of man and women to obey this word is a treasure the holy spirit is a treasure of god's love in your heart man or woman boy or girl the holy spirit once you've received this blessed gift it's a treasure of god's love in the heart of man and a woman to obey now this is where i'm gonna stop but and i'm gonna stop short of where i wanted to uh originally envisioned of being but just to see how now love is gonna act what it is and what it does and then the holy spirit the word of god is to be carried into your heart it's a treasure of god's love in the heart of man satan chose your mind god chose your heart the love of god is first concerned with your heart the love of god is first concerned about the condition of your spirit the love of god is not oh it's in my heart now anything goes just open yourself up to it and get beat up and keep be battered the love of god is first to your heart the love god is first to your spirit and the love of god is now doing battle for your mind it's concerned about those things and so the bible says in proverbs 4 because remember the word is not in the mind it's in the heart something about your person about who you are in proverbs 4 23. i'm going to read this i'm just going to leave it with you keep thy heart with all diligence proud of it are the issues of life you must keep your heart you must guard your heart you must protect your heart why because out of it are the issues of life and it's from there that the words need to be expressed you have the you have by the baptist you have the word of god in your soul but where does it emit to and how is it expressed listen we don't go well you want to see jesus peer into my soul right you're not gonna be able to see it he's gonna know it by my spirit he's gonna know about how this body acts so there's a there's the love of god in our soul now it's emitting it's manifesting expressing itself out and love then says keep thy heart the heart that place it's even it's the thing from which we love humanly it instinctively it is instinctively protective of god's purpose and god's will remember how brother man said oh how do i god is not the author of frustration but of peace and his will is that after we have suffered he's perfected us establish us strengthen us because god's love is intensely intensely protective of his purpose [Music] and i have had some other scriptures to share [Music] and i i don't i don't want to be lengthy so in the nature and the characteristic of love love is protective of god's purpose [Music] i would love to emphasize how that love then does not manipulate we said i'll put my spirit in you and will cause you cause you to walk after my statutes it's that's not manipulation that that's that's an affinity that's the growth that's that's the instinct of love this is a this is something transfined where there's been an attraction there's been something that's taken place in your heart to where it's something that motivates you and drives you something that you want to do that what's the love of god to keep his commandments and his commandments are not grievous so it's now i better do this i'm going to go to hell or i'm being forced to this and be controlled to do this the love of god does not manipulate nor can the love of god be manipulated so therefore you cannot let your the love you have for god you cannot put that and make it subject to the whims of man subject to the whims of emotions subject to the whims of family subject to the whims of people who would manipulate you and abuse you the love of god will not be manipulated love is not pushy right love is not pushy it doesn't pressure doesn't coerce doesn't force but it's also not a pushover and i know i'm repeating myself you said brother you should say the same thing but you're just using different terminology so then is it the same thing if it's different words love is not pushy but it's also not a pushover it can be easily coerced because love has limits and it was a dangerous phrase that we use sometimes well if you loved me you wouldn't do that that in itself is manipulative because it first implies because you did that proves you don't love me and love is not cannot be manipulated because when you do that you think you're actually coaxing love out of the person right you didn't think you'd get real at that moment did you are you are you coaxing something out when you say that is it provoking love what is it defense defensive then the argument becomes about the fact that you don't think i love you [Music] and that's how that's how we have to be so honest with ourselves that love will not manipulate but then this love that we have for god's word cannot be manipulated either and to never let the devil take that and manipulate it to cause us to do things that a christian should not do love has limits could we stand this morning [Music] amen could you bow your heads together with me if you have a need a special need today i just invite you to lift your hand i know it's unspoken if you buy rays in your hand but that is an act of faith to signify lord this is my need this is my prayer a gracious heavenly father with lifted hands across from the front to the back and side to side all over there's hands that are being raised and it is an act of faith to say lord you know my thought that is represented by a raised palm you know the need that is signified by a lifted hand only you know lord is mortal man i could look at these people and see a hand lift and i say oh that brother must be praying about that job interview and oh that sister's praying about her son oh this person's praying about the they're they've been sick or they have a problem that hasn't been riveted in the flesh i could have all sorts of guesses because i know them personally but you lord know the deepest secrets of our heart and i'm so grateful that we can trust you that we have lived lives professing love and loving and receiving love and have experienced great harms and betrayals and hurts that often causes us to be reluctant to love and to question love but i'm so glad to know i can trust your love that though we as humans may preach the gospel of psychological place of safety and failed to even practice what we preach we know that with you we are safe that with you lord with you we can trust you father i pray that you knowing our thoughts and knowing our needs and knowing our hearts right now could just make yourself known in a very personal way to those that have been here today to hear these things that as i have lord intentionally used trusting that it's not offensive lord but trusting that this believing that this title love has limits is thought-provoking may there be a willingness to consider that your love has deliberately chosen to express itself in a very specific way and that if we are going to experience your love we cannot make certain arguments or claims about you that are not true because then lord we're only enthused we're only excited and immediately we step across a boundary line into judgment we step across a boundary line that causes death and dissimulation and a loss of courage lord lord we draw from the example that your prophet pointed out and trying to do god a service without it being your will that lord we want to stay within the center of your will and whatever it is we say and do whatever it is we want to accomplish whatever it is we want to achieve [Music] what i pray now that you would touch us in our minds and in our hearts strengthen us and encourage us and bless your people and grant an anointing a touch a quickening for those hands that were raised you could declare your love to them in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen
