[0:00] Isaiah chapter 7 I'm just going to read
[0:02] one verse it's a maybe a cliche for a
[0:06] Christmas season uh but it is probably
[0:09] the most outstanding prophecy of his
[0:11] coming it's a paradox and it says
[0:13] therefore the Lord himself shall give
[0:15] you a sign Behold a virgin shall
[0:18] conceive and bear a son and shall call
[0:20] his name Emmanuel that's quite a
[0:23] statement a virgin shall conceive and
[0:26] bring forth a son and his name Shall be
[0:28] Called Emmanuel
[0:30] amen you can be
[0:32] seated trust that the Lord will be your
[0:35] portion this evening as the word is
[0:36] ministered and that each one of you
[0:38] regardless of your age or where you're
[0:39] at uh in your experience with the Lord
[0:42] there just can be something that you
[0:43] could jump out and grab a hold of uh
[0:46] this is part two on the gift of Christ's
[0:49] presence and we did mention on Sunday
[0:51] how we're just taking advantage of the
[0:53] Christmas time maybe in a little bit of
[0:55] a play on word and not gifts or presents
[0:57] but the gift of Christ's presence
[1:00] and using this statement from the Queen
[1:02] of Sheba God gives gifts in all
[1:04] generations a gift of his presence
[1:07] that's something that uh we ought to
[1:10] Value something that we ought to Aspire
[1:12] to experience and to promote and to lift
[1:14] up the gift of his presence and we're
[1:17] using this Christmas theme to highlight
[1:19] an aspect of the house of the Lord and
[1:22] that aspect is the presence of God in
[1:26] the house of the Lord and as Sunday as
[1:27] we looked at it the with the Ark of the
[1:29] Covenant the greatest asset was God if
[1:31] you took God out of it you just look at
[1:33] salvage value it's it doesn't have it
[1:36] can't go it can't function it has no
[1:38] purpose and so in the house of the Lord
[1:40] and as it pertained to that Arc of the
[1:42] Covenant which you know had over $6
[1:44] Million worth of gold just in that in
[1:47] itself uh without God there it loses its
[1:50] real value and every single detail in
[1:53] the house of the Lord and everything
[1:55] that was uh whether it be the materials
[1:58] that were used and its arrangement
[1:59] structure everything was pointing to
[2:02] God's presence uh there was types and
[2:05] shadows and the curtains and everything
[2:07] the way that it was arranged was to lead
[2:09] us to that place and to emphasize his
[2:11] presence between the cherubims and in
[2:14] 1st Samuel chapter 4 as we saw that God
[2:17] had established Samuel as a prophet and
[2:20] the word of Samuel was being spoken to
[2:22] Israel as the voice of God and they
[2:25] immediately went into battle without
[2:27] consulting the prophet and when they
[2:29] went into battle lost they didn't return
[2:31] to the Lord to try to uh find out what
[2:33] was wrong but they went and talked to um
[2:36] the sons of the high priest who were
[2:38] evil and were worthless and they brought
[2:41] the Ark of the Covenant on the
[2:42] battlefield thinking that the presence
[2:45] of the Ark would be enough to bring them
[2:47] Victory and it showed that there's this
[2:50] danger in Tradition and
[2:52] Superstition where with the where
[2:54] there's a lack of obedience to the word
[2:56] of God a lack of faith or an
[2:58] understanding of what the Ark of the
[3:00] Covenant represented he say well the
[3:02] Lord's going to dwell between those
[3:04] cherubims Above The Mercy Seat I I
[3:07] wouldn't want to take the Ark of the
[3:09] Covenant and think that that had some
[3:10] magical power without the god that would
[3:12] dwell between those uh mer between those
[3:15] cherubim so there was a lack of
[3:17] understanding a lack of relationship uh
[3:19] with God and it was a warning to us that
[3:22] we cannot make the same mistake in this
[3:24] hour where we just substitute ritual for
[3:27] the presence of God you going to say
[3:29] well the presence of God there's ways
[3:31] that we could look at it's his word uh
[3:33] it's his will the presence of God it is
[3:35] even a person and so we cannot
[3:38] substitute a verbal confession of the
[3:40] message of the hour just the ritual and
[3:43] tradition of church order and observing
[3:45] things in the message we need that
[3:48] experience with the word of God or we
[3:51] will be just as powerless as Israel was
[3:53] that day before the Philistines and the
[3:55] Proclamation was kabad uh the name of
[3:58] the child was ikabod to indicate that
[4:00] the glory of God had departed from
[4:02] Israel and it wasn't just solely because
[4:05] the Ark of the Lord was taken but the
[4:08] Ark of the Lord being taken indicated
[4:10] and showed that God was no longer there
[4:12] the glory the shikina glory was no
[4:14] longer being manifested in Israel and
[4:17] the benefits of that the the power that
[4:19] came with his presence they were missing
[4:21] out on now I think that's maybe um
[4:24] enough there just to summarize some of
[4:27] the things that we were touching on
[4:28] Sunday in the gift of Christ's presence
[4:31] now if you turn to Psalms chapter
[4:33] 27 and I'm going to read verse four we
[4:36] know it begins with the Lord is my light
[4:37] my salvation he is the strength of my
[4:40] life so there's no fear I'm not afraid
[4:42] and we are circling back to the very
[4:44] first service we preached this year on
[4:47] the house of the Lord and we're kind of
[4:49] trying to wrap up this whole series
[4:51] we've done this year on the house of the
[4:53] Lord the different ways that we looked
[4:54] at it so we're going to go back to the
[4:55] beginning where we started and David
[4:58] says one thing have I desired of the
[5:00] Lord that will I seek after and we
[5:03] recognized in the very beginning that
[5:05] real living is the process of
[5:06] identifying value in recognizing things
[5:09] that have worth and that are important
[5:11] so your as we live life should be about
[5:13] determining real value a and True Value
[5:17] and in doing so simplifying Our Lives um
[5:21] to let those things have preeminence and
[5:23] give those things place in our life so
[5:25] this real living is a process of
[5:27] determining things of value and then in
[5:30] doing so simplifying our life so it
[5:31] leads to Simplicity one thing have I
[5:34] desired the Lord that will I seek after
[5:36] that I may dwell in the house of the
[5:39] Lord all the days of my life so we can
[5:41] say perfect Simplicity here would be
[5:43] living in the house of the Lord and this
[5:46] is kind of a begins to describe what he
[5:48] means by this he says to behold the
[5:51] beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his
[5:55] Temple so he's seeking God's presence
[5:57] he's seeking God's Beauty this isn't an
[5:59] air BNB where you want the host to be
[6:01] gone when you get there this is a
[6:03] situation where he says I want to go to
[6:04] the house of the Lord and the Lord
[6:06] better be there I I I want him to be
[6:09] there I want to see his Beauty I want to
[6:11] know him more I want to experience his
[6:13] goodness and the scriptures familiar and
[6:16] we probably mentioned this on a regular
[6:17] Cadence that brother bam took psalms 27
[6:20] veres 1 to5 when he preached the Rapture
[6:22] message in December of 65 and he was
[6:26] very open about my scripture is not
[6:28] typical he said this is not a Main
[6:30] Street scripture uh and so he was taking
[6:33] I believe a prophecy of the Rapture when
[6:36] he identified Psalms 27: 1 to5 and so
[6:40] this to me is a very important text
[6:43] these words here have application to the
[6:45] very moment you're living in right now
[6:48] in in in in the in the reality of the
[6:50] Rapture and he says one thing have I
[6:52] desired I want to dwell in the house of
[6:54] the Lord to behold the beauty of the
[6:56] Lord so the house of the Lord is a place
[6:58] of God's Beauty that word beauty mean
[7:00] speaks of kindness which we could think
[7:02] of his Mercy it speaks of pleasantness
[7:04] and favor which would even maybe
[7:06] indicate a Grace So to to behold the
[7:10] beauty it's to be pleasant and beautiful
[7:12] sweet and lovely and isn't that what we
[7:14] all are we're all just so sweet and
[7:16] lovely and the house of the Lord was a
[7:18] place where he could inquire it's to
[7:19] seek or to consider to reflect on but
[7:23] these things can only be so by his
[7:26] presence if you're going to inquire
[7:28] after the Lord he in his Temple you're
[7:30] you're looking for him you're seeking
[7:32] him you're wanting them to have
[7:34] preeminence we take these words that
[7:36] David expresses just very succinctly
[7:38] even in this one verse David is longing
[7:40] for deeply personal relationship with
[7:43] God where he feels his presence and he's
[7:46] empowered by it and it's real he just
[7:47] doesn't want to go worship he just
[7:49] doesn't want to go sacrifice he doesn't
[7:51] say one thing have I desired of the Lord
[7:53] is is to go offer sacrifices one thing
[7:56] have I desired is to be able to praise
[7:58] and to sing and to dance he says no I
[8:00] want to be able to experience his
[8:02] presence and have a a personal
[8:04] relationship with
[8:06] him to behold the beauty of the Lord
[8:09] this requires the presence of God in
[8:12] Proverbs 16:1 15 it says in the light of
[8:16] the king's countenance is life and his
[8:18] favor is as a cloud of the latter rain
[8:21] I'd like for you to think about end time
[8:23] prophecy signs in the heaven of a cloud
[8:26] the king's sword and all these different
[8:27] elements that begin to collide just even
[8:29] in one one scripture in the light the
[8:31] Lord is my light my salvation in the
[8:33] light of the king's countenance is life
[8:37] here's the living here's the empowering
[8:39] here's the quickening power and his
[8:40] favor is as a cloud of the latter rain
[8:44] it's in his face when you can see his
[8:47] face when you see one's countenance
[8:49] that's maybe sometimes the problem uh
[8:51] with texting and chatting and sometimes
[8:53] even on the phone is you can't see the
[8:55] person's facial expressions and so we
[8:57] try to use emojis and different things
[8:59] maybe to convey what we're saying but
[9:00] then sometimes you're using an emoji uh
[9:03] there's an emoji that I use and it's
[9:05] just like like someone's clenching their
[9:06] teeth and it's kind of like to me it's
[9:08] kind of like an e right and I think
[9:10] somebody said some one time why are you
[9:11] always wincing or why you know what are
[9:13] you afraid of I like that's not what
[9:15] that means right and and and whether or
[9:17] not this is actually praying hands or
[9:18] high five and so sometimes even in that
[9:21] we're
[9:22] confusing we're not really conveyant but
[9:25] if someone could see your face I want to
[9:26] see your eyes I want to see your face it
[9:28] declares favor we declare whether God
[9:30] was angry with us or declare whether or
[9:32] not he was pleased with us or there's a
[9:34] Grace to come to us and so in the light
[9:37] of the king's face in his face there is
[9:40] life in his favor from that countenance
[9:43] is as The Cloud of a latter
[9:45] rain this is what David wanted to see he
[9:47] wanted to see his face as he says in
[9:50] verse 7 of Psalms 27 verses 7 89 here oh
[9:53] Lord when I cry with my voice have mercy
[9:56] also upon me and answer me so this is
[9:58] this is kind of unpacking verse four one
[10:01] thing have I desired what does he want
[10:02] when thou said us seek ye my face my
[10:04] heart said unto thee thy face Lord will
[10:07] I seek now what what a what a request
[10:11] from God seek my face and an answer from
[10:13] David when God had already told Moses no
[10:16] man can see my face and live but yet
[10:19] this is something that God is inviting
[10:21] him to do seek my face and my heart said
[10:23] I will seek it hide not thy face far
[10:26] from me put not thy servant away in AER
[10:29] thou Hast been my help leave me not
[10:31] neither forsake me oh god of my
[10:33] salvation he wanted that nearness that
[10:36] closeness he wanted to see his face and
[10:38] his face not to be veiled or obscure or
[10:41] turned away he wanted to look at me let
[10:43] me know how you feel about me let me see
[10:45] your eyes let me see your truth and your
[10:47] reality hide not your face from you this
[10:50] is what David is longing for is the face
[10:52] of God in Psalms 89:
[10:56] 14-6 we use this scripture a few times
[10:58] in the subject to Mercy Justice and
[11:00] judgment are the habitation of thy
[11:02] Throne that's his Dwelling Place there
[11:04] in the throne is Justice and judgment
[11:07] but not just Justice and judgment but
[11:09] mercy and Truth why because mercy and
[11:12] Truth Shall go before thy face in your
[11:14] presence yes there's Justice in his
[11:16] presence yes there's judgment but in his
[11:19] throne it's a mercy Throne it's a
[11:21] judgment throne and there's mercy and
[11:23] Truth before his face notice he says
[11:26] blessed is the people that know the joy
[11:29] ful sound that's a cry that's a shout
[11:32] blessed are the people that know the
[11:35] joyful sound coming from that Throne the
[11:38] voice of judgment The Voice of Truth
[11:40] blessed are the people that know the
[11:42] joyful sound they shall walk O Lord in
[11:45] the light of thy
[11:48] countenance in his face in this shining
[11:51] in this brightness in this understanding
[11:53] and knowing who he is and seeing him
[11:55] face to face we know that when the seals
[11:58] are open brother BR refers to this as
[12:00] the as the complete M the complete
[12:02] secret is being revealed said the Bible
[12:05] becomes a new book and so when the the
[12:08] he says earlier in his ministry when
[12:09] you're looking into the word he's
[12:10] quoting God child of I when you look
[12:12] into the Bible you're looking at me face
[12:13] to face so when the Bible the seals are
[12:16] opened and this Bible becomes a new book
[12:18] book then we are beholding him clearly
[12:20] as in a glass we're seeing him face to
[12:23] face in the light of the king's
[12:25] countenance is life in the light of his
[12:28] countenance we can walk when we've heard
[12:29] the joyful sound in thy name shall they
[12:32] Rejoice all the day because it's shalom
[12:35] it is the rising of the sun it is a new
[12:37] day and in thy righteousness shall they
[12:39] be exalted it's in his righteousness
[12:42] that we're walking it's in the light of
[12:44] the word that we're walking and brother
[12:45] Bram said the beginning of righteousness
[12:47] is God's revealed
[12:50] truth so in order for us to uh uh be
[12:53] exalted in his righteousness there has
[12:55] to be revealed truth that makes him
[12:58] known that declares
[12:59] uh his his face that makes known the
[13:02] path that we should walk it's the light
[13:04] of his
[13:05] countenance these are things that relate
[13:07] to the gift of his presence the his
[13:10] provision and pleasure that comes with
[13:12] his presence a place of safety a place
[13:15] of beauty so David saying this one thing
[13:18] have I desired I'm going to seek after
[13:19] it I I want to dwell in the house of the
[13:21] Lord I want to behold his Beauty he said
[13:23] to seek his face so I'll seek it where
[13:25] is he going to find it in that secret
[13:27] place so he says in verse 5 for in the
[13:30] time of trouble he shall hide me now
[13:32] think of this idea of being hid hide me
[13:35] in his Pavilion they seem to be a
[13:38] strange word he shall hide me in his
[13:40] Pavilion and he essentially is
[13:42] amplifying it more with this phrase in
[13:44] the secret of his Tabernacle shall he
[13:47] hide me so again David is emphasizing
[13:50] this that the wicked and his enemies
[13:52] have gathered themselves around him to
[13:54] eat up his flesh which is a type of this
[13:56] physical death and when they tried they
[13:58] stumbled and fell so there's your very
[14:00] image of the climax of The Rapture
[14:02] change of our body defeating death he
[14:04] says in this time in the presence of my
[14:07] enemies in this time of trouble I'm
[14:09] going to be hid in God's Pavilion he's
[14:12] going to hide me in the secret of his
[14:15] Tabernacle he shall set me up upon a
[14:18] rock Pavilion could have very well been
[14:20] translated to Tabernacle there in the
[14:22] first part of this verse it's that a den
[14:24] a booth uh it implies maybe some sort of
[14:27] covert something that's out of the way
[14:29] Tabernacle could have been translated to
[14:30] tent there it's a dwelling it's a home
[14:32] it's a
[14:34] habitation and the secret this covering
[14:36] this shelter it's a hiding place it's
[14:38] for protection when it's secret it's
[14:42] concealed and it's something that's
[14:44] hidden it speaks of hiding something
[14:47] carefully so it's not publicly known
[14:49] it's not obvious it's not something that
[14:52] you would just be able to uh figure out
[14:54] and see I think of even brother George
[14:56] Smith telling uh talking about that cave
[14:59] that brother Bron would go to in Green's
[15:00] Mill and just how hidden it was and how
[15:03] obscure and there's things in our lives
[15:06] when we hike and we we go certain places
[15:07] and we do certain things it's like oh
[15:09] they said there was this place right
[15:10] here be looking for it real careful and
[15:12] you'll miss it and you never see it you
[15:14] never find it look it's right there it's
[15:16] over there I can't see it I can't and
[15:18] you could do it several times and always
[15:20] miss it because it's not obvious it's
[15:24] concealed the secret place of the
[15:26] Tabernacle we know was behind that Veil
[15:29] in the holiest of holies the most holy
[15:31] Place The Secret of his Tabernacle is
[15:33] where his presence was that's that's
[15:36] that singular place not outer Court not
[15:39] inner court but in Behind the Veil The
[15:41] Secret of his Tabernacle is where he
[15:44] wanted to be for in a time of trouble
[15:46] he'll hide me in his Pavilion in the
[15:48] secret of his Tabernacle if all else
[15:50] fails that's the one place I know I can
[15:52] be and be safe right want to use the
[15:56] scripture in the Song of Solomon 2:14
[16:00] as a language a poetic language that
[16:02] describes what David is describing oh my
[16:06] Dove Thou Art In The Cliffs Of The Rock
[16:10] in the secret places of the stairs in
[16:12] the protection place of the stairs a
[16:15] step it's a a way leading to place the
[16:19] secret places of the stairs not the
[16:21] steps of the stairs but the place that's
[16:23] hidden beyond the steps let me see thy
[16:26] countenance let me hear thy voice for
[16:29] sweet is thy voice and thy countenance
[16:31] is comely it's beautiful this is a
[16:34] poetry that would describe that place
[16:36] that David wanted to be I know where the
[16:38] entrance is I know where the court is
[16:40] but Lord I want you to hide me uh in
[16:43] that place as the Bible says a man will
[16:44] be a hiding place he will be a rock in a
[16:46] weary land he will be a protection he'll
[16:49] be a shelter hide me in the secret place
[16:52] of the stairs there in the secret place
[16:55] I'll behold your face I'll see you as
[16:57] you are and I'll be able to hear hear
[16:59] your voice for it is sweet and your your
[17:01] countenance is beautiful so David
[17:04] describes in this time of trouble this
[17:06] place in the house of the Lord there
[17:09] where there's a hidden Beauty it's
[17:11] secluded it's secret it's safe where he
[17:14] beholds his face and hears his
[17:18] voice I'm amplifying right now just this
[17:21] thought in the scripture that he shall
[17:24] hide me in the secret of his Tabernacle
[17:26] where his face is and so Psalms 91: 1:4
[17:30] he that dwelleth in the secret place of
[17:32] the most high shall abide under the
[17:35] shadow of the
[17:36] almighty this would be an illusion to
[17:39] the house of the Lord where the Lord
[17:40] dwelleth between the cherubims he that
[17:42] dwells in the secret place of the most
[17:44] high would be dwelling where the Lord
[17:47] dwell under the shadow of the almighty
[17:50] that implies in his presence there under
[17:52] his covering secretly hidden him I will
[17:55] say of the Lord he is my refuge and my
[17:58] Fortress
[17:59] he is become my salvation he is the one
[18:02] in whom I hide he he is my protector my
[18:06] God in him will I trust surely he shall
[18:09] deliver thee From The Snare of the
[18:10] Fowler and from the noisome pestilence
[18:13] he will deliver the in a time of trouble
[18:15] he will protect you you can go and read
[18:17] more in Psalm 91 and read in other
[18:19] places that we've got to have a
[18:21] confidence in this end time with all the
[18:23] pestilence with all the threatenings
[18:24] with all the rebellions with all the
[18:26] conspiracies with all the diseases and
[18:28] all the economics and everything that
[18:30] seems like it could change in a moment
[18:32] we have to have confidence in one
[18:35] thing that he will deliver us he will
[18:37] protect us and all the noisome
[18:40] pestilence should be a phrase that we
[18:42] could probably recognize on a daily
[18:43] basis the noisome pestilence all around
[18:46] us and where will he hide Us in his
[18:48] presence under the shadow of the
[18:50] almighty a secret place of the most high
[18:53] amen he shall cover thee with his
[18:57] feathers and under his wing shalt thou
[19:00] trust his truth shall be thy shield and
[19:03] buckler what does that what does that
[19:05] bring to mind what does that look like
[19:06] The Mercy
[19:08] Seat where there's mercy and Truth under
[19:10] the shadow of the almighty and what is
[19:12] it it's his feathers under his wings he
[19:14] will hide you the truth is going to be
[19:17] your shield and buckler there hid in his
[19:19] presence he covers you he's he's
[19:22] inviting you to that place that at one
[19:24] time would have been death that no other
[19:26] man could enter in except the high
[19:28] priest once a year but Christ having
[19:29] forever consecrated a away he said this
[19:32] is where I want us to be this is where I
[19:34] want us to dwell even if you see God
[19:36] they dwelling in uh in between those
[19:39] cherums and you have these two cherums
[19:42] that are together over that you could
[19:44] even see an image of Christ and his
[19:46] bride being the embodiment of God
[19:50] himself he's going to hide you brother
[19:53] bam uses the phrase the secret Rapture
[19:55] of the supernatural bride and these SCP
[19:58] script are describing that whether it be
[20:01] in type or even in Prophecy these
[20:03] scriptures are describing the secret
[20:05] Rapture of the supernatural bride
[20:09] wherein God is hiding Us in the secret
[20:11] of his
[20:13] Tabernacle Psalms
[20:15] 31:20 takes a very similar language to
[20:18] what David uses in Psalms 27:5 Thou
[20:20] shalt hide them in the secret of thy
[20:24] presence that that's the real tonight my
[20:28] my main emphasis was to show The Secret
[20:30] of his
[20:31] presence uh and whenever it's gift
[20:34] giving time you try to keep it a secret
[20:35] well you can't really do that anymore
[20:37] because I get uh emails from the post
[20:40] office for mail that's coming and I
[20:42] anything that's sent by UPS I get that
[20:44] and everything we buy is on our debit
[20:46] card at our bank so I can see everywhere
[20:48] that's being Sho I don't get surprises
[20:49] there are no
[20:51] secrets so you have to learn how to act
[20:56] surprised my mom told me one time Aon
[20:58] you just need how to learn to play
[21:01] dumb I was like well it just doesn't
[21:03] come natural like it does for you Mom
[21:06] I'm kidding I didn't say
[21:07] that uh I'm I'm joking I really am
[21:10] joking but we there's a we'd go to Great
[21:12] Links to try to uh uh hide things and be
[21:15] secret well it's the same thing the
[21:16] secret of his
[21:18] presence Thou shalt hide them in the
[21:20] secret of thy presence from the pride of
[21:22] man the pride of man now as I was
[21:25] thinking about this today the plots the
[21:28] schemes the lies in all the ways the
[21:31] pride of man identifies itself in the
[21:34] hour that we're living in all the
[21:35] arrogance and all the pleasures and all
[21:37] the entertainments he's going to hide Us
[21:39] in the secret of his presence and from
[21:42] the pride of man so the pride of man is
[21:44] still seemingly compassion itself about
[21:47] you you're still in the presence of your
[21:50] enemies as Psalms 23 would say but yet
[21:52] you're still feasting at the king's
[21:53] table he hasn't dropped the Veil Down
[21:56] and put you in another dimension you're
[21:57] right there and TOA but raptured up
[22:00] quickly to meet the Lord in a spiritual
[22:02] sense feasting on spiritual mana and
[22:06] it's hiding you from the schemes and the
[22:08] plots and the lies of men Thou shalt
[22:11] keep them secretly in a pavilion from
[22:14] The Strife of
[22:16] tongues when we look at the whole Secret
[22:18] Of God being revealed the whole Secret
[22:20] Of God is revealed for the rapturing of
[22:23] the
[22:25] bride and as God begins to reveal his
[22:27] Secrets he's he's bringing you into
[22:30] himself he's protecting you with divine
[22:33] revelation he's revealing his secrets to
[22:35] you and that's where your pleasure is
[22:37] that's where your power is that's where
[22:39] your protection is in this end
[22:42] time and it's no curious thing that this
[22:45] scripture is applicable to a Rapture
[22:47] season in the secret of thy presence
[22:49] will you hide me from the pride of man
[22:51] and kept secretly in that Pavilion that
[22:53] Tabernacle that covert from The Strife
[22:56] of tongues
[22:58] brother banham says when he preaches the
[23:00] Rapture he says we're warned that the
[23:01] doctrine of this in the last days will
[23:03] be scorned at what's the doctrine of
[23:06] this his return to catch his bride
[23:08] away the the the secret of his presence
[23:11] the doctrine of this the teaching and
[23:14] the truth of the Rapture will be scorned
[23:17] at and in other words there will be The
[23:19] Strife of tongues there will be the
[23:21] pride of man that even is very directly
[23:25] attributed to the Rapture and the
[23:27] teaching the truth of the rapture
[23:30] in 2 Peter 3: 3 and 4 this is the
[23:34] scripture brother bam uses and was
[23:36] pointing to and he said the doctrine of
[23:37] this in the last days will be scorned at
[23:40] knowing this first and I was even
[23:42] thinking about reading second Peter
[23:45] three as our text tonight because I'm
[23:47] drawing a lot from this second Peter
[23:50] whether it be chapter 2 and chapter 1
[23:52] even and chapter 3 knowing this first
[23:54] that there shall come in the last days
[23:56] scoffers there's your the the being
[23:59] scorned at these scoffers they mock they
[24:01] delude they or they try to deceive am
[24:04] know their mockery deludes the truth of
[24:07] of this their their sarcasm their lies
[24:10] all their efforts fight the truth of
[24:13] this and what is it the truth that the
[24:15] last days these scoffers walking after
[24:17] their own lust say this in verse four
[24:20] where is the promise of his
[24:23] coming now we can say oh well I'll just
[24:25] tell you right now where the promise of
[24:26] his coming is well turn there and tell
[24:28] you what the promise is but that's not
[24:30] what they
[24:31] mean CU notice he says for since the
[24:33] fathers fell asleep all things continue
[24:36] as they were from the beginning of
[24:38] Creation in other words nothing's
[24:41] changed everything's the
[24:43] same nothing seems to have occurred
[24:46] because everything just keeps going
[24:48] along just the same as it always have so
[24:50] when they say where is the promise of
[24:52] his coming it's not that he has promised
[24:55] to return or it's not that he's promised
[24:57] uh to do do something but where how can
[25:00] you say anything has happened because
[25:02] nothing seems to have
[25:04] changed the word their promise means
[25:06] where's the message or the announcement
[25:08] of his coming the word that's used come
[25:10] from the Bas meaning of angel or
[25:13] messenger where's the one that where's
[25:15] the announcement where's the promise of
[25:17] his
[25:18] coming where's the announcement even of
[25:21] it coming there it it's been a
[25:23] controversial word for decades in the
[25:25] message but just in the simple Greek
[25:26] peris perisa that that's described there
[25:29] where is the promise of his
[25:31] presence where is the promise of his
[25:34] presence you say well it's a it's a the
[25:37] Bible says it's secret well where's the
[25:39] change where's the
[25:40] difference the word uh presence here is
[25:44] joined from a root of Peri which means
[25:46] to be alongside of or to be present
[25:49] with sometimes we just think that
[25:51] certain things happen it it's just a
[25:53] flash it just happens come and go but
[25:55] this is a an arrival this is a coming
[25:57] and then this ter together
[25:59] with where is the promise of his
[26:01] presence we can say his coming here in
[26:03] the scripture where is the promise of
[26:05] his coming we can say where is the
[26:06] promise of his appearance where is the
[26:09] promise of his presence not just a brief
[26:13] uh uh revealing but an arrival and a
[26:15] presence
[26:16] with and scoffers Will Mock his coming
[26:19] they'll mock his presence they'll try to
[26:21] delude it to try to water it
[26:24] down in the same way that they would
[26:26] have in the days of his first coming
[26:28] right
[26:29] is in Isaiah 7:14 therefore the Lord
[26:31] himself shall give you a sign Behold a
[26:34] virgin shall conceive and bear a son and
[26:36] shall call his name
[26:39] Emmanuel and the Hebrew Emmanuel means
[26:41] god with us or with us is God Matthew
[26:45] chap 1: 23 when the scripture says that
[26:48] it might be fulfilled as is written by
[26:50] the prophet Isaiah his name shall be
[26:51] called imanuel he says which being
[26:53] interpreted is God With Us in other
[26:57] words Jesus Christ was to reflect God's
[26:59] presence on Earth he was now the new
[27:02] Most Holy place he was the mercy seat
[27:05] that was where God would dwell this is
[27:07] my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased
[27:09] to dwell he was a bear of God's presence
[27:12] and the Bible says that it was fulfilled
[27:14] Mary received having not been touched by
[27:16] man but the child conceived into her was
[27:18] conceived by the Holy Ghost something
[27:21] that she kept secretly in her heart God
[27:23] had to give Joseph A Vision to know that
[27:25] this child which is going to be born of
[27:27] her is from God
[27:29] you go back to the prophecy Behold a
[27:31] virgin shall conceive we understand it
[27:34] in the Fulfillment that it was a woman
[27:36] that had never known a
[27:38] man but to a Jew and a Hebrew they go
[27:40] back and say well no that word there
[27:41] says Behold a young Maiden will conceive
[27:44] could be a young married woman it could
[27:45] just be a woman newly married but it
[27:47] doesn't necessarily mean that she has
[27:49] never known a man but yet when God
[27:51] interpreted his word by bringing it to
[27:53] pass a virgin conceived and so what was
[27:57] the what was the scoffing what was the
[27:59] mocking oh he's an illegitimate child
[28:01] and mo Joseph had to do this to cover
[28:03] this up they they they weren't satisfied
[28:05] with God's interpretation but they
[28:07] mocked it and they they scorned it but
[28:09] it was God with
[28:13] them Christmas in itself is we said
[28:16] Sunday we're not endorsing the
[28:18] celebration of it nor would we
[28:19] discourage it we just trust that the
[28:21] leaders in the own home will observe it
[28:23] as they feel led but in general at this
[28:26] time of year the idea
[28:28] Christmas
[28:29] celebration and it celebrates the
[28:31] arrival or the coming of Jesus Christ
[28:34] God with us some of the most moving uh
[28:38] Christmas songs are those that speak of
[28:41] Emmanuel
[28:43] coming word that was used and used quite
[28:46] often to Signal the uh Christmas time is
[28:50] advent and all the children know by the
[28:53] Advent calendars that have a chocolate
[28:54] for every day and I think ours were
[28:57] empty
[28:59] a week
[29:03] ago short quick
[29:06] work but the Advent means presence it it
[29:09] speaks of an
[29:11] arrival and that's that's what is That's
[29:13] What Christmas represents as the coming
[29:15] and then all the nominal world is
[29:16] looking for the second
[29:18] Advent
[29:20] right the magical quotations they're
[29:23] they're looking forward to
[29:26] that the Bible says in 2 Peter 3:10
[29:30] though but the day of the Lord will come
[29:31] as a thief in the
[29:33] night this day that's being described
[29:35] there will begin and will begin to
[29:37] settle in and these events that take
[29:39] place it's not going to all of a sudden
[29:41] be a a chapter break and there's a great
[29:44] scroll in the sky or a crawl on the
[29:46] television screen and people like Oh
[29:48] look The Day of the Lord has
[29:50] started and we all get notifications
[29:53] right an amber
[29:55] alert and now everybody's been informed
[29:57] now it's going to come as a thief in the
[29:59] night I think I've probably said this
[30:01] before little a word of the wise to the
[30:03] thieves don't announce that you're
[30:05] coming right you know you don't say hey
[30:07] I'm going to rob your house tomorrow
[30:09] night be looking for me back door it's
[30:11] where I'm coming right through the back
[30:13] door but a thief comes veiled he comes
[30:16] hidden he uses the phrase as a thief in
[30:19] the night Peter does to describe how it
[30:22] would come secretly or
[30:24] undetected Jesus even in what time went
[30:26] up to the feast uh uh hidden in secret
[30:29] veiled as it was and we know that when a
[30:32] thief comes veiled and hidden he does
[30:33] not announce his arrival globally
[30:36] doesn't uh tell you beforehand exactly
[30:38] when it's happening but afterwards those
[30:40] that have missed it comes with great
[30:43] sorrow and
[30:44] loss Thessalonians 52 1 Thessalonians
[30:47] chap 5:2 for yourselves know perfectly
[30:49] that the day of the Lord so cometh as a
[30:51] thief in the
[30:53] night brother BR said the Rapture will
[30:55] be a secret
[30:58] in the sermon Lord just once more he
[31:00] says it's a secret coming the Rapture is
[31:03] comes to steal away like that book I
[31:06] read that time of Juliet and Romeo we
[31:08] always say Romeo and Juliet has the
[31:10] order been corrected Juliet and Romeo he
[31:13] come at the night time when the people
[31:15] were sleeping in worldliness and the
[31:17] church all in worldliness he comes as a
[31:20] thief in the night it's a secret coming
[31:22] the Rapture is to steal away to catch
[31:24] away he wants to bring his subjects to
[31:27] him he wants to gather his
[31:29] elect Revelations 3: 2 and 3 at the
[31:33] announcement to the sardan church age Be
[31:35] watchful and strengthen the things which
[31:38] remain that are ready to die for I have
[31:41] not found thy works perfect before God
[31:43] remember therefore how thou Hast
[31:45] received and heard and hold fast and
[31:48] repent if therefore Thou shalt not watch
[31:51] I will come on thee as a thief and thou
[31:54] shalt not know what hour I will come
[31:56] upon thee we could just see how uh Rich
[32:00] these phrases are to other prophecies
[32:02] and things in the scripture says I will
[32:05] come to thee as a thief in this hour we
[32:07] know that in Revelations chapter 3:20 he
[32:09] comes and if any man hear my voice and
[32:13] open the door I will come into him and
[32:16] will s with him and he with me but if
[32:18] you can't if you do not know the voice
[32:21] if you do not hear him if you're not on
[32:22] watch to those who look for him will he
[32:24] appear a second
[32:25] time why because he comes as a thief in
[32:28] the
[32:29] night now if I
[32:31] could and I guess I'm saying if I could
[32:34] I'm going to
[32:35] try to just transition some here that if
[32:39] we could in our Mind's Eye imagine a
[32:44] time of trouble a day great day of
[32:46] darkness and sin and depravity the way
[32:48] that we could describe it in Revelations
[32:50] 3 the parallels we could draw to uh men
[32:53] in the last days walking after their own
[32:55] lust with
[32:56] scoffers and and those who say where is
[32:59] the promise of his coming and the wicked
[33:02] and our enemies gathering around us and
[33:04] all the assaults from every angle and we
[33:07] know that we need God and we feel that
[33:09] our days are being pressed and it's a
[33:11] terrible Dreadful time it's a dark time
[33:14] and God says well in the secret of my
[33:17] presence I can hide you and we would say
[33:19] I want to know the
[33:21] secret I want to know where the secret
[33:24] is and as Peter has written about the
[33:27] day of the Lord coming as a thief and
[33:29] the mockers and scoffers in the end time
[33:30] they say where is the benefit the
[33:32] promise of the protection of his coming
[33:34] cuz nothing's
[33:36] changed he opened his letter in verse 11
[33:38] 2 Peter chapter 1:1 saying for so an
[33:41] entrance shall be ministered unto you
[33:44] abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom
[33:45] of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[33:48] Christ for so an entrance the word there
[33:51] is translated to coming in one place for
[33:53] so a coming shall be ministered unto you
[33:56] abundantly it's the ACT of entering
[33:59] behold I stand at the door and knock If
[34:01] any man will open up this entrance be
[34:04] administered a way leading into his
[34:06] presence a way leading into a
[34:08] relationship not uh not uh a
[34:12] Superstition not ritual not
[34:14] tradition not
[34:16] denominationalism not the form and
[34:18] structure of the church ages that go
[34:20] brother bam is showing us very clearly
[34:22] there's been an indictment to it we
[34:24] being called out of it but a a coming
[34:27] shall be ministered unto you a door
[34:29] opened in heaven I was called up
[34:32] higher an entrance ministered a message
[34:35] if I could say it this way a message
[34:36] revealing the secret of his arrival a
[34:40] message pointing us to the gift of his
[34:46] presence I would challenge you that if
[34:49] there has been any Scarlet Letter placed
[34:51] upon these things if there's been any
[34:53] scarecrows that have been erected
[34:54] through many decades that have pared
[34:57] some of the same scriptures and said
[34:58] some of the same things I challenge you
[35:00] to get serious with what was taught in
[35:02] the message of the hour and ask yourself
[35:04] you said it what does it mean to me
[35:07] really what is the reality of it if
[35:09] brother Bron was so adamant about these
[35:11] things if his ministry very consistently
[35:13] especially at a certain juncture begin
[35:15] to point us to the Fulfillment of
[35:16] certain things Lord I don't want to just
[35:18] bury my head in the sand and say the
[35:19] sun's not shining the sun's not shining
[35:21] Lord I want to know what does this mean
[35:23] in a very real practical way to me not
[35:25] get weird with it not get superstitious
[35:27] not become ritualistic not become
[35:30] cultish Lord I want to know if there was
[35:32] going to be if there is a coming that's
[35:34] been ministered to us if there's a
[35:36] message that is revealing the secret of
[35:37] the Rapture Lord I want to receive the
[35:40] gift of your presence in this
[35:43] hour thank you Lord in the sermon the
[35:45] identified Christ of all
[35:47] ages he says the trouble with people
[35:50] today we find them living in the glare
[35:52] of another
[35:53] age this ain't no April Fool's message
[35:58] he says just like Jesus found when he
[36:00] come he found them living in the glare
[36:02] of the law and ignoring what was take to
[36:04] take place in his his age I love this
[36:07] you know what's the matter
[36:10] today I'm not I'm reading let me just
[36:13] say the same exact thing and he says it
[36:17] dozens of ways especially during this
[36:19] time period that he's saying what
[36:20] happened then is repeated itself again
[36:23] what was the matter with the Lutheran I
[36:25] want you to focus on this very very
[36:26] intently I I'm I'm going to be finishing
[36:29] up here pretty soon but there's a a
[36:31] phrase here that I believe is not
[36:33] accidental we must catch this you know
[36:36] what's the matter today what was the
[36:37] matter with the Lutheran well because
[36:39] they were living in the glare of the
[36:40] Lutheran age when John Wesley found the
[36:43] secret of
[36:45] sanctification now pick up on that when
[36:49] God had revealed justification to
[36:52] Luther they stayed back in that
[36:55] Revelation and didn't go further in the
[36:57] light of God's word when John Wesley
[36:59] found the secret of sanctification they
[37:02] couldn't go because they were living in
[37:03] the glare of Luther's age what happened
[37:05] to the Pentecostals why Wesley was so
[37:08] organized until he was living in the
[37:09] glare of another age they were in
[37:11] Wesley's age when the baptism of the
[37:13] Holy Ghost fell upon the
[37:14] Pentecostals or when the secret of that
[37:17] has been found been discovered or
[37:19] brought back to the church they were
[37:21] living in that Wesley said Wesley said
[37:23] sanctification it was hard for them to
[37:25] believe the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[37:27] the restoration of the gifts they were
[37:29] living in a glare of another age and
[37:32] that's what they were doing when Jesus
[37:34] come so I ask you what day are we living
[37:37] in now it is not a time for the secret
[37:40] of justification it is not a time for
[37:43] the revealing of The Secret of
[37:44] sanctification it's not the time for the
[37:46] secret of the restoration of the gifts
[37:48] but it's the time of the secret of his
[37:51] presence where it's time where he
[37:53] himself steps into it it's a time where
[37:56] he who has guided this and watched out
[37:58] over it all the way down it's a time
[38:00] when the Holy Ghost itself is made
[38:05] known just as Wesley found the secret of
[38:08] sanctification there had to be a
[38:10] messenger that found the secret of his
[38:13] presence in Amos chap 3:7 surely the
[38:16] Lord God will do nothing but he
[38:18] revealeth his secret unto his servants
[38:20] the
[38:22] prophets he could not just come
[38:25] along and
[38:28] bring to pass these things I I there's
[38:32] a there there's so much that must be
[38:36] expressed in this moment I just trust
[38:37] God could give this just begin to
[38:39] Quicken some things to you the truth of
[38:42] justification had been lost and Luther
[38:45] restored it the truth of sanctification
[38:47] watered down Wesley restores it the
[38:49] gifts had been mixed and mingled and
[38:51] there was a lot of gifts in in the
[38:53] Methodist you say well shouting and
[38:55] praising and those things is Pentecostal
[38:56] well they were doing that the the
[38:57] Wesleyan age and with the restoration of
[38:59] the gifts though God is restoring
[39:01] certain truths and God's bringing back
[39:02] that birth the new birth comprised of
[39:04] those three
[39:05] things now but when we come to certain
[39:08] aspects in the end time God is going to
[39:11] do things he hasn't done yet he's going
[39:14] to be fulfilling scriptures that had not
[39:18] been fulfilled yet he's going to come
[39:21] now and he needs a restoration in order
[39:23] for these things to be fulfilled so when
[39:25] he does that he has he's going to
[39:27] revealing this secret he's got to do it
[39:29] through a prophet right no there
[39:32] couldn't just be this uh there couldn't
[39:35] just be a
[39:36] global uh Zen or Chi right that we just
[39:40] all kind of had where we we're fully
[39:42] enlightened to the fact that we are now
[39:45] in fact God and now I have this
[39:47] conundrum about who I pray to because I
[39:50] am God and I have become one with God so
[39:54] much that I am God and really what you
[39:56] become is a message Buddhist
[39:58] right I'm a
[39:59] Buddhist and you are expressing things
[40:02] that just kind of like this Collective
[40:04] Enlightenment that we've all come into
[40:06] but this is God had to send a voice God
[40:09] has said this is how I'll do it I'll do
[40:11] it by means of a prophet and I believe
[40:14] that this is so plain and rooted in
[40:16] Scripture that this is how God does
[40:18] things that no matter how strange it
[40:19] might seem and no matter how unfamiliar
[40:21] it might be this is how God said he
[40:24] would do it that means that God said in
[40:26] his Bible there would come a time when
[40:28] he had have to raise up a voice to speak
[40:31] truth to bring people back to the Bible
[40:33] and it would be in an age when the whole
[40:35] world could be reached and
[40:37] contacted say really in the end time in
[40:39] billions of Christians there'd be one
[40:41] voice it's just the way God's done
[40:43] it and brother brandham says in the
[40:45] sermon calling Jesus on the scene I
[40:47] believe we must really uh uh wrestle
[40:51] with these statements but there's always
[40:52] a gift that manifests the presence of
[40:54] God and through there you yourself have
[40:57] to believe it a gift that manifests the
[41:01] presence of
[41:04] God John Wesley found the secret of
[41:08] sanctification this end time there's
[41:10] going to be a prophet that's going to
[41:11] find be given granted the secret of his
[41:14] presence and we had on earth a gift that
[41:17] manifested the presence of God and we
[41:20] had to believe
[41:22] it in the sermon and I have heard but
[41:25] now I see that if there ever is a secret
[41:27] comes out from God to be made known to
[41:29] the people it'll never come through a
[41:31] seminary it'll never be never come
[41:33] through a group of people it never did
[41:35] it always will has and will through one
[41:37] individual a
[41:41] prophet when we talked Sunday I believe
[41:43] it was on the
[41:45] premise I think these things we revisit
[41:48] these things themes quite a bit because
[41:50] no matter what we preach must have the
[41:53] context of what's been given and the
[41:56] purpose of it right you lose if you lose
[41:59] the narrative you lose the plot then
[42:01] later on you could just be like well you
[42:03] know maybe our Prophet didn't say that
[42:06] right we just erase it and we just take
[42:08] the Book of Mormon and we kind of
[42:09] massage it around and we change it into
[42:10] something else year after year after
[42:12] year and we have the prophets who kind
[42:14] of update the word of
[42:16] God if if you lose sight of the plot if
[42:18] you lose sight of the
[42:20] premise if there was value in it then if
[42:22] there was intent if there was purpose
[42:24] understand what it was to know whether
[42:25] or not that is a glare another age are
[42:27] relevant today and if you lose sight of
[42:29] the premise amen we'll fall right back
[42:32] into the trap to where there's no
[42:34] Redemption out of this is the age of the
[42:37] finished cycle so in other words if you
[42:40] don't go into the finishing of the cycle
[42:42] and it moves into that particular cycle
[42:44] if you don't go into that it is death
[42:46] with no
[42:47] Revival you will come up before the
[42:49] white Throne judgment there is no
[42:52] Redemption cuz God comes to the place
[42:54] where I'm done I'm finished this is
[42:55] everything I've been trying to do this
[42:56] is what I've been trying to accomplish
[42:59] so brother bam says in the first seal at
[43:00] the end of the Pentecostal age we are
[43:03] supposed to receive according to the
[43:05] word as God helped me tonight to show
[43:07] you through here that we are to receive
[43:09] a messenger that'll take all the Loose
[43:11] Ends out there and I believe there's a
[43:15] Ministry of tying up the Loose Ends and
[43:18] then according to the various statements
[43:19] he makes to that effect there's this
[43:21] other part and reveal the whole Secret
[43:24] Of God for the rapturing of the church
[43:27] amen this is a message pointing us to
[43:30] Christ because he's pointing us away
[43:32] from ritual away from tradition away
[43:35] from the Creeds of man away from
[43:37] Superstition away from
[43:39] himself he even went so far as to say as
[43:42] John the Baptist said I must decrease he
[43:43] must increase brother BR put himself in
[43:45] the same
[43:46] pattern he was a voice with his finger
[43:49] pointing us to the revealed
[43:52] word if a secret was ever going to come
[43:54] from God it would take a prophet to
[43:56] point us to it
[43:58] if I could just dramatize it as if
[44:00] brother brandom came and knew where that
[44:02] Clift was in The
[44:04] Rock he could said behold this is where
[44:06] it is what does he say when he looks at
[44:07] the cloud he said that's our Lord up
[44:09] there things he pointed us to said well
[44:12] then is that literally then Christ doing
[44:14] certain things it was a sign given in
[44:16] the Heavens to show us the supreme
[44:19] authority the wigged one certain things
[44:21] are happening oh they become a a maybe a
[44:24] a a a stain to some people people in a
[44:27] controversy I'm not afraid of the
[44:30] controversy this controversy of the
[44:32] bride God is going to vindicate it God
[44:34] is going to settle
[44:37] it and it took a prophet a messenger to
[44:39] begin to identify these things he says
[44:42] don't all go to Jeffersonville what did
[44:44] he say about moving to
[44:46] Tucson don't do it for me don't follow
[44:49] me he said you better find the mind of
[44:51] God you you better be following the will
[44:52] of God that was the message that was
[44:54] follow God's voice follow God's will
[44:57] have thus sayith the Lord or keep still
[44:59] dress yourself in the
[45:01] word my goodness we've made it as easy
[45:03] as just all of us changing our last name
[45:05] to
[45:06] branom right staying at home and writing
[45:09] a python script that'll just play the
[45:11] message on repeat in perpetuity so all
[45:14] we have to do is push play once and talk
[45:17] about an interesting Paradox that'll be
[45:18] through python but there's a way where
[45:22] we're try and we we could just disal it
[45:24] down to things that are such lwh hanging
[45:25] fruit so easy to to accomplish well
[45:28] let's just all move to Jeffersonville
[45:30] let's just all move to Lima whatever it
[45:31] might be or Johnson City that's that
[45:34] would be the easiest thing we could do
[45:37] but to seek his
[45:39] face to fight through all the the the
[45:42] voices and the crowds and the
[45:44] controversies and the lies to be rooted
[45:46] in faith to believe God's word is true
[45:49] this Bible is correct no matter how much
[45:51] overwhelming evidence they want to come
[45:53] up with well guess what we just found a
[45:54] manuscript to where these things were
[45:57] were written of Before Time in this
[45:58] civilization so many millions of years
[46:00] ago and we found an alien craft with a
[46:03] copy of a Bible from some other planet
[46:04] we can prove it through carbon dating
[46:06] I'd say oh well isn't that neat that God
[46:07] did
[46:09] that there must have been some aliens
[46:11] somewhere else that God wanted to do
[46:13] this with it's not going to stumble
[46:15] me because God when he reveals himself
[46:18] personally to you and God has Vindicated
[46:20] his presence amongst us and said you can
[46:22] take me at my word we read the King
[46:25] James version and we and we We Believe
[46:27] well this is God's Bible this is his
[46:29] love letter to us but you realize King
[46:31] James I I remember when people were like
[46:32] that's blasphemous that they're calling
[46:34] LeBron James King James like you do
[46:36] realize that King James is just like a
[46:38] king in England right I mean it was it
[46:40] wasn't like God's secret name and Jesus
[46:43] in English is James it was it's not that
[46:45] at all but we have a Bible that was
[46:48] translated for some interesting reasons
[46:49] King James but yet he got the Bible and
[46:52] we read that and we believe it's an
[46:53] accurate translation but do you realize
[46:55] other believers in other countries are
[46:57] having to read translations that are not
[46:59] necessarily King James and they may not
[47:01] be as accurate as we believe ours is but
[47:04] that God is obligated and God has
[47:06] promised that I will make myself known
[47:09] to you in every tongue in every
[47:12] culture my voice will be lived
[47:15] throughout the
[47:18] world because God has made
[47:20] this an end time
[47:24] transaction with his bride
[47:27] oh my Dove Thou Art in the cffs of the
[47:30] Rock in the secret place of the stairs I
[47:34] want to see your face I want to hear
[47:36] your voice that's where we are
[47:42] today and brother brandham said and
[47:44] God's only provided place of worship he
[47:46] says when Once the genuine word comes
[47:48] into you the word Jesus then brother the
[47:52] message is no secret to you then you
[47:55] know it brother it's it's all lit up
[47:57] before you there's our Christmas
[48:00] lights when Jesus the word comes into
[48:03] you the message is no secret to you then
[48:07] no secret to you then why because he's
[48:09] promised to make his secret known hide
[48:12] you in the secret of that truth it's the
[48:14] secret
[48:17] coming these are beautiful truths when
[48:20] Once the genuine word comes into you the
[48:23] message is no secret it's all lit up
[48:27] before you
[48:32] good some of the statements of brother
[48:35] brandham that I've been thinking about a
[48:36] lot over the last few weeks is brother
[48:37] BR says if you want deity in your midst
[48:39] then welcome and receive the
[48:41] word I believe that holds true today
[48:44] more than it ever has
[48:46] before we're living in a time and an age
[48:49] where our lives can be so
[48:51] saturated moment to moment in a time
[48:53] when it seemingly the task that we
[48:55] otherwise would be accomplishing and
[48:59] doing we no longer have to do but we
[49:01] found other ways to make ourselves busy
[49:02] and create other
[49:04] problems and it's drawing us away from
[49:07] his presence it draws us away from
[49:10] welcoming and receiving the
[49:13] word so that we can have deity in our
[49:16] midst and that's why you asked the
[49:18] question I wonder if we are sufficiently
[49:20] impress
[49:21] impressed I'm going to say it this way
[49:23] with his presence
[49:27] go and study the message of the hour
[49:28] when he preaches the seals and how much
[49:30] he talks about the seventh seal being a
[49:31] great secret great secret a great
[49:33] secret find where he talked about the
[49:35] seventh seal the third pull and even
[49:37] these Visions as being a secret not a
[49:39] public
[49:41] show and how careful he remained in
[49:44] being true to that don't explain it too
[49:49] much this
[49:51] secret this great secret brothers you
[49:54] could come to your instruments here in
[49:55] the sermon Christ is mystery God
[49:57] revealed I could literally read an
[49:59] hour's worth of
[50:01] statements from the message Christ is
[50:04] the mystery of God
[50:05] revealed just bouncing through it even
[50:08] just on this theme but this is such a
[50:10] familiar theme to you I just want to
[50:12] read it it's a little bit lengthy but it
[50:13] says what was once God's Great secret
[50:17] great mysterious Secret in his mind is
[50:19] now put in the hearts of the believer
[50:21] the body of
[50:22] Christ think of this secret now we're
[50:25] talking about the gift of Christ
[50:26] Christ's
[50:28] presence and this gift of Christ's
[50:30] presence it's from the bosom of God into
[50:32] your bosom into your heart the very Mind
[50:35] Of God into your heart and there's not a
[50:37] lot of witnesses sitt there going whoa
[50:39] whoa look at that what just happened
[50:41] right they all can just see it God just
[50:43] took something took his hand out from
[50:44] his bosom and deposited something into
[50:47] that sister's heart and everyone's
[50:48] talking about it these things are secret
[50:52] God's Great secret that was in his mind
[50:54] is in the hearts of the believer what
[50:55] was God's once great Secret in his mind
[50:57] before the foundation world is now made
[50:59] manifest great secret great secret think
[51:01] of it oh my I'm sure we don't we don't
[51:04] get it well I can't see it the way ought
[51:07] to and I'm sure you don't and I say
[51:10] Amen but God's great mystery what the
[51:13] Eternal God had as a mystery has now
[51:15] been unfolded in Jesus Christ then given
[51:18] right down to his church what was once
[51:20] in God's mind is now in the body of
[51:22] Christ Jesus making love to the church
[51:26] his bride Whispering secrets to
[51:29] her in the secret place of the
[51:32] stairs that's not a public show in a
[51:35] private place I want to see your face I
[51:37] want to hear your
[51:38] voice I want to whisper secrets to
[51:42] you and this is quite a statement making
[51:45] love to the
[51:46] church might have some devotion material
[51:48] there for the families going forward he
[51:51] says you know how you tell your wife
[51:52] things you know the little girl you're
[51:53] going to marry you love her so much you
[51:55] tell just tell the secrets and get her
[51:56] up next to you and you love her and
[51:58] everything you know how it is I think he
[52:00] clarifies this very specifically about
[52:01] your wife he says that's what Christ is
[52:04] doing to the church he's letting her
[52:06] know the secrets just the secrets not
[52:08] these flirters I mean his
[52:13] wife by having the revelation of his
[52:16] secret made known to them by his
[52:21] grace a gift that's manifesting the
[52:24] presence of God those are my words a
[52:28] gift that's revealing the
[52:31] secret how the grace of God and then
[52:33] just to know this statement here just
[52:35] reinforces what brother bram's trying to
[52:38] express that bedroom that private place
[52:41] the most holy place he says how the
[52:43] grace of God I hope you don't think this
[52:44] sounds personal to a bunch of people or
[52:47] this that but the secret that God is
[52:49] sharing with the whole church if they
[52:51] would just receive it in a crowd I hope
[52:53] I'm not just being too plain he said I
[52:55] hope this doesn't sound personal to so
[52:57] many people but God is now Whispering
[53:00] love secrets to his
[53:02] [Music]
[53:04] bride that's the day and age we're
[53:06] living
[53:07] in that's your that's your strength to
[53:10] Fly Above leod
[53:12] deia that's the joy you need in the face
[53:15] of so much
[53:16] Melancholy it's the power of God you
[53:18] need in the face of so much sickness and
[53:21] depravity this world's absolutely
[53:24] insane I sometimes wonder if my thinks
[53:26] I'm going crazy because we talk about
[53:28] political events and things that are
[53:30] happening and I just engage in it from a
[53:31] political perspective and kind of engage
[53:33] in an intellectual Academic Way and it's
[53:35] kind of like there's no way in the world
[53:36] you could justify killing somebody I'm
[53:38] like oh well that's not what I'm doing
[53:40] you I'm just kind of getting in the mind
[53:41] of it from a legal standpoint and
[53:43] intellectual standpoint but we just need
[53:45] to take a step back say this world's
[53:46] insane right absolutely
[53:49] insane if very could well could be
[53:52] somebody named after a Mario Brother's
[53:53] character could change the Health Care
[53:55] system
[53:57] by murdering the CEO like that was wrong
[53:59] you shouldn't do this the world's insane
[54:02] they've gone absolutely insane there's
[54:04] no peace anymore my sister Elizabeth and
[54:06] I were fellowshipping on how there there
[54:08] there's a there's sometimes there's a
[54:10] really clear minded thinking for some
[54:13] people in the world as they take a step
[54:15] back and recognize the dangers of social
[54:17] media the the the debilitating
[54:21] corrupting nature and power of
[54:23] pornography and how life is becoming
[54:26] such degraded and unreal and people are
[54:30] acting upon the impulses and influences
[54:32] of a mob and it's taken away their
[54:34] agency where now we're just all being
[54:36] driven around like dumb cattle and they
[54:40] recognize and it seems so clear-minded
[54:42] but then their solution is to 3D print a
[54:45] gun and put a bullet in somebody's head
[54:47] it's like well that's just as
[54:49] insane you're you're you're part of the
[54:51] mob you're you're part of the mind
[54:52] you're you're succumb to it because
[54:54] there's no sanctuary in Christ
[54:56] to look at all go oh my goodness the
[54:58] horrors of social media what's my boy
[55:00] going to do as he keeps growing what
[55:02] what's going to happen to my daughter
[55:03] how what's our excape I'm so glad to
[55:05] know there's a place I'm so glad to know
[55:08] there's a presence I'm so glad to know
[55:10] that there is a power of Christ in this
[55:12] end time that can clean that can wash
[55:15] that can deliver that can set free where
[55:17] I can lay my hands on a Son of God and
[55:19] say there's liberty from pornography
[55:22] there's liberty from sickness there's
[55:23] liberty from these addictions
[55:26] and know that it's
[55:30] real and in the sermon God's gifts
[55:32] always find their places think of that
[55:34] sermon I think I I think I might have
[55:35] included this slide hope I did because I
[55:38] wanted you to see that title God's gifts
[55:40] always find their
[55:42] places and his presence wants to find
[55:44] its
[55:45] place its rightful place in this
[55:48] hour and he says may the great Christmas
[55:51] gift the great Christmas present rather
[55:54] Christmas present
[55:56] the first and the only and original and
[55:59] the only one there is Jesus Christ be a
[56:02] fresh in your heart tonight it's what I
[56:04] want I want to be fresh something about
[56:07] life that just you just begin to feel a
[56:10] heaviness fellowship with brother
[56:11] Matthew
[56:12] Watkins earlier this week and there like
[56:15] we we find ourselves sometimes just
[56:16] thinking oh whatever whenever this
[56:18] happens right be the reset the freshness
[56:21] will come and that's when things will
[56:23] change and once you get there it's
[56:24] something else
[56:26] and it's always wow if I could just fix
[56:28] this if I could just do that if I could
[56:30] just move if I could just pay this off I
[56:31] could just that then then we'll kind of
[56:33] get around the corner and I feel like I
[56:34] live my life from one hump to the next
[56:38] to it's like ah if I can just get over
[56:39] that one and you get over it and it's
[56:41] like okay well there's another one
[56:44] coming but if I could just have him be
[56:52] aesh I've been thinking a lot about
[56:54] Christmas dinner
[56:56] [Music]
[57:00] I'm cooking the prime
[57:02] rib in the sense that in this hour we've
[57:06] been invited to a feast remember the
[57:08] statement right there full Square Mill
[57:10] it's all seven courses for all seven
[57:11] seals are
[57:12] open we are feasting on the unfailing
[57:15] body word of the son of man the fresh
[57:17] kill and we begin to find over and over
[57:20] again where it speaks of his presence it
[57:22] talks about where the carcass is there
[57:23] will the Eagles be gathered I will come
[57:26] in and suck I will dine I will commune
[57:28] this is an hour where it's fresh that's
[57:30] what the believer wants he wants it
[57:32] fresh I pray the same prayer that
[57:33] brother bradam prayed here in God's
[57:35] gifts always always find their places
[57:37] May the gift of Christ's presence be a
[57:39] fresh in your heart tonight may the
[57:41] great Christmas present or the Christmas
[57:45] presents the first and only original one
[57:47] there is on that day when that baby was
[57:49] born of a virgin Jesus Christ may he be
[57:53] fresh to us tonight let's stand and pray
[57:57] together let's pray this prayer Lord May
[58:00] the the Christmas present Jesus Christ
[58:04] be a fresh in our heart
[58:05] tonight if there was a voice in this
[58:08] hour that declared to us a secret of God
[58:12] then Lord I want to I I want to
[58:15] identify that place I want it to find
[58:18] its place in my
[58:20] life and I I go so far as to say this as
[58:23] we've already been touching all around
[58:25] this this gift that has manifested the
[58:28] presence of God you become a gift of his
[58:33] presence as you welcome and receive the
[58:36] word let's pray Heavenly Father tonight
[58:38] as we have brought forth this word and
[58:41] shared these things and
[58:43] there's an intensity behind
[58:48] it Lord there's things
[58:51] that were read in the scripture and
[58:54] events referenced in
[58:57] history recent
[59:00] history and that pertain to brother
[59:03] brandham and statements that he
[59:07] made that I believe we
[59:11] must be confident in
[59:15] sharing so that the
[59:18] hearer can
[59:20] be accosted even if it is a
[59:24] confrontation with the
[59:28] word because you spoke of how there
[59:30] would
[59:32] be a voice to
[59:35] attract and to call
[59:39] out and your presence beckons us it
[59:42] calls to
[59:44] us there's a come away my
[59:47] [Music]
[59:49] love Lord even as
[59:52] the song was sung recently I believe
[59:54] even here quiet me let let Peaceful
[59:56] Waters
[59:58] Flow may I learn to be
[1:00:01] still I want to hear you and feel you
[1:00:04] Drawing Near I want to see your face I
[1:00:06] want to hear your
[1:00:08] voice and help us Lord in the business
[1:00:10] of this life through our hurts our
[1:00:12] complexes our scars Lord I know that
[1:00:15] there's things preached
[1:00:16] and I that can cause us even to begin to
[1:00:20] hold our
[1:00:21] breath and just seize up because it's
[1:00:26] it's getting so near to things that
[1:00:27] maybe we've been told are wrong or we've
[1:00:29] seen it misused and abused and we just
[1:00:31] begin to tense up and we're worried and
[1:00:33] we're anxious I say oh God may we just
[1:00:37] trust that your spirit will lead us and
[1:00:40] guide us that you'll bring the balance
[1:00:42] you'll you'll make things
[1:00:43] clear that Lord if a man of God wants to
[1:00:46] put a period on it father you've taught
[1:00:48] me well enough as a Believer to just
[1:00:50] leave the comma and walk in the light
[1:00:52] and watch more unfold not try to
[1:00:54] interpret it myself but believe the word
[1:00:56] of God say Amen to it and pray for
[1:01:00] Revelation and so Lord is there so much
[1:01:03] that might cause us to be anxious and
[1:01:04] bound up it could very well be keeping
[1:01:07] us from a deeper walk with you so father
[1:01:11] we pray as David prayed show me your
[1:01:13] face let me see you in your word May the
[1:01:16] Bible continue to become a new book to
[1:01:18] me that when I read the letters when I
[1:01:20] read the chapters when I read the verses
[1:01:22] you could speak to me in a present tense
[1:01:24] voice that when I I listen to the
[1:01:26] message of the hour Lord I'm able to get
[1:01:28] past all the scarecrows that have said
[1:01:30] it's just neuroticism I can get past all
[1:01:32] the scarecrows that have made it bromism
[1:01:34] I can get past all the scoffers and
[1:01:36] mockers and I can recognize that you are
[1:01:39] revealing yourself back to you your
[1:01:42] personal presence in your bride for a
[1:01:45] Rapture in the Rapture age in the bride
[1:01:49] age and yes it's a secret because father
[1:01:52] we can't go to a convention at some
[1:01:54] address and find this presence just
[1:01:56] because it's in that building we can't
[1:01:58] just go to some headquarters and believe
[1:02:00] we're in it we can't just identify
[1:02:01] ourselves with some church or shake
[1:02:03] shake a preacher's hand there must be a
[1:02:05] personal revelation of you to ourselves
[1:02:07] individually and we must come into Union
[1:02:10] with
[1:02:11] you oh God help
[1:02:13] us in this L deyan age in this this this
[1:02:18] way that will please you and be an
[1:02:21] accurate reflection of your presence
[1:02:22] father help us to
[1:02:24] overcome Lord of having many
[1:02:26] conversations in my family and with
[1:02:28] other brothers how do we appropriately
[1:02:31] apply a standard in our home when years
[1:02:33] ago it just would have been as easy as
[1:02:35] keeping something out but now Lord we we
[1:02:37] have the state paying for iPads and Mac
[1:02:40] computers and screens and all sorts of
[1:02:42] things that we could use not just for
[1:02:43] school but for all sorts of
[1:02:48] things and Lord just playing house or
[1:02:52] digging a hole and building castles in a
[1:02:53] sandbox Lord those things just don't
[1:02:56] seem to work anymore for children and so
[1:02:57] there's just always so so many things
[1:02:59] that just invite connection points to
[1:03:02] the world and father we need to know we
[1:03:04] need to know how to lead our children to
[1:03:06] protect our
[1:03:07] hearts so we can do it in a way that our
[1:03:10] lives become a
[1:03:13] signal to others who are raising
[1:03:15] kids who need to find a way hungry
[1:03:19] Hearts who are hurting the last seed
[1:03:21] that's
[1:03:22] living in 2025 in this coming year
[1:03:27] not looking for an agrarian cult who's
[1:03:30] moved off the grid and no longer uses
[1:03:32] electricity and surviving so after
[1:03:35] solely off off a bee pollen or something
[1:03:37] and that's going to be a voice Lord we
[1:03:39] got to have a way to live it in Leo DEA
[1:03:42] that others would see the beauty of this
[1:03:44] masterpiece and long to know the creator
[1:03:47] of it so help us to give the right
[1:03:49] expression to it
[1:03:52] father pray we pray for each one I pray
[1:03:55] that that I ask tonight Lord that this
[1:03:57] church would pray more for
[1:03:59] me my
[1:04:03] family and Lord give us a Grace now in
[1:04:06] light of these truths in light of these
[1:04:08] things give us a Grace to know you to
[1:04:09] hear your voice to recognize modern
[1:04:12] events made clear by prophecy our day in
[1:04:14] its message what is the attraction on
[1:04:16] the mount who is this mzc it is the
[1:04:19] rising of the
[1:04:22] sun we love you and we ask all this in
[1:04:25] the name of the Lord Lord Jesus Christ
[1:04:27] amen
