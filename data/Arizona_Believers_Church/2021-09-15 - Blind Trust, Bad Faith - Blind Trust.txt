TRANSCRIPT
========================================
john chapter 20. have you john chapter 20 i want to read verses 24 to 21 my title if you want to kind of let this soak in a little bit my title is blind trust bad faith and it's uh something that's been very a huge burden on my heart for some time and it's some of these elements i think have been bleeding over a little bit into our series on advocacy but this is just tonight going to be a big it's kind of a start to the subject matter so it's kind of just me beginning by getting some things out once i kind of get it out i feel like i can start and go any different direction so this is the hardest usually the hardest service and i want to make this comment in the outset before we begin to read our text that this blind blind trust bad faith is relevant in the context of our advocacy and and it relates to us being i think these things will be instructed to us and being truly stepping into that calling of being the final voice to the final age because that that particular function in our lives is to lift up christ alone and and that's going to be coming to a perfect faith and so we don't want to confuse a lot of other things a lot of opinions or ideas for that final voice and for that advocacy so i think this will be very instructive in the context of what we're ministering on uh right now in parallel on our advocacy john chapter 20 verse 24 read to verse 31 but thomas one of the twelve called didymus was not with them when jesus came in this in the prior four or five verses jesus appeared to them and said peace be unto you so it says the other disciples therefore said unto him we have seen the lord but he said unto them except i shall see in his hands the print of the nails and put my finger in the print of the nails and thrust my hand into his side i will not believe and after eight days again his disciples were within and thomas with them then came jesus the door's been shut and stood in the midst and said peace be unto you then saith he to thomas reach hither thy finger and behold my hands and reach hither thy hand and thrust it into my side and be not faithless but believing and thomas answered and said unto him my lord and my god jesus said unto him thomas because thou has seen me thou hast believed blessed are they that have not seen and yet have believed and many other signs truly did jesus in the presence of his disciples which are not written in this book but these are written that you might believe that jesus is the christ the son of god and that believing you might have life through his name god bless you you could take your seats i know the the title may seem to have a lot of weight and significance to it i i ponder it quite deeply in terms of just exactly how to title it so it may hold some uh presence in your mind and you'd be easy to remember but blind trust bad faith being the title and i used uh what would be kind of a braille print there for blind trust i don't know if you can really read it and then a bad font for a bad faith and uh and i i really want you maybe just to start to really ponder those two particular elements and i think they might already be obvious to to you uh maybe some of the emphasis that i'd like to share and i'll take some time to kind of define these terms as initially they strike me and i think initially we ought to consider them but i like to say this and the outset that this blind trust and bad faith are really prevalent conditions of laodicea and we could look into revelations chapter 3 and even begin to identify in the condition of the age how that a blind trust a blindness is characteristic of the age and then even a declaration or an attitude that would be in bad faith and so these are things that we are constantly warring against it's so prevalent in the world today just to kind of have a blind trust in things it's very prevalent in the world today to act in bad faith so it's very hard to just trust people and it's very hard in some respects um to be to control yourself and not give yourself over to certain ideas and opinions blindly and so i just want to take some time in the beginning this will kind of help uh me get comfortable and and i trust that you can just be comfortable yourselves and encourage me and help me along here i don't think you have any reason to be nervous and say i'll save my amen for the end i think you can just relax and the lord will bless you but blind trust if we take that as a phrase in just a term and we want to define it it's trust without any reason or evidence so if you have blind trust you trust in something or some someone without any real reason to do so or without any evidence and so blind trust can also be explained as being trust or belief without understanding or perception so you if you have kind of a blind trust in something then you don't really have to have any reason to believe it you can just believe it and you can declare that you're very adamant about it and convinced about it without having understanding or even any kind of perception and we could kind of take from this the idea of a leap of faith we say i'm just going to take a leap of faith what we're really declaring is that we're jumping into something without really knowing what we're getting ourselves into or really knowing what awaits or whether or not this is even going to work so it's we call it a leap of faith and in that way it's kind of we're blindly jumping into something and i hope you can tell already just with these terminologies we might start thinking hmm that's interesting i hadn't quite thought about it that way so but blind trust would be trust without evidence trust without reason and then bad faith it would be to refu the refusal to acknowledge or address certain facts or truths so there would be and i try to think just in a way to really um explain this because there's a there's a concept in law to where you can actually sue your insur insurance company the one that insures you for acting in bad faith and that means where they may not be willing to stand by a particular term or they mislead you or they deny the coverage of a claim that really in reality they said they would cover and so they have a duty to act in good faith towards you and there's a cause of action that would actually be a bad faith they're dealing with you in bad faith and so to do so they're even they may refuse to acknowledge certain facts or acknowledge that they made the promise acknowledge that your situation applies or they're not willing to address certain truths or facts and in that way if someone is will not willing to acknowledge well that is true or not willing to address certain things there could be a lack of honesty on their part where they're intentionally deceptive they're intentionally not acknowledging things they're intentionally not addressing a certain truth or it could be a matter of self-deception where they themselves have are deceived in the matter and being deceived they they act in bad faith the example of this and this might be the best explanation that i could have for what is striking me in terms of saying blind trust bad faith is if as an argument in bad faith when you make an argument in bad faith you have a hidden motive behind your argument that's not stated that you're trying to convince somebody to do something and you're using reasons for doing it but yet you have a different motive than what stated and to argue in bad faith but to have an undisclosed agenda and so often times when you're making an argument in bad faith you want to accomplish something so you use reasons that are unstated and you use these you have a reason behind in your heart like i want them to do this and the reason why i want them to do this is because i'm going to benefit from it and so you try to convince someone to do it and you give them different reasons but you never disclose the true reason for doing it that's an argument and bad faith and they find that when people argue in bad faith they typically resort to intimidation to get you to do what they want you to do because they have not fully disclosed their motive in doing it and oftentimes they feel that this agenda or this thing that they're wanting to accomplish if you knew about it you wouldn't want to do it so it kind of ratchets up the intensity a little bit maybe the rhetoric so they use coercion and they use intimidation try to try to get you to do something and these are dynamics that if you can begin to recognize them in personal relationships you realize wait a minute this is this is not a this is not a conversation i need to engage myself in because there's some arguing there's some argument being taken place in bad faith that's not you're not being honest you're not willing to address certain things and to really look at at the the full story or to acknowledge really what's behind your asking and what you're trying to accomplish just just some things to kind of set the stage for what those terms are we'll take more time in the future to lay them out in different ways but i come across a statement one time by richard dawkins if anybody's ever heard that name before i don't mind if you cringe a little bit but he made this statement in one of his books i believe it was the selfish gene which actually is probably pretty relevant uh title where he refers to religious faith as blind trust he says religious faith is blind trust in the absence of evidence so he's saying that to have faith religious faith his blind trust in the absence of evidence and then he aggravates it even in the teeth of evidence so he's saying that religious faith has no evidence and as a matter of fact religious faith exists in with contrary evidence in the teeth of evidence against it and this is it's i use this statement because it's actually very convenient and i could kind of cherry-pick to find one that really suited my purpose but this is deliberately deceptive on his part he's this is an intelligent man and you think that being intelligent and writing to the links that he does about the god delusion and and there not being a god and religion a lot of the arguments that he sets forth uh that maybe he would use a less deceptive argument this is deliberately deceptive because he construed the definition of religion to fit his own agenda clearly he has an agenda clearly he's going to try to drive home in champion science and the scientific method and things that he could actually test after he's hypothesized about it and so in doing so when he takes this and says defines religion is blind trust he's acting in bad faith because in reality you couldn't find really anyone in religion who would define their faith as blind trust so richard dawkins has not only made an argument in bad faith but he's provided a very convenient definition for religion as actually being characterized into some people they may view it as being blind trust and so with just some of these terminologies we're just sharing that kind of just gets me started this is me just kind of priming the prime and the starters so that we can get going my burden in examining the subject as we've pondered it now for quite some time is that our our faith could be completely liberated there's things that kind of attach themselves to our faith and there's these kind of peripheral things that our faith relates to and there's a lot of different things that kind of seem to be a part of it or um in the circle or in view or things that we associate with faith that we can't quite seem to resolve or understand and so there's a way that our faith isn't completely pure and we wrestle with that we're trying to figure it out we're trying to just exactly understand what our faith is and where it fits but in liberty in our faith it ought to be free from tradition and there's a lot of things that are just tradition there's a lot of ideas and there's a lot of claims that we might make in our mind and we make it a part of our faith but in reality it's not really our faith it's other things that have kind of attached itself to it and so we want to free our faith of tradition but also free it of human devices these are thought processes that we have um anecdotal things that have taken place many different things that might begin to form our version of faith but in reality if our faith is free then once it's liberated from our own ideas and our own opinions and different traditions and things then once it's loosed it can be directed to the one thing where it's ineffective and that's the word alone and so maybe if i could say this my desire and my burden and approach in this subject is to really loose our faith to free our faith and then take our faith once it's liberated this this freed faith and direct it to the word alone so that we know what we're standing on if you'll turn in first timothy chapter 3 verse 9 i'd like to take a statement from that we've used this here recently and talking about a clean conscience and i want to identify want to take this phrase here where paul is instructing timothy and talking about the qualifications of deacons and he says holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience in this pure conscience um there's we could amplify that even further beyond what we already have but this is paul as he says that his conscience was clear as with god and man holding nothing against man nothing against god that a deacon ought to hold the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience and this word holding there the word that paul uses it speaks of apprehending something and even uh speaks of understanding so there's it's not just that we would have the rules of the church written on a book and you would hold it and squeeze on it and be able to say that you have it you've downloaded it you've printed it out but it speaks something to the deacon's understanding of the word of god and understanding of truth so he says holding the mystery of the faith now this is something very very beautiful when you think about this holding the mystery this is a hidden thing this is a secret holding the mystery something secret something hidden of the faith and i want that phrase to be a very prominent in our minds tonight because as i think of blind trust bad faith tonight one of my primary emphasis is there's only one faith there's only one trust there's only one truth and so in blind trust bad faith i want to in the outset just begin to zero in on the fact that scripturally there is one faith and so when paul says holding the mystery the hidden thing or the secret of the faith the faith is an assurance epistas the greek word that's used here it's belief or conviction it speaks of trust and so we use the word faith and it means something very particular to us but it's a it's a very full word it's a very deep word it's a very robust word it speaks of assurance and conviction and trust and belief so it says holding the mystery of that faith and if you think about it what paul is saying is that you have the faith but then there's a mystery of that faith there's a trust of that faith there's an assurance there's a belief there's a conviction of that faith and and i'd like to say it this way and you've given me some a long runway maybe to to cover these things but christ is the mystery of the faith even in terms of how paul would express this to a jew even in the way that the gospel would come to the gentiles and say here's this judaic tradition and this belief of a messiah coming and there's one true god and his in the principles of redemption then this was a faith this was a belief this was an assurance then when christ comes he was the hidden mystery of that faith all along and now he's presently declared to the people and he's made known to them and they ought to receive him and they ought to accept him and so then even going forward they could use this language that the mystery of the faith is held within christ and paul even talks about we speak the hidden wisdom of god in a mystery and he's talking about jesus christ because if the princes of this world known it they would not have crucified the lord of glory so he is the truth christ is the truth that was once hidden but is now revealed so christ is the mystery of the faith so this person and we all ought to have this testimony that we hold the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience we hold there's something we're holding that is still yet mysterious but we're holding to it we've apprehended it we've understood it and this is christ who is the mystery of the faith and it still retains christ still retains the mystery christ is the mystery of god revealed there's still it still retains that element of mystery because to the common man or to the carnal man the natural man he still remains mysterious because you can only know him by the spirit you can only know him if he is revealed so the the christ can be fully revealed to brother loyal but it doesn't in the revelation to brother loyal doesn't make him unmysterious to everyone else he still remains a mystery because truth can be disclosed to one and it still is yet a mystery of the kingdom because to others it is not given to know the mysteries and paul says in ephesians chapter 4 verse 5 there's one lord one faith one baptism we believe in the in one lord there is one faith one baptism one baptism would have a lot more significance to a jew who had many different ceremonial baptisms but this one is saying there's one lord one faith one baptism this one faith is one truth that means there is one trust one faith one truth one trust when it comes to a christian's faith and this faith as paul says holding the mystery of the faith him declaring that there is one faith we could use a dozen other scriptures tonight but i want to be able to just take a step back and approach it from a different perspective we could use the present truth and the gospel a lot of different terms that we could share scripturally but using these scriptures of the mystery of the faith i want to say this this faith that paul is talking about is not blind but it is based upon god's revelation of himself to you this this ought to be the genesis of our faith this ought to be something that we can declare uh uh with certainty as a christian is that uh well so what are you are you a christian say yes i'm a christian oh well where do you go to church and say why i go to this church well why do you go to church there and say well that's just this is what we believe and and i was raised in this church and my dad was this or my mom was that and it's like well my mom was catholic and my dad was baptist and we went to a catholic school and then i when i got married i married a catholic so we've decided to raise our children as catholics so this is what we believe and you'll find that kind of in that narrative there's no point at which someone says i believe this because god has made himself known to me personally and that forms the basis for their conviction and for their faith and let me say that we all ought to have that kind of conviction to say this is what i believe because god has revealed himself to me individually to me personally and i will also say this and try and want to substantiate this through scripture is god has never asked us just to believe him blindly god has not asked us to engage in wishful thinking um god has not just asked us to kind of hold on to a hope so attitude and that's what that's what blind blind trust essentially will give you is wishful thinking or kind of a hope so and we're taught that there is a human hope that is an enemy to faith because it's not rooted in any kind of conviction it's not rooted in any kind of knowledge or revelation to where we have this knowledge that's what i'm basing this upon is knowledge i'm not just basing it on something that was told to me i'm not just basing it on the preponderance of the evidence i'm not just basting on well with beyond a reasonable doubt this is something that has been revealed to me and so god does not does not require faith to be blind but rather he is going to give us the evidence and the conviction that we need to believe him so if we can turn to john chapter 20 and we're going to again read verses 24 to 31 in my studying on this subject i came across a number of instances where this particular scripture is used to kind of define faith or it's used as a kind of a defense or declaration that uh thomas was the doubting thomas and just think about how it's presented to us and i've been considering this in in a lot of different degrees in a lot of different ways and we have to be very careful there's a way that we could present something uh because we're trying to accomplish something so we present something with a lot of intensity but we don't take take a step back and think about what does that mean for somebody else or what's what's the fallout for that i think i think the way brother lucas would try to describe it as layers of complexity and he goes to the fourth fifth sixth and seventh layer of complexity and so there's a way that you look at something you're saying well okay well it means that on this level but have you thought about the next level you thought about the ramifications if that's the truth then what does it mean about this truth and so there's this idea that some take this well doubting thomas what made him a doubting thomas is he didn't believe jesus christ was risen and and that in his heart he he makes this declaration that says i will believe when i can put my hand this is quite a declaration not just when i see it for myself but he wants to be able to take his finger and stick it in the scars and he was going okay yeah all right thorn print now let me see the side you know he wants to he kind of wants to get his hands on it something he can feel so not even just sight but now touch is going to confirm it to him and there's a way that we kind of cast this out and what do we call doubting thomas right and this is this is a way that we kind of build this we start building this idea in scripture then it's like well we don't want to be like thomas right so we just want to believe if we don't see it we want to believe it if we don't touch it we want to believe it without any kind of evidence and we just want to believe it because someone says so and we kind of really lose the meaning behind we lose a lot of meaning in scripture and we can begin to lose sight of just how much god wants to make himself known to you and just how much god wants to prove and confirm his word and by doing this well i don't i don't need it i don't need it i don't need it and we think that we're really declaring faith but what we're doing is we might be running further from it and entering more into blind trust as opposed to real genuine faith and so let's just read through it but thomas one of the twelve called didymus was not with them when jesus came jesus having come to him and made himself known all prior to mary magdalene and then also to the disciples the door they were assembled together and he comes in he says peace be with you and he speaks to them so there was many who saw him and then were convinced that he had been resurrected they had seen jesus christ thomas is not with him but the disciples say unto him verse 25 we have seen the lord now ponder this dynamic here that it's it's not like thomas is just hanging out at the the coffee bar and he's there just kind of catching up on some work because it's been a real busy week and and just some random person says hey did you hear jesus was here the other day and he has no basis for trust right i don't know this guy i don't know who he is and so you know it's not that he had didn't have any basis to believe but it's the disciples the disciples said to him we have seen the lord but then he says in response except unless i see his hands see in his hands the print of the nails and put my finger in the prince of the nails and thrust my hand into his side i will not believe this is quite the declaration and we can say oh well thomas he's a doubting thomas so we could put him in the position maybe a skeptic and an unbeliever but then what proceeds next to me shows that it that thomas is not entering into this realm of denying jesus christ he's not entering this realm of not believing the prophecies he's not entering into the realm of not believing that he's resurrected but there's a part of him that says i want to see it for myself then he knew that that would bring him to a different level of conviction and faith he says and after eight days again his disciples were within and thomas with them then came jesus and they it says it this way so you can understand the supernatural element of it the door is being shut he just appears in the room comes through the walls as it were and stood in the midst and said notice how beautiful this is peace be unto you same declaration that he'd given earlier but then he says to thomas this is something him being aware and very conscious of instead of him saying but thomas you can leave now because you didn't believe that i was alive or he didn't show up and thomas is like wait what's going on what are you guys why are you guys getting all crazy what's going on huh what and looking around and thomas is the only one that can't see but he speaks to thomas he says reach hither thy finger and behold my hands and now he's given him the opportunity to do the very thing that thomas really desired to do reach hither thy hand and thrust it into my side and be not faithless but believing it's remarkable that even if thomas is called the doubting thomas that somehow christ was going to take the extra step to remove his doubt that he wasn't going to leave thomas in this state of well i just don't know i'm not sure but he was going to appear in such a way in the presence of all the disciples and say thomas i'm going to make my appearance to you and allow you to do the thing that you needed in particular to be able to say i believe and thomas answered and said in my lord and my god now jesus's next statement is is very important thomas because thou has seen me thou hast believed and and again this is not said in any way to deter to kind of run down thomas's faith but he's saying you've seen me and because you needed this you've seen me thou has believed it makes a remarkable statement blessed are they that have not seen and yet have believed now could we just take for a moment and recognize that there thomas who has seen and believed and then those who have not seen and what believed so the end result is still the same conviction the same assurance the same faith so it's not that thomas had any less of a faith it's just he he had he had to have a different personal experience in order for him to come to the place of faith but then he's saying blessed are they that have not seen and yet have believed but this is the point and thing to catch thomas that those that have not seen and yet believed are not being asked to believe contrary from witness or testimony because thomas had witness given to him he got he he was given a witness of the resurrection so thomas is not being asked to believe without evidence he's not saying oh well you just should have just assumed it you should have just believed it you should have just accepted it because jesus does not see he's not suggesting here that faith is blind that thomas you should have just believed this blind you should have just had blind trust and accepted it but this is the point where jesus would have said instead of being faithless he was asked to believe that christ was risen based upon the disciples testimony and this would have been no small testimony right it'd be one thing for us to leave tonight and as we're leaving the hotel there's a man that appears to us to be to us in every way homeless and he's saying i'm going to give you a million dollars i'm going to give you i'm going to give you 20 bucks maybe it's more believable i'm going to give you 20 bucks i'm going to join them like you know we wouldn't have any reason really to believe it but if if you're if our parents met us outside the door and said here son i want to give you some money even without the you know the dollar bill hanging out or you know the 20 bill being thrust to us we probably believe oh well i got some cash coming my way because it would be the relationship would kind of provide the context well this isn't out of the ordinary we have a reason to believe this and so these are disciples that he walked with that he journeyed with that knew the prophecies knew the testimonies and that when they began to testify and witness that he was risen in two ways number one he had prophesied that he would so that would have given him a basis upon which to believe i'm telling you these things beforehand so that when they come to pass you will believe so he had the word of the lord that was already made promised him to believe that it happened then also now the disciples who would have been credible to him are also expressing that he is he has risen and but yet he doesn't receive them upon their witness i just want to make the point i don't i feel maybe that i'm belaboring it and making more of it than i ought to but thomas was not being asked to believe without evidence without witness without testimony but thomas this to me is what really blessed me this week when i was looking at it thomas was asked to believe based upon the disciples testimony but he lacked their experience and when i began to look at it through those eyes i felt like it was really wonderful of thomas because this is just how much just how much it meant to him and he's saying that you believe because you've seen and i likewise want to believe by sight and i don't want to take that into the into the realm of well we've got to see it to believe it that's not that's not exactly what i'm expecting is that i am not expressing that in any way but thomas didn't have the same experience the disciples had so the disciples having their experience were able to relay it and thomas being with them similarly situated and having walked with him he wanted to have the same experience they had and once he had the same experience they did then he could declare now that he has risen we're just examining it within the context of john chapter 20. but this whole process we're we're saying jesus isn't saying we shouldn't read this well doubting thomas that we shouldn't be doubting thomas we should just accept it uh without any evidence without any reason we should just blindly trust it there's there's a danger in that when it's not properly oriented when it's not really qualified according to scripture but what john by john writing this this is exactly why john is writing the story thomas didn't believe because he lacked the experience the disciples had and so john is writing to give evidence of the messiah and to give witness of the resurrection so the very next verse is kind of turn on its head this idea that jesus oh doubting thomas you didn't you should have just believed because then he writes in verse 30 and many other signs truly did jesus in the presence of his disciples which are not written in this book so the disciples are receiving this further vindication and witness of the holy ghost that god is with christ and these are the promises and giving them assurance to go forward and then he says but these are written john this is justification for written these are written that you might believe that jesus is the christ the son of god and that believing you might have life through his name do you realize that there was given a written account of the things of christ that in reading the written account of christ we would believe on christ and then through his through that belief and through that faith have life through his name so it's not just some kind of mysterious uh thing that's kind of uh some kind of nebulous idea that we've got to just kind of grab a hold of that's hazy that's in the cloud that's kind of free-floating this kind of free-spirited idea but it's saying i'm setting these things forth and they're being written and we're declaring them that they could provide for you the basis and the evidence to believe that jesus christ was the son of god sent into the world to atone for your sins and that in believing on him you would have eternal life so in that i want you just to catch in a very small way that the faith that is being asked of you here is not without a basis the faith that is spoken of in the new testament is trust that's based on knowing it's a deliberate confidence based on evidence and i i want you just to stay very closely to the idea that i'm i'm wanting to set forth because i'm not venturing into some uh anything that would be contrary to what we're taught wanting to reconsider certain things in certain attitudes and approaches because our faith when we ponder what our faith is i and i'll i'll say this way if you have true genuine faith you must have an anchor of your soul and so you got something that's it's solid footing to you and it's not just something that seems to be missing every time that you really need it so i'm this is a challenge that you as a person come to a place where you're not on sinking sin it's not shifty and you can believe this one day and believe that the next and somebody could share this opinion and you get caught up in this one then share it someone share another one or you can hear all sorts of ideas and opinions and stories and religions and doctrines or whatever it might be and you're always like hmm well i wonder well i wonder you want to have this genuine solid footing as a christian and as a believer to know that what i believe and what i am convinced of has been disclosed to me and and it's real this is a real knowledge this is a real truth and so our faith is a trust and commitment in what we have reason to believe is truth again it's not without reason now to the world it may be unreasonable and the world may not accept your reasons so i'm not saying this is beyond the this is to the point to where it's irrefutable to the world but you as a christian you have a trust and a commitment that you have reason to believe in right let me ask you this why do why do you believe that god's a healer now on one hand we could say well we believe it because i guess the bible says it but be honest you know you know someone who's been healed you yourself have experienced healing so god on one level he says by your stripes by his stripes i am healed and we believe in divine healing but then when you look at the practical application of the scripture that god then what does he do he confirms his word and he heals and so we're not in a world today with with all these promises in the bible and we believe the bible and then when we say well okay we believe it and then it's apart from vindication or apart from proof and so our faith isn't this blind faith to where we're just kind of saying well god said it and i believe it but we ought to have this understanding that what we believe god will gladly confirm what we begin the reason why we can accept it the reason why we can believe it is there's some basis for that otherwise i would suggest that today if you do not have that kind of conviction in your heart what you believe to be the truth today uh you could be um there's a statement coming into my mind right now that i want to share here in just a second that what you believe to be the truth today you may be you may be able to be convinced of a different truth the next you could be in islam today you could be a christian tomorrow you could be a hindu the next because you you don't have your bait you don't have a basis and a reason for believing it and and there's a statement that had come to my mind how that anyone who is convinced against their will hasn't really had a change of mind and so this a conversion a real faith is not just a a convincing to where there isn't a death to will and a death to self i'm really speaking of an experience that is a tie post and i believe that we've had that and having that let's not let's not lose sight of it because as we continue in our journey of faith there's a way that we begin to i want to use the term meander but that might suggest we're in the wrong path but in the attrition of the stand for christ and the longevity of our our walk with god sometimes i think we can get we can get so far down the road that we're looking at all these other things that are happening and we're kind of forgetting the trail that leads back to the word of god and that we believe because god has this is that because we have reason to believe now ultimately our faith is based upon the word that's ultimately that's what it's based based upon and god is in his word i want you to think about this thought process well we believe the word it's the word alone word only we believe the word and i and i uh and i'm a strong proponent of the word only we believe his word and we say that that's what my faith is based upon my faith is based upon the word alone now god is in his word so it is not that we're just believing in something that god is not in something ancillary or something separate from god but god is in his word and then this is the other part we have to catch god confirms his word so if god if we believe his word and god is in his word then god confirms his word and and if i can say this god would be happy to vindicate it to you so i i realize i'm i'm laying some things out maybe not not seemingly going very deep but i'm i'm wanting just to provoke some thinking on your part tonight just get you to think some of some of these things in john chapter 1 verses 43 to 50. it says the day following jesus the day following jesus would go forth into galilee and findeth philip and saith unto him follow me now philip was of bethsaida the city of andrew and peter so then philip has been called to follow and i realize now at this point even as he says that speaking of andrew and peter and these different ones sometimes we look at their experience and we almost get this feeling that just philip is you know philip is standing there one day and just some random guy says you know come on let's go there's more supernatural taking place even when it comes to peter and andrew who are these disciples of john and they have this discipleship and they're following john and then they have these different instances of vindication and and they're pointed to jesus christ and christ is confirmed in his presence and revealing himself but there is this there's something that's captured in the heart of philip and philip he says come follow me so then philip findeth nathanael and saith unto him we have found him now notice the basis of philip's witness who moses in the law and the prophets did right so he has reason he's not just saying hey we found the you know the cookie monster and we ought to follow the cookie monster and the jew would be like cookie monster i mean who's the cookie monster why should we follow the cookie monster so he's not suggesting just some random character just some crazy guy you know hey this is i want you to meet frank and frank believes that there's an alien ship that's going to come back and take us all out of here so if you could just put on your adidas set a and drink the kool-aid you know there's gonna be an alien ship take us out of here one day that's not what he's proposing he has basis moses and the law and the prophets did right he says jesus the son of joseph now nathanael says unto him can there any good thing come out of nazareth so there's a little bit of skepticism philip saith unto him come and see again i i see this as philip saying you know what it's best that you just meet him yourself and jesus jesus saw nathanael coming to him and said behold an israelite indeed in whom is no guile and this strikes nathanael this catches his attention and he says whence knowest thou me jesus answered and said in him before that philip called thee when thou wasted under the fig tree i saw thee what a beautiful statement before you were even called and then he makes some reference to him this would be something that would have been significant to phil to to nathaniel something that he could recall when you were under the fig tree i saw thee now what could we say this clearly is this is an intent attention getter so it is though we might say that jesus just comes by and says hey follow me he said well what reason would i have to follow you christ is going to do something he wants to make himself known reveal himself to you in a special way to where you know that's god that's supernatural that's beyond just some sage that's just beyond someone who's intelligent tell that that's beyond just wisdom of man that's better that's more than just a good debate style that that's more than just being able to to um parse a part in our you know parse an argument and put everything in place and kind of make a convincing truth you know when something can strike you in such a simple way where you know that's god and this is a situation where god had a way of getting nathanael's attention and so his response was rabbi thou art the son of god thou art the king of israel and let me ask you this was that faith it's faith was it without reason no he had reason to believe now it doesn't mean there has to be reason enough to satisfy this person satisfy that person or convince richard dawkins but listen this is something that nathaniel could say i believe by this evidence what's been shown in me the sign that's been given to me i believe that thou art the son of god thou art the king of israel and so jesus answered and said unto him very important a passage here because i said unto thee i saw thee under the fig tree believeth thou notice that just because i said gave you this sign said something that would get your attention something personal it's maybe some circumstance that to him was profound so it says before you were under that fig tree before philip talked to you when you're under that victory i saw you and i knew you he says and because i said that you believe and the answer would have been yes i mean it's a rhetorical question because nathaniel's like yep i believe you're the son of god i believe that you're the king of israel that's all it took was was this this kind of this kind of un disclosing to me this kind of knowledge that gives me reason because of what he had seen what he had known what he had been taught it was what he needed to hear and then jesus makes this beautiful statement thou shalt see greater things than these what i'd like to point out is that we could say that this is a tremendous amount of faith on nathanael's part to say to be told i saw you under the fig tree and then phil be like i believe and and we could have been left with this all right good let's go forward and that that would be that would be the ultimate of faith is just to take god at this single sentence and this discernment this declaration into his heart that would somehow it's going to move nathanael along to to go all the way on to the baptism of the holy ghost from the day of pentecost but jesus goes on to say because you've believed that you'll see greater things than these th it shows us that there's a sign there could be a sign and something that gets our attention in something that can convict our hearts and begin to disclose to us that this is supernatural this is something of god but he's not just going to leave you in that state we're always just trying to hold on to something long time ago he said if that's genuine faith if that's genuine trust and conviction and assurance since this knowledge has been disclosed to you and you have you are believing with reason you're going to see greater things than just that and can that not be descriptive of the christian walk that we've had as believers is that because we truly had faith in the infancy in the beginning and in the innocency it's disclosed to us and we believe for what may be a very small reason to the world since that time we have seen greater things and our faith now is insurmountable not because we're holding on to the shred of some ghost of something in the way past but it's because god has shown us greater things and we believe because we have reason to believe the bible says in john 8 32 and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free scripture that's quoted quite often it's been quoted quite often just in the short time that we've had a church here you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free it says you shall know the truth i merely believe in a truth or believe that this is the truth but it says that you shall know the truth and it is in knowing the truth that the truth is effective you can believe i believe that is the truth and i believe that there is a truth or i believe that there is a god he's just not quite sure what his nature is or what his attitude is and that's not going to bring you to liberty but to know the truth and end that truth by the knowledge of the truth it's the truth itself that makes you free faith cannot be separated from the knowledge of the truth as pondering today may be different applications of this to help you understand but faith cannot be separated from the knowledge of the truth you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free we cannot take our faith and try to carve it out and define it as being something that always languages in the unknown that faith is just kind of always and we're always making excuses for right we're always trying to justify well it just kind of languishes there and this in this space that's cloudy and hazy and you just don't know you're not sure that's not really true faith isn't faith burly i mean aren't we told it has hair on its chest i mean that's that's there's something to faith it's called an evidence and a substance and you say well faith is the evidence of things hoped for now when we take that scripture faith is the evidence of things uh as a substance of things hoped for the hope is based in scripture it's not that i i hope to find a lamborghini next to the the suburban tonight and there's keys that have my name on it or a vanity plate that says for aaron mcgeary i'm like oh i'm open for this i mean faith is the evidence of things hoped for the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen but that's not just something to where we kind of take this and build ourselves into some kind of fervor over something that has no basis even the faith and the evidence that the substance and the evidence that faith stands for still comes back to promises faith is the substance of scriptural promises that we believe in and we're hoping for faith is the evidence of things not seen but yet we've been told they will be it's not that we're just saying oh i've got faith that you know this is going to happen that's going to happen so if you if you think about even the faith that we're instructed to have and the in even how it kind of works in our everyday life we we we have this um concept of just something that is an act of faith right we just do it it's an act of faith and and in that it's almost as if it operates subconsciously and we do it all the time when we go to start our car right and and how is it an act of faith when we put the key in the ignition which i guess we used to do in another decade when we we push the button or we tell alexa start my car however it is we start our car now what is it why is it an act of faith because you expect it to start but why do you expect it to start because it has before because it always does you sit in the car and you push the button the car starts up so you have reason to believe when you push that button it's gonna start it's not going to the junkyard and finding a car that's all hollowed out no windows no tires you haven't checked under the hood and you sit down in the seat and you go watch this what's happening here you but it's your experience that every time you push the button every time you turn the ignition it starts that's an act of faith because you have reason to believe it's based upon experience this is what happens when you do this and for some of us our car doesn't start and we didn't expect it to start why experience doesn't start on mornings like this or i've been having problems with the starter but jesus is telling us that you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free knowledge cannot be separated from faith first timothy chapter 2 verse 4 speaking of the one mediator between god and men who will have all men to be saved and to come unto the knowledge of the truth that he would desire that we would be saved but in salvation it's not just to kind of keep us in this state of it's it's to come to a knowledge of the truth to come to the knowledge of the truth it's something that is known something that's been tested something that's been proven something that's been vindicated this is what god desires us you shall know the truth that our faith would not be separate from the knowledge of the truth and that in knowing the truth truth would make us free and god desires that we would come under the knowledge of the truth in john chapter 16 verses 12 to 15 i have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now how be it when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth notice there's something that is faith is being synonymous with or faith is joined to that you cannot separate it from for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come he's going to guide you in all truth he's going to show you things to come this is this is this is what makes faith stronger and stronger you have reason to believe and then you have more more and more more more more more he shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and shall show it unto you all things that the father hath are mine therefore said i i said i that he shall take of mine and shall show it unto you this is how that we come into the knowledge of all truth is it shown unto us there's something that's disclosed something that's quick and something that we see so that our faith is not based upon hearsay and our faith is not based upon something without reason but that we have a resting place and a solid foundation that i believe and that in believing there is a there is a coming into the knowledge of truth and our faith is based upon the knowledge of something that is real that has been tested and that has been proven i'd like to make this quick example how the old testament scriptures and i had originally planned to go through several of the scriptures i just don't know if it's going to have time to do it tonight but so i didn't i didn't take some of these scriptures and piece them together i just want to make reference to them very quickly and jotted down these definitions in the old testament there's scriptures many scriptures in the old testament just the language of the old testament show that faith relates to truth against something known something understood and i think i mean if you just if you just ponder that isn't isn't that what real trust is and faith is is it's you you there's some it's a known commodity it's i could even say that tonight as i minister you are willing to follow what i'm saying because you trust me and you know what i've been saying uh maybe even more than 12 months but if someone you had no idea who they were where they came from what their background was and they began to use these statements and talk there might be a party that begins to say where is he going with this is he going into intellect or is he going into it some other evidence-based thing or is he where is he trying to pull us and it would be the lack of knowledge that would give you the the uh an insecurity and unwillingness to really give your trust over and it would be a very it would be a very difficult argument and i find that now the kind of the doors are kind of opening up and it's kind of wanting to spill me over into so much of what's my inspiration but if if someone says well you just have to trust me just trust me on this um i guess it would either it had to be some circumstance where it's look it's i'm either dead or i just do what he's asking me to do and i might as well give it a shot but that would be really that wouldn't be a real uh fair thing to do to say just trust me because even jesus would say if you can't believe me for what i'm saying believe me for my works so he's saying that search the scriptures if you don't want to take me at my word search the scriptures for you believe that you have you have an inheritance and eternal life by the scripture and if you search the scripture you'd find that the scriptures written beforehand that you believe in are testifying of me and he was willing to point them to evidence willing to point them to a basis of conviction and their faith to say look you guys believe the prophets go read what the prophet said and examine my life by it and see if you can't tell that it matches exactly what they said believe me for my work's sake he said if you can't just believe me in the things that i'm saying that line up in scripture saying that i'm also doing things that should comport with your faith and conviction of what the messiah would do and so jesus didn't even himself show up and say just listen to me just just just accept what i'm trying to say again i hope you say very labor to stay very very close to my intent i i realize that maybe there's a this is something where you have to stay very focused i think even brother branham says teaching can be very treacherous because you're trying to lay down something and it's easy for maybe the mind just to kind of wonder or kind of go this way don't assume don't assume anything uh anything that i haven't said i'd be very careful not to assume it and then also i would i would say don't make the mistake of assuming that i haven't studied this out and i don't know what i'm talking about and i don't i don't say that as a threat i'm just saying i'm being very deliberate not to go into too much but say enough to get ourselves thinking so the old testament language that would makes faith connected with truth there's two words used for faith and truth in the old testament umuna and emmet and so in the old testament you have faith and truth that are words that we read in our english language but words that are used and they're also often interchangeable in some versions or renditions of the old testament and this imunna and emmet both come from the same root among and so actually jack's middle name is emmett and this is part of where we get it from is this emmet which is truth and it comes from the same root in the scripture of amman which means firmness certainty reliability translated to faithfulness and this so this is this is faithfulness and reliability and certainty so even faith and truth are almost synonymous and interchangeable in the old testament and true faith is like truth it is something sure it is something certain true faith is like truth it's not hazy it's not mystical it's not imaginative it's not hope so true faith is like truth it is sure it is certain it is real and so this is i i may just skip several scriptures that we had tonight this is and i'll try to maybe draw to this close faith is not blind trust is their title is blind trust bad faith faith is not blind trust and so when you are asked to believe something he said just believe just accept it don't doubt then then it begs the question upon what basis like what are you asking me to just believe uh what is what is it your what is it you're trying to get me to accept and and what apprehension are you wanting me now to relinquish and get rid of because there's sometimes it seems as if oppressed where you just have to accept it you just have to believe it and and you shouldn't doubt it and this there has to be you say well what context am i being asked to believe it what am i being asked to accept what is it that uh what is what doubt is it you're asking me to resolve and to relinquish and so was just saying that and i think that kind of provokes the thought process for for all of us we're kind of like okay wow all right uh where are we going because oftentimes that's even what we're challenged to do just accept it but would you go to somebody if you would go to somebody today who you find has just been in a car accident and they find themselves unable to breathe and you think that maybe they've had a punctured lung and you say i'm a christian i'm going to pray for it just believe it and accept it and they're like i'm an atheist right you know he'd be like well you're gonna have there's some there's a context there's a basis there to be like well you might have to be doing this on your own faith now right and so the exact what's the context that someone is being challenged and i say it's because oftentimes people are challenged to accept it and believe that we kind of witness the challenge oh that's right buddy you better believe and accept it and we don't know the links to which god has proven and vindicated their presence with that person and it's a matter of them remembering and and realizing and recognizing i believe for a reason and i have no reason to stop believing now so the challenge has context and the and the the the encouragement to just believe and just accept it and so there's then there's times we're asking somebody to accept something and we haven't given them any basis or reason to do it and it's in this if i and i feel so good just being able to offer that as uh allude to it so it's in that dynamic to where we kind of get this idea that faith is always just accepted just believe it don't doubt and it's it's rid of context and it doesn't have it it hasn't formed the basis of faith having been built reason been given then misunderstood faith can often lead to us accepting lies as truth because we don't understand faith the mechanics of faith we don't understand what faith is and we get in our mind that faith is just accepting something without question and faith is just accepting something and trying to quiet the doubt or something like that and so we kind of find that this is what faith is and if we get in the habit of making that faith then we get in the habit of not using discernment and there comes a time that someone is suggesting that they're kind of saying here's the word you should take this but instead they hand you something totally different right you're like brother aaron brings his phone to the pulpit yeah you know do you know that the crypto market never closes i mean you've got to be you got to have your alerts set i bring it up here for the clock and for songs so i know the words and don't do what brother michael did the other day and bail on a song like you know start singing like i don't know the words to this song i'm just gonna start humming he's gone right when i really want to probably not even hear that because he doesn't string but well his poor wife is about redder than he would be so i feel bad now but in doing that and we just kind of go we just take oh well thanks for the word right and it's not because what have we kind of gotten into this habit of just taking someone at their word really it's a real danger with um when christianity becomes a lot of pastor worship and it's the pastor the pastor the pastor ordained to see you through and get behind your pastor and believe your pastor and so what happens is you get to where it's always the pastor right the pastor the pastor passed whatever he says goes and you get in that dynamic in that mode and then one day because of that pastor's own something begins to deviate and takes a step away from the word and you're kind of like uh are you sure i'm the pastor it's going oh you're right sorry right and and because of that we begin to engage in a particular way to where we become susceptible to just believing things without reason and having the wrong concept of faith can make us very susceptible to gullibility this is awesome because i'm not gonna be able to finish i feel like i got half my sermon for next time already but in different instances in the scripture in jude in colossians and timothy and i like to read these at a future time but this will be good just to just to mention them now that the believers ask to contend for the faith and says do it because there's people who come in and are trying to confuse the faith he says that paul says you should be established in the faith he says be careful because there's people who try to spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit and there's these instances in scripture where the faith is being lifted up the faith is being lifted up and in context of it it's saying and there's those are going to really try to confuse you on this matter and i'll go ahead and read it in 2nd timothy chapter 3 verses 1 to 8 this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy without natural affection truce breakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady high-minded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god lewd fellows of the base resort this is quite a crowd there and then it says having a form of godliness that these these things can be covered in religion these things can be covered up by this form of goddesses but denying the power thereof what is the power it is the gospel it is the power of revelation is the power of transformation they have a form of goddess but they've denied the power of the mystery of godliness they didn't they they have what seems to be the gospel or the truth but they don't hold the mystery of the faith having a form of guidance but denying the power thereof he says from such turn away so he says for of this sort the lewd fellows of a baser sword are they which creep into houses and lead captive silly women laden with sins they capitalize on the guilt of these women and their desire to be right in them being compromised maybe a broken marriage maybe a sinful past maybe just a desire to please god in plague with doubt and unbelief these types of people will lead these women who are foolish considered silly lead them astray because of their own sincerity and weaknesses and lead them away with diverse lusts so there's some stilling of some gullibility that allows them to capitalize and mislead these women and then this is their marker ever learning more and more knowledge more and more this more and more that but they never come to the knowledge of the truth we cannot let we cannot learn uh confuse scholarship and intellect and skill with words and the ability to set things forth or even the sheer enormity of the number of quotes that can be read has been any sort of indication of true knowledge of the truth those things conform ever learning can form an image or an impersonation of godliness but not be the power of it ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth now as janice and jammers with did moses so do these also resist the truth men of corrupt minds reprobate concerning the faith not proved not standing the test they don't hold the mystery of the rep they're bankrupt concerning the mystery of the faith because they're reprobate concerning it they're they they can speak things they can say things they can express things there's things that could be connected maybe tied together and there's a way that things could be presented as i've said before there's a way that satan could present things as truth but in reality it is not truth though it may be radiating it seemed to be with the light but it's just a glitter and as i close i i want to choose my words very carefully because i want to express my heart realizing that we'll have service together on sunday but next wednesday night brother reggie plett is going to be speaking and and and i may not have time to come back to this for a couple weeks but there is something there's something very pure for the believer and i mean i want this to be very real in your mindset because i mean there's something very pure about us taking god at his word that there is something very precious for a believer to believe what he says that's something that's very very precious and it's so precious that it must be guarded and this is where to the things i've mentioned in no way would i want to diminish real faith genuine faith genuine trust genuine abandonment to christ but understand the basis in the genesis of our faith toward now with this precious faith toward now knowing him and being convinced of the nature of god i can trust him implicitly completely totally that is such a precious thing that we must guard it and we should never misplace that kind of faith that faith that you have in god you should never put in me as a pastor but you're your very confidence that i can be a pastor and lead you properly is strengthened by your confidence in god's promise to you not to me i could just tell you my whole life story and convince you that wow god must be with brother aaron i'm so glad we're all here and at the end of the day i could just make you really really good followers of me until you have your own extraordinary testimony and say i know god well enough that though everyone around me fall i know where i stand with him and therefore i'm not being propped up in my relationship with christ by how dynamic the church services are how beautiful the building is i think we've all proven hey right we're not here because we're all hilton diamond members we're here because we love the word and that you have a personal experience with christ in it the word is feeding you but i'm cautioning against this dynamic that often exists within religions and and things the personality cults where it all becomes a lot about one man's testimony one man's witness and no matter how dynamic that is and no matter how much god has vindicated his presence with him god wants you to have your own personal experience so you can say that i know the god of abraham isaac and jacob and it's so precious that we should never take this faith that we put in god alone and that we place in the word alone and then somehow allow that to get misdirected so now we're using the same dynamic we would use with the word because we have reason and then do that with other things when we have no reason in other words our faith should never become blind trust because if our faith ever becomes blind trust our testimonies in bad faith what you think about that if your faith really is just blind trust then your testimony will be in bad faith unless really what you want to do is just tell everybody hey look i don't get it i don't understand it but just accept it just trust me on this just believe what i'm telling you and that's going to be the basis upon which you want people to live the life that you've been living but when you know that you know and it's faith then your testimony is real we we are coming to a place where we ought to have supreme faith let that become something that anchors in your mind we use perfect faith supreme faith brother brahm says you cannot have that faith until you know perfectly what you are doing i think sometimes we have a definition of faith that is the exact opposite of that is what are you doing i don't know but i but i have faith but you can't have supreme faith until you know perfectly what you're doing i believe we're coming to an hour where we ought to have perfect faith and let everything accumulate up coming to a place now as believers to where we have reason to be steadfast in this we're not just here on a whim we're not just here because our parents are dragging us by our ear we're not here because we don't have any anywhere else that we would want to be or what we could do but we're here because we have faith and we have reason to believe what we've believed let's stand together this evening please accept this disclaimer this is just the start of me getting all the pieces of the puzzle on the table i mentioned it before i have a philosophy when it comes to putting together a puzzle it's first get all the puzzle pieces on the table and then it's turn all the puzzle pieces face up and then it separate all the border pieces and then once you get all the border pieces separated you can begin to build your border but then at that point you begin to combine like elements together is this instructive for you maybe i could put together a puzzle class we could do a little uh little workshop and a breakout session on putting together puzzles but there's it and so in some ways that's what i'm doing tonight in looking at this subject is let's i'm looking at a picture maybe you don't see it but i'm just trying to get all my pieces out there and if you feel that brother aaron you seem to be a little bit too much balanced on uh maybe the the the knowing aspect and the understanding aspect and in having reason and you think about these other elements to where we believe god we take him at his word and we just trust him i i want you to just consider that that the admonishment to trust god and accept him is not without basis and that's really what i'm referring to when i talk about reason and evidence and conviction and truth and knowledge is that what we know by revelation we want to also know by experience and yes the revelation of it is beautiful but in in in believing that and really having that revelation don't you make preparation for it god ever reveals something to you you make preparation for it so then it's gonna it's gonna it's gonna come to a place of confirmation and vindication and truth let's bow our heads this evening [Music] our gracious heavenly father tonight as we close this service we are we're grateful lord that we had an instinct a gift a god-given gift a manifestation of grace in our lives [Music] that when we heard the word say follow me that something struck deep within our hearts and upon that basis that beginning we we made a step towards you things were confirmed in our hearts and it felt as if something was being disclosed to us that transcended human experience and human knowledge and upon that basis we walked in obedience to the word and we're so grateful lord that you have not asked us to continue in this experience [Music] and this walk this christian walk solely on that one experience that we had so many years ago but there has been a constant and continual confirmation of your presence in our lives yes lord we acknowledge tonight difficult times hard times there was times when you withdrew yourself it seemed and you challenged us and you were you were challenges on our experience and you were asking us to take you at your word and we were having to believe without emotion and without any sight of anything coming but we weren't we weren't unbelievers lord we weren't deniers of the faith we had reason to trust you we had reason to believe lord i'm grateful that tonight that as we read the story of thomas though he may be a doubting thomas and though there is a blessedness for those like us who have not seen the resurrected christ and touched him and handled him we still believe the witness and the testimony of scripture but even with thomas he was ordained to life and being ordained to life you gave him a personal experience and i pray lord that for those of us who may be young in this faith that you would continue to confirm your presence with us that we could have solid footing and a a a a conviction and a steadfastness [Music] lord i pray that we as believers could recognize that the faith that we have and the strength of it is that it is in truth something unchangeable immutable something that has not varied with time lord i believe that the truths that we hold the things that we have deep within our hearts that if you were to take away all of our history books and take away all of our knowledge and the bible that what we what we know to be true would remain true forevermore but when it comes to science science has a history lord that even what they believe to be absolutely true today could be changed tomorrow and so lord if i'm going to be honest as a scientist i really don't know but as a christian i can i pray that you give us that solid foot and that deep conviction to know you in a personal way and help us lord to not engage in blind trust but i i just poured out my heart before you before the people as i prayed just so that there wouldn't be any confusion lord we have faith and faith isn't always guided by our senses but that doesn't mean it's blind and lord we trust you and sometimes we trust you that you're going to do something absent from any evidence that would tell us that it is going to be but that trust isn't blind because we have a reason to believe that you'll do it there's some basis for us to accept that you would i pray father that you will help us in this subject matter and keep things straight in the believer's heart lord i realize i'm pouring a lot of stuff out there to provoke thought but maybe a blessing and a benefit to the believer today i ask these things in the lord jesus christ amen thank you for your patience tonight i trust that you could just kind of hold that some of these things in your heart and just ponder them ponder them maybe don't draw any conclusions if you're struggling with the direction but just ponder them god bless you
