TRANSCRIPT
========================================
as we are asking the question what is God's will for me this year we've used this um emphasis on the year in preview as a way of implying very explicitly stating that uh because there are certain things we can know um with respect to God's will it can give us a preview of what our year holds for us in a lot of specifics now there's maybe a lot of things that remain to be seen and there's a lot of things that will transpire over this year that we did not anticipate there's some that make promises maybe there's been New Year's resolutions and there's a thought that I I want to keep this job forever or I'm going to live here forever I'm never going to do this I'm never going to do that and then God comes along and has different plans and so things change and our path doesn't always go the way that we think that would but there's certain things even on that path that should be constant and should be consistent regardless of where we end up what job we have or if there's some sort of move or some significant change in our lives there are certain constants that are his plan for us no matter what comes up and that's what we're doing when asking this question what is God's will for us this year there are things that we can know are his will and it's that plan that he has for us and those constants and those things that are consistent three things that we're wanting to emphasize in these services and I think that it'd be good for us to be constantly reminded of this but these these are things that we know are God's will last Sunday we went through just a few statements and scriptures to show that this is God's will for us to attend church contribute tithes and offerings and support missions these are three things that are God's will whether it's 2022 2020 2023 whatever it is it's God's will for us to be doing this and if we if the meeting in the air tarries and we we have it translated in the next five years these are things that we all ought to be doing and you say well what if they start shutting things down and something intervenes well God knows and he's mindful people and we could still say until we get out of here this is his perfect will for us I remember on the onset of the pandemic after it's kind of cute when you go back to think about how we felt the first day we stayed home we thought oh you know a couple days at home a few weeks maybe at home and then a few years kind of rolls out and you realize that's this is exactly maybe I would have done things differently had I known this is how it was going to be but I remember after a few weeks and maybe even a month it was with no church and not able to have service where we were and no gatherings I just felt very strong in my heart that we're either getting back to church or the body change is going to happen within 72 hours or a week because this isn't God's will to perfect his church and so if if they shut all the doors and it doesn't look foreseeable that we're going to be getting back together then maybe we're just going to get out of here because these are things that are God's will for us and that's one reason why we ought to be supporting missions is because you never know what's going to happen overseas where governments can shut doors sometimes we just have this persecution complex here in America like they're taking away our rights and you say that with an AR-15 strapped on your back and uh and so there's a lot of things that we whine and cry about maybe in America about rights and freedoms and Liberties but you go to places that are War torn or they have dictators and they don't have the freedom that we have and doors can be shut there can be real persecution overseas and that's why we should be supporting missions so that we can facilitate the move of God and give them the resources they need so that we can all get out of here but these are three things that I believe I could say definitively are God's will for us among many other things even on the Wednesday nights we've been talking about sanctify your home gather around the word and live for others are the three things that are God's will for our homes now last week we were taking a thought from the book of haggai and how that God looked at them and said you're living in these well you know furnished homes and you've got Wayne's coating on your walls and you've got nice hardwood floors and everything's very very beautiful but my temple lays in waste and you haven't built up the walls of the temple and you've laid a foundation and you started well but you haven't continued therein and God is challenging them about the fact that they've been focused on natural things and haven't been doing his will and so we put it last week that God was correcting their Vision we could say that God was correcting them because they followed their own desires and not his will and it wasn't the air I could say isn't that they had nice things in their home but is that they had nice things in their home and they weren't doing God's Will and had they been doing God's will then God would have said hey you know have as much wood panel in your homes as you want and have all the nice finery and and enjoy those things but put God first and in haggai chapter 1 verse 5 this was the says it in verse 7 as well I believe he says now therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts consider your ways and so this is that challenge that was being issued forth consider your ways think about what you're doing and think about what you're emphasizing think about what you're lifting up consider whether or not you've prioritized carnal things over at God's expense I pursued this and there was something that God needed there was something that God wanted me to do and I pursued this maybe even if we could say well I see it's in God's desires for me and I see that he wants me to have these things and I I see that God would want these things to be done but you have to do things in order and so they were pursuing things or Desiring things maybe even achieving things that were part of God's blessing and part of God's plan maybe even things God had promised them but they couldn't do it at God's expense and so they had to keep God's Will and so the LA the the neglect of the house of God we were using as an analogy uh to us neglecting God's will in our lives or God's will for our lives and so we can't make the specific uh we can't put ourselves in a very specific situation that the children of Israel were in who had come out of Exile come back to Jerusalem and we're not building up the walls of that church or that Temple we can't maybe that make the specific comparison but we can say they weren't doing God's Will and that's what we're wanting to draw from it is doing God's will in Proverbs chapter 29 Verse 18 where there is no vision that people perish but he that keepeth the law happy is he that word Vision means divine Oracle a revelation from God and what would that be God disclosing his will we know without faith it is impossible to please God faith is a revelation of God's will for us and so there's so much that's wrapped up in these words that this Vision where there is no following in God's will where we don't give preference to the things of God the people live undisciplined they live unrestrained they may feel like they're making progress but they're going to end up in a spot and say oh wait a minute how did I get here this isn't where I'm supposed to be and so we recognized from those emphasis last week that we want to get we do not want to just give priority to temporal things over God's will this is the Striking scripture to me that I wanted to mention again today in haggai chapter 1 verse six you have sown much in bringing little so there's a lot of effort but not a lot of return you eat but you have not enough so they're eating but it's not quite quenching you drink but you're not filled to drink you clothe you but there is none warm and he that earneth wages earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes but beautiful imagery that is being created and it was not that it's literally a wallet with a hole in it or a purse with a gaping hole in it or a bank account with the back door where some hacker is still in all your all your Bitcoin but it is literally it's used in a figurative sense to say that you're literally laboring and all your labor is just going right through and you're not getting the benefit from it or the return from it that you ought to be getting you earn a wage and you put it in a bag and it just drops right out um some say eating working eating hand to mouth as soon as you get it you eat it or you're not really getting ahead you're not gaining or building or getting in an advancement and this is such a striking correction and what I'd want you to take from this is doing God's will blesses your labors and increases the yield of fruit that you get from your labor if you do God's will then then there's a the laboring that even in itself there's a reward in laboring knowing from whom your reward comes and you can do it as unto the Lord and you can work and so even the effort and the labor will be blessed where there won't be as much uh maybe stress or strain there's a way that when you're putting God's first God first he has a way of lifting you up and encouraging you toward the labor itself is not as burdensome as it could be and then also if you put God first and do his will he'll actually bless the fruits of that labor so I think there's two levels on that that uh that are tremendous to consider in terms of doing God's Will and what it means in terms of our yield our labor and our yield I thought about this principle several times over the last few weeks studying these scriptures and it was at a men's meeting several years ago some of you may remember it my brother Jason Watkins used the example the force multiplier and and some of you may be familiar with it in terms of military experience and different things but a force multiplier is a capability that when added to and employed by a combat force it significantly increases the combat potential of that force and thus enhances the probability of a successful mission and so I figured and I know everybody's like you know you're looking at me like a mule at a new gate uh when I read that but it's um Force multipliers something that makes a given Force more effective than it would be without that multiplier so it's adding something so you have a force you have a labor you have something you're doing maybe in this sense you have a combat Force oh we got a lot of men we got tens of thousands of men we're going to put them in this direction and we're going to send them out to accomplish this Mission but they say that if you give the a GPS unit to this force that it's this force is more successful the results of that Force are five times as large as it would be without the GPS so it's a force multiplier of five and so you could give different examples of what a force multiplier is but it's basically you have a force you have them equipped they're trained and they could do something but then you add something to it and it multiplies their fours so if a GPS is a five times a multiplier to a combat unit what I want to what I took from this and what I was reminded of and I just love how brother Jason brought it out in the men's meeting so it's always stuck with me that God is our Force multiplier and that's exactly what being referred to in haggai chapter 1 verse 6. imagine if you even ask haggai he's saying yeah I'm the one that came up with it I'm the one that came up with the force multiplier or the scriptures say one shall Chase so many two shall Chase so many what it's a force multiplier where God is that Force multiplier and what and this is what I'm wanting to encourage you with whatever you're doing whatever you're laboring in if you put God's first he multiplies your labor and multiplies your fruits this is what doing God's will is a force multiplier and the Bible says a hundredfold is maybe what it's the force multipliers 100 times but it's Limitless what God can do for us when we put him first the Bible says I can do all things through Christ who gives me strength and so this this is what uh I'm wanting you to take this at the beginning maybe I didn't know exactly wasn't exactly sure where to fit this in but I think right here now even if we fail to come back to it later this is what I'm wanting to emphasize in doing God's Will and doing these things is there is a blessing and a benefit that comes from doing God's will so when we can know what God's will is and do it that's good that what Jesus is Happy are you if you do these things in knowing God's will we get a great benefit from it now those three things attend church contribute tithes and offering support missions each one is worthy of a lot of time we could spend a lot of time on each one of those things there's a lot that can be brought out a lot that can be shared I've wrestled with just exactly uh how how to share it when to share it how much to share I felt impressed today just to take some time on a very familiar uh some very familiar principles on this first part of attend church and so I can say this and doesn't it feel good to be here to hear this right I mean at least you're not somebody's not just you know hitting you with the DM this afternoon saying hey where were you we we heard about how good it is to be in church but you're all here and so it is God's will for us to assemble together and there's a lot of different or if I could say not only just to symbol ourselves together but there's some familiarity with that that if you're assembling together there's some uh consistency and some constancy and there's the familiarity that's why they call it a brother man called it a church home that we ought to have a church home when it so when I say attend church and we'll look at some of these scriptures uh it is God's will for us to assemble together in a common place at a common time to where there's there's some there's momentum that builds with that assembly and so you say well I get together um every every Sunday morning at 10 o'clock at my favorite sports bar um to watch football and you say I'm assembling I'm assembly with like-minded people no doubt but it's that's not the assembly that's being spoken of or nor is it just always visiting a different Church there's something other something else implied in that as we look into the word of God and this is a very forceful forceful statement brother Branham in the sermon the voice of the sign says we believe that every Christian ought to have a home church that they go to so what is what is home to us it's the place that we return to and we return to over and over again I remember when we were traveling quite a bit as a young family in traveling in Ministry uh that you know there was uh there was moments I think when at least with Jack and some of our other children they didn't know what home was and one time Jack asked he says you remember that White House and the White House and we're like yeah we remember the White House we we've toured the White House we had some connections at the time thank you uh Donald Trump who hasn't paid his ties um and they there's a um I mean we looked at all his tax records it's not in there anywhere but uh he was saying yeah we remember the White House the White House the one in DC goes no the one in Texas and we realized he's referring to our house it's like it was white and he was like and that's what in his mind he was thinking I remember even when we moved to North Carolina we'd been there for like three or four months and he said Dad are you done preaching here yet because he's just so used to us going somewhere to preach he's like hey isn't it time to go to the next hotel the next house when are we ever going back to Texas and uh hopefully never and so that was uh we had moved on from that and and they didn't know what home was but we all know what the thought of home is right it's the place you returned to it's a place you come back to after you go on a work trip when you're returning you're going home and when you land on the airplane and everyone's standing up says oh is Phoenix home or wherever you're Landing they ask why because that's the place you return it's some place where it's consistent you can say well have you checked them at their home or are you when are you going home it's a reference point so brother Brown says I believe that every Christian ought to have a home church that they go to every Christian to meet somewhere with Believers and I love this and wherever you meet that's the church so this is a principle that he references and if if I felt any if I had felt at all that I was going to be doing plowing today and that I was working with this spirit and this I that people had this thought in their head a real stubborn thought that you don't need to go to church and there's no such thing at church and you could just stay home because you are the church I remember brother Gabriel many years ago brother Elijah you might remember this when you'd ask him where he goes where he went to church he'd go I am the church right you might remember that and that's the way some people think about it is well I am the church wherever I am is church and wherever if you want to come over and visit me on a Sunday we can have church but brother Bam's talking about having a home church where you meet with Believers and where they meet it's the Assembly of the people that make it what it is that make it a church and so there's a lot of phrases that we can use with respect to this that we find in the word of God where every believer every Christian ought to have a a post of Duty or a place of Duty and that means a place of responsibility and it's a regular meeting place and wherever that is that's the church because the people come together with that intent and it means something and this is God's will for us now Matthew chapter 18 I'm going to read verses 15 to 17 and then we'll finish with the rest of this a little bit later on but it says moreover If thy brother shall trespass against thee go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone now there's there's a good good um teaching and don't go tell everybody what you're doing right well I'm going to give him a piece of my mind just between he and I and you let everybody know right you hit the group chat I'm going to visit brother Aaron and give him a piece of my mind uh he trespasses I said go to him and tell him alone he says and if thou if he hears thee thou has gained thy brother but if he will not hear thee then take with thee one or two more that in the mouth of two or three Witnesses every word may be established what beautiful principles that we can follow and if he shall neglect to hear them this is you and those Witnesses tell it unto the church but if you neglect to hear the church let him be unto thee as a heathen man and a publican with respect to verse 15 and 16 and I think even verse 17 obviously what Jesus proposes is impossible without the existence of the church because even in the idea of if my brother shall trespass against thee for us that means within Christianity it's the basis of Fellowship a basis of relationship um you you don't go to fries and walk in and begin to announce their hey good to see you brothers and sisters and just call everybody brother and call Everybody's sister sometimes we do I do remember one time at a men's meeting there was a preacher there preaching and he kept saying my brother my sister and it's like men's you know it's like well I don't know who you're streaming to right now but I mean there's no sisters here but you don't you go around and say my you know brother and sister and you're always uh if you said that there would be someone looking to say my answer brother right uh did you just uh misgender me I'm not your I'm not your sister and so there's a lot of a lot of connotation to that idea of even a brother there's a basis for Fellowship there's a basis of relationship and that arises in the church and he says so what he's proposing you could not even accomplish without the existence of the church the Ecclesia is the Greek word that's used it's translated to church or assembly but it's a gathering this word would have referred to a gathering of citizens called out of their homes into a public place so you call them from their homes into a place a public place for a meeting it's a group of Christians who observe religious rights hold meetings and govern their own Affairs this is the meaning that's intended behind the word church and it's those who anywhere who gather anywhere from City or Village or wherever they're Gathering from that constitute such a company a group of Christians and are united into one body so this is when Jesus says you shall tell it to the church if he doesn't hear you then tell it unto the church other than him telling Peter Upon This Rock will I build my church this is the only other reference to the church this is the only other place where Jesus is signaling hey there's going to be a siblings there's going to be those that gather together to a Jew they have the concept of a synagogue and they have a concept of meeting with the rabbi and the teachings and different things they would have had that idea but this is Jesus saying there's going to be a Christian church and Paul is the one that establishes that he's the one that lays so much of the firm principles that we observe today within the Christian Church he's saying hey if he won't hear you bring it to the local Gathering bring it to the the that group that gathers together that holds meetings and observes the the the the the the traditions and the responsibilities of the scripture and they're United in one body and I believe that when Jesus tells us this he is if not uh pointing to it he is clearly uh if he's clearly pointing to it but Jesus is establishing the absolute necessity of a local assembly with order the church brother Branham in the sermon the position of a believer in Christ oh maybe this would be a good place to say it there are so many quotes um so many statements on going to church and having a home church and go to church and go to church there's so many there's even some that we some that we reviewed that we went over last year and that's why I call it a year the Year in preview because in some ways we're actually just reviewing some of the things that we had already ministered on just to keep them fresh in our minds but there's so much that can be said I've really labored um in the study to try to find a way to present it at a little bit different angle other than just quote after quote after quote that's the uh that emphasizes certain things but there's some that I definitely want to re-emphasize or share just so it's we're reminded of how significant this assembly is that Jesus is referring to in this sermon the position of a believer in Christ now the fellow said I can be a Christian and stay home just as well that the fellow said it was referring to it but anybody say well I can I can stay home and be a Christian I don't have to go to church and be a Christian he says no you can't no you've got to meet together with the rest of the body this is uh he revisits this in a couple other ways to where he's clearly identifying that if anyone think he standeth take heed lest he fall because you cannot be the same Christian and not assembled together with other believers and those who by way of tragedy or circumstance who find themselves having fallen out of going to church and no longer attend church there is a price that they pay for that because you cannot be a Christian you cannot be the same Christian you cannot live the Christian Life and not assemble together and Paul it picks up there's a number of places that touch on um what the seeds that Jesus sowed and how Paul brings them out especially when it relates to the church but in Hebrews chapter 10 verses 24 and 25 I know some of you probably already wrote this reference down and are surprised it took me this long to get to it but says and let us consider one another to provoke unto love unto good works not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much the more as you see the day approaching if you could take all these verses together these two verses together and kind of keep them keep them together in each principle each phrase and keep them together in the thought that kind of hinges in this central part not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together look at verse 24 and how it says let's consider one another to provoke one of the love and good works and exhorting one another so much the more as you see that day approaching it the center of this is assembling yourselves together if not forsaken the assembling of yourselves together as the manner of some is this is Paul saying that these assemblies and you look into the New Testament the book of Acts and other places where they were ordaining that which was needful in the churches and they were assembling here and they were gathering here and there's all these different references in the scripture where you had this church here this church here even the the seven Church ages under the church which is at these are places where Believers were assembling together that's the dynamic and the mechanics that are being referenced here let us consider one another not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together this is the church that Jesus is referring to Billy Branham says in the sermon discernment of spirit you ought to have a place not just to float about from pillar to pose but have somewhere that you go to church and you call it your church somewhere you somewhere you pay your tithe and somewhere that you help support the causes so there's one that starts that kind of hits all three that's where that's where you pay your tithes you pay your tithes where you go to church and you and and I would say this just for clarification that if there's other Mission projects you're supporting and there's a lot of missionaries that are out there a lot of Mission Works and programs that you may be supporting um so you're I believe that a Christian's at Liberty to do that I'll even go so far as I say you have absolute Liberty not to pay tithes right you do it do what you want to do in our in our house like that this may shock you but I smoke as much weed as I want hey you do too right it just I don't want any right and so if you don't want to pay your taxes you have that right you don't have you don't have to pay your ties but there's scriptural principles that you're abiding by and you're following in doing it and so where brother Brown teaches this I think it's very clear you pay your ties where you go to church and but when it comes to supporting other causes that's kind of what I believe Church ought to be doing is giving us opportunities to support missions and support certain causes and in a vacuum or in the void of not having causes your supporting ones continue by all means to support whatever missionaries and Mission projects that you feel burdened to support but in the right time I want to share with you all the things that our church is doing to support missions and if you feel to support that that's what this is about it's all part of it together but notice it says you go somewhere you call it your church it's where you pay your tithes and you help support the cause take your choice so you've chosen where you go and then I love how brother Branham is so quick to identify kind of that it's us right this us mentality but then don't never double negative but we get the point don't never disfellowship the other man because he don't belong with your group and then beautiful thought here discern the spirit and see if he's got the same purpose and heart then you've got Fellowship on with another and sometimes it might take a little bit of effort to discern enough to find that that common ground and that common basis to find Fellowship but just because somebody goes to a different assembly or goes to a different Church doesn't mean you you remove from them the appellation brother I'm not going to call you brother anymore because you go to a different Church brother mom says no you choose your church you have a choice where you go to church you've prayed about it you feel this is where God wants you to be and you make that choice don't ever disfelish it because God hasn't given them the same leading but you must know for yourself that you have a place and not just float around from Pillar To Post but you go to that church and you call it your church and you support it I would say this and I say it with much with as much confidence as I possibly can I don't think there's any debate whatsoever it is God's will for you to assemble with believers it is God's will for you to go to church it's just there's no it's there's no debate if someone wanted to argue the point with me and use all the quotes that they can try to muster up to prove that it's okay to stay home uh I'm just saying no you just can't do it and and and I think there's probably a lot of at the very least of just to use an intellectual term a lot of intellectual dishonesty for anyone who tries to use the message of the hour or the Bible to make that point a real real uh strong cognitive dissonance at work if anyone tried to make the argument that you don't have to go to church because it's just so plain in Acts chapter 17 verses one to three we'll skip to verse two says they're they're passing through uh and they came to thessalonica where it was a synagogue of the Jews so the synagogue would be the assembly the Gathering of Jews and it's where the concept of gathering and assembling would have been very familiar in the institution of the Christian church as it was established amongst the Jews it says and Paul as his manner was went unto them in three Sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures so now every Sabbath he's going into the synagogue and reason opening in a legend that Christ must needs have suffered and risen again from the dead and that this Jesus whom I preached unto you is Christ this is what Paul was doing every Church day as they would Gather in this on the in the synagogue on the Sabbath day and that was a day holy unto the Lord and they would go to church they would go to their assembly it says Paul went to the synagogue of the Jews as his manner was this is what the scripture is telling us as what his manner was it's um custom or habitual practice this is something that Paul did on Saturdays or on the Sabbath day he went to church and when it's telling us that this is something Paul did as was his custom and this is what I believe that we ought to have this kind of discipline this kind of custom you'll say well is it just custom is it just discipline is it just tradition well I mean you know what God wants right don't reason yourself out of it because you don't want to be a hypocrite right and that to me is just one of the most uh interesting arguments that people make well I don't want to I really don't want to go to church all the time because you know I just don't want to make it a tradition all right So you you're fine with making a tradition not to go to church interesting I know people say well I don't want to go to church because I don't want to be a hypocrite well wait why would you be a hippo could come to church you're the seat of Satan what you mean like you don't want anyone to think you're a Christian because you're really not like no no I'm just not I'm just not really living the life but do you believe you're a Son of God yeah then go to church that's the one place you can't be a hypocrite you're a hypocrite when you're out in the world you're a hypocrite when you're at the bar you're a hypocrite when you're partying because you're really a Son of God living a life that's not congruent with what you really are and so really I there's just a lot of arguments that people make that are just so shallow and so I'm not wanting you to just latch on to words a habit and practice and custom I believe that the Bible speaks that it was Paul's manner or his habitual practice to go to church and I believe that this practice is a choice that one makes it's a choice to keep doing what one has done it implies this uh continual uh volition volition where this is something I do it implies permanence so if I could use a phrase maybe that wouldn't stumble you it was his testimony Paul went to church as it was his testimony it was the expectation that you would expect Paul to be there if Paul was traveling in the city and his companions are with them and Barnabas and someone says hey you know what's what's Paul going to be doing tomorrow he's like dude tomorrow's Saturday right Paul's going to the synagogue oh really yeah just you got to go see this right you knew what Paul was going to be doing it was something he did it was his testimony his expectation it was part of his character part of what identified who who he was brother Madam in the sermon trying to do God of service without it being God's will he says I'm so misunderstood and I don't know why people think I don't even believe in people going to church that's a million miles from the truth there's people who think that today and hang on every word he said he says but people think I don't even believe in people going to church that's a million miles from the truth we must assemble ourselves together and that much more as we see the day approaching we must come together in unity this is something that we must do brother bam in one place says usually it's my custom to go to church somewhere on Sunday if I possibly can this was his custom Luke chapter 4 verse 16 it says and he came to Nazareth just speaking of Jesus where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for to read this was the custom of Paul who's following in the pattern and the custom of Christ it was what you would expect him to do under normal circumstances that's what brother bam says this is what you can expect me to do under normal circumstances this is what you could expect Paul to do under normal circumstances this is what you could expect Christ to do under normal circumstances is that when that day comes and the church doors are open that this is where you could expect Paul this is where you can expect Christ that's where you can expect brother Madam and that's what we want our testimony it should be our testimony reputation that you would expect to be it would you be expected to be at church under normal circumstances that should be our testimony and I know it just so easily rolls off the tongue right to go to church but you all know what a labor it is to be here some of you drive four hours round trip to be here even on the midweek service so I I if it seems oh it seems really really easy I'm acknowledging that even if we just live hey you think you're late to church now live a mile from the church all right you'll be even more late and I'm sure some of you could testify to that it's like when you lived a little bit further away and then you moved like man I'm only like 10 miles away from church now we're going to be there 30 minutes early every year right still hasn't happened yet because it it's it's always a labor it's always a truck there's always resistance I guarantee you if you're wanting to if you had a vaccination appointment at 10 o'clock on a Sunday morning you'll be you'd get somehow some way you'd get a police escort to be there at 9 30. right it's just going to work that way but when it comes to coming to church it's always a resistance it's always a fight so it's very very easy for me to express these principles but I know in doing it there's a labor that comes with it things you have to fight for that's why we've tried to emphasize it the way we to have but brother bam says that it's a million miles from the truth they say that he didn't believe in going to church because it was his custom to go to church it should be our custom to go to church you say well is that just tradition is it just legalism no it's just what we do because we're believers you find this come up a few times in the summer of 64. brother Branham has asked about church in different variances on this in different ways he's asked about should I go to this church what should I do this is question 331 in part three brother Brown do you teach that the bride must not attend any other Church unless you are preaching or otherwise the Tabernacle huh I feel like I should have the Jeopardy theme playing think about it Ponder brother Branham do you teach that the bride must not attend any other Church unless you are preaching or otherwise the Tabernacle no I do not teach that I do not believe that I do not believe it I'm glad he did it like three different ways like right because there's just some people says well I know he said no but he was actually objecting to the way they phrased it no I don't teach that I don't believe it I do not believe it I'm here's maybe the shocking part we've got ministers sitting here that's scattered all around through the country and I believe they are part of that bride people clutching their pearls preachers part of the Bride I believe that a man or woman can go to church anywhere they want to go that teaches the word and I believe and this is just how important church is think about he says and I believe if they don't teach the whole word and you can't go to church any other place where they teach the whole word go where they teach half the word until you can get get to where they teach the whole word I love how he phrases it right and some of you may say well brother Aaron that's why we're all here praying for a whole word church and I would say I'm glad that we could be here right it's ABC Arizona Believers crumbs right you can't get a slice get a crumb but that's how our hearts should be right our heart should be I want to be in church well there's no there's really no good churches then go where there's a half good church until right until you can get to where they teach the whole word go to church whatever you do do that so no matter how you might want to massage it with the rest of the message and and place it just how you how you believe brother Branham would want you to obey and adhere to assembling yourself together that there's he's saying that that's God's will for us and I know there's a danger of legalism there's a danger of rigid compliance uh where there's really not an understanding or a Grace when it comes to these things and some people have an attendance chart and um and as soon as you're guilty and transgressing one time because really if you want to be legalistic about it uh you'd have to have perfect attendance then and never miss a service right and we've all missed a service and and so there's a uh there's a way that people can be very legalistic about it they could use it kind of as a badge of honor and they're very there it's this rigid discipline to it without really an understanding of why they're even Gathering it's it's faithfulness to a legacy it's faithfulness to a man it's faithfulness to a building it's just it's just they go to church because the if I get the the skeleton or the outline of these things has been preached but there's been no heart or flesh added to it so they can be very Stern and very rigid well that's just what we do we just go to church and it's by any means necessary but it's it's going to church just for the sake of going to church and they don't pause to ask themselves well I don't live to go to church I go to church to live and am I getting what I need to live and where I go to church and it's this honest question that you can't think that you're fulfilling the will of God for your life if you're just going to church because I could just all of a sudden flip it and seem very schizophrenic and read all the quotes about says you say oh I go to church that don't mean nothing right and over and over again I don't mean nothing you say you go to church you say you go to church that don't mean nothing and you go over here what means something that you go to church it's because you got to understand the why behind it like am I I don't live to go to church I go to church to live and so maybe because you don't get what you need to live you then live to get there and you're doing everything you can just to get to church because you know once you get there you're not going to get what you need to live so everything's got to get out of balance but I do want to emphasize or really identify how that brother Branham and maybe I could say for this my emphasis is about establishing the habit and discipline of obeying God's Will and putting God first and since in our lives and how varied they are and all the demands the gifts the talents the callings the visions that you may have even how God would lead you within your own home is not up to me to decide and it's not for others to judge it's there's such a variance in how you could be led as a man of God in your own home because I do believe and I'll mention it today as we often have I am nobody's spiritual husband right but I am Elizabeth's Pastor spiritually speaking and if you go to this church I'm your I am your pastor not spiritually speaking I just am literally speaking right and so there's not this husbandry that I have over the flock and oh so you went on about electric vehicle huh well you didn't talk to me about what our carbon policy is here right uh there's there's not that kind of oversight and so it's I can't weigh in on so many things in your life and I'm always happy to have the conversation with you anything the Lord puts on my heart if there's any kind of uh understanding he gives me I'll speak very plainly to you if there's any way that we could talk I'm happy to counsel and talk in those areas but I can speak with this very this Precision about certain things that are God's will for all of us and so when I what I'm emphasizing is not that legalism that rigid compliance but emphasizing let's be in the habit and the manner of doing God's Will and these are things that we know are God's will brother Branham is uh says this in question uh part one of question and answers that same summer he says and you go to church don't set it home go fishing and hunting and things like that on a Sunday you say well I'm not a legalist well you better be in that manner for a while so see how we don't we say well this isn't about being a legalist or just just being really very disciplined but he's saying well you know what maybe you should be maybe you should be well you better be that manner for a while what Manner go into church being a legalist about going to church dishonoring the resurrection of Christ you go to church somewhere so when we are in the discipline of not going to church or the habit of not going to church you're in the habit of dishonoring the Resurrection I said well I don't want to be a legalist what why why plan right why plan disobedience so that you can earn the non-legalist badge right like why plan it so you could be able you know just be like you know I'm just not a legalist we we actually stay out of church um every third Sunday because we just we just don't want to be legalist about this what I mean we this he said this is something we ought to be legalist about be in that manner for a while dishonoring the resurrection of Christ is something we ought to do in Luke chapter 14 verses 1 to 6 I feel compelled to bring this in uh because there's questions these questions are often asked that well I can't be there every service okay you can do that you can beat yourself up over that and other people may beat you yourself over that but you know what's in your heart you know what your desire is you know what your testimony is you know what your manner is and we're not always able to come even shift work we'll change things and circumstances will change and this is kind of I want to bring this in because it's a concept I think we're familiar with Brother Band references in a couple places he says it came to pass as they went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees to eat bread on the Sabbath day that they watched him because it's the Sabbath day and behold there was a certain man before him which had the drop seat and Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees saying is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath day so he's kind of provoking it any like this the nature of Christ is such a paradox I mean here he is just kind of poke hey you guys tell me here's a guy with the drop seat sounds like some of your fantasy football wide receivers here's a guy who's got the dropsy over here and he says is it lawful to heal in the Sabbath I mean he's kind of raising the question and they held their peace and he took him and healed him and let him go and answered them saying which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit I know we say ditch but it's a pit which would have been you know because a ditch is maybe not something they would customarily fall into it but a pit they'd fallen into a pit and will not straightway pull him out on the Sabbath day and they could not answer him again to these things so there was they had an understanding or there was a Grace that was given that under certain circumstances it was lawful to labor and to not it to be to dishonor the Sabbath given the circumstances and this is what Jesus and just his way of provoking thought and bringing this challenge he says I I healed on the Sabbath now legalists the legal should be like oh you're wrong you're wrong you're wrong and he just kind of raised the question is there not a variance do you guys not have a variance that if something comes up and there's some circumstance that you have to attend to which one of you would not pull your Ox out of a pit on the Sabbath day if he fell into it and so this is I believe the balance to the carnal legalism because technically we should be legalist about it brother bam said he says you should better be in that manner for a while and I know maybe I'm taking some Liberty with the phrasing but he says ought to be in the manner and habit of going to church he says and if we want to be legalist about it then maybe that's a good thing to be a legalist about but it's a balance to that carnality sometimes that binds the people and and use it as a way because listen there's some people uh just feel such tremendous Liberty this morning maybe just to share these things there's some people who miss a little bit of church and they then miss church altogether because of the stigma that people put on those when they don't go to church and they miss a little bit and they get a little bit out of practice and because of the churches they've been a part of or the way they've been raised or the way it's always phrased it's like it's better to never go back than it ever is to just try again and I think it's a shame and I would hope that our church could be the type that welcomes Those whom we haven't seen in a while and it's not like oh well where have you been huh right and then know exactly you know it's been 368 days since you've been to church you know there's just a way of hey we all been there before and I could say this with a lot of Grace and I know my wife can testify to this God will put you through things to where you can understand why people go through tail spins and stay out of church not just for a couple weekends but a few years long times because that's just how nasty the devil is and that's just how nasty people profess to be Christians can be towards people that's where they find they're so wounded they're so discombobulated they're so hurt and so scarred toward they they're not even thinking about church they're just thinking about living just think about getting their breath back they're just thinking about uh not suffocating anymore and there's people that go for things and they stay out of church for a while and I believe there ought to be a Grace and there ought to be this understanding of what we're trying what we want to achieve in our own individual lives is a life that's pleasing to the Lord and we know this is part of it and not create a stigma in an atmosphere where it makes it harder for others to do what they need to do to please God there's a Grace if you miss church there's a Grace if you're not able to go there's a grace even if you've missed church for a long time there's Grace if you've been out of church for months there's Grace if you've been out of church for years there's a Grace for it I'm thinking of just the I think it was a um I just remember brother Amos Peterson tell me about it it was a glove commercial Dan Marino was in he said are you sick or no it was a glove commercial he did a glove commercial it was another commercial where Dan Ryan said are you sick and tired of being sick and tired I was like that's me and you know what I'm sick and tired of making other people sick and tired let's encourage one another let's not use the word as a blunt instrument to harm people or to try to you know make other people shorter so that we can feel taller there's a Grace in these things brother management has asked this question and again I think that we ought to be taking the message that we know always take the message that you know the message that's been revealed to you and and make what you hear fit within what we know so there's a lot more to the message than just these quotes he says also this is the second question to the prior question about brother Madam do you teach that only the bride should only go to church if you're preaching otherwise the Tabernacle so this is the second part also do you taste that we need not keep the Sunday or holy days holidays as working fishing or so forth and I I read the question several times even where brother Bannon refers to it again and I think you get the point based upon how he answers it he says now if you're you're away and there's some more here to this question but I'm answering it where he revisits it says now if you're away away into Wilderness somewhere and you're out there on a hunting trip and there's no church around or anything like that and there's nothing you can do and if you was fishing I believe that it would be all right what what is this what is it referring to the legalistic idea that if you're out somewhere on a Sunday and you don't make it to church that's sin right notice how that the legalistic thought would be that if you're not in church that's sin if you're not church that sin and he's looking at this question of well I mean if you're out somewhere hunting or you're not where there's Church he's in I believe that it would be all right and the way he's phrasing it and even what his own discipline was that even if he was somewhere where he could go to church on a Sunday he'd like to go because he so he says this but if you're around in the city or around where church is going on you should attend church by all means somewhere and I believe as far as working I believe the ox is in the ditch or something has to be done on Sundays you go ahead and do it if it's something that you couldn't help it had to work that way but if you just do it and wait till Sunday to do it or just do it like that you're wrong we must not do that we must respect that holy day there's circumstances that cause Believers to work on Sundays there's circumstances that cause Believers to miss church on Sundays there's some that it just happens on a regular interval and I think it would be wrong to establish some a legalist principle that discourages the believer and so you take it into your own heart how these things would impress upon you but what can we say from this go to church it's God's will that we assemble together now I spent a lot more time maybe on that part than I anticipated and so for that I apologize those things I think are important just to rehearse and to be reminded of but where have I've spent most of my time studying on this was from this standpoint I know you're all getting kind of nervous at 11 22 going he's just now getting to the part that he studied that I've been studying for decades now and I got to get it out today but it's looking at a point that's why I could say I don't think there's any debate that we should go to church that we ought to assemble ourselves together think it's clear in the scripture and it's been Amplified hundreds of times in the message of the hour but the part that I tried to consider it's going to be very easy for me to share this with you so I don't feel that there's uh there's a lot a lot of material here to share it's very very simple but the question is well why I'm sure we've all asked ourselves that question a lot of times I was like okay I know it's God's will for this but the why sometimes seems to escape us and I think that's where we need to be very careful in any principle of God but here with respect to going to church why do we assemble why ought we to attend church why is it the first one that's mentioned at least on my slide of the will of God for us this year is a 10 church because it's good for us to consider that because often the context is missing and it's all important to have the context it's absolutely clear that it's God's will for us but why what is his purpose and US assembling and it's right there it's it's staring Us in the face if we could go back to Hebrews chapter 10 verses 24 and 25 and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to Good Works not forsaking the assignment of ourselves together as the manner of some is now there's a lot of rich teaching that we could use to identify what Paul meant by saying as the manner of some is there were some that were forsaken the assembly together whether it because of persecution or whatever the reasons might be Paul is saying despite the persecution despite the hardship despite what others may say it's important that we assemble ourselves together so he's saying gather together and he's telling us he's given us the reasons Paul does not give the Commandment without identifying some function or purpose in doing it does not give the command with it without kind of seeding to us what the reasons might be it's not just Hebrews 10 25 10 25 and go to church and then he moves on to something else it's kind of wrapped in this packaging of let us consider one another to provoke unto love and good works but exhorting one another and so much more as you see the day of protein there's there's meaning given to it there's purpose and sense as to why we assemble ourselves together if it was just merely be sure you get together uh we could do this at different times right in which much greater brevity right because it's just show up we'll be there we're just going to have a parking spot we're just going to be like a food truck right whatever's convenient we're going to be at the in the parking lot of a Home Depot and you just come by and once we get a quorum and enough people have gathered we just all hold hands and sing Kumbaya and then we just dismiss because it's like we gathered we were there we did it but there's more to it than that and I know you're all familiar with all the quotes about if you're and I'm going to paraphrase Elizabeth because I'm a little bit because I'm wanting to kind of aggregate a lot of different thoughts that if you love God or if you're a Christian you'll you love to go to church you'll be there every time the church doors are open right and every time I drive by their clothes so hey hey there's but there's a uh there's so many quotes like that that we could share with you that the real Christian goes to church you love to be in church you love to be there when the doors are open you'll be there every service there's a lot of statements that we can use um that we know that we're familiar with but I went through as many as I possibly could find in searching and reading dozens and dozens and over multiple you know from the beginning of the message to the end trying to find all the different places wherever I said go to church and you ought to go Church you ought to have a home church and you be your posted Duty in all these different places because uh what I wanted to find is what reasons does brother Branham give for this is it always just oh if you're a Christian you love to go to church uh when the church doors are open and that's it and it's kind of in a vacuum and it leaves us to wonder what is it about church like what are we missing and what is it all for but most statements imploring us to go to church or emphasize and attendance give reasons he identifies something in there that's just not questioning whether or not you love God and questioning out whether or not you really want to go to church but it's saying the reason why we do go to church the reason why we want to go to church and and I'm just going to pull a few out because again it's not that there's just uh Decades of sermons that I could unfold from these these things that we studied but brother says I go to church for one thing that's to stay in your presence his presence no place we better come to church to do it is check up with God so we come to church to be in his presence we come into church to check and check up with God he says we come to church we've come for one purpose to Fellowship around the word and these are statements that you'll find that are near or within the context of if you love the Lord you'll go to church and you ought to have home church and you go to church and and these things he's emphasizing he says we we come for one purpose to Fellowship around the word he says to get in there this is why we come to church to get in here to fellowship with your brothers it says one place you to associate with the people who love the Lord like this is there's like this some bigger bigger purpose to this it says in one place to go there you go to church to worship and to go home refreshed you ought to have a clean feeling when you leave church not to be a refreshed feeling when you leave church uh there's it's you don't want you don't want to go to church that leaves a sticky residue when you're done right you want to leave feeling clean and refreshed you want to say yeah I I feel encouraged and not leave going well I thought I was a Christian but at least now I know I'm not a Christian uh but at least I know I want to be a Christian now that I know that I'm not a Christian at least whenever I do become a Christian at least I know I won't be pretending anymore like there should be something that that you're energized and you're refreshed and you're encouraged he says we come here to worship and to go home refreshed and so this is what Paul is this is what's uh part of his teaching in Hebrews 10 24 let us consider one another to provoke unto love and do good works we assemble as a as a means of exhorting one another and I know there's exhortation there's teaching there's preaching that goes forth from the pulpit brother man says church is for the preaching the word we know that Dynamic I believe that it's uh um that is maybe in itself a whole separate uh Avenue of emphasizing why we go to church is because this is God's original way of us receiving Faith this is how we understand God this is how there's so many ways that we could express the preaching Dynamic but it's we come to church he says a symbol consider one another to provoke unto love and do good works not forsaken the semon of ourselves together we have a duty to encourage one another this is so I know that we come to church to be encouraged and when you come to church with the need in your heart and you're coming with a heavy heart because you need your burden lighter you're coming to feel refreshed you're coming to be blessed and you come because you're maybe a little bit selfish and coming but did you know that when you arrive you bless somebody else but you're coming you're like well I'm here to get mine it's like well thanks for coming to get yours right my brother's still my brother Matthew never ceases to remind me that what when he met brother Lucas one time and he said it's good to see you brother Lucas and he says it's good to be seen right and so there's there's this kind of mutual dependency that that we're feeding off of when you come I'm coming because I need something from God and I show up very needy and I'm here because I need to be spoken to but and I see you came with your need and it encourages me because when we gather together there's this there's this Force multiplier that begins to develop there's something that begins to collect together pillars of fire licks of Fire coming together and we're an encouragement to one another you know how it feels I maybe a lot of us in our church experiences haven't had to do this but all right trying to remember maybe the first time well yeah get this you talk about God having a sense of humor one of the first times I ever preached at the church in Texas Christian Life Tabernacle on a Wednesday night one of the first times I preached I think my sermon title was on loneliness or no never alone and there was three people there word must have got out right for the Aaron's preaching at night well where do we go let's drive to Louisiana but I and and so there's you all may remember the times you come to church there's just a few people and it can be discouraging all right but then the more people come and you say well maybe it's if only three people in the church are in the church then you're happy when everyone's there so something about Gathering and people being together in the assignment together there's an encouragement one to another brother Branham says in the message perseverance now if you've got to post a duty you go there and it's how he's imploring the people not to you know he was always very careful that people just wouldn't come to his meeting and forsake their post to duty so he didn't even schedule Sunday morning services in different places he says that's what you're supposed to do always stand at your post of Duty that's your duty to God and to your pastor and to the rest of the congregation so the duty is not just to God but it's also to the church it's to the congregation we have a duty to one about to one another if you could take a summary from what Paul is saying in Hebrews 10 and we have a responsibility to one another to Faithfully Assemble it's not just my responsibility to God but it's my responsibility to you and in that way I think it does kind of change the tenor a little bit of of why we come because sometimes oh well I'm doing this and I'm doing that and we do this we do that but it's for somebody else's benefit this attending church and this is where I think it branches off into a lot of other areas but it promotes the sense of community amongst us as Believers it it establishes our common ground because we have things in common and it's it points to and and I'm going to try to hurry up and finish this as soon as possible it points to the it creates unity and just think about the power of unity of u19 and being of one mind and one Accord assembling together and having the same purpose and the same thought brother I've talked about it just in a church service if everyone could be on the same page and all doubt crossed out he said there wouldn't be a sick person amongst us and so there ought to be momentum building as we get grow as a church and as we have this pattern of assembling together and being like-minded and having the same vision and having the same purpose despite the multiplicities of callings and gifts and envisions that we might have and how it works on our lives that we do have something in common we have a word of God that we're lifting up we have a message that we believe and we have things that we're supporting things that we desire to see together that creates power because we're unified there's common ground brother Brown and the sermon the unwelcome Christ he says you know people who love the Lord they like to go to church because they have things in common we have common grounds for things we come here because we're Believers in this way of worship so it has something to do with recognizing that I'm part of something bigger than just myself the scripture talks about how beautiful it is how pleasant for Brethren to dwell together in unity this is this is part of what we do we dwelt together in unity it's common ground it's there's a basis of Fellowship and I want to close on this thought if you want to turn to Matthew chapter 18 so we'll finish up our text we assemble together not just for the sake of assembling itself God's just not that way God God's intentional God's a god of planning I think I've said this before that men climb Mount Everest just for the sake of climbing Mount Everest but if God ever climbs a mountain he's got a reason for doing it Beyond climbing the mountain but there's so much this is what I want to close with the thought of just how much this there's it's a assembling together is a source the source of strength a a source of power in Matthew chapter 18 verses 18 to 20 verily I send you whatsoever ye shall bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven whatsoever ye shall lose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven again I say unto you that if two of you shall agree on Earth as touching anything that they shall ask it shall be done for them of My Father which is in heaven this comes right after he said he's talking about bringing something to the church right in verse 17 how he told us you take it to the church if he does not hear you then then bring tell it unto the church that they neglect to hear of the church let it be as a heathen so he's brought into mind this assembling this relationship of brothers and sisters and whatsoever ye shall bind whatsoever ye shall lose whatever you agree on Earth is touching anything that you shall ask it shall be done for them of My Father which is in heaven for where two or three are gathered together in my name there am I in the midst of them one of the most common scriptures that we use of these assemblies one of the most common scriptures we use for our gathering together here is where two or three are gathered together in my name that's why we invoke his name when we open the Service in prayer that's why we praise His name when we worship because it's not just a gathering in vain but it's a gathering in his name and not just in the Church of Christ or the Church of Jesus Christ in a name only but it's something that's in harmony with this character it's something that aligns with his vision it's something that we know is his will for us and he says where two or three are gathered together in my name there am I in the midst of them so The Gather in a church where brother Madam says and wherever they meet that's the church it's not just a gathering of Believers but it's also a gathering together unto him it's where we know that he will be in our midst and I know that he's with you in your homes and I know that you experience his presence in your car and we've seen him move on the scene in many many other different places and God is Sovereign and God does that and he visits us in our prayer closet he visits us in our family devotions he visits us when we're doing domestic labors and visits us on the job site God is an ever-present God and this is one place that he's also present in and it's one place where we can have the history and the experience of Time After Time After Time After Time God meets us here and always know that when these Church doors are unlocked and we're having service we do it to invite his presence so that Jesus can be in the midst of us we're not just doing it so we can say well we're Believers and that's what believers do no Believers seek Christ where the fresh kill is where the man is where the word is where Christ is where the body word of the son of man is there where the Eagles be gathered together that's why you're here this morning is because you're wanting to gather around the things of Christ and feed on Christ [Music] maybe there's a lot more comfortable places we could go maybe there's a lot different things we could do and we could just purpose in our heart that as a group we're going to visit every state park in the state of Arizona this year but what we want to do is gather around the things of God and what we do is we gather around the things of God brother Branham in the sermon why Christ speaks as We Gather here for Spiritual strength we need it Lord we must have strength to endure the crosses that we bear these are one of the statements I came across in Reading trying to read in the message of why do we assemble I get it and I I go so far as to say this even if I never knew the why it's so clear in the word of God that we should go to church that I would just go to church knowing that one day I'll know why it's that clear but I studied it with the eye of Lord I want to see the reasons you give I want to know and maybe there's a maybe I'm leaving a lot to be desired but maybe these are things you can go in and find because there's so much more we can identify but this is one I came across We Gather here for Spiritual strength That's What We Gather for we need strength to endure the crosses that we bear I know you've heard this one before if you don't have a church you must see you'll die spiritually you'll just dwindle away now I know that what we when we think about that we think about the dwindling right where there's no vision that people perish so we think about the absence of vision and the perishing of the people when we think about if you don't have a church you just dwindle away spiritually and die and and that's what we imagine but we got to invert right invert always invert so the inverse is the Pow we look at the the power of church and it speaks more about the power of assembling than it does anything it doesn't necessarily speak to the corrupting nature of being out of the house of God as much as it speaks about the preserving nature of being in the house of God it's not the power to corrupt that bears upon you when you get out from under when you're no longer going to church it's you're away from your source of life it's more a stagnating it's more of just growing cold it's more of just dwindling away and withering away whereas if you stay in the presence of God then there's a strength and vitality and a refreshing that comes and so it speaks more to the power of assembling than it does the the negativity of not doing it so that that ought to be the drawing cars I I don't want to I better go to church because I don't want to dwindle away and die no I I'm going to church to get sustenance to get strength to get if the spiritual vitamins the things that I need in order to strengthen myself and carry myself through the work that I have to do he says you'll die spiritually you'll just dwindle dwindle away I'm going to quote Saint Ignatius for you brother Ignatius to some of you it says when you frequently and in numbers meet together the powers of Satan are overthrown and his Mischief is neutralized by your like-mindedness in the faith I like that should we put that on a plaque and rub it when we come in speaking of traditions when you frequently and in numbers meet together the powers of Satan are overthrown and his Mischief is neutralized by your like-mindedness in the faith we're neutralizing Satan's mischievousness today through our like-mindedness of faith when you gather frequently and in numbers the powers of Satan are overthrown I want you to purpose in your heart that every time you walk through those doors we're going to have a different doorway effect the powers of Satan are being overthrown I'm going to church with the purpose of over having the powers of Satan over them his mischievousness that he's trying to work in my life all the little Mischief he's doing all the little traps all the little things he's doing I'm going to church to expose his schemes I'm going to church to to thwart his plans I'm going to church to neutralize Satan against me my final thought for you is revisiting verse 25 of Hebrews 10. 25 he says not forsakening the semen of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another in so much the more as you see the day approaching and notice how Paul then caps this whole thought off and I think it's this there's a lot more maybe in the context he's building it in but we don't forsake the semen of ourselves together but We Gather in order to provoke one another unto love and do good work so our gathering is to provoke good works our gathering is to provoke one another to love there's a there's a way that we're gathering together in such a way to see that we're inspiring this Gathering encourages and fosters love it gives opportunity to inspire to Good Works we do it because not only am I dependent upon you but I recognize you're dependent upon me there's this Mutual dependency that you're not codependent on me that we do not want a code dependency that creates the wrong kind of Dynamics and nor am I code dependent upon you but we're mutually dependent upon one another and we all view one another that way there's not a caste system in the Church of Christ there's not a there's not a hierarchy of you know levels and clicks to where certain people have these different uh places in terms of privilege and opportunity there's a there's a there's a common ground that we all share in Christ and We Gather to encourage love to Foster love to inspire one another the good works there's a reason why we're Gathering there's a purpose to it it's not just to check the box and then he says that we're exhorting one another and whether you want to say the Gathering or the exhortation is the much more but if it is the exhortation then it requires the Gathering and if it's the Gathering it requires the exhortation so now how you diagram this sentence it says and so much the more as you see the day approaching why would it be that we would have less assembly the closer we get to the rapture when brother Brandon even takes it to in the angle of that the later that gets the more assembling we ought to have or the more exhortation we ought to have but it's done with the day in mind decembering they gathered together the church is done with the day in mind what's the day the consummation the rapture we Assemble with the Rapture in view oh and as as the more as the day approaches so our gathering should always be with the mind to that day that it's never done absent that context and and if you read the New Testament all the writers were seemingly aware of that day this is the end and they had this there was this imminence there was this thought that we're Gathering because there's a consummation we're Gathering because there's going to be an end I think that there's a there's something missing whether we're Consciousness conscious about it or not there would be something missing or maybe this is the part that's missing in our church experience when we divorce this activity from the finality of the change that if we don't realize that every time I come in some ways something is being added to the translation when I come something in some way has moved the needle just another step further to the change and so I come and we exhort and we preach and we encourage one another unto love and the good works not just so that we can keep this going in perpetuity so that our children's children can have church but we're doing it so that we can get out of here and we're doing it with a day in mind and that changes everything and I thought the part that just so blessed me this past week and studying this I I never connected these things together but just in studying this scripture of assembling in the church and this thought of the church when we assemble every time we assemble we're very familiar with the concept that we're honoring the resurrection Billy Branham even says dishonoring ought to be in the legalist about it or ought to be in that manner for some time dishonoring the resurrection We Gather on a Sunday not the Saturday We Gather on a Sunday and what it's honoring the resurrection every Sunday there's an honor to what has been passed but also not only are we honoring the resurrection past but every time we assemble we're in the image of the Resurrection to come every time we gather together we are gathering in the image of that Gathering or that assembly unto the Lord in the air that's what it represents today anybody here between the ages of 18 and 21 anybody I knew we had like an age group that was missing there's no one here today between 18 and 21. is there any way we can cut that out of the the video I hear that's why people go to church these days right it's just a just because there's a youth group foreign but if I did if we did have anybody in there I'd have them stand but did you know you're all just as close to 18 to 21 as anybody else brother Dale you and I are just just as close to 18 as Elliot is right but that's that gathering in the air every time we Assemble it's a gathering that's in the image of the ultimate Gathering and this word not forsaken the assignment of ourselves together it's used in one other place this conjugation this exact phrasing and she used in second Thessalonians chapter 2 verse 1. I meant to include this one brother John I don't believe I did I include second I didn't think so I left out the the several things at the end just so I could have a little bit more Liberty and emphasis but in second Thessalonians chapter 2 verse one now we beseech you Brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by our gathering together unto him it is understood that Paul is referring to that gathering in the air the meeting in the air at the time of the resurrection and the change of our bodies where we will all be assembled as one great glorified body of Christ to the glorified Christ in the air that meeting in the air that triumphant Rapture that culmination of putting death under our feet he says I beseech you brother by the coming of our Lord Jesus and by our gathering together unto him and that's the image that's Gathering Together the assembling together the church meeting him in the bride meaning in the air but that's what we do every time that we have church that we come and he says there where two or three are gathered together in my name there am I in the midst of them and it's our gathering together unto him in a spiritual sense and that would be in a very that would be in a literal sense but this is a gathering to him in a spiritual sense This Is Us coming together around our mate the revealed word and that our gathering together in him is the assembly in the air that that's what we're all looking for that's the day we're looking for that's the the day we desire for us all to be together now brother ma'am uses this terminology a lot he says that if you if you don't like it loud here if you don't like shouting here you're not going to like it over there right and if you don't like assembly now hello come on somebody right if you don't like assembly now then you don't want to be there all right I just don't do good in crowds well you're not gonna like it there you're not going to have a lot of luck because it's going to be a lot in hell too right like if you don't want crowds you're in trouble and so this is the only place you're going to be lonely but this is this is what we got I want you to keep this image in your mind I'll invite the musicians to come now that this is something that you could keep in your mind that when we assemble it's in the image of that assembly and if and that image we're all healed and that image were all perfect and that image were all strong in that image there's no fear in that image there's no doubt in that image it's all all rated and goreful and Powerful then that's what this assembly holds the potential of and just think of what Paul meant when he gets set and used these very words that we ought to assemble ourselves together as that day approaches the more what a beautiful powerful reflection we are testifying today of that ultimate assembly [Music] and that's why we assemble ourselves together that's why we're here this morning
