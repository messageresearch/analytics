[0:00] 1 Peter chapter 1 and we're I maybe for
[0:04] time sake we'll just start with verse
[0:06] three and we know that Peter is
[0:08] addressing the elect of God and he says
[0:11] Blessed Be verse three blessed be the
[0:13] God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[0:15] which according to His abundant Mercy
[0:18] hath begotten us again unto a lively
[0:20] Hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[0:23] from the dead so born again quickened
[0:26] and there's this living expectation to
[0:28] an inheritance incorruptible and
[0:30] undefiled that fadeth not away reserved
[0:33] in heaven for you who are kept by the
[0:35] power of God through faith unto
[0:38] salvation ready to be revealed in the
[0:40] last time where wherein ye greatly
[0:43] Rejoice though now for a season if need
[0:45] be you are in heaviness through manifold
[0:48] temptations that the trial of your faith
[0:50] being much more precious than of gold
[0:52] that perisheth though it be tried with
[0:54] fire might be found unto praise and
[0:56] honor and Glory at the appearing of
[0:59] Jesus Christ again there's this looking
[1:00] forward to this expectation whom having
[1:03] not seen you love and whom though now
[1:05] you see him not yet believing ye Rejoice
[1:08] with joy unspeakable and full of Glory
[1:11] receiving the end of your faith even the
[1:13] salvation of your souls of which
[1:15] salvation the prophets have inquired and
[1:17] searched diligently who prophesied of
[1:19] the grace that should come unto you
[1:21] searching what or what manner of time
[1:23] the spirit of Christ which was in them
[1:25] did signify when it testified beforehand
[1:28] the sufferings of Christ and the glory
[1:30] that should follow unto whom it was
[1:32] revealed that not unto themselves but
[1:34] unto us they did Minister the things
[1:36] which are now reported unto you by them
[1:38] that have preached the gospel unto you
[1:40] with the Holy Ghost sent down from
[1:42] heaven which things the Angels desire to
[1:45] look into now there's a lot lot there
[1:48] it's actually a very lengthy uh uh
[1:50] sentence and or scripture there these
[1:52] are things passed and present for him
[1:54] now he begins to look forward and he
[1:56] says wherefore gir up the loin of your
[1:58] mind be sober and hope to the end
[2:00] for the grace that is to be brought unto
[2:02] you at the revelation of Jesus Christ as
[2:05] obedient children not fashioning
[2:06] yourselves according to the former lust
[2:08] and your ignorance but as he which hath
[2:10] called you is Holy so be ye holy in all
[2:13] manner of conversation because it is
[2:15] written be you holy for I am Holy amen
[2:20] praise the Lord you can take your
[2:24] seats the title of my sermon this
[2:26] evening is 21st century Christ
[2:30] and uh
[2:32] it's I think even maybe just in thinking
[2:35] about it now myself it may be just
[2:36] somewhat self-explanatory but 21st
[2:40] century Christ and before we get going I
[2:42] will say that my my train of thought
[2:44] tonight will be may seem very singular
[2:47] uh if not just very simple but there are
[2:49] several layers or themes that kind of
[2:52] track or be layered on top of each other
[2:54] that are running through these many
[2:55] different scriptures that we're going to
[2:57] be looking at so uh there may be
[2:59] something that comes up in one scripture
[3:01] and kind of hold on to that because as
[3:03] we go into the next scripture you might
[3:04] find that even though the emphasis seems
[3:07] to be something else this just builds
[3:08] right into it and so there's a lot of
[3:11] things that connect together and there's
[3:13] a lot of ways that we could amplify it
[3:15] and just uh broaden the scope of the
[3:17] sermon even the length of it but we
[3:19] don't want to do that so I just
[3:20] encourage you to concentrate and ask God
[3:22] to make some of these connections and
[3:24] give you understanding as we go forward
[3:26] because there's just a lot of things
[3:27] that connect together even though it may
[3:29] seem very uh singular and very simple
[3:33] but keep this in mind that we're
[3:34] preaching tonight on a 21st century
[3:36] Christ the century we're living in now a
[3:39] Christ of today now if you'll turn to
[3:41] Titus chap 2: 11 and
[3:44] 12 like to start with this scripture and
[3:47] it was where we were last Wednesday it
[3:48] says for the grace of God that bringeth
[3:51] salvation hath appeared to all men
[3:53] teaching us that denying ungodliness and
[3:56] worldly lust we should live soberly
[3:59] righteously and godly in this present
[4:02] world if I could put it this way the
[4:04] revelation of Jesus Christ teaches us
[4:07] how to live in the world that we exist
[4:10] within it's not going to tell us how to
[4:11] live in a day gone by it's not necessar
[4:13] going to tell us how to live in the
[4:14] Future IT addresses Us in the present
[4:16] tense as Peter's the one that says that
[4:18] you should be established in the present
[4:21] truth not a historical God and the laws
[4:24] of the Old Testament and the ways of the
[4:25] children of Israel in The Exodus or in
[4:28] the temple but rather the present truth
[4:31] and so he uh Titus is saying that or
[4:33] Paul writing to Titus says that this
[4:36] Revelation that comes will teach us to
[4:39] live in the world that we exist within
[4:43] and as we read in 1 Peter chapter 1 I'd
[4:45] like to read verses 5 and 13 and we know
[4:48] that these scriptures speak to an end
[4:50] time prophecy it's the time that we're
[4:52] living in now to those who have been
[4:54] begotten again into a lively hope those
[4:57] who are the elect of God who have been
[4:59] Born Again by the baptism of the Holy
[5:01] Ghost are kept by the power of God
[5:04] through faith so it's that grace through
[5:06] faith that we heard about on Sunday unto
[5:09] salvation now this isn't uh the
[5:11] salvation of the Soul because we are
[5:13] already quickened there's this
[5:15] Deliverance of finality ready to be
[5:17] revealed in the last time so I'm using
[5:21] these scriptures just to kind of Orient
[5:22] all of us to the fact that we're living
[5:24] in an age when there is an end time
[5:26] salvation that has been revealed and you
[5:29] could look into do the word of God and
[5:31] see there's different layers to that
[5:32] especially in a Third Exodus but there's
[5:34] a Salvation to be revealed and Peter
[5:38] revisits this theme of a faith uh this
[5:41] being kept unto a Salvation to be
[5:44] revealed in the last time and he says it
[5:45] this way in verse 13 wherefore gird up
[5:48] the loins of your mind be sober and hope
[5:52] now again as as Paul wrote it to Titus
[5:55] he said there's a Grace that brings
[5:57] Salvation And it teaches us to live so
[5:59] soberly righteously and godly Peter is
[6:01] saying that we should uh G up the loins
[6:04] of our mind be sober and hope to the end
[6:06] for the grace that is to be brought unto
[6:10] you at the revelation of Jesus Christ
[6:13] the revelation of Jesus Christ brings a
[6:15] specific dispensation of of Salvation a
[6:18] Rapture a body change all those things
[6:20] that we could use to describe the season
[6:23] that we're in now and how I'd like to
[6:25] say it this way just to summarize I feel
[6:27] like I'm just kind of pointing to a
[6:28] subject that's very fast and say that
[6:30] Jesus Christ is unfolding himself to us
[6:33] today we believe that I believe that I
[6:36] trust that you do too and that a Grace
[6:38] has been brought to us there's a
[6:41] Salvation that is unfolding we're
[6:43] feeding on the word of God and it's
[6:44] going to lead us to our unseen
[6:45] bridegroom so there's this season this
[6:47] time and this dispensation where Jesus
[6:50] Christ has is being revealed there's
[6:53] this Capstone um Revelation that's
[6:56] coming in this end time and those are
[6:57] themes from Christ as a mystery H and
[7:00] those different things so if we look at
[7:01] it what Paul is writing and even what
[7:05] Peter is writing Grace teaches us says
[7:08] that for the grace of God that bringeth
[7:09] salvation hath appeared to all men
[7:11] teaching us well if there's a Grace that
[7:14] has been brought to us at the revelation
[7:15] of Jesus Christ in this hour if there's
[7:18] been a headstone that's been introduced
[7:19] with that double Grace Grace Grace then
[7:22] it's the same Grace in the end that's
[7:25] teaching and what it does is it teaches
[7:27] us how to live in our present world as
[7:30] it says teaching us how to live in this
[7:33] present world that's the 21st century I
[7:37] don't know if people fantasize here
[7:38] about days gone by and what century
[7:40] they'd want to live in uh I found one of
[7:42] the most extraordinary things in
[7:44] fatherhood is the type types of
[7:45] questions you get asked on a daily basis
[7:48] that relate to things you would have
[7:49] never thought of uh in terms of what
[7:52] your favorite is and if you could live
[7:53] in any particular decade or whatever it
[7:55] might be or asked a lot of questions and
[7:58] it's it's fun fod to talk about but we
[8:00] live now in the 21st century we know
[8:02] that we've entered a new year it's 2025
[8:05] and the best way to make this timelist
[8:07] is we can say you live in the now you
[8:10] can't live in yesterday and you can't
[8:11] live in the future though there's some
[8:13] people we know who appear to be living
[8:14] in the future with all the things they
[8:16] get to enjoy and do and the technology
[8:18] have but we live in a present tense and
[8:21] this is one of those things that you
[8:23] could put off to the side and say this
[8:24] is a this is a paradigm that you can
[8:26] view everything I'm saying in uh tonight
[8:29] in terms of a theme but we live in the
[8:31] present tense and there's a past and
[8:33] there's a future and there's ways that
[8:35] these things work together where we
[8:37] can't just completely Deni the past
[8:39] because in the past is a great cloud of
[8:40] witnesses that compel us to go forward
[8:42] there's things that we should learn from
[8:44] in our past there's things in our past
[8:45] that have been Stakes driven down
[8:47] there's a great Foundation a and and yet
[8:50] there's a we can't just disregard the
[8:52] future because there's decisions you're
[8:53] making right now that are going to
[8:55] impact your future so we are
[8:57] forward-looking but we live in the
[8:59] present tense and there is a Grace
[9:02] that's been brought to us a Grace that
[9:03] has been extended there's this
[9:05] incredible dispensation of the word of
[9:07] God which is characterized by this grace
[9:09] and and so many beautiful themes in the
[9:11] scripture but this Grace does not exempt
[9:14] us from living as Titus it says in Titus
[9:17] soberly righteously and godly in this
[9:21] world cannot view the work of God in our
[9:24] lives as there is a Salvation of the
[9:26] Soul we just want to hang on till we get
[9:28] out of here and then once we get into
[9:29] that other realm when the devil's Bound
[9:31] by a chain of circumstance or once hell
[9:33] and every all sin is cast in Lake of
[9:35] Fire then we'll be able to kind of live
[9:37] above the things of the world we need to
[9:39] learn now how to live soberly
[9:41] righteously and godly in this world and
[9:44] so what Grace does is it shows us how to
[9:46] deny ungodliness shows us how to deny or
[9:49] say no to worldly lust so that we can be
[9:53] in the world but at the same time be
[9:55] distinct from
[9:57] it and again there's
[9:59] we are aliens we're pilgrims we're
[10:01] strangers but we're all clearly human
[10:04] we're just we're that and it's that it's
[10:06] that Humanity that makes us truly such a
[10:09] wonderful display of the gospel because
[10:11] if we were just literally aliens from
[10:14] another realm and another planet
[10:16] everybody just be all of us right they
[10:18] just be like well what do you eat and
[10:19] how do you do this and how do you do
[10:20] that how did you get here and though
[10:22] there'd be this identity that yeah
[10:23] you're completely foreign but what is it
[10:25] that makes the Christian so
[10:27] extraordinary and so Supernatural is
[10:29] they appear the same as everyone else
[10:33] and so there is this challenge to where
[10:35] we have to learn how to live soberly
[10:38] righteously and godly in this world and
[10:40] in order to do that we have to deny or
[10:42] say no to ungodliness we have to reject
[10:45] worldly lust so that we can still exist
[10:48] within the world and be distinct from
[10:51] it
[10:53] now I I hope this doesn't seem to be too
[10:55] much of a Interruption here but much
[10:58] attention and I I think even last year
[11:00] we we labored on this particular thought
[11:03] a lot but there's much attention that's
[11:04] given to the works of Christ when I say
[11:07] the works of Christ specific instances
[11:09] in which the Supernatural is performed
[11:11] whether it be the deaf here or the dumb
[11:13] speaking and so there's a lot of uh
[11:16] knowledge of an emphasis on uh The Works
[11:19] of Christ and the gospels and then
[11:21] subsequently there's a lot of emphasis
[11:23] on the Acts of the Apostles in the book
[11:26] of Acts and we know and are rightly
[11:28] taught that when the if the tree ever
[11:30] puts forth another Branch it'll write
[11:32] another book of Acts because those are
[11:34] the acts of the holy spirit that Christ
[11:37] to was in those gospels and Performing
[11:39] things he gave this promise to the
[11:40] church the same works that I do shall
[11:42] you do also so there are these works
[11:46] that we are to do by the life and the
[11:48] nature of the holy spirit that works
[11:50] within the believer and the church and
[11:53] there should be no effort whatsoever
[11:56] exerted to diminish these Deeds there
[11:59] should should be no effort to uh
[12:01] diminish them or qualify them or reduce
[12:03] them down to something else or undermine
[12:05] their Supernatural origin they are the
[12:07] works of Christ they are Supernatural
[12:09] they're the acts of the Holy Spirit and
[12:12] we shouldn't comb through the gospels of
[12:13] the book of Acts say well they didn't
[12:14] really do this and Peter getting out of
[12:16] the jail there's a simple explanation
[12:18] and all these and there should be no
[12:20] trifling with it there should be no
[12:22] diminishing in it and certainly I would
[12:24] not uh reduce my expectations to say
[12:28] that God couldn't do the same thing
[12:30] today I would believe for all those
[12:32] things I would believe for miracles I
[12:34] would believe for Supernatural things to
[12:36] the point to where I would believe that
[12:38] if I was in a situation that seemed
[12:40] impossible to get out of God could just
[12:41] make a
[12:42] way and Oh I thought this happened we
[12:45] thought that happened God is able to do
[12:46] the same things
[12:48] today and and and we should never we
[12:52] should
[12:53] never uh diminish those
[12:56] things and and I'm not going to say but
[13:00] and start to diminish it what I will say
[13:02] is consideration should be given in all
[13:05] those things to the nature and character
[13:07] of God who's performing those
[13:09] things what his purposes were and what
[13:12] his intent was as you go through the
[13:14] gospels and as you go to the book of
[13:16] Acts you'll find that in performing
[13:18] these Miracles and doing these things
[13:20] often times Jesus would relate it to
[13:22] some point or something that was being
[13:24] expressed and there's this Awakening to
[13:26] the Supernatural and there is uh God has
[13:29] a pattern of giving a sign and catching
[13:32] people's attention through the
[13:33] Supernatural and it's not so that they
[13:35] could then hunger for the bread that has
[13:37] been created out of nothing or that they
[13:39] could desire to see the Miracles but
[13:41] they could truly hear his voice and
[13:43] believe for the promise of that hour
[13:46] that all the signs and wonders and
[13:48] miracles were trying to get our
[13:49] attention to see so there are certain
[13:51] purposes and intent whenever God moves
[13:54] whenever God does something there's
[13:56] times when people will witness and
[13:58] experience the supernatural and they'll
[13:59] see it happen in a church service and
[14:01] they'll testify oh I saw this happen I
[14:03] saw that happen and this is very
[14:05] specific thing was done or the pillar
[14:07] Fire w was over the pulpit and these
[14:09] things happen and I would never doubt
[14:11] that if I was you people say that
[14:13] happens and as a and when that when
[14:16] anyone's ever shared that with me I said
[14:17] that that should get your attention that
[14:19] God's mindful of
[14:20] you that if anything is Vindicated it's
[14:23] not the one on the platform whom they s
[14:25] thought they saw the pillar fire over
[14:26] but rather God was trying to show you
[14:28] he's mindful of you he's speaking to you
[14:31] he has you in mind and there's some
[14:33] connection that you begin to make to the
[14:34] word not like ooh there's a sign that
[14:36] guy must be a good preacher there's an
[14:39] intent and a purpose that God is trying
[14:41] to
[14:42] achieve as we are using the subject of
[14:45] art this year on at least through this
[14:48] beginning of the year uh to look at
[14:50] different themes in the Bible uh pay
[14:53] attention because this is going to sound
[14:54] like I don't know what I'm talking about
[14:55] but there's a difference between a work
[14:56] of art and the work of art
[14:59] see what I did there that there's a
[15:01] difference between that which is
[15:03] produced which would be a work of art
[15:05] and that which is the process or skill
[15:07] of creating art and there is if I could
[15:11] put it this way just to maybe not get
[15:12] bogged down here as anyone can admire a
[15:15] painting and and read a book or listen
[15:17] to a
[15:18] composition and and and that's something
[15:21] that anyone could do I was thinking of
[15:23] it this way that you know anyone can eat
[15:25] but not anyone could cook and so chef
[15:28] gustau sent me a text message and said a
[15:31] contr that anyone can cook and well I
[15:33] just might take the side of the food
[15:35] critic Anton ego that it's not that
[15:37] anyone could cook or that anyone can be
[15:39] a great artist but that a great artist
[15:41] can come from
[15:43] anywhere should I quote brother Remy too
[15:45] at the same
[15:47] time and that's to me I think just to
[15:51] maybe we're getting all on the same page
[15:52] here is quote Ratatouille but there's
[15:56] this thought that there's certain things
[15:57] that anyone can enjoy in that we can all
[15:59] enjoy on some common level reading
[16:01] listening I can appreciate this I can
[16:03] view this I can eat but I can't cook or
[16:05] or there's this uh uh things that are
[16:09] produced that we can all enjoy but can
[16:10] we all produce the same thing can we all
[16:13] bring the same thing
[16:14] forth and so anyone could admire a
[16:17] painting read a book or listen to a
[16:18] composition but there's a difference in
[16:20] knowing the mind of the artist there's a
[16:22] difference in understanding the motive
[16:24] and and perceiving the intent or or
[16:26] being even inspired there's many things
[16:29] that we could all look at and be like
[16:31] that is beautiful there's things we
[16:33] could read and say that was really good
[16:35] there's things that we could listen to
[16:36] and say man I I love that the
[16:39] combination of movements and those
[16:40] different things this is but there's a
[16:42] level too where you begin to connect
[16:44] with something and it actually inspires
[16:45] you I think that should warn us too of
[16:48] how there's different influences and
[16:50] things in the world that can cause you
[16:51] to be moved and inspired and it's coming
[16:53] from a very dark place but there can be
[16:56] a work of art the thing that is created
[16:59] or produced the thing that is seen or
[17:01] enjoyed but then there's also the work
[17:04] of art which is the process or skill
[17:07] that is the creating the the creation
[17:10] and the Creator behind
[17:12] that and as we want to as I'm wanting to
[17:16] look at that idea or that the
[17:20] process and not just the product and the
[17:23] works of Christ and the Acts of the
[17:25] Apostles that we could we could
[17:27] delineate and say these things are
[17:29] Supernatural but what is God's purpose
[17:31] what is his intent what is it that's
[17:32] being expressed if these are the things
[17:34] that he does maybe I'll even go back to
[17:36] the beginning of last year that what
[17:38] what do these things tell us about what
[17:40] God
[17:42] values what does this telling us about
[17:44] the nature and character of God now I
[17:47] want to use these scriptures several of
[17:48] them in just one scenario really to make
[17:51] this point or one particular theme
[17:53] through several different places but in
[17:55] Hebrews chapter 3 I'm going to be
[17:57] reading uh and if you could turn there
[18:00] in your Bibles anybody who brought their
[18:01] Bibles just turn there so you could see
[18:02] this I want to read in Hebrews chapter 7
[18:06] and I want to read verses and I want to
[18:08] so I will I will be reading from verse 7
[18:11] to verse 14 and I'm going to read it in
[18:13] a unique way I'm going to take what he
[18:17] begins to say in verse 7 and then leave
[18:19] out the parenthetical phrase or those
[18:21] things that are in the parenthesis in
[18:22] the preceding verses and pick it back up
[18:25] where he again later after the
[18:32] parenthesis did I see Hebrews chapter 7
[18:35] see I just seen if you guys are pay
[18:37] attention what I meant was Hebrews
[18:41] chapter 3 verse 7 3 *
[18:44] 7 and so verse seven is where I'm going
[18:47] to begin and I'm just going to use the
[18:48] wherefore and then I'm going to jump
[18:50] down to the beginning of verse 12 so I'm
[18:53] just going to read this part together
[18:55] wherefore take heed Brethren lest there
[18:57] be in any of you an evil heart of
[19:03] unbelief in departing from the Living
[19:06] God but exhort one another daily while
[19:09] it is called today lest any of you be
[19:12] hardened through the deceitfulness of
[19:13] sin for we are made partakers of Christ
[19:17] if we hold the beginning of our
[19:18] confidence steadfast unto the end I find
[19:23] that these themes that Paul is uh
[19:25] sharing in this book of Hebrews are very
[19:27] weighty very heavy a lot of things I
[19:29] find myself really chewing on that take
[19:31] heed lest there be an evil heart of
[19:33] unbelief and that would cause us to uh
[19:36] lose uh uh you know that we we can lose
[19:40] if we don't hold fast our confidence
[19:41] into the end so there's a lot there that
[19:43] gets our attention and Paul is very
[19:45] clearly warning of apostasy or which
[19:47] means that Falling Away From the Living
[19:50] God and this is distinct from these dead
[19:52] idols and things that have no life it's
[19:54] a reality from this reality of God and
[19:57] he says to exhort and encourage one
[19:59] another to Divine things to the nature
[20:01] and character of Christ that there
[20:03] should be this uh encouragement while it
[20:06] is day do it daily while it is today the
[20:10] present tense do it presently the now
[20:12] this day of life where you're living
[20:15] because as we all know tomorrow is the
[20:17] devil's
[20:18] day it's it's when we we put off
[20:21] everything till tomorrow and let it
[20:22] happen tomorrow wait till tomorrow well
[20:24] there is a a there's a way of saying
[20:28] that we never actually will live
[20:29] tomorrow you can only live today it may
[20:31] seem to be a clever play on words but
[20:33] the reality is that there uh that the
[20:37] only way that you can truly be living is
[20:39] if it's in the present
[20:41] tense and there is
[20:44] a exhorting one another daily while it
[20:47] is called today today it means the right
[20:50] now the the day of
[20:52] life and if I could say it this way I
[20:54] want you to begin to recognize how Paul
[20:56] is using this the way he's using is I
[20:59] think it's just a a very incredible way
[21:00] that he just lays it all out but there's
[21:03] a learning from yesterday in order to
[21:05] live today and this is what he's going
[21:07] to do he's going to use an example from
[21:08] yesterday in order to learn how to live
[21:10] today so that we can enter into a
[21:13] forever or that we could determine our
[21:16] condition in forever so Paul is going to
[21:19] draw from the past he's saying wherefore
[21:22] take heed and when I say wherefore
[21:23] there's this insert and then he picks it
[21:26] back up take heed Brethren uh that you
[21:29] exhort one another daily while it is
[21:31] today and now he points he's pointing to
[21:33] the past so let's start over again with
[21:35] verse 7 H as the Holy Ghost saith now
[21:39] this is Paul's example he's using to
[21:41] make his point about what we should be
[21:42] doing daily as the Holy Ghost say today
[21:46] if you will hear his voice hear his
[21:48] voice in the now hear his voice today
[21:51] not a glare of another age not a a
[21:53] promise of tomorrow but his voice today
[21:55] Harden not your hearts as in the
[21:57] provocation in the day of Temptation in
[21:59] the wilderness when your fathers tempted
[22:02] me proved me now Paul says as the Holy
[22:05] Ghost saith so there's some inspiration
[22:07] that the Holy Ghost has given previously
[22:09] and he says in the wilderness so that
[22:10] orients the Hebrew to the past and to
[22:12] The Exodus your fathers tempted me those
[22:15] are their forefathers those are the
[22:17] tribe tribes in the past proved me and
[22:19] saw my works for 40 years so these saw
[22:22] his Works wherefore I was grieved with
[22:24] that generation and said they do always
[22:26] he in their heart and they have not
[22:27] known my way so I swear in my wrath they
[22:30] shall not enter into my rest Paul is
[22:33] saying to them in the present at that
[22:36] day that they should exhort one another
[22:39] daily while it is
[22:40] today lest something happen in the
[22:43] future and he uses the past as his
[22:46] example that he wants to draw from and
[22:49] so there is this example in The Exodus
[22:51] where they Harden their hearts and God
[22:53] said because of you not listening to my
[22:55] voice today I'm going to make a decision
[22:57] about your future
[23:00] and what he is drawing from here you'll
[23:02] find I just I just love how
[23:06] uh just multifaceted this becomes I
[23:08] don't know if this is meta or how how we
[23:10] might describe it but then he's actually
[23:12] quoting from Psalms 97 excuse me Psalms
[23:15] 95 I can't get my numbers right but at
[23:18] least they're threes fives and sevens
[23:21] Glory Psalms 95:
[23:26] 7-1 he says for he is our good God and
[23:29] we are the people of his pasture and the
[23:31] Sheep of his hand today if you will hear
[23:33] his voice now notice how familiar this
[23:36] is and what Paul has quoted in Hebrews
[23:38] chapter 3: 7 to 11 he has quoted
[23:42] from this Psalm 95 today if you'll hear
[23:46] his voice Harden not your heart as in
[23:48] the provocation as in the day of
[23:49] Temptation in the wilderness it's almost
[23:51] word for word when your fathers tempted
[23:53] me proved me and saw my work Paul kind
[23:57] of amplifies it saw my my works for 40
[23:59] years they seen him do things and deeds
[24:01] and wonders and signs and miracles today
[24:03] hear my
[24:04] voice unless except unless your heart so
[24:07] that your heart is not hardened as your
[24:09] fathers were when they saw my Works
[24:11] verse 10 40 years long was I grieved
[24:13] with this generation and said it is a
[24:15] people that do error in their heart and
[24:17] they have not known my ways unto whom I
[24:18] swear in my wrath that they should not
[24:20] enter into my
[24:22] rest so what's happening in Psalms 95 as
[24:25] I read it is David is using the Exodus
[24:28] which for David at that time is the
[24:29] yesterday to admonish and exhort Israel
[24:32] in their today warning them of what
[24:35] their future will be if they don't
[24:37] listen in the now so David in Psalm 95
[24:41] is telling the Israel today hear his
[24:44] voice and don't Harden your heart like
[24:46] they did yesterday and when they
[24:48] hardened their heart in the yesterday it
[24:50] impacted their future so today I'm using
[24:53] the past to teach you so that you can
[24:56] not make the same mistake and impact
[24:58] your
[24:59] future and then Paul does the same thing
[25:02] and now in his today he quotes the David
[25:04] of yesterday who was quoting the further
[25:07] yesterday to exhort the church and the
[25:09] bride in that day that they ought to not
[25:11] Harden their hearts and listen to the
[25:13] voice of that day so that it doesn't
[25:16] determine something bad in their
[25:21] future and it's in that now exhort one
[25:23] another daily in the
[25:25] now in numbers 14 I just want to read
[25:28] this 1 verse
[25:29] 1411 of what this day looked like and
[25:32] the Lord said unto Moses how long will
[25:34] this people provoke me and how long will
[25:37] it be air they believe me for all the
[25:40] signs which I have showed among them
[25:42] signs are even Miracles and proofs
[25:44] that's why I was proven I it's in the
[25:46] sense of appearing I've appeared among
[25:49] them I've done signs and wonders they
[25:51] they how long is it going to be before
[25:52] they just believe me and take me at my
[25:56] word and so they the
[25:58] the pattern we see is that there's works
[26:00] that are done in a manifestation and
[26:03] appearing of God in that moment or in
[26:05] the now but yet while it's happening
[26:08] there's not something being reciprocated
[26:10] and being seen on the other end so
[26:12] there's a hardening of the heart and it
[26:14] it changes their direction or their
[26:19] destination and the example that Paul
[26:21] uses the example that David has used is
[26:24] this provocation in the wilderness when
[26:26] God was performing sign and wonders but
[26:29] yet it was never provoking this deeper
[26:32] faith and notice what the Bible says
[26:34] they all enjoyed and what they partook
[26:36] in in 1 Corinthians chapter 10 veres 1
[26:39] to6 moreover Brethren I would not that
[26:42] you should be ignorant how that all our
[26:44] fathers were under the cloud and all
[26:47] passed through the sea and were all
[26:50] baptized under Moses in the cloud and in
[26:52] the sea and did all eat the same
[26:55] spiritual meat and did all drink the
[26:57] same spiritual drink and now he implies
[26:59] he gives us clarification for they drank
[27:00] of that spiritual rock that followed him
[27:02] and that rock was Christ but with many
[27:05] of them God was not well pleased for
[27:07] they were overthrown in the wilderness
[27:10] their bodies were scattered throughout
[27:12] the Wilderness they died in the
[27:14] wilderness as he's writing to the
[27:16] Corinthians Paul is revisiting this very
[27:18] similar scene of how long will it be a
[27:20] they believe me with all the signs that
[27:22] I've showed him as David said for 40
[27:25] years I've been grieved and I showed
[27:27] them these wonderful works but they
[27:29] hardened their hearts and so I was
[27:31] provoked to
[27:32] anger and God was not well pleased it
[27:35] says in verse 5 for they were overthrown
[27:37] in the wilderness so he says in verse
[27:38] six now these things were our
[27:41] examples give you some nighttime reading
[27:44] continue to read here after verse 6
[27:45] because he begins to give these other
[27:47] descriptions but he says to the intent
[27:49] that we should not lust after evil
[27:50] things is they also lusted and then he
[27:53] says that we ought not to do this as
[27:54] they did we ought not to do this as they
[27:56] did and he begins to give all these
[27:57] examples
[27:58] of what they did in the Exodus while
[28:00] there was a Vindicated Prophet that had
[28:02] a message signs and wonders followed it
[28:04] and great many Works were being done in
[28:06] their midst but yet they never did
[28:07] fulfill the promise of the message they
[28:10] never did fully Embrace or catch what
[28:12] God was doing because they perish in the
[28:14] wilderness so he says they are an
[28:16] example to us the yesterday is an
[28:17] example to us that we should not lust
[28:20] after evil things as they also
[28:24] lusted I believe Grace has come in this
[28:26] hour and taught us to say no to worldly
[28:29] lust to reject and deny ungodliness so
[28:31] that we can live soberly and righteously
[28:34] in this present
[28:39] world now we could ask this
[28:42] question so that it just moves us a step
[28:45] further in this sermon but how were they
[28:48] how did they die short of their goals
[28:50] they were overthrown in the wilderness
[28:52] the phrasing suggest bodies just
[28:55] scattered through the dust in the desert
[28:57] what caused them to behave as they did
[29:02] to lust after evil things to not enter
[29:05] into their rest and to provoke
[29:08] God look at Hebrews chap
[29:12] 3:1 it says wherefore I was grieved with
[29:14] that generation and said they do always
[29:17] Heir in their heart so the heir is in
[29:20] their heart and they have not known my
[29:23] ways I want you to catch that they AED
[29:26] in their heart and they have not known
[29:28] my ways Psalm 95: 9 and 10 when your
[29:32] fathers tempted me and proved me and saw
[29:34] my work so they had seen his work 40
[29:38] years long was I griev with this
[29:39] generation said it is a people that do
[29:41] Heir in their heart and they have not
[29:44] known my
[29:46] ways now if I could say it this way they
[29:49] saw his
[29:50] work but didn't know his
[29:54] way they have not known my ways they
[29:57] have seen the Miracles they've seen the
[29:59] work they've seen the product they've
[30:01] seen the work of art but they have no
[30:03] ideas to the
[30:05] process they they see what I can do but
[30:08] through all of it they never get past
[30:09] the surface they're only immediately
[30:11] enjoying the fruits of it they just like
[30:13] what strikes the eye they can they can
[30:15] eat the meal but they wouldn't know how
[30:17] to cook it if I asked them
[30:19] to they did not see past the acts and
[30:22] deeds to see the revelation of God well
[30:26] they knew there was a god you couldn't
[30:28] deny that but they get they didn't get a
[30:30] revelation of his his nature his
[30:33] character his personality however you
[30:35] want to say his motive and what he was
[30:36] trying to
[30:37] do like why is it that he's doing
[30:41] this and I say even in this hour this
[30:44] time that we're living in God has
[30:45] appeared to us he's manifested himself
[30:47] in many Supernatural ways we can say
[30:50] that that's one of the most distinct
[30:51] outstanding things in brother Brown's
[30:53] Ministry is God is declaring to us the
[30:55] supernatural there's this sign of sermon
[30:58] that's given there's signs and wonders
[30:59] of Miracles that are performed and
[31:01] there's witness and witness after
[31:03] witness of the supernatural that was
[31:05] done in his ministry but we cannot make
[31:07] the same mistake of the
[31:10] yesterdays and bring the evil upon us in
[31:13] the
[31:17] future in Hebrews 3 and Psalms 95 and
[31:20] even numbers 14 1 Corinthians
[31:22] 10 there's this recitation and this
[31:25] pointing to the fact that the children
[31:28] of Israel saw what he did but still
[31:31] didn't know his ways in Psalms 103:7 it
[31:35] says it this way I think this is a very
[31:37] beautiful scripture to see that God will
[31:39] show his
[31:40] ways and and there's a difference with
[31:43] the acts he made his ways he excuse me
[31:45] he made known his ways unto Moses his
[31:48] acts un to the children of Israel was
[31:51] reading the scripture this week and this
[31:54] is the reason why I use ways for all my
[31:55] navigation says take heed to your
[31:58] ways and don't use Apple Maps Google
[32:01] Maps that's what I use I got a scripture
[32:03] for it he made known his ways unto Moses
[32:06] his acts unto the children of Israel it
[32:08] might seem as if they're both the same
[32:10] thing and just talking about two
[32:11] different groups of people or an
[32:12] individual and a group of people but he
[32:14] made known his acts unto the children of
[32:16] Israel that means it speaks of a wanness
[32:19] but it's also a deed or a doing in the
[32:21] sense of something being affected comes
[32:25] from even the Hebrew word to act
[32:26] severely and to to deal with severely
[32:28] and so they could see God's
[32:31] act they could see his works his plagues
[32:34] on the enemies they could see his
[32:35] Redemption out of bondage leading them
[32:37] through the Red Sea feeding them with
[32:38] man in the wilderness bringing them to
[32:39] the land of Canaan those are undeniable
[32:42] facts they saw the acts that he
[32:45] performed his affecting God would affect
[32:47] something they could see that moving
[32:50] they could see that
[32:51] visibly in Psalm 78: 1-22 you're like
[32:55] whoo that's a long way it is let's just
[32:56] read through it give ear oh my people
[32:59] start Psalm 78 I think it's just a good
[33:01] good to read through we'll be done here
[33:02] in just a moment give ear oh my people
[33:04] to my law incline your ears to the words
[33:07] of my mouth I will open my mouth in a
[33:10] parable I will utter dark sayings of old
[33:13] which we have heard and known and our
[33:15] fathers have told us we will not hide
[33:18] them from we will not hide them from
[33:21] their children showing to the generation
[33:23] to come the Praises of the Lord and his
[33:25] strength and his wonderful works that he
[33:27] ha done
[33:29] these are the works that we would see
[33:30] these are the ones that he shows the
[33:31] things that he manifests for he
[33:33] established a testimony in Jacob and
[33:34] appointed a law in Israel which
[33:36] commanded our fathers that they should
[33:38] make them known to their children oh so
[33:41] importance of teaching these things and
[33:43] reciting these things that the
[33:44] generation to come might know them even
[33:46] the children of which should be born who
[33:48] should arise and declare them to their
[33:51] children this is what we're going to do
[33:53] today we're going to tell you of the
[33:55] yesterday and we're going to tell you
[33:56] now so in the future you could tell them
[33:58] of the yesterday and teach your children
[34:00] and their and your today so that they
[34:02] can do the same in the
[34:04] future this is the way that it that is
[34:06] to be
[34:07] done in verse 7 that they might set
[34:09] their hope in God now what was the
[34:12] purpose of reciting all the Miracles the
[34:13] signs and words this great strength and
[34:15] these wonderful works that he had done
[34:16] in Israel that they might set their hope
[34:18] in God something's missing if it's
[34:21] merely a a lesson of History something's
[34:23] missing if it's just telling wonderful
[34:25] stories to go to bed they had to set
[34:26] their hope in God and not forget the
[34:28] works of God but keep his Commandments
[34:31] the very purpose behind sharing these
[34:33] things was to understand something about
[34:35] God what he required and what was
[34:37] pleasing to him it might not be as their
[34:40] fathers a stubborn and rebellious
[34:42] generation a generation that set not
[34:44] their heart right and whose Spirit was
[34:46] not steadfast with god notice that
[34:49] alignment these things the stories they
[34:51] actually are going to tell are the works
[34:54] that God did with their fathers
[34:58] think this is remarkable maybe I'm just
[34:59] thinking about it this is Fresh So if I
[35:01] make a mistake just forgive me but the
[35:05] the the way that it's being said is
[35:07] these are the things that God did to
[35:08] your fathers we're going to tell you the
[35:11] wonderful works that God did so that you
[35:13] hearing that can hope in your God and
[35:15] Obey him even though your fathers didn't
[35:18] when they actually experienced
[35:22] them that's
[35:24] something God does not give Hope on the
[35:27] uh with the Next Generation he do even
[35:29] have to repeat the same cycle he just
[35:32] wants you to take him at his word that
[35:34] this is what he did even if the
[35:35] generation he's manifested to reject him
[35:38] listen God used brother Brandon's
[35:40] Ministry around the world displaying the
[35:42] Supernatural and he was rejected we
[35:45] could say oh no he was popular he was
[35:46] wonderful everybody love no not
[35:48] everybody loved him but the message was
[35:50] rejected and we will not see his
[35:53] ministry with the uh with these eyes we
[35:55] do not get get to experience the same
[35:57] way and we can see that he was rejected
[35:59] in that generation but we contined to
[36:01] share the Vindication we continue to
[36:04] share the testimonies of the powerful
[36:05] example and we continue to go through
[36:07] the message of the hour that we might
[36:09] have hope in
[36:11] God even if that generation is the one
[36:14] that rejected
[36:15] him thank you
[36:18] Lord and it says that they were
[36:20] rebellious and they didn't set their
[36:21] heart right as it said in those other
[36:22] scriptures their they aired in their
[36:24] heart so they always a in their heart
[36:27] and what is it they have not known my
[36:28] ways they have not known my ways and
[36:31] here it says their Spirit was not
[36:33] steadfast with
[36:34] God through everything God did there was
[36:37] never a moment where it pulled them into
[36:39] rhythm with
[36:41] them they never syned up there there was
[36:44] never this connection it's like okay now
[36:46] we're in the flow now we're getting
[36:47] things
[36:48] done the children of Ephraim being armed
[36:51] and carrying bows turned back in the day
[36:53] of battle was reading that about the use
[36:55] of Ephraim and I guess it's widely
[36:56] accepted that ephra is being used as an
[36:58] example of all of Israel but notice
[37:00] their what they did even though they're
[37:01] armed carrying bows they turned their
[37:03] back in the day of battle they kept not
[37:04] the Covenant of God and refused to walk
[37:06] in his law and forget his works and his
[37:09] Wonders that he had showed them they had
[37:12] been done they saw him they experienced
[37:13] them marvelous things did he in the side
[37:16] of their fathers in the land of Egypt in
[37:18] the field of zoen he divided the sea and
[37:21] caused them to pass through and he made
[37:22] the waters to stand as a heap in the
[37:24] daytime also he led them with the cloud
[37:26] and all the night with the light of fire
[37:28] he clav the rocks in the wilderness gave
[37:30] them drink as out of the great depths he
[37:32] brought streams also out of the Rock and
[37:34] caused Waters to run down like rivers
[37:36] and they sinned yet more against them by
[37:39] provoking the most high in the
[37:42] wilderness there is I think I'm just
[37:44] going to read to verse 22 but you could
[37:45] keep reading keep reading keep reading
[37:47] keep
[37:48] reading of all the things it begins to
[37:50] say that it did to where even when God
[37:53] bring begins to bring certain things
[37:54] they're like oh well can God just spread
[37:56] a banquet right out Never
[37:58] Satisfied they just want him to keep
[38:00] doing the Wonders and doing the
[38:02] Wonders and it's as if that there was
[38:05] never they were never uh sad they were
[38:07] never satisfied but in a really nasty
[38:09] sense that they just wanted God to keep
[38:12] doing things but yet I believe that what
[38:14] God is teaching us is that if God would
[38:16] go through repetition through sign and
[38:18] wonder sign and wonder what he's wanting
[38:20] you to do is One Day begin to realize
[38:22] well if you can do that I can do it too
[38:24] through
[38:25] you I can take you out your word and I
[38:27] don't have to treat you like a genie in
[38:29] the bottle and I don't have to try to
[38:30] conjure up some work but I can believe
[38:32] that the same God who did that to my
[38:34] fathers is the same God living in me and
[38:37] I can trust him for the moment I'm
[38:39] living it because my hope is in
[38:43] God thank you Lord they sinned more
[38:45] against him by provoking the most high
[38:48] in the world all these wonders all these
[38:49] wonders all these Wonders that they saw
[38:50] that they drank that they handled that
[38:52] they felt that they and they still
[38:54] sinned the more and this is another poet
[38:58] poetical uh poetic description of this
[39:01] and they tempted God in their heart by
[39:03] asking meat for their lust they just
[39:06] drank the water oh we can get water out
[39:09] of a rock maybe we can get meat out of
[39:11] the
[39:13] sky and they spake against God they said
[39:16] can God furnish a table in the
[39:19] wilderness notice that there there's not
[39:21] this it's something's wrong as as they
[39:25] said their spirit's not Stead fast with
[39:28] God they're they're more
[39:29] adversarial listen I think this is one
[39:31] of those things that the devil just
[39:32] slips in and causes amongst fellowships
[39:34] and friends and in relationships and
[39:36] parents to children and uh spouses to
[39:38] one another if you could just twist it
[39:40] enough to refill that your adversaries
[39:42] so that nothing you ever talk about
[39:44] you're in it together it's almost as if
[39:46] you're arguing one with one another and
[39:48] they never viewed God as a partner in
[39:50] The Exodus and they never really wanted
[39:52] to be on God's side and say okay this is
[39:54] what you're doing we're with you we're
[39:55] steadfast with you and so that they
[39:57] could go forward it was always as if
[39:59] there was this adversarial
[40:01] relationship oh well then can you can
[40:03] you make a table in the wilderness
[40:05] behold he smok the rock that the waters
[40:07] gushed out and streams overflowed can he
[40:10] give bread also notice this
[40:13] attitude can he provide flesh for his
[40:16] people therefore the Lord heard this and
[40:19] was wroth so a fire was kindled against
[40:21] Jacob and anger also came up against
[40:24] Israel because they believed not in God
[40:27] and trusted not in his
[40:30] salvation the same thing has happened
[40:33] today in the message of the hour where
[40:35] there's such a lust for the table in the
[40:38] wilderness such a lust for the water out
[40:40] of the rock such a lust for the Mana
[40:42] from Heaven and the meat and the bread
[40:44] and all the Miracles and signs and
[40:46] wonders but through it all they do not
[40:48] believe anymore in God nor are they
[40:51] trusting in the Salvation that has been
[40:53] brought to them
[41:01] they never learned or grasped there was
[41:03] never this I just love the way the Bible
[41:05] says it they had never they were never
[41:07] steadfast their Spirits were never
[41:09] steadfast with
[41:11] God they never were caught up in his
[41:16] ways though he was manifesting himself
[41:20] repeatedly amongst
[41:23] them he has made known his acts unto the
[41:27] children of
[41:29] Israel but he had made known his ways
[41:33] unto
[41:34] Moses the acts are all the things we've
[41:36] read in 1 Corinthians 10 and Psalm 78
[41:38] these acts that everyone could
[41:40] participate in everyone could eat
[41:42] everyone can read everyone could do
[41:44] these things all could walk through
[41:45] these processes but only Moses really
[41:48] had known is it says he not only
[41:49] necessarily but I've made known my ways
[41:53] unto
[41:54] Moses ways could mean a road a a a path
[41:58] it could mean a direction or even a
[42:00] journey but it also means
[42:02] manner this habit this course of life
[42:06] this moral
[42:08] character it comes from a tread or bend
[42:10] to march to cause to go or to lead
[42:13] through everything that God was doing
[42:15] they saw his acts but they never were
[42:17] steadfast with his leadership they
[42:19] didn't know where it was pointing they
[42:20] could see him do something in other
[42:22] words they could maybe if I could use
[42:23] this you could see the footprint but you
[42:25] can't tell which way it's going you can
[42:27] see the evidence of someone's presence
[42:29] but you don't know how long they had
[42:30] been there and where what direction
[42:31] they're
[42:34] headed the manner the course of Life the
[42:39] character he made known his acts to the
[42:42] whole of children of Israel but he
[42:45] wanted to show his ways or make known
[42:47] his ways under the individual his
[42:50] character his manner his habit and
[42:52] Israel did not take advantage of the
[42:54] opportunity that was given them to know
[42:55] God in a deeper way yes
[42:59] superficial a
[43:03] pretense I want to like to say it this
[43:05] way and I know that we use the subject
[43:08] of character quite a bit but his his
[43:11] mannerisms he he made his he made known
[43:14] his ways his
[43:16] mannerisms to
[43:18] Moses and we can say his works oh it is
[43:22] his character's course of Life his
[43:24] journey something richer and deeper to
[43:27] Moses but yet kind of The Superficial
[43:29] the outward he made known to the
[43:30] children of Israel yet his mannerisms
[43:33] his works there are they are his
[43:38] characteristics and something is known
[43:40] by its characteristics we use the story
[43:43] of of Solomon and how brother brandham
[43:44] uses that and God identified in his
[43:46] characteristics how Solomon could pick
[43:48] up on these were women based upon the
[43:50] way they acted in their particular
[43:51] Manner and so it's his characteristics
[43:53] and characteristics are those things
[43:55] that indicate one's character
[43:57] these are distinctive traits so we could
[44:00] say that actions and things you say and
[44:03] the way that you look are the
[44:04] expressions of identity they are the
[44:06] attributes or
[44:08] characteristics yet seeing the
[44:11] characteristics is one
[44:12] thing but knowing his character is
[44:16] greater it's like knowing the Bible and
[44:18] knowing the author it's setting before a
[44:21] Manet or looking at a painting be able
[44:23] to see it and think it's beautiful wow I
[44:25] could never do that but then to actually
[44:27] know the inspiration of the artist and
[44:30] and the context and all those other
[44:31] things and I know I'm trying to use a
[44:33] carnal example to really tap into
[44:34] Supernatural things but God wants us to
[44:36] see it and view it and not just admire
[44:39] the work but he wants us to understand
[44:41] the work itself the process the mind the
[44:45] motive the objective the reasons behind
[44:48] things I thank God that I've been able
[44:51] to come to this point and Lord willing
[44:53] pick up it on pick up on Sunday on
[44:56] holiness
[44:58] cuz I could not bring myself to do it to
[45:00] a Wednesday night crowd like well that
[45:02] just would be cruel that would be like
[45:03] trading Luca for ad or something like
[45:05] that it just wouldn't make any
[45:09] sense but seeing his attributes is one
[45:13] thing but knowing his character by it
[45:15] completely
[45:17] different in other words saying I see
[45:19] what you did
[45:20] there oh wow I I'm picking up what
[45:24] you're laying down I'm inspired by this
[45:26] that this is something that enthusias me
[45:28] I I understand I see what you're
[45:32] doing not knowing his ways if we could
[45:34] take it from Psalms and Hebrews and
[45:36] Corinthians and these different places
[45:38] not knowing his way today puts us in
[45:41] danger of
[45:42] departing from his his character and
[45:46] repeating the mistakes of
[45:48] yesterday if we do not know his way
[45:51] today hear his voice today it puts us in
[45:55] danger of repeating prior generation
[45:58] mistakes here we are today in a
[46:01] situation where so much that we draw
[46:03] from is done and recorded between 47 and
[46:06] 65 and we haven't led up in we should
[46:08] have leted up in listening to it and
[46:09] reading it and sharing it and talking
[46:11] about it being inspired by it and yet we
[46:13] can go back to that time and we can say
[46:14] well Generations are dying and there's
[46:16] many that have rejected and many that
[46:17] fall away and there's very fewer and
[46:19] fewer voices of our fathers who actually
[46:22] experienced those Supernatural works but
[46:24] yet here we are a generation that heard
[46:26] our fathers tell us about it and then we
[46:28] want to continue to tell our generation
[46:30] about it in the future and the lesson is
[46:32] that some of our fathers hardened their
[46:34] hearts and they been they they've been
[46:36] overthrown in the wilderness Wilderness
[46:38] and now I like Wilderness that's a
[46:40] that's a good combination of different
[46:41] things and here we are wanting to say
[46:44] don't make the same mistake yet we
[46:46] ourselves are not the same Witnesses
[46:48] they
[46:53] were it's a challenge to not
[46:57] make the same mistake that they
[46:59] made in Judges chapter 2: 6-15 and when
[47:03] Joshua had let the people go I'm using
[47:05] this to show this example of if we don't
[47:07] know his ways today no matter how great
[47:09] it was yesterday if we don't know his
[47:11] ways today there's this danger of ending
[47:14] up like this in judges 2 and when Joshua
[47:17] had let the people go the children of
[47:19] Israel went every man unto his
[47:20] inheritance to possess the land that was
[47:22] a process of possession and the people
[47:24] served the Lord all the days of Joshua
[47:26] and the days of the elders that outlived
[47:28] Joshua who had seen all the great works
[47:30] of the Lord that he did for Israel and
[47:33] Joshua the son of nun the servant of the
[47:35] Lord died being 110 years old they
[47:37] buried him in the border of his
[47:38] inheritance in the Mount of Ephraim and
[47:41] on the north side of the Hill gash and
[47:44] also all that generation were gathered
[47:46] under their fathers so here's this this
[47:49] death and and there arose another
[47:53] generation after them you see there was
[47:56] this Joshua Elders that outlive
[47:59] Joshua all that generation are gathered
[48:01] to their fathers and there Rises up a
[48:04] generation after them which knew not the
[48:08] Lord nor yet The Works which he had done
[48:11] for
[48:13] Israel and we could say well of course
[48:15] not they weren't there for it they
[48:19] weren't there in the in Egypt they
[48:20] weren't there in the wilderness they
[48:21] weren't there when they crossed over
[48:23] they weren't there when they the walls
[48:24] of Jericho fell down and so it's a
[48:26] different time it's a different season
[48:28] but notice this
[48:30] danger in in not being knowledgeable of
[48:34] what he done what he had accomplished
[48:36] and done they they the danger wasn't
[48:39] knowing the history the danger was not
[48:40] learning his ways by
[48:42] it please catch that
[48:45] part and the children of Israel verse 11
[48:47] did evil in the sight of the Lord and
[48:49] served balum and they forsook the Lord
[48:51] God of their fathers which brought them
[48:52] out of the land of Egypt and followed
[48:54] other gods of the Gods of the people
[48:56] that were around about them and bowed
[48:58] themselves under them and provoked the
[48:59] Lord to
[49:01] anger I'll stop reading it there but
[49:03] verse 14 it says that there was that
[49:06] what happened is God turned them over to
[49:07] their enemies they could no longer stand
[49:10] before their enemies and where does it
[49:12] begin they're raised up a generation
[49:13] that didn't know the Lord I said did
[49:15] they they didn't know there was a god
[49:17] well I don't know if it was a matter of
[49:18] them not not knowing there was a God but
[49:21] they didn't know his
[49:22] ways they didn't know the works that he
[49:25] had done there might have been stories
[49:28] told of how they ended up there they
[49:29] might have known there was one true God
[49:30] listen there's a way that even today as
[49:33] isolated as we may be and as a different
[49:35] this as this message may be and as
[49:36] different as you young ladies and young
[49:38] men might feel when it comes to well we
[49:39] believe the message and we believe God
[49:41] sent a prophet and you have friends that
[49:42] are Baptist you have friends that do
[49:44] this and friends that do that as weird
[49:45] as you might seem there's a way to where
[49:47] we can actually believe in something and
[49:49] acknowledge its existence but not
[49:51] actually know
[49:53] it and be able to appreciate and know
[49:57] the works which God has
[50:00] done and because they did not learn his
[50:04] ways because we see already that they
[50:07] could have learned all the stories and
[50:08] knew all the stories and they could have
[50:10] had wonderful coloring books of of all
[50:12] the things that God had did and they
[50:13] might have been able to really enjoy H
[50:16] uh different media to kind of immerse
[50:18] them in these certain things but if you
[50:20] don't know his ways right The Works
[50:23] don't mean anything to you in the end
[50:25] maybe I could have said that better but
[50:26] hope you get my
[50:28] point so Psalms 25: 1-4 let me try to
[50:32] get to that moment we referred to it a
[50:34] little bit ago unto thee Oh Lord do I
[50:37] lift up my soul oh my God I trust in
[50:40] thee let me not be ashamed let not my
[50:42] enemies triumph over me what caused the
[50:45] enemies to triumph over the children of
[50:47] Israel in the Book of Judges the fact
[50:49] that they no longer knew the Lord and
[50:51] his works not just to his acts made
[50:55] known but his ways
[50:59] shown don't let my enemies triumph over
[51:02] me yay let none that wait on thee be
[51:03] ashamed let them be ashamed which
[51:05] transgress without cause so what is say
[51:08] cry to not be triumphed over show me thy
[51:11] ways oh Lord teach me thy paths Lead Me
[51:15] in thy truth and teach me for thou art
[51:18] the god of my salvation on thee do I
[51:20] wait all the day today if you will hear
[51:23] his voice today if you will hear the
[51:26] voice voice of God he is teaching you
[51:28] how to live soberly and righteously and
[51:30] godly in this 2025 in the 21st
[51:35] century he wants to teach you his ways
[51:38] and to teach you his paths and Lead You
[51:40] In the
[51:42] truth not a historical
[51:44] lesson not trying to put ourselves in
[51:47] situations where we could pray and ask
[51:49] God to part the Waters of Lake Pleasant
[51:51] nor should we put ourselves in a
[51:52] situation where we're travailing for
[51:54] food and we want God to rain quell out
[51:56] of Heaven though that would be kind of
[51:57] nice if you're quail hunting but it's
[51:59] it's not that we try to duplicate a
[52:01] scene from the past and cause our lives
[52:03] to imitate the art of a day gone by but
[52:05] rather we want God's way in his path
[52:09] Today Show me your ways if you made
[52:12] known your ways unto Moses your manner
[52:15] of Life your spirit your character then
[52:18] I know that if I have the life the
[52:20] characteristics will follow and I don't
[52:22] need to try to model myself after the
[52:25] characteristics I just want to know your
[52:28] ways thank you Lord even David after he
[52:32] had fallen and sinned and the prophit
[52:34] had exposed his Heir in Psalm 5110 to13
[52:37] create in me a clean heart why because
[52:40] that's where you Heir you air in your
[52:41] heart it said that these people always a
[52:43] in their heart their hearts are far from
[52:45] me they Heir in their heart they have
[52:46] not known my
[52:48] ways their Spirits were not steadfast
[52:50] with me so David prays give me a clean
[52:53] heart creating me a clean heart oh God
[52:54] and renew a right spirit Within Me cast
[52:58] me not away from thy presence and take
[53:00] not thy Holy Spirit from me restore unto
[53:03] me the joy of thy salvation and uphold
[53:05] me with thy free
[53:08] spirit then will I teach transgressors
[53:11] thy ways and sinners shall be converted
[53:13] unto
[53:14] thee there's no there there's not a path
[53:17] for anybody
[53:18] else that he is not able to be a witness
[53:22] listen we are not going to be effective
[53:24] Witnesses while we're still bowed down
[53:26] with the shame of our fornication and
[53:27] adultery and our our unclean dalliances
[53:30] in the world you're not going to be a to
[53:33] be able to have power over the
[53:36] enemy as you ought
[53:38] to right if you're not taking heed to
[53:41] his ways to his
[53:43] word create in me a clean heart renew a
[53:45] right Spirit In Me cast not your
[53:47] presence away from me and if I could get
[53:49] a right Spirit if I could get a clean
[53:50] heart then I'll be able to teach
[53:52] transgressors thy ways because then I'll
[53:54] know your heart I'll know your ways
[53:57] Sinners shall be converted unto thee
[53:59] when I know your
[54:05] way as Paul was admonishing in Titus the
[54:09] grace of God that brings salvation hath
[54:11] appeared to all men teaching us that if
[54:14] we can deny the world and deny
[54:16] ungodliness and say no to these worldly
[54:18] lust we will be able to live soberly
[54:20] righteously and godly in the now in the
[54:23] in that time in that first century he
[54:25] said this is what you can do the grace
[54:28] of God has appeared
[54:29] teaching and Peter said one day that
[54:31] same Grace is going to come again
[54:34] there's going to be a revelation of
[54:35] Jesus Christ it's going to bring to you
[54:36] a Grace there's going to be a Salvation
[54:38] revealed in the last time and it comes
[54:40] teaching again that today if you will
[54:43] deny the world say no to worldly lust
[54:45] you can live soberly righteously and
[54:47] godly in the 21st
[54:49] century amen and Peter comes back to it
[54:52] in verse 14 1 Peter 1:14 as obedient
[54:55] children
[54:56] not fashioning yourselves according to
[54:58] the former lust and your ignorance but
[55:01] as he which hath called you is Holy so
[55:04] be ye holy in all manner of conversation
[55:07] because it is written be ye holy for I
[55:09] am
[55:11] Holy I'm I'm I'm moving into a whole
[55:13] another subject area now or just what
[55:15] this all was the foundation for Lord
[55:17] will and will pick up for pick up on it
[55:18] on Sunday
[55:19] morning but be holy that's separated
[55:22] it's it's a consecration it's a
[55:24] dedication be separated
[55:26] as God is
[55:31] separate I'm hearing
[55:33] you and I I I can see the the black and
[55:36] white I can I I can read the letters I
[55:38] can hear it resounding in my mind but it
[55:40] says that I am to be I'm called he that
[55:43] has called me is Holy so I am to be holy
[55:46] in my manner of
[55:48] life he is a holy God I need to be holy
[55:52] in my
[55:54] life so what fash would this look
[55:58] like a god who cannot be seen and so we
[56:01] start to imagine well what would what
[56:03] would God be like and what would we do
[56:04] and we think well you know what kind of
[56:06] clothes does God wear and you know how
[56:07] does he sleep at night and what would he
[56:09] say in this situation we say well maybe
[56:11] that's a little bit beyond me I want a
[56:12] god with skin on them so we begin to
[56:14] look through the Bible and we begin to
[56:15] look at the prophets we look at Jesus
[56:17] Christ we look at the disciples we look
[56:19] at the lives of those Believers that we
[56:21] have in our lives we look at the
[56:22] minister of William brandham there's a
[56:23] way where we're trying to understand
[56:25] what this fashion would look like if we
[56:28] obedient children not fashioning
[56:30] ourselves after our former lust when we
[56:32] were ignorant but now being enlightened
[56:34] to the ways of God what does that
[56:36] fashion look like brother Bram in the
[56:38] sermon the sea does not air with a shock
[56:40] he says he that is great he that this
[56:42] great mystery of God made known how that
[56:45] God was in Christ reconciling himself to
[56:47] the world how that he and the fathers
[56:49] were one how that the great Mysteries of
[56:52] the fulfilling of God taking and
[56:54] bringing himself this this is the a
[56:56] paradox I want you to think of as the
[56:58] one who have called you as holy you be
[57:00] holy as this God that is above all
[57:02] things this God that is greater than all
[57:05] things this God who is Holy and clean
[57:07] and pure there's no darkness in him
[57:08] there's no shadow of turn there's no
[57:09] variableness in him you be holy yourself
[57:12] as well the same God bringing himself
[57:15] manifesting in the age of human beings
[57:18] in the Stream of human beings and in the
[57:20] company of human
[57:22] beings he's going to fit into that age
[57:26] of humans the stream of humans the
[57:28] company of
[57:29] humans if I can say this this is my
[57:31] words he's going to look simp he's going
[57:33] to look really human in some ways that
[57:36] going to share this common basis that we
[57:38] all share we are all at the basis simply
[57:42] human to make his word manifested in the
[57:45] day and the Eastern rising of the Sun
[57:47] and to do the same thing as the sun sets
[57:49] in the west to make himself manifested
[57:52] in a bride Church the word made manifest
[57:56] it will
[57:57] too he that understandeth that is to
[58:00] know that's been revealed to them of him
[58:02] that sent me has everlasting life and
[58:03] will not come into judgment but has
[58:05] passed from Death un
[58:07] life as he that has called you is Holy
[58:11] you be
[58:13] holy it's not the form of godliness but
[58:15] the actual
[58:17] way what is the fashion of God what
[58:20] would it look like I know I've been
[58:21] repeating this for the first uh month or
[58:23] so of the year that there is this God is
[58:26] wanting to make himself
[58:28] known we could say a life lived by the
[58:30] word will be the word expressed all
[58:33] these different thingses that I've been
[58:34] trying to come at I want to be able to
[58:36] narrow it down Lord willing on Sunday to
[58:38] very specific things that we know frame
[58:40] the life of a
[58:42] Christian there's a way that I can look
[58:44] a way that I can act and a way that I
[58:46] can present myself and treat other
[58:48] people that we should be able to say
[58:50] according to the word of God is outside
[58:51] the framing of what a Christian is to be
[58:55] that this is not the characteristics of
[58:57] God this is not how God would present in
[58:59] the day and age that we're living in I I
[59:01] I'm not going to try to go back and look
[59:03] like a Christ of the first generation
[59:05] I'm not going to try to go back and look
[59:06] like David in the BC ages but what would
[59:08] he look like today and there's certain
[59:09] things that are going to be framed that
[59:12] we need to be careful say oh well I
[59:13] can't believe that they look like this
[59:14] why doesn't everybody wear white why
[59:16] doesn't everybody drive an electric
[59:17] vehicle why doesn't everybody do this
[59:18] but there's certain things that we can
[59:20] say Christ will be in this
[59:23] hour we could create our own form
[59:26] but we want to know his way because it's
[59:29] only by knowing his
[59:30] way that you can live the life Brothers
[59:33] you could come to your
[59:35] instruments hope I didn't put everybody
[59:37] to
[59:38] sleep in the sermon God is identified by
[59:41] his
[59:45] characteristics let's just let's let's
[59:48] really consider this this is a prayer
[59:50] that he's asking so let's just think
[59:52] about this and I I I I'll I'll I'll read
[59:55] I'll say the prayer and if you something
[59:56] your heart identifies with it I'm going
[59:58] to give you the opportunity to stand and
[59:59] say that's my prayer that's what I
[1:00:02] want God is identified by his
[1:00:04] characteristics and may Our Lives be so
[1:00:07] fitted with the
[1:00:08] word that the word will become flesh
[1:00:10] Among Us and will give the people Faith
[1:00:13] to draw from their account in
[1:00:16] heaven as David said Lord I give me a
[1:00:19] clean heart give me a right Spirit teach
[1:00:21] me your ways and if I can know your ways
[1:00:23] then I can teach transgressors your ways
[1:00:26] Sinners can be converted because my life
[1:00:28] is going to be a living testimony I'm
[1:00:30] not just going to be a work of art but
[1:00:32] I'm going to understand the work of art
[1:00:35] I'm going to understand the process I
[1:00:37] understand what God's heart is in his
[1:00:38] mind I I'm going to know way to I want
[1:00:40] to have wisdom to approach a siner I
[1:00:42] want to have wisdom to approach a
[1:00:43] situation so that Christ can be
[1:00:45] magnified am in my life amen may my life
[1:00:49] be so fitted with the word that the word
[1:00:51] will become flesh in my life and it'll
[1:00:53] actually give people Faith to draw from
[1:00:56] their account in heaven which Jesus
[1:00:58] settled for them long ago for their sins
[1:00:59] and sickness and they're in the journey
[1:01:03] he says bless us now we pray as we wait
[1:01:05] on thee to reveal to us Thy word and
[1:01:08] make it flesh Among
[1:01:09] Us brother Brandon preaching that those
[1:01:12] series of sermons which I have a whole
[1:01:13] list of them where he's dealing with
[1:01:15] this particular thought God identified
[1:01:17] by his
[1:01:19] characteristics there was something
[1:01:22] behind that
[1:01:24] characteristic an act attribute a
[1:01:26] characteristic is God God's identified
[1:01:29] by
[1:01:30] them that that is that is how he's
[1:01:32] identified so then I could just
[1:01:35] look at the work of art and say wow
[1:01:40] that's amazing look what he's doing but
[1:01:43] God through that expression is saying do
[1:01:46] you see
[1:01:48] me do you hear my
[1:01:50] heart C can you can you not strive
[1:01:53] against me can your heart be steadfast
[1:01:56] with me can you catch the beat and the
[1:01:59] rhythm of the hour through these things
[1:02:01] that's happening and not just see a
[1:02:03] miracle like oh my goodness he can do
[1:02:05] that well can you do this but he can do
[1:02:08] that well that's awesome can you do this
[1:02:11] and God just constantly does this to
[1:02:12] generation after generation and to think
[1:02:14] that in the out day and hour we're
[1:02:16] living in that so many people in the
[1:02:19] message are wanting to go back to those
[1:02:21] tables in the
[1:02:22] wilderness they're wanting to go back to
[1:02:24] that kind of display and that kind of
[1:02:26] enthusiasm without knowing his way
[1:02:29] they're really really amped up about the
[1:02:31] acts but they're not concerned with
[1:02:34] knowing his way let us not be guilty of
[1:02:37] disregarding the very heart of God and
[1:02:39] what he's trying to teach us in these
[1:02:42] things so that the word can be made
[1:02:44] flesh amongst us and there can be living
[1:02:47] today 21st century
[1:02:51] christs not even the 20th
[1:02:54] century 21st Cent Century
[1:02:57] Christ oh would Jesus have a cell
[1:03:01] phone which one are you talking
[1:03:05] about Paul said who are you Lord I'm
[1:03:07] Jesus whom thou persecutest well today
[1:03:10] would Jesus have a cell phone you tell
[1:03:13] me
[1:03:14] Woody asking the real questions now
[1:03:16] aren't
[1:03:17] we right Phillip right asking the real
[1:03:21] questions well I'm just going to go I'm
[1:03:24] just going to say yeah because
[1:03:27] I've got one I can least say well my
[1:03:29] wife has one I mean it's closest Christ
[1:03:32] as I can my father-in-law has one I mean
[1:03:33] I I think I don't think Jesus I Think
[1:03:35] Jesus would have his cell phone you
[1:03:36] notice how arbitrary we could just draw
[1:03:37] a
[1:03:39] line but even if Jesus wouldn't own a
[1:03:42] cell phone in not owning a cell phone
[1:03:46] you'll never know his way by the absence
[1:03:48] of a cell
[1:03:50] phone until you can see the heart and
[1:03:52] the motive behind it and the character
[1:03:55] and how they handle it how they approach
[1:03:57] a situation how they handle disagreement
[1:03:59] how they even things that rub you the
[1:04:01] wrong way and things that make you
[1:04:02] uncomfortable the way that you handle
[1:04:04] those things is going to declare the
[1:04:06] nature and character of Christ we can
[1:04:08] all sit back and call out a bad meal
[1:04:10] that was
[1:04:11] horrible that didn't taste good at
[1:04:14] all well you do it
[1:04:16] better tell me what was wrong with it
[1:04:20] what what what was missing what was I
[1:04:22] don't know it just didn't taste good to
[1:04:23] me
[1:04:27] so much more that we can know from
[1:04:30] Christ so much we should long for we
[1:04:32] should desire so many things we want to
[1:04:34] see if I said a moment ago and I think
[1:04:36] what it said is that Israel did not take
[1:04:38] advantage of the opportunity to know God
[1:04:40] in a deeper way and maybe that could be
[1:04:42] our prayer tonight I want my life so
[1:04:44] fitted with the word that the word will
[1:04:45] become flesh in
[1:04:47] me that I could become a conduit of his
[1:04:52] ways so that Sinners transgression
[1:04:57] can be
[1:04:58] taught let's stand to our feet I know
[1:05:01] some of you just forgot to
[1:05:04] stand I believe that you it resonated
[1:05:06] with you you want you want this in your
[1:05:08] heart you want this in your life so
[1:05:09] let's bow our heads in a word of
[1:05:11] [Music]
[1:05:14] prayer our gracious Heavenly Father
[1:05:16] tonight as we stand in your divine
[1:05:18] presence as we close this
[1:05:20] service we ask that you take these
[1:05:22] things which have been shared Lord I
[1:05:24] realize that on one hand it's very
[1:05:26] simple but in another
[1:05:28] way very profound and
[1:05:31] important and I ask that you would make
[1:05:33] it real to the believer's hearts tonight
[1:05:36] Lord when I say believer I realize that
[1:05:39] there's people here who need to receive
[1:05:41] you who've been fighting
[1:05:43] you who have not
[1:05:46] yielded who still have a work that needs
[1:05:49] to be done on their
[1:05:51] heart and Lord I believe that you're
[1:05:53] calling to them through these things
[1:05:56] Lord there's those here who are veterans
[1:05:58] of the cause they've stood they've
[1:06:00] persevered Lord they've Advanced and
[1:06:02] they've part of the foundation that
[1:06:03] we're standing upon as Believers today
[1:06:06] and as young
[1:06:08] people yet Lord they need to be reminded
[1:06:10] to be
[1:06:12] steadfast and Lord regardless of where
[1:06:15] we stand tonight I believe this word is
[1:06:16] applicable on so many different levels
[1:06:19] and I would say Lord we want to know as
[1:06:21] David said teach me your ways show me
[1:06:23] your paths
[1:06:25] I don't want to just see signs and
[1:06:26] wonders though I've prayed for them
[1:06:28] though I tried to encourage them and
[1:06:29] though I believe they're present in our
[1:06:31] body Lord I do not want to just see the
[1:06:34] the reflection as an image but I want to
[1:06:36] know your heart and know your mind I
[1:06:38] want to I want to catch that heartbeat
[1:06:40] of
[1:06:41] God lord we could all sit back and
[1:06:44] listen to your Symphony but do we know
[1:06:46] our
[1:06:47] part do we know what each sounding
[1:06:50] reflects and do we know what it means
[1:06:52] and do we know what it's presenting and
[1:06:54] how it it's part of the part of the
[1:06:55] conductor and the one that wrote the
[1:06:57] piece that it's telling a
[1:07:00] story almost as it were signaling to us
[1:07:03] the direction the pace the destination
[1:07:07] for us to meet you in the
[1:07:10] air we'll never be able to make it to
[1:07:13] that meeting by just sitting back and
[1:07:15] seeing your works we need to know your
[1:07:20] ways show us your ways Lord as you did
[1:07:24] to your servant Moses
[1:07:26] do so to us as you did to your servant
[1:07:28] brother bam do so to us Lord show us
[1:07:30] your way your heart your mind open up to
[1:07:33] us your
[1:07:35] character not just your attributes
[1:07:37] you're identified by them but Lord I
[1:07:39] want to be identified with them myself I
[1:07:43] pray for the people here tonight heal
[1:07:46] Hearts I pray for brother jet Lord
[1:07:48] tonight that you'd move upon his
[1:07:51] situation Lord I pray for the different
[1:07:53] ones who are sick who are hurting facing
[1:07:56] difficult situations Lord there's some
[1:07:57] that have been out of church all year
[1:07:59] there's some who find themselves being
[1:08:01] pressed from different sides financially
[1:08:03] and depression Lord I pray that you
[1:08:05] would be present with them Lord Jesus I
[1:08:09] believe that if we could know your ways
[1:08:11] we can see a way out even in the very
[1:08:14] places we're reading where you talk
[1:08:16] about the mistakes of times past and the
[1:08:18] different things that Israel had gone
[1:08:20] through Lord that you even tell us that
[1:08:22] you will with this temptation make a way
[1:08:24] of Escape you are the way the truth the
[1:08:27] life I don't want to just hear about it
[1:08:29] I just want to be told about it I don't
[1:08:30] want to just believe that it's real I
[1:08:32] want to know it Lord for I shall know
[1:08:34] the truth and the truth shall make me
[1:08:37] make me free Lord liberate our Spirits
[1:08:41] create in us a clean heart renew the
[1:08:44] right spirit in US Lord that it can be
[1:08:46] steadfast with you I pray in the name of
[1:08:48] the Lord Jesus
[1:08:50] Christ
[1:08:52] amen amen
