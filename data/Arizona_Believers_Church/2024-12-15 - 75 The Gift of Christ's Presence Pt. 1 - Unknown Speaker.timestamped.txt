[0:00] Exodus 25 and verses
[0:04] 1-1 and the Lord spake unto Moses saying
[0:07] and now these next several verses are um
[0:11] God speaking he says speak unto the
[0:14] children of Israel that they bring me an
[0:16] offering of every man that giveth it
[0:18] willingly with his heart ye shall take
[0:20] my offering and this is the offering
[0:21] which you shall take of them gold and
[0:24] silver and brass and blue and purple and
[0:27] Scarlet and fine linen and goat's hair
[0:29] and Ram skins DED red and Badger skins
[0:32] and Sheet him wood oil for the light
[0:35] spices for anointing oil and for sweet
[0:38] incense onx stones and stones to be set
[0:40] in the ephod and in the breastplate and
[0:42] this is just the beginning and so
[0:46] there's so many details here and it says
[0:47] and let them make me a sanctuary that I
[0:50] may DW I may dwell among them so now you
[0:53] see the context of what he's asking
[0:55] these offerings for according to all
[0:57] that I show thee after the pattern of
[1:00] the Tabernacle and the pattern of all
[1:01] the instruments thereof even so shall
[1:04] you make it and they shall make an ark
[1:06] of sheum wood two cubits and a half
[1:08] shall be the length thereof and a cubit
[1:10] and a half the breadth thereof and a
[1:13] cubit and a half the height thereof and
[1:14] thou shalt overlay it with pure gold
[1:17] within and without shalt thou overlay it
[1:19] and shall make upon it a crown of gold
[1:22] round about amen we desire God would
[1:26] just bless these scriptures that we've
[1:28] read this this morning may may he just
[1:30] anoint it make it alive To Us by
[1:32] Revelation you can have your
[1:34] seats my my title today is the gift of
[1:38] God's Christ's present the gift of
[1:40] Christ's presence and it is continuing
[1:44] on the series that we've been on this
[1:46] year in the house of the Lord and I
[1:48] think this is the 75th sermon that we've
[1:51] used on this subject of the house of the
[1:52] Lord but the gift of Christ's presence I
[1:56] want to start with a statement from the
[1:58] sermon the Queen of Sheba and and it's
[2:00] just uh taking this one sentence out he
[2:03] said God gives gifts in all generations
[2:07] he's talking about how God had sent a
[2:08] gift to Israel and how the Queen of
[2:09] Sheba had heard about it had come and he
[2:11] said God gives gifts in all generations
[2:13] a gift of his presence what an amazing
[2:17] statement a gift of his presence I'm
[2:20] wanting to take uh instead of saying a
[2:23] gift of his presence but a gift of
[2:25] Christ's presence and I would say that
[2:28] there may be the intentional uh cliche
[2:31] and what is so common maybe this time of
[2:32] year is the play on words of presence
[2:34] Christmas presentence and presence and
[2:37] the question of whether or not uh or
[2:40] just using that phrase of God's presence
[2:43] with as far as being with someone and
[2:44] maybe the gifts that you would receive
[2:47] uh and so there may be that uh that
[2:49] thought kind of rattling around in my
[2:51] mind but I want to be very focused on
[2:53] the gift of God's presence or the gift
[2:55] of Christ's presence a gift of as
[2:58] brother Bram says his presence and I'm
[3:00] using the theme of Christmas using this
[3:02] Christmas season uh to highlight a
[3:05] particular aspect of the house of the
[3:06] Lord so I'm wanting to use maybe the
[3:09] subject matter of this time of year but
[3:12] emphasize something that is timeless
[3:14] something that is very important to us
[3:16] and as we're ministering on the house of
[3:18] the Lord we're coming to our conclusion
[3:20] of this series and I would say a climax
[3:22] to where wanting to zero in on the very
[3:25] thing that David when we started in part
[3:27] one one thing have I desired but what
[3:29] was was it that David wanted what was it
[3:31] that he valued what was it that really
[3:33] drove him to want to be in the house of
[3:36] the Lord and if I could say this now so
[3:39] that you're already thinking about it
[3:40] wasn't that he found a listing on Airbnb
[3:42] that was called the house of the Lord
[3:43] It's like man the senior is beautiful
[3:46] have you seen everything it's gold and
[3:47] he's just like this is perfect or he had
[3:49] been on Pinterest or Instagram and saw
[3:51] something that he wanted to visit there
[3:53] was something there something about the
[3:55] house that Drew him to it and I will say
[3:58] this before we much
[4:00] further uh and I know that I've
[4:02] articulated this in years past that uh
[4:06] whether or not you celebrate Christmas
[4:08] is not a Church decision in other words
[4:10] I as the pastor or we as the church
[4:12] don't decide whether or not you as
[4:14] families celebrate Christmas so it's not
[4:16] a Church decision it is a family
[4:18] decision and whatever decision a family
[4:20] makes we would respect that as Believers
[4:23] one to another respect the decision so
[4:25] if there's families here that don't say
[4:27] uh Merry Christmas and wouldn't even say
[4:29] happy happy holidays they wouldn't
[4:31] celebrate it and they don't exchange
[4:32] gifts uh and they and what I would say
[4:34] even no matter what the reasons were we
[4:37] respect that and we still respect them
[4:38] as brothers and sisters we love them and
[4:41] we would want to be supportive to them
[4:44] uh just as the world wouldn't want kids
[4:45] at school telling other kids at school
[4:47] that Santa Claus doesn't really exist uh
[4:50] we wouldn't want to be that guy that's
[4:51] telling somebody who doesn't celebrate
[4:53] Christmas and says well we do and
[4:55] there's nothing wrong with it and you
[4:56] guys are sad uh we we wouldn't want to
[4:59] be those kind of people because it's a
[5:01] family
[5:02] decision and if there's through the
[5:06] preaching of the word and I as the
[5:08] pastor I I'm just very conscious of this
[5:10] that if I'm
[5:12] emphasizing uh Christmas or I mention
[5:15] the birth of Christ or just use some
[5:17] themes in this holiday season it's not
[5:19] done to endorse celebrating it's not
[5:22] done to put pressure uh that we should
[5:24] all be wearing our green red and white
[5:27] uh that's not it at all it's just it's
[5:29] the season people are thinking about it
[5:31] and it gives us an opportunity to put
[5:33] things in a particular context even the
[5:35] word Christmas comes from Christ mass
[5:39] and we know that that phrase and that
[5:41] mass is uh very Latin it's C Catholic uh
[5:44] reminds me of the time when my brother
[5:46] was witnessing to somebody in Prescot
[5:47] and he was uh English wasn't their first
[5:49] language and so he was witnessing to
[5:51] them a and telling them that they they
[5:53] needed to come to Jesus and and in their
[5:56] broken English they said that they were
[5:58] alcoholic and and my brother said I know
[6:00] that's why you need God you you need God
[6:03] because because of that and that's it's
[6:05] proof that you need God and as he walked
[6:07] away he realized the guy said I'm
[6:09] Catholic and my brother thought he said
[6:11] he was an alcoholic and so either way
[6:13] the response you know was appropriate
[6:16] but uh we know that Christ mass is
[6:19] Catholic uh it's Catholic but uh it was
[6:23] originally meant uh to speak of it's
[6:27] speaks of celebrating the birth of
[6:30] Christ and so I want to work with that
[6:33] uh that thought of the birth of Christ
[6:35] and work with what the coming of Christ
[6:37] meant using this title The Gift of
[6:40] Christ's presence I have a friend that I
[6:42] went to law school with who was texting
[6:44] me last week and uh he was just
[6:47] mentioning I'm just and he's a good good
[6:49] good brother a good Christian and he
[6:51] said just looking forward to celebrating
[6:53] his coming and they're thinking about
[6:55] the Advent the coming of God in and the
[6:57] manger the coming of Christ in a Manger
[7:00] and though that might be the cliche and
[7:03] the phrases that the world use in
[7:05] reality that is what it is is it's a
[7:09] scriptural fulfillment of God's promise
[7:11] to come and there's something beautiful
[7:13] about it and it also fits with what in
[7:16] my heart has been a driving theme on the
[7:18] subject of the house of the Lord because
[7:20] the house of the Lord points to this
[7:22] very gift it points to this very thing
[7:24] and it highlights what was Central in
[7:26] God's heart and his desire in building
[7:28] the Tabernacle and the temple so if you
[7:30] could just take your Bibles and look at
[7:32] the text here that was my my intro and
[7:37] if if you need to ever refer back to
[7:39] those few moments just to understand the
[7:42] context uh it'll be it'll be there in
[7:44] the archives unless we scrub it and
[7:46] exodus 25: 1 to9 and let's just go back
[7:50] over this walk with me as we have a
[7:52] number of scriptures to read today says
[7:54] and the Lord spake unto Moses saying
[7:56] Speak unto the children of Israel that
[7:58] they bring me an offering of every man
[8:00] that giveth it willingly with his heart
[8:02] ye shall take my offering is that true
[8:05] as far as our giving and that we would
[8:07] want to do so willingly and give it with
[8:09] our heart and this is the offering which
[8:12] you shall take of them gold and silver
[8:14] and brass and blue and purple and
[8:17] Scarlet and fine linen and goats hair
[8:19] and RAM skins dyed red and Badger skins
[8:22] and sheum wood oil for the light spices
[8:24] for anointing o and for sweet incense
[8:27] onx stones and stones to be set in the
[8:29] ephod and in the breastplate this is a
[8:31] big list you know uh if God was given
[8:34] his wish list uh during the Christmas
[8:36] season he said well this is a this is
[8:38] pretty extensive couldn't you just say
[8:40] Playmobile or or maybe a bike but here
[8:43] he's asking for a lot of things gold
[8:45] silver brass fine linen oil spices onx
[8:48] stones and stones that are going to be
[8:49] set in the ephod and the breastplate
[8:51] these are things that are of high value
[8:53] and great worth and he wasn't just
[8:56] asking for it to fill his coffers and
[8:58] even or to to enrich Moses and his
[9:00] family but verse 8 tells us and let them
[9:04] make me a sanctuary that I may dwell
[9:08] among them he wanted all these elements
[9:10] and all these different things that were
[9:12] going to be given were to be given for
[9:14] the purpose of constructing a house
[9:16] constructing a Dwelling Place he calls
[9:18] it a sanctuary who was the sanctuary for
[9:21] God God wanted this Sanctuary that I may
[9:23] dwell among them he says make this
[9:25] according to all that I show thee after
[9:27] the pattern of the the Tabernacle in the
[9:30] pattern of all the instruments thereof
[9:32] even so shall ye make it so God showed
[9:35] him a tabernacle we could say a
[9:37] Tabernacle in heaven these things are
[9:39] patterned after heaven so we know there
[9:41] was a throne in heaven and the
[9:43] Tabernacle or the sanctuary was going to
[9:45] represent God's Throne on Earth and so
[9:48] the
[9:49] construction this tells us about the
[9:52] beginning God's request and desire uh to
[9:55] construct a tabernacle and the purpose
[9:58] of the Tabernacle and then even the
[10:00] temple that was later uh that the temple
[10:02] replaced and look at the details if we
[10:05] just look at the very beginning gold and
[10:06] silver and brass and fine
[10:08] linen uh this wouldn't be a cheap
[10:12] thing right the these are these things
[10:15] are the best if Moses stood up and said
[10:18] God is asking for an offering and God
[10:21] wants you to give and to give willingly
[10:22] from your heart a and everyone's
[10:24] thinking okay yeah we could do that the
[10:27] first thing that comes out of his mouth
[10:28] is gold
[10:30] right a and and it's kind of like oh
[10:35] okay well you could have said anything
[10:37] right Akin's over there
[10:39] going I don't know about this and so
[10:42] this is the very first thing is gold and
[10:44] silver and brass and maybe somebody he
[10:46] says gold they're like man I don't have
[10:47] any gold and he says silver I don't have
[10:48] any gold I work with brass and then
[10:51] brass so it's all it's it's he's asking
[10:53] for the best the fin Lin and oil and
[10:55] spices uh uh gems and all these precious
[10:58] materials God is say give willingly from
[11:00] your heart he's not going to demand it
[11:01] from them but give it because I want you
[11:03] to give the resources and of yourself
[11:06] and sacrifice to build this
[11:09] Tabernacle in First Kings chap 6: 11-4 I
[11:13] wanted to take this and read um about
[11:16] the temple that Solomon built that David
[11:18] desired to build and I know I'm drawing
[11:20] on 11 months worth of sermons uh as far
[11:23] as the house of the Lord a lot of
[11:25] details here and there and it says this
[11:27] and the word of the Lord came to Sol
[11:29] saying now remember David wanted to
[11:31] build a house for the Lord David wasn't
[11:33] allowed to build it Solomon is going to
[11:35] build it now God as he spoke to Moses is
[11:37] speaking to Solomon concerning this
[11:40] house which Thou Art in building if thou
[11:42] will walk in my statutes and execute my
[11:44] judgments and keep all my Commandments
[11:46] to walk in them the then will I perform
[11:49] my word with thee which I spake unto
[11:50] David thy father very direct promise to
[11:54] Solomon and the throne the kingship and
[11:58] God says again and I will dwell among
[12:01] the children of Israel and will not
[12:03] forsake My People Israel just as God had
[12:06] said in Exodus 25 about the Tabernacle
[12:09] which was temporary which was a tent
[12:11] that moved now this permanent structure
[12:14] called the temple that Solomon was built
[12:15] we could say Solomon's first temple he
[12:17] says I will dwell among the children of
[12:19] Israel and will not forsake My People
[12:21] Israel this is the purpose of the
[12:24] Tabernacle the purpose of the temple is
[12:26] that I will dwell among the children of
[12:28] isra Isel let them make me a sanctuary
[12:31] that I can dwell among them in verse 14
[12:33] says so Solomon built the house and
[12:36] finished it so we know the Tabernacle
[12:38] was finished and when they finished it
[12:40] the presence of God came the glory of
[12:41] God came the same thing happens with the
[12:44] temple and to I want to spare maybe the
[12:47] details and not take much time in it as
[12:49] I was studying it trying to piece things
[12:51] together and going through different
[12:52] things I found well instead of just
[12:54] reading all the scriptures uh that first
[12:57] scripture is enough to think to start
[12:59] considering just how much value was put
[13:02] into the
[13:04] Tabernacle and as I was
[13:06] looking uh and trying to run the math
[13:09] and and uh find resources of people
[13:12] who've already done the math I was
[13:14] Finding many instances or it was
[13:17] confirming that at least a there was at
[13:19] least a hundred billion dollars worth of
[13:21] materials just in gems and precious
[13:24] metals just just the materials of the
[13:26] gems and precious metals into the temple
[13:29] and it would cost up to
[13:31] $175 billion today if we were to rebuild
[13:35] the Temple cuz you can go you could read
[13:37] well they said they had this much gold
[13:38] and how many ounces of gold there were
[13:40] thousands of ounces of gold and how much
[13:42] this was and how much that was and and
[13:44] the seed is from Lebanon and somebody
[13:46] did the math and they've come up with
[13:48] this uh figure to say that it could be
[13:51] uh many are saying right in this
[13:52] Ballpark and I would say maybe even more
[13:55] at least
[13:57] $175 billion doll to rebuild the Temple
[14:00] today that is quite an edifice that's
[14:03] quite a structure and and that's not the
[14:06] manh hours that this is these are just
[14:08] the materials the value of the materials
[14:10] and the things that are put into it and
[14:14] going back to Exodus chapter
[14:16] 25 that God is saying bring these
[14:18] offerings to make me a sanctuary uh
[14:21] Solomon is going to rebuild it in a more
[14:22] permanent way but it's still the house
[14:24] of the Lord and God in verse 10 says and
[14:28] they shall make an ark of sheum wood two
[14:31] cubits and a half shall be the length
[14:33] thereof now I want you just to recognize
[14:36] that as soon as God says make me a
[14:38] sanctuary after the pattern I show you
[14:40] in heaven and the very first thing he
[14:42] begins to describe is the ark which is a
[14:45] word it means a chest it actually could
[14:47] be described as a translated to a coffin
[14:50] and it and it says and it shall be two
[14:52] cubits and a half shall be the length
[14:53] thereof and a cubit and a half the
[14:54] breadth thereof and a cubit and a half
[14:56] the height thereof and this Arc of the
[14:58] test testimony is going to continue to
[15:00] describe even all the way through to
[15:01] verse 22 in the elements of The Mercy
[15:04] Seat and in verse 11 it says and thou
[15:06] shalt overlay it with pure gold within
[15:09] and without shalt thou overlay it and
[15:11] shalt make upon it a crown of gold round
[15:15] about when there's times when you're
[15:17] constructing something and you're
[15:20] building uh whether it be Cabinetry or
[15:22] something like that or where's Brother
[15:23] Scott shelves you know you're building a
[15:25] library and there's certain things that
[15:26] are the finished side that you're going
[15:28] to see
[15:29] and and you you want to make sure that
[15:31] that's perfect and the side that's going
[15:32] to be up against the wall the part that
[15:34] nobody's ever going to see uh you don't
[15:36] need to worry about finishing that but
[15:39] God said I want every part inside
[15:42] outside every part overlaid with gold I
[15:44] don't want any wood
[15:45] showing and the Builder might say well
[15:48] there's no point in that that's going to
[15:49] be up against the wall or the lid's
[15:50] going to rest on that that's going to be
[15:51] on the inside there's going to be a ring
[15:53] put there you could you could save a lot
[15:55] of money in this building process if you
[15:57] don't uh try to fill all the these
[15:59] things in and do this and do that God
[16:00] says I don't want anything showing I
[16:03] want it overlaid completely with
[16:05] gold and just in this Arc alone in
[16:09] today's value there's over there's
[16:10] nearly $6 million in gold just on the
[16:13] ark should we go find
[16:16] it $6 million in gold just in the ark
[16:21] alone this is there's this is a lot of
[16:25] stuff of value and weight and and you
[16:28] can actually scripturally measure and
[16:30] just you could just use the current
[16:31] market price of gold and go find the
[16:33] ounces that are being described a and
[16:35] just do the math and realize there's a
[16:37] lot of money a lot of value a lot of
[16:38] precious material being put into the
[16:40] whole Temple but now just in the ark
[16:42] itself in the gold that would overlay
[16:45] the ark $6
[16:47] million in First Kings chapter 6: 19
[16:51] to30 read through this you're going to
[16:54] see the description
[16:56] of this Arc and this place in the temple
[17:00] and the Oracle he prepared in the house
[17:02] within to set there the Ark of the
[17:05] Covenant of the lord I want you to
[17:07] recognize the very first thing that God
[17:09] begins to describe to be built was the
[17:11] ark of the testimony he gives them
[17:13] instructions for the Tabernacle and he
[17:15] describes the Ark of the testimony and
[17:16] The Mercy Seat these are the very first
[17:19] elements God's beginning with the most
[17:21] interior the most holy place he doesn't
[17:24] start by saying let's put in a curb here
[17:25] and a sidewalk he begins with that
[17:27] central part and the Oracle he prepared
[17:30] in the house within to set there the Ark
[17:31] of the Covenant of the Lord Oracle you
[17:34] might seem like an odd statement the
[17:36] Oracle is being prepared uh Oracle means
[17:38] to speak or declare or command to
[17:41] promise to warn there's a an oracle of
[17:43] God it speaks of that convey but the
[17:46] Oracle here is the most holy place
[17:49] that's what's being described here is
[17:50] the holiest of
[17:55] holies and the Oracle in the four part
[17:57] was 20 cubits in length and 20 cubits in
[17:59] breadth and 20 cubits in height thereof
[18:01] I believe that's close to 30 ft and he
[18:04] overlaid it with pure gold and so
[18:07] covered the altar which was of Cedar so
[18:09] the Ark of the Covenant is overlaid with
[18:11] pure gold the Oracle all of it is
[18:14] overlaid with gold so Solomon overlaid
[18:17] the house within with pure gold let's
[18:21] just keep noticing how many references
[18:23] to this pure gold is and he made a
[18:25] partition by the chains of gold before
[18:28] the Oracle and he overlaid it with gold
[18:31] and the whole house he overlaid with
[18:33] gold until he had finished all the house
[18:36] also the whole altar that was by the
[18:38] Oracle he overlaid with gold I think
[18:41] there's a term for this over gold right
[18:44] you could could die from over
[18:46] gold and and within the Oracle he made
[18:49] two cherubims of olive tree and each 10
[18:52] cubits
[18:53] high and five cubits was the One Wing of
[18:56] the Cherub and five cubits the other
[18:58] wing of the Cherub from the uttermost
[19:00] part of the One Wing until the uttermost
[19:02] part of the other were 10 cubits and the
[19:05] other cherub was 10 cubits both the
[19:06] cherubims were of one measure and one
[19:08] size so there the same and the height of
[19:11] the one cherub was 10 cubits and so it
[19:13] was of the other cherub now consider
[19:17] just how enormous these were how big and
[19:20] vast they were say all of Olive Tree
[19:22] going to be fat fashioned out of wood
[19:24] and uh that would maybe be your cheapest
[19:26] construction and we might say well we
[19:27] could 3D print at that for are cheaper
[19:29] today but they're using wood they're
[19:31] using these different materials and this
[19:32] is what it's going to be and now as we
[19:34] continue reading just think of how vast
[19:37] these structures would be in this Oracle
[19:40] this Most Holy place and he set the
[19:42] cherubims within the inner house that's
[19:44] that most holy place not outer Court not
[19:46] inner Court in the most holy place the
[19:48] Oracle the place that God began to
[19:51] describe first or the very instrument
[19:54] that was going to be in that that place
[19:56] the Ark of the testimony the Ark of the
[19:58] Covenant first begin to describe that in
[20:00] Exodus 25 and then he begins to kind of
[20:03] basically he's working his way
[20:05] out here he says and he set the cheram
[20:07] within the inner house so they stretched
[20:09] forth the wings of the cheram so that
[20:10] the wing of the one touched the one wall
[20:13] and the wing of the other cherub touched
[20:14] the other wall and their wings touched
[20:16] one another in the midst of the house
[20:19] such a vast uh uh structure and he
[20:23] overlaid the Cherub boms with gold of
[20:25] course he did as you're reading through
[20:28] this this was overlaid this was overlaid
[20:29] this was overlaid one after another
[20:31] overlaid with gold overlaid with gold
[20:32] now these giant cherubs are overlaid
[20:35] with gold now remember the mercy seed as
[20:38] it was described in Exodus chapter 25
[20:41] was going to have cherubims that stretch
[20:43] their wings high and covered The Mercy
[20:45] Seat so this is the Reconstruction of
[20:48] this this is the replication of this in
[20:50] the
[20:51] temple and he overlaid the cherums with
[20:54] gold and he carved all the walls of the
[20:56] house round about with carved figures of
[20:57] cherums in palm trees and open flowers
[21:00] within and without as I was reading
[21:02] these scriptures last week how many
[21:04] times they put a Graven image in the
[21:08] house of the Lord that's something to
[21:10] chew on isn't
[21:11] it and the floor of the house was
[21:14] overlaid with gold within and without
[21:18] the floor was gold Hallelujah you think
[21:22] well surely we could just you know we
[21:23] just do a stained concrete that's
[21:26] economical and he goes in and overlays
[21:29] the floor with
[21:31] gold this is a pricey
[21:36] Endeavor this is everything is the the
[21:39] detail and you say well the gold means
[21:41] this and the gold means that yeah there
[21:42] all these things could be spoken of we
[21:44] could get into great detail in all these
[21:46] things because I believe God put the
[21:47] details in there for a reason we could
[21:49] get into what the wood represents and we
[21:51] could talk about what the cheram
[21:52] represent we could talk about all these
[21:54] different aspects because God is being
[21:56] very particular and being very precise
[21:58] why does he want gold silver and Brass
[22:00] why does he want fine linen why is there
[22:02] old and SP oil and spices why are all
[22:04] these things there well they mean
[22:05] something to God he's asking that they
[22:07] be willingly give and they must mean
[22:09] something to
[22:10] him now in verse chap uh excuse me in
[22:13] Exodus chapter 25 veres 21 and 22 we've
[22:17] read this quite a bit especially over
[22:18] the last several services on mercy and
[22:21] thou shalt Put The Mercy Seat above upon
[22:23] the ark and The Mercy Seat was overlaid
[22:25] with gold so it's put above upon the ark
[22:30] we've read about the Ark of the Covenant
[22:32] and in in just a moment ago and how
[22:35] that's the first thing that God starts
[22:36] with then he goes to the mercy seat and
[22:39] now he's putting The Mercy Seat upon the
[22:40] ark and in the ark Thou shalt put the
[22:43] testimony that I shall give thee and
[22:46] there I will meet with
[22:48] thee if you if we had taken time to
[22:51] describe the entire construction of the
[22:54] Tabernacle in the wilderness or the
[22:56] temple you'd find there's a lot of rooms
[22:59] there's a lot of square footage uh
[23:01] there's a porch and there's a inner
[23:03] there's an outer court and there's a lot
[23:05] of activity and a lot of pillars and a
[23:07] lot of entrances and there's a lot of
[23:08] things uh that exist in these structures
[23:11] both in the wilderness and in Jerusalem
[23:13] but he says and I will meet you there
[23:16] that's where I'll meet thee and I will
[23:18] commune with thee from Above The Mercy
[23:20] Seat from between the two cherubims
[23:23] which are upon the Ark of the testimony
[23:26] notice how precise God is being about
[23:28] where he's going to be so he's not
[23:30] saying well just come into my house and
[23:32] so we could just kind of hang out in the
[23:34] foyer or we could we could kind of walk
[23:36] the grounds and I'm not necessarily
[23:37] trying to make an analogy to this
[23:39] Sanctuary to the most holy place but it
[23:42] in just using it as a dramatization he's
[23:45] not just saying come and be on the
[23:47] campus and that's where I'm going to be
[23:49] I'm just going to kind of be in The
[23:50] Ether but I'm going to be in one place
[23:53] there between the cheram I will dwell
[23:56] there and I will commune I will speak I
[23:58] will will command we will Fellowship
[24:00] together he says above the mercy seat
[24:02] from between the two Terin which are
[24:04] upon the Ark of the testimony of all
[24:06] things which I'll give thee in
[24:07] commandment unto the children of
[24:10] Israel if you could just
[24:13] uh do this now with this singular
[24:18] Focus everything in the construction of
[24:22] the
[24:22] temple everything in the design of the
[24:25] house of the Lord everything in it
[24:28] purpose pointed to
[24:30] this and maybe I did uh a little bit of
[24:34] a disservice by not reading of the
[24:37] curtains in the Tabernacle made of goat
[24:39] hair and the bars and the coverings and
[24:41] the veils and all the different details
[24:43] and the Rings and The draperies and the
[24:46] all the ornamentation that was done in
[24:48] the temple and the carvings and the
[24:49] Engravings and all these things it's
[24:51] describing the greatest
[24:54] Cathedral the greatest thing so ornate
[24:58] so beautiful so much attention to
[25:00] details so many things are put in it and
[25:03] and it's if I think about maybe visiting
[25:05] a museum like the reiches museum or
[25:07] something and you go and you're just in
[25:09] awe of every painting and everything
[25:12] that is uh beautiful and even the
[25:14] construction of the facilities and
[25:16] everything's wonderful but this Temple
[25:20] there was everything pointed to One
[25:22] Singular
[25:24] place if you just begin to make a
[25:27] journey
[25:28] to the temple and if you arrived in
[25:31] Jerusalem and made your way to the steps
[25:33] and you walked up the porch every step
[25:35] from the outside of the temple through
[25:39] the outer Court into the inner court and
[25:41] Beyond the Veil it was all leading to
[25:43] this singular place it was all for the
[25:46] purpose of the manifestation that was
[25:48] between the
[25:49] cheram and what was it God's
[25:52] presence it's even what these cherubim
[25:55] symbolize they symbolize God's presence
[25:58] in Eden when God was going to seal off
[26:01] the way of the tree of life he set there
[26:03] cherabin with flaming swords to keep
[26:06] into guard so they are protectors they
[26:09] they they they show that there is a that
[26:13] God is there somewhere hidden somewhere
[26:17] between I was thinking of it and uh I
[26:20] think it's um where's my White House
[26:23] correspondence but brother Andrew is it
[26:25] a marine that stands guard outside there
[26:27] uh uh the uh in the at the White House
[26:29] in the West Wing if you want to know
[26:32] whether or not the president is in his
[26:33] office there's a marine that's standing
[26:35] guard right brother Mike stands guard
[26:37] right there outside the door now if he's
[26:39] not there guess
[26:40] what president ain't there so the chair
[26:44] if there's a cherub them it's it's
[26:46] declaring God's near God's somewhere
[26:49] this is what they represent this is what
[26:50] they uh
[26:52] symbolize and it's Hezekiah who's
[26:54] praying this and you could find this in
[26:56] the book of Psalm over and over in
[26:58] Isaiah chapter 37:16 Lord of hosts God
[27:01] of Israel that dwellest between the
[27:04] cherubims Thou Art the god even thou
[27:06] alone of all the kingdoms of the earth
[27:09] thou Hast made Heaven and
[27:12] Earth it's God's presence that was the
[27:15] singular objective and focus and purpose
[27:18] of the house of the Lord It's all
[27:19] leading everything channeling everything
[27:21] moving to this one place so we kind of
[27:23] look at it from the start and we're over
[27:25] here way over here and we make our way
[27:27] if we were going to go on a pilgrimage
[27:28] to Jerusalem where it would begin and
[27:30] everything would move and move and move
[27:32] and we would come to Jerusalem and we
[27:34] would walk our way in and everything's
[27:36] leading to that very place where you
[27:37] would pass through the veil into the
[27:39] most holy Place into the Oracle and you
[27:41] would behold the Ark of the Covenant and
[27:44] the mercy seat and the presence of God
[27:47] that would dwell there between the
[27:49] cherubim but for God when he begins to
[27:52] describe the construction of the
[27:53] Tabernacle he begins with that
[27:55] place he begins with the Ark of the
[27:58] testimony and The Mercy Seat because it
[28:00] was his that was where he would
[28:03] be he would dwell
[28:05] there the Ark of the Covenant I'm just
[28:07] going to spend maybe the remainder of
[28:09] our time looking at this the symbolic
[28:11] nature of the Ark of the Covenant the
[28:13] ark as I mentioned before the word
[28:15] refers to a chest even took that type of
[28:17] how the chest now he's it he's written
[28:20] his word in our hearts and that we are
[28:21] representation even of this and this Arc
[28:24] or chest it comes from the word the root
[28:26] word is in the sense of gathering
[28:29] and so it's the Gathering or this chest
[28:31] or this Ark a gathering of his Covenant
[28:35] and a covenant is an allegiance with
[28:38] something or Allegiance between parties
[28:41] or an alliance now I'm going to take the
[28:43] phrase and say then this Ark of the
[28:45] Covenant it represents this Gathering of
[28:48] God's alliance with Israel this is what
[28:51] it's going to rep you're going to see
[28:52] represented here these elements and
[28:55] inside it whether it be the law the
[28:56] golden pot of Mana Aaron's rod these
[28:59] things are symbol symbolizing and
[29:01] representing I believe it's maybe
[29:02] Hebrews 9:4 it's representing uh the
[29:05] Covenant of God with Israel and this was
[29:08] his Covenant who say well the Ark of the
[29:11] testimony the Ark of the Covenant which
[29:12] which promise was it the promise was I
[29:15] will dwell among the children of Israel
[29:18] I will form a relationship with them the
[29:22] Covenant is an allegiance or Alliance
[29:24] where God is going to be related to and
[29:26] establish himself in position with and
[29:29] among the children of Israel so the Ark
[29:32] of the Covenant is the chest or the
[29:34] Gathering of God's relationship to
[29:36] Israel his identification with Israel
[29:39] and the fact that he wanted to dwell
[29:40] among
[29:41] them now as we've come to this part I
[29:44] realize it's very surface maybe very
[29:46] shallow Elementary view of the
[29:49] Tabernacle and the temple the things
[29:50] that made it up and and and maybe the
[29:52] takeaway might be just how much it would
[29:54] have cost to build it but I want to look
[29:57] I want to turn to First Samuel chapter 4
[29:59] so I will 1st Samuel CH 4: 1-22 read
[30:02] this entire story here and maybe
[30:05] intersperse a couple things or go back
[30:07] and forth in this and we're making
[30:10] really good times so I don't foresee us
[30:11] being here much
[30:13] longer uh I'm not necessar talking about
[30:16] the Rapture but that sure would be nice
[30:18] wouldn't
[30:20] it 1 Samuel chapter 4: 1 to
[30:23] 22 now I'm wanting to it just H I feel
[30:27] it just has to come here here so maybe a
[30:28] lot of momentum and talking about the
[30:30] singular focus and this place within the
[30:32] temple and it revolves around this Arc
[30:35] of the Covenant because there's where
[30:36] God's going to be
[30:37] dwelling now I feel impressed to use
[30:41] this
[30:42] scripture to really emphasize the
[30:45] importance of what made the house of the
[30:47] Lord the house of the
[30:49] Lord and it might be just really
[30:52] Elementary to say if we were to say it
[30:55] in more concise language the Lord's
[30:57] House
[30:59] and as we might say to someone that well
[31:01] that's John's house or that's Mark's
[31:03] house and so it denotes possession and
[31:05] if someone said that's John's house you
[31:06] would assume that that would be where he
[31:08] dwelt and where he lived and where his
[31:10] residence would be and we might not even
[31:13] use that language of somebody who owns a
[31:14] rental property and we might say well
[31:16] there that's a that's an investment
[31:18] property of his and that's this but this
[31:20] if you say at someone's house it
[31:22] signifies their dwelling place and so
[31:26] what made the house of the Lord the
[31:28] house of the
[31:29] Lord the
[31:32] Lord wow did we learn something today
[31:35] can we all just go eat now there's a
[31:38] tendency then especially if you put this
[31:40] much gold silver and brass and finery
[31:43] and all these chains of gold and all
[31:45] these curtains and all these veils and
[31:47] all this beautiful adorning there's
[31:49] something about the structure itself and
[31:51] the ceremony the tradition that can
[31:54] really be uh you could gravitate
[31:56] to and that you could be in awe of and I
[32:00] believe 1st Samuel chapter 4 I'm just it
[32:03] kind of it's going to kind of be wedged
[32:04] in here we had a lot of moment on on
[32:06] these things but now all of a sudden I
[32:07] want to take a step back and say be
[32:09] careful because there's something about
[32:11] the house of the Lord that made it so
[32:13] special says and the word of Samuel came
[32:15] to all
[32:16] Israel now Israel went out against the
[32:18] Philistines to battle now that's I know
[32:21] this is chapter
[32:22] 4 uh and we see the bringing up in the
[32:25] first few chapters of this prophet
[32:26] Samuel and so the phase
[32:28] and the word of Lord of Samuel came to
[32:30] all Israel is a phrase in itself to kind
[32:33] of set the time period and then you have
[32:34] now Israel went out against the
[32:36] Philistines to battle and pitched beside
[32:38] ebenezzer and the Philistines pitched in
[32:40] AEK and the Philistines put themselves
[32:43] in Array against Israel and when they
[32:44] had joined battle Israel was smitten
[32:47] before the Philistines and they slew of
[32:49] the Army in the field about 4,000 men
[32:52] and when the people were com into the
[32:54] camp the Elders of Israel said wherefore
[32:57] hath the Lord smitten us today before
[32:59] the Philistines let us fetch the Ark of
[33:02] the Covenant of the Lord out of Shiloh
[33:05] un us then when it cometh Among Us it
[33:08] may save us out of the hand of our
[33:10] enemies now the very first verse of
[33:14] chapter 4 says and the word of go Samuel
[33:16] came to all Israel so God had called
[33:19] Samuel to be a prophet I believe it is
[33:21] in chapter three where says and God did
[33:22] not let any of the words of Samuel fall
[33:24] to the ground so we realize that God has
[33:26] established Samuel as a prophet and the
[33:28] word of God is coming through Samuel so
[33:31] it's the word of Samuel comes to Israel
[33:33] and it seems to be a peculiar phrase
[33:35] because the very next thing says Israel
[33:36] went out to battle against the
[33:38] Philistines and they lost and having
[33:40] lost they said why did we lose and their
[33:42] response is go get the Ark of the
[33:45] Covenant of the Lord and bring it to the
[33:47] battlefield that it may save us out of
[33:49] the hand of our enemies and to this
[33:50] point not one mention of
[33:53] Samuel there's nothing said of Samuel
[33:56] they didn't inquire of the prophet they
[33:58] neither to go to battle nor to just in
[34:01] the reading of this nor in response to
[34:03] why did we
[34:04] lose but they're thinking let's go get
[34:07] the Ark of the Covenant of the
[34:09] Lord I know some of you are reading
[34:11] ahead but slow down so the people sent
[34:14] to Shiloh that they might bring then the
[34:16] Ark of the Covenant of the Lord of host
[34:18] which dwelleth between the cherubims it
[34:21] so often uses this phrase and I believe
[34:24] the repetition is necessary to recognize
[34:26] that God identified himself with this
[34:28] place so bring the Ark of the Covenant
[34:29] of Lord which dwelleth between the
[34:30] cheram and the two sons of
[34:33] Eli hne in penas now I know that we
[34:37] might might say Phineas or
[34:40] finus the way I learned it years ago was
[34:43] in the Hebrew uh not being Hebrew I
[34:45] guess I could say Phineas just as
[34:47] well but Hof and aenas Fus penhos were
[34:52] there with the Ark of the Covenant of
[34:54] God so he comes and he's the sons of the
[34:57] high priest there with the
[34:59] ark and when the Ark of the com of the
[35:02] Lord came into the camp all Israel
[35:04] shouted with the great shout so that the
[35:06] Earth rang again woo
[35:10] Glory right what a meeting let's use
[35:13] this at a camp meeting and there's a
[35:16] great shout and the Philistines heard
[35:17] the noise of the shout let the devil
[35:19] hear your praise right let the enemy
[35:21] hear your shout and they said what meth
[35:24] the noise of this great shout in the
[35:26] camp of the Hebrews now what watch this
[35:28] and they understood that the Ark of the
[35:30] Lord was coming into the camp the Ark of
[35:33] the Lord has come into Israel's camp and
[35:36] the Philistines were afraid get the
[35:37] devil on the Run believer for they said
[35:41] God is coming to the camp and they said
[35:43] woe unto us for there hath not been such
[35:46] a thing here here to for woe unto us who
[35:49] shall deliver us out of the hand of
[35:50] these Mighty
[35:52] Gods these are the gods that smoke the
[35:55] Egyptians with all the plagues in the
[35:56] wilderness be strong quit yourselves
[35:58] like men oh ye Philistines that you be
[36:00] not servants up unto the Hebrews as they
[36:03] have been to you quit yourselves like
[36:05] men and
[36:06] fight and the Philistines fought and
[36:08] Israel was smitten and they fled every
[36:10] man into his tent and there was a great
[36:12] Slaughter for their fell of Israel
[36:14] 30,000
[36:15] footmen it's a terrible
[36:18] loss and the Ark of the God was
[36:22] taken and the two sons of Eli hne and
[36:26] Phineas FAS p us were
[36:30] slain I believe it's Hof n is how you
[36:33] say that but I don't want to have it's
[36:35] going to sound like a crowded room once
[36:36] you start giving all these other
[36:38] names but hofn and Phineas were slain so
[36:42] they were there with the ark the sons of
[36:44] the high priest sons of Eli were there
[36:45] with the ark it was taken and they were
[36:47] slain now I want this to be a lesson I
[36:51] want to finish this reading and then
[36:52] read a long statement from the choosing
[36:54] of the Bride to finish but there's a
[36:56] great lesson about the Ark of the
[36:57] Covenant In God's Presence
[36:59] here that the Ark of the Covenant the
[37:02] temple the Tabernacle they represent
[37:03] something there's details there's
[37:05] elements there's types there's shadows
[37:07] and there's something very precious
[37:09] about we could say the Ark of the
[37:10] Testament Arc of the Covenant In God's
[37:12] Presence there's power in his presence
[37:13] there's
[37:14] protection but in this time of battle
[37:16] and the word of Samuel was coming to all
[37:18] Israel they go into this battle to fight
[37:21] but Israel was not reverencing God's
[37:22] presence that was among them there was
[37:25] no open Vision it tells us in 1st Samuel
[37:27] the one and the it was precious it was
[37:29] unique and they needed God to speak to
[37:31] them they needed a prophet that could
[37:32] restore them back to true worship and
[37:35] they were not reverencing God and
[37:37] despite the fact that they were not
[37:38] serving God and doing what he asked they
[37:40] still went to battle against their
[37:42] enemies as a matter of fact if you were
[37:44] to look in 1st Samuel chapter 2:2 it
[37:47] says now the sons of Eli were sons of B
[37:49] that means worthless no good they knew
[37:52] not the Lord so these two sons haai and
[37:56] Phineas were were doing
[38:00] evil uh and and by their evil the Bible
[38:02] says they were causing the people to
[38:05] transgress they were taking the Choice
[38:07] Meats and the sacrifices and eating them
[38:08] for themselves they were sleeping with
[38:10] the women that came to offer and there
[38:11] was and it the Bible says they were
[38:13] causing by the way of their leadership
[38:15] their example and the way that they
[38:16] worship all the people of Israel were
[38:22] transgressing and when Israel had lost
[38:25] in the
[38:26] battle and they're like man we lost they
[38:29] said go get the Ark of the Covenant and
[38:31] I want to say this falsely
[38:34] LED they brought the Ark of the Covenant
[38:36] to the battlefield saying this will save
[38:38] us from our enemies and there's no
[38:41] objection from the sons of
[38:44] Eli and being falsely led to bring the
[38:47] Ark of the Covenant this is a very
[38:48] simple thought that we've now narrowed
[38:49] ourselves down to and I want to make
[38:50] this very clear they believed that the
[38:53] Ark of the testimony the Ark of the
[38:55] Covenant and The Mercy Seat they brought
[38:58] it to the battlefield as if it had power
[39:00] in
[39:02] itself and what I want to say here is
[39:05] not just tradition but
[39:08] Superstition they treated the ark as it
[39:10] was some sort of magical charm a
[39:12] Talisman or something that they could
[39:15] bring it on the battlefield and it would
[39:17] work on their behalf without faith or
[39:21] obedience like well this is where God
[39:23] dwells just plant it here on the
[39:24] battlefield and let's watch all of our
[39:26] enemies
[39:28] run and they had confidence and we got
[39:31] to really listen now I know may be a
[39:33] little warm and it might have been a
[39:34] long week and we're really tired and
[39:35] we're looking forward to next week and
[39:37] all the gifts and the reindeer games I
[39:39] want you to focus right now they had
[39:41] confidence in the
[39:43] artifact and the Very instinct to not go
[39:47] to the word the prophet but to go to the
[39:49] artifact showed that there was some sort
[39:51] of tendency to idolatry in their
[39:54] hearts and they were going to lift
[39:56] something that was precious something
[39:58] that was value something that God said
[39:59] I'll meet you there and I'll meet you
[40:01] between the cherums something that was
[40:03] wonderful but they were lifting it above
[40:05] its true
[40:07] purpose and if you want you say well
[40:09] brother Aaron uh let's let's really tap
[40:12] the brakes there the only evidence I
[40:14] need to admit into this is the fact that
[40:17] the Philistines felt the same
[40:21] way the Philistines being heathens they
[40:24] were
[40:25] superstitious and and they looked to
[40:28] artifacts and the multiplicity of gods
[40:30] and they believed in superstitious
[40:32] things and this would do this and this
[40:34] does that and they held the same
[40:37] Superstition that Israel did Israel said
[40:40] go fetch the ark and as it comes into
[40:41] the Camp W what a meeting shouting and
[40:45] dancing and praising and the Israelites
[40:47] the enemy sees and say oh no oh no
[40:49] they've got the ark oh they've got the
[40:51] ark that's where they got the Gods in
[40:53] their camp now why because they're
[40:55] superstitious
[40:58] and the Philistines themselves
[40:59] attributed the power to the ark the
[41:02] Philistines lacked zero understanding
[41:04] because they didn't say they're God they
[41:06] said gods and their gods were Mighty in
[41:08] Egypt their gods were Mighty in doing
[41:09] this so they had no understanding they
[41:11] had nothing but Superstition and the
[41:14] Israelites are acting as if they have no
[41:16] faith no understanding or acting
[41:19] superstitious verse 5 said when the Ark
[41:21] of the Covenant of the Lord came into
[41:23] the camp all Israel shouted with the
[41:24] great shout so that the Earth rained
[41:28] again it caused shouting it caused
[41:32] praise great demonstration of worship
[41:34] and fear among the enemy but God was not
[41:40] in
[41:43] it over $6 Million worth of gold on the
[41:46] battlefield and they just assumed well I
[41:49] could just rub the gravestone I can just
[41:51] wear the belt buckle I can go to church
[41:53] listen we do the same thing to our
[41:55] churches we treat this and I think
[41:58] somebody in a derisive way said well
[42:01] that's a cute Church brother Aaron and I
[42:03] was like well
[42:05] okay brother BR said if you see a church
[42:07] that's wealthy God's not in
[42:11] it I mean we got horseflies and
[42:15] dust you know how soon to the church age
[42:17] book is just completely
[42:19] repudiated well you know let's leave 's
[42:21] book
[42:24] anyways that there we could do the same
[42:28] thing with church this is the house of
[42:30] the Lord we reverence the
[42:33] sanctuary and we want to we want we want
[42:35] to serve we want to serve the church and
[42:37] we want to do things for the body of
[42:39] Christ and we want but then what we're
[42:40] doing is we've turned the church into an
[42:43] artifact we've turned the church group
[42:45] into a Talisman a magic charm that we
[42:48] can somehow just reverence the sanctuary
[42:50] and reverence the deacons and show honor
[42:52] to the pastor and we could all just play
[42:55] our part and do our role that we're
[42:57] somehow going to be Victorious and what
[42:58] we've done is we're acting
[42:59] superstitiously we're acting
[43:01] traditionally and the very thing that
[43:03] makes this thing here today even worth
[43:06] it is Christ's presence but we could go
[43:08] through all the form and all the
[43:09] shouting and the devil might be like w I
[43:11] don't know what's going on there she
[43:12] looks like church what's going to happen
[43:14] but God's not even in it and the devil
[43:17] just says you know what we can overcome
[43:18] I started this we're going to we're
[43:20] going to do battle we're going to fight
[43:21] you going to show up for a fight and
[43:22] find out God's not in it and whip us
[43:27] God's presence was not about
[43:30] tradition God's presence wasn't the
[43:33] ritual God's presence wasn't in the
[43:35] overlan of gold and all these things
[43:38] God's presence was about faith it was
[43:40] about
[43:42] relationship the Ark of the testimony
[43:44] the Ark of the Covenant yes there's a
[43:46] lot of symbolism yes there's a lot of
[43:48] foreshadowing yes there's a lot of
[43:50] details in it but God did not create
[43:53] this edifice and just look down from
[43:55] above and say well I hope they like
[43:57] their church that I caused them to build
[43:59] I mean man that's beautiful that's
[44:01] really nice I hope they enjoy themselves
[44:03] I hope they can play Church you know
[44:04] have a place they could just get away
[44:06] and you know some people golf on Sundays
[44:07] we just go to church and we like to hear
[44:09] the word put in a certain way kind of
[44:11] scratches that itch and we just kind of
[44:12] treat this like
[44:14] Recreation but God said no I want to
[44:17] come down and form
[44:20] relationship I want to be identified
[44:22] with Israel and this identification even
[44:25] as he told
[44:27] like if you will keep my Commandments
[44:29] and you'll walk in my ways I will keep
[44:30] my Covenant with you in your house as I
[44:32] promised your father David and so God
[44:35] wanted to dwell amongst them but he
[44:36] couldn't dwell amongst them without
[44:39] faith without trust and he wanted there
[44:42] to be
[44:43] relationship so if I could say this the
[44:46] AR the the house of the Lord held no
[44:50] value without God in it well brother
[44:53] you're wrong it's $175 billion is what
[44:55] it would cost today I'm to where I heard
[44:57] that but that's how much it would cost
[44:58] to build it today plenty of value in it
[45:00] brother Aaron there was $6 Million worth
[45:01] of gold in today's value on that
[45:02] Battlefield that day you can't say there
[45:03] was no value in it the Arc of the
[45:06] Covenant held no value without God in
[45:10] it value is related to
[45:14] purpose you could take something if now
[45:16] just maybe for our for those who are
[45:20] doing the
[45:22] math the salvage value of a
[45:25] car is really related to the
[45:28] materials a value in
[45:31] it but as long as as it's useful for the
[45:35] purpose that it has been built it's
[45:36] exponentially worth
[45:38] more you go to buy sell a used truck and
[45:41] someone say well y'all buy it for $5,000
[45:44] and they have someone take a look at it
[45:46] and they look at it and brother Frank
[45:48] Mader says this thing's
[45:51] toast you can't you can't drive it it's
[45:53] only it's good for scrap and all of a
[45:55] sudden a car that would have been worth
[45:56] $5,000 is worth less than $1,000 $1,000
[46:00] like we could scrap it we can maybe get
[46:01] this part we can get that part so when
[46:03] you look at the temple and you look at
[46:05] that money I want you to think of that's
[46:07] the scrap value of the temple so that's
[46:11] a lot of money brother Ah that's the
[46:12] scrap value it's God that made it worth
[46:16] it it's God that was in it that made it
[46:20] valuable despite its worth in billions
[46:23] its greatest value its greatest feature
[46:25] was Christ
[46:27] present God's presence in
[46:33] there the Bible says that the Ark of God
[46:36] was
[46:37] taken and the sons of Eli dead verse 12
[46:42] and there ran a man of Benjamin out of
[46:43] the army and came to Shiloh the same day
[46:46] with his clothes rent and with the Earth
[46:48] upon his head and so there had been
[46:49] great weeping and wailing and when he
[46:51] came low Eli sat upon a seat by the
[46:53] wayside watching for his heart trembled
[46:56] for the Ark of God I want you to
[46:59] recognize where Eli's greatest concern
[47:01] was and when the man came into the City
[47:03] and told it all the city cried out and
[47:06] when Eli heard the noise of the crying
[47:08] he said what meaneth the noise of this
[47:10] tumult and the man came in hastily and
[47:12] told Eli now Eli was 98 years old and
[47:16] his eyes were dim that he could not see
[47:19] the man said unto Eli I am he that come
[47:21] out of the army and I fled today out of
[47:25] the army and he said what is there done
[47:27] my son and the messenger answered and
[47:29] said Israel has fled before the
[47:32] Philistines and there hath been also a
[47:34] great Slaughter among the people and thy
[47:37] two sons
[47:40] also hni and thus are
[47:46] dead and the Ark of God is taken that's
[47:49] some serious news your sons are dead in
[47:51] the ark the one thing he was troubled
[47:54] about and you would think that the
[47:56] father would grieve he would whail he
[47:58] would lament In This Moment over over
[47:59] this news certainly but notice how the
[48:01] Bible says this and it came to pass when
[48:03] he made mention of the Ark of God not
[48:05] his two sons the Ark of God that he fell
[48:07] from off the seat backward by the side
[48:09] of the gate and his neck break and he
[48:10] died as we say today that escalated
[48:15] quickly he hears this news of the Ark
[48:20] and it's the ark that causes him to no
[48:24] his Instinct isn't to weep and lament
[48:26] the fact that sons have died he had
[48:27] warned them he had spoke and warned them
[48:29] in the prior chapter if you do this
[48:31] God's going to judge you you can't live
[48:33] this way you can't act that way You' got
[48:35] to reference this so it was no surprise
[48:38] to him that perhaps his sons were dead
[48:41] but when they made mention of the Ark
[48:42] that's what caused him to suffer this
[48:45] terrible
[48:47] death and he had judged Israel 40 years
[48:49] and his
[48:50] daughter-in-law phineas's wife was with
[48:52] child near to be delivered and when she
[48:54] heard the tidings notice that
[48:57] that the Ark of God was taken so this is
[49:00] part of the whr and that her
[49:01] father-in-law and her husband were dead
[49:03] she bowed herself and travailed for her
[49:05] pains Came Upon her this story is just
[49:08] keep look at verse 20 this is like
[49:11] another job scenario J chap one and
[49:13] about the same time of her death so she
[49:15] dies in giving birth to this child the
[49:18] woman that stood by her said unto her
[49:21] fear not for thou Hast borne a son but
[49:23] she's dead but she answered not neither
[49:26] did she regard it and so they and she
[49:30] named I believe it's this uh the woman
[49:32] stood by named the child ibad saying and
[49:36] this is the meaning the glory is
[49:38] departed from Israel because the Ark of
[49:41] God was
[49:43] taken and because of her father-in-law
[49:46] and her husband and she said this is the
[49:49] utterance when she speaks now the glory
[49:52] is departed from
[49:54] Israel for the Ark of God
[49:57] is
[49:59] taken what is it the glory of God the
[50:02] shikina now that the ark was gone they
[50:05] realize with this
[50:07] gone God's that's where God said he
[50:09] would dwell with
[50:10] us this is where God said he would meet
[50:14] us now I have no confidence that the
[50:19] sons of Eli and even the elders that
[50:21] asked for the ark to be brought in were
[50:23] conscious enough in that moment to be
[50:25] like we have made a ter terrible mistake
[50:28] we thought the Arc of the Covenant would
[50:29] solve all our problems but what was
[50:31] missing was our dedication and our Zeal
[50:33] for
[50:35] God I I I don't have any confidence that
[50:37] they would recognize that it wasn't the
[50:39] magical charm it wasn't the ark itself
[50:41] but it was their failure to respect and
[50:43] honor God's word that what made the
[50:46] house of the Lord was the Lord what the
[50:49] Ark of the Covenant was supposed to
[50:50] represent when they said Fetch and go
[50:53] get the Ark of the co oh wait wait a
[50:56] minute wait a minute the Ark of the
[51:00] Covenant Brothers do you realize what
[51:01] this means in the Covenant is the law in
[51:05] the Covenant is the golden Mana the pot
[51:07] of gold pot of gold with Mana in there
[51:09] is Aaron's Rod what do that testify God
[51:12] is with us he promised to fight our
[51:14] battles he said he would drive the enemy
[51:16] out from before us if we would just look
[51:18] to him and believe him and do all he
[51:19] said and instead of renting their
[51:21] clothes and covering their face with
[51:23] dirt and weeping and Welling and
[51:25] repenting before God for their lack of
[51:27] faithfulness and recognizing what that
[51:30] symbolized in coming back to God's
[51:32] presence they ran and just went to
[51:34] church they just grabbed the
[51:37] artifact they just made a pilgrimage to
[51:42] Jeffersonville but there was no victory
[51:44] in
[51:46] it I'm closing with this lengthy
[51:49] statement I think I've provided it on
[51:50] these slides so you can just read along
[51:52] with me cuz I want to look at this term
[51:54] kabot and I want you to look at it in
[51:55] the time that we're living in now
[51:57] brother bram's coming to the very end of
[51:59] this sermon and the choosing of a bride
[52:00] it's right this is beginning just before
[52:02] he prays I'm going to say this for my
[52:04] first time over the
[52:07] pulpit I've stretched out farther
[52:09] tonight on this than I have on anything
[52:11] else anytime anyhow before the public
[52:14] because I've had a great freedom in
[52:15] these meetings the choosing of a
[52:19] bride he's going to come and preach the
[52:23] invisible Union
[52:31] if you believe me to be God's
[52:34] Prophet you listen to what I've told
[52:37] you if there's one little tinkle of
[52:39] feeling in your heart you go to God
[52:41] right now you do it he says stop just a
[52:45] minute men look at your Creeds that you
[52:49] serve I say that's to the men here look
[52:51] at the Creeds that you serve now you say
[52:54] well brother a we just have one Creed
[52:55] and it's Christ
[52:57] um
[52:58] okay no that's what your cre Credo
[53:02] is what do you
[53:05] serve what dictates your fellowship with
[53:08] Brethren what dictates your faithfulness
[53:10] to church what determines how you treat
[53:11] your wife and your children what is it
[53:13] that drives you and motivates you what's
[53:15] your
[53:18] Creed that you serve look in your
[53:20] churches is it just exactly with the
[53:23] word of God have you met every
[53:25] qualification
[53:27] say I'm a good man so was Nicodemus and
[53:29] so was all the rest they were fine that
[53:31] don't have nothing to do with it and
[53:34] women I want you to look in the mirror
[53:37] not a difficult
[53:39] ask and look what God requires a woman
[53:42] to
[53:42] do and see in God's mirror not in your
[53:46] church mirror now in God's mirror and
[53:48] see if you could qualify in your life
[53:51] the spiritual bride of Jesus
[53:54] Christ men look in the mirror and ask
[53:57] yourself is this how a man should act
[53:59] how he should live how he should talk
[54:02] how he should treat others how he should
[54:03] fill up his time is this the way that a
[54:05] man should be according to the word and
[54:07] women do the same too look in the word
[54:10] of God and ask yourself is this the way
[54:12] a daughter of God would dress and act
[54:14] and present herself according to the
[54:16] word in this
[54:18] hour thank you Lord he says ministers
[54:22] think the
[54:23] same do you cut Corners here to save
[54:26] somebody's feelings over
[54:30] Yonder would you do this if they'll put
[54:32] you out of the church if you're feeling
[54:35] that way my dear brother let me warn you
[54:37] in the name of Jesus Christ flee from
[54:39] that right now and lady if you can't
[54:42] measure up to the qualification of a
[54:44] Christian not as a nominal Christian
[54:46] what would be the nominal Christian the
[54:48] one that's superstitious the one that's
[54:51] tradition the one that keeps just enough
[54:53] of the the visual things to be able to
[54:55] appear as if their Believers this is
[54:57] what the Philistines saw that day when
[54:59] the Ark of the Covenant showed up on the
[55:01] battlefield yeah they've had a great
[55:02] battle they lost but now all they they
[55:04] brought the Arc of the Covenant back
[55:06] they're saying the right things they're
[55:07] they're kind of doing the right things
[55:09] and there's a little bit of fear on the
[55:10] enemy's part but the enemy got ready to
[55:13] do battle they said oh they're Gods with
[55:15] them but let's let's quit like men let's
[55:17] go fight let's go fight the fight's
[55:19] still coming and in that moment don't
[55:21] look to the magical charm and put your
[55:23] hands on all these other superstitions
[55:25] and traditions you you better know that
[55:27] God is with
[55:29] you amen thank you Lord not as a nominal
[55:34] Christian but in your heart and your
[55:36] life is patterned exactly like God's
[55:38] marriage certificate here says it has to
[55:40] be church member if your church isn't
[55:43] like that can measure up to God's
[55:45] qualification of his word get out of it
[55:48] and get into
[55:50] Christ he doesn't say that very often
[55:53] does he but he's running out of time
[55:56] April 1965 he is having to say
[56:00] look don't just show up to a an
[56:06] artifact that's got all the trappings of

[58:29] see lord it's in
[58:31] love thou bearest me record almighty God

[58:41] California bear me record oh God if it
[58:45] would happen tonight I've told the truth
[58:48] you know us this vision of the Bride is
[58:50] the truth I've took your name by it Lord
[58:52] and said it was thus sayith the Lord and
[58:54] I feel that I'm conscious Lord of what
[58:56] I'm doing so I pray thee Lord in Jesus
[58:59] name I want you to hear these these
[59:01] statements now let people shake
[59:04] themselves tonight and flee from the
[59:07] Wrath that has come for ikabod is wrote
[59:10] over the doors and over the
[59:13] Nations do you realize just how much
[59:15] brother brandham
[59:17] fits the ministry of
[59:20] Samuel I will Deuteronomy 18 I raise up
[59:23] a prophet like unto thee God is is now
[59:25] speaking in establishing that he's going
[59:27] to use prophets the first one he raises
[59:30] up after that order is
[59:33] Samuel and here his rebuke notice how
[59:39] pertinent is in the age if you go and
[59:40] study the book of Samuel how this he
[59:42] says kabot is written over the doors and
[59:44] over the Nations a black check mark has
[59:47] come across it the spirit of God is
[59:50] grieved away from it they're weighed in
[59:53] the balances and found wanting
[59:56] I want us to challenge ourselves about
[59:59] whether or not we know where God's
[1:00:01] presence is whether or not we value it
[1:00:05] whether or not it's something that is
[1:00:07] real to
[1:00:10] us because there are things that can
[1:00:12] cause us to
[1:00:13] shout there are things that are resemble
[1:00:16] and have pertain to and look like God's
[1:00:20] presence or or symbols of his presence
[1:00:22] or markers of his presence and just as
[1:00:24] Israel on that day in the Battlefield
[1:00:26] brought the Ark of the Covenant and
[1:00:28] assumed that God was with them on the
[1:00:30] basis that the Covenant was there and
[1:00:32] that also the Philistines themselves
[1:00:34] assumed upon the basis that the Ark of
[1:00:36] the Covenant was there that God was with
[1:00:38] them but yet the reality was that God
[1:00:41] was no longer with
[1:00:43] them brother brand is saying this now
[1:00:46] about the world and denominations he
[1:00:47] said they've been weighed in the balance
[1:00:49] and found wanting God is grieved away
[1:00:51] from it then he brings up a whole
[1:00:53] another area that we could look at the
[1:00:54] Feast of King nebuchad has repeated
[1:00:56] again with drunken parties and
[1:00:58] half-dressed women calling themselves
[1:01:00] Christians when the writing was upon the
[1:01:02] wall oh god of Heaven notice this what
[1:01:05] brother Bram does In This Moment we've
[1:01:06] been preaching on Mercy notice how this
[1:01:09] Mercy is not a pushover this Mercy isn't
[1:01:11] oh forgive the Le to se sins they're
[1:01:13] blind he says let the people he's saying
[1:01:16] let them Shake themselves flee from the
[1:01:17] Wrath oh god of Heaven have mercy upon a
[1:01:21] sinful world and a sinful people Lord As
[1:01:24] We Are Tonight
[1:01:26] God I'm trying to stand he says ask for
[1:01:29] mercy so here a prophet is pleading for
[1:01:31] Mercy I'm trying to stand in the breach
[1:01:33] and ask for divine
[1:01:36] mercy that you will speak into this
[1:01:38] crowd tonight and call your bride to
[1:01:41] attention Lord to March not by the sign
[1:01:44] of any Creed but by the sound of the
[1:01:47] Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ oh
[1:01:50] Hallelujah that's what I want this is
[1:01:53] what I want I want God to speak and call
[1:01:56] to my attention the sound of the Gospel
[1:02:00] oh God speak into this congregation
[1:02:02] today and call to their attention call
[1:02:05] the bride to your
[1:02:07] attention glory and he says granted oh
[1:02:11] God let it be known this night that thou
[1:02:13] art God and thy word is truth while
[1:02:16] solemnly in the face of this people we
[1:02:19] call them to attention of Thy
[1:02:23] word he stood in the gap stood in the
[1:02:26] breach and he cried out for
[1:02:28] mercy and what did he point him to the
[1:02:32] word he says in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:02:35] I pray for them Lord they have seen you
[1:02:38] beyond any Shadow of Doubt move across
[1:02:39] their crowds and tell them what's in
[1:02:41] their heart and thou knowest Lord that
[1:02:43] right now what's going on thou knowest
[1:02:46] that to be truth oh God and I pray thee
[1:02:49] in Jesus name let the Holy Spirit
[1:02:52] intercede again Lord
[1:02:56] wow thank you Lord look at the time
[1:02:58] we're living in the wrath of God is upon
[1:03:01] the earth
[1:03:02] now we've emphasized a judgment
[1:03:06] time brother Ram saying kobot is written
[1:03:09] all over these denominations all over
[1:03:11] these churches all over the world the
[1:03:13] glory of the Lord has
[1:03:15] departed not because a physical artifact
[1:03:17] has been
[1:03:19] taken but because of the word has been
[1:03:22] rejected so what would bring the
[1:03:24] presence of God back the
[1:03:27] word what's going to bring us into
[1:03:29] contact relationship and fellowship with
[1:03:31] the word welcoming and receiving the
[1:03:33] word faith and belief in the word he's
[1:03:35] saying can you take every bit of it can
[1:03:37] you measure up to the qualifications can
[1:03:39] you uh look what it requires is it with
[1:03:42] the word of God is it with the word of
[1:03:43] God and he says let the Holy Spirit
[1:03:46] intercede again now there's the there's
[1:03:49] the a mercy right the intercession over
[1:03:51] their ignorance but it's like no have
[1:03:54] mercy lord they're ignorant they don't
[1:03:56] know Lord have mercy but he says and
[1:03:57] pull from this audience Lord those who
[1:03:59] are written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:04:01] granted oh God I pray with all my
[1:04:04] heart let the Holy Spirit pull out those
[1:04:08] pull out the bride call out the
[1:04:11] bride what are you being called
[1:04:14] to you're being invited into the very
[1:04:18] thing that made the house of the Lord
[1:04:21] what it
[1:04:22] was his
[1:04:24] presence and God in this hour has given
[1:04:27] us the gift of Christ's
[1:04:29] presence not
[1:04:31] tradition not ritual not
[1:04:35] Superstition this is the gift we come
[1:04:37] back to this is what we honor and
[1:04:40] reverence this is what means everything
[1:04:43] to us because when this goes his
[1:04:45] presence you say what's this what's this
[1:04:47] when when that goes all those that are
[1:04:50] in him will go with him and there's no
[1:04:54] hope left on Earth right as we bow our
[1:04:58] heads invite the musicians to come I
[1:05:00] want there to be a soul searching in
[1:05:03] this moment just take time to think in
[1:05:05] your
[1:05:06] heart about the things that God has done
[1:05:08] for
[1:05:09] you about the gift of God's
[1:05:15] presence how that God was making himself
[1:05:18] real in this day and age that we're
[1:05:19] living in
[1:05:23] now I maybe Lord when we on it in the
[1:05:26] next couple services but brother B says
[1:05:27] there's always a gift that declares
[1:05:29] God's
[1:05:30] presence I believe we've received one in
[1:05:32] this hour we've seen that gift what was
[1:05:34] he declaring to us Christ's
[1:05:39] presence help us to honor that help us
[1:05:41] to reverence that with our heads bowed
[1:05:43] if you could examine Yourself by the
[1:05:45] word today and you'd want to stand to
[1:05:46] your feet and say Lord I I've identified
[1:05:48] with something I stand as a a show of
[1:05:50] Faith to you asking for your help and
[1:05:52] your grace your forgiveness for Mercy
[1:05:55] you'd like like to stand in his presence
[1:05:56] so we could pray for you God bless each
[1:05:59] one of you as we bow our heads let's
[1:06:01] pray our gracious Heavenly
[1:06:04] Father during this season in this time
[1:06:08] it's called a holiday season Ule tide
[1:06:12] Nativity whether some would celebrate K
[1:06:14] Quanza or
[1:06:15] Hanukkah just about every religion and
[1:06:18] every people look to this time as some
[1:06:21] with some distinction
[1:06:23] and special time
[1:06:26] it's a great commercial time it's a
[1:06:28] great time of spending and giving and
[1:06:30] parties
[1:06:32] and
[1:06:36] drinking buying and selling so much
[1:06:40] going on at this
[1:06:42] time truly Lord it it all exists
[1:06:49] because the greater of society is a
[1:06:51] fixed a date to your Advent your coming
[1:06:55] and they placed it in December December
[1:06:58] 25th many millions Lord
[1:07:01] billions will claim that that's the
[1:07:04] day that Christ was
[1:07:09] born they'll preach about the gift
[1:07:12] they'll preach about
[1:07:14] presence some will actually honor it and
[1:07:17] be very focused they'll read through the
[1:07:18] Book of Luke and they'll do things
[1:07:21] that
[1:07:23] recognize at least what the intent is of
[1:07:26] this
[1:07:28] time and Lord as your Prophet said
[1:07:30] whether he was born December the spring
[1:07:33] or whatever it is it's a sacred time
[1:07:35] it's a special
[1:07:38] time because that was the
[1:07:40] time that Emmanuel
[1:07:45] came God With
[1:07:49] Us you didn't always desire just to
[1:07:52] dwell between two cherubs
[1:07:56] you didn't always want to be behind a
[1:07:58] veil of badger
[1:08:01] skin Lord it wasn't even that Temple as
[1:08:06] ornate as it was and as beautiful and
[1:08:08] Grand and pricey that's not where you
[1:08:11] found yourself at
[1:08:13] home but the Bible says a body thou Hast
[1:08:15] prepared
[1:08:17] me and in Christ you demonstrated and
[1:08:19] showed that that's where you find your
[1:08:23] rest that's where you're thrown is is
[1:08:26] that's what you've wanted all along is
[1:08:27] this Covenant relationship with your
[1:08:31] own and Lord I believe that the one
[1:08:33] thing that this bride should value more
[1:08:35] than anything is the word of God which
[1:08:37] declares you
[1:08:39] present makes yourself known to
[1:08:42] us Lord I desire with the remaining
[1:08:45] services that we would have this year to
[1:08:47] emphasize the beauty of your presence
[1:08:50] the gift of your
[1:08:52] presence the power and promise of it
[1:08:56] the ways that we grieve it the ways that
[1:09:00] we can welcome
[1:09:01] it oh Lord from this perspective that
[1:09:04] that's what made the house so wonderful
[1:09:08] and desirable as you were
[1:09:11] there and Lord I pray that we can also
[1:09:13] be in this end time as your Prophet was
[1:09:16] standing in the breach saying God have
[1:09:17] mercy as a bear of your presence may we
[1:09:19] too also be those that can create an
[1:09:23] atmosphere that bear your presence
[1:09:26] so father we dig deep we want to connect
[1:09:28] with it we want to identify with
[1:09:30] it we can't do it through tradition we
[1:09:32] can't do it through
[1:09:34] Superstition we do not want to make the
[1:09:36] same mistakes that hofn and pinhos did
[1:09:40] Lord where they were coaxed into
[1:09:43] tradition and Superstition thinking that
[1:09:45] the Box itself the coffin itself the
[1:09:48] chest the artifact of shum wood and gold
[1:09:52] would somehow bring victory without
[1:09:57] you lord you don't need a box you don't
[1:10:01] need a
[1:10:02] cathedral you just need a Heart full of
[1:10:04] Faith that's willing to seek you Lord I
[1:10:08] believe there's a reason why in the
[1:10:09] image of the tent Vision it's a great
[1:10:11] huge Cathedral and how big and great it
[1:10:14] was but where you wanted to meet was in
[1:10:16] a little wooden room amen it's a secret
[1:10:20] I'll meet you there there I'll commune
[1:10:22] with
[1:10:23] thee Lord may we find this secret place
[1:10:25] in the end time may we find this
[1:10:27] connection and fellowship with you
[1:10:28] because I believe we need it now more
[1:10:30] than ever that if we do not have this
[1:10:32] nourishment if we do not have this
[1:10:34] enrichment it's just a Razor's Edge
[1:10:36] before we find ourselves
[1:10:39] slipping angry upset frustrated lustful
[1:10:43] rationalizing making excuses falling
[1:10:46] back on negative habits and patterns oh
[1:10:48] God may it not be so let us hear the
[1:10:51] voice of the Prophet ring out let us
[1:10:53] also a a as family members and men and
[1:10:55] wherever we could be let us also be that
[1:10:57] voice crying out saying get into Christ
[1:11:00] come into Christ stay in
[1:11:02] Christ help us Lord to not be guilty of
[1:11:07] superstition when it comes to church
[1:11:09] when it comes to the message when it
[1:11:11] comes to the house of the Lord and I
[1:11:14] pray honor honor us with your presence
[1:11:18] let the shakan of Glory Be Welcome Lord
[1:11:21] in our hearts in our homes and in this
[1:11:23] church may we be a people as a local
[1:11:27] body but yet part of this greater body
[1:11:29] of Jesus Christ as individuals may we be
[1:11:31] a people that are conscious of your
[1:11:34] presence desirous of
[1:11:37] it and
[1:11:39] reflections of it bless your people I
[1:11:42] pray we commit everyone to you today now
[1:11:44] Lord be merciful to us oh God we receive
[1:11:47] this message of Mercy we receive this
[1:11:50] call to
[1:11:51] attention you have our attention Lord
[1:11:55] speak to us from between the cheram Lord
[1:11:59] let us hear your
[1:12:00] voice let us feel your shakina
[1:12:04] glory granted I pray in the name of the
[1:12:07] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:12:09] amen amen
