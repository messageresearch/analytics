[0:03] just like to
[0:05] say to each of you
[0:08] god bless you
[0:09] thank you for coming to the house of the
[0:11] lord this morning
[0:13] and i pray that together
[0:18] we'll just have such a wonderful time in
[0:20] the lord
[0:22] i believe
[0:24] brother chris said all i have to do is
[0:26] beat the previous
[0:28] speaker as concerning time
[0:31] and uh so i'm hoping that this sunday
[0:35] everybody will get out early
[0:40] y'all just pray for me
[0:44] um
[0:48] i do want to say that i really did enjoy
[0:51] wednesday night service brother chris
[0:53] i've been chewing on it since wednesday
[0:55] night
[0:56] and i didn't know if anybody else was
[0:58] and so when i came down yesterday
[1:01] the rubik's were kind enough to open
[1:03] their home
[1:04] to me and
[1:05] i uh
[1:07] immediately as soon as brother lucas
[1:10] said how much he enjoyed wednesday night
[1:12] my eyes lit up because i thought man
[1:15] praise the lord let's let's fellowship
[1:18] about this
[1:19] because i enjoyed it so much
[1:21] um i really i the x factor and and and
[1:25] the representation and i'd like to
[1:27] mention some of that here this morning i
[1:29] believe it was just uh the providence of
[1:31] the lord really uh was really wonderful
[1:35] so i hope that you take courage brother
[1:36] chris
[1:37] in in that knowing
[1:39] that i was feeding upon it
[1:41] so
[1:43] this morning
[1:45] for a title
[1:46] i would like to title this service a
[1:50] message for daughters
[1:52] and um now i i know that might make the
[1:57] men a little bit nervous
[1:59] and it might make
[2:01] families that don't have daughters a
[2:03] little bit nervous as well brother
[2:04] travis don't don't fret
[2:07] don't worry
[2:09] because
[2:11] i can i can virtually guarantee that
[2:13] everybody here
[2:15] either came from a daughter
[2:19] is a daughter
[2:21] is married to a daughter
[2:24] has sons
[2:26] who one day lord willing
[2:29] will marry a daughter
[2:32] and no doubt there's some young men here
[2:34] that are seeking a daughter
[2:36] somewhere
[2:38] and so if you feel like i don't know if
[2:40] this is going to be applicable to me i
[2:43] assure you it will
[2:46] and i took the same font i know those
[2:48] that would be streaming can't see this
[2:52] but i took the same font that brother
[2:54] aaron took a week ago
[2:57] from his service
[2:59] and his sermon motherhood
[3:02] back to the office and i took uh the
[3:05] same font for a reason
[3:08] i i
[3:10] as brother aaron was ministering about
[3:12] motherhood
[3:14] knowing that i had this thought on my
[3:16] mind already when he began going through
[3:18] his sermon and speaking beginning in
[3:20] genesis and talking about the man and
[3:23] the woman being created i thought oh no
[3:26] he's gonna he's just gonna run with my
[3:28] notes he's just gonna take it i'll have
[3:30] nothing to preach next week
[3:32] uh but thank the lord i believe that it
[3:34] ties together nicely so last week we
[3:37] were celebrating mothers
[3:39] this week we will celebrate daughters
[3:43] and uh
[3:45] so um
[3:47] as we look at the scripture oh we good
[3:49] i'm glad you took this up uh this
[3:51] actually came from brother
[3:53] brother aaron's sermon the hood part
[3:56] coming from motherhood and brother
[3:58] travis and i were speaking after the
[3:59] service last week and as brother aaron
[4:02] pulled this slide up and we thought
[4:03] interesting hood where is he going to go
[4:05] with this and it says a particular state
[4:08] or condition or a specific period
[4:10] in someone's life i thought oh my i'm
[4:13] glad he went that direction because in
[4:16] my mind
[4:17] if you're from the streets of compton
[4:21] or the streets of queens or flagstaff
[4:26] hood means something entirely different
[4:34] and so this being pastor the end of
[4:37] pastor depreciation week
[4:40] uh i thought well i might as well take
[4:42] his slide
[4:43] and uh
[4:45] and we're just gonna go ahead and
[4:46] re-preach brother aaron's sermon
[4:49] we're not gonna do that
[4:52] so i'd like to look back at zechariah
[4:55] chapter 9 and
[4:57] verse 9.
[4:59] the scripture says rejoice greatly
[5:02] o daughter of zion
[5:04] shout
[5:05] o daughter of jerusalem behold
[5:08] thy king cometh unto thee
[5:10] he is just and having salvation
[5:13] lowly and riding upon an ass and upon
[5:15] the cult
[5:16] the fall of an ass
[5:21] and as i
[5:22] as we look at this scripture and and
[5:25] hold in mind the the title a message for
[5:28] daughters
[5:31] i
[5:32] as i as this
[5:33] uh sermon was building in my mind
[5:36] i thought i i want to
[5:39] i want to present this
[5:41] as a father who has daughters
[5:45] um
[5:46] like it would be a message to my own
[5:48] daughters
[5:50] and the things that i would desire for
[5:53] my own daughters
[5:55] and i've got two beautiful young
[5:57] daughters um they're growing up so fast
[6:00] on me
[6:04] but i would i as i titled it a message
[6:08] for daughters i want you to know that
[6:10] this is not the message for daughters
[6:14] i am merely blowing the dust off of the
[6:17] top of this scratching the surface if
[6:20] you will
[6:21] this is not the the all-encompassing
[6:25] message for our daughters
[6:27] i believe
[6:28] uh i wish i had the gift that that uh or
[6:32] at least a part of the gift that brother
[6:33] aaron has where he does such a nice job
[6:37] of of taking us a thought and creating a
[6:41] series from that thought and i
[6:44] i i've never been able to do that i
[6:46] typically i just i just let it all out
[6:50] and uh and then and then you just let it
[6:52] all fall where it lays and and you pick
[6:54] up what you can
[6:56] but i think that you could
[6:58] uh
[6:59] i think throughout the scripture and
[7:00] through all the examples in the bible
[7:03] we could take service after service
[7:06] preaching a message for our for
[7:08] daughters
[7:10] and so just bear with me as we're only
[7:13] going to scratch the surface here
[7:16] and i pray that our daughters will
[7:19] thoroughly enjoy this
[7:21] and that the young men
[7:23] will also grab
[7:25] what i believe is your portion and i
[7:28] think there will be a lot more there for
[7:30] you than you think
[7:32] amen
[7:40] i'd like to
[7:42] visit
[7:43] the scripture in genesis
[7:45] chapter 1
[7:47] and
[7:52] it's in chapter 1 and verse 27 i believe
[7:54] brother aaron did a such a nice job of
[7:57] covering this
[7:58] but this time
[8:01] with a thought of daughters instead of
[8:03] motherhood in mind
[8:04] genesis chapter 1 verse 21 27 excuse me
[8:08] says so god created man in his own image
[8:12] in the image of god created he him
[8:15] male and female
[8:17] created he them
[8:19] and what we're seeing here is a picture
[8:23] of when god created man adam as as his
[8:28] brother aaron brought out i think so
[8:30] nicely it was creating mankind and that
[8:34] mankind
[8:35] encompassed both male and female and so
[8:38] when god created mankind
[8:41] what he created for himself was a son
[8:44] and a daughter
[8:45] he got both
[8:46] in a package
[8:48] and i think that that's such a a lovely
[8:51] picture because
[8:53] our sisters should not feel left out
[8:55] here you were a part of that creation
[8:59] and
[8:59] when we look in genesis chapter one and
[9:02] as you as as the scripture unfolds god
[9:05] uh god's creation he goes through each
[9:09] day and and through each day at the end
[9:11] of the first day in the second day and
[9:13] the third day in the fourth day all the
[9:15] way up to the sixth day you find
[9:17] the scripture declaring it was good
[9:21] and it was good
[9:23] and
[9:24] i believe that after he created uh man
[9:27] and and he saw that it was in his his
[9:29] image we find that god said it was very
[9:32] good he looked upon all of his creation
[9:35] now and he said it's very good
[9:38] and i believe we could say amen to that
[9:40] i i thoroughly enjoy what god has
[9:44] created for us here uh you know i love
[9:46] that brother branham says he's a god of
[9:48] variety he created the mountains and he
[9:50] created the deserts and he created the
[9:52] oceans and i'm so thankful for that i
[9:54] i'm so glad that we're not just uh all
[9:57] the same type of people some enjoy the
[9:59] mountains and some enjoy the deserts and
[10:02] some enjoy the the the beaches and the
[10:04] ocean
[10:05] uh i heard somebody say one time
[10:07] christians don't go to the beach
[10:10] they visit the ocean
[10:15] so if that makes you feel better right
[10:17] just tell people you're visiting the
[10:18] ocean
[10:20] but i'm so glad that there's such a
[10:22] variety in the body of christ
[10:25] but when we get to genesis chapter 2 and
[10:28] verse 18
[10:31] the scripture says and the lord god said
[10:33] it is not good that the man should be
[10:36] alone
[10:38] i will make him and help me
[10:40] for him
[10:46] and then we know that god puts asleep
[10:49] upon adam and from adam's rib he creates
[10:52] a woman
[10:53] and
[10:55] adam
[10:56] declares this is a woman for she's flesh
[10:59] of my flesh and she's born of my bone
[11:03] and
[11:06] this is now where we can see a
[11:09] distinction
[11:11] uh it's not the same being we now have
[11:13] two beings
[11:15] but remember that when god created a
[11:18] wife for adam
[11:20] he was creating a daughter for himself
[11:24] and so now we're going to look through
[11:26] the scripture
[11:27] and we're going to see that it is
[11:29] replete with examples for our daughters
[11:33] it speaks of daughters in so many
[11:35] different ways and and i just want to
[11:37] say this
[11:39] that
[11:40] uh
[11:42] when you have sons
[11:44] which i have sons as well and you ask
[11:46] your sons as parents son
[11:48] who's your favorite bible character
[11:52] uh just who's your favorite your your
[11:55] typical answers are going to be david
[11:58] sampson
[12:00] moses
[12:02] jesus
[12:03] these are your typical answers for sons
[12:06] anybody that's killing philistines the
[12:08] boys like that guy
[12:11] shamgar may be another one
[12:14] but when you have daughters and you say
[12:16] who's your favorite character in the
[12:18] bible
[12:20] typically your answers are going to be
[12:22] esther
[12:24] ruth
[12:26] mary
[12:28] sarah
[12:29] rebecca
[12:31] rachel and we feel so sorry for leah
[12:37] and these are your typical answers this
[12:39] is what you're going through in your
[12:40] home when you're speaking with your
[12:42] daughters and and you're teaching them
[12:44] in uh their sunday school lessons you
[12:47] ask them who's your favorite characters
[12:50] those are your typical answers
[12:52] and so
[12:54] i think if we
[12:56] i don't i think they were put in the
[12:58] bible for a reason for an example and i
[13:00] think we all believe that we could all
[13:02] say sure amen to that
[13:08] and i want to take some time and i i
[13:10] want to
[13:12] uh
[13:13] i want to go through some of these
[13:15] examples
[13:17] but before we do
[13:18] uh i'm as i'm going back and i'm looking
[13:21] at these scriptures in genesis chapter
[13:23] one and genesis chapter two
[13:26] there's a a quote
[13:28] that's from the smyrnian church age i
[13:30] believe
[13:32] and i don't know brothers you if you
[13:34] have that
[13:36] brother branham says this the heart
[13:38] purpose and i would encourage you go and
[13:41] get your church age book and open this
[13:42] up because it's there's we only grabbed
[13:44] a snippet of this quote such a fantastic
[13:47] quote
[13:49] brother branham says the heart purpose
[13:52] the eternal purpose of god
[13:56] was to take a bride
[13:58] of his own choosing
[14:00] and that purpose
[14:02] was in himself
[14:04] and being eternal was decreed before the
[14:09] foundation of the world
[14:12] and so this thought of
[14:16] of having a daughter
[14:20] god
[14:22] in his in the mind of god
[14:24] eons back before the foundation of the
[14:28] world
[14:29] god desired to have daughters
[14:31] and we know that
[14:33] that daughter that he created being a
[14:36] bride for adam
[14:38] then we can we can recognize when we
[14:41] look through scripture
[14:42] that the daughters that we read about in
[14:44] scripture
[14:46] are a type of a bride for
[14:50] jesus christ
[14:53] that when we
[14:54] are talking about a message for
[14:56] daughters we're not simply speaking
[14:59] only to the the females that would go to
[15:03] church
[15:04] but we recognize that a woman in the
[15:07] bible
[15:08] always is a type of the church
[15:11] good or bad a woman always types a
[15:14] church
[15:16] and so
[15:17] uh i really appreciated brother chris on
[15:20] wednesday night uh going into this the
[15:24] the story of those uh those uh not
[15:27] non-astronauts uh normal civilians who
[15:30] were able to take a ride on that rocket
[15:32] ship and one of those people being that
[15:35] young woman that had no shot ever before
[15:39] of being able to go into space because
[15:41] of the circumstances in her life but
[15:43] because she had representation
[15:45] she was able to do something that that
[15:48] most civilians would never be able to do
[15:51] and it was because of that
[15:52] representation and and so we're now
[15:55] seeing by looking into this quote that
[15:58] there was representation for you before
[16:01] the foundation of the world
[16:04] there was representation of all the
[16:06] daughters that that that are hearing the
[16:09] word of god there's representation of
[16:12] you and that representation was there
[16:14] before the foundation of the world
[16:18] oh my
[16:27] now being a father of daughters
[16:30] i'll i'm going to relay to you a
[16:32] personal story
[16:34] um when i was
[16:37] hunting
[16:38] for a wife
[16:42] and
[16:44] i
[16:45] i
[16:46] discovered sister
[16:48] grace um
[16:53] thank the lord i didn't they were from
[16:55] the east coast and i was from the west
[16:57] coast and
[16:59] we didn't know each other that well and
[17:00] it was a good thing because they'd have
[17:02] probably never allowed me to come
[17:05] into their home
[17:06] um
[17:08] her being the daughter of a of a pastor
[17:11] uh and and and quite a character
[17:14] um i'm glad that that that god ordained
[17:16] the circumstances the way he did
[17:19] but when i was
[17:22] looking to marry
[17:23] this young lady this daughter of a
[17:25] pastor
[17:28] the lord
[17:29] sister grayson i love when we have
[17:31] people in our home
[17:33] especially couples we want to know their
[17:35] story we want to know how they were
[17:37] married how they how they met each other
[17:39] and and how that everything transpired
[17:41] for them to end up married to each other
[17:43] how did it take place we want to know
[17:45] the story and usually when we draw the
[17:47] story out from everybody then the
[17:50] response is well what's your story
[17:52] and
[17:53] sister grace and i feel that that that
[17:56] the hand of the lord was in our entire
[17:57] relationship and i'm sure all you
[17:59] husbands and wives feel that way and and
[18:02] just to see the hand of god working
[18:04] every circumstance to where uh the two
[18:07] of us could could not only uh be in
[18:09] union together but serve the lord
[18:11] together
[18:13] and have the same desire to serve uh the
[18:16] lord together
[18:18] but i remember we would be praying and
[18:20] asking the lord uh you know are we meant
[18:23] to be are we meant to be married
[18:25] together uh can you lord show us a sign
[18:28] if you would do that and perhaps we were
[18:30] like the greeks uh searching for signs
[18:33] and things
[18:35] maybe it's just young love i don't know
[18:37] but it was everything we could do was we
[18:39] just need to know are we meant to be
[18:42] together or not
[18:44] and when we felt that the lord had
[18:46] confirmed that to us
[18:48] over and over and over i remember
[18:51] thinking now why
[18:55] why doesn't her dad catch it
[18:59] uh i i'm so confused
[19:04] why would this man not just hand his
[19:06] daughter right over to me and and and
[19:09] and the thought process i believe for
[19:11] every young man who who has grown up
[19:14] listening to the message of the hour
[19:16] is that you're gonna walk up to her dad
[19:18] and he's gonna say you can have her bill
[19:24] and i was really i was really
[19:25] anticipating that's how it was going to
[19:28] go
[19:29] and uh it was so contrary to that
[19:32] but i couldn't understand that i thought
[19:35] now why would any man not want his
[19:38] daughter
[19:39] to marry me i'm such a fine young
[19:41] upstanding
[19:46] i guess 22 years old 23 you don't have
[19:48] it all together
[19:50] really and i just
[19:53] uh
[19:54] especially being long distance you have
[19:56] to understand we were we were only
[19:58] allowed to to speak to each other for 30
[20:00] minutes once a week
[20:02] um which everybody's like wow but we
[20:04] wrote a lot of letters and
[20:06] and and we were just pecking at email at
[20:08] that time
[20:10] but i i thought you know i don't
[20:12] understand how how he can't
[20:15] why he wouldn't just hand his daughter
[20:16] over
[20:18] and then
[20:20] our daughter was born our first daughter
[20:25] and the moment that i held her in my
[20:27] hands
[20:29] i understood perfectly
[20:33] how he felt
[20:36] and i
[20:37] i remember
[20:38] several years ago
[20:41] we were in town doing some shopping and
[20:43] i
[20:44] i thought you know
[20:46] i don't know if i thoroughly thanked her
[20:48] parents for handing their daughter over
[20:50] to me eventually and so i just had to
[20:53] call them and say hey thank you
[20:56] um
[20:58] because now that i have daughters i
[21:00] understand what that means to have a
[21:03] daughter
[21:04] and i have a scripture it's it's in ruth
[21:06] chapter 4
[21:08] verse 15 it's the second half
[21:10] but it says
[21:11] uh it's speaking these are
[21:14] the the women speaking to naomi for thy
[21:17] daughter-in-law
[21:19] speaking of ruth which loveth thee
[21:21] which is better to thee than seven sons
[21:26] have borne him
[21:29] and
[21:30] i'll be honest with you when uh
[21:33] sister grace and i were expecting our
[21:35] first child i knew it was a son i knew
[21:38] that was the only thing that you could
[21:39] have was sons
[21:41] and so
[21:42] i uh it came that that that that time i
[21:46] think it was uh about 20 weeks of
[21:48] pregnancy where you get to find out what
[21:50] you're going to have
[21:52] and they said it was a human being which
[21:55] was a good thing
[21:57] but when when the doctor
[22:00] announced to us congratulations you're
[22:02] going to have a daughter
[22:08] i think sister grace was a little
[22:10] disappointed in my reaction
[22:12] which wasn't a bad reaction it just
[22:14] wasn't a reaction at all
[22:18] because i didn't i didn't i i just
[22:20] couldn't i never in my mind
[22:22] put what how what
[22:24] what do you do with it i can't have a
[22:25] daughter
[22:26] what do you do with daughters
[22:29] i can't play catch with a daughter can i
[22:34] and i couldn't understand that
[22:37] and i was taken back
[22:39] but i tell you
[22:41] that first moment
[22:43] that i held her after she was born
[22:46] this is exactly how i felt
[22:49] she that a daughter when she is born
[22:53] they have this
[22:55] this amazing
[22:56] invisible lasso that wraps around the
[22:59] heart of a father
[23:02] and you feel like i wouldn't take 12
[23:05] sons
[23:06] for one of these
[23:08] and they become daddy's girls
[23:11] and you're just proud as a peacock
[23:18] and i'm so glad that
[23:20] before the foundation of the world god
[23:23] had in his mind
[23:26] daughters along with sons
[23:28] and that when he made man
[23:31] he made him male and female he had his
[23:33] son and his daughter and when he
[23:36] separated them
[23:37] he still had him a daughter
[23:40] and not only was that a daughter but
[23:42] that daughter was going to be the bride
[23:45] for his son
[23:47] and the representation
[23:49] of of creating a woman
[23:51] in in in the mind of god being a type
[23:55] of a pure
[23:56] and spotless
[23:58] virtuous bride for jesus christ
[24:02] it's so precious
[24:04] it's so clean
[24:10] and so as i as we now take a little bit
[24:14] of a journey through some of the
[24:15] examples
[24:19] that are in the bible
[24:28] we we i'd like to start with
[24:31] ruth and rebecca
[24:33] and
[24:34] there's so many things that happen in in
[24:37] ruth's life and brother branham has a
[24:39] whole sermon the kinsmen redeemer
[24:41] and it's just it it just takes you all
[24:44] the way through the book of ruth and you
[24:46] can see perfectly
[24:48] uh the bride
[24:50] represented in ruth and and boaz being
[24:54] being christ
[24:57] but something that um
[25:00] that comes from the kinsmen redeemer
[25:04] uh that i that represented and i'm so
[25:07] glad i saw this because i was gonna grab
[25:09] it
[25:10] another one for rebecca because brother
[25:12] branham
[25:13] he he uses this more than one time but
[25:16] he says here
[25:18] well lord
[25:19] and he's he's quoting as if this is what
[25:22] we would say to him
[25:24] well lord if you'll just bless me and do
[25:27] this for me i'll do so and so
[25:31] brother branham says that's not a
[25:33] decision
[25:36] god
[25:37] i don't care what you do with me
[25:40] i'll go anyhow
[25:45] if i die
[25:46] all right
[25:48] live or die whatever if they laugh at me
[25:50] make fun of me don't make any difference
[25:54] i'll go anyhow that's clean-cut decision
[25:59] like rebecca made for she even seen
[26:02] isaac
[26:04] her parents said
[26:06] let her let the girl answer
[26:08] the girl she's of age
[26:10] let her answer
[26:12] she said i'll go
[26:15] clean cut decision quickly made she
[26:18] claimed to it that's what ruth did
[26:23] orpah went back
[26:24] they journeyed on ruth in her heart not
[26:28] knowing where she was going but a type
[26:31] of the church
[26:33] we sojourn like abraham
[26:36] pilgrims in a strange land
[26:39] among
[26:40] strange people
[26:43] and i would say this i i grabbed this
[26:45] for an example when we look at the story
[26:47] of ruth when we look at the story of
[26:49] rebecca and we see this clean cut
[26:52] decision
[26:54] and and and that clean cut decision for
[26:56] rebecca was will you marry this man
[26:59] isaac that you've heard so much about
[27:02] but you've never seen him
[27:04] she was so confident in what the
[27:07] messenger had told her about isaac that
[27:10] she was willing to make a clean-cut
[27:13] decision i'll go
[27:15] and and that being a representation of
[27:19] the church of each and every individual
[27:22] that comes to the decision to live for
[27:25] jesus christ
[27:27] to say
[27:28] i desire
[27:30] to know the love of god i desire to have
[27:34] uh his spirit residing in me because i
[27:37] can't do this by myself
[27:41] and that is a decision that every
[27:43] believer has got to come up against will
[27:46] you go will you serve will you love
[27:51] will you
[27:52] for him and our decision
[27:55] uh and brother branham just gives so
[27:57] much uh uh
[28:00] uh a
[28:01] commendation to
[28:04] to rebecca and to ruth for making a
[28:06] decision so clean cut
[28:09] not just wishy-washy well i'll go ah you
[28:11] know i'm uncomfortable let's go back
[28:13] well okay no i think i'll go nah not
[28:15] this week i don't feel good no it was a
[28:18] final decision made i'll go
[28:21] and when we look at the story of ruth
[28:24] and how that she
[28:25] told uh uh her mother-in-law naomi let
[28:29] your people be my people let your god be
[28:33] my god where you live i'll live where
[28:36] you die i'll die there but please don't
[28:39] separate
[28:40] us
[28:41] let death come before i'm separated from
[28:44] a decision like this and oh my believers
[28:48] listen when we were were
[28:51] were
[28:52] granted the grace of god to hear the
[28:55] word of god
[28:56] and and discover that this great god
[29:01] who is he this jehovah god this spirit
[29:04] that i cannot see when we discovered who
[29:07] he was
[29:09] his name is
[29:10] jesus that god came and he made himself
[29:14] flesh he made himself visible so that we
[29:17] could have an idea of who god is
[29:21] something in our heart said i'll go
[29:24] i want that
[29:35] brother chris wednesday night
[29:38] brought out that woman at the well
[29:42] and
[29:43] i think brother branham
[29:46] uses the example of the woman at the
[29:48] well probably more than any other
[29:50] example
[29:52] throughout the bible
[29:54] because
[29:57] because of the circumstance that she was
[29:59] in
[30:00] for one
[30:02] for two the gift that was demonstrated
[30:05] there at the well
[30:06] was now made evident again in our day
[30:10] which caused us to say that comes from
[30:13] the bible i can see that in the bible
[30:15] and it gives us confidence and it gives
[30:17] us faith that the same god that would
[30:20] meet a woman at the well who was in a
[30:23] terrible situation that same god is
[30:26] still here today and that he can speak
[30:28] to our hearts as he did that woman's
[30:30] heart
[30:32] but also i think again as was so aptly
[30:36] spoken wednesday night the
[30:38] representation that was in that woman to
[30:41] be able to say
[30:43] this is the messiah
[30:45] this is
[30:47] this man who told me all things is not
[30:50] this the very messiah and she ran and
[30:52] told all the people
[30:54] i have seen
[30:56] the sign of the messiah in our day
[30:59] he's here he's come and see him and her
[31:02] by her testimony
[31:04] it brought the men from the city and all
[31:07] of these men had to come and see for
[31:09] themselves to believe that this this too
[31:13] they could believe was the messiah that
[31:15] god was on earth
[31:20] and that representation i think is is so
[31:23] wonderful and i i think of the woman at
[31:25] the well i think of of mary magdalene
[31:27] another uh beautiful example of a woman
[31:30] who seemed like her life was tarnished
[31:32] her life was finished there was as far
[31:35] as uh having um as as job said is there
[31:40] not a god is there not a days man who
[31:42] can who can span a holy god and a sinful
[31:46] man where is this man and then job
[31:49] caught the revelation and he saw my
[31:52] redeemer liveth
[31:54] and and and for a woman like mary
[31:57] magdalene for a woman like this woman at
[31:59] the well this samaritan
[32:02] when they could discover that there was
[32:05] a daze man there was somebody who could
[32:07] touch a holy god and and wrap their arm
[32:11] around a sinful person and and and bring
[32:14] them together and and take all of the
[32:16] uncleanness away and invite them to the
[32:19] highest place
[32:21] to become a daughter of god to become
[32:25] a the bride of jesus christ
[32:29] there's nothing greater in this world
[32:33] had jesus said look the best i can give
[32:36] you is money it's it wouldn't have been
[32:38] what she wanted it wouldn't have filled
[32:40] the spot
[32:50] brother lucas and i as we were going
[32:52] through this
[32:54] and creating these slides and
[32:56] looking through these notes there was
[32:58] something that we
[32:59] we agreed was the
[33:02] central theme
[33:04] of this sermon and that was
[33:07] if we can
[33:10] we as the church we as the bride
[33:13] we as daughters of god
[33:16] uh
[33:17] the daughters of zion if you will if
[33:19] that makes you men feel better so that
[33:21] i'm not calling you daughters of god but
[33:24] daughters of zion
[33:25] if we can properly identify
[33:28] the bride groom excuse me if we can
[33:31] properly identify the bridegroom
[33:34] throughout the scripture
[33:36] and we can properly put him in the place
[33:39] that he that he so deserves
[33:42] and that he he just holds
[33:45] then we
[33:46] can then properly identify the bride
[33:50] and see her in her place
[33:57] and i told this to brother lucas
[34:00] this is a feeling that i would have for
[34:02] my daughters
[34:04] like this woman at the well
[34:07] or mary magdalene shame
[34:09] filled their lives
[34:13] and that's evident in their conversation
[34:16] and it's evident in
[34:18] like that woman who had to come to the
[34:20] well at a separate time of day
[34:23] that other women would not come with her
[34:26] because of who she was
[34:30] this feeling of
[34:32] shame and as we were looking back in at
[34:35] the genesis account
[34:37] of the woman and when adam and eve when
[34:40] their eyes were opened
[34:42] their eyes were opened to a realization
[34:45] that brought them to shame
[34:48] that brought shame in their life
[34:52] and again if i was thinking of
[34:54] expressing this to my daughters
[35:00] i want i would want them to know make no
[35:03] mistake about it
[35:05] when you read in hebrews chapter 11
[35:08] about moses and it says that moses
[35:11] esteemed the reproach for christ
[35:14] greater riches than that of egypt
[35:18] there is a reproach for christ
[35:22] as as we read in that quote
[35:25] that the thought behind
[35:27] uh
[35:30] ruth or rebecca
[35:33] was god i don't care what you do with me
[35:36] live or die whatever if they laugh at me
[35:39] or make fun of me it doesn't make any
[35:41] difference i'll go anyhow
[35:45] and history has demonstrated how that
[35:48] the believer that would follow christ
[35:52] there's a reproach that comes along with
[35:54] that decision
[35:56] but that reproach should never be
[35:59] mistaken for shame
[36:02] that is
[36:04] certainly two separate things and
[36:07] there's a huge chasm between both of
[36:09] those
[36:10] a reproach for christ
[36:13] is as i believe one place brother
[36:16] branham speaks about a woman's long hair
[36:20] is her cr is a crown of thorns
[36:23] is likened unto a crown of thorns
[36:28] and it's a reproach it's it's
[36:30] identifying yourself with christ
[36:34] in his suffering
[36:36] it's being identified with christ where
[36:40] shame comes in
[36:42] is a separation
[36:44] between you and christ it's a devil's
[36:49] attempt at driving a wedge between our
[36:53] lives and christ
[36:55] and and and god doesn't desire that we
[36:59] would have shame in our life
[37:02] and not to equate that with the reproach
[37:05] for christ
[37:06] and i would never
[37:08] want my daughters to ever feel
[37:12] that living for christ is a shameful
[37:15] thing because it's the most glorious
[37:17] thing that there is is to live for god
[37:21] to be called a daughter of god
[37:28] and as we look at
[37:31] these characters in the bible
[37:33] i wanted to not only just have in mind
[37:36] the esther's and the ruths and the
[37:38] rebeccas and and mary's
[37:41] but there's also
[37:44] there's also examples in the bible
[37:47] of
[37:48] of daughters that we would
[37:51] want our children to and our daughters
[37:54] to never be like
[37:59] and
[38:00] the examples that i could off the top of
[38:02] my head come come up with was
[38:04] immediately jezebel
[38:07] and her daughter athaliah
[38:10] we know that when jezebel married
[38:13] ahab who was king of israel
[38:17] it was a political move it was an
[38:19] attempt to to unite uh
[38:22] uh nations together
[38:25] it certainly was not based upon
[38:28] religious belief or or uh uh
[38:32] to to uh edify
[38:35] what israel
[38:37] knew to be the one true god
[38:40] and we realized that when
[38:43] ahab married jezebel it brought idolatry
[38:46] to those 10 tribes of israel
[38:48] but the two tribes of judah remained
[38:50] clean as they had jehoshaphat as king
[38:54] but jehoshaphat had a son as well
[38:57] and his son
[38:59] because of the way that kings would
[39:01] marry
[39:02] into each other's families to strengthen
[39:04] bonds and to strengthen nations we find
[39:07] that jehoshaphat's son jehoram married
[39:10] ahab and jezebel's daughter and that was
[39:14] ethelia
[39:15] and as soon as he married her
[39:18] we now see idolatry
[39:20] filling up even those two tribes of
[39:22] judah so now idolatry is throughout all
[39:27] israel and when we look at that example
[39:29] brother branham does such a nice job in
[39:31] the church age book of demonstrating who
[39:34] this woman is and who these daughters
[39:36] are
[39:37] we say
[39:39] god
[39:40] don't let my daughters be like that
[39:44] don't don't let me uh bring up my my
[39:47] daughters to
[39:49] uh
[39:50] to pattern after that
[39:53] i i thought of herodias
[39:56] and her daughter and how that it was her
[39:58] daughter that that danced for the king
[40:04] that caused john the baptist's head to
[40:07] be
[40:09] this is a a a girl
[40:12] who
[40:13] when we see her actions
[40:17] and how that she was merely
[40:21] feeding to a man's desires and to his
[40:24] carnal
[40:25] desires
[40:26] then within the evil that it brought
[40:30] we we
[40:31] it causes us to say oh daughters be
[40:34] careful
[40:35] what you do
[40:36] be careful how you act
[40:39] and
[40:40] and i think of my own daughters and
[40:43] and i and i
[40:46] it would be very easy for me to take
[40:48] them through the scripture and say let's
[40:50] take it let's take a look
[40:52] at how these
[40:54] how these daughters acted
[40:56] and see what the results it brought
[41:02] we see this in revelations chapter 17
[41:05] mystery babylon
[41:07] the great and the bible says and
[41:10] her daughters were harlots she was the
[41:13] mother of harlots
[41:15] and so what we're seeing is a mother
[41:17] acting a certain way
[41:19] and the daughter falling right in line
[41:22] and doing the very same thing
[41:26] and these are such good examples for us
[41:29] to
[41:31] to keep as as believers in our homes in
[41:34] our arsenal uh in our script bag as
[41:37] david would have
[41:38] full of stones to be able to share with
[41:41] our daughters examples to say don't
[41:44] pattern your life like that don't do
[41:47] that and when the questions come up why
[41:50] mom why dad how come this girl can do
[41:54] this how come this one does this we can
[41:56] say let us look at history let us look
[42:00] at the example that's been set before us
[42:03] and show you what it leads to
[42:13] the flip side
[42:15] of those daughters
[42:18] in my mind
[42:20] is the story of esther
[42:24] and i think that esther demonstrates
[42:28] a word
[42:32] that i think we
[42:34] we use
[42:35] to mean
[42:36] something
[42:38] and that word is holiness
[42:42] and when when
[42:45] you hear the word holiness
[42:47] uh
[42:48] that could be
[42:49] you could use that word around uh
[42:52] other uh message believing churches you
[42:54] could use that word in some baptist
[42:57] churches you could use that in some
[42:59] pentecostal churches
[43:01] and
[43:02] the general idea that's going to come
[43:04] from that is dress
[43:06] is the way
[43:08] a man or a woman would dress
[43:11] but we
[43:14] as students of the word of god and
[43:17] and and and hearing the message of the
[43:20] hour realize that holiness is more than
[43:23] a dress
[43:24] holiness is a way of life
[43:26] that holiness the word itself comes from
[43:29] the word sanctification
[43:31] which is to be set aside and used for
[43:35] service
[43:37] and when we look at holiness
[43:42] i want to i want to look at
[43:45] a couple scriptures one in his is in
[43:47] isaiah chapter 3
[43:51] and i'm hoping these
[43:53] brothers will have it good wonderful
[43:56] isaiah chapter 3 and verse 16 says
[43:58] moreover the lord saith because the
[44:01] daughters of zion are haughty
[44:04] and walk with stretched forth necks and
[44:08] wanton eyes
[44:10] walking and mincing as they go
[44:13] and making a tinkling with their feet
[44:17] it gives us an image
[44:19] that is so contrary to holiness
[44:23] it it lets us know that
[44:25] their neck is stretched forth and
[44:27] they're haughty they're they're not
[44:30] walking in a humility there's no
[44:32] humility here that this is haughtiness
[44:35] that this is arrogance that that is
[44:37] walking forth and when we see this
[44:39] mincing
[44:41] immediately i if if you've again
[44:43] listened to the message of the hour long
[44:46] enough you find that brother branham
[44:47] speaking
[44:48] about a dream that i believe him or his
[44:50] mother had about a woman who was walking
[44:53] up a cliff
[44:54] and and as she walked up this pathway
[44:57] that the the path got narrower and
[45:00] narrower and narrower and she was
[45:02] wearing high heels and brother branham
[45:05] begins to talk about how that those high
[45:07] heels cause mincing and and that mincing
[45:10] caused her to lose her balance and fall
[45:13] off a cliff and fall into hell
[45:16] and so when you get imagery like that
[45:19] immediately as a father with daughters
[45:21] you're thinking oh god
[45:23] please keep my children on a path that
[45:27] god is safe
[45:29] caused them to walk not in haughtiness
[45:32] not with arrogance and not in a way that
[45:35] would be displeasing to the lord and and
[45:38] lord when you can put your humility as
[45:41] we read in in zechariah 9 9 that thy
[45:44] king cometh lowly meek writing upon the
[45:48] fall of an ass with humility and we see
[45:51] the contrast that our lord gives with
[45:54] this scripture of haughtiness
[45:56] it causes me as a father to say oh god
[46:00] let the humility that was in christ be
[46:03] in my daughters and god not only in my
[46:06] daughters but let it be represented in
[46:08] me first
[46:10] that god if if if if the if the
[46:13] daughters of zion is a representation of
[46:16] the bride of jesus christ god don't let
[46:19] me be haughty don't let me mince around
[46:22] in a way that would that would be
[46:24] displeasing to you or that would catch
[46:26] even the attraction of the enemy
[46:34] and i believe that if the humility of
[46:37] christ if the love of christ if the
[46:39] lowliness
[46:40] of of jesus christ would be in the heart
[46:43] of any man or any woman
[46:47] the clothing part will take care for
[46:49] itself
[46:53] it's not then it's not
[46:55] a difficult thing it's it's it's not a a
[46:58] a heavy burden to bear
[47:01] but it's it's a liberty
[47:03] it's a freedom in christ
[47:08] in second corinthians chapter 6
[47:11] verses 16 through 18
[47:13] the scripture says
[47:15] and what agreement
[47:17] hath the temple of god with idols
[47:20] for ye are the temple of the living god
[47:23] as god hath said i will dwell in them
[47:27] and walk in them
[47:28] and i will be their god and they shall
[47:31] be my people
[47:33] wherefore
[47:35] come out from among them and be ye
[47:38] separate
[47:39] saith the lord that's speaking of
[47:41] holiness
[47:44] and touch not the unclean thing
[47:47] and i will receive you
[47:52] and will be a father unto you and ye
[47:54] shall be my sons and daughters saith the
[47:58] lord almighty once again
[48:01] we see
[48:02] god bringing in his daughters
[48:04] into this as paul is speaking
[48:07] that not only
[48:09] will you be my sons but i'll have sons
[48:12] and daughters and i'll live in them and
[48:14] i'll walk in them
[48:16] but come out
[48:18] that was the cry for our age come out
[48:21] from among them be ye separate from the
[48:24] things of the world be ye separate from
[48:26] the norm of religion be separate from
[48:29] just a mental uh theology or or or just
[48:33] a show um or or or or creeds and dogmas
[48:38] come out from that be separate from that
[48:42] let me live in you let me walk in you
[48:51] i am doing well i'm doing really well
[48:54] praise the lord
[48:59] i'm coming to a close believe it or not
[49:03] well we all know what that means
[49:07] that that's been abused so many times
[49:09] that and i've i'm guilty right here
[49:13] myself
[49:14] but
[49:16] i want to close
[49:21] with this idea
[49:27] that i want
[49:28] there to be a practical
[49:30] use
[49:32] a practical purpose
[49:35] for both my daughters and for the church
[49:38] for the bride of jesus christ
[49:41] when we
[49:42] when we talk about these things
[49:45] sometimes it comes out
[49:47] from the pulpit so nicely it it it
[49:50] sounds so wonderful and we think
[49:52] that's right brother that's right
[49:54] but then we've got to make that rubber
[49:57] meet the road
[49:59] and
[50:00] so many times we think man i felt so
[50:02] good about that on sunday
[50:05] but you know by thursday afternoon
[50:09] i don't know i
[50:14] my desire for my own children for for my
[50:17] daughters
[50:20] would be that there would be a practical
[50:21] purpose
[50:22] for the word of god in their life
[50:32] when i read my bible
[50:35] when we do
[50:36] when i'm alone
[50:38] and i'm having my devotions with the
[50:40] lord and
[50:43] you just get into the word of god and
[50:47] you begin to read
[50:51] and as you begin to study with a desire
[50:53] in your heart to know him in a greater
[50:56] way
[50:58] when his spirit comes by it's so sweet
[51:04] i think i just don't think there's
[51:05] anything that could take the place of of
[51:08] a family
[51:09] family devotions
[51:11] there's such an intimacy there's such a
[51:13] freedom to be able to just talk about
[51:15] the things of god
[51:17] to be able to get into a scripture and
[51:19] say does everybody understand what we
[51:21] just read there
[51:24] and you can take time and and
[51:28] you know usually my children
[51:32] i think they roll their eyes a lot if
[51:33] dad's going to take some time
[51:36] expounding on the scripture
[51:38] maybe because they get they hear me so
[51:40] much when i'm preaching but
[51:47] when they when when your children begin
[51:49] to open up
[51:53] when your children
[51:55] when you can see
[51:57] that the lord is dealing with their
[51:59] heart
[52:04] or you're listening to a you're
[52:06] listening to a tape you're listening to
[52:08] a message
[52:09] maybe the discernment line
[52:11] starts at the end of the service and
[52:18] you maybe have listened to that tape
[52:21] a dozen times
[52:24] but there's something about
[52:26] when your heart
[52:29] you being
[52:30] needy from god you needing the spirit of
[52:34] god to feed you
[52:35] when god begins
[52:37] when you can hear on tape
[52:39] god dealing with the lives of men and
[52:41] women who are in such dire straits
[52:43] they're in such
[52:45] a bad condition
[52:48] when you can hear somebody that's got a
[52:51] tumor when you can hear somebody
[52:53] who uh is is in a wheelchair
[52:56] and you hear them released from that and
[52:59] you hear them come
[53:00] you know the the the reaction from from
[53:03] the congregation when somebody gets up
[53:06] out of a wheelchair or off of a cart
[53:08] it stirs your heart in such a way as if
[53:12] it was you
[53:13] or as if it was your own family member
[53:16] that just got up out of that wheelchair
[53:18] or off that cart and you begin to
[53:20] rejoice in your heart that jesus christ
[53:24] is still touching lives that jesus
[53:27] christ still heals the sick
[53:32] and it's so pure and it's so clean
[53:36] that you just you want to you want to
[53:38] encapsulate that moment that you're
[53:40] listening to it and you want it to be
[53:43] that way all the time you want it to be
[53:45] that way in your life uh you want it to
[53:48] be that way i know for for for me
[53:50] for for us men we'd like to bring that
[53:53] atmosphere into the work we'd love for
[53:56] our
[53:57] our co-workers to feel just one time the
[54:01] presence of god move down and do
[54:04] something in their heart and you think
[54:06] oh god as men we think god let me do
[54:09] that well as fathers we feel that way
[54:12] too for our children and and and and you
[54:15] mothers for your babies
[54:17] you you you desire
[54:19] that when god stirred your heart with
[54:21] the message that your children are
[54:23] getting that same feedback that they're
[54:26] they're feeling that same relationship
[54:29] with jesus christ
[54:31] and when it becomes practical
[54:37] and thank the lord
[54:39] that it can become practical in a church
[54:41] service
[54:43] it can become real in a church service
[54:47] now i have to admit
[54:50] it's probably become more real to me in
[54:52] my truck
[54:54] it's become more real to me uh when i'm
[54:57] i'm
[54:58] you know at home when i'm pulling weeds
[55:00] out of my garden and i'm listening to
[55:02] the to a message and i'm hearing the
[55:06] moving of the spirit of god
[55:08] i just think oh my this is so wonderful
[55:11] we could just i feel like you know peter
[55:13] lord let us build three tabernacles
[55:15] right here
[55:17] why can't we just have church in my
[55:20] backyard and we all come pull my weeds
[55:23] out of my garden and you get to feel the
[55:24] same thing our desire is that everybody
[55:27] will feel that same thing
[55:30] it's our desire for that's my desire for
[55:33] my daughters
[55:36] is that when
[55:38] when brother chris you're preaching
[55:40] about representation that representation
[55:43] that was in that girl
[55:45] and you begin talking about that girl
[55:47] there was no way she was going to make
[55:48] it on a rocket she had metal legs and
[55:51] i should say metal in her legs but she
[55:54] had cancer and and she would had
[55:56] sickness and she had things in her body
[55:57] that she'd never been able to become an
[56:00] astronaut but because of the
[56:01] representation
[56:03] she was able to do something
[56:05] that that that even
[56:08] the fittest of athletes weren't invited
[56:11] to
[56:12] they just were not
[56:14] invited and and when you begin to hear
[56:17] that in a sermon your
[56:19] your as a parent my heart for my
[56:22] children for my daughters is oh daughter
[56:25] catch it
[56:26] catch that
[56:28] you've got representation
[56:30] if you can recognize that if you can
[56:33] take that in for yourself the things how
[56:36] that god will bless you and how the god
[56:39] can can give you a peace when when
[56:42] there's turmoil in the home and there's
[56:45] turmoil uh where wherever in school or
[56:48] or or wherever you would be there is a
[56:51] piece of god that you can experience
[56:54] and you can get confidence that i've got
[56:57] representation
[56:59] as a daughter of god
[57:01] amen
[57:10] i'd invite the musicians
[57:12] to come
[57:14] at this time while i
[57:16] read you this
[57:18] this is from questions and answers
[57:19] number three
[57:22] and we we did condense this a little bit
[57:25] but so that you have a little bit of a
[57:29] a foreshadow of what brother branham is
[57:31] going to be discussing here the question
[57:33] comes up would you please explain first
[57:35] corinthians chapter 7
[57:37] verse 1 and 9.
[57:40] now
[57:41] what that next line is is verse 9. that
[57:44] is first corinthians chapter 7 verse 9.
[57:47] but if they cannot contain
[57:49] let them marry for it is better to marry
[57:53] than to burn
[57:56] brother branham says all right
[57:58] that's for just dirty living
[58:02] instead of a man a boy girl or something
[58:05] or another
[58:07] when they're going together and they
[58:08] know that they should be married go
[58:10] ahead and get married
[58:12] i think you'd understand what i mean
[58:14] don't you see
[58:16] don't just live a dirty little life
[58:18] there
[58:19] because it's not right you see
[58:23] that's your sister in one sense
[58:26] where if you're a christian
[58:28] now if it's the world it's the world dog
[58:30] eat dog
[58:32] but this girl that you're going with
[58:35] that's your sister too
[58:38] that'll be the mother of your children
[58:40] that will come
[58:42] don't live a dirty little life around
[58:44] her
[58:46] show that you're a real christian
[58:49] live like a christian gentleman ought to
[58:53] see
[58:54] and treat her like your sister
[58:57] and when you get married
[58:59] still treat her that way
[59:03] [Music]
[59:07] and you women
[59:09] live the right way to your husband
[59:12] and you husbands live the right way to
[59:15] your wives
[59:16] be real real nice and respect one
[59:20] another just with in your family
[59:22] relations and so forth like that
[59:25] let it be just as reverently and godly
[59:28] and agreed with among you and everything
[59:31] [Music]
[59:43] talk to your wife
[59:46] if one nature is to you
[59:49] and another nature to her
[59:51] talk it with her
[59:54] you try to do the same thing to him
[59:56] sister
[59:57] in the same way
[59:59] understand
[1:00:01] one another
[1:00:02] there's so much in just that word
[1:00:05] understand
[1:00:08] and be real christian gentlemen
[1:00:10] and real christian ladies
[1:00:12] brother and sister with one another
[1:00:15] always remember
[1:00:17] you're god's children
[1:00:20] and you're from royal family
[1:00:23] you're a royal blood
[1:00:26] there's no better blood in the world
[1:00:30] than yours
[1:00:33] and that's right
[1:00:35] and a royal blood
[1:00:37] shows itself
[1:00:39] that's what it is
[1:00:40] it's royal
[1:00:42] i'll believe that say amen
[1:00:45] yes sir
[1:00:46] show what you are
[1:00:49] i'm a son of a king
[1:00:52] i'm the son of the king
[1:00:56] my wife's a daughter of a king
[1:01:00] how would i treat that king's daughter
[1:01:03] how would she treat that king's son
[1:01:07] see what i mean be
[1:01:11] real
[1:01:12] genuine
[1:01:17] that's what i would want my daughters to
[1:01:19] be
[1:01:21] real
[1:01:22] genuine
[1:01:24] if you want to be a christian
[1:01:26] be a genuine christian
[1:01:29] you want to be a husband
[1:01:32] be a genuine husband
[1:01:34] you want to be a wife
[1:01:39] that's practical to me
[1:01:42] that's something that god has placed
[1:01:52] now as we look back at zechariah 9 9
[1:01:57] it says rejoice
[1:01:59] greatly
[1:02:01] o daughter of zion
[1:02:03] shout
[1:02:04] out daughter of jerusalem
[1:02:07] behold
[1:02:08] thy king cometh
[1:02:11] unto thee
[1:02:12] oh it's a little bit different you're
[1:02:14] not just a bystander
[1:02:16] who's watching a king coming
[1:02:19] but you're the son of the king
[1:02:22] you're a daughter of the king that makes
[1:02:24] the relationship a little bit different
[1:02:28] when we say thy king cometh he's your
[1:02:31] dad
[1:02:32] he's your daddy
[1:02:34] that's your father
[1:02:37] he's coming
[1:02:39] now in the message what is the
[1:02:40] attraction on the mountain
[1:02:42] this is the only message i can find
[1:02:44] where brother branham really elaborates
[1:02:46] on these scriptures what he points out
[1:02:50] is that the same prophet
[1:02:52] that speaks of the first coming of jesus
[1:02:54] christ
[1:02:56] and this is a prophecy of his coming
[1:02:59] that thy king cometh riding upon an ass
[1:03:01] upon the fall of an s and we see
[1:03:04] it come to pass when jesus is riding
[1:03:06] into jerusalem and they're laying down
[1:03:09] palms in their coats and they're saying
[1:03:11] hosanna hosanna to the highest those
[1:03:14] that were looking for him
[1:03:16] those that were attracted to something
[1:03:19] that was taking place those that were
[1:03:21] attracted to the word of god and knew
[1:03:23] that there was a coming messiah they
[1:03:25] were looking for him and when they
[1:03:27] recognized he was coming
[1:03:30] they began to shout
[1:03:32] hosanna
[1:03:33] hosanna to the highest
[1:03:36] but that same prophet
[1:03:38] that brought to us the recognition and a
[1:03:41] prophecy of the first coming of christ
[1:03:44] in zechariah chapter 14 and i'm just
[1:03:47] going to read the
[1:03:48] last part of
[1:03:50] verse 5 down to verse 7 and the lord my
[1:03:54] god
[1:03:55] shall come
[1:03:57] and all the saints with thee
[1:03:59] and it shall come to pass in that day
[1:04:02] that the light shall not be clear nor
[1:04:05] dark
[1:04:06] but it shall be one day which shall be
[1:04:09] known to the lord not day nor night but
[1:04:12] it shall come to pass that evening
[1:04:15] it shall be light brothers and sisters i
[1:04:18] believe we're living in the evening time
[1:04:21] and if we're living in the evening time
[1:04:24] we've been we've been uh put on uh on
[1:04:27] alert that you're living in the day of
[1:04:30] the second coming of the lord
[1:04:32] that we can look for him that those that
[1:04:34] are attracted to the things that god is
[1:04:37] doing in this day we can rejoice greatly
[1:04:40] o daughters of zion
[1:04:42] we can rejoice for our king who is our
[1:04:45] daddy he's coming for us
[1:04:48] he's coming again and he's let us know
[1:04:51] now
[1:04:54] in the message in time evangelism
[1:04:57] i just want to read this last portion
[1:05:00] brother branham says
[1:05:01] now we're going to end right here by
[1:05:04] saying
[1:05:05] [Music]
[1:05:07] end time this
[1:05:09] is to get the bride ready
[1:05:12] and prepared
[1:05:14] for the rapture
[1:05:18] this is a message
[1:05:21] this message of the hour
[1:05:23] is a message for daughters
[1:05:27] it's a message for you
[1:05:30] daughters of zion
[1:05:33] there is a rejoicing
[1:05:35] and knowing
[1:05:37] who your king is
[1:05:39] and when you can properly place him
[1:05:42] you'll be able to properly identify who
[1:05:44] you are
[1:05:46] and see your place as the bride of jesus
[1:05:48] christ
[1:05:50] isn't that wonderful
[1:05:52] isn't it beautiful
[1:05:54] let's stand together
