TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Acts chapter 2 verse 44 it says, "And all that believed were together and had all things common and sold their possessions and goods and parted them to all men as every man had need." And all that believed were together and had all things common and sold their possessions and goods and parted them as to all men as every man had need. You can be seated. I'm going to take my title directly from uh this scripture verse 44 it says all things common and continue on that subject we've been on of community trying to draw it from uh the scripture here where the Bible even mentioning that they continued in fellowship that word there is that togetherness or that community and so there's definitely a scriptural principle here worth exploring so if you could just look back at these verses we've just mentioned verses 44 and 45 and all that believe were together and that's very important aspect. They were of the same mind and the same heart and had all things common. And it's because of this basis. It says they sold their possessions and goods imparted them to all men as every man had need. When it says all things common, doesn't say all things in common, but it says all things common. It means ordinary or belonging to all. So that there was this uh what they had or that they o owned they used together or jointly or they um they were willing to share it or shared by all or many is how that might uh be phrased and they sold as much as was necessary so that they would have means to support those who didn't have. So someone had property and they could sell it and be a benefit and a blessing to those who didn't have um to those who had needs. That's what the scripture is uh referencing is the fact that what they had if they needed to they sold it and they shared the proceeds among everyone. Again, if this if you're just visiting today, we have a number of visitors. Don't get nervous. We're not doing our best to start a commune or redistribute wealth. We're just looking at this scriptural principle. And some have read this to mean, well, we all need to wear the same clothes. We all need to have all of our possessions in common. But that's not what the scripture is uh establishing as a precedent. The word common also is translated to unclean or defiled or unholy. And it's very interesting uh it in that context that they regarded or they had all things common. They looked at it in the sense that it's not sacred or holy. So anything was eligible to be let go of. There was nothing there was no sacred cows as it were that they would protect at all cost. everything was just common and so they regarded their earthly possessions, their assets, their income, all those things as ordinary such as they're willing to share it with whoever needed it or who would benefit from it. We find that it's not just isolated Acts 2 though it is uh it is mentioned amongst the church at Jerusalem in Acts 4:32 says and the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul. Again, this is this uh the preamble to this giving away is the they were of one heart, one soul. As it says in Acts chapter 2, they were together and then before all that they believed. So there was a common faith and then there was a common mind and heart. Neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own, but they had all things common. There's that phrase again where they had what they possessed and what they owned was shared. And the scriptures go on to describe those acts in Acts 4:es 32 and beyond. It tells what they did to distribute those things. And these scriptures at the very least show that there was some sense of togetherness or family or relationship or responsibility to one another. Uh elements that we might say reflect a community where they're unified together around something. They have some basis for feeling together. So, it shows this need for community, but then also the responsibility that one has when they are a part of something. And as we went over on Wednesday night, there's many different scriptures that demonstrate the that believers have a responsibility to, as the Bible says, the household of faith, do good unto all men, especially those of the household of faith. That there um there are those in your own family, a man has to take care of his family. There's a lot of responsibilities we have. So a lot of scriptures uh speak to this responsibility that we have as believers to be giving to look out after the needs of others. And the uh where we arrived at Wednesday night and I think this is the very important part. The strength to perform this duty is not found in being told that you have to do it. I don't think anybody has ever been asked to take out the trash and just because they WERE ASKED LIKE, "OH YES, YES, I've been endued with power from on high to take out the trash. But rather there is a strength in performing this duty is found in the unity of faith and this common love that they had for the word or something else that united them first and something else that they they found that gave them energy or gave them this identification and because they had the same mind and the same love and they were working towards the same goal. As needs arose and as they saw that it was necessary maybe to remove a hindrance or to bear somebody else's burden they gladly stepped in and helped out. So community does not begin with selling everything or just merely establishing that we must serve others. You can be told well eternal life is living for others which we believe but it's just not being told to do it that gives you the power. There has to be something within you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't do it by uh u program or process. You can't just establish well this is the definitions. These are the things we're going to do. And you can't use programs and and processes to make everything in common. That's not what's going to establish to have all things common. But having, and this may just be a little bit of a play on words, but having all things common, as the Bible mentions it in Acts two and Acts four, is possible when Christ is your common all things. &gt;&gt; Maybe just a little bit of maybe seem a little bit awkward, but I think you'll get my point as we continue that we can have all things common. It's possible when Christ is common, the common all things to every single one of us, the whole or every or all as the word all things there implies. If you'll turn to 1 Corinthians chapter 13, we're able just to push a little bit further. I think that sums up the first couple servicees. Well, I want to use this phrase all things in the New Testament to catch uh kind of the meaning of the phrase all things and what it implies uh and then how that it's applicable in Acts chapter 2 and and chapter 4, but then also the lesson that's being demonstrated to us. 1 Corinthians chapter 13:es 1:7. Though I speak with tongues of men and angels and have not charity, I become a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol. Now, these are very uh familiar scriptures to us, but think of how he's saying that there's gifts that can be displayed, but if you have not charity, that's going to be the repeated theme. Have not charity. And though I have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and though I have all faith, so that could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. &gt;&gt; So, now there's two uh two things to see here. If you have not charity, you have nothing. &gt;&gt; So, there's a there's an idea of nothing. And uh uh if you don't have charity, it's as if you have nothing at all. He says verse three, and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity, it profitth me nothing. could bring this back to the scriptures we've read of how that you must be a cheerful giver and you must look after the needs of others and and when you collect your bounty uh give willingly and all these different scriptures that we could use to show that the believers in the New Testament voluntarily and willingly gave and they paid their offerings and they gave tithes and there was ways that they're trying to support and they supported uh regions that had famines and in the early church we see them selling their possessions and distributing the wealth to those who didn't have but He said even if I did all that and didn't have charity it would do me no good. It profitth me nothing. So if you don't have charity kind of the result is nothing. It profits me nothing. I I have I am nothing. Then it describes charity in this way. Charity suffereth long and is kind. Charity envieth not. Charity vaunteth not itself. Is not puffed up. If you have if you name your daughter charity, there's a high bar here. Do not behave itself unseemly. Seketh not her own. So this is that uh every man looking upon the needs of others is not easily provoked thinkketh no evil rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth and then this phrase beareth all things believeth all things hopeeth all things endureth all things &gt;&gt; there without charity you're nothing and and if without charity it profits you nothing and there's this idea that well if I though I could do these things and speak with these great tongues and I don't have charity then I it's nothing special &gt;&gt; and he goes through these different uh one after another principle after principle after principle then he says but charity bears all things believes all things hopes all things endures all things so now there's not just there's a nothing and then there's everything &gt;&gt; there's a nothing and then there's all things without charity I'm nothing but then charity can bear all things believe all things hope all things endure all things I believe that there's Essentially what that word is meaning is everything. &gt;&gt; And the more I've studied this and found there's so many different phrases all things that it's it's just a word uh that's used to imply everything or the whole. But if charity without charity or nothing, then charity becomes everything. &gt;&gt; That if I could if I could do many wonderful works and have not charity and it profits me nothing, then charity is everything. If I can speak with tongues and don't have charity and it's it's really no distinction in it or I I'm just tooting my own horn, then charity is everything. So essentially charity we say believeth all things. It doesn't mean charity believes a lie. &gt;&gt; But it's it's kind of narrowing what we what all things is to imply. But so we can say let's say that charity is everything. &gt;&gt; Charity is all things. And if that's the case, I I believe we could do the math and say I know I know that makes us cringe. We don't want to have to do math on a Sunday morning, but for the Christian, Christ must be everything. &gt;&gt; Church can't be everything. &gt;&gt; I think it's very brave of me to say as a pastor, church can't be everything. There's one person who wakes up on Sunday morning and and doesn't really have a choice whether or not they want to go, and that's the person preaching. And and you don't say, "I wonder if I want to go to church today." You you just go to church. So my family and I, we uh God has called us to serve the church. So that's our what that's the dominant uh calling in our lives. Well, I know you don't have the same calling. So I'm not going to hold you to the same standard of well, they're not thinking about the church every day and they're not wondering about this and praying about that because church can't be your everything. &gt;&gt; Church shouldn't be your everything. Your family's not your everything. Community is not everything. &gt;&gt; Those things aren't the everything. Christ is the everything. &gt;&gt; Because if Christ isn't the everything, church means nothing. &gt;&gt; Family is going to profit you nothing. There's there's a point at which these things begin to be devalued. &gt;&gt; In 1 Corinthians chapter 15 27 and 28, I want to look at these scriptures that use this phrase in all things to see how that Christ should have uh be everything. For heath put all things under his feet. &gt;&gt; But when he saith all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is expected which did put all things under him. And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him. Huh? I'm getting dizzy. But all things are under his feet. All things are put under him, subdued under him. He's put all things under that God may be ultimately. Why is all this subduing? Why is all this undering and ordering? That God may be all in all. &gt;&gt; That means overall holy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Completely. God may be all in all. That's the goal. That God would be all in all. &gt;&gt; So he's putting all things under his feet. God has put all things under the sun, under Christ, and made all things subject so that when that happens, God has the preeminence in everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Colossians chapter 1 15 to 20 say, "Who is the image of the invisible God? The firstborn of every creature." This is speaking specifically of Christ. For by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. All things were created by him and for him. &gt;&gt; And he is before all things and by him all things consist. &gt;&gt; We could take this to try to be very very um deliberate in terms of saying well all things he's created all thrones and so we think oh so he's the originator of Game of Thrones. Okay. And dominions. Ah, so he he invented the the card game and principalities. And we begin to think about our high school principal and said, "No, it's not that we're going to try to make everything fit linguistically, but he's just saying this is the totality of things. &gt;&gt; Everything. He is before all things, and by him all things consist. And he is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in all things he might have the preeminence." Amen. &gt;&gt; It could be that this phrase in here is what I I'm zeroing in on as I just let it unfold through it last week. That in all things all things he might have the preeminence in everything the preeminent one to be overall. For it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell. And having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself. By him I say whether the the blood um by him I say whether they be things in earth or things in heaven. A lot of things things in heaven things in earth but he says he's going to reconcile all things by himself that in all things he might have the preeminence because he is before all things and by him all things consist that that the the all things now is is is relative and has its meaning in Christ. Ephesians 1:es 22 to 23 and hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that fleth all in all. Let me be that's another angle to approach that in all things he might have the prim to fillth all in all. He has a body. Christ has a body over which he's the head but the the headship comes so that he can control the body. He can have preeminence in the body. It's what's necessary for a body change. &gt;&gt; He puts everything under his feet. All things, he says, that he might be the head over all things, everything holy to the church. &gt;&gt; That God might be all in all. &gt;&gt; So, if I could phrase it this way, Christ is the all things common to the church. &gt;&gt; And to the Christian, the church being the the body. &gt;&gt; In other words, there's nothing outside of him. That's right. &gt;&gt; What What is What is church if Christ isn't a part of this? &gt;&gt; Could you imagine if you attend a church and the the pastor gets up and says, "We're we're we're no longer a Christian church. We don't want to be identified as Christians and we're not going to preach Christ. We're going to preach good and we're inclusive and everyone can come and be a part of it." Then that changes everything. &gt;&gt; It it the picture's completely changed because Christ is that all things common, everything. He's everything to the to his body and to the Christian individually. Ephesians 1:10 puts it this way that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ. He was to bring these things together, gather together, combine them, join them in one all things in Christ. &gt;&gt; Both which are in heaven and which are on earth, even in him. All things are in Christ. Christ is in all things. This is the kind of the theme we're getting from the scripture. Everything is Christ. Everything I need is him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But there is a sufficiency in Christ. There there is a power in Christ. There's a THERE'S THIS TOTALITY OF EVERYTHING IN HIM. &gt;&gt; And it may seem to be somewhat poetic. Or you might begin to think, well, that's that's just when WE SAY, OH, THAT means everything to me. and someone buys you a gift or says, "You know, you look nice today." They said, "That means everything to me." We don't walk away going everything. We we understand what they're trying to mean. BUT HERE, THIS THIS is everything. &gt;&gt; That I believe that's the point of some of these scriptures where it says that all things consist by him, that he might have the primitance in all things. Without me, he says, you are nothing. &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 8:6, but to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him, and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him. It's identifying a a reality of faith, an existence that is of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. and and and these other things, whether it be in heaven or earth, there's this zeroing in on this subjection to the Almighty. Ephesians chapter 4:10, he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things. &gt;&gt; That in all things he might have the preeminence, that God may be all in all. That he might fill all things. Christ is to have preeminence in his church and he's to have preeminence in the Christian. &gt;&gt; It would be nice if we could find the perfect church and having found it where Christ has the preeminence we could become a part of it and therefore we could say Christ has preeminence in the church but he only has preeminence in the church to the extent that he has place in the individual's life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That as he has preeminence in the individual is he has preeminence in the Christian. That's how his he begins to have preeminence in the entire body. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then there's no one singular church. Arizona Believers Church. You could even say it this way. We cleverly cleverly named the name Arizona Believers Church, acknowledging that there's going to be three kinds of believers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Every church has three kinds of believers. &gt;&gt; You have believers. You have make believers. You have unbelievers. &gt;&gt; But in the body of Christ, THERE IS ONLY ONE, the believer. &gt;&gt; That's that that that's the body. That's the church. and Christ having preeminence. This is this is an end time. As brother Random preaches, Christ is the mystery of God revealed. That three-fold purpose of Christ that um that there would be a revealing of God the father, God revealed in his son, the fullness of God revealed TO HIS SON AND TO have preeminence in his church. &gt;&gt; He wants to have preeminence. CHRIST WANTS TO BE THE PREEMINENT ONE. And this is especially relevant in when you look in Revelations chapter 3 when Christ HAS BEEN KICKED OUT of the church. &gt;&gt; He he he's not even uh they have their names. They have the name Christian. &gt;&gt; And that's where Isaiah says that seven women will take a hold of one man and say, "Let us eat our own bread, wear our own clothes, do our own thing, but let us be named after you." &gt;&gt; We want to be called Christians, BUT WE DON'T WANT TO BE SUBJECT TO A HUSBAND. WE DON'T WANT TO BE SUBJECT to Christ the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; So Christ IS KICKED OUT OF THE CHURCH. SO IT'S EVEN MORE important that we recognize that's the heir is to not give him his due not give him the first place and that he fulfill that he fill all in all that Christ would have preeminence. I believe the work of Christ in the believer is to change all things &gt;&gt; or change everything. If that's the phrase that resonates with you, it's the process of transforming everything. I think the life of a Christian as it continues the the spirit uh does its work in one's heart year after year after year it it's a continual growing &gt;&gt; in Christ &gt;&gt; should be in 2 Corinthians 5 161 17 and 18 wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh yeah though we have known Christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we him no more therefore If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature, a new creation, &gt;&gt; born again by the Holy Ghost, born again by that uh that incorruptible seed. Old things are passed away. &gt;&gt; So the old things are have lost some there's something been lost and they're passed away. Behold, all things are become new. Amen. &gt;&gt; I would it's not wouldn't be hard to guess that many of you have thought about, well, what does even mean all things became new? I know that I've received the Holy Spirit. I know my life is different. I'm walking in the the the newness of life and and the Holy Spirit is in my heart. But what does it mean? All things are become new. And you're saying, "Well, then answer the question. Just think about it. The Bible says all things are become new. And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given us the ministry of reconciliation, because Christ IS TO RECONCILE ALL THINGS. &gt;&gt; SO WHEN YOU ARE BORN AGAIN, when you receive this Holy Ghost, in Christ, all things become new. &gt;&gt; It's as if there was in the old things there was meaning, there was life, there was value, there was there was a system. And then whenever you became a new creature, this completely changes. &gt;&gt; Maybe some of the the the same ideas and elements and terminologies and obviously the same oxygen you're breathing and you still live in the same city and there may be a lot of things that are still the same, but it's as if everything's been completely changed. &gt;&gt; This is the work of Christ and the believer to change all things. &gt;&gt; Notice this dimension to it. Philippians 4 12-13. I know both how to be abased and I know how to abound. I I want to get into the knowing how to abound part. I think I'm getting that abase down perfect. Everywhere and in all things I am instructed to both be full and to be hungry. Both to abound and to suffer need. There's Paul really showing you just uh what it means to have all things. Be full and hungry. Abound and to suffer need. All things. And then he says in verse 13,"I can do all things through Christ which strengthenth me." &gt;&gt; This is the potential of Christ. I can do all things through Christ which strengthenth me. &gt;&gt; I I I I had some of the scriptures in here to use. Maybe we'll and we took them out of our notes to possibly push to Wednesday night. But it says with with man this is impossible. With God &gt;&gt; all things that it opens up a whole another realm. all things common. And then we FIND IT'S THROUGH CHRIST THAT WE CAN DO ALL THINGS. It's through Christ that all things become new and all things are of God. I love how he says, "I can do all things through Christ which strengthenth me." And many times we use that whenever we're facing something uh that we want to be able to accomplish for great means. And he's basically saying, "I know how to be abased. I know how to be hungry. I know how to suffer need BECAUSE IN CHRIST I CAN DO ALL THINGS. &gt;&gt; I can suffer need. I can be hungry. I can be a based &gt;&gt; but then I also know how to be full to abound because I can do all things through Christ which strengthen me. &gt;&gt; Romans chapter 8 vers 28 we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose. &gt;&gt; And so we CAN'T JUST SAY ALL THINGS WORK TOGETHER FOR GOOD. We have to say for them that love God and are called according to his purpose all things work together for good. &gt;&gt; So he's qualified it already within the verse itself. To them that love God and are called according to his purpose. Whatever transpires, whatever is working, God will ultimately resolve it. He'll bring it to good. It says all things work together for good. We know that implies then that not everything is good. &gt;&gt; But that God works all things together. &gt;&gt; All things common. I'm hoping that we can just again and it may seem to be somewhat semantic just using the phrase all thing, but instead of just saying, well, we need to share. We need to learn how to share and and we need learn to get along and we're going to start a ride share program in the church. Not everyone should be able to drive all these late model cars and and and have, you know, less than 2,000 miles on a vehicle. Everyone should be able to enjoy that and experience that. So, we're going to share vehicles. We're going to share we're going to everybody's just going to share things. Do a home share thing, right? You know, that like you can live in our house, we'll live in yours. We just we're all every all things common. Well, there there's a way that people come up with not so much the extremes in that way, but they're trying to use program or process to achieve community, and it doesn't work that way. Now, you can achieve a community. I mean, you just have to become a certain age. You could become part of the Sun City community, right? And there's rules. There's graduation. There's ways that YOU BECOME A PART OF SOMETHING. BUT THIS ONE IS NOT PROGRAMMED. This is not process. This is God's mind. THIS IS GOD'S PROGRAM. This is something very supernatural. So, these things that ARE RELATE TO GOD. WE CAN'T JUST TRY TO BE A FAMILY BECAUSE WE'RE RELATED. THOSE ARE THE WORST kinds of family. [laughter] Hey, for some or there's things that we'll do, I think we're fellowshipping on this, brother Anthony. There's things we'll do in the name of family, in the name of Christianity that um are inexcusable in the name of Christ. &gt;&gt; And so, there has to be something more at the core, at the heart. Can't do it by government. That would be communism. &gt;&gt; You can't do it by force. all things common in Acts. It was the impact that the word was having on their hearts. &gt;&gt; It's the word that was doing it. &gt;&gt; Peter's sermon on the day of Pentecost was, "Men and brethren, what what must we do?" Well, sell all you have, &gt;&gt; give to the poor. It's not what he said to do. When Jesus even said that to the rich young ruler, he knew he was ident. He had a question. what must I do? And he's saying, if any man will come after me, if any man's going to follow me, if you want to follow me, he had to love Christ more &gt;&gt; than what he had. &gt;&gt; And so when the believers were parting with their their possessions and selling these things, it was very contextual to that that church at Jerusalem. But it's the impact of the word in Acts chapter 6:7. Did you catch that, guys? Acts 6:7. trying to ingratiate myself to the the youth. Remember that when you hit like and subscribe AND THE WORD OF God increased and the number of disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly and great company of the priests were obedient to the faith. Was this by legislation? Was this by law? Was this by popularity? Was this by using uh buzzwords for the current generation? No, the word of God increased. &gt;&gt; And as the word of God increased, the number of disciples multiplied greatly. And even amongst the priesthood, THEY WERE OBEDIENT TO THE FAITH BECAUSE THE WORD OF GOD INCREASED. &gt;&gt; THIS WASN'T a a this wasn't a change of community and that the priests are like, "Man, I'm tired of this country club. I hear there's a really nice one now over here and they've got better rules and better food and so I'm going to change groups." This was because the word of God was increasing. Acts 12:4, but the word of God grew and multiplied. IT BECAME GREATER and increased. This was true. As the word grew IN THE INDIVIDUAL'S LIVES, SO THAT IT GREW CORPORATELY in the body of Christ. The word of God grew and multiplied. &gt;&gt; Acts chapter 19 20. So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed. Mightily grew. This is in strength. And prevailed. As the word of God grew, there was it prevailed. This is power to overcome. &gt;&gt; We can we would never want to accomplish something by force or by privilege or by opportunity. That that's not how we want to accomplish things as Christians. We do it by faith in the word of God, &gt;&gt; by the word. And and it's the testimony. There's a there's a power of God that we tap into through the word of God that we're not trying to achieve through some other means. &gt;&gt; The word of God grew and prevailed. &gt;&gt; You want to have more of Christ? Welcome to receive his word. &gt;&gt; In Ephesians chapter 4:1 15, but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ. Christ is all things. &gt;&gt; How is it accomplished? By speaking the truth in love. &gt;&gt; By speaking the truth in love. By the word of God, we may grow up into him in all things. We may grow up into Christ the whole everything. This scripture says everything is Christ. &gt;&gt; All things is Christ. The purpose of the word being preached, speaking the truth and love. I WOULD GROW UP INTO HIM IN ALL THINGS. If you wanted to use A DIFFERENT TERMINOLOGY, HE COULD GROW AND increase in you to be everything to be the all in all. &gt;&gt; So these things are happening because the word of God is growing. &gt;&gt; The word of God is increasing. &gt;&gt; The word of God is like a seed. A &gt;&gt; and Jesus using the parable of the sewer describes the word of God being sown and increasing to a hundfold. That's the work of God in your life. In reality, the word of God is complete. It is full. It is perfect. Nothing needs to be added to it. There's nothing wrong with the word. But the process of the word in an individual's life is that process of the seed being watered and that life having preeminence. And as that life begins to grow inside of you, it pushes things out. &gt;&gt; It's when we get a little bit stagnant in our experience with God that there there's these little areas where things can kind of creep back in. Right? &gt;&gt; May we get a little bit uh cold and indifferent, but the more the word has preeminence, the less power earthly things have over a person. &gt;&gt; I'm wanting this to be uh joined with our understanding of what the believers did in the early church. This wasn't, and I I know I'm maybe just falling back on this phrase. There wasn't a uh well, maybe I'll just read it in Acts chapter 5. I I wasn't going to read this, but let's just let's just read through this and um just as a a as a a word of warning. How's that? Ananas and Safh or just for context that this is something this was something very real. You say, well, it wasn't like, well, you know, if you don't want to sell this, you want to sell that. But there was something that once they begin to operate within it, it was beyond themselves. It was beyond governments. It was beyond personalities and politics. This wasn't being legislated by the disciples. This wasn't uh a democratic socialism. Says, "But a certain" and if you were to read the verses before it, having land sold it and brought the money and laid it at the apostles feet. And it says this in verse 34 of chapter 4, uh none of them lacked for they were possess those that were possessors of lands or houses sold them and brought the price of things that were sold and laid them at the apostles feet. And distribution was made unto every man according to as he had need. This is what's happening within the church, this distribution of possessions. And then chapter 5 begins with but a certain man named Ananas with with Safhara his wife sold a possession. So they chose to operate with the body that that this is maybe what they represented. This is what they're saying. We've sold and kept back part of the price. His wife also being privy to it and brought a certain part and laid it at the apostles feet. These things are very uh it's very interesting story in the early church if I could just put it that way. And I I know that's certainly understating it. But Peter said, Ananas, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost and to keep back part of the price of the land? How is it he's lying to the Holy Ghost? Just ponder this dynamic that as the believers were selling things and taking the price and dist and putting at the apostles feet to be distributed. They participate, they sell, BUT THEY KEEP BACK PART OF THE PRICE. AND SO BY TESTIMONY OR BY CONFESSION OR BY ACTION, THEY'RE IMPLYING THAT WE'RE DOING WHAT EVERYONE else was doing. [clears throat] And to hold back wasn't lying to Peter. It wasn't a lying to the rest of the apostles. IT'S LYING TO GOD. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? While it remained, was it not thine own? These are very good questions. I, as I was looking into these, and I had uh thought to perhaps address these things on Wednesday or next Sunday, while it remained, was it not thy own? And after it was sold, was it not in thy own power? It's this was yours to begin with. &gt;&gt; You have control OVER IT. WHY HAST thou conceived this thing in thine heart? Thou hast not light UNTO MEN, BUT UNTO GOD. &gt;&gt; Something dishonest that they did in their hearts. Something they thought that they could they did. WERE THEY RECOGNIZING THE GRAVITY OF IT? Were they just caught up? This this may is is not meant to uh put FEAR ON ANY ONE of us, but did they just see everyone else worshiping and everyone else going to church and and they're like, "Well, let's just do our part so we can look like we're part of IT AND LET'S SELL THIS." and well, I don't know if I'm absolutely convinced of this. And well, let's we want everyone to think we're going along with this. So, they give a LITTLE BIT. AND IT JUST SHOWS THAT THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT NOT UH GIVING your all. There's something ABOUT HOLDING IT BACK THAT YOU YOU MAY FOOL EVERYBODY ELSE, BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING to fool God. &gt;&gt; And the consequence of LYING TO GOD IS DEATH. &gt;&gt; You know, well, THE CONSEQUENCE OF NOT NOT PRETENDING TO BE LIKE EVERYONE ELSE AND GOING ALONG WITH THE FLOW IS THAT I WOULD BE REJECTED OR I WOULDN'T FEEL A PART OF IT. LISTEN, DON'T LET THE FEAR OF MISSING OUT CAUSE YOU TO PRETEND TO be a Christian. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't want to displease God. &gt;&gt; Thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God. And Ananas, hearing these words, fell down, and gave up the ghost. And great fear came on all them that heard these things. And the young men arose, wound him up, and carried him out, and buried him. And it was the space of three hours after when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in. Peter answered unto her, "Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much." And she said, "Yay, for so much. Why the dishonesty? Why the lying?" Then Peter said unto her, "How is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the spirit of the Lord? Behold, the feet of them which buried thy husband are at the door, and shall carry thee out." Then she fell down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the ghost. And the young men came in, found her dead, and carried her forth, buried her by her husband. And great fear came upon all the church and upon as many as heard these things and every single one of us said yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is in the establishment of the church. Then it begins to say that many signs and wonders were done by the apostles and by the church and the and the public in the face of the people at Solomon's porch. But here's this dynamic operating within the church where people be led of the Lord are giving a and they're supporting. But it wasn't it wasn't done at the fear, you know, the threat of punishment. But as the word had premised, the love of the love of these other things diminished. And the love the love of property and possessions is one of the strongest powers in the human psychology. It's a very very powerful motivator. They've studied it from a number of different d uh directions just to figure it out that there's something about physical possession. They say possession is nine10enth of the law. It's 11 1110 of our our mindset that when you have something there's this pride of ownership. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We tend to get place higher value on things that we own. &gt;&gt; Right. And so the love of property and possessions is is a strong power motivates us. Yet somehow as the word begin to have preeminence, possessions begin to lose their power. In Philippians chapter 2 20- 21, Paul says, "For I have no man likeminded who will naturally care for your state." I have no man like-minded who will naturally care for your state. What a what a statement. For all seek their own, not the things which are Christ's. &gt;&gt; This is he said, I have a different kind of mindset towards these things and I I naturally instinctively I care for your condition. I care what you're going through. But then he says, for all seek their own. I think this forms uh this is at the core of what Paul is using to address the church at Philippi. He's he's using this language say that people tend to be more selfish. They tend to look upon their own needs. They seek their own. They seek their own reputation. They seek their own possessions, their own prestige or popularity and not the things which are Christ. &gt;&gt; To someone their possessions are everything. &gt;&gt; They're they're they're precious to them. But he's saying to me, I that's I think all I have all things common because I value the things which are Christ. I seek the things which are Christ. All things are Christ. So chapter 3:12 he says and and I want to come back to verse one of this chapter in the closing he says now as though I had not as though I'd already attained either were already perfect but I follow after this is a pursuit if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus. Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth into those things which are before. I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Here he here he's saying this is what I I don't have this attitude. Again, we'll we'll drop back to some more of the context for this, but he says I'm I'm pressing forth. I'm reaching forward. I want this prize that of the high call of God in Christ Jesus. And he says in the prior chapter, not every everyone's seeking their own, but I seek the things which are Christs. Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded, and if anything in anything ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you. Nevertheless, where until we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing. Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as you have us for an example. For many walk of whom I've told you often and now tell you even weeping that they are enemies of the cross of Christ. Catch this phrase here in verse 19. Whose end is destruction whose God is their belly. Whose glory is their shame who mind earthly things &gt;&gt; that seek their own and their end is destruction. Their god is their own desires. Whose god is their belly. What they want. what they're when they're hungry, when they need to be clothed. &gt;&gt; But he's saying, "Let us mind the same thing. Let us walk by the same rule." And he's he's speaking of reaching forward to those things which are before, pressing toward the mark for the prize of the high calling in God in Christ Jesus. Well, what kind of mind did he did he have? Let this mind be in you which was in Christ Jesus. Let every man not look on his own things, but look on the things of others. You have to recognize this in the context of this greater letter. Maybe go and read the whole the letter to yourselves to see that this is the theme that he's he's tracking. He says, "Let this mind be in you. Walk by the same rule. Let us mind the same thing." That there is this humility to be willing to serve and to give and to be a part of something greater THAN OURSELVES AND NOT ALWAYS TRYING TO PROTECT OURSELVES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. The instincts that we have as human beings have a lot to do with surviving a &gt;&gt; and whether or not we live and whether or not we survive and whether or not we eat and whether or not we're clothed or we're warm when it's cold. And so there's a lot of survival instincts. But when we can let go of THIS SELF-P PROTECTIONISM AND SELF-S SURVIVAL AND REALIZE THAT CHRIST CAN DO FOR me what I am not EVEN ABLE TO DREAM of &gt;&gt; that it's a trusting no longer in self [snorts] &gt;&gt; and trusting in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. So it's a as he's admonishing them that they I tell you now weeping that there's people who mind earthly things. This is what has the preeminence. Says for our conversation is in heaven from whence also we look for the savior the lord Jesus Christ looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith. We're looking beyond the natural things. We're looking beyond the human things who shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body according to the working whereby he is able to even to subdue all things. unto himself. &gt;&gt; There is a rearranging of desire. There's an a a reordering of priorities. &gt;&gt; And this willingness to give is a mark of Christ apprehending possessing uh possessing the heart. Christ has more of me the less of the world I want. Yes, &gt;&gt; this is this is the literal product of Christ having preeminence. The more preeminence he has, the less preeminence the world has. &gt;&gt; What was the phrase that uh one of the great writers of the past said, "How do you keep the tears out of bushels? Pack them full of wheat, &gt;&gt; the more that they could be packed full of the good, there's less room for the bad." &gt;&gt; It it's a reordering of what we value. So again, we could have it's one of the things I don't take uh I don't know if you I just mentioned Dr. James Dobson and I think uh bless his heart I believe he passed away in the last year or so. Uh but there's an ide far just initially but do you realize even that could be wrong &gt;&gt; if the focus is the family and not Christ? &gt;&gt; But as Christ comes in focus the family comes in view. Amen. &gt;&gt; HOW COULD YOU NOT WANT CHRIST FOR YOUR CHILDREN? I HAVE NO GREATER JOY THAN TO SEE MY CHILDREN WALKING IN TRUTH. I I WANT CHRIST TO HAVE PREEMINENCE IN MY HOME. I WANT HIM TO BE WELCOME AT OUR TABLE. AND THERE'S THIS ATTITUDE THAT WHEN CHRIST COMES INTO FOCUS, IT'S NOT THAT when we say these OTHER THINGS COME INTO FOCUS, WE BEGIN TO SEE them in light of Christ. &gt;&gt; Matthew chapter 19 29. I I this is going to be one of those sermons where it's like, man, he read from Acts chapter 5 about Ananas and Safh, then Matthew 19, and then Matthew 10. And those are going to be the only things people remember. And everyone that hath forsaken houses or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my name's sake &gt;&gt; shall receive a hundfold and shall inherit everlasting life. If these words seem difficult to receive, he is qualifying it for his sake, &gt;&gt; for Christ's sake. &gt;&gt; If you have forsaken houses, brothers, sisters, father, mother, wife, children, or lands for the sake of Christ, you're going to receive a hundfold. So he says elsewhere in this life and the life to come inherit everlasting life for his sake. &gt;&gt; If he just said any man that forsakes houses uh mother, wife, children or lands shall receive a hundfold. You know that would be a very easy get-rich scheme. Forsaken it all. You say, "Well, no wonder these people have had a hundred wives. They just keep forsaking and they get keep getting more. But it's for my name's sake. &gt;&gt; Jesus is saying this. And if he doesn't TAKE TIME TO EXPLAIN IT, he's at least letting it GET INSIDE YOUR HEAD A LITTLE BIT. LIKE, WHOA, WAIT A MINUTE. WHAT? Is that even an option? Is that would that even be necessary? In chapter 10, he says it this way. Verse 34, "Think not that I come to send peace on earth. Christmas is over. Think not that I come to SEND PEACE ON EARTH. I CAME NOT TO SEND PEACE, but a sword." Yes. &gt;&gt; For I am come to set a man at variance. &gt;&gt; This is disagreement. This is at odds. This is emnity. Set a man at variance against his father and the daughter against her mother and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. And a man's foe shall be they of his own household. And this seems to be him specifically saying, "I've come with a sword and I'm going to cleave. I'm going to separate father from son, daughter from mother. There's going to be a a there's going to be a variance AND DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN DAUGHTER-IN-LAW and mother-in-law. How come it doesn't say anything about son son-in-laws here? [snorts] And the follows are going to be in your own house. So he gives us some color to this in verse 37. He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me. He that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. &gt;&gt; We really need to read this and maybe it it it's maybe it's a phrase that's mentioned so often we're able to kind of put it in a category maybe it just becomes poetry but this is very these are very real words. If you love your children more than you love Christ then you're not worthy of Christ. Now, this would be good. This would be a good bullet point under uh God is a narcissist, right? &gt;&gt; But think of what he's trying to say. &gt;&gt; If these things are worth more, if when IT CAME DOWN TO WHETHER OR NOT YOU WOULD ACCEPT CHRIST OR RECEIVE CHRIST OR FOLLOW CHRIST OR KEEP YOUR FAMILY OR HAVE THIS AND YOU WOULD SAY, "WELL, I'D RATHER be with my wife." He says, "You're not worthy of me. If I could say it this way to help you, you don't understand the value &gt;&gt; of Christ. &gt;&gt; That if you DON'T SEE THE VALUE OF CHRIST, IF YOU HAVE A IF YOU WOULD BE WILLING TO CHOOSE lands or in-laws OR FAMILY AND ALL THESE OTHER THINGS OVER CHRIST, WE SAYS, "YOU'RE NOT WORTHY OF ME." HE'S NOT SAYING IT IN THIS NARCISSISTIC WAY. WE'RE LIKE, "OH my goodness, that's just distasteful." SAYS, "YOU CLEARLY DON'T UNDERSTAND THE VALUE of Christ &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IN CHRIST IS YOUR FAMILY. IN CHRIST ARE LANDS AND POSSESSIONS. THROUGH CHRIST, DO YOU REALIZE THAT AN UNBELIEVING SPOUSE IS REDEEMED THROUGH THE SPOUSE THAT VALUES CHRIST &gt;&gt; THAT I COULD DO ALL THINGS THROUGH CHRIST? THAT IN CHRIST IS ALL THINGS. THAT I SEE CHRIST AS THE WAY OF HAVING MY FAMILY. I SEE CHRIST AS THE WAY OF TRULY ENJOYING LANDS and possessions." Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He that would love these other things more than Christ clearly doesn't know the value of Christ. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham goes to great lengths and different ways to say this, but that's what science and religion is trying to do today is to cut away at the value of the word. &gt;&gt; And use all sorts of uh uh and and the dishonest in doing it too. &gt;&gt; In Luke 14 26, it says it this way. If any man come to me and hate not his father and mother and wife and children and brother and sisters and some of you are going yes YES YES AND HIS OWN life and some might say okay all right good I'm good there me hate me and his own life also he cannot be my disciple &gt;&gt; and the language seems to be very very uh difficult and heavy IF YOU'RE GOING TO FOLLOW ME AS HE TOLD THE PREACHING LORD, FOLLOW ME. SELL WHAT YOU HAVE. GIVE TO THE POOR. COME FOLLOW ME. TAKE UP YOUR CROSS AND FOLLOW ME. IF ANY MAN'S GOING TO COME TO ME. IF HE'S GOING TO ENJOY UH IF HE'S GOING TO BE SEEN OF me and live in me and I IN HIM, HE HAS TO HATE HIS FATHER, MOTHER, WIFE, CHILDREN, BROTHERS, SISTERS, and his own life. Because if any man will follow me and be my disciple, Christ has to be everything. The hate there is not to create animus towards other people but it's to order your love that my love is for the word &gt;&gt; that's where my that's what my love is for that's where my loyalty is too &gt;&gt; and that if when Christ becomes all things then all things become common &gt;&gt; even down to lands and in-laws and children and mother and father and life when the word is valued above everything everything becomes common what what is what is worth the Bible even goes so far as to say Jesus said if any man who wants to save his life and keep his life and protect his life you're going to lose it &gt;&gt; sir &gt;&gt; Philippians chapter 3:es 1 to1 11 we took the scripture where he said that they mind earthly things we read in chapter 2 where he says they seek their own and not the things that are Christ. We read in chapter four where he says I can do all things through Christ. Read from other places in Philippians earlier. There's there there's a lot that he's expressing here. Let this mind be in you which was in Christ Jesus. So he's kind of I know we're taking this a little bit out of order but I thought it would just maybe resonate differently this morning this way. Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not grievious, but for you it is safe. Beware of dogs. Beware of evil workers. Beware of the concision. This is this is where safety is. For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh. though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinkketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more. I just love how Paul is. He's how he says, "Well, everyone else seeks their own, but not me. &gt;&gt; I actually care for you. And if an angel from heaven came and preached to you something other than what I'm preaching, let that angel from heaven be cursed." &gt;&gt; This is the This is the prophet Paul. This is the Apostle Paul. This is why some believe that Paul was the antichrist that hijacked Christianity. But this is the word of God to us. And he shows that in his flesh he had a lot to brag about. Circumcised the eighth day of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews, touching the law, Pharisee, concerning zeal, persecuting the church, touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless. Quite the resume. Quite the outward works, the adherence to rules and regulations as a Pharisee, a zealot. The law kept it. Pharisee of the Pharisees, a Hebrew of the Hebrews, of the stock of Israel, circumcised on the eighth day. I've got all these things are all lined up. THIS MAKES ME PART OF THE CLUB. But he says in verse 7, "But what things were gained to me? Those I counted loss for Christ." HIS ENTIRE IDENTITY. He was willing to lose it and allow it to be stripped away not just for anything but for Christ. &gt;&gt; So he says, "Yay doubtless AND I COUNT ALL THINGS but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I HAVE SUFFERED THE LOSS OF all things and do count them but dung that I may win Christ." &gt;&gt; Amen. This is this great paradigm shift for Paul. All the things he valued, all the things he pursued, even the things that caused him to persecute the church, HE WAS DOING IT ZEALOUSLY FOR THE LAW, FOR A GOD THAT HE KNEW WAS RIGHT. LISTEN, not that he thought was right, that he knew was right. &gt;&gt; But now in this paradigm shift, everything outward, everything external, EVERYTHING BY THE LAW AND BY THE FLESH, NOW HE REALIZES, I'M WILLING TO COUNT everything loss. In all things he counts as dung. I say quite often we don't need the Greek to understand that &gt;&gt; he counts all things for loss. ALL THINGS I DO COUNT THEM BUT DUNG that I may win everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; THAT I MAY HAVE ALL THINGS. &gt;&gt; SO IT'S THIS COMPLETE REVERSAL WHERE AT ONE TIME THE THIS WORLD AND WHAT IT HOLDS IS EVERYTHING TO YOU BUT THEN CHRIST BECOMES EVERYTHING. &gt;&gt; And so you're WILLING TO LOSE ALL THINGS THAT YOU MIGHT GAIN ALL THINGS. CHRIST. &gt;&gt; I've suffered the loss of all things. I count all things that lost that I may win Christ or for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ. Jesus says my Lord. &gt;&gt; He says, "And be found in him, not having my own righteousness which is of the law, but that which is through faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith." It's it's from this faith that our good works are born. Not by becoming up coming up with a metric of what good works is. We can just do that using chat GPT now, right? And it even gives us bullet points. And if you'd like me to, I will tell you how to perform this tomorrow, right? How about you just do it for me? Is there a way you could just get me out of bed at 5 if that's really the ideal time to get up? And who knows how long it's going to be till they can just implant a chip, right? And it's like we're up at 5 and we're brushing our teeth and we're making our bed and we're doing all these rules to live by. But this is what that would just be a cheap knockoff of what the Holy Spirit's wanting to do in you &gt;&gt; to cause you to will and to do of his good pleasure. &gt;&gt; So righteousness by by faith, not by law. And he says that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings, the community of his sufferings being made conformable unto death. if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead. &gt;&gt; And that's when he says, not as though I've already attained, was already perfect, but I pursue, I seek, I don't mind earthly things. I'm pursuing heavenly things. &gt;&gt; As Christ has apprehended me, and I know that he has fully possessed my soul. I want to apprehend him. I WANT TO KNOW HIM MORE, &gt;&gt; BE FOUND in him, &gt;&gt; not having my own righteousness, BUT I WANT HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS BY FAITH. For the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus, my Lord, all things have passed away, and all things have become new. &gt;&gt; As we invite our musicians to come, this statement has meant a lot to me. I'm sure I'm sure it has to you, many of you. But in reading these scriptures of if any man forsakes these things that are precious for his sake, he'll give them back. You'll receive a hundfold. If any man love these other things more than me, he says, I cannot be my disciple. He that loveth these other things more than me is not worthy of me. It speaks to the value that we place on Christ. in the sermon, the power of transformation, if you could, I have it quoted here, but he says, "Sometimes you have to separate from everything that's dear on earth to you to take your position that God [music] has called you to." &gt;&gt; You have to separate from everything that's dear. &gt;&gt; That doesn't maybe become unfeilling. Would it be easy if we did just instinctively hate everyone else but Christ? And that and that was the work of the Holy Ghost. I hate you. Oh Jesus. Jesus. Precious Jesus. But you separate from things dear to you. You have a love. You have feeling for the people. SO YOU HAVE TO SEPARATE FROM THINGS THAT ARE DEAR TO TAKE your position that God has called you to. And he says, I'm sure you can read between the lines of what I'm saying. Sometimes the very dearest person on earth, you have to shake hands with them and just take your position in Christ to where [music] God has called you. Can be hard sometimes. I'd say it's probably hard every time when you have to separate, make decisions, but you have to do it to take your position [music] in Christ. Notice how it doesn't work uh community is not working externally to where if we could just get all the parameters right and then be adopted into that then we'll have the sense and feeling of it. But sometimes the only way that you could really become a part of something is [music] when inside of you you get you joined to something greater that Christ the word means more to me than it's ever meant before. [music] and and by necessity I have to take to take my stand. I'm going to have to separate from things that are dear to me. He says, "But what is God doing transforming you from what you were?" He says, "MAYBE YOU'RE A SON OR DAUGHTER OR WHATEVER from a ve lovely family." He says he places you somewhere, but it's his way of doing it by the renewing of your mind to obey the word of God regardless of what the price [music] is. In Acts chapter 5, it says they held back some of the price. So, it puts us in view of this. Regardless of what the price is, I'm willing to pay [music] the price to obey the word of God regardless of what it costs. regardless of what happens. So, you may be a son or daughter in a lovely family. You may have be part of something very, very beautiful, but God WANTS TO PLACE YOU SOMEWHERE else to be made the hardest decision you've ever made. But it's God's way of [music] transforming us. If we want all things common, [music] then Christ has to be everything. &gt;&gt; If we're going to have everything in common, if we could use that phrase that Christ needs [music] to be everything, commonly to us. Let's stand. Our gracious heavenly father, [snorts] you know better than I, Lord, what it is you're dealing with in people's hearts. And when I look out upon a congregation with visitors and maybe newcomers [music] and different mixture of families and identities and truly Lord, you know what's in the heart of the believer, the listener today. And Lord, I'm not pointing to a church. I can join my words with brother Brad. I'm not for [music] one moment. Is our vision or our goal to just start a church and gain followers? But our desire is to see that a real relationship would be established between you and the believer where they're fed by your [music] word and led by your spirit. And Lord, it can be difficult. I say it can be often it is and most likely very difficult to follow your will because it's contrary to the flesh. Sometimes we have to separate from things that are very dear to us. It may not be a family member. It could be a job. It could be a a possession. It could be things that we enjoy. But you call us to do it, to take our [music] stand. And Lord, I I believe that instead of just looking at [music] those things we're asked to give up, we just need to look at what we stand [music] to gain that I may win Christ. The excellency of the knowledge of Christ. When we get so hyperfocused on, I'm going to lose this. I'm going to lose that, I'm going to lose this, I'm going to lose that. Then we haven't truly considered what we stand to gain and then we lose the fear of what we'll miss out on and actually gain the faith of what is ours. [music] To believe for restoration and family. To believe that you'll provide all our needs. that you will be a father to [music] the fatherless, a husband to the widow. That we have nothing to fear in you. I can do all things through Christ. That our sufficiency is in Christ. For your grace is sufficient for us. Lord, bless the people today as there's things that we wrestle out here in the new year. Lord, we passed quitter [music] Saturday. By the second Saturday of the year, resolutions are broken and they've most people have quit and given up. But Lord, I'm not giving up on your promises. I want to sell out to them more than I ever have before. I want to believe your word with everything that that's in me. And Lord, may we fall in love with your word. May it have a greater [music] impact in our lives than it ever has before. Commit ourselves to you now, Lord, in the name of [music] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
