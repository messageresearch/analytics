[0:00] And it's it being an Easter Sunday, we
[0:03] just feel uh compelled to minister along
[0:05] the lines of the resurrection. And I
[0:07] find for myself that uh I enjoy visiting
[0:10] these themes uh at this time because
[0:13] there's so much that's represented in
[0:15] this, not just from uh historical
[0:18] standpoint and something that took place
[0:19] many, many years ago, but in light of
[0:21] what God's doing today, what I trust
[0:23] he's done in each one of your lives
[0:25] being resurrected from sin and death.
[0:28] Matthew chap 27 verse 57. When the
[0:31] evening was come, and so we realize that
[0:33] we're following the death of Jesus
[0:36] Christ on the cross. When the evening
[0:37] was come, there came a rich man of Arya
[0:40] named Joseph, who also himself was
[0:42] Jesus's disciple. He went to Pilate and
[0:45] begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate
[0:49] commanded the body to be delivered. When
[0:51] Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it
[0:53] in a clean linen cloth and laid it in
[0:56] his own new tomb which he had hewned out
[0:59] in the rock. And he rolled a great stone
[1:01] to the door of the supplr and departed.
[1:03] And there was Mary Magdalene and the
[1:06] other Mary sitting over against the
[1:08] supplr. There on that evening, he's
[1:11] buried behind a stone and laid in a
[1:14] tomb. If we could just pray again. Our
[1:16] heavenly father, as we look into your
[1:17] word, we're desiring that it be
[1:19] quickened to us that it would mean
[1:21] something more to us than just a story.
[1:24] Even seeing ourselves in this, Lord,
[1:26] wanting to see you better, your heart.
[1:28] So, help us with this subject matter,
[1:30] Lord, as you've dealt with me in a
[1:32] unique way, in a particular way along a
[1:34] theme that we've been covering for some
[1:35] time. I just pray that it would be uh
[1:37] beneficial, a great benefit spiritually
[1:40] and even practical for those that are
[1:41] gathered here today. We ask this in the
[1:43] name of Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.
[1:46] You can be
[1:52] seated. My title is artificial
[1:56] resurrections. And in looking at this, I
[1:59] trust that you can just even begin to
[2:01] gather some themes from uh the title
[2:03] slide, but artificial resurrections. And
[2:06] I'm going to start just by giving kind
[2:08] of the the Oxford English dictionary
[2:11] definitions at the start. Kind of wet
[2:12] your appetite a little bit, maybe nudge
[2:14] you in the direction that we want to go.
[2:16] But artificial actually is a combination
[2:19] of two things. Art and and to make. So
[2:22] it's of or belonging to art. Art and to
[2:25] make together uh means artificial. And
[2:28] that means that it's even in that sense
[2:30] you can say well God didn't create it if
[2:31] it's artificial. But to be artificial is
[2:34] made by man, contrived by human skill,
[2:36] which art is related to skill and the
[2:38] skill in doing something. Uh to be
[2:40] artificial, it's made or uh put together
[2:44] by human labor. Uh one thing I came
[2:46] across I thought was interesting is
[2:47] there's an artificial day. And an
[2:49] artificial day is from sunrise to
[2:51] sunset. And you may think, well, how can
[2:53] that be artificial? Well, the day is 24
[2:56] hours. We create a day and we have a day
[2:58] or daytime that we've created and it's
[3:00] called artificial day. So artificial
[3:03] means anything that's made as an
[3:05] imitation of something else or as a
[3:06] substitute for what is natural. We could
[3:09] say something fictitious or assumed or
[3:10] something that's not genuine. Artificial
[3:13] light, artificial teeth, which some of
[3:16] us may have also artificial flowers,
[3:18] artificial sweeteners, that may be the
[3:19] most important one in our lives. And
[3:21] those things are not real or genuine or
[3:24] natural. Uh but they are artificial. And
[3:27] resurrection, that's an easy one.
[3:29] Resurrection is the rising again of
[3:31] Christ after his death and burial. A
[3:34] resurrection is a rising from the dead.
[3:36] It means to rise again. A resurrection
[3:39] is to uh to lift oneselves. Even means
[3:42] to appear again, be restored. Uh
[3:44] resurrection in the English, it's like a
[3:46] resurgence. Something is re-energized.
[3:49] It's a reviving. So artificial
[3:52] resurrections, that's what we're looking
[3:53] at is not the genuine or true. We only
[3:55] doing this because if there's a bogus,
[3:57] we know that there's a real. But in
[3:59] Matthew chap 24 24 and this is where
[4:02] we'll start and we'll launch into this.
[4:03] For there shall arise false Christ and
[4:06] false prophets and shall show great
[4:08] signs and wonders in so much that if it
[4:11] were possible they shall deceive the
[4:14] very elect. These are lying Christ or as
[4:17] the word is used pseudorist. These are
[4:19] not real Christ, genuine Christ, actual
[4:22] Christ but they're an imitation or a
[4:24] substitute for Jesus Christ. There shall
[4:27] arise false Christ. That's an artificial
[4:30] Christ. One purporting to be or claiming
[4:32] to be Christ. And they use their signs
[4:34] and wonders as evidence that they are
[4:36] indeed the genuine Christ. Someone using
[4:39] signs and wonders is not doing it to
[4:41] proclaim to you that they are in fact a
[4:43] false Christ, but it's done as a way
[4:45] that is so deceitful that had God not
[4:47] barred the elect from being deceived,
[4:49] they could fall for it to themselves. So
[4:52] these false Christ and false prophets
[4:54] that it's those pseudo and they're very
[4:57] deceptive because they appear as
[4:59] something genuine but in fact they are
[5:00] artificial. In first John 4:1 it says
[5:04] beloved believe not every spirit but try
[5:05] the spirits whether they are of God
[5:08] because many false prophets are gone out
[5:10] into the world. False prophets are
[5:12] already at work within the church. What
[5:14] are they preaching? They preaching a
[5:15] false gospel or a distorted gospel. As
[5:18] Paul puts it this way in 2 Corinthiansap
[5:20] 11:4, for if he that cometh preacheth
[5:23] another Jesus, he says, "In another
[5:25] place, another gospel." He says, "Which
[5:27] is not another." There's only one
[5:29] gospel. There's only one way uh to the
[5:31] father. That's through Jesus Christ. But
[5:33] if one comes preaching another Jesus
[5:35] whom we have not preached, or if you
[5:37] receive another spirit which you have
[5:38] not received, or another gospel which
[5:40] you have not accepted, you might well
[5:42] bear with him. So there can be another
[5:45] Jesus, another spirit, another gospel
[5:48] and these would not be genuine or true
[5:50] gospels or spirits but artificial in the
[5:52] sense that they are an intim imitation
[5:54] of or a false representation for the
[5:58] genuine. And Paul is here writing that
[6:00] he's concerned that being beguiled away
[6:03] from the the singleness of Christ, the
[6:05] uniqueness of Christ, the simplicity of
[6:06] Christ, uh it by bearing with this
[6:09] another Jesus that has been defined or
[6:11] been preached, another spirit or gospel
[6:13] that has been presented. So he say don't
[6:15] entertain the artificial. I I'm I'm
[6:18] concerned that you might bear with him.
[6:20] Don't entertain artificial Christs. So
[6:23] we know then from scripture that there
[6:25] are false anointings that there are
[6:28] false Christ and there are false
[6:32] representations. Artificial is what the
[6:34] word I'm using in that. Then in Acts
[6:36] chapter 17:es 2 and 3 and in each one of
[6:40] these readings you can go back and read
[6:42] for just a little bit larger context and
[6:44] I believe it'll be helpful. And Paul as
[6:46] his manner was went in unto them. This
[6:48] is to the Jews uh here in this region.
[6:51] And the three Sabbath days reasoned with
[6:53] them out of the scriptures opening and
[6:56] alleging that Christ must needs have
[6:59] suffered the Messiah because to them the
[7:01] Messiah was not one that was going to be
[7:02] sacrificial. They didn't believe that
[7:03] the Messiah would have to die, let alone
[7:06] uh you know come in the manner that he
[7:07] did. But that was a real stumbling block
[7:09] to them that Christ the Messiah must
[7:12] have suffered and risen again from the
[7:14] dead. So he could show them from
[7:16] scripture, not so much that Jesus was
[7:19] that one, but that the Messiah was to
[7:22] die, uh, suffer, and rise again,
[7:24] resurrect. And he says, "And that this
[7:26] Jesus whom I preach unto you is that
[7:29] Christ." So he could show from scripture
[7:31] that the Messiah was to come. He was to
[7:33] come as a sacrificial lamb. That he was
[7:35] to die and not just remain in a grave,
[7:37] but he would be resurrected. and that
[7:39] Jesus of Nazareth who had come and the
[7:41] one that he was preaching he is that
[7:45] Messiah. So there there is a genuine
[7:48] true Christ that genuine true Christ was
[7:51] resurrected on that third day. And so an
[7:54] artificial resurrection is a replication
[7:57] of the resurrection but not the
[7:59] fulfillment of the word. Something that
[8:02] purports to be this resurrected Christ
[8:04] but yet it doesn't line up with God's
[8:06] promise. Yeah. Now, if we'll pick up in
[8:09] our text where we were reading, we found
[8:10] where Joseph had begged the body of
[8:13] Jesus after after his death. Last year,
[8:16] we ministered on these very same
[8:18] scriptures. And we'll walk through it
[8:20] again, just bringing it out from a a
[8:22] little bit different detail. In Matthew
[8:24] chapter uh 27, and we'll start with
[8:27] verse 62, read to verse 66. Now the next
[8:30] day that followed the day of the
[8:32] preparation, the chief priests and
[8:34] Pharisees came together unto Pilate,
[8:36] saying, "Sir, we remember that that
[8:38] deceiver said while he was yet alive,
[8:41] after 3 days I will rise again."
[8:44] Remarkable when you read this in in
[8:46] conjunction with Luke and some of the
[8:47] other stories at this time, the priest
[8:50] and Pharisees were more aware of what
[8:52] Jesus had prophesied than even his own
[8:54] disciples.
[8:56] uh because when they were told that the
[8:57] tomb was empty, they didn't believe it.
[8:59] But here the Pharisees and the priests
[9:02] are aware of this prophecy. So notice
[9:04] how they approach the word and this
[9:07] prophecy that this just see after 3 days
[9:10] I will rise again. Command therefore
[9:12] that the supplr be made sure until the
[9:15] third day lest his disciples come by
[9:18] night and steal him away and say unto
[9:20] the people he is risen from the dead.
[9:22] What forethought, what anticipation on
[9:24] their part that they they they are
[9:27] looking for the disciples to try to
[9:29] self-fulfill this prophecy. And if they
[9:32] want to steal him on the fourth day,
[9:33] they feel like they've got enough dirt
[9:34] on the on the resurrection to say,
[9:37] "Well, you know what? He said three
[9:38] days, four doesn't count." But he said,
[9:40] "Guard it till the third day so that the
[9:42] disciples cannot steal the body of
[9:44] Christ and claim that this deceivers's
[9:47] prophecy came to pass." And he says, "So
[9:49] the last error shall be worse than the
[9:52] first, that in doing this, if they are
[9:54] to create this inference or this
[9:56] appearance that there has indeed been a
[9:58] resurrection, it'll be worse than the
[10:00] ministry when it was alive." Pilate said
[10:02] to them, "You have a watch. Go your way.
[10:05] Make it as sure as you can." So they
[10:07] went and made the supplicer sure,
[10:10] sealing the stone and setting a watch. I
[10:13] would argue that these are the contrived
[10:16] efforts of men. that what they're trying
[10:18] to do is they're trying to stop the
[10:20] disciples from stealing the body and in
[10:22] stealing the body create what they would
[10:25] claim to be an artificial resurrection.
[10:28] So catch this. The scribes, the
[10:29] Pharisees, the priests and Pharisees
[10:31] here come to Pilate. Pilate seems to
[10:33] share the same concern that there would
[10:35] be an artificial resurrection in that
[10:37] the disciples instilling the body would
[10:40] create this self-fulfilling prophecy.
[10:43] Jesus had said in Luke 9:22, "The Son of
[10:46] Man must suffer many things and be
[10:48] rejected of the elders and chief priests
[10:50] and scribes and be slain." He was pretty
[10:52] plain about it and be raised the third
[10:55] day. Now, isn't it remarkable that the
[10:58] priest did exactly as he said he would
[11:00] do in Luke 9? And maybe now they
[11:02] realize, well, we did exactly what he
[11:04] said we would do. the only way that we
[11:06] can cover ourselves to be sure he's not
[11:07] the body's not stolen to make it look
[11:09] like this is exactly what's come to
[11:11] pass. It's quite a quite quite a
[11:14] interesting uh flow of events and the
[11:17] very fact that Jesus prophesied the
[11:18] priest would kill him, but that he would
[11:21] be raised on the third day. And now the
[11:23] same priest that fulfilled that part of
[11:24] the prophecy are wanting to make sure
[11:26] there's no resurrection
[11:28] artificially. Matthew 12 38-4. Then
[11:32] certain of the scribes and the Pharisees
[11:34] answered, saying, "Master, we would see
[11:36] a sign from thee." This is what their
[11:38] appetite is always for, is that sign.
[11:40] But he answered and said to them, "An
[11:41] evil and adulterous generation seeketh
[11:43] after a sign, and there shall be no sign
[11:46] given to it, but the sign of the prophet
[11:49] Jonas or Jonah. For as Jonah was three
[11:52] days and three nights in the whale's
[11:53] belly, so shall the Son of Man be three
[11:56] days and three nights in the heart of
[11:59] the earth.
[12:02] Now in looking at this I I want you to
[12:04] look at it in this standpoint. Christ is
[12:06] clearly prophesying that he would be
[12:09] resurrected on that third day. So they
[12:11] have already oriented themselves to this
[12:13] promise recognizing that just as in
[12:16] answering us he said and implied that he
[12:19] would be in the earth for three days and
[12:21] be resurrected. We having killed them.
[12:25] They're looking at this and say, or
[12:27] they're so worried about something
[12:29] happening that's fake or false.
[12:32] Listen to this. So worried about the
[12:34] false that they never consider the
[12:36] possibility of a genuine resurrection.
[12:39] They never stopped to say, "Whoa, wait a
[12:40] minute. These hands have killed them and
[12:42] put them in that very grave just like he
[12:45] said." and they're more worried about
[12:47] stopping something that they are afraid
[12:49] of causing problems than they are of the
[12:51] possibility of considering the fact that
[12:54] could he indeed raise on that third day.
[12:57] Wow. So they threw their efforts into
[12:59] stomping something that they considered
[13:01] to be or would be a fabrication,
[13:04] something false like, oh, if if they are
[13:06] able to steal the body, that's going to
[13:07] be worse than when his ministry was here
[13:09] on
[13:10] earth. In Acts 5
[13:14] 34-39, this is an the attitude of Galia
[13:17] as we've read of him before, you're
[13:19] familiar with him. Uh they're contending
[13:21] about the disciples and what they're
[13:23] doing and how they're going and creating
[13:25] quite a stir. It says, "There stood
[13:26] there one in the council a Pharisee
[13:29] named Galia, a doctor of the law, had in
[13:33] reputation among all the people, and
[13:35] commanded to put the apostles forth a
[13:37] little space." He's saying, "Relax a
[13:39] little bit. Give them a give them a
[13:41] break." And he said to them, "Ye men of
[13:42] Israel, take heed to yourselves what you
[13:45] intend to do as touching these men." So,
[13:48] here's some wisdom. He's saying, "Hold
[13:49] on. Pause. Don't don't keep uh pressing
[13:53] this issue." And notice what he points
[13:55] out to. For before these days rose up
[13:58] Theodus, this is one that rose up on the
[14:00] scene boasting himself to be somebody to
[14:03] whom a number of men about 400 joined
[14:05] themselves who was slain. And all as
[14:07] many as obeyed him were scattered and
[14:09] brought to not. After this man rose up,
[14:12] Judas of Galilee in the days of the
[14:13] taxing and drew away much people after
[14:16] him. He also perished, and all even as
[14:18] many as obeyed him were dispersed. He's
[14:21] looking at this trend. Whenever there's
[14:23] something that raises up, a reviving,
[14:24] something that comes up, and if there's
[14:26] nothing to it, it eventually dissipates.
[14:29] Rose up Theodus, rose up Judas. He says,
[14:31] "Now I say unto you, refrain from these
[14:33] men and let them alone. For if this
[14:36] council or this work be of men, if it's
[14:40] artificial, it will come to not. But if
[14:43] it be of God, you cannot overthrow it."
[14:46] Amen. It's been a theme we've been using
[14:48] in the Exodus, looking at in the Exodus
[14:51] how it came all the way up to the
[14:52] borderline. They entered, they fought,
[14:54] and there was this group that settled on
[14:55] the wrong side of the promise. They too
[14:57] are overthrown in the wilderness. You
[14:59] cannot overthrow it less happily you be
[15:01] found even to fight against God.
[15:07] Galia looked at the examples in
[15:09] scripture, understood the wisdom of God
[15:11] or examples in history and recognized
[15:13] that if it's artificial, it'll come to
[15:15] nothing. But the genuine cannot be
[15:18] stopped. So if this is false, if this is
[15:20] fake, let it run its course. It'll
[15:23] eventually mutate into something else or
[15:25] just disappear. But the carnally-minded
[15:28] priests and Pharisees wanted to prevent
[15:31] what would be in their eyes a false
[15:34] resurrection. the efforts of the
[15:36] disciples to sneak to the tomb and steal
[15:39] the body of Christ away and in doing so
[15:41] create this inference that oh see just
[15:43] as he said he was killed by the priest
[15:45] and he rose on the third
[15:48] morning and Galia is saying well why
[15:51] fight why fight so hard against it if he
[15:53] said it would hap if if it's nothing if
[15:55] it's fake it'll come to nothing if it's
[15:57] real you don't want to be f found
[15:59] fighting against
[16:00] it in Matthew chap 28:es 2-7
[16:05] Seven. This is after the tomb has been
[16:08] sealed. There's guard setting watch. On
[16:11] that resurrection morning, on that third
[16:13] day, according to the prophecy, and
[16:14] behold, there was a great earthquake.
[16:16] For the angel Lord, descended from
[16:18] heaven, and came and rolled back the
[16:20] stone from the door, and sat upon it.
[16:23] Now, we're looking at these elements of
[16:26] an angel sitting upon a stone. His
[16:27] countenance was like lightning, his
[16:28] raignment white as snow. And for fear of
[16:31] him, the keepers did shake. souls that
[16:33] were set at watch and became as dead
[16:35] men. They're paralyzed. They're unable
[16:37] to move. And the angel answered and said
[16:39] unto the women, "Fear not ye them having
[16:42] come to that supplicer that morning. For
[16:44] I know that ye seek Jesus which was
[16:47] crucified. He is not here for he is
[16:50] risen as he said." Just as he said he is
[16:53] risen. Come see the place where the Lord
[16:55] lay. Now what happens is there's an
[16:58] earthquake. The stones rolled away. We
[16:59] see an image. No one is there visually
[17:01] witnessing. There's not a closed circuit
[17:04] TV camera in there where they're able to
[17:06] see this transformation in Christ
[17:08] raising from the dead, but they're able
[17:10] to see these different evidences of it.
[17:12] The stone is rolled away on its own or
[17:14] maybe by natural means of the
[17:15] earthquake. There's a supernatural angel
[17:17] standing there. He declares that Christ
[17:19] is risen just as he said he would raise
[17:21] and he is not in the tomb. Come look
[17:23] inside. See where he lay and go quickly
[17:26] and tell the disciples that he is risen
[17:28] from the dead. And behold, he goeth
[17:30] before you into Galilee. There shall you
[17:32] see him, lo, I have told you. We see
[17:36] that Christ appears. Even John and Peter
[17:39] run. And Peter runs all the way in and
[17:40] he sees the linen and he sees the
[17:42] coverings. He sees everything laying to
[17:44] the side. And he knows that Christ who
[17:46] was once shrouded in those things is no
[17:48] longer there. That the tomb is in fact
[17:50] empty.
[17:53] Regardless of whether you would believe
[17:54] this or not, if the at least the details
[17:58] being told of the stone is rolled away
[17:59] and there's no body in there, we could
[18:01] say all the efforts of the priests and
[18:03] Pharisees to stop the falls could not
[18:06] prevent the body from being missing.
[18:10] Even in everything they were trying to
[18:12] do to prevent stop the steel, right? It
[18:15] wasn't just the Republicans that came up
[18:16] with it. It was Pilate and all his
[18:19] buddies there in the New Testament. stop
[18:21] the steal. Don't let them steal the body
[18:23] of Christ from the grave. And no matter
[18:26] what they did or how you'd want to look
[18:27] at it, because there's some that still
[18:28] believe and claim that the disciples in
[18:30] fact did steal the body of Jesus. But
[18:33] all their efforts to stop the false
[18:35] could not prevent the real.
[18:38] Everything they tried to do to hinder
[18:40] what they thought was false was only an
[18:43] effort to stop something that was real.
[18:47] Right. And it being beyond natural and
[18:50] unable to be opposed by seals a and
[18:53] guards, the real happened.
[18:56] And here is the aftermath in verse 11.
[18:58] Now when they were going, behold, some
[19:00] of the watch came into the city and
[19:02] showed unto the chief priest all the
[19:04] things that were done. Here they're now
[19:06] telling the priest who told him, "Watch
[19:08] it. Don't let his body disappear.
[19:10] whatever you do, keep them there for at
[19:12] least until the fourth day so that
[19:14] nothing happens and makes this thing
[19:16] more cultish than it already is. So he
[19:19] tells them, well, we there was an
[19:20] earthquake, there was an angel, the
[19:22] stone rolled, the grave was the tomb was
[19:25] empty, we were paralyzed with fear, and
[19:27] they're telling them the story. And when
[19:29] they were assembled with the elders, now
[19:30] they get together and they want to
[19:31] discuss this and had taken counsel, they
[19:34] gave large money. It always causes me
[19:37] pause. large money unto the soldiers.
[19:40] Was it one of those giant placard
[19:42] checks? You know, you hand them gave
[19:45] them large money to the soldiers,
[19:47] saying, "Say ye, his disciples came by
[19:50] night, and stole him away while he
[19:52] slept." Now, there's this to me is
[19:55] remarkable. See the tomb, put guards,
[19:58] watch for three days to stop the
[20:00] disciples from stealing the body.
[20:02] And now that the grave is empty, they
[20:04] say they paid him money to say that the
[20:07] disciples stole them away while they
[20:08] slept. And if this come to the
[20:10] governor's ears, we will persuade him.
[20:14] This is what this is this is how they
[20:16] work. I was even thinking how uh uh it
[20:19] said, "Oh, Paul, thou think it was a
[20:20] gripper said, you almost persuaded me to
[20:23] be a Christian." Persuasion is all
[20:26] that's available to the non-elect.
[20:29] But faith is if faith is available to
[20:31] the believer. So you that persuade him
[20:34] and we will secure you. We'll save you.
[20:36] If if this gets to him, we'll say, "No,
[20:38] no. This is what happened. They were
[20:39] sleeping. The disciples stole the body."
[20:40] And so they took the money and did as
[20:42] they were taught. And this saying is
[20:44] commonly reported among the Jews until
[20:46] this
[20:48] day. Jesus said he would die at the
[20:50] hands of the priest. The priest crucify
[20:52] him. The scribes, the Pharisees, they
[20:54] crucify him. and he's placed into a
[20:56] grave just as he said he would. In fear
[20:58] of Christ raising on the third day, they
[21:00] begin to they seal the tomb. They set a
[21:02] watch. They want to guard so that the
[21:04] body's not stolen.
[21:06] God intervenes over all these man-made
[21:09] efforts, resurrects the body on the
[21:11] third day. Now, in light of an empty
[21:13] tomb, they have to raise up a scarecrow
[21:17] to scare people away from the truth of
[21:19] the resurrection. This is an effort to
[21:21] obscure what really happened. Oh, yeah.
[21:24] We know that the the the grave was empty
[21:26] and there's all these stories going
[21:28] around, but the guards will tell you
[21:29] they fell asleep and while they were
[21:31] asleep, this disciples stole the
[21:33] body. This is at the heart of human
[21:36] nature and you can see in each one of
[21:37] these instances as it relates to the
[21:40] Pharisees and the the priest and even
[21:42] those that were at
[21:43] watch. It's human nature and I think all
[21:46] of us think this way whether you want to
[21:48] believe it or not. We want to produce a
[21:50] result without the actual process.
[21:53] I mean, how many of you, if you could
[21:55] just put your arms together and blink
[21:56] today and have an Easter dinner at home
[21:59] when you got there, would do it.
[22:02] You know, I didn't like the fact that I
[22:03] was scrging around for enough lump
[22:04] charcoal this morning to smoke a ham and
[22:07] realize that I didn't give myself enough
[22:08] time to go to the store and get some.
[22:10] And so now I'm just hoping it all works
[22:13] out.
[22:14] And so, yes, I believe it's human nature
[22:16] to want to have a result apart from a
[22:19] process.
[22:21] And so that you have it, if you have it
[22:23] without the actual process, it has to be
[22:26] artificial.
[22:28] It can't be real. God, even when he
[22:30] created the heavens and the earth, went
[22:32] through a process.
[22:34] And so it would be uh you produce
[22:36] something says, "Oh, look what I made."
[22:38] Well, you didn't actually make it. It
[22:39] looks like you made it. So it's a false
[22:41] impression or this false image. And the
[22:44] Pharisees and the priests assumed that
[22:48] the disciples would want to create the
[22:51] appearance of a resurrection. Feel like
[22:53] I've gotten your attention and you're
[22:55] you're all trying to figure out where in
[22:56] the world am I going and am I going to
[22:57] be able to see that very electric slide
[22:59] again from the
[23:01] beginning. But they wanted to create
[23:04] this appearance that he had been
[23:06] resurrected.
[23:08] Something artificial. Now I think about
[23:10] this and I especially want the young
[23:11] people to think about the tools that are
[23:13] available to them and we were talking
[23:15] about in one of our recent youth
[23:16] meetings on this final frontier and
[23:18] where this battle is now for young
[23:20] people today and I'll put it in this
[23:22] context. Brother Mikey, you can remember
[23:23] some of this. We fellowship on it that
[23:25] AI can create art, right? Absolutely.
[23:29] Create art. The things it could create.
[23:30] I wanted just to share some of the
[23:31] things I had created this past week.
[23:34] Thinking, "Wow, this is really neat. I
[23:36] could create myself into a bobblehead
[23:38] in just a matter of minutes." And my
[23:41] brother found out that if you want to
[23:42] get them made, you need to get a a
[23:44] minimum run of 5,000. And so I started a
[23:47] GoFundMe. Your Christmas gift could be
[23:49] me as a bobblehead.
[23:52] We just need to grow our church. 5,000.
[23:54] I got 5,000 of these to give
[23:57] away. And so AI can produce art, but
[24:01] it's not the same creative
[24:03] process of someone who paints art. Like
[24:06] Sister Newammy gave me a a work of art
[24:08] for my birthday. Now I could ask some
[24:12] engine to create the same picture but
[24:15] it's it's entirely different from that
[24:18] creative process of one making genuine
[24:21] art
[24:23] to create a novel to write a book to to
[24:26] make a painting an artist will make
[24:28] fundamental choices that are foreign and
[24:31] that would be fundamentally foreign to
[24:33] AI
[24:34] doesn't think the same way if I want to
[24:36] write a book I'm going to think very
[24:37] differently and produce a book that AI I
[24:40] may be able to replicate or get close
[24:41] to, but it's completely different.
[24:45] Brother Bradam says this in Abraham's
[24:46] covenant confirmed. Anything that's
[24:48] hybrid is polluted. Wow. And religion
[24:51] that's hybrid from this Bible into
[24:52] organization or denomination or church
[24:54] creeds is hybrid. A hybrid produces a
[24:58] more beautiful art, more beautiful
[25:00] product.
[25:02] What is what is AI? It's a hybrid.
[25:06] It's something that is able to even
[25:08] produce artificial results that make and
[25:12] mimic something very real. He says a
[25:15] hybrid produces more beautiful art. It
[25:17] produces a more beautiful product. So, a
[25:19] hybrid is able to create something or
[25:23] make something. We got corn, hybrid
[25:25] corn, some of the best corn we've ever
[25:26] had, but it's no good. You take that
[25:29] hybrid corn and plant it back. It can't
[25:32] reproduce itself again.
[25:35] So something that is artificial may look
[25:37] better, be prettier, be more practical,
[25:40] more beautiful, whatever it might be,
[25:41] but it lacks that reproductive power. It
[25:44] lacks life in itself to produce itself.
[25:47] And that's what the real or genuine will
[25:48] do. It has the life in it to replicate
[25:53] itself. We can use tools, and again, I'm
[25:56] wanting young people to think about this
[25:57] in the sense of the things that are
[25:59] available to us. And maybe I'm trying to
[26:00] say this to help out our teachers and
[26:02] our universities and our homeschool moms
[26:04] that these tools that we might want to
[26:06] use as shortcuts are not beneficial if
[26:09] it skips the process.
[26:12] The disciples were being accused of
[26:14] wanting to create artificially the
[26:17] appearance of a resurrection.
[26:19] You can use AI tools to achieve an
[26:21] optical an optical result that mimics or
[26:25] impersonates a process that's not the
[26:28] same as the real
[26:30] thing. So achieving so you can achieve
[26:33] results with AI and say well we get
[26:35] results don't we? We produced it. But
[26:39] one of the best analogies I've ever
[26:40] heard on this subject is to use these
[26:43] tools to merely produce a result is
[26:46] like, if I can say it this way, having a
[26:48] gym membership and going to the gym to
[26:51] lift weights and bringing a
[26:54] forklift and using the forklift to lift
[26:56] the weights and leaving and saying the
[26:59] weights got
[27:01] lifted. And that's what it's like if you
[27:03] cheat and use chat GPT and all these
[27:05] other engines to produce a result
[27:06] instead of doing the work. It's like
[27:09] bringing a forklift to the gym and
[27:11] saying that you lifted weights, but
[27:13] there's actually actually no gain or
[27:15] benefit. Guess if you could drive a
[27:17] forklift into a gym, that would be an
[27:19] accomplishment, but you're not
[27:21] fulfilling your objective in the
[27:23] membership to the gym and the act of
[27:26] lifting the weights. There's something
[27:29] lost just by accomplishing it from the
[27:31] means that it wasn't originally intended
[27:33] or what it was there for. So remember
[27:36] that even though you can use things to
[27:38] seemingly get the job done or get the
[27:40] results that if it's not part of the
[27:42] process that was originally envisioned
[27:44] in the activity or the endeavor or when
[27:46] it comes to schooling then you miss the
[27:49] gain or the benefit and it's actually to
[27:51] your detriment because it's artificial.
[27:54] Look what I wrote. Look what I did. No,
[27:55] you didn't do it. You use tools to do
[27:57] it. Tools that miss the point of the
[28:01] whole exercise. Amen. But it's human
[28:04] nature to want to do that.
[28:07] And there's a way that we take that
[28:08] human nature and we begin to apply it to
[28:11] things in the word of God, thinking that
[28:12] if we can just achieve the optics of it,
[28:16] then we've done it.
[28:20] Now it's the chiefs. Chief priest, the
[28:23] chiefs. Yeah. Where's Lucas? Yeah, it's
[28:26] chiefs. They're always the ones that are
[28:28] antichrist.
[28:31] The chief
[28:33] priests, the Pharisees, the scribes, the
[28:36] Sadducees, those that desired to have
[28:38] Christ
[28:39] killed were spinning this narrative
[28:42] around
[28:43] things. Jesus says in Matthew 16 5-12,
[28:47] this may seem to be an interesting
[28:49] connection, but to me it just dovetales
[28:51] so beautifully. And when his disciples
[28:53] were come to the other side, they had
[28:54] forgotten to take bread. And Jesus said,
[28:57] now again, you'll see it in the
[28:59] narrative here in the story. This is
[29:01] after Jesus was able to take very little
[29:05] uh loaves and fish and make more. He
[29:07] says, "Take heed. There's no bread in
[29:09] the in the boat. Take heed and beware of
[29:12] the leavenven of the Pharisees and the
[29:13] Sadducees." Jesus is speaking on a
[29:17] different
[29:18] level. And they reason among themselves,
[29:21] saying, "Is it because we have taken no
[29:23] bread? How easily?" They begin to think
[29:26] carnally. And when Jesus perceived, he
[29:29] said to him, "Oh ye of little faith." So
[29:31] there's the missing element to catch
[29:33] what he's saying about the leaven of the
[29:35] Pharisees and the Sadducees. Oh ye of
[29:37] little faith. Why reason ye among
[29:39] yourselves because you have brought no
[29:40] bread? Do you not yet understand?
[29:42] Neither remember the five loaves of the
[29:44] 5000 and how many baskets you took up.
[29:46] Neither the seven loaves of the 4,000
[29:48] and how many baskets you took up. Again,
[29:51] I'd like to point this out. It kind of
[29:53] is maybe an underlying theme to this.
[29:56] these signs and wonders and
[29:58] miracles. He's he's uh reprimanding them
[30:01] for a lack of faith because him actually
[30:04] demonstrating those things
[30:06] supernaturally didn't orient them to
[30:08] faith. They're still thinking about
[30:12] bread. And how is it that your faith has
[30:14] not been excited by these miracles and
[30:16] these signs? How come you're not
[30:17] thinking deeper now? How is it you're
[30:19] still remaining in this very stagnant,
[30:21] shallow level? How is it that you do not
[30:23] understand that I spake it not to you
[30:25] concerning bread on the natural level?
[30:28] The miracles ought to have awakened you
[30:30] beyond a natural thirst and a natural
[30:32] hunger. A desire to be fed or a desire
[30:34] to be healed, a desire to be excited
[30:36] should have awakened something deeper
[30:38] inside of you.
[30:40] How is it you do not understand that you
[30:42] should be aware of the leavenven of the
[30:44] Pharisees and of the
[30:45] Sadducees, not about bread. He says,
[30:48] "Then understood they how he bade them
[30:50] not beware of the leavenven of bread,
[30:52] but of the doctrine, the teaching, the
[30:55] sayings." Amen. The the spin of the
[30:58] Pharisees and of the Sadducees.
[31:02] Christ has warned his disciples of four
[31:04] time of the leaven of the Pharisees and
[31:07] Sadducees. Levan just in our natural is
[31:10] a substance that's added to dough to
[31:11] produce
[31:12] fermentation. We were doing that this
[31:14] morning. I say we and the royal we or me
[31:16] as my my wife and I being one uh making
[31:19] rolls for our Easter dinner that I
[31:22] cannot magically make
[31:24] appear. But 11 is a it's a means of
[31:28] rising something or something being
[31:30] raised something that raises. It's a
[31:32] means of lifting, levitation, right?
[31:35] That's the
[31:36] leavenvening. Some interesting uh
[31:39] science on it in terms of that the
[31:41] foaming forth and the artificial things
[31:43] you can use and ye using yeast and the
[31:45] different substances that could be used
[31:46] in its absence. But what's being
[31:48] presented here is this idea of something
[31:51] being added to
[31:54] And in doing so, it corrupts it through
[31:56] its
[31:58] influence. Think think about this in a
[32:00] very real practical way. The levan of
[32:03] the Pharisees, the levan of the
[32:05] Sadducees is this corrupting influence
[32:07] by exciting
[32:09] fermentation. You can they can excite
[32:12] fermentation, but they can't excite
[32:13] revelation. Revelation is the
[32:16] stimulation of joy to the true believer.
[32:18] Levan is what stimulates the
[32:19] makebeliever. And they get just as
[32:21] stimulated,
[32:23] get just as foamy, right? They get just
[32:25] as excited. It seems this seemingly
[32:28] invisible power that raises up the lump.
[32:31] Paul says in 1 Corinthians chapter 5 6
[32:34] to8, "Your glory is not good. Know ye
[32:36] not that a little leaven leavenventh the
[32:38] whole lump." This corrupting influence,
[32:40] he says, "Purge out therefore the old
[32:42] leaven that you may be a new lump as ye
[32:44] are unleavened."
[32:47] So this leavening influence will pervade
[32:50] through the whole thing. So he says
[32:51] you've got to get all the leavenan out
[32:53] in the Exodus. That's that mark of
[32:55] applying the token. Get all the leavenan
[32:57] out of the home. What leavenan does is
[33:00] it it inflates the lump to make it
[33:04] appear. And I guess it gives it other
[33:06] qualities that make bread. But it it's
[33:09] it's a it's an agent that causes it to
[33:11] lift and puff up beyond its original
[33:13] shape. in that proofing as they would
[33:16] call it. Know you not that a little
[33:18] leaven leavenvens the whole lump. Purge
[33:19] out the old leaven for Christ is our
[33:21] passover. He sacrificed for us.
[33:23] Therefore let us keep the feast of this
[33:26] Passover Christ not with old leaven.
[33:30] Neither with the leaven of malice and
[33:31] wickedness but with the unleaven
[33:35] unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
[33:38] That true is that real authentic
[33:40] genuine. It's not pretending. It has the
[33:42] nature the life. It's all that
[33:44] encompasses it. It's of the unleavened
[33:46] bread of truth and sincerity, which
[33:48] means pure, authentic,
[33:52] real. It's for something to be sincere.
[33:54] There's nothing hidden or
[33:56] obscured. Sincere pottery would be that
[33:58] pottery which is not cracked at all that
[34:00] one has tried to cover over with some
[34:02] sort of cosmetic application. But you
[34:05] could examine something in the light,
[34:06] you could give it a thorough
[34:07] examination, realize this hasn't
[34:08] cracked. This hasn't uh uh broken in
[34:11] anywhere. It doesn't have any weaknesses
[34:13] to it. This is pure. This is complete.
[34:15] This is whole. Nothing added to or taken
[34:17] away. Let us keep the feast without lev
[34:22] that
[34:24] changes the bread.
[34:28] Galatians 5 7 8-9. We've covered this uh
[34:33] these readings quite a bit this year.
[34:34] You did run
[34:36] well, having started by faith. Are you
[34:38] now made perfect by the flesh?
[34:41] Who did hinder you that you should not
[34:43] obey the truth? This
[34:46] persuasion cometh not of him that
[34:48] calleth you? He who has begun a good
[34:51] work in you will finish his work through
[34:54] the same means as he started it. Faith
[34:57] in his word. This persuasion comes not
[35:00] of him that calls you. A little leaven
[35:02] leavenventh the whole lump. Beware of
[35:05] the leavenven of the scribes and the
[35:07] Pharisees and the Sadducees and the
[35:10] priests because their little levan will
[35:13] levven the whole lump. This persuasion,
[35:16] this inducement to trust, this is a
[35:18] false
[35:20] confidence because you are
[35:23] persuaded but incorrectly.
[35:26] I believe this is right. I believe this
[35:27] is help. I believe this is going to do
[35:29] something for me. It's this persuasion
[35:31] is this being induced to have
[35:33] confidence. But this lack of obedience
[35:35] to the word of God demonstrates the
[35:37] unbelief. It demonstrates this wrong
[35:39] persuasion because you did run well.
[35:42] You're running well. You're rising well,
[35:44] but you're not obeying the truth.
[35:47] A little leaven leavenven the whole
[35:52] lump. I'm going to come back to the
[35:54] resurrection scriptures here in a moment
[35:55] or to this
[35:57] resurrection.
[36:00] Now consider but just continue to just
[36:03] think a little bit on what this leaven
[36:05] is. Luke
[36:07] 12:1 in the meantime when they were
[36:10] gathered there were gathered together an
[36:12] innumerable multitude of people in so
[36:15] much that they troed upon one another he
[36:17] began to say to his disciples first of
[36:19] all beware ye of the leaven of the
[36:22] Pharisees which is
[36:26] hypocrisy. So the leavenven of the
[36:28] Pharisees is
[36:31] hypocrisy. Now let's relate it to this
[36:33] artificial
[36:34] resurrection. The Pharisees levan was
[36:37] that they fabricated this reality that
[36:40] there's an empty tomb but now they
[36:43] inject this lie into the
[36:45] story that the disciples stole the
[36:49] body and it is self-
[36:51] serving. They were worried about the
[36:54] disciples performing self uh fulfilling
[36:57] prophecy, but they warned that the
[36:59] disciples would take the body. And now
[37:00] they could point to an empty grave as
[37:02] evidence that the disciples did it.
[37:06] I I I don't think it it's necessary for
[37:08] us to think very deeply, and this isn't
[37:10] complicated, but I could understand that
[37:11] if you're not paying attention, the the
[37:13] point of this is you're going to miss
[37:15] the point. They were afraid that the
[37:17] disciples would steal the body. Now that
[37:19] the grave is empty, they can explain why
[37:21] it is. and they can say, "See, we told
[37:24] you they would do it, and in fact, they
[37:25] did it." They could point to the empty
[37:28] grave as evidence that they were right.
[37:31] But in fact, it is a line.
[37:35] It's at this point that instead of
[37:36] embracing the
[37:38] resurrection, instead of stopping and
[37:40] recognizing, wow, this is something that
[37:43] we killed him just as he said he would,
[37:44] we were afraid that the disciples would
[37:46] steal the body. Nothing in the
[37:47] narrative, the very ones we were telling
[37:49] to steal, seal the tomb and be on watch,
[37:51] nothing in this tells us that the
[37:53] disciples did it. Instead of embracing
[37:54] the resurrection, they faked it by
[37:57] explaining the way
[38:01] it was their own self-fulfilling
[38:02] prophecy in opposition to the true
[38:06] fulfillment of God's word. Mark chapter
[38:08] 8 verses 11 to 15. That's the
[38:11] phariseical levan is inject their own
[38:15] narrative into it. Now let's be careful
[38:18] that we don't do that ourselves
[38:20] that we where we see something in the
[38:22] word of God and what we want to do is
[38:23] just add something into it that just
[38:25] changes it a little bit that fits kind
[38:27] of our narrative. We could do the same
[38:29] thing with the word of God on any level
[38:30] whether it be the message or clear
[38:32] scripture where it says well let me just
[38:33] inject well I know it says that but let
[38:36] me give you all this that and the other
[38:38] to try to change it
[38:40] in Mark 8 11 to15 and the Pharisees came
[38:43] forth and begin to question him seeking
[38:45] of him a sign from heaven tempting him
[38:48] and he sighed deeply in his spirit it's
[38:51] in this way that I feel most Christlike
[38:53] at
[38:55] times but he did it in his spirit I I
[38:58] still do it to project to the
[39:02] observer. And saith, why do this
[39:04] generation seek after a sign? Remember
[39:08] the the companion scripture this. It's
[39:09] evil. It's adulterous. It's wicked. It's
[39:12] it's carnal. Verily, I say unto you,
[39:14] there shall be no sign be given unto
[39:16] this
[39:17] generation. That's a different retelling
[39:19] here, a different uh expression. And he
[39:22] left them and entered into the ship
[39:24] again, departed to the other side. And
[39:27] notice how these things are connected
[39:28] because in the other telling the sign is
[39:31] going to be the
[39:32] resurrection. And they wanted this sign.
[39:34] They're sign seekers. This is what they
[39:36] need to keep their the charade going.
[39:38] And the disciples had forgotten to take
[39:40] bread. Neither had they in the ship with
[39:41] them any more than one loaf. And he
[39:44] charged them, saying, "Take heed. Beware
[39:46] of the leavenven of the Pharisees."
[39:48] Here's a new description. And the
[39:50] leavenven of
[39:52] Herod. And in each instance, it appears
[39:54] as if these are not just a common
[39:57] leavenan, but multiple
[39:59] levvens. Not just one yeast, but
[40:02] different ways, different forms,
[40:03] different chemicals, different ways of
[40:05] causing something to artificially rise.
[40:07] It's not just levan, period. But it's
[40:09] levaven of the Sadducees, legend,
[40:10] levaven of the Pharisees, levan of
[40:13] Herod. The Pharisees levan in the
[40:15] resurrection story was to inject the lie
[40:17] that the disciples stole the body.
[40:20] In the Pharisees 11, they will raise a
[40:23] false
[40:25] Christ. That's what they'll do. They'll
[40:27] raise a false Christ. But now, think of
[40:29] this. And I I'm wanting to go more
[40:30] quickly a and and maybe just keep our
[40:33] Easter morning service a little bit
[40:35] abbreviated. But now the Pharisees levan
[40:37] or excuse me, Herod's leaven, remember,
[40:39] Herod's the one that killed John the
[40:40] Baptist. So the leaven of Herod is to
[40:43] kill the voice pointing to the true
[40:44] Christ.
[40:47] saying, and if if you're cautious, I'm
[40:49] just using it in type. Pharisees will
[40:51] raise a false Christ, a false messiah.
[40:54] Herod silences the voice of the one
[40:57] pointing to the true Messiah.
[41:00] Remember how it's human
[41:02] nature to produce a result apart from
[41:04] the real
[41:07] process. So,
[41:09] Pharisees will resurrect a false Christ.
[41:11] They'll inject a lie. Oh, the the
[41:13] resurrection that was a that was stolen.
[41:15] as a body was stolen. Herod's leaven the
[41:18] silence the forerunner silence the voice
[41:20] that points to
[41:25] Christ. I want to want to transition
[41:27] just a little bit now to start making
[41:28] this a little bit more practical for
[41:31] us. how these Pharisees in the
[41:35] resurrection wanted to tell a wanted to
[41:38] use the empty tomb as a proof that they
[41:43] were right about the disciples stealing
[41:44] the
[41:48] body. How many of you are familiar? You
[41:51] don't have to be Danish to know this
[41:53] guy, but Hans Christian Anderson and all
[41:54] his
[41:56] fables he wrote one. It was originally
[41:59] written in Danish. So the title is
[42:00] translated to it's absolutely correct or
[42:02] it's the absolute truth or there is no
[42:05] uh doubt the I think the correct
[42:07] translation as I could find it is there
[42:09] is no doubt about it as it matches their
[42:11] saying. It's a short story satirical
[42:14] fairy tale about a hen. It's a it's to
[42:17] teach how the truth can be distorted.
[42:20] Anybody familiar with this one about the
[42:22] hen that loses the feather?
[42:24] And the hymn that loses the feather
[42:26] gives an explanation as to why they lost
[42:28] the
[42:29] feather. And in telling the story, it
[42:32] spreads and grows increasingly uh
[42:35] dramatic and with each retelling to
[42:37] where it becomes this scandalous story
[42:39] of five hens who died plucking out their
[42:44] feathers. Should I invite the musicians
[42:46] to
[42:48] come? Speaking of Easter and
[42:51] eggs and the phrase that this fairy tale
[42:55] of Hans Christian Anderson, a very
[42:58] interesting figure, I'm not calling him
[43:01] brother despite his
[43:03] name. One little feather may easily grow
[43:07] into five
[43:09] hens. The phrase that I heard many many
[43:11] years ago. I, you know, tried googling
[43:13] it. Couldn't find anybody else who' ever
[43:14] heard it apparently. But find a feather,
[43:17] build a chicken.
[43:19] All you have is the feather. And having
[43:21] the feather, you assume the chicken or
[43:23] you build something a story around it.
[43:25] You It's more to it. But all you have is
[43:27] the feather. And it says this is one
[43:28] little feather can easily grow into five
[43:32] hens. I hope this doesn't sound too much
[43:34] like a a shift here, but if you've been
[43:36] following me a little bit with some of
[43:37] the breadcrumbs I've been leaving, I
[43:39] want to tell you, don't settle for the
[43:40] feather.
[43:42] Don't settle for the feather.
[43:46] Don't settle for just an empty tomb.
[43:49] Don't settle for a bloody cross or
[43:51] nails.
[43:52] Don't settle for discarded linens.
[43:56] Don't settle for all the evidences.
[43:59] And all the emotions and all the
[44:00] feelings and all the signs and all the
[44:02] wonders. The sign of the resurrection
[44:04] points us to the resurrected one.
[44:08] The sign of the Holy Ghost points us to
[44:10] the Holy Ghost himself. And if I could
[44:12] say this in you
[44:15] in Job chapter 19 24-
[44:19] 27 and Job said all that my words would
[44:22] be written a and memorialized that they
[44:25] were graven with an iron pin and led in
[44:27] the rock forever for I know that my
[44:30] redeemer liveth.
[44:32] This is not a false resurrection. This
[44:34] is not a body stolen from a grave and in
[44:36] light of his own death and the frailty
[44:38] of his own flesh. He says, "And he shall
[44:39] stand at the latter day upon the earth.
[44:41] And though my skin worms destroy this
[44:44] body, even if I am to enter into a grave
[44:47] and my body rot, yet in my flesh shall I
[44:51] see God, whom I shall see for myself,
[44:54] and mine eyes shall behold, and not
[44:56] another, though my reigns be consumed
[44:58] within me." Amen. He will not see
[45:01] another Christ. He will not see or hear
[45:04] another gospel. He will not receive
[45:06] another spirit. But he will see Christ
[45:10] for himself.
[45:13] Not another. This is this is right down
[45:16] to where we're living today. I want to
[45:18] see Christ revealed himself to me today.
[45:22] Not something artificial, not something
[45:23] contrived by man. Not something
[45:25] denominationally made up or
[45:26] organizationally constructed or anything
[45:28] that resurrects as some sort of movement
[45:30] and revival or some resurgence. That is
[45:33] absolutely not God. I want the real
[45:36] thing. Amen. Amen. As the saying goes, I
[45:39] want altars over stages. I don't want it
[45:42] to be a show. I don't want it to be a
[45:44] performance.
[45:48] And he says, "Yet in my
[45:50] flesh shall I see God.
[45:54] See God in your flesh.
[45:58] Yet in my flesh I shall see God.
[46:01] Because I recognize by recognizing
[46:03] Christ and not another, I become a
[46:05] walking resurrection.
[46:08] Where I can be a living Christ, not a
[46:10] false one. I can be evidence of a true
[46:12] resurrection, not an artificial one. I
[46:14] can be the proof of it. Amen. You are
[46:18] proving his word
[46:20] that my life is not just a repetition or
[46:23] a repeat of only signs and wonders, but
[46:25] it is in fact Christ in me. This is not
[46:28] humanly contrived. This is not an
[46:30] artificial picture. I'm not trying to
[46:32] make myself look like a Christian. I
[46:34] have Christ inside of me. Therefore, I
[46:36] am a Christian.
[46:39] In the sermon, Spiritual Amnesia, I'm
[46:42] finding so much inspiration from my own
[46:43] children as they dig into the word of
[46:45] God and they share things from the
[46:46] message of the hour and they associate
[46:48] things that they relate to in school and
[46:50] things to back to the word of God. And
[46:52] this is the one that uh my son Elliot
[46:54] shared on Friday, I believe it was, or
[46:56] Thursday. That's what's the matter with
[46:58] the church today. Remember he said
[47:00] Christianity has become like little kids
[47:02] in school trying to copy off one
[47:05] another. It's what's the matter with
[47:07] church today. That's what's the matter
[47:08] we can't have revival today. That's
[47:11] what's the matter with the people today.
[47:13] They've been so drugg over coals of
[47:15] everything. All the moves, all the
[47:18] artificial resurrections. And you go
[47:20] from this theology to that theology.
[47:23] Just notice the circuit of it. how some
[47:25] of these movements that have operated
[47:27] within what we call the ranks of the
[47:29] message are those things where they go
[47:31] from one to another to another and it's
[47:33] just new coals humanly contrived go from
[47:37] one doctrine to the next even if they
[47:39] their their main language is anti- camps
[47:42] they build their own camp which has
[47:44] become I'm going to be against whatever
[47:46] the flavor of the month is if blueberry
[47:49] cobbler's the flavor of the month I'm
[47:50] anti- blueberry cobbler change the
[47:53] flavor the next month now I'm anti anti
[47:54] this and I'm anti that and they only
[47:56] become sounding boards for things that
[47:58] they don't agree with instead of the
[48:00] truth
[48:05] drug over the coals of everything and
[48:06] every ism that could c hat catch up till
[48:09] they don't know what is right and wrong
[48:12] she cannot remember her Lord she cannot
[48:14] remember his word she cannot remember
[48:16] the promises that's what's important
[48:18] that was just what's the matter with
[48:20] Israel when Jesus come on the scene when
[48:21] the Messiah came in that day this was
[48:23] their problem. They could not remember a
[48:25] virgin shall conceive. They could not
[48:27] remember Moses said, "The Lord your God
[48:29] shall raise up a prophet like unto me."
[48:31] What's missing? Bringing it back to the
[48:33] word. They had spiritual amnesia. That's
[48:38] exactly what the church today has. We
[48:40] said, "It shall come to pass in the last
[48:42] days," or he said, "It shall come to
[48:44] pass in the last days that these things
[48:46] would take place that we see taking
[48:48] place." And the church sits just as dead
[48:50] as 12:00. Yeah. spiritual amnesia.
[48:55] All right, here we go. We're going to be
[48:56] wrapping this up here in just a moment.
[48:58] It's all going to just tie together and
[49:00] we're going to be done and like I missed
[49:03] Easter. He says, "We call ourselves
[49:05] Pentecost and cannot
[49:08] identify and cannot identify oursel in
[49:11] the word when it's preached in the power
[49:13] of the resurrection of Christ."
[49:17] He's not saying that we can't recognize
[49:21] the power of the
[49:22] resurrection. We can't identify the word
[49:25] and we can't identify ourselves in the
[49:27] word when it's preached in the power of
[49:29] the resurrection of Christ and him here
[49:32] among us performing it and doing exactly
[49:36] what he said it would do. Those are some
[49:39] key phrases here for you to think of.
[49:41] The word preached in the power of the
[49:44] resurrection of Christ, Jesus Christ
[49:47] himself amongst us performing it. Amen.
[49:52] According to his word, then watch out.
[49:54] Our denominational system has got us
[49:56] into spiritual amnesia. We are
[49:58] suffering. We don't know where we
[50:00] belong. One takes his papers from this
[50:02] church to the other church and this
[50:04] church and this ism and that ism.
[50:07] I want you to look at it in this this
[50:09] context. I'm going to use these words
[50:10] and put it In this context, I'm not
[50:12] going to try to force something that
[50:14] isn't here, but he says, "We call
[50:16] ourselves Pentecostal, but we can't
[50:18] identify ourselves. We can't identify
[50:20] the word when it's preached in the power
[50:21] of the resurrection of Christ, Jesus
[50:23] Christ among us performing
[50:26] miracles." If you take in a broader way
[50:30] the things that he's preaching,
[50:31] especially in the summer of
[50:33] 64, Pentecost was settling for the
[50:36] performance
[50:38] in not recognizing Christ in his word.
[50:40] Amen.
[50:42] Instead of embracing the resurrection,
[50:45] it gets turned into performative art.
[50:48] Where instead of recognizing Christ was
[50:51] there performing his word, they all want
[50:53] to have the same performance. They
[50:56] witness a one-man show and they want to
[50:58] be a one-man show. Brother Bam talks
[51:00] about blocking for the man that has the
[51:02] ball. They all wanted to reproduce it,
[51:05] copy it, rep replicate it. So instead of
[51:08] embracing the Christ that was present,
[51:10] they want to turn the presence of Christ
[51:12] into a performance, therefore making it
[51:15] artificial,
[51:16] producing impersonations and
[51:18] resurrection signs instead of
[51:20] demonstrating Christ's word for the day
[51:23] and age that we're living in.
[51:26] In Matthew chapter 24 verses 23-
[51:30] 28, just have a couple more scriptures
[51:33] to read. just this one. And then Psalm
[51:39] 119. Matthew chapter 24. Then if any man
[51:42] say shall say unto you, lo, here is
[51:45] Christ. I'm I'm winding this down here.
[51:47] This and then I'll read from John
[51:49] 11 here. Here's the the artificial
[51:52] Christ and the artificial signs of a
[51:55] resurrection. Artificial resurrections.
[51:57] There's only one true
[51:59] genuine
[52:01] raising. Anything else is false.
[52:06] Then if any man shall say unto you, lo,
[52:08] here is Christ, or there believe it not.
[52:10] So here's Christ. There's Christ. This
[52:12] is where Christ is. For there shall
[52:14] arise, there shall be a resurrection of
[52:17] false resurrections, artificial
[52:20] resurrections. Arise false Christ and
[52:22] false prophets, and shall show great
[52:24] signs and wonders in so much that if it
[52:25] were possible, they shall deceive the
[52:27] very elect. Behold, I've told you
[52:29] before. So he's repeating himself.
[52:31] Wherefore, if they shall say unto you,
[52:32] Behold, he's in the desert. That word
[52:34] there's wilderness. Go not forth.
[52:37] Behold, he's in the secret chambers,
[52:39] believe it
[52:40] not. For as the lightning cometh out of
[52:43] the east, and shineth even under the
[52:44] west, so shall also the coming. In Luke
[52:47] 17, it's the revealing. They're one and
[52:49] the same. Revealing the coming of the
[52:51] Son of Man be. For wheresoever the
[52:54] carcass is, there will the eagles be
[52:56] gathered together.
[53:01] We can leave verses 27 and 28 for you
[53:04] to ponder more deeply, but I want to
[53:07] just try to summarize this. They're
[53:10] saying here's a Christ and somebody else
[53:12] is saying there's a Christ. It's not one
[53:15] person say there's a Christ. There's a
[53:16] Christ. Here's a Christ. There's a
[53:17] Christ. Christ. No, he's saying here's
[53:20] one saying this is Christ. Another one
[53:22] saying this is Christ. He says don't
[53:23] believe it. When one says he's in the
[53:26] desert, that's the
[53:27] wilderness, wrong side of Jordan.
[53:31] He's in the wilderness. He says, "Don't
[53:33] believe it. He's in the secret
[53:36] chambers." In other words, it's not yet
[53:38] the time of his coming. It's not the
[53:41] season yet. Has he's still in heaven
[53:45] whom the heavens must receive until the
[53:47] time. This is still blocked up. Shut up.
[53:49] It's not the time in his secret chambers
[53:51] is to to say that the bridegroom is
[53:54] still
[53:55] hidden and he he hasn't come forth for
[53:58] that time for that
[54:00] union. The Christ here and the Christ
[54:02] there. The Christ in the desert are
[54:04] pointing to the false messiahs in the
[54:06] wilderness.
[54:08] Or to a Christ that's still yet hidden
[54:10] in heaven.
[54:13] A Christ that is only we're only seeing
[54:15] the signs and the evidence here of
[54:17] Christ. But Christ himself is not
[54:20] performing it. It's not Christ himself
[54:23] here. I I don't think this is out of
[54:25] reach and I but I and it's it's very
[54:27] very simple and I hope that you're
[54:28] catching it. We should not be settling
[54:31] for something that's artificial when
[54:33] what's been made available to you is the
[54:35] real thing. We don't need to pretend to
[54:37] be born again. You can be born again. We
[54:40] don't have to pretend that we have
[54:41] faith. You can have faith. Don't turn
[54:43] the message into performative art that
[54:45] has showing times. Right? We got to wait
[54:49] for the meetings. We got to wait for the
[54:50] Saturday night. We got to wait for a
[54:51] special time. No, Christ himself is here
[54:54] revealing himself through his word. And
[54:56] that is available to you as an intimate
[54:59] personal experience.
[55:01] The genuine proving his word.
[55:04] Brother Brandham, we read it last
[55:05] Sunday. There's got to be a place
[55:08] prepared for the word to be made
[55:09] manifest. And we're now living by the
[55:11] evidence of the new land, the son of
[55:14] man. Amen.
[55:16] Look how look at it however you want,
[55:18] but there's a land that's been opened up
[55:20] to us. A whole new field where the word
[55:22] of God is being made manifest. Not down
[55:24] in Egypt, not in denominations or in the
[55:27] world, not in the wilderness in
[55:28] denominations or church ages, but in
[55:30] this bride age where he is God's only
[55:32] provided place of worship. Amen. An
[55:35] entrance been ministered unto us in into
[55:37] his word of God, restored back out of
[55:40] all the isms and all the unbelief.
[55:42] There's a place for the word to be made
[55:44] manifest. Amen. He says, "We're living
[55:46] by the evidence of that land, the son of
[55:49] man."
[55:52] Not
[55:54] evidence in the sense that that the
[55:57] spies brought back, but the evidence
[56:00] we're in
[56:01] it. This is the time and the season
[56:03] where he's revealing
[56:07] himself. In John chapter 11, brothers,
[56:10] we'll invite you to your instruments.
[56:14] This would this should be my closing
[56:15] scripture here. Then when Jesus came and
[56:17] this is at after he heard his friend
[56:19] Lazarus was dead. He found that he had
[56:22] been laying in the grave four days
[56:27] already. Now Bethany was n under
[56:29] Jerusalem about 15 furlongs off and many
[56:31] of the Jews came to Martha and Mary to
[56:33] comfort them concerning their brother.
[56:35] Then Martha as soon as she heard that
[56:36] Jesus was coming went and met him. This
[56:40] is
[56:41] important. Must recognize ourselves.
[56:43] Lazarus even representing the the the
[56:45] dead that believed who will raise again.
[56:47] We are the living that are gathered to
[56:49] Christ. Once again the master is come
[56:52] and call it for thee. This is where we
[56:54] can see ourselves in the pattern of
[56:56] scripture. It says but Mary sat still in
[56:58] the house. Then Martha said unto Jesus,
[57:01] Lord, if thou hast been here, my brother
[57:03] had not
[57:04] died. But I know that even now
[57:06] whatsoever thou will ask of God, God
[57:08] will give it thee. And Jesus saith unto
[57:11] her, "Thy brother shall rise again. Your
[57:15] brother will
[57:17] resurrect. He will rise from the dead."
[57:19] That's what resurrection is. To be
[57:20] brought back from death into life.
[57:22] Martha said to him, "I know, this is
[57:24] confidence, that he shall rise again in
[57:26] the resurrection at the last day." And
[57:28] Jesus said unto her, "I am the
[57:31] resurrection and the
[57:33] life." There's only one resurrection.
[57:36] Amen. Anything else is an artificial
[57:38] one. That's right. That's why I just
[57:39] didn't merely call it artificial
[57:41] resurrection, but artificial
[57:43] resurrections. There's only one true
[57:45] Christ. I am the resurrection and the
[57:47] life. I am the way, the truth, the life.
[57:50] He that believeth in me, though he were
[57:52] dead, yet shall he live. There's the
[57:55] resurrection that Mary was looking,
[57:57] excuse me, Martha was looking for. And
[58:00] then he says, "And whosoever liveth and
[58:03] believeth in me shall never die.
[58:06] Believest thou this?" Amen.
[58:09] The resurrection. He is the
[58:12] resurrection. She saith unto him, "Yay,
[58:15] Lord, I believe that thou art the
[58:17] Christ, the son of the living God, which
[58:20] should come into the world."
[58:23] There's many voices in the land that
[58:26] deny that Christ has come in the
[58:29] flesh. But do you
[58:31] believe? He says, "Believest thou this?"
[58:34] Do you believe in the Christ who is to
[58:40] come? Do you believe as Job said, "In my
[58:44] flesh, I will see
[58:47] God." Time we're living in in these days
[58:50] day and age, I felt like this story just
[58:52] such a perfect context for all the
[58:54] voices, all the leaven, all the ideas,
[58:57] all the adding to and taking away. And
[59:00] we can just bring it back to this truth.
[59:02] Now, you want to argue that this one
[59:03] singular truth is this Christ or that
[59:05] Christ, you better know for yourself,
[59:08] who he is,
[59:10] and that he's here present with you to
[59:12] see you all the way through to the end.
[59:15] And all these artificial resurrections
[59:17] that are out
[59:18] there, you say, "Well, brother Aaron,
[59:20] you're sure spending a lot of time on on
[59:22] the false."
[59:24] Well, I haven't quite quantified just
[59:26] how much we've done it, but I believe
[59:28] that I have a duty to block your mind so
[59:30] far from the false. The bogus only
[59:33] declares the real. The more familiar we
[59:35] become with the real, the better
[59:36] equipped we are to identify the false.
[59:38] But don't get it in your minds that
[59:40] we're all just one big happy family. And
[59:42] the devil's not trying to soil and
[59:44] pervert and sew the leaven to try to get
[59:46] your understanding just a little
[59:48] offkilter to cause you to see things in
[59:50] a way that they don't actually exist. So
[59:53] Lord, I want to keep this feast pure. I
[59:55] want to keep out the leaven. The hypocr
[59:58] hypocrisy of the Pharisees to say
[1:00:02] knowingly say that well I know he said
[1:00:05] that we would kill him and after 3 days
[1:00:08] he would raise having killed him let's
[1:00:10] make sure the body doesn't go missing
[1:00:12] after 3 days. And when it happens to
[1:00:15] their own understanding in a way that's
[1:00:17] supernatural and the disciples
[1:00:18] themselves did not carry it out, even
[1:00:21] their actions afterwards demonstrated
[1:00:22] they had no
[1:00:24] idea. They did not in fact steal the
[1:00:26] body. Their fear, even their lack of
[1:00:28] awareness as opposed to the Pharisees
[1:00:30] who knew the prophecy of three
[1:00:34] days, the Pharisees just invent a lie
[1:00:38] around the empty tomb.
[1:00:41] And now the lies
[1:00:43] evolved because it's not going to be
[1:00:45] that the disciples stole the body, but
[1:00:47] it's 11 that wants to change the truth
[1:00:51] of the
[1:00:52] resurrection. Change the reality of
[1:00:54] Christ. Change the reality of what go
[1:00:56] what God wants to mean to you. And I
[1:00:59] hope today we can just learn more to
[1:01:00] pull away from the
[1:01:02] AI, right? And all these tools that we
[1:01:04] can use that shortcircuit the process
[1:01:06] and Lord, I'm fully invested in your
[1:01:07] process. Make me into your image. Let's
[1:01:11] stand
[1:01:12] today. Let's bow our
[1:01:17] heads. Coming
[1:01:20] back. Let's pray. Heavenly
[1:01:25] Father, Lord, we consider it a great
[1:01:27] privilege to have been gathered together
[1:01:28] with so many believers today on this
[1:01:31] Easter Sunday as we recognize every
[1:01:33] Sunday the resurrection. Today special
[1:01:37] day. It's a day of pastels. It's a day
[1:01:40] of fancy lunches. It's a day of nice
[1:01:42] clothes and look out and see so many
[1:01:44] maybe
[1:01:45] wearing coats and ties that normally
[1:01:47] wouldn't. That's a that's a real awesome
[1:01:51] part of this day. I love
[1:01:54] it, Lord. even the things it means in
[1:01:57] terms of springtime and things blooming
[1:02:01] and and Lord, we may have a a downside
[1:02:05] to it in terms of the pollen for
[1:02:07] allergies and the heat that's soon
[1:02:08] coming once we recognize it's spring.
[1:02:10] But if we can look into the word and the
[1:02:12] spiritual side of things, Lord, what
[1:02:15] hope, what great beauty, what joy, what
[1:02:20] reviving, a
[1:02:23] resurrection. Lord, there's many voices
[1:02:25] in the land saying, "Lo, Christ is still
[1:02:28] he's still in
[1:02:30] Leodysia. He's still working in these
[1:02:32] ways and doing these things
[1:02:35] and trying to bring people back to a
[1:02:37] glare of another
[1:02:38] age." Lord, there's voices yet to say,
[1:02:40] "No, Lord, Christ is here and Lord,
[1:02:42] Christ is
[1:02:43] there." Man, there's so many voices.
[1:02:45] We're not sure where to stand anymore.
[1:02:50] Lord, I
[1:02:51] could I I could even try to be so
[1:02:54] forceful to say that this is the address
[1:02:57] where Christ is right here. This zip
[1:02:59] code, this address right here, this very
[1:03:02] [Music]
[1:03:04] spot. And even if it were just
[1:03:06] hypothetically true, Lord, it wouldn't
[1:03:08] mean anything until the individual could
[1:03:10] find you for themselves.
[1:03:13] Lord, I take great comfort in knowing
[1:03:14] that you reveal yourself to individuals
[1:03:17] and that we as a church and church
[1:03:19] family and as believers, we don't need
[1:03:21] all these contrived efforts to try to
[1:03:23] make everybody look like the model
[1:03:25] message believer. Get everybody doing
[1:03:27] the same thing at the same time and
[1:03:29] everybody push and play at the same time
[1:03:31] around the world and everybody doing
[1:03:33] this and everybody doing that. Lord, we
[1:03:35] don't need all these efforts. What
[1:03:37] people need is you.
[1:03:40] And if they find you, I just say, Lord,
[1:03:41] you just have your way. May they yield
[1:03:43] themselves to you. May they obey you. If
[1:03:45] you're to lead them to do this, Lord, do
[1:03:47] it because you'll do it according to
[1:03:48] your word. If you're to cause them to
[1:03:49] look like that, Lord, you'll do it
[1:03:50] according to your word. Lord, we're at
[1:03:51] rest knowing that you will prove
[1:03:53] yourself in your believer. Amen. And
[1:03:57] this is individual in this day and hour
[1:03:58] that we're living
[1:03:59] in. There are a lot
[1:04:02] of pseudo
[1:04:05] Christrist, a lot of false
[1:04:08] prophets, a lot of artificial
[1:04:10] resurrections. In other words, a
[1:04:11] narrative of what Christ is doing today.
[1:04:14] But what's most important is what are
[1:04:15] you doing in me right now according to
[1:04:17] your word. I want to grow, Lord. I want
[1:04:20] to grow in your word. I want to grow in
[1:04:22] humility. I want to grow in my attitude
[1:04:23] towards others. I don't want to be so
[1:04:25] easily influenced by the flavor of the
[1:04:27] month. Help me, Lord. Stay true to your
[1:04:30] word. And bless your people on this
[1:04:32] resurrection Sunday. May they enjoy
[1:04:34] their time with family. Watch out over
[1:04:35] us in the week. A lot of different
[1:04:37] travel plans for some still fighting
[1:04:39] with sickness.
[1:04:40] Bless the plet family, Lord, with car
[1:04:42] trouble. The rest of the family not able
[1:04:44] to make it
[1:04:46] down. Different ones that may be sick
[1:04:48] and traveling. Brother Alfonso with a
[1:04:51] busted water mane. Lord, his property
[1:04:53] he's having to fix. Just a lot of
[1:04:54] different needs we have in our midst.
[1:04:56] But Lord, we trust you for all things.
[1:04:58] The night guards at home not feeling
[1:05:00] well. Bless brother Jeff and Sister
[1:05:01] Chris for all they give out. Lord, I
[1:05:03] could just see why they'd be so wor down
[1:05:05] to catch a cold, but bless them. heal
[1:05:06] them. For all who are present today, be
[1:05:10] our comfort. Our lives this year may not
[1:05:12] have looked like we wanted them to. Our
[1:05:14] testimony of months past may not look
[1:05:17] like we've wanted it to. Our
[1:05:19] relationships and circumstances of our
[1:05:20] lives may gone a certain way to where we
[1:05:22] doubted and we wrestled with what you
[1:05:25] wanted us to be. And maybe for a moment
[1:05:26] we had spiritual amnesia. But Lord, we
[1:05:28] just want to come back to you today,
[1:05:30] trust you, believe in you, ask for
[1:05:32] forgiveness for our sins, have another
[1:05:34] checkup today to say,
[1:05:35] "Lord, I'm going to keep following you
[1:05:38] all the way. I just want to stay in your
[1:05:40] word, Lord. Help me to overcome my
[1:05:42] weaknesses. Help me to grow one day at a
[1:05:44] time. We ask this in the name of the
[1:05:46] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
