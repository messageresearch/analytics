[0:00] Colossians chapter 3:1 I'd like to read
[0:02] to verse 17 it's lengthy but I think
[0:06] it's good to get this first part in
[0:08] these first nine verses before we get to
[0:10] verses 10 to1 17 if ye then be risen
[0:13] with Christ seek those things which are
[0:15] above where Christ sth on the right hand
[0:18] of God set your affection on things
[0:21] above not on things on the earth for ye
[0:24] are dead and your life is hid with
[0:26] Christ in God when Christ who is our
[0:29] life shall appear then shall you also
[0:32] appear with him in glory mortify
[0:35] Therefore your members which are upon
[0:36] the Earth fornication uncleanness
[0:39] inordinate affection evil concupisent
[0:42] and covetousness which is idolatry for
[0:45] which thing sake the wrath of God cometh
[0:47] on the children of disobedience in the
[0:50] which he also walked sometime when you
[0:52] lived in them but now ye also put off
[0:55] all these anger wrath malice blasphemy
[1:00] filthy communication out of your mouth
[1:02] lie not one to another seeing that you
[1:05] have put off the old man with his deeds
[1:08] and have put on the new man which is
[1:10] renewed in knowledge after the image of
[1:12] him that created him where there is
[1:15] neither Greek nor Jew circumcision nor
[1:17] uncircumcision Barbarian cyan Bond nor
[1:21] free but Christ is all and in all put on
[1:26] therefore as the elect of God holy and
[1:28] beloved bowels of mercies kindness
[1:30] humbleness of Mind meekness
[1:31] longsuffering forbearing one another and
[1:34] forgiving one another If any man have a
[1:36] quarrel against any even as Christ
[1:38] forgave you so also do ye and above all
[1:42] these put on charity which is the bond
[1:44] of perfectness and let the peace of God
[1:46] rule in your hearts to the which ye Al
[1:49] also ye are called in one body and be
[1:52] thankful let the word of Christ dwell in
[1:54] you richly in all wisdom teaching and
[1:57] admonishing one another in Psalms and
[1:59] hymns and spiritual songs singing with
[2:01] Grace in your hearts to the Lord in
[2:04] whatsoever ye do in word or deed do all
[2:07] whatsoever you do in word or deed do all
[2:10] in the name of the Lord Jesus giving
[2:11] thanks to God and the father by him amen
[2:16] you can take your seats I know that's
[2:19] lengthy there's a lot of tremendous
[2:20] principles in there that hopefully will
[2:23] come uh can stick with you even as we go
[2:26] further tonight and we'll go as have a
[2:29] lot to get to but we'll just go as far
[2:31] as the Lord would allow us to my title
[2:34] is indicated on this slide it's my
[2:37] native code might seem a little bit odd
[2:40] my native code but we're continuing our
[2:42] examination of fashion and clothing and
[2:45] actually God's attitude towards it how
[2:47] he views um our external dressing or how
[2:50] we present ourselves through our
[2:52] clothing and our jewelry our ornaments
[2:55] and kind of tie this back into to last
[2:57] Wednesday night we spoke on dress codes
[2:59] and we you're looking how that there are
[3:01] set of rules or dress code is a set of
[3:03] rules that specify a required garment or
[3:06] a required clothing uh could be just
[3:09] some customary style of dress for a
[3:11] particular occasion or for a specific
[3:13] activity or even a specific group of
[3:16] people that there's a dress code that
[3:18] they have to accommodate and we used
[3:21] code as a system of words or letters or
[3:23] figures or maybe even symbols to convey
[3:26] meaning and to identify something so a
[3:29] code is some way of identifying
[3:32] something or a code is a way of
[3:34] conveying meaning and we looked at it
[3:37] from the standpoint that how a person
[3:38] dresses or their attire forms a code
[3:42] that signifies their identity it conveys
[3:45] meaning it has some substance to it and
[3:47] I would even say that our dress is a
[3:50] language it speaks and it says something
[3:52] even before we would open our mouths so
[3:55] we looked at the scripture on Sunday we
[3:56] saw different instances where a
[3:58] particular attire is already speaking
[4:01] and calling out and conveying character
[4:04] and that one can dress in a way that
[4:06] signals and speaks and draws someone's
[4:08] attention so when we look at it from
[4:10] this standpoint of my native code or my
[4:13] native code and looking at it from the
[4:16] standpoint of a dress code and how uh
[4:19] what you wear is a language I say my
[4:21] native code because I want you to think
[4:23] of it in terms of something very
[4:24] personal something that is native to you
[4:27] therefore it's intimate it's natural
[4:29] it's some sort of inborn identity or you
[4:32] could say your native tongue or your
[4:34] native dress and I'm wanting to present
[4:36] it this way my think about for yourself
[4:38] what is your native language what is
[4:41] your native tongue what's your native
[4:42] code and specifically the way we dress
[4:46] should reflect
[4:48] our our divine origin in Christ being
[4:51] born again or our Heavenly destiny that
[4:54] place that we believe that God is
[4:55] leading us to and if you look at
[4:57] Colossians chapter 3 we'll start with
[4:59] verses 8 and N I think this is a good
[5:02] place to start cuz I'm wanting to again
[5:04] continue on the idea of the principle of
[5:08] how we dress matters to God it says but
[5:11] now ye also put off all these as it says
[5:14] that we have we're to mortify our
[5:16] members which are upon the Earth and it
[5:18] list fornication uncleanness inordinate
[5:20] affection uh and those different things
[5:23] it says for the wrath of God is revealed
[5:25] against those who do such things he says
[5:27] but now ye also put on off all these and
[5:31] here it gets really serious anger wrath
[5:34] malice blasphemy filthy communication
[5:36] out of your mouth lie not one to another
[5:39] seeing that you have put off the old man
[5:41] with his deeds so uses this language put
[5:44] off all these and it lists them and that
[5:46] word there means to lay aside or cast
[5:49] off and as or to lay apart to lay aside
[5:53] from you seeing that you have put off
[5:55] and that means to be wholly stripped off
[5:58] and it's using a lang language of taking
[6:01] something off that you were previously
[6:02] wearing so put off anger and wrath and
[6:04] Malice and filthy communication and
[6:06] blasphemy sins that you have wholly
[6:09] stripped off and completely taken off
[6:11] the old man with his deeds so Colossians
[6:14] is using a a language of taking off one
[6:17] garment or one particular form of attire
[6:21] and and it's using it as a garment
[6:23] that's reflective of your worldly origin
[6:26] why is it we would lie why is it that we
[6:28] would have wrath or mal or or even do
[6:30] these other things the Bible's
[6:32] mentioning that's all because we're
[6:33] human uh humans make mistakes humans do
[6:36] these things but having been born again
[6:38] you're to put off the old man his his
[6:41] attire his his garments and it's using a
[6:43] language of changing clothes in Acts
[6:47] 7:58 it says cast him out of the city
[6:49] and they speaking of Stephen they cast
[6:51] him out of the city and stoned him and
[6:52] the witnesses laid down their clothes at
[6:55] a young man's feet whose name was Saul
[6:58] not trying to look at the stoniness
[6:59] Steven necessarily but this phrase they
[7:01] laid down their clothes it's the same
[7:04] verb put off the old all these it's to
[7:07] lay them down and when they laid down
[7:09] their clothes it means they took
[7:10] something off and set it aside if they
[7:12] had a cloak they had a garment that
[7:14] would impede them in casting Stones they
[7:16] laid down their clothes at the feet of
[7:18] Saul so notice the language that's being
[7:21] used in Colossians 3 and I it may seem
[7:23] like man you're just really building
[7:24] this up it's very simple just want you
[7:26] to catch how the scripture is using a
[7:29] language of of changing your attire or
[7:30] your garments in the scri in the
[7:33] scriptures about putting off the old man
[7:36] then in verse 10 it says and having put
[7:38] off all these and put off the old man
[7:40] with his deeds it says and have put on
[7:44] the new man this word there to be put on
[7:46] it means to be clothed with to sink into
[7:49] as as such as clothing to put on or to
[7:52] clothe oneself I think it may even be
[7:54] just uh translated to AR raay in so
[7:57] what's it saying it's taking off an old
[7:59] garment put in on a new garment changing
[8:01] your outfit changing the way you appear
[8:03] changing the way you look now we
[8:05] recognize he's speaking spiritual things
[8:07] cuz he says put on the new man which is
[8:09] renewed in knowledge after the image of
[8:11] him that created him where there is
[8:13] neither Greek nor Jew I think this is
[8:15] very important Greek nor Jew
[8:17] circumcision nor uncircumcision
[8:19] Barbarian cyan Bond nor free but Christ
[8:23] is all and in all I I want to come back
[8:26] to that but notice Paul talking about
[8:28] taking off an old man you've you've put
[8:30] off the old man with his deeds you're
[8:32] putting on a new man and now with this
[8:34] new identity and this new origin he's
[8:36] saying there's not a Greek or Jew
[8:38] circumcision or UNC circumcision
[8:40] Barbarian cyan but he says Christ is all
[8:43] and in all so now referring to everyone
[8:46] regardless of their natural origin put
[8:49] on sink into such as clothing and be
[8:52] clothe yourself with put on therefore as
[8:55] the elect of God holy and beloved put on
[8:58] clothe yourself with bowels of mercies
[9:01] kindness humbleness of Mind meekness
[9:04] longsuffering forbearing one another and
[9:06] forgiving one another If any man have a
[9:08] quarrel against any even as Christ
[9:10] forgave you so also do ye in order to do
[9:14] these things in order to forgive in
[9:15] order to forbear you've got to take off
[9:18] the old garments of anger wrath and
[9:20] Malice and filthy communication and
[9:22] lying one to another and put on these
[9:25] garments of mercies and kindness and
[9:27] humbleness of Mind meekness and
[9:29] suffering if you're not if you're not
[9:31] wearing that attire you're not going to
[9:34] be able to perform the function you
[9:36] catching this in the scripture saying
[9:38] put off the old man with his anger and
[9:40] put on a a new man who's kind now we
[9:43] realize it's it's not that we go and we
[9:46] actually have a shirt and this is my
[9:47] Angry shirt and I I know some of us
[9:49] might have their favorite shirt and when
[9:50] you're going to go do something you got
[9:51] to put on your favorite shirt because
[9:52] you need confidence and sometimes
[9:54] fishermen have their favorite hat or you
[9:56] have your power tie that you wear to
[9:58] certain meetings and maybe things you
[10:00] like to wear when you think this really
[10:01] makes me look good well that's just an
[10:04] example maybe of what God is pointing
[10:06] out that there's a way that you can
[10:07] dress for the occasion for the
[10:09] circumstance and that you put on these
[10:11] things and in verse 14 it kind of amps
[10:13] it up a little bit and above all these
[10:15] put on clothe yourself with be arrayed
[10:18] in charity which is the bond of
[10:22] perfectness the Bible using this word to
[10:24] be clothed with kindness and mercy and
[10:27] humbleness of Mind meekness and
[10:28] longsuffering uffing and above all let
[10:30] this be your garment this Garment of
[10:33] Charity to further substantiate that
[10:36] this is the language that's used of
[10:38] taking clothes off and putting new
[10:40] clothes on Luke 12:22 he said un the
[10:43] disciples therefore I say unto you take
[10:44] no thought for your life what you shall
[10:46] eat neither for the body what you shall
[10:49] put on what you're going to clothe
[10:51] yourself with what you're going to be
[10:53] covered with in terms of garment it's
[10:55] the same thing when he says put on
[10:57] charity put on the new man put on
[10:58] therefore Mercy kindness humbleness of
[11:01] mind it's the same word that she used
[11:03] when he talks about actually clothing
[11:05] your natural body in Revelations 1:13
[11:08] seeing him in the midst of the seven
[11:09] golden candlesticks he's described as
[11:11] one like unto the son of man clothe
[11:14] that's put on clothed with a garment
[11:16] down to the foot and G about the paps
[11:18] with a golden girdle this is a a
[11:21] language in Colossians 3 of how you
[11:24] dress and Paul says it's uh where in
[11:27] this new man there is neither grief nor
[11:30] Jew and it says or Barbarian or cian in
[11:33] other words there are cultural
[11:35] differences that will exist for those
[11:37] who are born again there'll be different
[11:39] origins in terms of their ethnicity and
[11:41] they will still exist but Christ is all
[11:45] all and in all whether Barbarian
[11:48] formerly Barbarian whether cian whether
[11:51] Greek or Jew that Christ is in all of
[11:54] them and in all of them regardless of
[11:57] their uh original ethnic back background
[11:59] or cultural background we all are to put
[12:02] on the new man renewed in knowledge
[12:05] after the image of Christ and as the
[12:07] elect of God all of us regardless of
[12:10] where we live in the world there is
[12:12] something we can put on that is the same
[12:15] Mercy kindness humbleness of Mind
[12:16] meekness longsuffering and
[12:19] charity now the uh something I want you
[12:22] to essentially take away from this is
[12:25] there's a way that we may look as
[12:26] Americans and there might be a way that
[12:28] we would be modest As Americans and that
[12:31] would differ than maybe how somebody in
[12:33] Vietnam would look in their modesty and
[12:35] how they honor the Lord but you couldn't
[12:37] have an excuse that well we're Americans
[12:39] were just
[12:41] angry right we couldn't just say well
[12:43] we're Americans we're we just kind of
[12:45] have a tendency to uh to uh jealousy no
[12:50] we all of us regardless of our ethnicity
[12:53] regardless of our origin of birth we
[12:56] ought to have these characteristics that
[12:58] we clothe ourselves
[13:00] could you imagine someone being Irish
[13:02] and using that as an excuse to continue
[13:03] to get
[13:04] drunk which they say the difference
[13:06] between an Irish wedding and an Irish
[13:08] funeral is one less
[13:13] drunk and we couldn't use that as an
[13:15] excuse regardless of family history
[13:17] regardless of what our genetic
[13:19] disposition might be we are to put on
[13:22] these
[13:22] things all should dress themselves in
[13:25] this attire of Christ and saying there's
[13:28] some symbolic nature clothing they say
[13:31] well uh if you could just imagine what
[13:33] it would mean to take off an old garment
[13:35] and put on a new one Paul's saying take
[13:37] off the old man in all his deeds and put
[13:40] on a new man and so it's using this it's
[13:43] speaking that there's something symbolic
[13:46] in getting dressed to me this is very
[13:48] very important to think about these
[13:50] terms put on garments that reflect your
[13:52] new spiritual identity in Jesus
[13:56] Christ now and to take some more time
[14:00] just to look at this and I feel that
[14:02] it's important to do so with you on a
[14:03] Wednesday night being students of the
[14:05] word loving the Bible and just listening
[14:08] to the message of the hour these things
[14:09] will just connect really well and then
[14:11] you can be an effective witness to
[14:13] others to your children with uh not that
[14:16] I'm going to give you a better
[14:17] understanding but hopefully these things
[14:18] will just continue to add to your
[14:21] understanding clothing in the Bible is a
[14:24] is used as a powerful tool to create
[14:27] imagery it is something we've already
[14:29] looked at so I'll just use some familiar
[14:31] scriptures and this the wearing of a
[14:34] garment is used as a figure of speech
[14:36] we've already kind of seen this already
[14:37] put on the new man clothe yourself with
[14:40] a new man so it's used as even a figure
[14:42] of speech in Psalms 35: 26 let them be
[14:46] ashamed and brought to confusion
[14:48] together that Rejoice at my hurt some of
[14:50] you are saying I'm going to memorize
[14:52] that let them be ashamed and brought to
[14:54] confusion together that rejoice it m
[14:56] hurt let them be clothed with shame sh
[14:59] and dishonor that magnify themselves
[15:01] against me saying let them be clothed
[15:04] with shame and dishonor he's using this
[15:06] language of them being dressed with this
[15:08] defeat and failure let them be clothed
[15:12] with it let it be their attire let it be
[15:13] what they're wearing we've already seen
[15:15] in Isaiah 521 where it says put on thy
[15:17] beautiful garments that is symbolic of
[15:19] greatness how we saw in Isaiah 59:17
[15:23] where he wear garments of Vengeance that
[15:25] is symbolic of Revenge you have
[15:27] beautiful garments and you have garments
[15:29] of Vengeance they're
[15:31] symbolic we saw how in Isaiah 61:10
[15:34] there was garments of Salvation which is
[15:35] this metaphor of Victory but then also
[15:38] it's used in Psalms 1329 that the
[15:40] priests are to be clothed with
[15:41] righteousness it's a metaphor for
[15:43] justice Bible using clothing to create
[15:47] an image using it as a figurative
[15:50] language a figure of
[15:53] speech and if we look closely at a
[15:55] number of different scriptures a manner
[15:57] of dress carries this um a great
[16:00] symbolic and spiritual weight in the
[16:02] Bible it's used to signify someone's
[16:05] social standing or even their spiritual
[16:07] standing and it becomes a visual
[16:09] identification of who they are a visual
[16:11] marker of
[16:12] identity there's a number of scriptures
[16:15] we could use where clothing uh in the in
[16:18] Bible stories is telling us what their
[16:20] role of someone has or their personality
[16:22] or what's accepted one particular
[16:24] scripture in 2 Kings 25: 29 it speaks of
[16:28] this King now who had been imprisoned
[16:30] and they changed his prison garments and
[16:32] he did eat bread continually before him
[16:34] all the days of his life he was wearing
[16:37] garments that identified him as a
[16:39] prisoner this we do the same thing in
[16:41] our society today that when one goes to
[16:43] prison or Goes to Jail they put garments
[16:46] on them that identify them as a ward of
[16:48] the state they're under the control and
[16:50] the authority of the state even uniforms
[16:53] whether it be in a gel setting or even
[16:54] at school and some of them some people
[16:56] probably think they're exact same thing
[16:58] but uniforms are used to remove
[17:00] differences and if everyone's wearing
[17:02] the same thing you lose your
[17:04] individuality and you lose your
[17:06] Independence and it's for reason when
[17:08] you go to the military you get rid of
[17:09] all your personal possessions
[17:10] essentially you're going to dress a
[17:12] certain way everyone's going to have the
[17:13] same boots even give all the men the
[17:14] same haircut and everyone's to conform
[17:16] and it's for reason think of it this way
[17:19] there's a power to the way you dress
[17:20] there's a power to the way you look and
[17:22] by homogenizing everyone it takes away
[17:24] from them certain differences uh they're
[17:26] less individualistic they there's less
[17:29] Independence all through what you
[17:31] wear and here this his prison garments
[17:34] were changed in know there's garments
[17:36] that indicate
[17:37] bondage garments that indicated a person
[17:41] was subject to something else and not a
[17:44] free person we saw in Esther 6:8 that
[17:48] there was Royal apparel that Mori was
[17:50] dressed in saw in Zechariah 13:4 that
[17:53] there was a a hairy garment or a hairy
[17:55] mantle that spoke of a prophet or a
[17:57] Nazarite and Genesis 38 we saw that
[18:00] there was garments of widowhood these
[18:02] garments of
[18:03] mourning Exodus 28:2 it says Thou shalt
[18:07] make holy garments for Aaron thy brother
[18:10] for Glory and for beauty I now that I'm
[18:13] reading this I don't know why I never
[18:15] used this against my
[18:18] brothers well they probably would have
[18:19] just cut holes in my pants but make holy
[18:22] garments for Aaron thy brother for Glory
[18:25] and for beauty he reading where there's
[18:28] dozens of verses that speak to the
[18:31] clothing for the high
[18:33] priest it's not just make sure your
[18:35] ankles are covered but it's so precise
[18:37] and so detailed make holy garments for
[18:40] the high priest for what for Glory and
[18:43] Beauty we can say that clothes make a
[18:46] person and we recognize this that we
[18:48] judge people very quickly by what
[18:50] they're wearing when you go to an
[18:52] interview you dress a particular way
[18:54] sometimes even today you need to know
[18:56] the person you're meeting with and what
[18:58] their expectations are I know for myself
[19:00] as a lawyer that if I was going to meet
[19:03] uh maybe somebody else younger than me a
[19:04] client younger than me I may not have
[19:06] the pressure to wear a tie because they
[19:08] don't me expect a lawyer to but if I was
[19:11] meeting with somebody older than me they
[19:13] have an expectation wearing a suit
[19:15] wearing a tie cuz that's how a lawyer
[19:17] should dress and if you're not dressed
[19:19] the right right way or you don't
[19:20] represent yourself and present yourself
[19:22] with the way you dress the right way
[19:24] people can make judgments about
[19:27] you and so the clothes make a
[19:30] person may not mean that you can just
[19:33] put on a jersey and become a football
[19:35] player but the role in which the person
[19:37] is serving the position they have their
[19:39] standing is indicated by what they
[19:43] wear Luke chapter 15 ver 22 we're doing
[19:46] fantastic for time so uh uh if I am
[19:50] going fast I I don't mean to so thank
[19:52] you for staying with me but in the story
[19:54] of The Prodigal Son as we use that to
[19:56] identify it the son who is an heir told
[19:59] his father give me my portion I want to
[20:01] use it now he goes He spins all of it in
[20:04] riotous living and then having
[20:07] completely spent everything he owned he
[20:09] becomes a slave in a foreign
[20:12] country and he comes to himself he says
[20:15] my father has servants and uh and they
[20:17] don't beg and I'm going to go back to my
[20:19] father and when he comes back it says
[20:21] but the father said to his servants now
[20:24] think of this disobedient son who's come
[20:26] back bring forth the best robe and put
[20:30] it on him and put a ring on his hand and
[20:33] shoes on his
[20:35] feet if you could just for a moment
[20:37] allow yourself to imagine what's taking
[20:39] place this transformation of this prodal
[20:42] coming out of sin and out of rebellion
[20:44] and coming back to the father is
[20:46] represented by the father removing Any
[20:49] Garment that he had had on at the time
[20:52] of his coming back Any Garment that
[20:54] would indicate his servitude anything
[20:56] that would be a Remnant or the the
[20:58] vesage of slavery there was a a a ring
[21:01] in his ear he removed it if there was
[21:03] anything on him from this foreign
[21:05] country he removes all of it and he
[21:07] clothes him in the best robe he puts on
[21:10] a ring on his hand and shoes on his
[21:13] feet and he would have been wearing
[21:15] garments that indicated that he had
[21:17] become
[21:18] impoverished he would have been wearing
[21:20] something that indicated that he was a
[21:22] poor person that he didn't have any
[21:24] worth he didn't have any value would
[21:25] have probably been wearing a servant's
[21:27] garments if not a prison
[21:29] garment as verse 15 said he went and
[21:31] joined himself to a citizen of that
[21:34] country and he sent him into the fields
[21:36] to feed swine probably would have been
[21:39] wearing something appropriate for a
[21:41] swine
[21:42] feeder would have been wearing something
[21:44] that would have indicated that he was a
[21:46] slave to a citizen of a foreign country
[21:48] they might have had something that he
[21:50] wore that indicated to everyone else
[21:52] this person is my uh uh uh Chanel this
[21:55] is something that I own this painting
[21:58] here by Rembrant of the prodal returning
[22:00] to the father you could just see his
[22:02] tattered garments and his shoes without
[22:03] soles and he looks completely destitute
[22:07] the father says I want to wash you up I
[22:10] want to take off these old garments that
[22:11] are stained that are tattered maybe just
[22:14] some Patchwork maybe things he put
[22:16] together whatever it might have been
[22:17] these things that stink and smell of
[22:19] this foreign country and the slop of
[22:21] these Pig pins I want to take all them
[22:23] off and not just put a robe on you but
[22:25] the best robe and not just change these
[22:28] outer garments but I want to put a ring
[22:30] on your hand to signify that I have
[22:32] received you that you're my son and I
[22:34] also want to put shoes on your feet he
[22:36] was taking care to make sure that in
[22:38] every way the Eternal forgiveness and
[22:41] love of the father that was being
[22:42] projected to his son he could wear as
[22:44] garments to indicate he's been received
[22:47] back into the family he's loved he's
[22:50] mine I I I'll get rid of all these
[22:52] garments that may remind him of his past
[22:58] and so clothing is used of spiritual
[23:01] character it's
[23:03] symbolic Colossians 3 speaks to that we
[23:07] also see these other places where let
[23:09] them be clothed with shame and these
[23:11] garments of Vengeance or beauty or
[23:13] Justice or Victory it's used to speak of
[23:17] spiritual circumstance spiritual
[23:19] character it's
[23:20] symbolic now this is my simple point if
[23:24] clothing is used that much to represent
[23:26] something of spiritual character and
[23:29] symbolize something of spiritual origin
[23:31] our physical clothing does the exact
[23:33] same
[23:35] thing how else could you have garments
[23:37] of Vengeance unless there was something
[23:40] that would indicate perhaps you're
[23:43] angry how else could you put on
[23:45] beautiful garments unless there was
[23:46] something that would signify royalty and
[23:48] power otherwise it' just be like well
[23:51] this language doesn't have any meaning
[23:53] anymore if this isn't the actual truth
[23:56] that your physical garment speaks of
[23:58] something what you actually wear is
[24:01] speaking a language it's conveying
[24:05] meaning if you saw me with baseball
[24:07] spikes on and tight baseball pants and a
[24:10] baseball jersey on you would probably
[24:12] just assume for my own sanity sake that
[24:15] I was going to play
[24:17] baseball by the by virtue of what I am
[24:20] wearing so clothing will serve as a
[24:23] visual expression of one's identity
[24:25] it'll identify even one's things that
[24:28] value or even their social
[24:31] standing in this picture here on the
[24:34] right you have rembrance uh the night
[24:36] watch rather large painting as a family
[24:39] we were able to see this in the Reich
[24:41] Museum in Amsterdam it's a giant
[24:43] painting it's maybe difficult to see
[24:45] here but on on to your right these
[24:48] characters are dressed in all sorts of
[24:50] different garments that would indicate
[24:52] special status and position and it
[24:54] within the guard and ones that would
[24:56] belong to H maybe a certain group and
[24:59] others and they even see the children
[25:01] dressed in a very very fanciful way and
[25:04] just looking at them you would know
[25:05] these people are important and the
[25:08] people to the left are not the ones that
[25:10] the night watches guarding over these
[25:12] are The Potato Eaters these are just
[25:14] simple potato Farmers painted by Van go
[25:17] one of his most popular paintings and
[25:19] they're uh just in the light of an oil
[25:21] lamp and they're eating and they almost
[25:23] seem very earthy they almost seem like
[25:24] potatoes themselves and they're sitting
[25:27] there just pouring some tea and eating
[25:29] potatoes they're humble they're would be
[25:31] impoverished especially compared to this
[25:33] other social class here you have a
[25:36] painting of the a boy in blue and I kind
[25:39] of cropped it where you can't see his
[25:40] fanciful shoes uh but this is a very
[25:43] fine garment this young man is clearly
[25:47] wealthy this may look like just some
[25:49] sort of costume show but they couldn't
[25:50] afford costume shows back then I mean
[25:53] Amazon Prime by the time this service is
[25:55] over we could all be dressed like
[25:57] this for 15 bucks or if we can get it on
[26:00] team earlier that we could have 500
[26:02] people dressed for 15 bucks but now here
[26:05] this is another van go portrait of a of
[26:08] just a a young man who's not very
[26:12] wealthy a commoner just a a a potato
[26:15] farmer maybe himself and you can see it
[26:17] just even by the way they're
[26:20] dressed links are gone to the paint to
[26:22] where it would look as if the maybe the
[26:24] the man on the left is little bit dirty
[26:26] and and his clothes aren't real clean
[26:28] but you would never mistake the one on
[26:29] the right is a potato
[26:31] farmer here another I can't remember who
[26:35] painted the the nice Cavalier here but
[26:38] what are all these things trying to show
[26:40] us through his upturned mustache his hat
[26:43] his collar so nice his Sash and all
[26:46] these colors he's someone of
[26:48] importance as you would look even down
[26:50] to what he is wearing it would signify I
[26:53] I I have a horse and I have this sword
[26:55] and I have these things this is someone
[26:57] of a particular
[26:59] status whereas the man on the right is
[27:01] just an old poor man a common
[27:05] man kind of people that van go could
[27:07] afford to sit for a
[27:10] painting what are these things teaching
[27:13] us or maybe not teaching us but
[27:15] reminding us what someone
[27:17] wears tells us their social class what
[27:21] someone wears can tell us where they're
[27:22] from or what they value or maybe how
[27:24] much money we think they have in a story
[27:28] on uh Google's art and culture uh
[27:31] product or I don't know what necessarily
[27:32] you call it but in one of their stories
[27:35] they make this statement we what we wear
[27:37] is more than just material sewn together
[27:39] to protect us our clothes are a
[27:42] signifier of our identity and
[27:46] culture I do not believe that this would
[27:48] be a controversial statement to make
[27:50] what we wear is more than just material
[27:52] sewn together to protect us I find in
[27:55] the Bible that clothing was either ref
[27:58] refed in sense of uh protection from for
[28:01] warmth or protection of elements or in
[28:04] some sense of modesty or to indicate
[28:06] someone's stature and so scripturally
[28:08] these things would hold true what we
[28:09] wear is more than just material sewn
[28:11] together to cover up our elbows or to
[28:13] protect us from uh the cold but it
[28:15] signifies our
[28:17] identity signifies something about our
[28:19] culture whether it be something that is
[28:21] innate within us by birth but then also
[28:23] those environmental cult uh influences
[28:25] that shape Who We Are
[28:28] this isn't a reach I know that you're
[28:30] going to understand this and I'll just
[28:31] provide a few examples uh to
[28:33] substantiate this but the garments that
[28:35] we wear can symbolize our national
[28:37] identity can actually disclose one's
[28:40] native
[28:41] origin you could just look at these and
[28:44] know by what they're wearing that
[28:47] they're they are from two different
[28:48] cultures you may be looking at say from
[28:50] here but there I can't even tell what
[28:52] I'm looking at and you may not even be
[28:55] able to identify if the woman on the
[28:57] right is is Native American if it's
[28:59] Navajo if the one on the left is from
[29:01] Eastern Europe and you may not be able
[29:02] to identify it yourself just looking but
[29:05] for those who
[29:06] know they could look at this and say oh
[29:08] clearly I I know what that is this is an
[29:11] important symbol to this culture someone
[29:14] who uh maybe has this is familiar with
[29:17] this dress they look at say oh I know
[29:18] right away that that's from this
[29:20] particular region this part of the part
[29:22] of a country the same for
[29:24] these you may say they're all the same
[29:26] there's a blouse there's a hat this
[29:28] there there there's this a girdle
[29:30] there's an apron they may all look the
[29:31] same but to someone with perception or
[29:33] someone with knowledge and say these are
[29:35] entirely different
[29:37] cultures and it's all signified by how
[29:39] someone dresses I think the one on the
[29:42] right is not you know anatomically
[29:45] correct it's don't know of a woman with
[29:48] four arms but this the the native Garb
[29:52] this is a very faint uh famous painting
[29:54] or fainting if you're losing time but
[29:56] it's a very famous painting that someone
[29:58] recognize these are garments that are
[30:00] particular to someone in India or Hindi
[30:03] religion they say this is something that
[30:04] would signify something special may see
[30:07] uh a a dress on the left someone who
[30:09] knows these things with say I know
[30:10] exactly what that is I know what region
[30:12] that's from and we can certainly get
[30:14] lost in the Weeds on all the different
[30:16] dresses and all the different ways that
[30:17] people could dress and all the different
[30:19] pieces of art that convey it but what I
[30:20] want you to recognize is just the way
[30:22] someone dresses can tell you whether or
[30:25] not they're from Japan or at least
[30:27] trying to convey them they are or
[30:29] whether they not they're from a Nordic
[30:31] country just by the way that they
[30:34] dress the manner of dress can be
[30:36] reflective of in each one of these
[30:38] instances the type of work that the
[30:40] women were expected to perform we could
[30:42] show you many more in terms of men how
[30:44] they dress that it would identify maybe
[30:47] their daily
[30:48] activities some of them would tell you
[30:50] about their climate you look at say oh
[30:52] it must be really cold where they live
[30:55] and it would signify perhaps their
[30:56] social status all all these things
[30:59] conveyed simply by what you
[31:02] wear and in 1 Peter 1: 13 to
[31:06] 16 if we could now just transition a
[31:09] little bit further into the
[31:12] word he says wherefore gir up the loins
[31:15] of your mind there's a reason for doing
[31:17] this be sober and hope to the end for
[31:19] the grace that is to be brought unto you
[31:20] at the revelation of Jesus Christ to gir
[31:23] up the loins of your mind is even a
[31:25] reference to some sort of adjustment to
[31:27] your clothing to GD up the loin of your
[31:30] mind as one would uh uh gird up their
[31:32] loins or gird up their robe in order to
[31:34] run and to be Fleet of foot and to not
[31:36] be hindered in their movement he's now
[31:38] using this analogy to us to Girt up the
[31:40] loins of our minds and this analogy
[31:43] continues as he says as obedient
[31:45] children not fashioning yourselves
[31:47] according to the former lust in your
[31:49] ignorance these things that we read of
[31:51] before in Colossians 3 we did them in
[31:54] our ignorance in our blindness in the
[31:56] nature of our first birth but now that
[31:59] we are born again we have a different
[32:02] fashion but as he which hath called you
[32:04] is Holy so be ye holy and all manner of
[32:07] conversation manner of Life all manner
[32:09] of
[32:10] conversation that would pertain to even
[32:12] how that you present yourself
[32:15] physically because it is written be ye
[32:17] holy for I am
[32:21] Holy these are scriptures that we've
[32:23] already examined to Great length and
[32:25] even attached to other scriptures and
[32:26] identified just how consistently we are
[32:29] called to this
[32:30] Holiness he comes back to the very same
[32:33] theme in the next chapter chapter 2:9
[32:35] but you are a chosen generation a royal
[32:37] priesthood I'm identifying these
[32:39] scriptures on the hills of showing how
[32:41] that clothing can identify someone's
[32:43] identity their social standing and even
[32:46] how garments will symbolize national
[32:48] identity or what one identifies thems
[32:51] with I don't know when St Patrick's Day
[32:54] is and that may you know put me in Bad
[32:57] Company maybe I should know this uh but
[32:59] what do people want who are Irish want
[33:01] to be identified with it or and then
[33:03] really I guess everybody does everybody
[33:06] claims to be Irish on that day but
[33:08] there's a certain way that people want
[33:09] to addess and act to signify and to show
[33:11] this is where I'm from this is my
[33:13] Heritage and here it says that we are a
[33:16] holy nation A peculiar people a unique
[33:19] people that you should show forth the
[33:21] Praises of him who have called you out
[33:23] of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light we
[33:28] have a we are of a different generation
[33:30] we are of a royal priesthood we are A
[33:32] peculiar people and he says a holy
[33:34] nation in other words we have a
[33:37] spiritual citizenship in a different
[33:39] country a different Kingdom we are of a
[33:42] different Nation it's a new
[33:44] Nativity whereas when you have and I
[33:47] know a lot of these distinctions are
[33:49] removed in terms of today's
[33:51] Commerce and the way that fashion and
[33:53] those things work a lot of these
[33:54] distinctions may be removed but there's
[33:56] still things that would ify and I guess
[33:58] where we see it the most is when you
[34:00] break the rules of cultural
[34:01] appropriation and everyone calls you out
[34:03] for doing something that you shouldn't
[34:05] be doing but there's still these ideas
[34:07] that these things belong to a particular
[34:09] identity and when you're born again you
[34:11] have a new
[34:12] Nativity you have a new divine origin
[34:16] called out of Darkness Into His
[34:17] Marvelous Light Romans chap 13: 112 13
[34:22] and 14 and that knowing the time that
[34:25] now is high time to awake out of sleep
[34:29] that means take off your pajamas put on
[34:31] some clothes it's time to work one of
[34:34] the biggest
[34:35] areas I I qualified to say this but one
[34:39] of the things I've become more aware of
[34:41] as of late is
[34:43] loungewear right if you're going to work
[34:45] from home and you're going to be at home
[34:46] find comfortable clothes and there's
[34:48] clothes that I will Lounge in at home
[34:51] but I would not be caught not even going
[34:53] out to get the mail in not that they
[34:55] look bad but they're just it's
[34:56] loungewear
[34:58] right this is what you Lounge in it's
[35:00] not shopping clothes it's not going to
[35:02] the grocery store cloth it's not going
[35:04] to the mall clothes and what is the
[35:05] world done they've turned pajamas into a
[35:07] commonly accepted attire to do
[35:13] anything but it is a mark of immaturity
[35:15] to not change to me it's a mark of
[35:18] laziness and sleepful to to to Slumber
[35:22] to remain in the garments of sleep awake
[35:24] out of sleep for now is our Salvation
[35:26] nearer than when we believed it says the
[35:28] night is far spent the day is at hand
[35:30] let us therefore take off cast off
[35:33] remove the works of darkness and let us
[35:36] put on the armor of light it's a
[35:39] language of taking off the PJs and
[35:41] putting on your work
[35:42] clothes taking off the
[35:45] loungewear and putting on the garments
[35:47] of light for work as Jesus said I must
[35:50] work while it's day this is a language
[35:52] that tells that it's a change of attire
[35:54] it's a change of gear it's a change of
[35:55] garments cast off works of d garments
[35:58] and put on Armor of light let us walk
[36:00] honestly as in the day not in rioting
[36:02] and drunkenness not in chambering and
[36:04] wanness not in strife and an envy and
[36:07] but put ye on wear as
[36:10] clothing as a garment the Lord Jesus
[36:13] Christ and make not provision for the
[36:16] flesh to fulfill the lust
[36:19] thereof we are to wear this in a
[36:22] spiritual sense and if there's this much
[36:26] emphasis in a spiritual sense of taking
[36:28] off clothing of darkness and putting on
[36:30] clothing of light then that in a
[36:33] spiritual sense can also be reflected in
[36:35] a very physical sense could we not all
[36:38] agree there's a way that we could dress
[36:40] that would signify some sort of
[36:42] Darkness he said before that there's
[36:44] people may draw lines in different areas
[36:46] but there's ways that people can dress
[36:48] way that people can act it's important
[36:50] for us to even consider whether it's a
[36:52] brother or a sister or a young person
[36:54] that the way that I'm doing my hair the
[36:55] way that I'm wearing my clothes I'm try
[36:58] am I trying to Signal am I being
[37:00] identified with something that's not
[37:02] holy because there are garments literal
[37:05] physical
[37:06] garments that are garments of
[37:09] Darkness but we're to wear Christ in a
[37:13] spiritual sense and by all means not
[37:16] cover him
[37:17] up
[37:19] physically in Matthew chapter 23:
[37:23] 27 I think the scribes and Pharisees are
[37:25] The Usual Suspects for me we find that
[37:27] they become a very good example of what
[37:29] we ought not to be he says woe and you
[37:31] scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for you
[37:34] are like undited seers why did tombs or
[37:37] tombstones uh uh which indeed appear
[37:39] beautiful outward but are within full of
[37:42] dead men's bones and of all
[37:44] uncleanness quite an interesting
[37:46] tradition that Jesus is referring to
[37:49] since in the law you would not you could
[37:51] not touch a a grave or touch bones a and
[37:55] be clean it would cause some sort of
[37:57] uncleanness and you'd have to be
[37:58] purified uh they would make sure that a
[38:01] vessel or grave or tomb was Whited and
[38:05] very bright so that people would know
[38:07] there's death in there interesting isn't
[38:10] it and Jesus now says you are like a
[38:14] whitewashed tomb on the outside you look
[38:17] beautiful but inside you're full of
[38:21] uncleanness now what I would like to do
[38:23] is just invert that I'd like to invert
[38:26] it in the sense that we our outward
[38:28] appearance should not be void of light
[38:31] should not be void of Glory should not
[38:33] be void of Purity and appear as horrible
[38:37] vessels of uncleanness but then say Oh
[38:39] but inside white as snow white as snow
[38:44] my sins have been washed white as snow
[38:46] and on the outside appear as if we are
[38:49] nothing but a a a vessel of
[38:55] Darkness we should desire that our
[38:57] outward appearance reflect God's glory
[39:00] God's holiness and the humility of
[39:02] Christ in a way that these Pharisees
[39:05] were not able to
[39:08] achieve that not only would we be
[39:10] purified inside but even the outside
[39:12] could be a good testimony of
[39:16] that in Psalms 104:
[39:24] 1-7 is everyone feeling comfortable
[39:26] tonight
[39:28] is it proceeding as normal or am I is it
[39:31] is it okay good cuz is it just me I feel
[39:33] weird with this thing on my
[39:37] ear and it's amazing just how a subtle
[39:39] difference and even the sound sounds a
[39:41] little bit different and maybe
[39:43] everyone's just really really nervous
[39:44] about where I'm going with this because
[39:47] I told you my title but you couldn't
[39:48] read
[39:49] it and everyone's wondering if there's
[39:52] some Easter egg in that well there is my
[39:54] native code it was in the colors of the
[39:56] Irish flag yeah was in a gayc kind of
[39:59] font and so yeah maybe there was an
[40:02] Easter egg in there can we move on now
[40:05] good Psalms 104: 1 to7 pay close
[40:08] attention to this this is where it gets
[40:10] fun to me this is where it really gets
[40:12] uh a little bit deeper in a very simple
[40:14] way bless the Lord oh my soul oh Lord my
[40:16] God Thou Art very great now speaking of
[40:19] God Elohim the great one Thou Art
[40:22] clothed with honor and Majesty God
[40:25] himself has clothing who coverest
[40:28] thyself with light as with a garment
[40:31] notice this description of God who is
[40:34] clothed with honor and majesty and he's
[40:36] covered himself with light as with a
[40:39] garment and now it says who stretcheth
[40:42] out the heavens like a curtain who
[40:44] layeth the beams of his Chambers in the
[40:47] waters who maketh the clouds his Chariot
[40:49] who walketh upon the wings of the wind
[40:51] who maketh his Angel Spirits his
[40:53] Ministers of flaming fire who laid the
[40:56] foundations of the earth that should not
[40:57] be removed forever thou coverst it with
[41:00] the deep as with the Garment so it
[41:02] revisits that that analogy the wat stood
[41:05] above the mountains at thy rebuke they
[41:06] fled at the voice of thy Thunder they
[41:08] hasted away if you have time continue to
[41:11] read the remainder of the chapter as it
[41:12] stays within that
[41:13] theme but as it describes God in his
[41:18] creation the one who stretched out the
[41:20] heavens like a curtain and laid the
[41:21] beams of his Chambers and the waters and
[41:23] clouds were his chariots as it describes
[41:25] God God's creation and God is the
[41:28] creator there's this parallel to God's
[41:30] appearance and God's
[41:32] clothing it says that he is thou clothed
[41:35] which means to dress or to wear to be
[41:37] fully clothed thou are clothed with
[41:39] honor this Splendor and strength you are
[41:41] clothed with Majesty there's this
[41:43] ornament of
[41:44] Glory God has described as being clothed
[41:48] it says that he has covered himself
[41:50] wrapped or enveloped himself as a
[41:52] garment a mantle or a robe God is
[41:55] dressed in strength and gor Glory he is
[41:57] fully clothed with light now think of
[42:01] this
[42:02] God is being ascribed with having
[42:05] clothed himself with honor and Majesty
[42:09] in this beautiful description he covers
[42:11] himself with light God's covering God's
[42:14] garment is this
[42:16] light in James chapter 1:1 17 every good
[42:20] and per every perfect
[42:22] gift is from above and cometh down from
[42:24] the Father of Lights
[42:27] if he fathers lights it's because God is
[42:29] light himself with whom is no
[42:31] variableness neither shadow of
[42:33] turning this is the image of God God who
[42:37] is clothed with honor and Majesty a God
[42:40] who had covered himself with light even
[42:43] the very language suggests that God
[42:45] allowed allowed his shape and form to be
[42:48] expressed that's what we say God the
[42:49] invisible God forms himself into the
[42:51] logos he has dressed himself he's
[42:53] clothed himself in a way that he could
[42:55] be presented way that you could see him
[42:58] and know his
[43:01] glory and God being in this image do you
[43:04] catch this now clothed with honor and
[43:06] Majesty covered with light as a garment
[43:08] in the beginning man was made in God's
[43:12] image God said let us make man in our
[43:15] image God clothed man in God's glory in
[43:18] God's strength he had brought forth Adam
[43:21] as a God on Earth God who was clothed
[43:24] with honor and Majesty he covered
[43:26] himself as with the guard arment of
[43:28] light it says in Genesis
[43:31] 2:25 and they were both naked the man
[43:33] and his wife and were not
[43:36] ashamed but we know being made in the
[43:39] image of God there was a holy
[43:41] image that Adam and the woman were in a
[43:43] similar way wrapped in the covering of
[43:45] Honor wrapped in this covering of
[43:48] majesty there was a there was a light
[43:51] about them they weren't dressed in the
[43:53] manner that we would understand dressed
[43:55] now and at the same time I would say
[43:57] they they weren't naked then necessarily
[44:00] in the same way that we're naked there's
[44:02] no glory and Majesty In the Flesh we
[44:04] cover ourselves as Paul says to hide
[44:06] parts that are uncomely and parts that
[44:08] are not beautiful but yet the man and
[44:10] the woman in their state they had a
[44:12] light and a garment of Glory that
[44:14] covered
[44:15] them Matthew 17:2 in the Transfiguration
[44:19] it says about Christ he was transfigured
[44:21] before them and his face did shine as
[44:23] the sun and his reignment was white as
[44:26] the light
[44:28] this is this expression this
[44:29] Transfiguration this Glory that's
[44:31] emanating from the person God clothed
[44:34] and honor in Majesty strength and Glory
[44:37] covered in light as a robe or garment
[44:40] Christ now in the Transfiguration his
[44:43] reignment is white as the light we read
[44:46] in in Colossians well I guess we didn't
[44:47] read in Colossians 1 but Colossians 1:15
[44:49] Christ was the image of the invisible
[44:52] God the firstborn of every
[44:54] creature God being the father of light
[44:58] in him there's no variableness God in
[45:00] the beginning was
[45:01] clothed with honor and majesty and he
[45:05] wore like a garment
[45:07] light so notice this as we've looked
[45:09] over this at other angles and just
[45:12] substantially uh go substantiating this
[45:14] deeper Genesis 3:7 and the eyes of them
[45:18] after the man and woman have partake of
[45:19] that which was forbidden says the eyes
[45:21] of them both were opened just as the
[45:24] serpent had told them would happen says
[45:26] and they knew knew that they were
[45:28] naked and they sewed fig leaves together
[45:31] and made themselves aprons if we could
[45:34] just use the figurative language that's
[45:35] used prior in scripture they took off
[45:38] their Garment of light they took off
[45:40] their garments of Innocence that Holy
[45:43] robe of honor and Majesty had to be
[45:45] removed God's glory had been put off
[45:48] they laid aside his Holiness think of
[45:50] the inverse of what we're to be putting
[45:52] on now and what we see in the end but
[45:54] what happens there in the garden is this
[45:55] disrobing of
[45:58] innocence and as they changed out of
[46:00] those garments and I know there might be
[46:02] this desire to think in a very physical
[46:05] sense that they actually had uh white
[46:06] garments but rather just think of how
[46:08] that they shed these things that in
[46:12] believing the light they had to remove
[46:14] this light that was about them and when
[46:16] they did it they lost their
[46:18] identification with
[46:20] God they took off something that
[46:22] identified them with
[46:24] God cuz now after they recogn iiz
[46:27] they're naked they sew fig leaves
[46:28] together and they make themselves aprons
[46:30] which is in the language is a loin cloth
[46:32] and they recognize their nakedness and
[46:34] they put something on to cover them but
[46:36] notice in verse 10 and he said I heard
[46:38] thy voice in the garden Adam when God
[46:40] said why did you hide I heard your voice
[46:42] and I was afraid because I was
[46:45] naked and I hid myself he's still naked
[46:49] even though he got
[46:55] dressed the native code had been
[46:59] corrupted and their outward nakedness
[47:01] now reflected the nakedness of their
[47:05] soul no m whatever effort they made in
[47:07] trying to hide themselves behind loin
[47:09] cloths they might have kind of felt
[47:11] guilty a and in the nature of their sin
[47:14] they they wanted to cover these parts
[47:15] and it was this identifiable shame but
[47:17] they had already taken off the garments
[47:19] of light the holy image of God had
[47:22] already left them and so no matter how
[47:25] much they tried to use this Pat work of
[47:27] leaves they still felt
[47:30] naked despite their efforts to cover
[47:33] their body they fell short of their that
[47:35] Divine dress that native dress that God
[47:38] had given them and so God had to
[47:41] properly clothe
[47:45] them I hope that you can
[47:48] see how significant these things are in
[47:51] scripture we could spend service after
[47:54] service after service using scriptures
[47:56] from the Bible that relate to clothing
[47:58] as being symbolic and then we could take
[48:01] that and we be right in saying that if
[48:03] clothes can hold symbolic meaning
[48:05] physical clothes hold meaning
[48:08] too and not just symbolic meaning but
[48:11] literal meaning very real
[48:14] meaning they're clothes of
[48:17] consequence James 1: 21 he says
[48:21] wherefore lay apart all filthiness and
[48:23] superfluity of naughtiness and receive
[48:26] with meekness the engrafted word which
[48:27] is able to save your
[48:32] souls the lay apart means take off
[48:36] filthiness as in removing a garment
[48:40] remove dishonorable
[48:42] garments take off the fashions that have
[48:45] been stained by the
[48:47] world you can say well is he is he
[48:49] speaking specifically to that not
[48:52] necessarily but he could be lay apart
[48:55] all filthiness and superfluity of
[48:57] naughtiness that means the residue or
[48:59] remains of
[49:01] naughtiness the residue or remains of
[49:03] wickedness or evil the residual remains
[49:05] of unrighteousness if God has in fact
[49:08] taken your soul and renewed it to be
[49:10] perfectly white and pure and he's
[49:12] constantly Renewing Your Mind he's
[49:14] saying then we ought to continue to lay
[49:16] aside all things that are dishonorable
[49:19] in whatever residue or remains of the
[49:21] world we ought to lay them aside
[49:24] amen and that would extend even to the
[49:27] garments that we would wear as men and
[49:29] women and
[49:31] receive with meekness this is humility
[49:34] willing to subject ourselves to it the
[49:36] engrafted word the word which has been
[49:38] implanted by Nature the inborn word if I
[49:41] could say this way the native word now
[49:44] which can make you fully
[49:47] whole that as we are told in scripture
[49:50] to take off those things that pertain to
[49:52] the old man and put on things that
[49:54] pertain to the new man as we are doing
[49:56] this in a spiritual sense there ought to
[49:58] be some literal transformation that's
[50:00] taking place in our physical
[50:04] representation as men wear their hair in
[50:07] a way that is respectful as women do the
[50:11] same and not cutting their hair in all
[50:13] the different ways that we can begin to
[50:15] describe the very specific elements of
[50:17] Holiness take time to read your Bible
[50:20] take time to search the word of God and
[50:22] find all the very precise ways that IT
[50:25] addresses holiness
[50:27] the
[50:28] native word the engrafted word which is
[50:32] able to preserve you
[50:35] completely in Colossians chap 1:
[50:39] 9-13 this being a principal foundation
[50:42] for what we read in Colossians chapter 3
[50:45] for this cause we also since the day we
[50:47] heard it do not cease to pray for you
[50:49] and to desire that you might be filled
[50:51] with the knowledge of his will and all
[50:53] wisdom and spiritual understanding
[50:56] that you might walk worthy of the Lord
[50:58] unto all pleasing being fruitful in
[51:00] every good work and increasing in the
[51:02] knowledge of God strengthened with all
[51:05] might according to his glorious power un
[51:07] all patience and longsuffering of
[51:09] joyfulness with joyfulness giving thanks
[51:12] unto the Father which hath made us meat
[51:15] to be partakers of the inheritance of
[51:17] the Saints in
[51:19] light who have delivered us from the
[51:21] power of darkness and have translated us
[51:24] into the kingdom of his de son this is
[51:28] the Kingdom of Light am this is the
[51:30] kingdom of him who is in the image of
[51:31] the invisible God this Kingdom that was
[51:34] represented is coming in power when his
[51:35] reignment was white as the light this
[51:38] Kingdom which has been established by
[51:39] the father who is the father of light
[51:41] this one who in the beginning was
[51:43] clothed with honor and majesty and
[51:45] covered himself with light as a garment
[51:48] let our garments be reflective of that
[51:51] light if we have been taken out of
[51:53] darkness and delivered from the power of
[51:55] Darkness whereas at one time we dressed
[51:57] under the power of Darkness we presented
[51:59] under the power of Darkness let us now
[52:01] who have been translated into the
[52:03] kingdom of his son be Bears of light
[52:05] even the way in the way that we
[52:09] dress that we would give care to
[52:12] that musicians as you come to your
[52:14] instruments brother bam makes this
[52:15] statement oh for your sons and daughters
[52:17] of the king the king of kings let us
[52:19] conduct our character as
[52:22] Christians we are aliens we are pilgrims
[52:24] we're strangers here this is not our
[52:27] world Amen we are seeking a kingdom that
[52:30] is to come this is not our home though
[52:33] we be tossed about and made of made fun
[52:35] of by the world and called this and the
[52:37] other and oldfashioned and all like that
[52:41] what do you
[52:43] care you do not want to be pattering
[52:45] yourself after some kind of movie star
[52:48] or some television star or something
[52:51] some influencer some YouTube
[52:54] personality some athlete amen
[52:57] right so
[52:59] model you are a daughter of God you are
[53:02] a son of God let's act like
[53:06] God we are the children of God we know
[53:09] we are Sons and Daughters of the king
[53:10] let our character reflect his presence
[53:13] no matter how rough it
[53:15] gets let our character reflect his
[53:21] presence there is a reason why God
[53:23] desires that we would dress a certain
[53:26] way
[53:28] we could run it back through and use
[53:29] pictures and as I've been going back
[53:31] through different things there's a way
[53:33] that you could show a picture of
[53:34] somebody and immediately you'd know by
[53:35] the picture what they
[53:37] are even if it was just described to you
[53:40] you say well that's a
[53:42] cowboy this person's a doctor they're a
[53:44] nurse they they do this they do that
[53:45] they work in this industry they do that
[53:47] they're a football player they're B all
[53:48] just by the way that they
[53:49] [Music]
[53:51] dress take a picture and you can look at
[53:53] somebody with bell bottoms on and a tie
[53:55] dye shirt and long long hair and a
[53:57] headband on and you'd say that's a
[53:59] hippie cuz there's a way that people
[54:01] dress and it signifies something about
[54:03] what they're looking at what they're
[54:05] modeling what they value how they how
[54:07] they want to be perceived and in the
[54:09] same way the requirements that a man not
[54:11] wear a garment pertaining to a woman and
[54:12] a woman not wearing a garment that
[54:14] pertains to a man is so that there's a
[54:15] manner of dress there's a native code
[54:18] that says I am from above I am a
[54:21] Christian and God wants us to be able to
[54:23] be identified as separate from the world
[54:27] world and it's important for us to find
[54:30] that identity for
[54:32] ourselves and I thank God that he's
[54:34] given us a word a precise word a modern
[54:37] day word a modern day message that tells
[54:39] us that there's things that the world
[54:41] may call dated in oldfashioned but
[54:43] they're still beautiful to God and there
[54:46] the way that men and women ought to be
[54:47] acted in this hour that glorifies God
[54:50] why because we're in the Kingdom of
[54:52] Light God dressed himself covered
[54:55] himself in light
[54:58] he wore garments of honor and Majesty
[55:00] Lord let my garments give you glory let
[55:03] them please
[55:05] you and may I be a bearer of your light
[55:08] reflecting he says his
[55:11] presence it's quite a calling isn't it
[55:14] let's stand to our feet tonight and just
[55:17] pray thank you for your patience
[55:19] tonight thank you once again brother Ron
[55:22] for not falling asleep on the first row
[55:24] service after service he sits here and
[55:26] he listens he's the first one to hear me
[55:30] too and I appreciate all of you who are
[55:32] here tonight your
[55:34] attentiveness such a blessing to be part
[55:36] of the family of God if we could bow our
[55:38] heads in a word of prayer I say this to
[55:41] whether it be to brother roow and my
[55:43] daughter Eliza or any other young people
[55:47] here we want our character to reflect
[55:50] his
[55:51] presence and there's an attitude there's
[55:54] a disposition there's a shamefacedness
[55:56] there a clothing of humility the
[55:57] humility of Christ that we must wear but
[56:00] then there's also this extension of that
[56:03] in our physical garments in our physical
[56:05] dress and you may clearly look like
[56:07] you're from Arizona or you're from
[56:09] America you're from Mexico there might
[56:10] be ways that we could dress that could
[56:12] signify we're European or we're from
[56:14] Africa but we all should be wearing
[56:18] Christ Christ is in all God help us to
[56:21] find that measure of you yes in the way
[56:25] that we live the way that we Dess the
[56:26] way that we act our gracious Heavenly
[56:28] Father tonight I pray that you would
[56:29] seal these things up in our
[56:31] hearts that they would not be confusing
[56:34] that they would not be outdated or
[56:36] old-fashioned but we could see from the
[56:38] scripture that as you took care when
[56:42] bringing yourself forth in a visible
[56:44] expression you gave thought to what you
[56:46] would
[56:48] wear and you dressed yourself in honor
[56:51] and majesty and you clothed yourself
[56:53] with light as a robe and as a garment
[56:55] yes Lord
[56:58] likewise Lord when you brought forth
[56:59] Adam by Your
[57:01] Word he was clothed with
[57:06] light he was in your
[57:11] image and Lord when he sinned your holy
[57:14] image left
[57:16] him he may have in that
[57:19] moment looked no
[57:21] different but his garments had changed
[57:26] and in the of the nakedness of his
[57:28] soul he quickly and performed the first
[57:31] religious work of fabricating clothing
[57:33] from fig
[57:35] leaves and dressing himself and his wife
[57:37] with loin
[57:38] claws but
[57:41] still felt naked in your
[57:45] presence so Lord you use a language in
[57:49] the New Testament that we have been
[57:50] translated out of Darkness out of
[57:52] nakedness into light yes to be dressed
[57:55] to be gted up to be
[57:59] clothed so father I pray that we too
[58:04] could in our garment in our dress
[58:07] reflect your presence not
[58:10] nakedness not shame but your
[58:14] presence because you which have called
[58:16] us You Are Holy so you've called us to
[58:19] be holy and there is a standard for our
[58:21] young women and our young men this
[58:23] standard that we ought to teach in our
[58:25] homes this standard that we we ought to
[58:26] be living at church and abroad Lord this
[58:29] standard of Holiness that today is so
[58:32] reviled so
[58:34] hated why because men and women love
[58:37] their evil
[58:38] Deeds they find comfort in the residue
[58:41] of
[58:42] naughtin not willing to be completely
[58:45] died out in your presence and accept you
[58:47] they're worried about what it might look
[58:49] like as the Wardrobe changes as their
[58:51] hair grows
[58:52] out as they become less identified with
[58:55] the world by the jokes they tell and the
[58:57] things they
[58:58] watch but Lord to the real believer that
[59:01] Spirit of the Holy Ghost Inside of them
[59:03] cries out for more light and I pray
[59:05] tonight that all that would hear my
[59:07] voice especially those that are here
[59:08] today they could receive with meekness
[59:10] this word this Divine word this native
[59:13] code
[59:14] Lord because it's theirs and let it
[59:17] begin to work inside of them to produce
[59:20] this modesty that you find so
[59:24] beautiful as we're dismiss tonight Lord
[59:26] be with us protect us watch those who've
[59:28] traveled great
[59:30] distances watch out over them Lord on I
[59:33] 17 and different paths that they may go
[59:37] Lord we love you we ask all of this in
[59:39] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
