TRANSCRIPT
========================================
matthew chapter 5 we'll start with verse 13 and we'll read to verse 16. i'm going to touch on this a little bit this morning but i realized uh that as i studied it and looked at it it just kept getting maybe more broad and i'm trying i try and try not to get pulled too deeply into the elements here to unpack them begin to unpack them but i would like to kind of touch the surface of it um in the beginning and so matthew chapter 5 verses 13 to 16. ye are the salt of the earth but if the salt have lost its savior wherewith shall it be salted it has sends forth good for nothing but to be cast out and to be trodden under foot of men ye are the light of the world a city that is set on the hill cannot be hid neither do men light a candle and put it in under a bushel but on a candle stick and it giveth light unto all that are in the house let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven amen god bless you you may be seated we had been ministering through i believe it was four different services on the bride's advocate or our advocate as believers and what i'm wanting to then transition into and i consider it still part of the same uh the same thought and the same emphasis so i'm actually gonna pick back up in first john chapter two but now i want to look at the bride's advocacy and so there were some things that we mentioned and preached on the advocate how we saw how christ advocated and how he prayed and we began to understand what an advocate was and so we have an advocate and now i want to look at the fact that we are also advocates and so we have a ministry we have advocacy we're just going to start start this subject today i'm very excited about it just maybe more than i have been uh for any time for a series subject looking i'm just very very excited about it and i see it as kind of a momentum and accumulation of many things that we've been ministering on so if you want to take your bibles and look at first john chapter 2 verses 1 to 2. i want to read these scriptures again and just touch on very quickly who our advocate is and how he's connected with mercy or the perpetuation and then begin to look at some personal things about us how that we also now have entered into personal relationship with christ and and then and then step into matthew chapter 5. so he says my little children these things write i unto you that you sin not so the purpose of writing the scripture is to never provide us a justification for our sins but to be justified from them and not that we would make excuses for our weakness but that we be taught faithfully taught and then be able to walk above things and to overcome them so he's saying i write these things that you sin not and then he provides this comfort if any man sin we have an advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous so our advocate is jesus christ the righteous and he jesus christ the righteous is the perpetuation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world this is what we've been drawing from and inspired by how that we have an advocate with the father the word advocate is also the same for comforter when jesus is speaking in john chapter 14 and 15 and the spirit of truth and the uh the the comforter is also the advocate it's the same word that is used so it's the same subject the same thought the same ministry the same person and an advocate is one who pleads another's cause and we looked at this how that we have an advocate for us who stands before the father this representation of the shed blood that pleads our case and it's through that pleading and through that uh representation of an advocate that brings us into fellowship with the father and has eradicated our sins and abolished sin and placated god's wrath for our sins and we enter into relationship and then we looked at this this role of an advocate how he pleads another's cause so he's pleading our cause he's there to support us he's there to lift us up and to encourage us and an advocate this is advocate this is a definition you'd find in the webster dictionary it's one that promotes or supports a cause a group or an interest something that promotes something that supports that's what an advocate does and john's joining it with our perpetuation so that perpetuation means it's the means of appeasing or satisfying it's translated to mercy seat in the new testament and it's pointing to and this is an image that'd be very profound to a jew to an israelite that would be pointing to the ark of the covenant that was so special to them and so powerful and even even very mysterious to them in the days that if this is being written but he's pointing to the mercy seat alluding to the mercy seat which was the lid or the covering of the ark of the covenant in the most holy place the holy of holies and so there was something very significant wherein the high priest went in one time a year on the day of atonement and and and put blood upon this mercy seat and it was a symbolism it was just a symbol of god the people being reconciled to god because of their sins and it was something repeated year after year so our advocate with the father is jesus christ the righteous we have this this image of mine jesus christ the righteous is our advocate with the father then also we must look at it this way our advocate not with the father necessarily alone but within us is the comforter the spirit of truth so we have an advocate with the father but this advocate the spirit of truth the comforter we are told dwells in us it's the baptism of the holy ghost gives us that inside teacher the the comforter is on the inside of us and so with our position in christ secured and having it secured and having our destiny certain my question is what is our advocacy if you ponder this brother dan i didn't notice you there until just now and i got nervous when i saw him like oh great the one who just preached is here uh auditing my course and uh he's gonna i'm gonna he asked me to be honest with him you know about how how you enjoyed the service and and let me know or not ask how i enjoy the services just let me know if there's anything that you any criticism anything you can help me with and uh i've just i feel like i have so much to learn and so i benefit from ministry and so i the same to you brother daniel if there's any pointers or tips you can give me and maybe one of them would be just don't completely stop down in the middle of your sermon and call somebody out and start rambling and looking like a rookie so i apologize but i just didn't notice you there it's really nice to have you i want to thank you for ministering for us on wednesday i was greatly blessed tremendously blessed so if i could just kind of gather my thoughts again should we just start all over greetings would be appropriate before you get this far but we we our position is secure in christ we we have this advocate with the father that gives us a tremendous it gives us comfort because our advocate is a comforter so that relationship gives us comfort then we have this advocate within us so our position and christ is secured and our destiny is certain there's there should be no well i know i'm sealed and but i just don't know if i'm going to get there well that doesn't that doesn't make sense scripturally and so we're trying to transitioning with with this tremendous gift of the holy ghost with this seal of god that we have down in our souls with this position in christ and the advocate we have with the father and the advocate we have within us what do we advocate for what is our advocacy and so i want to give a definition here on advocacy because it's tied to you could kind of just take advocate maybe conjugate it use it as a verb or kind of use it now transitioning to advocacy is a noun it's the act of pleading for supporting or recommending so advocacy is when you are pleading for something supporting something or recommending something it's the active support of an idea cause or policy and it says active support not just maybe a thought process or an ascent or an agreement with but it's active support of an idea the active support of a cause active support of a particular policy and it's especially the act of pleading or arguing for something so advocacy is the act of pleading for something arguing for something standing for something actively promoting and supporting the interest of something or the the cause or a group and so it has to do with active support now so let me just take a step back with this that's our thought the bride's advocacy our advocacy now individually this is all of us as individuals we've entered into if you've been born again you've entered into the most holy place you've entered in behind the veil and that's the image that paul has given us in the book of hebrews and so we're spiritually now between the cherubim communing with christ he is our high priest who is abolished any separation between us and god and he is he is uh forever consecrated this access to the father and so we now enter into fellowship and communion with god and we are raised up seated in heavenly places in christ jesus this is the promise that we've received and we're and we're secure in that and we we enjoy that and we have this place in christ where we've entered into and i want you to have that image in your mind we've entered into as they have a literal most holy place in the tabernacle and you have the outer court the inner court then this most holy place and there's this one veil from the outer court into the inner court and then you had to enter into another veil and get into that place where only the high priest went so paul in the book of hebrews is saying that we have this high priest forever after the order of melchizedek and it's done something for us where we've entered into that place as a believer and in hebrews chapter 6 verse 19 as he's drawing this picture out he says which hope we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and steadfast this is for you individually we have the anchor of the soul which is sure and said fast which entereth into that within the veil think of this image that he is showing us we who are born again have entered behind the veil we are in the most holy place that is where we are spiritually because we know physically we're looking around well this doesn't quite look like the most holy place i mean i guess there's just not a level of fan hood that you could have for hilton where you'd ever confuse the banquet room for the most holy place but this is we realize this is a spiritual position it has to have a reality to us and and it's got a really uh anchor in our hearts that we've entered in behind the veil and so when we when he uses this image of entering within that veil that's a place that sealed off this would be a place that just a normal average everyday israelite uh there before the tabernacle could look out and they could see the the the tent and then they could maybe some would have a service within the outer court and some that would have service within the uh the different ones that would have service in the intercourse but there's only one person that could go in behind the veil that'd be a secret place the questions that would be asked and you have all the details but to experience it and know what it looks like it's something only one person could uh enjoy but now we are in that place seemingly behind the veil very secret and i'm being very deliberate my terminology uh because i believe that this the the secret place in a hidden place and something private something very personal uh it's important to begin to ponder these these elements of even the word of god in this hour that opens up and it's in a private place in a secret place in a hidden place and it transpires within our deep within our hearts this is where we are as believers individually and in colossians and then collectively as believers we enjoy this but it's something very personal to the individual and colossians chapter 3 verse 3 it says for ye are dead and your life is hid with christ in god oh what a beautiful statement your life is hid with christ in god so there you are with christ in god that's the believer's position your real spiritual life then is hid and who has it hid from the world the spiritual life now the spiritual life he's not he's not advocating for uh being a hidden christian your real spiritual life is hid from the world laid up in god with christ with the one who is the perpetuation for our sins and it's given us the earnest of redemption so this is a very secure place this is a very safe place and the glory of the inner life this uh the power that we feel the peace that we have everything that's in this inner life it comes from our communion with him there between the cherubim i'll meet you and i'll commune with thee we're there spiritually communing with the word of god and from that we receive power we receive um this glory in the inner life uh from this communion with him but yet it's hidden it's a hidden communion it's concealed and notice the this i want you to recognize this in the scripture first john chapter three verse one so we read even first john chapter two and now we're reading in the very next chapter as in it so has this image within the same thought that he is sharing behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of god what love that we can call ourselves daughters of god sons of god what love has been bestowed upon us what grace then he says therefore the world knoweth knoweth us not because it knew him not so we say well the world hates you because it hated him and it so he told the disciples they're going to hate you so i'm going to give you a comforter and just know that when they hate you they hated me first he says the world doesn't know us because it doesn't know him it's quite the quite the phrase doesn't mean when you're christian people just forget who you are i'm sorry again what was your name but there's something about us that's hidden from them and just as there was something about christ that was hidden from them they didn't know him therefore they don't know us and a life that is hidden christ you can just ponder this a life that is truly sealed and and take ownership of it for yourself if you haven't been born again seek it with everything that's in your heart don't don't stop uh until you know that it's been made secure in your heart to believe the promise search it out identify it believe it accept it and so make that your ambition uh to to understand it to be taught right and to receive it but the the life hidden in christ is more mysterious to the world than any other life a believer's life who's entered in behind the veil because it's it's one of these things the world might call it magic or something but we've actually entered in behind a veil spiritual very very real very supernatural but very real we've entered in behind that and so we have a reality that transcends anything that we know through our senses and we've entered into a reality that cannot be comprehended or touched with our spiritual senses so this is something very deep something very profound something very uh very important that we've entered in behind this veil and we're living there behind this veil we have this life that's in there and so that hidden life that we're drawing from that we're living by that we're experiencing that we're enjoying is more mysterious than any other life we could have somebody who's uh um in a mysterious society or some secret club and you may you may be part of some uh some group that you know meets and behind closed doors and and there's a mysticism associated with it and all that tradition and all that circumstance and all the meetings and all the handshakes and all the symbolism and everything that cannot touch at all the mystery mystery of a life that's hidden christ a christian a the real christian life is more mysterious to the world than any other kind of discipline any other kind of life any other kind of way of thinking and believing and living and acting is the most mysterious of all life because in there we are fed by food that is hidden right we're fed by hidden manna we're supported and sustained by hands that are unseen it's we're guided by by insight and intelligence that the world does not know and cannot see we we read a bible that we say well i'm reading the same bible that you're reading but it means something different to you you get something else out of it people look at the word of god look at the message of the hour and they see the surface of it and then your life being the interpretation of it becomes more mysterious than any other religion any other theology so this is a very hidden life but does this mean that there is no public manifestation for the christian as we ponder that if we have this hidden life in christ and and we're hidden away and we're very mysterious and the world doesn't know us because they didn't know him is there is there no visible ministry for the christian in matthew chapter 5 verses 13 to 16. let's begin here to identify this and i feel that it is a rhetorical question because i don't know that any of us would say oh no the believer is to be a secret believer and we're to have a secret faith in christ and we're to be able to kind of be a chameleon christian and fit into whatever you know when in rome and be all things to all men and just take those scriptures and kind of change them and manipulate them and contort them to where we just kind of want to fit in with everybody and go along with the crowd and not offend and still believe and be a secret christian secret believer but there is a pup there is a visible ministry notice how jesus describes you when he says ye you could read and say i i am matthew chapter 5 verses 13 to 16 i'll break it up just a little bit and touch on some points here ye are the salt of the earth so you are salt and not just salt in a shaker on somebody's table but of the earth you're not just a stash in somebody's pantry you are the salt of the earth so there's no other source of salt for the earth than you and whatever image and this is where you kind of get pulled in some of the specifics or the types of it but whatever purpose salt serves in the earth naturally globally as far as a resource you are that to the earth in a very real way you are the salt of the earth but if the salt have lost its savor it means to become flat or tasteless the word actually relates to foolishness if it becomes foolishness wherewith shall it be salted how is the earth going to be salted it is then forth good for nothing but to be cast out and to be trodden under foot of men so if the if this if the salt becomes flat or tasteless or foolish and doesn't serve a purpose that it's intended and it doesn't have the effect or the impact that that people rely upon it for and that it and that it's what it's used for then you you can only use it to be trodden under the foot of man it's almost cast in it is worthless and so the the believer it says you are salt of the earth the salt of the earth the believer has a responsibility just think very quickly what we use salt for most often we are if we use it in preservation of things or the seasoning of food to give taste and to work together and harmonize with different elements to produce a desired outcome in cooking we have the role of seasoning others the christian has the role in the impact of seasoning others seasoning community seasoning seasoning an area a neighborhood a family so just think as christianities become watered down our communities and our local governments and a nation as a whole and the whole world has lost the seasoning that christianity was to provide to the whole world the the the impact and the effect of having a christian and having one who stood for principles of the word of god and stood for right it has the impact of seasoning others of preserving and with upholding and keeping corruption from setting in and so this is the this is the role that a believer has this is the role that you have you have a responsibility to season others and so if it says if the salt loses its savior listen the word never loses its power the word never loses its savor but ministry can witness can testimony can grace can never lose its effectiveness but it's our personal witness it's our personal testimony it's our doctrine will never lose its but it's our it's our fallen away from it wherein the salt loses its savior because we're the salt the salt of the earth he says you're the light of the world christianity cannot exist in name only believer should not exist in name only message believer should not exist in name only it ought not to be a a nomination that we give ourselves and we identify ourselves as as a particular group there's a radio station when i was in college that again it just started out as a sports talk radio station and when the on the first day that it started everyone who was there on the first day gave themselves a name and they called themselves the p ones and i think that had something to do with the old radios that had a p1 preset so you were day one p1 and you and you had there was only one preset it was your first it was your number one that you went to and so everybody identifies themselves by this designation are you a p1 right and we and we have certain characteristics that we give ourselves and we i identify ourselves as and i think it's very easy for us to say oh i'm a message believer i'm a christian i'm a believer i'm a i'm a son or daughter of god and those things should not exist in name only but they must have a virtue they must have a strength within it to season others and as jesus says we are a light now not only is it the role of salt but now it's the role of light in verse 14 you're the light of the world a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid now this ought to really impact us in this bright age to recognize that we as the bride of christ are coming into this manifestation of the new jerusalem that john saw i'm going to come and show you uh uh the the new jerusalem i'll show you the bride the lamb's wife and what does he see a city why because the bride the lamb's wife is represented as a city that's going to be set on a hill so now spiritually we are coming into this representation this manifestation of being the city that is set on a hill so now if you if you think of these elements we are the salt of the earth and the light of the world what would this world look like without salt and light salt of the earth in light of the world believers are god's instruments of seasoning preservation and illumination there's gonna be any light in the world you're the light of it didn't paul tell the believer now ye are light if there's going to be any seasoning or any any effect of uh withstanding corruption or preserving you're going to do it your salt and light so a city set on a hill cannot be hid now as he begins to amplify what it means to be your the light of the world neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a candle stick and it giveth light unto all that are in the house we see an image then of the seven church ages and the candlesticks that are given to light up the age and for that age as one would have a candle to light up their house another house has to have a candle to light up their house but then there's a city set on a hill so he says this with these images in mind let your light so shine let your light shine in like manner collectively as a city set on a hill that cannot be hid or is a candle that is placed upon a candlestick and not under bushel or hidden you don't light a candle then cover it up but you set it in such a place and you lift it up and you you're very purposeful and intentional in where you put it that it might might give appropriate light for the activity and the people who are engaging in it in the house oh it's dark in here light a candle i did well where is it i lit a candle and put it in the garage it's not doing me any good in the garage we need it out we need it up we need it we need it here i remember the other day we had some weather was coming in it was maybe like four o'clock in the afternoon some weather was coming in and it was it looked like a pretty good one and sister elizabeth lit a candle just in case the power went out it's like i think we got about four more hours before we're going to need that but good start and and that's what we do is we want to have light so we need a candle we need to place it in the right spot we need to be sure it's giving us light so he said let your light shine in like manner so we have a we have a personal audience with god behind the veil the world is sealed out the world doesn't know what's going on behind that veil where they're communing with god with christ in in the in between the cherubim they're represented in the mercy seat and then now jesus is saying that being your position you have a responsibility to let your light shine as a city on a hill or a candle in a house and in shining it has this this impact or this effect that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven we are salt and we are light remember that let me say just cut to the um just kind of get to the point having read these these verses here a believer has a public ministry every single believer has a public ministry if the word ministry kind of scares you a little bit and you think oh well i'm not a minister i'm not called to preach i'm not called to handle the word that's not what i'm referring to so let me say this way all of us have a public advocacy all of us have a a role and a responsibility of advocating for something the hidden life is a source of virtue but then in turn we must express it publicly the hidden life is the source of our glory the source of our strength the source of our joy but then we must turn it around and express it publicly as jesus has entered into that veil and your life is hid with christ in god and john said that the world doesn't know us because it didn't know him notice what it says in acts chapter 26 verse 26 for the king knoweth of these things he's speaking uh i don't know if now i realize i'd if he's festus or agrippa but he's saying for the king knoweth of these things before whom also i speak freely for i am persuaded paul's speaking now he's speaking of jesus christ he's referring to the the things in christ ministry he says but you know these things and i'm speaking very freely before you about these things for i'm persuaded and i'm open with you and i'm just telling you what i know and what i believe to be true and you already know him you know him beforehand because he says i'm persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him none of these things are hidden from the king for this thing was not done in a corner think about that this thing it may seem a little bit crude illusion to christ but the ministry of christ was not done in a corner it was public the miracles that he performed were done openly this is this is the ministry of christ was not just to gather a group of people together and let's get our 12 and let's go hide let's go out in the wilderness and let's let's have a commune and let's indoctrinate one another and let's kind of come into this mindset and this attitude of this is how we think and that's how we believe and this is how we live and then you go out and kind of cherry pick and sit people down in coffee shops when no one else is listening and say all right now there's this messiah this master and this teacher don't leave him don't let anybody hear this but you got to come see this guy it wasn't jesus was not out there uh uh hidden but it was a public these things were not done in a corner same with the disciples their ministry their witness their manifestation of the life that was inside of them was not done in a corner so paul says in second corinthians chapter four verse three but if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost and and now i was and i was when i was reading the second corinthians four it's just maybe a beautiful passage that i hated to chop out but if our gospel be hid and we know what the gospel is it's the power of god we know what paul said about the gospel and it is christ he's saying if it be hid it is hid to them that are lost in other words if it can't be seen it's not seen by those that are lost so it's not that the gospel is hid from them but the lost are veiled to not see the light the lost are veiled to not be able to see it or to recognize it so it's not it doesn't create this this idea that um are you lost oh well in that case i'm gonna hide we're gonna hide the gospel from those that we think are lost because what what is our calculation this could get real this will escalate quickly what is our calculation about whether or not we want to share the gospel with somebody whether or not we think they're an appropriate candidate we begin to judge and evaluate we and we kind of look even sometimes people we've known for a long time and we think oh well they're just serpentine right we should never say that but we have this idea oh we're there just serpentine and and and we and we use that calculation so once we've made that assessment what would we do when you when you believe something i'm glad there's an empty chair in the front row we believe that this person's serpent seed so you know what you're going to do well i don't cast my pearls before swine and we're going to hide the gospel from them right and that's not what the scripture is saying the scripture is not saying if paul's not saying well if i hide my gospel i hide it from those make-believers he's not saying i hide it from the unbeliever he's not saying he hides the gospel at all he's just saying i preach the gospel openly and if someone can't see it they can't see it because they're veiled from it it's actually expressing a grace in it right the gospel is availed to to their veiled in such a way to where they cannot see the light now is because this is in second corinthians chapter three verses two to three second corinthians chapter three verses two to three says ye are our epistle written in our hearts now if you could kind of catch this image we've used this already uh recently that paul has something written in his heart but he says known and read of all men so paul says you are our epistle that was within our hearts this burden this secret uh prayer the secret uh uh pouring out of his soul and this vision and this belief that he has even in them he says my my gospel you are my gospel that's written in my heart but it's not just in my heart anymore you were known and read of all men how is it known and read of all men the gospel in his heart is then read by the corinthians read by the corinthians interpret interpreted received and then they live it and he says though this is something that was a mystery in my heart and read in my and written in my heart you now becoming a partaker of this epistle are known in red of all you make it known the mystery known and read of all men but it doesn't mean people saying oh the mystery of paul in this beautiful people don't look at us as message believers and say wow okay well this is the interpretation of the message isn't this beautiful you're a mystery to them because they look at the message and they look at you and they can't quite reconcile what are they why can't they be like us why can't they reject it why can't they walk away from it why can't they belittle it why can't they water it down and there's a wrestling that takes place and so it's not like they look at us and go well i mean just look at this brother he's actually the epistle the representation of the bible the representation of the message the representation in scripture known and read of all men they may not make the calculation even but but you are it says for as much as you are manifestly declared to be the epistle of christ ministered by us you are manifestly declared or manifestly declaring the epistle of christ which was ministered by paul paul could preach a sermon in a house he can express something he could share something that's to the audience that is present but now he's saying you become the epistle of christ manifestly declared written not with ink but with the spirit of living god in the believer in the individual not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of the heart and where are these fleshly tables of the heart they're in that ark of the covenant because that's where the the witness and the testimony was placed in the old testament so this is the inner witness and the communion that translates into a public life and first thessalonians chapter one verse eight we may take time to go back over some of these things because it's very very rich and very full for from you sounded out the word of the lord not just paul paul didn't take the attitude as the messenger to that age that i'm the only one allowed to speak but he's saying from you sounded out the word of the lord not only in macedonia nikaya but also in every place your faith to god word is spread abroad so that we need not to speak anything this is the process of a believer hearing the word in the spirit of god taking and internalizing in the believer's heart them having this communion in behind the veil and then they are able to go and says from you sounded out the word from you it echoed from you sound out it means it echoed so there's a witness on the inside and the word is spoke within that throne room of a believer's heart but then it sounds out and echoes back out you are arranged spiritually acoustically in a spiritual way so that when god speaks the word this is a wonderful when god speaks the word into your soul you are designed acoustically to be able to sound it back out you are god's spiritual amphitheater that he can be there on the stage of your heart be yet the audience can hear why because he's designed you that way he's there in the center of the whole holy place within your soul and then he speaks and the whole world will hear because it echoes from you think about the language that's being used sounded out the word of the lord spread abroad and paul even has enough humility to say that because so i don't even need to be the one speaking because you took the message of the hour you took the word of god and you're sounding it out it's echoing in mark chapter 15 i wanted to get maybe into more details on this but i just want to read the one because the the the following verses speak to a public ministry but in the great commission a commission is authority entrusted to someone a commission is delegated authority or power so this is the great commission this is where god is delegating christ is delegating authority to the believer christ is giving taking authority and entrusting it to someone else jesus could say i will go into all the world and i will speak and i will raise the dead and i'll heal the sick and i'll do all those things but he said i'm trusting you with this power i'm entrusting you with this authority and he says go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature we are to be sent into the world with for the purpose of manifestly declaring the word of god the believer is to broadcast the believers to spread abroad the believer is to sound out the word of god amen now this is where i want to pause just for a moment and just say stop if there's a place you went before in your mind when you thought of the great commission if there was a place you went before in your mind when you begin to think about sounding out the word of god and being a witness and and what those things mean i'm not asking you to do away with it but just pause and begin to rethink it not saying it's going to be any what we're going to share is going to be any different but i want you to rethink maybe just give the holy spirit a chance to uh more fully develop our concept of the great commission because this commission it's not just the delegating of authority and the giving out of gifts and opportunities to do things and so we can just you know have fun with it and enjoy it god's very intentional there was an intent behind this and let me say as this might be a hard turn so just lean into it with so many causes in the world today in so many claims of certain things and i will say this uh so many conspiracies so many things on the horizon so many interpretations of the events that have transpired and taking place so many and i think the word cause is what really uh uh anchors to me when i identify as so many things causes or goals or ambitions and things people want to achieve or ideas that people want others to accept and the actions that would then be necessitated required by that there's so many of these things in the world today and and events transpire to where we go back we've all had the thought man i wish in 2019 i had started an etsy shop for masks right i i wish that i had just somehow had a premonition in 2018 i just want to start making a lot of masks and and buying up surgical masks and what are you doing it for i don't know you just never know right because who knew that these things would become a part of our lives who knew all these different things that we began to buy i think it was we were traveling i asked um you know the uh i was just clarifying because i wasn't that what do we need to take out liquids because they have different equipment if you're uh tsa precheck there's different rules and every airport's different and sometimes even one lane is different than the next lane in an airport talk about causes we should write a letter to the tsa because it's very confusing and the the guy said yeah you have to take your liquids out but any size hand sanitizer will be fine i thought i'm sure macgyver would figure out a way to blow up a 737 with hand sanitizer and any amounts fine bring it guys excuse this five gallon barrel of hand sanitizer that i bought a ticket for so it can fly in the middle seat they didn't have a problem with it but who would have thought that you would need to travel with you know five gallons of a hand sanitizer and and have masks and all these things that are now a part of our thought process in our prior life there i'm referring to it to make this point there's things that can all of a sudden come up and intervene where now you're having to make considerations for things you have to accommodate certain things and you're being required to do different things that we never had to worry about before could you imagine um let's just time travel back to the civil war and and someone uh you know someone says they think you know i don't know what's going on i feel like something's wrong with my heart and says well would you be you know what do you think about a heart transplant and you couldn't discuss the morals and the ethics of receiving somebody else's heart back then because it's like it ain't happening but nowadays a believer could actually have a moral quandary about whether or not they would take a heart transplant right and these are things that we now have to consider and things that we have to ponder because of how things trans uh move along and transpire and so we live in a time when there's so many claims so many causes so many things that need some sort of acknowledgement or affirmation what do we advocate for we're forced to make a decision and you've got you better change your avatar you better wear this shirt at work you better do this you better do that bill abraham said there are so many voices in the world so many problems and needs crying for attention it really resonated with me so many voices in the world so many problems and so many needs crying for attention this needs attention this needs attention this needs a decision this needs a side this needs an argument this needs an opinion this needs support with all of that what do we advocate for i want you to rethink your concept of the great commission rethink the concept of ministry and sharing the gospel and it's sounding out we know the statement the bride will be and i'm just paraphrasing the bride will be the final voice to the final age raise your hand if you've heard that before good almost unanimous the bride will be the final voice to the final age but have we ever really thought about what her voice will be i mean it's a really it's really a such a profound statement in the church age book and it elicits a great reaction from the bride because it's really full of so much energy it's full of so much inspiration and it's it's a very profound statement and we'll come to it here in a moment that the bride under her messenger she just as paul said the word is sounding out from you and you're my epistle known and read of all men that this ministry at the end time of brother branham he's delivered his message and now he's saying that the bride under her messenger she's actually going to be the voice of god in the last days it's going to be great is the company that publishes this gospel and it's actually the elect of god it's the bride of god the final voice is in the bride and listen you can use that statement at a convention in africa and they'll come and pick you up on their shoulders and march you around the tabernacle hey put me down put me down they love it but if we ever have we ever stop for a moment to think about what is her voice what will it sound like what is the final voice let me say this way and you say oh that's very convenient brother aaron it fits your title the final voice is the bride's advocacy the final voice to the final age is the final advocacy the final the bride's advocacy is is summed up in the phrase the final voice to the final age advocacy comes from ad which is two and vaca c or vocacy which is comes from the root vox which means voice think about that advocate it comes from to voice to advocate is to add a voice of support to a cause or to it for a person that's what it means to advocate for it you you can't advocate without a voice that's why advocacy is not it's not in the sense of taking a poll in a survey and saying are are you for changing the locks on the church we just we need we need to we need you to check the box no advocating for changing the locks on the church is going around saying i think it would be best if we change the lock to the church and i really think we should paint the baptismal this way and it's going out supporting advocating giving a voice to it's not just having an opinion deep buried within the recesses of your mind to advocate is to add a voice to support to advocate is to add a voice to a cause and even the word voice and this is where i'm really relying upon uh you to think uh not necessarily abstractly but to understand voice when you think of a voice of something it's a medium or an agency of expression like you may have a publication that serves a particular group and what does it become it's a newsletter which is advocating for that group's cause and it could be called the voice of the the law changers i don't know why that came in my mind we don't even have our own building meanwhile someone from the hilton's walked by they're thinking about changing the locks they've been here too long but it's too it's a medium or an agency of expression so you can have something that serves a movement serves as the voice of a movement serves as a one to give to give the uh the cause and to promote its interest to to have a voice in something is to have a right or an opportunity to express a choice or an opinion haven't we said that before decisions being amazing well i didn't have a voice in that or there's this these forms that allow for people to give a voice and we want to hear from the community and so when you have a voice you have the right you may not have the right to make the decision but you have the right or the opportunity to express your choice or to express your opinion and so herein lies the ad the responsibility of advocacy that there you you must promote to to have an advocacy you must promote the cause of another to be an advocate you must be supporting listen the cause of another that's what advocacy is when you i love the banjo i really do now if you could just get a little bit of mandolin going behind that we have a responsibility as an advocate to promote the cause of another this is what an advocate is they promote that their voice for something they're representing someone else listen when we read when we understand what advocacy is and what an advocate is you recognize and realize that we don't have our own agenda we don't have our own uh goal and our own image we're not building our own reputation we're not building our own cause so that we don't give voice and support something that's going to benefit us we realize that if we are advocates then we're supporting the interest of someone else if we're advocates and we're advocating and we have an advocacy it's not so that we look good and so that we're better off it's so that somebody else's interests are promoted i was thinking about creeds and dogmas and theologies and ideas and claims and causes and we know brother graham said over and over again many different places we have no law but love and he was born this from somebody else but he gave it his approval we have no law but love no creed but christ no book book of the bible now i want to i want you to think about this let's not say this about a church let's not say this about branham tabernacle let's not say this about arizona believers church or tucson tabernacle or another church we have no law but love is a christian we have no creed but christ as a christian we have no book but the bible as a christian this is taking a phrase and i want to get legalistic with it i'm sure there's a way that we could we could begin to kind of thresh it out a little bit where we realize well this is a statement this is a phrase that's meant to convey that we don't have a bunch of things that we believe this and we believe that and we have all these different things that we're fighting for and these other things we're promoting it's it's becoming laser-focused as a christian saying my creed is christ now that assumes a lot in reality if christ is our creed there's a whole book of creeds right if we have no law but love and god is love then there's a law there's a restraint there's a force there's an effect associated with god that's a very broad law if we have no book but the bible there's a lot in this book so it's not used just to limit it down to a cliche where we have uh you know god said it or god thought it brother brown spoke it i believe it that settles it to try to just button it up all neat and cute and simple and there it is i'm a believer well if you really want to say it god thought it brother man spoke it you believe it that settles it well there's a lot there let's diagram that sentence let's get behind what it means god thought it let's get behind what did what did he think and what was spoken what does it really mean to believe it and wherein is in those three things what is settled in that so there's a lot here we have no law but love no creed but christ no book but the bible there's a lot that's meant behind these phrases that we use and things that are very personal and dear to us nothing against them and i because i'm actually using it to get get us to stop for a moment what is it that we voice our support for and how does it fit within that i'm i i feel like i'm running out of time and so let me just pause for a moment to consider whether or not i want to read this very lengthy quote um for uh to you to before we close and this is your opportunity to say preach brother go on go on take your time yeah that's the cue there that's i mean i have it written here cue the people prime the people to say keep preaching and uh we need to work on that we're going to read through this and i don't want to get caught in some of these things i just want you to recognize brother brown's train of thought as he writes in chapter 9 of the church age book the baptists have their creeds and dogmas based on the word and you can't shake them so creeds but notice their creeds their dogmas based on the word and you can't shake them notice their creed isn't the word their dogma isn't the word because if it was then you shouldn't be shaken but they based their creeds their interpretation their dogma on the word they say the apostolic days of miracles are over and there is no baptism with the holy ghost subsequent to believing or after believing being sealed with the holy ghost the methodists say based on the word again based on the word there is no water baptism sprinkling is not baptism and that sanctification is the baptism with the holy ghost the church of christ majors in regenerational baptism and in all too many cases they go down dry centers and come up wet ones yet they claim their doctrine is word based what is he identifying all these movements that have based something on the word and they use the word as their justification god says this and the bible says that and they have these things they're vocalizing and very supportive of in drawing lines and casting down this and supporting this and advocating for this all based on their interpretation of the word but what have they done they've left the word and they're and they're advocating for things that are contrary to the word yet they claim their doctrine is word based go right down the line and come to the pentecostals do they have the word give them the word test and see this is a really good zinger they will sell out the word for sensation for a sensation just about every time wow they will sell out the word for sensation just about every time if you can produce a manifestation like oil and blood and tongues and other signs whether in the word or not or whether properly interpreted from the word the majority will fall for it but what has happened to the word the word has been put aside so god says i'm going against you all i will spew you out of my mouth this is the judgment of laodicea lukewarm cold and formal they have a lot of movements a lot of causes a lot of fervency a lot of ambition a lot of passion a lot of power a lot of force a lot of weight a lot of enthusiasm but they're lukewarm in god's eyes he says i'ma cast you aside i'm a spirit of mouth this is the end for seven out of seven ages i've seen nothing but men esteeming their own word above mind so at the end of this age i'm spewing you out of my mouth it is all over i don't know where we added this this is good it is all over but is the speaking over he says i'm going to speak all right yes i'm here in the midst of the church the amen of god faithful and true will reveal himself and it will be by my prophet oh yes that is so i like his writing style revelation 10 7 in the days of the voice think about voice a little bit differently now of the sabbath messenger when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as if declared to his servants the prophets there it is he is sending a vindicated prophet he ascended a prophet after almost two thousand years he is sending someone who is notice so far from organization education and the world of religion that is john the baptist and elijah of old he will hear only from god and he will have thus saith the lord and speak for god far from organization and education he will be god's mouthpiece and he as it is declared in malachi 4 6 this is his all caps so he's shouting at us a little bit will turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers he will bring back the elect of the last day and they will hear a vindicated prophet give the exact truth as it was with paul he will restore the truth as they had it now what happened in paul's day when he gave them the truth you are my epistle written in my hearts known and read of all men you are manifestly declared to be the epistle of christ which i've ministered so paul ministered christ they received it they manifestly declared it he had the vision and the burden in his heart they became it known and read of all men he says out of you sounded the word of god into macedonian acai and all these different places so that i don't even have to go there and be the one speaking because by you living it you are in fact sounding out my voice and the message i received because i got it from god anyways i was only echoing i was a means of echo now from you it's echoing outside why because it's reverberating resounding within your soul and those elect with him in that day will be the ones who truly manifest the lord and be his body and be his voice and perform his works it's a capital h is his voice and perform his works hallelujah do you see it a momentary consideration of church history will prove how accurate this thought is in the dark ages the word was almost entirely lost to the people but god sent luther with the word the lutheran spoke for god at that time but they organized and again the pure word was lost for organization tends towards dogmas and creeds and not simple word there's a tendency there's a weakness they could no longer speak for god then god sent wesley he was the voice with the word in his day the people who took his revelation from god became the living epistles read and known of all men for their generation notice when the methodist failed so you see the true nature of it but then there's a failure of it god raised up others and so has it gone on through the years until this last day there is again another people in the land who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age recognize that there is not going to be another cycle where the messenger comes and gives the word and then the people are going to sound it out and then they fail and you need another one to come this is the last time it happens there is a message that has been brought there is a people who have received that message and they become the ones who are the final voice to the final age what that tells me is there will be a people that will sustain the voice and that will fulfill the commission and it will not fail and there will not need to be another messenger another prophet another cycle yes sir the church is no longer the mouthpiece of god what is it it is its own mouthpiece the church is no longer the mouthpiece of god it is its own mouthpiece should a church ever be its own mouthpiece any church but he says the church is not the mouthpiece of god that means one who speaks on behalf of another a mouthpiece is one who speaks for somebody else a mouthpiece is not one who promotes their own interest promotes their own ideas their creeds and their dogmas it's not hearing the word of god and then basing your idea off the word of god and then now advocating supporting and lifting up your interpretation and your agenda and your idea that is your being your own mouthpiece that is being your own advocate it's changing even the nature of the definition an advocate promotes somebody else's interest did not jesus say he will not speak of himself or he's not just trying to promote his own interests he's not just trying to become you know this uh an object to be worshiped but the very ministry of the holy ghost is one that promotes the interest of christ for your benefit and your interest as a son or daughter of god do you recognize how that advocacy and to advocate for something cannot be your own personal agenda it's gonna be on behalf of somebody else and when the methodists began be became more worried about how they looked and their church services and the growth of their organization they were no longer speaking on behalf of the body of christ they were speaking on the behalf of their church and they no longer were god's mouthpiece same with luther same with pentecost but there's a people in the land today another people in the land that people that i am standing before this morning who under their messenger are the final voice to the final age what is the final voice the final voice is our advocacy our role in responsibility the final voice is our role in our responsibility as an advocate and i don't want to be cliche i want you to think deeply about it think deeply rethink as we said before this ministry because god is very intentionless concept of the great commission as we close there now in just a couple of few more scriptures i'd like to read to you but may they might just kind of be rapid fire we've been just about it we've just been right at an hour now i think in terms of our preaching what is your advocacy i can ask you personally if we followed you on instagram if we knew what your username was on pinterest if we observed your website whatsapp status i'm not trying to make you all get uncomfortable i'm just asking what do we advocate for what are we promoting what are we recommending i'm fairly confident that the people here know that i like ritos right because i mention them and people might think that i have a contract with ritos that i'm an evangelist for ritos i advocate for why because i voice it i say something about it i mention it what is it you do when you like a restaurant and you really really like it you take your friends there you recommend you tell others about it people know oh well brother so-and-so really likes this because he recommends it well what kind of you know what i'm thinking about buying a pair of shoes uh what do you recommend and when somebody you can always tell when somebody's like i'm so glad you asked i thought you would never ask come here let me let me show you and you're like uh never mind i'll just google it just go to wirecutter.com i'll figure it out you know just use amazon reviews they're because they'd be very passionate about telling you about it and sharing with you and letting you know so i'm asked what are we promoting what are we recommending what are we actively supporting listen christianity is not propaganda our advocating for something and our ministry and our commission and those things that relate to being a witness is not uh is not made up of should never become pers a personality cult christianity is not political activism wherein we can get sometimes engage in misguided advocacy in the same way that the baptists and the methodists and the lutherans based their creeds and their dogmas on the word but yet upon further inspection it wasn't the word i'd even say this as a means of caution we're not called to be apologetics paul said i'm set for the defense of the gospel apologia to where we feel like we as believers are are called to prove and defend what we believe that's not what christianity is called to that's not what the great commission is is giving the proof of something and giving the convincing argument or defending it that's not what our advocacy is but advocacy does have a goal advocate advocacy does have a special interest and it's not church promotion it's not a political propaganda as we look go back and look at the definition of advocacy it's adding a voice of support to a cause or person what person do we support what cause are we promoting there is again another people in the land who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age in latin advocate comes from the stem advocare advocate advocate a-d-v-o-c-a-t comes from the stand advocare which is add vocare add v-o-c-a-r-e which means to call or to summon or to invite our advocacy is largely an invitation to know christ advocacy is a means of summoning and inviting and calling to someone immediately those of you who have been able to follow me in this thought and i know i may be using something that's a little bit different the words of it advocacy and i'm trying to draw on something that may we may even be familiar with in a natural way and lifting up the advocacy of the holy spirit and now we're viewing ourselves in this role of being an advocate when we think of someone who advocates for something you're promoting the ideas and interest of something you're standing for you're recommending it you're calling it out and in some ways what you're doing is you're saying hey i they they this company offers a great product i'm a developer i'm a designer i do something on this platform and when you become an evangelist for it or advocate for it then you're one that goes out and you want to get other people to join in and and be a part of and accept and assimilate into or adopt a certain way of thinking and viewing and believing and when we become advocates when we are the final voice to the final age what that means is we are now the final summons the final invitation the final voice to the final age isn't going serpent seed serpent seed serpent seed serpent seed serpent seed that's not what the final voice is the final voice to the final age is the last advocate the last advocacy for truth the last advocacy for righteousness the last invitation to righteousness to truth to holiness to healing to life to happiness to joy before the tribulation sets in oh my can you see what you're called to do in this hour it's not to promote a church to promote a ministry to promote a man to promote a personality it's an invitation to christ it's a summons to the blessings of the word i would desire that anyone could have an opportunity anyone could have an opportunity to partake in one of our services and receive a blessing whether it be healing whether it be deliverance from oppression whether it be an enlightenment a change of attitude i would that they could be invited to taste to see to feel to know christ to have an opportunity wouldn't it be wonderful if you knew that what you know to be truth and this blessed relationship you have with christ think of the peace that you have in him think of the great deliverance that you've experienced think of how he's always met you and your desperation and your need and provided everything for you for all these many years just think that someone could stand at the doorway of that opportunity what it's meant to you and that another could have a chance to come to that place that's what it means to advocate it means to call to summon and to invite in john chapter 4 we have used the scripture so many times as a church in one year where jesus meets the woman at the well disciples went in to the city to get some burritos jesus goes to the goes to the well because he had needs to go that way they're going to find a meal and he comes to a woman who's thirsty she comes to draw water we know the story her testimony her life her experience her background and what did jesus do he exposed something very personal it and i i can say this i don't know why i'm struggling with this mic i could blame it on the last person that person that wore it but i won't do that the uh her li her her sitting was very very public i mean i don't know how you could have five husbands and be living with another one without at least six people knowing about it um but this is i mean this is a very public sinful life but then just her all by herself she meets a man who through conversation just talking to her about water you know and bringing it just talking to her completely opens up something inside of her and the transformation that transpires at the well i mean we're given the dialogue of it but you have to recognize this is something so amazing that transpires and when this i am he he made himself known to her and then it says in john chapter 4 verses 28 29 the woman then left her water pot went her way into the city and saith to the men this is this is what she said to the men now if you're turning your bibles in the law if you could get the scrolls out let's turn to deuteronomy 18. she didn't she didn't go there she didn't feel that she hadn't had to explain everything she didn't even have to give her life story and her testimony she comes and she goes her way after she left her water pot and this is what she says come see a man which told me all things that i ever did is not this the christ and so it's it's she when she says he told me all things that i ever did she has she is a personal witness of the power of the messiah she knows personally what he can do she knows that he has the power to break cycles to give deliverance to heal to expose and to bring sort of a deliverance and she doesn't go out and try to replicate what god did to her what christ did to her she goes out with the desire that somebody else that these men could have an audience and a personal opportunity with christ and she said come and see there was no self-promotion there was no agenda she had met the one she says come meet the one that i have met and the private meeting turned and turned her into a public witness and then what she began to advocate publicly was not a show but an invitation for everyone else to have a private meeting come and see for yourself make it personal in john chapter 1 verses 43 to 46 the day following jesus would go forth into galilee and findeth philip and saith unto him follow me now we don't say follow me but this is what jesus said to philip so now philip was from was of bethesda the city of andrew and peter now something's happened to philip his eyes have been opened philip findeth nathanael and saith unto him we have found him of whom moses and the law and the prophets did right jesus of nazareth the son of joseph and and so here you can say well here he is brother aaron he's he's he's going to deuteronomy he's telling them he's breaking it down but and nathanael said unto him can there any good thing come out of nazareth philip saith in him come and see that's advocacy the experience that was made available to philip was a personal literal physical walk with the messiah to be there by his side and philip did not want to advocate for mere knowledge of a present messiah he didn't want to just say he's here just take me at my word just believe me philip said come and see for yourself this is what it means to advocate it's a call it's a summon it's an invitation but the mike and brother law if you could come to your instruments i want to read revelations chapter 22 verse 17 in closing think of the very end of this book even the book of the bible so nearing the very end he says the spirit which is the advocate which is the comforter the spirit and the bride say come the spirit and the bride say come if advocate comes from advocare which means to summon to invite or to call the spirit and the bride advocate and says and let him that heareth say come there's it's not just someone who heard you say come but it's actually this dynamic of the spirit now working in the bride the bride under her messenger giving invitation and the one who hears is the one that becomes a part of that dynamic because the spirit and the bride said come and now one heard and now he's part of that dynamic now one with the spirit as the member of the bride saying come and who are we saying it to him that is thirsty come and whosoever will let them take the water of life freely and if it be hidden we've at least done our part we don't hide the well from them that are lost we don't hide the well from them that we do not think are worth it we do not even hide the grace of god from those that we have been offended by and deemed them unworthy of it because we're not advocating for ourselves think now think about this i just i pondered give much thought to uh how god would maybe bring it to be able to express what's in my heart on our advocacy and it really just in god inspiring the fact this foundational sermon to me that it made it really click because even when we preached on the advocate the very beginning i mentioned the bride's advocacy and it's just matured and gotten deeper and richer to where the less it really became the less the bride was part of it in a sense and in the less even others because in in one way so the bride's advocacy is oh well just look out look out after the sick and look out after the poor and and you realize no i'm not advocating for the poor but in my advocacy for christ i have a i have something to offer the poor in advocating for the cause of christ and advocating for truth and advocating for the righteousness i i can then summon and invite those that are needy those that are hurting those that are sick those that are wounded those that are sinful and so it's not that i'm i'm coddling the center and advocating for the center picking up the cause all these different causes and well if the bride's advocating then should she advocate for gay rights or should you advocate for the gold standard should she advocate you know for robin hood versus sophie i mean what what is it what is what we promote what what are we all in on game stock or or or amc which which one do we invest in over there just tell me but no we're we advocate for christ that's who we're advocating for and how it's so rich and so deep to me that i realize that it's not our own agenda that we're promoting and in the end it's we have a responsibility to advocate for christ and so i i asked this question i just shared all that maybe his background in my own heart as i've pondered this if your worst enemy the person who's done you the most harm and the greatest hurts if you were asked to give them an opportunity for the love of christ and the grace of god would you do it i'm not saying it would be easy but if you could challenge yourself with this notion that somebody who's harmed you blasphemed spoke against did all these nasty things whatever my horrible deep dark horrible things to you if you knew that they would have an opportunity give be given maybe you're not the one that needs to do it but you heard that they could have an opportunity to know christ what would you do and as you challenge yourself with that scenario it might help you kind of work out where the hang up is because you think well they don't deserve it well you're not advocating for him you're advocating for christ well they did me this isn't about you it's about christ and you begin to adjust everything begins to change and everything begins to be orientated in such a way true we can say wait a minute yes christ you that's that's the kind of person you would probably come to in your days on earth when you walked this earth we would have been saying hey come with us to the temple there's a meeting of pharisees and there's i mean i know that has a negative context maybe to us today but there's a meeting of scribes come speak to them the richest men the most powerful men the prestigious and these opportunities and jesus said you know what i need to go by samaria there's a woman there well tell us about her a woman oh is her is she married to a teacher she come from a royal family oh no she's she's been married five times and she's actually living with another man now well really got all these people that you could go to and spend time with and all these other ideas and agendas that you could get behind and you're gonna go to samaria and go out of your way for her i'm just asking you to consider how you would relate to that so you could ponder what we're advocating this sermon has just been the foundation of us examining our advocacy the beginning of us exploring our advocacy the spirit and the bride say come it's an invitation to summons what did jesus say we are we are salt we are light you could say i am salt i am light if you are salt and you are light if i am salt and i am light if we are the salt of the earth and the light of the world then as salt without a public ministry the world will never crave without light with our without our advocacy the world will never see him are you hearing me if you're the salt of the earth no one's ever going to crave for christ until you're salty no one's ever going to ask the question no one's ever going to know you are the seasoning think of yourself then as the grain of salt within your family a grain of salt at your school a grain of salt at work a grain of salt within your larger family a grain of salt within your community and you realize that i'm the point of contact that if that i have a role a responsibility that if i'm not if i don't have the right kind of public ministry flowing out of the right kind of private life the right private life the right experience now flowing out into the right kind of public ministry then there's not going to be anyone ever begin to desire to know him like i know him and if i'm not the light and i'm walking in the light as i ought to if i'm not advocating as i should then they're never going to know their way to them so we have a responsibility and consider consider this what are you a voice for what do we promote what do we actively support put another way what are you advocating for could you consider it with me could we consider it as a church just ask ourselves if someone was to say so what's what's uh what's your church's agenda that we would have the right one what's your ambition what's your goal what are you trying to accomplish that as a believer i'd have the right one when i say the right one the one that promotes christ his interest and his cause stand with me this morning [Music] the presence that you felt in song service i don't know if you could tell but it's only intensified true worship is connected with the fulfillment of the word of god now that the word has gone forth we can have that liberty to really worship but as we do let's be intentional with it we're being challenged as a church you're being challenged as individuals believers to find your place in christ to really i want to say get comfortable but it's not so much getting comfortable maybe it's more about getting uncomfortable and getting out of those little boxes that we've put ourselves in to try to protect ourselves and fed ways of defining who we are and ways of defining what we do and ways of thinking let's just be honest with ourselves we've had decades of message tradition things have just evolved and we do things a certain way and there's ways that we uh these dynamics even to a church surface and i'm just being very transparent right now there's ways that i do things as a minister that just fit as i'm and i'm not this is not a compliment i'm just being very transparent that just fits the order of the service right we're gonna stand when we read the bible i'm going to ask god to add his blessing to the reading of a word we're going to have you to be seated right and there's like this is the way that the service is supposed to go there's a way that we do song service there's a way that there's a way that everything's structured and and a lot of that is just built around how it was done before by other people and then the next one follows they do it the same way but listen we could then build up this idea in our minds of this is the way that it's supposed to be and then one day it's done a little bit differently and we get so offended i don't get nervous i'm not about to change the church order but just one of those things it's really it's not in the word but it's it's a formality that we've based on the actions of others or may we based on uh certain things that brother branham taught and it's based on it and we do it that way and if it was to be done just a little bit differently people oh you'll never you'll never guess what they're doing over there at arizer believers church you'll never guess and and they have the and where where do we get that from where where would that instinct come where would that wrestle in that battle come from maybe you're advocating for some way of doing things and you're taking it really really personal and it's not really in the word but we would take up stones to stone the one who seemed to just kind of step out of line so maybe it's not a matter of getting comfortable maybe we have to get uncomfortable first before we can find the place that we're supposed to be i wanted to just challenge you today to ask yourself what am i voicing my support for when i started going down the line of your whatsapp status and your pinterest board and your uh you know the people you follow on instagram and even what you post on instagram it was more just trying to get you to consider that in your life what brand do you wear what what is what what voice what what what have you become a voice for and again i think we need to rethink what the great commission is we need to rethink it so don't immediately just say oh well fine then i'll change my avatar to the pillar fire that's not what i'm saying that's not what i'm saying just starting all over and thinking what does it mean to be the final voice to the final age let's bow our heads if you desire prayer this morning i invite you i summon you to look to him look to jesus he's here i welcome you is there anybody else that would join with me today add your voice to mine right now as the spirit is charging through us and as a bride could someone join with me and say come see a man i'm inviting you today to come to christ it's not my altar it's not my church it's not my sermon it's not my testimony it's not my ministry but i am his voice advocating for him on your behalf for salvation for healing for peace for life joy receive them now a gracious heavenly father my pleading in my prayers for the cause of christ and i would that my family be saved i would that people be healed i would that the lost would find their way [Music] and not for to promote my own personal agenda and truthfully lord not even to promote the sinner's agenda or their interest but the love of christ that motivates me it's for your cause it's in my advocating for christ that i desire to see others know you in the way that i have it is in our advocacy for the message of the hour that we desire that others would come to be introduced to you through this message not adopt formalities not adopt modalities not adopt certain ways of church order and believings [Music] lord it's almost as if we've adopted catholicism into the message where we genuflect before certain things and we we have our rosaries and we have our candles but i want to lift up christ because not for one moment should we be called to start churches to promote our own interest in our own agendas but wherein we preach and wherein we evangelize wherein we speak wherein we lift up the voice of god it's that a real relationship would be formed between god and an individual but i moved even by reading that scripture revelations 22 17 the spirit and the bride say come and immediately immediately lord you already have it written in your word how effective it is and him that hears him that he hears now echoes what the spirit of the bride says and he says come lord you already wrote it in the word that it's effective that it works let us then join in the echo in the sounding as your bride saying come and let him hear let them hear whatever their pronouns may be let he or she here let him or he hear let them or they hear let them hear lord that they may say come i commit the people to you today i know there's very deep needs in our assembly i know there's needs in our hearts there's great needs within families there's tremendous needs for faithfulness and deliverance and healing salvation i believe all things are possible i believe that bodies that are broken can be mended minds that are scattered can be ordered [Music] i believe i'm advocating now lord for you and your power and your ability that the sick can be healed the lost can be saved and may we as a church stand upon the foundation of the word of god stand in the center of the opening of the word and advocate for the right things i commit the people to you now lord bless them i pray in the name of the lord jesus christ amen
