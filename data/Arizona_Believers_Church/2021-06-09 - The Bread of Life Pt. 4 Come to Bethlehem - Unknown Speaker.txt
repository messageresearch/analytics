TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Ruth 1: 1-5 says now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled that there was a famine in the land and a certain man of Bethlehem Judah went to soldier in the country of Moab he and his wife and his two sons and the name of the man was IMC and the name of his wife Naomi and the name of his two sons Mahan and kilan ephes of Bethlehem Judah and they came to the country of Moab and continued there and aimc Naomi's husband died and she was left and her two sons and they took them wives of the women of Moab the name of the one was orpa and the name of the other Ruth and they dwelt there about 10 years Mahan and kilan died also both of them and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband if we could just bow our heads in prayer our gracious Heavenly Father lord it's with a heavy heart that we're bowing our heads before you tonight just thinking of our dear brother Lord and even the circumstances of his passing and how that one who is loved by so many and one who's touched so many's lives could somehow Lord as it sounds um pass away in a hospital with a with a sickness Lord that none nobody knew about and with no one at his side and Lord I don't know what the circumstances are that would allow that to happen and just exactly even how he passed away but Lord just having it confirmed just before service Lord I have a heavy heart for for his family for the church family and Lord we just pray that you'd be a comfort to them all that you would use this as only you can For Your Glory for the bride's benefit for his family's benefit Comfort his sister and the different ones Lord that may may they uh find soulless in your presence Lord for the Believers there at Cloverdale Bible way we know that they've uh as some other churches have been been split by a border being closed and restrained because of the circumstances of the pandemic Lord they've suffered tremendously already we just pray that you bring healing to them and comfort Lord and wisdom instruction Lord and father tonight as we stand in your presence we are looking forward to you sharing something in your word that would be a strength to us that would encourage us Lord we have not gathered here in vain there's not one person here who's going to confess and profess that they gathered in vanity that they came merely to be seen Lord there's not one here who's come to be a Critic there's no one here who's come traditionally Lord We Gather in a setting like this because we want to be here and so I pray Lord you'd speak to all of us because we're here to hear from you we thank you for the visitors that are with us this evening Lord for those who are traveling in a way we ask that you bless them and strengthen them and encourage them be with us now we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you you can be seated going to just jump right into our subject this evening as we've been ministering out of the Book of Ruth and our subject has been um the bread of life building from the statement where brother brandham says that in the Rapture message that the shout is the living bread of life bringing forth the bride and so that is the message so the the message is the living bread of life and that Miracle or that revelation of the bread of life is what brings forth the bride it's what her attraction is and how that is so important to the bride uh coming to her Rapture condition and we started looking in the Book of Ruth because it talks about how that Ruth came to Bethlehem at Harvest Time and we've been using the subject of Come to Bethlehem and brother brandham says about the Book of Ruth that there's a hidden revelation in it and when you catch it the real meaning it'll bring you close to God and he prays that God would reveal himself what he is in this story what he is to you and how to accept him so there's just tremendous truths that are in this book tremendous truths that are in this story and it begins just even with the setting in in verse one it begins with just even the names of each of the characters there's so much so many Rich things that are in this and uh I I'm wanting just to kind of finish up verse two tonight and realize I'm not even going to be able to finish finish what's on my heart so I just want to come to a particular Point that'll perhaps challenge us just to be thinking a little bit about what these verses mean to us and what this Revelation is in the Book of Ruth for us but we're if I could say it this way the Ruth as brother Ram says it has a hidden revelation that it holds a revelation of how that God deals with his people to bring full Redemption as a story of The Book of Ruth is about Redemption and a kinsman redeemer and about inheritance uh being changed or even lost and how that through marriage it redeemed uh the family of ALC and even redeemed uh Ruth the moabitas it holds a revelation then the truths that we see in it hold a revelation of how God redeems fully redeems his people and we're living in a time of full Redemption amen so if we're living in a time of full Redemption then we could look to a story like Ruth and we can begin to see types of how that God deals with his people and we know that Christ is the hidden revelation in the Book of Ruth and when I say that he's a hidden revelation there could be a lot of Scholars and theologians say that's not hidden everybody knows that Christ that Boaz is a type of the kinsman redeemer that Boaz is a type of Christ but we realize that a lot of people believe in the Christ of the Bible but Christ is hidden from them that Christ is restrained by tradition and false interpretation and so we want to see Christ as he is in the word of God and not just pay lip service to something that we believe because someone told us and not only is Christ the hidden revelation of the Book of Ruth but his bride is also part of that mystery just doesn't reveal Christ but it also Reveals His Bride and we see this played out in typed out in the Book of Ruth and Ruth being a a a moabit or a gentile now where I want to pick up is on uh something we've been identifying for through the first few Services how that IMC and his family are portraying Israel and the Disobedience of Israel in departing from the promised land and it's real key to catch that how that as as as they depart from the promised land and we'll use some more scriptures later to show this how that the Israel was blinded for whose sake for our sake had Israel not been blinded then the Gentiles would not not come in and God had ordained it that way because really you are the mystery of God the fact that he would have a gentile bride that was hidden in the Old Testament prophesied in the Old Testament so there Israel's Fallen away made way for the bride the Gentiles to be brought in as heirs to the Covenant and so just as you see IMC and his family falling away it's their Disobedience but what does It Make Way for Ruth to come into the promise and be part of the lineage of Christ so we see that parallel through it but I want you you to remember how that IMC and and by virtue of his wife following him his sons going out with him they are foreshadowing and acting out Israel's Disobedience because God brought the famine in Israel because of their Disobedience God had said if you don't obey me then there's going to be famine that comes in the land if you don't do what I ask you to do then you're going to be suffer suffering Natural Things I'll withhold the blessings of the ground and so as God is judging Israel by famine IMC instead of seeking God and repenting he runs I want you to ponder that how that what he did instead of staying in the Promised Land staying where he was supposed to do in atoning for and making right what he could he actually leaves the promised land and brother Brandon makes this statement we've read part of this before but we're going to read a little bit further down and brother Brown opens up some more details to this he says Redemption beautiful story of redemption I believe for the next few moments let's view something a beautiful story comes into my mind a book that's shorten the Bible and gives out the very very lines of redemption remember that the very lines of redemption and that's the Book of Ruth so the Book of Ruth gives out the lines of redemption it is the screenplay it is the script it is the book that tells you the boundaries and the storyline and the theme of redemption many people just pass over that book but it's the most beautiful story of the Lord Jesus almost almost of the Old Testament and then he adds this and this is where we left off before during the time of the judges when the first thing there come a time when Israel got away from God and when they did the water supply Supply was withheld and when people get away from God today the water supply is withheld all other blessings will be withheld so God is brother bam is connecting something that is within our power within our control many times that we ought to be doing something we ought to be acting we ought to be heeding the voice of God doing what he asked us to do stop doing what he told us not to do and by virtue of not doing what we know is the right thing that's how blessings are withheld and so he's pointing out that in the time of Judges when this famine Came Upon the land of Israel and how there was a famine in Bethlehem Judah it was not because of poor farming tactics on imc's part it wasn't just because it was just a uh the Farmers Almanac called for it that year but it was a direct result of Israel getting away from God and when Israel got away from God the droughts came and the and the droughts coming the plants would not grow the wheat would not grow the corn would not grow so he's saying they got people got away from God and the water supply is withheld he says when we get away from God what happens our blessings are withheld now in two other places he makes this point he says in the Book of Ruth it's a very beautiful picture how that Boaz the type of Christ how that Naomi went over in a strange country as a backsliding went out of the land and brought back with her Ruth and when Ruth came back she was out of the country of Moab and when she came back she was a moit absolutely a picture of the Gentile Bride of the church so he's identifying how that Ruth is a type of the Gentile bride so we identify with Ruth from that vantage point and he's saying that as they backslid in as they went into uh the land of Moab Ruth comes back with Naomi as a type of the Gentile bride but notice he identifies the journey into Moab as backsliding he says they went out of the land so they had been given a Promised Land they had been given borders that they ought to stayed in and God's judgment within that land was not the release that they needed to go back to what they had been called out of just because there was a famine in the land it didn't exempt God's promise of blessing it didn't exempt it didn't take away God's promise to care it was only a sign post to them that something's not right repent and make things right but instead as we mentioned before IMC instead of repenting Ran So notice how he identifies it as a backsliding then the message God has a way provided he says in the Book of Ruth many of you run over the top of that not thinking what it is that's one of the most greatest stories in there of a type of Christ in all the Old Testament the first chapter of the Book of Ruth he says the word Naomi means Pleasant so this is one of the greatest stories in the old Old Testament now he's even looking at the names as we have of what these characters mean he says the name Naomi means Pleasant she her husband and her two Sons left Palestine a type of the church so he's identifying how you can even see now the type of the church not just Israel but a type of the church and they left Palestine went over in the land of Moab and there they homesteaded out of the Homeland this is the problem they left the Homeland they left where they were called to be they went into Moab he says that's a symbol of backsliding like Israel did so when we see immc leave with his wife and two sons out of Bethlehem Judah it's a symbol of backsliding and you say oh but Ruth came out of it that just goes to show how God uses all things to work together for the good and doesn't excuse or Justify our backsliding but we look at this the act of IMC leaving with his family into Moab he says as a symbol of backsliding like Israel did any Jew that left Palestine was out of the will of the Lord and there's still a very rich uh tradition amongst the the rabic teachings and in Israel and a certain uh laws that they hold that says that you cannot be blessed outside of the promised land and that an Israelite should not be dwelling outside of the promised land and so the Jews that left Palestine were out of the will of God God gave Palestine to the Jews and said remain there this is what God Said God said this is your land you've entered into it I'll drive out the enemies from before you as long as you serve me and do that which is right in my sight I will protect you and I will guard you but if you start doing wrong expect these things to happen so the answer when things bad start happening was not to leave the promised land but do a little self-examination say well why are these things happening what's taking place let's call upon god let's get our lives right let's steady the ship let's let's repent instead of repenting this is a sign of backsliding not only had is Israel backslide but now IMC runs from God and it's a sign of this stubbornness and refusing to Humble himself in Jeremiah chapter 3: 19-22 today I was reading many different scriptures that refer to backslid in so that we can kind of kind of catch the context of what it means to backslide is this uh bo IMC leaving Mo leaving to Moab is a sign of backsliding in Jeremiah 3:1 19-22 it says but I said this is God speaking how shall I put thee among the children and give thee a pleasant land and a goodly Heritage of the host of Nations and this is exactly what Israel was it was a pleasant land how how am I going to do this how am I going to bless the especially at this time in light of their disobedience he says and I said Thou shalt call me my father and shalt not turn away from me it's even speaking of a of an adoption surely as a wife treacherously departed from her husband so have you dealt treacherously with me oh House of Israel sayith the Lord a voice was heard upon the high places weeping in supplications of the children of Israel for they have perverted their way and they have forgotten the Lord their God return ye backsliding children backsliding seems to be a peculiar phrase and I guess maybe we hear it a lot of times in different context but it's a scriptural word he calls them backsliding children even as a wife deals treacherously with her husband calls them backsliding children and I will heal your backsliding if you return says behold we come unto thee for thou art the Lord Our God so in this even these scriptures we can see how that Israel the land was a pleasant land they were to be given a goodly place among all other nations and they were to be given an honor and a Heritage of the host of Nations and they are to turn to God those who had turned away and he says ye backsliding children so that I can heal your backsliding in backsliding means to turn away that's what it means to to to backslide it's a turning back it speaks of apostasy where there's an abandonment of Truth now we could we could use this to refer to anyone who would reject full out reject truth and say one time I believed in this but now I rejected one time I used to believe in this uh but now I don't believe it anymore we say Well that's a that's a backliner someone leaves Christianity someone rejects the message of the hour and they used to believe it and they used to go to church or maybe there's no clear rejection of the word of God but they're serving God and then they go back out in the world and we say they're backslid but it's important for all of us to understand that if if if it's merely turning away or some letting go of Truth or abandonment of Truth it it even speaks of losing a fervency and a passion for something that used to ardly believe in and and God that's his rebuke even of the Le Deans is you're not hot nor cold you're just kind of lukewarm that was a backsliding condition it doesn't have to be a total repudiation of Truth it can just be getting numb where you are just going along with the flow just resigning that this is just the way things are just going through the motions and that's a backsliding so it doesn't have to be going into the world it doesn't have to be rejecting Truth uh uh you know overtly and letting everyone know that I hate the truth I don't believe in God there's nothing to Jesus Christ it can just be a turning away and a removing from where you once were or some letting go of Truth and we could we could even say it in this this way that for a Believer we backslide when we fail to go forward we ought to be advancing so just staying in the same place is in that way uh kind of going against the momentum of the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit wants to go forward the light is always moving forward truth is always advancing and always going forward so we must continue to walk in truth so that we don't come into this complacent condition just a numbness and L fair and anything goes and it doesn't really matter we got to stay fervent and passionate otherwise that's a backsliding in 1 John 1:7 it says but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanseth us from all sin so in order to be in Fellowship one with another in order to be in that cleansing flood of the blood of Jesus Christ being purged of all iniquity being washed growing and maturing properly in the things of God we must walk in the light and and that should create the image of advancement that there's some sort of moving there's some sort of progress that and it also should understand that the light continues to move the light is going on the light is advancing so we must walk in that light to stop or to stand still and to fail to go forward in the light can be a backsliding and so brother brandham identif ifies that IMC and his family were backsliding when they left Bethlehem Judah to go into Moab and so IMC just kind of catch this image he was rebelling against God's correction instead of relenting to it if if he had been stubborn at all if he had been well this is the way we ought to do things and God's already abandoned us and I'm sick and tired of this happening I'm sick and tired of that happening instead of letting go of his own ideas and his own pride and just giving in the dealing of God instead of repenting he becomes more OB subate inv vacates the land that God gave him he ought to have looked at those fields he ought to looked at Bethlehem Judah and said God gave this to me God drove out my enemies from before me this is an inheritance of God this land right here is to me the word made flesh this is the word tangible this is a promise of God that has been materialized God gave our Father Abraham This Promise he said that we would go soldier in a Strange Land but then he would bring us out he was standing on the evidence of De he was standing on the Vindication of God's promise to Israel he was standing and living in a place that spoke of God's goodness towards Israel he should have said no matter how bad things are if this is God's judgment he ought to give an end to God's correction say Lord forgive me I'm sorry I'm wrong he should have relented and repented and then God could have brought back Health to the land but instead he abandons this precious land and we can see that this was Rebellion on imc's part not only in the way that it's characterized by brother brandham but also again into what unfolds later here's in Ruth chapter 1 verse4 as we read it it speaks of one of the two sons it says and they took or both the sons and they took them wives of the women of Moab the name of the one was orpa and orpa comes from the Hebrew word stiff neck or obstinate you better ask what your wife the girl you like ask her what her name means first so I've never heard that before does that mean but this name it it speaks of being stiff necked or obstinate or rebellious to be stubborn this is the very meaning that is given even if it would be after the fact because uh when they would give names uh traditionally and in ancient times they would ascribe some meaning to the name and we know there's a meaning behind the name we're taught to be prayerful about what we would name our children and this orp is derived from being stiff neck something stubborn or obstinate and it's reflected now what uh Rebellion is been reflected immc because now his son is taking a woman as a sign now that the act of them leaving uh Bethlehem Judah was not just a man looking to provide for his family it wasn't merely an act of desperation because times were bad but it was an act of rebellion against God so a son takes a woman a moabit to wife and her name means stiff neck speaking of his own stubbornness of his father and Rebellion notice what the scripture says about being stiff neck there's a lot that I could have read in this regards too in 2 Chronicles 30:8 now be you not stiff necked as your fathers were but yield yourselves unto the Lord to be stiff neck you resist God God's dealing with you it's kind of like that I when you when you're going to punish somebody and they're say well that didn't hurt or you yeah that's fine do that you could do whatever you want it's more obstinate and stiff necked and this isn't going to hurt that's not going to bother me there's nothing you can do to sway me and he says now be not stiff NE as your fathers but yield yourselves unto the Lord they were resisting God they were resisting his dealings instead of becoming more repentant and more contrite they got more stubborn more opposite to the point to where they leave and they abandon the promise then but the Bible says be not stiff neck as your father but yield un the Lord and enter into his Sanctuary this is the opposite of what IMC does which he has Sanctified forever and serve the Lord your God that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you when one of the sons of IMC took orpa to wife it was a sign of being obstinate it signified the rebellion and the stubbornness of how this family was not willing to yield themselves unto the Lord and in the face of his wrath and his fierceness that he was judging them said God we're sorry align us back up with your word we'll do those things which are right in your sight this is a sign of them further rebelling now let me just point out some things very quickly as we come to the part that I'm wanting to amplify this evening so we've looked at how these different aspects how it was in the time when the judges rule it's famine that causes on the surface what causes IMC to go from Bethlehem Judah and de Moab and last time we were going through verse two the name of the man was ALC and the name of his wife Naomi ALC means my God my king what did it foreshadow that Israel was going to reject God as their King and want to take to the eles an Earthly King and then here's Naomi who means pleasantness but she's going to come back bitter the name of his two sons Mahan and kilion which means uh sickness and wasting completely wasted and pining and consumption to be consumed and so even their sons are carrying these names ephes of Bethlehem Judah and how this identified this place that had special significance in the history of the children of Israel that right here was born a child that was called to the mother the son of sorrow but to the father he was to be the man of my right hand and how Christ was signified and foreshadowed in this birth to Rachel thousands of years hundreds of years before the birth of Christ who was born right there in that same area right there in that same time we were looking at each one of these meanings and these phrases and where we stopped was at this part and they came into the country of Moab and continued there now I've been studying on Moab and The more I've studied more I thought well I mean this could be one of those places you get lost and uh and well they clearly were lost when they got there but this is as you study you can get lost in the subject of Moab oh my goodness there's so much here there's so much here and so I am Imp purposing in my heart to be briefer than before and if that seems somewhat ambiguous then maybe that was intentional uh but to not be labored this point because to take it another step further than this would almost take us too far into this to I really want us to ponder the full weight of what was taking place place when they left Bethlehem Judah so think of this in your in your hearts tonight where did they leave when ALC Naomi Mahan and kilon left Bethlehem Judah what were they leaving so it's not just the city all Bethlehem but what they were leaving as we really think about break it down and disal it down to ultimately what was it they left they left God's promise this was the Promised Land but not just a land it was the materialization of the promised word all the prophecies that have been expressed are now materialized before them they're fulfilling the prophecy they're where the promised land was to be this is the ultimate place for them to be gathered together the rest would be now them perfecting their borders in possessing every inch they they weren't the promise to them was not well we got another we want to conquer this region and we need to build an Empire God had made it very simple I'm going to give you this land and this is going to be your land this is going to be your territory and so and it wasn't again I want to identify it just wasn't merely the land the land spoke to the greater promise that God said I will be your protector I'll be your provider I will be your pleasure so when they leave Bethlehem Judah they're not just leaving a place that had been afflicted by famine but they were leaving God's promise word they were leaving where God said I will be your provider they were leaving where God said I will be your protector they were leaving where the word of God ought to give them and provided for them everything that they would have need of this is the thing that they're leaving and as they're leaving remember this is not an exodus this is not the children of Israel leaving Egypt this is not uh uh this is not a fulfillment of children being in bondage in Babylon and coming back to the temple we're working in Reverse of what the Exodus was God brought them out of Egypt brought them across the Red Sea and brought them through the land of Moab and caused them to cross the Jordan River and entered the promised land but now they're going to the other side of the Jordan River this is not an exodus we cannot think of what a Lim's doing is progress just because he was moving and going to another place and seeking something out that this is progress but the the the the the place of his journey where he was journeying to is what reveals just what a backsliding this was he doesn't seek another place in Israel you could even uh you could even considered that the fact that it says there was famine in the days when the uh the judges rulle that there was famine in the land and that only it tells us the story of a man leaving Bethlehem Judah that maybe it was more specific in Regional that this great place that was known for its abundance of crops and Good Earth and a place that was very verdant and had Abundant Life is is suffering they don't go to any other place in Israel was there no other family was there no other provision was there's not some place where they could take soless and comfort and other believers but no they leave and they go to Moab going to Moab was the biggest signal to us that what they were doing was not progress or following the leadership of the Lord where did they go Moab they leave God's promise and go to Moab and remember why did they leave we could break it down this way they left because of the abundance in Moab yes there was a famine in Israel but it was the abundance in Moab it was something about Moab that was drawing them to it and if we were to take it and say well was a man who was who had a job and things got really tough and he's there was no no really work to be had and this was tight and money was getting really really tight the economy in his area was uh tearing down so he took his family and left and moved and went to this other area where the economy was booming and the numbers were up and everything was seemed to go great and he moved there to get a job and to provide for his family and that's exactly what immc was doing and we can say that even today in our terms that from a worldly view this move would be understood oh you're economy was going tank and the market was horrible there where you were there were no jobs where you were and uh and that's why that's why you moved to this place where there was more jobs and more economic opportunities more upward Mobility a better job opportunity from a worldly perspective they would understand it uh they would encourage it they would applaud it man said yeah I moved and I moved to this state and I moved here to get a better job or I took this position because had a had better a better benefits package we would the world would look at at that they would applaud it they would say that's the way to do it you ought to be looking out after yourself that was great but from a word view I want you just to ponder this us as individuals tonight I said well brother Aaron I really wanted you to preach on the open of the seventh seal and how that's going to give us Rapture and condition well this is part of it this is absolutely part of don't think you can just live lasciviously and be claiming to walk in in the light of the seventh seal don't think that you could be forsaking the word of God and the things that the word teaches and you're grasping and getting hold of the of this message no it's an impossibility but from a word view they were forsaking the spiritual benefits made available to them in the promised land from a worldly view they're they're leaving and he's going to get a better job from a worldly view he's accepting a position with greater benefits from a worldly view he's taking care of his future from a worldly view he's taking care of his family from a worldly view he's making the necessary decisions to be sure that he is getting the assets that are required to build wealth and to take care of his family and preserve his future but from a word view he's actually forsaken the things that mean the most we ought to be able to relate to him from a spiritual standpoint that the advantages that were afforded to him from a spiritual standpoint that is what he's forsaking yeah there might be better crops in Moab there might be better things in Moab there might be more opportunities and a better job and better retirement Moab but what about everything you're leaving in Israel is this not where God promised to bless you is this not where your inheritance is is this not where the inheritance there's a law that protects your children is this not where your inheritance is protected by leaving this and abandoning this how have you preserve for your children there's a better promise in Israel and I believe that all of us ought to challenge ourselves when we go to make decisions and ask am I make the decision I'm making yeah it makes a lot of sense from a worldly standpoint but does it make sense from a word standpoint are you willing to forsake spiritual benefits and spiritual privileges and spiritual advantages for the sake of a worldly advantage it's what aimc did and I think it's too easy to evaluate the upside of a decision based upon the natural things very easy to look at a decision and say well if I do this I can get more money if I do this I can I have more vacation if I do this and we start looking at things we evaluate it from a natural standpoint it's very easy to kind of run the numbers and say well this looks like it's a better opportunity but let me say that the believer has a different entry in their balance sheet and and that holds a greater value then and bonuses and paid time off and health benefits and we can look at the things of God and say I cannot make this decision to flee into another place that does not have provision for me spiritually like the place I'm in and a lot of people are willing to stay in a place because of the natural advantages completely disregarding all the spiritual chaos that's taking place around them right because they're not they're making the same decision aimc did in that they're being inactive looking at all the natural upsides instead of looking at the spiritual side ALC looked at the natural advantages of Moab but didn't consider the downside spiritually to leave the promised land we have to be very very careful when we evaluate decisions and opportunities and we ought to consider the gain or loss as it relates to the things that matter the most Paul said but what things are gain to me those I counted loss for Christ there's things that to the Natural man are gain and to the world is loss but in book the loss values greater like the the things are oh you're going to be rejected what for what sake Christ well that means more well if you do this you're not going to have that but what am I what am I going to have Christ well that means more we got to consider those things ought to ought to consider these the spiritual benefits that were Forsaken and this is what immc did not do so this land they left God's promise promas and they go to Moab because of the economics the natural things and look at Numbers chapter 24 and this will kind of open the door a little bit if you want to take time to look into these things and on your own you're going to see a prophet in Moab and you see that balum baale Feast of PE all these events take place in Moab think of those things and this is the place that immc goes back to but as we read this I want you to see that Moab was a country under a curse it was a land of idolatry it was a land of ungodliness it was a land of crime different places I've been reading spoke of just the ungodliness of the land and now here it says in numbers CH 24: 15 to 17 and he took up his Parable and said balam and now bam is speaking balum the son of beor hath said and the man the man whose eyes are open hath said Heath said which he heard the words of God and knew the knowledge of the most high which saw the vision of the almighty fallen into a trance but having his eyes open hears balam's pronouncement I shall see him but not now I Shall Behold Him but not nigh there shall come a star out of Jacob and a scepter shall rise out of Israel and shall Smite the corners of Moab and destroy all the children of sh death one translation said it shall destroy all the princes of Moab it says it shall Smite the corners of Moab it doesn't mean he's just can go over go dtin here and dtin there when it says the corns it means all of it to to the whole breadth of it everything about Moab so here's balam we know the story of balam how that he is supposed to prophesy a curse upon Israel for the benefit of the moabites and for the benefit of Moab but when he comes under this anointing he begins to prophesy that a star shall come out of Jacob a scepter power shall rise out of Israel and what is it going to do it's going to completely destroy and smite the corners all of Moab so Moab is a cursed Nation it's a cursed land it's a cursed country it's a place say look that they're going to be judged they're going to fall they're going to be torn down this is not a place you want to go and hang out this is not a place you want to go and live and while we're just trying to catch back up we're trying to get our feet underneath us and we're just going to go there for a while and the the lesson keeps coming up over and over I'm just going to souljour for a while we're just going to go for a while but we'll be back be very very careful the place you plan to visit because sometimes when you visit for the the wrong place for the wrong reasons getting out can be very very hard Naomi made it out but with the prize because when it came time for her to return she didn't return with the men in her life and so though they were going just to sojourn whereever they're wanting to go was a place that was under a curse I shall Smite the corners of Moab this was a prophecy that went forth Moab is going to be judged Moab is going to be condemned and what waited IMC and Moab and think of this and this is where we have the benefit of knowing the rest of the story and and and and reading this in conjunction to the things that have happened uh that we know happened later what awaited IMC he dies his two son dies what awaits Naomi and Moab Moab is already foreshadowed in the history of Moab as you read this it's so remarkable to me as immc goes into Moab little does he know that he could just read the history of Moab and get an idea about what's about to happen to him because the symmetry of the Book of Ruth and the beginnings of Moab are striking the parallels and the symmetry of how that in the Book of Ruth IMC with his wife and two sons flees into Moab but by the time his dealings in Moab are over elimin is dead and the two sons are dead and one woman is returning now with daughter-in-laws this symmetry to the origins of Moab is very very striking in Genesis chter 19: 36-37 I think I might be figuring this out I feel like I'm almost done and it's only two two minutes past eight maybe you're going to be able to make it to Culver tonight Genesis chapter 19 ver verses 36 to 37 now in Genesis 19 well we could even back up just to take the whole scene that's taking place God said I'm going to judge Sodom and Gomorrah Abraham is not living in Sodom gomorra he's not down in Sodom but he has these angels that visit him and one of them is the Lord that has a vision has a prophecy for Abraham regarding his wife Sarah and the other two angels are going to go what into Sodom to warn the people or to go into Sodom because there's judgment coming and there's a judgment that's coming on Sodom and lot is in Sodom we know the Angels go down there and even as Abraham pleaded with the Lord look if you could just find 50 righteous 40 30 10 finally God says what we can't find enough righteous we're going to judge Sodom and Gomora and these Messengers tell lot get out of Sodom with your wife and your daughters flee bom and don't stop just get to the mountain whatever you do don't stop keep going but in the story Lot's wife just takes a slight look back turned into a pillar of salt so she's judged because the the angel said don't even look back don't look for nothing and the story tells us that lot and his two daughters don't even fully obey the Angel's message but they stop in zir at to solder so to Z zoir and this is what happens there that while they're there the daughters realize well there's no heirs to for lot there's no Sons to continue his lineage so then uh they want to have children with him it says thus were both the daughters of lot with child by their father it it's obviously a very delicate subject and I know you understand what we're referring to thus were both the daughters of lot with child by their father and the firstborn beah son and called his name Moab the same as the father of the moabites unto this day so who are the moabites they're related to lot who is lot Abraham's nephew and so Moab in the very origin of this nation of Moab this is what their Beginnings think of their beginnings and how they were born through this relationship referred to in Genesis 19 these daughters have this son the son that is Born the firstborn is named Moab and he is now he is the beginning in the Genesis of the people of Moab or the moabites and so that's where it has its beginning and there's a certain meaning or symbolism that's now going to be associated with Moab from that moment on because lot is typed as the foolish virgin he's typed as the make believer he's typed as the unbeliever mo lot does not hold a very uh Pleasant place in scripture when you look at his example in his life and so there's a meaning or a symbolism that is intended when it says that IMC left Bethlehem Judah the house of God's praise the house of God's bread left Bethlehem Judah and goes into Moab and and they're going to a place whose beginning is very very dark whose beginning comes from a time of judgment and hurried Exodus out of Sodom and gamorra a failure to fully obey all the Commandments of the Lord a decision that is makes made amongst these daughters that is very very dark to bring forth these children and now this first child that comes forth is Moab and who is he who is he a son to lot and look at lot because there's a meaning that's intended in this in Genesis 13: 10-13 and lot lifted up his eyes and beheld all the plain of Jordan that it was well watered and everywhere before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah even as the garden of the Lord like the land of Egypt as thou comest unto Zoar which is this land is on is near Jordan in the land that would be considered Moab it's the country of Jordan now the nation of Jordan now is where Moab would have been and so lot is drawn to this area why because it's well watered everywhere why is he drawn to it it's like a garden of the Lord so he would lot said Abraham said you choose what did notot choose based upon oh this looks nice this looks pleasing this this this looks really good verse 11 then lot chose him all the plain of Jordan and Lot journeyed East and they separated themselves one from the other Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan and lot dwelt in the cities of the plain and pitched his tent toward Sodom I we think well this is wise I mean this is prudent that's what if you were given a choice of well-watered planes what would you choose he chose what would have been more economically beneficial he chose the one that had more advantages this is why he chose the well-watered plains but it revealed something in lot's character but the men of Sodom were Wicked and sinners before the Lord exceedingly even though the Bible tells us that it vexed his righteous Soul it was something that he did not have the appropriate fear over that he ultimately assimilated himself into the culture and the people of Sodom I say assimilated himself in the culture he eventually moves in amongst them and he's existed among them to where he would have been the subject of the Judgment had he remained but just as immc chose Moab because it was well watered and had abundance Moab has its beginning with lot and lot chose a very same area because it was well watered and it was the G it was like the garden of the Lord so chooses just like lot had chosen that's where he's going in Genesis chapter 19 lot is in zor with his two daughters and his wife well he's in zoah with his two daughters but had lost his wife as he was fleeing Sodom and gomorra and so here's In This Very land in this very area who's going to be the father of Moab when Moab is birth as a nation when moab's going to come forth now remember one day Alm is going to come but before it comes here's a man and his two daughters with his wife having just died and the son Moab is born and what happened in the story of Ruth we just read it Naomi was left in Moab without her husband without her two sons after LMC dies with two daughter-in-laws just as lot is there with his two daughters and births the nation of Moab the symmetry now with the Book of Ruth that now Naomi is going to be right back there now with two daughter-in-laws one has been judged it one has been judged their wife has been judged he's been cast out of Sodom and gor judgment is coming on the places that he once lived and fellowship in now Naomi's experience a similar kind of judgment it's remarkable Symmetry and the firstborn daughter bore a son and called his name name Moab Moab means of his father of lot of his father or seed of his father and I'm I'm going to end on this this part right here it was a son of lot and lot means covering that the mobites now are sons of lot the seed of lot lot the make believer lot the foolish virgin lot the one who's just playing Church the the lot the one who could not follow could not make the right decision about Sodom and Gomorrah who could not obey the Angel's testimony comeing to flee Sodom completely don't stop keep going go go all the way but he stopped short and settles in Zar the moabites are the sons of lot the moabites are of his father the seed of his father lot which means covering and this is what is meant in fleeing to Moab brother B says this you probably already thought about where I'm going with this that's what a covering is but this is what's represented in going to Moab God hiding himself in Simplicity this is the one that was preached in Albuquerque brother B says in the beginning when man sinned it showed the nature of man what's important for us is to not look at immc as a sympathetic historical figure but to even recognize him as an image of us what could be our base instincts what could be our our weaknesses what could be our downside brother says in the beginning when man send it showed the nature of man he's always trying to hide from God and make himself a way that he can feel Justified a religion religion is a way for man to feel Justified that's been a religion means a covering a religion means a covering so he tried to make his own religion now this is the image that brother Bam's trying to bring before us that when man makes a mistake when he does something wrong instead of making it right he tries to justify himself and in order to find support for his justifications he builds a religion can accumulate different quotes or different ideas different theologies different ways and certain traditions and so he can stand behind all these things say well how can I be wrong look at how many others believe this how can I be wrong look at all these different things look at the blessings look at the benefits look at this and hides behind this as a way to justify himself and make him feel that he is covered with God this is the this is in the beginning when man sinned it showed man's nature instead of just coming to God as he is and saying I'm sorry he tries to make a way to feel Justified and that's what religion is is a way to self justify and he calls it a covering and this is I believe this is one of the images that is meant to come up when we see IMC leaving the judgments of God trying to avoid the judgments of the god in Bethlehem Judah and traveled to a place of Moab Moab is seed of lot seed of My Father which which means covering it was a place IMC is trying to cover his own Disobedience and outrun the judgments of God in Genesis 3: 7 to8 it says the eyes of them both were open it's speaking about Adam and the woman after they had partaken of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and the eyes of both of them were open and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons and they heard the voice of the Lord God walking Walking In The Garden in the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the Trees of the garden had they eaten of a tree of the garden literally I doubt that they would have hidden among the trees in the garden right kind of like a kid trying to hide the fact that he ate a cookie out of the cookie jar by hiding behind the cookie jar so just another evidence I believe in scripture of the allegory the image and the analogy of partaking to the fruit of the knowledge of tree of e good and evil is symbolic but now we see the guilty hiding from the presence of God Among the Trees of the garden think of how I silly it is think of even we try to get the image of you know even the the the kid eating the cookie out of the cookie jar and you look at him said did you eat a cookie and and the cookie jar and it's like then why are there chocolate chips all over your face it's like I don't know there's not any chocolate chips on my face this is just almost how foolish it was God you you do know God's going to know what you did even if you go sew yourself together you know some fig leaves you do know God knows God's calling for you you do know you can't hide from God but this is the foolishness of a religious covering this is is how indoctrinated people can be and how much in bondage they can be and how shortsighted they are to think well I'm escaping God's judgment or it really doesn't matter and it's just a phase and this is not going to bother me and everything's going to be okay when the auar said hold on wait a minute we've done something wrong God forgive us we shouldn't have done it they run from it brother battle identifies that the Instinct in man even to this day is to try to cover up instead of relent to try to cover up instead of repent justify well but this and but that and this that and the other instead just saying God I'm sorry this is exactly what ALC was doing I'll try to get my family out of this situation we're going to work harder uh we're going to work smarter not harder we're going to go to Moab and we're going to figure this out and we're going to save some money and we're going to get out of this problem we're going to go back and we're going to buy the ranch again and everything's going to work out it doesn't matter we're just leaving for a little bit we'll be back message don't worry we're coming back where are you moving the middle of nowhere North Dakota is there a church there no but we'll be back there Believers there no but will be back and this is what I want you to ponder tonight as we close it was God is bringing this image up he mentions it twice there in these first two verses in the country of Moab into the country of Moab it's a theme that's repeated quite often in the book the moit the moit the moit the moit it's something that's not just it's not just there to give us some historical cont context or some geographical reference I believe it means something and I believe that if we could even catch the hidden revelation of what Moab represents we can begin to understand more how God is wanting to deal with us in this time and in this day that if you could catch the revelation of what he is in this story and what he is to you and how to accept him this is what brother Brandon want us to do I think there's something that we can see in this image of Moab brother Ram says in the message conferences oh the hour the tremendous time that we are living in and when men are told of their error instead of trying to come back and say father I'm wrong forgive me they still hide behind the Fig leaves it's still the problem today fig Lea is fig leaves are what they sewed together the word religion means a covering now this is I would say this is a prophetic definition how that the the certain a religion to be to be dedicated to some precepts to be dedicated to a particular ideology or theology is just a covering for man's sin instead of accepting the true sacrifice and the true way to Salvation the word religion means a covering they tried to make themselves themselves a handmade covering and man hasn't changed yet today we must challenge ourselves with this image of Moab that it still exists within mankind today to justify and make it excuses instead of saying I'm sorry instead of owning up to it and making it right and doing what they ought to do well I do this and I do that and it's okay this it's okay that Moab represents religion Moab was the son of lot who means covering our Moab is a religious covering so what does Moab represent to us in this story think about it are you thinking it's what Ruth was called out of I I I've set it up this way in talking about immc going in and imc's rebellion and immc stubbornness and his obstinance and his own son marrying orpa who stiff necked and and all these images on this one side of this negative side this dark side and we can represent now Moab who is the son of lot the seed of his father of of his father which was covering in the history of lot and the nature of lot and the nature of the mobites and the curse of upon Moab and everything that Moab represents that's where Lim like fled but that's not the point because I I'm not speaking to you as aex the point is this is what God calls roof out of that's that's not where you're going that's not where you're headed even if it's position in the beginning to say well you got to be careful don't make the sins of of ALC but yes we could use that in a way to challenge ourselves to make sure that we're looking at the right factors when we make a decision but above all it's the mindset it's the condition it's the attitude it's the religious covering that God is wanting to call us out of as the Gentile bride this is what Ruth was delivered from this is the great Proclamation when she says your people will be my people your God will be my God it's it's it's it's a signpost to us that this is what God wants to take us out of is is something that can be closely related to the message as lot was oh it can be so close it can sh share so many same fundamental ideas it can share the same worship of the same God but yet what God had to do is she couldn't find redemption in Moab she couldn't find relationship in Moab the Gentile bride has got to come out of Moab to find her Boaz and this is what the bread of life is calling us out of today when it says the living bread of life bringing forth the bride is to call us out of our moabi is condition to completely change our our identity as Aaron the Gentile Elizabeth the Gentile L the Gentile and we're to change our mindset of Gentile human this is what we are to where we can finally come to the place where we believe that we are who we are in God's election and according to God's word and so God is calling us out of Moab to Redemption the living bread of life today what it's doing right now in your life you could just stop for a moment say all right I'm going to take a deep breath Culver is open to at least nine we still have some time yet what is God doing in my life right now we we know you're not in Moab we know you're not somewhere in the Middle East you're not in denominations you're not caught up in the world you're here tonight but what is the living bread of life still trying to do for you to bring the full Revelation that you are Christ Ruth you're what you're what he wanted it's what he wanted to redeem you're part of his program you're part of his not but not let me take that back you're you're the very center of his program and the living Bread of Life Today is still calling you out of a moabites mindset and it's the remedy to a moabi US religion we don't want to be message mobites I want to say it again I want to get a real hearty amen we don't want to be message moabites I think we can close we don't want to be that and so what does it mean go ahead and study in the message start re start looking at what it means to be a moabit in the message and how brother Brandon placed this nation I'm reminding myself I was going to be short let me just say this so you can start thinking about it brother bam says that Moab always looked down on Israel why would you want to support something that looks down on you why would you want to be a part of something that belittles you dehumanizes you dechristianize you if given the chance would just use you and let go of you like that that's what Moab represents that's what this living bread of life is calling you out of let's stand to our feet tonight it's nice to have you back brother Micah trust your trip was a blessing we bow our heads in prayer the living bread of life is our remedy to a moabit religion the message of the hour in its pure form is trying to call us out of these mindsets these attitudes these behaviors [Music] if you need a touch in your heart just lift your hand to the Lord tonight I believe he wants to touch you he wants to strengthen you wants to encourage you don't be frustrated as fellowship with somebody here recently and they expressed how that they just realized after 50 years or so of something that they'd been battling with their whole lives something that always plagued them they couldn't ever get past and that God had just brought it was just bringing him to the realization of it and it seemed that maybe there was some discouragement in the realization and I said my just think of the grace that after all these years he's not done trying to show you after all these years he's still willing to say no this this is what's holding you back my child and tonight let's not be discouraged if you hear the voice of God walking in the cool of the day don't hide just say Here I Am Lord I know I've made mistakes I know I failed I know as a treacherous wife I've dealt foolishly with you but now Lord I'm coming back will you heal my backsliding and make me whole if you're in Moab the message is not oh if you're in Moab and then you're a moabit and you can't be redeemed it's come out we're always going in keep inverting until we finally get it right you are not lost you are not forsaken you are not non-elect you're not foolish you're not Hellbound you are the Bride of Jesus Christ you're going to make it in any condition to the contrary it's God saying I can handle this that's what the word is for I can handle this let's just yield to that as the word of God said that let's not be stiff neck but yield yourselves unto the Lord and enter into his Sanctuary could you do that tonight yield yourselves unto the Lord our gracious Heavenly Father this is my prayer tonight Lord I I I I sense it and I feel it how that there's a press of resistance in the face of God's people as it were a screen or that or a jail cell Lord they can see past the bars like a plexiglass or a ceiling a glass it's there they can see beyond it but it just seems like they run right up against it and Lord I believe that [Music] it worse it's a mirage in other words father I believe that there is there's no reality to those chains there's no reality to that glass there's no reality to that screen that they are somehow withheld from it permanently that they can never get past it some ways lord it's just a learned response from all these dashed hopes and Broken Dreams and Lord tonight is if there be any believer that feels restrained and held back from your promises Lord may they just simply yield to you tonight and say Lord I'm just yielding to you I'm not afraid of finding out that I've done something wrong I'm not afraid to find out that my choices have been wrong I'm not afraid to find out that I've been on the wrong path I'm not afraid to admit that I've sinned and I've made mistakes because I'm coming to the one who can heal me of my backslidings Lord as long as I use a religious covering of my backsliding it can never be healed as long as I continue in this moabites mindset I can never be healed but Lord now I'm shaking off the nature of IMC I'm shaking off the nature of orpa I'm shaking off my my moabitas nature and nurture Lord and I'm yielding to you tonight the Lover of My Soul creator of The Thirst that's inside of me and I yield to you and say Lord remedy remedy what lacks heal what's broken and I pray that in the face of opposition in the face of of our worst moabitas instincts Lord you could heal us tonight set us free bless your people as we worship you as we turn to you to seal in these things seal these things in our hearts by the Holy Spirit Come amongst us again Lord and worship and receive it Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
