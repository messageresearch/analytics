TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we're going to continue on the subject of the kingdom and Heaven's mystery Earth's Glory I feel that it's important to remind you each service that that's the subject we're on because I might be focusing on something that seems so far away from this but it's this that has inspired me and with every service for me personally there's just a greater highlight that's coming to me a greater understanding what heaven's mystery was and is and what Earth glory is so we're not wanting to move beyond that and kind of using the phrase the kingdom to express that and that's a large thought in itself so remember that because we're going to tie back to some of those things later on in this service but now this morning it's part three of the two Edens uh the two Edens we could just simply State as God's Eden which we see in the beginning that God created and uh was there dressed and arrayed and placed and manplaced in the Garden of Eden address it and to till it there in Genesis 1 and Genesis 2. that's God's Eden and then which was formed through six thousand years and then we're looking at also Satan's Eden and what Satan was Desiring to accomplish and what he has accomplished through uh six thousand years and brother Branham says that these two Edens are perfect types and he uses I think we're going to read a statement here in a moment he uses Matthew 24 24 that the spirit will be so close that deceiving Spirit these false Christ and these false anointed ones there'll be such a manifestation an expression of those who are falsely anointed that it could be so close that it would deceive the very elect if it were possible and brother Branham uses that uh to say that Satan's Eden is such a mimic and such a twin and is a raid in such a way that but for God's election we could be deceived as well uh and and it is a contrast between two Edens we know that that God hadn't eaten in the beginning and as we talk about the kingdom let me say this and remind you that God God's objective is to restore Eden and to bring it back to restore us back to Eden and Christ is the mystery of God revealed it emphasizes that over and over again he says to restore the kingdom to its right position and in that Kingdom it's a kingdom where God's Not only worshiped but he's manifested and there's many that worship God and they could even worship the one who created the heavens and the Earth because they maybe they don't know him by name and they don't know his will and they don't know his intention and maybe not being knowledgeable of Christianity or the Bible they just said there must be a being and whoever this being is will worship Him and God's just not desirous that someone would worship him or worship the deity that created the heavens and the Earth but he's a God that wants to be known by his manifestation worshiped in spirit and in truth and there's something that God is wanting to accomplish and that's what this Kingdom represents and as Eden was lost to humanity and even Humanity change Satan has been building his Eden ever since then found his way in the Garden of Eden slipped in found a way to inject himself into the human bloodline into the human stream and he's been building through that his kingdom ever since the fall and just to hopefully give some context to focusing on Satan's Eden and and the worldly kingdoms and because I gotta I could understand the objection with hearing enough about the world we're hearing enough about laodicea we've heard enough about the things going on in politics and and where the church is at I and I understand that but to the extent that we'll focus on Satan's Eden we're doing it so that we can contrast the kingdom and and even to help us to understand that there may be a lot of things that might look uh shiny and like we want to reach out and we just want to touch it and we want to play with it like isn't this neat and in this awesome and we should have an appropriate respect for the fact that Satan will appear as an angel of Light it could be a lot of enticing things that draw Us in and do that so that by the Holy Spirit In Our Lives we're exercising discernment to say no thank you I want Christ I want the word I want that that thing that really Thrills my soul and so we're looking at Satan's Eden to understand to understand the contrast to the kingdom because Satan's Eden is anti-god it is anti-eden if we could say that anti-to the actual Eden that God wants to restore and and Satan's Eden is the Antichrist it's anti-word and we think anti-word would be a rejection of the word but it's it's not quite the rejection of it in the blatant obvious sense but the opposition to it in a very subtle way and in the God's power to transform brother Brahm says here notice the type of the two Edens so closely typed together to almost deceive the very elected Matthew 24 24 said it would be that way so there's the prophet saying Matthew 24 24 contains the comparison of two Edens but I want us to stop for a few moments and consider these two Edens and one thing especially how the Bible tells us that God's word did produce that Eden and how God's word warns us that the other Eden would come so that's very direct to Edens God's eating Satan's Eden God's word produced that Eden and God's word warns us that the other Eden would come and remember it's right there the title of the sermon God's power to transform and so that's he's not just historically looking back on God's power to transform a chaotic Earth in Genesis 1 2 into an earth of Nature and light and seasons and land and sea and animal life but it's God's power to transform now it's God's power to transform you God's power to transform the condition we're in God's power to transform what has been deformed into Satan's Eden God can transform it again into an Eden of Eternity and Glory now if Wednesday night we were looking at the two religions that came out of Eden we could summarize that very quickly as True Religion which would be the worship of God and spirit and Truth by Revelation and then also a false religion which even though it may seem to be projected to God it's actually a worship of Satan if God is not receiving it then it's it's almost by default this that glorifies Satan's objective that serves Satan's objective so two religions come out of Eden in the fall and the birth of Cain and Abel we come coming out of that there's two religions uh that are born and I think we're ending on that Wednesday night where program said there's only two religions and and that's remarkable because oh no no no there's over 45 000 different denominations but two religions that's it there there's uh denominations and then there's the truth and so there is uh that's just the reality that we should look at it so that we can understand just how precious it is to have true faith now in Genesis Chapter 4 verses three four and five I'm going to read this uh to kind of reset this point of diversion of these two religions and in the process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground and offering unto the Lord remember how in the garden that the use of symbolic language to say if you partake of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil that that would be a transgressions to God's word and the day that you eat thereof that day you die and that as soon as man had sinned he went and took the leaves from a fruit tree and and fashioned himself coverings once he knew that he was naked so when Cain offers this uh it's remarkable how that it might seem to line up with God's intent in the beginning that they offer fruit and and the the very thing that man was hid behind but yet Cain is bringing forth something that is not by Revelation it's not by faith and at the very time that Cain is bringing an offered it says in Abel he also brought of the first things of his flock and of the fat thereof and these are offerings unto the Lord this is worship of God this is intended to uh and I guess there's maybe a lot of ways that you can say it but a way to show honor or a veneration or to appease or to show respect to the one who spoke and the worlds which were created just even this Consciousness and awareness of why they were there and they're not wrestling with well how did we get here and why does this exist and that exists they just they knew that God God created the heavens and the Earth and here we are and there's only us and and in this tremendous Eden and there were some uh sense of the Divine in that they're told uh by even their parents and Cain brings this offering to the Lord which is the fruit of the ground Abel brings a sacrifice he slays the first thing of his flock and and he gives that this would have been a bloody stinking bloody sacrifice a mess that he is pouring out on this Altar and he offers it up to the Lord the Bible says in verse 5 verse 4 and the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering God regarded it and how that we know that we could take it just simply from the fact that the Bible tells us that God regarded it God had respect to it but it says but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect so what I I there's we could just take God in his word Moses writes and tells us that God regarded the one and respected one and didn't respect the other but yet the way in the manner in which he did it Cain recognizes that his offering has not been respected or re-honored or regarded so it says and Cain was very Roth and his countenance foul so God had some means of indication he had some means of declaring that I have accepted this sacrifice and and somehow had conveyed it to Able that I'm pleased with your Revelation I'm pleased with your faith in such a way to recain is looking at it and he is offended and it gets angry and and just notice kind of his Instinct instead of saying man Abel that that was amazing what just happened and I was sincere and I built a beautiful Altar and I took the things that I cultivated that I had access to of my own and yet yours just seemed messy and it seemed incongruent it seemed a little cruel and I mean a little insensitive there buddy but yet God respected yours and instead of humbling himself and saying maybe I can learn something from you uh maybe there's something I I want to worship God and spirit and truth I want my offering to be accepted instead of doing that he gets angry so there's that jealousy there's that Pride there's that all coming from that serpent that's bound up in him and he gets angry and we know that and this fit of anger at the time that he's angry God said why are you mad so then God is communicating with Cain and this is where Cain has this sense of something Beyond himself and he says why is it that you you are angry why are why are you mad if you'll just offer the sacrifice by Revelation I'll regard your offering as well and that's not enough for Cain in his anger and in his jealousy he slays his brother and that's I think that's important to remember is this murderous spirit in the beginning the birth of twins of Abel and Cain is what we recognize here in Genesis chapter 4 and the beginning of Satan's Eden this is the beginning of worldly kingdoms this is where we begin to recognize the tactics of Satan that Cain is worshiping and we give him a benefit of doubt he's sincere he means well he's worshiping he's given a sacrifice he's offering if that's all that God required certainly surely he would have accepted it but as soon as God corrects the basis or corrects the inspiration that's where he kind of shows his colors begins to resist the will of God begins to resist the presence of God so we see the tactics of Kate of Satan in Cain in this birth of twins and that that word they're twins is huge if we study the message of the hour how brother Branham uses that because Abel and Cain foreshadow Jesus and Judas and and we say well Jesus and Judas were types of uh Abel and Cain actually Abel and Cain Believe It or Not were foreshadows or types of what would culminate in Jesus and Judas because Judas is Judah from the tribe of Judah so here's one who's in the church he's an officer in the church he's one that nobody suppose that it was Judas when the question came up that one of you is going to betray you and everybody kind of looked around they probably said Judas you're the best tell us right you're from the tribe of Judah you dress the best you hold the bag everything you're you tell us what's going to happen here and nobody suppose themselves and so here's that twin that comes right up in the midst of the Revival comes right up next to Christ and that's what Cain and Abel were foreshadowing is that opposition and that contrast in uh Jesus and Judas and so what does Judas do he betrays Christ uh and essentially delivers him up to be murdered in the same manner in which Cain did his brother Abel and so in those twins represented in Abel and Cain Jesus and Judas you also have the True Vine in false Vine the true church the false Church in all those different ways that you could uh emphasize that same process of true life and false life being expressed in the sermon power of transformation and and so he preached God's power to transform in September then the the month later he preached the power of transformation and I'm reading from a few places here I've been kind of putting this off a little bit over the last few services and I know you're very familiar with this I I just want to emphasize this to see that brother banham put uh was was looking at something himself in tracking and seeing this Satan's Eden how it developed and where it's at now he says don't forget this little flock the church in the last days is going to be twins so close it'll deceive the elected remember his theme in both of these transformation sermons to Edens in that use of that scripture so close it'll deceive the elected Matthew 24 24. the church is going to it's a Pentecostal move and that's a remarkable statement it's so much like the real thing till it would deceive the very elected if it was possible now if I could say this just to caution us he says it's a Pentecostal move and in saying that the church is going to be a Pentecostal move and he's talking about the false because he says it'll be it's so much like the real thing to deceive the very elected if it was possible now what you don't want to make the mistake of is oh if it's a Pentecostal move I'm gonna I'm gonna shoot at it and attack it and tear it down because it's the false but remember it's so close like the real thing that it would deceive the very elective possible so don't make don't let Satan draw you offsides into the same kind of spirit that he's of by trying to oppose something that you think is anti wherein you ought to concern yourself with being what is truth in the truth and not somebody oh if it's a Pentecostal move I hate Pentecost well you've got to be careful there because Brethren even used that nomenclature to describe the very move of God in the last days and so to the extent that Pentecost is genuine and in the word of God and moving in the light of God's word that's what we want to be we want to be original Pentecost we need to be restored back to the original tenets and Faith of Our Pentecostal fathers I know there's a lot of depth and understanding to what that is and so just because Satan brings up the false we need to be careful that we don't hate The False Image at the expense of not embracing the truth or causing us to reject the true because we hate so much the false and I know there's a lot to that and I trust that you you have a little bit of Grace if I'm not articulating that just it with the perfect balance so it says and little later on if I get the chance I want to explain how that election comes it's going to deceive them because it's almost like the same thing just two fathers that's all same mother same church same movement same thing and that's where we come back to the beginning to see this pattern happen in the very very beginning with two different fathers but the same womb the betting ground is the same where the word Falls but one of them like care is perverted one of them is a perversion because it's the wrong father which I will prove someday if God will let me the denomination is the mark of the beast now that's a statement it's quite a statement that denomination is the mark of the beast and there are and even at the time in theologians and Scholars would probably argue that all the other denominations are mark of the beast but ours isn't and maybe a lot of Protestants could agree that the Catholic church is the mark of the beast but protestantism isn't and here brother Brown is saying sorry I'm gonna lump you all together I'm going to take all the tears and bind them up and I'm going to separate out the tears I'm gonna separate the world the kingdoms out I'm going to separate out Satan's and I'm going to separate out the mimics I'm going to separate all the false religions and I'm going to bind them up for their judgment and at this time of the Harvest because he's preaching Harvest Time right in this season I'm going to take out we're going to separate out the true the true wheat and the elect so that they're not judged with the tares so when he says denomination is the mark of the beast that's quite a statement and that is more I see that's more in where brother Brown's emphasizing this as we continue to read he says it's the wrong father he's stirring people to an organization instead of the word it's the wrong father it's a cane move and there is we have just in our nature and however you want to blame that does your finder go as far back to Cain if you want but we have in our nature a desire for order and for Symmetry and humans are wired to identify patterns even if there isn't one that's why we can look at a cloud and say do you see the dog in the sky right because we just kind of wired that way to see things and see patterns and see things kind of emerge I'm like I've noticed this like well that's not really an intentional pattern it's just something that we're kind of wired to recognize and to see so we we like organization uh we we like we like gnome things and and we like things to be a certain way and Satan having designed us if I could say that kind of knows what our bent is in our humanity and will provide us the necessary structure and the Optics so that we can kind of feel like okay yeah this is good I like this this will work this will work this is this will appease my desire to be message or this will appease my desire to be Christian or to worship but to go to church and so he says but he says it's a cane move and then it's this this statement that I'm that he's kind of building to when I go home this time I'm preaching on the subject the trail of the serpent and the phrase this it's the secondary phrase to me that's the most important the beast at the beginning and the Beast at the end now that's just it was just me I'm not going to try to cause you to highlight one over the other but the trail of the serpent the beast at the beginning the beast at the end entrail him right through the Bible and show how he heads up and you'll get that on the telephone you see and he says I'll do this if the Lord permits I don't think I have maybe have that one there he says I'll get this if the Lord permits me to so he had even this sense maybe I'm not going to get a chance to speak it he says he said I want you to watch how cunning this fellow is now he refers to this title the trail of the serpent five more times or at least five times in the last few months of his ministry The Trail Of The Serpent and and this this secondary phrase the beast at the beginning the beast at the end kind of amplify the troller serpent so when he mentions the trail of the serpent he's tracking the beast at the beginning which we could say the serpent was the most subtle beast of the field and this Beast that raises up in the Book of Revelation at the end he said this is the serpent we're going to Trail him through the Bible and it's not so much trailing Through the Bible That's not the big thing it's in the Bible anybody can do a word search Scholars for years could take the beast in the Genesis 3 because it's there Genesis 3 is most subtle beast and go to Revelation and just do a word search and you can find all the places where Satan was there whether you want to see the opposition between Jacob and Esau and see the opposition between Israel and Babylon and all these different kingdoms that raise up you could see Satan's agenda and you can see him there with Judas and you could see him opposing the church and they're in the Pharisees all the different places you can see the the trail of the serpent Through the Bible but that's not real the real mystery is it's where he heads up there's a lot of scholarship on the serpent from the beginning there's even that phrase the trail of the serpent wasn't original to brother Branham but that wasn't the inspiration the mystery isn't just to Trail them in the Bible from Genesis to Revelation but it's where he ends up now it's the beast at the end not even in symbolic form in Revelation but what he's come to in the very end time so he says in the sermon trying to do God a service without it being his will very very very near is the last sermon this is a Brother's breakfast a Minister's breakfast in Shreveport I'm preaching because I wouldn't preach it in brother Jack's Church he'd tell me go ahead and do it but I'm going to the Tabernacle it'll be about four hours long and my subject is the beast at the beginning and the Beast at the end through the trail of a serpent again I say his emphasis is the beast at the beginning of the beast at the end through the trail of The Serpent and again even that phrase you could see the beast at the beginning in Genesis in the beast in Revelation and that could be something oh look there may there may be there's something there do we connect these together and there's a lot there that could begin to fill in to the uh the picture to recognize this Trail he says take about four hours so I'm not quite gonna be four but we don't have an evening service so you just relax I think we got the air conditioner fixed and everything so we're good right all right he says I got my scriptures all laying out the from the beginning he's the beast at the end now notice the punch and show that he's a religious person and a denomination that made the denomination I mean that's a punch isn't it goes and come right through the trail of it and prove it to you by the scriptures that it is he goes I didn't know that to the Holy Spirit give it to me the other day up there now that that should be the clue that brother branham's not just running a concordance search brother Madam's not just drawing uh from history uh he there's something that God has inspired to him and quickened to him you'll find this very often in his ministry that if he reads something or something's inspired to him he would run and he would study it out and he'd research it and he would try to find places that would that he could say oh that that agrees with my heart that resonates there that's a good scripture there that's a good thing there and so God had quickened something to him and instead of just running out there and finding out what brother Jack said about it and what this brother had to say about it what leeville has to say about it he he goes to the word of God and he begins to see this thing develop and if it's corroborated with other other things there's something that has struck him and I want to say this in this very very forcefully when brother Branham says the trail of the serpent the beast at the beginning the beast at the end and then he comes back to it again and this other service that he's connecting it to something Beyond history uh this is going to be a mouthful but it's connecting it to something Beyond Church ages because it's not just a matter of exp it's not just the ahav exposing the devil but there's one thing that exposes the serpent there's one thing that exposes the Antichrist and that's the brightness of Christ that's the light of God's word so you cannot have an exposure and you can't have the cover being pulled off of something to say look it's the mark of the beast unless you have light that is shining to expose the air what good would it be if the lights are off and we're all blind and we're all groping around and and I'm just over there and I got really good feelers and I'm like oh guess what what there's a beast in here right and I'm just going to try to describe to you what the Beast is okay what if you're really bad at describing something hey that wouldn't be good but there's something about the light is shining and if I could say this the beautiful fact about the light shining is that the light is shining to give you an understanding so it's not just trying to be a parent of what brother Branham said but Christ you light up my heart and my mind let me to know him to know him and the reality know him in relationship and that's what pulls the cover off the anti so he's he's really the real heart of this is beyond the historical perspective he's not just repeating historians he's not just reciting church history the history of Israel and the history of the New Testament Church and its opposition and then the history of the church to the church ages that's not what he's that's not what he's referring back to when he talks about the trail of The Serpent and the Beast at the end this isn't another time in leadership and here we are right down to the very end if you ever bought one of my tapes get this when I get it when I get home the trail of the serpent and you'll see where it's at see where this ends up at see what God had showed him the other day and I've been going back through some of those sermons that he preached within that time period trying to find if there was any particular moment or instance uh that is kind of in harmony with what the point he's trying to make there about what he calls him back to and I found a couple places I may be just a little bit reluctant even if it's just for time's sake not to go into it but there's definitely something that was being impressed upon him that he is seen now in a more Stark way than he's ever seen before maybe it's just getting brighter brighter it's coming louder and louder clearer and clearer and so now you're saying you'll see where it ends up at so what the Lord showed him the other day isn't necessarily looking back but it's seen where things were now and that's what a prophet can do that's where a prophet can bring you is to where God where things are right now and so if I can put it this way he is seen and and I know that if I'm taking some Liberty here forgive me he's seeing the climax of two agendas I I'm not wanting to glorify just Satan's Eden but I wanted you to see that he's seen the climax of two agendas Satan's ambition but also God's achievement because God had a purpose God had somebody's trying to achieve God had a reason for doing this and he had a purpose in the beginning that was thwarted and it was that purpose that was seemingly interrupted by Satan to bring forth his agenda and his kingdom according to his ambition and so now you have a God's ambition at the end coming to IX climax so what brother branham's identifying is not just Satan's ambition but it's God's achievement and he's gonna he's gonna talk about the truth of the Beast because remember if I could put it in these terms the Beast system all along is fighting against the potential Genesis 3 15. why did Cain kill Abel let's see to the woman why was there at Judas at the time of Jesus Jesus the seat of the woman this is what he's got to he has got to thwart the the kingdom interruptor he's got to take the one that stands to bridge the gap of Fallen Humanity back to the original Eden and so his kingdom is going to be the Beast system and his beast power is wanting to raise something up but it's got this murderous Spirit behind it you've got to kill anything else that's genuine you got to tear anything else down that opposes uh gives the potential of weakening and destroying my reign when he's talking about the trail of the serpent the beast at the beginning the beast at the end that's a language that kind of puts The Serpent and the Beast in the headlights but that's not what the headlight is shining it's about the mystery of God he is he is looking at the mystery of godliness The Mystery of the church and Satan's attempt to pervert it when you when you Trail the serpent in the beginning the beast at the beginning beginning to the end there's a certain theme that emerges when you come to the end to realize oh you can't talk about the serpent without talking about God's purpose you can't talk about the beast at the beginning the beast at the end without looking at God's achievement and what he's wanting to do when he uses the term Trail it means to track or smell the track or smell left by a person or animal so the trail of the serpent is his track or the smell that has been left the trail of the serpent it's the track or the scent of Satan and there is a pull to that if there's a trail something has been left to to catch the scent of it and if you follow the scent and you know how to follow it it's going to lead you to where it is in this hour that we're living in Satan is capitalizing on just the abundance of information that we have access to and there is even I would say for some this instinct to want to just pour ourselves into a particular subject and just root out of out of it everything you know every every type every shadow every emblem every everything just get all the full history and I thank God that he took the messenger of the hour and wired him in a particular way to where as a and we believed this that he was a messenger to the church that he is he has a uh is sent to us he's a messenger that we've received and we give him that respect and and we have that confidence in him and that that's one of the things that's carving us or that's without that where would we be so we have this confidence that God gifted him equipped him and inspired him and even preserved all the you know 1200 sermons that we could go back and listen to and that then and then in turn we need the Holy Spirit to Quicken these things to give us the truth of what's in there and the reality that's laying in that but I appreciate how he had an appetite to research and to study uh and through his effort presented to us kind of these highlights and these bits and pieces like God felt were relevant to us to be able to digest so that we don't have to try to go in and figure it all out because if you want to open up that door and get into that all right fine we'll start a Bible study and we'll do his lips to Babylons okay right and and and and we'll just fill our heads up with all the imagery that he's projecting and everything he's trying to set forth and we'll go ahead and go back to the histories that he quoted and go back to all the in the the try to compile all the resources together and you'd find if you did that it wouldn't satisfy in the end but brother Branham is taking something and he's saying oh let's pull this piece here let's pull that that piece here and it doesn't have to be drilled down perfectly to the letter it doesn't have to have all these things that are trying to perfectly line up because that wasn't his uh that wasn't his agenda his agenda was just to kind of take it back to the scripture and then see these things being highlighted in other places and not just allow us to open ourselves up to other things just to wholesale digest it and make it part of our appetite and Satan has taken advantage of the Loose Ends that exist for some and that seem to be laying out there but I believe that's what the message was doing was tying these things together I want to read from the sermon Israel and the church this was used a few weeks ago at least and it's kind of just this fulcrum that I can move use to go Advance further and today is still kind of reviewing from a lot of things we've already said I'm just trying to add add more depth to it but I'll say this as we enter this maybe the second part of the sermon be very sincere as we approach this and because all hell is against the word and Satan has been work Ed to cause confusion says that Satan knew God's will and with some foresight and even limited understanding of what God's wanting to do Satan has been trying to confuse the record but trying to sow a discrepancy and cause things to happen in such a way towards like oh well what about this and what about that so you've got to be very sincere so in this sermon Israel in the church he says you notice that all those Cults of this day are beginning in Genesis they have their start back in Genesis winding up out here in the last day for instance many of them like how that formal religion begin in Cain that's where he starts it and then he's going to track it for us how come out and come down to the sons of Noah ham out of a ham he had Nimrod Nimrod built the Tower of Babel Babel comes on down through King Nebuchadnezzar's time and out into Revelations Babylon so though the kingdom changed from Assyria uh to uh to these different regions in these different areas in Egypt and Greece and Rome though you could see the different natural kingdoms that existed it's the same spirit Same Spirit animating Kingdom Same Spirit behind the politics it's always been this Same Spirit from the beginning it says it's so there's brother Brown kind of trailing it then how that little seed started way back there at the East side of the gates of Eden coming on down winding out all kinds of Cults and everything started back there lining themselves out to the end now he behooves us to watch be careful and be said in the word many things are taking place today which are unscriptural let's watch the scripture be sure that we are right there's the warning many things are happening today that are unscriptural and he's given us this picture of a seed sown in the beginning and it coming to at the very end in a Babylon in the Book of Revelation he says and that's kind of that's where we've been wanting to get for the last few services in the Book of Revelation there's going to be a Babylon that raises let me says the same seed that was in Cain and formal religion and as it advances even in Nimrod when it comes to Nimrod we're going to see if you'll turn to Genesis 10 . it's formal religion but not in the sense of worshiping the true creator Genesis chapter 10 verses 8 to 10 and Kush beget Nimrod he began to be a mighty one in the Earth it's referenced again in the book of Chronicles how he was a mighty one a mighty he begin to be Mighty in the earth he was a mighty Hunter before the Lord wherefore it is said even as Nimrod the mighty Hunter before the Lord so there's some recording a record it is said Nimrod the mighty Hunter before the Lord and the beginning of his kingdom first mention of kingdom in the Bible was Babel and Eric and akkad and kauna in the land of shinard when it says that the beginning of his kingdom was Babel there's the seeds of Babylon that word Babble there is Babylon and it's the Kingdom built by nimrod who is a mighty Hunter before the Lord which isn't like walk before me and be thou perfect as God said to Abraham it's not before the Lord in the way that we might think it but it actually means in the face of God remember in your face that's what he's doing he is a mighty hunter in the face of God in opposition to God so in the beginning of this Kingdom his King a kingdom whose beginning is against the Lord and this is Babylon it's against God Babel and the word Babylon the word Babel there specifically means to mingle oneself or to mix oneself it means a mix so here right at the start in Genesis 10 as we get After the flood and we're seeing the generations of the sons of Noah it's not this is nimroduce Noah's great grandson so anybody here have living great grandparents I'll look at somebody that I know has what well that's a small okay good there's a few here we should do great grandparents day or something uh just it'd be a small gathering apparently but if that with the just think of how that is I mean this is just somebody it's not that far removed from Noah yet he is now building a kingdom and the scripture goes on to tell us in verses 11 and 12. he describes all the kingdoms that were built by him so much uh associated with him in that region where in Micah chapter five it refers to Assyria as the land of nimrod this this is just how remarkable his influence was and his this one who builds a kingdom called Babel it's a mixed uh Society or it's it's the word means mixed Babel so Satan has achieved his kingdom very quickly he's got a mighty Hunter against God who opposes God who's who is even the very words Nimrod the word means Rebellion this is this is the son of Cain this is in the spirit of the seed that was sown in the beginning because Babylon in Babylon is a pagan Kingdom they weren't building a tower that would reach to Heaven because they wanted to get a peak of God they weren't building a tower that could reach heaven so that they could be closer to God but this was something that was anti-god Nimrod meaning Rebellion this was rebellious against the word of God it was God's purpose in the beginning because God had set the bounds of man and how that he was to fill up the Earth and God had a vision of how that they would be scattered in the very vision of them in the beginning was that they would not be scattered a mighty one in the earth that means a tyrant Nimrod was a tyrant and he had such an effect upon the people that he had caused them to rely solely on his power his kingdom it's that Beast Force working upon the people with this forced unity in this Conformity and we're going to work together and we're going to do the same thing and we're going to model ourselves in a certain way and lest we be scattered over the face of the Earth as it says in Genesis 11 1 and the whole earth was of one language and one speech and it came to pass as they journeyed from the East that they found a plane in the land of shinar and they dwelt there this is this is nimrod's Kingdom this is his influence his ambition they said one to another go to let us make brick and burn them throughly and they had brick for stone and slime had they from order and they said go to let us build us a city and a tower that City in a tower called Babel this is the same word for Babylon it's in the plane of Shiner this is chaldea this is that region this is the location let us build us a city notice the referring back to let us make let us build whose top May reach unto heaven let us make us a name what a phrase let us make us a name lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth that's that opposition to God's will and in these very words here God who wants these to be recorded it gives us insight into their what was in their minds and in their hearts and if the imagination of man was only constantly evil in Genesis 6 look at how quickly now man is united with one language and one speech even to the point where God says nothing will be restrained from them what they want to do and they're recognize the self-reliance the self-ambition the self-preservation it's me it's I I will let us let's preserve let's uh let this is our ambition this is our alliance and in Pride they're going to erect a monument to themselves there's no they're not hiding it it's not there's no pretense that they're worshiping God when you recognize that at this very moment there's no pretense that they're worshiping God Nimrod is against God Nimrod is in opposition to God some Scholars uh suppose that it's possible that Nimrod may have even met Abraham and that this is Nimrod who's there between Noah and between Abraham and his ideas who needs God we are against God and surely the philosophical arguments were pretty good do you know that this God who created the heavens and the Earth and maybe they even acknowledged them but you recognize what a narcissist is right didn't like what everybody was doing didn't like what they were doing with this canvas so he just says hey Noah get an ark build it I'm gonna allow you to survive we're going to kill the rest of the people in the face of the Earth and I'm sure there were some people sitting there going I don't I mean yeah he may be God but I don't want to serve God like that hey this is these are the seeds from Cain this is formal religion that is blatantly and obviously anti-god Josephus even comments that was that their building of this Tower was done in Disobedience to God's command to multiply and replenish the Earth it was done to defeat his will so this is against God and it's the city of Babylon that brother bear said the devil's lie in the devil's mystery rose up against the truth of God and the mysteries of God in this city this is where the devil's lies raise up in the devil's Mysteries raise up against the truth of God and the mysteries of God in that City this is why I would posit that just studying that alone will never let allow you to rise up identify truth and did you know the more often a lie is repeated the more likely you are to believe it to be true so there's a real danger in just researching the LIE real danger and just tracking down the false and trying to identify the Falls if it's not by the light that the light's not shining there's a real danger in picking around and things that are false so Babylon represents Satan's throne it's and if I I want to use that phrase it represents Satan's kingdom and his throne and in it hidden within it is his ambition to have a kingdom brother Brandon says in the pergament church age thus the mysteries of Babylon spread from Nation to Nation until it appeared in Rome in China India and even in North and South America we find the very same basic worship he's brother Branham didn't conduct time travel to to determine that and nor was he a historian with decades and Decades of research skills on his disposal to dig into the original record and read the foreign language and come up with this but he's looking at the historical record as research by historians and theologians and they're all agreeing and they're all pulling these things together saying look you have this model that exists even in Nations and and societies that were cut off from Europe that were not connected to the east the trading routes of the East that they were not they were uninfluenced seemingly by some of these other places by Connection by geography and some sort of uh Commerce but yet they have the same means and Method Of Worship it went with them as they were dispersed though their language changed they didn't mean their hearts were changed so now the imprint that's left in them is this means of formal religion and however that game of telephone worked and those successive Generations from one to the next as it got passed on it evolves to where they have their form of religion their form of worship and what a remarkable observation that the mysteries of Babylon that began in Genesis 10 that's what spread out over the whole earth so that if you're reading this story you're reading this tradition you're reading this allegory you're reading about this record it's all got Satan's fingerprints on it somehow presenting the same narratives why do they all have a flood narrative why do they all have this uh this archetype of this of the hero why is there a messiah figure in a lot of them you want to know why a lot of these things that exist in anthropology and exist in geography and history and all these other ways that we could collect these things is because Satan was the designer it was in them as they spread out over the Earth yeah rely on History alone rely on science alone and there's your faith because that's the that's the worst is a science that masquerades as faith in Revelations chapter 2 verses 12 and 13 I would like to go a lot faster right now so that we could end we could end quickly I would desire that you don't always get what you want but I do desire to to go rather quickly here in Revelations chapter 2 verses 12 and 13. I hope I can just hit the highlights on this Satan's the Satan's seat is capital city of Babel the tower that would reach to this guy now we're fast forwarding to Revelations 2. brother Bram did a good job of ninrod Nebuchadnezzar you know he we could track it through that way he says in the angel and to the angel of the church in pergamus right there's a lot of Scholars who recognize how pergamus is a word that's distinct and its Origins they're distinctly different than the other Church ages it says these things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges I Know Thy works and where thou dwellest even where Satan's seat is now hold this fast my name and has not denied my faith even those days where an Antipas was my faithful martyr so there was opposition there was a murder Spirit there was a good reason to say uh maybe not politically correct right now for me to believe this maybe not good for my life for my next sake to continue to believe this but he says you've withstood even the face of intimidation he says who was slain among you and he says where Satan dwelleth by giving us this image of this martyr the slain martyr brings back to our minds how Satan is a murderer the father of lies and a murder in the beginning and it is his objective from the beginning to slay the seed of the woman so it's part of his agenda it's part of his nature it's part of the way that he reacts that if he can't do it by the sword he'll do it by word his own word his own lies because it's his desire to assassinate the truth it's his desire to assassinate the believer it's his desire to steal the word from the believer to steal the word out of your mouth to steal away the the the the words of God to cause you to devalue them and not believe them this is this is his desire through threat intimidation or whatever it might be to devalue the word of God and the scripture identifies Satan's seat that might just seem innocuous like oh no no don't sit there that Satan seat but it actually means throne throne us that's exactly what the word is if you looked it up in a Greek Lexicon it's the the elevated chair it's used of God and the Throne of God this is Satan's Throne seat that that helps us to see that Satan had a place of power Ephesians 2 2 calls him the prince of the power of the air here you have the uh the Messiah the prince Messiah that comes and you have the prince of the power of the air the reason he's got this Prince of the power there it says it's this anti-to-it crisis to be in John 14 30 Jesus says Hereafter I will not talk much with you I'm not getting into what he's saying here but just this phrase for the prince of this world cometh and hath nothing in me Satan is the prince of this world this is how the Bible characterizes him now let's just take that phrase the prince of this world the prince of the power of the air and however you'd want to describe that we must recognize that the air then is some Dominion that he's Prince that there's a world that somehow he is the prince of that this is identified with Satan this is what exists this is really maybe relying a lot on our services on for God so loved the world as controversial as they were we're still relying on that concept that there's a world that God loves and this world that God doesn't love and here's the prince of the power of the world this is the prince of the power of the other there's something represented that that Satan has deformed that God doesn't appreciate the deformity if I could put it that way and Satan has in this scripture very in particular he's moved his seat from Babylon of the Old Testament into the church and we have a marriage and a union now of what at one time would have been nimrod's religion formal religion of Cain evolved into the religion of nimrod and this is a religion that is Babylonian is is polytheism and it is it is the worship of the sun and the moon and the stars and we don't like that one true God and the one that spoke and created the worlds well whatever he is we don't want to serve them and they begin to identify other deities and other religions and they spread out over the Earth this false Pagan religion that existed among the Heathen or the reprobate as identified between Abraham's seed and the rest of the world that served not the true God he has now moved his seat and there's now a union in a marriage of all these worldly kingdoms and the power of the natural kingdoms if we could say government or politics with religion and not just religion but Christianity pergamus is therefore set forth as symbolically at this time in the church ages as the present capital of Satan's kingdom in pergamus they worship the god of healing which was the emblem of was a serpent there was there's a lot of things about their music and their science and their medicine and their way of worship and their temples that made this a place a logical place to be the seed of Satan but now it's it's not just the worship of a serpent that's clippios or these other deities that would have existed but it's it's being married with the very word pergamus some take it from pergos which is a mountain or a high tower and it's one definition that's often repeated that pergamus is from the word pergos which is a high tower interesting right you take that definition it connects us back to the Tower of Babel connects us back to that mountain there there's a way that Satan is wanting these mountain peaks himself he's one in this high mountain it is a fortified structure rising to a considerable height in order to repel and attack or enable a Watchman to see in every direction that's that City that came he built for Enoch that waking place where he could set watch built a city to get elevation to be able to see who would be coming after him it's a City built that fortification that dwelling is built by fear it's not not to reach God not to be closer to Heaven it's not inviting it's not welcoming it's not hospitable it's hostile and now pergos if we use that definition it's it's a rising city city that's set Upon A Mountain uh that it that it might be be defensible against any attack fortified structure with this considerable height to to escape punishment or judgment just as it was in the Tower of Babylon but in the Greek that's used pergamus means something else per is abundance or thoroughness and gamos is marriage so there's others that look at this word and say that it does not actually mean a mountain or high tower which means enough to me but the other definition it may is more appropriate more accurate is this one of Thoroughly married and that's what this pergamist represents it's a thorough mixing it's to be a total mixing together of identities you've taken one identity politics you've taken another identity Christianity and you so thoroughly mix it together toward now it's become one now now it's become a hybrid now it's become something different than it was in the beginning and brother Brown is that's the definition that brother Branham uses is Thoroughly married and there's a there's a lot of a lot of scholarship to back that up I don't need the scholarship I'm just saying that for the scholars the fact that brother Branham felt impressed and inspired to use that one it's because this is what's happening catch how perfect this is Batman says The Offspring of that Union of this thorough mixing in in this thoroughly married in pergamus The Offspring of that Union have been consistently the most horrible hybrids the world has ever seen and we're not talking about cars the most horrible hybrids the world has ever seen the truth is not in them but all the evil ways of Cain the first hybrid is Kane the Prius I mean is that what he is the truth is not in him but all the evil ways of Cain the first hybrid is they're all if he's going back saying now that we've had this thorough mixing in this marriage of government power religious political power with Christianity with religion now that we've mingled it together he said they have all the ways of caning them they're hybrid just like Kane Was Not only was State and church wedded in this age but the Babylonian religion was officially joined to the first church this is something that maybe a lot of people just who are looking at these and uh wrestling with these truths and looking at church history very hard for them to fully grasp and appreciate what's happening when the church organized and just how diabolical organized religion was and just how Satan had access to those hierarchies and those unscriptural modes uh to control and to subjugate and keep keep the people in bondage and keep the word away from them listen I'm I'm going through this with this whole other thought in my mind of chasing away the ghost of Catholicism banishing from our psyche all the Shadows that are in the box everything that might be in the system that that's it to fuzzying up our interpretation and it causes us to act out of some sort of Duty to the church instead of love for Christ he said that religion is born married and Satan now has access to the name of Christ it was enthroned as God In Worship he says this is the Beast of Revelations 13 this Roman Empire now married with the Roman Catholic Church this is that beast in Revelations 13. Satan had accomplished another mingling he had intermingled nemrod's religion with Christianity and so exactly what he did in Eden he's now done after the New Creations are born after the Christian church is born after the seed of Genesis 3 has come forth and he's burnt forth a religion that is connecting men back before the fall he takes his he takes his religion the satanic Babylonian religion which we could say is the Serpent's religion and he marries it with Christianity and he mixes them together just as he did in Eden he's now married them together now our Pursuit and our brother Brown does Christianity versus idolatry he studies a lot in hislops to Babylons he brings us a lot of different places to be able to recognize enough sufficiently enough to say oh that's Catholicism that's denominationalism that's this and to be able to recognize these heirs but there's a real danger in becoming the anti-catholic right it's important enough just to recognize some of these things that we need to root out and borrow our stuff away from certain things but this isn't an invitation just to try to drive down real deep into oh did you know that Nimrod married this person and Imran married that person then you get in the history of it they didn't even exist at the same time because we've gotten so caught up in the conspiracy theories and all the oral tradition and everything else that builds up around the legends that build up around the truth man just cut to the truth I'll have to remember that later I'll share it in to the patreon uh clients say he's married nimrod's religion with Christianity now I'm going to jump quickly to the end the culmination of this mixing is the great harlot in Revelation 17 and 18. that's the process is complete that all along there are some there's something Satan's trying to achieve and I I think it is a chess match with Satan he knows God's will but you could see where God at every turn is doing things where Satan maybe didn't expect I even think with the whole idea in in Genesis chapter 10 I could just picture Satan over there you know he's playing rummy with his buddies and he's just like man is this amazing Noah's great-grandson he's worshiping us like it didn't even take very long and here we are this is awesome and and so in his mind he might be thinking this is just on a lot quicker track than I thought it was but he doesn't ever stop even to where when he tempts Christ he shows him all the kingdoms of the world that have been and will be and and he's so this is this is where we're going this is what we're going to do but there's a part to him that's missing it's a part to him that he does not yet see but this process is complete in Revelation 17 and 18. in Revelation 17 18 not sure if there's kind of a neat you know Glory type there but it says and the woman which thou sawest in that great City just as the beginning of Satan's Eden and his kingdom is Babylon the Tower of Babel that's Satan's first capital was a city now the woman which thou sawest is that great City that's the woman is a city which reigneth over the kings of the Earth when you see second Corinthians 4 4 the God of this world this is the kingdom which reigneth over the kings of the Earth the woman which you saw is that great City so as John saw a woman she symbolically represents a city the way the describes her through this symbolic language it's obvious that it's can't be taken too literal but it's symbolically representing some and and the the writer the one Speaking helps us to understand it no the woman you saw as a city brother Brown picks it up in the church age book he says and in Revelation 17 God does not any longer refer to pergamus as Satan's seat nor does he say that is where Satan dwells no the throne room is no longer in pergamus but it is Mystery Babylon so to whatever extent it existed there in pergamus and had and and there's a I guess there's just even a lot of history to it how it's being married through the the the pope and these these rulers and these priest Kings and how that's married there in pergamus he said but that just shows you Satan's design he says it's moved and he says it is Mystery Babylon it is not in Babylon but in mystery Babylon in Revelation 17 5 says and upon her forehead this woman that John sees upon her forehead was a name written mystery Babylon the Great the mother of harlots and Abominations of the Earth it's interesting to take note that after Eve had done after the woman had done what she had done she was named the mother of all living and now in the end when Satan has achieved the culmination of his mixing and his Eden upon the forehead of this woman which is that great city is named mystery and then if I could just say this way mystery Babylon the great the mother of harlots the mother of the Abominations of the Earth oh what a saying Abominations of the Earth the mother of harlots of the Earth Babylon the great of the Earth notice how that that would just ring mystery Babylon the great of the Earth I know I'm just reading it this way but I want you to recognize where this where it's at the mother of harlots of the Earth and Abominations of the Earth mystery Babylon is a woman not a wife it's not called a wife but she's called a mother she's called a harlot mystery Babylon the Great the mother of harlots and Abominations of the Earth it is this contradiction to Heaven's mystery because it's a mystery of the Earth she's described as a filthy City I'm not going to go through all the different scriptures that are in this but it's the Pinnacle it's the Capstone it's the culmination of Satan's Eden Revelations 18 contains her judgment The Babylon is Hell's mystery and the world the world's Glory the Earth has produced Abominations the Earth has produced harlots to her it is Babylon the great of the Earth this is Satan's Eden this is it comes to a head in the end time is something so close and I know we're all scratching our head saying man this Pope is a quack but it's so close now that it's he says it's a Pentecostal move not that we would get all those Pentecostal kitties many robbed on the wrong way they're all just a bunch of pennies no no no no no no no no no it just shows that Satan has moved all the way up right up to even the restoration of the gifts and the outpouring of the spirit of God and he can come right out he comes right up to that in all his impersonations but the one thing he can't cross over into is the bright age they just just can't do it because that's where light is at so this is Babylon hell's mystery the Earth I want to say world but the Earth Glory but what about God's mystery is that where it all just ends up I've been looking at wanting to get into it God willing maybe in the next few Services we have a chance to identify where brother Branham sees the pre the bride and sees the success of church ages and then when it gets to Lao to see it these are my words the stomach turns he's just so discouraged and disappointed a naked church this is what it produces dancing to the beat of rock and roll music that's the culmination of Satan's Aiden that's the climax of the church the process of hybrid it is complete he's mixed it all up organized religion everything in the end it's all come to that place and again Devil's like boom we got him we got him Restoration of the gifts three life Messengers we've had all their death message we've come to the Restorations we've been able to assimilate all in just 15 short years we've been able to organize Pentecost and he feels great and then God raises up this simpleton out of Kentucky with no denominator we say no denominational affiliation but no denominational organization backing so to speak no no education is what I mean that he comes up and he's and God raises this one up comes brings them right out of the systems right out of uh the the Baptist system even with the uh with the this embracing by the Pentecostals what is God raising him bringing up to be he is God's voice God's Gonna use him as a voice because now in this moment where he's just so shell-shocked with the perversion of laodicea descending Into Darkness and Chaos I'm just preaching it now he then sees the bride will come and breathe you again and what is it it's every nation every nation is represented and what does it say in Revelations that every nation upon the face of the Earth had been made drunk with the wine of her fornication every Merchant every King every priest of every nation has been swadded by Babylon but what about God's mystery Psalms 24 1 2 and 3 the Earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof the world and they that dwell in there the Earth is the Lord then where is the Lord's Earth where are they that dwell in that are the Lords for he hath founded upon the Seas and establish it upon the floods in the beginning God and it says who shall Ascend into the hill of the Lord or who shall stand in his holy place this city which sets on Seven Hills the one that are the one that represents itself is the Pinnacle in the peak of God's glory who shall stand Ascend into the hill of the Lord notice that image of this impersonation who shall stand in his holy Place those standing in this Unholy place but who shall stand in his holy place and just as it is we see Revelation 17 and 18 that great city is this is represented by This Woman This Mother of harlots this mother of Abominations this Babylon as he calls it in Revelations 19 verses 7 to 8 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife it doesn't say woman his wife hath made herself ready but is it her saying let us make us no because verse 8 and to her was granted that she should be a raid in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the Saints rather than called it his word his righteousness Revelations 18 4 Revelations 4 1 brings the bride to the invisible Union of Revelations 19. it says the marriage of the Lamb has come you have to catch that brother Brandon preaches the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride has any of you been studying that listening to it I thank God that I've taken so long to get to this what in the beginning as I preached the first serve the last service the first in the first service what I'm looking at I've just had more time to continue to study and if I could just be honest I almost feel like I was so shallow in the beginning and how I was approaching the future home not recognizing that some of the things that's that kind of stand out in that it's just Brother Brad I'm laying the appropriate Foundation to to understand what's happening now there's this idea of what's going to be and kind of connecting these things together and the real the real kicker that's at the heart of what he's saying here as he preaches the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride is to recognize if it's a Heavenly bridegroom and an Earthly bride there has got to be that's got to be a wedding and a marriage between the Heavenly and Earthly and he says at the very beginning of the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride and now this morning I have a very important subject to me it's a very Blissful one I hope it strikes you the same way that wedding Bliss that wedding day Bliss and if I could only give it in the inspiration I received it in be wonderful but that'll be up to God to do that that means anybody could read this and get some inspiration and draw some factual details from it but it takes God to give it an inspiration that he received it in and if I could say this way the carnal mind will never see the Deep revelation of God it'll only be able to draw from its statistics just like anybody could from the Bible we can just take scripture and compare scripture to scripture we could just take these details we could break this word down we could define this word and we could put all that together but a lot of that's just going to be forming a scriptural basis for the Deep revelation of God because that's the only thing that God could give for the marriage of the Lamb has come that's the Heavenly bridegroom and his wife is an Earthly bride this is the very image that's set before us as soon as Revelation 17 comes into view and her judgment is spoken of in Revelations 18 it says but wait there's more come on Paul Harvey give me the rest of the story and what do you have you have oh Revelations 19 the Lamb's wife it has made herself ready in the union the marriage has come in Psalms 48 1 2 and 3 great is the Lord and greatly to be praised in the city of our God in the mountain of his holiness beautiful for situation the joy of the whole earth what a contradiction the contradiction to the Abominations of the Earth the harness of the Earth but now there's a habitation now there's a beautiful situation now there's the joy of the whole earth is Mount Zion oh Hallelujah here's your bride the Mount Zion Showdown on the sides of the North the very place that Satan made his ambition in Isaiah 14 the sides of the north the city of the great king Hallelujah the city of the great king God is known in her palaces for Refuge God is known as a mighty warrior in her place God is known among her as a fortress and a fortification this and we see that natural Jerusalem is only a type of this spiritual Jerusalem that's this place that Lucifers desired all along as we see the very sides of the North in his ambition in Isaiah 14 13. and I read this in closing if our brothers would come to their instruments I know there's there's a lot a mouthful in these few things I'm about to read to you but in the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom an Earthly bride the other man makes a statement the kingdom of God is in the earth now in the hearts of his Saints it is his attributes that he began in the beginning wow it's his attributes that he began in the beginning could I just try to give you a quick overview that if Satan in the beginning sowed his seat of discrepancy and it comes to Cain and he starts formal religion and then Cain this carries over after the flood toward now that strain is identified in nimrod and then from there former religion Pagan religion polytheism the worship of other things spreads out around the whole world the whole Earth dispersed from Genesis of dispersed around the world so now there's your Heathen there's your reprobate and now that just continues on that history just Marches On but among the heathens which they were all Gentiles which was Nations or people Gentiles becomes a phrase to just describe hybrid blood right that's that's what they are Gentiles God from the Gentiles calls a man named Abram and it doesn't come from South America doesn't call him from Spain doesn't call he calls him right out of UR right after caldea right at the seat and he's going to call him out of Babylon and that that drops down and here's a people the children the seat of Abraham the one to whom the true God revealed himself the one whose Glory was lost in the beginning and there starts Judaism the children the Israelites and then the story of the world is told through one nation but that nation is founded upon a promise that the seed will come which is Christ so why Satan's Eden is expanding and religion is forming and all sorts of duplicities and multiplicities of religions and ideas and theologies and allegories and stories is that's just developing God is developing one people one nation and giving them one land that from there the seed would come and when that seed come and I gotta go a little bit faster than what I'm wanting to do here but God now from Christ he's the head of a new race he's the head of another kingdom and there's Judas of the other Kingdom right there within Judaism Judas a Jew ready to betray Christ in Christ through that Christ's death burial and Resurrection which the princes of this world didn't know this would happen and through his death Resurrection sending back to church he inaugurates now True Religion the worship of the one true God where now it's not God above us but now it's God With Us the very image that God is tracking and foreshadow in the beginning now he's birthing Children of the Kingdom bringing forth his seed they're all being made manifest they're they're his sons and daughters of God eternity's been birth in them that begins on the day of Pentecost and that UNF that starts flooding out and then Satan takes his Antichrist religion and starts marrying it with Christianity so when we come to this end time and brother Branham says God the kingdom of God is on earth now in the hearts of his Saints it's his attributes that begin the beginning in other words it's filling up to where it's complete now because when the bride is gone there's no more salvation when the bride is gone it's just whoever had their confession of Faith at that time once tribulation sets in and the Incarnation of Satan among his people is becomes complete and and he rides out in the Fulfillment of Prophecy in that hour think of it where is the kingdom of God now let's not put it off to the Millennium let's not put it off to the eighth day this is what is so inspiring to brother Branham in my opinion is not just to be able to track the trail of the serpent not just be able to talk about the future home because a lot of people can chart that just by reading the Bible but it's to understand that now God has brought his bride through a process oh Hallelujah brings us right up to this place to recognize here we are in our positional placing at the end time he says there's attributes that begin in the beginning you have the beast at the beginning the beast at the end what but about the word in the beginning what about the God in the beginning what about the Tree of Life in the beginning what about the Christ in the beginning and the Christ at the end [Music] just as the Bible says for the marriage of the Lamb has come in Revelations 21 and John says I saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven not a city coming up from the pits of Hell mystery Babylon the great the mother of the Hornets of the Earth the mother of the Abominations of the Earth but now the city New Jerusalem coming from God out of God from Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband oh there's another woman that's a mystery it is the mystery of Heaven it is the Earth's Glory and brother Adam says are you ready this is the city that Abraham was looking for in a prophet he knew that city was somewhere one rolls up a city and God called Abraham out so I'm going to bring you to a city there's another city that's more glorious than the towers of Babel there's another city that's more glorious than all the kingdoms of Babylon and oh Abraham was concerned with that vision and the city that he looked for is this New Jerusalem which you are the attributes of on Earth today now [Music] the Bible says for he looked for a city which hath foundations Genesis 10 Genesis 11 let us make us a city in a tower let us make bricks thoroughly let's build the foundations thereof let us make us a name for ourselves but Abraham's Vision was I'm looking for a city that has foundations whose Builder and maker is God Abraham sought a City built by God I felt like the one the one zesters in Babylon and that's what I'm seeking I don't want a legacy of my ancestors I want the faith of my fathers I want the original the real the living I want the Christ that's being revealed in this word I know I shared a lot with you today that wasn't there was nothing quick about that I know I shared a lot with you but I I know that there's something in here if God can just Quicken it to you I know there's something in here that can be a blessing to you I know it I know it can help you not just through a church service but even on a Monday morning as fellowshipping with the brother and and he's just sharing some uh God's just moving I'll just say this God's moving in beautiful remarkable ways just even amongst the brothers in Arizona the fellowship among his ministers the Revelation is breaking and young ministers and and they're teaching things and things are opening up and they're just reaching out and we're fellowshipping on it and we're just fellowshipping I just asked the question all right what's this going to mean for me on Monday morning and the brother just brings it right down to a reality said God is moving we should we are we should be so excited I I've been I've been just kind of tracking a thought to minister on Dry Bones no more this isn't a valley of dry bones anymore this Valley [Music] High bones anymore you're a dry bones there's a word that can raise up these dry bones and cause them to live and you are the Bears of this life that from you is streaming from you all right there's a fountain of Living Water for the dry bones in this desert oh how do I thank God for the Brad's Revival in this end time beautiful things are happening we ought to be enthused with what God is doing in this end time God bless you let's stand
