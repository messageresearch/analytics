TRANSCRIPT
========================================
random would say that that there's only two spirits of influence and he would say really make it quite simple that there's either a spirit that's your influence from above or beneath and we know that the world that we live in is a world uh where there's many spirits that are influencing the minds of people and it's a there's a great entire structure or a system that's in the world today and whether people understand it or not their actions and what motivates them and what drives them is being influenced by a spirit the prophet of God would go further and actually say that there's a spirit upon every nation and he would say you know I've watched how the messages I would preach in one spot of the country this is the United States will just have a powerful impact and he said you have that same message I preach it somewhere else and it just sort of you know would fall flat and we all know what that feels like when it falls flat and and brother Byron would say that you know how one one it would work here but it wouldn't work there and how that every nation would have a spirit you know would speak about the German spirit that it was very stoic and and sorry if you're German here tonight I'm not picking on you I'm just reading what a prophet said but he would say that a German spirit is very stoic it's very you know it's very uh uh independent that's what he said and he said you know just very uh stoic that he said brother Brandon would say you just sit there and speak to them and he'd come with that southern you know just a real honey you know uh kind of way and he'd say you know good morning to you and he said good morning and and he said she'd just sit there the German you know in her nature and he said she'd just sit there and stare at you and it says sure fine morning ain't it and she'd sit there and stare just it was inner nature it was something because she was under the influence of that Spirit of her family who was under the influence of a Nation friends let me just tell you that this nation also has a spirit it's not one that I want ingesting and so I don't want to ingest the spirit of this nation and brother Madam say the spirit of America would be haha it's all just a joke haha you know just everything's funny and you make light and you trivialize everything and I'm afraid if I could just preach for a minute that that's how the nation has gotten to the Bible That's How they've gotten to the word of God it's just a haha you know they just trivialize it it's make it minimize it and make it something less but friends I'm not I just want to say I I don't believe a True Believer is subject to a spirit of Germany or or France or Switzerland or America or the west or the east or the North I'm not a southerner I'm not a northerner I'm from the north all right it's from above and I'm subject to the city brother Brandon would say of my rebirth and so I'm not I'm I'm I'm in the world but I'm not of the world and the prophet of God say he would take the words of Jesus when he said if you love the world or the things of the world then the love of God is not in your heart now that word world is the word uh Cosmos it's the if you ever know the word chaos it's the direct opposite of the word chaos where uh Cosmos and Chaos won his order one is disorder but the prophet says it's a it's a music it's a Harmony it's a rhythm there's a certain Spirit that's influencing the world the minds of the world and let me just say all Spirits are maturing in the age that you live in listen friends the same spirits that you face today are no different than the spirits that they faced a hundred years ago it's only the maturing of that same Spirit listen people change and people die but Spirits never die and Spirits never change the same Antichrist spirit that all the world's waiting on John says the Paul says doth already work and so the spirit of antichrist was in the days of Paul it was in the days of Jesus it's only at a further manifestation that we live in right now how many can just identify and say I I can see the maturity of all Spirits coming to the fruition or the climax it's coming to maturity let me just say friends the spirit of the devil as more bold than he's ever been before come on somebody help me tonight he's more bold he's more out in the open he might win a hid somewhere in a closet but they came out of the closet it's the it's the expression of all Spirits it's more in your face than it ever was before listen I live in the Bible Belt and so I know that if it's open if the lgbtq and all of that kind of agenda and furries and and all kinds of things you know if those kind of spirits are there in the Bible Belt back home and The Good Old sassafrased South then how much more would it be in a in a place that's maybe not so leaning towards the old-fashioned way listen friends the devil is more out in the open he's more bold he's more in your face he doesn't mind he just sits right there and declares what he is I'm just going to preach here and say if the spirit of the Antichrist is bold and expressing himself how much more is the Holy Ghost wanting to express himself and pour out his Spirit upon his family and say if the devil's bold then let the Church of the Living God have all boldness to speak the truth of the word of God and so notice here it would it would be a spirit that would influence the minds of people and it's in the education system it's in the political system don't get me started on that and the Republicans as my dad says and the demon Kratz and I'm neither I'm a Christian and so so it's a spirit that's influencing Hollywood would be the new Babylonian Babylon the new capital that where all entertainment flows through it and it affects the it affects the the movies it affects the TV it affects the schools it affects education it affects uh it affects Recreation and let me just can I'm just saying it a little bit further it affects our pulpits it affects our churches the prophet of God said the reason why you have child delinquency is parent delinquency and the reason we have parent delinquency is Pulpit delinquency to where we've watered down the word and everyone's afraid to speak the truth it's going to go ahead and cut to the chase to my thought here tonight I might blow my wad but let me give you the punchline let me just let me just say to you today friends there's only one thing that'll set people free that's the truth and unless you speak the truth you'll only dance around a spirit hello and so God knowing the confusion that would come upon the world the god there would have to be a voice of truth that would have to be a voice if there's a voice of lies and there's got to be a Voice of Truth and I truly believe tonight that the Voice of Truth is still speaking if only we'd be still enough to listen and so that Voice of Truth speaks it's a voice that cuts through all the other voices as the voice that that breaks through all the complexes and all the doubt and and all of the fears but but let me just say this to you friends today that that you've got to have truth you've got to start with God's view of Truth because the Bible says that the carnal mind is enmity hello the carnal mind is enmity against God I'm giving you straight from the Bible the carnal mind is enmity against God not with God and you know how powerful that is in Romans 8 verse 5 it says 4 to be carnally minded is death so what is carnally that means when you're lust that means when you're lustful that means when you're thinking the wrong false no it's not that's not what the Bible's saying the Bible's saying the but the mind that you have that you're born with if you just have that mind and you never receive the mind of Christ that's the carnal mind that produces death but I'm thankful as apostle Paul says but we have the mind of Christ or aren't you glad today you're not in an insane world you have access to the mind of Christ you have access to what God thinks you have the revelation of what God says a man is not what the world says not what the school says but I know what the word says and so I've got the definition of a woman I know what a man is I know what a Believer is I know what a teenager is I know what a church should look like I know what worship feels like hello somebody help me I know what it feels like because I've got the mind of Christ about his words friends I'm just going to go in and tell you you might not agree with me but I'm going to tell you how I've viewed the message over the hour it's not quotes it's not books it's not tapes it's not a prophet's message I just go ahead and say it it's the mind of Christ it's the very mind we have the mind of Christ Hallelujah for to be carnally minded as death but to be spiritually minded is life I want life and peace how many want that here tonight because the carnal mind is enmity against God for it is not subject to the law of God nor indeed can be so then those who are in the flesh cannot please God the prophet of God would say and why I'm against organized religion he said what does that mean when the Bible in the Bible says that the carnal mind is enmity he says it's the word contrary it's the very opposite it's contrary with the word listen friends your body will never agree with what your spirit is saying that that that carnal nature and that carnal flesh that you have I don't care if you're born again I don't care if you're filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost you've still got a stinking rotten mind and a stinking rotten flesh that a war with you brother Brandon said all the days of your life you'll have a Cocker Barrel nature and he said it'll be a nature down on the inside it's been changed but on the outside it Wars it fights it questions it doubts it it struggles it it always doubts the let me just go ahead and tell you though tonight that's not you that's not who you are the prophet of God would say did you realize you've never even seen each other he said do you realize we say I see brother Elliot here tonight that's brother Elliot brother Brandon says actually I've never seen brother Elliot and he said do you realize that you've never seen me brother Bernie you might have thought you knew when we ate it where Whataburger earlier but that's not really who I am prophet of God said we've actually never seen the real you but we heard from it I said we heard from him prophet of God said you when you recognize this message was Eagles food you left the other thing you heard from your theophany said by the man you believe you hear from your theology I believe I hear from it every day every day when I feel like quitting I hear a voice that says you can't quit every day that I hear a voice said you're never going to make it I hear a voice that says you're going to make it child in fact you've already made it every time I hear a voice that says you'll never amount to nothing I hear a voice from truth from above that says you're a child of the king greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world Hallelujah you heard from your theophany listen friends it's not a voice that I can speak it's a voice from above and he said it's contrary to the mind of God brother Brandon says you've never even seen each other you know what take such courage in that because if I've never really seen each other then the man I see in the mirror that makes so many faults and so many failures and so many mess-ups come on brother can we agree with that we we got so much rotten stinking problems are rotten flesh and problems in our flesh and we say the wrong things and think the wrong things I got a message for the devil that's not me that's not who I am my representation is from above I'm a Believer down on the inside I don't question the word of God I believe the word of God I want the word of God hallelujah so Paul I'm going to read to you from Spurgeon this is powerful Paul didn't say that the carnal mind is at enmity with God he put it even stronger than that the carnal mind is enmity against God it is not black but Blackness it is not at enmity but enmity itself it is not corrupt but corruption it is not rebellious it is rebellion it is not Wicked it is wickedness itself the heart though it be deceitful is positively deceit it is evil in the concrete sin in the essence the quintessential I can't pronounce spurgeon's word there of all things are vile it is not envious against God it is envy it is not at enmity it is actual enmity listen what brother Brandon says here in the message of deceived Church by the word by the world I love this message if you haven't heard a good one uh if you haven't heard this lately this is a real good one you can go and listen to in 1959 I'm quoting from June 28th and he says then they bound the church with another cord as Delilah did and then they begin instead of having God called man man who were called by the Holy Spirit maybe didn't know their ABCs but they know Christ then the church got stylish and fashioned after the political speakers and they had to give their preachers doctors degrees everybody had to be a doctor of divinity that wasn't listen that was another cord to bind the church now he's preaching a deceived Church by the world a church in the with their head in the lap of Delilah that was another core to bind the church men go off to study each Seminary tries to produce a better scholar so that their churches can brag our pastor is a doctor of divinity and what did they do one try to have more knowledge than the other one well that doesn't mean anything in the sight of God I'm so glad it doesn't and there's no need for any man to try to take his worldly knowledge and ever please God with it it's an abomination in the sight of God you'll never please God with the worldly Ambitions and knowledge because it's enmity to God says the scripture he cannot do it and each one tries to have all the knowledge they they know just what to do and the words to say and and it becomes just a political speech in the stead in the place of a powerly demonstrated Holy Spirit message that sinks to the heart of man and discovers his sin I say God give me that kind of message something that'll sink to the very heart of man and discover my sins how many brothers would identify and sisters and say give me that kind of message they've trained for a political talk we don't need that Paul said the word come to us not only the gospel in word only but through the power and the manifestation of the Holy Ghost that brought the gospel demonstrating the powers of the Holy Ghost but all these men go off to seminars seminaries and they learn great educations and how they must stand before the people and how may that they must present themselves and how they must dress and how they must act and they should never use the wrong grammar now that's all right for a political speech got them live right now all those Republican candidates man given their polish political speech and saying everything perfectly brother Brandon says but we're not after the enchanting words of man Paul said the gospel that I preached didn't come like that but it come through the renewing of the Holy Ghost and the power of demonstrations doesn't come from a right form speech but it come to the demonstrations of the power of the Risen Christ that's the gospel to know him in the power of his resurrection you know it's incredible to me I was watching a man here recently and not criticizing I mean that I'm not criticizing this this man he was a pastor of Omega massive mega church here out in the west coast and he was just you know as popular and as cool man he was as hip as and stylish and and just you know so relevant connected you know with this group of people and any any and you know you can imagine the amount of pressure that's on a man like this and here he's got thousands of people listening to him and and all kinds of different ideas and all kinds of different things and and different spirits and and and and so he starts you know trying to say I he says uh you know he's going to reach out and say something and you can tell how he's trying to be careful what he says the words he says the way he says it and then he finally just starts looking at a screen you could tell he just he's so careful he's got to read what he's going to say because he's going to address the LGBT uh uh community and the trans he says that in the trans community that are in his church and he starts saying I just I just want to say that that I I want to show you love and and understanding and I just want to say that trans transgender uh people are welcome here uh uh that they're welcome in this church and he and he starts saying this to these people and you can tell the way he's trying so hard he's trying to not compromise and say that it's okay but at the same time he's trying to be welcoming and it's okay if you come here we just want to say to our group you know you're welcome here and we want you to feel comfortable here we want you to feel like you know that you can come and you can just feel feel the tension man attention something you can feel buddy you could feel it in honey it's you you can just walk into a room man and you know somebody something ain't right I just walked in at the wrong time you know they and and she said something to him and he took a tone and you could watch it's just like whoa what did I just walk into you could feel that tension in that room and you could finally feel the people as the pastor is trying to say this and he's trying to be carefully trying to watch it it's on YouTube and it's got you know all these people are watching and then finally you know the people just out of so much grace for the man they just break out into Applause and the whole church oh Trends are welcome here and homosexuals you're welcome here oh boy that guy breathes a big sigh of relief you know when you got the Applause of men it makes it easy right it's not hard to speak the truth when you got everybody all right you just say it you know but when you ain't got nobody agreeing with it and ain't got nobody preaching and ain't got nobody and you take a stand by it for all for you all by yourself you know but as I watched this man and he's trying so hard really mean it when I say I'm not criticizing this man as he says I'm you know I'm just trying to I'm just trying to um you know say this and and he's walking on eggshells and he's trying to not offend and he's trying to be so careful I I just couldn't help but think and I'm just going to say it to you tonight you will never help them by dealing with a a pampering and walking on eggshells and and come on can somebody agree with me tonight you never help a person by trying to watch them and and try to try to walk around them and walk on exercise listen friends a spirit loves to be petted it loves to be petted it loves to be walked around it loves to be caressed it loves it when you sort of dance around it you don't really come out and say it and you don't don't really want to it wants to be let me say this way a spirit loves to be Patty caked but it's a spirit and men have became afraid they've become afraid and let Spirits back them into corners but let me just preach to you as inspired as the lord gave it to me you must preach the word you must speak the word you must declare the truth it doesn't matter what it will cost you there's only one thing that will help them the truth there's only one thing that'll help them speak the word you'll never help them by petting it Patty caking it walking around it you've got to speak it you will never change a disbelieving heart by playing around with it let me give you a little catchphrase a good friend of mine back home gave me and I'm just using it and I love it fillings are overrated you can put that on a t-shirt fillings hello somebody come on I said people's feelings sometimes are just overrated and we become so careful we become so careful how we're going to say things listen friends oh we can't never let the spirit of God I'm just going to go ahead and say it I'm not going to let no Spirit back me into a corner afraid to speak the truth I've prayed afraid to preach the message with a bear a knuckled with no kid gloves I say what our churches need is the bare knuckle gospel that's the only way that you'll break the chains in people's life we can't be afraid to declare the gospel and I believe there's a church of Believers that'll say preach the word give me the pure word of God give it to me brother don't sugarcoat it how many would agree with that here tonight don't sugarcoat it don't walk around me don't dance around me speak it brother speak the truth of the word of God I want to go free and I need the truth to set me free foreign we became so afraid that we would offend somebody but the true gospel the truth the truth has always been and will always be a bold word that doesn't care about your feelings come on friends I'm preaching on Spirits here tonight I I don't know you and I don't I know only a few you I'm not from here this isn't you know I'm just taking some I'm just a preacher here tonight you'll get rid of me and and brother Aaron will be back I think anyway on Sunday but I'm just preaching against Spirits because I know this I know this is a spirit it's a spirit that affects the it's in the atmosphere of the world that you live in and if we're not careful we ingest some of those same feelings some of those same but some of those same ideas it's became to a place to where I'll just go ahead and preach it today it's became to a place that men are afraid to say Amen with their voice to the word of God in church it became to a place to where men I sometimes look around and say where's the men were you mice where's the men where's the man that'll speak where's the men that'll declare I'm not just talking about what's your vocal cords I'm talking about taking a stand for what's right taking a stand for the truth of the word taking a stand for the message of the hour do you know why brother Brandon preached at schools and gyms and auditoriums there I'm thankful for the high school for letting us in here today thankful for the Ramada Inn thankful for you know why he was preaching in Haas in hotels and gyms because the churches shut the door and when you're really preaching the truth when you're really preaching the true gospel not the watered down not the 2.0 version you know as my dad likes to say like message you have the message of the hour then you have message light any software Engineers we got in here you know what I'm talking about you have like the light version of it you know just don't don't make it so extreme just sort of quote it you know I'm just going to say a phrase a lot of people preach about the message not married many preach the message you can preach about it and never preach it Lord where you got me tonight even while brother Branham is preaching the Rapture message there's men at the back of the exit doors waving their hands saying stop stop this is what the prophet of God had to deal with as he's preaching the Rapture message oh I think of that I say God I wish I could have been there I would have raised my hand I would have stood to my feet I would have said preach at brother Branham preach the word of God for Faith cometh by sharing and sharing of the word of God and if somebody won't preach they'll never hear it if somebody won't declare it and speak it it'll never get sent but I want to say Lord use my voice use my vessel Lord let me declare the truth that'll set free he's got men saying stop he went too long come on brother brother Branham come on just stop it stop it you you've gone too long I'll tell you what though brother random didn't stop he didn't stop preaching and I say thank God he didn't stop preaching the Rapture message what an important message oh no wonder all hell wanted to stop it no wonder there were spirits of resistance listen friends if you preach the truth there'll always be spirits of resistance yep that's right there'll always be a spirit of resistance that tries to get you to water it down you know message light you know message 2.0 let's re let's rearrange this thing let's re you know get people who say they believe it but you know they really don't if it really comes down to it you know I'm just going to go ahead and say what brother what a prophet of God said you know you don't have to convince a Believer you don't have to convince him they just believe it because they're a believer and the prophet of God he would deal with that Spirit of resistance that would try to stop the message from going forth I wrote these notes just to myself when I was reading this I know a True Believer knows that the masses of the world can never receive this truth I know that it's not supposed to be a popular gospel after all it was the Gospel that Jesus when he preached it it got him crucified when Paul preached it it got his head chopped off when Peter preached that God hung upside down on a cross when John preached to God and tried to boil him in hot water but she couldn't blow the holy ghost out of a True Believer listen friends it's always been the rejected gospel there's a reason the Apostle Paul would say I am not ashamed I am not ashamed of the Gospel why would he have to say that unless there was a reason to declare boldly I just want to say they might make it a shame but I want to make my stand and raise my hand and say I'm not ashamed of the truth I'm not ashamed of the true message of the hour I'm going to declare it just as he said it because the carnal mind always reasons and rationalizes and questions right hello let me say this friends if the devil can do anything he'll try to get us together he would try to get us if the devil can do anything to the church the prophet of God said he will try to get them to hybrid to take the truth but then to hybrid it to mix it let me just say this message can't be mixed if it's mixed it won't work you mix it with your idea it won't work mix it with your Doctrine it won't work mix it with your opinion it won't work mix it with Pentecostalism it won't work mixed it with Baptist theology it won't work you've got to just get the unadulterated pure word of God if you try to mix it it loses its effect it loses its power it's the prophet of God said you know many people believe Jesus was a Healer he said you know many people believed he was a prophet even the Muslims believe he was a prophet and he said many people believed he was a prophet some people believed he was a good killer and he said in Jesus brother Brandon said that he was and he said you know some people believe that he was a great scholar prophet's words not mine and he was that's what brother Brandon said he said he was a good scholar he said he was a good healer brother man says but you know if all you believed was that he was a good man then that's all you'd get from him isn't that a powerful statement if all you believed was a Healer he'd get healed of the body you're blind you get get your eyes open that's wonderful he said if all you believe that he was a good teacher then all you got from him well all you got from him was his teaching don't you see the pattern however you view him as what you'll receive from him that's some friends I'm gonna go ahead and bring it on down if all you see this message is is just another good man who had a good idea he was a good reformer he brought a little bit more truth to the word of God if all you see him if all you see the messages is books and tapes and doctrines and that's all you're going to get from it brother Brandon says but those who believed he was the Lamb of God he was the word made flesh to them he didn't just seal their bodies he saved their souls what do you think would have happened if Abraham wouldn't have believed and called Melchizedek my Lord what would have happened had he not viewed him for who he was but because he can see him for who he was he could change his body and I'm just going to say when you view this message and hold it in an arm's length and skeptical over it doubting it question ah not so sure about this and not so sure about that part and we don't really need to preach that we don't need to say that I'm not so sure that was brother Brandon's opinion and you know do we really come on we're in 2023 and I don't that's you know that's brother man was a little bit out of his era a little bit out of his time and you know lived in a different age and lived in different friends I'm preaching on spirits do you realize if you deduct and reduce it you sell yourself short of what it can do for you oh we don't need to hear it anymore we don't need to we don't need to you know what is it amazing you have one group saying all you do need to all you need to do is hear it just push play I said this to our church back home and I don't say this to you I'll tell you just what I told them I said you know we're we're we don't battle that there are some certain places that would battle a spirit to try to deify brother Branham and try to make him more than he was and try to you know uh you know uh try to deify his words and and try to say that his voice was the literal voice of God you know there there'd be a spirit that would try to say that would try to deify things and there's a spirit that would try to say push play and we don't need preachers we don't need you know you you we there were let me just let me tell you what I told him I said you know that that may be some places would battle trying to deify brother brandeman try to deify the message but I'll just be honest back home we that's not a spirit we'd ever battle our church was born right out of the world we don't have people that have been in the message for generations and generations and affected by this camp and this Doctrine and this idea there's people born right out from this right on the street so they love the message of the hour they love all of it they never battle or struggle with trying to Dee a fire put brother Branham higher than he was and deify him so you know what I said so I guess that means that we're just off the hook I mean devil won't even after come after us we'll never deify him I said no but you got to recognize if that's not our battle if our battle is not to deify him then it will be to de-emphasize him and if you're either battling one or the other because the Satan brother Brandon said Satan will kick you off to one ditch or to the other ditch try to make you extreme on one of the other let me just say to you in a world in a time where they're saying push play I say push play in a time where they're saying push play the tapes I say play the tapes preach the word of God be instant be in season be honest I'm not going to let a voice that that goes to the extreme kick me off and not listen to The Rapture message I'm going to feed on the word of God don't let a scarecrow try to push you away and make you extreme on something else friends we've got the mind of Christ we know what he wants done with his word and how does it be very simple just as ABC as I can be here tonight if you're not hearing the message of the hour the tape voice of God's prophet if you're not hearing and your diet and what you feed upon is just a feed because I'm afraid in 2023 that's really what people do is they get on their feed you ever realize what it's called a feed because it's feeding you something and it feeds you anxiety whether you realize that or not and it feeds you fear listen you go and feed on the news all you do is feed on the news I'd try to stay away from it I follow some of it but I'll just be honest with you when I read too much of it I get nervous and I wasn't nervous before I get anxiety and I didn't have that before I get worried and I didn't have that worry before sometimes we all got anxiety I got I got I got fear and people say that all the time and I'm sorry I got so much anxiety sometimes do we realize that the very thing that we're saying that we don't want we're feeding that very thing and the very thing we want free of the very things that we're ingesting is what's feeding that anxiety and that fear that Facebook feed that Snapchat feed that Tick Tock feed that Instagram feed I don't even know all the feeds I'll be I'll be straight up with you I'm pretty uh out of character for my age I'm not I'm a young guy but I don't I don't know all the the I'm pretty outdated I guess as someone told I was trying to make a reel and I didn't know what a real was and they wanted me to make a real so I'm I thought it was a b-real my daughter said she had a thing called be real and I thought that's what we were it's a real so I thought it was the same exact thing I had no idea people text me all the time and I don't text them back and I tell them I'm telling you I'm call me if you want me call me because I'm not good at texting I don't I won't a lot of times won't respond and I'm not a rude person but I'm just not I'm not caught up with that I don't know where that came from but that was free but we're not careful we feed on the wrong things I'm going to say this and I'm obeying the Holy Ghost here tonight how do you think you will take a Rapture if you're not hearing the Rapture message how do you think you'll receive a body change if you're not hearing a message that can change your body oh brother Matt are you saying you believe that faith that Rapture and Faith lays on the tapes I do not the mechanical not the device not the mechanics brother just heard brother Brandon say it today God never uses the instrumentality of mechanical devices he uses the instrumentality of man you see friends when I hear the voice of God's Pride I don't hear a voice from Earth I hear a voice from heaven I don't hear what I hear is not Earthly brother Bernie it's unearthly it's otherworldly I hear from my theophany I hear I hear who I am I hear where I came from I hear where I'm going how do we think we'll have a body change if we're not hearing the body change message if we're not listening to a message that brings change don't you see why there would be a spirit that would try to come in our message churches to tell us to stop quoting brother Branham stop stop it you preachers stop it stop quoting him brother Brandon just quote just preach the message but you ain't got to say brother Brandon said and brother Brandon said and brother Brandon said you ain't got to say that you say brother Matt yeah I've been told I'm telling you that's a real spirit don't say don't quote brother Brandon so much haven't we got beyond the point I'm the ones of Paul one's a cephas are you not carnal listen first you're such a perversion people use any kind of scripture they want to try to fits their narrative or their Doctrine we don't need to quote a prophet we don't need to say brother Brandon don't quote it let me just read you Luke 18 verse 31 you got to know you got it you want to turn there turn with me Luke chapter 18 verse 31. let me hear the rustling of the leaves here let me hear those bibles if you got it on the screen you can do that if you can brother John Luke chapter 18 verse 31 notice this the Bible says then he took unto him the twelve this is Luke 18 verse 31. then he took unto him this is Jesus he took unto them the twelve and said unto them behold we go up to Jerusalem and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the son of man shall be accomplished Luke chapter 20 verse 24 verse 25. just a few chapters over Luke chapter 24 verse 25 says then he who's he Jesus said unto them o fools and slow of heart to believe all somebody say all to believe all that the prophets have spoken I'm just one of those who believe it all I'm one of those people brother Matt you see one of those I'm one of them thank God I can say I'm one of them I believe all that he said he said it fools and slow hurts to believe all that the prophets have spoken here's Acts chapter 24 chapter 3 verse 24 Acts 3 verse 24 yay this is Paul yea and all the prophets from Samuel and all those that follow after as many as have spoken have likewise foretold of these days yay all the prophets what was Jesus saying because the prophet said that it might be fulfilled by the words of Isaiah what was it do you realize Jesus Christ lived and preached constantly under the knowledge that he was quoting the prophets he was quoting the prophets you just read acts there's the Apostle Paul and he said this is Paul says that the prophets speak all the prophets from Samuel here's Matthew chapter three I know I'm going all over the place just listen here's Matthew chapter 3 now in those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea saying repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand for this is the one referred by Isaiah the prophet oh quit quoting those prophets well John didn't quit Paul didn't quit Jesus didn't quit then I'm not going to quit quoting a prophet Hallelujah you know what you have all through the New Testament I can read you Matthew 8. I can read you Matthew 12. uh that it might be fulfilled saying he took our infirmities and poor art then Jesus withdrew from there many followed him he healed them and he warned them not to make known in order that it was fulfilled the word spoken through Isaiah the prophet so no I'm not going to quit quoting a prophet if Jesus didn't if Paul didn't if John didn't then I just go go ahead and say any spirit that would try to get me to stop quoting a prophet is from the pits of hell what did Peter say about Acts chapter 2 others Malkin said these be full of new wine uh these and Peter standing up saying right bread and Brethren they're not drunk as you suppose see and it's uh you know but the fourth out the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel let me say this to you my brother my sister Satan doesn't hate preachers he don't hate preachers in fact he's got quite a few of them he hates what's being preached so as long as you're palpable and as long as you're stylish as long as you're relative as long as you're in touch as long as you're saying the right things given the right cliches just floating around it you know dancing around it but you never really come out and say as long as Satan doesn't mind that Satan doesn't mind that kind of a gospel in fact it would be Satan himself who would anoint anoint anoint preachers and teachers the Bible says that they would Heap unto themselves it would be Satan it would anoint people's hearts in the last days to Heap the Bible says to Heap to keep unto themselves second Timothy chapter four if you have your Bible turn there and read it with me II Timothy are on the screen chapter 4 verse 1. notice this this from Timothy this is Paul to to Timothy a young preacher and he says I charge Thee I love this I charge thee you know you know Timothy if I was going to give you a piece of advice and you know I mean maybe a good idea let me give you some good wisdom listen friends this ain't what this was this was a commission by the church age messenger to the ministry I charge you in other words I command you Timothy notice how it gets how sober he gets I charge thee before God and the Lord Jesus Christ who shall judge the quick stay alive and the dead it is appearing in his kingdom preach the word be instant in season out of season reproof rebuke make him feel good give them all the feel-good vibes put a coffee shop in so they can drink a latte you know this is just rub them the right way pet them the right way give them all that they want to hear listen friend don't you know that this is the modern church and it's filled up with Millions thousands of people that the music is involved the music is feel good it's all emotional it's sensual or the way that makes you feel it and I came there because I just felt so good and I felt like I could go and face the world and I just felt like all my problems are going to dissolve did you hear about Jesus did he preach about your sins oh no I didn't hear none of that kind of you know down and drowsy weary you know put away that kind of stuff just tell me what I want to hear tell come on friends this is a spirit in this in the last days don't you realize this is the same spirit that tried to anoint the children of Israel when they shut the mouth of Jeremiah and they locked him up and azerai locked him up in a prison and said I don't want to hear your words anymore even Mikea the Bible says that a lion Spirit went out and a lion's Spirit got about it all upon a bunch of preachers listen had I had my chaos been a people pleaser had he been looking for the accolades of men he would have just got another lying Spirit but he said I don't care if you kick me out I don't care if you run me out you may never invite me again I'm gonna preach the word I'm going to give you the truth you know what they said Jeremiah Prophet this is exactly out of the Bible on the radius right right from you right from the Bible prophets prophesy not and Sears Sears C naught it's right out of the word it's a spirit that God on the children of Israel prophets prophesy not Sears don't see in fact this is what they said prophesy unto us good things prophesy unto us things that are appeasing things that we like things that we want to hear prophesying does good tidings just tell us what we want to hear just tell us this is the spirit on the age my brother my sister Paul says preach the word verse 2 be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke but we don't like rebuke but I don't want to be reproved if you're a son or daughter of God you could say if it tears me apart if you give me a good gospel speaking I'll be honest enough to admit it sometimes I need a good spanking spiritually all right I'll put both my hands up for you and my foot I sometimes I need a good gospel spanking sometimes I need to be told the truth sometimes if anybody told you wrong turn around go the other way you made a mistake throw down your pride as the prophet said stomp your pride under your feet and say lord it's not my brother it's not my sister it's me O Lord standing in the need of prayer give me the truth tell me who I am preach the word beings to exhort with all long-suffering and Doctrine for here's a prophecy verse 3 for the time the day the hour the age will come and I'll tell you Apostle Paul it's right here for the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine but after their own lusts they'll go to the bar stool they'll go to LSD they'll go to methamphetamine oh this isn't who he's talking about there's more hope for that man on the bar stool than many a people that sits with a suit on in church because the prophet of God said the worst Spirit you can receive is a religious spirit some of the hardest Devils to break is not the alcohol it's not that not the myth it's not the sex it's not the drugs some of the worst hardest Spirits in a man is when the unclean Spirit leaves a man and he goes and gets seven more Spirits uh worse than the first and it becomes religious I'm right you can't tell me nothing that's not my truth might be your truth but it's not my truth I know God I got my own relationship with God I know Jesus for myself I don't doubt you know a Jesus just not the one that I know for the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine but after their lusts shall Heap unto themselves teachers having you ever had that you ever had an itchy ear man there's nothing worse because it seems like no matter how much and what you do it's like it's beyond the eardrum it's just there and you can't get rid of it this is the spirit that comes on the people the church the religious people of the last day they shall Heap unto themselves teachers give me what we want to hear just those catch phrases that sound good those cliches listen friends those sound good but they won't set you free there's only one thing that will set you free that's the truth and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned into Fables I'm going to read you this out of the message translation not the message but Eugene Peterson's message it's a Bible translation you can get some of it's pretty good I'm going to read it to you right out of the message you're going to find this is second Timothy 4. he's telling Timothy you're going to find that there will be times when people will have no stomach for solid teaching but will fill up on religious junk food opinions that tickle their fancy they'll turn their backs on truth and Chase mirages I love this and he says but you in other words don't matter what everybody else is doing but you keep your eye on what you're doing except the hard times along with the good I'm going to read you right out of what the message translation says you don't believe me you'll get it for yourself I'm going to read it keep the message alive yeah do a thorough God do a thorough job as God's servant and I want to say in a generation where they want spiritual junk food I want honey from The Rock in a day when they just want their appetite and their carnal uh lust uh you know satisfied there's a people Lord that wants your word that says if it cuts me if it hurts me if it hurts my feelings then pray telling me anyway preach to me anyway give me the word Lord give me the word Lord we're out of time and just go can I just go a few more minutes in a world where they don't want the truth and they've homogenized things and they've mixed things and it came to a point to where you know everything's just rationalized and everything's just just as long as it makes sense to me as long as it appeals as long as it appeals to my understanding you know we've gotten to a place to where we've homogenized things and if we're not careful we can homogenize the message and hybrid it I'm gonna read you what brother random says how to Modern events made it clear by prophecy 1965 December 6th we find out Balaam of course he couldn't see went out and looked upon the people said now just a minute we're a great big people up here we're you're just a scattered Bunch you see we all believe the same God we all believe the same this is what he said where all does it come on come on brother matters we don't have to make ourselves so different you know we can sort of mix with them a little bit here and there and you know we believe all the same that's true they all believe the same God brother Brandon says they all worship Jehovah look at balaam's sacrifice look at the sacrifice of Balaam seven altars you think he was spiritual looked good sounded good felt good brother Branham says this away with experiences for measuring the line it's not just because you feel it not just because I declare it not not just not just because let me let me just say this brother the truth is not what I say it is hello the truth is what any preacher says just because I scream and I yell and I get red that don't make what I'm saying true come on doesn't matter how educated I am either if I am I educated intellectually I could draw it all out it all makes sense I know the Greek I know the Hebrew nor the Aramaic no the Hebrew no all the languages and I got it all perfectly put together that don't make it true listen just because I say it's what the Bible says I'm not though I'm not the Arbiter of Truth I'll just go further and say I'm not big because I say it's what the message says just because I say it's what the message is that don't make it what it is what any man tries to say the message of the hour is this and the message is the no brother it says listen friends that doesn't make it what it is who God's Prophet was is not who I say it is it's not who you say it is either he is who the word said he was the word is the limit is limit is cut to the Chase and say it this way the word the truth speaks for itself huh brother Adam says we're all the same look notice what balaam's sacrifice was seven altars and it God's perfect number he's got seven churches he's got seven Rams speaking of of the coming of the Lord fundamentally he was just as fundamental as Moses was but you see there wasn't a divined Vindication they were both Prophets but under Moses's Ministry I love this there was a supernatural Pillar of Fire a light that hung with the camp there was Divine Healing there was a shout of the king in the camp there was Great Signs Divine Healing wonders performed among them it was a sign of a living God among his people fundamentally they was both right and Balaam tried to persuade people and bewitched them into it when just before they reached the Promised Land do you realize what happens just before we reached the promised land of bewitching spirit comes into the church brother Branham says the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church trying to defile it making it lukewarm formal cold and Powerless but the prophet of God says the true church WIll discern and withstand that Antichrist spirit you say how am I going to do it brother Matt the word if there was ever a time to hear the message of God's prophet in your ears it's now if I didn't say anything to you and I might have I might have made a mess of this sermon tonight if I didn't say anything else let me just stop here and say there's never been a greater time for you to hear the voice of vindication and it's not brother Matt it's not a brother down the road it's not a brother down the street listen there was one Ministry that was Vindicated by the pillar of Fire hello and if you ever needed a time to hear that message listen friends the message was not brother branham's message and if all you get it was it was brother Brandon's message then you won't receive what God has for you to receive it was the Angel's message delivered from Heaven to the Earthly messenger and when you hear it you better not hear it just hear you better hear it right here listen friend it wasn't John John didn't write the book of Revel John's Book of Revelation is not John's book the Revelation let me read it to you of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him and he delivered it to his servant John what was John he was just the Scribe he was just the one writing it down the prophet was just a eunuch he didn't have any thought of his own it wasn't his message he was just the Mailman but the message came from the throne it came from above it came to the down to the Earth to give to be given to a people who could believe it who wouldn't question it who wouldn't doubt it but say I accepted Lord just the way it was spoken I accept it wasn't his message do you realize when you tamper with the message you're not tampering with a message from a Kentucky hillbilly you're tampering with the same angel that came to Moses that came to Joshua that came to Paul it wasn't his message he was just the messenger and so many people get messed up and messed up on on the messenger it's not the messenger that I'm worshiping it's the message it's not the messenger that I receive I receive the message listen friends you can't separate the message in the messenger you can't such oh come on Lord I'm just going to go ahead and say it people will try to separate the Bible in the message that's an antichrist Spirit that'll take you down a road of defilement lukewarmness and coldness you try to separate the Bible from the message I'll hold the Bible here and the message is here and I always put the Bible here because the Bible listen friends what do you think the Bible was it was a it was God breathed God moved and inspired men to write it down and so listen this wasn't brother Brandon's message I don't know why I'm here but I'm here and I'm going to keep on preaching wasn't brother Brandon's message it was a message from the angel this is Aaron brother Brandon say it and today go read early experiences and listen to how the angel came to me and brother Brandon said if I had a hundred Angels standing in front of me I could identify that one Angel who came to me if I heard the voices of a hundred other angels I could tell you that one's voice I can see him he says he's got his hands like this dark complexion you think brother Brandon you think brother Brandon as the prophet of God said he said I could hear him there oh my knees and he said I heard him coming up the stairs walking through the house and he said that light that Whirlwind that came what was it it was an angel a signifying angel brother Madam says notice what they say fundamentally that was that was both right and he Bewitched them into it just before they reached the Promised Land let me just go ahead and say to you friends your intellectual mind will always reason and try to rationalize and try to make sense of and try to deduct and try to gotta make sense to me that's a spirit from your carnal mind not your spiritual mind the spiritual mind believes the word it doesn't matter if you understand it or not like the man said to the boy man are you crazy you really believe Jonah was swallowed by by a whale you really believe that little boy gave him a good answer so they listen to me buddy I believe it if it said Jonah swallowed a well I don't care what the Bible says I believe the word of God I'm not going to doubt the word of God I'm going to question the word of God I hear the voice of God when I read the word of God when I hear the word of God it's not the words of man it's the words from Jehovah your carnal mind will always try to reason it rationalize it make sense of it but let me just say this truth is the only thing you need that will set you free it is the absolute it is the boundaries it is how everything in my life I just testifies measured is what the truth says not what a scholar says come on Friends not what a person says not what anybody tells me but what the word of God says I'm going to close I'm going to close all right as brother Diggs says don't get scared The Voice of Truth speaks it's not in a human dialect it can't be understood by it understood by human intellect I could try my best to get you to understand it I could teach it I could you could even intellectually understand my teaching you can say aha I see it oh it all makes sense now I get it two plus two equals four and a lot of people have this kind of understanding of the message they understand serpency they understand uh predestination they they understand these things intellectually but listen friends it takes God to reveal it to you and only God can do that to give you a personal revelation that's why the prophet said if you could pray for anything say God give me Revelation for with Revelation in my life the gates of hell can't Prevail against me but I'll Prevail against them can you say Amen to the word tonight God is a god of truth it's a it's it's a it's a it's a message of truth it's a message it's a Voice of Truth and it can't be rationalized it's not to be rash that's why rationalism says it's only if I understand if I understand it then I can believe it you've really came really short sold yourself short of all you can believe is what you see and what you understand heard a man say that at a funeral and he said you know he said it'd be so not believing in things you can't see be like being in a boat in the ocean and looking as far as you can see to that Horizon and saying you know what that's all there is that's all there is that's all there is because that's all I can see there's nothing beyond that just take that boat a little bit further and you realize that was just your horizon of what you thought all there was there's much more Beyond this as brother Brandon says old friends if I can just tell you there's a world waiting when you breathe your last breath it's a world of reality it's a world of truth it's a world where there's no fear oh how many want that it's a world where there's no stress there's no anxiety there's no trouble there's no pressure oh I'm just going to raise my hand and say Lord I desire that I believe I can have that here on Earth I believe I can have a piece of heaven you say brother Matt how do I get that place where there's no anxiety where there's no questions where there's no more doubts where there's no more fears where there's no more words let me just tell you what you got to do is just unplug your cord from this world and start plugging into the word of God and receive from that word a message of truth that will tell you who you are who you really are where you really came from and where you're really going in a world of fear and anxiety and trouble and and struggle I'm so glad in my life I'm so glad I've got something that can tell me when I'm questioning them when I'm doubting when I'm worried and when I'm fearful I'm saying brother Matt do you get that way oh my brother and my sister we live in a world where if we're not careful we ingest some of those very same things and we're filled with the world of Doubt criticism and critics and Skeptics and skepticism brother random says in the message the seventh seal I'm going to close right here I went to a man not long ago he come to me rather he'd been arguing all around everywhere against Divine Healing and he come up and he said I don't believe in Your Divine Healing I said Ma I guess it wouldn't be any good because I ain't got any brother man who says but God's perfect he said there's no such a thing I said a year too late to say that buddy you've done waited too long for that you might have argued with me a few years ago but there's another age coming on now there's Millions to testify I said you're too late for that now fella he said well I don't believe it I don't care what you do I said certainly you can't you see he said smite me blind if you got the Holy Ghost like Paul smite me blind brother Madam said how can I you're already blind your father has blinded you to the truth and you're already blind he said I wouldn't believe it I don't care what you can do how much evidence you could prove or anything like that I still don't believe it I said certainly it wasn't for believers for unbelievers it was only for believers well what was it brother Brandon says see you know right then the election's off just don't fool with it at all if we're not careful we get to a place to where we argue and argue and argue and argue and argue you know God's Prophet wouldn't argue even with a man Dr best who tried to get him to come to a debate and brother Branham Holy Spirit told him he could go to the meeting but not to get up and say anything and so so it's brother uh uh uh uh forget the brother's name at this time but they're that brother is is you know is debating with with this man Dr best but brother Branham wouldn't brother Bosworth and brother Brandon Whitney we got to a place to where we can argue and if listen friends brother Mike don't have the choir before you but he talks about the church how they became powerless and and he said the only thing they had was the power of argument we're not careful we let the devil get into us into a corner to where we got to argue everything come on somebody we gotta argue with everything because you know we we got to have a quest we got to have an answer to every man right you know doesn't the Bible say to be ready to give an answer you know to every man about the hope that lies within you listen don't let the devil pervert that scripture that doesn't mean that you have to answer every question even the Paul possible right after that would say foolish and unlearned questions don't even give a reply to I'm just going to go ahead and say it you don't need to research this message it's already been Vindicated I'm going to say that again you don't need to research the message it's already been Vindicated I say like the like brother Brandon said you come too late for that buddy I've already got something in my heart I like the blind man said how Jack what happened I don't know all I know is I once was blind and now I can see I once was lost but now I am failed it's already been revealed to me you don't need to you don't need to research it young people I mean just go in and tell you no more than I need to research the Bible you better research it brother you better look at all the texts brother Matt you better study those manuscripts Aleppo codex and the masoretic text and you better listen I love those kind of things but that ain't where my faith comes from my faith isn't in the written word because the what the Bible says the letter Kenneth but the spirit giveth life you better so you better understand it better on intellectually understand all the manuscripts and text you you know where that came from came from the pits of hell it came from intellectual men trying to approach a supernatural God and now you have textual criticism you have textual variants and there's different translations and Mark 16 was that listen friends you don't need to question you don't need to answer the questions of unbelievers I give it to you like I'm my good buddy a brother Wayne Lawson says those are not my questions thank you brother Wayne those are not my questions so why would I try to answer them don't try to answer the questions of unbelievers because they're coming from a position of unbelief they are asked from a position of Revelation they're asked brother Matt why are you going down here well you see when I signed up for this I said Lord I'm your servant and I'll just say what you want me to say they're not my questions I don't need to answer the questions of an atheist they're not my questions it's a perversion of scripture to say we need to have an answer to every man that's not what first Peter is it first Peter I think First Peter chapter three it's not about First Peter chapter 3 saying but that that's not what the Bible said I could give you the example after example after example in the book of Acts how they answered their questions how pal the how the church the first church listen friends what you'll find is you won't find an example of Peter or John becoming Scholars and debating with Scholars on a scholarly level you won't find that in the Bible come on friends give me the support you won't find them getting a chalkboard and saying you know I'm gonna lay it all out you know what because that's not how the church started what does the book of Galatians say oh you foolish Galatians you having begun in the spirit are now going to be perfected by the flesh it was a spiritual work that started it's got to be a spiritual work that finishes it it was a red church built on Revelation it was a church built on the unexplainable that it's got to be the unexplainable and Revelation that finishes the work that the church started on Jesus came to Peter didn't say hey buddy you know there is Peter with his net and he's throwing it out and John and they're casting there and Jesus says hey uh hey uh excuse me uh sir uh sir can I have just a minute of your attention and Peter you know sort of look God took his net and what you got to say buddy well uh Jesus would say uh well can I show you in the book of Isaiah let me just got one minute let me come here and Peter looks over there okay what you got look over here right here in the book of Isaiah you know it says that you know Behold a virgin shall conceive and and that his name shall be called and over here in the book of Jeremiah you see this text over here and Peter said oh okay I I think I I think I see where you're coming from you know I can I I think I can rationalize it well now what does it say over here in the book of of uh of Isaiah okay yeah and Jesus says well see see over here and lines up over here and then I'm saying you know what and you know that he'll come right on don't get the photo of an ass and I just came in in Jerusalem and all those things make sense they all line up see it see it in scripture see it and then Peter goes you know let me go back to my pastor let me study that for a week and let me get back to you is that how Jesus started his church let me tell you actually how he started it the Bible says he walked up to him and he spoke words come follow me and the Bible says immediately they dropped their Nets and they followed him why because my sheep know my voice and a stranger they will not follow I hear the voice of my shepherd and the voice of my shepherd and is speaking to me when I hear the word of God it's not the voice of intellect it's the voice of God spoken to my soul it's not my mind that understands it it's my soul it says amen Lord I believe it Lord yes that's nothing but the truth Lord Jesus you'll never find Paul you never find John intellectually arguing with carnal men on the contrary you will find them simply quoting the word and if there's a seed that seed will hear that voice and if there's not they won't argue but the modern churches so analyzed the Bible so analyze scripture from a scientific approach that when they're done I'm talking to you about church religion two-thirds of Christian theologians is what I'm talking about may shock you it may shock you to learn that that there's a mass of Scholars of Bible scholars men who get up by and pulpits and preach that don't believe the Book of Revelation should have been in the Bible that don't believe Daniel remember the Andrew we're just talking about it that don't believe Daniel was actually written at the time of Daniel but it was added later because of how specifically he prophesied about Antiochus epiphanies and about the different Empires that would raise up so they say it's impossible it's it's too Supernatural for us it's got to be added later I'm talking about not atheists these are Christian men's Christian Scholars who believe this How Could You Believe in a god I'd throw the Bible out if I believe that right I'll just be honest heard a Christian scholar say that the other day about Sodom and Gomorrah he was thankful they found the cities of Sodom and gomor I'm not going to go into that but he made a comment he said you know to be honest with you and not Christian faith I always just looked at Sodom as a mythical part of the Bible I thought a mythical did you just say that a mythical you know what they found the pilot Stone we were just in Israel and seen it that the inscription did you know that before the 50s or 60s whenever that stone was found the most Christian Scholars men who get up Dallas Theological Seminary trained would intellectually tell you that they've deducted a reason to rationalize the Pontius Pilate actually never existed that that was added to the Bible there was a man but his name wasn't Pontius Pilate they just made it up you know what happened in the 60s they found the pilot Stone and on that stone is Pontius Pilate and guess what all the scholars said ah we were wrong there actually was a man named Pontius Pilate note I said I'm so glad long before they found the stone I believe there was a man named Partners pilot long before men have their intellectual answers there's a Believer down inside of me that says I believe it Lord I accepted just the way you spoke it they've analyzed scripture from a scientific approach and when they're done Mark 16 was added the woman at the well was added later there's mythical parts of the Bible they Chuck on anything that seems unreasonable to believe that anything that their carnal mind can't understand they call it poetry allegorical they have textual variants and textual criticism and eschatology and hermeneutics and apologetics and you know what it does it strips the power right out of the church let me say this the supernatural Church doesn't need an explanation God interprets his word by bringing it to pass she has the word hallelujah demonstrated that's my answer you say what's your answer to the critic the word of God Has Changed Me from who I was from a creature of carnal carnality and sin and now I long for the word of God how do you know the message is true because it's transformed my whole life [Music] took a backslidden boy and to turn him into all kinds of heinous kind of things and sinful kind of things and took the desire for sin out of my life she has the word demonstrated and that's her answer you can't explain God for instance these musicians could you come if you don't I'm just going to keep on preaching musicians come if you you can't explain God you try to take a naturalistic approach to satisfy a carnal mind what you'll come up with this is a make-believer you try to take a naturalistic approach to the message trying to satisfy the carnal mind what you'll come up with as a make-believer it's the defense given to Skeptics I'm reading to you what apologetics are right out of Google so forgive Google forgive me for using it I'm going to read you exactly what apologetics are it's the defense of the Gospel given to Skeptics I'm gonna read into it's the pre it's all about the presentation of the Gospel they believe every Christian should be able to give an adequate presentation of why they have faith in Christ listen to me I'm just going to go ahead and preach it like I believe it the world does not need a presentation it doesn't need an explanation it needs a demonstration it needs a revelation can you say man that's the only thing I'm just going to rhyme it that brings transformation I love it give me a demonstration that will bring Revelation that takes away all my explanations that will bring a transformation to my life that'll one day produce a translation brother Bernie one day it'll change this body this word that I'm feeding on will one day change my very being it'll change me from corruptable to incorruptable it'll change me from carnal to to Mortal to immortality how many want to say Lord I want to be changed I want the word that I feed upon stand to stand to your feet raise those hands and say Lord I believe the word I don't doubt the word raise a hand say Lord I believe the word
