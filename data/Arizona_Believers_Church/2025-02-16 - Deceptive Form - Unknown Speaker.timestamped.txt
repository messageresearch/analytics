[0:00] to that Deuteronomy chapter
[0:02] 22 start with verse 5 the woman shall
[0:05] not wear that which pertaineth unto a
[0:08] man neither shall a man put on a woman's
[0:12] garment for all that do so are
[0:15] Abomination unto the Lord thy God if a
[0:18] bird's nest chance to be before thee in
[0:20] the way in any tree or on the ground
[0:23] whether they be youngans or eggs and the
[0:25] dam sth upon the young or upon the eggs
[0:28] Thou shalt not take the dam with the
[0:30] young but Thou shalt in any wise let the
[0:33] dam go and take the young to thee that
[0:36] it may be well with thee and that thou
[0:38] mayest prolong thy days when thou
[0:40] buildest a new house then Thou shalt
[0:42] make a Battlement for thy roof that thou
[0:45] bring not blood upon thine house if any
[0:47] man fall from th Thou shalt not seow thy
[0:50] vineyard with diverse seeds lest the
[0:52] fruit of thy seed which thou Hast swn
[0:54] and the fruit of thy Vineyard be defiled
[0:56] Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an
[0:58] ass together th th shalt not wear a
[1:00] garment of diverse sorts as of Woolen
[1:02] and linen together Thou shalt make the
[1:05] fringes upon the four quarters of thy
[1:08] vesture wherewith thou coverest
[1:11] thyself wow that's a lot amen God bless
[1:15] you you can be
[1:21] seated as you could tell from the title
[1:24] slide my uh subject today is deceptive
[1:27] form deceptive form and we're going to
[1:30] come back to Deuteronomy chapter 22 here
[1:32] in a moment and when I'm using the word
[1:34] form I have been thinking along the
[1:36] lines of something that's being
[1:37] fashioned or shaped and as we'll even
[1:41] see in here in the text that we're
[1:42] reading there's different things that
[1:43] relate to the things that we wear and
[1:46] and uh the fashion so form kind of could
[1:48] be used in different ways but just to
[1:51] give you a little bit of a peek into
[1:53] some of the things I was looking at of
[1:55] the seven uh essential elements of art
[1:58] and that's what they've distilled it
[2:00] down to two of them are shape and form
[2:03] and so there's five other ones that they
[2:04] distill art down to seven Essential
[2:07] Elements and shape I was going to give
[2:09] some slides to demonstrate this but I
[2:11] think we can all handle it but a shape
[2:13] is a flat enclosed uh area of an artwork
[2:16] that's created through lines and
[2:17] textures and color and so you could look
[2:19] at a square in a picture or on a piece
[2:21] of paper and this uh two-dimensional
[2:24] representation in media and that would
[2:26] be a shape and shapes are used for
[2:28] different reasons it can add definition
[2:30] or depth it can create focal points it
[2:32] can convey motion and in a painting
[2:36] that's just a flat twodimensional
[2:38] representation of shape but artists can
[2:41] use a trick it's a trick that can create
[2:43] the illusion of depth and that's where
[2:45] you would take a square and we've all
[2:47] done this in fourth grade math where we
[2:48] took a square and we turned it into a
[2:50] cube and all of a sudden that flat
[2:53] two-dimensional object now takes on what
[2:56] looks to be a three-dimensional shape
[2:58] and that's what makes it a form it goes
[3:00] from a shape to a form just by using our
[3:04] our minds and this depth perception and
[3:06] it's actually a way to deceive the
[3:08] viewer and to seeing something that is
[3:10] literally two-dimensional since it's
[3:12] just pencil on paper or paint on a
[3:14] canvas and it looks as if it has depth
[3:17] and so in the use of form again is like
[3:19] taking a square turn it into a cube or
[3:21] maybe uh you could have this the square
[3:23] is the shape the cube is the form and
[3:25] you could do that with a circle turn it
[3:27] into the cylinder it's actually a trick
[3:30] that causes you to see something that's
[3:31] actually not there my original title was
[3:34] going to be trumploy which is a French
[3:36] word for deceive the eye and it's a word
[3:39] in art where it's a technique that when
[3:41] you look at something you say wow that
[3:43] looks as if it travels distance that
[3:45] looks as if it's actually um has shape
[3:47] and you could grab a hold of something
[3:49] and there's a whole uh genre of art
[3:51] where people painted pictures where it
[3:53] looks like the person is coming out of
[3:55] the canvas it's actually a piece of art
[3:57] that's called trumploy that is a a a
[3:59] paint a sketch of a cow and a milk jug
[4:02] and it looks as if it's tacked onto a
[4:04] piece of wood the wood is painted
[4:06] everything's painted and it's uh it's
[4:08] just a trick to make it look like you're
[4:10] looking at a scrap of paper on a piece
[4:12] of wood there's a famous piece of art uh
[4:16] it's a painting of a
[4:19] pipe a smoking pipe and in French it
[4:22] says this is not a pipe and hundreds of
[4:25] years well maybe it's more like 60 70
[4:26] years of debates on what this painting
[4:28] means and so people have a lot of time
[4:30] on their hands but that would be it's
[4:32] done in even in a way where the the
[4:34] wording and everything it's presented in
[4:35] a way to cause the person to see
[4:38] something and consider something we
[4:40] might call them visual Illusions where
[4:43] it appears as if something has depth and
[4:45] it has uh shape more than shape it has
[4:47] some sort of uh distance to it you could
[4:50] hold it and it's a trick it's an element
[4:52] of art that actually deceives the Mind
[4:53] into perceiving width or or or depth not
[4:56] just height and length but you see
[4:58] something there on that canvas that
[5:01] gives you a little bit more of a thought
[5:03] and a feeling and that's why I'm using
[5:05] this title deceptive form I'm wanting us
[5:08] to consider this that there are shapes
[5:09] and forms that can lead us away from
[5:12] true beauty that can deceive us there's
[5:14] a fashion there's there shape and form
[5:16] and evil comes in every shape and form
[5:19] and there's ways that shapes uh uh can
[5:21] cause us to perceive motion and convey a
[5:23] meaning and and FOC focus on something
[5:26] you use a they'll use a shape in art to
[5:28] draw your ey to something and then
[5:31] there's the use of form and I'm kind of
[5:32] focusing more on this form where you
[5:34] just add a little bit more to it and it
[5:36] causes to lead us astray and I'm saying
[5:38] it's actually deceptive because it's
[5:40] leading us away from true beauty leading
[5:43] us away from things that are true and
[5:45] things that are real and tricking our
[5:47] minds into desires that are ungodly so
[5:51] that's the that's the basis for this
[5:52] title deceptive form now in Deuteronomy
[5:56] CH
[5:57] 22:5 says this and this is a very
[5:59] familiar scripture I think to most of us
[6:01] if not all of us and I am continuing on
[6:07] some of the things that we've been
[6:08] ministering on in these different
[6:09] subjects prior to this uh there's no
[6:12] question these things are um connected
[6:14] together the woman shall not wear that
[6:17] which pertaineth unto a man and I
[6:19] believe that this is what immediately
[6:21] comes to mind when anybody just
[6:22] references Deuteronomy 225 is this part
[6:25] a woman shall not wear that which
[6:27] pertaineth unto a man and there's a
[6:28] neither neither neither shall a man put
[6:30] on a woman's garment so there's two
[6:33] parts to this and it says for all that
[6:35] do so are those that do it all that do
[6:39] so are Abomination unto the Lord thy God
[6:42] Abomination here is the Hebrew word a
[6:44] disgusting thing it is something that is
[6:46] detestable abhor and it it would be foul
[6:50] or loathsome to God the they that do
[6:53] this are detestable or loome unto the
[6:56] Lord meaning this is something these
[6:59] would be people that displease God and
[7:02] if you could just catch that it says a
[7:04] woman that wears that which pertaineth
[7:05] unto a man and a man that puts on a
[7:08] woman's garment it's the wearer the man
[7:10] or the woman that is abomination you
[7:13] catching that it's that's that's what he
[7:16] dis is displeasing to him I'm going to
[7:18] run through several
[7:20] scriptures and um and I I don't want to
[7:23] go too fast but then again I don't want
[7:24] to get bogged down in it but the the
[7:26] purpose of this exercise of reading
[7:28] several scriptures is for us to see that
[7:31] there's this that there's ways that God
[7:35] was declaring his way and his nature and
[7:37] his attitude when he was giving these
[7:39] laws to Israel and he wasn't doing all
[7:42] of the laws didn't necessarily pertain
[7:44] to things that God hates uh but he gave
[7:47] them many laws to govern their lives as
[7:49] we were reading already in Deuteronomy
[7:51] that it tells us that you ought not to
[7:53] mix uh garments of diverse sorts of
[7:56] Woolen and linen together now how many
[7:58] here have violated the law this morning
[8:01] hands are going up all over the place
[8:02] because we do those things we we mix our
[8:05] our fabrics and we don't think twice
[8:07] about it but yet here God says Thou
[8:09] shalt not do it how many have a a pot a
[8:12] pot of succulents or plants that have
[8:13] diverse seeds in them and we're like
[8:16] yeah I didn't think about this you're
[8:18] think I got to go home and clean up my
[8:19] life well you realize there's a lot of
[8:20] laws and things that we read here uh th
[8:23] shalt make fringes upon the four
[8:25] quarters of thy vesture wherewith thou
[8:27] covers thyself well who's got the Fringe
[8:29] this morning who's not trimmed their
[8:32] beard the correct way and who washed the
[8:34] same pots in this sink with these other
[8:36] pots and you realize there's a lot of
[8:37] laws that that governed Israel that
[8:41] didn't necessarily track back to God's
[8:43] nature that the thing itself was
[8:46] detestable or that the person that did
[8:47] it was detestable but it was laws that
[8:49] governed their lives that may speak to
[8:52] something about God's nature and that
[8:53] his detail or it may have some type but
[8:56] the thing in itself or the act itself or
[8:58] the person doing it was an Abomination
[9:00] to God so what I'm wanting you to see is
[9:03] through several scriptures those things
[9:05] that God despised and if he despised it
[9:08] then he despises it now says in
[9:12] Deuteronomy 7: 25- 26 this would be one
[9:16] that you could follow throughout the Old
[9:17] Testament the graven images of their
[9:19] gods shall you burn with fire Thou shalt
[9:22] not desire the silver or gold that is on
[9:24] them nor take it unto thee lest thou be
[9:27] snared therein so these are Idols that
[9:30] had been fashioned by the hands of man
[9:33] overlaid with gold or silver that were
[9:35] worshiped by the Heathen and he says for
[9:37] it is an Abomination to the Lord thy God
[9:40] well what particular aspect of this was
[9:44] an Abomination well the graven images
[9:46] were Abomination the the fact that they
[9:49] were worshiped was an Abomination so
[9:51] these things God did not want them to
[9:53] take the gold and silver into themselves
[9:56] and keep it because he says it will be a
[9:58] snare to thee
[10:00] here's something that God says I hate
[10:01] this and in hating it I even recognize
[10:04] that it has this potential to influence
[10:06] you so just leave it alone neither shalt
[10:09] thou bring an abomination of thy house
[10:11] what is the Abomination the idols the
[10:13] things that were overlaid with gold and
[10:15] silver and worship lest thou be cursed
[10:17] be a cursed thing like it but Thou shalt
[10:19] utterly detest it and thou shalt utterly
[10:22] abhor it for it is a cursed thing that's
[10:25] a good definition of what an Abomination
[10:27] is something that is detested utterly
[10:29] abhor and that God is cursed what is he
[10:32] specifically talking about idol worship
[10:33] and idols and these are things and we
[10:36] could we could even say in a sense like
[10:39] maybe as a cliche anything that you put
[10:41] between you and the Lord is an idol and
[10:44] uh and and that has a great weight to it
[10:46] it's a good way to cause us to think and
[10:47] that is true and and in that sense you
[10:51] could correct the order right you can
[10:53] correct the order and and and and be
[10:56] okay say well I've I've taken this job
[10:58] and I've and I've and I that I utterly
[11:00] detest an a poor but you can take
[11:02] something and just put it in its proper
[11:04] place and it's no longer that thing
[11:05] between you and God but here these are
[11:07] things that had no other use or
[11:09] utility other than to be worshiped as
[11:12] God or as a God and that they ascribed
[11:15] things to it and there was this real
[11:17] conviction and belief that these things
[11:19] had some Worth to them and valued that
[11:21] they ought to be venerated and worshiped
[11:23] and they overlaid them with precious
[11:24] materials and they desired that they
[11:26] would speak back and they imagined that
[11:28] they spoke and they were wor worshiped
[11:30] given that faith and given
[11:32] reverence and attention as God in place
[11:36] of the true God and so it was
[11:39] Abomination to take that and put it into
[11:41] their home uh was to give Credence to
[11:44] acknowledge and to venerate a false god
[11:46] and it was utterly detested should be
[11:48] utterly abored it was a cursed thing in
[11:50] chapter 12 Thou shalt not do so unto the
[11:53] Lord thy God for every Abomination to
[11:56] the Lord which he hateth have they done
[11:58] unto their God so now there is an
[12:01] attitude of a way of worship that the
[12:04] Heathen did to their Idols that God
[12:06] uphor and he detest it and he hates it
[12:09] this is God's attitude we're talking
[12:11] about very specific things that the
[12:12] Bible says is an Abomination to the Lord
[12:15] thy God here in this chapter it say for
[12:18] in these verses every Abomination to the
[12:21] Lord is what the Heathen has done he
[12:22] hates it for even their sons and their
[12:24] daughters they have burnt in the fire to
[12:26] their gods that's quite an Act of Faith
[12:29] isn't it they their sacrific and their
[12:31] children to their gods he says what
[12:33] thingss soever I command you observe to
[12:34] do Thou shalt not add thereto nor
[12:37] diminish from it and in this particular
[12:39] instance he's saying that there's a way
[12:41] of worship of the heathens that you
[12:43] ought not to assimilate into your
[12:44] worship and there's not a requirement
[12:46] that you sacrifice your children unto me
[12:48] and to cause them to walk through fire
[12:50] and do certain things these are things
[12:52] that God hates Deuteronomy 18: 9-14 when
[12:58] thou art come into the land which the
[12:59] Lord thy God giveth theee Thou shalt not
[13:01] learn to do after the Abominations of
[13:05] those Nations those habits there's ways
[13:08] there there's a way of worship and a
[13:09] pattern of life and certain things that
[13:11] they would do that are called
[13:14] Abomination there sh not be found among
[13:16] you anyone that maketh his son or
[13:18] daughter to pass through the fire or
[13:20] that useth divination or an observer of
[13:22] times or an enchanter or a witch or a
[13:24] charmer or a consulter with familiar
[13:26] spirits or a wizard or a necromancer for
[13:29] all that do these things are an
[13:31] Abomination unto the Lord now there's a
[13:35] lot there we could unpack and take all
[13:36] those things from passing through the
[13:38] fire to divination the enchanter and
[13:40] these things that say all that would do
[13:43] those things are Abomination unto the
[13:46] Lord and it would be the same today we
[13:49] were able to find some Modern
[13:51] application or some one that would in
[13:53] practice that would do these very things
[13:55] we would say that these things are still
[13:57] Abomination unto the Lord
[13:59] and because of these Abominations the
[14:01] Lord thy God doth drive them out from
[14:03] before thee Thou shalt be perfect with
[14:06] the Lord thy God God is showing that
[14:08] there's things that are Abomination and
[14:10] let me say it this way things that are
[14:12] foul or detestable things that are um
[14:16] are not right and and it doesn't necess
[14:19] say God doesn't necessarily attach his
[14:21] own attitude towards say these are
[14:22] Abomination to me but there's
[14:24] Abominations that he's driving out
[14:26] because they can influence you and these
[14:29] very specific things he says I'm driving
[14:31] them out because they could cause you to
[14:35] transgress they could cause you to add
[14:37] or to take away they could cause you to
[14:40] stumble and as it says they should cause
[14:42] you to be cursed yourself so these are
[14:45] the influence of these things so think
[14:46] about the influence of things that God
[14:49] hates why does God hate them he hates
[14:51] them for a reason chapter 23: 18 Thou
[14:54] shalt not bring the higher of a or
[14:56] the price of a dog into the house of the
[14:58] Lord thy God for any vow for even both
[15:01] these are Abomination unto the Lord thy
[15:04] God a lot of scholarship and research
[15:07] and a lot that conclude that the price
[15:09] of a dog here it's not necessarily uh
[15:12] the dog itself but it refers to a
[15:14] sodomite so here in this you see one
[15:17] that is the higher of a and the
[15:19] price of a dog so it says prostitution
[15:21] and sodomy in themselves are Abomination
[15:24] to God and then the price of those
[15:27] things the higher of those things he's
[15:29] saying the this too would be an
[15:30] Abomination Lord don't bring these
[15:32] things into the temple cuz he's pointing
[15:35] out moral sin things that would
[15:37] transgress God's law in this moral sin
[15:40] and then the higher of it he said these
[15:42] things ought not to be brought into the
[15:43] house of the Lord so this is something
[15:45] where God says both these are
[15:47] abomination of the Lord thy God not
[15:49] necessarily the the money itself but the
[15:52] gain how it was gained and then the
[15:54] moral sin that gave rise to it you're
[15:57] catching this staying very close close
[15:59] to scripture so that we can all we can
[16:01] be adults here and it's in the word of
[16:03] God and we can do this in a way that
[16:04] pleases the Lord in Deuteronomy chapter
[16:07] 27:1 15 cursed be the man that maketh
[16:10] any Graven or molten image an
[16:12] Abomination unto the Lord a reminder
[16:14] again that false images that are
[16:17] worshiped as a god are an abomination of
[16:20] the Lord the work of the hands of the
[16:22] Craftsman and putteth it in a secret
[16:24] place and all the people shall answer
[16:27] and say Amen these things are
[16:29] Abomination it's worshiped it's
[16:31] reverenced as a God God says this is
[16:34] doesn't say don't make any graven images
[16:36] or worship it uh because that would be
[16:39] it would not be expedient he's saying
[16:41] it's an Abomination to me go back to the
[16:43] Ten Commandments Thou shalt have no
[16:45] other God before thee so this is
[16:46] something that when God gave these you
[16:48] could track it back to the attitude of
[16:51] God towards specific things things that
[16:53] he hates things that he
[16:55] despises in Proverbs 15 verse 8 and N
[16:59] you'll find there's several Proverbs
[17:00] that talk about six yay rather seven
[17:03] things that God hates it says the
[17:04] sacrifice of the wicked is an
[17:06] Abomination to the Lord but the prayer
[17:09] of the upright is his Delight then
[17:11] there's this contrast sacrifice of the
[17:13] wicked is an Abomination but the prayer
[17:14] of the uprite he loves he he desires
[17:17] that verse n The Way of the Wicked is an
[17:19] abomination of the Lord but he loveth
[17:21] him that followeth after righteousness
[17:23] what are these scriptures teaching us
[17:25] though we might say this is pretty
[17:27] General it's not specific and we don't
[17:29] know exactly what that sacrifice might
[17:31] be or what that way might be we could
[17:33] say there is a way that is wicked and a
[17:36] Way of the Wicked there is a sacrifice
[17:38] of the wicked that God abhor and he
[17:41] detests and his taste aren't going to
[17:44] change's he's going to hate it as we
[17:46] read in Malachi I'm the Lord and I
[17:47] change not just because I you haven't
[17:49] been consumed in your sins does it mean
[17:51] my attitude towards these things have
[17:53] changed I just am longsuffering still so
[17:57] there are things that are are an
[17:59] Abomination detestable utterly abhor
[18:02] hated by God in verse 26 of the same
[18:06] chapter the thoughts of the wicked are
[18:07] an Abomination to the Lord but the words
[18:09] of the pure are pleasant words here we
[18:13] have the sacrifice the way and the
[18:15] thoughts of a wicked that are hated by
[18:18] God despised and detested by God these
[18:21] are not things to say well the Way of
[18:23] the Wicked is is weird or The Way of the
[18:25] Wicked is different and The Way of the
[18:27] Wicked you shouldn't Like the Way of the
[18:28] Wicked this is not God kind of hinting
[18:30] to you and suggesting saying this is me
[18:33] as for me and my attitude towards these
[18:35] things I hate it and I despise
[18:38] it now in Deuteronomy chapter 22:5 the
[18:42] woman shall not wear that which
[18:43] pertaineth unto a man neither shall a
[18:45] man put on a woman's garment for all
[18:47] that do so are Abomination unto the Lord
[18:50] thy God what he is expressing here in
[18:53] these two uh prior phrases the woman
[18:56] addressing the woman and the man and he
[18:58] says that all that do so are
[19:01] Abomination it's connected with those
[19:03] things that God
[19:05] hates and there's other scriptures who
[19:08] say well the The Way of the Wicked the
[19:10] thoughts of the wicked and these
[19:11] different scriptures that may seem to be
[19:13] General we could bring this principle
[19:15] back to these other things that are the
[19:18] scripture observes as God's General
[19:20] attitude towards things and they connect
[19:22] back to that but if I could say this God
[19:26] these things all those that do these
[19:29] being an Abomination to the Lord and
[19:31] many of these other scriptures you read
[19:33] though they are connected or they're
[19:35] identified as what God hates they're
[19:37] more of a consequence of what God
[19:42] loves I mean kind I pick up on that
[19:45] catch that I don't know if I've already
[19:46] lost you uh with uh I don't know with
[19:50] the shapes in the very beginning but I
[19:53] hope you're focusing we can think well
[19:55] God hates those that do these things
[19:57] well it's not that he is just
[19:59] woke up that morning as a hater and he
[20:01] just wants to find something to hate and
[20:03] the first thing he sees will do but
[20:05] rather it's because of what he loves
[20:06] it's a consequence of what he loves and
[20:08] he desires God is the author of true
[20:10] beauty when God created everything there
[20:12] was something harmonious about it there
[20:14] was something beautiful about it so he
[20:15] loves the original symmetry he loves the
[20:17] harmony of beauty he loves things being
[20:19] in their original form the way that God
[20:21] originally intended them to be we've
[20:24] read from Deuteronomy 17:1 the last few
[20:27] Services Thou shalt not sacrifice unto
[20:29] the Lord thy God any bulock or Sheep
[20:31] wearing is blemish or evil
[20:33] favored why is it that God would want a
[20:36] sacrifice to be pure and to be clean and
[20:38] to be whole it's it it's what you're
[20:40] offering to God it's what you're
[20:42] sacrificing to God and it spoke it
[20:45] pointed to a perfect sacrifice which
[20:46] would be Christ so a sacrifice that has
[20:49] blemished or is evil favored is an
[20:52] Abomination unto the Lord thy God this
[20:55] evil favored is something that's there's
[20:57] a deformity it lacks wholeness and God
[21:01] loves truth he hates hypocrisy why does
[21:04] he hate hypocrisy because he loves truth
[21:07] he hates perversion evil favored would
[21:09] be some perversion he hates
[21:12] deception these are things that God
[21:13] hates cuz he he's a god of Truth he's a
[21:16] god of um uprightness these are things
[21:18] that God
[21:19] values in Proverbs 3:32 it says for the
[21:23] frow word is abomination to the Lord but
[21:26] a secret is with the righteous this frow
[21:29] word is from a the Hebrew word meaning
[21:31] to depart or to go wrong to go crooked
[21:36] or to
[21:37] pervert means actually has a meaning to
[21:39] be lost from view now think of what that
[21:42] means the FR word when something is
[21:45] crooked or perverted when something
[21:47] departs think of something that ought to
[21:50] be one way ought to be one place ought
[21:52] to represent a certain thing or look a
[21:54] certain way and when it departs from
[21:56] that or the way it's originally intended
[21:58] to be seen and used is no longer used
[22:02] for that or seen as that it's lost from
[22:04] view God hates that he hates something
[22:08] when it goes crooked or is
[22:11] perverted it is abomination to the lord
[22:15] it's not necessarily the code of conduct
[22:16] or rules that you might have uh there's
[22:20] uh maybe this is a good example but
[22:21] you've all heard of house rules that you
[22:23] go to someone's house and you're playing
[22:25] Doom Lings and they have a certain way
[22:26] that they do it in that house and that
[22:28] would be be the rules as as for me in my
[22:31] house this is how we play veiled fate as
[22:33] for me in my house this is how we play
[22:35] moonrakers and this is how it is and
[22:37] then you go to someone else's house like
[22:38] oh we don't play it that way we do it
[22:39] differently now we could say in this
[22:42] house it's wrong and in this house it's
[22:46] right and we could so even we can get so
[22:48] charged and say well that's an
[22:50] Abomination you play that way you play
[22:52] Uno that way and and some can be a
[22:55] purist and now this is the only way to
[22:56] play Uno you're not supposed to do that
[22:58] people like you mean this is the way
[22:59] we've done it our whole lives you can
[23:01] stack this you can do that you can end
[23:03] with a draw four there's ways that
[23:04] people will play it and if you play it
[23:06] differently it's Abomination but is it
[23:08] really a sin is it something that God
[23:10] hates
[23:12] debate break out into your sessions and
[23:15] debate this and and so there's things
[23:17] that we could say would be house rules
[23:20] that would be wrong and this is the
[23:21] right way this isn't a house rule this
[23:23] is God's nature these are things that
[23:27] God hates there's actually some games
[23:29] where the goal is to lie as good as you
[23:31] can and I tell you don't ever play Baler
[23:34] Dash with brother Tim
[23:37] puit he'll get you because you would not
[23:40] expect him to write that nor anybody
[23:42] else at the table like oh my goodness
[23:43] gracious why they say that and it's him
[23:45] and he
[23:47] wins Proverbs 20:10 says diverse weights
[23:50] and diverse measures both of them are
[23:53] alike Abomination to the Lord this goes
[23:57] to the heart of God who hates Injustice
[24:00] and diverse weights and measures there's
[24:02] a lot that we could share from the
[24:03] scripture other verses dealing with the
[24:05] same thing false weights are an
[24:07] Abomination to the Lord but there would
[24:09] be the use of different weights and
[24:11] different measures different Stones one
[24:13] to buy one to sell they would appear the
[24:16] same and maybe seem to be the same thing
[24:18] but you would use one you have one out
[24:20] for pretense and maybe You' have it
[24:22] there and it looks like the same but
[24:24] then you would misuse it or swap it out
[24:26] giving somebody the appearance that
[24:27] everything's
[24:29] even so you're going to you're going to
[24:31] buy something and you use one weight and
[24:33] so you get more out of it then when you
[24:34] go to sell it it looks like you're using
[24:36] the same thing but you use a different
[24:38] one so you get even more you short
[24:40] change somebody God hates that the
[24:43] diverse weights and diverse measures
[24:46] this lack of transparency in the use of
[24:48] it was very tangible in that day where
[24:50] you would think well this is this is how
[24:52] much this
[24:53] weighs and this is how much it's being
[24:56] used but then something either either by
[24:58] of hand or just by appearance sake you
[25:00] think they're the same but it's
[25:02] defrauding the purchaser or the seller
[25:05] God hates that notice God's not just
[25:08] saying no no no no that's shady don't do
[25:10] that that's not nice he's saying I hate
[25:12] it that's Abomination he's not saying
[25:15] man that's a real edgy business practice
[25:17] I wouldn't do it but you know if that's
[25:19] the way you want to do it I'm not going
[25:20] to judge you I mean it's exact opposite
[25:23] God's saying I wouldn't do it that way I
[25:25] hate you doing it that way and I will
[25:27] judge you for doing it that
[25:30] way because it goes back to God who is
[25:32] above all who is pure and these are
[25:35] things that he
[25:36] hates now if you could take that back to
[25:39] Deuteronomy 22:5 the woman shall not
[25:41] wear that which pertaineth unto a man
[25:43] neither shall a man put on a woman's
[25:45] garment for all that do so male or
[25:48] female are hated and despised and
[25:51] detested by God Deuteronomy chapter 22:5
[25:56] distinguishes between male and female
[25:58] and their type of garments you follow me
[26:01] everybody follow me men I'm speaking to
[26:03] you too because it says you shouldn't
[26:04] wear a woman's garment okay so and
[26:09] everybody what is going on here brother
[26:12] Aaron's dealing with something who's
[26:15] here Genesis chapter 1 ver 27 as I so
[26:19] often do I end up finding myself back in
[26:21] Genesis 1 chapters 1:3 but it says in
[26:23] verse 27 so God created man in his own
[26:25] image in the image of God created he him
[26:28] male and female created he them that's
[26:32] the only we don't believe in they them
[26:33] but that's a them we'll believe
[26:35] in male and female created he them male
[26:40] the word there male actually means
[26:41] recalls to mind so the male Adam made in
[26:44] the image of God recalled God's image
[26:47] zakar it recalled to mind God then at
[26:51] from man the man he created the female
[26:54] which is a piece of the male and
[26:57] something that was struck off or came
[26:59] off the
[27:00] man and so we can never get away from
[27:03] this and I think there's so much uh
[27:05] chatter and noise out there in The Ether
[27:08] to where these things they try to
[27:10] confuse them they try to amplify them
[27:12] there's been a little bit of a cultural
[27:14] kick back now where we some people like
[27:16] yeah de I is d i y i n g it's and
[27:19] everyone's excited and happy that these
[27:21] things are going to did I spell the die
[27:23] or dying whichever one it is it's being
[27:25] killed and everyone's happy and we're
[27:27] being shifted back to two genders well
[27:29] let's just settle it scripturally there
[27:31] are only
[27:33] two and so this distinction that God
[27:36] made between male and female was one of
[27:38] natures when God separated out the woman
[27:41] there was a difference in
[27:43] spirit in nature there was a difference
[27:46] in use in terms of what one was suited
[27:49] for and there was a difference in
[27:51] appearance she was equal but opposite
[27:54] Adam didn't look in the mirror and say
[27:55] is that me he didn't or look at her and
[27:57] say is that me me he he saw her as being
[28:00] complimentary a part of him but she was
[28:03] different and in Genesis 2:25 it says
[28:06] and they were both naked the man and his
[28:08] wife male and female the man and his
[28:10] wife and were not ashamed I know we've
[28:14] covered this at length in years past but
[28:16] uh for all of us here some having not
[28:18] been here before he says they were both
[28:21] naked and if we looked at that in its
[28:23] most simple sense they had no need for
[28:26] covering they were were they had no need
[28:29] of clothing whether for Comfort or
[28:32] concealment they didn't need they didn't
[28:34] need clothing because the temperature uh
[28:37] uh they needed to be shielded from the
[28:39] Sun so they get sunmer they didn't need
[28:40] clothing so they could be shielded from
[28:42] cold temperatures so they didn't need it
[28:43] for Comfort nor
[28:45] concealment because it says they were
[28:47] not
[28:48] ashamed and so they were innocent there
[28:51] was no cause for shame there was
[28:52] certainly no cause for blush in other
[28:54] words they had no uh knowledge or
[28:56] experience of something
[28:58] impure nothing had was misused and
[29:01] nothing was out of order and so there
[29:04] was no there's no sense of Shame they
[29:06] were naked without the need of covering
[29:08] I don't want you to think of it they
[29:10] were naked just in that moment but it's
[29:12] actually conveying they didn't need
[29:14] it and they were not ashamed they were
[29:17] innocent they they say that an innocent
[29:20] child who hasn't been tested or provoked
[29:22] does not have a sense of
[29:24] shame but it's through experience that
[29:27] experience replaces
[29:29] innocence so an innocent child doesn't
[29:32] have a sense of Shame and just just
[29:35] watch a
[29:37] child uh when just out here at church
[29:40] they need to go they'll go right they
[29:43] Haven an experience this sense of Shame
[29:44] and then what happens is the parents
[29:46] give them a sense of Shame and they
[29:49] realize well I didn't think there was
[29:50] anything wrong with that but I'm not
[29:52] going to do that again because I have
[29:54] been appropriately a warned uh that this
[29:56] is not right or this is not good
[29:58] behavior and we would argue that that's
[30:00] correct but there is no sense of Shame
[30:03] for the
[30:04] innocent John Wesley even said blushing
[30:07] is now the color of virtue speaking in
[30:10] his time he says but it was not the
[30:12] color of
[30:14] Innocence why would you blush if you
[30:17] didn't know something was inappropriate
[30:19] or
[30:21] immodest and so blushing we say now that
[30:24] we blush when we see something that
[30:26] isn't right but it says that blush was
[30:29] not the color of Innocence they were
[30:30] naked and not ashamed there was no blush
[30:34] so in their innocence their nakedness
[30:38] man and woman were co-equal but
[30:40] different in
[30:42] nature and their
[30:44] differences were
[30:46] uncovered due to their
[30:49] nakedness right they were different
[30:53] there was this clear and obvious
[30:54] distinction male and
[30:56] female and there was no shame in
[30:59] that but then in Genesis 3:7 after the
[31:03] fall says and the eyes of them both W
[31:06] opened and we all of us the adults and
[31:08] everyone just were jumping in after the
[31:10] original sin we know that the woman was
[31:14] caused uh to see something in a way that
[31:16] it shouldn't have been seen what once
[31:19] had shape and form she saw differently
[31:22] what once was one way she now desired in
[31:25] the wrong way so now there's a deceptive
[31:27] form
[31:29] and the eyes of them she shares it with
[31:31] her husband the eyes of them both were
[31:32] opened and they knew that they were
[31:36] naked it's not this realization all of a
[31:38] sudden where it's like oh my goodness I
[31:40] thought I had I didn't realize it's like
[31:42] that dream we all have where we show up
[31:44] at school and we're wearing our pajamas
[31:45] or just our underwear you all have it
[31:47] don't laugh at me right oh my goodness
[31:49] what am I doing here why am I they they
[31:51] knew that there was no
[31:53] clothing but now they knew that they
[31:56] were naked so now it's when that
[31:59] innocence has been replaced with the
[32:02] experience and their nakedness and and
[32:04] what it revealed meant something totally
[32:06] different now and so they sewed fig
[32:09] leaves together and made themselves
[32:11] aprons Hebrew word for that whoosh they
[32:13] made themselves aprons so the opening of
[32:16] their eyes awakened the ashame of
[32:19] nakedness and what did it cause them to
[32:21] do immediately put on
[32:23] clothing something a covering so there
[32:26] was this instinct to cover please are
[32:29] you I hope that you follow me parents I
[32:32] understand that there's maybe some
[32:34] responsibility at home if this brings up
[32:36] some questions but there was this
[32:38] instinct to cover their distinguishing
[32:41] parts and they did it by making an
[32:45] apron now notice it doesn't say and they
[32:47] made themselves a jumpsuit and they made
[32:49] themselves a um you know a onesie no it
[32:52] said they made themselves an apron which
[32:54] is that Hebrew word for loin cloth or
[32:56] girdle
[32:58] so there was this consciousness of their
[33:00] nakedness and it wasn't like I need to
[33:02] cover my skin I I could get sunburned no
[33:04] it was immediately this Consciousness
[33:07] and awareness of the female and the male
[33:10] and what made them
[33:13] different in Deuteronomy chapter
[33:17] 25:1 I hope I have that one here do I
[33:20] did I write it so if you want to just
[33:21] read this those who can
[33:24] read and and it's
[33:28] it's speaking of two people in an
[33:29] argument and then when the wife wants to
[33:31] intervene and the phrase is taketh him
[33:33] by the
[33:34] secrets it is exactly what you're
[33:36] thinking it's the same word that's used
[33:39] uh uh it comes from the same word that's
[33:41] used for loin cloth the part that
[33:43] excites
[33:44] shame and the next verse says cut off
[33:47] her hand because God's attitude towards
[33:50] it that act doing that is some violation
[33:52] but notice how the
[33:55] association of the the apron
[33:58] it was the
[33:59] secrets that which causes shame what
[34:03] they covered is what they what they
[34:05] awaken them to their shame their
[34:06] differences and how it was used they're
[34:08] awakened to their shame now as I've been
[34:11] studying this I found an argument where
[34:13] and this is a pretty aggressive argument
[34:15] because a lot of the scriptures and I
[34:17] may be using a term I haven't used to
[34:18] this point modesty a lot of the
[34:22] uh history and scholarship and research
[34:25] and academic writing on modesty traces
[34:27] back to scripture and religious
[34:29] movements and so in and it's not just
[34:33] Christianity but if Islam uh uh and in
[34:36] Judaism it's rooted in these text and so
[34:40] there's this argument that modesty is
[34:42] the creation of man upon recognizing the
[34:45] sexual power of the body that this is
[34:48] what man invented that man created he
[34:51] created this uh I think they may be done
[34:54] reading this verse so we can take that
[34:55] one down that there is this man
[34:58] recognizing the ability and capacity of
[35:01] their body male and female that mankind
[35:03] made the decision to cover
[35:07] themselves one made the statement the
[35:09] sense of modesty is merely a habit not
[35:11] an instinct in other words the sense of
[35:13] modesty is something that's imposed
[35:15] enforced but the scripture differs right
[35:18] when their eyes were open their Instinct
[35:21] was to cover themselves nobody told them
[35:24] to do it now God didn't even say hey
[35:29] Adam put some clothes on no this was
[35:32] their own Instinct so the world would
[35:34] want us to think that modesty is this
[35:36] human construct it's the patriarchy
[35:38] that's forcing us to wear cover
[35:40] ourselves wrong
[35:43] decency tells us decency tells us not to
[35:48] uh go into a grocery store without
[35:49] clothes on decency tells people to dress
[35:52] appropriately when going certain places
[35:54] the reason why there's rules and laws is
[35:56] because mankind sense of decency was
[35:58] being lost and that's when the church
[36:01] itself was leaving the true principles
[36:03] of Christ and that's when modesty
[36:07] died it's not a construct of the
[36:09] patriarchy it's not forced and imposed
[36:11] modesty is not merely a habit I think
[36:13] Maya Angelo said modesty is like a
[36:15] sticker that's placed on me in other
[36:17] words it was something that she didn't
[36:18] feel a part of it was something that was
[36:20] forced on her and that's not true
[36:22] modesty is actually the original nature
[36:24] of
[36:26] humanity that when they were awakened to
[36:28] sin they immediately covered
[36:30] themselves unless we think that
[36:32] nakedness in itself is what God desires
[36:35] in Genesis 3: 211 unto Adam also and to
[36:38] his wife did the Lord God make coats of
[36:40] skins and clothe them God instituted
[36:44] covering in light of shame in light of
[36:46] experience in light of the loss of
[36:47] innocence in light of the misuse of this
[36:50] power that God instituted clothing and
[36:52] this was a covering for the body coats
[36:56] of skin and clothed them versus the
[36:58] religion so to speak of fig leaves that
[37:01] only covered certain
[37:03] parts now he gives them the appropriate
[37:05] clothing and what is it we say they use
[37:08] the the an innocent lamb they were
[37:10] covered in the this innocence this lamb
[37:12] skin was innocent it was pure it was
[37:14] undefiled it wanted to express humility
[37:19] modesty when God clothed them with the
[37:22] Fig leaves it was almost
[37:25] suggestive right you following me I I if
[37:29] I told you right now don't look over
[37:31] there right some people instinctively go
[37:34] and you ever been at lunch and you're
[37:36] like don't look now but the person to
[37:39] your
[37:40] right right and immediately they
[37:44] look is staring right at you too late
[37:48] kind of our Instinct and so there's a
[37:49] way that they're they're drawn to and
[37:52] there's a lot of lot of back in we're
[37:54] not talking about Christian uh writers
[37:57] or or commentators but the world and
[37:59] those in fashion will say that they
[38:00] intentionally created through shape and
[38:03] zones and clothing to draw the eye and
[38:06] to cause attention when God clothed the
[38:08] man and woman it wasn't in a way to uh
[38:11] to bring your focal point to something
[38:13] but when man instinctively covered
[38:15] himself they didn't really cover
[38:17] themselves but God institutes clothing
[38:21] and God in Revelations chapter 3
[38:23] counsels the Ley in church age in verse
[38:26] 18 to ey white rment that thou mayest be
[38:29] clothed that the shame of thy nakedness
[38:31] do not
[38:33] appear and then in the New Jerusalem and
[38:36] that
[38:37] Eternal condition in Isaiah 52:1 and
[38:40] you'll find throughout the Book of
[38:41] Revelation they were clothed they were
[38:43] clothed they were clothed they were
[38:44] clothed even the lamb himself is clothed
[38:45] and those following him it says awake
[38:47] awake put on thy strength those Z put on
[38:49] thy beautiful garments oh Jerusalem the
[38:52] holy city as a bride adorned dressed
[38:55] prepared purply for her husband for
[38:58] henceforth there shall no more come into
[39:00] Thee the uncircumcised and the
[39:04] unclean put on thy beautiful garments
[39:07] dress
[39:08] yourselves this condition that God
[39:10] desires us to be in wasn't necessarily
[39:13] always originally and then always naked
[39:16] but by through sin God instituted a
[39:18] covering clothing it's the first mention
[39:20] of clothing in writing it's the oldest
[39:22] reference that they would have uh in
[39:24] many ways one of the oldest references
[39:25] to clothing is when God made coats of
[39:28] skin and clothed
[39:31] them and we see in the end in leod deia
[39:34] God is counseling for us to buy clothing
[39:36] to cover the shame of our nakedness and
[39:38] in the finality of things in this
[39:40] eternal condition we're going to have
[39:42] beautiful
[39:44] garments so this is something that
[39:47] there's a theme of this clothing and
[39:48] there's a righteous apparel there's this
[39:50] pure and white linen a a a a a dress a
[39:53] dress scene a fashion in the end that
[39:55] God loves
[39:57] so I think we're doing okay on time I'm
[39:59] not going to be able to finish this
[40:00] morning and I don't want to I know that
[40:02] already we've shared quite a bit and one
[40:04] of the most common statements I hear
[40:06] after I'm done preaching is that was a
[40:09] lot and uh kind of just is that a
[40:12] compliment help me out here they that
[40:14] was a lot that's all we're
[40:17] saying so the question is what's the air
[40:20] of wearing the Garment of the opposite
[40:22] gender only two genders male and
[40:24] female it as we read this let me just
[40:28] let's just make this assumption and
[40:30] there may be some that would want to
[40:31] attack this but the Bible is saying that
[40:35] there is a garment that only a woman
[40:37] wears and a garment that only men wear
[40:41] and that for the man to wear that
[40:43] woman's garment he becomes Abomination
[40:47] and for the woman to wear that man's
[40:48] garment she becomes Abomination so we
[40:51] could just assume that there is a
[40:53] garment that pertains to a man and
[40:55] there's a garment that pertains to a
[40:56] woman the opposite gender ought not to
[40:58] wear it so maybe we'll come back to
[41:01] those specifics later but the question
[41:02] is why is why is that error now follow
[41:06] me very carefully Now by nature and
[41:10] design the male and female are
[41:13] different once they were clothed it was
[41:16] proper to observe the same in the way
[41:18] that they
[41:22] dress amens would help if you believe it
[41:25] if it if it's something you believe
[41:28] for either male or female to dress or
[41:30] act like the other would destroy God's
[41:33] distinction of their nature of their
[41:36] role and of their character effeminacy
[41:39] in a in a man and immodesty in a woman
[41:42] damages the proper image of both that a
[41:45] man is expected to be a certain way a
[41:47] woman's expected to be a certain way
[41:49] when the man begins to have these
[41:51] feminine characteristics and act a
[41:53] certain way it destroys God's original
[41:55] image when the woman begins to assert
[41:57] your and to make herself manly that
[41:59] destroys God's original image now I I'm
[42:01] not wanting to get into differences of
[42:04] uh uh
[42:06] personalities and gray areas and I'm
[42:08] just saying that I'm wanting to you for
[42:10] you to see and to recognize that on its
[42:13] most basic level these distinctions
[42:17] exist even in
[42:19] biology
[42:21] and whether there
[42:23] be a a birth defect
[42:28] [Applause]
[42:30] or
[42:32] a through the fall things that occur in
[42:37] nature that confuse the issue and then
[42:39] with all the politics and all the voices
[42:41] in the world today do you not see why
[42:43] these things become such a huge issue
[42:46] you not see why the devil's trying to
[42:47] cause confusion at the very least to
[42:48] cause our young people maybe even our
[42:50] adults to cause them to consider well
[42:52] maybe this is okay maybe this is a
[42:54] reality and what is it it's deceptive
[42:56] form amen trying to shape the way we
[42:58] view things and the way we think about
[43:00] things and you got to come back to begin
[43:01] I'm not trying to enter into the
[43:03] political debate about the way things
[43:04] are now but the way the things were
[43:08] then there was male and female and there
[43:11] was a nature associated with both it was
[43:13] a proper image of both that God saw in
[43:16] the
[43:16] beginning and it air it would be air for
[43:20] the male or the female to Signal as
[43:23] another
[43:24] gender because it would open the flood
[43:27] of evils it would open the door to more
[43:30] transgression or H uh mixed signals and
[43:32] therefore God hates it it disgusts God
[43:36] for a woman to appear as a man
[43:37] displeases God for a man to appear as a
[43:39] woman it's the same first Thessalonians
[43:43] 5:22 abstain from all appearance of
[43:49] evil that deceptive
[43:54] form that appearance that mislead
[43:59] you it's a trick today in media and
[44:02] entertainment it's that deceptive note
[44:05] it's the
[44:06] hook it's that inter pattern interrupt
[44:09] that we get the most caught by so what
[44:13] it's what draws to this base nature this
[44:15] Fallen Instinct because you got to
[44:16] remember now that we've been defiled now
[44:18] that we've come forth as sinful
[44:20] creatures we're not in our Pure and
[44:21] original form and so God has given a law
[44:23] to govern and to help and to lead the
[44:26] children of Israel through all these
[44:27] pitfalls and these depravities and these
[44:28] desires and when we come into the New
[44:30] Testament there's Grace there's a
[44:32] there's a an affirmation of things that
[44:34] God hates that survives into the New
[44:36] Testament but now we're given the Holy
[44:37] Ghost that's to give us discernment of
[44:39] certain things and to walk a righteous
[44:41] path but there's still this based
[44:42] instinct to where we like things
[44:44] sometimes that are discongruent and it's
[44:46] actually the reason why we like
[44:48] it things that are all the same you know
[44:51] what we call it
[44:52] Bland right we don't want to we don't
[44:54] want to just in uh we want different
[44:55] flavors and textures and notes and when
[44:57] you make a salad we don't just put it in
[44:59] a blender right unless we broke our jaw
[45:02] or I mean we want things in in a
[45:04] smoothie it's not just getting
[45:06] something go ahead and try this just
[45:10] take your
[45:12] uh
[45:15] uh I I just collagen yeah I'm just
[45:17] trying to think of all these things that
[45:19] we use anymore that if we don't take our
[45:20] CG and we're going to die and your bee
[45:22] Po and whatever it is all these things
[45:23] and just take these tasteless
[45:25] supplements and you take instead of
[45:27] getting rid of all these Amazon boxes
[45:29] cut them up put them in your blender
[45:31] with some collagen Right add a little
[45:33] bit of water grass-fed water and and
[45:37] drink
[45:39] it and tell yourself that tastes
[45:42] good and some of you that's the
[45:44] equivalent of what you eat every morning
[45:47] and you keep telling no this is good
[45:48] this is good but you know what you
[45:49] really crave just a different note of
[45:51] something I think I'm going to add cam
[45:53] to my cardboard
[45:55] box because that's what we look for it's
[45:58] things that sometimes
[45:59] Clash that excite us it's things that
[46:01] are discongruent it's the it's the hook
[46:03] in a song it's the change of cord it's
[46:05] the pattern all these things it's part
[46:07] of our human nature to be led
[46:11] astray and so this is what abstain from
[46:14] all appearance of evil it's giving shape
[46:18] deceptive form is what I'm referring to
[46:19] is giving a a shape this perceived
[46:22] Dimension which is against nature
[46:24] actually something that's contrary to
[46:26] the word something that it is not the
[46:27] Divine
[46:30] proportion now I'm going to try to do
[46:32] this in just a few moments and I think
[46:35] we got so much here we're just going to
[46:37] have to cut it
[46:38] short but on this verse a woman not
[46:42] wearing a garment that pertains to a
[46:44] man this is true
[46:48] today all that do so are Abomination to
[46:52] God God has not now that the now that
[46:55] Jesus died on the cross and the blood
[46:57] was shed and and God and the church has
[46:59] been instituted God's not
[47:03] like pants and homosexuality hey I don't
[47:07] care that's God's not that way anymore
[47:10] it was Abomination then it's Abomination
[47:13] now you can argue what that might be but
[47:16] you better accept that there is a
[47:18] conduct there is a dress that God
[47:23] hates and notice just how this is
[47:25] connected with
[47:27] this distinction between male and female
[47:29] 1 Corinthians 11: 8-5 I'm wanting I'm
[47:32] going through this obstain the
[47:33] appearance of evil for a
[47:37] nature to be covered
[47:40] up in a way to
[47:44] deceive because there's another side to
[47:46] this there's another side to this that
[47:47] we're not going to have time to get
[47:49] into but there's a way that it's
[47:52] uncovered to
[47:54] seduce or used to seduce and well so
[47:56] would touch on this in a little bit but
[47:57] notice these principles here 1
[47:59] Corinthians 11: 8-15 for the man is not
[48:01] of the woman but the woman of the man
[48:04] this difference in Natures neither was
[48:06] the Man created for the woman but the
[48:07] woman for the man and all the Patriarchs
[48:10] said don't say it for this cause ought
[48:12] the woman to have power on her head
[48:14] because of the Angels nevertheless and
[48:17] all the matriarchs said neither is The
[48:18] Man Without The Woman neither the woman
[48:20] without the man in the Lord for as the
[48:23] woman is of the man even so the man is
[48:25] also by the woman amen man but all
[48:28] things of God so God has arranged it to
[48:32] be so that now we say well the woman was
[48:34] from the man but now Every Man Has Come
[48:36] From a
[48:38] woman and there is the the
[48:41] necessity of that Union to bring forth
[48:44] this proper child the advances in DNA
[48:48] though are startling I don't see how
[48:50] much longer that we can continue to
[48:52] exist as a as a as a the world before
[48:56] God God takes us out of here and
[48:59] destroys these nations as they are
[49:02] scientific advancements are just
[49:04] staggering so it says now in verse 13
[49:06] judge in yourselves is it comely that a
[49:09] woman pray unto God
[49:11] uncovered and then he says does not even
[49:14] nature itself teach you that if a man
[49:16] have long hair it is a shame unto
[49:20] him
[49:22] right so there's something in
[49:25] nature telling us that by Nature a man
[49:27] is to be a certain way by Nature a woman
[49:29] a certain way and he's saying let me
[49:31] just ask
[49:32] yourselves is it right is it proper is
[49:34] it seemly is it something that is
[49:37] acceptable does it seem right that a
[49:39] woman would look this way and a man
[49:40] would look this other way but if a woman
[49:42] have long hair it is a glory to her for
[49:45] her hair is given her for a
[49:47] covering without getting into the
[49:49] details of this she recognize right away
[49:51] this is a New Testament scripture that
[49:54] is Paul is teaching on the way a woman
[49:56] should look way a woman should present
[49:58] and he's using this distinction between
[50:00] genders by appearance by
[50:03] feature even their
[50:06] hair there's a brother Bram does make
[50:09] references to uh uh bangs and Beetle
[50:11] haircuts and there's and there's ways
[50:13] that he's identifyed at the very least
[50:16] that it's not just anything goes for the
[50:18] man when it comes to how he Styles his
[50:20] hair lets his hair grow out and it's
[50:22] certainly not up to the churches to come
[50:24] up with this rubric to where we look
[50:26] like we're
[50:27] a u conservative male salon it's like no
[50:30] these are the approved haircuts right
[50:33] and we make sure that everyone just has
[50:34] the same highend tight no this isn't the
[50:37] military right that but there is this
[50:40] acknowledgment that there these things
[50:42] mean something to God Proverbs 11:20
[50:45] remember how the frow word was one that
[50:47] departs it's crooked it's perverse it's
[50:49] when the true nature of the thing we've
[50:51] lost view of it they that are a froward
[50:54] heart are Abomination to the Lord but
[50:56] such such as are upright in their way
[50:58] are his Delight someone of a perverted
[51:00] disposition their ways are crooked or
[51:03] deceitful is an Abomination to the
[51:11] Lord for a man to dress as a
[51:15] woman is an
[51:16] Abomination a man that dresses as a
[51:19] woman is abomination to God try to
[51:23] create a 21st Christ who just loves it
[51:26] oh look cute Bob no ain't going to work
[51:30] churches can try to be Progressive and
[51:32] there's great there's stories and books
[51:34] and all sorts of uh instances where
[51:37] conservative pastors have had their
[51:38] children come out and they completely
[51:41] shifted their Paradigm to where they now
[51:43] accept endorse and nurture and cultivate
[51:46] queerness as if it's accepted in the
[51:48] word of God and what they've done is
[51:51] they've done they've done a kickback to
[51:54] a culture that hated the person despised
[51:58] the person ruined the person maybe even
[52:00] abused and perverted the person and
[52:02] didn't take accountability for their own
[52:04] shortcomings and didn't recognize that
[52:06] the devil is the one that does this and
[52:09] that there's a hatred for the sin and
[52:11] the one that loves it needs to meet a
[52:13] Christ that loves them that can
[52:14] transform
[52:18] them and this is these things this
[52:20] forwardness this perverseness God
[52:25] now if someone was to hate me or cancel
[52:29] me or say that I'm being
[52:31] hateful I have a responsibility in my
[52:35] conviction and my as I feel my uh
[52:37] commission is to tell you what the Bible
[52:41] says
[52:43] amen thank you Lord and and if I was to
[52:46] face somebody and they were to say try
[52:49] to extract from me my position a a and
[52:51] how do you really feel about it I could
[52:53] be very H comfortable saying this is
[52:55] what the Bible
[52:57] teaches and my responsibility is how can
[53:00] I be Christ with the word that is
[53:03] Christ so that I don't turn it into a
[53:06] blood Force instrument to destroy people
[53:08] or I don't completely take away its use
[53:10] and
[53:11] utility but taking its sharpness
[53:14] out or just outright rejecting
[53:18] it in 1 Timothy chapter 2: 9 and
[53:21] 10 we're about out of time here in like
[53:25] manner also I'm kind of jumping right
[53:27] into the middle of a
[53:28] thought th that women Adorn themselves
[53:32] in modest
[53:34] apparel and it's not just the apparel
[53:36] but with shamefacedness and
[53:38] sobriety get somewhat specific not with
[53:41] broided hair or gold or pearls or costly
[53:45] array but which becometh women
[53:48] professing godliness with good
[53:51] works he gives specifics but then he
[53:54] gives us this metric this measuring
[53:56] stick that one a woman ought to Adorn
[53:58] herself with those garments and with
[54:01] that in a way that is becoming of women
[54:04] that profess
[54:08] godliness I'm only going to open up the
[54:10] door to a future service
[54:12] here but there's two different
[54:14] aspects both in Deuteronomy chap 22:5
[54:17] the man dressing as a woman the woman
[54:19] dressing as a man and even this
[54:21] scripture here there's two different
[54:22] aspects there's this principle of roles
[54:25] which is headship and hierarchy nature
[54:28] but then there's also this principle of
[54:30] modesty that Timothy's referring to here
[54:33] and that has to do with sexual
[54:35] attraction so that to dress with
[54:37] sobriety this this soundness of mind
[54:40] this self-control there's this meekness
[54:42] to it it's
[54:43] subdued the shamefacedness means that
[54:46] you're not dressing to draw attention to
[54:48] yourself that there is still some sense
[54:50] of shame or some bashfulness or blush
[54:53] knowing what these parts are and knowing
[54:56] how person is made that there is some
[54:57] sort of shame or bashfulness there is
[55:00] and this word shamefacedness means there
[55:02] is a regard and a respect for
[55:09] others the the Battle of rights to where
[55:13] people want to have the right to dress a
[55:15] certain way and not be treated a certain
[55:18] way and there's a lot of nastiness says
[55:21] well if you're going to dress like that
[55:22] I'm going to treat you like what you
[55:23] look like and people just think they can
[55:24] treat anybody how they want and it's
[55:26] just this free-for-all and it's it's
[55:28] it's pale it's a conglomeration of color
[55:30] and everything else it's it's
[55:32] disgusting and nobody's right in that
[55:35] Arena but it sure seems like it would be
[55:37] nice if somebody shows up at at a
[55:39] grocery store dressed a certain way that
[55:42] you could they could be charged with
[55:43] sexual harassment just for the way that
[55:45] they're
[55:47] dressed it's not the society we live in
[55:50] anymore but there's no
[55:52] shamefacedness that out of respect for
[55:54] you
[55:56] I'm going to dress a certain way out of
[55:58] regard for others I'm going to be a
[56:00] certain way it's one of the reasons why
[56:02] you should be very careful and watch for
[56:03] how you would dress and act in front of
[56:05] your children at home in the privacy of
[56:07] your home so that you're showing respect
[56:09] to your children so that they never
[56:11] become so desensitized to that that when
[56:13] you're at somebody else's house around
[56:15] somebody else's parents that there's not
[56:17] this sense of Shame and blush towards
[56:19] like that's not right that's improper
[56:27] to be shamefaced it means it's not
[56:28] appealing to the lust of the eyes not
[56:31] dressing to be attractive or desirable
[56:34] so there's this element that we're going
[56:35] to have to get into later that deals
[56:37] with these garments that pertain to a
[56:39] woman or a man there's a way that a
[56:41] woman could dress and even a man could
[56:43] dress that in other words it's being
[56:44] done to try to
[56:46] seduce to uh encourage certain feelings
[56:50] and even in the garments the way that
[56:52] they would be
[56:54] worn it it's too fold because let me
[56:57] just say this cuz I'm I'm not trying to
[56:59] hide anything I don't believe that a
[57:01] sister should wear a garment that
[57:02] pertains to a man our Prophet taught
[57:05] what that was slacks and pants I don't
[57:08] think that a man should wear garments
[57:09] that pertain to a woman we shouldn't be
[57:10] out there wearing I don't care how
[57:12] Scottish you think you are don't wear a
[57:13] skirt right there certain things that a
[57:15] man should not do or wear a dress and
[57:17] they're trying to just mix that up
[57:19] completely mix it up say hey I'm
[57:21] comfortable in my own skin I can dress
[57:22] however I want there is a manner of
[57:25] dress which confuses the gender genders
[57:27] and swaps them or signals that God
[57:31] hates and if your argument is that a
[57:33] garment that pertains to a man they say
[57:36] well there's man pants and there's women
[57:39] pants so I'm just going to wear women
[57:41] pants well you know where you transgress
[57:43] is in the shamefacedness because it's
[57:45] going to draw attention to your figure
[57:47] well then I'll just wear man pants then
[57:48] you're going to transgress in the
[57:50] principle of roles and that's why
[57:51] there's a phrase pants in the
[57:54] family that's why a man who's gay will
[57:56] marry a woman and she's called his
[57:59] beard right I'm not joking because she's
[58:03] a front the beard a man has a beard not
[58:05] a woman so there's this it even goes to
[58:08] facial hair and the way they wear your
[58:09] hair it's all signaling it has something
[58:11] to do with rolls hierarchy nature or it
[58:13] has something to do with this modesty
[58:15] and sexual
[58:16] attraction something to think
[58:18] about but to be modest is to be well
[58:21] arranged women Adorn themselves in
[58:23] modest apparel it's not just the apparel
[58:25] itself but there's a shamefacedness and
[58:28] sobriety well arranged seamly is what it
[58:31] means in a good appearance that's
[58:33] suitable to those that would profess
[58:34] godliness suited to be seemly suited for
[58:36] this purpose or character when one has a
[58:39] sense of modesty they are restrained by
[58:41] a sense of propriety and
[58:43] humility they're moderate even in their
[58:47] self-regard they're moderate in the way
[58:48] that they would present themselves so
[58:50] it's to not cause another person to
[58:51] stumble or to be
[58:55] offended Genesis 3:16 as I'm just
[58:57] wanting to touch on this the man and the
[59:00] woman they're different natures and to
[59:02] be adorned in this modest apparel and
[59:05] it's this it's suited for their
[59:06] character and their nature in Genesis
[59:07] 3:16 unto the woman he said thy desire
[59:11] last part thy desire shall be to thy
[59:13] husband and he shall rule over thee a
[59:18] garment that pertains to a woman
[59:20] identifies a woman as a woman a garment
[59:21] that pertains to a man identifies a man
[59:23] as a man a change in dress confuses the
[59:26] roles I know that sounds maybe
[59:28] Antiquated in vintage or whatever it is
[59:30] but sometimes vintage is more expensive
[59:31] and more valuable more desirable but a
[59:34] change in dress can change the
[59:37] role it's a sin of the pride of
[59:40] life that instead of a woman dressing in
[59:42] a way that indicates her status and and
[59:45] I don't mean socially politically or
[59:47] economically but just she is a
[59:51] woman thy desire shall be to thy husband
[59:53] he shall rule over thee doesn't create a
[59:56] domineering dominating uh dictator but
[59:58] it does establish
[1:00:00] headship as Christ is to the church and
[1:00:04] as the church would dress herself in
[1:00:05] subjection to Christ and be arrayed in
[1:00:08] his word and to dress in a way that's
[1:00:09] complimentary the church itself
[1:00:11] spiritually is array in a way that's
[1:00:13] complimentary to Christ a woman dress is
[1:00:15] in a way that's complimentary to the man
[1:00:16] and the man also complimentary to the
[1:00:20] woman and notice again how this fits
[1:00:23] this call to modesty or holiness
[1:00:26] fits with this nature of the man and the
[1:00:29] woman in their relationship to one
[1:00:31] another 1 Peter 3:
[1:00:33] 1-6 my closing scripture likewise ye
[1:00:36] wives be in subjection subjection to
[1:00:38] your own husbands that if any obey not
[1:00:40] the word they would also they also May
[1:00:43] without the word be won by the
[1:00:45] conversation of the wives the way she
[1:00:48] lives for woman has a husband that does
[1:00:52] not believe the word if she can be a
[1:00:54] woman
[1:00:56] real
[1:00:57] lady and she gets up in the morning and
[1:00:59] says you're a good for nothing drunker
[1:01:00] husband and she puts her pants on and
[1:01:02] goes out and digs ditches to make a
[1:01:04] living your husband's going to like that
[1:01:06] arrangement for quite a while isn't he
[1:01:08] keep digging ditches honey can I buy you
[1:01:09] a new shovel a new pair of pants you
[1:01:10] want to wear my boots right sounds like
[1:01:12] a good a a a good arrangement for a
[1:01:15] drunkard but a woman who's a real woman
[1:01:16] and serves her husband and lives like a
[1:01:18] lady that's the will win without her
[1:01:21] words that's what can win a man while
[1:01:24] they behold your chased conversation
[1:01:25] couple with fear who's adorning what
[1:01:28] this woman this woman who is in
[1:01:29] subjection to her husband this is
[1:01:32] describing a woman's role and her nature
[1:01:34] and her subjection to her husband whose
[1:01:36] adorning let it not be that outward
[1:01:38] adorning of platting the hair and a
[1:01:39] wearing of gold or putting on of apparel
[1:01:42] it is speaking to a married woman and
[1:01:44] who is she trying to impress we do
[1:01:46] realize that women dress for other women
[1:01:48] maybe more than they do for men anymore
[1:01:49] but let it be the hidden man of the
[1:01:51] heart in that which is not corruptible
[1:01:53] even the ornament of a meek and quiet
[1:01:55] spirit which is in the sight of God of
[1:01:57] great price the things that God loves
[1:01:58] the things that God values for after
[1:02:00] this manner in Old Time the holy women
[1:02:02] also who trusted in God notice Adorn
[1:02:05] themselves being in subject under their
[1:02:07] own
[1:02:08] husbands the requirement of Deuteronomy
[1:02:11] 22:5 is not that God hates pentalon or
[1:02:14] God hates britches no God hates a woman
[1:02:17] that would dress as a man and God hates
[1:02:19] a man that would dress as a woman
[1:02:21] because there's a distinction in nature
[1:02:23] and that the woman should be in
[1:02:24] subjection to the man and the man ought
[1:02:26] to be loving and caring and a protector
[1:02:28] a a and bold for his wife and it says
[1:02:30] here that a woman adorns herself being
[1:02:32] in subject to her husband that the way
[1:02:35] that a woman dress is for the purpose is
[1:02:37] identifying as a woman and that fashion
[1:02:40] and the world would want to change that
[1:02:42] and it's all a matter of denying your
[1:02:44] role and your place in interrupting the
[1:02:46] proper relationship and Harmony you'd
[1:02:48] have not only with God but also your
[1:02:50] husband the same goes for men even as
[1:02:52] Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord
[1:02:55] whose daughter as you are as long as you
[1:02:57] do well and are not afraid with any
[1:03:02] amazement we cannot disconnect the
[1:03:04] requirement of we cannot disconnect God
[1:03:08] hating those that transgress Deuteronomy
[1:03:10] 225 from his original design his
[1:03:14] original form the way that God
[1:03:16] originally intended things to be and it
[1:03:18] comes back to Nature being
[1:03:23] complimentary maybe I say this in a
[1:03:25] joking way
[1:03:27] but nobody wants to wake up in the
[1:03:29] morning and get ready for work and say
[1:03:30] honey have you seen my work boots and
[1:03:31] she says oh I'm wearing
[1:03:35] them I've got to I I I've got to do and
[1:03:38] now there may be things that we share
[1:03:39] but we don't share our Old Spice body
[1:03:41] wash right there's things that are for a
[1:03:43] man there's things that are for a
[1:03:45] woman and that's the way that God wants
[1:03:54] it some friends of ours got married here
[1:03:56] recently and we're out of town at the
[1:03:58] wedding and found a really neat card to
[1:04:02] give the the friends of ours who were
[1:04:04] getting married and Elizabeth was just
[1:04:07] getting ready to write in it and all of
[1:04:08] a sudden I don't know if it's one of the
[1:04:09] kids notic and said Mom that says Mr and
[1:04:12] Mister like man that was a really cool
[1:04:16] card could we just write s on that that
[1:04:18] you know the other one it's like you
[1:04:19] don't even you wouldn't even think about
[1:04:20] it anymore right that's in
[1:04:24] congruent I mean if somebody wanted you
[1:04:26] to bake a cake and it would say Mis and
[1:04:27] M Mister you'd like typo right they
[1:04:30] forgot to put the
[1:04:32] misss they forgot the S but that's where
[1:04:35] we live anymore things are so confused
[1:04:38] and listen if we could be debating about
[1:04:41] how many genders there are and whether
[1:04:44] or not one has a right to do this and
[1:04:46] whether not one has a right to that and
[1:04:47] CH change gender and be able to have
[1:04:49] children all those different things
[1:04:50] seems like a really small thing like
[1:04:52] you're arguing about pants you're really
[1:04:55] quibbling about whether or not a woman
[1:04:56] cuts her hair it's like we got bigger
[1:04:57] fish to fry over here we're trying to
[1:04:59] figure out just how many genders there
[1:05:01] are and letting everybody be who they
[1:05:02] want to be and there's a way that the
[1:05:04] whole thing has been done as kind of a
[1:05:07] distraction from God's heart and the
[1:05:09] things we value remember life is the
[1:05:11] process of determining value in order to
[1:05:14] simplify your lives we want to know what
[1:05:16] God values we want to know what God
[1:05:18] loves we want to know his attitude
[1:05:19] towards things so I can simplify my life
[1:05:21] to
[1:05:23] that Brothers you can come to your
[1:05:25] instrument
[1:05:26] let me just I'm going to skip to the
[1:05:27] last slide brother John is the the
[1:05:29] statement from the church age book I
[1:05:31] think it's important for me to express
[1:05:32] this hundreds of quotes that I could
[1:05:35] read and if I could say this that the
[1:05:40] law is full of
[1:05:43] requirements as we already read that you
[1:05:46] you have things you can't mix your walls
[1:05:49] in your in your
[1:05:51] Linens but God never said that was an
[1:05:53] Abomination to him
[1:05:55] if there's a scripture that gets close I
[1:05:57] haven't found it and I may have to adopt
[1:06:00] another Paradigm I guess if I found that
[1:06:02] the word was very clear on something but
[1:06:05] I'm just trying to call to mind that
[1:06:06] there's things that were prescribed in
[1:06:09] the Old
[1:06:10] Testament that once we come into the New
[1:06:12] Testament circumcision is no longer
[1:06:15] bound by requirement the abstaining from
[1:06:18] meats and the dietary laws that govern
[1:06:20] the Jews are explicitly said look these
[1:06:23] things don't carry over into this new
[1:06:26] Covenant because there it wasn't there
[1:06:29] was things that God said were foul or
[1:06:31] detestable or abominable because it was
[1:06:34] the unclean nature of the thing but now
[1:06:37] under the New Testament there is things
[1:06:39] that you could that you would bless and
[1:06:41] you could receive and and you wouldn't
[1:06:43] the only reason why you wouldn't is
[1:06:44] because it would stumble somebody
[1:06:47] else it's not according to God's
[1:06:49] original nature but then they come into
[1:06:52] the New Testament we find that Paul is
[1:06:54] specifically pulling things out of the
[1:06:56] law in reaffirming them that this is not
[1:06:58] the law this is the law of God this is
[1:07:00] the nature of God this is the law of
[1:07:03] life and the spirit this is this is what
[1:07:05] governs us as
[1:07:07] Christians and they come into the New
[1:07:09] Testament and that's why we can stand
[1:07:10] very solidly in the New Testament about
[1:07:12] God's attitude towards sexual perversion
[1:07:14] God's attitude towards certain ways that
[1:07:16] men and women would present themselves
[1:07:18] and and God's attitude towards certain
[1:07:19] things did not change because of the
[1:07:21] Cross and I believe in the same way that
[1:07:24] Paul preached a gospel at the
[1:07:26] inauguration of the Christian church as
[1:07:27] the gospel turned to the Jews from the
[1:07:29] Jews to the Gentiles that Paul was
[1:07:31] affirming things in God's word for for
[1:07:34] the church that brother brandham comes
[1:07:35] in our day in this 20th century as we
[1:07:38] lead into the 21st century and tells us
[1:07:40] the things that pertain to God's mind in
[1:07:43] his heart
[1:07:44] am there was a time when there would it
[1:07:47] wouldn't even necessarily be there was
[1:07:49] things that we did not have to
[1:07:51] consider could you imagine let's just go
[1:07:53] back to 1642 and say
[1:07:58] Frederick is it sin to drive an electric
[1:08:02] vehicle and he
[1:08:07] say it just what's an electric
[1:08:10] vehicle tell
[1:08:12] me and he well there is there is a
[1:08:15] there's a life we're living today that
[1:08:17] if a somebody in the world there
[1:08:19] somebody this real genuine born again
[1:08:22] Christian from other centuries would be
[1:08:23] like you guys are mad
[1:08:25] [Music]
[1:08:28] we can say well if it wasn't in the
[1:08:29] original then we don't want to do it now
[1:08:30] and so we we got to walk everywhere we
[1:08:33] go and you can't wear hookas because
[1:08:35] those didn't exist you got to find a
[1:08:38] genuine leather
[1:08:40] sandals right and well that's not the
[1:08:42] picture that's not the
[1:08:45] painting So then how does the picture
[1:08:47] get painted in a way that pleases God
[1:08:49] what are those things that are
[1:08:52] Abomination what are those things that
[1:08:54] are foul and loathsome to
[1:08:56] God it's not eating cornfed beef right
[1:09:00] that might be a wise dietary decision on
[1:09:02] your part when it comes to genetic
[1:09:04] makeup and the way what your gut agrees
[1:09:06] with but God's not going to judge you if
[1:09:08] you're eating cornfed
[1:09:11] beef I'm going to get a quote tomorrow
[1:09:13] where brother brandham said something
[1:09:15] about cornfed
[1:09:16] [Music]
[1:09:22] beef so I I I this is what a point I was
[1:09:24] trying to make and I I'm sorry I I've
[1:09:26] just wandered into a maybe a rabbit
[1:09:29] Trail brother Brown was very precise
[1:09:31] about women wearing pants cutting hair
[1:09:33] men dressing a certain way their hair
[1:09:36] even one of the things that's always
[1:09:38] been some somewhat peculiar to me is men
[1:09:39] wearing
[1:09:40] shorts and and the history of it and the
[1:09:43] requirement that men shouldn't do it and
[1:09:45] you realize it's for a
[1:09:48] reason what is it that what is it that
[1:09:50] he was identifying at the time that
[1:09:52] might we might be able to bring back to
[1:09:54] some principle in scripture and the
[1:09:55] natur of God not to turn shorts into
[1:09:58] Abomination but the man wearing them
[1:10:02] right I'm just saying think about that
[1:10:05] what is it that comes back to in the
[1:10:07] word of God so brother bam says as he's
[1:10:09] writing this take a look around examine
[1:10:11] the people as they walk by and the
[1:10:12] multitudes you see can you pick out
[1:10:15] those that have the appearance of
[1:10:17] Christians watch how they dress watch
[1:10:20] how they act hear what they say see
[1:10:23] where they go surely the there ought to
[1:10:25] be some real evidence of the new birth
[1:10:27] amongst all those we see go by but few
[1:10:31] there be yet today the fundamental
[1:10:33] churches are telling us they have
[1:10:35] millions saved and even spirit filled
[1:10:37] spirit filled spirit
[1:10:41] filled can you call women spirit filled
[1:10:44] who go around with frizzy bobbed
[1:10:47] hair Eliza was having problem with
[1:10:49] frizzy hair this morning I was like oh
[1:10:51] she's going to get it when I get to that
[1:10:52] it's not bed by God grace but she was
[1:10:55] like Dad my hair is Frizzy what do I do
[1:10:57] it's like well just use my conditioner
[1:11:00] honey frizzy bobbed hair shorts and
[1:11:04] slacks halters and briefs all painted up
[1:11:07] like
[1:11:08] Jezebel that's a question can you call
[1:11:12] them spirit filled and this to me is the
[1:11:15] kicker CU he's not answering that maybe
[1:11:17] it's rhetorical if these are adorned in
[1:11:19] monest app Peril has become with
[1:11:20] Christian women I would hate to think
[1:11:22] what it would be like if I had to
[1:11:23] witness a display of in modesty right
[1:11:28] woo yes here we are 21st
[1:11:32] century that's this this is why we are
[1:11:35] where we are today is what moved the
[1:11:37] needle when men and women could act and
[1:11:40] dress like they did in the world people
[1:11:41] in churches thought we could move even
[1:11:44] closer and still be different so we
[1:11:47] don't move the needle and say Well
[1:11:49] they're just wearing uh bikinis in the
[1:11:51] world and they're just wearing this and
[1:11:53] showing this and this and they're
[1:11:55] dressing this way and they're saying
[1:11:56] this and doing this then as long as
[1:11:58] we're in this
[1:11:59] space and a lot of the conservative
[1:12:02] Evangelical religious women that are
[1:12:04] praying for Trump a and so happy with
[1:12:07] with the the way America's going and
[1:12:09] we're going to be a Christian Nation
[1:12:11] they look they they look the part of
[1:12:14] what the Bible says was
[1:12:17] wrong it it violates scriptural
[1:12:20] principles of
[1:12:22] modesty and the roles of a man and a
[1:12:24] woman in the difference of
[1:12:26] nature but yet they they feel they're
[1:12:29] better off because they identify as a
[1:12:31] woman in their blue jeans and their
[1:12:33] Pearl buttons Pearl snapped western
[1:12:35] shirt and a ball cap on and cowboy boots
[1:12:39] and they're real Trad wife they're a
[1:12:41] real
[1:12:42] woman because they're comparing it to to
[1:12:45] the woman who became a man who has a
[1:12:47] beard who's expecting a baby with the
[1:12:49] woman that's a man and and whatever it
[1:12:51] is and they feel like they're more women
[1:12:53] they are not in the image that God wants
[1:12:55] a woman to be
[1:12:57] in don't let the devil use a deceptive
[1:13:00] form to make us feel that as long as
[1:13:02] we're wearing this and wearing that and
[1:13:03] not as like the world is that we're
[1:13:05] somehow Spirit appropriately
[1:13:09] representing
[1:13:11] [Music]
[1:13:15] godliness this is the Bible
[1:13:17] truth this is the message truth this is
[1:13:20] what we ought to be teaching our
[1:13:21] children
[1:13:26] [Music]
[1:13:30] God bless you let's
[1:13:33] stand and if you could just pray with
[1:13:37] me let's bow our heads in prayer
[1:13:39] gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're just
[1:13:40] going to close the service
[1:13:43] now and just transition from here we go
[1:13:46] into a youth meeting Lord and many that
[1:13:49] are here are going
[1:13:53] to go to lunch and fellowship maybe even
[1:13:56] talk about these
[1:13:58] things and Lord I I just pray that I
[1:14:02] have no knowledge that anyone here would
[1:14:04] even be confused
[1:14:06] or uh resistant or reluctant to not
[1:14:10] believe this principle of Deuteronomy
[1:14:12] chapter
[1:14:14] 22:5 Lord we see here in this church
[1:14:16] that men dress as men and women dressed
[1:14:19] as
[1:14:20] ladies and
[1:14:24] that there is this image at the very
[1:14:26] least that of this modesty and Holiness
[1:14:29] to wear to dress in uh appropriate
[1:14:35] attire and Lord to the extent that
[1:14:37] there'd be anyone here who wrestles with
[1:14:39] this or maybe recently saved or whatever
[1:14:42] the circumstance may be they find
[1:14:45] that
[1:14:47] this blurring of Distinction in dress
[1:14:50] and maybe they dressed in a way that was
[1:14:54] uh forward and
[1:14:56] perverse in a garment that pertained as
[1:14:59] we would say in the message that pants
[1:15:00] or slacks or shorts or whatever it might
[1:15:02] be
[1:15:03] and and it's reminiscent or triggers
[1:15:06] this sense of legalism and bondage and
[1:15:09] hatred Lord I trust that they could take
[1:15:11] this in a spirit that it's
[1:15:13] intended that we do not preach a clo
[1:15:15] Clos line gospel and we do not take the
[1:15:17] responsibility for making sure that
[1:15:19] everyone dresses a certain way but I do
[1:15:21] believe that the word has to be preached
[1:15:23] in the way that it was given so that the
[1:15:25] person can examine themselves and Paul
[1:15:28] even said just judge yourselves is this
[1:15:30] seemly is this appropriate is there any
[1:15:32] impropriety in this does not nature
[1:15:35] itself teach us that men and women are
[1:15:39] different and Lord does it not follow
[1:15:41] that according to the word of God
[1:15:42] because their Natures are different that
[1:15:44] their dress ought
[1:15:47] to demonstrate the
[1:15:51] same Lord yes it is balancing as we
[1:15:54] didn't have time to get into the the
[1:15:57] principle of modesty and sexual
[1:16:00] attraction Lord may we recognize that
[1:16:03] there's a way that we dress as men and
[1:16:04] women that shows
[1:16:06] respect to the other
[1:16:10] gender that shows respect in regard to
[1:16:12] other
[1:16:15] people Lord it would
[1:16:18] be oh God I just feel like there's just
[1:16:21] a a tsunami of emotions and feelings and
[1:16:24] thoughts that I'm struck with in light
[1:16:26] of the debates and challenges that we
[1:16:27] face today in school
[1:16:30] and and the social economic climate and
[1:16:33] all that Lord that if we could just if
[1:16:34] we could have somehow just stayed with
[1:16:36] the word of
[1:16:38] God we wouldn't have these issues today
[1:16:41] so I pray that you cause us to be those
[1:16:43] throwback
[1:16:45] Christians the real vintage
[1:16:48] believer to catch your heart to know
[1:16:51] your mind and to see your way that we
[1:16:53] can not transgress in these
[1:16:57] Abominations not so that we could be
[1:16:59] sanctimonious and somehow signal to
[1:17:03] others that we have
[1:17:05] virtue but that we could be differential
[1:17:08] and respectful to others but then also
[1:17:11] be a Christ that others see and would
[1:17:12] know there is a Highway a holy
[1:17:17] way bless our people today may you be
[1:17:20] the Difference Maker in this sermon I
[1:17:23] pray in the name of Lord Jesus Christ
[1:17:25] amen
