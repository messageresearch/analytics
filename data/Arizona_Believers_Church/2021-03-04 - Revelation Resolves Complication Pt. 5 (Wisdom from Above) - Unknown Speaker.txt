TRANSCRIPT
========================================
hebrews chapter 4 verses 9 to 16 there remaineth therefore a rest to the people of god oh my in that wonderful just maybe just stop there and and just ponder how beautiful that is there remaineth therefore a rest to the people of god for he that is entered into his rest he also hath ceased from his own works as god did from his let us labor therefore to enter into that rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief and the example of unbelief would even be how their hearts were hardened uh the children of israel's hearts were hardened for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword we want to identify this later if we if lord willing will get to this place in the sermon tonight how in talking about rest this is where this scripture is placed and we're all very familiar with hebrews 14 12. how excuse me 4 12 or the word of god is quick and powerful it's a discerner but notice the context is rest and it says for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and as a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and opened under the eyes of him with whom we have to do sin then that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens jesus the son of god let us hold fast our profession if we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feelings of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in the time of need that's just encouraging scripture reading we desire the lord would make it alive to us more tonight by revelation you can take your seats if you'll give me the liberty to do it i'm just going to jump into this without really any background or pointing out what's uh what's foundation and what we've gone over in the past i just want to jump into this but i will qualify by saying if you recognize some there's some familiar things if you agree with it that's your cue to a man so i'm not gonna maybe not gonna say this is what we said last time this week i just want to jump right into it because i want to get to a particular point tonight in james chapter 1 verse 5 the bible says speaking about wisdom and let me just say we're speaking on revelation resolves complication and wisdom from above so i do want to remind you we're on this subject of revelation resolving complication and a wisdom that god wants to give us from above so james says if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of god that giveth to all men liberally and abradeth not and it shall be given him this is a promise you can take to the bank god is saying james is saying if you lack wisdom then ask god for wisdom and he will give you even more than what you're asking and he won't chide you for it he won't upgrade you he won't rebuke you he won't say you full that's exactly what you need it's about time you figured it out he loves to grant wisdom and as we saw when god came to solomon in a dream and said you can have whatever you want solomon asked for and god said i've given it to you it's something that really pleased the lord and in the time that we're living in now we need to call upon god for revelation more than anything else and so wisdom i'm not separating wisdom as being something different from revelation revelation is divine communication it's knowledge it's wisdom it's understanding being communicated by god and though we could take each one of those words and maybe use them differently and apply them in different ways i want to kind of keep them all together that wisdom knows how to use the knowledge of god and that understanding gives us the ability to be wise in certain affairs and to be prudent and kind of looking at them as a whole that revelation imparts knowledge divine knowledge it imparts understanding it gives us it gives us wisdom and when james says if any of you lack wisdom then ask god for wisdom he's speaking of the word that this is formed from is from forming the best plans and using the best means for their execution that's what it means to be wise you can form the best plans and then also know and use the best means to execute those plans a lot of people can be idea guys you could come up with great ideas but lack the ability to execute many times successful startups are you know they're successful because the guy who comes up with the idea knows how to hand it off to the right person to execute and there's a lot of great ideas that that die in that infancy stage because the idea guy is not willing to let go and doesn't have the wisdom to see something through execution and so wisdom is the finding the best plan but then also the best means to fulfill or execute that plan and when we speak of wisdom from above this is the supreme intelligence from god and even in the bible when you would if you were to look up the definition of wisdom as it relates to god this is supreme intelligence and when we talk about supreme intelligence it's important that we're not talking about being super religious or super spiritual but i want you to think of it in terms of being practical knowledge we may think right now man if i had the mind of god to know everything then i'll know uh i'll know how to day trade or i'll know how to get in and out of bitcoin so that i don't suffer the ups and downs of cryptocurrency and you might think in your mind that's how you would want to utilize this supreme intelligence but as much as that might seem practical to you it would be even more practical than that and it wouldn't be some kind of supreme intelligence to know where we can line up to get the best deals and those things but something that would make sense in everyday life and not not like a superpower let's not think about divine intelligence being a superpower that uh superman would have or uh i almost said batman but i don't know if he even has any superpowers he just has a lot of toys and so this is something that is uh we can be very practical knowledge and it's knowledge the word wisdom as it relates to just the human knowledge that james is talking about says if you lack wisdom it's a it would be a skill it would be knowledge of both human things and even divine things so it's a to have wisdom it's knowledge of human things things that they relate to the human life but then also things that relate to the divine that you acquire through being very perceptive acuteness but also by experience this is what james has said if you lack something you can ask god to have an understanding of human things and divine things he says if any of you lack wisdom ask god this is what wisdom relates to it's the skill in managing affairs it speaks of being prudent or having discretion it's the knowledge of in practice of truth so when james says ask for wisdom it speaks of divine intelligence intelligence of human things even intelligence of things related to god things that would normally be acquired through experience or through yourself being perceptively saying you can actually ask god for this and he'll give it to you and solomon as we referenced a moment ago he asked god for an understanding heart that's the phrase that he uses he says i god give me an understanding heart too and this is the phrase to discern between good and bad so we we often reference uh solomon in terms of wisdom that what he asked for was wisdom and what he received his wisdom the scriptures identify it that way we as bible believers identified that what he asked for was wisdom and that's what he received and so this is godly wisdom if we want to ask god for wisdom or receive wisdom from above it's understanding to discern what is right to ask god for wisdom is to discern what is best and that's exactly what solomon asked for i i want to have an understanding heart to discern what is the best thing to do what is the proper thing to do to know he says he says to discern judgment it means to discern what's the right thing the righteous thing the thing that would be pleasing to the lord and so god gave him what i think the phrase i may have used last time was practical discernment this is something that can be useful not something that you can use at a party and say i can guess what number you're thinking about right now or tell somebody you know what they had eaten for breakfast that day there's just a way that we could think about discernment where it's just all about reading thoughts but if it's anything it's having the mind of god made known to you god was the one that had the knowledge of what a person's sickness was god was the one that knew what the doctor was telling somebody so when brother branham stood before a patient in a prayer line and he could tell them what was happening in their life it wasn't because he read a prayer card or was reading their thoughts it's because the thoughts of god was the knowledge of god of past present and future was being imparted to the prophet and so that we can accept that that dynamic is available to a man who's redeemed by the blood of jesus christ because it was demonstrated to us in the ministry of brother branham and that's what god can give us he can give us practical discernment and what solomon demonstrated is in his wisdom as we read in in kings is that he was not a child anymore because he says i'm a child and i know not how to go out or come in this is what the preface of solomon asking for wisdom is he acknowledged his own weaknesses when he says i'm i'm but a child i'm a child i know not how to go out or come in he's not talking about his age uh because he's believed to have been you know a full adult by the time that he asked this but he's talking about his knowledge and his understanding say my perception of things isn't fully developed my discernment of things isn't isn't is it mature it's not perfect i don't have enough experience in managing the affairs of a of a nation and a country and a people this great so this is because i'm a child and i don't know how to go out or come in give me wisdom and that phrase to go out or come in i believe joshua uses it about himself moses uses it about to this going out and coming in because it's an allusion to leadership it's actually an illusion to a shepherd who would go in and come out before the sheep and so he says i don't know how to go out or come in he's referring to leadership and headship and guidance and referring to how a shepherd ought to be with the with the congregation with the group of people with the nation he says i'm just gonna be honest god i may be the king and my name may be on the marquee but i really don't have the wisdom and the heart that a king should have for people so wonderful as this i don't know how to go out or come in and what a beautiful place to be before god were you willing to be humble and abase yourself and say lord i need help and solomon and having that kind of humility he's saying i don't know how to lead properly i don't know how to fulfill my duties and it's a phrase then that's used in the old testament to talk about one's fulfillment of the duty in the role that they're called to so he's addressing these particular things about himself i don't want to be a child anymore i want to have a understanding heart to discern and so the scriptures if you want to look at it scripturally scripturally the wisdom that solomon asked for was the ability to judge right or the ability to discern correctly to look at a situation and to understand it to look at a situation and be sensitive to all the things that will relate to it to where it's not just a knee-jerk reaction it's not just being legalistic about something but he could take a look at it and say all right this is the situation now on the surface this is what it might be um could you imagine if you if you were faced with two harlots arguing over a baby and i'm not i don't want to be rude to all of us but really with a lot of the uh religious spirits we have and we're all being included this if you don't agree you don't have to amen if you think it's true of me you can say man i'm fine with that but in our legalism and the way we judge things and how harsh we could be if two harlots came and stood before us and said an argument over baby you know what we'd probably say well it's your lifestyle you asked for it you probably know who the dad is why are you worried about who the mom is deal with it get over it figure this out you're a couple harlots this is what you asked for this is what you should did you expect to have anything different and we'd be so abrasive and so crude and so rude perhaps where solomon looks at it and doesn't judge him because of their lifestyle he doesn't judge him because of the mistakes that they made doesn't judge him because well these are two known harlots we know who they are they probably got what they asked for and joking around you know they probably don't know the daddy is little mom right he just said you know what i want to have wisdom god give me an understanding heart and his discernment was first expressed in its purity it was inoffensive though it was bring me a sword could be very grating but he used it in such a way to bring out the truth and so what he had and what he had received was the ability to discern correctly and it was more than just knowing the right thing to do but it was the way in which he administered the correctness the way that he addressed a particular situation to bring out the truth and achieve an equitable fair or righteous result and we're not lifting this up in the way that if well if i ever become a judge or if i ever become a king but you right now as kings and priests you right now as sons and daughters of god with whatever dominion you have i could say for rowan whatever you face as a young man you can ask god for wisdom to judge correctly wherever you are in your life you can ask god for the kind of wisdom that solomon was endued with and and so we're using this phrase discernment or to discern it means to distinguish or perceive differences so when you look at something it may present itself as one thing but you can recognize it's actually different than what it's presented itself itself as that if you're looking for something that's you're wanting to know if something's wrong but yet it's crying out to you i'm an angel of light this is the right thing this is the best thing discernment is able to realize no as close as it may look to right it's not right that's what discernment is it's sharp insight it's the perception of something very obscure have you ever and i think i've done a really good job the last few services of not mentioning food but i'm gonna whatever streak that was we're breaking it tonight have you ever read a food review from like a real food critic and you're like i want to write a review of this restaurant so you go on yelp you're like the food was really good you know and then you're like i need to i love the presentation it just doesn't come off but you read about somebody who knows to write about food you're like how do they think about food that way because they have an even more discerning palate you just taste good to you but they can actually tell you what's in it and how it tastes like this and how it tastes like that and p that just shows they have a different kind of perception and can recognize certain things a certain way say well then you shouldn't do that and you shouldn't do this and it all speaks to someone having discerning taste people can be like that when it comes to the way they dress they just have a different a way of taste and dress a different kind of discernment to know perception to know these colors don't go together you're not supposed to do this you're not supposed to do that and we attribute these kind of skills or gifts or talent sets or whatever ability we talk about even it being discerning so when it comes to us as being sons and daughters of god to have discernment it's the perception of something that may not be obvious to everyone else and so if god gives you discernment on something you have to realize i'm standing on something that god has given me a discernment that god has given me even if nobody else recognizes it really god has given me this kind of discernment to realize no this is this is really what's happening and it's something that you can perceive that's maybe very obscure to everyone else let me say this too that the discernment that god will give you will always line up with the word that he's given in philippians chapter 1 verses 9 to 10 and this speaks to something that's developing in our christian lives and this i pray that your love may abound yet more and more so this is an abounding love a growing love and this is how it's expressed in knowledge and in all judgment so when our love for the word increases we don't get more wishy-washy and have less of a backbone and become more less discerning and have less of a distinction but actually our knowledge and discernment becomes sharper and more clear now there's kind of the the two the two ditches to this truth is a lot of times when people claim to be coming more in love with christ they get more welcoming and more accepting and they're not worried about this and not worried about that and those that profess to really have the love of god they're really just kind of ooey gooey and mushy and they're really really sweet but there's really no backbone there's really no truth that kind of under guards their experience where they're really standing on a principle and so love is not what you think it is love is not an emotion and contrary to popular songs love is not a verb love is something that is discerning and love is associated with the word of god it's associated with the person and so on the other end you can't take love and say well love is corrective and then get real rigid and hard and abusive and legalistic with it in both those either way you're in a ditch because where love really excels is as it grows and abounds you have a more comprehensive knowledge and a more full judgment or discernment of things so he says that you may approve which the word approve is translated also to discern in the scripture that you may approve or discern test or try things that are excellent the ability to perceive and recognize things that's excellent that's very good that you may be sincere and without offense till the day of christ that you may be correct that you may be righteous in your judgments righteous in your feelings and your opinions so philippians when paul writes this he talks about a growing love a love that abounds it's an experience it's a character that's increasing to maturity and a love that's maturing is something that in even the mark of it here that your love would abound yet more and more it's marked by a more comprehensive discernment how can you tell you're getting falling more in love with the word of god how can you tell that you're falling more in love with jesus christ your discernment and your perception of right is increasing the further you fall in love with god and the more a closer relationship you have with jesus christ the more present he is in your thinking the more present he is in your life aren't we don't we recognize that when we're really in tune with the spirit that we're a little bit more perceptive to other spirits not open to them but we're perceptive of them we realize wait a minute i'm not so sure and as you're walking with god and walking with the clean conscience you become a lot more sensitive not just to spirits but even to how other people feel you don't become more bullheaded and and rough you become more sensitive and understanding and god gives you wisdom how that you can handle certain circumstances this is what paul is lifting up is a growing love that's marked by a a growing discernment that gives you the ability to recognize situations to be very prudent in situations that you're facing and to make the right kind of decisions so it's a growing something that's maturing in hebrews chapter 5 verses 10 to 14. paul is wanting to preach who is this melchizedek but he says melchizedek called of god as a high priest after the order of melchizedek and he wants to preach who is this melchizedek but he says in verse 11 of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered seeing your dole of hearing i would like to preach who is this melchizedek but you're not ready for it it's a lot of things that are hard to be understood about him but you're dull of hearing and it wasn't speaking to natural ability to hear what paul was saying or the natural ability to read what he was writing but it was the ability to perceive and kind of pick up what he was laying down he says do you get what i'm saying and we've experienced it before personally we say well you're not listening and the person can repeat back to us exactly what we said and we realized they heard us but they're not listening that they can repeat what i'm saying but are they really catching what is being said they're really able to to identify what's in his heart so he's saying you're dull of hearing and then he then he unpacks it this way and it's so so profound for when for the time you ought to be teachers you ought to have grown to a place where you could be the one teaching you ought to have come to a place in your experience with your knowledge of the word of god and the spirit that's growing within your heart you should have come to the place where you could be teaching but instead of being the teacher you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of god they're needing to be taught and re-established because they're not maturing they're not growing as they ought to they're not able to go on unto the perfect one he says and we and are become such as have need of milk and not strong meat so he's using this picture then of a baby of one who ought to be advancing through the stages of more solid food and then be one who's marked by even a more mature child who can handle handle meat and chew on strong meat he says we're going all the way back to more toddler and infancy stage where your primary diet needs to be that of milk because you can't handle strong meat now again he's using what we might say is the analogy or the type of childhood or not of a toddler or an infant in this case as the word means a babe it means one that's not able to speak it's not a spoken word baby but it's a baby who's not able to speak and he says this verse 13 for everyone that useth milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe now don't be offended you're still a babe right at least you're not dead or stillborn you're a babe in christ you're a young one in christ so if there's any kind of rebuke or correction you take comfort realizing i'm only being corrected because i am a son and being a son he's correcting me and it's not re uh retribution and just chastisement for the sake of making you feel bad he's saying look you're a son or daughter of god but you're being very childlike and there's more for you to grow into there's more for you to understand and experience so he says everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe and i'll just read and go back through this so we can go more quickly but strong meat belonging to them that are full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil so just as solomon said i am but a child i don't know how to go out or come in and he asks for a discerning heart paul is now speaking about discernment and to understand discernment he wants to use this image of even a baby or an infant that has to be fed milk before it can handle strong meat and if you look at it in the spiritual sense so he says he's unskillful in the word of righteousness he's looking at it as a babe if we look in the natural to understand the point he's trying to make in the spiritual a babe lacks understanding a babe lacks wisdom it lacks a proper view of the world it's still learning it's still trying to understand things the world is its laboratories we could say and through experience and through teaching it's trying to figure everything out and a babe doesn't know good from evil this is something that it learns through time it learns what an angry face is it learns what a smile is it learns these different things as it begins to walk in this world and relate to certain circumstances and we can say even even is it not does it not know good and evil but it's actually inclined to evil and they're more inclined to think that because they want to do it and they're inclined to do it that they're justified because they feel that way so that's how a babe is characterized and i i often say this about a baby if you hand them something what's the first thing they do put it in their mouth the first thing a baby does is you hand it to them it doesn't matter what it is it's because it's their way of trying to figure out what this thing is they do two things they put it in their mouth and then they bang it they throw it what's going to happen to this what they're they're trying to learn but if we start thinking about how paul is looking at the the hebrews and saying you should be teachers you're not teachers you've become as babes then he's actually questioning their ability to know what they should put in their mouths and what they shouldn't are they able to rightly handle the things that are being divided to them so a spiritual babe just as a natural babe doesn't have this proper view and doesn't know good from evil a spiritual babe is not discerning it's unskilled in the word although it's been birthed by it it hasn't grown and been properly nurtured not yielding to the nurture in order to be able to take that word and use it properly we could say and i could say this with absolute sureness that if you've been born again by the spirit of god you have the word in you the word is at your disposal now the utility of it is going to relate directly to your faith and the increase of your faith and how is your faith going to be increased by hearing the word so as you hear the word your faith increases as you grow in knowledge and wisdom of the son of god then it makes your faith and your knowledge of the word more practical where it's not just all zeal with no wisdom so there's a principle that is identifying that although you've been birthed by the word you need your experience in the word to be enriched so that you could take wisdom and be skillful in the word of righteousness claim it no matter where you are in your experience with god you have the word of righteousness what i want to be a skillful with that word i don't want to take a hand of faith and grab the sword and just use it to cut everybody up and to cut this down and cut that down i want to be able to i want the lord to be able to take that word and make let it be effective and bring forth the fruits of righteousness in my life and in my testimony in the way that i impact others and so he says that by who by reason of use those that are foolish strong meat belongs to them that are full age so it's by by participation with the word as he says by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil by participation with the word that this understanding and judgment is vigorously used to discern that if you if you could if you can use the word once then you're going to become more proficient the next time you use it the more you use it the better you're going to get at it the more you are in practice of using the word and applying the word and looking to the word and saying lord what does your word say about this lord what does your what does the word say about that the more you use the word the better you get at it it says the strong meat is characterized by those who are full age those who are full age are the ones that are feeding on strong meat because by reason of use by the vigorous use of the word of god they've gotten to where their their discernment is sharper and that's what's being expressed the bible says in first corinthians 14 20 brethren be not children in understanding how being in malice be children be innocent be ignorant of malice be ignorant of evil things but in understanding be men that means have have a spiritual insight that is matured have a faith that begins that begins as a as a faith which is uh there's a even as we think about the statue of a perfect man faith is something that in itself is without any offense and faith itself is out without any blemish but your faith can become perfect faith how did how did then abraham's faith reach its full and supreme expression through his works so you can have faith but faith without works is dead but then faith is made perfect when the fruit of it is expressed and the real benefit and and what it means and what it can do if you don't have faith and it's not practical then we could say then what good is it so you have faith let it become practical you have the word of god let it work and in understanding be men have a matured spiritual insight have a matured faith which is practical which is useful which makes a difference so he says it as a as far as being having understanding don't be a child with respect to understanding and he uses the same language to the corinthian church elsewhere in first corinthians where he's talking about your babes and your carnal and you fuss and you fight and so he's identifying a immature way of thinking and the answer to an immature way of thinking is to have a more godly mind a more mature way of thinking that aligns with the spirit of god and aligns with the word of god so the answer then to this is he says you should be teachers but now you need to be taught again because you're unskillful in the word of righteousness you're more like a babe in christ and so what would they need in order to come to a place where they could have more discernment they need the word and so peter wrote it this way in first peter 2 2 as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that ye may grow thereby so as paul desired to the philippians that their love would abound more and more in more discernment then as we feed on the word of god feeding on the word we mature in wisdom feeding on the word we mature in understanding these are things that become sharper become clear become more readily available to us and so our insight and our judgment becomes deeper our insight in our judgment becomes more profound we can recognize differences the more you look into the face of christ the greater you are able to recognize him when you look away from him and what i mean by the more you're looking into the word you're more of the hearing your word the more you're able to recognize him as you look go through the world and hopefully the more you're softer your spirit becomes so that when you don't see christ right away you have an instinct to try to bring them out we're going to run into a lot of situations with people where we don't we're not met with christ first and we've got to have a way to bring it out of them because all too often let's just all admit it everybody here we could go ahead and you know turn off the cameras and we could all just have an open mic and we know we can talk about how we've been mistreated we've been abused we've been misunderstood and yet we know that inside of us is something good and we know a lot of times we got what we thought we deserve but really what we needed is we needed somebody who could understand us and look past our flesh and look past our lack of wisdom and look past our arrogance and look past our pride and know that deep down inside of this person is christ and i want to find a way to bring it out of them i want to provoke them unto love and under good works i don't want to harden them i don't want to abuse them i don't want to push them away i don't want to beat them up because they're not what they should be but recognize and believe that inside of this son or daughter of god is christ and i am i'm not seeing it but i believe it's there and i want to find a way to bring it out of them that's wisdom and so as newborn babes what we desire is we desire the milk of the word too often maybe we use oh that's just milk and we use it in a way to be dismissive but none of us will ever get to steak if we don't come through the milk you're never gonna be able to handle meat unless you come through the milk so we've got to have the milk we've got to feed on the word of god and then if we're properly feeding on the word then we mature in the amount of word that we can process that we can digest and the nutrients that we're deriving from the word the milk has done its job we've matured now we're taking more of the word we're deriving nutrients from it and what is it doing it's maturing our discernment and therefore it's maturing as our experience matures our discernment matures so this is something that we can claim as a believer to have mature understanding mature discernment as newborn babes desire the sincere sincere milk of the word god wants to teach us to know right and wrong god wants to teach us what is right and god is teaching us what is right god is teaching us what is proper god is teaching us the principles in his word and his thoughts towards things and and and the certain uh way that he views things and the principles that uh that form the foundation for decisions and there's ways we say that the bible says don't do this but then there's also an understanding to realize why you're not supposed to do that that there's a thing that we say well this is what the law says and this is what the word says but there's an understanding to unders to recognize what god is achieving by that jews as an example we could say in the exodus that he told the children of israel to get all the leaven out of the house well it wasn't just to get it out just to have a rule but god had established prior to that that if you eat any leaven during these seven days you'll be cut off from your inheritance be cut off out of israel so god had a rule we could say to get all the leaven and that's part of applying the token to your home get all this filth out get all the trash out get the leaven out of your house and it's not just to have a legalistic rule or ideal but it's to keep from making a mistake or transgressing in something that's important to god and that's the wisdom behind it so god wants us to teach us what is right and he wants to empower us to do what is right with an understanding not just a robot that's been programmed to do it even as parents we could say that we teach and correct our children in a way that they can have an understanding of right and wrong not just operate according to a code a set of rules if they're not taught to understand what is right and what is wrong if they're not taught to be able to recognize things that are uh that are erroneous and we're not imparting to them understanding when we teach them then they just have a list of rules and whenever they're put in a situation like well let me read here yeah that's not on here i don't know what to do you want to be giving them something to where they can make a judgment themselves and say well i've been taught this i've been taught that i've been warned about this i've been warned about that they've been encouraged enough in the positive things and discouraged enough from negative things to when they're put into a situation we've given them some resources that they can draw upon in a time when they need it and that should make a lot of sense to us because that's what god is doing god is wanting us to come to a place where moses stood in a position where god said i've taught you enough why christ speak i've taught you enough i've trained you enough you know well enough now is the time to speak and that's the kind of training that god wants to do for us as children psalms 119 has two different places that speak to this kind of hunger that we ought to have it says teach me good judgment and knowledge verse 66 psalms 1 19 66 teach me good judgment and knowledge that judgment there is translated elsewhere to taste the ability to recognize the ability to discriminate teach me good taste let me have good taste let me have good judgment teach me the ability to recognize in verse 125 i am thy servant give me understanding that i may know thy testimonies it says give me understanding it means to discern to be perceived to distinguish to be disturbed discerning to have understanding to be prudent says make me wise make me to have an understanding heart to discern what is best to discern what is proper to do the things that are the better things to do so it's saying teach me good judgment teach me knowledge give me understanding these are things that we should be asking for and praying for this discernment they're asking for it's a manifestation of the spirit of truth ponder that for a moment the spirit that you have received is a spirit that searches all things yea the deep things of god the spirit you have received is the spirit of truth it is associated with understanding and wisdom and knowledge he shall teach you all things he shall show you things that are to come the spirit that you have received is the spirit of truth and so wisdom is a manifestation of the spirit of truth now this may seem to be a little bit uh well let's just say we're turning a corner here in marriage and divorce brother bradham says but now that the seals are opened the spirit of truth directs us to the word now as he's preaching marriage and divorce 100 applicable 100 within context brother branham is saying now that the seals are open the spirit of truth is directing us to the word in this instance so he says that explains why all the mistakes have been made down through the ages because the seals were not opened this was not revealed now as it relates to marriage and divorce and this great great question that was on the people's minds of can i do this and can i do that what's the right thing to do what's the wrong thing to do and all these people had this very very heavy question brother branham is identifying that now that the seals are open the spirit of truth can point you to the word and give you the correct judgment on the matter and he's saying the reason why mistakes have been made is not because men were not sincere because people didn't love truth but rather this had not been made known yet now if that's true with respect to marriage and divorce it's true elsewhere that the spirit of truth has been opened up to us and now the spirit of truth which we have received can direct us to the word and where we would have made mistakes before and where mistakes have been made in the past and people were just doing the best they could with what they have now we can say lord let the spirit of truth come and direct me to the word so that re mistakes are not repeated something that's been turning over and over in my heart over the last week is that we god has raised up people who are absolutely cycle breakers that that's what's going to characterize this generation that goes in a body change it's breaking the cycle of revival and death it's repeated itself and there's cycles and families and there's habits that are perpetuated and there's ways that things have been done for generation to generation but when the spirit of truth directs us to the word we can look back and say this is the reason why mistakes have been made the seals were not opened yet this was not revealed so i challenge you to take this very truth about the word being made available to us and let it be very practical john 8 32 says and ye shall know that means perceive and understand the truth you shall perceive and understand you shall have an intimate knowledge of the divine you shall perceive and know the truth and the truth shall read it make you free it shall make you free so this is this is a scripture that's very familiar to us but when we can know and perceive truth there's a liberty in it when we can know and perceive what is right we can know and perceive what is not false we know and perceive and understand the truth then knowing the truth that truth is able to set us at liberty and release us from bondage and so just as we read from marriage and divorce make this very real the revelation of the word can give you practical wisdom and can give you practical discernment that if i can know the truth about a matter a matter does not have to hold me in bondage if i can know the truth about a decision or the right thing to do then i'm not brought under the power of the anxiety of it revelation of the word can give you practical understanding to make your way through your daily life we read it last time i believe it was on sunday we need discernment we need the discerning by the word that's right take the word god's words always right we can't discern by what people think what intellectuals tell us what psychiatrist tells us and the intellectuals it's what you think or what your intellectuals are telling us we've got to go by what god says so when you're asking for wisdom from above when you're asking god for wisdom and he says god it says let him ask of god because he'll give you're not asking for a new opinion you're not asking for consensus you're not asking for what everyone else would think would be right and what everyone else would agree with you're asking for god's judgment on the matter god i want to know what your word says i want to know what you say i want to know what's pleasing to you so now that the seals are open the truth is being expressed to us we can take the truth of the of the opening of the word and we can make it something that's relevant every day of our lives quickening power brother said and rise into the sun quickening power gives discernment to know what's wrong with you and what to do and what you've done and what you ought to not have done and what you should have done and what you will be if that's what quickening power does that's what i want if quickening power gives discernment then i want to know what's wrong with me i want to know what to do i want to know what i have done and what i ought not to have done i want to know what i should have done and what i will be and quickening power is what can give me that kind of understanding quickening power gives us discernment and what is it brother adam says about quickening power in this very message he says quickening power has come to us to open the seven seals he says what was that the intelligence of a man know the quickening power of god so quickening power is not the intelligence of a man it's not even brother branham's opinion on it it's not the intellectual property of brother branham brother venom is the vessel that's in giving declaring to us god's mind and god's thoughts that's when you go back and you read in the old testament and you find that it says don't do this it's an abomination unto the lord the prophet the writer is not guessing god said hey if you do this that's an abomination to me and the guy's like wow okay make sure they know this this is an abomination why that's god's mind not theirs and so this is something being expressed the quickening power that's come to us at the open of the seals the quickening power to came that came to open is not the intelligence of a man it's the headship of christ therefore if we read christ is the mystery of god revealed then we who believe that the new birth is the person revelation of jesus christ personally to us then the new birth gives us access not to a man's intelligence but to the intelligence of the son of man and i want to live by that i'm admonished in that sermon to let him have preeminence because it's christ who opened those seals he says he is those seals for the whole word of god is christ and christ is the seals that were opened what is the opening of the seals revealing christ the revelation of jesus christ resolves complication quickening power has come to us to open up these things to us to give us understanding not to make us mysterious not to make us different if you do that you only get missed the program you only get out of step is to do it to make you live an overcoming life i mean honestly what good would it do if we could all figure out the correct interpretation of the seals and of the thunders and the third pool and the tent vision and we had the perfect complete understanding of it but it didn't make any difference in our lives still don't know how to love our wives still don't know how to provoke not our children to anger still don't know how to do things right and and respond to situations the right way if we were just honest we'd say what good is all that done and that's why paul in a way of not suggesting that you could know all the mysteries and have not charity but say look if you don't have christ the word who is the god is love right and god is the word in the beginning was the word and the word was god and god is love so love and the word are married together and can never be separated so what good would it do for you to know all the mysteries and not have the word love in your heart if you don't have the difference maker if it's something that's not making a difference so when we i'm going through these few moments here to lift up these things about knowing the truth and the open of the seals to to take the revelations that we have been taught that have formed the foundation of the wonderful experiences we've had in the lord and the teachings that we've sat in a heard for decades and realized that everything that lifted up christ and made him more clear in this message and showed us the fulfillment of first thessalonians that showed us the fulfillment of revelations 10 that showed us the fulfillment of luke 17 30. at the end is to accumulate so that it comes right down in our hearts and it anchors in such a way to where we live the right kind of life in the presence of god right in the middle of laodicea christ stands at the door knocks and christ is standing at the door knocking to call us out of lao to see his chaos you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free john 8 36 says if the son therefore shall make you free you shall be free indeed this is the promise that he gives us that if we can receive the revelation of jesus christ it's going to begin to resolve a lot of the things in our personal lives that there's there's people we know and it could be even ourselves that really what we need at the end of the day is to be born again and just that alone changes flips things around so significantly in your life to where we're not even talking about the same things anymore because we sit down and talk about this and talk about that and talk about this and talk about that that you want to bring the p come to a birth once you come to a birth then you've got the life and the nature inside of you and then there's just a way that things work and there's a dynamic at playing it's not you just trying it's not just the preacher trying to keep you in line but there's a there's a mechanic there that works with the dynamics to take you from what you were to change you to a son or daughter of god you've been birthed into the body of jesus christ you've been baptized in this body and now you're made subject to the laws of god and now you can grow in grace and wisdom and understanding and when you've been made free you are free indeed all by that experience let's turn to hebrews chapter 4. now notice as we read this how that he's talking about rest and ceasing from our own works there remaineth therefore hebrews 4 9 we'll read to verse 16 again there remaineth therefore a rest to the people of god for he that has entered into his rest he also has ceased from his own works as god did from his let us labor therefore to enter into that rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief the image that paul is presenting to the hebrews is ceased from your own strife your own works labor to enter into his rest to a place that he wants you to rest and then the very in the very context of laboring to enter into rest he says for the word of god is quick and powerful now he's he's not kind of changing the subjects of what you should find a place to rest now let me talk about the deep things for a second somehow our rest is associated with this powerful word somehow you're laboring the interest and you being comfortable and secure in that rest and your full understanding of what that rest offers you something about this rest is made available to us and made perfect in us and it has meaning and substance to us in this discerning word we begin to read about in verse 12. if you only catch this part in this whole sermon just catch this part that something about the word the word that is expressed here in hebrews 4 12 the dynamics and the power and the ability of the word is what your rest is is made available to you by it's what makes the rest what it is for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any two edged sword remember we're to take the sword of the spirit which is the word solomon said give me a sword bring me a sword the sword represents discernment it represents something that's sharp something that's a powerful he says the word of god is sharper the knee to its sword piercing even to the divide and asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and as a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart our rest is related to a word that can discern our rest is related to a word that can take things that are fleshly and put them in the flesh things that are spiritual and put them in the spiritual things that are in the soul put them in the soul the arrest relates to word which is discerning and can rightly divide among soul body and spirit or soul spirit body body spirit soul is you'd want to work out in or in and out he's saying that the word of god is quick and powerful the word is quickening power quickening power gives us discernment quickening power has come to us the word of god which is nighty which is even in your mouth is quick and powerful sharper than any twiddle sword and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart this is what we need then if we need discernment we need the discerning word that's what we discern by he says we discern by the word so right now he's kind of come to this and it kind of forms this center of all this labor therefore to enter into your rest they say neither is there any creature that's not manifest in his sight what the sight of the word the word of god but all things are naked and open to the eyes of him with whom we have to do he hasn't left the subject of rest and he is now amplifying further what the word is the word is a person the word of god is quick and powerful there's nothing that is hid from his sight god's sight all things are naked and open before the eyes of him with whom we have to do and so saying we must enter into rest and then he brings into our mind we're thinking about this discerning word this word that can discern he says in verse 14 see and then that we have a great high priest i are you can you let's just focus now for just a few more moments that we want to find rest in this chaotic world it's it's this world just has a way of making us restless and we're just always resting no matter what seems to come up and we all that's good it satisfied that but we're kept constantly restless the way that laodicea could be described is they didn't realize just how restless they were oh i'm good i don't need anything no i'm no i'm good i i'm not no i'm i'm good i don't need anything right and the whole time they're just jonesing for more they just got to have more no i'm good i don't i don't need anything no i'm good they're restless i said we could come to a place of contentment we can find rest for our souls come unto me all you are burdened and everything come to me take my yoke take my burden and you'll find rest in your souls he's talking about coming to a place where we can be content we can be satisfied when you know the truth it sets you free you can cast down these off these weights you can cast off this baggage you can cast off all these cares about what everyone else is thinking you can cast off all these cares about what would this person say what would that person say you know what this beard represents me overcoming what everyone else thinks i don't know if that's true for brother lucas and whoever else but and maybe more appropriate for him he doesn't care how it looks but that's what that's what some things represent our life is no longer being under the weight of what everyone else is thinking i just want to know what god says oh my goodness you're going to start a church in phoenix brother aaron what is everybody going to think oh i hadn't thought about that because god just told me that's what he wanted me to do and i thought you know what that's good enough one brother asked me he said brother and i just got one question we support you one thousand percent we're right there right behind you it's wonderful we just have one question why phoenix and i said oh that's that's easy i didn't choose phoenix god did it i didn't sit down in pros and cons what should we do i found the mind of god god communicated to by divine revelation what one ought to do it and confirmed it in the way that god can you you're set at liberty then you're not worried what would this person do what will that person do what's going to happen what's going to happen to our kids we could just rest knowing just do what god says to do he knows how to work it out brother braham said he'll do the rest there's a way there's just a way things work out when you do what he wants you to do yeah go ahead go do that but there's nothing no go ahead do it try me go ahead do it okay lord i'm going to trust you well good that's that's what you should do then you shall have rest in your soul so this is what he's walking us through and then he says this about the word the word he brings this rest the word the word and now he says we have a high priest this is forming the next part of how we enter into our rest we have this rest that's made available to us it's going to come by this word this discerning word he says we have a high priest that is passed into heavens jesus the son of god let us hold fast unto our profession let's hold fast our profession sin that we have this high priest for we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities we need discernment right it's what we need we need discernment we shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free now this is what you have access to your call upon god for revelation if you're asking god for wisdom he says for we have not a high priest we cannot which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we were yet without sin this is the person you're asking for guidance from this is the person you're asking to give you wisdom and he's someone who can be touched by what you're going through he's somebody that knows and has been tempted in all points like we were there's nothing we can go to him on and he starts scratching his head hmm hadn't thought about that well i'm not sure let me pray about it this is a one who has been tempted in all points like as we were and here's the beautiful part yet without sin so he knows how to make it through on the other side without blemish he knows how to help you navigate the labyrinth of laodicea he knows how to tell you where to go and how to come out how to go in he can give you wisdom for the moment that you're living in because he can be touched by the feeling of your infirmities he can be empathetic with whatever you're going through take it to the lord you can say lord i don't know what to do lord i'm struggling lord i'm at my wits in and you can say i feel you i know what you're going through i've been through that and i came out on the other side without sin without blemish that's the one you can go to and talk to notice just how beautiful it is he says let us therefore come boldly under the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need this is what the revelation of the word gives us access to his rest and a source of wisdom he was in all points tempted like as we were he can be touched oh can he be touched by the feelings of a housewife yes in all points he's been tempted like as unto you were there's nothing new under the sun as it said so he can in all points he can give the wisdom we need we don't just go to him when we need healing we do but not just only when we need healing we're not only praying when we're sick and when we're about to eat and it seems to be the promises that seem to be more pronounced to us is ye shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover and if this person is sick anointed with oil and it seems the promises that are more pronounced to us is the fact that he is a divine healer he's also a divine resolver of doubts dissolver of doubts he's also a divine leader he's a divine comforter he's a divine guide if we could come to the place like brother brandon said i don't even want to walk without you i don't want to fish on the bank without you god let you be the one who's divinely holding my hand and leading me through this because he wants to do it if we'll just yield to him and let him he wants to be able to not just give us help when we're sick but it's everything seeing that we have this high priest let us come to him so we can find grace to help when we're needy that's what it can come down to i need grace i need grace in this situation i need to figure my way out of this i need to know what the right thing is to do the bible says in first john 4 1 this is our last scripture and i want to use just one example i haven't been able to get to first john 4 1 beloved believe not every spirit that would be the simple that the proverbs calls out gullible believes everything whatever said it's the wrong kind of simple believe not every spirit but try the spirit the word they try is prove or discern approve discern but try discern the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are gone out into the world brother graham said in one place that we ought to have discernment to know the spirit in a man whether it be of god or not that could be used in such a way to say well i've discerned his spirit he's he's not a christian but it even would be discernment to know that even though what he's doing may seem wrong you discern his spirit he's sincere in what he's trying to do the bible tells us not to believe every spirit but to try them to discern them to test them let me ask you this as we bring this to a close if we are asked to discern spirits then would god not give us the ability to do it if he asks you if he asks you to try his spirits would he not then be the one that empowers you and gives you the ability to do it and so he says i want you to discern spirits i want you to discern spirits and then we're like okay all right i guess i'll go do it like no no no let's back up he's told you to do it so then what we should say well then lord help me do it then lord give me this ability just as cain who said hey if you do well will you not be accepted he's like well no i don't want to do well he should have said well then what's well what's right when the spirit of the lord told brother branham uh you can do this to bind the greatest and the least he says but you must be more sincere or he said he said you can you can bind this spirit the greatest to the least brother brampton say thanks i appreciate it and then run off he said then what must i do there's the wisdom sometimes we think wisdom is knowing what to do the wisdom is knowing you don't know what to do and that's the best place to start and say lord then give me wisdom maybe that could be the starting point for all of us your brother aaron you've been saying this for five parts well then let me hopefully i can say it for the last time tonight let us all start by admitting that we don't have it all figured out we don't have all the answers and we need him to give him to us if he's told us to try the spirits then he must give us the ability to do so if the church in this last days which you are part of the bride of jesus christ in the end time is going to discern and withstand the antichrist spirit and in discerning and withstanding the antichrist spirit it's going to make satan powerless before her if we can do that then we can have a god-given ability to exercise wisdom and discernment in our daily lives right if you're gonna have the power to discern the two spirits within the framework of the christian church and discern and withstand the antichrist spirit and through that discernment make satan completely powerless before you if that's the greatest thing that this church is gonna climax under then does that not translate to where god could be giving you now wisdom in your daily life that we're so focused on maybe what the end result's going to be one day we're going to be able to put death under our feet well maybe how about being able to put this situation in its place and i want to start there in just victory stone after stone how's this wall going to be how is this temple going to be built stone after stone after stone revelation after revelation after word upon word upon word lord i want to don't want to be daydreaming about the finished wall i don't want to be daydreaming about a castle beyond the river i want to go ahead and take stone after stone after stone revelation after revelation and i want to build my wall i want to build my home and i want to do it step by step stone my stone because if i can do that one day then i can do this job today if one day i'm gonna be able to look death in the face and say devil you can't handle me get under my feet death you're you're you've done you've caught taken a bride remember for the last time if one day by revelation i know i'm gonna do that then right now i can look inside my home and say the spirit's not right lord what's wrong in my family what's wrong in my life what's taking place and bring spirits under control and have the discerner go through your heart and go through your life and uncover things not for your detriment and not to your shame but that you can be edified and christ can be glorified how much more you think well how practical is that brother aaron i've been asking god to give me wisdom when to say yes i feel like i say no to my kids all the time you say no so much i realize there's got to be a wisdom in this you can't just keep saying no what are you trying to achieve no you can't do this no you can't do that and i thought my kids would a man louder at that point eliza that was your chance and and it's like you're always saying no but i realize there's not there's not wisdom and just always saying no if there's no wisdom behind it what are you trying to accomplish what are you achieving by restricting forbidding what are you trying to achieve with all these rules what are you trying to accomplish with the way that you're going about this there's got to be something at the end of the day you're promoting so you can take a step back and say are all my nose promoting what's valuable or all my nose promoting uh what ought to be and for me maybe god's dealing with me to know when to say yes and have wisdom to say yes maybe for you it's wisdom when to say no maybe there's too many yeses and that just goes to show that there's ways that god is dealing with us there's things that we're working through there's things that we're facing for the answer isn't for me to come up and say everyone this week say no to this it's find the mind of god to know the right thing to do in the situation you're going through so that when you give the answer there's wisdom behind it to promote the virtuous result that it ought to bring that's what wisdom is wisdom can be a situation where you just know what you can give your kids what you can allow your kids to do so that you're not just always creating a restrictive environment and promoting the wrong kind of virtues on the other hand it could be knowing when to say no because you're not promoting the right environment and you'd recognize you know what i'm letting them do these things and it's not promoting the promoting the virtuous spirit that we should have in our homes that's wisdom in world war ii how do you like that for segway set that up real good in world war ii there was a they had brought together a secret group of scientists estheticians and mathematicians and they had done it was a civilian group of people and they'd done it with this uh it's classified as the word i was looking for and the military presented them with a set of data to find a solution a very specific problem and the question was as the as the military was experiencing in the uh with re uh in their military aircraft is in the dog fights and all the the missions that they were going on the planes that were getting shot down planes were returning and they wanted they were wrestling with this idea of how can we fortify the planes without making them too heavy to fly so they ask themselves where's the optimal place to put extra armor in order to protect the planes against bullets so the military is looking for efficiency we want to bulk up the plane but we can't bulk it up too much because then it won't fly so what we want to do is we want to protect with less armor by concentrating on the places where the armor should be are you following me anybody just the eyes that seem the brightest right now i'll just focus on it i'm just going to tell you a story brother john so i can get through this so like we got to load these planes up with armor but if we put armor all over the whole plane it won't be able to fly so let's concentrate our armor in the places where the where we need it the most so that the plane would be able to fly put it in the place of the greatest need and they thought well let's put it in the place where the planes are getting hit the most so they wanted to know how much armor belonged on those parts of the plane and they gathered all these statitions and these mathematicians together and they presented them with all the data and said our planes are being hit here and they're being hit there and this is where most of the planes are being hit and what we want to know is where should we put the armor on all these places they're being hit to be the most efficient so that we can continue in this war and see a successful result and one of the mathematicians abraham wald looked at the situation and had an answer that was completely outside the box it was as if solomon was standing there and says bring me a sword like we're talking about airplanes swords aren't going to do our airplanes any any good besides all our pilots are equipped with guns in case something happens no bring me a sword he completely thought outside the box and what he told him is the armor doesn't belong where the bullet holes were the armor the armor belongs where the bullet holes aren't because the data they were using were on the planes that returned and so as the planes returned like man there's bullet holes all over this plane and they said they had a bunch of bullet holes here so we need to load this part up but what abraham wald said is the planes that aren't returning are the planes that were shot somewhere else than where these bullet holes are and thought about it completely different and i'm using a natural example just to see how the wisdom of god can work in our lives oh it's so obvious there's a thousand bullet holes on the wings make the wings heavier but this guy sits back and says you know what in all these airplanes you notice how few bullet holes are actually in the engine and why was that because the airplanes that got shot in the engine they weren't coming back and so the wisdom was put the armor where the bullet holes aren't and this is the way that it was described the reason the planes were coming back with fewer hits to the engine is that planes that got hit in the engine weren't coming back and here's a mathematician in a situation that would be life or death trying to resolve this war trying to figure out a way to conquer the enemy and the prevailing theory and the prevailing idea would be like we want to find the best place to put armor where the most bullet holes are stat by statistic statistics and using math which place is the best and this guy said hold on you're going about it all wrong you don't want to put the armor where the bullet holes are you put them where they aren't i thought about it this way and i think it's even written this way his wisdom wasn't confined to the military's assumptions whatever their assumptions were whatever their justifications were like they had these justifications this is why we need to do this but he had a wisdom that just turned it upside down and said no you're going about it all wrong if it's a if it's kind of a an eye-catching story if it's something that kind of gets your attention i hope that in this moment as we use that example in a real world scenario life or death a military trying to figure out a way to keep planes in the air and to conquer an enemy that that kind of wisdom that was on display to allow them to make a decision when life and death depended upon it just as much as it worked in this mathematician this abraham wall we've got even something greater as it relates to the warfare that we're engaged in where we could take something that all these people have their justifications and their reasons and their assumptions and we could take a step back and say wait a minute we're thinking about it all wrong this is the right thing to do all right go ahead and ask me what's your point brother aaron i'm glad you asked we know we're living in an evil day it's a chaotic confusing complicated age we know we're living in an age that's crazy we know that god has called us to righteousness we know that he's called us to uprightness that the mark of this age it's been said as perfection and then we recognize that our relationships are at best complex and in reality we probably could say they're they're really just complicated we have family strain strains in the family we have habits we have pressures we have all sorts of voices how are we in the circumstances we are in how are we going to raise our children correctly today how are we going to mend our marriages how are we going to enrich our marriages how can we make it through the social political uh and economic upheaval and the divide that exists there's this divide that keeps getting bigger and bigger just in society how are we going to be able to get it through that there's a divide that seems to be getting bigger and bigger even with respect to fellowship and people we love and people that believe this message how are we going to navigate this how are we going to get through it this is what the point i've been trying to make wisdom from above that's how you're going to do it it's the only it's the only wisdom we can rely on and since that's the only thing that's going to get you through this then ask for it and ask god to give you say god give me spiritual insight and spiritual sensitivity because what i need is discernment in this end time to make it through this filthy age clean and remind yourself over and over again that the one you're asking for wisdom is one who can be touched by what you're going through and has been tempted in all points such as we were and was without sin so he knows what to do if we could stand together and pray what's going to do it wisdom from above what do we need to do ask for it with our heads bowed let us go to the lord in prayer a gracious heavenly father i so appreciate a congregation of people that will hang on every word not because it comes from a friend or not because it comes from someone that they have the utmost carnal confidence in and just enjoy the manner in which they speak but lord i believe it's because they know a promise that you made that you would speak to them through gifts that you've given them and so we gather in a hotel conference center on a wednesday night not to play church not even as it were have church but to hear from you and i believe that we have heard from you tonight and you've spoken about the king's sword in such a way to where as our hands grab a hold of this it means more to us than it ever has lord we think about generations past to blaze the trail of god sent a prophet blaze the trail of holiness and blaze the trail of the opening of the word and the casualties along the way of lost children and broken fellowship even lives that end in ruin i believe lord that a generation succeeds these prior ones and takes the momentum from the one past and is pushed forward deeper in your word as it were the last breath of this generation that preceded this says take it all the way go further than we were able to go do more than what we were able to do knowing that what we have been passed is the baton that they were carrying so there's no shame there's no rebuke there's no correction by saying lord let me take it further deeper higher wiser that's what i pray lord i would not be where i am today had it not been for godly men that went before me godly parents and godly labors and godly efforts and lord in light of all that's been done in these cloud of witnesses lord i stand upon these truths and i say lord give me a deeper intimate knowledge of you give me a greater understanding of your word and let me lord with the spirit of truth that's been given us the revelation of this message that's been imparted to us lord may become more practical may become more more simple to us may become an everyday reality and i ask that you give wisdom to us as husbands and mothers and fathers and wives and children whatever calling we may be in are just thinking about circumstances that people find themselves in and thinking that they maybe they had moved way beyond that and these things are in the past they find themselves being challenged in a situation that they thought was long behind them are you giving them a chance now lord to do it right give us wisdom lord i pray you give us wisdom lord made this wisdom be the kind that is from above that's pure easily entreated maybe the kind of wisdom that can bring out christ and somebody else we commit ourselves to you tonight thank you for your presence with us bless us lord as we worship be with your people as they go in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen
