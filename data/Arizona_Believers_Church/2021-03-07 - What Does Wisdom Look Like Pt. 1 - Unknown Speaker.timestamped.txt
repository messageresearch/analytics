[0:01] hallelujah
[0:03] hallelujah that's all we need to be in a
[0:05] heavenly place is his presence
[0:07] amen we rejoice in that it's the voice
[0:10] his voice that declares his presence
[0:13] it says in the garden that they fled god
[0:15] was
[0:16] walking and they fled from the presence
[0:18] of the lord and what was declaring his
[0:19] presence him crying out adam
[0:21] or arthur what a privilege this morning
[0:23] to be gathered into his presence
[0:25] you could take your bibles we'd like to
[0:26] read from hebrews chapter 4
[0:32] and we'll read verses 9 to 16
[0:35] and then and we're just going to jump
[0:36] right into it
[0:38] today and
[0:42] take this beginning with hebrews chapter
[0:44] 4
[0:45] and my my title is what does wisdom look
[0:47] like
[0:49] and i want to say this at the outset
[0:51] that um
[0:52] i'd been pondering to preach um
[0:56] i've been looking at james in the book
[0:58] of james where it says that the wisdom
[0:59] that is from above is first pure then
[1:01] peaceable and it lists all these
[1:02] characteristics of wisdom
[1:04] and how that is very practical what
[1:06] james is teaching us as you
[1:07] even would just you could take time to
[1:09] read the entire book of james it
[1:10] wouldn't take very long
[1:12] and just see what how james is
[1:13] expressing faith the expression of faith
[1:15] and how wisdom is expressed and wisdom
[1:17] from above
[1:19] and how the rest is such an important
[1:22] part of this
[1:23] the practical outcome of wisdom when you
[1:24] have wisdom there's a rest
[1:26] that comes with it and and it just
[1:29] felt zeroed in and got zeroed into where
[1:31] today
[1:32] without even getting into the subject of
[1:34] rest and maybe touching on it some
[1:36] i want to look at how the word is what
[1:38] wisdom looks like wisdom looks like
[1:40] christ christ
[1:40] is the wisdom of god so real wisdom will
[1:43] always align with the word and be
[1:44] reflective of the word so that's our
[1:47] that's our focus but i want to at the
[1:49] beginning
[1:50] talk a little bit about rest and in
[1:52] hebrews chapter four he's actually
[1:54] expressing that he fears uh or he said
[1:58] let us therefore fear he's
[1:59] expressing to everyone let us be
[2:00] concerned and conscious that
[2:02] that we do not fall short of entering
[2:05] into his promise of rest
[2:07] so he says in verse 9 there remaineth
[2:08] therefore a rest to
[2:10] the people of god for he that is entered
[2:13] into his rest
[2:14] he also hath ceased from his own works
[2:16] as god did from his
[2:18] let us labor therefore to enter into
[2:20] that rest
[2:21] lest any man fall after the same example
[2:23] of unbelief
[2:24] for the word of god is quick and
[2:26] powerful and sharper than the two-edged
[2:28] sword
[2:29] piercing even to the dividing asunder of
[2:31] soul and spirit and of joints and moral
[2:33] and as a discerner of the thoughts and
[2:35] intents of the heart neither is there
[2:37] any creature that is not manifest in his
[2:39] sight
[2:40] but all things are naked and opened
[2:41] under the eyes of him with whom
[2:43] we have to do sin then that we have a
[2:46] great high priest that is passed into
[2:48] the heavens
[2:48] jesus the son of god let us hold fast
[2:51] our profession
[2:53] and notice this follows this very
[2:56] outstanding verse to us that we're all
[2:57] very familiar with
[2:58] now that the word of god is a discerner
[3:00] it's sharp it's like a sword
[3:02] and this this is kind of like the hub of
[3:04] god talking about rest
[3:06] paul talking about rest and entering
[3:07] into that rest and then he talks about
[3:09] the word being a discerner and now he's
[3:11] talking about
[3:11] we have a high priest who can be touched
[3:13] and this word this discerning word is
[3:15] right at the center of this rest
[3:17] and this one to whom we can go to who
[3:19] can be touched for we have not a high
[3:21] priest which cannot be touched
[3:23] with the feeling of our infirmities but
[3:24] was at all points tempted
[3:26] like as we are yet without sin let us
[3:29] therefore come boldly that boldly there
[3:31] does not pres
[3:32] mean presumptuously or arrogantly or
[3:33] come in loudly but actually means coming
[3:35] honestly
[3:36] to be frank to be honest we're coming
[3:38] boldly saying hey i'm needy i don't have
[3:39] what i
[3:40] what it takes let us therefore come
[3:42] honestly boldly under the throne of
[3:43] grace
[3:44] that we may obtain mercy and find grace
[3:47] to help
[3:48] in time of need if we could pray
[3:51] together heavenly father
[3:52] as we are gathered together in your
[3:54] presence today we feel that presence
[3:56] and our faith is so energized already
[4:00] and we're finding that we're able to
[4:02] reach out and to believe
[4:04] that all things are possible to lay
[4:06] aside our human instinct to say well
[4:08] this is that and that's that and this
[4:10] has happened and that's happened and
[4:12] it seems like that we're so good at
[4:15] reasoning our way out of
[4:16] a miracle reasoning our way out of a
[4:18] deliverance and reasoning in our way out
[4:20] of a healing
[4:21] the lord with this sense of your
[4:23] presence we've
[4:24] laying those things aside and laying our
[4:26] reasonings aside
[4:28] and we're feeling that the divine is
[4:31] with us and that where you are all
[4:32] things are possible
[4:34] so i pray father that you come and you
[4:35] do something supernatural now
[4:37] you do something that sets at liberty
[4:39] hearts that you come
[4:40] and you do it only you can and that's
[4:42] change the life permanently
[4:44] so we ask father that you come and
[4:45] change us from the inside out speak to
[4:46] us in a powerful way
[4:48] take this word and use it for your glory
[4:50] in the name of lord jesus christ we pray
[4:52] amen amen you can be seated we do want
[4:55] to welcome all the visitors that we have
[4:57] with us and
[4:57] different ones we also have the stefans
[4:59] visiting from texas
[5:01] so god bless you we welcome them it's
[5:03] nice to see our friends
[5:04] here with us this morning so i'm going
[5:07] to just jump right into this
[5:09] our title is what does wisdom look like
[5:11] and kind of uh
[5:12] and i'm wanting to use the word as maybe
[5:14] an answer to that or a subtitle
[5:17] and remember that these very verses we
[5:19] just read
[5:20] that bring into this that just begin to
[5:23] describe the word as being a discerner
[5:25] it being quick and powerful it's said in
[5:28] relation to us being mindful of not
[5:30] failing to enter into that resonances
[5:32] and laboring to enter interest
[5:34] and how that we have a high priest that
[5:36] we can go to so this is where
[5:38] the subject is wisdom and how wisdom
[5:40] will bring a rest
[5:41] but we've got to find that faith's final
[5:43] resting place is in the word of god
[5:45] that when you hear the word of god if
[5:46] it's not mixed with faith
[5:48] and and those two elements do not come
[5:50] together then you're really just
[5:52] on your own now in genesis chapter 3
[5:54] verse 6 we've been looking at this
[5:56] through several months so i know that
[5:57] you
[5:57] are familiar with the details having
[6:00] already been faithfully taught through
[6:01] the years but then also it being
[6:02] recently
[6:03] expressed to us that the serpent
[6:05] beguiles eve and speaks to eve in such a
[6:07] way
[6:08] to cause her to see the tree of
[6:10] knowledge of good and evil differently
[6:12] than how god had described him
[6:14] god had said if when you eat it you're
[6:15] going to die the serpent began to say
[6:17] well no god
[6:18] lied to you said you wouldn't die but
[6:20] when you eat it when you partake of it
[6:22] you'll become as god's knowing good from
[6:24] evil you're going to have this ability
[6:26] to discern
[6:27] and in verse 6 it says and the woman saw
[6:29] when the woman
[6:30] saw so this is something in her
[6:32] perception has
[6:34] changed had you asked her before what do
[6:36] you see when you see the tree of
[6:37] knowledge of good and evil she'd say
[6:38] well i see the potential for death
[6:41] i see that god told us not to eat it but
[6:42] now her perception has changed she's
[6:45] looking at it differently
[6:46] and when the woman saw that the tree was
[6:48] good for food and that it was pleasant
[6:50] to the eyes
[6:51] and a tree desired to make one wise
[6:54] so what was it she was promised she was
[6:56] promised wisdom
[6:58] she was promised insight and some sort
[7:00] of acumen with certain things and an
[7:01] ability
[7:02] and so this is what she sees she sees
[7:05] the potential of wisdom
[7:06] in partaking of this tree she took the
[7:09] fruit thereof and did eat and gave also
[7:11] under her husband with her
[7:12] and he did eat so her perception changes
[7:16] her feelings change it even says that
[7:18] she saw the tree as pleasant to the eyes
[7:20] that phrase actually means she was
[7:21] excited within her lust
[7:23] and so it wasn't that she got hungry for
[7:25] something but her lust was excited
[7:27] and it was a tree to be desired to make
[7:29] one wise that means to become prudent to
[7:31] to have to become circumspect to have
[7:34] understanding so something that was
[7:36] going to make her
[7:37] understanding razor sharp and her
[7:39] perception razor sharp
[7:40] and so as she sees this tree as a source
[7:43] of wisdom
[7:44] we could easily say what she saw wasn't
[7:46] true
[7:48] that when she looked at this tree
[7:49] something had changed with her
[7:50] understanding
[7:51] and the bible tells us that she was
[7:52] deceived she was deceived into thinking
[7:55] that this was a good thing to do she was
[7:57] deceived into thinking
[7:59] that if i do this i'll receive wisdom
[8:01] it'll make me better off it'll do
[8:02] something for me
[8:03] enter into a greater promise or greater
[8:06] greater happiness
[8:07] and so what she saw was a false reality
[8:09] she was sold
[8:10] a bill of goods that weren't true she
[8:12] was defrauded it was a
[8:13] it was a con game so she is beguiled and
[8:16] deceived how is she deceived
[8:18] by thinking she sees something that's
[8:19] not actually true
[8:21] and in second corinthians chapter 11
[8:23] verse 14
[8:25] paul tells us don't marvel don't be
[8:26] surprised don't be shocked for satan
[8:28] himself is transformed
[8:30] into an angel of light so we could be
[8:32] very hard on the woman and say oh that
[8:34] was so foolish god said this and then
[8:36] that happened
[8:37] and we can make it seem like oh it's
[8:39] just so easy these days to figure out
[8:41] what's right or wrong and we would be
[8:43] uh we wouldn't be very honest would we
[8:45] and we can be very hard on the woman in
[8:47] the beginning who fell and we see that
[8:48] she made a mistake and then adam also
[8:50] followed with her in the mistake though
[8:52] he was not deceived but we have to
[8:54] realize that satan has a very powerful
[8:56] way
[8:56] of putting off something and sharing
[8:58] something and expressing something
[9:00] and presenting something to us that at
[9:02] least initially we might be like oh that
[9:03] sounds good well that sounds right
[9:05] that seems plausible it's because he has
[9:08] the ability to present himself
[9:10] as an angel of light so satan doesn't
[9:13] show up i really wish he did dress
[9:14] all in all red with a pitchfork tail and
[9:17] a pointed tail on a pitchfork because
[9:18] then we'd like ah
[9:19] satan you're trying to trick me and he'd
[9:21] be like ah how'd you know
[9:23] but it doesn't work that way he's
[9:25] transformed into an angel of light
[9:27] therefore we see light we see
[9:29] understanding we see
[9:30] reasoning we see all these certain
[9:32] premises and a case being built
[9:34] we think oh well that seems plausible
[9:36] that seems right that seems very
[9:37] inviting
[9:38] and we have to catch ourselves i realize
[9:40] wait a minute satan has the ability to
[9:42] present himself
[9:43] as an angel of light and having that
[9:45] ability what we need to be able to
[9:47] him having that ability god has granted
[9:50] us the ability
[9:51] to recognize a false light brother
[9:54] brandon made this statement he said the
[9:56] powers of satan are many times harder to
[9:58] fight against than it was in any age
[10:00] he has perfected his light presentation
[10:03] he's perfected his light show he can
[10:05] he can uh work work a program and do
[10:08] things and present things
[10:10] in a more powerful way now than he ever
[10:12] has and brother brahma said this is an
[10:13] age of deception it's a great age of
[10:15] deception
[10:16] so satan is working in deception through
[10:19] carnal wisdom
[10:20] and through all sorts of schemes and
[10:22] programs to try to get you
[10:23] to see something the wrong way and if it
[10:27] and i think we should have this
[10:29] appropriate respect for that so that
[10:30] seems very negative well
[10:32] it's not good but it's true
[10:35] it's not good that satan's able to do
[10:37] this but it's true and it's important
[10:38] that we not
[10:39] uh be so to be it's important that we're
[10:41] not ignorant of the fact that satan is
[10:44] like a royal lion who's walking about
[10:46] seeking whom he may devour to consume
[10:47] you and to swallow you up
[10:49] and just accept that that's the reality
[10:50] of the time that we live in it's the
[10:52] reality of the age that we live in it's
[10:53] a very deceitful age
[10:55] and the believer has to be more on his
[10:56] toes now than he was in any age
[10:59] and and that's the reality but if that's
[11:02] the reality on the one hand there's a
[11:03] reality on the other hand
[11:04] wherein god has said because it's going
[11:06] to be the most sinful age it's going to
[11:07] be the most deceitful age because satan
[11:09] has the ability
[11:10] to present himself as an angel of light
[11:12] i'm going to gift you
[11:14] and predestinate you such that you will
[11:16] not fall
[11:18] and so then we're not afraid of being
[11:20] deceived as the bible says in matthew 24
[11:22] 24
[11:23] for there shall arise false christ and
[11:25] false prophets
[11:26] and shall show great signs and wonders
[11:29] in so much that
[11:30] if it were possible they shall deceive
[11:33] the very elect
[11:34] this is something that is an absolute
[11:37] promise that it
[11:38] inoculates us against the deception
[11:42] now that does not mean that we therefore
[11:43] can act foolishly and just
[11:45] take anything we want and go anywhere we
[11:47] want and do whatever we want without the
[11:48] fear of being
[11:49] because we cannot be deceived that that
[11:52] would be foolishness so with this
[11:53] reality that we cannot be deceived
[11:55] what we then need is wisdom to do the
[11:57] right thing not because we're afraid to
[11:59] be just we're going to be deceived but
[12:01] wisdom to do the right thing and not
[12:03] plunge headlong into something well i
[12:04] can't be deceived so i'm just going to
[12:06] go ahead and do this
[12:06] but have the wisdom to know is this the
[12:08] right thing to do i'm not afraid of
[12:10] being deceived but lord is this the
[12:12] right
[12:12] thing to do so the power over deception
[12:15] is this gift of wisdom this gift of
[12:17] discernment
[12:18] that god gives to his children he grants
[12:21] this to his children
[12:23] and james chapter one we've been reading
[12:25] verse five i want to read
[12:26] to verse eight and if you do take time
[12:29] you can go and read
[12:30] just the few chapters the several
[12:32] chapters of the book of james and i
[12:34] think it would be
[12:35] beneficial to you just to kind of catch
[12:37] these several different statements that
[12:39] he makes that just
[12:40] are woven through the um
[12:43] the book it says if any of you lack
[12:46] wisdom this is this prudence this
[12:47] intelligence this ability to discern let
[12:50] him ask god that giveth to all men
[12:52] liberally and abradeth not and it shall
[12:54] be given him
[12:57] verse six but let him ask in faith so
[13:00] there's
[13:00] uh i i guess this is just me me saying
[13:03] this so if you want to put on the side
[13:04] my initials off to the side if you write
[13:06] this down and i i try to
[13:08] i i my daily job am i
[13:11] nine to five or whatever you want to
[13:12] call it my full-time job
[13:14] uh to make a living i do this to make a
[13:17] leaving you know
[13:18] i practice law to make a living i'm
[13:21] literally paid every day to give my
[13:23] opinion and so i'm glad i get paid to
[13:25] give my opinion
[13:26] six days a week or seven days a week in
[13:28] that job because
[13:29] i can't give my opinion in this one and
[13:32] so i get it out during the week so i'm
[13:34] not
[13:34] i don't want to give my opinion but in
[13:36] this when he says but let him ask in
[13:38] faith
[13:39] he it's it's almost as if he's saying
[13:41] now just not anybody can read that and
[13:43] say hey god give me wisdom they're going
[13:44] to become the wisest man in the room
[13:47] the the request has to be made in faith
[13:50] so just nobody can take this scripture
[13:52] and say oh well god says to give me
[13:53] faith hey
[13:54] ask for faith hey give it to me give it
[13:55] to me give it to me he says but let him
[13:57] ask
[13:57] in faith and you'll find that he's
[13:58] dealing with this uh this asking in
[14:01] faith and asking amiss throughout this
[14:02] book for the next few chapters
[14:04] but let him ask in faith nothing
[14:06] wavering in hebrews chapter 4 when
[14:08] he's talking about failing to enter into
[14:10] rest he says the gospel was preached
[14:12] but the word preached did not profit
[14:14] them not being mixed with faith with
[14:16] them that heard it
[14:18] and since it wasn't mixed with faith
[14:19] they did not enter into rest but those
[14:21] who believed
[14:22] enter into rest so it's not just hearing
[14:24] and acknowledging but it has to be mixed
[14:26] with faith
[14:27] to draw the believer into rest why
[14:29] because you're resting
[14:30] by faith not in circumstance not in your
[14:33] own wisdom not in your own ability to
[14:34] figure it out
[14:35] says but let him ask in faith nothing
[14:37] wavering
[14:38] for he that wavereth is like a wave of
[14:40] the sea driven with the wind and tossed
[14:43] for let not that man think that he shall
[14:45] receive anything from the lord if he's
[14:48] doubtful if he doesn't believe
[14:49] if he's just doing it well the bible
[14:51] says if i ask i get it if he's real
[14:52] maybe i'll get it
[14:53] saying that this man who's wavering and
[14:55] tossed around
[14:56] don't think that you're going to get the
[14:58] wisdom you ask for and don't think
[15:00] you're going to get anything you ask for
[15:01] if you're not asking in faith verse 8
[15:05] a double-minded man is unstable in
[15:08] all his ways a double-minded man is
[15:12] unstable
[15:13] in all his ways the one who asks must
[15:15] first believe that he is he must believe
[15:17] in whom he's asking
[15:18] he has been saved by grace through faith
[15:21] so faith is
[15:22] a part of his experience he has this
[15:24] faith in god he can take and say lord
[15:26] i lack wisdom i need wisdom and he can
[15:28] ask in faith not wavering believing
[15:31] that god is going to grant him and give
[15:33] him this wisdom
[15:34] and so james when he says if any man
[15:36] lack wisdom ask god but this is based
[15:39] upon some understanding
[15:40] that there's a faith in god there's a
[15:42] conviction that god is right there's a
[15:43] belief in his word
[15:45] for a double-minded man this phrase
[15:48] double-minded man it means a doubter as
[15:50] he's already said it's a waver
[15:52] it's somebody with divided loyalties so
[15:54] they're unsure
[15:55] they're uncommitted well you give me
[15:57] wisdom but i've got these other
[15:59] contingencies
[16:00] well i'm just not so sure that the word
[16:02] has all my answers or whatever the
[16:03] whatever the contingency may be but
[16:05] there's another backup plan
[16:07] or there's some sort of divided
[16:08] loyalties or there's not a full selling
[16:10] out saying you know what
[16:11] i believe that god knows i trust god i'm
[16:14] surrendered to him i'm accepting his
[16:15] mind
[16:16] so the double-minded man it's i
[16:19] and i just feel very very focused to
[16:22] express
[16:23] this and and do it very succinctly and
[16:25] not spend much time on this
[16:27] a double-minded man is not the believer
[16:30] who's filled with the holy ghost who
[16:32] wrestles with
[16:33] temptations and doubt that's not the
[16:35] double-minded man
[16:36] because the believer who has the holy
[16:38] ghost and who struggles with questions
[16:39] and different things
[16:40] is not unstable in all his ways just has
[16:43] areas in his life that he needs to
[16:45] surrender more and god to come on the
[16:46] scene and make
[16:47] make better but a double-minded man
[16:50] wants to be religious on one hand
[16:51] wants to follow the lord wants to love
[16:53] the lord on one hand
[16:55] but prefers the world and the things of
[16:57] the world on the other
[16:58] that's the double-minded man the
[16:59] double-minded man is the man who says in
[17:01] his mind well i love god i think this is
[17:03] the truth i want to serve the lord
[17:05] but on the other hand starts
[17:06] rationalizing well i don't know if i
[17:08] like what servant lord looks like or i
[17:09] really love this and i really love that
[17:11] and this new album is going to drop or
[17:13] this new movie's coming out in this
[17:15] series and
[17:15] and they start thinking what's going to
[17:17] happen if i give my heart to lord i have
[17:18] to give up this
[17:19] it's just the game that we start doing
[17:21] inside our head that's a double-minded
[17:23] man
[17:23] and a double-minded man is unstable in
[17:26] all his ways
[17:27] if he thinks he wants to serve god but
[17:29] really loves the world more he's not
[17:30] going to find stability in either walk
[17:33] in either endeavor you're going to be
[17:35] miserable when he's sinning he's going
[17:36] to be
[17:37] miserable when he goes to church but
[17:39] that's the double-minded man he's
[17:40] unstable in all his ways he's
[17:42] he has a he may profess christ but not
[17:45] being born again
[17:46] he's unable to be settled because that
[17:49] word unstable in all his ways it means
[17:52] restless in everything he thinks feels
[17:54] and decides
[17:56] a double-minded man is unstable in all
[17:58] his ways if he has this well i want to
[17:59] serve god and i want to do the right
[18:00] thing but i really love these other
[18:02] things
[18:02] he's going to be not find rest and
[18:05] contentment
[18:06] when he he's doing these things that he
[18:08] still likes
[18:09] it's his unstableness in all his ways
[18:11] he's restless and everything he thinks
[18:12] feels and decides he lacks peace
[18:14] he lacks contentment he lacks rest
[18:18] a double-minded man is unstable he lacks
[18:20] rest
[18:21] so a double-minded man is not born ag is
[18:24] is not born again so when we the bible
[18:27] speaks of a double-minded man who's not
[18:29] at rest he's talking about somebody
[18:30] he's not talking about a born-again
[18:31] christian who struggles with worldliness
[18:34] but he's talking about someone who lacks
[18:35] a birth
[18:37] that's what the bible is teaching us
[18:38] that a double-minded man who's unstable
[18:40] in all his ways
[18:41] he lacks a birth so james says in james
[18:43] chapter 4 verse 8
[18:45] draw an eye to god and he will draw
[18:47] night to you
[18:48] cleanse your hands ye sinners purify
[18:51] your hearts
[18:51] ye double-minded so the double-minded
[18:54] are the
[18:55] the sinners it's the it's it's those
[18:57] whose hearts have not been purified
[18:58] through the baptism of the holy ghost
[19:00] this is who he's talking to he says the
[19:02] double-minded man is unstable in all his
[19:04] ways
[19:04] the person who in his mind says well i
[19:06] love god i love the word i love the
[19:08] message i want to serve god but i really
[19:10] love this and i really love that and i'm
[19:11] not so sure i want to i struggle with
[19:12] this or this is who i am
[19:14] whatever that battle is that creates the
[19:16] lack of rest the restlessness and the
[19:18] instability
[19:18] throughout that person's entire life and
[19:21] so they can't find the joys we're saying
[19:23] in a moment they can't find
[19:24] the joy in the world that they really
[19:25] want to get out of it because they have
[19:26] this other part of their mind that says
[19:27] well is that really who you are and what
[19:29] you really want to do and don't you
[19:30] really want to serve the lord
[19:31] and it's this battle in the mind that's
[19:33] the double-minded man
[19:35] now there's a beautiful part about being
[19:37] being the elect of god
[19:39] the devil fights against us when we're
[19:41] in the world
[19:42] and we feel that wow you know i i can't
[19:46] really find
[19:46] full happiness and joy while i'm out in
[19:48] the world but when i go to church i'm a
[19:49] hypocrite because i'm sinning and i'm
[19:51] doing this and i'm doing that
[19:52] but let me tell you something it's when
[19:54] you're in the world that you're a
[19:55] hypocrite
[19:56] because down inside of you you're a son
[19:58] or daughter of god and when you're in
[19:59] the world you're testifying that you're
[20:01] not
[20:01] church is the only place you can't be a
[20:03] hypocrite
[20:04] because that you're hearing who you
[20:06] really are you're hearing from where you
[20:07] rarely came from
[20:08] so don't let this whole thing about
[20:10] hypocrisy keep you out of the house of
[20:11] god because it doesn't stop you from
[20:13] going to chipotle
[20:15] right it ain't ever stopped you from
[20:18] going to a restaurant it has never
[20:19] stopped you from going to a grocery
[20:21] store
[20:22] hypocrisy has never stopped you from
[20:24] doing everything else
[20:25] why should it stop you from coming to
[20:26] the house of god saying you know what
[20:27] deep down inside i believe this is who i
[20:29] am this is where i belong
[20:31] and don't let hypocrisy keep you from
[20:32] doing it
[20:35] so draw an eye to god and he will draw
[20:37] an eye to you cleanse your hands you
[20:39] sinners and purify your heart she
[20:40] double-minded
[20:41] brother braham said don't be
[20:42] double-minded throw your whole life to
[20:44] him and believe him with all your heart
[20:47] that double mindedness speaks of the
[20:49] person who has not fully surrendered
[20:51] and been born again by the holy ghost so
[20:53] the the teachings
[20:55] that james is lifting up are not things
[20:58] that we could just all take and say
[21:00] these are good principles and if we just
[21:01] live by them our lives will be easier
[21:03] this is something that's being spoken to
[21:04] those who have faith this is something
[21:06] that a believer can place before them
[21:08] who's been born again and say
[21:10] as i walk and grow in the grace of god
[21:12] these are things that i can see as
[21:14] evidence of the work of god in my life
[21:17] in james chapter 1 verses 17 to 18
[21:20] it says if you lack wisdom ask god and
[21:23] so he says
[21:24] every good and every perfect gift is
[21:26] from above
[21:27] later we'll read where he says wisdom
[21:28] from above every good gift and every
[21:30] perfect gift is from above
[21:32] and cometh down from the father of
[21:34] lights with whom
[21:35] is no variableness neither shadow of
[21:37] training there's no darkness in god
[21:39] there's no shadows in god there's no
[21:42] untoward deception there's nothing he's
[21:44] doing where he's hiding himself
[21:45] to deceive you there's nothing there's
[21:47] no darkness there's no evil there's no
[21:48] shadow
[21:49] there's full light and illumination in
[21:51] him and if you receive wisdom from him
[21:53] this is not a dark wisdom this isn't a a
[21:55] dark art this is something that is true
[21:57] and pure
[21:58] of his own will be he us with the word
[22:02] of truth
[22:03] that we could be a kind of first fruits
[22:05] of his
[22:06] creatures let him ask in faith not
[22:09] wavering
[22:10] this is the one whose mind has been
[22:12] purified this is one whose hands who
[22:14] have been cleansed
[22:14] he have been born again by the word of
[22:16] god being born again by the word of god
[22:19] the double mind has been defeated now we
[22:22] may still doubt we may still wrestle but
[22:23] you're not unstable in all your ways
[22:25] because you have
[22:26] some anchor on the inside of you and
[22:28] we've all can testify to this who've
[22:30] been born again
[22:31] that we have patches in our lives where
[22:33] it just feels like we go into a tailspin
[22:34] but guess what at some point the
[22:36] traction control
[22:37] of the holy ghost gets us and catches us
[22:40] and keeps us from hitting the ditch and
[22:41] we when we get back on the straight and
[22:43] narrow
[22:44] what is that that's the word of god
[22:45] being birthed in our hearts being born
[22:47] again by the word of truth
[22:48] that double mind has been defeated so
[22:50] we're not restless and unstable in
[22:52] all our ways and therefore we can ask
[22:55] with faith for wisdom we can ask god for
[22:58] guidance
[23:00] and as you read the book of james and
[23:01] we're not going to do it this morning at
[23:02] least i don't think we are
[23:04] i might do it this afternoon 1201 turn
[23:07] to james chapter
[23:08] 1 verse 1. but if you as you read it
[23:10] you'll find that james is placing wisdom
[23:12] as the crown
[23:13] in consummation of the character of the
[23:15] true believer
[23:16] that's taking wisdom and he's placing
[23:18] this is where this is where the believer
[23:20] really shines
[23:21] this is where the proof of a believer is
[23:25] made manifest is when they act in wisdom
[23:27] and they display themselves in wisdom
[23:29] because james is going to teach us that
[23:31] wisdom acts
[23:33] there's a saying that says it's better
[23:35] to be stay quiet and be perceived as a
[23:37] fool
[23:38] than to open your mouth and remove all
[23:39] doubt
[23:41] and so wisdom acts even if it doesn't
[23:44] act it's acting
[23:46] wisdom will constrain conduct wisdom
[23:48] will close the mouth wisdom will cause
[23:49] you to say and do things
[23:51] but wisdom is something that acts it's
[23:52] not silent it's not ineffective it's not
[23:54] just a
[23:55] it's something that's lazy without power
[23:57] but wisdom acts
[23:59] and when james is lifting up wisdom he's
[24:01] talking about something more than just
[24:02] knowledge to the jews it meant something
[24:05] that had a broader range of thought a
[24:07] more direct
[24:08] influence upon character than just
[24:10] knowing something
[24:12] that this this wisdom was something that
[24:14] impacted thought process this wisdom was
[24:16] something that impacted actions
[24:18] that if it changed your thought process
[24:19] then it would change your language it
[24:21] would change the way you talk
[24:22] if it impacted your thought process and
[24:24] had a much broader range of thought
[24:26] then it would change the way you conduct
[24:27] yourselves so the wisdom is something
[24:29] more than just
[24:30] knowing something it's a broader range
[24:32] of that that influences the character of
[24:34] a true believer
[24:35] and the conduct of a true believer in
[24:38] james chapter 2 verse 18
[24:40] yeah a man may say thou hast faith and i
[24:42] have works
[24:43] show me thy faith without thy works and
[24:45] i will show thee my faith
[24:47] by my works
[24:50] somebody may say well i have faith and i
[24:52] don't have works but faith is what
[24:53] matters and faith is what's important
[24:55] and as long as i have faith i'm doing
[24:56] good
[24:57] but we're taught that works is faith
[24:59] expressed
[25:00] that if you say that you have faith and
[25:02] don't have any works
[25:04] it's vanity james says you're a dead man
[25:06] you don't have any life in it
[25:08] and he's teaching us that abraham's
[25:10] faith was reached its full and supreme
[25:12] expression
[25:13] when he acted when he did something that
[25:16] even to the world may seem crazy
[25:18] god promised you a son you finally get
[25:20] the son and now you're telling me that
[25:21] god told you to sacrifice the son
[25:23] and so you're going to go offer up your
[25:24] son upon the altar into the world
[25:26] that's crazy that's insane but to god
[25:29] that was perfect faith
[25:31] because abraham was willing to
[25:32] demonstrate that my faith is so strong
[25:35] that i can actually take this one that
[25:37] was promised to me and do what god
[25:39] said knowing that he's obligated to
[25:41] raise him up
[25:43] he's obligated to do it i know he's
[25:45] going to do it i i know this because
[25:46] we've had a conversation and he told me
[25:48] that it would be this seed through which
[25:51] all the
[25:52] this promise to me and i'd be a father
[25:53] of many nations is going to come
[25:55] so he says i and the lad will return
[25:57] we're going to come back
[25:58] and god provided and that's how his
[26:01] faith reached that's full of supreme
[26:03] expression
[26:04] and james is saying that you can say
[26:05] that you have faith but i will
[26:07] show you my faith by my works
[26:11] i'll show you that i have wisdom by the
[26:13] fruits of wisdom
[26:14] you'll be able to witness wisdom by how
[26:17] it works out in my life
[26:19] matthew 11 19 the son of man came eating
[26:21] and drinking and they say
[26:23] they were criticizing john the baptist
[26:24] had a lot of nasty things to say about
[26:26] him
[26:27] and now they have a lot a lot of nasty
[26:28] things to say about the son of man
[26:30] and that's why it shouldn't bother you
[26:32] if they have a lot of nasty things to
[26:34] say about you
[26:35] the title my working title what i
[26:37] thought i was going to preach this
[26:38] morning is getting beneath and living
[26:39] above
[26:41] because if you're ever going to help
[26:42] somebody you have to get beneath them
[26:44] but in order to get beneath them you
[26:45] have to be living above everything else
[26:47] all the criticisms what everybody else
[26:48] has to say the way they characterize
[26:50] what you do
[26:50] don't worry about faith is what matters
[26:52] you know you're doing the will of god
[26:53] stay the course perhaps they may be
[26:56] doing the will of god by running their
[26:58] mouths
[26:59] they may be doing what god asked them to
[27:00] do speak evil of them okay i'll do that
[27:03] and they may just be doing what they're
[27:05] asked just like that prophet one time
[27:07] a young prophet was told you go and
[27:08] prophesy and you come back and don't you
[27:10] stop for nothing
[27:12] or you'll die young man went out and did
[27:14] exactly what god told them to do as he's
[27:16] returning he was met by another prophet
[27:17] an old prophet
[27:18] who had been told by god to stop the
[27:20] young prophet and get him off task
[27:23] and so the old prophet says why don't
[27:24] you come and terry with me and dying and
[27:26] have a meal
[27:27] he said oh well no i've been told to do
[27:28] this i've been told to do this he's like
[27:30] oh well you know what it's okay
[27:32] god told me to stop you what'd he do he
[27:34] stopped
[27:35] and god took his life because one can do
[27:38] what they're supposed to do
[27:41] and and everything be okay as long as
[27:42] you do what you're supposed to do
[27:44] and so the criticism shouldn't stop you
[27:46] the negative things shouldn't stop you
[27:47] we can live above that
[27:48] in order to get beneath somebody else
[27:50] and help them and so
[27:52] he's saying that the son of man comes
[27:53] eating and drinking i say behold a
[27:55] gluttonous and wine bibber friend
[27:56] republicans and sinners he says but
[27:58] wisdom is justified over children
[28:01] this is a phrase that says true wisdom
[28:03] is shows itself by its works
[28:06] foolishness is made manifest in the
[28:08] criticism of the son of man foolishness
[28:10] is made manifest in the one who's doing
[28:11] what god asked him to do foolishness is
[28:13] made manifest
[28:13] and those that rant and rail and
[28:15] criticize and draw their swords against
[28:17] another brother
[28:17] that's foolishness that's child's play
[28:19] that that doesn't edified or do anything
[28:21] and he's saying listen
[28:23] that kind of foolishness you can discern
[28:25] but wisdom is justified over children
[28:27] those
[28:27] who take wisdom will enjoy the fruits of
[28:29] wisdom
[28:31] those who are born by the word of god
[28:33] will enjoy the benefits of the word of
[28:34] god
[28:35] those who have wisdom wisdom is
[28:37] justified
[28:38] of her children the proof is in the
[28:40] pudding
[28:42] meaning when you eat it that's the proof
[28:44] you have the pudding it's in the eating
[28:46] thereof and that's what it's being said
[28:47] about wisdom
[28:48] wisdom is justified over children those
[28:50] who are born
[28:51] and animated and lived by wisdom are the
[28:53] proof that it is wisdom
[28:58] so true wisdom shows itself by what it
[29:01] does what it says and what it does
[29:04] we're asking the question what does
[29:05] wisdom look like
[29:08] we have a couple of poster boards in our
[29:09] homeschool room that says uh what does
[29:11] respect look like
[29:13] and when what does respect sound like
[29:15] because you want to know what it looks
[29:17] like and what it sounds like so you can
[29:18] learn what respect
[29:19] is we want to know what wisdom looks
[29:21] like so we can know whether or not we
[29:23] have wisdom
[29:24] and we're exercising wisdom and first
[29:27] corinthians chapter 1 verses 18 to 25
[29:31] he said for the preacher of the cross is
[29:33] to them that perish foolishness
[29:35] so we don't cause pre we don't say
[29:37] preaching is foolishness
[29:39] because it's only foolishness to those
[29:42] who don't believe in the preaching of
[29:43] the cross
[29:45] to those that perish so when we say the
[29:48] foolishness of preaching we're saying
[29:49] that's what the world
[29:50] calls it for the preacher the cross is
[29:52] to them that perish foolishness but unto
[29:54] us which are saved
[29:55] it is the power of god the preaching of
[29:57] the gospel is the power of god
[29:59] for it is written i will destroy the
[30:01] wisdom of the wise and i will bring to
[30:03] nothing the understanding of the prudent
[30:05] this is those
[30:06] who are wise and their own conceits
[30:08] these are those that are wise
[30:09] in their own uh intellect and their own
[30:12] carnal ability i'm going to destroy that
[30:13] i'm going to
[30:14] turn it i'm going to bring to nothing
[30:15] the understanding of the prudent those
[30:17] who are skilled in worldly affairs and
[30:19] politics and whatever else
[30:20] those are the ones that are going to be
[30:22] turned upside down by my wisdom
[30:24] where is the wise where is the scribe
[30:27] where is the disputer of this world hath
[30:30] not god made
[30:31] foolish the wisdom of this world for
[30:33] after that in the wisdom of god the
[30:35] world by wisdom knew not god
[30:37] it pleased god
[30:41] it pleased god by the foolishness of
[30:43] preaching to save them that believe
[30:45] for the jews require a sign and the
[30:48] greeks seek after wisdom
[30:49] not the right kind of wisdom this is the
[30:51] sophist this is the
[30:52] the the intellectual debate but we
[30:55] preach christ crucified
[30:57] and this christ that's preached is unto
[30:59] the jews a stumbling block who wanted a
[31:01] sign but are stumbled by it
[31:02] and under the greeks foolishness who
[31:04] want wisdom but here's the
[31:05] personification of it
[31:07] but unto them which are called both jews
[31:10] and greeks christ
[31:12] the power of god and the wisdom of god
[31:16] so christ is the power of god christ
[31:19] is the wisdom of god christ the word the
[31:21] logos
[31:22] is the wisdom of god what does the word
[31:24] look like the wisdom look like
[31:25] it looks like the word what is the word
[31:27] the word is christ christ the power of
[31:30] god and the wisdom of god
[31:32] because the foolishness of god is wiser
[31:34] than men
[31:35] and the weakness of god is stronger than
[31:37] men
[31:39] this is what wisdom looks like christ
[31:42] the power of god
[31:43] christ the wisdom of god set against
[31:46] foolishness
[31:47] set against worldly things set against
[31:49] carnal things set against things
[31:51] that just relate to the intellect of a
[31:52] man and the feelings of a man and how a
[31:54] man
[31:54] is made to think and how amanda is made
[31:56] to feel by his own feelings
[32:00] so wisdom as it says christ is the power
[32:02] and wisdom god this speaks of
[32:03] discernment
[32:04] this is talking about understanding
[32:05] christ is the power of god and the
[32:07] wisdom of god
[32:09] this is something that we can only have
[32:11] this kind of wisdom is something we can
[32:12] only have
[32:14] through the word kind of wisdom that
[32:17] we're talking about the kind of wisdom
[32:18] that james says if you lack wisdom ask
[32:20] god
[32:20] when he says ask god for wisdom it's not
[32:22] the wisdom that god
[32:23] destroys he says let us it destroys the
[32:25] wisdom of the wise
[32:26] and the understanding of the prudence
[32:28] that's not what we're wanting
[32:30] listen we're not wanting to know when to
[32:32] jump in and out of bitcoin
[32:33] right if you do that you're going to go
[32:36] crazy
[32:37] and so we're not wanting wisdom on how
[32:39] to play the stock market well should i
[32:40] move everything right now into
[32:42] bonds or i want to have wisdom to know
[32:43] the right way to swing a softball bat
[32:45] all right
[32:45] that's the kind of wisdom we want we
[32:47] want the wisdom to know what's right and
[32:49] wrong we want to know the wisdom to know
[32:50] what's best
[32:52] i mean we ought to be maturing to a
[32:53] place where this is good this is good
[32:55] this is better this is better
[32:56] and we ought to have a desire in our
[32:57] heart to where good becomes better and
[32:59] better becomes best
[33:01] that there's things in my life that yes
[33:03] things are good and things are getting
[33:04] better but lord at the end of the day
[33:05] what i want is very good as god came to
[33:07] his conclusion
[33:08] very good at rest at peace this is the
[33:10] best that's what we're striving for
[33:13] and we can only find that through christ
[33:15] the word
[33:17] ephesians 1 17 that the god of our lord
[33:19] jesus christ this is paul's prayer now
[33:21] the god of our lord jesus christ the
[33:23] father glory may give unto you
[33:25] the spirit of wisdom and revelation
[33:28] in the knowledge of him through the
[33:31] knowledge of him and knowing him
[33:33] you can have you have now a spirit of
[33:35] wisdom and a spirit of revelation
[33:37] through the knowledge of the more that
[33:38] you come to know him the more you fall
[33:41] in love with him
[33:42] the more revelation and wisdom you have
[33:45] practical
[33:46] wisdom practical discernment practical
[33:49] revelation
[33:50] it really honestly at the end of the day
[33:53] does us no good
[33:55] to be able to chart and diagram all the
[33:57] scriptures and properly place
[33:58] every single mystery and it not make a
[34:01] difference in your life
[34:03] you're not able to to to love your
[34:04] spouse you're not able to
[34:06] raise your children the correct way
[34:07] you're not able to be honest with work
[34:09] you're not able to
[34:10] to to be honest with your fellow brother
[34:11] really at the end of the day how could
[34:13] you ever make the argument that that's
[34:14] real
[34:15] wisdom from above that this is the real
[34:16] life of christ if it's not making a
[34:18] difference in every phase of your life
[34:22] the spirit of wisdom and revelation and
[34:24] the knowledge of him in colossians 3 16
[34:26] cortana christ
[34:28] the word is what brings us this wisdom
[34:30] let the word of christ dwell in you
[34:31] richly
[34:32] in all wisdom let the word of christ
[34:36] dwell in you
[34:37] richly in all wisdom that's what that's
[34:40] the rich i want that's the riches i want
[34:42] to have that i'm dwelling in your heart
[34:43] richly in all wisdom so it's the word
[34:46] that'll make us wise
[34:48] it's the word that strengthens our
[34:49] discernment it's the word that gives us
[34:51] the ability
[34:51] to recognize what's better and what's
[34:53] best it's the word that can guide us in
[34:55] difficult situations
[34:57] through our growing faith in jesus
[34:59] christ as our faith grows and as our
[35:00] faith is increasing in jesus christ so
[35:02] does our discernment grow
[35:04] so does our wisdom grow paul writes to
[35:07] timothy in 2 timothy chapter 3 verses 15
[35:09] to 17
[35:11] and that from a child he's speaking
[35:13] specifically to timothy how he had been
[35:15] taught the scriptures and faithfully
[35:16] taught by his mother and his grandmother
[35:18] and from a child thou hast known the
[35:20] holy scriptures which are able to make
[35:22] thee wise unto salvation
[35:24] through faith which is in christ jesus
[35:26] why are the scriptures able to make you
[35:28] wise unto deliverance through your faith
[35:30] in jesus christ
[35:31] and by having faith in jesus christ the
[35:33] word is able to increase
[35:35] your understanding and increase your
[35:37] knowledge it's able to make you wise
[35:39] unto full deliverance under full
[35:40] salvation unto full
[35:42] um wholeness and completeness of mind
[35:45] and body
[35:46] scripture is able to make thee wise into
[35:47] salvation through faith which is in
[35:49] christ jesus
[35:50] all scripture is given by inspiration of
[35:52] god and is profitable for doctrine
[35:54] for reproof for correction for
[35:56] instruction and righteousness
[35:57] that the man of god may be perfect
[35:59] throughly furnished
[36:00] unto all good works what's the practical
[36:04] outcome of faith being active within
[36:05] someone's life
[36:06] they are thoroughly furnished thoroughly
[36:08] furnished unto good works
[36:11] they have the they have the fruit or the
[36:12] evidence they have a life wisdom acts
[36:14] so faith is active i'll show you my
[36:16] faith by my works is what james is
[36:19] saying
[36:19] that the faith i have is going to
[36:21] manifest itself
[36:23] in practical action practical thought in
[36:26] the right things to say and the right
[36:27] things to do
[36:29] i'd like to expand it even further this
[36:32] morning but i'll just make reference to
[36:33] it the bible says walk in wisdom towards
[36:35] them that are without
[36:37] meaning we must walk wisely towards
[36:39] those who are not christians to those
[36:41] who are outside the body of christ to
[36:42] those who believe
[36:43] not because your actions your attitude
[36:46] the way you think the way you act is
[36:48] going to be reflective
[36:50] of the word of god reflective of what
[36:53] you believe
[36:54] and you want to be in a position to help
[36:56] but then also the world is going to be
[36:57] less forgiving than your brother should
[36:59] be
[36:59] would be at least that's what paul
[37:02] thought when he wrote it nowadays it
[37:04] seems like your brother in christ is
[37:06] harder on you than your neighbor but
[37:08] really that's what he's saying hey if
[37:09] you
[37:09] if you make a mistake and you stumble
[37:11] your brother knows what you're going
[37:12] through your fellow sister those who
[37:14] believe with you they know hey things
[37:16] are hard it's okay let's keep going
[37:17] if you lack a little bit of wisdom
[37:19] there's forgiveness there
[37:21] and they're able to forgive adapt and
[37:22] overcome they're able to just take it
[37:24] say you know what
[37:25] the people have weaknesses things happen
[37:27] and your brother will do that but the
[37:28] world
[37:28] isn't able to do that and is not always
[37:30] willing to do that so it says you got to
[37:32] walk in wish you got to display yourself
[37:33] with a certain character a certain
[37:35] attitude certain mindset
[37:36] that the way you talk the way you walk
[37:38] the way you live you have to use wisdom
[37:40] in the way that you're acting
[37:42] and so the word is able to make us wise
[37:45] and says the bible is profitable for
[37:46] doctrine we prove correction instruction
[37:48] and righteousness
[37:49] if you have faith in jesus christ
[37:52] if you have faith in jesus christ in
[37:55] colossians chapter 2 verses 1 to 4
[37:58] for i would that you knew what great
[37:59] conflict i have for you
[38:01] and for them at laodicea for as many as
[38:03] have not seen my face in the flesh
[38:05] that their hearts this is his burden
[38:07] this is his conflict that their
[38:08] hearts might be comforted and being knit
[38:11] together in love
[38:13] unto all riches of the full assurance of
[38:16] understanding to the acknowledgement of
[38:19] the mystery of god
[38:20] and of the father and of christ and whom
[38:23] are hid
[38:24] all the treasures of wisdom and
[38:25] knowledge and this i
[38:27] say lest any man should beguile you with
[38:30] enticing words
[38:32] his burden for those at colossia his
[38:34] burden for those
[38:35] them at laodicea is that their hearts
[38:38] might be comforted
[38:39] being knit together in love and through
[38:41] the comfort of the holy ghost through
[38:43] the word
[38:43] that be in their bond that they would
[38:45] grow into he says all riches of the full
[38:48] assurance of
[38:48] understanding so understanding then
[38:52] has a full assurance that comes with it
[38:55] understanding has
[38:56] a fullness of riches that comes with it
[38:58] this is why understanding is so
[39:00] important
[39:00] that if you have full understanding it
[39:03] brings
[39:04] full assurance if you have full
[39:06] understanding it brings the fullness of
[39:08] riches
[39:09] so as your understanding increases
[39:11] there's an increase of your fullness
[39:13] there's an increase of
[39:14] of assurance there's an increase of
[39:16] riches that's the kind of wealthy i want
[39:18] to be that's the portfolio that i just i
[39:20] want to see going straight up
[39:22] is my portfolio of understanding because
[39:24] with it a greater assurance
[39:26] with it a greater a greater um greater
[39:29] riches
[39:30] of assurance
[39:34] to the acknowledgement of the mystery of
[39:36] god this word acknowledgement is more it
[39:38] has more force
[39:39] than just knowledge but it's unto a
[39:41] greater and more perfect knowledge
[39:43] of the mystery of god a greater and more
[39:46] perfect
[39:47] knowledge of the mystery of god
[39:51] it says in whom speaking of christ and
[39:54] of the father and of christ the mystery
[39:56] of god unto the father and of christ
[39:57] in whom are hid all treasures of wisdom
[40:00] and knowledge
[40:01] in christ is hid all the treasures
[40:05] of wisdom and knowledge and wisdom and
[40:07] knowledge being used together in this
[40:09] instance is speaking of the mind of god
[40:11] it speaks of a knowledge that god has it
[40:13] speaks of a wisdom that god has it's not
[40:15] speaking of anything natural or anything
[40:17] that would be part of our
[40:18] base instincts as a man it's in the in
[40:20] whom and christ are hid
[40:22] all the treasures of wisdom and
[40:24] knowledge are hid in jesus christ so who
[40:26] do you want to go to to get wisdom
[40:27] christ who do you need a revelation of a
[40:30] knowledge of in order to have wisdom and
[40:32] all the treasures of wisdom and
[40:33] knowledge you need to go to christ
[40:35] wisdom and knowledge speak of the mind
[40:36] of god god is the master of
[40:38] all intelligence there's no one smarter
[40:42] than him
[40:44] i had a brother tell me one time he's a
[40:45] pastor on the east coast that
[40:47] when he began to serve the lord he was
[40:49] they were singing that song
[40:50] we know it to be our god rings
[40:54] he had both hands lifted up in the air
[40:55] singing he i believe he heard somebody
[40:58] else singing it was
[40:58] what it was he walked by a brother on
[41:00] the front row is kind of a new convert
[41:02] and they were on the front row and they
[41:03] had both arms up they're saying i've got
[41:06] brains and i think i think the
[41:10] understanding was since they served god
[41:11] they had
[41:11] came to the lord they had to be kind of
[41:13] they had to be pretty sharp to do them
[41:15] but if we say our god reigns and our
[41:18] gods got brains too
[41:20] he's the master of all intelligence no
[41:22] one's smarter him than no one's going to
[41:23] outsmart him no one's going to trick him
[41:24] no one's going to pull one over on him
[41:26] he's the master of all intelligence and
[41:28] he says this if you look at verse 4
[41:30] again i say that
[41:31] lest any man should beguile you with
[41:34] enticing words i say this because men
[41:35] would want to deceive you with
[41:36] philosophy
[41:37] and subtle reasoning and since it's not
[41:40] an innocent world and it's a great age
[41:42] of deception and because men would want
[41:44] to deceive you and mislead you
[41:45] through philosophy and subtle reasoning
[41:47] what i want for you to pray for
[41:49] is that as your hearts are being knit
[41:51] together in love that you would receive
[41:52] the full assurance and the full riches
[41:54] of understanding
[41:55] by unknowing the mystery of god
[41:59] that through the revelation of the word
[42:00] of god that your understanding would be
[42:02] enriched and increased
[42:03] and you would come to a place where
[42:04] you're able to say wait a minute
[42:06] i'm being misled my feelings are leading
[42:08] me down the wrong path
[42:09] i'm coming under a particular feeling or
[42:12] emotion
[42:12] that i know is trending towards
[42:14] something that's negative and you can
[42:15] recognize that say no
[42:16] no i don't want to do that so i'm even
[42:19] placing in the context to where we're
[42:20] not able to deceive ourselves
[42:23] because our emotions can deceive us
[42:28] so that would deceive you with enticing
[42:29] words it's a false premise that's not
[42:31] easily
[42:32] discovered it's an enticing word because
[42:34] there's a part to it that seems
[42:36] that seems reasonable it's something
[42:38] that's not easily discovered
[42:40] so that if one is unwise they can be
[42:43] carried away into air
[42:46] understanding and acknowledgement of the
[42:48] mystery is important when trying to
[42:50] defend against
[42:52] these subtle the subtle reasonings in
[42:53] philosophy
[42:57] there was a a priest i think it was in
[42:59] the 1500s that
[43:00] made this statement the subtlety of
[43:02] human reasonings has always been the
[43:04] stumbling block of faith
[43:07] the subtlety of human reasoning has
[43:10] always been the stumbling block of faith
[43:12] we can say we could say it's possible
[43:14] with god this is impossible or this is
[43:16] possible god can do this but then we
[43:18] begin to talk about all the reasons why
[43:19] he won't or all the reasons why he can't
[43:22] this is what we're praying for this is
[43:24] what we want this is what we believe god
[43:25] should do for us but then we begin to
[43:27] talk about all the reasons why it's not
[43:28] possible
[43:29] we i could even say honestly as we
[43:31] desire to have a church building and
[43:32] we're not just trying to rack up hilton
[43:34] honors points
[43:34] we want to have a permanent church
[43:36] building and we could look at a facility
[43:38] and it's easy to start giving all the
[43:40] reasons why this isn't going to work
[43:42] instead of saying you know what
[43:42] if god wants us to have this then
[43:44] there's no good reason we shouldn't have
[43:46] it
[43:48] it doesn't it doesn't matter how much or
[43:49] it doesn't matter where it doesn't
[43:51] all these different things that matter
[43:52] if this is an opportunity that god
[43:53] presents and wants to provide
[43:55] then we shouldn't come up with a list of
[43:56] reasons why he shouldn't or a list of
[43:58] reasons why we don't or
[43:59] list of reasons why we can't
[44:03] i remember when we were trying to find a
[44:05] house to move here and start this church
[44:08] we couldn't find anything and so we had
[44:09] a budget we had a cap well when we
[44:11] couldn't find a place
[44:12] um find a house at that budget i said
[44:15] there's no budget
[44:16] search up to ten thousand dollars a
[44:18] month whatever it takes find a house if
[44:19] god wants me there he'll give me enough
[44:20] money to make rent
[44:22] and i found a house within our budget as
[44:23] soon as i did that but my attitude was i
[44:26] can't start
[44:26] keep putting god in a box and say it has
[44:28] to be this way it has to be that way
[44:30] lord you have to open a door i want to
[44:31] stop constraining you so lord if you're
[44:33] wanting me to live in
[44:34] something that's way way way be beyond
[44:36] my means then you're gonna have to give
[44:38] me the means to meet it
[44:40] and he would have given me the means
[44:42] before i accepted it because i don't
[44:43] know if that would have been real wise
[44:45] to sign a ten thousand dollar month
[44:47] lease they probably wouldn't have let me
[44:49] i mean let's just use some practical
[44:50] sense there
[44:51] but we were trying why because we didn't
[44:54] want to say no to something that god had
[44:55] for us
[44:56] but the subtlety of human reasoning has
[44:58] always been the stumbling block of faith
[45:01] but the mystery of jesus christ holds
[45:03] the treasures of all wisdom and
[45:05] knowledge
[45:06] what happened in the beginning is that
[45:08] god's word was swapped for wisdom
[45:10] and what's happened with man throughout
[45:12] all the ages as they swapped the wisdom
[45:14] of god they swapped the word of god
[45:16] for the man's wisdom and the culture of
[45:18] man they swap it for politics they swap
[45:20] it for pretest they swap it for
[45:21] for money for popularity
[45:26] but the mystery of jesus christ the word
[45:28] of god holds the treasures of all wisdom
[45:30] and knowledge
[45:33] brother branham preaches christ as the
[45:35] mystery god revealed in light of the
[45:37] fact that man has gone to the carnal
[45:39] side
[45:39] and even in religion has gone to the
[45:42] natural things
[45:43] and the culture of man and they've
[45:45] swapped out the wisdom of the word
[45:47] he said that's the reason the revelation
[45:48] of the seven seal mystery has to be
[45:50] unfolded
[45:52] it's it's not it's not some kind of
[45:54] theological event that the theologians
[45:56] can all
[45:56] excite each other about at a minister's
[45:58] meeting it's something that's so real
[46:00] and so practical
[46:02] the significance that the the coming of
[46:04] the lord had with
[46:05] dying for our sins and making a way that
[46:08] we could become redeemed sons and
[46:09] daughters of god
[46:10] god making himself known through his
[46:12] word and breaking the shackles of
[46:14] denominationalism and
[46:15] breaking the shackles and the chains of
[46:17] traditions and man's ideas
[46:19] is just a significant end that it takes
[46:21] the the potential of salvation
[46:23] and brings it to a fullness that he's no
[46:26] longer restrained the power of christ is
[46:28] no longer restrained by men's ideas and
[46:30] politics so we talk about the seven
[46:32] seals being open this isn't
[46:33] this isn't the book of revelation that's
[46:35] been very mysterious and probed at and
[46:37] misunderstood and everyone's trying to
[46:39] figure it out it's not it's not a
[46:41] chalkboard session
[46:42] it's something that becomes very real to
[46:44] the individual where christ
[46:46] is no longer fettered in your life the
[46:48] word is no longer restrained you can say
[46:50] god give me everything you want to give
[46:53] me
[46:53] knowing that you're living in a time
[46:55] where there's nothing holding it back
[46:59] first corinthians chapter two verses
[47:02] four to eight
[47:03] he says and and if you recall we've
[47:05] already read from
[47:07] chapter one he says in my speech and my
[47:10] preaching was not with enticing words
[47:12] so i'm not just using cute phrases and
[47:14] i'm not using convincing speech
[47:17] in man's wisdom and a premise that's
[47:19] false but presented in a way that
[47:21] convinces you
[47:22] i'm not doing that but i come my speech
[47:24] is in demonstration of the spirit and
[47:26] the power
[47:28] now the demonstration of the spirit and
[47:30] the power was in his speech and
[47:31] preaching
[47:33] his speech and preaching were not was
[47:35] not enticing words or were not enticing
[47:37] words
[47:38] but his speech and preaching were a
[47:40] demonstration of the spirit and power of
[47:42] god
[47:43] that your faith should not stand in the
[47:46] wisdom of man but in the power of god
[47:49] that's where our faith should stand in
[47:51] the power and wisdom of god
[47:53] christ who is the wisdom and the power
[47:55] of god how be it
[47:56] we speak wisdom so if the wisdom is not
[47:59] consigned to the world the world's got
[48:01] all the wisdom and we're all the fools
[48:02] no
[48:03] he speaks of wisdom we speak wisdom
[48:04] among them that are perfect
[48:06] yet not the wisdom of this world or the
[48:08] princes of this world that come to not
[48:10] but we speak the wisdom of god in a
[48:13] mystery
[48:14] even the hidden wisdom which god
[48:16] ordained before the world and to our
[48:18] glory
[48:19] the wisdom of god is a mystery the
[48:21] wisdom of god
[48:22] is hidden it's hidden from the wise and
[48:25] prudent of the world it's revealed unto
[48:26] babes
[48:27] it's not something that everyone can
[48:28] just look at and grasp and make use of
[48:31] but the real treasures and riches of the
[48:33] wisdom and knowledge of god
[48:34] are hid in christ and can be only known
[48:37] as god grants them and gives them
[48:39] paul demonstrates that even in this book
[48:41] as he writes and then
[48:42] also maybe in the second corinthians how
[48:44] that it's the spirit
[48:45] searcheth all things yea the deep things
[48:47] of god and we can know the things that
[48:49] are freely given by god
[48:51] through his spirit he wants to give unto
[48:53] us his wisdom
[48:55] though it's a mystery though it's hidden
[48:57] he wants to give it to us
[48:58] by his spirit it's a wisdom that's
[49:00] ordained before the foundational world
[49:03] for
[49:03] our glory this is a wisdom that's for
[49:06] our glory which none of the princes of
[49:08] this world knew what did they not know
[49:09] they didn't know that christ
[49:10] was the power and wisdom of god because
[49:13] they had they known
[49:14] christ and the power of wisdom that he
[49:16] held had they known what his purpose was
[49:17] they wouldn't
[49:18] they would not have crucified the lord
[49:20] of glory
[49:22] this wisdom that we're asking god for
[49:24] the the
[49:25] the wisdom that we desire the wisdom
[49:27] that we crave the wisdom that we need
[49:30] paul is saying there's a mystery the
[49:32] wisdom of god in a mystery the hidden
[49:34] wisdom
[49:35] which was in god before the world began
[49:38] this mystery was first deep in god's
[49:40] heart it was in the back part of god's
[49:42] mind
[49:43] it was his secret counsel it was his
[49:45] hidden purpose even as paul is saying
[49:47] it was so deep in god's mind that when
[49:49] he sent his son they had no idea that he
[49:51] was going to be a sacrifice
[49:53] there there wasn't people weren't
[49:55] sitting back going all right watch this
[49:56] watch this he's got
[49:57] he has to be baptized because sacrifices
[49:59] need to be cleansed now watch this he's
[50:01] going to be hated they're going to turn
[50:02] their backs on
[50:02] no one was reading the script knowing
[50:05] that he was going to have to be
[50:06] crucified
[50:07] and you really want the proof of it he's
[50:09] telling his disciples over and over
[50:11] again the son of man's gonna be
[50:12] persecuted and he's gonna have to die
[50:13] and he's gonna raise on the third day
[50:14] and they're like yeah whatever sorry
[50:18] jesus even saying ah you know peter even
[50:20] saying oh no you can't do this and he
[50:22] said
[50:22] you know satan get thee behind me he was
[50:24] telling them over and over again
[50:26] that this is what i've got to do this is
[50:27] what i've got to do and there's still
[50:29] even his own disciples weren't didn't
[50:31] have the knowledge of the hidden wisdom
[50:33] be like well wait a minute
[50:34] of course yeah that makes perfect sense
[50:36] that's what the bible says you're going
[50:37] to be
[50:38] like a lamb led to the slaughter that's
[50:40] the things that we know is going to
[50:41] happen
[50:42] that is not the reality of everyone then
[50:45] it was a hidden wisdom
[50:47] it was a hidden council and i that that
[50:50] should cause us to say lord
[50:52] in my own personal life if you can have
[50:54] a divine will and counsel that's hidden
[50:56] that causes people to act
[50:57] in a certain way against your will then
[50:59] lord give me an
[51:01] understanding of what your will is for
[51:03] my life so that i don't act
[51:05] in fighting against it peter without
[51:08] wisdom drew his sword
[51:09] to defend jesus christ
[51:12] but in defending jesus christ he was
[51:15] hindering prophecy
[51:18] he drew a sword in defense of christ we
[51:20] ought to defend jesus christ the name of
[51:22] jesus there's no other name
[51:23] given in earth under heaven whereby men
[51:26] can be saved
[51:26] and we draw our swords in defense of
[51:28] jesus christ to lift up jesus christ but
[51:30] then we begin to use the sword in such a
[51:32] way to fight against the very bride of
[51:34] jesus christ
[51:36] fight against the very word of jesus
[51:37] christ fight against the very prophecy
[51:39] of jesus christ
[51:40] in the time that you're living in and
[51:41] that's because you lack wisdom
[51:44] i say you all say me that's because we
[51:45] we lack wisdom when we do that
[51:47] and so this mystery is first hidden deep
[51:49] in god's heart it's a hidden council
[51:51] hidden purpose
[51:52] then it's hidden in christ who's the
[51:54] mystery of god
[51:56] and whom the revelation of all wisdom
[51:59] unfolds
[52:02] that's who you need the revelation of
[52:07] this was a statement i read about christ
[52:10] who is the treasure
[52:12] of all wisdom and knowledge and i
[52:14] believe it was a statement by the same
[52:16] priest who said that the subtlety of
[52:18] human reasonings has always been the
[52:19] stumbling block of faith
[52:21] hundreds of years ago he said jesus
[52:22] christ is a great book
[52:25] he can indeed he who can he who can
[52:28] indeed study him
[52:30] in the word of god will know all he
[52:32] ought to know
[52:34] humility opens this divine book faith
[52:36] reads in it
[52:37] love learns from it christ
[52:40] is a book he's sealed he's closed off
[52:44] he's unknown
[52:45] but humility can open that book faith
[52:48] can read that book
[52:49] love will learn from that book and if
[52:51] you study him you'll know all you need
[52:53] to know
[52:57] in proverbs chapter 2 verses 1 to 9.
[52:59] just think of how practical this
[53:01] is my son if thou will receive my words
[53:04] and hide my commandments with thee
[53:06] so that thou incline thy ear into wisdom
[53:08] and apply thy heart to understanding
[53:11] yea if thou criest after knowledge and
[53:14] lift us up thy voice for understanding
[53:16] if thou seekest her as silver in
[53:18] searches for her
[53:19] as for hid treasures i realize that when
[53:23] we read the proverbs in our minds we
[53:24] begin to picture cobblestones and
[53:26] stone castles and and chariots and maybe
[53:30] horse-drawn carts and different things
[53:33] and wearing leather sandals and wearing
[53:34] robes and
[53:36] and we just think about the wisdom of
[53:37] the of the other of the times past
[53:39] and maybe we're not just and maybe it
[53:41] just seems so far beyond this but this
[53:43] is very
[53:44] very practical what the proverbs is
[53:46] telling us
[53:48] that we ought to say we have to receive
[53:50] the word of god
[53:51] hide it in our hearts be more inclined
[53:53] to hear the wisdom of god be more
[53:55] inclined to spiritual things to
[53:57] apply our hearts not just to say that we
[53:59] believe it but to desire to understand
[54:01] it
[54:02] and cry for knowledge pray for
[54:03] revelation more than anything
[54:05] and seek her seek that as choice silver
[54:09] just as much as you would chase after a
[54:10] paycheck just as much as you chased
[54:12] after
[54:12] chase after a new contract or a new
[54:15] opportunity search for her as hid
[54:16] treasures
[54:17] then shalt thou understand the fear of
[54:19] the lord i hope that through even just
[54:22] the service this morning
[54:23] that this wisdom can become more
[54:25] practically within your grasp
[54:29] and find the knowledge of her thou thou
[54:32] shalt
[54:33] understand the fear of the lord and find
[54:34] the knowledge of god
[54:36] for the lord giveth wisdom how out of
[54:39] his mouth cometh knowledge and
[54:41] understanding
[54:42] the lord gives wisdom out of his mouth
[54:44] cometh knowledge and understanding he
[54:46] layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous
[54:48] he is a buckler to them that walk
[54:49] uprightly he keepeth the paths of
[54:51] judgment
[54:52] and preserveth the way of his saints
[54:54] then shalt thou
[54:55] understand righteousness and judgment
[54:57] and equity yea
[54:58] every good path this is this is the path
[55:03] to peace
[55:04] we get we get riled up a lot with
[55:06] inequities and things that are unfair
[55:08] but when you can come to a place of
[55:10] understanding righteousness
[55:12] judgment and equity then you're in a
[55:14] place of stability
[55:16] you're in a place to where when you see
[55:18] something that's inequitable you know
[55:19] one who can make it right
[55:21] when you see an injustice you can
[55:22] understand the reasons behind it
[55:25] then thou shalt understand righteousness
[55:27] and judgment equity yea
[55:29] every good path for the lord giveth
[55:33] wisdom
[55:34] out of his mouth cometh knowledge and
[55:35] understanding
[55:37] jesus when he was tempted in the
[55:38] wilderness of the devil who had not
[55:40] eaten bread for 40 days he said man
[55:42] shall not live by bread alone
[55:44] but by every word that proceedeth out of
[55:46] the mouth of god
[55:48] according from deuteronomy i believe 8 3
[55:50] saying man shall not live
[55:51] by bread alone but by but shall live by
[55:54] every word of god that proceeds out of
[55:55] his mouth
[55:56] it's telling us that the word of god is
[55:58] what comes out of his mouth
[56:00] the lord gives wisdom out of his mouth
[56:02] comes the word out of his mouth comes
[56:04] knowledge and understanding which you
[56:05] can live by
[56:06] you can take that to the bank that's
[56:09] something you can live by that's
[56:10] something you can count on that's
[56:11] something you can trust in
[56:13] you can live by the word that proceeds
[56:15] out of the mouth of god
[56:17] in second thessalonians chapter 2 verse
[56:19] 8 i want him to amplify this thought
[56:21] that wisdom comes out of his mouth the
[56:22] word comes out of his mouth knowledge
[56:24] and understanding comes out of his mouth
[56:26] then shall that wicked one be revealed
[56:28] the wicked one this antichrist
[56:30] this deceiver whom the lord shall
[56:32] consume with the spirit of his mouth
[56:35] what is it that comes out of his mouth
[56:37] the word of god its knowledge and
[56:39] understanding its wisdom it shall
[56:41] consume the wicked one
[56:42] and shall destroy with the brightness of
[56:44] his coming
[56:46] this speaks to the power that the word
[56:48] of god has over the deceiver
[56:51] regardless of where you would want to
[56:52] place this with respect to prophecy and
[56:54] when this is going to be fulfilled
[56:56] the power and potential of the word of
[56:58] god is yours right now
[56:59] to rebuke the devourer to overthrow the
[57:02] consumer
[57:03] and to stop satan and all his nasty
[57:05] tricks in any way that he would want to
[57:07] defile your understanding to cause you
[57:09] to doubt to weaken your faith or make a
[57:11] mistake
[57:12] because it's the word of god which comes
[57:14] out of his mouth that destroys the power
[57:16] of the wicked that exposes them the
[57:17] wicked is exposed
[57:19] the trail of the serpent is exposed his
[57:21] schemes are overthrown
[57:22] his nasty tricks are made known to us we
[57:25] realized oh by the word of god that came
[57:27] out of his mouth i can see
[57:29] that he's exposed in what he's trying to
[57:31] do i know that may seem to be super
[57:33] spiritual but i trust you can in your
[57:34] own life
[57:35] think of an instance where it's very
[57:36] practical
[57:38] very practical he destroys the powers of
[57:42] satan through his
[57:43] the brightness of his coming
[57:46] in christ is the mystery god revealed it
[57:49] says god's great secret of his
[57:50] revelation
[57:52] this great light of revelation has
[57:54] always blinded the wisdom of this world
[57:56] the revelation of jesus christ exposes
[57:59] false wisdom
[58:00] the revelation of jesus christ is the
[58:02] light the brightness of his coming it's
[58:04] what exposes any false path
[58:06] it's what's going to make you aware of
[58:08] anything that has a negative influence
[58:10] anything that can be harmful
[58:11] or destructive god's great secret has

[1:00:48] retirement
[1:00:49] and he was sharing with me we were just
[1:00:50] fellowshipping on certain things he said
[1:00:52] it was expressing just how this mind of
[1:00:54] god this wisdom of god is not something
[1:00:56] you're trying to pull out of heaven
[1:00:57] but the wisdom from above has been
[1:00:59] brought down into our hearts we have it
[1:01:01] it's something that when we're asking
[1:01:03] god for we're asking for the release of
[1:01:05] it in our lives
[1:01:08] don't think of it as something that's
[1:01:09] foreign to you but think of it says
[1:01:11] something that you're a part of
[1:01:12] a network you've been passed into
[1:01:14] something that you're you're
[1:01:15] one with that you could say oh god this
[1:01:19] mystery your secrets your desire what's
[1:01:21] pleasing to you
[1:01:22] what means something to you lord it's in
[1:01:24] my heart there's illumination
[1:01:27] what is it fulfills ephesians 1 17
[1:01:30] the spirit of wisdom and the revelation
[1:01:31] of knowledge of him it fulfills even
[1:01:34] paul saying you know
[1:01:35] when that which is perfect is come then
[1:01:37] that which is in part shall be done away
[1:01:38] with
[1:01:39] i'll behold him as in a glass i'll see
[1:01:41] him i'll know this is what we have
[1:01:43] the benefit of of being born by the word
[1:01:45] of god and growing in his graves
[1:01:48] it's the spirit of the lord's mouth that
[1:01:50] destroys the powers of deception
[1:01:53] it's the spirit of the lord's mouth that
[1:01:54] destroys reasoning
[1:01:57] what is it it's the word
[1:02:01] revelations chapter 1 verse 16
[1:02:05] speaking of christ this one who stood
[1:02:06] standing in the midst of those golden
[1:02:08] candle sticks he had in his right hand
[1:02:10] seven stars
[1:02:11] and out of his mouth went a sharp
[1:02:13] two-edged sword
[1:02:15] and his countenance was as the sun
[1:02:17] shineth in his strength
[1:02:19] this is what is in the midst of the
[1:02:21] bride now this is what in the midst of
[1:02:22] the believers now this is what's
[1:02:23] available to us now
[1:02:25] it says and his face was shining as the
[1:02:27] sun and its strength
[1:02:28] what is that that's the brightness of
[1:02:30] his countenance that overthrows the
[1:02:33] wisdom and knowledge
[1:02:34] of this world it's the brightness of
[1:02:36] this presence that contrasts
[1:02:38] and exposes the false light of satan who
[1:02:41] appears as an angel of light
[1:02:43] i it's it's in my consciousness so i
[1:02:46] just feel impressed to say it
[1:02:47] i know there's a way that the bible can
[1:02:49] be preached and the word can be preached
[1:02:51] to recreate this mysterious
[1:02:54] super-religious superstitious battle
[1:02:56] between right and wrong
[1:02:58] and though there are evil forces at work
[1:03:01] and there's a the force of faith at work
[1:03:04] we don't need to try to make it into
[1:03:05] some sort of dungeons and dragons
[1:03:07] scenario out there or some sort of
[1:03:09] conspiracy
[1:03:10] this is a reality in just our everyday
[1:03:13] life
[1:03:13] we want to do the things that are
[1:03:15] pleasing to god and we have a devil
[1:03:17] that's just sitting there going
[1:03:20] just pushing at us just needling us just
[1:03:22] kind of trying to get us to
[1:03:24] to stop and to turn and to look and so
[1:03:26] we want god the brightness of his coming
[1:03:27] the power of his word to expose
[1:03:29] all these voices all these ideas even
[1:03:31] the ticking time bomb
[1:03:32] bombs that have been sewn into us by our
[1:03:34] past that harness we think back of this
[1:03:37] situation that situation this
[1:03:38] circumstance the abuse the decision
[1:03:40] whatever it might be and we're always
[1:03:41] just kind of looking back
[1:03:42] we need the lord to come and just blast
[1:03:45] through us by his presence in such a way
[1:03:46] to tear down those things
[1:03:50] to expose him
[1:03:54] out of his mouth when a sharp two-edged
[1:03:56] sword
[1:03:58] hebrews 4 12 for the word of god is
[1:04:00] quick and powerful and sharper
[1:04:02] than any two-edged sword piercing even
[1:04:05] the dividing asunder of soul and spirit
[1:04:08] and of the joints and marrow and is a
[1:04:10] discerner
[1:04:11] of the thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:04:14] what is he discussing
[1:04:15] what is he presenting
[1:04:18] failure to enter into his rest that's
[1:04:21] what he's talking about
[1:04:23] someone failing to enter into rest what
[1:04:25] is faith anchored in
[1:04:27] what is this word i'm hearing what does
[1:04:28] it need to be mixed with it needs to be
[1:04:30] mixed with faith
[1:04:31] faith and the word coming together then
[1:04:33] we have this confidence this boldness
[1:04:35] that this sharp sword that goes out of
[1:04:37] his mouth is the word of god
[1:04:40] the word of god is the wisdom of god is
[1:04:42] the knowledge of god it is understanding
[1:04:44] it is
[1:04:45] it is what goes out of his mouth and
[1:04:47] will destroy
[1:04:48] any conspiracy against you any weakness
[1:04:51] that's been sewn into your flesh
[1:04:53] any affection that you have in your
[1:04:55] spirit
[1:04:56] that drives you to things that you know
[1:04:59] displease the lord
[1:05:01] the word of god is quick and powerful
[1:05:03] sharper than any two-edged sword
[1:05:05] it is out of his mouth goes a two-edged
[1:05:07] sword it's the sharpest two-edged sword
[1:05:08] there is
[1:05:09] that divides between soul spirit and
[1:05:11] body the joints and marrow and is a
[1:05:12] discerner
[1:05:14] of the thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:05:17] it says the word is quick that means
[1:05:19] it's alive it's living it has vital
[1:05:21] power the word
[1:05:22] is alive it says it's a powerful it's
[1:05:24] effectual
[1:05:25] it's active it's quick it's living and
[1:05:27] it's active
[1:05:29] i was looking at a an app the other day
[1:05:31] to count calories
[1:05:33] and it wanted to know a little bit about
[1:05:35] yourself so i'm six
[1:05:36] to 175 pounds and i wanted to know
[1:05:39] what my lifestyle was and one of them
[1:05:41] was sedentary and i was like well that
[1:05:43] that is it you know you know i get up
[1:05:46] and my
[1:05:46] my office is in my bedroom right so my
[1:05:49] commute is i should count the steps i'm
[1:05:51] pretty sure it's seven
[1:05:52] glory and i and i sit down and i work
[1:05:54] all week and then i
[1:05:55] seven steps on a saturday and i study
[1:05:58] all and so i don't do a lot of exercise
[1:06:01] unless i walk to the kitchen to get some
[1:06:02] water and then my steps are
[1:06:04] let's see three times seven twenty one
[1:06:07] and uh it's always like there's this
[1:06:09] that we could be living but not very
[1:06:10] active that's my that was my whole point
[1:06:13] by my google play app search and signing
[1:06:16] up
[1:06:17] is we could be living and breathing but
[1:06:19] not active
[1:06:20] and the bible does not just say the word
[1:06:22] is quick which is living
[1:06:24] and has power but it's also powerful
[1:06:26] that means it's active
[1:06:29] energetically efficacious for those who
[1:06:32] are learning fancy words
[1:06:33] that's exactly what it is it's energetic
[1:06:35] and it's efficacious it's effective
[1:06:37] it works it does its thing
[1:06:40] it works just as wisdom works the word
[1:06:43] works why
[1:06:43] because the word is the wisdom of god in
[1:06:46] isaiah chapter 55 verses verse 11
[1:06:49] it says so shall my word that goeth
[1:06:51] forth out of my mouth
[1:06:52] it shall not return unto me void it
[1:06:54] shall accomplish that which i please
[1:06:56] and it shall prosper in the thing where
[1:06:58] to i sent it if god
[1:07:00] ever speaks to you through the word you
[1:07:01] can take it to the bank
[1:07:04] if you ever get the revelation that by
[1:07:05] his stripes i am healed
[1:07:07] just bank on it rest in it don't fret
[1:07:09] don't worry about the
[1:07:10] the what they what they prescribe you
[1:07:13] don't worry about what the doctor says
[1:07:14] if it's ever revealed to you
[1:07:16] then you rest in that and say i know
[1:07:18] what god said
[1:07:20] the word that goes out of his mouth it
[1:07:22] is the word which is his wisdom
[1:07:23] i the lord will give wisdom out of my
[1:07:25] mouth comes knowledge and understanding
[1:07:27] the word that goes out of my mouth it
[1:07:29] will it is effective
[1:07:30] it is energetically efficacious it has
[1:07:32] vital power it works it'll do what it's
[1:07:34] supposed to do
[1:07:35] because it will not come back to me
[1:07:38] until it's done what i sent it out for
[1:07:41] if i speak my word to give my believer
[1:07:43] peace it's not going to come back
[1:07:44] without them having peace
[1:07:46] if i speak my word to give somebody
[1:07:47] deliverance it will not come back to me
[1:07:49] without giving deliverance
[1:07:50] if i speak my word to bring rapture
[1:07:52] power it's not going to reverberate back
[1:07:54] to me
[1:07:54] unless it has come to rapturing power
[1:08:00] it will accomplish that which i please
[1:08:01] it shall prosper it will be successful
[1:08:04] in the person to whom i sent it
[1:08:08] no abundance of words can ever ever ever
[1:08:11] overestimate the power and might of the
[1:08:13] word of god
[1:08:15] there's no amount of words can ever
[1:08:18] ever overestimate the power of it
[1:08:21] acts chapter 12 verse 24 but the word of
[1:08:23] god grew and multiply
[1:08:25] you want to write another book of acts
[1:08:27] then the word of god needs to grow and
[1:08:29] multiply
[1:08:30] that's the real book of acts the word of
[1:08:33] god growing and multiplied became more
[1:08:35] successful
[1:08:36] and i love the context for these two
[1:08:37] verses both in chapter 12 and chapter
[1:08:39] 19.
[1:08:40] it's used in relationship to all the
[1:08:43] attempts to fight it
[1:08:46] all the sermons preached against it all
[1:08:48] the conspiracies to overthrow it all the
[1:08:50] lies that were spread about it
[1:08:51] the word of god grew and multiplied
[1:08:54] the believers just lived above it and
[1:08:56] got beneath those that needed it
[1:08:58] they just kept living their lives they
[1:09:00] kept going forward and the more that the
[1:09:01] devil fought against it the more the
[1:09:03] devil railed the more the foolishness
[1:09:04] was spouted off about it the more lines
[1:09:06] they were told about the more the word
[1:09:07] grew and multiply why they were fighting
[1:09:09] the word
[1:09:12] and the the effort against the church
[1:09:14] the effort to fight the believers the
[1:09:16] effort to lie about them and malign them
[1:09:18] and tear them down
[1:09:18] only made it stronger
[1:09:23] the word of god grew and multiply why is
[1:09:25] quick and powerful can't be stopped
[1:09:28] acts 19 20 so mightily grew the word of
[1:09:31] god
[1:09:31] and prevailed it becomes more successful
[1:09:33] despite everyone's else's efforts to
[1:09:35] stop it
[1:09:37] now our efforts will fail but the word
[1:09:40] will never fail
[1:09:41] i can make all sorts of promises i can
[1:09:43] make all sorts of commitments and i can
[1:09:45] i can say i can do this and i give you
[1:09:46] my word and that can fail
[1:09:49] and i can say hey look i give you my
[1:09:51] word i'm going to wash your car today
[1:09:53] and someone said well i want to make
[1:09:54] aaron a liar so they just kidnapped me
[1:09:56] right
[1:09:56] throw me in the back of a car and hey
[1:09:58] i'm sorry i couldn't wash your car
[1:09:59] somebody kidnapped me
[1:10:01] but nobody can conspire to keep the word
[1:10:03] from being fulfilled
[1:10:05] it's gonna happen it's gonna happen says
[1:10:08] lord
[1:10:08] i want it to happen i want it to happen
[1:10:11] lord
[1:10:12] i give myself to it a yield to it let
[1:10:15] the word of god grow mightily
[1:10:17] and prevail in my life let it prevail
[1:10:21] the word of god is quick and powerful
[1:10:23] and sharper
[1:10:24] than any two-edged sword it's the word
[1:10:26] that comes out of his mouth it's how god
[1:10:28] gives wisdom
[1:10:29] and he says and is a discerner this word
[1:10:31] discerner relates to judgment
[1:10:34] it's kritikos relates to some being fit
[1:10:37] for judging it's skilled in judging
[1:10:39] it comes from the word critis which
[1:10:41] means judge the word is the one that
[1:10:43] passes judgment
[1:10:45] the word is the one that passes and
[1:10:47] assess or arbitrates or administers
[1:10:48] justice
[1:10:49] in everything what does the word say
[1:10:54] when you could come to the place where
[1:10:55] you absolutely believe that whatever god
[1:10:58] says is true and whatever god does is
[1:11:00] just you'll find a greater level of
[1:11:02] contentment and peace in your life
[1:11:05] you're no longer going to be the place
[1:11:06] where you're shaking your fist at god
[1:11:07] because you realize whatever he says is
[1:11:09] true whatever he does is just
[1:11:11] and that's why we worship him because
[1:11:13] there's no one else like that
[1:11:15] we worship him because he is god we
[1:11:17] worship him because he is just well is
[1:11:19] it just that i lost my job if that's
[1:11:21] what god wants
[1:11:22] it's justice is it just that the word
[1:11:24] says this if god said it it's true
[1:11:26] we worship him because he's god we
[1:11:28] praise him because he's god we praise
[1:11:30] him because he's the one true god
[1:11:32] not because he just loves me if he
[1:11:33] didn't love me i'd still worship him as
[1:11:35] god
[1:11:36] i knew for a fact and he told me aaron i
[1:11:39] hate you then i would worship him in the
[1:11:40] truth that he hates me
[1:11:42] because he's worthy of it because he's
[1:11:43] god
[1:11:47] cretaceous the judge the one who passes
[1:11:50] judgment on everything
[1:11:51] anything the word is a discerner the
[1:11:54] word is the judge
[1:11:55] the word is what determines what is just
[1:11:58] the word is what determines what is
[1:11:59] right
[1:12:01] in a trial the judge is a fact-finder
[1:12:03] and it's when there's not a jury the
[1:12:04] jury is a fact-finder in a jury trial
[1:12:07] they're the ones that determine
[1:12:09] the facts upon which a decision is going
[1:12:11] to be made
[1:12:12] they're the ones that determine whether
[1:12:14] they believe a witness is telling the
[1:12:16] truth
[1:12:16] they're the ones that conclude that this
[1:12:18] has been properly admitted or that this
[1:12:20] has been admitted it's been allowed we
[1:12:21] look at it and we take this as a
[1:12:22] they're the fact finder in being the
[1:12:24] fact finder the jury or the judge
[1:12:26] they're the ones that make the decision
[1:12:27] the word is the jury
[1:12:29] the word is the judge there's no other
[1:12:32] authority there's no higher power
[1:12:34] than god's word
[1:12:38] i don't say that too i i
[1:12:41] i say that maybe with some force but not
[1:12:43] to be arrogant with it
[1:12:45] it's the it's the reality that we
[1:12:47] believe this bible to be god's word
[1:12:50] we believe the word to be true in god we
[1:12:53] trust everyone else bring data
[1:12:56] because we take god at his word we
[1:12:58] believe in god we trust god
[1:13:00] in the church age book brother branham's
[1:13:02] writing in the smyrna and church age
[1:13:03] he's writing about
[1:13:05] the new birth now and and he's teaching
[1:13:07] it very plainly very clearly
[1:13:09] that the new birth to be born again is
[1:13:11] to be baptized
[1:13:12] to be baptized with the holy ghost to be
[1:13:14] born by the spirit of god
[1:13:16] and he's explaining how that he believes
[1:13:18] the new birth is the baptism of the holy
[1:13:19] ghost but my pentecostal brethren
[1:13:21] have taken the the birth and they've
[1:13:23] divided it and they said the ones your
[1:13:25] birth and the other ones when the holy
[1:13:26] spirit comes
[1:13:27] and even and brother branham is trying
[1:13:28] to explain why this is not true and he's
[1:13:31] very very deliberate
[1:13:32] very very plain in the church age book
[1:13:34] and so he makes this statement
[1:13:35] what has caused this misunderstanding
[1:13:39] what's caused this misunderstanding on
[1:13:41] the word of god he says the answer is
[1:13:42] experience and he makes this statement
[1:13:46] we have gone by experience and not the
[1:13:48] word way
[1:13:49] away with experience as your measuring
[1:13:52] line
[1:13:53] there's only one plumb line only one rod
[1:13:56] and that
[1:13:57] is the word
[1:14:00] plumb line that means you're measuring
[1:14:01] something right and you're going to use
[1:14:03] a plumb line if you're trying to square
[1:14:04] something up
[1:14:06] want to make sure it's true use a plumb
[1:14:08] line and build in a wall or
[1:14:09] turn in a corner do something you want
[1:14:11] to make sure it's lining up make sure
[1:14:12] the foundation is straight
[1:14:13] and so it's something that's useful it's
[1:14:16] something that's practical
[1:14:17] and he makes this dichotomy between
[1:14:19] feelings experience
[1:14:23] and what the word says and we run up
[1:14:26] against this a lot in our lives and we
[1:14:27] need to have the wisdom to know when
[1:14:28] something's anecdotal and when
[1:14:30] something's true
[1:14:32] and somebody else's experience can be
[1:14:34] true for them but it's anecdotal for you
[1:14:36] it does not create any kind of principle
[1:14:38] doesn't create some sort of truth does
[1:14:39] not establish some sort of rule
[1:14:43] because there's a lot of people with
[1:14:44] their experiences and their testimonies
[1:14:46] and their dreams and their visions and
[1:14:47] their
[1:14:48] choices and their lifestyle can express
[1:14:50] a lot of things that have done a lot of
[1:14:52] good for you
[1:14:52] but what you need for you is what's best
[1:14:55] for you
[1:14:56] and even all those other things and we
[1:14:58] could take a lot of anecdotal evidence
[1:14:59] to build a case that i want to try this
[1:15:01] and i want to do this
[1:15:02] to where it doesn't relate to faith but
[1:15:03] when it comes to the things of god
[1:15:05] away with experience away with man's
[1:15:08] opinions
[1:15:08] away with all those feelings and
[1:15:10] emotions and back
[1:15:12] to the word wisdom is not how you feel
[1:15:15] it's what you know
[1:15:18] and if you're feeling a little bit of a
[1:15:20] certain way and you're feeling a lean in
[1:15:21] a particular way
[1:15:22] make sure you can get to the place where
[1:15:23] it anchors and you know this is what god
[1:15:25] says
[1:15:27] what does wisdom look like it's the word
[1:15:30] in action
[1:15:32] the living word the word living and an
[1:15:35] action in a bible bride
[1:15:39] this is the scripture that has been in
[1:15:41] my notes for every single sermon for the
[1:15:42] last four or five sermons
[1:15:44] and i haven't been able to get to it
[1:15:45] james chapter 3
[1:15:48] verse 13 who is a wise man
[1:15:52] and endued with knowledge among you let
[1:15:54] him show
[1:15:56] who's wise who's the scribe
[1:15:59] who's the wise
[1:16:02] let him show out of a good conversation
[1:16:05] his works
[1:16:06] with meekness of wisdom the wise one can
[1:16:10] show it
[1:16:10] he's not the wise guy you know the smart
[1:16:12] aleck but the
[1:16:14] who's the one that's wise and has wisdom
[1:16:16] let them show it
[1:16:17] out of a good a life lived well
[1:16:21] a good conversation of a good
[1:16:23] conversation his works with
[1:16:24] and i love this the meekness of wisdom
[1:16:28] wisdoms meek wisdom has a particular
[1:16:31] temperament
[1:16:32] wisdom has a particular fruit covering
[1:16:36] that makes the that it becomes
[1:16:37] attractive so the seed
[1:16:39] finds the place where it belongs
[1:16:42] you realize that even with fruit the
[1:16:44] flat the fruit is the flesh that
[1:16:46] surrounds the seed
[1:16:49] and that the fruit is made inviting and
[1:16:52] the flower the flesh is made inviting
[1:16:54] and made in a certain way so that it can
[1:16:56] be picked
[1:16:58] so that the seed can find good ground
[1:17:03] and to reproduce the fruit it's the seed
[1:17:06] in the end that matters
[1:17:08] because the fruit itself having seed
[1:17:10] it's made this way so that it's carried
[1:17:12] off and finds good ground
[1:17:13] and perpetuates itself and so the wisdom
[1:17:16] becomes the fruit
[1:17:17] around the seed the meekness of wisdom
[1:17:20] is the drawing power
[1:17:21] is what the proof of the pudding that's
[1:17:23] when you know it's wisdom
[1:17:25] is when you see christ in it
[1:17:28] you show out of a life lived well the
[1:17:31] meekness
[1:17:32] of wisdom brother branham says
[1:17:35] the word of truth was the criterion then
[1:17:37] this is he's writing down the pergaming
[1:17:38] church ages is in the
[1:17:40] church age book there isn't another
[1:17:42] standard there isn't another plumb line
[1:17:44] as the world is going to be judged by
[1:17:46] one christ jesus
[1:17:47] even so it's going to be judged by the
[1:17:49] word if a man wants to know how he's
[1:17:51] making out
[1:17:52] let him do as james suggested look into
[1:17:55] the mirror
[1:17:56] of god's word that's the only way you'll
[1:17:58] know if you're overcoming
[1:18:00] it's the only way you're going to know
[1:18:00] if it's wisdom is when you first
[1:18:03] look to the word of god and then you're
[1:18:05] honest come boldly before the throne of
[1:18:07] grace to check what
[1:18:08] your motive and objective we check the
[1:18:11] word
[1:18:11] we check our motive and objective what
[1:18:13] is that going to take it's going to take
[1:18:14] some meekness
[1:18:15] real wisdom and grace to navigate that
[1:18:18] we'll invite the musicians to come as we
[1:18:24] close
[1:18:26] the word is the criterion there is not
[1:18:29] another standard there is not another

[1:18:42] chances are you'll see that you're doing
[1:18:44] good
[1:18:45] and if you see any area where you're not
