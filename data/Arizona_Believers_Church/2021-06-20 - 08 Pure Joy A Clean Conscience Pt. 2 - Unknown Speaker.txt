TRANSCRIPT
========================================
first corinthians chapter 8 verses 7 to 13 how be it there is not in every man that knowledge for some with conscience of the idol and to this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol and their conscience being weak is defiled but meat commendeth us not to god for neither if we eat or we or are we the better neither if we eat not are we the worse but take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to them that are weak for if any man see thee which has knowledge sit at meat in it the idol's temple shall not the conscious of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered two idols and through thine knowledge shall the weak brother perish for whom christ died but when you sin so against the brethren and wound their weak conscience ye sin against christ wherefore if meat make my brother to offend i will eat no flesh while the world standeth lest i make my brother to offend amen you can be seated my title today is not too vegan or not to vegan my title is continuing on the subject of pure joy and in particular a clean conscience and we're going to be drawing quite a bit just from this particular passage here and we welcome all the visitors that are with us today it's so nice to see the house of the lord full and we trust that the lord would be your portion just uh i'll just cover a few things at the outset um that a review picking up from some the prior services we're looking at this statement in the church age book where brother branham says our spirit is clean it is fresh it is real it is sober and serious but nonetheless full of the joy of the lord the christian ought to be just as exuberant and full of his pleasure in the lord as the world is when it savors and delights in its pleasures now that's quite a standard when you think of just how zealous the world can be for worldly things and the passion that is exhibited for air and the passion that is exhibited for unrighteousness uh ours ought to at least match if not exceed the zeal and enthusiasm for error ours for truth our zeal for truth ought to exceed that both christians and the world are human the worldly perhaps may be a way to think about it both christians and the worldly are human both have emotions the difference is the christians hearts and emotions are purely on the lord of glory and his love while the world satisfies the flesh and so the joy that we're talking about is not a joy that we could derive from focusing on the flesh or even being able to meet all the needs of our flesh and and provide things related to pleasure and provision and our flesh being clothed that's not the joy of the lord and one thing that we're identifying is that if a christian does not experience joy this is a state of mind not the state of the soul if you're sealed by the holy ghost then then that's permanent the seal of god cannot cannot fail so if you're not experiencing joy what the devil would want to do is take this disconcerting emotion or just a lack of uh maybe emotional uh balance and try to play just thinking well you're not a christian or not much of a christian how could you be a daughter of god and stress out and how could you be so worried and how could be plagued with anxiety to the point of physical problems if you really had faith and so the devil targets us in that area and i'm wanting just to emphasize this if there's any lack of joy in our lives as a christian that's a state of mind not the state of the soul and as soon as you can kind of take that weapon away from the devil then it's going to help you to achieve the experience of joy and drive away that sadness much more easily and so we looked at how our hearts or minds hearts and minds i like to use them as synonymous and then refer to the soul as the soul and um but there's different ways that we can use semantics a little bit differently but our hearts this bible says can condemn us and if our hearts condemn us that'll keep us from fully walking in god's love for us because the condemned heart it creates this fear towards god and the threat of punishment and well i i know that i love him and i want to be his child but he's mad at me or he's going to withhold blessings from me or maybe i've sinned past the day of grace and maybe i've crossed the line and there's all sorts of fear that tries to come in or well i know i'm his daughter or no i'm his son but you know i've probably lost all my rights and privileges that's just how the heart can work against us and then we're reluctant we're reluctant to walk fully in god's love for us and so as we're looking at this subject of a clean conscience this is a mind at peace despite any emotional pain this is a heart that is at rest despite any any other feelings or emotions that we might say are negative and a component of this clean conscience is a conscience that is clean has no is uh does not have guilt hovering hovering over it to have a a free conscience or clean conscience or a clear conscience means i know that my sins have been forgiven i'm not under the threat of punishment and with that being released from guilt i'm released from condemnation so a clean a clean conscience is one that could say yeah i know you reap what you sow and i know that maybe i'm sad right now i know this is a difficult situation and my nerves seem to be a little bit on edge but i know in my heart i know my standing with god i know that he's gonna see me through and that's that's a part of our human makeup that once it can be just clear with god and connected with that power of god that's in our souls then that has the ability to take anything else and bring it into harmony and so it's uh um it's a it's a lie it's not the absence of sadness that but it's this uh this pure joy within our souls that connects with our conscience that begins to help us to override anything negative that would bring us down so conscience as we're using this phrase conscience is the faculty of knowing what is right and if you have a conscience it's an awareness that whether or not our conduct aligns with or agrees with what we believe so you can have a belief of something that it's wrong to do this and then if you do it your conscience tells you you shouldn't have done that or as you go to do it your conscience is telling you don't do that you know that it's wrong or you know there's a particular outcome if that happens or there's a consequence and your conscience says oh buddy don't do it you know you know you know better and you kind of go against your conscience then when you're done it's that conscience that gives you the feeling of guilt and so that's that's our conscience so it causes us to feel guilt when we've done wrong but it actually commends us when we've done good something in your heart pricks you says that's the right thing to do when you do it it's your conscience that kind of says attaboy you did a good job way to go so that's it works in both ways and so conscience now as we've done this is kind of review from last sunday it's different from consciousness so conscience but this is different from being conscious and conscious uh consciousness relates to our feelings our perception in the awareness of the things around us things that we can identify through sense and so our consciousness is our ability to live and it just allows us to live in the world that's around us and well i know that there's there's a door here there's light there's things around me that's that's what my consciousness do it does but my conscience our conscience is our ability to live as we should in the world that we're aware of our kind so there's a there's a there's a consciousness of the situation there's a consciousness of the circumstances but then our conscience allows us to live as we should be or live as we really are called to be in the in the situation that we're in it would even be the appropriate response for the circumstance conscience allows us to do the thing that would be right based upon the situation that we're facing and because if you if you don't have a consciousness then then really you could do something but oh you were not aware of what was happening you should have that that was not the right thing to do uh because you just weren't aware of a particular situation there's some people in my life i've defended people say man they're mean and they're rude and they're insensitive and i've said no they're just clueless because if they knew if if they knew then they wouldn't have done that and so are to have a conscience is together with this to be conscious of things allows us to do the right thing and one thing that we uh even on wednesday nights uh it's it's been kind of emphasizing this area a laodicea is conscious right she's woke right at a girl she's woke but it's lost any moral conscience to know what to do with her wokeness okay yeah oh that's awful that's horrible what do we do with it what would be the right response what's going to bring a remedy how are we how are we going to choose the right thing to do and without a moral conscience then you cannot properly do good and so this is those are some of the themes from the last time now if you'll turn to matthew chapter 22 37 i'd like to begin to look at a particular aspect of our our human makeup as it's outlined in the scripture and in doing so um you just kind of lead to the something that's just a real real thrust in my heart about a clean conscience jesus said unto him thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart with all thy soul and with all thy mind now this is jesus now provoking him to love god with all his heart and to love him with all his soul and to love with him love him with all his mind well it suggests that there is some ability in each one of these areas to love to have to have an affection and in the in the greek heart is cardia and it actually kind of is almost referring to the physical heart the the soul is is suke and the mind is dionya and so there's a different words that are used for each one of these different aspects heart soul and mind and what i'm wanting is just to begin to think about these are three different things within the individual person these are three different things now let me say this emotions and feelings are not without consequence so jesus is saying love the lord thy god with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy mind so you say well i love god with my soul and that's that's the part that's redeemed and born again i love him with my soul but then it says you should also do it with all your heart and all your mind so this is this is a unique commandment this is a unique demand and so it it begins to help us to understand and although many other scriptures do as well that emotions and we understand emotions and feelings are not without consequence we realize that our emotions that how we feel when we do something actually characterizes what we're doing that if you're angry when you do something the act in itself may not not be one that is of of anger but if you do something in anger you can actually sow frustration or so anger in your action and the way that we're feeling at a particular moment when we experience something can actually color our memory of that particular activity for the rest of our lives if you if you're really anxious one time and really bound or having a panic attack in a particular area and then you you go on and years later you find yourself right in the same place again just geographically and also in your heart starts racing you start getting really nervous why because the feelings and emotions that we have have consequences and what we'll begin to identify is they're not beyond god's concern they're not beyond god's care he doesn't just ask us to love him within the soul but he says your heart and your mind so these elements of these aspects of our person are not beyond the purview of the word the word looks at them it addresses them and is concerned about them so god commands us to love him with all of our minds this is a faculty of understanding this is this speaks of our feelings this is actually our desires this would relate to the human spirit to love him within that realm paul writes in first thessalonians chapter 5 verse 23 and the very god of peace sanctify you wholly this is so it's a complete sanctification of your person and i pray god your whole spirit and soul and body so let's say the entirety of your spirit the entirety of your soul the entirety of your body i pray that your whole person spirit body and soul would be preserved blameless a blameless body a blameless spirit a blameless soul this is a this is a lofty prayer but let's just think for a moment this was the prayer of apostle paul this speaks to the heart of god who would desire that your spirit be preserved blameless desire that your bodies would be made whole unto the coming of our lord jesus christ so the there's the word spirit pneuma with in the greek it speaks of the spirit the suke again is the soul the body the greek word is soma i just use those not to impress you with my ability to click a link and find out what the greek is but rather to just identify that these are particular things with a different word and it's identifying separate parts of our one being it's separating you as a person into three components a soul a spirit and a body as it says in hebrews chapter 4 verse 12 for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to this is what the word can do now divide between divine asunder of soul so the word can make a difference and a distinction between the soul and spirit and in doing so the word knows how to address the soul for its benefit and it also knows how to address the spirit for its benefit because no no you don't you got to do this this way you got to do this that way it causes me to think about when you're when you smoke the brisket which we we do that right here i often hear the phrase my dad's a smoker and i have to quickly say of meats i'm a smoker of meats without paper i do it on a smoker and when you and brother maybe brother travis is just itching to get here and set me straight but when you when you smoke a brisket when it's all done you go to cutting it you need to find the right way to cut it you're going to be on the point there's a particular way you're cutting it because you want to cut it across the grain and that's going to yield a more tendency these are the things you learn in church i'm telling you they pay dividends and it's going to allow that brisket to taste but then you're going to get to a certain point no pun intended where you're going to have to flip that thing around and cut it a different way because if you keep cutting it that way it's not going to yield the same result and so the word of god is a sharp knife and knows this is how you treat the soul this is how you treat the spirit that the same word the same knife has a way of treating different parts of our being for the benefit and the wholeness and the completion of these parts of our bodies so it divides asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and morrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart so we have now soul spirit and then even a reference to joints and marrow so you have body spirit soul all within one person the body now these are things that i know you're um you you understand these things but i'm wanting just to bring them into the picture as we view it and paint it today the body has five senses and we would see taste smell touch and hear and these would be the five senses of the natural body that help us to understand the natural world around us in terms of spatial dimension and smells and sight and feelings and those things the physical part but then as the bible says it divides us under of the spirit and paul's writing saying that you be your whole spirit be preserved blameless the spirit which is your mind we know that that's a separate entity from your fingers that touch your ears that hear your eyes that see your nose that smells this is a different sense and in that spirit there's different channels or different senses of imagination memory reason affection and conscience these are five and these are this is just a way you can say oh there's more there's more well absolutely there's probably a way that you could begin to break these things and divide these things up to describe more completely the body and the spirit but these are just ways to quickly grasp and understand that there's ways that our physical body contacts things and knows that they're there i can see something i know that it's there i touch something i know that it's there i smell something i know that it's there these are different ways i taste something i know what it is even if i have my eyes closed and can't smell it so these are different ways to contact physical things and then within our spirits we know that even though we don't see something we can imagine it and even though that we and and we may not be touching something but we can have an affection for it and so there's different aspects to our spirits of imagination memory reason affection and also within this mind or spirit there's a conscience this is just the human person that we're talking about and we could call these things channels so it's something that passes through this and another way of thinking about it's a chamber within our spirits there's chambers so there's things that are stored there's things that can be recalled in our imagination and our our memory and our affection and our reason and then deep down on the inside of the inside is if you even took the temple of the outer court the inner court and the holiest of holies you could see kind of this blueprint of the person body spirit soul so in the soul that's the holiest of holies that is uh within the deepest part of the man and it is the nature of the spirit so before you're born again you can say that in there wrestles doubt in faith you got a dove seed and you've got a serpent nature and what the baptism of the holy ghost does the new birth kills out the any unbelief and seals the soul with a dove nature way down within your soul now i guess in some ways it would be really really nice if all sudden bodies gone spirits gone and all we become is soul beings and kind of existed in this soul realm and that's kind of how oh you made it welcome soul brother and uh and you're all you're happy but there's your soul is born again and sealed but you still got this spirit that remembers things you still have a body that gets sick and achy and this is what the scripture is identifying but within that soul there is that which is the nature of our spirit when you're born again then there's a nature of christ that lives on the inside of you and then the only sense for that is faith and it only feeds on the word so when your soul is born again it has one sense faith and the only thing that can feed that is the word but in your spirit you've got memory and you can feed that with spotify right and in your in your in your spirit you have affection you can feed that with netflix there's a lot of there's things in our spirit that have different channels different ways of input and so the spirit can begin to get a little bit more robust and maybe a little bit more excited a little bit more deterred and moved and what you need is a word to feed your soul so the word could come over there and take that imagination and shake it a little bit and get it in line and so our sense is faith and the stimulus the only stimulus to our soul is the word now the this triune being this body which we see spirit which were we use in our emotional realm and the soul it all this person exists within dimensions and again this is just a simplistic way to ponder how we are existing exist within light time and matter we exist within time because you're already thinking brother aaron's been preaching so long uh it's light because it's what gives us the distinction of the things around us and that's all things are comprised of matter maybe a little bit over simplistic but it's just a way to identify the dimensions that we live in within time with light in matter and these things light time and matter make up the natural world that we live in so we live in a realm of dimensions we live in light time and matter and then our body and spirit exist fully within that natural realm right your body and your spirit exist within light time and matter the soul can be raised already seated in heavenly places in christ jesus so it has a representation in eternity it's actually not tethered to anything that takes a place around here it is our but it is our body and our spirits our souls existing deep within us but our body and our spirits exist completely within this natural realm and the senses of the body and the senses of the spirit allow us to live in this physical world if you had no physical sense and you had no emotional awareness you wouldn't be existing in this world you may have you may have a heartbeat you may have a breath you could be artificially kept alive but it's these senses of the body and the senses of our spirit that allow us to live in and move within the physical world we learn we understand we move we interact in the natural world through the senses of our body and spirit amen there and that was an easy one but then again if there's a debate we can talk about it we could talk about whether or not it's actually we may all be brains in a vat right isn't that one of the philosophical arguments we're really not here you're just a brain in a bowl somewhere with a bunch of wires hooked up to it and they're running the church program this morning so guess what you feel like you're in church but you're really a brain in a bowl just having the experience of going to church now just a few scriptures to highlight some of these uh the emphasis in the word about spirit and and and body in proverbs 18 14 this is a very a precious scripture to me it says the spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity this is actually identifying the relationship between the body and the spirit and saying that a man's spirit can lift up and strengthen a man's weak body so this would be to any person this is this is how a mom when she's sick she gets up in the morning the kids get dressed and stuff gets done right it's her spirit that allows her to pick her body up and move through the pain and push past the pain and get things done that need to get done now if the dad is sick enough and has an excuse he's going to lay in bed and rest a little while but the man still has the ability and this is how you see men who ache and are sore and and maybe even have really really bad uh physical conditions but their spirit picks them up they put their boots on and they go to work and they work their 60 hours a week not because their body's strong enough but this motivation this and this this passion this desire the spirit will pick up a weak body and move them and motivate them to get the job done so it's identified how the spirit holds a very strong position with the within the nature of a person that the body can be broken but an unbroken spirit can actually lift it up ate it and mend it in a sense right until such a time the body is made well and they've even or there's they're documenting this to some degree with even certain individuals how that just the mental uh discipline can actually regulate body temperature or endure very difficult things and it's not just a function of a dial on the wrist you know look at this body modification i put a thermostat here and i can just move it around it's something in your mind that they're able to do and the scriptures identifying a relationship between the spirit and the body and this is the one that is very enlightening it says but a wounded spirit who can bear it's asking the question of when the body's broken when the body's wounded your spirit's what helps you through it actually a a positive attitude and even the i'm not really wanting to get into this effect but the placebo effect really is a function of the spirit being confident that you took something that's going to remedy your physical ailment and guess what happens the element gets remedied like they took nothing more than water why because the spirit has a very unique function within the body but wound the spirit and the body can't re in reverse men the spirit a well body cannot reach into the spirit and say i'll pick you up when you're down the body when it's when it's wounded it relies upon the spirit when the spirit gets broken what does the body do it hangs down too and it looks at the spirit and says oh i'm well but i'm unable and i'm right there with you i i if you're not motivated i'm not motivated i can't get you out of bed i have health i have strength but if you're broken i can't move in proverbs chapter 14 verse 10 it says the heart knoweth his own bitterness and a stranger does not intermedal with his joy it's speaking of the inward griefs and inward joys of our heart they're not known anyone else but ourselves and so a person is aware and conscious of his personal feelings the heart knows its own bitterness it's aware of its its harms its wounds its anxieties its fears and a stranger someone else is not actually able to experience your feelings now they can have their own feeling of happiness they can have their own feeling of joy but they cannot it's just it's just there's something very unique about your feelings something very unique about your emotions something very unique about what you're experiencing and only your heart knows your own bitterness it's only known to you it's not known to anyone else and somebody else does not cannot really know truly how you're feeling and again this scripture is identifying a relationship even among our feelings that now that you see as the body and the spirit relate now within the spirit realm there can be a consciousness of a feeling of pain and you know your bitterness and you know about this and there's a now a relationship and an interaction among our feelings within our spirit maybe a way just to help you to understand the point that i'm trying to make that when it comes to tasting food it's remarkable just how much smell plays a part in that all right maybe it's not as remarkable to some of us who smelt some pretty foul food before and weren't willing to taste it but it all it plays a part it's not just the taste it's texture and the smell and then even to the point to where if it's plated correctly and even the color foods they use a lot of food coloring because they say if you serve that the way it looks naturally the mind's going to tell you don't eat that gray stuff right that doesn't look natural and so there's these all of our senses with it with respect to the body have this interplay and interaction it's the same within our spirit our memory our reason and affection and i i have to skip now and make this connection now without uh belaboring this point our memory our reason our affection and imagination they work all work independently and they work even independently or can they can be a channel or a chamber or be sensitized apart from our conscience so these other chambers because they can move and they can be influenced and they can have data input they can weaken or cloud our conscience the heart knows its own bitterness so bitterness and these disconcerting feelings and these different things can now begin to influence your conscience or i can say this way there can be a conflict between your conscience and your emoting emotions and and so i i i i need to i need to press i need to press further so a clean conscience is the function of aligning our spirits with our souls so despite the presence of other negative emotions despite the presence of disconcerting feelings and i have bitterness and i have anxiety and i have this memory and i have this affection and i'm reasoning and i'm doubting over here the the to bring harmony with a person isn't necessary to say well you don't have to be sad anymore you don't have to do this you don't have to do that it's taken by conscience and aligning all these things so that they're in harmony with god's word even to the point where i'm very sorrowful and your conscience tells you jesus was a man of sorrow acquainted with grief and it takes whatever sorrow that is and it aligns it and if there's some memory that tells you that haunts you say you know what the blood of jesus christ is forgive me of all sins and it aligns it if there's some reason you say well you know what i'm not sure lord i believe help thou my unbelief and there's a way that you begin to take different things and you begin to line it up correctly the bible says in first timothy chapter 1 verse 19 notice it says holding faith we hold faith and a good conscience so there's something this faith which exists within the soul by virtue of being born again i have a renewed faith i have a sealed faith it says and a good conscience well this relates to the person your spirit and your mind you want to hold to your faith with a good conscience says which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck they put aside their faith therefore they they are fallen first timothy chapter 3 verse 9 holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience well that's a that's a real deep deep statement so it's a there's a there's a mystery to faith there's a mysterious element to faith if you're not quite sure what it's talking about just tell somebody what you believe sometime by revelation and that look on their faith face that's the mystery right they're like what because they don't understand how could you believe that where do you see that you're like well it's just right here in the bible and and that's the mystery of your faith there's an element that's hidden until it's revealed to you but it says it's held in a pure conscience now there there could be an application of this will refer to the soul awareness and this man on the inside of the man that's deep down inside there this pure mind of christ deep down within our souls and you say well that's your pure conscience but you have the faith of god which is in your soul but now the bible wants us to also have a spirit that's clean a clean spirit so it says holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience this is how conscience now is going to interact and relate to a pure soul now titus chapter 1 verse 15. so it took me a little bit but now i'm wanting to use a very specific subject uh as an example of what we're talking about of a clean conscience and and how that works with even a born-again soul in titus chapter 1 verse 15 it says unto the pure all things are pure but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving that kind of helps us understand who he's talking about now when he says pure he says unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure nothing is pure to those who are defiled and unbelieving but even their mind and conscience is defiled now he says under the purity talk about the born again under the pure the christian those who are christians all things are pure now if we had time we could back up and we could look at how that paul is referring to jewish fables and so he's saying that talking about jewish fables and the the jewish fables he's referring to are the regulation of food and purification there's certain things related to the jewish faith and certain things related to judaism that are trying to be mixed and blended in with your christianity and somehow don't be these jewish fables and he's referring to how food was regulated the purification of food and even the purification of things and so he's saying essentially that it's not food that makes one impure not the food that's going to make you impure because to the pure all things are pure but when one is unbelieving and defiled no food can make him pure see this is kind of the point in the emphasis that's being made that if you're pure all things are pure but if you're undefiled eating food's not going to purify you if it doesn't matter what you eat that's not going to accomplish purification and so it's talking about how a defiled mind and conscience causes a person to be in air no matter regardless of what they're doing with a defiled mind and defiled conscience they're constantly in airing and the way if you read this more holy and as i go into maybe the next uh the next scripture these are the things that paul is trying to bring out that every man and we remember remember now the difference with perception and how perception forms your own reality but doesn't necessarily mean that's what's true or what is paul is showing that every person is kind of a creator of their own world and that they um they walk in a universe of their own creation it's informed by senses and their spirit their interpretation of these things so the mind creates a world of itself this is the way things are this is the way things are going to be and if that being the case even as we've read already that the the heart knows its own bitterness and another man can't necessarily inter-meddle with it and get in there and actually feel what a person is feeling they can be sympathetic and even empathetic but not know truly exactly what that individual is feeling and so as a person creates a world into themselves the visible world can present itself differently to each person you're saying and if we have to even use just the natural attitude today of how where brother joel has a front row seat he's seeing things from a different vantage point than somebody who's sitting at the back and so based upon where you are you're going to see things differently and so every person the world presents itself differently to every individual so he says unto the pure all things are pure those who've had their soul renewed by the word and their heart purified by faith to the genuine christian to the food proper food which they for nourishment is pure like if you're eating something that's for food and for nourishment it is pure it's lawful to a christian someone whose soul has been born again if food is properly for nutrition and you eat this for nutrition then it can be eaten without doubt can be eaten without hesitancy it can be eaten without guilt and so paul is saying the distinction of the old testament law is being removed then in the old testament law there had been a distinction among the meats and different things that if you ate it there would be this offense but now with the distinction of the old testament law being removed one can eat without the food with the without the food having some sort of weight of immorality you know if that eat you eat that you're sinning against god right you know some people try to make us feel guilty when we're wanting to eat like you know how many calories isn't that don't you and for the sake of a clear conscience i don't want to know right you know they should make uh uh labels uh voluntary like don't show me a label have a label section in the grocery store for those who want to read labels i identify as labelers and i want to be able to have a section in the store where i don't know how many calories are in it that way if as long as my this is a good point to be picking up on because this is exactly what paul's saying that with that distinction removed you can eat without guilt isn't that what they call some of these calorie-free things guilt-free chocolate and so the conscience then paul was saying the conscience should not be burdened the country should not be enslaved by the things which have no moral character if you eat meat it's meat amen father's day yeah red meat medium rare rare rare plus blue just cut off its horns wipe its nose and send it out that's how i want my meat right he said if you eat meat eat meat you should not be burned you should not have your conscience now weighing you down and cause you to feel as if you sinned and you're defiled because you're eating catfish so these distinctions have been removed these things have no moral character themselves by doing it it is not righteous by not doing it it is not a sin whatever these distinctions are they've been removed so therefore the conscience shot ought to be released so he's saying unto the defiled or the unconverted those who still have a dark soul and a polluted mind their mind is contaminated with impure things therefore their conscience is defiled and guilty and so when he's using this when he says the very statement here their mind and conscience is defiled he's describing the intellectual side of a person and even the ethical or moral side of a person their conscience what's right what's wrong how do i behave how do i act he's saying both of them are stained that's what defile means it's polluted and so the mind observes the form of things i'm beholding a piece of meat and then the conscience draws conclusions and then explanations for it i see meat this is red meat and then it and then it's informed that this is you know this is a corn-fed beef i'm gonna get myself in trouble now and the conscious tells you you shouldn't do that it's gonna kill you within four days right and this is how the mind then draws these interpretations and these conclusions he said if both are defiled then if the mind and the conscience are defiled then what character does the do your thoughts have what character do your words have what's the character of your actions if your mind and conscience are defiled then everything you do is defiled it doesn't matter what you do it doesn't matter what you abstain from it doesn't matter what you touch taste smell or hear all of it is send to you with a defiled mind and a defiled conscience so paul it's just amazing how in one statement he just very succinctly declares that purity consists in mind and conscience in not on the external things alone that this purity exists within the mind the purity exists within the conscience and not external worship and external elements and washing this and abstaining from that that it's something it's a condition of mind it's a condition of conscience and now catch this if you kind of say well you kind of lost me on corn-fed beef there brother aaron if i've lost you in the last you know 10 minutes just recognize this part the word is actually addressing mechanisms that burden our conscience very specific here very specific here but notice how paul believe it or not is taking time to talk to the believers about what they eat why not because a moment on the lips is a lifetime on the hips he's doing it because of their minds he's doing it because of something in their spirits the word is actually addressing things that burden our conscience and it does it in order to free our conscience so that we can have pure minds and a pure conscience to serve god perfectly it's not even related to the nutritional value and the next chapter paul's not debating the merits about whether or not red meat reduces inflammation right it's not the natural benefit it's him addressing something that had worked its way into the church and was causing people's minds to be burdened and he was wanting them to be liberated in their conscience so that's the point i want to make the word wants to liberate your conscience if we could just leave the meat issue alone in terms of what what does this mean for us today brother aaron what it means for us today is the word is actually addressing something that hindered people's conscience so in first corinthians chapter 8 verse 7 and i'd like to read all of what our text was it says howbeit there is not ever in every man that knowledge now what he's referring to is in verse four it talks about how eating things that are sacrificed to idols he says we know that an idol is nothing in the world paul saying we know that there's nothing to an idol right there's nothing to this and and he's taking something that might have been really really big right people have been really really fanatical and let's start a movement against this and let's all get caught up in this and paul said there's nothing to this nothing to it at all to even where later in romans he's saying hey if if he even invites you over to his house to eat eat what's served to you don't ask what farm it's from right he says don't ask just eat it and maybe that's teaching us good manners but it's also saying don't ask a bunch of questions that once you find out where it comes from it offends your conscience and it causes you some consternation and some some difficulty and so hey you know i don't need to go into some department store and say i have you guys guys file the 10k i want to know what you're uh where you stand on pride month i want to know what your policies are with respect to um to this and um did the ceo vote for decriminalization of marijuana and what what's their platform you know i just need to go in and get a hammer and leave right and not burden myself with whether or not the two cent margin on the hammer is going to go to change some boy to a girl hey he's saying let's not have our conscience burdened by these things so says that some do not have this knowledge that an idol is nothing it means nothing there's no there's no implication to the soul in this for some with conscience of the idols very very specific here but then the generalizations i want to pull from this remain true for some with conscience of the idol into this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol and their conscience being weak is defiled that's established this is what this is this is true paul is not preaching teaching this to the unsaved paul is not talking about the heathen he's not talking about the jew hasn't been converted he's not talking about the sinner he's talking about born again christians okay that's his audience and he's saying some christians lack full knowledge that there's no power or no life in an idol and if it's hard for you to understand this you talk about gentiles who fell down on their face and worshiped idols and offered things to idols and spoiled things to idols and they actually believed i mean think about the links that gentiles went to to bury kings and and pharaohs with things that they could use and enjoy in the afterlife thinking in their minds that there was some way that they articulate with these things there's some life and power in it so when a person is converted and they had a duplicity of dog dogs yeah they dog worshipers and isn't that what a dyslexic insomniac agnostic does they lay awake at night wondering if there's a dog there they had multiple gods with multiple powers and multiple uh ways of worship so whenever they converted to the one true god they could still have some idea that this is the bestest of all the gods right but yet there's still some power and influence in these gods they're not the true gods these are false gods and so there could still be some influence to these idols in these images and he's saying that a christian without the full knowledge that there's no power there's no life there's no influence in these dead idols with that in their mind with conscience it says of idol what is it old associations a misdirected conscience with this lingering idea it impacts the conscience so some former idol worshipers may still hold to the belief that some meats differed from others because of the relationship to an idol can we can we accept that that's that's how paul is outlining this he's saying that here's some meats that have been offered to some idol you having never been an idol worshiper no there's no difference there is no difference than what's being sold at target versus being what sold at walmart except the vip points you get at target or whatever or maybe the label sometimes we're buying something that targets something at walmart that's just a white label product at the same place as manufacturing no difference and so some can one can have the knowledge hey you can get that it's the same thing as this right and but then there's someone else who doesn't know right don't know all i know is that target at one time was supporting gender neutral bathrooms and so i never want to shop at target again because there's that's going to be power to the antichrist and i want to shop at walmart right the whole concept of a gender-neutral bathroom should not stumble on any of us right isn't that what we have at our house let's just not get distracted that's my point and so now paul is saying that someone else who has never worshipped idols we're going to is going to look at that and think differently but somebody who did worship idols is going to immediately ascribe something different to that meat because their conscience okay and again i'm not trying to make a big deal about meat i think i know what i'm doing for father's day micah can you make me a reservation at fleming's for two o'clock please thank you their conscience being weak he says could be defiled it was vulnerable some sort of exploitable part of their conscience could be polluted again the word they're stained it could be a weak conscience then in this area this vulnerability could be defiled if they act against that so they believe that the idols had an influence on the food that's offered up to it making it unclean therefore in their minds they believed that it should not be eaten and believing that it should not be eaten to eat it would burden them i'm just trying to explain what the scripture is saying and taking some time to do it because i feel like i can actually use a harmless example as a way to get us thinking before we look at where this really counts so even though their conscience may be weak it's binding that interesting even though it may be a weak conscience that had the ability to to take them and bind them and then if offended it clouds and pollutes their spirits so oh well that's just a weak he's just has a weak conscience but a weak conscience if offended has the power to take the whole person and bind it paul writes in romans chapter 14 verse 14 i know and am persuaded by the lord jesus that there is nothing unclean of itself but to him that esteemeth anything to be unclean to him it is unclean so this is where this is where even you could say well brother aaron that scripture rebukes you when you're a little bit flip it flip it about a gender neutral bathroom and i say absolutely if it offends somebody it offends them and we wouldn't need to be very sarcastic or demeaning and upset about it that if he's making the point that if a man esteems something believes something to be unclean to him it is right because he lives within the world of his creation the world presents itself differently to this person this is why some people can do something and they do they're not burdened in their conscience but somebody else themselves they cannot do it because they know too much that's why some people can do things go places even some people can go to uh have relationships with certain people some people can even be benefited by certain ministries because they don't know certain things others can know certain things very specific things and not that they think there's no ministry or not that they think evil if somebody's like well i know that and it i can't get over that part it could be something very personal there's nothing unclean of itself but it's the person's esteeming that makes it unclean if you were unconscious that the meat was offered to idols he's saying there'd be no defilement of conscience if you were unconscious of it but being conscious and without better knowledge so you're conscious and you're aware without better knowledge that there's really there's nothing unclean in itself eating causes them to sin against their conscience those are the dynamics so i'd like to just i'd like to just read verses 8 to 13 completely and then and maybe back up and go back over there so we can see how paul is sensitive to a person's conscience because really if there's no moral character in it he's going to say if there's no moral character in it and doing it would actually offend your brother's conscience maybe you shouldn't do it very very very simple commandment he says but meat commendeth us not to god a meat's not going to prove your disapproving before god for neither if we eat are we the better neither if we eat not are we the worst neither eating or eating meat approves us or disapproves us before god amen vegans and carnivores alike we can all say amen isn't that awesome then it doesn't matter if you if you like soy burgers it doesn't matter if you like you know 80 20 blend in your burger it doesn't matter to god so he says but take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to them that are weak for if any man see thee which has knowledge sit at me in the idol's temple before you try to make it you know religious that you have a preference when it comes to certain foods there's a specific tie into religion and in faith and purification and righteousness that paul is alluding to so this this doesn't won't translate over right so that we have our keto camp in the church and you're the more spiritual and the more pure and more in harmony with god this isn't creating counts based upon nutrition these these ideals have been torn down and don't should not exist within our christianity but again the generalization is dealing with the way man feels his thoughts if you sit at me in the idol's table shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols your example what you are doing now gives occasion to them who would are weak in their conscience to think oh well if he's doing it then maybe i should and through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish for whom and i love how paul wants to remind us for whom christ died this just isn't some dude who hates meat this is the son of god that and christ died for him and your attitude in the way that you're acting about something is creating a situation to where they're emboldened to do something that causes him to perish in and christ died for him but when ye sin so against the brethren so the offense is not necessarily a transgression of god's word he's saying you've sinned against the brother and wound to disquiet it means to disquiet one's conscience to smite them with the heaviness or weight and you wound their weak conscience it already being weak now it's smitten or wounded he says you actually sin against christ not in transgressing his word but in wounding his daughter not in transgressing the commandment of the of the word of god but in offending his son man that's powerful he says wherefore if meat make my brother to offend i will eat no flesh while the world standeth lest i make my brother to offend what a integrity on paul's part when someone with doubt in mind eats against his conscience he says it destroys his peace they're smitten in their weak conscience and those with more knowledge is actually alluding it to a liberty ought to give great care that they don't stumble the weaker so it's a very beautiful principle that i'm i'm not giving enough due time this morning but this is what i want you to see paul is freeing the conscience irrespective of the subject matter okay i want you to recognize that he could have been using something else but he's taking great going to great lengths in titus in romans and corinthians to free the conscience he's wanting to clean the conscience of guilt he's wanting to liberate it from the weight of heaviness he's wanting to take a smitten conscience and and soothe it and heal it and mend it so he's telling this is be something that we we ought to recognize paul is saying that the believer's conscience can become unclean they're in christ they're christ's seed that's how they can be offended and that offense against them is offense against christ but he's saying that a believer's conscience can become unclean so a clean conscience is a free conscience and he's identifying that god cares and is concerned about your conscience because as we already looked at in the scripture and i hope that this part can become more clear there's something about cleaning our conscience that relates to the perfection of our being and and the robustness of our faith and the liberty that we have to walk in his truth god wants to liberate our conscience so that we can be completely free to serve him without fear an unclean or defiled conscience keeps us from the confidence that we need to release perfect faith we've got a faith in our souls that wants to just burst out to a point to change this and there's things that are standing in the way of it and so the word not being able to do any more to perfect your soul since it's already perfect is going to preach and preach and preach to your hearts and minds to the point where you can in your spirits have complete and absolute confidence to release the perfect faith that's inside your souls and that's why the word is preached the word is preached and then subsequently revealed to the individual in order to liberate and free your conscience my soul has been sealed by the preaching of the word and the confession of my faith and the baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ and the baptism of the holy ghost to seal my soul into kingdom that's what the word accomplished for my soul now the word continually preached and subsequently revealed to my spirit where my heart releases me of any guilt and condemnation and it's cleansing and liberating my conscience and so first corinthians chapter 8 teaches us now this is where i'm not now this is the that's the foundation this is a foundation in in a specific area to make a point that was the very the the the inspiration for the entire this subject of pure joy and i'm so grateful that i'm able to come to it to this morning because it just seemed like it was getting further and further away but first corinthians 8 is showing us that things that are not true that there could be a life or influence to an idol conduct can defile a believer's conscience it cannot defile his soul but not having full knowledge something in the partaking of it or in some element of it it can defile a believer's conscience so understand not the soul but his spirit and what the scripture is showing us and we could use other examples but it's just so clear to me and perfectly placed we can be influenced by certain ideas we can be influenced by memories and associations that we can we're influenced by our consciousness of certain feelings it influences us so this is what first corinthians chapter 8 is telling us that there's things known things unknown things in our minds and our spirits whether true or not true that can burden our conscience and the word is willing to say hey that should not burden your conscience you're free from it because if it was burning your conscience and there was a remedy in the word the word would show us you feel that way because you've done wrong make it right and so if the word was saying you shouldn't have eaten that so stop eating it repent and move on that's how the conscience is going to be unburdened but actually the word comes and says instead of saying you know what why don't we just all go in on these jewish rules as it relates to the purification of foods and just establish the standard and just abide by that to remove any confusion paul is saying no no no no no no let's not invent something as a remedy to this situation let's expose it for what it is and call it out there's nothing to it for the purpose of what not so much telling the the the the person who was making it in the issue to be quiet but to liberate the person who was being smitten by it he cared enough to release the conscience of his son or daughter he cared enough to clean that to purify and liberate it praise the lord so now let's just think of ourselves as we were not formerly jews nor were we formerly heathens necessarily for some of us or idol worshipers but we're all sinners we all have a past and in the message mighty god unveiled statement is one time there was a boy he got in some trouble he was a good boy but he went to court and the judge says i find you guilty i must punish you to life in prison so we could we could come to the conclusion that there had been an obvious uh offense and activity to the point to where beyond a reasonable doubt this judge could find that the person was guilty that their the evidence indicated guilt for these actions so brother graham says i that he says and the boy said i want to try my own case i want to go in upon my record now i think it's just marvelous that that he's going to try to make the point like let's put ourselves in his shoes right and the boy has just committed a crime and and he's gonna he's facing life in prison and he says i want to go in upon my record and the judge says you have no record your record is what condemned you like you're trying to go in on your actions you're here because of your actions you you can't you can't refer to your past as the evidence of your lack of guilt it's your past that condemns you it's what you did that condemns you you don't even have a record to go on but then he says and there's a that's the way it is today the reason the church is not advanced like it should it's the record and then he says it's the lie here's a boy who was in fact guilty and was wanting to go on his own record and he says that's the problem with the church today they're wanting to go on their own record church history works all these whatever it might be what their record but then he says it's the lie because the boy in his mind might have been thinking i'm a good boy i've got a decent record but all it took was a mistake to sully the whole record and so we could say well i want to go in my own record brother says well the record actually condemns you but then he says it's the lie it's such a powerful statement so he says we must become more dedicated we must become we must believe every word of god we must seek him until that word is made real to us the record is what keeps us from entering in so he said there's something we must seek and it's the record that's holding us back there's something that we must do there's something we must be desirous of we must seek his word until it's real we must believe every word we must become more dedicated but the record and the lie hinders us from becoming more dedicated it hinders us from believing every word it hinders it from it becoming personally real to us keeps us from entering in it's your record that condemns you just as one eating meat a sacrifice to idols who had conscience of idols it offended his consciousness your your his conscience your consciousness of your past and even your present troubles your hearts and notice how it isn't the record alone wherein you observe the record that holds us back but it's the lie in other words the conclusions draw from it so you can observe the record and say well the record's very clear but what's your interpretation of the record remember the difference between observation and explanation and that where the the problem often lies is not in the observation but the interpretation the explanation so then paul in first corinthians chapter eight was using the present truth the further revealed truth to deal with people who are coming out of a former age a former ideology a former way of thinking he was using a presently revealed truth to tear down anything that would hold the believer back from fully entering into peace and relationship with jesus christ he said this is the these are the facts these are the issues these are the things now you may look at it and say well i observe this and i observe that but where you're wrong is not in the record maybe it is in fact offered to idols but the truth is there's nothing to an idol and the conclusion he's drawing is that you're not any more unclean before god by having eating it then you are pure before god by not eating it and this is for the sake of releasing somebody using the present truth to bring them out of what was holding them back and let me say this the source of the believer's pure joy isn't found in god fulfilling his promised word to us like what he's promised to us the source of the bride's joy is found in god bringing to pass his promise to us in this time and in this day now in in the remaining moments that we have together i i'd like to i'd like to just do this very quickly if i could with and i hope that you're able to hold these things in your in your mind all these different principles because they were they're just building blocks and and principles that we're wanting to build upon now in revelations chapter 3 behold i stand at the door knock and it's an invitation to the bride to open up and then there's an entrance there's a door opened in heaven and and john is raised up a little higher this is the believer's invitation in this hour that we're brought up we're wraps it up quickly to meet the word for this day and we're lifted above these things now chapter 4 is setting the scene for the throne in heaven in revelations chapter 5 there is a book that is sealed in the right hand of him that sits upon the throne and and the statement is essentially made or the question is asked who's worthy to open the book no one being found worthy it says in verse 4 john's saying i wept much this is a converted born-again sealed filled son of god who's already seen a lot through the first few chapters right he's had a lot to witness i mean he ought not to be questioning his experience and his standing he has just through three chapters seeing the future the rest of the church in its existence and he's been brought up into heaven into heaven to see a scene in heaven and then all it took is for someone to say nobody's worthy to open the book john starts bawling and crying because no man was found worthy to open the book and to read the book neither to look thereon what happened it wasn't his soul that was broken but something in john's conscience was wounded something disturbed his rest something began to disturb his peace now we understand that this book had it remain closed then the reality that begins to dawn upon john is he's like look i know that the lamb purchased my redemption and i know that i have been baptized with the holy ghost i am his son but there's something contained in this book in this scene that he as he sees it and john when he looks at this he's he's thinking if this is sealed then all i have is my testimony if this is sealed then all i have is my record if this book remains closed then all they can do is open up these other books and judge me by it because in revelations chapter 20 verse 12 i saw the dead small and great stand before god and the books were opened and another book was opened which is the book of life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works john know there's going to be books open one day that aren't necessarily sealed these are the books of works these are the books that judge all men that had natural life and they're going to be judged not according to the work of the lamb this is not those in the lamb's book of life this is a record of life that has all natural life and they're going to be judged by their works so when john is what is he told oh don't cry don't cry you you you you're missing something here he says the lamb hath prevailed or the lion of judah hath prevailed the line of judah have prevailed to take the book and loose the seals thereof so john's weeping but now there's been a prevailing in the interim and something was happening it wasn't just merely a rhetorical question it caused something to happen it was the impetus to something happening this book being taken now and the seals loosed and john says he turns to look look expecting to see a line and what did he see the lamb which had purchased his redemption so now he sees the blood connected with the taking of this book and then we know that when the seals are open what does brother branham teach us he says john must have what seen himself john saw something in that record john saw something in that book and it changed a man who in verse 4 was crying and weeping tree says in verse 13 every creature which is in heaven and on earth and under the earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard i saying blessing and honor and glory and power be into him that sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb forever and ever because what did john see not his own natural life not even his own passion his own experiences but he saw his true self in the book of life he saw it written in permanent ink he saw it written and read he saw it written in a way that it could never be removed and by him now having that further vindication it transformed weeping into joy though he was the son of god there was still a weakness in his conscience that until that book was taken john could still be defiled but once the lion of the tribe of judah had prevailed and opened the truth of that book it released something to that individual where once he had fellowship with it once it became real to him it took that part of his mind that was weak or wounded or vulnerable and it changed it and transformed it and now john could scream and worship so loud he says anybody in the sea anyone on the earth whatever creatures existed heard me saying blessing honor glory rejoicing power and brother branham says this and a question and answer is part three but now this picture is the main thing i'm wanting you to connect victory ahead is victory now remember this that then in the resurrection those gases and acids and things come right back into the place and develops this picture again so this body that is going to be glorified picked up even as he would say by the theophany this picture he says was not taken when you were 16 or 18 or 20 years old at your best now it gets better when was it taken before there was a foundation of the world it was put in god's great file so he took a picture of you he put it in his record so you have the a record of natural life but then you have a record of the lamb's book of life you have a record from which names can be removed then you have another record which can names can never be removed and saying we have we have very deep intimacy with the record of the wheat plant and our natural lives right memory reason affection conscience these different things uh they they're so aware our imagination is so we're so conscious of it it's a different record but now there's a picture put in god's photo album in god's file he said the only thing it did was feature yourself it was featured here for you to make your choice so now there's a representation on earth you've made your choice then you become a servant of god him for knowing it makes him a redeemer and we've been through it the negative part of life is where you're living now hey man the negative part of life is where you are living now in anything if there's a negative there's got to be a positive before there can be a negative and if there's a negative there's got to be a positive before there can be a negative therefore if this is a negative there's got to be a positive somewhere it's got to be inverted we're looking at life in a negative and the colors don't make sense and things don't seem to be sharp and it might seem to be a little bit spooky but the life you're living now is negative but if there's a negative here there's a positive somewhere he says that this ain't the real thing this is only a fourth shadow of the real thing that is to come he says now you got it now i i hope this is the part that you can truly catch i don't care what they would do with you they cannot destroy that profile that picture in god's great gallery up there now it may seem to uh to to narrowly relate to what could be done to this body but i want you to think about what could be done to this body what could be done to this spirit because god wants to preserve you wholly and he's saying look they could wet it he's going to make the point there's nothing they can do to this body to keep you from coming up but there's nothing that could be done in this negative there's nothing you've done since birth that can change the picture in god's great file you don't experience a hurt here you don't make a mistake here and somehow that impinges and ruins and mars the picture in god's file no he took the picture before you made a mistake so that it would be blameless so it would be pure so that it would be a record that one day could be used to defend you because you couldn't go on your own record but you could go on his hallelujah think about it it's not even his testimony well he's the the blood of jesus christ was sinless no he's got a record of you he's got a record of you i don't care what they would do with you it cannot destroy the profile that picture in god's great gallery up there it cannot destroy it it's in heaven you could burn it up feed it to the lions do anything you want to it it'll come forth again just as sure as the two twos is four just as sure as god spoke it it'll come forth i think about that this is the word of god meeting us in our guilty conscience this is the word of god trying to address things that exist that linger that harm that impact that bring us down just as paul was taking something as we emphasized was a lie and not true now the word of god when the book is taken and open it reveals what you're perfect we've got to accept it because the fact that you're not perfect is actually a lie because that's just the negative there's a positive that's perfect and the only problem is is they're watching you in the development process and in the development process there's moments where that doesn't look good that seems really really dark that doesn't make any sense just wait till he's finished it's going to be perfect just wait till he's finished it's going to be perfect and so there's a there's a what i'm wanting to let me just say it again a clean conscience is a liberated conscience that our souls if you haven't been born again all i implore you to repent i implore you to accept jesus christ there is only one god there is only one truth and a man is brought into this world as a sinner and he must acknowledge himself and rected himself as a sinner and realize that as a as a man i was born into this world by sin and he must repent of his sins be baptized in the name of jesus christ and he must call upon god to be sealed and be saved by the baptism of the holy ghost sealed into the kingdom of god that's going to do something for your soul if you have not experienced that and implore you to yield to that and to give into that and to accept that but let me just say something to the devil that's trying to hold you back he can't touch your soul so he tries to meddle in your conscience he has a medal in your mind meddle with your memories meddle with your imagination and it's really a cruel thing that the world does to us and really at worst what we do to ourselves but if god has something in a file wouldn't it help you to see it if he if he had a record and and your spirit's telling you all sorts of things and brother bran said the reason why the church can't progress because it's the record and the record the lie the record's trying to tell not merely just the record because we could agree to facts there's even in in litigation there's there's ways in which you can agree on a set of facts and all the parties agree but you still have to go forward and figure out what the facts mean what does it represent at the end of the day what is it what is it that's gonna what is it that's gonna um impact the uh we can all agree on the set of facts but we have a different we form our own views we have our own opinions we're informed from different things it's in the explanation interpretation of it and so god has something in his file vindicate us let's look at deuteronomy chapter 22 let me read something and i want you to see yourself portrayed here in type in deuteronomy chapter 22 verses 13 to 17 you'll have to just be um real mature with me now as we read this if any man take a wife and go in unto her and hate her then subsequently hate her so married the marriage is consummated but then he turns against her and give occasions of speech against her so now he's accusing her and through the accusations brings up an evil name upon her and says i took this woman and when i came to her i found her not a maid so do you understand what's being alleged here what the accusation is i married her and i found out she basically she'd been married before that she was no longer she was not a maid now this is it says an evil name it's occasions of speech against her now here's a man accusing a woman and the woman is not is not asked what do you say notice what happens then shall the father of the damsel and her mother take and bring forth the tokens of the damsel's virginity under the elders of the city in the gate and what was this this was something that was given to the man and the woman that they would take with him when he went in unto her and it would be there in the bedroom as it were and then after the marriage is consummated it's given to the father for him to keep so he keeps this and it says and the damsel's father shall say unto the elders i gave my daughter unto this man to wife and he hated her and lol have given occasions of speech against her saying i found not thy daughter a maid and yet these are the tokens of her purity this is the evidence of her innocence these are the tokens of my daughter's morality her integrity her perfectness her wholeness this is the token of my daughter's virginity and they shall unfold or spread out or unroll the cloth before the city and as they do it the blood is a testimony against the lies of her first husband and so i want to see yourself portrayed in type here her husband of the flesh the husband of her flesh took her innocence and so it's her flesh even as they say well they're one flesher joining it's her flesh that condemns her and the very man that's accusing her is the one that had defiled her so if she stands there she doesn't have any evidence she doesn't have any proof she has no defense she has no testimony she has no standing to defend herself so she stands there she may have this sense well i'm innocent and i'm free but she's overwhelmed with the sense of guilt and fear for the consequences of the lie she stood there they're not even asking was it true is it true she just stands there feeling condemned her own flesh condemning her her mind condemning her feeling trapped feeling the weight feeling the burden feeling the fear there was only one thing that could expose the lie there was only one thing admissible as this is the law that's being unfurled there's only one thing her father her father held the record of her purity so she stood there she only had one hope that her father would show up she only had one hope that the one who had the token the one that had the proof the one that had the file the one that had the evidence could come and defend her i want you to see yourself portrayed and type here your first husband is dead i want you to even see how your flesh condemns you condemned in the flesh but her father had the token of her innocence and it was a token of her innocence that would vindicate her it was the token of her innocence that would release any condemnation let me say this to the fathers on on father's day fathers you are the keepers of your family's purity you are the keepers of your family's virtue you are the protectors and the defenders of your family purity that is what we're called to do as fathers as a father i am a keeper of my family's virtue as a father i am the protector and the defender of my family's purity that's what this father represented in deuteronomy chapter 22 he had a go he had a an office he had a responsibility though it seemed as if he had given her away and she had married a man and in this marriage falling apart oh it would seem as if she was ruined he still had a responsibility to her why because he had in his possession something that would free her and vindicate her and set her free and this is exactly what we could say we see in revelations chapter 5 when john sits there weeping he's condemned in the presence of what in the presence of the elders he has to go on his record he has to go on a lie he feels condemned he doesn't know what to do i know my sins have been forgiven i know the lamb paid the price but unless that book is opened i fall short of the fullness of redemption but our scenario we see in this very image that there in the hand of the father he held the token of our innocence and what happens in revelations chapter five you know the book was not a book like this but it was a scroll and could you imagine the token this cloth rolled up and held in the bosom of the father for the day that he would need it and now a book is sealed a scroll and in revelations chapter 5 the lamb unfolds the scroll and lays it out in the presence of the elders for our justification this is the source of pure joy the bible says he shall appear to your joy do you know what the very last words of the church age book are in may his coming rejoice your heart this is the source of the believer's joy not what the world can give but it's what christ has done for us musicians if he could come let me just try to provoke one last thought in this way if you were charged with the crime you didn't commit we could say on one hand there is a sense of i didn't do it i didn't do it i didn't do anything wrong but we know and we've seen it happen time and time again where people who are innocent of crimes can be coerced and admitted to them and confessing to things they never did and that's why there are certain rules and laws in place to uh to protect those who are accused but innocent until proven guilty so that they don't give a an admission to something and under coercion or duress admit to things and and say things but if you did something and you know you were innocent but yet you're facing trial how easy would it be to rest before the trial is over we could look at the criminal justice system be like well mistakes are made innocent people are put to death what if somebody lies and i said i didn't do it i wasn't there somebody else says yes they were they were there we saw it so you have you don't necessarily have a guilty conscience but now you have a weakened conscience to say i know i didn't do it but what if i'm what if something happens and they find me guilty and that scenario you would not rest fully you would not be able to experience the the benefit of innocence until the sentence until the judgment came right not until the time that the judge would say or the the jury would say we find the defendant not guilty even though you knew on one hand you were innocent you were still waiting for the final adjudication you were waiting for the judge to declare you're waiting for the jury to declare to say i find him not guilty and then that would be yes yes i knew it all along this is what i believe this is what i stood for this is what i confessed i told you i was innocent then any threat of punishment is released i i meant to reach out to brother mario chua this past week to ask him about it because he shared at one time a very similar experience where he had been wrongly accused of a crime and he testifies that he was though he knew he was innocent he lived under the weight of the charge he lived under the weight of the indictment he lived under the weight of the trial thinking i know i'm innocent but what is the judge going to say in the end because at the end of the day that's whose opinion matters after the day it's the final judgment that's what's going to prove everything and vindicate everything and i thought oh my if that's not the exact state of those of us we believe in our innocence we've accepted the blood of jesus christ we we've heard that we have not done it in the first place but listen what this message represents to the bride is not merely the scripture telling us by faith to believe it and accept it but this word opens up to us the unfolding of the book that says you never did it in the first place and it's a declaration of the wig when the righteous judge said that now is the time of your freeing now is the time of your liberation now is the moment when i judicially declare that you are perfect that you are pure to do do what cash down any doubt cast down any reason cast down any thought that would oppose the word of god and it invites us then to take the pure the pure record and eat it that's where your pure joy is only by eating this word can our conscience be fully clean that's where you'll find your joy [Music] this is paul wrestles with the truth that there's nothing to an idol and he took time with a corinthian church to liberate their conscience how much greater then does this message want to free and unburden us from the thing that would hold us back the most you're not living under the threat of punishment we can't even take the truth that you reap what you sow to somehow pervert god's love that he's going to condemn us in the end you have been liberated the only way this conscience is ever going to be clean is you feed on the word that liberates you as paul took time to write a letter to the corinthian church to release those who might seem to be of a weak conscience i'm so glad that in this hour the message reveals to us the unfolding of a scroll in the presence of the elders and that bleeding word is the evidence of your innocence and anything in our minds that you remember this and you imagine that and you have this reason and you have this affection just remember none of that no matter what they try to do to you this flesh condemns you you could come right back to the final vindication the revealing the scene of yourself in the word of god to cast down to cast out let's stand today [Music] let's bow our heads in a word of prayer [Music] hey let's power his word [Music] if you need a special touch from the lord i believe he can touch you [Music] wouldn't it be just wonderful to see your father advancing from glory today not with a record that condemns you [Music] but one that'll liberate you and say don't worry honey all is well don't worry my child all is well but but my my body did this and my flesh did that and the world took this away from me and it world took that away from me and i can't ever have this back and i can't have ever that he says no no daughter it's okay i'm here to vindicate you i'm here to defend you i've held it all this time i took the picture before the devil could get to you [Music] so that no matter what happened to you here we can say it's not true it's part of the lie trying to hold you back a gracious heavenly father i pray today that in this presence which we feel so sweetly now conscience can be unburdened [Music] and as we acknowledge as a society as a nation a day for fathers what a beautiful picture [Music] of how that father's duty did not cease once he had allowed her to be joined to another union he kept something safe and he just waited for a time that a false accusation would be brought lord may we see ourselves in type may we see more perfectly why this act of revelations 5 is so sublime may we understand more perfectly that what we might call the theology of the message and the historical elements related to seals being opened and swords coming into hands and books being taken and these things and these different elements and these fulfillment scriptures made me realize that it it goes so it's so much deeper than history it's so much more than even just vindicating the prophet he was vindicated for decades prior to this great commission to preach these seals and what in the simplicity of paul's message to the corinthian church and to the romans and the other things that he referenced how that the mystery of the faith ought to be held in pure conscience if paul went to great lengths to preach a word to those with weak conscience being defiled could be smitten and be wounded and be harmed and and brought into bondage and he he tried to bring all truth that would liberate them from a prior understanding and a lack of knowledge then lord do we not see the same thing happen on even a greater level that this message wants to liberate and free our conscience and in doing so lord sets us free to worship you bless us today lord we are in type your daughter who has been lied against who has been accused and if we were asked we would have to be honest yeah i i did this yeah i i did that and i i i made this mistake but we don't have to speak blood speaks i don't have to defend you are my avenger and i say oh god come speedily to your bride's defense today come to their aid and relieve them of their burden of guilt relieve them of this sense of shame relieve them lord from this feeling that one day their past is going to catch up to them lord if it cannot destroy this body then it can no more destroy this spirit may it be strengthened by the name of the lord jesus christ may be liberated by the name of the lord jesus christ may it be covered by the blood of the lamb and may they be set free we ask this in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen just think of that father obviously raised his daughter right and was faithful to his calling and how we ought to see the symbol of a god that loves you oh how he loves you
