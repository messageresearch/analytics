[0:00] ruth chapter one i'd like to start with
[0:03] uh verse one and read to verse five
[0:07] i've been studying the book of ruth and
[0:10] like to if god would lead just maybe do
[0:12] a study in it for a few services
[0:14] maybe several services it would be
[0:18] it would be a book that you could go
[0:19] through verse by verse and uh
[0:21] wouldn't necessarily spend a few years
[0:23] on it even though maybe you could but
[0:25] it's just a short story that would be
[0:27] very easy to read
[0:28] even tonight if we just took time to
[0:30] read it together as a congregation
[0:32] you very easily could go through it in
[0:33] just a several minutes
[0:35] and uh but it's something i'd encourage
[0:37] you to read on your own
[0:39] but i'd like to just take some time and
[0:40] study it because
[0:42] that's just a real beautiful book that
[0:43] holds a lot of meaning for us as message
[0:45] believers and
[0:46] we'll kind of lay a little bit of a
[0:47] foundation for it tonight and so we're
[0:49] continuing on the subject of the bread
[0:51] of life
[0:52] and um the subject of being hungry and
[0:55] being fed and those
[0:56] those things and we'll make a few
[0:57] comments at the beginning to kind of
[0:59] reset that
[1:00] um but our thought right now was this
[1:02] coming to bethlehem
[1:04] is what we're looking at and god has
[1:05] done that for us in this hour brought us
[1:07] an invitation to come to bethlehem and
[1:09] so ruth chapter one
[1:11] verse 1 now it came to pass in the days
[1:13] when the judges ruled
[1:15] that there was a famine in the land and
[1:17] a certain man of bethlehem judah went to
[1:20] sojourn in the country of moab
[1:22] he and his wife and his two sons
[1:25] and that'll be the verse that we'll
[1:27] study tonight
[1:28] and the name of the man was elimelech
[1:31] and the name of his wife was naomi
[1:33] and the name of his two sons were muhan
[1:35] and kilian
[1:36] efrates of bethlehem judah and they came
[1:39] into
[1:40] the country of moab and continued there
[1:42] and elimelech
[1:43] naomi's husband died and she was left
[1:46] and her two sons
[1:47] and they took them wives of the women of
[1:49] moab the name of one
[1:51] of the one was orpah and the name of the
[1:53] other was ruth and they dwelled there
[1:55] about 10 years and michonne and kilian
[1:58] died as both of them
[2:00] died also both of them and the woman was
[2:02] left of her two sons
[2:04] and her husband amen let's just bow our
[2:07] heads in a word of prayer our heavenly
[2:08] father
[2:09] tonight as we're standing in your divine
[2:11] presence we sent something supernatural
[2:14] and we've enjoyed the praise we've
[2:15] enjoyed the atmosphere we've enjoyed the
[2:17] gifts of our brothers who played the
[2:19] music and led the worship and
[2:21] we've benefited by it tonight lord it's
[2:24] washed our spirits and it's
[2:25] it's reading us to hear from you so now
[2:27] lord i pray that you'd come into this
[2:29] humble gathering and speak to us through
[2:30] your word
[2:32] and in doing so may it energize us and
[2:34] strengthen us
[2:35] as we take time as family just around
[2:37] your word reading scripture and
[2:39] and pondering uh what it means and
[2:41] gathering inspiration from it may it be
[2:43] a special time
[2:45] and lord i realize that for myself
[2:48] in maybe the last two decades of
[2:51] ministry that there's
[2:52] as you travel and minister and you
[2:54] preach special meetings and
[2:56] you come to a place and you preach one
[2:57] service and then you go that
[2:59] there's a maybe a tendency to just view
[3:02] every service is so
[3:03] intense and so important and climactic
[3:07] and
[3:07] special and lord i would hope that we
[3:10] wouldn't look at things in the way of a
[3:12] special service or the climax climatic
[3:15] service in a convention but lord realize
[3:17] that every service we have is a special
[3:19] opportunity
[3:20] and as i would take it seriously as a
[3:22] speaker
[3:24] lord may we still yet realize that in
[3:26] simple gatherings where the word is
[3:28] lifted up and
[3:29] and truth is expounded upon that in
[3:31] there there's power
[3:32] and in those simple times together
[3:34] there's a power present to heal us
[3:36] set us free deliver us save souls and
[3:39] lord we want to give you the liberty to
[3:40] move however you would want
[3:42] and we believe that where as believers
[3:45] you can manifest
[3:46] yourself amongst us in power and
[3:47] demonstration and
[3:49] all glory would go to you so now father
[3:51] take control this service for your
[3:52] glories we commit these things
[3:54] into your hands in the name of the lord
[3:56] jesus christ amen
[3:58] you can be seated
[4:05] again we're this is the second part of
[4:07] the bread of life
[4:09] and looking at the same subject come to
[4:11] bethlehem
[4:12] and last time let's just if you'd like
[4:14] to turn in your bibles to revelations
[4:15] chapter 3 verse 20 just
[4:17] want to quickly point to this scripture
[4:19] kind of tie back in
[4:20] uh to where we ended up on ruth last
[4:23] time
[4:24] but jesus speaking to um the this
[4:26] instruction
[4:28] to the laodicean church age after they
[4:31] have been
[4:31] uh chastised and admonished and no
[4:35] compliment given and told to come and to
[4:37] buy things necessary
[4:38] to remedy their deficiencies it says
[4:40] behold i stand at the door
[4:42] and knock if any man hear my voice and
[4:44] open the door i will come into him
[4:46] and will sup with him and he with me and
[4:49] we saw how that this is christ on the
[4:51] outside of the church
[4:53] and so this is an invitation to come
[4:55] together with christ
[4:57] and those who are on the wrong side of
[4:59] this door as it were
[5:00] could not remain in that condition but
[5:02] christ on the outside
[5:04] is calling to this person to come out
[5:06] and come into communion with
[5:07] him and we're looking at who christ is
[5:10] the bread of life this fountain of life
[5:12] and how this invitation to those in
[5:14] laodicea
[5:15] uh to come out from amongst her and at
[5:18] the at his voice hearing this voice
[5:20] opening the door it's an invitation to
[5:22] partake of the bread of life
[5:24] it's an invitation to drink from the
[5:26] fountain of life
[5:27] and that if any man hear my voice it's
[5:30] that greek phoneme it looks like it's
[5:31] spelled phone or it's spelled p-h-o-n-e
[5:34] pronounced phonet it's the sound of
[5:36] uttered words it's
[5:37] it means it comes from the sense of
[5:39] bringing forth into light
[5:40] so there's a voice that leads us into
[5:42] light there's a voice that leads us into
[5:44] truth
[5:45] and here it says if any man hear my
[5:47] voice and can enter into this fellowship
[5:49] i will manifest myself to him i will sup
[5:52] with him
[5:52] and he will sup with me this sup is
[5:55] refers to a meal that served at the end
[5:57] of the day
[5:58] and so we're living in a time where the
[6:00] gentile ages are ceasing
[6:02] and just before this bride has
[6:03] translated god once again prepares a
[6:06] meal
[6:06] and a feast for his bride so it's the
[6:08] bride's last feast
[6:10] before the translation so we're going to
[6:12] go to what i would like to call a
[6:14] literal marriage supper
[6:16] in that we know that there is a wedding
[6:18] supper in the sky and it's not going to
[6:20] be like the banquets that we're used to
[6:22] here on earth i believe there's going to
[6:23] be
[6:24] there are symbolisms that are meant to
[6:25] it but there is going to be some kind of
[6:27] banquet or feasting or supper
[6:29] that is prepared in the sky and and when
[6:32] i say it's not like the feast we have
[6:33] here
[6:34] whatever disappointments if you don't
[6:35] like buffets don't dread the wedding
[6:37] supper
[6:38] it's not going to be like old country
[6:40] buffet or you know
[6:41] the great wall of china buffet it's
[6:43] going to be different
[6:44] it's going to be something that we can
[6:46] look forward to and so there's going to
[6:48] be a wedding supper in the sky we look
[6:50] to god interpret
[6:51] that by bringing it to pass but before
[6:53] we go to that meeting in the air
[6:54] there's a spiritual feast now for his
[6:56] bride there's something that we're
[6:58] feeding on there's something that's
[6:59] given us life
[7:00] and it's in that feast that the bride
[7:02] receives everything that she has need of
[7:04] to be translated
[7:06] so you've got to be partaking of that
[7:07] bread and partaking in that feast
[7:09] and in the rapture message brother
[7:11] branham referring to first thessalonians
[7:13] chapter 4 verse 16
[7:14] the shout the voice and the trump he
[7:16] says jesus does all three when he's
[7:18] descending
[7:19] a shout and he says what is the shout
[7:21] it's the message going forth first
[7:23] have we heard that message it's the
[7:25] messenger it's the message it's a
[7:26] it's a prophet of god with the message
[7:28] it's the message going forth first
[7:30] so that should tell us something about
[7:32] first thessalonians 4 16
[7:34] that should tell us something about the
[7:36] season that we're living in now
[7:37] it's the message and what is the message
[7:39] the living bread of life
[7:41] bringing forth the bride so as this
[7:44] living bread of life is made manifest it
[7:46] has
[7:47] it has this effect upon the elect to
[7:49] bring them forth
[7:51] it's going to call them forth it's going
[7:52] to stir them up and they're going to be
[7:54] ready to go out to meet him
[7:55] and so it's the living bread of life
[7:57] bringing forth the brine
[7:59] and so when we use this phrase come to
[8:01] bethlehem
[8:02] bethlehem is the house of god's bread
[8:05] and it being the house of god's bread
[8:06] today we have a bethlehem
[8:08] and and using this come to bethlehem as
[8:11] an invitation or a draw
[8:12] there is uh we want to recognize our
[8:16] spiritual feast today know exactly what
[8:19] feet table you're feeding from
[8:21] uh know where you're going to get the
[8:23] nutrients you need for this diet in the
[8:25] end time
[8:26] and and not and so that we're not
[8:27] without hope oh well where can i be fed
[8:29] and where can i get the things that i
[8:30] need and
[8:31] and maybe just to get serious about what
[8:33] you're feeding on
[8:34] because you better have a spiritual diet
[8:36] that's leading you to a body change
[8:38] uh if you just want a diet that'll keep
[8:40] you going to church you can find a lot
[8:41] of those
[8:43] right i mean this is no offense to uh to
[8:46] the chefs out there
[8:47] who are serving up food that keeps you
[8:48] going to church but that's not enough we
[8:50] need a message we need to be feeding on
[8:52] something that's going to take us to a
[8:53] body
[8:54] change and be serious about that be
[8:55] serious about the things we're feeding
[8:57] on the things that we're listening to
[8:58] and our spiritual feasts so this we have
[9:01] been invited come to bethlehem there's
[9:02] been a fountain opened up there's been a
[9:04] doorway opened up
[9:05] to a spiritual feast in this end time
[9:08] and as brother of adam refers to it as
[9:10] the living bread of life if you could
[9:12] look at ruth chapter 1 verse 6
[9:14] i want to just pick up right after our
[9:16] text
[9:18] and just read the next verse because as
[9:19] it tells us these first five verses are
[9:22] just full of
[9:23] sadness and darkness and then so naomi
[9:27] being the only one left of her family
[9:29] and that she left with her husband and
[9:30] two sons her husband and two sons die
[9:32] it says in verse six then she arose with
[9:34] her daughters-in-law
[9:36] that she might return from the country
[9:38] of moab now notice what
[9:40] is what draws her to leave moab
[9:43] for she had heard in the country of moab
[9:46] how that the lord had visited his people
[9:48] in giving them bread and so
[9:51] as we read in ruth chapter one and we
[9:54] read the first
[9:55] several verses those first five verses
[9:57] we see that immediately
[9:58] famine is what sets the scene so as the
[10:02] painter is trying to paint a picture as
[10:03] a storyteller is trying to set the mood
[10:05] and the tone
[10:06] it begins that there is a famine in the
[10:08] land and there's a famine there in
[10:10] bethlehem judah and we'll
[10:11] look at that in specific detail tonight
[10:13] so it's this famine that sets the scene
[10:15] but this is the part i want us to catch
[10:17] as we're being forward looking and why
[10:19] we're even using this story
[10:21] it may be darkness and death that opens
[10:23] the story famine that introduces us to
[10:25] to naomi and then ultimately to ruth but
[10:28] it's the lord's visitation with bread
[10:30] that brings ruth to bethlehem
[10:33] it's not well it's not working out in
[10:35] moab and my family's dead let's go try
[10:37] somewhere else but there was a message
[10:39] and something had reached naomi where
[10:41] she was and she was drawn
[10:43] back to bethlehem with this announcement
[10:46] that the lord had visited her people
[10:48] in this time with bread so think of this
[10:51] this revelation and this type
[10:53] how it's not just a story that well god
[10:55] brought you out of egypt and there's a
[10:57] promised land it wasn't just something
[10:59] rehearsed in their ears of well there's
[11:00] this judge and there's this person and
[11:02] there's that person
[11:03] it wasn't even that a prophet was in the
[11:05] land but it was actually a message
[11:07] that the lord had visited the promised
[11:09] people had visited her people
[11:11] and he did so in giving them bread so
[11:14] this is exactly what the lord himself
[11:16] does in this end time
[11:18] it's not just it's just not a one-man
[11:20] ministry where it's just well god sent
[11:22] another gift to the church like one of
[11:24] the five-fold
[11:25] but it's a revelation that jesus christ
[11:27] has visited his bride
[11:29] and is giving them bread and that is
[11:32] what it's that visitation it's the
[11:34] lord's visitation
[11:35] that brings naomi and ultimately really
[11:38] what the focus of the story is ruth
[11:40] to back to bethlehem and so it says in
[11:43] verse 22
[11:43] so naomi returned and ruth the moabitus
[11:48] her daughter-in-law with her which
[11:50] returned out of the country of moab
[11:53] and they came to bethlehem in the
[11:55] beginning
[11:56] of barley harvest this is another
[11:58] important detail about this story and
[12:00] i'm
[12:01] using these these these readings as my
[12:04] thought has been on the bread of life
[12:05] which satisfies the bride's hunger
[12:07] that's what we need to be feeding on in
[12:08] order to be fed in order to be satisfied
[12:10] in order to be grown and maturing and we
[12:13] see then in ruth chapter 1 that the lord
[12:14] had visited giving them the bread of
[12:16] life
[12:17] and when naomi and ruth return back to
[12:19] bethlehem they come
[12:21] in the beginning of the barley harvest
[12:24] so as naomi returns and ruth with her
[12:26] she doesn't come during a time of famine
[12:29] she's not coming back and the story is
[12:30] naomi's saying hey look we're going back
[12:32] to this place and it's dry and it's
[12:34] going to be difficult and it's going to
[12:35] be tough and it's going to be worse than
[12:36] it was in moab no
[12:38] i believe that naomi would have had the
[12:40] testimony there's bread there
[12:42] there's substance there i can come back
[12:44] even though i'm coming back
[12:45] a left full and i'm coming back empty
[12:47] i'm coming back to a place
[12:49] where i know that god has given
[12:50] provision there's going to be something
[12:51] there to sustain me
[12:52] and she would have had a positive report
[12:54] to give ruth as they were traveling on
[12:56] they come
[12:57] during not during a time of famine but
[12:59] they could come let's use this phrase
[13:01] they come during harvest time
[13:04] they come here at the beginning of
[13:05] barley harvest and the barley was what
[13:07] matured first and
[13:09] and coming at this time she's actually
[13:11] arriving at the time
[13:12] of the feast of unleavened bread
[13:14] arriving at a time of the passover feast
[13:16] and the passover celebration
[13:18] so this is the time that ruth comes to
[13:21] bethlehem
[13:22] this is we see naomi returning but since
[13:24] the story is about ruth this moabitess
[13:26] this gentile woman
[13:27] think about how she is such a type of
[13:29] those of us who've come
[13:31] for such a time as this we're not coming
[13:33] in a time where it's just going to be
[13:34] another
[13:35] planting and growing and this but we've
[13:37] come for harvest time
[13:39] we haven't come in at the time of
[13:41] another cycle but we've come at the end
[13:43] where there's going to be a rapture so
[13:45] this is a type of our
[13:46] personal spiritual feast of the word in
[13:49] the rapture season
[13:51] and this is what sets us up uh this is
[13:53] what draws me to these things and on the
[13:55] subject of being hungry
[13:57] in the bread of life is ruth comes
[13:59] because the living bread of life had
[14:01] been brought to israel
[14:02] the lord had visited his people and
[14:04] giving them bread and as ruth comes
[14:06] she's just following naomi she comes
[14:08] she comes right at the beginning of
[14:10] harvest time right in the barley harvest
[14:13] and so with that kind of connecting us
[14:16] to where we've been
[14:17] and and some of the services here i want
[14:20] to just begin by looking at the book of
[14:21] ruth
[14:23] and and slowing down and going through
[14:24] some of these verses in this in this
[14:27] uh wonderful story the book is uh
[14:30] it's a remarkable story a very
[14:32] remarkable story
[14:33] which as we've read tonight begins with
[14:35] famine and death
[14:38] as you read it's the first things you
[14:39] read in the first five verses there's
[14:40] three people that are dead there's a
[14:42] famine
[14:42] um there's three widows it's a very very
[14:44] dark story it's a story that begins with
[14:46] famine and death
[14:47] but the story ends in redemption in life
[14:50] it may open with what would be three
[14:52] funerals in a famine but it ends with
[14:54] the marriage and the bringing forth of a
[14:55] son
[14:56] so when you look at this it opens up
[14:58] very darkly but it ends very gloriously
[15:00] and there's a lot of different pieces
[15:02] where this sets within the context of
[15:04] scripture
[15:05] which is instructive to us to catch the
[15:07] revelation that's contained in this book
[15:09] to encourage us and to settle us and and
[15:12] to give us a greater inspiration for the
[15:14] word of god
[15:15] the book of ruth is set between judges
[15:17] and samuel
[15:18] and so you have even the book of joshua
[15:20] which is
[15:21] the book of ephesians to the old
[15:23] testament then you have the book of
[15:24] judges
[15:25] and then you have the book of samuel and
[15:28] and and we may get into this in more
[15:29] detail later but the book of samuel
[15:31] is what is placing anointing david to be
[15:34] king and setting him
[15:35] in his position so you can see that this
[15:38] would even relate to
[15:39] the reign of the son of david which is
[15:41] is not the son of man but the son of
[15:43] david in the millennium
[15:44] and you have this time of the judges
[15:46] where we'll touch on this tonight this
[15:48] lawlessness
[15:49] but in comes ruth and so then ruth then
[15:51] speaks of the bride's position in christ
[15:54] just before the millennium even after
[15:56] the lawlessness of the church ages or
[15:58] even laodicea
[16:00] and so this book ruth sets between
[16:02] judges and samuel
[16:03] and in it being set here and placed here
[16:05] divinely by god
[16:06] it relates to your positional placing
[16:09] speaks to how god places you
[16:12] and as you read it you can think oh it's
[16:14] a beautiful love story about ruth and
[16:16] boaz and it does
[16:17] it does ring in a lot of ways of some
[16:19] romanticism and
[16:21] and a wonderful love story and i'll say
[16:23] this about this love story
[16:25] is it's true so if you want to read a
[16:28] love story and get real faith this is
[16:30] the one you want to read some of these
[16:32] uh christian fiction that tells love
[16:34] stories let me just be honest with you
[16:36] if you just want to say that's just
[16:37] brother aaron's opinion that's fine
[16:39] but if it's made up and it's fiction you
[16:42] can't really get faith out of that
[16:43] how are you going to derive faith from a
[16:45] man-made narrative that this happened
[16:47] and that happened and that's why these
[16:48] two people fell in love
[16:49] and so that gives me faith to believe i
[16:51] can find love not in that
[16:53] that's a man-made story there's no faith
[16:56] that you can
[16:56] you anchor on a fiction to get more
[16:59] faith to believe that god's going to
[17:00] provide for you
[17:01] and listen god has provided us not
[17:03] fables but truth
[17:05] provided us something that we can read
[17:07] provided us the word of the hour
[17:09] testimonies of the saints
[17:10] other people that can testify well i was
[17:12] praying he granted me this and
[17:14] i kept myself true and it took a while
[17:16] but i got married at this
[17:17] age and that's where you can draw real
[17:19] inspiration and faith is from the truth
[17:21] and so this is a love story that can
[17:23] maybe give different ones confidence and
[17:25] faith to believe but it's more than just
[17:28] a love story but it foreshadows the
[17:31] greatest love story
[17:32] and that way it's more than just a love
[17:34] story but it's a foreshadowing of the
[17:36] greatest love story
[17:37] and it speaks of the romance between
[17:39] christ and his bride
[17:41] such a beautiful beautiful story and
[17:43] there's a truth for us to catch in this
[17:45] tremendous truth there's a lot of types
[17:47] that we can bring out in this
[17:49] but there's a way that the believer can
[17:50] see himself in these stages of ruth
[17:53] there's a way that we can see the church
[17:54] in the stages of ruth there's uh the the
[17:57] gentile bride is brought into view and
[17:59] there's a representation of israel a
[18:00] representation
[18:01] of the gentile church and so there's a
[18:03] truth for us to catch
[18:04] and i'm wanting to use this emphasis
[18:06] that there's a revelation of god's
[18:08] provision and care
[18:09] for his elect there was something
[18:12] wherein
[18:13] ruth represents the believer
[18:16] represents the gentile believer and this
[18:18] this book
[18:19] speaks of god's elective love for her
[18:22] think of that it speaks of his elective
[18:24] love for her that in the in the outcome
[18:26] and i feel like i'm just getting
[18:28] so inspired on you as well to it's just
[18:30] kind of pulling me
[18:31] pulling me raby to the climax or to the
[18:33] real end of the story
[18:34] but think about it it opens with famine
[18:37] this is a terrible famine
[18:38] then there's a death and then there's
[18:40] two more deaths there's a famine there's
[18:41] three deaths there's three widows
[18:43] and what is god doing it for it's his
[18:45] elective love for ruth
[18:47] that allows all these things to happen
[18:49] because he wants to bring another
[18:50] gentile
[18:51] right into the lineage of jesus christ
[18:55] to do what to give us hope to give us
[18:56] courage to see that how god deals
[18:59] with his elect and he does it through
[19:01] election
[19:02] and that's what we trust in that's what
[19:04] we rest in is god's elective love my
[19:06] it's so beautiful
[19:08] i want to read a few statements here
[19:10] just before we transition to ruth
[19:12] chapter one verse one and start going
[19:13] through
[19:14] phrase by phrase tonight notice how
[19:17] brother branham in just a few places
[19:18] speaking about the book of ruth
[19:21] uh he in revelations chapter five part
[19:23] two
[19:24] and this is when he preaches the
[19:25] revelation of jesus christ
[19:27] which is where the church age book is
[19:29] derived from or a lot of the
[19:30] the writings uh of the church age book
[19:33] are taken from the series called the
[19:34] revelation of jesus christ
[19:36] that he preached in 1961. so this is
[19:38] revelations chapter five part two
[19:40] and he refers to the book of ruth and
[19:42] he's talking about ruth being a
[19:43] wonderful book more than a love story
[19:45] and then he says this
[19:46] oh if anybody says that the bible wasn't
[19:49] inspired there's something wrong with
[19:50] them
[19:52] every word of it is inspired
[19:55] every word of it fits right together
[19:57] just like a dovetail on a plank
[20:00] it goes perfectly together like the cogs
[20:02] on a mighty wheel turning
[20:05] just time to the millionth of a second
[20:07] just exactly right
[20:09] that's beautiful mechanics that that's a
[20:12] wonderful craftsmanship for him to say
[20:14] that it fits wonderfully to get dovetail
[20:16] like on a plank and there's you see some
[20:18] of the carpentry
[20:20] even ancient carpentry where joints were
[20:22] done where things would feather together
[20:24] and you'd look at it and it's squared
[20:26] off
[20:26] but you can't even tell where the joint
[20:28] is and they're not using glue they're
[20:30] not using screws they're not even using
[20:32] mechanical equipment
[20:33] but a craftsman can do things in such a
[20:35] way where they join and feather together
[20:37] and it's perfectly joint he says like a
[20:39] plank
[20:40] he's and that's how our bible is it's
[20:42] exactly how he says it goes perfectly
[20:44] together like cogs on a mighty will
[20:46] turning just time to the millionth of a
[20:48] second
[20:49] and his inspiration for the statement is
[20:51] looking at the book of ruth
[20:53] so he sees something in this story in
[20:55] the book of ruth that dovetails with the
[20:57] story of redemption
[20:58] that doves tells with the with the
[21:00] picture that god is painting through the
[21:01] entire bible
[21:03] then in the sermon redeemer redemption
[21:06] he says redemption
[21:07] beautiful story of redemption i believe
[21:09] for the next few moments let's view
[21:11] something
[21:14] a beautiful little story comes into my
[21:16] mind
[21:17] a book that's short in the bible and
[21:20] gives out the very lines of redemption
[21:23] and that's the book of ruth there's a
[21:26] book in the bible that gives out the
[21:27] very lines
[21:29] of redemption the lines of redemption i
[21:31] don't know
[21:32] maybe how that would strike you but you
[21:33] could say it's the lines
[21:35] it's the it's the script it's the
[21:38] screenplay it's something that was
[21:40] written the very lines that are going to
[21:41] be played out the very rehearsing uh
[21:44] the very plot the very story lines of
[21:46] redemption
[21:47] are given out in the book of ruth the
[21:49] whole thing is foreshadowed the whole
[21:51] thing is spoken beforehand
[21:52] the very lines are the boundaries of the
[21:54] foundation or the breadth and the height
[21:56] and the depth
[21:57] that is redemption are spelled out and
[21:59] portrayed here in the book of ruth
[22:02] it's just a short story but he calls it
[22:03] a beautiful little story that comes to
[22:05] mind
[22:06] that's short in the bible it gives out
[22:07] the very lines of redemption
[22:09] and that's the book of ruth many people
[22:11] just pass over that book
[22:14] people are reading and they say oh
[22:15] joshua judges ruth oh isn't that funny
[22:17] it sounds like a sentence and they just
[22:19] kind of
[22:19] pass right over what we got to get from
[22:21] the judges to the book of samuel
[22:23] and there's a lot of people that look at
[22:24] this and say well it's a very
[22:26] uh and it does stand for this i found
[22:29] this to be very remarkable that you read
[22:31] through the book of judges
[22:33] and you're covering a lot of years and a
[22:34] lot of different instances and a lot of
[22:36] different overlap and it's a lot of
[22:38] terrible things that are recited and you
[22:40] really hear about the battles and the
[22:41] disobedience
[22:42] but then with this book all of a sudden
[22:44] you kind of get a picture of daily life
[22:46] as a matter of fact there's certain
[22:47] instances that are unfolding where it's
[22:49] as if you're getting this
[22:50] an hour-by-hour account of something
[22:52] that begins to happen in the evening and
[22:54] overnight and the next day
[22:56] and so it's kind of a peak into the
[22:57] domestic life of the israelites at that
[22:59] time
[22:59] but it's so much more than that he says
[23:02] a lot of people just pass over that book
[23:05] but it's the most beautiful story of the
[23:07] lord jesus almost of the old testament
[23:10] the most beautiful story of the old the
[23:12] of the lord jesus
[23:14] almost of the old testament so this is
[23:16] what this book stands for
[23:18] it's inspired it fits together it
[23:19] dovetails with the story of redemption
[23:21] it
[23:22] gives out the very lines of redemption
[23:23] many people may just pass over it but
[23:25] it's the most beautiful story of the
[23:27] lord jesus almost
[23:28] of the old testament and the sermon god
[23:31] is
[23:32] god has a provided way he says in the
[23:35] book of ruth
[23:36] many of you run over the top of that
[23:37] book not thinking what it is
[23:40] oh it's just a historical record it's
[23:41] just a kind of peak into the daily life
[23:43] of
[23:44] of the israelites at the time of the
[23:46] judges but it says
[23:47] many of you run over the top of that not
[23:49] thinking of what it is that's one of the
[23:51] most greatest stories in there of a type
[23:53] of christ
[23:54] in all the old testament now
[23:57] there's not brother branham is not alone
[23:59] in speaking of this there's a lot of
[24:01] commentators that
[24:02] pointed this out there's a lot a lot of
[24:04] people that saw these parallels and
[24:05] speaking of redemption
[24:08] but i want you to consider now for a
[24:09] moment that what brother brahms trying
[24:11] to point out
[24:11] isn't just what would be common he's not
[24:15] one to say oh well we can look back in
[24:16] retrospect and see that
[24:18] christ is our near kinsman and he's a
[24:19] kinsmen redeemer
[24:21] and boaz in playing this part of
[24:22] redeeming ruth
[24:24] was playing the part of christ there's
[24:26] something in this that can be
[24:28] go there this this type let me say this
[24:30] way
[24:31] this can become a revelation to you and
[24:33] it's more than just the
[24:34] the connecting the dots of a type like
[24:37] if it can become a revelation to you
[24:39] it's more than just saying
[24:40] oh well there's god is perfected in
[24:43] threes or seven is the number of
[24:44] completion and there's three of this and
[24:45] there's seven of that
[24:46] and you see these different types lining
[24:48] up and all this happened and that
[24:49] happened
[24:50] and things seem to kind of fit on a
[24:52] theological theological realm but when
[24:54] it becomes a revelation to you
[24:56] it's not even the type anymore that gets
[24:57] you excited it's the truth that does
[25:00] and remember as believers we find truth
[25:03] first
[25:03] and then the types stand out to us we
[25:06] don't look at something and say
[25:07] how can i get a type out of this oh this
[25:09] is neat this there's got to be a type
[25:11] here you read about a technology
[25:12] you read about an invention you read
[25:14] about a biological process you read
[25:16] about some sickness or
[25:17] you read about some study and go oh
[25:19] there's a perfect type here no
[25:20] you want to see truth and then once you
[25:22] see truth types can just start lining up
[25:25] so first have a solid grasp of truth and
[25:28] once you have a solid grasp of truth
[25:30] you can begin to see the types and so
[25:32] what this
[25:33] is what we'll do is not look at the book
[25:35] of ruth so that we can just mine out
[25:37] types hoping to find truth
[25:38] but with the revelation that you've
[25:40] received begin to begin to see
[25:42] these types begin to line up and it get
[25:44] more rich and more rich to you
[25:45] and more inspiring and more thrilling to
[25:47] see that god has been foreshadowing your
[25:50] calling
[25:50] since even the time when this book was
[25:52] written
[25:55] now ruth chapter 1 verse 1.
[25:58] and so it's 7 47 time to take off
[26:02] ruth chapter 1 verse 1. we're just going
[26:04] to take it phrase by phrase
[26:06] uh and um just to look at the first
[26:09] verse here
[26:11] to get set the scene for the book of
[26:12] roots so remember it's a it gives the
[26:14] very lines of redemption it's the most
[26:15] beautiful story of jesus christ almost
[26:17] one of the
[26:18] most greatest stories there is of the
[26:19] type of christ
[26:21] and so as in ruth chapter one verse 1
[26:23] now it came to pass
[26:25] in the days when the judges ruled
[26:28] i want to focus on this statement here
[26:31] in this time period here it's the days
[26:33] when the judges ruled as
[26:37] if you read the book of judges you'll
[26:40] find that it was a time of anarchy
[26:43] for the children of israel at times it
[26:45] was a time of oppression
[26:47] and it was a specific time period when
[26:49] israel was not ruled by kings
[26:51] and so not being ruled by kings they
[26:53] were ruled by judges
[26:55] and one of the one phrase i want to
[26:57] share with you that speaks about this
[26:58] particular time is in judges chapter 17
[27:01] verse 6.
[27:02] and it's mentioned in a few places in
[27:03] the book of judges but i think just one
[27:05] uh one scripture will suffice it says in
[27:07] those days there was no king in israel
[27:09] so this
[27:10] characterizes the time of judges
[27:13] is there's no king in israel and this is
[27:16] what's
[27:16] interesting about the use of elimelech
[27:18] because elimelech means my god my king
[27:21] and so here is one element like it would
[27:23] stand for the proposition
[27:25] that although there is no earthly
[27:26] monarchy to israel
[27:28] israel should have been looking to god
[27:30] as their king my god my king
[27:32] and so it's during a time wherein there
[27:34] is no king in israel
[27:36] but every man and this is not a
[27:38] compliment every man did that which was
[27:40] right
[27:40] in his own eyes so this is this is a
[27:44] judgment of israel that there had been a
[27:46] prophet there had been a law
[27:48] and there was responsibilities given out
[27:50] to each tribe
[27:51] there was boundaries that they were to
[27:53] possess there was a way that they were
[27:54] to regard those that possessed
[27:56] that lived within these borders in this
[27:58] promised land and they were to keep god
[28:00] the one true god he was to be their king
[28:03] and it says every man did that which was
[28:05] right in his own eyes
[28:06] it means he was merely doing what he
[28:09] wanted on the terms that he felt was
[28:11] right
[28:12] and if you read the book of judges
[28:14] judges describes
[28:15] israel's wavering faithfulness where
[28:18] they would be hot for jehovah they'd be
[28:19] called for jehovah
[28:20] and actually just kind of shows they're
[28:22] swinging from jehovah to baal
[28:24] and they go from serving him to fallen
[28:25] away serving him to fallen away
[28:27] and this is kind of the story of judges
[28:29] it tells the story of israel's
[28:31] fallen away from god and failing to keep
[28:33] his commandments they were given a word
[28:35] keep the commandments
[28:36] do these things and israel fell away
[28:37] from them as they every man did
[28:39] that which was right in his own eyes and
[28:41] they began to fall away god would send
[28:43] them not
[28:44] prophets necessarily but god would send
[28:46] them delivers
[28:47] that would be raised up and in doing so
[28:50] it caused the nation to seek him again
[28:52] and they would get a little bit of
[28:53] relief in their bondage and that's the
[28:55] story of judges they fall away a judge
[28:56] comes and kind of stirs them up to
[28:59] faithfulness or
[29:00] relieves them of their oppressors
[29:02] delivers them from these other nations
[29:04] and the nation kind of turns for a
[29:05] moment back to god we're going to serve
[29:07] you we're going to do these things right
[29:08] but it was
[29:08] up and down and up and down and this is
[29:11] the time period
[29:13] that the book of ruth is portraying it's
[29:16] written after the time the judges
[29:17] but the story that's portrayed here
[29:20] takes place during the time when judges
[29:22] ruled
[29:23] and the next phrase it says in now it
[29:26] came to pass in the days when the judges
[29:28] ruled
[29:29] that there was a famine in the land so
[29:32] there's two things that immediately the
[29:33] writer wants you to begin to ponder
[29:35] and to kind of frame the story of ruth
[29:38] is that it was a time when judges ruled
[29:40] and in particular a time when there was
[29:42] a famine in the land
[29:44] so as we begin to think about famine
[29:45] we've looked into the scripture and
[29:46] found that there come a time so we could
[29:48] see a type here
[29:49] how that there would be famine but not
[29:50] for water for bread but for hearing the
[29:52] word of god so there's a spiritual
[29:54] application and spiritual type
[29:56] where we see a famine in the natural
[29:58] that came upon israel
[29:59] there's a way that this could relate in
[30:01] a time of a spiritual famine
[30:04] and as there's a famine we should
[30:05] immediately think of hunger
[30:07] and that famine hunger that rises to a
[30:10] level of famine where one is famished or
[30:12] a famine that is in the land we have to
[30:14] think how that there's an instinct for
[30:16] survival that kicks in
[30:18] where the bible talks about times of
[30:19] famine and siege where mothers were
[30:21] actually eating their children
[30:23] and that has to be a terrible
[30:24] desperation that would bring someone to
[30:26] a place where they would begin to do
[30:28] that and commit those atrocities
[30:30] we see how that there was a famine in
[30:31] the time of uh uh
[30:33] israel where a widow woman was going to
[30:35] bake the last cake and the last piece of
[30:37] meal
[30:38] and that was going to be it before she
[30:40] died and here comes elijah long
[30:42] to say she he is sustained by this widow
[30:44] woman this widow of zeraphath
[30:46] and the woman believe when i bake this
[30:48] for me and my son we're going to
[30:50] die because that's what famine does so
[30:53] we're thinking about hunger we're
[30:54] thinking about uh
[30:55] a a a desperate hunger that would be
[30:58] setting
[30:59] in and now if you could just
[31:02] i realize that i just i have some your
[31:05] your pull tonight is
[31:06] is especially strong so i kind of have
[31:08] this energy just to preach
[31:10] and and i'm really just wanting just to
[31:12] point some scriptures out more in
[31:13] in a way of doing a teaching but
[31:16] ponder this as it says there was a
[31:18] famine in the land
[31:21] god promised a fruitful land to israel
[31:23] if they were obedient
[31:25] right i mean this was there was a way
[31:27] that canaan was described and there was
[31:29] evidence that was brought back by the
[31:30] spies that went in and here's this
[31:32] here's the evidence of the land it's a
[31:34] good land it's full of abundance and
[31:36] and wealth and riches and so god had
[31:38] promised that the land would be fruitful
[31:40] if they were obedient so if there's a
[31:43] famine
[31:43] in israel what does that tell us that
[31:46] israel had disobeyed
[31:49] and when israel disobeyed god would
[31:50] allow israel's enemies to oppress them
[31:53] and in oppressing them they would take
[31:55] of their harvest and take it to their
[31:56] harvest they would destroy the land
[31:58] and it wouldn't be because their enemies
[31:59] were greater and it wouldn't be because
[32:01] israel
[32:01] wasn't worthy and it wouldn't be because
[32:04] uh god didn't love them but it would be
[32:05] directly connected to their fidelity to
[32:08] the promise that god had given them
[32:10] and he'd made this covenant with israel
[32:11] if you'll do this i'll look out after
[32:13] you
[32:13] if you'll do this i'll drive your enemy
[32:15] out so god had made the promise that
[32:17] israel would be fruitful
[32:18] and that their land would be rich and
[32:20] abundant and if there's a time of famine
[32:22] it tells us
[32:23] that israel had fallen in their part not
[32:25] god on his part
[32:27] it says in the in judges chapter 6
[32:30] and there's some that believe that this
[32:32] might have been the exact
[32:34] time period that uh the book of ruth
[32:38] transpires
[32:38] is in the time of gideon
[32:43] and knowing that boaz was born of rahab
[32:46] you would
[32:46] there have to be some proximity um
[32:50] in terms of these years that would kind
[32:52] of connect some of these events together
[32:55] and and i'm not necessarily using this
[32:57] to make the claim
[32:58] that this is the exact time and the time
[33:00] of gideon is when roof
[33:02] uh came to no boaz but rather just as an
[33:04] example in the time of ruth
[33:06] how that disobedience brought famine and
[33:09] i think this is instructive to us to
[33:11] remember this
[33:12] judges chapter 6 verses 1 to 4 and the
[33:14] children of israel did evil in the sight
[33:16] of the lord
[33:17] and the lord delivered them unto the
[33:19] hand of the midian seven years
[33:20] now what's the order of this they
[33:23] weren't delivered into the hand of the
[33:24] midians and then begin to do evil
[33:27] so it's not that the enemy overcame them
[33:28] and overwhelmed them and they fell and
[33:30] then they were
[33:30] fell away from their faithfulness but
[33:32] rather they did evil in the sight of the
[33:33] lord and in doing so god's protection
[33:35] was taken away from them
[33:36] for the point of dealing with them
[33:39] getting their attention
[33:40] and so they're delivered in the hand of
[33:42] the media in seven years and the hand of
[33:43] the media prevailed against israel
[33:45] and because of the midianites the
[33:46] children of israel made them that
[33:48] made them the dens which are in the
[33:50] mountains in caves and strongholds
[33:52] and so it was when israel had sown that
[33:55] the midians came up
[33:56] in the amalekites and the children of
[33:58] the east and even they came up against
[34:00] them
[34:01] and they had camped against them and
[34:03] destroyed the increase of the earth till
[34:05] thou
[34:06] come and come into gaza and left no
[34:09] substance sustenance for israel neither
[34:11] sheep nor ox nor ass
[34:13] so how does this begin israel does evil
[34:16] on the side of the lord
[34:17] they're delivered to the hand of the
[34:18] midians and for these seven years the
[34:20] midianites the amalekites the children
[34:22] of the east
[34:22] they come and after israel has planted
[34:25] and after israel has watered and
[34:27] and worked with and tilled and brought
[34:29] their their crops to a harvest
[34:31] then came down all of these and they
[34:33] destroyed the increase of the earth
[34:35] so they they were farming for their
[34:37] enemies
[34:38] they were planting they were sowing they
[34:40] were hoeing they were doing everything
[34:41] they needed to do
[34:42] to have fruit and have increased but at
[34:44] the harvest time
[34:45] they the their increase was destroyed
[34:47] and there was no sustenance left for
[34:49] israel
[34:50] not even uh animal not even sheep uh
[34:54] not even ox nor ass there all these
[34:56] things were taken from them
[34:57] and all of israel's labored was stripped
[34:59] away
[35:00] why because israel had failed god's
[35:02] promises
[35:04] and famine was one of the four judgments
[35:05] that god declared
[35:08] decreed that he would punish israel with
[35:09] if they sinned
[35:11] says it this way in ezekiel chapter 14
[35:13] verse 13 god
[35:15] god speaks to the son of man and he says
[35:16] son of man when the land sinneth against
[35:19] me by trespassing grievously
[35:21] then will i stretch out my hand upon it
[35:24] it will break the staff of the bread
[35:26] thereof
[35:27] and will send famine upon it and will
[35:30] cut off
[35:31] man and beast from it so this is what
[35:34] god says he will do
[35:35] whenever the land sins grievously
[35:38] against him
[35:39] when they sin grievously he'll break the
[35:41] staff of bread that means their
[35:42] their labor will not produce a fruitful
[35:44] harvest it'll be taken from they'll
[35:46] break the increase of their labor
[35:47] break the staff of bread i will send
[35:49] famine upon it i will cut off man
[35:51] and beast from it and this is exactly
[35:54] what happens in the book of judges they
[35:56] destroyed the increase of the earth till
[35:58] there was no sustenance left for israel
[36:00] neither sheep nor ox nor ass this is
[36:02] exactly what happened
[36:04] so just part of this this is something
[36:06] instructive that we can take from the
[36:08] word of god tonight
[36:10] that famine indicates a disobedience
[36:13] that famine is a red flag famine is a
[36:16] signal famine is something that god
[36:17] would want to use to get your attention
[36:20] that there's more for you to be enjoying
[36:22] or there's some way that he's trying to
[36:24] get your attention that something lacks
[36:25] or there's sin or there's air
[36:27] and so it's something that we can take a
[36:28] step back and take personal ownership of
[36:30] our lives
[36:31] and where we are where we're feeding
[36:33] what we're doing what we're listening to
[36:34] what we're watching what we're joined
[36:36] with what we're supporting
[36:37] and ask ourselves whether or not i am
[36:40] actually in the right
[36:41] lane in the right place in the right
[36:43] field doing what i ought to do
[36:45] because god uses famine to get his
[36:47] people where they need to be
[36:49] he says i'll do it where they sin where
[36:51] they trespass and think about this
[36:53] canaan what was it known as
[36:55] the land flowing with milk and honey
[36:59] this is how it's described i mean this
[37:01] is this is what the pictures on
[37:03] a trip advisor would be this is what the
[37:05] pictures would be on airbnb or verbo
[37:07] like
[37:08] this place is flowing with milk and
[37:09] honey and everywhere milk everywhere
[37:11] honey everywhere grape clusters they're
[37:12] sized where
[37:13] men have to carry them over their
[37:15] shoulders and this would kind of be your
[37:17] image of what the promised land would be
[37:18] and could you imagine if these are all
[37:20] the stories you told and then you
[37:22] showed up at a time like this you say
[37:24] well i think i was
[37:25] uh i think i've been lied to and i was
[37:27] told that it was going to be beautiful
[37:29] and there would be a
[37:30] ah what an infinity pool and the weather
[37:32] would be perfectly 78 degrees every day
[37:34] and
[37:35] and they would have this and it would
[37:36] have that it was going to be awesome and
[37:37] glorious and be perfectly instagramable
[37:40] vacation
[37:40] but man this is horrible this is awful
[37:42] this isn't good this is
[37:44] and who would be at fault not the
[37:46] photographer
[37:48] not the one that not the one that gave
[37:49] the listing not the one that had the
[37:51] original reviews that came by the spies
[37:53] that went in and checked out the land it
[37:54] would be israel's fault
[37:57] they let it fall into disrepair they let
[37:59] it become something
[38:00] that it was really wasn't or less than
[38:01] what its potential was through their own
[38:03] disobedience the land which was
[38:05] flowing with milk and honey had become a
[38:08] wasteland
[38:09] and it was israel's responsibility you
[38:12] say well god's the one that caused it
[38:14] yes
[38:14] but why because israel failed
[38:18] he said in leviticus leviticus chapter
[38:20] 26 verses 18 to 20.
[38:24] again this is prior to them entering
[38:28] into the promised land or before they
[38:30] enter in
[38:32] i was taught in law school to not say
[38:33] prior to if you could say before
[38:36] because prior two is two words and if
[38:37] you could say something in one word you
[38:38] want to say it in one word for
[38:40] prior two is just trying to be fancy
[38:41] right it's what you would expect a
[38:44] lawyer to say but i was
[38:45] taught in law school to simplify
[38:47] simplify simplify
[38:49] so before this is before uh we come to
[38:52] the book of ruth this is instructions as
[38:54] they're entering in before they enter in
[38:56] it says and if you will not yet for all
[38:59] and if you will not yet for all if
[39:02] this hearken unto me if you will not
[39:04] listen to him and do what he ask
[39:06] then i will punish you seven times more
[39:08] for your sins
[39:10] okay all right you talk about things
[39:12] being unjust and not fair well
[39:14] you're punishing me seven times worth
[39:15] that because this is this is what god
[39:17] will do
[39:19] notice what he says i will break the
[39:20] pride of your power
[39:22] i will make your heaven as iron in your
[39:24] earth as brass
[39:25] and your strength shall be spent in vain
[39:28] this is speaking directly about their
[39:29] labor the earth being as brass is what
[39:31] they can get out of it and they're
[39:32] cultivating
[39:33] for your land shall not yield her
[39:35] increase neither shall the trees of the
[39:37] land yield their fruits
[39:40] i hope this paints a picture for you
[39:42] when you read now it came to pass
[39:44] in in the days when the judges ruled
[39:46] that there was a famine in the land
[39:48] that that should not just be oh there
[39:50] was a downturn in the market or there
[39:51] was a market correction there's some
[39:53] consolidation happening and
[39:55] and and it became a a bear market and
[39:57] the bull market was over and all the
[39:59] interest rates were going up and all
[40:01] that's not though it was happening
[40:02] this is a famine brought by god as a
[40:04] result of israel's disobedience
[40:07] so time of disobedience in a time of
[40:09] betraying the things of god and turning
[40:11] their back on the things of god
[40:12] there was a suffering that took place
[40:14] there was a uh there was a
[40:16] judgment that was being met out and if
[40:18] you take the time of gideon to be
[40:20] instructive in this time
[40:21] it was then that god raised up gideon
[40:23] and gideon then went out
[40:25] and destroyed and chased away and
[40:27] relieved israel of this burden
[40:29] by turning them back to god and
[40:31] delivering them of their oppressors and
[40:32] their enemies
[40:33] and so god has their way of bringing
[40:35] these things back
[40:36] but as we read about it now came to pass
[40:38] in the days when the judges ruled that
[40:40] there was a famine in the land
[40:42] this is why there was a famine in the
[40:44] land
[40:45] the very next phrase in a certain man of
[40:48] bethlehem judah
[40:49] the certain man is elimelech he is the
[40:53] husband of naomi
[40:55] his name meaning my god my king
[40:58] he came from bethlehem judah bethlehem
[41:01] judah is used to distinguish
[41:03] from bethlehem of zebulon but this
[41:06] phrase means
[41:07] the house of bread and praise
[41:11] here's a man who's living in a place
[41:12] called the house of bread and praise the
[41:14] house of god's praise
[41:16] the house of god's bread and in a time
[41:19] of famine there's a certain man
[41:20] of bethlehem judah now we know
[41:24] we know that what begins to take place
[41:25] so we can make this
[41:27] comment now
[41:30] that the impact on bethlehem
[41:33] is what makes this famine so striking
[41:36] why was it called bethlehem as a very
[41:38] fertile place
[41:40] it was bethlehem because it was rich and
[41:42] it had good soil and
[41:43] it produced abundant crops and it was
[41:45] kind of like a bread basket it'd be like
[41:47] when we think about
[41:48] uh the midwest or different places in
[41:50] america he said this is america's bread
[41:52] basket and this is where
[41:53] agriculture reigns and this is where
[41:54] farming takes place and this is where we
[41:56] grow our crops and our grains and our
[41:58] corns
[41:58] and all these different things and this
[42:00] is this is what feeds america and this
[42:01] is what puts food on the table
[42:03] bethlehem was a place that would have
[42:04] been known for being very fertile and
[42:06] very rich and producing
[42:07] a lot of crops and then to know that
[42:09] here is one that lives in a place called
[42:12] the house of bread and a famine comes so
[42:14] he has to leave
[42:17] i'd be like leaving a buffet when you're
[42:19] hungry
[42:20] well that doesn't make sense shouldn't
[42:22] there be enough food there shouldn't
[42:23] there be something to eat
[42:24] and what's so striking about bethlehem
[42:28] christ it's not yet known
[42:31] in the in the scripture where he will
[42:33] come but we know in matthew chapter 2
[42:35] verse 1 that it says now when jesus was
[42:37] born
[42:37] in bethlehem of judea in other words
[42:40] christ was born
[42:41] in bethlehem judah and now here's the
[42:43] story of one
[42:45] who is in bethlehem judah but there
[42:47] comes a famine
[42:48] and he leaves the very place that is
[42:51] ordained to bring forth the messiah
[42:53] that should be a that should be a red
[42:55] flag that should be a signal
[42:57] and there's a way that you could plead
[42:59] on an elimelech's case to say well
[43:01] a man who does not provide for his
[43:02] family is worse than an infidel and if
[43:04] there was needs that were coming up and
[43:05] there was famine
[43:06] and and these things need to be taken
[43:08] care of then this is why he leaves and
[43:09] this is why he travels
[43:11] but notice where he's leaving he's
[43:12] leaving a place that god
[43:14] had permanently fixed
[43:17] it's not like abraham's soul journey and
[43:19] the famine comes and he goes down into
[43:20] egypt
[43:21] but this is a place that god had
[43:22] permanently fixed and established
[43:24] and so now there's a certain man of
[43:26] bethlehem judah a place which
[43:28] is a place of god's praise a place of
[43:30] god's bread a place
[43:31] that christ is going to come from and a
[43:34] certain man of bethlehem judah
[43:35] went to sojourn in the country
[43:38] of moab it could have been translated
[43:41] the field of moab or the fields of moab
[43:43] and i found that to be
[43:45] very informative to me because it's not
[43:47] so much a foreign country
[43:48] but it was the fields you're going from
[43:51] a place called the house of god's bread
[43:53] that would have
[43:54] acres and acres and hills of of crops
[43:56] and grains and a place that was very
[43:58] uh bring forth abundant life and grains
[44:01] that could be harvested and used to make
[44:02] bread
[44:03] to where it's known as the house of
[44:04] bread but now they leave
[44:06] that field and eliminate leaves that
[44:08] field with his wife and two sons
[44:10] and comes to the fields of moab
[44:13] the fields of a stranger and what was it
[44:17] that drove him there
[44:18] famine we know why the famine was there
[44:21] but what was moving him
[44:23] famine hunger was driving him but i want
[44:26] you to realize he's going the wrong way
[44:30] he's right there in bethlehem judah he's
[44:32] in the place that god had fixed israel a
[44:34] place that was called their promised
[44:35] land
[44:36] a place that they should put their feet
[44:37] a place that they should not remove
[44:38] themselves
[44:39] and it says that a certain man of
[44:41] bethlehem judah during this time of
[44:42] famine in the days when the judge's rule
[44:44] went to sojourn in the country or the
[44:47] fields of moab
[44:49] now the phrase souljarn should tell us
[44:51] to sojourn
[44:52] it suggests that they left with every
[44:55] intention
[44:55] of returning that this would be the idea
[44:59] well there's a famine right now so
[45:01] i'm just going to leave to go find work
[45:03] over here
[45:04] and then whenever a job opens back up
[45:06] there we'll get back in church
[45:09] right kind of put it in modern parlance
[45:12] right
[45:13] i'm just going to do this for a while
[45:15] until another opportunity comes up what
[45:17] usually happens
[45:18] let me use one that maybe doesn't offend
[45:20] all of us how many people have
[45:23] dropped out of college and said i'm just
[45:25] going to work for a while and save up
[45:26] some money then go back again
[45:28] any of you ever done that did you ever
[45:30] go back
[45:31] i know you did she ended up going back
[45:33] sister ruth and go away those are
[45:34] how appropriate but there's a lot of
[45:36] people who do that and get used to what
[45:38] the money
[45:40] and they never go back why something
[45:43] breaks that discipline something breaks
[45:44] that vision
[45:45] they intend to just work for a while and
[45:47] save up their money and go back
[45:49] but a lot of times they don't go back
[45:50] and a lot of people say oh well i'm just
[45:52] going to do it for a little bit i know
[45:53] what i should be doing i know what i
[45:54] ought to do but i'm just going to do
[45:56] this for a little bit and they think
[45:57] well i can just swing this way
[45:59] kind of catch up a little bit maybe save
[46:00] a little bit of money go into babylon
[46:02] and get a little bit of gold
[46:03] then swing right back again and be right
[46:04] back where i'm supposed to be and
[46:06] there's a danger in doing that
[46:09] the danger that is expressed even here
[46:10] in the story of ruth
[46:12] for elimelech and his two sons
[46:16] but to say that he was going to soldier
[46:17] and it it it stands for the proposition
[46:20] that in their minds
[46:21] we're just going to leave for a little
[46:22] bit but we're going to come back
[46:25] but i want you to see this image
[46:28] and i hope you can see this i had made
[46:30] it larger and i realized now that i've
[46:31] let you down tremendously
[46:33] so we all come up to the front and sit
[46:35] cross-legged here at the front and
[46:37] you see the whole the whole picture here
[46:39] it's very difficult to see
[46:42] but for them to leave bethlehem
[46:46] hope you can see this can you see a
[46:47] little bit of a can you make out a red
[46:49] line kind of in the middle there there's
[46:50] bethlehem just above judah
[46:52] to leave bethlehem and make it all the
[46:54] way down to moab to come up here on your
[46:56] left at about 10 o'clock and to get to
[46:58] where you're about four o'clock over
[47:00] here to do that
[47:02] they'd have to pass right by where
[47:03] jerusalem ultimately was past the ruins
[47:06] of jericho
[47:08] past the red sea across the jordan river
[47:11] back on the wrong side of jordan
[47:15] i think they're going back the opposite
[47:17] way as they travel this way
[47:19] past all these things into the
[47:20] wilderness
[47:22] that god ultimately had to lead them out
[47:24] of the wilderness of judea the
[47:26] wilderness
[47:26] there on the wrong side of jordan this
[47:28] is where they they went around
[47:30] time and time again and they were there
[47:32] in the wilderness that god had delivered
[47:33] out of they have to cross the jordan
[47:34] river
[47:35] and go all the way down to the land of
[47:36] moab
[47:38] they're reversing the exodus
[47:41] it's like they're going right back this
[47:43] is what god called them out of as they
[47:44] cross over
[47:45] and this is the route that they took in
[47:46] the exits and they crossed over the
[47:48] jordan river
[47:48] coming from your right to your left into
[47:50] jericho and conquered jericho
[47:52] but now it's almost as if they pushed
[47:53] rewind and they're going right back
[47:55] out go right back to what god called
[47:58] them out of
[47:59] go right back to a wilderness that they
[48:01] were only sustained in because god would
[48:02] give them manna from heaven every day
[48:04] and that god gave them quail to eat and
[48:06] that god
[48:07] sustained them during that time he says
[48:09] whenever you enter into the promised
[48:10] land
[48:11] these things will cease and from that
[48:13] point on you're going to have a new diet
[48:14] when you enter into the promised land
[48:16] so there was a promise of clean proven
[48:18] there was a promise of
[48:19] substance there was a promise that god
[48:21] would keep them but in order for them to
[48:23] leave
[48:23] bethlehem they had to go backwards and
[48:26] enter back into the wilderness that god
[48:27] had already called them out of
[48:30] now what i want you to catch and looking
[48:31] at that map and seeing the path that
[48:33] they went this was a clear
[48:34] departure from the promised land this
[48:37] wasn't them just trying to find another
[48:39] place in israel that was more
[48:41] verdant and more fertile and something
[48:43] that would uh give them
[48:45] a a better chance of surviving they
[48:47] leave
[48:48] the promised land and go into the
[48:50] wilderness
[48:52] they signed up for that they did that
[48:54] there's no
[48:55] there's no a pro there's no instruction
[48:58] in the word of god that says that when
[48:59] things get rough in israel you can go
[49:00] ahead and go into the wilderness
[49:03] that if you find that you're not being
[49:04] fed in the promised land then you can go
[49:05] back to moab
[49:06] and figure out a way to get by for a few
[49:08] years and then and then return back
[49:10] there's no prescription like that in the
[49:11] word of god
[49:13] god does not tell his children hey you
[49:14] know what if things get a little tough
[49:16] why don't you just abandon truth for a
[49:17] while
[49:18] and see if you can't get a little bit of
[49:19] emotional stimulus in the world
[49:21] and get a little bit of money and save
[49:23] up here and do this and pad your resume
[49:25] and do a bunch of things and then when
[49:26] whenever it seems like it gets a better
[49:28] opportunity to come back around
[49:29] he does not ask us to do that but let me
[49:32] just say
[49:33] in his grace when we have he makes a way
[49:35] for us to come back
[49:37] and that's what the story of ruth can
[49:38] speak to us and show us that even when
[49:40] there has been a wonder and even when
[49:42] there has been a going back to the
[49:43] wilderness
[49:44] there's still a promised land in a way
[49:46] back across the jordan river
[49:48] that door forever remains open for his
[49:50] elect
[49:52] i have no fear in preaching to god's
[49:54] elect that the door of grace remains
[49:56] open that the way of salvation always
[49:58] remains
[49:58] and it's not too late
[50:05] since the famine then was god's
[50:08] discipline
[50:10] for them to flee israel into moab was
[50:13] resisting god
[50:15] i want you to catch this even brother
[50:16] branagh makes the statement about naomi
[50:18] being backslid
[50:19] and so that to me was very instructive
[50:22] that really helped me to understand
[50:23] because at first you reading think well
[50:25] was elimelech
[50:26] doing the right thing and was this what
[50:27] he ought to have done but you realize
[50:29] that he's characterized now though we
[50:30] see a beautiful story unfold
[50:33] right this may be the paradox sometimes
[50:37] of the way that god does things but we
[50:39] see here one's
[50:40] disobedience god is going to use to tell
[50:43] a beautiful story of redemption
[50:46] and so there's there's going to be a
[50:48] great redemption that comes out there's
[50:49] going to be a bringing in just as
[50:51] israel's blinded and now i find myself
[50:52] kind of
[50:53] getting into where i wanted to touch on
[50:54] next time there's a blinding of israel
[50:56] so that the gentiles are brought in
[50:58] there's a hardening of elimelech's heart
[50:59] so he's brought into moab but he's going
[51:01] to bring ruth out of it
[51:03] but catch how that in doing this this is
[51:05] a this is a rejection of god
[51:10] that's what elimelech did when he did
[51:12] this he stopped trusting in god he was
[51:13] rejecting god
[51:14] by leaving israel and going into moab
[51:17] and it's a it's a caution to us it's a
[51:20] real warning to us let this be a warning
[51:22] to us let's just take this first
[51:23] as some teaching from the scripture it
[51:26] exposes
[51:27] now even now our tendencies as believers
[51:31] to seek worldly resources when things
[51:33] get difficult
[51:34] or to seek to be buffet uh to kind of be
[51:37] buffered by
[51:38] or supported by or increased by worldly
[51:41] things when we have transgressed against
[51:43] god
[51:44] so when we find that things are not
[51:46] working out and maybe we're
[51:47] fully aware of this is because my own
[51:48] disobedience elimelech should have
[51:50] looked around and said you know what the
[51:52] reason why things are the way they are
[51:53] is we have forsaken god and therefore
[51:56] elimelech should have
[51:57] called upon god tore down his grove
[51:59] sought the lord sought repentance
[52:00] sought him who made a promise to israel
[52:03] but instead of doing
[52:04] the repentance and doing the works of
[52:06] restoring yourself to god it seems so
[52:08] easier to seek solace in the things of
[52:10] the world
[52:12] we get into a spot emotionally where we
[52:14] just we're feeling
[52:15] uh pent-up pressure we feel like we kind
[52:17] of let the lord down we're feeling a
[52:18] little bit of strange from the lord
[52:20] instead of seeking restoration with god
[52:22] we can seek solace and entertainments
[52:24] and
[52:24] reliefs and i just want to go on a
[52:26] vacation i just want to go find a beach
[52:28] and lay down on it for a while and i
[52:29] just want to go do this and do that and
[52:31] there's a way that we want to
[52:32] catch this release and release this
[52:34] pressure and it exposes a limb like
[52:36] move into moab exposes this tendency to
[52:39] seek worldly resources
[52:41] instead of seeking restoration with god
[52:44] and i think it's just something that we
[52:46] need to remember and remind ourselves
[52:48] even if we do it by way of discipline
[52:50] and just instructing ourselves when i
[52:51] find myself unsettled when my when i
[52:53] find myself on edge
[52:55] let me not reach for worldly resource
[52:57] but let me seek solace in christ
[52:59] say lord is there is there something
[53:00] that needs to be restored is there
[53:02] something that's missing
[53:03] is there something you're teaching me
[53:05] and seek that first
[53:08] instead of going to moab
[53:11] and hoping that in moab you'll find what
[53:14] you need
[53:16] in deuteronomy chapter 11 verses 13 to
[53:18] 17 i wanted to read this
[53:21] so you can kind of see the whole a whole
[53:24] passage where god deals with both sides
[53:25] of this
[53:27] and why there was a famine in the land
[53:29] in the days when the judges ruled
[53:32] and this certain man elimelech from
[53:34] bethlehem judah went to soldier in the
[53:35] country of moab it says
[53:37] in deuteronomy chapter 11 verses 13 to
[53:40] 17 and it shall come to pass
[53:43] if ye if you shall hearken diligently
[53:45] unto my commandments which i command you
[53:47] this day
[53:48] to love the lord your god and to serve
[53:50] him with all your heart and with all
[53:51] your soul
[53:52] notice what he'll do that i will give
[53:54] you the reign of your land in his due
[53:56] season
[53:57] god's not a liar he said if you do this
[54:00] you'll get rain
[54:02] the first rain and the latter rain so
[54:04] here's the the rain at the time of
[54:05] planting the rain at the time of
[54:06] harvesting
[54:07] that thou mayest gather in thy corn and
[54:09] thy wine and thine oil
[54:12] if you serve me you're going to get your
[54:14] reign
[54:15] and for israel this is very literal for
[54:17] israel
[54:18] there's a spiritual type for us as
[54:20] believers and and though there's even a
[54:22] natural type i believe that god will
[54:23] give you provision that you need even
[54:25] nationally
[54:26] promotions and better jobs and checks in
[54:28] the mail when you weren't expecting one
[54:29] and refunds when you didn't know you had
[54:31] one
[54:31] and all sorts of things if you obey him
[54:33] and serve him but for israel this was
[54:35] very literal
[54:36] serve me spiritually dedicate yourself
[54:38] to me with your whole heart and your
[54:39] whole mind
[54:40] and do my commandments and you're going
[54:42] to get rain when you plant
[54:44] and rain when you harvest and you're
[54:45] going to have wine and oil and corn
[54:47] you're going to have everything you need
[54:48] to live
[54:51] he says and i will send grass in thy
[54:53] fields for thy cattle
[54:54] that thou mayest eat and be full
[54:58] you're gonna have cattle that are fat
[55:00] you're gonna eat beef you're gonna be
[55:01] able to eat the lamb you're gonna have
[55:02] milk you're gonna have all the corn
[55:04] you're gonna have all the wheat you can
[55:05] have everything you need
[55:06] you have everything for your table if
[55:08] you
[55:09] serve me he says take heed yourselves
[55:13] verse 16 that your heart be not deceived
[55:16] and you turn aside and serve other gods
[55:19] and worship them
[55:21] could this be a warning to not get too
[55:23] comfortable
[55:26] wow isn't this great all our cows are
[55:28] fat and we got a lot of wine and we got
[55:29] a lot of oil and everything's going
[55:30] really really good
[55:31] and then what happens you get a little
[55:32] comfortable and getting a little
[55:35] comfortable you forget
[55:36] i only have this because god's blessing
[55:38] me the only reason why we have any of
[55:40] this is because we're serving him
[55:42] not because you're good enough not
[55:43] because you're smart enough not because
[55:44] you're dynamic enough
[55:45] what a reminder to all of us as
[55:47] christians if you're if there's
[55:49] blessings in your life
[55:50] acknowledge from whom they come if
[55:52] you're doing well on your job if you're
[55:54] making good decisions with your clients
[55:56] if you're
[55:56] if you're building a good product if
[55:58] you're supervising well if things are
[56:00] just clicking along and humming along
[56:01] and everything's going well
[56:02] stop and say thank you lord this is not
[56:05] because of my talent this is not because
[56:07] of my charisma
[56:08] this isn't because of my good business
[56:09] sense this is because of you lord
[56:12] you've blessed the works of my hand
[56:14] you've given me things and how we ought
[56:16] to do that as a church
[56:17] that if we see god blessing us it's not
[56:19] because of dynamic ministry it's not
[56:21] because of a dynamic personality it's
[56:23] not because one man was faithful
[56:24] it's because god is faithful he's the
[56:27] one that gives the increase
[56:28] he's the one that blesses he's the one
[56:30] that nourishes what a reminder to us
[56:32] that if things are going well
[56:34] and things are being blessed and things
[56:36] are abundant to stop and say oh
[56:38] god i'm humbled by your greatness
[56:40] because these things
[56:41] are your blessing
[56:44] so he says take heed to yourself
[56:47] because he says if you do that verse 17
[56:49] and then the lord's wrath be kindled
[56:51] against you and all of a sudden oh what
[56:52] happened i thought i was really smart i
[56:54] thought i figured out
[56:55] cycles and i thought i knew how to plant
[56:57] and rotate crops and
[56:58] i had all the i had the farmer's almanac
[57:00] that told me this year was going to be a
[57:01] bumper crop and i had everything figured
[57:03] out
[57:05] but the lord's wrath was kindled against
[57:06] you and he shut up the heavens
[57:08] that there be no rain and that the land
[57:11] yield not her fruit
[57:13] unless you perish quickly from off the
[57:15] good land
[57:17] which the lord giveth you that's what
[57:20] happened
[57:23] in the days when the judges ruled and
[57:25] there was a famine in the land
[57:28] and a certain man of bethlehem judah
[57:31] went to sojourn in the land of moab
[57:34] who it says he and his wife
[57:38] and his two sons here they are they're
[57:41] living out
[57:42] scripture exactly the things that god
[57:46] had warned and judges the things he had
[57:47] worn in leviticus and
[57:49] the things he expounded upon in ezekiel
[57:51] the very things that were said
[57:52] beforehand in deuteronomy 11 these very
[57:54] things
[57:55] are being lived out
[57:58] by this man his wife and his two sons
[58:02] we read the next few verses in our text
[58:08] the next few verses tell the story of
[58:10] the misery
[58:12] that awaited this family in moab
[58:16] it doesn't tell us what they were
[58:17] looking for
[58:19] when they went to moab but we could
[58:20] suspect that
[58:23] they hoped that they would find
[58:24] something better than what they had in
[58:25] bethlehem judah
[58:27] grain or wheat corn or something to live
[58:30] by
[58:33] it's really remarkable that you consider
[58:36] this
[58:37] move when all their rights and
[58:40] privileges and all these laws
[58:41] and redemption and
[58:45] provision were prophesied in the
[58:47] promised land
[58:49] remarkable that they would leave it but
[58:52] when we get to verse 5
[58:55] the scripture writes it this way i
[58:57] believe for
[58:58] impact that only the wife remains
[59:04] of those that left
[59:08] it came to pass in the days when the
[59:10] judges ruled that there was a famine in
[59:12] the land and a
[59:13] certain man of bethlehem judah went to
[59:15] soldier in the country of moab
[59:17] he and his wife and his two sons
[59:20] but yet when the story gets to verse 5
[59:23] only the wife remains
[59:26] she's the only one left of those that
[59:29] went out
[59:32] i say the book of ruth begins very dark
[59:35] doesn't it
[59:38] but remember what brother branham said
[59:39] about it
[59:41] he said every word of it's inspired
[59:43] every word of it fits together just like
[59:44] a dovetail on a plank
[59:47] he says it give this book gives out the
[59:49] very lines of redemption
[59:52] it's a beautiful little story well
[59:56] seems kind of foreboding right you read
[59:58] this you're just kind of in the
[59:59] bookstore and you
[1:00:00] you open up you start reading what
[1:00:02] section am i in
[1:00:03] horror what happened this is this is
[1:00:05] dark this is depressing i
[1:00:07] i wanted a kind of a it's a pick-me-up i
[1:00:09] wanted a good love story well it doesn't
[1:00:11] start out that way
[1:00:12] more like a tragedy but he says man he
[1:00:16] pass over that book many of you run over
[1:00:17] the top of that not thinking what it is
[1:00:19] but it's
[1:00:19] one of the greatest stories in there of
[1:00:21] the type of christ the most beautiful
[1:00:22] story the lord jesus almost
[1:00:24] in all of the old testament so though it
[1:00:28] starts out this way
[1:00:31] and though there's something to be
[1:00:32] gained by pondering
[1:00:34] what was taking place when the judges
[1:00:36] ruled why was there a famine in the land
[1:00:38] and why the danger was an element like
[1:00:40] leaving bethlehem judah to go even if it
[1:00:43] was just for a short period of time in
[1:00:44] the country of moab
[1:00:45] there's still a beautiful story that's
[1:00:47] shaping up and taking place
[1:00:49] brother brahma says in the message
[1:00:51] kinsman redeemer and maybe this would be
[1:00:53] a sermon
[1:00:54] for you all it'd be nice to me if all
[1:00:55] the church is reading the book of ruth
[1:00:56] and listening to some of these messages
[1:00:58] together
[1:00:59] in our own personal devotion it brings a
[1:01:01] little bit of continuity to us as a body
[1:01:03] when we gather for the word
[1:01:04] but kinsman redeemer would be a
[1:01:06] wonderful sermon to listen to he says
[1:01:08] this book of ruth was one of the
[1:01:09] outstanding
[1:01:10] books that they accepted in other words
[1:01:11] it was brought into the canon of
[1:01:12] scripture
[1:01:13] it was preserved within the old
[1:01:15] testament why
[1:01:17] if it's just a love story why would the
[1:01:19] writers and ancient sages accept this
[1:01:22] book as inspired it was just trying to
[1:01:24] tell you oh oh this is a neat story this
[1:01:26] is the q so you got to hear this
[1:01:27] if it's kind of like a paul harvey the
[1:01:29] rest of the story good day
[1:01:31] then i mean why would you put it in the
[1:01:32] bible right why would you leave it
[1:01:34] in there that paul harvey is a shout out
[1:01:38] to
[1:01:39] those of us in the congregation who know
[1:01:40] who paul harvey is
[1:01:42] god bless you good day
[1:01:46] he said why would the writers and
[1:01:48] ancient sages accept this book as
[1:01:50] inspired
[1:01:52] you follow this look what it says
[1:01:54] because there's a hidden revelation in
[1:01:56] it oh i like that because there's a
[1:02:00] hidden
[1:02:00] revelation in it and in this hidden
[1:02:03] revelation
[1:02:04] you catch the real meaning
[1:02:08] and it'll bring you real close to god
[1:02:11] that should start to get you a little
[1:02:13] bit excited about it right
[1:02:14] to think about in this book that some
[1:02:16] just pass right over that some
[1:02:18] recognizes a love story others may say
[1:02:20] well yeah i kind of see
[1:02:21] this type of christ as the kinsmen
[1:02:23] redeemer but there's a hidden revelation
[1:02:25] and in this hidden revelation you can
[1:02:28] catch the real meaning
[1:02:29] and in catching the real meaning it will
[1:02:31] bring you real close to god
[1:02:33] i want to be brought real close to god
[1:02:35] and i want to bring
[1:02:36] i want to be brought as close to god as
[1:02:38] i possibly can
[1:02:40] i want to be brought so close together
[1:02:42] with god where there's no difference
[1:02:45] i i want my entire identity to be lost
[1:02:48] in him i want there to be such a union
[1:02:50] where it's indivisible i want there to
[1:02:52] be a complete losing of my personality a
[1:02:54] complete losing of my indented identity
[1:02:56] i want to be so lost in him towards
[1:02:58] christ that lives within me so then i
[1:03:02] want this revelation i want to catch a
[1:03:03] real meaning
[1:03:04] not not so that i can wow my co-workers
[1:03:06] and i can spin somebody's head with
[1:03:08] types and
[1:03:09] and shadows but i want to be brought
[1:03:11] close to god
[1:03:13] because there's a revelation in this
[1:03:14] that when you catch it it'll bring you
[1:03:15] close to god
[1:03:17] he says i pray my whole soul this
[1:03:18] morning this is the prayer of the
[1:03:20] prophet my whole soul
[1:03:22] that god will catch every heart so
[1:03:24] spellbound
[1:03:27] there's a story in here
[1:03:30] and there's a there's a line the very
[1:03:32] lines of redemption this is the hidden
[1:03:34] revelation
[1:03:35] in the lines of redemption that if you
[1:03:37] can catch a revelation of it

[1:04:11] spellbound
[1:04:13] i'm focused on something there's
[1:04:14] something happening i'm seeing the very
[1:04:16] lines of redemption
[1:04:17] are being drawn out before me and i want
[1:04:19] to be held spellbound by the word of god
[1:04:23] catch every heart so spellbound until
[1:04:24] he'll reveal himself
[1:04:26] just what he is in this story what he is
[1:04:29] to you
[1:04:31] and how to accept him don't you want to
[1:04:33] catch what he is to you
[1:04:36] don't you want to be held spellbound by
[1:04:37] what he is
[1:04:39] just what he is in the word of god what
[1:04:41] he is in the message of the hour just
[1:04:43] what he is
[1:04:43] and what he is to you and how to accept
[1:04:46] him
[1:04:48] he says and when once you see it it's so
[1:04:49] simple you wonder how you ever went over
[1:04:51] the top of it
[1:04:52] it says but it can only be revealed by
[1:04:53] the holy spirit
[1:04:55] not just study not discipline but it's
[1:04:58] revealed by the holy spirit
[1:05:02] a hidden revelation i want to pick up in
[1:05:05] this statement if god will let us maybe
[1:05:06] more
[1:05:07] in some of the future services but that
[1:05:09] speaks to what we've received in this
[1:05:11] end time
[1:05:13] it's what you're feasting on saints
[1:05:15] let's stand together tonight
[1:05:20] there's a hidden revelation in this book
[1:05:26] not adding to but hidden revelations and
[1:05:29] unfolding and revealing
[1:05:31] that as it's revealed to you it brings
[1:05:34] you closer to god
[1:05:36] amen i want to draw i want to draw
[1:05:38] closer to him
[1:05:40] and to do so he needs to reveal himself
[1:05:42] to me
[1:05:43] and that's what i desire let's bow our
[1:05:44] heads in prayer tonight
[1:05:47] with our heads bowed
[1:05:50] our hearts open our gracious heavenly
[1:05:52] father
[1:05:58] it's been good to have been in your
[1:05:59] house tonight
[1:06:02] i admit as a brother it's nice to see so
[1:06:05] many
[1:06:06] seats full and
[1:06:10] and to see friends and family
[1:06:14] to see the faithfulness of the people
[1:06:16] that pull away from
[1:06:19] the demands of laodicea and come to
[1:06:22] church
[1:06:23] [Music]
[1:06:25] some who i know have pulled away by way
[1:06:28] of streaming
[1:06:31] or we'll find that time a moment in the
[1:06:33] near future to
[1:06:35] to maybe pick up a message in the
[1:06:37] archive
[1:06:38] those things are thrilling or to see
[1:06:41] that personal side of it and the human
[1:06:43] side of it
[1:06:48] but when you consider that what we're
[1:06:51] gathered around
[1:06:53] is not a meeting location
[1:06:57] when you see a group like this wait we
[1:06:59] didn't we're not coming to this church
[1:07:01] because this is where our family's
[1:07:02] always gone
[1:07:04] we're not coming to this church because
[1:07:06] this is where we were raised
[1:07:07] [Music]
[1:07:11] in some ways lord we've come like ruth
[1:07:15] something deep within a stronghold we
[1:07:18] know not what it is
[1:07:20] but just a profession your god will be
[1:07:23] my god your people will be my people
[1:07:28] we find ourselves here tonight enjoying
[1:07:31] gatherings like this again not because
[1:07:32] we see the
[1:07:33] seats full and we see the faces of the
[1:07:35] people but knowing
[1:07:37] that it's something supernatural taking
[1:07:39] place
[1:07:41] we sense it in your word as it's coming
[1:07:43] forth that you're speaking to us
[1:07:46] for the moment that we're living in
[1:07:50] lord we look back through time and i i
[1:07:52] testify as
[1:07:54] as a son of god who's been raised in
[1:07:56] this glorious message that we have had
[1:07:59] the best of preaching the best of
[1:08:03] sermons
[1:08:05] the types expressed and the truth
[1:08:07] revealed and men of god who've gone
[1:08:10] gone before myself through the 70s and
[1:08:12] 80s and 90s and 2000s lord for decades
[1:08:16] they've been preaching these things and
[1:08:17] establishing these things
[1:08:21] so i said lord it's not that we have
[1:08:22] something new to speak
[1:08:24] [Music]
[1:08:26] but i'm so thrilled to hear the word the
[1:08:30] same word preached
[1:08:32] and though we could even know that these
[1:08:34] things have been shared and these quotes
[1:08:36] have been used and these scriptures
[1:08:38] have been expounded upon it's fresh to
[1:08:40] us today
[1:08:42] and it resonates within our souls as
[1:08:45] living manna
[1:08:47] as inspired word for the moment that
[1:08:49] we're living in right now
[1:08:53] that though we have been fed well and
[1:08:56] though we have been led well and though
[1:08:58] we have been sustained
[1:09:00] [Music]
[1:09:02] you have once again come and done
[1:09:04] something special
[1:09:07] to take us further to take us higher
[1:09:11] by opening up your word to us freshly
[1:09:14] inspiring us newly
[1:09:16] not some new revelation lord not some
[1:09:18] secret messenger
[1:09:20] that's gonna pop up and do this but it's
[1:09:23] the word that you've given
[1:09:26] for ruth it was a new land
[1:09:30] but it was a land you had already
[1:09:31] promised so i pray for
[1:09:34] us lord you open up to us this land
[1:09:37] that we can feed on your word without
[1:09:40] restriction without inhibition
[1:09:43] encourage your people tonight as they
[1:09:44] have faithfully pulled upon your word
[1:09:47] and demonstrated such a
[1:09:48] an intention
[1:09:52] and spellbound lord as it were i pray
[1:09:55] that you bless them
[1:09:56] commit them to you tonight we love you
