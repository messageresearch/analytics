[0:00] but let's stand let's read in the word
[0:02] of the lord
[0:04] i'd like to read ruth chapter 1 verse 22
[0:06] and then verse 1 of chapter 2.
[0:09] thank you brother micah just tremendous
[0:11] this evening
[0:12] ruth chapter 1 verse 22 and then i'd
[0:14] like to read the first verse
[0:16] of chapter two
[0:18] and tonight i trust i'm hoping to kind
[0:20] of bring to a conclusion um a series
[0:23] that we started when we preached began
[0:25] when we preached a sermon called hungry
[0:27] with the question mark hungry
[0:28] and it kind of continued on am i hung i
[0:31] am hungry and are you being fed and and
[0:35] eating to live and then it just it came
[0:37] to this
[0:38] i was
[0:39] pondering this thought that we're coming
[0:41] to tonight and it just kind of seemed
[0:43] like there was such a long prelude to it
[0:45] we're saying come to bethlehem and that
[0:47] when ruth came to bethlehem she didn't
[0:48] know who was going to be feeding her
[0:50] um she just came because of
[0:51] circumstances and that's really what
[0:53] i've been pondering this whole time is
[0:55] if you as the bride of christ are hungry
[0:57] there's only one who can feed you
[0:58] there's only one thing you can feed on
[1:00] and uh and even though it's been 16
[1:03] something services we've been looking at
[1:04] this that's not suggesting at all it's
[1:06] taken that long for you to pick up on
[1:08] that but god is just kind of as a
[1:09] prelude looked at different things we've
[1:11] walked through these uh walk through it
[1:13] in a little bit of a lengthy way and so
[1:14] tonight we're trusting that we're able
[1:16] to come
[1:18] come to a conclusion in this ruth
[1:20] chapter 1 verse 22 so naomi returned and
[1:23] ruth the moabitus her daughter-in-law
[1:25] with her which returned remember that
[1:28] peculiar phrasing which returned saying
[1:30] that ruth is also returning returned out
[1:32] of the country of moab and they came to
[1:35] bethlehem in the beginning of barley
[1:37] harvest and we've been looking at that
[1:39] phrase in the bread of life bringing
[1:42] forth the bride this this uh god had
[1:45] visited his people and bringing them
[1:46] bread and now it's bringing this gentile
[1:48] with naomi and naomi had a kinsmen of
[1:51] her husbands a mighty man of wealth of
[1:53] the family of elimelech and his name was
[1:56] boaz and we're going to try to read
[1:58] maybe all of chapter 2 tonight verse by
[2:00] verse but just following the lord as he
[2:03] would lead us if we could bow our heads
[2:04] heavenly father thank you for this
[2:06] gathering that we have this evening
[2:08] lord we've gathered in your name we have
[2:10] felt your presence my the voice is being
[2:12] lifted up and i rejoice to hear the
[2:14] people so comfortable worshiping
[2:17] and learning that it's not for show it's
[2:19] not what the next person
[2:21] hears lord but it's just open up our
[2:22] heart and open up our mouth and letting
[2:25] praise pour forth lord i pray i am so
[2:28] thankful that we have not
[2:30] structured our service by tradition nor
[2:32] are we coming traditionally
[2:34] but you've done something new and you've
[2:36] done it in a unique way that's bringing
[2:38] us out of our comfort zones and maybe
[2:40] the little boxes we've tried to put you
[2:41] in
[2:42] and tonight father you've identified
[2:44] yourself with us through worship in the
[2:46] worship lord now we pray that you take
[2:48] the bread of life and feed us
[2:50] and lord as i try to maybe deliver my
[2:52] closing burden on this thought of
[2:55] the bread of life and it feeding the
[2:57] bride in this hour and it's the only
[2:59] thing that really suffices and satisfies
[3:01] i pray that it would hit the mark
[3:03] and do so in a special way for each
[3:05] person individually because that's the
[3:07] part lord that may be so important for
[3:09] us to recognize that it's not a group
[3:11] move it's not a church move it's an
[3:13] individual affair in this hour so speak
[3:15] to us individually we pray in the name
[3:17] of the lord jesus christ amen god bless
[3:20] you may be seated
[3:22] just
[3:24] i want to make a few comments that kind
[3:26] of connect to where we were
[3:28] last time on a roof
[3:31] in the the statement we just read there
[3:33] in verse 22 how they came to bethlehem
[3:37] and that was uh kind of where we begin
[3:40] to look at the book of ruth is when we
[3:42] started looking at the statement the
[3:43] bread of life bringing forth the bride
[3:46] and we actually were using the sense of
[3:48] come to bethlehem that there's an
[3:50] invitation and there's a call and it was
[3:53] it was really looking at this verse
[3:55] right there which says they came to
[3:57] bethlehem
[3:58] in the time at the beginning of the
[4:00] barley harvest so we looked at that um
[4:02] how that naomi is returning
[4:05] at the beginning of barley harvest and
[4:06] that timing the timing of the barley
[4:08] harvest we looked at how
[4:11] remarkable it is in scripture all these
[4:13] different events that coincide with that
[4:15] whether it be the exodus out of egypt or
[4:18] the entrance into uh the promised land
[4:21] or the the timing of the crucifixion of
[4:23] jesus christ and the outpouring of the
[4:26] holy ghost on the day of pentecost you
[4:28] see these different junctures and so
[4:30] though it held the significance in terms
[4:32] of a very strict calendar in the order
[4:34] of the feast to the gen the jews to the
[4:36] gentile we begin to see the types that
[4:38] emerge and so it's not that we have to
[4:41] come to the lord on a certain day of the
[4:43] calendar that coincides with the jewish
[4:45] feast but we see these types and so ruth
[4:48] was coming to bethlehem at harvest time
[4:50] and last time we looked at just even the
[4:52] parallel the things that have transpired
[4:54] over the last 120 years and how that we
[4:56] see this move of god and the pentecostal
[4:59] move and the restoration of the gifts
[5:00] and how pentecost organizes
[5:03] and it is fallen away and as it falls
[5:06] away there's a there's a bride that's
[5:08] going to be coming forth at the same
[5:09] time orpah turns her back and goes back
[5:11] but then at that very same time
[5:14] ruth who types the bride she's coming
[5:16] forth and what we saw is a very striking
[5:19] parallel that i think just continues to
[5:22] support what we see in the scripture
[5:24] naomi returned it says in the barley at
[5:27] the beginning of barley harvest but
[5:28] she's returning in the season of the fig
[5:30] tree putting forth its leaves and we
[5:32] looked in the scripture we found that
[5:34] jesus gave that as a parable and a
[5:36] signal saying that when you see uh the
[5:38] this fig tree putting forth its leaves
[5:40] and and beginning to put forth a tender
[5:42] branch uh that this was a significant
[5:44] scriptural sign of the end time and then
[5:47] we see israel returns to its homeland
[5:50] and this zionist movement begins to pick
[5:52] up steam and we just looked at it
[5:53] historically and saw these very specific
[5:55] dates matching up and coinciding to
[5:58] where even israel then in 1940 declaring
[6:00] itself a declaration of independence
[6:02] identified as as a nation and so we see
[6:06] then naomi returned to her homeland then
[6:08] there's got to be a roof that's there
[6:10] got to be a ruth that's coming on the
[6:11] scene and making herself known
[6:13] and the statement we're just reading
[6:15] this is one of the last ones we had read
[6:16] last time oh the picture now ruth the
[6:19] gentile church just coming in and naomi
[6:21] the jewish church coming back
[6:23] now naomi type in israel the jewish
[6:26] church coming back to their homeland and
[6:28] then we're going to see what we're
[6:29] seeing is a restoration or bringing back
[6:33] of the body of christ that had even just
[6:35] quickly fallen away and organized even
[6:37] after just the revival that took place
[6:39] in the 1900s early 1900s he says and
[6:42] notice when they turned and went got
[6:44] back to the homeland they come in just
[6:46] in barley season and he's looking right
[6:48] there ruth chapter 1 verse 22. now
[6:50] anyone knows what barley season was it
[6:52] was pentecost the first fruits so we see
[6:54] that
[6:55] coinciding with these different spring
[6:57] feasts how the gentile church was
[6:58] brought in under the wings of the
[7:00] almighty god at pentecost the gentile
[7:02] church the bride and when she returned
[7:05] it was barley season now when you read
[7:07] that i can see that even in the way he
[7:09] just described it saying she was brought
[7:11] in at the feast of pentecost he was
[7:13] brought in on the day of pentecost she
[7:16] was brought in on the wings of almighty
[7:17] god and now when she's returning and now
[7:20] when she's coming back she's coming back
[7:22] in barley season now that she's being
[7:24] brought back through the word of god and
[7:26] being restored back to the original
[7:27] faith which was introduced introduced by
[7:30] jesus christ she's coming back to that
[7:32] the very scriptural time a very perfect
[7:34] time as she's coming back there's the
[7:36] fig tree putting forth its branch
[7:38] there's the barley season here's the
[7:40] harvest time and everything's just
[7:42] matching up perfectly
[7:44] so as we continue to read in chapter 2
[7:46] verse 1
[7:48] and now the story
[7:50] we took several services just to
[7:51] background chapter one
[7:53] and there's um
[7:55] there's no question that we could have
[7:57] spent more time
[7:58] in ruth chapter one even just on that
[8:00] last phrase the beginning of barley
[8:01] harvest so many other types and
[8:02] scriptural things we could put in there
[8:04] one thing and i don't believe i've
[8:05] mentioned it to you but one thing the
[8:06] lord reminded me of over and over and
[8:09] over again and this is this says uh
[8:13] maybe um
[8:14] giving some insight into how god was
[8:16] dealing with me personally
[8:18] he kept reminding me that this was a
[8:20] good this was it was good to do this
[8:22] verse but verse by verse
[8:24] to show you just how much is in the word
[8:26] of god
[8:28] and to teach you
[8:30] that when we read our bibles and we hear
[8:32] the word to open up our minds and ask
[8:34] god to give us understanding
[8:36] and to ponder things and wait on things
[8:38] and to realize just how much depth there
[8:40] is in the word that we've received and
[8:43] how it lines up with scripture and how
[8:44] much the word we've received opens up
[8:46] the scripture and so something the lord
[8:48] was constantly reminding me of in in
[8:50] doing this that he was wanting to show
[8:52] that we could just we could take a book
[8:53] in the bible we could take statements
[8:55] from the message of the hour and we can
[8:57] begin to line these things up and
[8:58] realize just a study that can unfold
[9:01] verse
[9:02] verse by verse and it'd be very
[9:04] instructive to us and enlightening to us
[9:06] and open up things that are very
[9:07] practical to us
[9:09] and so we are looking at these things uh
[9:11] verse by verse and as we come to this
[9:13] particular verse i want to start begin
[9:15] to read but remember how we have this
[9:17] perfect picture of today at this very
[9:18] moment we begin to read this we have
[9:20] pentecost has been restored and we have
[9:22] the jews going back into palestine then
[9:25] we must be in rapture time must be
[9:27] harvest time and there must be a bride
[9:29] that's going to be raptured so it says
[9:31] in verse 1 of chapter 2 and naomi had a
[9:33] kinsmen
[9:34] of her husbands a mighty man of wealth
[9:37] of the family of elimelech that was
[9:38] naomi's husband
[9:40] elimelech and his name was boaz
[9:43] now the first thing i'd like to point
[9:44] out is it uses a very interesting word
[9:46] here
[9:48] for kinsmen it says naomi had a yada i
[9:50] had a kinsmen of her husband's of her
[9:51] husband elimelech and that means
[9:53] acquaintance so it really just means
[9:55] somebody that you would know or be
[9:56] acquainted with
[9:57] and the chapter introduces him and if we
[9:59] were reading this for the first time we
[10:01] might have thought well that's a little
[10:02] bit peculiar and let's say we didn't
[10:04] know anything else about the story we're
[10:05] just reading it we would be gathering
[10:08] that naomi had someone that she knew
[10:11] and someone that her husband knew
[10:12] acquaintance to her husband who had a
[10:14] lot of money or had a lot of wealth and
[10:16] so we might begin to think oh it's kind
[10:17] of signaling to us that she knows this
[10:19] person so she's going to go to him and
[10:21] ask for help or go to him and request
[10:23] that maybe she can get some assistance
[10:26] and so the word there is acquaintance it
[10:28] says he's a mighty man of wealth it's
[10:30] actually a phrase that's used i believe
[10:31] of gideon a mighty man of valor it's a
[10:34] to be valiant to have valor and he was a
[10:36] in one translation i think it's in the
[10:38] county it says a mighty man
[10:41] of the law it's meaning that kind of a
[10:43] paradox they even saved the time that
[10:45] was someone who's well versed in the law
[10:47] well versed in the word but also a man
[10:49] of great wealth says in his name was
[10:52] boaz that word means i think if you
[10:54] looked it up in your lexicon
[10:56] it would mean fleetness someone who's
[10:57] very quick to movement someone very fast
[11:00] but it means in him is strength he had
[11:03] strength of riches he had strength of
[11:05] power he had a great virtue he had a
[11:07] grace about him even when solomon built
[11:09] the temple he named one of the two uh
[11:12] pillars in the temple boaz because it
[11:14] signified just this strength this pillar
[11:16] that he was in the temple of god and so
[11:18] knowing that later on in solomon of one
[11:21] of two pillars names that boaz kind of
[11:24] shows us that this is the very important
[11:26] figure
[11:27] even in the temple of god that building
[11:29] of god the place that god is going to
[11:30] dwell boaz is a very important character
[11:33] in it he is the grandson of nashon he's
[11:36] the prince who is a prince of the tribe
[11:37] of judah his father was salmon who
[11:40] married rahab
[11:41] and so we know and we read this i think
[11:43] in this series in matthew chapter one
[11:45] verses four to six
[11:48] it's a we're looking at the lineage now
[11:50] of boaz and it's so important
[11:53] that unlike any any other place it goes
[11:56] through and it kind of drops down it's
[11:57] not just saying dad son dad son dad son
[12:00] when it comes to this passage it does
[12:02] something very unique amram begat amna
[12:04] dab and amna dab begat nashan and the
[12:06] sean beget salmon in salmon boaz of
[12:10] rahab and so this is the captain of the
[12:13] lord of hosts salmon who came in who is
[12:15] this general this great captain in the
[12:17] army he marries rahab who is a gentile
[12:19] harlot he marries her and then boaz
[12:22] begat obed of ruth
[12:25] so right back to back it stops and it
[12:28] backs up and it gives us this mystery of
[12:30] rahab this mystery
[12:32] of of of of ruth and then obed beget
[12:35] jesse and jesse beget david the king and
[12:38] david the king begat solomon of her that
[12:40] had been the wife of uriah again
[12:42] bringing in a gentile woman and this is
[12:44] really the mystery of the old testament
[12:46] kind of being joined together here at
[12:48] the beginning of the new testament but
[12:50] it shows us just how important boaz in
[12:53] the lineage of jesus christ
[12:56] boaz mary uh beau has his begotte of
[12:58] salmon and rahab than boaz marries ruth
[13:01] so we kind of know the end of the story
[13:03] we know that he's going to have a child
[13:04] he has obed whose son is then jesse
[13:07] jesse begets david the king david's son
[13:10] solomon takes the throne and builds the
[13:13] temple and names one of the pillars
[13:14] after boaz so this is a very important
[13:16] figure that's introduced as we read it
[13:19] now we have the benefit of going fast
[13:20] forward in history and and seeing it
[13:23] though that may be a paradox to go
[13:24] forward in history we have the book that
[13:27] tells us the whole story we can see
[13:29] being forward looking what who boaz is
[13:32] going to be and what he's going to
[13:33] represent so now it kind of introduces
[13:36] that and then it's important maybe we
[13:38] just read that he's an acquaintance of
[13:40] of
[13:41] of naomi so maybe they're going to go to
[13:42] him for help but notice how this story
[13:44] unfolds it's very remarkable verse 2 in
[13:47] ruth the moabitess they keep reminding
[13:49] us who she is
[13:50] said unto naomi let me now go to the
[13:53] field and glean ears of corn after him
[13:55] and whose sight i shall find graves
[13:58] and i want you to recognize this
[14:00] expression of humility on ruth's part
[14:03] and the submission that she can
[14:05] continues to have to naomi
[14:07] that she ask of naomi whether she can do
[14:10] it
[14:11] let me go she's asking permission let me
[14:13] go and notice the grace that she has to
[14:14] glean ears of corn after him and whose
[14:16] sight
[14:17] i shall find grace and she said under
[14:19] naomi says go my daughter so she got
[14:21] permission
[14:23] she's submitting herself to naomi
[14:26] it's a tremendous expression of humility
[14:29] and what she's going to do
[14:31] is she wants to go in labor she's going
[14:32] to go glean she's not saying hey is
[14:34] there anybody that knew
[14:36] my father-in-law that knew your husband
[14:38] that maybe we could go ask him for help
[14:39] and go with the handout she's saying i'm
[14:41] willing to work for this i'm willing to
[14:43] glean and such a beautiful expression of
[14:45] humility and a beautiful expression of
[14:47] the bride's character
[14:48] and i wanted to read in a couple places
[14:50] in leviticus 19 in deuteronomy chapter
[14:52] 24
[14:54] of the law that ruth could have availed
[14:57] herself too
[14:58] it says in leviticus 19 verses 9 and 10
[15:00] and when you reap the harvest of your
[15:02] land thou shalt not wholly reap the
[15:04] corners of thy field neither shalt thou
[15:06] gather the gulenians of thy harvest and
[15:08] thou shalt not glean the vineyard
[15:10] neither shalt thou gather every grape of
[15:12] the vineyard thou shalt leave them for
[15:14] the poor and stranger i am the lord your
[15:17] god
[15:18] these blasted socialists i'm telling you
[15:21] they're ruining us they are ruining us
[15:24] deuteronomy chapter 24 verse 19
[15:27] notice it says when thou cut us down thy
[15:29] harvest and thy field and hast forgot a
[15:31] sheaf in the field thou shalt not go
[15:33] again to fetch it it shall be for the
[15:35] stranger for the fatherless and for the
[15:37] widow that the lord thy god may bless
[15:40] thee in all the work of thine hands
[15:43] now i know we like to
[15:44] trumpet the virtues of capitalism but i
[15:47] want you to think for a moment there's
[15:48] no virtue in capitalism anymore
[15:51] it's been taken over by greed the love
[15:53] of money is the root of all evil and if
[15:55] we had men of integrity and people who
[15:58] are christian had christian character
[16:00] and had morals at their core then
[16:02] capitalism would be wonderful because
[16:04] what we're reading here of people who
[16:05] would have been capitalist and they
[16:07] would have had great harvest and they
[16:08] would have had a lot of bounty and they
[16:10] would they would have harvested in such
[16:11] a way to where they would have left
[16:13] something for the poor to come and to
[16:15] work of their own accord and work by
[16:17] their hands and still have something to
[16:20] support themselves and the owner of the
[16:22] field wouldn't be like you know what if
[16:23] i could even just get the corners here
[16:25] and i could get everything then i could
[16:27] sell it so much a bushel or so much a
[16:28] weight i can get so much more at the
[16:30] market and then just try to sell
[16:32] everything so he could maximize his
[16:33] gains and maximize his profits this is
[16:36] the lord god sharing a principle with
[16:38] the the wealthy of israel to say look
[16:41] when you when you harvest your field
[16:43] leave some for the poor so that they can
[16:46] come and work themselves and get
[16:48] something out of it
[16:49] and i know it sounds like socialism but
[16:51] if anything and if and if i've roiled
[16:53] you up a little bit you'll forgive me by
[16:55] the time i get back in town in a few
[16:56] weeks
[16:57] but uh it's it's really just to cause
[16:59] you to think a little bit let's stop
[17:01] thinking politically but think more
[17:02] scripturally
[17:04] stop allowing ourselves to be polarized
[17:06] by democrat and republican and
[17:07] capitalism and socialism and just
[17:09] realize there's really a scriptural way
[17:11] to do things and when you leave the
[17:12] scripture then it's left to the
[17:14] democrats it's left to the republicans
[17:16] and capitalism won't work neither will
[17:17] socialism work because it's no longer
[17:19] governed by the lord thy god
[17:21] because god says here look if you will
[17:23] do this i will bless the work of your
[17:26] hands if you will labor have your field
[17:28] and you will harvest and in harvesting
[17:30] leave some and give some to the poor i
[17:32] will bless your gains i will bless your
[17:35] margins i will continue to give you
[17:37] wealth because you provided also for
[17:39] those the fatherless the widows and the
[17:41] poor
[17:43] it's beautiful in the scripture how it
[17:44] lays in there and now ruth could have
[17:47] availed herself to this because it says
[17:49] in the corners they can go and glean uh
[17:52] if you've left some behind you forgot to
[17:54] say if you left a sheaf in the field you
[17:56] actually harvest it and you left it
[17:57] don't go back and collect it leave it
[17:59] for somebody
[18:00] it's very very beautiful now ruth could
[18:02] have done that but the scripture phrases
[18:04] it a little bit differently says i want
[18:06] to go glean ears of corn after him and
[18:09] whose sight i shall find grace so
[18:11] leviticus 19 in deuteronomy 24 imposed
[18:14] upon them an obligation according to the
[18:16] word to leave it but now ruth is
[18:18] actually saying that if one would give
[18:20] me permission i would like to actually
[18:22] not wait until they're done or go into
[18:25] the corners but follow behind the
[18:27] laborers and pick up some things in the
[18:30] field while they're gleaning and while
[18:32] they're harvesting so that's when she
[18:34] says she actually wanted to enter into a
[18:36] little bit more of a special
[18:37] relationship because leviticus 19 in
[18:39] deuteronomy 24 would have been one of
[18:41] obligation that was required by the law
[18:44] but to do what ruth was doing one would
[18:46] have to grant her permission
[18:48] so in chapter verse three now as we
[18:49] continue ruth chapter two verse three
[18:51] and she went and came
[18:53] and gleaned in the field after the
[18:55] reapers
[18:57] and her hap was to light on a part of
[19:00] the field belonging into boaz who was of
[19:03] the kindred of elimelech again kindred
[19:05] there just means he was family relation
[19:07] it wouldn't give us any kind of
[19:08] indication exactly who boaz was so we
[19:11] know that boaz is a mighty man of wealth
[19:14] in him is strength he is a kinsman or an
[19:16] acquaintance of elimelech now we know
[19:18] that maybe he's actually family of a
[19:20] limelit but still don't really know to
[19:22] what degree in what this will really
[19:24] mean in the story but as the way this is
[19:26] written and i've alluded to this a
[19:28] number of times in the last several
[19:29] services and it's been this verse that
[19:32] has really really excited me
[19:34] if you could just for a moment
[19:36] uh and do it with perfect recall recall
[19:38] all 15 other services that we preached
[19:41] and the trajectory of them
[19:43] and the emphasis that was being made
[19:44] from the time that we begin in ruth 1
[19:47] chapter 1 verse 1 and all the things
[19:50] that are starting it opens with this
[19:51] famine and they run they run away to
[19:53] moab and there's a two three funerals
[19:56] and then there's an exodus out of moab
[19:58] and orpah goes back and ruth is coming
[20:00] in and they're all coming in because the
[20:01] lord had visited bethlehem judah and
[20:03] giving them grain and ruth is coming
[20:06] along out of death and out of out of
[20:08] this horrible situation she's coming
[20:10] along and she's not coming along with
[20:12] the perfect revelation and understanding
[20:15] of the law even here when she says can i
[20:17] go glean ears of corn after him whom i
[20:19] shall find grace she's not invoking the
[20:21] law
[20:23] she's not saying can i go to the corners
[20:25] and can i go see if anyone's left behind
[20:26] a chief she's just going trying to find
[20:28] grace
[20:29] and it's it's possible that naomi could
[20:32] have informed her of different things
[20:34] but even then the scripture wants us to
[20:36] know that even as it introduces a boaz
[20:39] he's just an acquaintance and then when
[20:41] he introduces him again he's a family
[20:43] member but notice what it says about
[20:44] ruth when she went begin to glean it
[20:47] says her hap
[20:49] in other words as it were by chance
[20:53] by coincidence and she just or she just
[20:56] happened it wasn't that she had the ways
[20:58] opened up or she had google maps open
[21:00] and she was saying you know how what's
[21:02] the directions to walk to the field to
[21:04] boaz she just was going out trying to
[21:06] find people who are harvesting so she
[21:07] was going out looking and she found some
[21:09] reapers and gleaners and we would see
[21:10] later on that we kind of get the back
[21:12] story a little bit do you mind if i
[21:14] follow behind and pick up some grain i'm
[21:16] a widow my mother-in-law's also a widow
[21:18] and we need some grain and they're like
[21:20] sure go ahead and she's beginning to
[21:21] labor and it says as it were by chance
[21:25] she happened to be going to the field
[21:27] belonging into boaz then there would
[21:29] have been no fences there would have
[21:30] been no uh structures put up they would
[21:33] not have built the wall and had their
[21:34] neighbor pay for it there would have
[21:36] been uh just landmarks that would
[21:38] indicated where the um where the land
[21:41] was boaz is where it was somebody else's
[21:43] and so there was actually no fence there
[21:44] was no sign put up there she just girls
[21:46] and finds people who are harvesting and
[21:48] as it were by chance she finds herself
[21:51] in the field of boaz
[21:54] she was not led of her own accord she
[21:55] wasn't being very deliberate she wasn't
[21:57] conspiring and she wasn't saying well
[21:59] boaz is a wealthy man maybe i can find
[22:01] favor with him she was just being she
[22:03] was being led there and drawn there by
[22:05] maybe a natural need in her own life but
[22:08] it was god it was divine providence
[22:10] that's leading her to that field
[22:12] i want you to think about it with
[22:14] everything that we've emphasized through
[22:15] several services and the things we've
[22:17] seen in the word of the hour that teach
[22:19] us just how important this book of ruth
[22:21] is and how she represents a type of the
[22:23] bride and how the the conditions she had
[22:26] to come out of the opposition that she
[22:28] faced the showdown that she went through
[22:30] so she is walking through these
[22:31] different steps and it's important then
[22:33] that she's not premeditating and
[22:35] figuring it all out and saying oh i know
[22:37] what i'm going to do i'm going to go to
[22:38] the wealthiest man i know related to to
[22:40] elimelech or related to my husband who's
[22:42] now dead but she is led by divine
[22:45] providence
[22:46] why because she's a type of the bride
[22:48] and so god has to draw ruth out of moab
[22:52] and then begin to direct her steps even
[22:54] on this very day within this this
[22:56] 24-hour period god is going to take her
[22:59] and she's just humble and she's willing
[23:01] to work and she's willing to serve and
[23:03] she's humbling herself to naomi and
[23:05] she's saying oh let me go work with my
[23:07] hands and find us some grain and glean a
[23:09] little bit so we have something to live
[23:10] off of and then god begins to work with
[23:12] her heart and draws her and moves her
[23:14] and brings her right by chance as it
[23:16] were to the very field to boaz
[23:20] oh my
[23:21] she has to do that because she's a type
[23:23] of the bride
[23:24] and then verse four and behold boaz came
[23:27] from bethlehem you'll find that the
[23:29] mystery of his coming unfolds in the
[23:32] book of ruth boaz came from bethlehem
[23:35] now it's not just
[23:37] ruth in the field gleaning and trying to
[23:39] harvest and doing these things now
[23:41] boaz who's the christ type is coming to
[23:44] where she is
[23:46] catch this part this to me is the
[23:47] beautiful the beautiful part this is
[23:49] part to me what god revealed to me part
[23:51] of that hidden mystery the hidden
[23:53] meaning in ruth that when you see it it
[23:54] brings you real close to god he says
[23:56] that she came boaz came from bethlehem
[23:59] and said unto the reapers the lord be
[24:01] with you
[24:02] and they answered the lord bless thee
[24:07] so notice how the story goes and just
[24:10] the the
[24:12] conjunction of verse 3 and verse 4
[24:14] once ruth came to the field
[24:17] the lord of the harvest appears in the
[24:18] field
[24:19] once ruth is there it says boaz came
[24:22] from bethlehem now ruth doesn't know him
[24:26] but this isn't a story
[24:29] this isn't a story of coincidence
[24:31] we've just pointed out in verse three
[24:33] even though the bible says oh she just
[24:34] kind of happened in the field of boss
[24:36] something is leading her
[24:37] something is getting her this isn't but
[24:39] this isn't coincidence saying oh well
[24:40] this happened can you believe this
[24:42] happened and that happened and you're
[24:43] just reaching for straws we took several
[24:45] services looking at how many parallels
[24:47] there are to the what god is doing in
[24:49] this day so we know these things aren't
[24:51] coincidence we know god is watching over
[24:53] this story because it speaks such a
[24:54] beautiful thing to us so it's not just a
[24:56] story of coincidences there's a hidden
[24:58] meaning in it that when we see it it
[25:00] brings us close to god and then ruth she
[25:03] comes to the field and she's going to
[25:05] find substance to feed her soul or to
[25:08] feed herself and to feed naomi and as
[25:10] the time that she arrives boaz decides
[25:13] to come
[25:14] so beautiful
[25:16] verse 5 then said boaz unto his servant
[25:18] that was said of the reapers whose
[25:20] damsel is this
[25:22] now notice there was one who was the
[25:24] head
[25:25] over all the reapers one who is the head
[25:28] over all the laborers and boaz meets
[25:30] with the messenger first
[25:33] that's who he meets with first he meets
[25:35] with the messenger first he meets with
[25:36] the the one who set over the reapers and
[25:38] he's there one set over the labors he'd
[25:40] be like a prophet and ministry
[25:42] underneath that prophet they're all
[25:43] subject one to another boaz he goes to
[25:46] the one who said of the reaper says
[25:47] whose damsel is this so when boaz wants
[25:50] to talk he wants to start talking about
[25:52] one person he's not talking about all
[25:54] the other reapers he's not talking about
[25:55] all the other women all the other people
[25:57] in the field his subject is the bride
[26:00] and and i want to suggest this and i
[26:02] appreciate you that uh just kind of
[26:03] bearing with me to say this boaz came
[26:07] and it's i would like to say this it's
[26:09] not even that she stood out but he knew
[26:12] beforehand
[26:14] yeah she might have dressed a little bit
[26:15] different and when he says whose damsel
[26:17] is this he might have asked what nation
[26:19] is she from because she might not look
[26:20] like all the other women and she might
[26:22] have been dressing just a little bit
[26:23] different but as i continue to read in
[26:25] this story boaz inquires of ruth because
[26:27] that is why he came
[26:30] it's not again it's not just coincidence
[26:32] that boaz shows up but boaz is coming
[26:34] god had been leading ruth now he's
[26:37] directing boaz and when boaz comes it's
[26:39] as if there's something already in his
[26:41] heart that he wants to know about ruth
[26:43] he wants to know about her he's wanting
[26:45] to become acquainted with her he wants
[26:47] to have an introduction with her but
[26:49] before he can talk to her he comes to
[26:51] the messenger first and then the
[26:53] introduction is made to ruth
[26:56] think about the type to the time that
[26:57] we're living in
[26:59] then in verse six and seven and the
[27:01] servant that was said over the reapers
[27:03] answered and said
[27:05] it is the moabitess damsel that came
[27:07] back with naomi out of the country of
[27:10] moab
[27:11] and she said again look at the humility
[27:14] of ruth
[27:15] i pray you let me glean and gather after
[27:18] the reapers among the sheaves so she
[27:20] came and have continued even from the
[27:22] morning until now that she carried
[27:25] little in the house she wasn't busying
[27:27] herself with anything else she was
[27:29] staying in the field from the morning
[27:31] even until now labor and she asked
[27:34] permission first
[27:36] and she's there laboring in this field
[27:38] gathering of these sheaves and trying to
[27:40] bring in grain that she could feed
[27:41] herself
[27:42] and naomi and so it speaks again to the
[27:45] character of ruth and it kind of gives
[27:47] it gives us a precursor of what had
[27:49] happened
[27:50] so she shows up led by god's divine
[27:53] providence and there's a messenger there
[27:55] there's a one who's over the reapers and
[27:57] he's the one there that's going to allow
[27:59] her to begin to glean and to begin to
[28:01] reap and it would be under his direction
[28:03] that she begins to be able to gather
[28:05] some grain and to gather these things
[28:07] together so that it can support her and
[28:09] so it kind of gives us a backstory what
[28:11] had happened that morning
[28:13] but now after the messenger after the
[28:15] servant who is said of the reapers has
[28:17] this conversation with boaz verses 8 9
[28:20] it says then said boaz under ruth
[28:23] here is thou not my daughter
[28:26] go not to glean in another field neither
[28:30] go from hence but abide here fast by my
[28:35] maidens
[28:36] notice what he's telling her notice the
[28:38] instruction that he's given her this is
[28:40] this is how christ ought to speak to you
[28:43] you ought to have a conviction that what
[28:45] you're feeding on is the truth you ought
[28:47] to be convinced that the thing that is
[28:49] leading you and guiding you is the lord
[28:51] himself and not to have this attitude
[28:54] well i just want to hedge a little bit
[28:55] and i want to i want to dabble in this
[28:57] and dabble in that and seek out this and
[28:59] seek out that and kind of hedge yourself
[29:01] with all sorts of ideas and theologies
[29:03] and groups and doctrines and belief
[29:04] systems you want to know that where god
[29:07] has led you is the place where there is
[29:09] an absolute there's a place where the
[29:11] voice of god is where the word is
[29:13] feeding you and there's no question that
[29:15] there's a source of life that's going to
[29:17] lead me and guide me
[29:19] something that's going to wash me
[29:21] something has a source of salvation a
[29:22] source of healing and this is exactly
[29:24] what boaz is trying to get ruth to
[29:26] understand there's no other place to go
[29:30] go not to glean in another field neither
[29:32] go from hence but abide here fast by my
[29:34] maidens let thine eyes be in the field
[29:36] that they do reap and go thou after them
[29:40] stay in the field have i not charged the
[29:42] young men that thou shalt that they
[29:44] shall not touch thee and when thou art
[29:46] the thirst go unto the vessels and drink
[29:48] of that which the young men have drawn
[29:51] he said i'll provide whatever you need
[29:53] i'm gonna have young men labored in this
[29:55] field who are charged that they are
[29:57] you're not her property you're you are
[29:59] not their their token you are not theirs
[30:02] to abuse they are not you are not theirs
[30:04] to tell what to do but they're there
[30:06] merely to feed you and to support you
[30:09] and to be there to labor together with
[30:11] you in the harvest to see that you get
[30:12] what you need
[30:13] and what i want you to take from this is
[30:15] you set your eyes upon these verses and
[30:18] ponder what is being said by boaz to
[30:20] ruth ruth still doesn't know exactly
[30:22] what's transpiring she doesn't know how
[30:24] this story ends but boaz being led by
[30:27] god and maybe even beforehand knowing
[30:29] who she was goes to her and says don't
[30:31] go anywhere else to feed don't go
[30:33] anywhere else for ideas don't go
[30:35] anywhere else for support but stay right
[30:37] here in the word of god and that listen
[30:39] this is a word to us there is no other
[30:42] message
[30:44] there is not to be an eighth messenger
[30:45] there is not to be another move of god
[30:47] there is not to be some other bible
[30:49] that's to be written christ is the name
[30:51] of the lord jesus christ is the only
[30:53] name under heaven given whereby men
[30:56] shall be saved and there's only one
[30:57] savior there is only one atonement there
[31:00] is no other message he's saying i'll
[31:02] give you servants who will feed you i'll
[31:04] give you water that'll quench your
[31:05] thirst and i'm telling you come to a
[31:07] place in the word of god you've come to
[31:09] a word in this hour where it's a field
[31:12] that you should not leave
[31:14] it's a place for us to stay
[31:17] not to another field don't glean in
[31:19] another field
[31:20] don't get your eyes caught into
[31:21] something else
[31:23] you want to know that you've come to
[31:24] that field
[31:26] verse 10
[31:27] notice again her humility she fell on
[31:29] her face
[31:30] and bowed herself to the ground covering
[31:32] her face as it were veiling herself as
[31:34] it were and said why have i found grace
[31:36] and thine eyes
[31:38] that thou should just take knowledge of
[31:39] me
[31:40] seeing i am a stranger
[31:43] why why me
[31:44] why would you show this kindness to me
[31:48] why would you express
[31:50] such words to me
[31:53] now verse 11 i'd like to read verse 11
[31:55] and 12
[31:56] from the targum as we read from it
[31:58] before so that you could see
[32:00] this
[32:01] if you go ahead and get that up there
[32:03] verses 11 and 12. i want to read it from
[32:05] the targum so that
[32:07] again this is more conversational and it
[32:10] injects certain things in there so you
[32:11] could catch
[32:13] how the traditionally how they viewed
[32:15] this exchange between boaz and ruth
[32:19] boaz replied and said to her it has
[32:21] surely been told to me concerning the
[32:23] word of the sages that when the lord
[32:26] decreed concerning them he did not
[32:28] decree any against any but the men
[32:31] and it was told to me by prophecy
[32:35] that there will come forth from you
[32:37] kings and prophets
[32:39] because of all the kindness which you
[32:40] have done for your mother-in-law
[32:42] he's not there she just happened to feel
[32:45] the boaz but boaz just didn't run into a
[32:47] beautiful moabite girl that morning and
[32:49] say oh she's cute i'd like to get her
[32:50] number hey what's your snap can you give
[32:52] me your phone number hey can we keep in
[32:54] touch can i you know can i hit you up on
[32:56] instagram no he knew by prophecy
[32:59] god had already spoken to this man in
[33:01] him who is his strength this valiant man
[33:04] this man as the bible tells us that he
[33:06] was a mighty man of valor a man of great
[33:08] wealth a man who was mighty in the law
[33:11] and knew the word and was in tune to the
[33:13] prophecies he says it was told to me by
[33:15] prophecy that from you would come kings
[33:17] from you would come prophets because of
[33:19] your kindness to your mother-in-law
[33:21] because you have supported her after
[33:23] your husband died and you forsook your
[33:24] god and your people and your father and
[33:27] mother in the land of your birth and
[33:28] went to become a proselyte and to dwell
[33:31] among the people who are not known to
[33:32] you before may the lord repay you a good
[33:35] payment in his world for your in this
[33:37] world for your good deeds and may your
[33:39] reward be perfect in the next world from
[33:42] before the lord the god of israel to
[33:44] whom you've come to become a proselyte
[33:46] and to sh and and to shelter under the
[33:49] shadow of his glory of shekinah and by
[33:52] that marriage you will be saved from the
[33:54] judgment of guyana which is hell so that
[33:56] your portion notices your portion may be
[33:59] with sarah and rebecca and rachel and
[34:02] leah
[34:03] there's no other place he could have put
[34:06] her that would have been greater to a
[34:08] hebrew for an israelite to say it these
[34:11] matriarchs of sarah rebecca rachel leah
[34:14] there could be none greater if you say
[34:16] the god of abraham isaac and jacob that
[34:18] would speak of the eternal omnipotent
[34:21] omniscient god of abraham isaac and
[34:23] jacob who was the god of israel but then
[34:26] to say sarah rebecca rache and leah were
[34:28] then to bring in the motherhood the wife
[34:30] and the the very matriarchs of the
[34:32] people of israel kind of like the
[34:34] keystone joining the children to these
[34:37] men of abraham isaac and jacob this is
[34:40] such a tremendous statement that he
[34:42] makes he's saying look may god give your
[34:45] portion
[34:47] may god give your portion as a gentile
[34:49] woman with sarah rebecca rachel and leah
[34:52] how could this be unless she be a type
[34:55] of the very bride of the heavenly
[34:58] bridegroom
[35:00] the very wife of the lord of glory
[35:04] so ruth
[35:06] now in this scene as you see here
[35:10] now you have a woman and a man standing
[35:12] in the field
[35:15] ruth has been brought to boaz
[35:17] and what he's doing is he's prophesying
[35:18] over her
[35:20] you may not realize it
[35:22] but you're going to give birth to kings
[35:24] you're going to give birth to prophets
[35:26] you're going to be counted among sarah
[35:27] rebecca rache and leah
[35:30] what's happening they're acting out
[35:31] redemption
[35:33] portraying that bride type
[35:35] and in this as he speaks and he brings
[35:38] ruth is there with boaz
[35:40] in the field
[35:41] he speaks of
[35:43] rebecca
[35:45] and may your portion be with rebecca
[35:47] and in genesis chapter 24 i'd like to
[35:49] read verses 63 to 67
[35:52] just to see this the symmetry now
[35:55] with with isaac
[35:58] and it speaks of how that isaac had come
[36:01] down he had been dwelling in the south
[36:02] country comes back to this he's in this
[36:04] other place now it says isaac went out
[36:06] to meditate in the field
[36:09] at the evening tide
[36:11] at evening time he comes
[36:14] he arrives to a place he arrives to
[36:16] meditate in the field he comes to a
[36:17] certain place in the field and he lifted
[36:20] up his eyes and saw and behold the
[36:22] camels were coming
[36:24] and this is the camel train of the
[36:26] servant of abraham and what is he doing
[36:27] he's bringing back rebecca
[36:30] and so he had come to a specific place
[36:32] where his bride was going to be coming
[36:34] to he was coming to the place to where
[36:36] the shout the messenger bringing the
[36:39] bride forth bringing it to isaac and
[36:42] this is the very place that isaac finds
[36:44] himself we see this parallel that
[36:45] there's been a shout a messenger the
[36:47] bread of life bringing forth the bride
[36:49] where is it going to bring her to not
[36:51] some geographical location in indiana
[36:53] and not some a sparse place in alaska
[36:55] we're not all going to be herded into
[36:57] railcars and shipped off to some
[36:58] concentration camp no it's the word of
[37:01] god gathering us to christ
[37:05] and she comes he comes to this place
[37:08] in the evening time he lifts up his eyes
[37:10] and sees the camel's coming and rebecca
[37:13] lifted up her eyes
[37:14] and when she saw isaac
[37:17] she lighted off the camel she jumped off
[37:19] the camel she began to run to this one
[37:22] and i think it's beautiful how the bible
[37:24] then tells us why
[37:26] for she had said unto her servant so
[37:28] before she ran to him
[37:30] she had said
[37:32] what man is that walking in the field to
[37:34] meet us
[37:36] who is this man and the servant said it
[37:39] is my master therefore she took a veil
[37:42] and covered herself
[37:44] at the very time when ruth is standing
[37:46] there before boaz and boyz begins to
[37:48] speak these wonderful things to her and
[37:50] tell her how he's going to take care of
[37:51] her she fell on her face and covered
[37:53] herself she veiled her face before boaz
[37:56] and now when when rebecca finds out who
[37:59] is this man coming towards us in the
[38:01] field she's not sure who it is but
[38:03] something in her prompts her to ask the
[38:05] question and the master the servant of
[38:07] the master says it is my master it is
[38:11] isaac the one i told you about behold
[38:14] your bridegroom cometh he comes out to
[38:16] meet you and then she covered her face
[38:19] and humbled herself and ran out to meet
[38:21] him in the field
[38:23] do you see the parallel to what what has
[38:25] happened for us in the word of god in
[38:27] this hour
[38:29] and whereas it's not us that's asking
[38:31] the questions
[38:32] but the messenger begins to preach
[38:33] sermons like who is jesus what is the
[38:36] attraction on the mount who is this
[38:37] melchizedek who do you say this is
[38:41] right
[38:43] and asking these questions and the
[38:44] questions weren't his the question was
[38:46] actually ours
[38:47] the question was actually that of the
[38:49] bride the question was actually the
[38:50] response of the people who is jesus who
[38:53] what is the attraction of the mouth who
[38:55] is this melchizedek who do you say this
[38:57] is
[38:59] where are we now identified christ of
[39:01] all ages i believe the subtitle is where
[39:03] where are we now what what's transpiring
[39:05] now what's happening who is this man
[39:08] what are we confronted with what are
[39:09] these signs speaking of what's taking
[39:12] place in this hour and those sermons
[39:14] were an answer to the question that was
[39:16] in our heart and when we catch the
[39:18] answer it is your master behold the
[39:21] master is come once again the master's
[39:23] here and he call it for thee then that's
[39:26] what motivates us to run into the field
[39:31] and this is what's transpiring in
[39:32] genesis 24.
[39:34] it's what's taking place in ruth chapter
[39:36] 2.
[39:38] and these are just maybe little things
[39:40] that
[39:41] i don't i don't know that they mean much
[39:43] but
[39:44] the
[39:45] kind of the types of people who love the
[39:47] numbers
[39:49] it's in verse 65
[39:51] that the introduction is made
[39:55] chapter 24
[39:56] verse 65.
[39:59] april six at five o'clock in the morning
[40:00] a prophet was born
[40:02] on the 24th day of the 12th month
[40:05] of 1965 the 24th day of last month a
[40:08] year
[40:08] 1965 he passes away
[40:12] the introduction had been made
[40:14] his job had been done
[40:17] so the next verse and the servant told
[40:19] isaac all the things he had done
[40:21] the servant now can go report beyond the
[40:24] curtain of time he can go make the
[40:25] report and say i've done my part i've
[40:28] done what to do and then what transpires
[40:30] this is where the mystery is and isaac
[40:32] brought her into his mother sarah's tent
[40:34] and took rebecca and she became his wife
[40:36] and he loved her and isaac was comforted
[40:39] after his mother's death
[40:42] this is the mystery that unfolds after
[40:43] the introduction
[40:47] we see that in genesis chapter 24
[40:50] back to ruth chapter 2.
[40:53] i know we really amplified verses 11 and
[40:55] 12 but as he brings the picture of sarah
[40:57] rebecca rachel and lee into the picture
[41:00] then ruth responds in verse 13 then she
[41:02] said
[41:03] let me find favorite thy sight my lord
[41:06] for that thou hast comforted me
[41:09] we see the comfort now being given
[41:12] and for that thou has spoken friendly
[41:14] unto thine handmaid
[41:16] though i be like unto one of
[41:18] i'd be not like under one of thy
[41:20] handmaids
[41:21] and boaz said unto her listen this is
[41:23] the if you go back and just remember the
[41:25] whole thought theme of this if you're
[41:26] hungry you need to be fed
[41:28] right you need to feed on the right
[41:30] things you need to be eating to live
[41:31] this is this is where we ought to be in
[41:33] our revelation this is what we ought to
[41:35] be certain of
[41:36] and boaz said unto her at meal time come
[41:39] thou hither
[41:40] and eat of the bread
[41:41] and dip thy morsel in the vinegar now
[41:44] this is an invitation that you just
[41:45] don't give to anybody
[41:46] it's not yeah there's you know there's a
[41:48] soup line over here there's a bread line
[41:49] over here yeah just you can come and you
[41:50] can pick what you want but no he's
[41:52] inviting her to the table
[41:54] at meal time come and sup with me
[41:56] revelations 3 20 come and eat with me at
[41:58] meal time don't just get the scraps
[42:00] don't be begging for bread but at meal
[42:02] time come thou hither let me just
[42:04] express this to you you ought to have a
[42:07] relationship with god
[42:09] and something that's leading you to when
[42:11] it comes time for church you know you're
[42:13] showing up at a table where you belong
[42:15] where you can eat bread and you can dip
[42:17] your morsel in the vinegar
[42:20] listen this is not an hour we say well
[42:22] if we can't get a whole loaf i want a
[42:23] slice find a whole loaf
[42:26] we're not living in the hour of scraps
[42:27] we're not living in the hour begging for
[42:29] bread we're living in the hour where a
[42:30] full seven course meal has been made
[42:33] available to the bread we ought not to
[42:34] be beggars anymore we ought to be at a
[42:36] table where we know we can dip in the
[42:38] vinegar
[42:41] and meal time come and eat eat of the
[42:42] bread dip thy morsel in the vinegar and
[42:44] she sat beside the reapers
[42:46] and she's close to him because he
[42:48] reached her parts corn i guess maybe the
[42:51] grammar tea english teachers might be
[42:53] like what
[42:54] can you borrow me a pen
[42:56] says he reached her parts court it means
[42:57] he handed it out to her
[43:00] he gave her parts corn and she did eat
[43:02] and was sufficed
[43:04] and left
[43:06] what a privilege
[43:07] what a privilege is being extended to
[43:09] roof she's not quite sure what's
[43:10] happening she just knows this is
[43:12] wonderful this is great can't we all
[43:14] testify when god got a hold of us we
[43:16] started walking in the blessed light of
[43:17] the word of god we said this is
[43:19] wonderful this is great the fellowship
[43:21] we have the provision we have the
[43:22] churches we're going to and the things
[43:24] we're fellowshipping it oh i haven't
[43:26] known such joy this is so wonderful this
[43:27] is so great the privilege that god
[43:29] extended the fact that he passed to her
[43:32] the parched corn and as she eats it it's
[43:34] satisfying in her it's given her
[43:36] something she needs
[43:37] oh are you hungry this is what will
[43:40] satisfy are are you being fed this is
[43:43] the only kind of table that's going to
[43:45] feed you to where you can be satisfied
[43:47] when you leave
[43:49] oh so beautiful
[43:51] now i'm going to skip
[43:53] verses 15 and 16. i want to come back to
[43:55] them
[43:57] i want to come back to it just because i
[43:58] feel like the emphasis there will fit
[44:01] in a moment
[44:03] in verse 17 now after she's been given
[44:05] these wonderful things
[44:07] it says so she gleaned in the field
[44:09] until even
[44:11] and beat out that she had gleaned
[44:14] and it was about an ifa of barley
[44:16] and she took it up
[44:18] and went into the city now this is a lot
[44:21] and ethan this would be what would have
[44:22] been offered as a wave sheath this is
[44:24] just not a few scraps let's see if we
[44:26] can make a little biscuit she's got
[44:28] she's got a whole fifa of barley and she
[44:31] took it went to the city and her
[44:32] mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned
[44:35] and she brought forth and gave it to her
[44:37] that she had reserved
[44:39] and gave to her that she had reserved
[44:41] after she was sufficed
[44:43] and her mother-in-law said in her where
[44:44] is thou gleaned today
[44:46] and where rodist thou bless be he that
[44:49] did take knowledge of thee
[44:51] and she showed her mother-in-law with
[44:53] whom she had wrought so she knew wow
[44:55] what look at this bounty that she's
[44:57] bringing this is marvelous and said the
[44:59] man now ruth says the man's name with
[45:01] whom i wrought today is boaz
[45:06] now this is
[45:07] this is just ruth trying trying to tell
[45:09] the story
[45:10] oh you know i just kind of ran into this
[45:12] field saw some people gleaning i thought
[45:13] i asked permission if i could follow
[45:15] behind the reapers and i began to gling
[45:17] and and so she's saying in the man's
[45:19] field the man's name i wrought today
[45:21] because that's the question that naomi
[45:22] had was boaz and naomi said under her
[45:25] daughter-in-law her her response is very
[45:28] effusive it's it is she has this great
[45:31] excitement blessed be he of the lord who
[45:34] hath not left off his kindness to the
[45:36] living and to the dead naomi and ruth
[45:39] the the living but then when she says
[45:40] also to the dead she's evoking this this
[45:44] connection to redemption that they which
[45:46] are lives then remaining and those that
[45:49] were dead had gone past the hope of
[45:51] redemption had to be made through those
[45:53] that were alive and she's saying we who
[45:55] are living you ruth who are alive have
[45:57] made contact with one today that gives
[46:00] hope to those that are dead this can
[46:02] revive those that are dead this can give
[46:04] life to a limit like this can give life
[46:05] to muhammad this is this is amazing his
[46:08] kindness to the living of the dead and
[46:10] naomi said unto her the man is near of
[46:13] kin unto us
[46:15] this is not just an acquaintance of my
[46:17] husband this is not just somebody that
[46:19] your your father when he was a child
[46:20] would have known but she says he is one
[46:22] of our next kinsmen
[46:25] this is though it's translated the same
[46:27] but this isn't the same word that's used
[46:28] in verse one in verse one it's yadda
[46:30] he's acquaintance yeah i know him he's
[46:32] an acquaintance but now when it got uses
[46:34] this word in chapter in verse 20 of
[46:37] chapter two he is our girl it means he
[46:41] is one that can redeem or act as a
[46:43] kinsmen redeemer when she says he is the
[46:46] next kinsman it's actually taken from
[46:48] the word this word is actually
[46:50] translated to redeem in the old
[46:52] testament it was he is our redemption he
[46:56] is our redeemer and so there's a
[46:58] revelation that comes from the word
[47:00] there's a revelation that comes from
[47:02] naomi which we are using even to be
[47:03] reflective of the scripture that listen
[47:06] ruth you haven't just happened into some
[47:08] field where someone is being kind to you
[47:10] you haven't just happened into an
[47:11] assembly or into a belief system where
[47:14] they're going to kind of take care of
[47:15] you and have systems in place that help
[47:17] the struggling widows and help those who
[47:18] don't have this and kind of show you the
[47:20] ways of salvation and teach us the 12
[47:22] steps to get along in a wicked age none
[47:24] of those things are transpiring for
[47:26] she's saying you have actually came into
[47:28] the field unknowingly to you to the one
[47:31] who can redeem us
[47:34] she had no idea what was happening but
[47:36] that's where she found herself
[47:38] and if you could place yourself right
[47:40] here in the harmony of this word and see
[47:42] yourself in the trajectory or even the
[47:44] journey of ruth when god led us to this
[47:47] word we knew that something told us to
[47:49] stay here and we've never left it we
[47:51] knew that something was in this word
[47:53] that satisfied and we stayed in this
[47:56] word and we stayed faithful to it
[47:58] regardless of what was happening and he
[47:59] began to feed us and he began to sustain
[48:01] us but in the process of time the
[48:03] scripture comes alive and we realize it
[48:06] isn't just a son of man but where we've
[48:08] actually been feeding and where we've
[48:10] been fed it's not just a field but it's
[48:13] the field of the son of man
[48:17] these aren't things that all became
[48:18] apparent to us and opened up to us on
[48:20] day one oh yeah well no this is where
[48:22] i'll be no it was progressive to us
[48:26] and some of us can have this revelation
[48:27] as of late
[48:29] whoa
[48:30] i thought i was just biding my time in
[48:32] this field until something else was
[48:34] going to happen
[48:35] but the very thing i've been asking for
[48:37] the very thing i was hoping for the very
[48:38] thing that we thought we were all
[48:39] waiting for is happening right next to
[48:41] us
[48:43] very thing we fasted for and prayed for
[48:45] and shouted for and tried to call the
[48:46] caps down for the very thing we all
[48:48] believed that was was so supposed to be
[48:50] happening but would happen one day is
[48:52] happening right around me this is
[48:55] redemption
[48:58] listen it's not by accident we've been
[49:00] drawn together
[49:02] going for a second just think don't
[49:03] think about what god's doing here is
[49:04] just natural
[49:06] don't don't think about though our
[49:07] challenges as of late have been in
[49:09] natural things and where are we going to
[49:10] meet and what's what's the next step for
[49:12] us as far as having a natural building
[49:13] it could be that god is just sparing us
[49:15] the natural building because we're going
[49:17] to a new tabernacle
[49:19] one that won't dissolve
[49:21] and here we are gathered around things
[49:22] that matter things that are important
[49:24] it's not by accident we've been drawn
[49:25] together what have we been drawn
[49:26] together for not to play church not to
[49:28] start a church but for the fullness of
[49:30] redemption
[49:31] that's our objective and that's our aim
[49:34] is the fullness of redemption
[49:37] and that's what brought ruth to that
[49:39] field that day
[49:41] and she went home with a full bag she
[49:42] had no idea
[49:44] wow this is quite a haul
[49:47] and it was naomi that says ruth this
[49:49] just isn't a man
[49:51] just this isn't some nice guy this just
[49:53] isn't some rich guy this is the very one
[49:55] that can redeem
[49:56] you and so ruth says in verses 21 and 23
[50:01] she says well he said unto me also thou
[50:03] shalt keep fast by my young men
[50:05] until they have ended all my harvest
[50:08] this is what he said stay in this field
[50:11] i've got servants that'll keep look out
[50:13] after you true servants who won't abuse
[50:15] you true ones who'll look out after you
[50:16] true ones that'll feed you stay fast by
[50:18] my young men these young men are going
[50:20] to take this message in a more powerful
[50:22] way than it is now that they're going to
[50:24] take these things and preach them to you
[50:25] stay with them this is my this is my
[50:27] field this is my word stay in the field
[50:29] i've got servants who will feed you
[50:30] shepherds that's my own heart who who
[50:32] will look out after you who will feed
[50:34] you and you'll feel no fear no more he's
[50:35] telling to stay in this field
[50:38] and it's even what we skipped in verses
[50:40] 15 and 16 and when she began when she
[50:42] was risen up to gleam boaz commanded his
[50:44] young men saying this is what he told
[50:46] him this is the mystery of why ruth was
[50:48] going away with such a big haul this is
[50:50] what he had told the servants let her
[50:52] glean even among the sheaves
[50:55] and reproach her knot
[50:57] don't hassle her don't manipulate her
[51:00] don't control her don't scare her off
[51:03] don't tell her that that's your corn
[51:04] don't tell her that that's your field
[51:06] don't tell her that it's your job and
[51:08] your
[51:08] your testimony and your ministry you
[51:11] make sure she gets the grain you make
[51:14] sure she can harvest reproach or not
[51:16] shame or not buff it or not turn it away
[51:18] not and let fall also some of the
[51:21] handfuls of purpose for her and leave
[51:23] them that she may glean them and rebuke
[51:26] her not
[51:27] as he had ordained
[51:29] servants in the field to be sure that
[51:32] ruth would get everything she needed
[51:34] that's why he said hold fast to my young
[51:36] men why because these young men were
[51:38] under a commission they had been under
[51:40] commission that until the rapture is
[51:42] over you see that ruth is fed until this
[51:45] harvest is done you see that she's
[51:47] looked out after you remain faithful
[51:50] i've commanded them not to touch you
[51:51] i've commanded them that they're not
[51:53] yours but you will harvest among my
[51:55] sheaves and in my field as one that has
[51:58] a right to it as your own
[52:00] just as it says in first kings 17 9 that
[52:03] it when elijah had been sustained at the
[52:05] brook jericho the ravens had come
[52:08] and ravens were feeding him but then it
[52:11] turned and it said go to zeraphath
[52:12] because there i've commanded a widow
[52:14] woman to sustain you
[52:17] just as there have been a widow woman of
[52:18] zarephath this woman to sustain elijah
[52:21] the prophet sustained his ministry we
[52:22] see in type here in ruth chapter 2 that
[52:25] there had been young men commissioned
[52:26] and ordained to look after ruth to be
[52:29] sure that she received everything
[52:31] everything she needed in the harvest
[52:33] time
[52:36] this is this is where i'm concluding
[52:38] is we should be able to see ourselves in
[52:40] this this is the place
[52:42] ordained to satisfy your hunger
[52:45] this is the revelation
[52:47] that it's not just
[52:49] a message it's not just a messenger it's
[52:51] not just a religion it's not just a
[52:53] thought process it's not just a way of
[52:55] viewing things to try to make sense of
[52:56] the world but it is the living bread of
[53:00] life
[53:02] it is christ who satisfies your hunger
[53:07] this is where we eat to live
[53:10] what we see in taipei ruth chapter 2
[53:12] this is where we eat to live this is
[53:14] what we eat to live
[53:16] the word of god
[53:17] and when i say the word i'm talking
[53:19] about the the fullness of it
[53:21] we should be in it we should be feeding
[53:23] on it not not have a pet doctrine where
[53:25] we just want to kind of feed on this one
[53:27] area and really drill down in this one
[53:29] area or we just want to go over here and
[53:31] drill down in this and feed on that but
[53:32] we want the whole word of god
[53:35] we want the promises for this day to be
[53:37] made alive to us by revelation we want
[53:39] to be walking where he is and in his
[53:41] presence where the shekinah glory is
[53:44] this is where we're this is what
[53:46] satisfies the hunger
[53:51] but mike if you'd come
[53:53] brother braham says and proven his word
[53:54] in the last days there's got to be a
[53:56] place prepared for the word to be made
[53:58] manifest
[54:00] and we're now living by the evidence of
[54:02] the new land
[54:04] the son of man
[54:06] living by it that means it's what's
[54:08] causing us to live
[54:10] we're living by it it's our substance
[54:17] it's what sustains us
[54:19] and what's the evidence of the new land
[54:22] the son of man
[54:25] in one way we could say he is that land
[54:28] it's the land of the son of man the son
[54:30] of man we're living with the evidence of
[54:32] it we're living with the fruits of it
[54:34] it's what feeds us
[54:36] so the chapter ends
[54:38] verses 22 and 23
[54:42] and naomi said unto ruth her
[54:43] daughter-in-law
[54:44] it is good my daughter
[54:46] that thou go out with his maidens
[54:49] that they meet thee not in any other
[54:51] field
[54:53] and this is what it speaks of ruth so
[54:55] she kept fast by the maidens of boaz to
[54:57] glean
[54:58] unto the end of the barley harvest
[55:00] and of wheat harvest
[55:02] and dwelt
[55:03] with her mother-in-law
[55:07] there's a place
[55:09] where you can be satisfied
[55:12] where he reaches you parks corn
[55:15] where he allows you to dip the morsel in
[55:17] the vinegar
[55:18] where you can eat and be satisfied
[55:21] [Music]
[55:23] and in all our satisfying and all the
[55:26] pleasure that we derive
[55:28] from the word
[55:30] sometimes there's just a greater
[55:31] revelation that shows us just exactly
[55:33] who's feeding us
[55:35] it's not personality it's never been a
[55:37] man it's never been associated
[55:39] merely with
[55:40] people
[55:42] but it's about christ
[55:45] there's a place there's got to be a
[55:46] place where the word is made manifest
[55:51] and we can live by this
[55:53] absolutely live by it are you hungry
[55:56] i am hungry
[55:58] then there's a word that can feed us
[56:01] there's a word made available this in
[56:02] this hour where we eat it
[56:05] we don't live to eat we eat to live
[56:08] it's not pretense it's not for show it's
[56:10] not to put on it's not to have put on
[56:12] these airs of having church and and in
[56:15] some formidable group that needs to be
[56:17] reckoned with but it's about coming to a
[56:19] place where we're at a table to eat
[56:22] and what i get on a wednesday night is
[56:24] is to feed me on a thursday morning what
[56:26] i feed on a sunday morning should be
[56:28] paying dividends on a tuesday afternoon
[56:30] making differences in my relationships
[56:32] making differences in how i relate to
[56:33] money making differences and how i
[56:35] perceive offenses
[56:37] and and talk about things and process
[56:39] things and experience things there's a
[56:41] place there's a table that i can be
[56:43] eating at there's a there's food that i
[56:45] can be processing
[56:47] towards causing me to be healthy
[56:48] spiritually
[56:50] it is the bread of life in this hour so
[56:52] we've been invited to come to bethlehem
[56:55] and we realized that as we come to
[56:56] bethlehem there's a condition that we
[56:58] must come out of and as we come out of
[57:00] that condition and fight through that
[57:01] condition there's an opposition that'll
[57:03] come against us and certainly we know it
[57:05] comes to a showdown but this is what
[57:07] awaits you
[57:09] when you've made that clear-cut decision
[57:11] and say i'm going all the way with the
[57:12] lord i know i've made up my mind i've
[57:15] got to enter into this promise i've got
[57:17] to come into this place when you come
[57:19] into this place what awaits you is your
[57:21] boaz who will give you the clean
[57:23] profiter who'll give you the word of god
[57:25] who's ordained servants to look out
[57:27] after you and it's that very promise of
[57:29] christ boaz in the field that's even
[57:32] brought you forth to begin with how did
[57:34] you ever make it out of the condition
[57:36] how did you ever make it past the
[57:37] opposition why did you ever win in the
[57:39] showdown because there was one going to
[57:41] meet you in the field
[57:42] it was always the living bread of life
[57:44] bringing forth the bride
[57:46] that's what's going to feed you
[57:49] praise the lord let's stand to our feet
[57:52] thank you jesus
[57:55] thank you lord
[57:56] [Music]
[58:03] bow your heads with me please
[58:07] [Music]
[58:13] i know that
[58:15] in
[58:16] walking through these scriptures
[58:19] reading even that statement i read at
[58:21] the last
[58:22] there's things contained in this and
[58:24] even things that i'm alluding to
[58:26] you might even say well it seems almost
[58:27] cryptic or you're pointing to certain
[58:29] things
[58:30] if those things aren't quicken to you or
[58:32] you don't understand those things
[58:36] then you don't don't try to view it
[58:37] through my eyes
[58:39] don't try to figure out well what point
[58:41] is brother aaron trying to make or what
[58:42] what's he alluding to
[58:44] ask yourself what does christ want me to
[58:46] see
[58:47] what does he want you to see tonight
[58:50] what more does he have for you
[58:53] that you're not feeding on
[58:55] what greater understanding could you
[58:57] have of the word that he can give you
[59:01] and just look at it very personal
[59:02] tonight
[59:05] because these things
[59:06] must be personal to us with heads bowed
[59:08] you want the lord to touch you tonight
[59:10] you need healing lift your hand to him
[59:12] you need deliverance lift your hand to
[59:14] him
[59:15] whatever you have need of he's here
[59:17] present tense
[59:18] to meet those needs
[59:20] a gracious heavenly father
[59:22] hands are raised all over this
[59:24] church tonight
[59:26] and it could be
[59:28] dozens of different needs lord
[59:32] dozens of different expressions and
[59:35] a request
[59:37] dozens of different circumstances even
[59:39] within the same household
[59:41] you could have different personalities
[59:44] and different approaches and different
[59:45] perceptions and different needs even
[59:47] within a marriage a husband crying out
[59:49] for one thing a wife crying out for the
[59:51] other but lord it is striking to know
[59:54] that there can still be one that
[59:56] satisfies
[59:58] and the lord you know just what kind of
[1:00:00] corn to reach to us tonight

[1:00:05] in our hands and invite us to dip into

[1:00:10] impose yourself upon us tonight lord as
[1:00:14] boaz showed up in that field moved by
[1:00:17] prophecy moved by understanding to seek
[1:00:20] out ruth
