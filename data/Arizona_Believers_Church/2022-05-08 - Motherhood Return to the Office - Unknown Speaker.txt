TRANSCRIPT
========================================
i'm going to take the subject on this mother's day and take a uh in a lot of ways as i looked at this and pondered this this past week it's going to be just the way it seemed like it was unfolding gathering together a lot of things that would be review for us and certainly a lot of things that we've ministered on here but maybe more profoundly things that you're already very much aware of and in tune to and so kind of a review of a number of things the gathering together of prior precepts and even some services we've ministered on just kind of collecting them together in this subject of motherhood to give the honor and recognition that's due to our mothers that are here's a lot of statements we could pull from the message of the hour just to give that lot and that honor on a day like today but lord dealt with my heart in titling the sermon on motherhood and with the subtitle of return to the office and so you're like you're going to have to just catch up brother and we've already moved on from that slide we're already back to the offering slide at this point but um my style subject is motherhood and returned to the office now rto returned to the office it's probably a very familiar phrase that we've been hearing anybody heard this phrase recently no you're still a little bit too far in that one getting ahead of me there brother so maybe we back up a little bit if you want i can just go to the last slide and we can go start early on our reservations so we don't have to wait so long for lunch but um uh you've been hearing the phrase maybe return uh to the office returned office back to the office is a phrase that's been very common amongst corporate america and maybe a lot of you are wrestling with it right now it's actually becoming a huge issue with large corporations that have multi-jurisdictions that they have come uh uh entities in or offices in trying to figure out a way to get everybody who's gone home to come back to work and so the other one is work from home that was the big one now they're trying to get people to come back to the office and so i'm wanting to use that just as a familiar phrase to you but put it in this context of motherhood and return to the office and an office is a it speaks to not just a location or a place of work but it speaks of one's place or even one's function so an office is more than just a physical location and part of the one of the things i'm wanting to identify is a woman's true disposition in looking at these scriptures is there's a certain disposition to a woman uh that is outlined in the scripture things that we want to lift up and promote so when we use the phrase motherhood we're looking at the the suffix hood which is in the english uh this last phrase hood it's a particular state or condition or it's a specific period in someone's life and so when you use this hood and you atta it uh added to another word it can speak of a body of persons of a particular class or also if i need to grab a mic just let me know i'm more than happy to do it we're gonna we're gonna one day come up with so many headsets and lapel mics we're gonna be caught from every angle should i grab something i don't mind it's not going to bother me at all i got a good signal now well we'll see where this goes i know you all can hear me here it's just maybe a little bit annoying sometimes it may be on the stream it drops a little bit so it can be used hood can be added to brotherhood that would speak of body of persons who are united in as brothers or maybe a brotherhood in a fraternity or something neighborhood is a particular class of people that live in a particular area or near one another or it can uh denote a state of being this is something i want you to upon or denote a state of being a uh identify a certain character or condition we say someone is enters into fatherhood when they have a child of theirs they enter into fatherhood or during a particular time of life we call it childhood so these are stages even adulthood would be the state or period of being fully grown fully developed or of a particular age that would be adulthood so same thing is meant when we say motherhood it's the state or fact of being a mother that's what we refer to when we refer to motherhood so with motherhood there's a certain duty with motherhood there's a certain function and motherhood speaks of the office of being a mother when someone enters into motherhood or part of the motherhood it is entering into this place or position or function of being a mother and my desire today is just looking at the word of god and drawing some things out of the message the more i pondered it the more pronounced it became to me just how much you work against these days when you preach on true uh the true woman how much you're fighting against when you preach on motherhood and i really appreciated the special i choose to be a christian in a day and age that values so much of personal choice and personal freedom they don't like it when you choose to be a real christian they feel that that choice in itself is the wrong one and so there's a stigma associated with there's a little bit of pressure to try to get you to denounce it but we are uh we are happy i'm happy to live in a time when the day and age we live in you have to choose to believe this message you have to choose to be a christian because it's not easy anymore you can't just fit in in a particular way you can't just kind of go with the flow and so i really want to defend the honor of womanhood and just lift up the glory of motherhood her place and her function through the word of god and one of the this is maybe my thoughts as they come to me in the original genesis of wanting to minister on this i say that false christianity has marginalized the woman and so there's a there's a brand of christianity that tries to take the woman and beat her up and subjugate her and really this um the wrong kind of patriarchy that wants to dominate and domineer treat the woman as a doormat and so that's kind of uh become the poster child or the poster board of what women don't want and so they look at the false side of things they're just making women out to be less they're doormats they're this and they're that and that's the one that gets all the attention but when you look at it that way that there's been a false christianity on one hand that's marginalized the woman really when you look at it this post-modern feminism is just trying to erase her all together that in one sense you have those well they mistreat women but when you come to the other side they're just trying to erase the woman and many may get the definition wrong and and make women what they're not and use the bible to do and use the religion and use uh their strength to make the woman something different and define her wrong but others just even want to go so far as to deny the essence of womanhood and in doing so it's really changing the place of the woman within society it's changing uh what her ambitions ought to be and her roles are and so i started in genesis chapter two but if we could just back up to genesis chapter 1 i'd like to read verse 27 and what i want to do is just take a walk through the bible into just in genesis and then back and then over to proverbs in these real obvious places in the scripture to just look at the genesis of the woman it says in genesis chapter 1 verse 27 so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them oh great here's the they them coming right up in the scripture so god created man in his own image and the image of god created he him male and female created he them brother branham says in marriage and divorce that god has male and female so when we look at this this image of god is male and female and we recognize that this is an entity this is there's a oneness that's being shared and it says god created man in the in the hebrew it's adam that's where we get adam from it's kind of he has the name for all humanity created adam which is man or mankind and it's male and female this humankind this mankind that are appointed they're under divine appointment to manifest the image of god when it says he made them let's make them in our own image in the image of god we're going to create them this is to manifest something about god and the word that is used uh for ma for male because it says that male and female created he them it's god that introduces this division or this distinction male is to comes from the root to call to mind or to remember and so god is wanting us as i even pondered it that god is wanting us this image of man to call to mind god that the way that man would live and the way that he would act and the the power that would be given to him he would call to mind god it would be in a remembrance of god and then female so that's the male and female comes from the root to pierce or to bore through or to a point means to break off or to prick off to designate or to be specified so here's the man who is to call call to one's remembrance or to to to call to mind and then the female is to pierce or to a point or to break off and to designate something specified and it's for it's for a reason that god is using even this language in male and female and we will probably revisit this and uh later on this morning that animals don't ever receive this distinction in the creation it doesn't say that god created a male uh a male of this specie and a female of that it just there's no distinction given but god here is he creates man he wants to denote male and female because it's something that foreshadows the higher purpose for mankind as it recaps in genesis chapter 5 verse 2 it says male and female created he them and blessed them and called their name adam in the day when they were created and so there is a creation of man who are male and of male and female god is precise and even revisits it after the fall that i i've created them this way for a purpose and so their identity and their purpose are linked together male and female blessed male and female together and there's a blessing and i i want to say it at this point that these designations even at the outset are very critical to our understanding creation understanding what god was doing and it's specifically god's purpose for creation and i know that the the scientific approach is that this is kind of just the results of a lottery that's literally the way they teach it that given enough time sales will mutate and given billions and billions of years which they believe we've had the privilege of uh experiencing this is what was produced and so well how did it get here well this is just the order that came from chaos and given enough variations and enough cycles and enough chance to mutate this is just how it evolved and evolved to where we are where we are today by the process of evolution but when we look into the bible what we're finding is that god's design in his creation that it wasn't just thrown out here without purpose it wasn't just thrown out with direction god had a design to it and in verse 28 it says and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it so this is male the male and female in verse 27 this is a male and female under divine order god blessed them and said unto them male and female be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it now i know that we've covered this before i might go into just a little bit more detail but i just feel it's important just to kind of walk through it in these paces and i know these are things we all know but maybe they're just cheap amens when we already know it but male and female each hold genetic attributes distinct to each one that develop certain characteristics that are suited for this commandment says be fruitful multiply and replenish the earth god made male and made female and and they're brought up in this context in genesis 1 27 i've made them male and female because i'm about to give them a commandment and giving this commandment to them they could not fulfill this unless they had this distinction between male and female we know in the genetic chromosomes that the male is an x y and the female is an xx and these chromosomes give rise to a distinct biology don't let anybody lie to you and tell you anything different it's just the truth and i think anybody being with some intellectual honesty would have to admit that biologically there is a difference between the male and female male has an xy the female has xx and that's what determines whether you're a male male or a female something that god in the beginning in the scene set forth and put in there from the very beginning god's already outlined it and put it there from the start to where we don't take we don't have an election at six years old and choose which one we want to be it's already there it's already and it's biologically and so these the in the mail the xy the y chromosome is what's dominant and therefore it's what carries the signal to the embryo and to tell them to grow male organs you're going to be a male they're going to be this is what you are and then there's another side to it and this part and i'm getting in this just to make it part of our thought process so that in in pondering this and thinking about it we are considering um how god has made us how god has designed us and in the uh not only is there chromosomes but there's hormones to this and don't have anybody get nervous you know we're going to keep this very scientific but a hormone is a chemical that's released by a cell or by a gland to regulate activity body activity and regulate behavior and it's what promotes development then of these chromosomes that's written in the dna and the word uh hormone comes from the latin word which means that which sets in motion the presents motion the present participle of impel or to urge on which comes from the very root of it is the onset or impulse so god not only gives there's not only a design behind the chromosomes but then there are hormones that then set in motion and impel and urge on the manifestation of those chromosomes this is all part of the this is how god created us and so both male and female have steroid hormones that influence growth that influence development the androgens which include testosterone for males and that's what causes a male to develop into a boy to develop into a man in the estrogens and progestins for females and what's remarkable is females can have testosterone males have estrogen they both have those but whatever's the dominant is what urges on what propels and drives the chromosomes in the dna to develop into the person and so this the dna blueprint for a male the xy that's what produces the melon so in physical development it's that increased testosterone that matures the body and takes a boy into in into manhood it's the same for a female increased estrogen is what matures her into a woman this is all in creation this is all when god says i created a male and female if there would have been an opportunity i believe even at that moment to say all right hold on let's run some tests you'd find that god created man xy he created the woman xx and that god has already placed inside of them something to urge them on compel them and move them on to produce and to manifest what they were called to be now in genesis chapter 2 verse 18 with the biology out of the way we can start to look at how god is going to unfold this and manifest this genesis chapter 2 verse 18 to 21 it says the lord god said it is not good that the man should be alone i will make him a help meet for him i want to come back to the meaning of this word but then notice how peculiar this is that god inserts this narrative in between the time from the time that he pronounces that man needs a help meet until the time that he manifests her says and out of the ground the lord god formed every beast of the field and every fowl of the air and brought them unto adam to see what he would call them so before adam has this help me he's there in this entity and this person and he's naming uh he's naming all the foul all the beasts everything that was created and he's giving them names and whatsoever adam called every living creature that was the name thereof and adam gave names to all cattle and to the fowl the air and every beast of the field but for adam there was not found a help meet for him what's implied in this image in this image of god bringing all creation before adam it's implied that adam would have been each one each set each animal each kind male female male female and it would have been manifested that here is a buck and here's a doe and one's different than the other but they're very similar there's a they're a compliment to one another this mere image would have kept coming up before him that male female male female it's very it's obvious that it's this and it's obvious that it's that and he'd be able to give a name uh to that specific animal that complimented both the male and female he wouldn't name one uh one a bird and one a fish they would come up and together they would be named something because they're joined together there was something complementary there was an image that was expressed and i believe that it's implied in this narrative that adam would have recognized that whereas every other kind had male and female and he saw the male and he saw the female he saw the image he saw the complimentary image as that's coming up before him he would have thought i'm different i i'm created by the same god and even to think that there would be those that had been very human-like and and very close near to the the stature and nature of adam and he would have seen male female male female he thought well this is very different i don't even have this likeness now we know god's doing this for a reason he's portraying something very beautiful but it's with that image that god comes to verse 21 it says and the lord caused a deep sleep to fall upon adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof so notice now when you say the woman to makes female to get the female out he's got to pierce through adam he's got to bore through adam he's got to prick it off something and break off something and a point and designate a portion of adam he's got to separate mankind separate apart from man and to bring her forth and so that's what male and female it foreshadowed that there was going to be an appointing a designated specifying from this femininity from this mankind and humanity and divide them to and in the hebrew when he says and what he creates when he pierces through and takes out this rib he makes an help meet for him that's what he makes not a help mate not a mate but a help meet for him and in the hebrew it means one to be at hand the the easier connect go it's one to be at hand one to be near one to always be ready to help and to comfort this is when he says i'm gonna make him a help meet it's one who stands by his side who's there to help him and and this word help me it's very important to recognize uh the image that god is wanting to portray in this because this is the woman this is her identity this is their office this is their place this is their function it's one before him the word means one before him so you want to get the best picture of what it means this is one before him we all most of us like probably look around and tell who did and who didn't but most of us stood in front of amir this morning and that's exactly what it means one before him it's as if in a mirror correspondent to him one who has a counterpart suitable to a nature and to need one in this help me that's one like himself in shape and constitution and disposition the word actually means a second self it wouldn't necessarily be strictly translated that way but when you look at the word one to be at hand and ready to help and to comfort god was taking adam and dividing him into two and so it was a second self to him now we could read that the woman is to be a compliment to him she's always to be ready to help and to comfort and to be correspondent to him and to be one like him one suitable to his nature and his need and we could see that once he took the woman out that's what she is to him but it works in the reverse right some of you brave brothers please help me out today and your sisters you can just be quiet and meek as much as you want just pray dear god help him get it it works in the opposite because it's a mirror if you're looking in a mirror and you say well you're you're my mirror image and you're suitable to me and you're compatible with me and you're complementary to my needs and you're there to support me and you're there to help me it works in the opposite because this is reciprocal the image of this image of this woman that is brought out of the man we say well she was made to help man but she's a compliment to man so it meant that if she was meeting the need of man then man was needy there was something that there was something that she was going to do to complement the man god would not have brought her forth if adam could have done everything else on his own and there's certainly things that adam could have done on his own he named all the animals without the help of his wife he was there to name the animals and give them all their names and give them their descriptions and give them their titles but yet there's something that the man needed help in doing there's something to fulfill his purpose and so he created uh created the woman or brought the woman out of the man as a compliment to him but he is a compliment to her the world truly has the image of manhood has been equally perverted to create the wrong image of a man and in doing so it it perverts the image of a woman and so to be a help me it's a counterpart formed from him this is remarkable this is a companion formed from the man it was a perfect resemblance of his person again i keep using the terminology compliment she was complimentary to him help me as it signifies one like or as himself standing opposite to or before him the word is used in other places where one sat across my other face to face as a mirror that's what she was and so god pierces adam to break off the specific designation of female and it's god that makes the difference it's god in the beginning it says god created humankind and he didn't just leave it at that he he said that there was male and female the woman was to be the perfect resemblance of the man possessing not inferiority nor superiority but in all things was like and equal to the man and that's originally how god made it and so it's god that separates male and female we can use the terminology it's god that brings that division i think we covered this um it may have been really at the very very beginning so it may have been in 2020 and how that when god divided male and female even our word for sex when we say male or female you have to declare on an application what your sex is that word comes from division it's a separating it's god that did the dividing it's god that sex sector the word comes from male and female as far as being sexes and the state of being male or female it comes from in two it means two parts it's exactly exactly the language we use when we say what sex are you male or female it's a division of the human race and so continuing on in verse 22 as it says that god took that rib and then when it says he took one of the ribs and closed up the flesh that tells us he opened up the flesh he pierced he bore through and the rib which the lord god had taken from man made he a woman and brought her under the man if you recall how rib is even the word that's used for side chamber even in the temple the cells and chambers inside the temple beautiful image of how man there was a there was a there was a chamber there were cells there was a part of the man that god designated to be removed from the man that would become part of the woman i'm trying to remember if it happened in my own family or or what the story is of a young boy one time waking up and feeling his ribs true story from what i remember and feeling around and saying mom i think my rib is missing uh having heard the story of adam and uh fortunately it doesn't quite work that way because some of us are probably so pain intolerant we'd never get married but this this is what god does is he takes this rib it's this side chamber and it says from man he takes this rib and from man made he a woman the word there man is adam from adam made he a woman isha which means this is what woman is so when he introduces when she comes out of man it's not just adam dose or adam 2.0 there's a language that's given that's different now it's isha and he introduces the bible says and he brought her unto the man he introduces the woman to the man adam and this is what i was really enjoying last week as i was pondering these things is at this very moment this may be where the inspiration struck me this very moment when god brings the woman to the man this manifestation unlocks a revelation when he sees it something brother branham even says that that's put a strike he says that struck in humanity and and it it so struck humanity it put a shock in adam that still resides in mankind today from this moment right here genesis 2 22 when adam saw the woman it put a shock in him triggered something in his dna that is still resides in mankind today from that moment on because it unlocks something in the man he'd never seen and the in the prior verses male female male female male female he had seen a lot of beauty a lot of wonderful creation he'd even seen all the way up to the serpent he would have seen the manifestation and god's creation of great beauty and incredu in all sorts of details and peculiarities that would be very very beautiful to see you know oh my this is wonderful this is amazing this is fantastic but something when he sees her unlocks a revelation in him and he begins to utter in verse 23 and adam said this is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man flesh of his flesh because she was from his physical body the word that's used the basar means to publish or show forth the woman was was published from the man she was brought forth from the man bones of my bones that i comes a little bit deeper flesh of my flesh the physical part bone of my bones it's essence of my essence substance of my substance self of myself this is very deep it's not just the components it's not just the same uh the same material but now it's bone of my bones and there's an essence in this woman there's a substance in this woman itself of myself because she was taken out of the man and so it's after the woman comes from the man when it says taken out of the man it's not adam but it refers to him as ish which is the same word for husband that's used in genesis chapter 3. so now adam has a transformation when the woman is formed the office changes when they're together in in one entity here's adam he's male and female or they're represented in this singular form the spirit of male and female is in in the flesh of adam but now once the woman is appointed once she's designated the office changes and they step into a new relationship had the woman never been expressed it would have been adam adam adam but now that the woman is present and she's isha he's the ish to the isha he's now steps into a new relationship and so now all of humanity and mankind has a different designation and it's a designation that's essential that's essential to understanding god in heaven and so is whether you would view this as a continuation of adam's declaration or god's uh inspiration according to what adam just said she is born of my bones flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man it says in verse 24 therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh therefore shall a man which is the the ish leave his father and his mother and cleave unto his wife the isha and they shall be one flesh now you have the office of male and female it's no longer just male and female it's just not human kind or adam but now it's man and wife these are the offices of male and female and this is part of again like as i said you whether you view this as part of adam speaking or god god's pronouncement according to adam's revelation this is a prophetic utterance that's demonstrated either by adam or by god himself upon the moment that the woman is declared upon meeting the woman out of this is bone of my bone flesh of my flesh and the bible says for this and a man shall leave it says amen a man leave his father and his mother shall cleave under his wife it connects it is some causation or some reason in mark chapter 10 verses 6 to 7 it says but from the beginning of the creation god made them male and female this is jesus's rebuke to the men who were trying to kind of pound the bible that moses said we could have a divorce moses said we could do it he says but from the beginning of creation god made them male and female for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife what does that mean for this reason for this cause because of the woman now you can say yeah because of the woman but she's part of this this bringing together of man and woman for this cause because of the woman a man will leave and what does he do he introduces new relationships new offices in genesis chapter 1 male and female genesis chapter 2 man and wife but now it's not just man man and wife it's father and mother all just before this chapter can close god is introducing everything and this is some of the things that we went through in the beginning god created a family it's all portrayed in those first two chapters what god was leading up to what god was foreshadowing what god was wanting to build to you have male and female husband and wife but now a father and mother and you look in the bible you see that animals could be either sex and they could be male and female and because of that they could procreate and bring forth but they never carry the designation or office of husband and wife and they never carry the designation of father and mother so you have the male who becomes a man a female who becomes the woman and it's greater it's a greater expression just male it's greater expression than just female but now it's not just man woman but it's father the head or founder of a household it comes from the word ab the producer the generator and the mother m which is the point of departure think of that point of departure or division why is it why why is she called m father ab the producer the generator but she's called the point of division or or departure because through her forms another branch the man is a generator but the woman forms the point of departure that when that child comes forth there is another branch there's a division now and so the female the male we see the male we can focus on god created the man adam but it's in the mirror image that female to womanhood to motherhood and that's the beautiful mystery of god's creation this is how god has outlined it this is how god has laid it out in the scripture that there's something in the female to be a to be a woman and there's something in the woman to be a mother something to be unlocked in the manifestation of these things and so it closes with this verse 25 and they were both naked the man and his wife and were not ashamed naked it's it there's a it means bear as even asked by one of the young sunday school kids here recently they were very sincere about it they said adam and eve in the beginning didn't have clothes right and i said that's correct and he said when we go to heaven is that going to be the case and i was able to show them some scripture where we'd be dressed and they went but it says that they were bare that has a spiritual application not just a physical application because then it says the man and his wife the husband and wife and were not ashamed they weren't disconcerted they weren't anxious they weren't disappointed they had no lacking or more particularly there was no anxiety because of lack i know we can't relate it's impossible to relate to what they must have felt and how they must have experienced life but here they are in the beginning naked he says and they're not ashamed they didn't look around they weren't disappointed they weren't dissatisfied they weren't displeased they weren't made to feel oh i wish it wasn't this way i wish it was that way there was just this contentedness in their calling commit contentedness in their condition and it says and they were both naked the man and his wife and were not ashamed this is the man and the woman in their essence in their place and their position what they were essentially man and woman husband wife husband the male the wife the woman and there was no shame or fear in this arrangement but what did satan attack it's the first thing he attacked he went after the woman the point of departure the division and listen to some of the statements that brother adam uses i'm just going to read through these quickly i didn't provide them on the slide i kind of maybe with this foundation i'm just transitioning a little bit i appreciate your real diligence and faithfulness to listen uh listen this morning i'm using two mics so i hope that's helpful he's brother branham says a woman a precious jewel that god has made her to be a mother and entrusted her with motherhood it's not even thought of that way anymore it's more of like an unintended consequence it's a more a flaw than a feature oh great i got to worry about getting pregnant or i don't want to become a mother this is going to hinder something and so i want you to begin to think now how there's certain ways that motherhood is put in categories that devalues motherhood and and really it's not i'm not going to adjust the value of motherhood by tearing anything else down i just want to restore back the value of motherhood and so he's saying think of this is a precious jewel the woman is a precious jew and he's made her to be a mother he's entrusted her with motherhood he says as a woman she has a sacred responsibility to her motherhood so motherhood is a sacred responsibility he said that's committed or this is another statement that's committed to our sacred virtue sacred womanhood and then sacred motherhood these are the the uh womanhood could be just the state of being fully grown as a woman but then motherhood is the state or fact of being a mother and this is a sacred he calls it a sacred responsibility a sacred virtue and then he makes statements such as this and i believe it's very important for us to kind of catch the reality of this and the backbone of any nation is womanhood when it comes to morals and you break motherhood you've broke your nation i know maybe his men were like well if something's broke we can fix it right so all right fine women broke it we'll fix it no sorry ain't gonna happen i think it's kind of that obvious this argument that off you know you often hear from each side but the women say well if it wasn't if it wasn't for a woman there would be no children and if it wasn't for a man there would be no children you can't get into that argument and so but there's a reality here that the woman if you break womanhood you break the nation and this should be a shame it should be a shame to break motherhood it should be it should be a horrible thing to break motherhood or to devalue it but it isn't shamed it's glorified he says in another place motherhood has been broken mothers don't stay at home no more with their children like they used to they got to have a job again i want you to recognize that it's not just merely women working but it's what it was taking women away from it was a choice being set before and them choosing on their own and of their own free will and their own liberties to choose i do not want to be a mother i do not want to have children i want to pursue this and he says they don't want to stay home and it and they don't but he says the problem is they don't stay home with their children like they used to i don't believe you can uh you're gonna you could take the message and create some sort of absolute that if a woman works she's antichrist there's it's it's the calling of a woman that was being forsaken when she enters the workforce or wants to pursue something at the sake of not fulfilling some marital duty or stepping into her calling as a mother so it's not just women working but it was the value of motherhood being degraded the value of staying at home oh you just want to stay at home and you you don't want to get a job and you don't want to pursue this or pursue that that was motherhood was being shamed she says in another place women has got a great place it's sacred nice wonderful place but she must keep herself that way to hold her office as she should as a mother as a woman and of motherhood when the womanhood is broke the backbone of any nation is broke that's the strength that god brother branham is giving mothers within the family if it's i say if it's the backbone of the nation it's the backbone of a family it's the backbone of the nation it's the backbone of our own families and even our composition here as a church is true motherhood and he says it's sacred it's a wonderful place she must keep herself that way hold her office as a mother as a woman so motherhood is an office that needs to be held and woman who has an office that needs to be held says if you break that you're going to break the backbone the strength of the nation if the woman's the backbone maybe the man's the muscle but they have to work together in order to accomplish things and so the glory and the strength of a woman i i mean i really feel uh you know i i hope i've done some justice and looking at the scripture i almost feel that maybe i should go back through it um and and look at the scriptures again to try to express to you just how much god was portraying when he created the woman from a standpoint of beauty from the standpoint of ability and grace because the glory and the strength of a woman in her office in her calling is unsurpassed and many forces have pulled the woman out of her office to pursue certain works or images or certain accomplishments and it's forces that do it so we could we could maybe blame a wicked woman and an evil woman but there's forces that work against her driving her to pursue things because she feels this is what is expected from her or she feels this is what she must do and she'll do it even against her own nature actually have to do things to fight against her own makeup her own chromosomes and hormones to work against the way that she's formed the way that she's made to cause so that she can pursue things that she thinks of the right things she ought to pursue and and i if i if this is just me you don't have to a man maybe this i'm giving you warning you can just sit on your hands and clench your lips a little bit if you don't want to instinctively say man when you don't mean it but i believe there's been an endless shaming of the virtue of the woman in motherhood the true virtue of a woman and how god made her even if it's in her biology even if it's in her instincts and her and her nature that the womanhood how god intended it what motherhood how god intended it there's just a constant shaming of it and it doesn't have to be overt and they say oh these silly women having babies or these silly women being dainty or these women doing this they don't have to say it overtly all they have to do is uh give this these honors of bravery and these accolades of bravery and courage to those who abandoned their identity for a new one that's all you have to do in order to devalue the essence the truth when the essence of something is that is what it is and you could go to all the caitlyn's you want and you say well that you may want to identify as something else but in your essence you're something else in your essence you are who you are and so it's not that it has to be overt women bad women no good and women need to change women this and women that no all you have to do is begin to promote and laud and honor and recognize the bravery and courage of somebody who forsakes their gender for another one and it creates unspoken a stigma and a devaluing of one's original calling i i think i've mentioned it here before but i thought this the headline couldn't have been truer but it said it may have been an op-ed piece but it said women are now uh third-class citizens and it was all based upon the argument that uh that they believe there's inequality in the workforce and there's inequality in pay and there's all sorts of inequalities and and it really stands to reason when you drill down it i find myself i'm going to get caught up in the numbers all of a sudden and i'll try to back out of it very quickly but it's like okay if there is one let's get into it and figure out why and you'll find oh because there's actual differences between a male and female and but if on the basis of these inequalities and they recognize this disparity between the man and the woman and and funding and competition but then you swing so far the other way to where you're going to let a man choose to be a woman so now he is allowed to compete in women's sports and what happens he's better than all the women and so now the feminists are kind of going wait a minute hold on we're now third class citizens and i want to say no no no fourth class wait until the women get on catch on and want to become men and so a woman at her essence is going to become a fourth-class citizen and i may be short-sighted i'm pretty sure there's a 22nd class already that they're working on but that this is what happens when you get away from the way that god designed things now this is um this is from a book you don't have to write it down you don't have to buy it on amazon prime same day delivery i haven't read the book just read parts of it i believe it was a professor from uh you know a university of north carolina james twitchell and his book was for shame was it called the name of the book for shame the loss of common decency in american culture he says we're living in shameless times i find it a paradox the way that he's using us because there's there's a lack of shame but then there's a reciprocal uh shame that's being placed he says we're living in shameless times when i was growing in the 50s public drunkenness filing for bankruptcy having an abortion or a child out of wedlock drug addiction hitting a woman looting stores using vulgar language in public being on the public dole or welfare or getting into divorce was enough to make you hang your head anybody awake enough in the 50s can we get a can we get a witness on that i mean these are the things that people were ashamed of people would hide their bankruptcy they if someone was abused or looting stores vulgar vulgar language in public having an abortion or a child out of wedlock public drunkenness uh drug addictions these are all things that make you hang your head in shame he says most of these reflected concerns about limiting individual behavior within a group i think it's a very astute observation that this is behavior you wanted to limit a particular behavior within a group he says you want to feel ashamed today or feel shamed today you ready you want to have feel shame wear fur coat smoke in public grow fat have a nose too big don't recycle eat meat or corn fed beef he said most of these acts violate codes of consumption i think i want you to kind of catch what he just said so at one time there was shameful behaviors but now the shame is is on things such as you don't recycle pearl clutching you eat meat you know what you're doing to the environment all right there's such a uh there's a shame placed on these things he said but these acts violate codes of consumption think of where the shift has been to consumption she says somehow things have changed he says where did the shame go or better yet how did it get redirected to such often trivial concerns there was a shame at one time of certain things and it's like wow in this that's shameful that's not good that's not you know you shouldn't do that that's that's abhorrent behavior but now the shame is being stigmatized in other things that just violate consumerism it has more to do with economics it has more to do with um unfounded moral platitudes this is just a this is a professor i don't know that he claims to be a christian um i don't know if he's been canceled maybe i should have looked into this a little bit more before i quoted from him but he's identifying something has changed we don't value the same things we used to value and we shame things now that seem to be so innocuous and why would that even matter and the things that we let people do now when it comes to publicly cussing and getting drunk and all the reality things that we promote those things aren't shamed they're glorified these things they they if i could say this this is where maybe it's easy maybe to go down a rabbit trail but just think of how much they sensationalize sin in order to sell advertising where they have tv shows uh i don't know what they're called but they're teenage mothers and the reality shows that father that follow uh mothers teenage mothers are having babies at 15 they turn into a reality show and they become superstars so what do they do they commercialize something that would be a very sad difficult situation and something that requires some attention and and you'd want to have some sensitivity to it but they glorify to the voice oh don't worry about it we'll make you millions off of this i think how i've seen the headline recently is one of these stars committed suicide wow they're just being they're being used because it's it's consumption has become the goal consumerism has become the goal in proverbs chapter 31 i think we're moving along just nicely now in proverbs chapter 31 i wanted to focus in genesis chapter 2. now we're going to look at proverbs 31. i trust that you are awake this morning staying with me laboring with everything that is in you to stick this one out and if you just are having a hard time do it for mom do it for mom it says in proverbs 31 verse 10 who can find a virtuous woman it suggests perhaps it's not easy to find if i could say right now who could find a red chair wouldn't be hard who could find red carpet wouldn't be hard as a matter of fact i wish we could just kind of forget about it but uh you say who can find a virtuous woman the question itself is not rhetorical in the sense of oh throw a rock you're going to hit one it's no this is rare this is precious it says for her price is far above rubies hey who can find a virtuous woman virtuous means strength or might or ability efficiency when used of a woman it refers to her strength of character not physical strength but her ability her efficiency her might when it comes to her courage and her her spiritual zeal ever heard the phrase tiger mama right it's a real thing ah there's a there's a there's a there's a gear that women have it's something that god has put in her it's part of her essence that when she's sick she can accomplish things that a man cannot when he's equally as sick right and if we want to get into the debate i said that's fine you go chop wood right like no no no that's my that's my job i'll chop the wood and i can go chop wood and when i get a sore throat i'm in bed all day right it's because i could chop wood but a woman though she has this strength she has some deep resolve who can find a virtuous woman it's a way of describing her rarity she's a very rare because her price is far above rubies if we took the time to read it we could go through these several verses here the price of a virtuous woman and how she cares for her family she helps the needy she speaks wisdom but it describes her as precious trustworthy desiring to please her husband that she's a benefit and a compliment to him and her family she's willing to work for her household and for its debt it's it's it's benefit she's prudent strong hard working i'm just summarizing these verses here she plans diligently plans for the future she's diligent generous she's a faithful teacher of her children she teaches kindness to others she's frugal and financially disciplined and the bible says she's god-fearing you take these characterizations of this woman she's industrious she's smart she's ambitious she's prudent she's strong she she has some wisdom concerning the future she has wisdom in how to treat others this is the woman is a remarkable remarkable calling and this is how the bible describes a virtuous woman and i would say that modern society or maybe we could use the terminology laodicean spirit pressures a woman to alter her expectations or to alter her roles but this is true of a virtuous woman precious trustworthy a benefit a compliment strong industrious hard-working diligent forward-looking generous a faithful teacher kind disciplined financially and one that fears the lord but the time and age that we're living in i'm going to read this statement from the laodicean church age chapter 9 of the church age book he's referring to laodicea says the city was rich endowed by the wealthy it was full of culture science abounded how like today the churches are rich the worship is beautiful and formal but cold and dead now ponder this full of culture science abounded like today now notice what he says culture and education have taken the place of the spirit given word and faith has been superseded by science so that man is a victim of materialism i want you just to hold that think of that culture and education taking the place of the spirit given word so the word is displaced by culture and education and faith is displaced by science culture education and science now have the preeminence in the age he says so that man is a victim of materialism culture education and science causes mankind to be victims of materialism he says in every attribute laodicea is found reborn in the 20th century laodicean age and even in this 21st century now he says that culture i want you to just kind of hold this in your minds i know this might seem to be um a little bit dry to you and i apologize culture education and science have replaced replaced faith in the word and the product is a victim of materialism materialism is to consider material possessions or physical comforts more important than spiritual values materialism relates to being preoccupied with those comforts material comforts disinterested in spiritual things materialism is tangible it's what satiates the flesh it's what satisfies uh your immediate needs and you're more concerned about material possessions you're more concerned about consumption than you are about the value of your spirit or what you're doing to your mind or spiritual things that's what materialism means it's what's tangible it's what's evidence what's seen it's those codes of consumption that uh professor twitchell was talking about but he says that they're they're a victim of materialism think about victim and it's etymology and you only have to think about it you can listen to it because i'm going to tell you about it when he says it's a victim of materialism i want you to think more broadly than oh materialism came by and kicked me in the knee but its culture education and science have caused the person to be a victim of materials materialism is doing something but it's not that you're the innocent bystander a victim is a living creature killed and offered as a sacrifice to a false deity or a consecrated animal that's why his first you or originally used this word in the 15th century in the 16th century it was a person who's hurt tortured or killed by another the 17th century it began to use as a person oppressed by some power situation or a person taken advantage of we live in a time when everybody's the victim everybody is woe is me i've been aggrieved i've been offended and i'm telling you we got to be very very careful or that spirit that's just on the age where everybody's a victim and everyone has a victim mentality mentality we may be persecuted we may be laughed at we may be made fun of the fun of our doors may be shut our charter could be canceled non-profit status can be taken away but i want you to understand we are never going to be the victim you're always going to be the victor because in all these things you're made more than a conqueror christians never have a scriptural right to be victims to make myself out to be a victim i'm the victim i'm the victim i'm the victim i'm the victim no you have one who is your victor and he's one that can redeem you he's one that can give context to these things you may be somebody else's victim but you are christ's victory therefore we do not need to have a victim mentality yeah i've been victimized by this i've been victimized by that i've been made fun of i've been laughed at i've been abused i've been mistreated i've been all these things have happened and that makes you a victim in that context but we are taught that we are his victory therefore we don't have this victim mentality but the spirit on the age has made people to be something that is sacrificed for something else and oppressed by materialism taking advantage of by materialism and the more i thought about the phrase victim of materialism through culture education and science culture education and science has have made the people victims the very things that claim to liberate women have are exploiting them the very things that claim to liberate them are victimizing them why because at the end of the day it's about consumption it's about economics it's about materialism you still with me it's 11 35. do you know where your mom is i read an article in the smithsonian a few years ago it was just a small little excerpt and the title was did women stop being charming three decades ago this is the question that was asked and it's kind of an odd question you know what do you mean why didn't how did women stop being charming three decades ago and as you ponder that just look at the title there's this this is me i summarized the summary but researchers analyzed over 79 000 american texts they included novels nonfiction writings periodicals magazines newspapers and they examined the words in these american texts 79 000 and they studied more than 500 different words related to personality identified those words tied most closely to women they also did it with men but i'm just summarizing about the women and then traced how these words relating to a woman's personality how they changed or how the the usage changed or the descriptions changed as attitudes towards the gender evolved and changed so you're looking at over 79 000 uh writings from 1910 in that decade and they they analyzed them and they they found words descriptive of women's personalities they began to rake which words were used the most and then looked at it over this um in this case it was over a hundred year period to say well look at how the what they're wanting to see is how have descriptions of women and men changed as our attitudes towards gender have changed and in 1910 these were the top five words associated with a woman charming placid delicate passionate sweet these are things that would have been found in novels non-fiction books periodicals newspapers magazines uh historical books a woman was top five charming placid delicate passionate sweet these all these words except for maybe placid might find their way into a mother's day card today and these are all posi these are good so i've kept them kind of in their pristine white charming placid delicate passionate suite fast forward 80 years to 1990 and number one was maternal but then the next three morbid artificial physical and thank god for the bookend of caring or that could have ended really really dark of course there's five other ones and the other ones too were a little um weren't always maybe as wonderful as maternal and caring but notice how different but vince could you go back to 1910 not literally there you go charming placid delicate passionate sweet and you go before 80 years maternal which was in kind of the list before and go to the next slide maternal morbid artificial physical these are the words that enter in to the descriptions of women in 1980 number three was masculine wait hold on what in the top five descriptions of a woman masculine was number three this is what was stood out in the 80s now i want you to consider the i want to compare for a moment some of the standout ones from 1910 and that of 1990 charming means pleasant polite friendly you might think placid seems a little interesting but it means even tempered a woman was not easily upset or excited she was charming and placid and delicate passionate sweet these are very um uh these are these denote a particular nature that you could associate with the woman with the mom but then you get to 1990 and you say maternal that's good but morbid artificial morbid means diseased looking like death or subject to death if something is morbid they're subject to death death is clinging to them if they're artificial they're not natural they're not genuine women have now are no longer just maternal or caring or charming or sweet but now there is a morbidity to them there's an artificialness to them there's a physicality to them there's a masculinity to them and this is the language that's being used of the woman in the periodicals in the novels in the in the magazines in the in the books and it's used to indicate how the attitude towards women had changed through time and it stood out to me how that women are being described as morbid and artificial in ecclesiastes chapter 7 verse 26 he says i find more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and nets and her hands as bands more bitter than death is a woman the woman whose heart is a snare and a net her hands as bands who so pleaseth god shall escape from her but the sinner shall be taken by her captured seized trapped drawn to her there's an image of a woman that may be charming and delicate and passionate sweet maternal and caring but there's also this other image of a woman that is masculine and morbid and artificial and physical and he says it's going those that please god will escape that image but the sinner is taken by it drawn into it more bitter than death is the woman the scripture has already described that the woman is ultimately going to come to this place where she's morbid she's she's subject to death she's not natural she's not genuine and just to bring it up into the more uh the time that we're living in now in 2018 this is a top 10 calm ruined careless gracious sentimental mistaken humorous fearful proud passionate and look at how many of those how this description of a woman ruined is number two careless mistaken fearful proud this is how women are being portrayed because the attitude towards women has changed and it's through time forces have changed the woman's disposition and driven her from her office there's a certain attitude that is suitable for a wife and a mother certain attitude suitable for certain callings and even labors that would be um you know outside the home there's a certain nature and that would be beneficial to these different callings but time through time as attitudes have changed towards gender there's been forces that have caused her to change her disposition a woman who is charming and and not easily excited and delicate and passionate and sweet isn't suited for just any calling in life a woman who's maternal and caring is suited for particular things but maybe there needs to be a certain artificialness or physicalness or certain morbidity maybe a certain rumoredness and and pride to a woman in order for her to step into other roles brother bam says in the church age book chapter six he says now a woman is not meant to have an iron disposition you see a woman with one she's not meant to have it she is according to the holy scripture to be submissive to the male that is commanded of her woman who is truly female all female will be of that disposition do you think it was for a reason some of these phrases are used and iron-clad and really we couldn't argue i don't know if we have the same things that the mormons could do or we can just black out and white out our church history but these things are out there for anyone to hear and go listen to a woman who's truly female all-female will be of that disposition not a doormat no real male makes a female a doormat i'm glad he said it that way because sometimes it seems that males want to treat a woman like a woman because she's not a lady but he says a male never makes a female a doormat but she will want to be under authority and not rule over the mail for he is the head of the house if she breaks that image that god made for her she is perverted i miss his heavy stuff i recognize that in the day and age that we're living in uh there's uh there's a stigma that can be placed on this there's a scarlet letter that you could carry if you say well the woman's place is in the home and and she should be submissive to the male i know that's got a lot of shock value it seems in the world today but nonetheless it's what the bible says it's what the bible teaches and brother branham's identifying how a woman's disposition has changed we see it just in the from the 1910s to the 1990s to 2018 there are certain qualities and characteristics of the woman that just get lost and other ones start to come up why her disposition is changing it's the inherent qualities of mind and character disposition is a frame of mind an attitude a disposition is an inclination are you inclined to do something at one time a woman was charming and placid and delicate but now she's morbid and artificial and physical her disposition is changing he says the image that god made for her it's a god-ordained disposition for a woman to step into it's part of it's part of your dna that your hormones ought to be promoting and the world is working really really hard through sculpture science and education to do what force you to not walk into the image that god has of a woman and conform to culture science and education and they'll even use science to the utmost to change you all we gotta fix for that what they do they just give you shots to change your hormones force your body to change the disposition of a woman is changing proverbs chapter 11 verse 22 i don't know maybe maybe some of you thinking this is a happy mother's day thing oh my goodness well happy mother's day anyways this is really going to help proverbs 11 22. a jewel of gold and a swine snout so is a fair woman which which is without discretion this is a this is a a fascinating statement just to ponder maybe get the picture right you just think about a pig with a a gold ring in its nose it says that is the same as a woman without discretion discretion is taste or judgment and so it speaks of thought process and and thus in through thought process it speaks of choices and behaviors so a woman who's not thinking correctly and not behaving correctly is just like he says a fair woman a beautiful woman a fair woman who would not have discretion is like putting a gold a jewel in a pig's nose a woman without taste that the the way the scripture is expressing a woman without discretion is a woman without taste she's void of tact she's void of grace his brother branham says a woman of an iron disposition a woman without discretion is harsh she's hard she's bitter she's aggressive a woman without discretion is anti-woman because a woman is made to have discretion a woman is natured to have discretion a woman without a fair woman without discretion he says it's like a woman without grace intact is like a gold ring in a pig's nose unless we forget uh what is meant there we all love bacon but to the jews this would have been an unclean animal this would not be well you know a ring on a pack of bacon would just be the ultimate proposal but that's not the case here a pig adorned with gold is the same as a woman adorning herself in the wrong image it's incongruent you don't put jewel jewels in a pig's nose that's not that's not what it's made for so a woman without discretion without judgment a woman whose disposition has changed where she's harsh she's bitter she's aggressive that's the wrong image brother bam said if that changes then she's perverted she's become iron she's become hard and it should be just as increment for incongruent for a woman to be that as it would be to see jewelry on a pig and so proverbs says in proverbs 31 i want to read verse 25 but i want to just kind of capture the trajectory of it in verse 20. i might have the wrong wrong verse here but it's she that fears the lord in verse 30 it says she feareth the lord not verse 20 a woman that feareth the lord this is strength and honor her clothing in verse 25. and she shall rejoice in time to come a woman that fears the lord a virtuous woman i love the bookkins a woman that fears the lord a virtuous woman he says give her the fruit of her hands and let her own works praise her in the gate she's worthy of this honor she's worthy of recognition give her the fruit of her hands let her own works praise her in the gates we stand here in the gates today to give her of the works of her hands to praise her in the gates she's clothed in strength and honor she's clothed with moral character strong in honorable speaks of strength of mind and charity and resolve what does culture and science rob the woman of her true strength or true power through culture education and science and the world devalues virtue strength and honor are her clothing just read proverbs 31 just try it with somebody said well i'm a proverbs 31 woman and they're and they'll immediately start to think of what that means and what it represents and it's antiquated and it's the it's the results of a patriarchy and it's the results of misogynism it's results of chauvinism and there's a way that they want to characterize it to demean and devalue how you feel in your heart what you feel you want to be that's why again i love the special that was sung i choose to be there's so much pressure now to where if if a young girl said i want to get married i want to have children i want to serve my husband i want to be a good mother they would think oh where did you get that idea why would you want to do that don't you realize there's so many more opportunities and women are the future baby come on you need to get on board and they would make someone feel guilty for choosing that and and and then they express this disgust and this disdain and and they they're shocked and horrified you would think that she said she wanted to be a man with the way that they act and the way they respond why because the world has devalued virtue and womanhood and therefore motherhood you know why they devalue it it's it's because those things empower a godly woman it says she shall rejoice in time to come she smiles at the coming day she's not fearful she doesn't fear the future she looks forward to the future she looks forward to the future without anxious care she looks forward to the future confident wow that's the power of her office a virtuous woman womanhood motherhood there's power in her office there's power in her life which are it's the life of a woman there's power in her works she shall let the let give her the fruit of her hands let her own works praise her in the gates there's power in her works of motherhood and we went as we looked at in the beginning god ordained god has ordained the office of a mother he's ordained the form he go back to the beginning god was intentional god was purposeful he ordained the form and the purpose of a woman it's his design it's his divine will and there's a lot of things that could be said about a woman's weakness because things said that's about what what aren't her strengths strength may not be spirit physical but her spiritual strength is tremendous her moral strength is tremendous a real woman is a wonder but satan remembers her designer now and he's designed her to be degraded designed her to be devalued in order to rob the woman of her true power and i believe that so many images of women or men that want to be women are lifted up today in order to portray a godly woman is weak powerless undesirable but a real woman a real woman in her place lacks a strength and ability which no a female can match a real woman in her place has a strength and ability that no female can match so i as i close this i have some statements i want to read to you and maybe we'll just read them as we close but i say don't let the devil change your perceived value don't let it cost fear hopelessness despairing of the future i imagine it could be quite scary maybe for some of our young people to consider the future of marriage the future of relationships the future of work but don't let any of that scare you i say it's time to return to the office to embrace embrace womanhood rejoice in and celebrate motherhood musicians if he could come the sermon in the flashing red light brother bram said there's nothing that god could give a man outside of salvation better than a nice wife there's no man can console no person can console a person when they're tired they won't confide in anyone like they do their own wife what a fortunate thing you brothers are when you've got a nice little wife that's clean and upright and moral you can come home to when you're tired and weary and sit down and she can talk to you she can do more with you than anybody else that's right she's a jewel she is a queen i'm sure the children feel the same way about their mother it's in the creation story that the first thing that god ever gave man was a woman she's a jewel she's a queen and the sermon patriarch abraham not to trigger anybody by using the word patriarch and all the witches said no is just something i'd seen in witches versus the patriarchy i guess it's a movement now but by the he says brother ram's respondent says by the way what does a christian girl want to show her underneath skirt for he says i can't understand that he's just talking about what they call scandal skirts or the splits to show the undergarment he says you're born again of god you got the beauty of the holy ghost to show what you are you've got virtue that these scandal skirts don't have that's right a real woman of god that stands out with virtue so you might be laughed at called old-fashioned but you got something that they can't touch and done lost it and can never have it again he said that's right you've got virtue that's something to protect something to uphold i believe that god has blessed us in our midst and our presence today real mothers there's a reality to relationships that i we can acknowledge that mothers may not be perfect but they can be perfect mothers and there's mistakes that are made and there's slip ups and there's failures and maybe it's easier sometimes to just look back on a day like today i'm like well i'll take all i can today because as i look back in my past i don't always see a faithfulness a fidelity i don't always see that i was doing the right things i haven't always had the right approach i've made a lot of mistakes but that quality that god has ordained in you that part of himself that he's put inside of you to manifest his image that's still in womanhood today that's still in motherhood today and if there's a way any way that you could in your heart say lord please forgive me if you failed forgive me if i haven't done things right and embrace the challenge that you have today in whatever calling you're in whatever time of life you're in embrace the challenge today i want to be that godly woman that the scripture speaks of and i would say which i believe i'm speaking to everyone that's here today let's just take a moment i believe i could say as a man as a husband as a father as a brother in christ thank you for your virtue thank you for your stand thank you for your perseverance with so much pressure that exists in the world today within families within culture within science within education very very near to us even in fractured relationships there's an aggressiveness there's an agenda there's an agenda there's an intimidation when a woman is happy in her place by choice so anymore maybe just using the the absolutes of a woman's place is what gets people all offended but you could just have took my i've taken my place i'm happy where i am i've chosen to return to the office i've chosen to return to the office i'm coming i'm happy to step in to womanhood i'm happy to step into motherhood because that's my calling that's my disposition is suited for this and i say god bless you to all of our mothers that are here mothers expecting mothers mothers to be those who desire that office and that calling god bless you today i may his honor be to you may you be receive the fruit of your hands and may your works praise you in your gates god bless you today if we could stand together
