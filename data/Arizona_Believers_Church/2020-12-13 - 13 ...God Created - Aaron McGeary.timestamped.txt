[0:00] Revelations CH 21 veres 1 to7 and I saw
[0:05] a new Heaven and a new Earth for the
[0:07] first Heaven and the first Earth were
[0:09] passed away and there was no more sea
[0:12] and I John saw the holy city New
[0:14] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[0:17] Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for
[0:20] her husband and I heard a great voice
[0:22] out of Heaven saying behold the
[0:25] Tabernacle of God is with men and he
[0:27] will dwell with them and they shall be
[0:30] his people and God himself shall be with
[0:32] them and be their God this is we'll come
[0:35] to it here in a little bit it's a very
[0:38] uh I found it to be a very peculiar not
[0:41] peculiar maybe but very outstanding
[0:42] reading comparing it to what God was
[0:45] accomplishing in the beginning and even
[0:47] God's relationship to humanity and
[0:49] Mankind throughout the years but now
[0:52] something has uh something has climaxed
[0:54] something has culminated and we'll just
[0:58] uh verse four and God shall wipe away
[1:00] all tears from their eyes and there
[1:01] shall be no more death neither sorrow
[1:04] nor crying neither shall there be any
[1:06] more pain for the former things are
[1:08] passed away and he that sat upon the
[1:10] throne said behold I make all things new
[1:15] and he said unto me right for these
[1:17] words are true and faithful and he said
[1:20] unto me it is done I am Alpha and Omega
[1:23] the beginning and the end I will give
[1:25] unto him that is a thirst of the
[1:27] Fountain of the Water of Life freely he
[1:29] that over cometh shall inherit all
[1:31] things and I will be his God and he
[1:33] shall be my son amen you may be seated
[1:37] what thrilling uh scripture reading uh
[1:41] and then me kind of knowing which way I
[1:43] which direction I'm headed and hopefully
[1:44] we get it just is even more thrilling uh
[1:47] to look at
[1:48] that we're continuing on the subject of
[1:51] God created it's an outflow of Genesis
[1:54] 1:1 in the beginning God created and I'm
[1:58] wanting to just going to take time uh
[2:02] this morning really to recapture where
[2:04] we had stopped last time in the uh in
[2:08] the area of subdue how this commandment
[2:10] this commission was given but I just
[2:12] want to background a few things from the
[2:13] last couple services at the outset so
[2:16] that we can have um some context for
[2:18] this and the first few chapters of the
[2:22] Bible we've been looking at maybe the
[2:23] first three The more I've pondered it
[2:25] the more I just want to start saying the
[2:27] first four the first five uh maybe even
[2:30] get all the way up to Genesis CH 12 when
[2:32] we introduce Abram uh those first
[2:34] several chapters just setting up God's
[2:37] plan and story of redemption but these
[2:40] first few chapters of the Bible lay a
[2:42] foundation for understanding really what
[2:44] is the mystery of God uh because God an
[2:47] unknown being an unknown entity uh is
[2:50] making himself known through scripture
[2:53] and so as things unfold we see things
[2:56] that God does and things that God says
[2:58] so there's something that's being
[3:00] declared but yet there's still kind of a
[3:01] mystery uh to what he is doing and what
[3:04] he's trying to accomplish and so when we
[3:06] look at creation brother brandom used
[3:08] this phrase we see what he is in his
[3:10] program The Creator is letting himself
[3:13] be known what he is in his program and
[3:16] we've been specifically over the last
[3:17] couple Services looking at how this is a
[3:20] story of redemption and the story of
[3:22] redemption begins in Genesis but not
[3:25] where we might think it begins we think
[3:27] oh the moment that Eve fell that's when
[3:29] the story of redemption begins but the
[3:31] story of redemption begins with in the
[3:33] beginning God created that's where the
[3:36] story of redemption begins and so we're
[3:38] looking at the story of redemption and
[3:41] how that even within this story of
[3:43] redemption those things can be very
[3:45] plain and they're described in a
[3:46] particular way there's a mystery that's
[3:48] hid within it and so this is uh as you
[3:52] begin to read the Bible we cannot read
[3:53] it just as a history but it's God
[3:55] telling his story so it is his story but
[3:59] not history it is God telling something
[4:01] about himself it's divine love being
[4:03] portrayed Divine love being expressed
[4:05] and we we taking taking time just to
[4:08] point out how everything that God was
[4:09] doing and this is a very I would even it
[4:12] just be admit to you it's even a fresher
[4:14] Revelation to me than it's ever been
[4:17] because you take Genesis and you think
[4:19] this is perfection the Perfection
[4:21] Perfection everything that God's trying
[4:23] to achieve everything God's trying to
[4:26] accomplish it's all perfect it's in its
[4:27] Radiance it's in its Glory and then when
[4:30] man falls Redemption begins but it goes
[4:33] back even before that this is redemption
[4:36] because everything that God created
[4:38] everything that he fashioned everything
[4:39] that was formed by God he did it with
[4:41] redemption in mind so what we see unfold
[4:45] in Genesis is not the accident of sin
[4:48] this is not an accident because brother
[4:50] brandham tells us very plainly in that
[4:52] church age book when Satan did that
[4:54] which was necessary to bring about the
[4:56] purpose of God so God allowed things to
[4:58] be into place to be in a particular
[5:00] position so that Satan would act of his
[5:02] own will and in doing so set certain
[5:05] things in motion so that the story of
[5:07] redemption could be told so it's no
[5:09] accident of sin and we've been
[5:11] emphasizing this that God's purpose
[5:13] could not have been revealed without
[5:15] Redemption if we had all stepped forth
[5:17] fresh from God then there would have
[5:19] been no doubt a perfect existence but
[5:23] the paradoxes we wouldn't have perfectly
[5:24] known God there still would have been
[5:26] something about God that would have been
[5:28] missing or lacking so if there was only
[5:30] one Eden what would God mean to us if
[5:34] there was never any sorrow what what
[5:36] what would be uh what that that think
[5:38] about how God's desire to be a comforter
[5:40] if there's no there's no sorrow then
[5:43] God's desire and need to be a comforter
[5:45] is imprisoned if there's no sickness
[5:47] then God's attribute of being a Healer
[5:50] is imprisoned it's in bondage so there's
[5:52] things that had to happen for God to be
[5:54] able to express himself so if we had
[5:55] only known one Eden then what would God
[5:58] be to us he would be God
[6:00] and we would worship him just as Angels
[6:02] would worship him but he wouldn't be
[6:03] known to the his people as he desired to
[6:06] make himself known now if you look at
[6:08] Genesis CH 1 ver 28 and that that
[6:12] backgrounds we're still going to be
[6:13] backgrounding some things but this is I
[6:15] really want this to become the main Cog
[6:17] that we uh press forward from because
[6:20] we're looking at God created now as we
[6:23] as we look at this uh Genesis 1:28 I
[6:26] want you to realize this is God speaking
[6:29] now to the so the totality of his
[6:32] creation and so this is what God created
[6:35] this is the desire he had for his
[6:36] creation this is how he begins to
[6:38] arrange in these few verses here if we
[6:40] took more than verse 28 we'll find that
[6:42] God's arranging creation to one another
[6:45] and among one another and now God
[6:47] speaking to the man with the woman
[6:50] inside of him and God blessed them the
[6:54] blessing confers power and God blessed
[6:57] them what he says unto them is the
[6:59] blessing it's not like the pope doing a
[7:01] little thing with his hand or you or
[7:03] some kind of something being sprinkled
[7:05] on somebody it says and God blessed them
[7:07] what he's about to say is the blessing
[7:09] it confers power it conveys ability and
[7:12] God said unto them be fruitful and
[7:15] multiply and replenish the Earth and
[7:18] subdue it and have dominion over the
[7:20] fish of the sea and over the fowl of the
[7:22] air and over every living thing that
[7:25] moveth upon the Earth this is God's
[7:28] blessing on what he he has created in
[7:31] the beginning God created the Heaven and
[7:33] the Earth then we come to verse 28 and
[7:35] this is God even before he sums it up in
[7:37] the beginning of Genesis chapter 2 he's
[7:39] saying this is my creation this is the
[7:41] sum of it I'm blessing man who's the
[7:43] Pinnacle of this and now he's going to
[7:45] have a particular Arrangement over
[7:47] everything that I've created now this
[7:51] blessing and this
[7:53] commandment is left unfulfilled and
[7:55] we're we've been mentioning that several
[7:56] times and we're going to continue to
[7:58] emphasize that this morning
[8:00] because the principles of redemption or
[8:02] if I could say the mystery of redemption
[8:04] would not allow Genesis 1 128 to be
[8:06] fulfilled without
[8:07] suffering now we can look back and say
[8:10] that's just exactly how it happened that
[8:12] this could not have been fulfilled and
[8:13] was not fulfilled until first sorrow and
[8:16] death entered into Humanity but I want
[8:18] to emphasize it that it could not have
[8:20] been fulfilled unless first there was
[8:22] some Interruption within this Perfection
[8:25] some Interruption within this harmony
[8:27] that was in the garden because every
[8:29] everything that is meant by Genesis 128
[8:32] it was not something that God wanted man
[8:35] just to easily grasp that for man just
[8:38] to be able to fulfill all these things
[8:40] and do all these things there was
[8:41] something that had to take place to put
[8:43] man in a character to be able to fully
[8:45] fulfill Genesis 128 and so when man fa
[8:48] the power of Genesis 128 the commission
[8:51] or blessing of Genesis 128 is taken away
[8:54] from Mankind and we could say that was
[8:56] even sealed from him and brother B talks
[8:59] about how those great Powers lay dormant
[9:01] and these things that he had this
[9:03] ability to do he can no longer access
[9:05] them whatever means by which he could
[9:07] not access them whatever means by which
[9:09] he no longer was they were no longer
[9:11] available to him to use God seals man
[9:14] off from the blessing the power and the
[9:16] potential of Genesis 1 128 but this is
[9:20] part of God's predestinated plan called
[9:22] Redemption it's not that this is an
[9:24] accident all of a sudden but it's part
[9:25] of God's plan and it was necessary for
[9:28] God's purpose
[9:30] and so brother BR makes this statement
[9:31] in the message Oneness when Adam and Eve
[9:34] listened to the LIE of the devil this is
[9:36] a very heavy statement to me I can still
[9:39] remember the first time I ever heard it
[9:41] says the holy image of God left
[9:45] them so man's made in the image of God
[9:48] he's made in the likeness of God though
[9:51] he retains particular a particular
[9:55] likeness and a particular image of God
[9:57] after the fall there's the whole holy a
[9:59] holy image that leaves man as soon as he
[10:02] listens to the LIE of the devil and hold
[10:05] that deep within your heart that man
[10:07] lost something the moment he believed a
[10:09] lie and it says and their Fellowship was
[10:11] broken with God he describes it this way
[10:13] their Fellowship of Oneness with God was
[10:16] broken the very minute they listened to
[10:19] the LIE of the devil that broke their
[10:22] Fellowship so now think of the totality
[10:24] of this very short statement and if you
[10:27] listen to the message Oneness brother
[10:28] brandham really emphasizes the theme uh
[10:31] quite a bit in there Adam's Oneness and
[10:33] the Oneness of man and that's God's
[10:35] desire is is to have Oneness with his
[10:37] creation not just to have a creation but
[10:40] to experience Oneness and a to Total
[10:42] Union with his creation it says the holy
[10:45] image of God leaves Adam and the woman
[10:48] the very moment they listen to the LIE
[10:50] of the devil so man loses that that
[10:53] godlikeness some God quality some Divine
[10:56] deity that was that he had some of
[10:58] fellowship with that he had communion
[10:59] with that he had access to that leaves
[11:02] man and it says that breaks their
[11:03] Fellowship he calls it the fellowship of
[11:06] Oneness so man is no longer one with God
[11:09] he may still be like God and he may
[11:12] still uh be in an image of God but this
[11:14] holy image leaves him something about
[11:17] the divine power something about the
[11:18] Divine intent and Notions have left man
[11:22] and he's no longer one with God now he
[11:25] can call upon God he can feel his
[11:27] presence and God could even still
[11:29] communicate with man but something is
[11:31] lost in man's relationship with God
[11:34] through the fall so many different
[11:36] statements I'd like to read and I want
[11:38] I'm going to read several of them but
[11:39] brother B says God in harmony with his
[11:42] creature and the creature in harmony
[11:45] with his maker that's the way it was in
[11:46] the beginning God was in harmony with
[11:49] his creature and the creature was in
[11:51] harmony with his maker that's how man
[11:53] was at the start but as soon as he
[11:56] listens to the LIE of the devil it's
[11:58] disharmony right so now there is no
[12:00] longer Perfect Harmony between God and
[12:02] the creature nor can the creature have
[12:04] perfect harmony with his maker this is
[12:07] interrupted and when the harmony is gone
[12:09] the Oneness is gone when the harmony is
[12:11] gone the holy image cannot be expressed
[12:13] there's something that distorts or
[12:15] perverts that likeness or we could even
[12:18] put it in a way that might even be
[12:19] better for us to understand as soon as
[12:21] there was a breach within the character
[12:23] of man he's no longer fit just to grab a
[12:26] hold of the power of God and use it like
[12:29] he would want to that's right and
[12:31] brother Bram is the holy image of God
[12:34] leaves Adam and the woman their
[12:36] Fellowship of Oneness think of that
[12:38] Fellowship of Oneness and the holy image
[12:40] keep those two ideas in mind the holy
[12:42] image of God departs from the creature
[12:44] The Fellowship of Oneness with God is
[12:47] broken and then brother BR says our
[12:49] health our strength our eternal spirit
[12:52] was lost in Adam so here's things that
[12:55] were lost when Adam fell our health our
[12:57] strength and our eternal Spirit was lost
[13:00] in Adam so there's something that's
[13:02] removed from man and man is separated
[13:04] from and it would have been a very eerie
[13:06] very odd feeling and that's when you
[13:08] find in Genesis 3 when man sinned all
[13:10] sudden fear entered enters in for the
[13:12] first time because he only knew
[13:14] Fellowship of Oneness he only knew the
[13:16] holy image of God as long as he had the
[13:18] holy image fear couldn't get in as long
[13:20] as he had this Fellowship of Oneness
[13:22] with God if there was no fear around him
[13:24] at all soon as that leaves the first
[13:26] emotion he experiences is fear so our
[13:29] our health our strength our eternal
[13:31] spirit was lost in Adam yeah now in
[13:34] Genesis 2:7 and I know it may seem to be
[13:38] uh it might seem just to be kind of very
[13:41] applauding course that we're doing today
[13:44] uh but I I believe that it's going to be
[13:45] a blessing to you as we are able to go
[13:48] hopefully deep into this in Genesis
[13:51] chapter 2:7 it says and the Lord God
[13:54] formed man of the Dust of the ground and
[13:57] breathed into his nostrils the breath of
[13:59] life and Man became a living Soul when
[14:02] Man became a living Soul he now gives
[14:04] him Affinity to the animals all living
[14:07] creatures upon the Earth because it's
[14:08] the same phrase used for living creature
[14:10] of those that creep creep upon the Earth
[14:12] the fowl the fish those things man now
[14:14] has an affinity by having the Breath of
[14:17] Life man becomes a living Soul he
[14:19] becomes a Kinsman now even to Creation
[14:23] but then it also says that God formed
[14:25] him from the dust of the ground so now
[14:27] he's given a physical body now to put
[14:31] this in context of Genesis chapter 1 the
[14:34] blessing Genesis 1 128 had two parts
[14:37] there is a commission related to him as
[14:39] a man or mankind as this as as Adam and
[14:43] the woman that would come from him they
[14:44] are told and commanded to be fruitful
[14:47] and multiply so they're to become many
[14:49] they're to have progeny they're to have
[14:50] those after them so this commission
[14:52] related specifically to them as a as an
[14:56] entity as a being as even as a spirit
[14:58] but the second part of the blessing or
[15:00] this commandment was a commission
[15:02] related to their power over all things
[15:05] in the earth and also all things from
[15:07] the earth as they are told to have
[15:10] dominion over the fish of the sea over
[15:11] the foul of the air and over every
[15:13] living thing that moveth upon the Earth
[15:15] this is a commission related to their
[15:17] power over all living things everything
[15:20] that had life anything that was growing
[15:22] anything that was breathing walking
[15:24] moving anything God had created really
[15:26] we could just say anything God created
[15:28] they're power and dominion over it but
[15:30] then they're also given a commandment to
[15:33] replenish and subdue the Earth so now
[15:37] they're given a power over all things
[15:39] from the earth and when it says man is
[15:41] formed from the dust of the ground this
[15:43] flesh body that God gives man it
[15:46] connects Adam to the power to replenish
[15:50] and subdue the Earth because where did
[15:52] the body come
[15:53] from thank you we'll just turn this over
[15:57] and we'll preach to Brother John the
[15:59] body came from the earth so man is
[16:02] formed from the dust of the ground he's
[16:04] formed from the earth and now this flesh
[16:06] body that Adam is placed within connects
[16:09] him to the power to replenish the Earth
[16:12] and subdue the Earth so now the body
[16:15] becomes a part of the blessing the
[16:17] blessing is be fruitful multiply well
[16:19] there's a it's conceivable that he could
[16:22] have multiplied spiritually it could
[16:24] have been other Spiritual Beings just
[16:25] like Adam in the image of God in the
[16:27] likeness of God supernatural beings
[16:29] without flesh but when God forms man
[16:32] from the dust of the ground he's
[16:34] connecting everything together man
[16:36] becomes Kinsman to the Earth man has a
[16:39] body like um like these other animal
[16:41] bodies and brother man talks about he
[16:43] has a hand like a bear and you describe
[16:44] them in all these different ways where
[16:46] man has some Affinity to Creation but
[16:49] now also man has a direct connection to
[16:52] the Earth it's not just a supernatural
[16:54] being spiritual being but now the very
[16:56] body that he inhabits man is formed from
[16:58] the dust to the ground and now man has
[17:01] power has has a connection with the
[17:03] Earth that he is told to replenish and
[17:06] to subdue and so now the body becomes
[17:08] part of that
[17:09] blessing brother Bron makes this
[17:12] statement and and if it doesn't seem
[17:14] like these are connecting I think
[17:15] there'll be a point where maybe we'll
[17:16] just put the grout over all of it and
[17:17] it'll seem like it connects but brother
[17:20] says Adam lost the rights of that book
[17:24] so when he fell when he lost his harmony
[17:26] with his maker and our health our
[17:28] strength our eternal Spirit was lost in
[17:29] Adam he lost rights to that
[17:33] book what was that book the book of
[17:36] redemption the title deed to Heaven and
[17:38] Earth the power and control over
[17:41] everything he lost that so man lost when
[17:44] he says he lost his rights to that book
[17:46] man lost his full rights to the Earth
[17:49] and all of
[17:50] creation he would have had a he would
[17:52] have had a dominion and control by the
[17:54] word of God not by his own volition his
[17:56] own savviness and he's smart SM than the
[17:59] serpent and he's smarter than all the
[18:01] Beast and he can trick them by divine
[18:03] power God had conferred into Adam the
[18:06] ability to control all things but as
[18:09] soon as he fell he lost his full rights
[18:11] to the Earth he lost his full power over
[18:13] all of creation and let me say this
[18:15] including his
[18:16] body his brother says our eternal spirit
[18:19] was lost in Adam this this the ability
[18:22] any ability this body may have had to
[18:24] live forever and not die he loses that
[18:27] at the fall
[18:29] now there's a peculiar scripture in Jude
[18:31] n there's no chapters to Jude you could
[18:34] say Jude chapter 1 ver9 but there's just
[18:36] since there's no chapters to it it's
[18:37] Jude verse 9 speaks this and it's a very
[18:40] peculiar scripture within uh theological
[18:43] circles and christiandom and they try to
[18:46] find the origins of it and there was
[18:48] different ancient books the Assumption
[18:49] of Moses and different things that they
[18:52] feel that may be Jude is drawing from
[18:54] but it says Yet Michael the Archangel
[18:57] when contending with the devil he
[19:00] disputed about the body of Moses dur not
[19:02] bring against him a railing accusation
[19:05] but said the Lord rebuke thee so Jude in
[19:07] context is talking about how um you
[19:10] would Wrangle with the adversary the
[19:12] things that you had said or the the
[19:14] things that you would say uh the things
[19:16] that people even say of dignities and
[19:18] things that are holy and and he's said
[19:20] man you you shouldn't say certain things
[19:22] he says even Michael when he was arguing
[19:24] with uh uh the devil just said the Lord
[19:26] rebuke theee but in in this context
[19:29] notice what he says that Michael is
[19:31] contending with the devil over the body
[19:34] of Moses now why would there be an
[19:37] argument with Satan over the body of
[19:39] Moses because of the Fall Satan would
[19:41] have asserted a right to Moses's body
[19:45] and so Satan and Michael and the
[19:47] Archangel are arguing over the body of
[19:49] Moses because be when man fell man lost
[19:53] his first claim to the Earth he could no
[19:55] longer this body coming from the earth
[19:58] he couldn't just assert his right with
[19:59] the title deed says no see this body I
[20:01] own it so that when this body now when
[20:04] he loses that title deed then an
[20:06] accusation could be brought if you don't
[20:09] have the deed to your house if you don't
[20:10] have a lease or a deed you don't have
[20:12] something that proves you own it then
[20:14] have fun argueing it right say well I I
[20:17] live here okay you live there but do you
[20:18] own it and I would I would argue that
[20:21] possession is nine10 of the law and if
[20:23] you're living there you got pretty solid
[20:25] footing at least for some period of time
[20:27] but the argument who owns it who who has
[20:30] a right to it so Satan asserts his right
[20:32] to the body of Moses because when man
[20:35] fell he doesn't even have clear title to
[20:37] his own body I ponder that Ponder how
[20:40] significant this is now when man dies he
[20:43] loses this power to his own body so that
[20:46] when Moses dies God hides the body of
[20:49] Moses as we read from the message and
[20:51] and even understanding from scripture
[20:53] whether it would be to keep Israel from
[20:55] being tempted to idolatry brother Bram
[20:57] using it using it in a beautiful sense
[20:59] that this is now Moses being resurrected
[21:02] as it were being preserved we see him
[21:04] again on Mount Transfiguration but Satan
[21:07] asserts his right to the body because it
[21:09] came from the earth and man has lost his
[21:12] rights to the Earth the power he had to
[21:15] replenish to subdue the blessing of
[21:17] Genesis 1: 128 withdrawn from man so now
[21:20] there's an argument over even the body
[21:23] in the breach brother bam says Adam lost
[21:26] his inheritance the Earth
[21:29] that was his part of his
[21:31] inheritance The Inheritance it was gr
[21:33] granted to him in Genesis 1:28 it was
[21:36] God's to begin with correct then God
[21:38] creates this this is God's Legacy and he
[21:40] leaves it with man he says it's yours
[21:42] that was his inheritance he inherited it
[21:44] from God he says now so Adam lost his
[21:47] inheritance the Earth and remember man
[21:50] is formed not just as a supernatural
[21:53] being from God in the image and likeness
[21:55] of God but he's also brought up from the
[21:57] earth so see the two meet together the
[21:59] Divine deity Supernatural Heaven coming
[22:02] now together with Earth and man is
[22:04] formed together so man comes from the
[22:07] earth and he loses his inheritance the
[22:09] Earth but says now it passed from his
[22:12] hand to the one he sold out to Satan the
[22:15] Earth is now passed he sold his faith in
[22:18] God to Satan's reasonings therefore his
[22:21] eternal life you following me so far his
[22:25] eternal life his right to the tree of
[22:28] life These are things he lost his right
[22:30] to the Earth belonged to him I'm wanting
[22:34] you to understand this connection that
[22:36] God had given man to the Earth his right
[22:38] to the Earth belonged to him and he
[22:39] forfeited it every bit to the hands of
[22:42] Satan he passed it from his hand to
[22:45] Satan it returned and has been polluted
[22:47] and the seed of Adam has destroyed the
[22:50] inheritance that Adam should have had
[22:53] that's the
[22:54] Earth so when Adam fell he forfeits the
[22:58] Earth to Satan now what he does not
[23:01] forfeit is the title deed he's
[23:04] forfeiting possession Satan's a squatter
[23:07] Satan has moved in on a on a vacant
[23:09] piece of a vacant house and he's he's
[23:11] there uh uh not even under the color of
[23:14] title necessarily he's just there and
[23:16] he's invaded the Earth and he's
[23:17] possessing it and he's manipulating he's
[23:19] abusing it and he's abusing man that's
[23:21] come from the earth and that's because
[23:24] Adam when he fell he now forfeits his
[23:28] rights to the Earth and now Satan comes
[23:31] and begins to assume control over it
[23:32] just using maybe summary language in
[23:34] doing so but the title deed the power
[23:37] Genesis 1: 120 the blessing that doesn't
[23:40] go to
[23:42] Satan anybody believe that did not go to
[23:45] Satan the title deed went back to the
[23:48] hands of the original owner so the title
[23:51] deed the power the book of redemption
[23:53] that sealed book however you want to
[23:54] describe it that goes back to the hands
[23:56] of God but now that book being absent
[23:59] from creation puts the whole world into
[24:02] chaos and into a power struggle because
[24:05] man man can't just sit there and say no
[24:06] stop you can't do that and have all
[24:08] power of Heaven behind him now there's
[24:11] there's fightings there's Wars there's
[24:12] going to be murders and killings and
[24:14] there's going to be es and flows and
[24:15] there's going to be seasons of Triumph
[24:17] and righteousness in Israel but then SE
[24:19] seasons of depravity and the whole world
[24:21] is chaotic and turned upside down why
[24:24] man lost his inheritance and this whole
[24:26] inheritance actually comes into the
[24:28] power of Satan what is Satan called in
[24:30] scripture Prince of the power of the air
[24:33] he's called the spirit there's a spirit
[24:35] that now worketh in the children of
[24:37] Disobedience he's called the God of this
[24:38] evil age brother bam describes all of
[24:41] creation now as Satan's Eden now he
[24:44] doesn't have the power he doesn't have
[24:46] Genesis 1:28 he doesn't have full total
[24:48] control as a Divine entity or in the
[24:51] same way that Adam would have had it in
[24:53] the beginning but the Earth which one
[24:55] time belonged to Adam it is now
[24:57] forfeited into the hands of Satan
[25:06] right now in the message fundamental
[25:09] foundation for Faith and this is another
[25:12] sermon that you can go back and listen
[25:13] to and you'll find brother bham touching
[25:15] on some of these points that we're
[25:17] making even in these last few Services
[25:20] brother BR says man in the fall has lost
[25:22] his conscience of what father put him
[25:26] here on Earth to do do this is one of
[25:30] those one of these outstanding
[25:32] statements to me this morning as we go
[25:33] through this when man fell he lost his
[25:36] conscience of what father put him here
[25:39] on Earth to do could you just remember
[25:41] that just take that first sentence there
[25:43] and think about that that what brother
[25:45] bandam is saying is that when man fa
[25:48] he's no longer aware in fully
[25:51] understanding what he was put on Earth
[25:53] to do he's still gonna
[25:55] eat still gonna have kids still going to
[25:59] build and and and propagate and there's
[26:01] going to be a lot of things that happen
[26:03] but he's he forgot what he was put on
[26:04] Earth to do though he may be
[26:06] accomplishing things and though there is
[26:08] a um a history that unfolds and man
[26:12] procreates and man builds and man
[26:15] controls the Earth and he does all sorts
[26:16] of things to Creation but he forgets
[26:19] what he was put on Earth to do he has
[26:20] forgotten Genesis 1 128 because this is
[26:23] the only place that you find where God
[26:25] gives him something specifically to do
[26:27] now you you could look at the
[26:28] prohibitions of partaking of the tree of
[26:30] knowledge of Good and Evil and you could
[26:32] look at how he was given certain things
[26:34] to eat but when it comes to what you to
[26:36] do your marching orders your duty Adam
[26:39] it's Genesis 1 128 when he falls he
[26:41] loses his consciousness of what his
[26:43] commission is brother says in other
[26:45] words all the plumbing as it was in our
[26:48] brain and that's sometimes how we feel
[26:49] about our brain it's just a bunch of
[26:50] plumbing and the outlets the faith has
[26:53] been clogged up with business affair
[26:55] with home life domestic things it's it's
[26:58] all become so clogged up with that until
[27:00] God can't operate through those channels
[27:03] that he made a man
[27:05] for so man was made for God to operate
[27:08] through man and the fall essentially
[27:11] blocks God off from being able to
[27:13] operate through our channels there's no
[27:15] Clear Channel or clear Consciousness
[27:17] that I am a Divine representative upon
[27:19] Earth I am Divine I am deity I am God
[27:22] upon Earth I have been given a a
[27:24] commandment to be fruitful multiply
[27:27] replenish and subdue the earth I have
[27:28] dominion over every living thing on the
[27:30] earth I have all power over Heaven and
[27:33] Earth I'm here as a Divine entity I'm
[27:35] here in the stad of God I have this
[27:38] Divine character I have the mind of
[27:40] Christ I can operate and then God has
[27:42] this Oneness the holy image of God is in
[27:45] flesh the fellowship Oneness between God
[27:47] and His creation and now you just have
[27:49] deity being expressed as soon as man
[27:53] falls it it vacates him and he does even
[27:56] know what he's called to do he can say
[27:58] those things but the harmony is not
[28:00] there the Oneness isn't there the
[28:01] connection isn't there and brother
[28:03] bandam continues this is so beautiful
[28:05] when God made the human body every
[28:07] little part had its place to
[28:10] play so the body had a purpose to it he
[28:13] says the teeth the tongue the eyes the
[28:15] nose God does everything in there to
[28:18] make it perfect in operation to make the
[28:21] man to live and he continues and says if
[28:24] he gave that much thought to your body
[28:25] how much more the body of Christ and
[28:27] that's the point Point that he's trying
[28:28] to make because that's ultimately what
[28:30] God's Acom going to accomplish but what
[28:32] God put man here on Earth to do man lost
[28:35] his conscience his channels become
[28:38] clogged there's no free flow of the
[28:40] Divine into the nature of man and the
[28:43] human body which was to have everything
[28:46] the teeth the eyes the tongue the nose
[28:47] was to have a place to play God put it
[28:50] there to be in perfect operation for
[28:52] that man to live within creation Now
[28:55] something is lost Harmony and unity is
[28:57] lost
[28:59] and because of this man is no longer
[29:01] capable of fulfilling the commission of
[29:03] Genesis 1
[29:04] 128 man can't do it man's still upon
[29:07] Earth the commission seemingly is
[29:08] lingering there but because man can no
[29:11] longer fulfill the commission of Genesis
[29:13] 1 128 God has to recommission him so in
[29:16] Genesis chter 9:
[29:21] 1-7 Genesis 9:
[29:26] 1-7 it says and God blessed Noah and his
[29:29] sons and said unto them now this is
[29:33] from it's from these three sons that we
[29:36] know the whole earth is populated by one
[29:38] blood God has made the whole earth uh to
[29:40] be filled up with Humanity it's coming
[29:42] from this blood that comes forth from
[29:45] the ark and so now this is all of
[29:48] humanity all of creation starting a new
[29:51] as it were After the flood we could call
[29:53] it a a a new world even though I think
[29:56] you could refer to the world that's was
[29:58] destroyed as the new world and now this
[29:59] is a a subsequent world and God blessed
[30:02] Noah and his sons and said unto them
[30:04] notice the how similar this sounds be
[30:06] fruitful and multiply and replenish the
[30:10] earth and the fear of you and the dread
[30:13] of you shall be upon every beast of the
[30:15] earth upon every foul of the air upon
[30:17] all that moveth upon the Earth and upon
[30:19] all the fishes of the sea into your
[30:22] hands are they delivered now it may
[30:25] sound the same but it's very different
[30:28] man is told to have dominion over the
[30:30] fish over the foul and over living every
[30:32] living thing that moves upon the earth
[30:34] now there's just a dread upon every
[30:36] living thing so it's not it's not a
[30:40] continuity of subjection in harmony
[30:43] between the man and creation or man and
[30:46] creature but now there's a dread there's
[30:47] a fear there's something that has
[30:50] interrupted the initial Harmony the man
[30:52] and the lion could have walked together
[30:54] the tiger and the bear would have all
[30:55] had this harmony but now this is all
[30:57] going to be up set but God is going to
[30:59] say now there's going to be the dread of
[31:01] you upon the animal life every moving
[31:04] thing that liveth shall be meat for you
[31:06] this is different than what was said
[31:07] before even as the green herb have I
[31:09] given you all things but the flesh with
[31:12] the life thereof which is the blood
[31:13] thereof shall you not eat and surely
[31:16] your blood of your lives will requ I
[31:18] will I require at the hand of every
[31:20] Beast will I require it and at the hand
[31:22] of man and at the hand of Every Man's
[31:24] brother will I require the life of man
[31:27] who so shth man's blood by man shall his
[31:30] blood be shed for in the image of God
[31:33] made he man so there's still something
[31:35] special about the VIS of man the the the
[31:38] body of man the the nature of man
[31:40] there's still something special about it
[31:42] so God is preserving it and sanctifying
[31:45] it and and set it in a special that it
[31:47] ought not to be taken though you may eat
[31:50] uh every moving thing that moves shall
[31:51] be meat for you there's a a division
[31:54] that's made amongst the flesh with life
[31:55] thereof and how you shall not take
[31:58] another man's life and because man is in
[32:00] the image of God in verse 7 again and
[32:02] you be ye fruitful and multiply bring
[32:05] forth abundantly in the earth and
[32:08] multiply therein now as you read that
[32:11] would you you could we could agree that
[32:13] it's very familiar to what's said in
[32:15] Genesis 1 128 but what's missing there's
[32:19] no commission to
[32:21] subdue it's very similar in the have
[32:23] dominion over the fish and the fowl and
[32:25] every living thing that moveth be
[32:26] fruitful multiply replenish the Earth
[32:28] the very phrase is there be fruitful
[32:30] multiply replenish the Earth be fruitful
[32:32] multiply bring forth a bundle in the
[32:34] earth multiply therein but God is very
[32:36] purposeful because he has not told them
[32:38] to subdue it he has not given them power
[32:42] to subdue because what is being said
[32:45] here represents a new
[32:46] order it's not dominion over the Earth
[32:49] as Adam had it because Mo Noah and his
[32:52] sons are not going to sit there as a god
[32:54] upon Earth to be able to control
[32:56] everything and bring things back and say
[32:58] oh man this is a this is a chaotic world
[33:01] after this flood let's just reverse the
[33:03] curse let's just bring things back and
[33:05] let's move mountains and let's do this
[33:07] and do that Noah and his sons did not
[33:09] have that power though they are
[33:11] commissioned by God saying I want you to
[33:13] multiply you're going to bring forth
[33:15] seed and you're going to populate the
[33:17] whole earth and from you is going to
[33:18] come every living known man upon the
[33:20] face of the Earth and I'm going to make
[33:22] you uh give fear over you of every beast
[33:25] in the earth and every foul of the air
[33:26] and everything that moves and all the
[33:28] fish in the sea they're going to uh
[33:30] they're delivered into your hands you
[33:31] can uh those are yours uh uh to wrestle
[33:34] with to take as you want and for your
[33:36] possession but it's not Dominion like
[33:38] man had as a God can you understand that
[33:41] this is a this is a new commission he's
[33:44] not reissuing the Commandment to Adam
[33:47] God isn't saying oh here hold on Moses
[33:49] Hold On Noah hold on right here let me
[33:51] find it yet Genesis 1:28 and then
[33:54] recommissioning Noah and his three sons
[33:57] after Genesis 128 this is a new
[33:59] commandment
[34:01] altogether when God blesses Noah he's
[34:04] saying this is this is something new for
[34:06] Humanity this is something new for
[34:08] fallen man because by one Blood by one
[34:10] hybrid blood all mankind is going to
[34:12] populate the whole earth and so it's a
[34:14] new commandment really for a new mix of
[34:17] people a hybrid people so God has to
[34:21] recommission man and he has to give them
[34:24] a new commandment be fruitful multiply
[34:26] and replenish the Earth but what's Miss
[34:27] in no commandment to subdue the
[34:32] earth now are you each one of you
[34:35] following me so far this
[34:36] morning we're just slowly slowly going
[34:40] through
[34:41] this now Genesis chapter 3: 22-
[34:46] 24 I'm looking at this to show that man
[34:51] in his and this is review this portion
[34:53] here is definitely review that man in
[34:56] his perfection in the G
[34:58] still had further Expressions uh um to
[35:01] be made Genesis 3: 22- 24 and the Lord
[35:05] God said behold the man as is become as
[35:09] one of us to know good and evil plain
[35:13] language man had become something more
[35:16] like God he was already made in the
[35:18] image of God and perfect but now he does
[35:22] something and he acts a certain way he
[35:24] manifests something and in manifesting
[35:27] something God says he's become as one of
[35:29] us or if I could put it this way just if
[35:31] you wanted to give me um the Liberty to
[35:34] use this language he's become more like
[35:36] us man has become as one of us to know
[35:38] good and evil so now something man in
[35:40] his Perfection has taken a step further
[35:43] and if we could use this phrase he's
[35:45] become more perfect man who was like God
[35:47] has become more like
[35:49] God man who had the
[35:51] potential to express the Divine has done
[35:54] something that in one sense is more
[35:56] Divine than what he had had before so
[35:58] God recognizes
[36:00] this then he says and now lest he put
[36:02] forth his hand so now there's something
[36:05] more he can
[36:06] do and take also of the tree life and
[36:08] eat and live
[36:10] forever therefore the Lord God set him
[36:13] forth from the Garden of Eden to till
[36:15] the ground from whence he was taken so
[36:16] he drove out the man why because man has
[36:19] become more like us and now lest he put
[36:20] forth his hand take of the Tree of Life
[36:22] eat and live forever I'm going to drive
[36:24] out the man and he placed at the east of
[36:26] the Garden of Eden chams and a flaming
[36:29] sword which turned every way to keep the
[36:32] way of the Tree of Life in other words
[36:35] to seal man off to this from the secret
[36:38] of the further
[36:40] glory to seal man off from this power to
[36:44] take eat and live forever now it's
[36:47] symbolic language I believe it's it's
[36:50] descriptive and it's symbolic and it's
[36:53] showing us that there was something
[36:55] there that man in his per ction was to
[36:58] walk forward in the blessing in the
[37:00] commandment and as he fulfilled God's
[37:02] commission as he had a consciousness of
[37:04] what father put him here on Earth to do
[37:07] as he would act in it he would become
[37:09] more Godlike Express more of God now if
[37:12] if it's hard to understand that just
[37:14] think of the reality that even in
[37:16] eternity God's going to continue to
[37:18] unfold himself he's he's inexhaustible
[37:21] so even Adam in his Perfection still had
[37:23] more to manifest more to accomplish and
[37:26] it become a further the reflection of
[37:29] the divine nature and God so Adam could
[37:31] have walked in this consciousness of
[37:33] what he's placed on Earth to do and now
[37:35] he steps outside of the Commission in
[37:38] Acts and God says he's still become more
[37:41] like us and lest he step further and do
[37:45] more I'm going to stop him from having
[37:49] access to the Tree of Life lest he
[37:50] partake of that and live forever so now
[37:53] God has sealed man off from the secret
[37:55] of further Glory
[37:57] man is not going to be man from that
[37:59] moment on has never gotten any closer to
[38:01] God and God likeness in his
[38:04] flesh that that was the very moment that
[38:06] humanity is degraded and he's not moving
[38:09] towards Perfection he's not moving
[38:10] towards the kingdom he's not moving
[38:12] towards a further expression of God so
[38:16] this shows that there was a further
[38:17] expression of God likeness that could
[38:20] have unfolded or that was to be made
[38:21] manifest in
[38:24] Adam do we can you uh just if you if
[38:27] you're able to just give some
[38:29] affirmation this morning it'd be
[38:31] wonderful if only if you understand it I
[38:34] I don't I don't like for amens to be
[38:36] prompted and say tell someone to say
[38:38] Amen when they can't say Amen it's a
[38:40] very dangerous dangerous place to be and
[38:43] so a very dangerous position to be put
[38:46] in to to demand amens of one who cannot
[38:49] volunteer it of the of the unction of
[38:51] the holy spirit so these scriptures man
[38:53] has become as one of us shows there was
[38:55] a further expression of God liken
[38:58] and then for it say now lest he take
[39:00] also of the Tree of Life suggest that
[39:02] there was more that could have developed
[39:04] this is what the scriptures show to us
[39:06] that there was more that was to unfold
[39:09] so the power the promise the potential
[39:12] that Humanity held was left
[39:15] unfinished and this is this is what
[39:18] we're uh uh this is really maybe what we
[39:20] were spending the first 30 40 minutes
[39:22] just emphasizing is that man lost
[39:25] something his harmony with his maker the
[39:27] maker harmony with his creation our
[39:29] health our strength our eternal spirit
[39:31] he lost the rights to the book he lost
[39:32] his inheritance the Earth he all these
[39:35] things that he lost his holy image of
[39:36] God the fellowship oness with God was
[39:38] broken all the power that Humanity held
[39:40] was lost all the potential that Humanity
[39:43] stood for all all the promise that Adam
[39:45] and the woman have is left
[39:48] unfinished and so was the
[39:52] earth so is the earth brother bam says
[39:54] in the third seal who is able to come
[39:56] and take this book of redemp
[39:58] referring to Revelation 5 for the whole
[40:00] Plan of Redemption from Adam all that
[40:03] Adam lost there was nothing lost until
[40:05] Adam and after Adam all was lost in the
[40:09] earth everything on the creation of the
[40:12] Earth was
[40:13] lost this is where this is all coming in
[40:16] view to me when as God has inspired this
[40:19] God created in the beginning God created
[40:22] God's creation is
[40:24] lost the the potential of it the promise
[40:26] of it what what he wanted to do with it
[40:28] things are being lost he says all Adam
[40:30] was lost with after Adam all was lost in
[40:33] the earth everything on the creation
[40:35] Earth was lost and everything fell with
[40:37] Adam crossed the chasm no one could get
[40:40] back no way at all man when he sinned he
[40:42] left his way he left no way back for
[40:47] himself so there is now
[40:50] a uh
[40:52] uh the power of mankind lays dormant all
[40:59] the promise that he had everything that
[41:01] he could do you talk about wasted talent
[41:03] and all that had such potential it's
[41:06] gone and it's not only just Adam as a
[41:09] man but the Earth feels the same loss
[41:12] everything the Earth was to do
[41:14] everything the Earth was to be
[41:15] everything all the potential this
[41:17] beautiful Perfect Harmony between
[41:18] Creator and creation and and the the
[41:20] made and the maker oh it's oh this is so
[41:23] amazing this is so wonderful it's all
[41:25] lost all of a sudden Humanity is left un
[41:28] the purpose of humanity what father put
[41:30] him here on Earth to do is left
[41:31] unfinished and what he was supposed to
[41:33] do related to the Earth therefore the
[41:35] Earth's potential is left
[41:38] unsatisfied right but from the beginning
[41:43] God was aiming for something glorious
[41:46] that's right and because that was his
[41:48] aim he's going to hit
[41:50] it that's the beautiful part from the
[41:53] beginning God was aiming in the
[41:54] beginning God created he was aiming for
[41:57] something glorious and God will do it
[42:00] just say he
[42:02] won't God's going to do
[42:04] it God's going to accomplish it because
[42:07] in Revelations chapter 21 let's read
[42:09] this now I think this just means so much
[42:11] more to me to read it here in this
[42:14] context of what we just went
[42:17] through because even after we read in
[42:19] Genesis 9 how there's a a world New
[42:22] World Order and a commission given to
[42:24] Noah and it follows this order that was
[42:26] given to
[42:28] Adam from Genesis 3 to Genesis 9 we just
[42:31] see the upheaval and turmoil and tearing
[42:34] down of of God's creation and then even
[42:38] after the New World Order we see mankind
[42:40] is just further thrown into a a a
[42:42] confusion and Chaos of Babel and
[42:44] everything but this this creation of God
[42:48] from the beginning this in the beginning
[42:50] God created the heavens and the Earth
[42:52] and and the so quick undoing of all of
[42:55] it and all the p potential and the
[42:57] promise and the power and man what he's
[43:00] supposed to be to his maker and creation
[43:02] what it's supposed to be to man and all
[43:04] this big beautiful picture all of it's
[43:06] lost but now you get to Revelation 21
[43:08] and remember those parallels that you
[43:10] could bring out between Genesis and
[43:11] Revelation says and I saw a new Heaven
[43:14] and a new Earth for the first Heaven and
[43:16] the first Earth were passed away now
[43:18] what was brother B points out to us it's
[43:21] not annihilated and gone but renovated
[43:23] redeemed amen it's passed away the the
[43:26] the former El elements and the things
[43:27] that were imperfect there's a new Heaven
[43:29] A New Earth these original spoken word
[43:31] attributes of God uh that anything that
[43:34] was perverted anything that was unsavory
[43:37] anything that was not part of the
[43:38] original has been purged out and it's a
[43:40] new Heaven and a new Earth re remade re
[43:44] re renovated and there was no more sea
[43:47] and I John saw the holy city New
[43:49] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[43:51] Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for
[43:53] her husband we've gone through these
[43:55] things through these first several
[43:57] uh services in this subject and he says
[44:00] and I heard a great voice out of Heaven
[44:01] saying now this is beautiful behold the
[44:05] Tabernacle of God is with men this is
[44:08] this Fellowship of Oneness being
[44:09] restored back to man behold the
[44:11] Tabernacle of God is with men and he
[44:13] will dwell with them and they shall be
[44:15] his people and God himself shall be with
[44:17] them and be their God what is this the
[44:19] holy image of God being united back
[44:22] together the Tabernacle of God God not
[44:24] only the Tabernacle of God with men but
[44:27] man is the Tabernacle of God yeah he's
[44:30] going to dwell in them they're dwelling
[44:31] together this is the expression of God
[44:33] where do we see him how do we know him
[44:35] here he is man is the Tabernacle of
[44:38] God and then beautiful beautiful verse
[44:41] four and God shall wipe away all tears
[44:44] from their eyes and there shall be no
[44:47] more death neither sorrow nor crying
[44:50] neither shall there be any more pain for
[44:52] the former things are passed away that's
[44:55] right God has now anything that was able
[44:58] to come up in Genesis 3 God's dealt with
[45:00] it gone it's over where did Death come
[45:03] in Genesis 3 where does it end
[45:04] Revelations 21 it's gone where does
[45:07] sorrow come in Genesis 3 where do we
[45:08] know it's completely gone and no more
[45:10] Revelation
[45:12] 21 verse 5 and he that sat upon the
[45:14] throne said behold I make all things new
[45:19] the same God in the beginning who
[45:20] created now says I make all things new
[45:23] the very God who formed man of the Dust
[45:25] of the ground the very one who made all
[45:27] things that are the very one that made
[45:28] all of creation Now is declaring
[45:30] something that is
[45:33] glorious I make all things new now
[45:35] consider what is now made and what's
[45:37] represented Revelation 21 compared to
[45:40] what was made in Genesis 1 and 2 and we
[45:42] can say this without without a doubt at
[45:45] all what he makes here will never be
[45:48] defiled amen yes what he has made I make
[45:51] all things new it will never top over
[45:54] it'll never go into a cycle it'll never
[45:56] revert back to sorrow never revert back
[45:58] to death it'll never revert back to
[46:00] night I make all things new this is what
[46:03] God in the beginning was
[46:05] foreshadowing this is what Satan thought
[46:07] he had
[46:08] upended but it was necessary for God to
[46:10] be a redeemer so God allowed there to be
[46:13] a fall to the original creation but now
[46:14] he says behold I make all things new and
[46:16] he said unto me right for these words
[46:18] are true and faithful and this verse s
[46:21] six is is hit me harder than it I it's
[46:24] almost as if I'd never read it before
[46:26] and he said unto me it is
[46:28] done amen it is done now it is finished
[46:35] now is accomplished well I thought when
[46:36] we read in Genesis chapter 2 and God
[46:38] rested on the seventh day he said no
[46:40] every seed's been
[46:41] swn I won't I don't need to create from
[46:45] nothing again the spoken word Original
[46:47] Seed has been sown and now you can say
[46:50] it is done yeah that which I spoke in
[46:53] the beginning that which was embodied in
[46:55] Genesis 1: 11 that which was embodied in
[46:58] Genesis 1 128 that which was meant in
[47:00] humanity in Genesis chapter 2 all these
[47:02] things that I've spoke it is done I am
[47:05] Alpha and Omega the beginning and the
[47:08] end am it is done I've accomplished it
[47:12] what I was wanting in humanity what I
[47:14] was wanting in creation it is
[47:15] accomplished and I will give unto him
[47:17] that is a thirst of the Fountain of the
[47:19] Water of Life freely he that overcome a
[47:21] Herod all things all of creation all
[47:24] that is finished all that I've made new
[47:26] and I will be his God and he shall be my
[47:28] son it's the very image that God
[47:31] expressed in the beginning amen but now
[47:34] it's not just a man who stepped forth
[47:36] from God but now it is one who has
[47:38] overcome to inherit all things Adam lost
[47:42] his inheritance the Earth but he did it
[47:43] without suffering Adam had lost his
[47:45] inher or had inherited the Earth but he
[47:47] did it without suffering and he lost all
[47:49] of his inheritance to the Earth but now
[47:51] here's one that overcomes and inherits
[47:54] all things and God is his God and he is
[47:56] his the son it's the very image that God
[47:59] had in the beginning perfected yes oh
[48:02] it's so beautiful oh it's so wonderful I
[48:05] wish I had more breath in my
[48:08] lungs I wish I wasn't so tired I wish I
[48:12] could really just preach this well maybe
[48:14] if I was a better preacher I could and
[48:16] I'll accept that but even now to
[48:18] whatever degree if I'm a two on a scale
[48:20] of one to a 100 I wish I was really
[48:22] getting a two right now to be able to
[48:24] convey just how perfect this picture is
[48:26] in my my eyes how God begins to describe
[48:29] the new Heaven and the new Earth and how
[48:31] it appears to be the full development of
[48:33] the negative of Genesis 1 2 and 3 that's
[48:36] right it is done I am the alpha that was
[48:41] there in Genesis 1 I'm the Omega here in
[48:43] Genesis 21 what I set out to do I have
[48:49] accomplished that
[48:51] beautiful so now let's
[48:55] continue with this picture of what God's
[48:58] wanting to get to we have to get
[49:02] there is it isn't it beautiful to be
[49:04] reminded that we're we're in this
[49:07] spiritual condition now as this New
[49:09] Jerusalem the bride the body the
[49:11] Tabernacle of God here upon Earth now we
[49:13] ended with this statement last time
[49:15] conflict between God and Satan and you
[49:17] might wonder why didn't you just start
[49:19] with this and service would have been
[49:20] half as long um I wrestled with just
[49:23] what order to go in but I felt some of
[49:25] these things were necessary to
[49:26] background this conflict between God and
[49:29] Satan God at the beginning gave his
[49:32] children the atomic weapon because he's
[49:34] the infinite God seeing there was going
[49:37] to be a conflict and there was going to
[49:39] be a battle so did the battle surprise
[49:41] God no did God have to scramble all of a
[49:44] sudden he like oh no no Michael come
[49:45] here Satan's in the garden why didn't we
[49:48] think of this he's talking to the woman
[49:50] what's going to happen no he had it all
[49:52] laid out
[49:54] there knowing there'd be a conflict
[49:56] there's going to be a battle God
[49:57] equipped his children with the right
[49:59] kind of ammunition right kind of attack
[50:02] the right kind of
[50:04] everything that they would have need of
[50:06] and this is the phrase to me that I
[50:08] trust that you never
[50:10] forget that would sweep them all the way
[50:14] from Eden to the
[50:18] Rapture isn't that statement just
[50:20] amazing isn't it
[50:22] precious it's almost as if we read it
[50:24] and we're like well okay yeah Technic Al
[50:27] the same word he gave him in the
[50:28] beginning it's the same word that we use
[50:30] now in the end but he's not saying it
[50:32] that way he's saying that God knew there
[50:35] would be
[50:36] conflict God knew there would be a
[50:39] battle so before man ever fell and would
[50:42] need a resurrection before man ever fell
[50:45] and would need a Rapture before man ever
[50:47] fell and would need Redemption God gave
[50:49] him a word that would do
[50:51] it before there was death he gave him a
[50:53] word that could defeat death before
[50:54] there was sickness he gave him a word
[50:56] that could defeat sickness however you
[50:57] want to look at it is exactly what
[50:59] brother bram's saying he gave him the
[51:00] right kind of attack he says what was it
[51:02] the word he gave him a word in the
[51:04] beginning that would sweep them all the
[51:06] way from Eden as it fell and it would be
[51:09] that word that would lead you to a
[51:11] Rapture so when did God speak the word
[51:14] for a Rapture Genesis
[51:17] 1 spoken word is the Original Seed
[51:20] that's why when you go back to that
[51:21] message spoken words of the original
[51:22] seed and you recognize that this message
[51:25] does not just bring us back to the day
[51:27] of Pentecost this message does not just
[51:29] try to restore back Christian principles
[51:31] to the Christian church but it brings us
[51:33] back to the in the beginning amen brings
[51:36] us back to the original purpose and
[51:38] nature of God he gave them a word that
[51:40] would sweep them all the way from Eden
[51:42] in a fall to the
[51:44] Rapture and I let me say this I believe
[51:47] it's embodied in Genesis 1
[51:50] 128 that's that's when the word is given
[51:52] to man it's the only place that we can
[51:54] read and God blessed them and God is
[51:57] giving them the word of God it's the one
[51:59] thing that we could see where it's
[52:00] embodied it embodies all this he gave
[52:03] them a word that would sweep them from
[52:04] Eden to the Rapture think Genesis 1: 12
[52:07] would give mankind everything he would
[52:09] need in the earth he was given his eyes
[52:11] his nose his teeth everything that the
[52:13] body in order for him to live he was
[52:14] given five senses to contact this
[52:16] Earthly home he had every element
[52:17] everything there that he needed he came
[52:19] from the earth he had a body everything
[52:21] was there but he needed this power now
[52:24] in him to operate and function within it
[52:26] and God by Genesis 128 gave him
[52:28] everything he would need to live in Eden
[52:30] and not just live in Eden but take him
[52:32] in a
[52:34] Rapture the word in Genesis 1 128 that
[52:37] points to the Rapture is this very power
[52:39] that he was given to subdue the
[52:42] Earth multiply replenish the Earth be
[52:45] fruitful multiply replenish the Earth is
[52:47] given to Noah but the power to subdue is
[52:49] withheld from him but in the beginning
[52:51] in this original blessing and
[52:53] commandment this word that he was given
[52:55] to sweep them all the way from from Eden
[52:56] to the Rapture where do we find a word
[52:58] to sweep them to the Rapture I have
[53:00] given you Adam power to subdue the Earth
[53:04] yes subdue means to
[53:06] subject to to to force to keep under to
[53:10] bring under
[53:12] subjection it means to dominate or tread
[53:16] down Adam I give you power to subdue the
[53:20] earth now when we think subdue the Earth
[53:21] do we think just the the dust of the
[53:23] earth he's going to be able to make sand
[53:24] castles or he's going to be able to
[53:25] build Adobe Huts or he's going to be
[53:28] able to subject the clay and he's going
[53:29] to bring seed out of it or does it also
[53:31] relate to
[53:33] this cuz he formed him from the dust of
[53:35] the earth so the power to subdue the
[53:37] Earth gives them power to subdue the
[53:39] flesh so before even the flesh had
[53:42] fallen God says I'm going to give you
[53:43] power to subject it that's what he was
[53:47] originally within him he was to have
[53:49] that power it's kabash subdue kabash put
[53:51] the kabash on it I don't know if that's
[53:53] exactly where they get it from it may be
[53:54] Hebrew or Yiddish or something subdue
[53:56] kabash to subject to force to keep under
[53:59] to bring into subjection to dominate and
[54:01] tread down subdue the Earth dominate it
[54:04] tread it down bring it under subjection
[54:06] and Paul now uses this very language in
[54:09] 1 Corinthians
[54:10] 9:27 he says but I keep under my body
[54:13] and bring it into
[54:15] subjection lest that by any means when I
[54:17] have preached to others I myself should
[54:19] be a cast away it's the exact same
[54:22] language that God gives Adam to subdue
[54:24] the Earth to keep it un bring it into
[54:30] subjection and Paul is I believe picking
[54:32] up on this Revelation that this is what
[54:34] man is supposed to do he is to possess
[54:37] this vessel he's to subdue this Earth I
[54:38] will keep under my body I will bring it
[54:40] into subjection I will control it not
[54:43] let it control me I will have power over
[54:46] it so this this blessing this power this
[54:49] commandment the word in Genesis 1: 128
[54:51] to subdue the Earth This Promise relates
[54:54] to the body
[54:56] and it pointed to the further Glory that
[54:59] man was ordained to
[55:01] manifest because man acts and and God
[55:04] says man's become more like us now lest
[55:07] he reach forth and partake of the tree
[55:09] of life and live forever in what his
[55:12] flesh I'm going to stop him from doing
[55:15] it so this power to subdue the flesh
[55:17] this power to subdue the Earth which is
[55:20] which the flesh relates to it Point
[55:22] pointed to the further Glory that man
[55:24] could have walked in and manifest
[55:28] Ed can I get your permission to go
[55:30] further thank you in the message hear ye
[55:34] him now and I I think I just want that
[55:36] to stand there and I hope it I hope it
[55:38] there's enough there that I've shared in
[55:40] this I I I just don't have the uh that
[55:43] just the clarity this morning in my in
[55:45] my mind I think to know whether or not
[55:47] I'm even uh passing this along
[55:50] correctly but let let's just let it
[55:52] stand there I gave you power to subdue
[55:56] the Earth Earth that was power to sweep
[55:58] them all the way to a Rapture what's the
[55:59] Rapture change of these
[56:02] bodies so now God had
[56:06] contemplated a further
[56:09] Glory now in the message hear ye
[56:12] him when God made man he made him a God
[56:16] he gave him dominion over the Earth that
[56:19] would include the flesh all of creation
[56:22] but his Fallen estate dropped that his
[56:25] dominion over the Earth that's why man
[56:28] can't keep himself alive no matter how
[56:29] hard he
[56:30] tries but what they lost by Adam it was
[56:35] restored by
[56:36] Christ now this is where it just there's
[56:39] so many statements I want to read to you
[56:42] and I trust we'll be able to get to a
[56:43] lot of them here I'm telling
[56:46] you Calvary means more to me than it's
[56:48] ever meant the the the story of God
[56:51] sending his son means more to me
[56:53] Christmas is going to mean I know he
[56:54] wasn't born in December but it's going
[56:55] to mean a little a little bit more to me
[56:56] this year to understand these things in
[56:59] light of the full picture it was
[57:01] restored by Christ what Adam lost was
[57:04] restored by
[57:06] Christ brother says everything the human
[57:09] race lost in Adam was redeemed when
[57:12] Christ okay so now what man lost Christ
[57:16] is showing he's
[57:17] restored so there has to be then the
[57:21] resurrection of the power the potential
[57:22] the promise all that Humanity held and
[57:24] now some connection to the Earth as a
[57:26] creation and the body which came from
[57:29] the
[57:29] earth Braham says in the message Led Led
[57:32] by the
[57:34] spirit he says and he sent his son on
[57:36] earth made in likeness of sinful flesh
[57:39] and he died that we might be redeemed
[57:41] and brought back to God to be Sons and
[57:44] Daughters of God to walk with him again
[57:46] notice this phrase that Missing Link
[57:49] from the Garden of Eden what Adam lost
[57:52] Christ restored again we often think The
[57:56] Missing Link is the serpent correct
[57:58] there's another Missing
[58:00] Link why because there had to be the
[58:02] brother ra said the correct son would
[58:04] have been Christ he would have
[58:06] eventually come forth right but he
[58:09] didn't so that was the missing link that
[58:11] son had to come he had to be made
[58:13] manifest but it couldn't come without
[58:15] their first being a fall and there has
[58:18] to be suffering and there had to be
[58:20] death and there had to be sorrow before
[58:22] that son had come had to come so that's
[58:24] the missing link from the garden what
[58:26] Adam lost Christ restores
[58:30] again so Christ restores what Adam loses
[58:34] so in Genesis 3: 14-
[58:37] 15 he says this is a curse to the
[58:40] serpent but it prophesies of this
[58:42] Redeemer The Missing Link so as he's
[58:44] cursing The Serpent and creating one
[58:46] missing
[58:47] link he reveals the other Missing Link
[58:50] amen right Genesis 3:14-15 and the Lord
[58:53] God said unto the serpent because thou
[58:55] Hast done this Thou Art cursed above all
[58:57] cattle and above every beast of the
[58:59] field and upon thy belly shalt thou go
[59:01] and notice what it says and dust shalt
[59:03] thou eat all the days of thy life now
[59:06] that's a peculiar phrase isn't it where
[59:09] does man's body come from the dust of
[59:12] the earth what is that serpent seed done
[59:16] to this flesh it's caused death that
[59:20] hybriding that mongrelize so now the
[59:22] serpent swn into Humanity it's going to
[59:25] eat man's flesh all the days of its life
[59:29] as long as that hybrid is in flesh what
[59:32] does it do it dies it dies so God is
[59:35] declaring more than just you're going to
[59:37] Slither on your belly and the dust of
[59:38] the earth going to get in your mouth but
[59:41] no it also speaks to the fact that he's
[59:43] a flesh eater that it takes life from
[59:46] man so he says and I'll put enity in
[59:49] light of the fact that you are going to
[59:51] be the one that causes death to mankind
[59:53] I'll put enmity between thy seed
[59:57] between thee and the woman and between
[59:59] thy seed and her seed it shall bruise
[1:00:05] thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel
[1:00:09] so the it is a he this is a prophecy of
[1:00:12] who Christ who restores back everything
[1:00:15] Adam lost so when BR when God now is
[1:00:18] speaking this he says the serpent you're
[1:00:20] going to be a uh you're going to crawl
[1:00:21] on your belly every day all the days of
[1:00:24] your life and he says but now I'm going
[1:00:26] to put enity between the seed of the
[1:00:28] woman and thy seed and the seed of the
[1:00:30] woman is he it is Christ and because
[1:00:33] he's going to restore everything Adam
[1:00:35] lost then he is going to have power to
[1:00:38] bruise thy
[1:00:40] head he's going to have power to crush
[1:00:43] thy head so the serpent was a flesh
[1:00:45] eater and because of sin All Flesh is as
[1:00:48] grass and it Withers away and I I could
[1:00:50] share more scriptures in that but we'll
[1:00:52] just make quick reference to them
[1:00:53] because of the fall of mankind his flesh
[1:00:56] becomes subject to death and man is
[1:00:58] dying and he Withers away and his life
[1:01:00] is but a vapor but now in this prophecy
[1:01:02] of Christ say Christ is going to crush
[1:01:05] the head of the flesh
[1:01:07] eater he's going to crush the head of
[1:01:10] the one that brought death into mankind
[1:01:12] he's going to destroy death why because
[1:01:14] he restores what Adam lost Adam had
[1:01:17] power over death he forfeited power over
[1:01:19] his body he forfeited power over the
[1:01:21] flesh to keep it alive to sustain it but
[1:01:24] now in the very first prophecy of Christ
[1:01:26] the very thing that we see come up is
[1:01:29] the fact that Christ is going to destroy
[1:01:32] death and the one that caused
[1:01:35] it the serpent who eats the Flesh and
[1:01:38] causes death and he going to eat dust
[1:01:40] all the days of his life there's going
[1:01:43] to come one that's going to have power
[1:01:46] to
[1:01:48] subdue in John chap 10: 17 to
[1:01:52] 18 therefore doth my father love me
[1:01:56] because now notice who could say this I
[1:01:59] Lay My Life down that I might take it
[1:02:02] again huh
[1:02:04] what I'm going to lay my life down but
[1:02:07] I'm going to take it back up again who
[1:02:08] can do this who has power to do that no
[1:02:12] man taketh it from me but I lay it down
[1:02:15] of myself and could you imagine those
[1:02:17] people over there who are you know
[1:02:18] sharpening their knives and tying knots
[1:02:21] and getting nails ready wanting to
[1:02:22] crucify this guy we're going to take him
[1:02:24] we're going to take his life and he goes
[1:02:25] oh you're not going to take it from me
[1:02:27] I'm going to lay it down well fair
[1:02:30] enough if you just want to give yourself
[1:02:31] up and die like oh and not only that
[1:02:33] I'll just come right back up again like
[1:02:36] who does this who takes his life and
[1:02:38] then take it who gives his life and
[1:02:39] could take it back again this doesn't
[1:02:41] even make any sense surely he is a mad
[1:02:44] man but he says this I have power to lay
[1:02:49] it
[1:02:49] down and I have power to take it
[1:02:53] again this is new yeah any man could
[1:02:57] take his life any man could could lay
[1:03:01] his life down put himself in a dangerous
[1:03:03] situation put his life in Peril and act
[1:03:05] in a way that's negligent or uh Reckless
[1:03:07] and take his own life and take somebody
[1:03:09] else's life a man can voluntarily
[1:03:11] willingly do something to cause life to
[1:03:14] uh to go out of his body but no man can
[1:03:16] reverse
[1:03:17] that and he says and no one certain
[1:03:20] terms I have power to lay down my life I
[1:03:22] have power to give my life and I have
[1:03:23] power to give myself life again now
[1:03:26] where in the world did you get that
[1:03:27] Jesus this commandment have I received
[1:03:30] of my father the Commandment had been
[1:03:33] given back to to man again he didn't
[1:03:36] just have it because again he's just
[1:03:37] saving he knows he knows molecules and
[1:03:40] he had essential oils that we don't have
[1:03:43] I mean it was nothing like that he had
[1:03:45] power from the Father the father had
[1:03:47] given him a commandment multiply
[1:03:50] replenish subdue the Earth I've given
[1:03:53] you power to lay down your life I've
[1:03:55] given you Commandments to take it back
[1:03:56] up again he had received a commission of
[1:03:59] the Father the commandment and the
[1:04:00] blessing had been revived in Christ all
[1:04:03] that Adam had lost in the fall Christ is
[1:04:05] proven that it restores back Christ is
[1:04:08] proving God's Plan of Redemption by
[1:04:10] saying I give you power to lay down your
[1:04:11] life and I give you power to take your
[1:04:13] life back up I'm showing that Redemption
[1:04:16] is in
[1:04:18] you the power lays within you
[1:04:21] Jesus how did he have it why did he have
[1:04:23] it it was given to him a commandment a
[1:04:27] blessing an enduement was conferred upon
[1:04:29] him this commandment have I received of
[1:04:31] my father he didn't even he couldn't
[1:04:33] even brag about the power to lay his
[1:04:35] life down and to take it back up of his
[1:04:37] own volition of his own will it came
[1:04:39] from
[1:04:41] God Revelations chapter 1 verse5 and
[1:04:45] from Jesus Christ who is the faithful
[1:04:47] witness and the first begotten of the
[1:04:51] Dead you don't want to leave now
[1:04:57] this is when it's getting
[1:05:00] good there's not a mass Exodus taking
[1:05:03] place you know if anybody's wondering
[1:05:06] but Jesus Christ who's the faithful
[1:05:08] witness and the first begotten of the
[1:05:11] dead now that's a strange phrase isn't
[1:05:13] it first begotten of the Dead we know
[1:05:16] he's the only he was the only begotten
[1:05:18] Son of God but now he's the first
[1:05:19] begotten of dead the first born or it is
[1:05:21] the first to enter
[1:05:23] life the first to ra ra by power given
[1:05:27] to him to Immortal
[1:05:30] Life this is something that's inherent
[1:05:33] in what Man was created to be and what
[1:05:35] Man was created to have and to express
[1:05:36] God's power of redemption what greater
[1:05:38] power of redemption would there to be
[1:05:40] for something to have completely
[1:05:41] vanquished of life but then have power
[1:05:44] to bring the life right back up that's
[1:05:47] what all nature testifies to that's what
[1:05:49] it was all the cycles of day and night
[1:05:51] everything God was always testifying and
[1:05:53] poined us so now Christ is the first
[1:05:55] begotten the first born from the dead
[1:05:56] the first one to enter Life by a power
[1:05:59] that was given to him he was raised from
[1:06:01] death into not just life again but
[1:06:03] Immortal
[1:06:05] Life though some were raised before from
[1:06:08] the dead it was not by a power they
[1:06:12] possessed nor was it to eternal
[1:06:15] life they could not raise themselves
[1:06:18] back up nor was it to eternal life
[1:06:20] though many had been I say many though
[1:06:22] others were raised from the
[1:06:24] dead Christ
[1:06:26] had power to give up his
[1:06:29] life power to take it up again because
[1:06:32] it was conferred upon him a blessing
[1:06:34] given to him so he's called the first
[1:06:36] begotten of the Dead in Colossians 1:18
[1:06:39] and he is the head of the body of the
[1:06:40] church who is the beginning the first
[1:06:43] born from the
[1:06:45] dead that in all things he might have
[1:06:48] the preeminence that in all things he
[1:06:51] might have the preeminence and we're
[1:06:52] told that he that overcometh shall
[1:06:53] inherit all things
[1:06:56] behold I make all things new that in all
[1:06:59] things he might have the premise it's
[1:07:00] because he's the first born from the
[1:07:02] dead he's the first to conquer
[1:07:04] death the first begotten of the Dead the
[1:07:07] first to enter into life from Life into
[1:07:10] death into immortality he's the first
[1:07:12] born from the dead and he's not called
[1:07:14] the only born from the dead but the
[1:07:15] first begotten from the dead the first
[1:07:17] born from the dead the first to conquer
[1:07:20] death because why the powers to be
[1:07:22] conferred upon others amen he is not the
[1:07:24] only begotten from the dead why there
[1:07:26] are others also who are going to share
[1:07:28] in this
[1:07:30] immortality he's the firstborn from the
[1:07:33] dead in John 13:3 Jesus knowing that the
[1:07:37] father had given all things into his
[1:07:38] hands and that he was from come from he
[1:07:41] was come from God and went to God he
[1:07:44] knew all things had been given into his
[1:07:46] hands well this is the power the
[1:07:48] blessing the promise confered upon him
[1:07:50] he says in Matthew 28:18 and Jesus came
[1:07:52] and spake unto them saying all power is
[1:07:54] given unto me in heaven and in Earth
[1:07:57] yeah the what Adam lost in the fall
[1:08:00] Christ is now given
[1:08:03] again it has been conferred upon him it
[1:08:05] is conveyed to him everything that he
[1:08:07] was given Adam had he lost it was
[1:08:10] forfeited it went back to God but now
[1:08:13] Christ is proving that this power is
[1:08:15] resident in flesh
[1:08:19] again Philippians chapter 3:
[1:08:22] 21 I I I am in an unfortunate spot in
[1:08:26] how this just laid out this morning to
[1:08:29] where I can't just stop there I've got
[1:08:31] to just taken another step
[1:08:34] further and it says this in Philippians
[1:08:36] chapter 3: 21 because I want to nail
[1:08:38] this down this power to
[1:08:43] subdue Christ who's restored all the
[1:08:46] Adam
[1:08:47] lost he's the missing link from the
[1:08:50] garden this commandment have I received
[1:08:52] of my father to lay down my life power
[1:08:54] to take it up again the first begotten
[1:08:55] of of the Dead holding all those
[1:08:57] thoughts in your minds now I think it
[1:08:58] all has to fit together a word that
[1:09:00] would sweep them all the way from Eden
[1:09:02] to the Rapture the Rapture relates to
[1:09:05] this body the change of this body now
[1:09:08] Christ proved he had power to lay that
[1:09:11] body down and to take it up
[1:09:15] again and then it says in Philippians
[1:09:18] 3:21 who shall change our vile
[1:09:21] body that it may be fashioned like un
[1:09:24] his glorious body
[1:09:26] according to what according to the
[1:09:29] working whereby he is able even to
[1:09:32] subdue all things unto himself C did you
[1:09:37] catch that he's going to change our vile
[1:09:39] body into a glorified body by what power
[1:09:42] the glorification of our flesh is
[1:09:44] connected to his power to subdue all
[1:09:48] things all power is given to me in
[1:09:50] heaven and earth I've given all things
[1:09:52] are into my hands and in all things that
[1:09:54] he might have the preeminence and what
[1:09:55] did it result in he's the first begotten
[1:09:57] from the dead he's the first born from
[1:10:00] the dead he has conquered death and
[1:10:02] entered into immortality he has power to
[1:10:04] lay down his life he has power to take
[1:10:06] it up again and now he's expressing this
[1:10:09] that the very glorification of our body
[1:10:12] is connected with God giving him power
[1:10:15] to
[1:10:16] subdue Adam in the beginning was be
[1:10:18] fruitful multiply replenish the Earth
[1:10:20] and subdue the Earth subdue all things
[1:10:23] that means your body Adam but Adam lost
[1:10:26] the power to subdue the flesh but it was
[1:10:28] given back to Christ and now the power
[1:10:30] to subdue is being conveyed as a
[1:10:33] blessing upon mankind that this body
[1:10:35] shall be
[1:10:37] changed what is it Colossians 1:27
[1:10:40] Christ in you the hope of
[1:10:44] glory he will change our bodies into a
[1:10:46] glorified body by what power the
[1:10:48] glorification of your flesh the further
[1:10:51] glory to be revealed in you is connected
[1:10:54] with Christ's power to
[1:10:56] subdue that's why Jesus brother brandom
[1:10:58] could say he gave you a word to sweep
[1:11:00] you all the way from Eden to a Rapture
[1:11:03] in Genesis 1 128 notice these few
[1:11:06] statements I I have three of them on one
[1:11:07] slide so I could go through them very
[1:11:09] quickly here see I knew I needed to
[1:11:11] hurry have faith in God we have the
[1:11:13] Blessed assurance that someday these
[1:11:14] vile bodies will be changed and made
[1:11:16] like into his own glorious body whereby
[1:11:18] he's able to subdue all things unto
[1:11:20] himself brother just quoting the
[1:11:22] scripture what was the Holy Ghost given
[1:11:23] for the corruptible bodies of those that
[1:11:25] sleep in him shall be changed and made
[1:11:27] like into his own glorious body this is
[1:11:28] a glorified body a glorified body a
[1:11:31] glorified flesh that will never die
[1:11:32] never rot never age whereby he's able to
[1:11:35] subdue all things unto himself Jubilee
[1:11:38] year the corruptible bodies of those
[1:11:39] that asleep in him will be changed and
[1:11:41] made like into his own glorious body
[1:11:42] whereby he's able to subdue all things
[1:11:45] unto
[1:11:46] himself again it's just a quoting of
[1:11:48] Philippians 3:21 but the power to change
[1:11:50] this body from flesh to glorified flesh
[1:11:54] is connected with power to what
[1:11:56] subdue it's power to subdue the Earth
[1:12:00] just as we go back and think about that
[1:12:02] again to subdue Christ was given power
[1:12:04] to what to subdue to crush or to bruise
[1:12:07] the Serpent's head it means to tread
[1:12:09] under to dominate to put death under
[1:12:12] your
[1:12:14] feet to take the body and to subdue
[1:12:17] death to subdue it to where it's no
[1:12:18] longer subject to
[1:12:20] corruption Christ has power to dominate
[1:12:22] and tread down the effect of the serpent
[1:12:25] his power to dominate and tread down
[1:12:26] death he has power to subdue all things
[1:12:29] and the glorification of our body is
[1:12:31] connected with the commandment and the
[1:12:33] blessing to subdue the
[1:12:36] Earth in the message Queen of
[1:12:39] Sheba says Christianity is based upon
[1:12:42] not replacement reincarnation but
[1:12:45] Resurrection the same one went down come
[1:12:48] up
[1:12:50] but in the Splendor of
[1:12:53] immortality wo aren't you glad
[1:12:56] that there was there was some
[1:12:57] immortality withheld from
[1:13:00] Adam because God was saving
[1:13:03] it he wanted to deal with death first
[1:13:06] sin make himself known in imort being
[1:13:10] Immortal there would have been so many
[1:13:12] things God could not have expressed to
[1:13:15] to another Immortal we had to become
[1:13:17] mortal for this Splendor for the real
[1:13:19] glory of God to be made manifest but now
[1:13:21] that one that went down comes up in the
[1:13:23] Splendor of immortality made like un his
[1:13:25] own glorious body where he's able to
[1:13:27] subdue all things unto
[1:13:31] himself is this beautiful to you isn't
[1:13:34] it wonderful just to see how these
[1:13:36] things are laid out so clearly for us in
[1:13:38] the word of God to understand that God
[1:13:40] has given us power to bind the greatest
[1:13:44] am as it says in the message Countdown
[1:13:47] the hour will come when we I'll take
[1:13:50] this conjunction we will have to have
[1:13:52] Rapture power who will have to have it
[1:13:55] I will you will we will the hour come
[1:13:59] when we will have to have Rapture power
[1:14:00] not only to heal the body but to change
[1:14:02] it in a moment who will have the power
[1:14:05] you will have it you will have power to
[1:14:07] subdue to do what to subdue this body
[1:14:10] and change it from a mortal body to an
[1:14:13] immortal body to take the very elements
[1:14:15] and atoms of this body which are which
[1:14:18] are ingrained and swn with death you're
[1:14:20] going to have power to change yourself
[1:14:22] in your atoms
[1:14:26] very very Changed by the power to subdue
[1:14:29] why you've been given power over it as a
[1:14:32] God to take the atoms and align them
[1:14:34] back upright to where they will not
[1:14:37] die the very power of glorification
[1:14:39] resides within us we'll have power to
[1:14:41] Rapture we'll have Rapture power to
[1:14:43] change the body in a twinklet of an eye
[1:14:46] Christ will be so real into their bodies
[1:14:48] till he can change it by his great death
[1:14:50] and what he
[1:14:53] purchased will have Rapture power you
[1:14:56] have Rapture power what is it power to
[1:14:58] subdue power to change this flesh from
[1:15:01] Mortal to immortality power to swallow
[1:15:03] up death into
[1:15:05] life because the Bible says in Romans
[1:15:14] 16:20 and the God of Peace shall bruise
[1:15:16] Satan under your feet
[1:15:19] shortly we've been reading that several
[1:15:22] times already in these first few months
[1:15:28] Satan the flesh
[1:15:30] eater you're going to crush his head why
[1:15:34] you've been given power to
[1:15:42] subdue I'm gonna
[1:15:46] skip I'm just GNA skip a scripture
[1:15:49] reading where the Bible says well let's
[1:15:51] just read it quickly Romans 8:1 19-22
[1:15:55] for the earnest expectation of the
[1:15:56] creature waited for the manifestation of
[1:15:58] the sons of
[1:15:59] God for the creature was made subject to
[1:16:02] vanity not willingly but by reason of
[1:16:04] him who hath subjected the same in
[1:16:08] Hope remember the Earth's purpose was
[1:16:10] left
[1:16:12] unsatisfied from the very moment that
[1:16:14] mankind fell creation has been
[1:16:17] groaning waiting for all the promise the
[1:16:21] potential and power that Adam
[1:16:23] represented they sensed it they
[1:16:27] experienced it in Genesis chapter 2 when
[1:16:29] Adam walked among them and named them
[1:16:31] and empowered them and gave them purpose
[1:16:33] and was placing them the naming of
[1:16:35] something is placing them in their
[1:16:36] position and here's Adam placing animal
[1:16:39] life and Creation in their position
[1:16:41] giving them meaning giving them purpose
[1:16:43] and now all this potential that was
[1:16:45] being expressed and then the woman comes
[1:16:47] out from man and all the creation is
[1:16:48] witnessing isn't this beautiful isn't
[1:16:50] this amazing now there's something left
[1:16:53] groaning and the Earth is left pregant
[1:16:55] longing for
[1:16:57] something but they're made subject in
[1:16:59] Hope because the creature itself also
[1:17:02] shall be delivered from the bondage of
[1:17:04] corruption into the Glorious Liberty of
[1:17:07] the children of God for we know that the
[1:17:10] whole creation granth and travaileth in
[1:17:13] pain together until
[1:17:17] now what are they longing for the
[1:17:19] manifestation of the sons of God even a
[1:17:23] manifestation that was not fully made
[1:17:25] manifest in Adam but was made manifest
[1:17:28] in
[1:17:29] Christ all creation travails we said it
[1:17:32] last time not because of sin and not
[1:17:35] because man sinned but it travails and
[1:17:38] groans for Redemption because Redemption
[1:17:40] is what all creation was made
[1:17:42] for brother Braham says in the message
[1:17:45] unfailing realities of the Living God
[1:17:47] and when God made man in his own image
[1:17:49] he put him on the earth as a Lesser God
[1:17:52] Jesus declared it when he said is it not
[1:17:54] written in your law that you're gods and
[1:17:56] if they called those Gods who the word
[1:17:57] of God come to which was the prophets
[1:18:00] how can you condemn me when I say I'm
[1:18:02] the Son of God he said see they just
[1:18:06] couldn't understand it but man was put
[1:18:10] here with a dominion over the Earth he
[1:18:12] had everything under his
[1:18:14] control Adam lost Jesus proved that he
[1:18:17] had restored he stopped nature he raised
[1:18:20] the dead he done
[1:18:22] everything now if you could I I've been
[1:18:25] trending to this and I just can't seem
[1:18:27] to get there just start thinking about
[1:18:29] all those instances of the third
[1:18:31] pool it relates to all things it relates
[1:18:34] to Creation it relates to the original
[1:18:37] commission he done everything and all
[1:18:39] the world is growing today the Bible
[1:18:41] said for the manifestations of the sons
[1:18:44] of God for God to get into his children
[1:18:46] again in reality to make things
[1:18:49] real to bring it back to the reality of
[1:18:52] Genesis 120 to bring it back to the full
[1:18:54] realization of what God wanted to do to
[1:18:56] do in the beginning and it stumbles the
[1:18:58] people he
[1:18:59] says the the concept of salvation oh I'm
[1:19:02] a sinner oh I'm depraved and I'm
[1:19:04] strained from God and adopt me as your
[1:19:06] child and make this orphan you know one
[1:19:08] that could sit at your table that
[1:19:10] doesn't stumble people but the fact that
[1:19:12] God desired to make man
[1:19:15] God that's what stumbles
[1:19:17] people for God to get into his children
[1:19:20] and to become flesh in his bride and to
[1:19:23] make things real and the reality of God
[1:19:26] to be lived out in the flesh of his
[1:19:27] people that's what stumbles the
[1:19:30] people and not only does creation grown
[1:19:33] and creation cry out longing for the
[1:19:35] manifestations of sons but we ourselves
[1:19:37] verse 23 and not only they but ourselves
[1:19:39] also which have the first fruits of the
[1:19:41] spirit even we ourselves grown within
[1:19:43] ourselves waiting for the adoption to it
[1:19:45] the Redemption of our body Why without
[1:19:50] that there's not the glorification
[1:19:52] there's not the subduing there's not the
[1:19:53] full man estation of what all creation
[1:19:56] was Longing To See in the
[1:19:58] beginning the body that came from Earth
[1:20:01] must be
[1:20:03] subdued it's not enough that it would be
[1:20:05] healed it's not enough that it would
[1:20:07] even be raised from the dead to die
[1:20:09] again but it must be changed to the
[1:20:11] original Glory that God contemplated it
[1:20:13] must be changed into the same glorious
[1:20:15] body that Jesus Christ has that's right
[1:20:18] that's what we're living
[1:20:20] for we're not living for a funeral
[1:20:26] one day we're going to have the last
[1:20:31] one one day the last bride member is
[1:20:34] going to lay in a
[1:20:36] coffin why because it's a promise of God
[1:20:38] that will not fail death will be
[1:20:41] swallowed up of life
[1:20:43] amen in the message conflict between God
[1:20:46] and Satan I'm just not going to be able
[1:20:48] to
[1:20:49] finish and and I know it won't stumble
[1:20:52] any of you to have to just pick back up
[1:20:54] on some of
[1:20:56] this I want to read that statement again
[1:20:58] but God at the beginning gave his
[1:20:59] children the atomic weapon because he's
[1:21:02] the infinite God now seeing there's
[1:21:05] going to be a conflict and there's going
[1:21:06] to be a battle God equipped his children
[1:21:08] with the right kind of ammunition right
[1:21:10] kind of attack the right kind of
[1:21:12] everything that they would need had need
[1:21:14] of that would sweep them all the way
[1:21:17] from Eden to the Rapture can you see
[1:21:20] that a little bit better now what was it
[1:21:22] the word the word that's what defeats
[1:21:25] Satan is the word it will defeat him
[1:21:29] anywhere any
[1:21:30] place now why do we want to substitute
[1:21:33] something else when we've already got
[1:21:35] the best thing that there is the word
[1:21:38] and we find Jesus on Earth just to prove
[1:21:41] this was the best equipment when Satan
[1:21:43] came in hand toand combat with Jesus he
[1:21:46] never reached over with this power and
[1:21:48] tied his hands he just took the same
[1:21:50] weapon that God gave in the Garden of
[1:21:53] Eden his word and said it is written
[1:21:57] it's written and he punched him right
[1:21:59] out of the ring with it that's right
[1:22:01] because it's God's best and do you
[1:22:03] realize what brother brandham said has
[1:22:05] been restored back to you the word the
[1:22:09] word has been restored back to you
[1:22:11] listen that's what must have the
[1:22:13] preeminence that must be what we're
[1:22:15] connected to and tied to above even
[1:22:19] certain gifts and certain manifestations
[1:22:21] and certain charism and outpourings and
[1:22:23] things that can move Upon Our flesh
[1:22:25] those things are wonderful the gifts of
[1:22:26] the Spirit are in the word these certain
[1:22:28] powers of Prophecy and speaking in
[1:22:30] tongues they're lovely and God
[1:22:32] communicates to us through those things
[1:22:33] but listen let the word have
[1:22:39] preeminence that's the
[1:22:42] best it's the word that'll bring the
[1:22:46] results brother brandham says in future
[1:22:48] home and I I had a few more statements
[1:22:51] and some more things I wanted to amplify
[1:22:53] in it but we'll just stop
[1:22:56] here he says Adam was to multiply and
[1:22:59] replenish the Earth Noah was after the
[1:23:01] new world was destroyed was to multiply
[1:23:03] and replenish the Earth can't you see
[1:23:05] what the serpent seed is what
[1:23:08] replenished the Earth you get it you see
[1:23:11] how Satan got to Eve that's why death
[1:23:14] has reigned on Earth ever
[1:23:16] since and Heavens Earth Beast atmosphere
[1:23:21] is all cursed of God because of it
[1:23:23] that's the curs because Satan got to
[1:23:25] this
[1:23:26] first Jesus came to redeem it back to
[1:23:30] the
[1:23:31] father in order to do this he became
[1:23:34] part of it and from that very dust the
[1:23:38] part Jesus was himself being redeemed
[1:23:41] through him all of the attributes of God
[1:23:46] are redeemed with the
[1:23:48] Earth is redemption beautiful all the
[1:23:52] attributes of God do you know you know
[1:23:54] that's who you are all the attributes of
[1:23:57] God are redeemed with the Earth and he
[1:24:00] teaches how God redeems the person is
[1:24:03] the same way he redeems the
[1:24:05] Earth listen Saints we are ordained to
[1:24:09] satisfy and subdue the
[1:24:10] Earth this word this word has been
[1:24:14] committed unto you why you are a
[1:24:16] redeemed attribute of God through Christ
[1:24:20] through the even the Redemption of the
[1:24:21] very dust of the Earth power has been
[1:24:24] given to you to subdue as an attribute
[1:24:27] of
[1:24:28] God therefore I believe we could take
[1:24:30] the word which is the best weapon the
[1:24:33] best equipment and we can fight the
[1:24:35] Devil With It Whatever you have need of
[1:24:37] you can use this word to do it we have
[1:24:39] been given power this Earth this body
[1:24:42] which came from this Earth it must be
[1:24:46] subdued God bless you let's stand to our
[1:24:49] feet this this morning we just eak in in
[1:24:52] the morning we got finished
[1:24:55] before
[1:25:01] noon I don't have
[1:25:04] much breath or energy to worship I trust
[1:25:07] it wouldn't be an offense if we just cut
[1:25:09] it
[1:25:10] short but let's worship Him in song Let
[1:25:14] the weak say I am
[1:25:16] strong let the poor say I am rich
[1:25:24] I want to ask you today and I want you
[1:25:27] to raise a
[1:25:30] hand do you know that God is with
[1:25:34] you you know that he loves
[1:25:37] you he's promised to never leave you nor
[1:25:39] forsake
[1:25:40] you we have urgent needs within our body
[1:25:43] sister Ruth Korea's dad is in the
[1:25:46] hospital struggling with severe covid
[1:25:48] symptoms whether Albert Morales is at
[1:25:51] home a very strong man very able capable
[1:25:54] man is struggling with
[1:25:58] sickness others in our church suffering
[1:26:01] from different maladies and different
[1:26:02] afflictions I have no doubt that a word
[1:26:06] has been committed to us that we could
[1:26:09] take and use against any
[1:26:12] sickness if we've been given power to
[1:26:15] subdue the Earth that means any sickness
[1:26:18] resident in your flesh is subject to the
[1:26:21] power to
[1:26:22] subdue that's even what Divine Healing
[1:26:25] it represents Divine Healing is just a
[1:26:27] token it's just a a signification of
[1:26:29] power over death why because that would
[1:26:32] be the greatest that's the most
[1:26:33] wonderful power there could be is the
[1:26:35] power to lay down your life and take it
[1:26:37] right back up again if there's power
[1:26:39] over death there is no power over you
[1:26:42] therefore let us stand confident in the
[1:26:44] grace that God has given us as the elect
[1:26:46] stand for loved ones stand for those who
[1:26:48] have needs today and as we pray let's
