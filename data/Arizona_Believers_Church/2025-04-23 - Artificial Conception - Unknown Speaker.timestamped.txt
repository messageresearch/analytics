[0:00] 1 Corinthians chapter 2, we'll start
[0:02] with verse six. This is speaking about
[0:03] the wisdom of God. And that's kind of
[0:06] all-encompassing about the the mind of
[0:08] God is really some things that we're
[0:09] looking at. But it says, "How be it we
[0:11] speak wisdom among them that are
[0:13] perfect, yet not the wisdom of this
[0:15] world, nor the princes of this world
[0:17] that come to not." So there's your
[0:19] difference between carnal wisdom, human
[0:21] wisdom, and the wisdom of God. But we
[0:23] speak the wisdom of God in a mystery,
[0:26] even the hidden wisdom which God
[0:27] ordained before the world unto our
[0:29] glory, which none of the princes of this
[0:31] world knew. For had they known it, they
[0:33] would not have crucified the Lord of
[0:35] glory. But as it is written, I hath not
[0:37] seen nor ear heard, neither have entered
[0:40] into the heart of men, the things which
[0:42] God hath prepared for them that love
[0:44] him. But God hath revealed them unto us
[0:46] by his spirit. For the Spirit searchth
[0:49] all things, yay, the deep things of God.
[0:52] I was hoping to get to this verse
[0:53] tonight, but I don't think I'm going to
[0:55] be able to get to it. So, maybe build
[0:57] some anticipation for Sunday. But the
[0:59] Spirit searches all things, yay, the
[1:01] deep things of God, and reveals to us
[1:03] those things in verse nine. For what man
[1:06] knoweth the things of a man, save the
[1:07] spirit of man which is in him, even so
[1:09] the things of God, which knoweth no man,
[1:11] but the spirit of God. Now we have
[1:14] received not the spirit of the world,
[1:16] but the spirit which is of God, that we
[1:17] might know the things that are freely
[1:19] given to us of God, which things also we
[1:22] speak, not the words which man's wisdom
[1:24] teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost
[1:26] teacheth, comparing spiritual things
[1:27] with spiritual. But the natural man
[1:30] receiveth not the things of the spirit
[1:32] of God, for they are foolishness unto
[1:34] him, neither can he know them, because
[1:36] they are spiritually discerned. But he
[1:39] that is spiritual judgeth all things,
[1:40] yet he himself is judged of no man. For
[1:44] who hath known the mind of the Lord,
[1:45] that he may instruct him? But we have
[1:48] the mind of Christ. My so powerful. May
[1:52] God just bless these things which we've
[1:54] read. You can be
[1:56] seated. My title tonight is artificial
[2:00] conception. Artificial conception. And
[2:03] I'm being very deliberate in the use of
[2:04] this term conception. Uh as I've been
[2:07] looking at the concept of artificial
[2:09] things that are artificial. We know that
[2:11] artificial just refers to something that
[2:13] is made by man. So it's something that's
[2:16] not occurring naturally. Or we could say
[2:18] it's not something that God has made,
[2:20] but it's something contrived, built, or
[2:22] created through human skill or human
[2:24] labor. As the word artificial itself is
[2:27] art and maker, there's something that's
[2:29] been made and produced. Anything that is
[2:31] a substitute for something that is real
[2:34] or natural or original that would be
[2:36] called artificial like artificial
[2:38] sweetener uh artificial teeth things of
[2:40] that nature that the idea of something
[2:42] being artificial. Now on this conception
[2:47] conception is the act of conceiving. So
[2:50] we could uh define conceiving a little
[2:53] bit but conception is for referring to
[2:55] comprehension. Uh the power of
[2:57] conceiving in the mind or a word that we
[3:00] could use in this way is intelligence.
[3:03] That faculty of the mind that is
[3:04] necessary to understand what is real uh
[3:07] and what is true. So we say artificial
[3:10] conception uh we're looking at something
[3:12] that is just merely man-made. As we see
[3:14] the wisdom of this world and the mind of
[3:17] man is being contrasted with the wisdom
[3:19] of God. In Romans 11:es 33 and 34 it
[3:24] says, "Oh the depth of the riches both
[3:26] of the wisdom and knowledge of God. How
[3:30] unsearchable are his judgments and his
[3:33] ways pass finding out. For who hath
[3:36] known the mind of the Lord that he may
[3:40] who hath known the mind of the Lord? or
[3:42] who hath been his counselor. So there's
[3:45] wisdom and knowledge that are presented
[3:47] here. There's such depth to them that
[3:48] they cannot be fully exhausted and
[3:51] explored. And then it says that who hath
[3:54] known the mind? That word there is noose
[3:56] and that's the Greek word for
[3:59] intelligence. And there's a lot of
[4:00] different principles to this that we
[4:02] could get into, but this is the
[4:04] intelligence of God. And we're looking
[4:07] at God's ability to judge and discern. I
[4:10] know maybe seem odd to say his ability,
[4:12] but God's faculty, his characteristic of
[4:15] judgment and his discernment. We're
[4:17] looking at the mind of God. Brother
[4:19] Brandham said in the sermon,
[4:20] perseverant. And when God ever makes a
[4:22] decision, it has to ever remain that
[4:24] way. He cannot
[4:26] change. He cannot get smarter. So think
[4:29] of that. God cannot get smarter. He's
[4:32] not He's not learning. He's not gaining
[4:34] new information day after day. He is the
[4:36] source of all intelligence. No matter
[4:39] what our science says, and I love this.
[4:41] He says, "If it's against the
[4:43] intelligence or the word of God, it's
[4:45] contrary." So this there's kind of a a
[4:47] joining together. God's intelligence is
[4:49] expressed or embodied in his word. If
[4:51] it's against the intelligence or the
[4:54] word of God, it's contrary. It's not
[4:56] right. I don't care how scientific it
[4:58] can be proved. It's still wrong. So if
[5:01] something that can be scientifically
[5:03] proved is used to support something or
[5:06] an idea or belief that's contrary to the
[5:09] word, they're wrong. Maybe not
[5:11] factually, maybe not scientifically, but
[5:13] in the way that they're trying to
[5:14] interpret the data or use it, they are
[5:16] wrong because God cannot God is the
[5:19] source of all
[5:21] intelligence. Now, in Romans 12:2, it
[5:24] says, "And be not conformed to this
[5:26] world." You probably recall that we've
[5:28] used this quite a bit as of late. And
[5:31] and some of you thinking as of late? You
[5:32] mean the last five years. And be not
[5:34] conformed to this world, but be
[5:36] transformed by the renewing, this making
[5:39] new of your mind, that ye may prove what
[5:42] is that good and acceptable and perfect
[5:44] will of God. So, we are to have our
[5:47] minds transformed. There's this renewing
[5:49] of our mind. This transforming by the
[5:51] renewing of our mind. And then we're
[5:53] going to prove what is good and
[5:55] acceptable and the perfect will of God.
[5:58] This is a transformation of the mind. So
[6:00] it's a transformation of our
[6:02] intelligence, our faculty of
[6:04] understanding, the way that we
[6:05] comprehend right or wrong. The way that
[6:07] we understand what is real and true. And
[6:10] this good, acceptable, and perfect
[6:13] relates to the proper intelligence.
[6:15] There's a lot of different branches that
[6:16] come of science and academics that come
[6:18] up with their own idea whether it be
[6:21] metaphysical or philosophical these
[6:22] ideas of intelligence and and there is a
[6:26] way of defining it to where that which
[6:28] is prudent that which is reasonable
[6:29] that's something that is intelligent.
[6:31] Somebody does something that we say was
[6:33] well well that wasn't very smart right
[6:35] we say that's not very intelligent their
[6:37] act or their deed. So what is good, what
[6:39] is proper, what is acceptable and
[6:41] perfect relates to an
[6:43] intelligence. So we are to have our
[6:46] minds renewed in Ephesians 4:23. And be
[6:48] renewed in the spirit of your mind.
[6:50] We're upgrading our intelligence. It's a
[6:53] making new of the way we think and the
[6:56] way that we respond to things, the way
[6:57] that we act, the way that we judge, the
[6:59] way that we perceive. So God is in his
[7:02] mind, his intelligence, the source of
[7:04] all intelligence. It's not one that gets
[7:06] smarter. Uh and in this mind of God,
[7:10] it's saying that we are to have our
[7:11] minds renewed, which is part of our
[7:13] transformation to do the perfect will of
[7:16] God. Uh to make this making new of our
[7:18] mind. And then in 1 Corinthians 1:10, he
[7:22] says, "Now I beseech you, brethren, by
[7:24] the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that
[7:26] you all speak the same thing." Now come
[7:30] on, this is interesting. that we all
[7:33] speak the same thing, that there be no
[7:36] divisions among you. This is quite a
[7:39] quite a challenge. We should be speaking
[7:40] the same thing. There should be no uh
[7:42] divisions among us, but that you be
[7:44] perfectly joined together in the same
[7:47] mind and in the same judgment. So, we
[7:51] should be perfectly joined together in
[7:52] the same intelligence and in the same
[7:54] discernment or judgment. Now, how are we
[7:57] going to do that if it's not through
[7:59] some supernatural means or in an
[8:02] intelligence that's vastly different
[8:04] than human
[8:05] intelligence? Many of us might find
[8:07] themselves in the same position I find
[8:09] myself quite often is I am clearly not
[8:11] the smartest man in the room. And
[8:13] there's people that are smarter than us,
[8:15] more intelligent, more gifted and more
[8:17] more talented. And we realize that maybe
[8:20] no matter how much we would study, no
[8:21] matter how much we try and books we'd
[8:23] read, podcasts we would binge on, we're
[8:25] never going to be as intelligent as that
[8:28] person. But yet God saying that we
[8:30] spiritually are to be perfectly joined
[8:32] together and made complete in the same
[8:34] mind and same judgment means it's
[8:37] something that he is going to do beyond
[8:39] nature according to his spirit. And it's
[8:42] something that we should be praying for
[8:44] and desire to see happen in our hearts
[8:46] and in our lives. So we see in these few
[8:50] scriptures that there is a mind or
[8:51] intelligence of God and then there's a
[8:54] work of the Holy Spirit that's renewing
[8:56] our minds that's not teaching us new
[8:58] things academically that we're not
[9:00] comprehending with the human mind but
[9:02] it's this cultivation of the spiritual
[9:04] mind of Christ the intelligence of God
[9:07] inside of us. In 2 Corinthians
[9:11] 11:3, Paul writes, "But I fear lest by
[9:14] any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve
[9:17] through his subtlety, so your mind
[9:19] should be corrupted from the simplicity
[9:22] that is in Christ." I I enjoy revisiting
[9:25] the same scripture over and over again,
[9:27] even ministering on it, and realizing
[9:29] that every single time I do, there's a
[9:31] different layer, shade, approach, or way
[9:33] that we can zero in on a truth of that
[9:37] um that just expands our understanding
[9:39] of the word of God. So, as the serpent
[9:42] beguiled Eve, Paul quickly looks at the
[9:44] mind. He says that I fear that your
[9:48] minds would be corrupted from the
[9:50] simplicity that is in Christ. The
[9:53] serpent swed that seed into the mind of
[9:55] the woman. It happened first in her
[9:57] mind. And that's where we can look at
[9:59] conception as more than just a uh it is
[10:03] an act of conceiving or comprehension.
[10:06] But now it also carries that dual
[10:08] meaning of the act of conceiving in the
[10:11] womb in a similar way that the mind then
[10:14] as a womb conceives.
[10:17] We conceive things. And there's this
[10:18] conception. Oh, do you get that concept
[10:20] there? There's been something that's
[10:22] been conceived in the mind. James 1:15
[10:26] puts it this way. Then when lust hath
[10:28] conceived, it bringeth forth sin. And
[10:31] sin when it is finished bringeth forth
[10:33] death. So there's this act of something,
[10:35] a conception and receiving something in
[10:38] the womb of the mind. So it's this act
[10:41] of receiving seed and then going through
[10:43] the process that produces and brings
[10:46] forth fruit. Right. Romans chapter 16
[10:50] verse 18. And I'm so glad that you're
[10:53] paying attention. I just I feel really
[10:54] good in ministering this. It's a a small
[10:57] simple thought tonight that I think will
[10:58] be a great blessing to us if we just can
[11:01] um ask the Lord to open these things up
[11:03] to us and not just learn them, but
[11:05] really catch them by revelation. Romans
[11:08] chapter 16 18 it says, "For they that
[11:11] are such serve not our Lord Jesus
[11:13] Christ, but their own belly." And we're
[11:16] all getting a complex. As much as we
[11:18] love food around here, uh they don't
[11:20] serve God, but they serve their own
[11:22] belly and by good words and fair
[11:24] speeches deceive the hearts of the
[11:27] simple. There's so much in here. As I
[11:29] even put in this slide, they beguile
[11:31] trusting minds. Uh they're not
[11:33] suspicious of anyone. They they're not
[11:36] uh distrusting of anyone. And so they're
[11:38] prayed upon by these that selfishly are
[11:41] serving their own intellect. And this
[11:44] word, but they serve their own belly.
[11:46] It's the same word that's translated to
[11:49] womb in many other places in the New
[11:51] Testament. So they serve their own belly
[11:53] or womb. And it's a reference here to
[11:55] their mind. That place of thought or
[11:58] feeling, that place of choice. And when
[12:01] we think about the world today and what
[12:04] drives society, it's their appetite.
[12:08] They serve their own belly. And it's not
[12:11] just in what they eat, but it's in what
[12:13] they want to consume. And it's what they
[12:15] want to be close to and and and
[12:18] participate in. And there's this desire,
[12:20] this drive and this hunger that is
[12:22] insatiable in this hour. And we can
[12:24] realize that they are those that serve
[12:28] their own
[12:29] belly. And in this way, there's good
[12:32] words and fair speeches that are going
[12:34] to prey upon trusting minds to cause
[12:38] this conception of the same things in
[12:41] the womb of the
[12:42] mind. Philippians 3:1 19 touches on it
[12:45] this way. Whose end is destruction,
[12:48] whose god is their belly and whose glory
[12:51] is in their shame, who mind earthly
[12:54] things. This word shame, there's
[12:57] confusion. uh they're they're it's their
[12:59] they're confounded and they actually
[13:01] glory in their confusion. They glory in
[13:04] their confoundment and there is a a
[13:07] stuper is what it's referred to. We
[13:09] could say that it is their confound.
[13:11] It's this stuper. It's this lack of
[13:13] intelligence and their god is their
[13:15] belly. Their glory is in their shame and
[13:18] they mind earthly mind earthly things.
[13:22] That's what they're looking for. That's
[13:23] what they desire. That's what they
[13:25] seek. And it's not natural appetite.
[13:29] It's the mind. It's the spirit that
[13:31] they're
[13:33] serving. Brother Brandham, the sermon
[13:35] leadership, and this is one if you want
[13:37] to go and listen
[13:39] to I it's just I find my as I was
[13:42] studying it, I found that listening to
[13:44] it actually kind of put all the pieces
[13:45] together for me. But he says, "God has
[13:48] taken 6,000 year it's taken you 6,000
[13:50] years according to the Bible to build in
[13:52] Eden. You put your son and his wife in
[13:55] there, his bride to rule over it. And
[13:57] Satan come around and perverted it. He's
[14:00] got 6,000 years and he's built his own,
[14:02] he says, intellectual Eden through
[14:05] science and education. And he uses this
[14:07] phrase socalled intelligence and he's
[14:10] built it into a mess of death.
[14:14] So what we have today in terms of our
[14:16] minds and our understanding or our
[14:18] wisdom and knowledge it is a socalled
[14:21] intelligence because there can be a
[14:23] scientific process that produces a
[14:25] result and that result in scientifically
[14:28] irrefutable is now used to try to
[14:30] overthrow the intelligence and the mind
[14:33] of God. And this so-called intelligence
[14:36] is a perversion of true intelligence. If
[14:39] I can say it's a artificial intelligence
[14:41] by a a hybrid conception that goes back
[14:44] to first 2 Corinthians 11 through this
[14:47] beguiling that Satan has produced a
[14:50] so-called intelligence and he's built an
[14:53] intellectual
[14:55] Eden. In Romans chapter
[14:59] 8:7, this will highlight again this
[15:03] carnal mind that we now all have because
[15:06] we don't come direct from God. Uh we're
[15:08] not we do not have the same state as
[15:12] Adam and the woman had in the beginning
[15:13] with no channels clogged up and
[15:15] everything being perfect. And so by the
[15:17] process of regeneration and being born
[15:20] or the just the a procreation being born
[15:22] over ages and ages we've developed these
[15:26] minds that are fallen minds described
[15:29] this way because the carnal mind is
[15:31] enmity. It's against God. It's has hate
[15:34] against God. It it it's not joined with
[15:36] God and harmonious with God. It thinks
[15:38] differently than God. It's instinctively
[15:41] different than God. The carnal mind is
[15:43] immity against God. For it is not
[15:45] subject to the law of God, neither
[15:48] indeed can be. So this human
[15:50] intelligence that we all have is against
[15:53] or contrary to God's intelligence. Human
[15:56] mind is at odds with divine
[15:58] intelligence. It is not subject to the
[16:01] law of God. That that's something that
[16:04] is a process. It a computation. It's
[16:07] something that exists in reality and
[16:09] that is real. uh it's just naturally
[16:11] doesn't operate instinctively by the
[16:14] laws of God. So there is an intelligence
[16:16] I say that's carnal that's man-made uh
[16:19] it's it's an artificial conception that
[16:21] we may have but then there's this divine
[16:25] intelligence and intelligence even in
[16:27] this way as I think about it in terms of
[16:29] God's intelligence but even naturally
[16:31] intelligence is different from
[16:33] learning God himself is all knowing he
[16:36] never has a new thought he's not getting
[16:38] smarter and he does not gain new
[16:40] information on the daily basis as Psalms
[16:42] 147:5 says great is our Lord Lord and of
[16:45] great power. His understanding is
[16:48] infinite. He's omnisient. He knows all
[16:50] things. God is we're not going to have
[16:53] in our time five days go by and say God
[16:57] what did God learn in these five days?
[16:59] And what has God gained? What kind of
[17:00] perspective has he gained? It's this we
[17:03] can barely we can barely begin to even
[17:05] comprehend a scoch of what it means for
[17:08] him to be omnisient. But God, his
[17:10] understanding is infinite. And learning,
[17:14] so God's not learning. And learning is
[17:17] the act of retaining information or even
[17:19] retaining certain processes in order to
[17:21] recall them for future use. And then
[17:24] learning how to do something, learning
[17:25] how to tie a fishing knot or learning
[17:27] how to adjust your rearview mirror or,
[17:30] you know, back down a trailer. Different
[17:31] things you learn. And if you learn it,
[17:34] you you've gathered this information.
[17:35] and you've gained a process that you
[17:37] want to recall to use later.
[17:40] But in 2 Timothy
[17:42] 3:es 5
[17:44] to8, it says there there's something
[17:47] about learning that isn't
[17:49] exactly this process of the renewing of
[17:52] the
[17:53] mind. Says in these last days of those
[17:56] that will be upon the earth having a
[17:58] form of godliness but denying the power
[18:00] thereof. There's something that maybe by
[18:03] image looks to be godly, but yet they
[18:06] deny the power of revelation is power of
[18:08] transformation. Says, from such turn
[18:10] away, for of this sort they which creep
[18:12] into houses and lead captive silly women
[18:15] laden with sins, led away with diverse
[18:17] lust. That is quite a mouthful, but it
[18:20] speaks of those whose God is their
[18:21] belly, who by good words and fair
[18:23] speeches are going to deceive the hearts
[18:25] of the simple. Here there's th there are
[18:28] they that capitalize on the sincerity of
[18:31] people who want to serve God who want to
[18:34] do right maybe burdened by their sins
[18:36] and they take advantage of them in their
[18:38] situation their brokenness sometimes
[18:40] they make them feel broken so they could
[18:42] take advantage of them and then it says
[18:44] this ever
[18:45] learning a continual process of learning
[18:48] ever learning ever this act of retaining
[18:51] information this act of learning certain
[18:53] things and being able to recall them and
[18:55] never able able to come to the knowledge
[18:58] of the truth.
[19:00] You can learn a lot of things but never
[19:02] come to the knowledge of the truth. Ever
[19:06] learning but not gaining or
[19:08] comprehending or conceiving truth. And
[19:10] he says, "Now as Janice and Jambers
[19:12] withstood Moses, so do these also resist
[19:14] the truth. Men of corrupt minds
[19:16] reprobate concerning the faith."
[19:19] Truth is resisted through impersonation.
[19:23] There there is a a learning of a
[19:25] process, a learning of something
[19:26] characteristics and Janice and Jambers
[19:28] saw something done and they impersonated
[19:30] it and that's how the truth is resisted
[19:33] because the truth is not being
[19:35] apprehended or grasped. Um they're
[19:37] learning but they're never coming to the
[19:39] knowledge of the truth but yet resist it
[19:41] through some sort of mimic or
[19:43] impersonation. As we'd mentioned Sunday,
[19:45] it's a performative art. It's all stage
[19:47] it. It's all on the stage. It's all on
[19:49] the platform. It's for show. And we
[19:52] don't want to we don't want to be caught
[19:54] up in that kind of Hollywood
[19:55] Christianity.
[19:57] But
[19:58] intelligence is actually good
[20:01] judgment. Intelligence is this. It's
[20:03] something that's practical. It's
[20:05] adaptive. It's actual is ever learning
[20:08] and never coming to the knowledge of the
[20:09] truth. And intelligence is actual
[20:10] knowledge of truth.
[20:13] And when one as I've been studying
[20:15] different branches uh maybe ways of
[20:18] viewing intelligence there's uh there's
[20:20] a way of looking at intelligence to
[20:22] where it it's not only proactive or
[20:25] forwardlooking but it's something that
[20:27] in get in a given situation it can adapt
[20:30] to those
[20:31] circumstances a a and make the best
[20:34] prediction. And what there's a
[20:36] mathematical formula in that there that
[20:38] intelligence is a force that acts in a
[20:40] way to preserve itself because it never
[20:43] wants to be trapped. It always wants to
[20:45] know a way out. It always wants to know
[20:47] what's next and how to navigate a
[20:49] particular situation. And now man may
[20:51] dream to have some sort of perfect
[20:53] intelligence. But that's God. He's not
[20:55] trapped into anything.
[20:58] Intelligence is sound. It's uh stable.
[21:02] And as we read in 1 Corinthians chapter
[21:05] 2:14, it says, "But the natural man, as
[21:08] there is a mind of God, which is not
[21:11] carnal, and that uh we having received
[21:14] the spirit which is of God, we're we're
[21:17] not just merely thinking with the
[21:19] natural mind." And it says the natural
[21:20] man or the man that only has his natural
[21:22] thinking cannot receive the things of
[21:24] the spirit of God, for they are
[21:26] foolishness unto him. So the natural
[21:30] mind from its vantage point sees the
[21:33] things of God as
[21:35] foolishness. Neither can the natural man
[21:38] know the things of the spirit of God
[21:40] because they are spiritually discerned.
[21:44] The natural mind cannot conceive God's
[21:46] thoughts, cannot conceive spiritual
[21:48] things. It it may observe spiritual
[21:50] happenings. It may on some surface learn
[21:53] a precept or a principle, be able to
[21:55] learn the Bible and say, "Well, the
[21:57] fruits of the spirit are these." But in
[21:58] terms of a real uh uh practical
[22:01] intelligence and a comprehension of
[22:02] truth, the natural mind cannot do that.
[22:05] Again, because it intelligence is good
[22:07] judgment. And here the natural man
[22:10] believes the things of the spirit of God
[22:11] are foolishness.
[22:13] So if if if intelligence is good
[22:16] judgment, it's practical, it's adaptive,
[22:19] and it's sound, and it would see the
[22:21] things of the spirits of God, the the
[22:23] things of God as foolishness or
[22:25] stupidity, then the natural mind is
[22:28] exactly
[22:29] that, the opposite of intelligence, and
[22:32] I use this word uh not harshly or not in
[22:35] a
[22:36] uh in a in a way to u kind of like
[22:40] slang, but the opposite of intelligence
[22:42] is stupidity.
[22:45] It's foolishness. It means to be without
[22:46] understanding.
[22:50] So there's a there's something
[22:51] practical,
[22:53] reasonable about the mind of God and his
[22:56] intelligence that the natural man when
[22:58] he sees this, oh that's foolishness.
[23:00] Why? Because the great things of God and
[23:01] the eyes of man are small and the things
[23:03] that man thinks so great, God looks at
[23:05] him and says that's foolishness.
[23:08] In Isaiah 55
[23:10] 6-11, he says, "Seek ye the Lord while
[23:13] he may be
[23:14] found. Call ye upon him while he is
[23:17] near." There's a a theme in this that
[23:21] I'd like to pick up on maybe Sunday on
[23:24] seeking the Lord, seeking him. It says,
[23:28] "Let the wicked forsake his way and the
[23:30] unrighteous man his thoughts, and let
[23:33] him return unto the Lord, and he will
[23:36] have mercy upon him and to our God, for
[23:38] he will abundantly pardon and to our
[23:41] God, for he will abundantly pardon."
[23:43] This idea of that we've got to lose our
[23:45] minds in order to find truth. Forsake
[23:48] our thoughts and and abandon our our
[23:50] ways. For my thoughts, speaking of the
[23:52] Lord in his uh his his mind, for my
[23:56] thoughts are not your thoughts, neither
[23:57] are your ways my ways, sayeth the Lord.
[24:00] Well, how are they different? For as the
[24:02] heavens are higher than the earth, so
[24:03] are my ways higher than your ways. In my
[24:06] thoughts than your thoughts and I
[24:08] believe it's almost put in a way that's
[24:09] not you cannot calculate, well, how high
[24:12] are the heavens and the earth? Well,
[24:13] where do they begin? When do they
[24:14] separate? Which ones you referring to?
[24:15] In other words, don't even try. It's not
[24:17] even close. Our thoughts and our ways
[24:20] are so based, so beneath, so low that we
[24:23] cannot begin to comprehend the mind and
[24:27] thoughts of God. As it says in verse 9,
[24:28] "For as the heavens are higher than the
[24:30] earth, so are my ways higher than your
[24:32] ways and my thoughts than your
[24:34] thoughts." I think these things are uh
[24:37] very familiar to us. Now, as I have it
[24:39] summarized on this slide, notice this in
[24:41] terms of our thoughts and God's
[24:43] thoughts, his high thoughts and his
[24:45] ways. And then there's going to be this
[24:49] example in nature. And he says, "For as
[24:51] the rain cometh down, and the snow from
[24:53] heaven, and returneth not thither, but
[24:56] waterth the earth, and maketh it bring
[24:58] forth and bud that it may give seed to
[25:00] the sewer and bread to the eater." What
[25:02] is he referring to? This natural process
[25:05] where rain comes down out of heaven and
[25:07] it doesn't just evaporate and go back up
[25:09] into the clouds, but this rain and snow
[25:12] goes and waters the earth. And in
[25:14] watering the earth, it causes
[25:16] germination and then nutri uh nurturing
[25:19] of a seed that buds and produces seed
[25:23] again that can be harvested to make
[25:26] bread. And it has all come from this
[25:29] process of seed being sown, the water
[25:32] coming down out of earth and producing
[25:34] that
[25:35] bread. These natural processes that
[25:38] Isaiah is pointing to is evidence of an
[25:40] intelligence. We might call it mother
[25:42] nature.
[25:44] says, "So shall so shall my words be
[25:47] that goeth forth out of my mouth. It
[25:50] shall not return unto me void, but it
[25:53] shall accomplish that which I please,
[25:54] and it shall prosper in the thing where
[25:57] unto I sent it." This is a this is an
[25:59] intelligence as there is a design and a
[26:02] process and intelligence in nature where
[26:05] the rain coming down uh nurtures soil,
[26:08] germinates seed, and is part of this
[26:09] great process that produces life again.
[26:12] Uh, brother Brandham in the sermon
[26:13] leadership is talking about how that how
[26:15] does that sap respond in the winter uh
[26:19] to not kill the tree
[26:22] and and brother Brandham is using that
[26:23] and I don't believe he was trying to
[26:25] explain to us in perfect detail how sap
[26:28] works in a tree but how that the sap
[26:30] will respond to wintertime conditions in
[26:33] order to
[26:34] preserve life in the tree. And it's an
[26:38] intelligence that does that.
[26:40] We have even in our in our today and
[26:43] it's been been this way for decades how
[26:45] that we can have a there's an
[26:48] intelligence that guides a a pig's
[26:50] thyroid uh this uh extract from a pig's
[26:53] thyroid to keep the human body in
[26:56] balance and regulate symptoms of
[26:59] hypothyroidism. How does it do that?
[27:01] Because there's some design or process
[27:04] or intelligence. There's this
[27:06] communication that takes place to where
[27:08] whatever is in that composition a human
[27:11] can take and brother Benham uses it to
[27:13] say that that pig thyroid will go right
[27:15] to the human thyroid and it'll balance
[27:17] out these symptoms.
[27:20] DNA even in itself is coded
[27:22] intelligence determines your certain
[27:25] traits and your height and your sorry to
[27:27] those those of us who are short it's
[27:29] already in your DNA you can't take any
[27:31] thought and add to your stature it's
[27:32] already there your hair your eye color
[27:34] naturally though we can change those
[27:36] things these days it's in the DNA and
[27:39] where are they getting now through DNA
[27:40] editing where they can determine by
[27:42] changing the code what it may look like
[27:47] so there are this there's an
[27:48] intelligence in the DNA that determines
[27:52] these
[27:53] things. And our human intelligence, it
[27:56] is
[27:58] corrupted. And the way that we think and
[28:00] the way that we operate, it's vastly
[28:02] inferior to divine intelligence. Our
[28:05] human wisdom, our human thinking is
[28:08] different than God's intelligence. God's
[28:10] intelligence is pure. Ours has been
[28:12] corrupted.
[28:14] Now, I'm just wanting to pivot just a
[28:17] little bit here as we try to get to the
[28:19] the closing half of this
[28:22] sermon. Sunday, we mentioned that to
[28:25] create art, it requires uh an artist is
[28:29] going to make choices and decisions
[28:31] about what they're whatever they're
[28:32] creating that is fundamentally alien to
[28:35] a machine that can create art, right? or
[28:38] we could say artificial intelligence
[28:40] where you just you ask uh Deep Seek or
[28:43] you ask Deep Mind or you ask Gemini or
[28:45] you ask Chat GPT or C-Pilot any one of
[28:48] these things and you say hey could you
[28:50] produce this for me could you make this
[28:52] could you write a novel and could you if
[28:54] you have enough tokens or credits are
[28:55] willing to pay enough it can it can spit
[28:57] out video it can produce images and
[28:59] pictures and create art it can write
[29:01] novels but the decisions that are being
[29:03] made by that
[29:05] machine uh using its language models and
[29:08] it and its gathering of information is
[29:10] vastly different than when an artist
[29:12] sits down to paint a picture or a
[29:14] novelist sits down to write a
[29:16] book. And in that way that the decisions
[29:19] being made by a machine are
[29:21] fundamentally foreign or by an artist is
[29:24] foreign to the machine that can create
[29:26] art. God's
[29:28] intelligence is fundamentally alien to
[29:31] human thinking.
[29:33] So we are the ones that have an
[29:35] artificial
[29:36] intelligence because we're the ones that
[29:38] are making it anyways and programming
[29:39] it. Be careful what you submit to chat
[29:42] GPT because you're making it part of the
[29:44] algorithm. you make it a part of the
[29:45] recipe and it knows there's even uh even
[29:49] myself as I've been studying just for
[29:51] the purposes of my law practice that if
[29:53] I was to take a client's trade secret
[29:56] and I was to use an AI model to glean
[30:00] something from it, it's in there and
[30:03] there's a chance that somebody may be
[30:04] able to get it. Even if you couldn't go
[30:07] into the model and see it, it's all in
[30:08] just ones and zeros, but it's in there
[30:10] somewhere. And so that's this is man
[30:13] contrived, right? Very fascinating the
[30:16] direction they're going with artificial
[30:18] intelligence. I think it's what we're
[30:19] some of the things that our children are
[30:20] having to fight, some of the things that
[30:22] we're going to be wrestling with even as
[30:23] human beings and the way that it can
[30:25] just hook us a and get our attention.
[30:27] But it's a it's a reflection of how that
[30:30] something can produce something and make
[30:33] something and create something but never
[30:35] really have the mind of the artist.
[30:37] Right. Right. And it's in the same way
[30:39] that we as humans can mimic, we can
[30:41] copy, we can act, we can do a lot of
[30:43] different things, but God's mind is
[30:45] fundamentally alien to human thinking.
[30:49] Isaiah 40:es 12, 13, and 14. Whoath
[30:52] measured the waters in the hollow of his
[30:54] hand, and meed out heaven with a span,
[30:57] and comprehended the dust of the earth
[30:59] in a measure, and weighed the mountains
[31:01] in scales, and the hills in a balance.
[31:03] None of us. Sounds like God's
[31:06] conversation with Job. Where were you?
[31:08] And did you take the bands of Orion? Can
[31:11] you tell lightning where to strike? Who
[31:13] hath directed the spirit of the Lord or
[31:14] being his counselor hath taught him?
[31:17] It's part of the question that's asked
[31:18] in
[31:19] Romans. Who hath directed the spirit of
[31:21] the Lord? Or who can be his counselor?
[31:23] With whom took he counsel? Who
[31:25] instructed him? Who taught him the path
[31:26] of judgment and taught him knowledge and
[31:28] showeth to him the way of
[31:30] understanding? God does not need to be
[31:32] taught. God cannot be taught. It's God's
[31:35] word that is true intelligence. He needs
[31:37] no instruction. He needs no teaching.
[31:39] The natural mind cannot even do those
[31:41] things. We cannot give God a new
[31:44] thought. You say, "Oh, well, what about
[31:45] when the king requested more time?" God,
[31:48] that's not questioning God's
[31:49] intelligence. That's not showing a
[31:51] better decision. When Moses stood in the
[31:52] gap, God wasn't caught by surprise and
[31:55] God hadn't conceived it. God is cannot
[31:57] be taught by man.
[32:02] Real intelligence, real true wisdom is
[32:04] the mind of God. And artificial
[32:07] intelligence is human intellect
[32:09] perverted from its pure
[32:11] form. Our minds, human wisdom is
[32:15] intellect perverted from its pure form.
[32:22] In Ezekiel chapter 36:es 25-
[32:28] 27, I had adjusted some things in my
[32:31] notes and I took a number of scriptures
[32:34] out and some quotations. So I'll say
[32:37] this, it's this is why our minds need to
[32:39] be renewed. Amen.
[32:41] This is why the Bible isn't just merely
[32:43] talking about the soul being transformed
[32:46] through the new birth, but now there's
[32:48] this process of our minds and our
[32:50] spirits being renewed. Ezekiel chapter
[32:53] 36 25- 27, brother Benham deals with
[32:56] this in just a couple places and uh and
[32:59] uses it as a type of even a change of
[33:02] nature and it also it speaks to this
[33:06] entire process of the transformation of
[33:08] the person. Then will I sprinkle clean
[33:10] water upon you, and you shall be clean
[33:12] from all your filthiness, and from all
[33:13] your idols will I cleanse you. A new
[33:15] heart also will I give you, and a new
[33:17] spirit will I put within you, and I will
[33:20] take away the stony heart out of your
[33:21] flesh, and I'll give you a heart of
[33:24] flesh, and I'll put my spirit within
[33:26] you, and cause you to walk in my
[33:29] statutes, and you shall keep my
[33:30] judgments and do them.
[33:32] I know we're tempted to kind of create a
[33:34] bucket list out of this or a
[33:36] diagrammable process, but it's really
[33:38] looking in whole of what God is doing to
[33:40] the person when the soul is regenerated.
[33:43] And how that there's this process of
[33:44] sanctification of the of the mind and of
[33:46] the spirit, taking out of the stony
[33:48] heart, giving you a heart of flesh, his
[33:51] spirit indwelling in us to cause us to
[33:53] do his word. God in you both to will and
[33:55] to do of his good pleasure. Amen. So
[33:57] when we are being transformed by the new
[34:00] birth and brother Bram says now that you
[34:01] have been saved as you have and filled
[34:03] the Holy Ghost as you have. Now the
[34:05] process is that we're to be transformed
[34:07] into the perfect will of God by the
[34:09] renewing of our minds. Where he has
[34:11] taken out a stony heart and given us a
[34:13] heart of flesh and it's his spirit
[34:15] that's causing us to do his word to keep
[34:17] his commandments.
[34:18] Given us this heart of flesh that has
[34:20] this intelligence of God this faculty to
[34:22] conceive rightly. This is the process of
[34:25] transforming our thinking and our
[34:28] minds. Now, I trust that each one of you
[34:32] are kind of following me to this point
[34:33] and recognize it's very simple these
[34:35] things that we're laying down in Luke
[34:38] 11:52. This is an important I think this
[34:40] is an important piece to understanding
[34:42] in our day when there's going to be an
[34:45] opening up of the word of God. And this
[34:47] isn't just historical. It's not
[34:48] theological. It's not religious. It has
[34:51] to do with a key being given back to us
[34:54] in order to know God's mind in his
[34:55] heart. In order to have thus sayith the
[34:58] Lord Lukeap 11 verse 52 Jesus says woe
[35:02] unto you lawyers for you have taken
[35:05] away woe unto you
[35:07] lawyers. Brother I had a preacher tell
[35:10] me that one time. He said I've got a
[35:12] scripture for you brother Aaron. Woe
[35:13] unto you lawyers. And I said well I have
[35:15] one too. And I think I've told you all
[35:16] this before. Woe is me.
[35:18] It says, "For ye have taken away the key
[35:20] of knowledge. You have entered not in
[35:22] yourselves, and them that were entering
[35:24] in, ye hindered." Well, that's not
[35:27] fair. You don't enter yourself, but you
[35:30] won't let others enter in. Tells you
[35:32] something about that this dynamic that's
[35:34] taken place where the lawyers have taken
[35:37] away the key of knowledge. These false
[35:39] teachings have taken away
[35:40] understanding. And not only are they
[35:43] unwilling to enter into the knowledge of
[35:45] the truth, they lock it up and they
[35:49] can't open it, nor will they let others
[35:51] enter it in.
[35:53] And this is the worst of all
[35:55] transgressions is to keep the people in
[35:57] ignorance.
[35:58] and these things, this key of knowledge
[36:00] that would open up or unlock the key uh
[36:03] that would allow someone to enter in and
[36:04] have access to it that this very uh
[36:07] dynamic that would keep people from
[36:09] knowing truth and through these false
[36:12] seeds that cause the mind to be bound
[36:14] up. It's artificial conception that
[36:18] prevents people from coming to the
[36:21] knowledge of truth because they have
[36:23] this act of learning and they maybe even
[36:26] h have this uh demonstration of what
[36:30] they've learned. So they can kind of
[36:31] enter into a religious process. But if
[36:34] you haven't been born again and you
[36:36] haven't received the spirit of Christ
[36:37] and he's not revealing himself to you,
[36:39] then you can just have this pattern of
[36:41] mimicking what you're learning in not
[36:44] actually coming into deeper fellowship
[36:46] and relationship with God. Amen. I know
[36:49] that may be a difficult concept to think
[36:51] about. And I don't say it to scare you.
[36:54] I just say it to identify that there is
[36:56] a real genuine experience of the baptism
[36:58] of the Holy Ghost that you ought to
[37:00] desire to have with everything that's in
[37:02] you. And you ought to know that you've
[37:03] experienced if you have. In Luke 1
[37:08] 76-79, you'll see here now Jesus saying
[37:11] that they've taken away the key of
[37:13] knowledge. There is a way that God's
[37:15] wanting to restore this knowledge, these
[37:17] minds that had been corrupted. A lot of
[37:20] different scriptures that we could use.
[37:21] I believe we'll use some here in just a
[37:22] moment. But it says, "And now speaking
[37:24] of John the Baptist, he is in the spirit
[37:26] of Elijah. It's an image of even the
[37:28] forerunner we've received in this hour.
[37:30] and thou ch thou child shall be called
[37:32] the prophet of the highest for thou
[37:34] shalt go before the face lord to prepare
[37:36] his ways to give knowledge of salvation
[37:39] unto his people by the remission of
[37:41] their sins. So there's a a knowledge
[37:43] that's being imparted or there's going
[37:45] to be something expressed through the
[37:46] tender mercy of our God whereby and
[37:49] notice this uh it may may seem to be
[37:51] poetry but it it speaks of this
[37:54] enlightening this bringing to light this
[37:55] conception whereby the day spring from
[37:58] on high visited us to give light to them
[38:00] that sit in darkness and in the shadow
[38:02] of death to guide our feet in the way of
[38:05] peace. Now, that's knowledge. That's
[38:08] wisdom. That's understanding. That's
[38:10] divine intelligence. And though there's
[38:12] a prophet that comes that gives
[38:13] knowledge of salvation,
[38:16] humanity was living in the vanity of
[38:19] their imaginations and their foolish
[38:20] minds were were covered over in
[38:23] darkness.
[38:24] As it says that they sat in darkness and
[38:27] light was sprung up. And so there was
[38:28] this forerunner that was going to begin
[38:30] to open up to them this intelligence to
[38:33] give knowledge of our God, to give
[38:35] knowledge of salvation so that the light
[38:37] of the gospel could shine unto
[38:40] them. In 2 Corinthians chapter 4:es
[38:46] 1-6, Paul says, "Therefore, seeing we
[38:49] have this ministry, as we have received
[38:52] mercy, we faint
[38:54] not, but have denounced the hidden
[38:56] things of
[38:59] dishonesty." I think I'll just I'll just
[39:01] read through to the end and then we'll
[39:03] come back to some of these things. Have
[39:04] renounced the hidden things of
[39:06] dishonesty, not walking in craftiness,
[39:07] nor handling the word of God
[39:08] deceitfully. So there's kind of this uh
[39:11] unholy trinity. Hidden things of
[39:13] dishonesty, walking in craftness, h the
[39:15] word of God deceitfully, but by
[39:16] manifestation of the truth, commending
[39:18] ourselves to every man's conscience in
[39:21] the sight of
[39:22] God. This is intelligence versus
[39:26] stupidity. And I don't I don't int I'm
[39:29] not just trying to use a real crass or
[39:31] harsh word, but it's intelligence versus
[39:33] this ignorance. Dishonesty is
[39:36] confusion. So even of that shame that we
[39:39] mentioned earlier, craftiness is a false
[39:41] wisdom. You they're using the Bible as
[39:44] craft to
[39:46] seduce. So there's a way that they're
[39:48] taking things and building things with
[39:50] it. It's not their original substance,
[39:53] but they'll take it and cause it to
[39:54] paint a picture that doesn't exist.
[39:57] And I've said this before, uh, it's been
[40:00] coming back to my mind, but there's a
[40:02] way that we sit back
[40:04] as a artist and we take statements of
[40:08] brother Brandham and we we add them to
[40:10] these other things and we create our own
[40:12] monster and we've all become
[40:13] Frankensteines in that way by creating
[40:16] something that is not the original and
[40:18] pure and real and we're haunted by that
[40:20] monster. The monster's not Frankenstein.
[40:23] You're the Frankenstein. You're the
[40:24] doctor that's created the monster.
[40:26] That's right.
[40:29] And so this is uh showing the difference
[40:32] between real intelligence and this lack
[40:35] of intelligence, the dishonesty, the
[40:37] craftiness, the
[40:39] deceit. So there's this intelligence
[40:41] which is from God. But if our gospel be
[40:43] hid is hid to them that are lost, we
[40:45] could say the unintelligent, those that
[40:46] can't grasp it or conceive it, in whom
[40:48] the God of this world hath blinded the
[40:50] minds of them which believe not, lest
[40:52] the light of the glorious gospel of
[40:54] Christ, who's in the image of God,
[40:55] should shine unto them. What do they not
[40:58] have? The key of knowledge. What are
[40:59] they lacking? They haven't been given
[41:01] knowledge. They're in darkness. They're
[41:02] blind. They're encumbered. They're
[41:04] they're numb. For we preach not
[41:06] ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord,
[41:07] and ourselves, your servants for Jesus'
[41:09] sake. For God who commanded the light to
[41:12] shine out of darkness. Genesis 1:2 where
[41:14] the darkness of was upon the face of the
[41:16] earth. It was chaotic and it was
[41:18] confusion is intelligible. You couldn't
[41:20] distinguish anything. Then God's spirit
[41:22] brings order and harmony. What was that?
[41:23] That was intelligence.
[41:26] He has shined in our hearts to give the
[41:28] light of the knowledge of the glory of
[41:32] God in the face of Jesus Christ. shined
[41:36] in our hearts to give the light of the
[41:40] knowledge of the glory in the face of
[41:44] Jesus Christ.
[41:46] These darkened minds are to be
[41:48] enlightened to true in to true
[41:51] intelligence. Knowledge there speaks of
[41:53] intelligence even in the the Greek the
[41:55] word that's used. It's to bring to this
[41:58] understanding that there's a there's a
[42:00] higher mind. There's a higher
[42:03] way. In 2 Corinthians chapter
[42:08] 10:5, this is part of our active duty as
[42:11] a good soldier. We're to cast down
[42:13] imaginations
[42:15] through the weap the weapons that we
[42:17] have these supernatural things at our
[42:19] disposal. We're to cast down cast
[42:21] casting down imaginations. That's
[42:24] reasoning or judgment. And every high
[42:27] thing that exaltth itself against the
[42:29] knowledge of God. This is an
[42:30] intelligence. any artificial conception
[42:33] that raises up against the intelligences
[42:35] of God, we're to cast it down
[42:38] and bringing into captivity every
[42:40] thought to the obedience of Christ. This
[42:44] is our daily warfare. Amen. I could I
[42:47] believe I could distill it down this
[42:48] simply that tomorrow morning when you go
[42:50] home tonight, whatever interaction you
[42:52] have on your computer, your cell phone,
[42:53] your tablets, your your board games,
[42:55] your your magazines, your newspapers,
[42:57] whatever it is you engage in, and as you
[42:58] go throughout your day and you interact
[42:59] with your siblings, your teacher, your
[43:01] boss, your employees, whatever it is,
[43:03] and on some level, there's going to be
[43:05] some something that rises up that's
[43:07] contrary to the word of God, some sort
[43:09] of thought or judgment or process,
[43:11] something artificially contrived that's
[43:14] going to raise up against the
[43:15] intelligence of And we need to be sharp
[43:17] in our discernment to be able to say,
[43:18] "No, you sit down. There's going to be
[43:21] no artificial resurrections taking place
[43:24] uh in my mind and in my heart. I want
[43:26] the the thoughts going to come, but I
[43:27] can reject it."
[43:32] Because what we're living in is Leodysa.
[43:36] And Leodysia is marked as lukewarm.
[43:40] And this lukewarmness presents itself in
[43:42] this way. Revelations 3:1 17 Because
[43:45] thou sayest, I am rich and increase with
[43:48] goods and have needed nothing and
[43:50] knowest
[43:51] not. They do not know that they're
[43:53] wretched, miserable, poor, and blind and
[43:56] naked. This is what it means to be
[43:59] lukewarm. that you are in reality if you
[44:02] think about it. So this lukewarmness is
[44:05] achieved this stasis or this state is
[44:08] achieved by in reality being
[44:10] naked but in their minds thinking
[44:12] they're clothed.
[44:14] So they kind of find themselves in this
[44:16] state of they're actually naked but they
[44:18] perceive themselves to be clothed. So in
[44:21] one way they are clothed but in reality
[44:24] they're not.
[44:26] That's some that's a really good
[44:27] philosophical one for you there for the
[44:29] loyal to really get into that idea of
[44:31] being it's like Schrodinger's cat you
[44:33] know till you observe them they see
[44:34] themselves as actually naked they think
[44:36] they're clothed
[44:38] and no it's not they're not able the
[44:40] word there means they're not able to
[44:42] comprehend truth
[44:44] they have no capacity of self-awareness
[44:47] so that if you even told them they were
[44:49] naked I'm not naked
[44:52] if this is not le oysia
[44:54] right there was uh I I don't mean to be
[44:58] uh um inappropriate, but there was
[45:01] something I had seen uh I can't just
[45:04] remember exactly when where maybe I
[45:06] don't think it was a protest, but it was
[45:07] an interaction and it had to do with uh
[45:09] my body, my choice. And and some some
[45:12] man said something and the woman said,
[45:13] "Well, you don't have a uterus, so you
[45:15] don't have a right to say that." And he
[45:16] goes, "How could you say I don't have
[45:18] one? How could you assume that about
[45:20] me?" What? He says, "I my pronouns are
[45:22] man having uterus or uterus having man."
[45:25] And the person was like, "Well, I guess
[45:26] I can't say much to that." Why? Because
[45:29] there's no real there's no real
[45:30] nothing's grounded in truth anymore.
[45:33] And they do not know. They have no
[45:35] capacity of self-awareness. The the
[45:37] Bible's even talking they can't process
[45:39] things correctly. No real genuine
[45:41] self-reflection, critical thinking.
[45:43] There's no perceiving.
[45:45] So the the mark of Leo is they know not
[45:48] but they have a lot of thoughts.
[45:50] They have a lot of arts.
[45:53] They they are rich, increase with goods,
[45:55] and have need of nothing. And they can
[45:57] produce the evidences that they are. But
[45:59] in reality and in truth, when it comes
[46:01] to real intelligence, they're wretched,
[46:03] miserable, poor, blind, and naked.
[46:06] They cannot comprehend reality or
[46:08] perceived truth. They have no capacity
[46:10] of self-awareness. They truly are not
[46:12] intelligent. Isn't it amazing? with as
[46:15] many advances we've made in science and
[46:17] in technology and the uh the eases of
[46:20] life and the things that we've done to
[46:21] make things uh processes run very
[46:24] smoothly where they're now getting to
[46:26] the place and I was reading uh sometime
[46:28] over the last year a few places where
[46:30] they they're able to edit DNA at cons at
[46:33] the time of conception to determine very
[46:36] specific things about the child whether
[46:38] it be gender height hair color too late
[46:42] for me hair period period.
[46:46] This is what they're able to do, but
[46:48] they're foolish with it. There's no real
[46:51] wisdom in it.
[46:53] The age that we're living in and what we
[46:55] could see in the politics and science is
[46:57] just a reflection in
[46:59] pure worldly arenas of what the
[47:03] antichrist is trying to do within the
[47:04] church. That's right. And within
[47:07] spiritual warfare,
[47:10] I really hope it's a a a picture, a
[47:12] clear picture to you tonight. Maybe if
[47:14] not clear, at least there's something
[47:15] where I don't have the cow in the tree.
[47:18] I hope there's enough here to where
[47:19] you're seeing this seeing this from
[47:21] where it's burdening my heart. In the
[47:23] sermon, Satan's Eden, Brother Bam says
[47:25] this. They think that they are well
[47:27] filled with the spirit. They're
[47:31] already this is the age that we're
[47:33] living in. And this Revelations 3:17 in
[47:34] Satan's Eden, he says the Leodysian
[47:36] church age is the Pentecostal church
[47:38] age. Don't ever forget that the
[47:42] Leodysian church age is the Pentecostal
[47:46] age that God had to send Malachi 452 to
[47:50] get them out of their mess.
[47:52] And what does it bring us to? It brings
[47:53] us to what he called the bride age. Does
[47:56] that mean there's an eighth church age?
[47:58] No. No. Because there's seven church
[48:00] ages. And now out of the church, God
[48:03] calls a bride. And in her age, her
[48:06] messenger is Christ. So we don't look
[48:08] for another prophet. We're not getting
[48:10] hung up on numer uh numbers here. We
[48:13] live in Leodysia, but we're spiritually
[48:15] caught up into a union, invisible union
[48:18] with Christ. So if we live in
[48:21] lukewarmness, we're in the Leodysian
[48:22] age. That's right. I and we're in that
[48:25] Pentecostal church age has some very
[48:27] demonstrative characteristics because
[48:29] it's the last church age. So the
[48:30] Leodysian church age is the Pentecostal
[48:32] church age. There's not going to be
[48:34] another revival that becomes the
[48:35] Pentecostal church age or the true
[48:37] Pentecostal church age. That's happened.
[48:40] Luther had his message. Wesley had his
[48:42] message and Pentecost had their message.
[48:46] He says also it said that because you
[48:48] are lukewarm neither hot or cold. And he
[48:50] says the emotions of the outside the
[48:53] mental conception of the gospel. Sure.
[48:56] Notice how it's just it's right there
[48:59] put out there before us to where it's
[49:00] not just a failure of intellectual
[49:02] faith. It's a failure of emotional
[49:04] faith. It's the failure of the mind.
[49:07] Whether it be jumping up and down or
[49:09] reading quietly.
[49:11] If it's intellect, if it's human spirit,
[49:13] it's both the same. Whether it be
[49:14] emotional or formal, they're of the same
[49:17] ilk. They're of the same kind. They're
[49:20] lukewarm. Neither hot nor cold cold. the
[49:22] emotions of the outside, the mental
[49:24] conception of the gospel because he
[49:26] said, "You're that way. I'll spill you
[49:28] out of my mouth." In other words, it
[49:29] made him sick to see the church in that
[49:33] condition. the
[49:36] lukewarmness of these
[49:39] extremes, the Pentecostal church age
[49:42] that doesn't know, no real
[49:45] intelligence, go and find in the message
[49:48] of the hour, kind of pointing a little
[49:49] bit to where we want to arrive Sunday of
[49:51] what's to come in this hour to bring us
[49:53] back to rapturing faith.
[49:56] Brother Bam in the sermon the invisible
[49:57] unit of the bride of Christ. He says now
[49:59] we school our seminary students in all
[50:00] kinds of Bible theology and things like
[50:02] that man-made theology and got a bunch
[50:05] of church just exactly a
[50:07] lessa like God said it would be. He says
[50:10] oh my when I look at that it makes me
[50:14] shiverreated with intellectual
[50:18] conception. This is what the age has
[50:20] become. The church age became
[50:22] impregnated with intellectual
[50:24] conception.
[50:26] something that brother Brown was
[50:27] teaching in great detail in ' 65 of how
[50:29] she's conceived something and she's
[50:32] bringing forth but she can't bring forth
[50:34] real children by the word. So what is
[50:36] it? It's artificial conception.
[50:41] There is the uh one of the phrases a
[50:43] phrase that was more common a phrase
[50:45] that was more common that was an AI
[50:46] before artificial intelligence was
[50:47] artificial
[50:48] incimination. And that's what it's a
[50:50] it's a hybrid process. It's a faked
[50:53] process that's bringing forth children,
[50:56] but it's not children by the word. Amen.
[51:00] Says this leadya is pregnantated with
[51:03] intellectual
[51:05] conception. It's an artificial
[51:09] conception. But as we read tonight, I'll
[51:12] close with just a few scriptures here,
[51:14] but this is my last block. 1 Corinthians
[51:16] chapter 2:1 16. Just weigh this in your
[51:19] hearts and in your minds. For who hath
[51:21] known the mind of the Lord that he may
[51:23] instruct
[51:23] him? Now, there's layers here that as
[51:26] we've already seen, man cannot instruct
[51:28] God. But the spiritual man cannot be
[51:32] corrected without the mind of God. It's
[51:36] it's who can natural man cannot judge a
[51:39] spiritual man. A spiritual man is
[51:41] corrected by the mind of God. But who
[51:43] hath known the mind of the Lord that he
[51:44] may instruct him? And so he says, "But
[51:46] we have the mind of Christ." Amen.
[51:48] Whether Paul was saying that he was
[51:50] qualified to correct the Corinthian
[51:51] church
[51:54] or Paul is saying that he had the mind
[51:57] of Christ, but he's also saying we have
[52:00] the mind of Christ. The mind of the Lord
[52:02] is his
[52:04] intelligence. It's noose, that Greek
[52:06] word of that faculty of the mind that's
[52:08] necessary for understanding what is
[52:10] real, what is true, what is
[52:11] genuine. The ability to distinguish
[52:14] between what is real and fake. I wanted
[52:17] to preach a sermon, faith or
[52:21] cake. And I was trying to work on a
[52:23] slide that would say faith and then cake
[52:26] kind of cut to look like cake. Maybe we
[52:29] can make it happen. I don't know how
[52:30] many people here are really good at
[52:31] making cakes. And we can ask, is this
[52:33] real? Is it faith or cake? And
[52:35] unfortunately for us, sometimes we find
[52:37] that we have cake because God wants us
[52:39] to get into the real thing. We have the
[52:42] mind of Christ. Amen. So many fake
[52:45] things in the world today. So many
[52:47] voices. We have the mind of Christ.
[52:49] Let's let's take advantage of it.
[52:52] Christ, the Bible says in Colossians
[52:54] 2:3, "In whom are hid all the treasures
[52:57] of wisdom and knowledge." These
[52:59] treasures of wisdom and knowledge are
[53:01] available to you in your earthn vessels.
[53:05] Christ holds all true intelligence.
[53:08] Peter wrote and said in 2 Peter 3:18,
[53:10] "But grow in grace and in the knowledge
[53:12] of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To
[53:14] him be glory both now and forever."
[53:16] Amen. He's not saying that we should
[53:18] grow in knowledge in the sense we grow
[53:20] we learn more about him in an academic
[53:23] sense or in a way that we can learn but
[53:26] as a part of being intelligent and part
[53:28] of having the mind of Christ is that we
[53:30] could come to know him more. not
[53:32] learning more about Christ in a carnal
[53:34] sense, but it's a transformation of our
[53:37] intelligence into his a manifestation of
[53:40] it. It grows. Amen.
[53:43] There's ways that they can measure
[53:46] intelligence. They might call it
[53:48] intelligent quotient and IQ. And it's
[53:52] something that they can measure even at
[53:53] a time when somebody doesn't know very
[53:55] much. But based upon how they respond to
[53:58] situations and answer questions at very
[54:00] young ages, they can begin to develop
[54:01] some sort of a relative composite score
[54:03] of what they call their intelligence.
[54:05] This is all natural and carnally. I
[54:07] would say that to you who have the Holy
[54:09] Ghost, you have all intelligence. Amen.
[54:13] You have it. We just need to grow in
[54:16] grace. We just need to grow in that. Let
[54:20] this mind allow it to be in you. The way
[54:23] up is down. We can't do it by being
[54:25] arrogant. We can't do it by pretending.
[54:30] James chapter 1 verse 21 says it this
[54:33] way. Wherefore lay apart all filthiness
[54:38] and superfluity of naughtiness. Such a
[54:41] an interesting phrase. Superfluity of
[54:44] naughtiness. I challenge all parents to
[54:46] use it with your kids at some point in
[54:49] the next week. Lay apart all filthiness.
[54:52] That might be easy if we just go in
[54:53] their rooms. and superfluity of
[54:55] naughtiness and receive. Notice this
[54:58] conception, receive with meekness the
[55:01] engrafted word which is able to save
[55:03] your souls.
[55:05] We need to re reject all the the
[55:08] artificial conception of things and
[55:11] receive the
[55:13] word. This is not academic. This is not
[55:15] intellect. It's not an artificial
[55:17] conception of artificial intelligence.
[55:19] It's I'm referring to an artificial
[55:21] intelligence just using the phrase
[55:22] artificial conception. But yet there's
[55:25] this side to it. We can view it through
[55:26] the mind as being a womb and what kind
[55:28] of seed that we receive and whatever
[55:31] we're receiving garbage in, garbage
[55:34] out. A and whatever level, if it's only
[55:36] coming in intellectually and the mind is
[55:39] opening up and receiving something and
[55:40] we don't have the spirit of Christ down
[55:42] in our souls, then it's never going to
[55:43] reflect back out in the proper way.
[55:48] Let's lay
[55:50] aside those things. We can only do this
[55:52] by discernment. We can only do this with
[55:54] love. To lay aside, to reject those
[55:56] things that are evil, that are filthy,
[55:57] that are naughty, a and this lack of
[56:00] moderation, and continue to receive
[56:02] through humility, the word which is able
[56:05] to grow and to cultivate, to grow you
[56:07] into the full stature of Jesus
[56:09] Christ. God, help us to do these things.
[56:13] And I know that he will because he who
[56:15] has begun this work in you, he's just
[56:17] and faithful to finish it. Amen. I'm
[56:20] thankful for your patience this evening
[56:22] and allowing me the opportunity to
[56:23] deliver my burden this subject. If we
[56:25] could just stand to our feet, bow our
[56:27] heads in prayer. I'll turn it over to
[56:29] brother Andrew to lead in worship. And
[56:31] our musicians are welcome to
[56:37] come. Let's
[56:39] pray together. If you have a need
[56:42] tonight and in your heart, just lift it
[56:44] up before the Lord as we pray. Heavenly
[56:47] Father, we appreciate you so
[56:50] much. And Lord, just through the
[56:52] simplicity of these scriptures and this
[56:54] very narrow look into your word, I
[56:58] believe that
[56:59] we can become more in tune with your
[57:03] word and just develop this greater
[57:07] harmony and symmetry with your
[57:10] spirit so that we can grow. It's there.
[57:13] As newborn babes, we should desire the
[57:15] sincere milk of the word that we can
[57:16] grow thereby. We can grow in this
[57:20] stature. It's in us by this DNA, by this
[57:23] coded intelligence through the right
[57:25] kind of
[57:27] nurture. This great mind of the divine
[57:31] can live itself
[57:33] out. We could ask ourselves, well, what
[57:35] would it look like? Are we going to
[57:36] create worlds and go live on them? Are
[57:38] we going to speak to storms and stop
[57:42] them? If we have need of it, and it's
[57:44] according to your word, Lord, the power
[57:46] is there to do it.
[57:49] But really what I find I want to be is a
[57:51] better
[57:53] father. What I find is I want to be a
[57:55] better
[57:57] spouse. And I don't want to just
[58:00] learn how to be a better
[58:04] spouse. I want to lay aside every
[58:06] artificial conception and just let you
[58:09] live through me.
[58:12] Lord, I know how much I love my wife,
[58:13] how much I love my children, how much I
[58:15] love this church and the people that are
[58:17] in it. And Lord, because I have that
[58:20] great love, I know that I could just
[58:21] cast my cares upon you and yield to you
[58:23] and ask that you would help me to not
[58:26] just love carnally and love imperfectly,
[58:28] but that your love would flow through
[58:30] me, knowing that you are the best thing
[58:33] for my wife and my children, the
[58:34] atmosphere in my
[58:36] home. That in you is all fountain of
[58:40] treasure and
[58:42] wisdom. That in you I find my rest. And
[58:47] so Lord, I pray for everyone here
[58:48] tonight that's longing for more of
[58:51] you that needs to steal away from the
[58:54] voices in this world.
[58:57] Lord, we are becoming more and more
[58:59] reliable upon
[59:01] uh synthetic
[59:04] processes,
[59:06] recipes,
[59:09] queries,
[59:11] snippets where we interact with a model
[59:14] that spits out an outcome.
[59:17] And there's a way, Lord, that we can
[59:19] begin to act that way with you where
[59:21] we're just querying you and our prayers
[59:23] and our requests become nothing more
[59:26] than a prompt to a large language model,
[59:30] a prompt to chat GPT. It's no different
[59:33] when we say, "God, I need this." Or,
[59:35] "What about this?" It's no different
[59:36] than saying, "Gemini, what about this?"
[59:40] Lord, we want to enter into a deeper
[59:42] level of
[59:44] not
[59:45] experiences but true revelation of your
[59:50] word. So we seek your face,
[59:53] Father. As I see a hunger growing in my
[59:56] children for the word, Lord, I I want to
[59:59] see that just cultivated more where they
[1:00:01] seek the message, Lord. They seek it
[1:00:03] out. They read their Bibles. They pray.
[1:00:06] May I be better, Lord, at demonstrating
[1:00:08] that for
[1:00:11] them. We love you, Lord. I just feel
[1:00:13] such a precious presence that in our
[1:00:15] midst. I pray that you be with the
[1:00:17] people as they're dismissed. Go with us.
[1:00:18] Give us strength. Father, comfort us. Be
[1:00:21] with those that are still sick. The
[1:00:22] night guards, different ones traveling.
[1:00:24] My wife and son, Lord, traveling to a
[1:00:26] homeschool convention. Just watch out
[1:00:28] over them. Everyone else I don't see
[1:00:30] tonight. I miss them. I pray that you
[1:00:33] bless them. We ask all this in the name
[1:00:35] of Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
