[0:00] three kinds of Christians
[0:03] and you may find that only only one of
[0:07] these kinds is actually a a true
[0:09] Christian but still there are there are
[0:13] many varieties
[0:14] uh of so-called Christians in the world
[0:16] today
[0:18] um you know just just to be a Christian
[0:21] by definition it's to be Christlike but
[0:24] we realize Satan has taken definitions
[0:28] and he's always trying to change them
[0:29] He's always trying to shift a definition
[0:32] to one way or another. And I'm thankful
[0:34] that we have been we've had our our our
[0:37] minds refreshed or rejuvenated or
[0:40] renewed
[0:41] in this hour to understand the true
[0:43] definition of what a Christian is
[0:46] because it's it's it's international. It
[0:50] has no barriers. It has no boundaries.
[0:53] Amen. It applies to to every soul living
[0:57] on the earth. They have the the right,
[0:59] they have the opportunity, the chance to
[1:01] accept Christ as their savior and for
[1:04] the very life of Jesus Christ to express
[1:08] itself through them. Amen. And make them
[1:11] a living witness of his kingdom. So I I
[1:14] the first type of Christian I want to
[1:16] talk about this morning could could be
[1:19] called a Leodysian Christian or a
[1:22] lukewarm believer or what I would call a
[1:25] casual Christian.
[1:27] You know we're living in a world today
[1:29] uh as a result of the spirit of the age
[1:33] being a lukewarm spirit which is neither
[1:36] hot it's it's not cold. So it it it's
[1:38] basically, you know, extremes are
[1:41] dangerous, extremes are frowned upon,
[1:44] extremes are unwelcome. So, it seems
[1:47] like there's there's a real push in the
[1:50] supernatural realm or the demonic realm
[1:52] to make everyone marginalized,
[1:56] you know, just just to move them into
[1:58] the middle where we're all just this one
[2:00] big mesh or or a pile of mashed
[2:03] potatoes, you know, and we're all called
[2:05] Christians. uh whether you're Protestant
[2:08] or Catholic or whatever, you know, all
[2:11] roads lead to Rome and all these
[2:13] different ideas lead to eternal life or
[2:15] salvation. And and so it seems like
[2:17] we're living in an age where to be
[2:19] differentiated or to be distinct or to
[2:22] be ex exclusive is frowned upon. But I
[2:26] want to remind you this morning that
[2:27] when Jesus was here on earth 2,000 years
[2:30] ago, he said, "I am the way, the truth,
[2:34] and the life. No man cometh to the
[2:37] father but by me.
[2:39] So he established himself as being a
[2:42] singular source. Amen. Of truth of life.
[2:45] And we know by the teaching of the
[2:47] message of the hour that he was that
[2:49] tree of life.
[2:51] Amen. Which there in Eden. And when Eve
[2:54] parttook of that other choice, Amen. she
[2:56] and all humanity entered unto death. And
[3:00] the way of the tree of life, amen, was
[3:02] blocked by cherubams with flaming
[3:04] swords. However, it was reopened by the
[3:07] person of Christ. Amen. Who said, "I am
[3:10] the way, the truth, and the life." And
[3:12] he and the way was reopened for us to
[3:14] enter into what was once forbidden.
[3:17] Amen. And there, I love this because as
[3:20] ministers of the gospel, we are like
[3:22] those cherubams with flaming swords,
[3:24] except now we're not prohibiting the way
[3:26] of the tree of life. We are pointing
[3:28] others to Christ. Amen. Amen. Unlike
[3:31] Lucifer who wanted to pull a certain
[3:34] portion of the worship to himself and
[3:36] become part of it or become the object
[3:38] of it, true ministers of the gospel are
[3:41] only pointing to Jesus Christ.
[3:43] Amen. That's the only ministry we have.
[3:45] Amen. So, uh we we but we we want to be
[3:49] guarded. We realize part of being a good
[3:51] soldier or part of being a good warrior
[3:54] for any cause is to understand your
[3:56] opponent
[3:58] and to learn the tactics of the enemy so
[4:02] that we can fortify ourselves and guard
[4:04] against the enemy's ways. It's like
[4:06] brother Benham talking about studying
[4:08] the opponent in the boxing ring. When
[4:10] you learn how he's going to punch, Amen.
[4:13] You learn how to guard and defend
[4:15] yourself and not become the victim.
[4:17] Amen. but to overcome. Amen. By blocking
[4:20] and by countering with something he's
[4:22] not expecting.
[4:24] So, we're guarding against the spirit of
[4:26] the age. We're guarding against a
[4:29] lukewarm spirit. We're guarding against
[4:31] the idea that, hey, we just need to
[4:33] blend in,
[4:35] you know, we we we don't need to be
[4:36] offensive. We we don't need and I and I
[4:38] know friend in saying this that some
[4:41] people think that the virtue of a
[4:43] Christian is being odd or being unusual
[4:46] or being different. But the thing about
[4:48] it is true Christians don't have to try
[4:50] to be different.
[4:52] They are different by virtue of the fact
[4:54] they've been bought with a price. They
[4:56] have been redeemed. They become the
[4:58] exclusive property of the Lord Jesus
[5:00] himself and his very life is manifesting
[5:03] itself through them which is nothing to
[5:05] be ashamed of. Amen.
[5:07] Amen. So they can stand boldly and
[5:09] proudly. And I I would just say this
[5:11] this morning to encourage you all and
[5:13] especially the young people, you know,
[5:14] sometimes you're made to feel like, hey,
[5:16] you know, when when we go out of these
[5:18] doors, when we leave this church service
[5:20] or we leave the sanctuary of our home,
[5:23] you know, we we kind of need to um we we
[5:25] kind of need to, you know, just um blend
[5:28] a little better. You know, don't be so
[5:31] outspoken. Don't don't be so overt with
[5:33] what we believe. But I want to tell you,
[5:35] the world is craving what you have.
[5:39] Your friends at school wish their
[5:42] parents would love them the way your
[5:44] parents love you.
[5:46] They wish they had standards. They wish
[5:48] they had a real value. Amen. That wasn't
[5:50] given to them by the world, but was
[5:52] given to them by whom they have become.
[5:55] Amen. The the purchased possession of
[5:57] the world is craving what you have.
[6:00] Amen. So don't be ashamed of it. Be
[6:02] proud. Amen. And again, be thankful, but
[6:05] but live the values, live the as as sons
[6:09] and daughters of God and find out it is
[6:11] a magnetic effect.
[6:13] Amen.
[6:13] That even though you feel resentment and
[6:16] you feel criticism, Amen. actually it's
[6:19] a deep longing within their heart
[6:22] to know the Lord Jesus the way you know
[6:25] him.
[6:26] And if you'll just be salty,
[6:28] Amen. They'll come one day
[6:31] for a taste and they'll ask you, "What
[6:33] makes you different? What gives you
[6:35] peace? What gives you stability? How
[6:38] come you don't lash out? How come you're
[6:40] not, you know, retaliatory? How come you
[6:43] you're there's there's something
[6:45] different about you?" And when they ask,
[6:47] you can give an answer.
[6:49] I found someone who gives me value, who
[6:53] gives me life. Amen. I found a a a
[6:55] worthwhile cause. Brother Benham uses
[6:58] this illustration in the breach. He said
[7:00] a woman just called up another woman
[7:02] said you know I'm Episcopelian
[7:05] said I spoke in tongues the other day. I
[7:08] believe I received the Holy Ghost but sh
[7:12] don't tell nobody.
[7:14] The prophet of God said I doubt that
[7:16] very much. You might have spoke with
[7:19] tongues but you set a man on fire. How
[7:22] is he going to set still?
[7:24] That's right. See, you can't do it.
[7:26] Could you imagine Peter, James, and John
[7:28] and them in the upper room saying, "Oh,
[7:29] we got the Holy Ghost now, but maybe we
[7:32] better just keep still, brother."
[7:34] Through windows and doors and
[7:36] everything, they went out into the
[7:38] street acting like a bunch of drunks.
[7:41] That's the real Holy Ghost.
[7:44] I want to tell you, it's not an act.
[7:47] Amen. It's It's not something you put on
[7:48] and take off. It's a reality. and you
[7:51] haven't so much latched on to it, but it
[7:54] has latched on to you.
[7:56] It has it has totally Amen. It's it's
[7:58] it's it's saturated every fiber of your
[8:01] being. Amen. So that everything you do
[8:04] is the life of Jesus Christ
[8:07] living itself out of you.
[8:09] Amen. Oh, it is a great contrast to the
[8:12] world today. But you know, and I I just
[8:15] want to take a moment in this. The devil
[8:17] is trying to marginalize us all. He's
[8:21] trying to make everything lukewarm.
[8:23] Amen. He's our dress, our our our
[8:26] testimony, our our conduct, you know,
[8:28] it's almost now to to even pray in
[8:30] public.
[8:32] Amen. But we shouldn't be ashamed.
[8:35] We should be like Daniel that when they
[8:37] said commanded them not to pray to their
[8:39] God the very next morning, the Bible
[8:42] says Daniel didn't change one single
[8:43] thing. He threw those windows open. He
[8:46] sh He He prayed aloud to God. Oh,
[8:48] Father, I thank thee. Amen. He was not a
[8:51] lukewarm Christian. He was not ashamed.
[8:53] He knew his connection to God was the
[8:56] secret to his success. And he said, "I'm
[8:59] not letting any pressure or any power
[9:01] temper. Amen. I'm not changing a thing.
[9:03] I'm going to be just as bold as I've
[9:05] ever been."
[9:06] Well, God was pretty proud of his stand
[9:09] because God, Amen, maintained his
[9:11] identity. He maintained his relationship
[9:14] with Daniel because Daniel understood
[9:16] the source of his strength. And that's
[9:19] the thing, friends. Christians are
[9:22] helpless.
[9:25] Christians, by the world's standards,
[9:27] are mindless.
[9:29] They're weak-minded, pitiful people that
[9:31] are totally dependent
[9:35] on a belief system,
[9:37] on a faith, on a god that to the world
[9:40] is imaginary,
[9:42] but to you and I, it's the only true
[9:44] reality that exists.
[9:46] Why? because we have met him and our
[9:49] lives have been transformed by the power
[9:52] of the almighty God. The same God that
[9:54] spoke to a chaotic creation and said let
[9:57] there be has spoken into our lives and
[10:01] quickened his very life from the midst
[10:03] of our bosom.
[10:05] So we are his exclusively. Amen. We
[10:08] belong to him and we give him all the
[10:10] glory, all the praise for he is our very
[10:13] purpose, our very existence. Amen. Is
[10:15] Christ alone.
[10:17] Amen.
[10:19] Praise the Lord. I don't want to be a
[10:21] casual Christian.
[10:23] Amen.
[10:24] Do you?
[10:26] The next type of Christian
[10:29] I'll call the costume
[10:32] Christian.
[10:34] You know, we just come through Halloween
[10:36] and end of October and you know, it's
[10:39] it's a the roots of that very holiday
[10:42] are in the occult
[10:44] uh Satanism,
[10:47] the dark side of the spiritual realm.
[10:50] And so, you know, I don't know all the
[10:52] roots of it necessarily, but I I'm not
[10:55] too big a fan of dressing up like some
[10:57] goblin or witch or ghost or Hollywood
[11:00] character and going out and passing out
[11:01] candy canes
[11:03] because, you know, when you understand
[11:05] the roots of these things, paganism and
[11:08] heathenism and idolatry, it makes you a
[11:11] little less willing to join on and be
[11:14] identified with it.
[11:16] Amen. I'm I need to be careful. I'm in
[11:18] another man's pulpit and y'all may have
[11:20] a trick-or- treat party here for all I
[11:22] know.
[11:24] But the costume Christian is someone
[11:28] whose Christianity
[11:30] is something they put on and take off.
[11:35] They dress up on Sunday. They go to
[11:37] church. They look and act the part. But
[11:41] just as easily as it is put on, it can
[11:44] be taken off. And sometimes they take it
[11:47] off on the drive home.
[11:51] Someone pulls out in front of them,
[11:53] someone does something in traffic and
[11:54] they, you know, I I years ago there was
[11:56] a a pastor friend of mine. He would tell
[11:58] his grandson says, "Boys, don't lose
[11:59] your religion."
[12:01] You know, they get to fight and they get
[12:02] to argue and he say, "Don't lose your
[12:04] religion, boys." And I thought, "Well,
[12:05] you know, if all that's if that's all
[12:06] you ever got, you need to lose it.
[12:09] If that's all you ever got was something
[12:10] that can so easily be stripped away or
[12:13] taken away or put off of you, you need a
[12:16] real experience.
[12:18] Because too many people are coming to
[12:20] the house of God pretending to be
[12:22] Christians and they've never had the new
[12:24] birth.
[12:25] They've only learned to mimic or to
[12:28] replicate through action what they know
[12:30] God's expectations are. But let me tell
[12:33] you this morning, God doesn't make a
[12:36] requirement without making a way to meet
[12:38] the requirement. God's not expecting you
[12:42] yourself within your own power or your
[12:44] own devices to live up to his
[12:46] expectations. What he's looking for is a
[12:49] surrender
[12:50] where you surrender your life and you
[12:52] die on the same cross that he died on.
[12:56] You die to self. You die to ability. You
[12:59] die to legalism. You die to all of these
[13:01] things that the devil himself can
[13:03] replicate. Amen. Where the very life of
[13:06] Christ
[13:07] comes and lives in through you.
[13:09] That is not so easily taken off.
[13:11] The Lord.
[13:12] Hallelujah. That is not something you
[13:14] you put and hang up in the closet until
[13:17] Wednesday night or until prayer meeting
[13:19] or until it's time to impress the pastor
[13:21] or time to check off the box that you've
[13:23] done your religious duty for the week.
[13:25] friend. I don't want to be that kind of
[13:27] Christian.
[13:28] And I don't want to worship with that
[13:29] kind of Christian.
[13:30] I want to worship with Christians who
[13:32] are Christians in the trenches.
[13:34] Amen. There are Christians in the
[13:35] parade. Amen. They're Christians through
[13:37] and through. Amen. It's not something
[13:39] they put on and take off. Amen. It's who
[13:42] they are. And it is oozing out of every
[13:44] pore of them as sons and daughters of
[13:46] God. Now, I'm going to tell you, you
[13:48] know, to have this, it requires a
[13:50] different diet
[13:53] because the world is all about
[13:55] appearances.
[13:57] And when we the things, and I'm way off
[13:59] my notes here, but when we see brother
[14:01] Benham attacking Hollywood and the
[14:04] spirit of Hollywood,
[14:06] you know, it it wasn't brother Brandham
[14:08] saying if you've got a television in
[14:10] your home, you're going to hell. But
[14:12] what he was I believe what he was seeing
[14:14] was the danger
[14:17] of of of the spirits
[14:20] and televisions, radios, music and even
[14:24] conversation are avenues or channels by
[14:27] which spirits they're they're vehicled
[14:30] through those things.
[14:32] So through there through the through the
[14:34] uh invention of television things were
[14:36] introduced into the home that apart from
[14:40] that screen and speakers would have
[14:43] never been permitted in the home.
[14:45] Adultery Amen. Uh all these things uh
[14:49] cheating, stealing, lying, dishonesty,
[14:51] amen, would have never been permitted in
[14:53] person.
[14:55] But the channel those spirits were
[14:57] channeled through uh visual and audio.
[14:59] Amen. where people became accepting of
[15:02] these things because they took down the
[15:04] barrier and deemed it funny,
[15:08] humorous, or you know that really is how
[15:11] it is at work or that really is how it
[15:15] is. So they they become I don't want to
[15:18] say it softened or or or they become
[15:20] more uh uh
[15:24] desensitized. Yes. It just becomes less
[15:27] offensive because hey, it's the way of
[15:30] the world.
[15:31] We're here in the world. So, we become
[15:34] it becomes less repulsive
[15:38] as a result of it being channelneled in
[15:40] this way. Well, it's a spirit and
[15:42] there's not hard there's hardly one
[15:44] authentic thing in entertainment today.
[15:48] Whether it's music, video, television,
[15:52] sports, almost everything in the world
[15:54] today is acted.
[15:57] It's rehearsed. It's choreographed. It
[16:00] is pre-recorded and played sometimes
[16:02] even with a delay.
[16:05] It's fake.
[16:06] We are living in a world that is propped
[16:09] up
[16:10] by things that have no real authenticity
[16:14] or validity to them.
[16:16] But yet the world gobbles it up.
[16:18] And I know because I'm in sales. I just
[16:20] moved into a sales role and I've learned
[16:22] that people like the salesman who's the
[16:25] best liar.
[16:27] They know he's lying. Yeah, it
[16:29] they're conscious of the fact that what
[16:31] he's saying it could never actually
[16:34] happen in reality, but they like the way
[16:36] he says it. They like the way he spins
[16:38] it. They like the appearance. Amen. They
[16:40] like the way it makes them feel.
[16:45] And as a result of that, they issue a
[16:47] PO.
[16:49] That is so much like the world today.
[16:53] It's all about the way it makes them
[16:55] feel.
[16:56] Well, brother Tim, I I I I like going to
[16:59] that church because yeah, you know, but
[17:02] I just feel so good.
[17:05] Well, you come as you are and leave as
[17:08] you were.
[17:10] But that's not apostolic.
[17:13] That's not what the way I read my Bible.
[17:16] The way I read my Bible is every service
[17:19] should be a transformation.
[17:21] You should You can come in with weights,
[17:23] with cares, with burdens. Amen. With
[17:25] with dirt on your clothes, spiritually
[17:27] speaking. Amen. But you can leave
[17:29] changed. Amen. You can come in with
[17:31] depression and you can leave liberated.
[17:34] Hallelujah. Amen. It should make a
[17:36] difference. Every service with God's
[17:38] power. Amen. Moving and stirring through
[17:41] the service itself. It's a release.
[17:44] Amen. It's a It's a sacrifice of the old
[17:46] you or whatever you came in that door
[17:48] with. And you go out, Amen. with the
[17:51] same anointing, the same radiance of the
[17:53] pillar of fire that was on the prophet
[17:56] because you've met the same God of that
[17:58] prophet.
[17:59] Brother and sister, you can have that
[18:01] every service.
[18:02] You can have that with whoever's
[18:03] standing behind this pullpit. You can
[18:05] have that with whatever songs are sung
[18:07] or whatever musician, what whatever you
[18:09] put into it is what you get out of it.
[18:12] But when you come to the service saying,
[18:13] "This is my service.
[18:15] Amen. This is this is my opportunity.
[18:17] I'm coming in here. I'm going to leave
[18:18] this at the altar and I'm going to go
[18:20] out a free person. Amen.
[18:22] You'll get it.
[18:23] You'll experience.
[18:25] But costume Christians,
[18:28] Achen was a costume Christian. You
[18:32] remember Achen?
[18:34] He kept a Babylonian garment
[18:38] and a golden wedge tucked away in the
[18:41] closet.
[18:42] Now, I'm going out on a bit of a limb
[18:45] here to say this, brother Aaron, but I I
[18:47] I only I can only, you know, speculate
[18:52] as to what the reasons were for Achen
[18:56] having done this.
[18:59] But I would imagine Achen was like so
[19:02] many people that thought, you know
[19:04] something, just in the unlikely event
[19:08] that things ever go south, Okay. Okay.
[19:13] And and and God doesn't vindicate
[19:17] his prophet
[19:19] and his followers
[19:21] like he for all of of of known time up
[19:24] till now has. I've got an out.
[19:29] I've got an escape plan. All I've got to
[19:32] do is slip on this Babylonian garment.
[19:36] And when we're being trounced and
[19:39] destroyed by an enemy army, I'll blend
[19:41] in with the enemy
[19:44] and escape with my life. I'm sure he had
[19:47] all kinds and we have all kinds of
[19:49] rationalizations
[19:51] as to how this is for the good.
[19:54] This is for our posterity. This is for
[19:56] the children. Brother Tim,
[20:01] we don't want them to have to suffer
[20:05] the way we suffer.
[20:09] Why not?
[20:12] If it made you the battle scarred,
[20:16] hardened,
[20:18] devil destroyed Christian you are.
[20:21] Why can't they get the same experience?
[20:24] suffering a little reproach never hurt
[20:26] anybody.
[20:28] Facing some criticism. You know, we uh
[20:31] I'm I'm brother Aaron. You you're going
[20:33] to have to take a few messages to smooth
[20:35] all this up. We had some young people
[20:38] come back from a youth camp and begin
[20:41] facing criticism not from their worldly
[20:43] classmates,
[20:45] from other
[20:46] believing young people.
[20:49] And you know, your first reaction as a a
[20:52] leader or a parent is
[20:54] who dare
[20:56] dare they? But you know what? Then I
[20:59] thought about I thought, no, every
[21:01] Christian
[21:02] all throughout time has had to suffer
[21:06] persecution for the cause of Christ. I'm
[21:09] not dare going to stand in the way of
[21:10] it. They stand for God. God will stand
[21:14] for them. Amen.
[21:16] I may be off the scene one day, brother
[21:17] Aaron, and I won't be there to protect
[21:19] them.
[21:20] And then they're going to need a
[21:21] connection with God.
[21:23] So, it's it's it's high time that they
[21:25] go ahead and learn that serving God
[21:28] costs.
[21:29] Serving God comes at a price. Being
[21:32] identified with the message of the hour
[21:34] comes at a cost. And if you're looking
[21:36] like Achen to get out of that, amen, you
[21:38] may die as a result of your
[21:41] unwillingness, Amen. to be completely,
[21:44] wholly, fully sold out to the cause.
[21:47] Amen. So, I don't want to be a costume
[21:49] Christian this morning. Amen. I don't
[21:51] want it to be something I put on and
[21:53] take off. I want it to be reality.
[21:55] Amen. There was another king. I I I'm
[21:58] I'm slipping here just a bit on memory
[22:00] as to who it was, but I believe it was
[22:02] when uh it was it was when um it Yeah,
[22:05] it was Ahab. Ahab and Jehoshaphat. You
[22:07] remember the story? They were going to
[22:09] join forces and go to battle. But Ahab
[22:11] tells his good old buddy Jehoshaphat,
[22:14] you dress up in your kingly robes,
[22:16] Jehoshaphat, you know, be be clearly
[22:19] identifiable from maybe a mile or so
[22:21] away as a king of of Israel or king of
[22:24] Judah, and I will disguise myself.
[22:28] Yeah.
[22:29] Because Ahab was under a prophecy that
[22:33] his life was going to end
[22:35] and the dogs were blood. Let me tell you
[22:38] this morning, you're not going to escape
[22:39] prophecy.
[22:41] It's coming to pass.
[22:42] And your efforts, amen, to thwart it are
[22:45] only going to fulfill it.
[22:48] You better understand what God has sent
[22:50] in this hour was not the thoughts of a
[22:52] man. It wasn't the ideas of a man. It
[22:54] wasn't something William Brandham
[22:56] concocted with a seventh grade
[22:57] education. It was the voice of God. God
[23:01] spoke through the lips of his prophet.
[23:02] And it didn't stop there. Amen. Just
[23:05] like Elijah, he said, "God, only I am
[23:07] left." He said, "Oh, no. There's 7,000
[23:10] that have not bowed to need a bell." God
[23:13] has called some believers who accept the
[23:15] message of the hour as God's very voice.
[23:18] And they are the echo. Amen. They are
[23:20] the extension of that voice.
[23:23] Amen. And Ahab died that day in his
[23:25] disguise
[23:26] because the arrow of prophecy smoked
[23:29] him.
[23:30] And he died to fulfill prophecy. Amen. I
[23:35] want to fulfill the other side of it.
[23:38] Amen. Fulfill the other side of it.
[23:41] Throw Jezebel down.
[23:44] Who is on the Lord's side?
[23:48] You know, and brother Erin, I'm way off.
[23:50] I'm just a little bit scattered this
[23:52] morning, but I feel real good here.
[23:54] I feel like I'm right at home. Have we
[23:56] been together before? Was it in the mind
[23:58] of God before the foundation of the
[24:00] world when the morning stars sang
[24:02] together and the sons of God shouted for
[24:04] joy? Well, then this is just a family
[24:06] reunion this morning. Amen. And we're
[24:08] going to resume this really soon in
[24:09] eternity and never have to say goodbye
[24:11] again.
[24:13] Oh my friends.
[24:20] Let me move on.
[24:23] There's another kind of Christian and
[24:25] this is the kind I want to be. And no
[24:28] doubt you do too. The contagious
[24:32] Christian.
[24:35] The kind of Christian that everybody
[24:37] knows there goes a real son of God,
[24:42] a real daughter of God. Amen. You know,
[24:45] I realize, friend, again, I I want to
[24:47] keep this balanced. I realize there are
[24:49] people that wear their Christianity like
[24:51] a boy scout patch,
[24:55] right? They they want to be branded. Oh,
[24:57] and it's not just Christianity. It's
[24:59] even so-called message believers.
[25:01] They want to wear a pin. They want to
[25:02] wear something that identifies with with
[25:04] a certain sect
[25:06] of message believers. Friend, we ought
[25:09] to be we ought to outgrow that.
[25:12] We ought to outgrow that.
[25:14] Your pin, your badge, your patch can be
[25:18] put on or taken off.
[25:21] But the bleeding blood,
[25:24] the bloody word that the bride has been
[25:26] washed in,
[25:28] is a stain remover
[25:30] and it's an irreovable stain.
[25:34] Amen.
[25:35] Amen. It'll wash all your sins away.
[25:37] Amen. But it will it will permanently
[25:40] encase you or ent trap you. Amen. It's a
[25:43] shroud that envelops every Christian.
[25:47] It's the secret place that David spoke
[25:49] of in the rapture. He shall hide me.
[25:53] Amen. We're hidden in Christ. We are
[25:56] enveloped. We are enshrouded in his
[25:58] glory. And to the world, we look like a
[26:00] mystic. Amen. But we're sealed and we're
[26:03] waiting for his return. At which point,
[26:06] amen, our bodies will be transformed
[26:08] into glorified bodies. And we'll go to
[26:10] meet him in the air.
[26:12] Amen. Let me read in first Peter. Uh let
[26:16] let me turn to a few places in the
[26:18] scripture. I'm doing all right on time.
[26:20] I believe
[26:21] it's it's only uh well it's 1:00 back
[26:23] home so I should be dismissing
[26:26] back east. But let's go to Acts 5:1 17.
[26:30] I believe it's important that you have a
[26:32] foundation in the scriptures and John
[26:34] not just to believe it because brother
[26:36] Aaron said it or brother Tim said it but
[26:38] you need to understand it all sources
[26:40] from right here
[26:42] even the message I was listening brother
[26:43] Brandham preach the five definite
[26:45] identifications of the of the living
[26:47] church and he said I'm this is coming
[26:49] right out of scripture
[26:51] and I thought but but brother Brandham
[26:54] they didn't have the same lens
[26:57] that you have as a prophet so when He's
[26:59] looking in those scriptures. The
[27:01] scriptures are coming out in 3D and he's
[27:04] saying, "This is today. This is who this
[27:06] is. This is what that is." See, with
[27:08] that prophetic gift, well, we look
[27:10] through that same lens
[27:12] and we don't try to add another filter
[27:14] to it. We look at it through that
[27:16] prophetic lens and it makes the word
[27:18] come out in 3D to you and I. So, Acts
[27:21] 5:1 17.
[27:32] Then the high priest rose up, and all
[27:35] they that were with him, which is of the
[27:36] sect of the Sadducees, and were filled
[27:38] with indignation, and they laid their
[27:41] hands on the apostles, and put them in
[27:42] the common prison. But the angel of the
[27:45] Lord by night opened the doors, opened
[27:47] the prison doors, and brought them
[27:48] forth, and said, "Go stand and speak in
[27:53] the temple to all the people, to the
[27:56] people, excuse me, all the words of this
[27:59] life."
[28:02] And when they had heard that, they
[28:04] entered into the temple early in the
[28:06] morning, and taught. But the high priest
[28:08] came, and they that were with him, and
[28:10] called the council together, and all the
[28:12] senate of the children of Israel, and
[28:15] sent to the prison to have them brought.
[28:18] But when the officers came, they found
[28:21] them not in the prison.
[28:25] They they came and found them not in the
[28:27] prison, they returned and told, saying,
[28:28] "The prison truly found we shut with all
[28:31] safety, and the keeper standing without
[28:34] before the doors. But when we'd opened,
[28:36] we found no man within.
[28:40] Now when the high priest and the captain
[28:42] of the temple and the chief priests
[28:43] heard these things, they doubted of them
[28:46] where unto this would grow.
[28:49] Then uh they then came one and told
[28:52] them, saying, excuse me, then went the
[28:54] captain with the officers and brought
[28:56] them without violence, for they feared
[28:58] the people, lest they should have been
[29:00] stoned. Their witness
[29:03] was so powerful.
[29:06] It was shaking.
[29:08] The the the foundations of every world
[29:12] empire were shaking
[29:15] because of what God was doing through a
[29:17] handful
[29:19] of believers.
[29:20] the established government, the
[29:23] established uh military, political,
[29:27] economic, and ecclesiastical powers
[29:31] were having their very foundations
[29:34] shaken
[29:36] by a couple hundred believers.
[29:42] Where are we, church?
[29:45] The move is on
[29:48] for the bride. Amen.
[29:50] The pillar of fire is moving
[29:53] and the children of God are following
[29:56] the pillar of fire,
[29:57] right?
[29:58] They're not following a man. They're not
[30:00] following a personality. They're not
[30:01] following a movement that men formed.
[30:05] To be a tribute or a legacy to some
[30:08] other man. They're following the pillar
[30:10] of fire.
[30:11] And as a result of that, God is moving
[30:14] and God is shaking the very foundations
[30:16] of hell.
[30:19] And when they when they brought them,
[30:21] verse 27, they set them before the
[30:23] council, and the high priest asked them,
[30:24] saying, "Did not we straightly command
[30:27] you that ye should not teach in this
[30:30] name? And behold, you have filled
[30:33] Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend
[30:38] to bring this man's blood on us."
[30:42] It was already done.
[30:45] These men weren't guilting them. It was
[30:48] their own conscience.
[30:52] That was tugging on them. Every time
[30:55] these men preached and every time these
[30:57] Christians walked out the door of their
[30:59] homes, their lives were bringing
[31:03] conviction
[31:05] on those who were guilty of the
[31:07] crucifixion of the Lord.
[31:10] It's unavoidable, friend. Just by virtue
[31:13] of the fact that you breathe and have
[31:16] blood pressure
[31:19] is a rebuke to Satan.
[31:21] It brings conviction. It just by
[31:24] contrast of the life that's living
[31:26] itself through you. That's what causes
[31:28] the awkwardness. That's what causes the
[31:31] tensions. That's what causes others to,
[31:33] you know, migrate another direction when
[31:35] you walk in the room.
[31:37] But one day and some way, God will use
[31:41] that same power to attract
[31:44] those other remaining members of this
[31:46] body who have yet to experience what you
[31:49] experience. And when the last one comes
[31:51] in, we're all going home.
[31:54] So, what I'm saying is keep living it.
[31:56] Keep You're just a conduit, friend,
[31:59] for God to flow through. And the wider
[32:02] you can open your heart, the more God
[32:04] that can come through you out to others.
[32:06] Is that right?
[32:08] Did we not straightly command you? You
[32:11] have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine
[32:12] and intend to bring this man's blood
[32:14] upon us. Then Peter and the other
[32:17] apostles answered and said, "We ought to
[32:20] obey God
[32:22] rather than men."
[32:25] The God of our fathers raised up Jesus,
[32:28] whom you slew and hanged upon a tree.
[32:30] Him hath God exalted with his right hand
[32:33] to be a prince and a savior, and to give
[32:36] repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of
[32:38] sins. And we are his witnesses of these
[32:44] things.
[32:45] And so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God
[32:48] hath given to them that obey him.
[32:51] Amen. We're witnesses this morning.
[32:53] Amen. I want to I want to say this with
[32:55] all due respects to all of the great
[32:58] pioneers that God has used to make us
[33:00] make the way for us to be here today.
[33:03] Amen. William Brandham was a witness.
[33:05] Amen. The men who lived in his time and
[33:07] saw that. Amen. And embraced it. Amen.
[33:10] And were joined to it to carry that
[33:12] witness on. Many of those men are going
[33:14] by the way of the grave. But they are
[33:16] not the only witnesses. The witness of
[33:19] God is still in the earth today. Amen.
[33:21] through a people whom the same power has
[33:24] transformed their lives.
[33:25] Amen. Oh my. First Peter, I'm I'm I'm
[33:28] trying to find a stopping place here.
[33:31] 1 Peter chapter 3.
[33:38] 1 Peter chapter 3.
[33:41] Now,
[33:45] just bear with me here and and and read
[33:47] this. Read yourself into this.
[33:52] Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to
[33:55] your own husbands, that if any obey not
[33:59] the word,
[34:01] they also may without the word
[34:05] be one by the conversation
[34:08] of the wives. Now, we know conversation
[34:11] isn't just what you say with your lips.
[34:13] Conversation deals with your manner of
[34:16] life.
[34:17] The way you live says something.
[34:21] The way you live speak something whether
[34:24] you open your mouth or not. Right? While
[34:29] they behold your chasteed conversation
[34:32] coupled with fear whose adorning, let it
[34:35] not be that outward adorning of plating
[34:37] the hair and of wearing of gold or of
[34:39] putting on of apparel. See, Paul is
[34:42] preaching the message I'm preaching.
[34:45] It's not in the appearances. It's not in
[34:47] the looks that
[34:50] it has an effect on that. But that isn't
[34:54] the driver. The driver is what's on the
[34:58] inside
[35:00] flowing out through your appearance and
[35:03] your dress and your hair and your
[35:04] jewelry and all of these things.
[35:07] Let it be, verse four, the hidden man of
[35:10] the heart, and that which is not
[35:14] corruptible, even the ornament of a meek
[35:17] and quiet spirit, which is in the sight
[35:20] of God of great price. And the story
[35:23] that comes to mind here is the little
[35:25] woman whose husband was a drunk or like
[35:30] to corral, you know, go with the guys
[35:32] after work and have a beer together. And
[35:34] in the at the bar,
[35:36] somebody says, you know, there's no such
[35:38] a thing as a genuine Christian anymore.
[35:40] They're all hypocrites. They all dress
[35:42] up, go to church on Sunday morning, then
[35:43] they lie, cuss, and steal. There there's
[35:45] a brother here, and I'm just going to
[35:48] break every rule. And there's a joke
[35:51] back from from where I from the
[35:54] Carolinas about a man who took his
[35:56] parrot with him to the grocery store and
[35:59] said, "Parrot, uh, this is grocery
[36:01] store." store and a parrot said grocery
[36:02] store, grocery store. And then he took
[36:04] him to the post office. He said, "Parro,
[36:06] this is post office." And he said, "Post
[36:07] office, post office." Then he took the
[36:09] parrot to the club, the nightclub on on
[36:12] Saturday night. He said, "Uh, Mr.
[36:13] Parrot, this is the nightclub where we
[36:15] all come and party and spend all the
[36:17] money we earned Monday through Friday."
[36:19] And the parrot says, "Night club?
[36:20] Nightclub." Well, then the man shows up
[36:22] in church the next morning. Oh dear.
[36:24] And said, "Parro,
[36:26] this is church."
[36:29] And the parents said, "Same crowd.
[36:33] Same crowd."
[36:35] That's not what we want. That's a pretty
[36:37] extreme example, right?
[36:40] But that's the way the world looks at
[36:42] many Christians
[36:44] is it's just a social network. They're
[36:46] just posers. They don't have any
[36:48] reality. They they cuss, they lie, they
[36:50] steal, they desire the same things we
[36:52] desire. They just, you know, they say if
[36:54] if you ever go fishing, don't take just
[36:56] one Baptist or he'll drink all the beer.
[37:00] That's the truth. They just convict each
[37:03] other because there's no real conviction
[37:06] down on the inside. Amen. To take that
[37:08] desire away and let the life of Jesus
[37:11] Christ live from the inside.
[37:14] Amen. I'm sorry, but there you can
[37:16] you'll spend a lot of time patching this
[37:19] all up,
[37:21] but this man at the bar said, "I take
[37:24] exception.
[37:26] I know a true Christian.
[37:29] I know a real Christian.
[37:32] And right now we can go and see." He
[37:36] took his buddies, drug him into that to
[37:38] the home that late night. Here's a wife,
[37:41] you know, gets up to welcome them in the
[37:43] door and he says, "Oh, honey, you know,
[37:44] you know the story. Make me some
[37:46] breakfast." And threw the eggs on the
[37:48] floor, threw everything, made a big
[37:49] scene. She just went right back over to
[37:51] the stove. Must Jesus
[37:54] bear the cross alone.
[37:59] And oh, see, it was a real life. And she
[38:03] was praying for the salvation of her
[38:05] husband. And she had faith and
[38:09] persistence.
[38:10] If I can just maintain what I have, one
[38:14] day there's going to be a breakthrough.
[38:17] Brother, sister, one day there's going
[38:19] to be a breakthrough. You just keep
[38:22] pressing. You just keep believing. Amen.
[38:24] You put one foot in front of the other.
[38:26] Keep your mind, keep your face, Amen.
[38:28] Keep your direction set on Calvary.
[38:30] Amen. And one day the reality that holds
[38:33] you, Amen, will grip them also.
[38:36] Amen. And that man and his buddies
[38:37] looked said, "That's a real Christian."
[38:39] And that night, she led him and his
[38:41] cohorts to a real Amen. A real meeting
[38:44] with the same one that she had met so
[38:46] many years ago.
[38:47] Amen.
[38:49] Now, the contagious Christian,
[38:54] it's contagious. And there ain't no
[38:56] inoculation
[38:59] that can can make you safe against it.
[39:02] If you ever really get in contact with a
[39:05] real firebranded son and daughter of
[39:07] God, it'll light your candle or relight
[39:11] it,
[39:12] it'll make you want the God that they
[39:15] serve.
[39:16] It'll make you desire. You know, we've
[39:17] all experienced that. Amen. On your
[39:20] conversion. Amen. the person who led you
[39:22] to the Lord or the person, Amen, who
[39:24] just every time you get around them, you
[39:27] just enjoy that fellowship because you
[39:29] know they're not talking about the
[39:31] scores or they're not talking about this
[39:33] or that. Amen. They're they're just
[39:35] there's something it's not a glitter,
[39:37] it's not a glamour, it's a glow.
[39:40] It's got a it's got a radiant warmth
[39:42] that just comes out of them and and
[39:45] flows over you, too.
[39:47] And I'm going to just take a moment here
[39:49] and read from the Patmas vision where
[39:52] brother Ben's talking about the the
[39:53] candlestick and and the lampstand and he
[39:55] says how beautiful when speaking of John
[39:59] when he turned he saw this one like the
[40:02] son of man standing in the midst of the
[40:06] seven golden lampstands. You know that's
[40:08] the same one Nebuchadnezzar saw in the
[40:11] fire. Amen.
[40:13] Now, John is seeing him standing in his
[40:17] church,
[40:19] his redeemed body on the earth,
[40:22] has God's very glory in the midst of
[40:25] her.
[40:28] And the lampstand was hooked to I'm just
[40:30] skipping through this, you understand
[40:31] for time, hooked into this big main oil
[40:34] sensor. And this oil come forth up to a
[40:37] little odd-shaped lamp that set with a
[40:39] wick in it. and the wick hung down into
[40:43] the oil. They poured oil into the top of
[40:46] the stand which filled up this big main
[40:48] stem and the big branch and it run out
[40:50] into the stems like this. And the lamp
[40:53] with the wick hanging down this piping
[40:56] kept burning day and night. You never
[41:01] had to light it. It never went out.
[41:05] That's a contagious Christian. You see,
[41:07] they just kept pouring oil in the main
[41:08] pipe. And these lampstands that come out
[41:10] like this had the lamp sitting on top of
[41:12] them. The lamp, the wick from the lamp
[41:15] run down into here got its life out of
[41:18] here. The secret to this, friends, is
[41:20] keep your wick dipped in the oil.
[41:24] Begin your day with prayer and with
[41:27] hearing the word of God. Amen. Get your
[41:30] wick real saturated
[41:32] so you can burn all day long. And you
[41:35] know what? You got to take another dip
[41:36] on lunch break or another dip in the
[41:39] evening time. That's fine. Just whatever
[41:41] it takes. It It may be a high
[41:43] consumption day when the boss and the
[41:45] family and the traffic and everything
[41:47] else is really that candle's really
[41:49] burning. But you know, we've got a
[41:51] supply. Amen. That we can carry with us.
[41:54] Even if you can't carry a Bible anymore,
[41:56] you can have it on your phone
[41:57] and you can just dip in there or you can
[41:59] just say, you know what? I need to take
[42:00] a moment and get aside. Go into the
[42:02] restroom. I don't care. You can make any
[42:04] room a prayer room and say, "Lord Jesus,
[42:06] Amen. Just recharge me right now, Lord.
[42:08] I feel myself getting a little low. God,
[42:10] I want to recharge." Amen.
[42:12] Hallelujah. These lampstands of fire
[42:15] that was on these lampstands in the Old
[42:16] Testament, when they lit one lamp, they
[42:19] could not light the next lamp with the
[42:21] same fire they had in their hand. They
[42:23] lit one lamp, then picked it up and lit
[42:26] the other lamp.
[42:28] Amen. That's how the fire spreads,
[42:30] brother, sister. Amen. And then that
[42:32] lamb took this lamp and the same fire
[42:35] that they started at the beginning.
[42:38] I want to tell you friend, what fell on
[42:40] Acts 2:38 is the same fire that fills
[42:42] every individual son and daughter of God
[42:44] today. Amen. It may express itself in in
[42:47] manifold ways, but it is the same fire.
[42:50] Amen. Oh, I hope it don't go over your
[42:52] head. Jesus Christ, the same the same
[42:57] yesterday, today, and forever. The same
[42:59] fire, the Holy Ghost, lit every one of
[43:02] those churches right down through the
[43:04] ages.
[43:05] Can I continue?
[43:07] These lamp stems all fit into one great
[43:09] big bowl, one great big holder, and
[43:12] seven different lamp holders came out of
[43:13] that. When they did, each one of those
[43:15] lights was drawing from the main
[43:17] resource of its life. And its light was
[43:20] because it had its candle dipped down in
[43:23] this main barrel. Oh, what a beautiful
[43:25] picture of one of those seven stars that
[43:27] represented that with his life on fire
[43:30] with the Holy Ghost by faith. He's
[43:33] burning with the Holy Ghost. And his
[43:36] life is a candle or not a candle, but a
[43:39] wick that's been dipped into the Holy
[43:41] Spirit into Christ. And through that
[43:44] wick, he's drawing the life of God out
[43:48] to give light to his church.
[43:51] See, that wasn't just speaking of
[43:53] messengers.
[43:54] That was speaking of members.
[43:57] Other members are lit by your fire.
[44:00] Like Philillip uh Philip and and
[44:04] Ethiopian, he left the revival to take
[44:07] the fire to the Ethiopian unic. And when
[44:11] his lamp got lit, he went back and
[44:14] joined the revival.
[44:15] See, see friend, the revival isn't a
[44:18] church,
[44:18] right? The revival isn't a ministry of a
[44:21] man.
[44:22] The revival is a individual fire
[44:26] burning in your heart and you are the
[44:29] revival.
[44:30] You know, just like the the Welch police
[44:32] officer, he said, "If you're looking for
[44:34] the revival, you found it."
[44:36] If you're looking for the rapture,
[44:38] friend,
[44:39] it's not in one geographical location.
[44:42] It's not in in tangible material. It's
[44:45] in a people
[44:47] who are the body of the rapture.
[44:50] Amen. Oh my. There's just so many things
[44:52] that could be said. I can't preach it
[44:54] all in one service. But let's let's
[44:56] let's go through. Oh, what a picture of
[44:58] the true believer. What kind of light
[45:00] he's giving the same kind of light that
[45:03] was when the first candle was lit. Oh
[45:06] my.
[45:07] You are dead and your life is hid in
[45:10] Christ. Hid in God through Christ and
[45:12] sealed by the Holy Spirit. There's no
[45:15] way at all to ever get you away from
[45:17] there. How can you do it? Nobody can
[45:21] tamper with you.
[45:23] I love that.
[45:25] Nobody can tamper with you.
[45:28] The end of your life is burning with the
[45:31] Holy Ghost. Burning, giving light.
[45:33] Where's the other end of your life
[45:35] dipped? Into Christ.
[45:38] You are dead and hidden in Christ. The
[45:40] Holy Ghost is blocking it off there that
[45:43] you can the devil can't touch you. You
[45:46] talk about being invincible, friend. You
[45:48] talk about being inoculated. Amen. Amen.
[45:51] You're so full of God. Amen. That you
[45:53] would convert the devil if he'd just get
[45:55] close enough. That's the kind of
[45:57] contagious Christian that every true
[45:59] born again son and daughter of God ought
[46:01] to be.
[46:02] Amen. You say, "Brother Tim, that's pie
[46:04] in the sky and sweet." Oh, no. It's a
[46:06] reality.
[46:07] To the real Christian, Amen. That's
[46:09] that's who they are. The devil can't
[46:12] touch you. He can whiz and make a noise.
[46:14] Even death itself can't touch you.
[46:18] Oh death, where is thy sting? Where is
[46:20] thy victory? Thanks be to God who gives
[46:23] us the victory through our Lord Jesus
[46:25] Christ.
[46:26] Let me tell you friend, one of and I am
[46:29] closing.
[46:31] One of the most uh
[46:33] one of the most dangerous things we've
[46:35] got to be guarded against is common.
[46:40] Common.
[46:41] When the things that once meant so much
[46:44] to us become common
[46:48] because they become repetitive
[46:52] and and and our expectation honestly
[46:55] dwindles
[46:57] with time because it's become common to
[47:00] us. People become common to us. You
[47:04] know, I I when a when a when a new
[47:06] church is formed or or or a church
[47:08] that's waiting for a a replacement
[47:10] pastor, you know, there's there's
[47:12] enthusiasm, there's excitement, there's
[47:14] energy, there's all these things around
[47:16] because it's new
[47:18] and just new itself
[47:22] has has a value to it, but it quickly
[47:25] fades
[47:26] when it becomes common. and even our
[47:30] relationship with the Lord things can
[47:33] become common
[47:35] and it's almost like we just expect God
[47:38] to do these things but friends God is
[47:40] expecting something from us also
[47:43] and so I I I think you know the eagle
[47:46] they that wait upon the Lord
[47:48] shall renew their strength
[47:52] they shall mount up with wings as the
[47:54] eagles every Christian goes through
[47:57] seasons
[47:59] Amen. Where they grow stale. Things
[48:02] become common. They they just drift or
[48:05] or or they go to a low eb. But every
[48:08] Christian is promised revival too
[48:11] where their fire can be rekindled. They
[48:14] can be they mean the wick can be trimmed
[48:16] or they can be dipped into the oil a new
[48:18] again. And and your salvation. Amen.
[48:22] your testimony, everything can take on
[48:24] an even greater meaning through this
[48:28] refreshing that comes by the Holy
[48:31] Spirit. And I just want to say this this
[48:32] morning. It sounds cliche, but it's not.
[48:35] The Holy Ghost is the cure for the
[48:38] common Christian.
[48:42] Not only are you promised an initial
[48:44] feeling, you are promised a refilling.
[48:47] You say, "How often, Brother Tim?" "As
[48:50] often as you need it.
[48:52] As often as you realize, Lord, I need
[48:54] another dip.
[48:55] I need another outpouring. Lord, Lord, I
[48:57] need to reconsecrate myself, rededicate
[49:00] myself. Lord, I need to tighten up. I
[49:03] need to lay some things aside that have
[49:06] crept into my life as distractions. I
[49:09] don't want Amen. I don't want my
[49:11] testimony. I don't want my experience. I
[49:13] don't want what you've done, Lord, to
[49:14] become common to me. I don't want church
[49:17] services to become common to me. I don't
[49:19] want the pastor. I don't I don't want my
[49:21] brothers, my sisters to become common to
[49:23] me, Lord. I want you to restore the new
[49:26] again. Amen. I want to be recharged.
[49:28] Amen. I want to experience you in such a
[49:30] way, Lord. So, I'm not just talking
[49:32] about what you did through the prophet,
[49:34] but I too have met the burning bush and
[49:36] I'm glowing with the same radiance.
[49:39] Amen.
[49:40] Brother and sister, that's what we've
[49:41] been promised.
[49:42] This is what we You talk about
[49:44] entitlement. We are entitled to a
[49:47] refreshing of the Holy Ghost. Amen. with
[49:49] this message is not a memory. It's not a
[49:51] monument to a man. It's a movement where
[49:54] God's power is coming into his word.
[49:56] Amen. As it fills every fiber of our
[49:59] being,
[50:00] we're going out into the world. Amen. As
[50:02] conquerors,
[50:03] as overcomers,
[50:05] Amen. It's yours this morning
[50:08] for the more contagious than CO.
[50:12] It can't be stomped out or stamped out.
[50:15] It can be spread.
[50:17] Amen. And it's like, you know, back east
[50:19] we have these things called dandelions.
[50:21] And they're actually a weed. You don't
[50:24] want them in your yard cuz they'll
[50:25] overtake and and take take the place of
[50:27] the grass. And I know grass is something
[50:30] that y'all really treasure out here,
[50:34] especially if you got that fake grass
[50:35] that with a 10-year warranty.
[50:40] But you know something? Weeds are always
[50:42] trying to overtake our lives.
[50:45] And I noticed this. We we used to live
[50:47] on a little place. We didn't own it. It
[50:49] was about 68 acres and and had about an
[50:51] acre and a half pond.
[50:54] Every time I mowed the grass, I had to
[50:56] get a few inches into the weeds and the
[51:00] thorns and the thistles just to keep the
[51:03] grass I had the week before.
[51:06] I thought if that's true in the natural,
[51:08] it's true in the spiritual.
[51:11] If we're not constantly on the
[51:13] offensive,
[51:17] taking what's ours
[51:20] and keeping what's ours and maintaining
[51:22] what's ours because the devil's always
[51:24] trying to
[51:25] crowd in just a few inches at a time.
[51:29] Just a few inches a week, but next thing
[51:31] you know, those weeds and those brambles
[51:34] will be right up to your doorstep
[51:36] and you can't do anything without being
[51:38] impacted by it.
[51:40] So, thank God the Holy Spirit
[51:43] can show us how to push back
[51:46] and reestablish our territory. But this
[51:49] little dandelion, I like this about it.
[51:52] You'll come across that, Brother Aaron,
[51:55] with your big, you know, I've got, I
[51:57] think, a 48 inch deck on my riding
[51:59] mower. I don't have the zero turn yet.
[52:01] I'm an evangelist, not a pastor, so I
[52:03] can't afford to zero turn just yet. Just
[52:05] joking, folks.
[52:08] friend, I didn't get rich preaching the
[52:10] gospel and I don't have plans to. But
[52:12] when you go over that thing with the
[52:14] Moore, you think, "I'm going to
[52:14] exterminate it. I'm going to cut it
[52:16] down. I'm going to abolish it." All it
[52:18] does is spread it.
[52:21] The moment you hit that little dandy
[52:22] line, about a thousand little dandelines
[52:27] just go over. That's a contagious
[52:29] Christian.
[52:30] Every time the devil tries to mow you
[52:32] down, it just spreads it a little
[52:35] further.
[52:35] There you go. Every time the devil
[52:37] stomps on you, stamps on you, punches at
[52:40] you, waves you in any way, the winds of
[52:43] change and the winds of diversity, the
[52:45] winds of adversity,
[52:47] just blow a little more across
[52:49] to spread it out. Lord, that's the kind
[52:52] of Christian.
[52:53] That's the kind of Christian I desire to
[52:55] be. Is that your desire this morning?
[52:57] Why don't we stand together?
