TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we've mentioned previously last couple Services we're ministering on the subject of the house of the Lord and there's a lot of different things that we could note in this a lot of ways that we could take and so we're just going to take our time service by service to look at a few of these things and uh tonight our title is in particular a home with three rooms U those that are students of the message probably going to get way ahead of me uh but we're just going to call it tonight the a home with three rooms as we've been looking at psalms 27 a lot of Rich principles in that that we could gather from um lovely thoughts and precepts even the entire chapter just ministers to us so much but in Psalms chapter 27:4 David is speaking of this one thing that he desired and that one thing desired he would seek after and he uses this language that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life and to behold the beauty of the Lord to inquire in his Temple he's using a very specific language and it paints a beautiful picture and it actually kind of sets before us a lot of images and characteristics of the house of the Lord that if it's going to be the house of the Lord it has to be a place of his Beauty if it's the house of the Lord It's a place to inquire a place to seek and so there's a lot of things in that and one of the things that we've tried to emphasize even from David's longing is it was a place that he desired Above All Else and so that makes it a really remarkable place if he wanted to be somewhere like oh there's no place like home and he'd want to be home or there's no place like Bethlehem there's no place like this no he said I want to be in the house of the Lord and as we just try to maybe just bite some pieces off just little by little instead of just you know maybe trying to drill down on one piece but just take different pieces here and there the the temple itself told the tells the story of redemption that you you look at and its elements and all its fixtures and all its amenities and the way that God designed it it's telling a story and God intended it that way it's not just beautiful beautiful in itself though it is it but there's more to it just like the heavens we look at the heavens and we're in awe of how great it is and how vast it is but God's using it to tell a story and so the Tabernacle and the temple tell the story of redemption so it itself represents something even greater than itself uh it holds a pattern that's instructive to us today as we've even mentioned on Sunday that the the house of the Lord was not in heaven it was in a very specific place and well where do we seek it now where do we find the house of the Lord and kind of what I'm tracking is that we can look back at the the house of the Lord in the Old Testament and it's pointing us to where the house of the Lord can be found today now in Exodus 25: 8-9 I think my throat kind of caught with some other people I hung out with Brother John too long and I'm mimicking his voice tonight but no just different ones I know some people are at home tonight we got noticed that they weren't feeling well and um I know some people have just lost their voice and so if I feel a little little rough tonight just thank God your pastor finally sounds like a preacher and if I get going I'll really sound like man he's really saying something tonight and it'll sound good so in Exodus chapter 25 and uh again I apologize if some of the slides aren't there I again I was taking some things out this afternoon just to consolidate and hold some things over to Sunday but in Exodus chapter 25: 8-9 it says and let them make me a sanctuary and now God speaking that I may dwell among them this is the purpose of this edifice this is the purpose of the the Tabernacle according to all that I show thee after the pattern of the Tabernacle and the pattern of all the instruments thereof even so shall you make it we know in the New Testament Paul picks up a similar language saying these things these sacrifices and all these things related to the Levites and their Ministry and the temple was uh pointing to something it was a pattern it was foreshadowing and here God says according to the things that I show you and the pattern I show you build this place he calls it a sanctuary that I may dwell among you even the phrase Sanctuary means a sacred place and so this was a place so that God could live among Israel catch that that that meaning he said he just doesn't say well I'll be amongst you in the trees and I'll be with you in the Sun and I'll be with you and kind of like this um ancient way we think sometimes of like an inner or living force that people ascribe to Mother Nature and just even our bodies it was beyond that very specific place with a very specific blueprint and arrangements for God to live among Israel and it's that I may dwell it was a dwelling place so God said I'm going to make this where I live if God was to get an ID there in in Israel this was the address it would be at it was it was something very specific and then in Revelations 11: 19 it says and the temple of God was opened in heaven and I would say that you have to look at this is not just um Heaven opening up but it says that something in heaven something in heaven is opened the temple of God was opened in heaven so we're not just viewing into heaven but something in heaven opens and there was seen in his Temple the Ark of his Testament so there's Heaven John has already entered into heaven now within in heaven there's the temple of God that opens up so there's something in heaven that opens and he says he see in his Temple the Ark of his Testament there's the Ark of the Covenant and there were Lightnings and voices and thunderings and an earthquake and a great hail and it's not uh hail is in Hil to the victors it's actually like a hail storm but this is opened up in heaven the temple of God has open in heaven the temple and the Ark of his Testament and then with it with this opening there's Lightnings and voices and thunderings and an earthquake and a hell storm so these are all elements now that we can begin to see that are recognized when something like this is opened up and for some of you who like kind of stra scratch your message the theology itch there's a lot there to feed on a little bit and so we see again what Moses saw in heaven with the pattern we see this image in heaven it says the temple of God opened in heaven and then there's a tabernacle that's being built on Earth as we read in Exodus 25 now if you turn to Exodus excuse me acts 7: 44- 49 uh this is uh this will bring together a lot of thoughts for us in one place it says our fathers had the Tabernacle of witness in the wilderness as he appointed speaking unto Moses that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen you see how that's almost specifically uh I would say word for word but it's paraphrasing and repeating what we even read in Exodus 25 which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus and that might cause some of you to think wait a minute what's going on here but this is we know the Greek for Jesus is Jo or for Joshua is Jesus and so that was brought in with Joshua into the possession of the Gentiles whom God drave out before the face of our fathers under the days of David so there's the image of the Tabernacle of witness in the wilderness that Moses had seen in heaven he made a representation on Earth and then the Ark of the Covenant was carried into Israel by Jos UA into the land of the Philistines and the Gentiles and that the Lord was going to give them as a possession and the Ark remained there until the days of David so you can see the story that's being told just a great overview for us then David verse 46 who found favor before God and desired to find a tabernacle for the god of Jacob so there is the Tabernacle of witness in the wilderness that would would have housed the Ark of the Covenant now David looks at this and says I want there to be a tabernacle for God I I more than just this Tabernacle of witness but I want I want a tabernacle for God verse 47 but Solomon built him a house that's not saying that David desired one thing and Solomon built something else David desired to build it but it's Solomon that built it David desired a house for God a permanent dwelling and it's Solomon that builds it and then this uh reciting of even what is said in Isaiah how be it the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands now this is uh maybe a perplexing statement considering all the history we're given and the language that we have ascribed to it that make me a place so I can dwell among you so I can live among you and and what David desired with Solomon bill but now it's like God doesn't dwell in temples made with hands but he did didn't he so it's not it's it's not a statement of contradiction it's more a statement of what God's ultimate purpose and desire was and what he longed for and it says that as it says Heaven is my throne and Earth is my foot stol and it it's basically saying that nothing can contain God adequately and what house will ye build me if I if I'm not made to dwell in temples that are made by hands if I'm not I don't dwell in temples made with hands but what house will you build me sayi the Lord or what is the place of my rest wonderfully thought-provoking statements and question about God and his character what he values and what he's looking for was it was it just a tent was it just an address was it a place that he keep identified with or was there something in the heart of God that he's longing for that is being represented in these things as we asked on Sunday where is the house of the Lord today and maybe there's some of us that would like to say it's right here 3736 West Walla right like this is this is the house of the Lord but uh that wouldn't really satisfy right because this is a house of worship and this is a church a local church and we feel that we're part of this body Where We Gather and it's it represents something and we could call it the house of the Lord we could call it a House of Prayer a house of worship h h a house of correction and all those different things but even this is only pointing to something greater it represents even something Beyond this is not the ultimate and I know I keep reminding you of that not that it would tip the other way and I don't see you anymore but this is definitely not the ultimate but we lift up the ultimate here now as we're reading inight chapter 7 you'll find that there is a transition from Tabernacle to Temple and I'm hoping tonight to uh remind you of things that we already know but maybe get real strict in our language so that we could understand these different elements and initially he calls it in verse 44 the Tabernacle of witness in the wilderness the Tabernacle was the sacred tent of Jehovah it was in many ways just a tent and that literally a tent but it's called a tabernacle of witness or testimony it is Jehovah's tent of testimony and as I study these things and lay these things in there you'll find uh it's because of these elements and these things that God is expressing in Jehovah's ttin of testimony that God even in this end time and in brother bram's Ministry he gave him a vision which contained three different parts and the third part was represented of like a cathedral or a tent and that tent had a little room and it's that Vision that has become one of the most controversial most misunderstood and Mis interpreted why because it speaks of something essential about God's character and what he desires and the devil would surely like to make a lot of confusion about it and at best getting all of us sitting on our hands waiting for it to happen and Miss what's happening right now and so there are certain elements in uh to this Tabernacle this Tabernacle of witness in the wilderness that are very distinct so first it's a tabernacle of witness in the wilderness where does that place it where does it place in Acts chapter 7 where is it coming to be in Exodus 25 in The Exodus before they get to Israel before Jesus as it says or Joshua brings it into the land of the Gentiles uh and begins to drive out the Philistines and all the other uh Hittites and things that dwelt there so this Tabernacle of witness in the wilderness has certain elements uh that are very critical for us to understand it had a a simple layout I say simple uh but we're look at in a sense that lays it out simply and this is just so uh just review for all of us and if it's anything that somebody doesn't know they're probably not here tonight and on Sunday if we revisit it you could just look over and like you don't know this but it speaks of the outer Court I'm joking uh it speaks there's these elements there's the outer Court the holy place and the most holy place this is so much just easier review but let me just touch on some things about it so we can understand this critical layout in the outer Court court or the courtyard and it was defined by I think it's 150 cubits uh this fine linen that was used uh to set the borders of it in that place essentially all Jews were able to be in this portion of the what was called The Tabernacle of witness in the wilderness or that whole structure all Jews could come in there and in there is the bronze altar the Brazen altar which would have faced that uh that entrance and there's the Laver so there's these different elements that exist within the court yard and within that courtyard now there is another structure which contains the holy place and it was a first chamber of a tent or a structure within the entire enclosure or within the courtyard so you have a court or a courtyard and within the courtyard is a tent and a part of this tent is a chamber called The Holy place and there was the bread table the lampstand and only priests were allowed in there for service the that if you were a Jew you could come into the courtyard but you couldn't enter into the holy place that was a place that was reserved for the priesthood but then there was another chamber in that tent so there's a tent in the courtyard it kind of reminds me there's a hole there's a hole in the bottom of the sea and then there's a log in the hole in the bottom of the sea and it just seems it just keeps getting more precise so there was a courtyard in the courtyard there was a tent in the tent there was a chamber and then there was a chamber a second chamber in the most holy place and only one person the high priest could enter into there once a year and as we were already reading the staves uh to the Ark of the Covenant extended out from the most holy Place into the holy place as if it were a guide to guide the high priest into this Most Holy place and it was there that God dwelt and I'm realizing now I'd taken out several scriptures that I was going to originally place at the outset that show this is where God dwelt between the cherubims this is where the shakina glory lived between those cherubims it's explicitly written in the scripture so this was God's room Jews could be in the courtyard all Jews could be in the courtyard Levites the priest of the Levites and they could all exist in there but then the priest could go into the holy place but now in the most holy place so we call the holy of holies only the high priest could enter there because that was God's room and in order to get there that high priest had to prepare himself in a very very strict way we already read in Exodus 258 and let them make me a sanctuary that I may dwell among them this place that God would precisely dwell was in the holy of holies that inner Western room it was 10 cubits it contained the Ark of the testimony let them make me a sanctuary that I may dwell among them build me a house so I can live with you I don't want to just come and visit you with and I I want you to think really good about this I don't want to just visit you with signs and wonders I don't want to just reain Mana Out of Heaven I don't want to just do great exploits among you build me a house so I can live among you in that most holy place it was the tent of meeting is a way that describes the most holy place now if you can kind of catch the language that we're using is you have the Tabernacle but the Tabernacle had a courtyard in the courtyard there was a tent in the tent there was a holy place and then there was a Most Holy place and though all would be called a tabernacle there was only only one place where God met amen there was only one place where where God would dwell and that was in the holy of holies a tent of meeting in Revelations 15:5 it describes it this way and I apologize if my preacher's voice is just more annoying than it is uh Dynamic but in Revelations 15:5 it says and after that I looked and behold the Temple of the Tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened now that's quite a phrase the Temple of the Tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened so when it says the Temple of the Tabernacle of the testimony it's referring to as a very specific attribute and opening of the Tabernacle so you get to have the Tabernacle but now we have the Temple of the Tabernacle we have a courtyard we have an entire structure oh there's the Tabernacle let us go into the temple but we could just be using that language to refer to the entire structure but within the Tabernacle there was a courtyard and within the courtyard there was a tent and within the tent there was two Chambers and now it says the temple the Temple of the Tabernacle the Temple of the tent was opened in heaven so it's a very specific attribute of the whole Tabernacle so in the wilderness during The Exodus God gave them instructions and they built uh uh they built the Tabernacle with great detail we see it in Exodus it's described in many different places and very lengthy chapters but now if we look at First Kings chapter 8 and as we read already in Acts chapter 7 David wanted to build a tabernacle but he didn't want it just to be a tent he wanted it to be a permanent place why is it the most high would dwell in a tent and these temporary structures and uh made mobile and and ready to move at any time and here we are in our land of possession should we not build something more permanent and so Solomon doesn't uh pitch a tent he actually builds a house he builds a house for him and this is what we read about in first Kings which is where we have the temple so we're going from Tabernacle which was portable in the wilderness to the temple which is permanent so in the Bible there's places and especially in the New Testament when Paul is actually going back over some elements he's actually talking about the Tabernacle in the wilderness and not the temple in Israel and they both speak to the same thing and have similar structures but there's some maybe even some distinct differences there were some things are just much bigger and more Grand when Solomon built the house but that's something for us to always remember there was a tabernacle which was temporary in the wilderness that they continued to use until the days of David and then they built the temple those are two different things and though two different things they're still pointing to one and the same can even say if anything they're foreshadowing Christ still speaking of Christ a tabernacle Temple representing the same thing Mercy Seat in the one Mercy Seat in the other Mercy Seat continuing to move there's a lot of these elements that we could recognize and so now as we read in First Kings chapter 8: 6 to 11 we see it now this Tabernacle having been built this Temple that Solomon built it's a permanent place there in M Mount Mariah and it says and the priest brought in the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord unto his place let's just go ahead and read the text all over again here and we'll Circle back to some of these things into the Oracle of the house to the most holy place even under the wings of the cherubs we can catch it in our Minds this view of them having built the outer walls to create a courtyard then they built a a place within the temple that would have two Chambers and You' have the Holy place and then in that you'd have the most holy place and to get there you'd have to come through the entrance to the courtyard and you could you would walk by uh you could walk by Jews and you could walk by other Israelites you could walk by Levites and Priests but as you came and came into the holy place there the priest would be gathered and You' have they had to walk and travel all the way to the most holy place the holy of holies that now set the Ark of the Covenant into its proper place it says into the unto his place for the cheram spread forth their wing two Wings over the place of the Ark and the cherums covered the ark and the staves thereof above and they drew out the staves at the ends of the staves were seen out in the Holy place before the Oracle so notice it's in the Holy place and it's referring to that little room as the oracle that's what that's where it it was and they don't take the staves out completely cuz they're instructed actually in the book of Exodus and I think numbers don't ever remove them completely and so it is brought in there to where it says and they were not seen without and there they are un this day there was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone I'll just chew on that a little bit which Moses put there at horb when the Lord made a covenant with the children of Israel when they came out of the land of Egypt and it came to pass when the priests were come out of the Holy place now we just pause there for a moment it's now described quite a bit but the Ark of the Covenant the one that held the two tables of stone that Moses put there in horb and that God had written upon and that or that represented these The Ten Commandments given to Israel and the word of the lord it's put in there it's in that Ark of the Covenant this great symbol where God uh and it's representative of The Mercy Seat and there between the image of the cherubims this is where God would dwell Above This lid this H uh great beautiful representation now that that's placed where it belongs and where God wanted it to be it's then it says that the came to pass that the priest were come priests were come out of the Holy place that the cloud filled the house of the Lord so that the B priest could not stand to minister because of the cloud for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of the Lord wow what beautiful imagery beautiful imagery and so in this in this image we could say this the Wilderness Tabernacle has now been replaced all those tents and curtains and all those brackets and rings and everything that would have been represented there it's no longer used anymore that that tent of meeting that place is is not relevant in the sense that this is where God would meet it the Tabernacle of of the witness in the wilderness that was even used into that day now that Solomon had built the temple and built this house there's a replacement now with this physic physical Temple this first temple and we're reading of how the Ark of the Covenant is being placed permanently in the holiest of holies and I'd like you just to let your mind uh dwell on some of these inst these facts that the only thing in there were these two tables of stone you don't find the the pot full of Mana Aaron's Rod is not in there anymore and we could all speculate as to why it's not that perhaps the Philistines took it they had taking those things out of it and and and I would maybe conjecture a little bit that well God allowed him to be taken but he didn't allow the stones to be taken because what you see in the Mana and even the rod those are signs of his presence those are wonders and miracles but what we see represented these tables of stone is the word and Satan could take away the the signs or he could take away certain you could be healed and get sick again and the Mana would rot overnight and you'd have to get more and there's Miracles that can come and go and come and go and the rod which budded which testified of the power of the sh glory and the Mana which testified of God's provision they're not represented there but the word was represented there and God saw that that could not be taken out of the Ark because that what was was what was the most important Hallelujah and I'm realizing now I I don't have a preacher's voice even when it gets husky it just gets more whiny and nasally whatever that is can we put some uh I can't remember what it's called Auto pitch on there autotune yeah just autotune me a little bit get me let me find my groove here there's so there's there's a lot for you to really uh in a proper way fixate on to say wow God made sure that when it found its permanent place what we focus on in this little room is the word that's what has the preeminence and it says that it was it was brought into to his place the place in the part of the house where the Divine Oracle was and the Oracle is the holy of holies doesn't that speaks something the holy of holies is an oracle itself it's the testimony it's a place of witness it though the Tabernacle as a whole in the courtyard and all its elements speaks of something and the temple itself and its Courtyard and its all its amenities and things it speaks of something but there is one place that he spoke from amen there the Divine Oracle was and the holy of holies and as we read this I I hope that you're able to kind of catch this part this is a house whether we call it the Tabernacle of witness in the wilderness or the house that Solomon built this was a house with divisions now let me be very clear It's Not A House Divided but it's a house which is one which has divisions so it's not a house divided but it has distinctions that within it it's s there was a courtyard and a tent and the tent itself had two compartments brother bandam touches on this in a number of different places we'll just use a few tonight but in the sermon of hidden life and catch this first statement he makes now let's drop back to the hidden life and find out what this is going to require to get into this place of adoption a hidden life I think that's that that this place of adoption it hold some significance there a hidden life we realize that in the Old Testament under the mosaic laws there were two compartments and a congregation and then the setup of God's Tabernacle in the wilderness in the Old Testament under in the law that was given to Moses as we see in Exodus 25 make me a sanctuary make me a house that I could live among you that it had these he calls it two compartments and a a general congregating place he said this was the congre that the first was the congregation or the courtyard that's my me adding in the courtyard there then the holy place then the holiest of holies that's God's house now catch this how what he what he's pointing to that's God's dwelling place now you only live in a three- room house remember you may have two bedrooms you may have three kitchens what kind of houses did they have in Jeffersonville you may have three kitchens one in the basement one in the first floor but you only live in a three room house and he makes a very good point no matter how many kitchens you have that's a room no matter how many bedrooms you have that's a room he says God lived so you only live in a three room house it's it's breaking down no matter how big your house is it's saying we can kind of distill down he says in one place I don't think I have it here no matter how many pantries you have you only have three rooms and he uses kitchen parlor uh Bedroom A lot of times is his language he using now I think it's good not to get hung up on that particular language that he's using but this the idea that he's saying look a house essentially has three areas where we can gather three particular elements to it and he says God lived in a three- room house when God was here on Earth he occupied a three- room house the soul body and spirit of Jesus Christ I catch that you catching this our title tonight is a a home with three rooms God lived in a three- room house Jes Jesus Christ had soul body Spirit God lived in a three room house so Christ now represents three rooms says in the temple he's in a congregation holy Place holy of holies so now in the Tabernacle three places in the temple three places each one of them was separated one from another and each one had a different Furniture in it to show the dwelling place and then when he says this this ought to kind of open up a whole area for us to realize there's something to this that we hopefully God can reveal to us quick Quicken to us in our individual ways and what I do by the teaching of the word is trusting that there's something we could bring out that the Holy Spirit could Quicken you say now that's something means something to me helps me to understand the word of God helps me to yield myself to the Holy Spirit he says a very beautiful type of the church so now we could say that the bride is even represented or the Church of God has represented it in it and the local church now is just a really cheap type of what the beautiful bride of Christ is or this local church serves that beautiful church that beautiful house andbody he saying there's something about this dwelling place that has these different separations and distinctions that makes it what it is says the cner first comes into the kitchen as it was the kitchen's where you eat the living room is where you commune and he talks a little little bit more about that in some other places and the bedroom is where you rest and again I think we don't need to be legalistic about this type but we realize that brother bram's going to use this language of a house that may have a common area where everyone eats and you're welcome to come here and this is where we eat first the word of God but then there's a little bit more of a private place he calls it the Parlor and he even talks about where maybe the veil is being lifted up and a little bit more intimacy but the ultimate formalization of a relationship he saying that's where the real intimacy is that's where the real relationship is security is in the bedroom and that's just the language that brother brandham uses and so this type I I want to just maybe point off to the side for a moment say this type as he's using the home or all of our individual houses tonight we may go back to an apartment we may go to a condo we may go to a house uh we may have a basement Suite wherever that might exist in the in the valley they're out there uh but there's just very few of them there's whatever it might be that we live in we could say that's a that's a house that can have these three rooms so that I think that holds a great signific significance to us a and where there's uh what's modeled here applied in great ways if I could just put it that way a lot of other ways that we could begin uh to go into that now if you'll look at Exodus chapter 40 verses 33 to 38 it says and he reared up the court round about the Tabernacle and the Altar and set up the hanging of the Court gate so Moses finished the work and exodus 27 you'll find it describing maybe I'll just turn there real quick and read it to you I think we're doing excellent on time tonight I think we're doing excellent on time all of us we're all doing really good on time tonight it says and thou shalt make the court of the Tabernacle for the South Side Southward there shall be hangings for the court to F twined linen of 100 cubits long for one side and this we could keep reading it but that's what Moses now it's saying that he hung he reared up the court round about the Tabernacle and the Altar and set up the hanging of the Court gate so you had the tent or even here it's like kind of the tent of meeting the Tabernacle you had the the Brazen altar the Laver that's all there maybe existed in the open but now I'm going to hang this tent around it this this hangings it says reared up the court around it so that now it's going to be separated her out from the from the general population the general congregation he reared it up and reared up these hangings so Moses finished word it's almost like the final piece now and then it says then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation and the glory of the Lord filled the Tabernacle and Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation because the cloud Abode thereon and the glory of the Lord filled the Tabernacle this is a this is the description of this moment that it's essentially finished you have the Ark of the Covenant is in there the the most holy of the holiest of holies is finished the holy place is finished the tent of meaning all the staves are driven down everything's in its place now they erect this final perimeter that's going to cut this divide this out and separate it out this final distinction now and when it h when this happens now the glory of the Lord is identified with this entire structure and the cloud is settled there on the glory of the Lord fills the Tabernacle and I want to I want to point this out again the house of the Lord was known by this three-fold division to where the glory of God does not come down until this last part is established it wasn't like man they put the Arc of the Covenant there God's like woohoo I want to get there and steps down and every there's this Glory that begins to fill this little room no the rest of it had to be there and once Moses had placed up the outer tent the glory of the Lord fills this place and it expresses something about the importance of a three- room house they saidwell why didn't they just leave the the altar there for all to see why didn't they just leave the labor there why did he have to set up the structure and we have to come through this gate uh that has certain colors mixed into it and woven together and why why did it have to face a certain direction and why did it have to be built where not everyone could look therein why was it arranged that way it there's something God arranged it that way it was a pattern of something he saw in heaven so has something to do with what's in God's mind and God's heart and what God desires so it's revealing something to us about God's characteristics in his ambition I have an image here just to so you can look at to see what this would have looked like and it is this will you could see in here this three-fold division where that that white border separates out the courtyard and and it's what's described in Exodus 27:9 and just how uh you know long that is and how beautiful it would have been set and even the the entrance we see there on the left side and when you would enter in you'd find the altar you'd find the Laver and then the tent the Tabernacle this Pillar of Fire being identified with it this is the Tabernacle but within the Tabernacle is even what's called a tabernacle or tent or a temple and then within that is a holy place and the most holy place and the place that God would live is in that little room the place that God would be is in the Holy place that's where he would dwell between those cherubims but God even though you might have this little place there in the middle the rest of it was important to express something to us to show something to us it was still a three room house even though brother bam says that God lived in a three room house and we know that where where the column of fire is being identified with where he said he would dwell is in that little room there in the most the most holy place or the holiest of place holies in that tent of me meaning the remaining threee room house meant something to the entirety of the structure so let's look at 1 Corinthians chapter 3 verses 16 and 17 this might be a I got just maybe a quick jump to the most important elements and details of this but it's 1 Corinthians chapter 3: 16 and 17 know ye not that ye are the temple of God that the spirit of God dwelleth in you if any man defile the temple of God him shall God destroy for the temple of God is Holy which Temple ye are now Paul just he just found a way to probably say it that would just aggravate every Jew within the sound of his voice because the temple right even today the most revered structure in in in the Jewish religion is the wall that they can identify as being the a vestage of the temple The Wailing Wall this this place that they could pray it means so much to them so this physical temple one of the most controversial statements Jesus made tear down this Temple I'll raise it in three days they like you leave this Temple alone it meant so much them it's such a significant structure but now Paul's saying you are the temple of God this is quite a language to use you are the temple of God now if we could just uh somehow just very quickly capture all the things that we've already said there was a pattern in heaven and In Heaven There was the Temple of the Tabernacle the testimony in heaven that what Moses saw there he builds and the Tabernacle of witness in the wilderness and it was a three- room house Courtyard holy Place Most Holy place and that now the temple follows the same pattern which we would have seen in heaven and it's a three- room house it is Courtyard holy Place Most Holy Place God in each one of these instances identifies himself First Kings chapter 8 Exodus chap 40 he has ultimately identifying himself as dwelling in the holiest of holies the most holy place but yet it doesn't not just exist on its own it has a chamber and then an outer Court a three room house brother bam then says that God lived in a three room house when he was here in Jesus he was Body Soul or Spirit soul that this is what he dwelt in now Paul is saying you are the Temple of the Holy Ghost know you not that ye are the temple of God brother brandham writing in the church age book said man was created for God he says man was to be the temple of God if I could say this even before there was a tabernacle of witness in the wilderness even before David desired to build my house even before Solomon built the house I know I'm maybe working the wrong way but even before Solomon built it even before David desired it even before Moses built it even before Moses saw it God desired that man would be a temple this is where a lot of this is pointing back to the series we ministered on the kingdom the place of God's rest he said the Holy Spirit was man the temple God always envisioned that man would be his Temple when the question is asked what what house will you build me and where's the place of my rest we could say that God didn't wasn't wanting a tent he wasn't wanting a tabernacle that man would erect and build but he wanted man to be his house therefore if man was going to be house man has to be reflected in the temple in 1 Thessalonians 5: 23- 24 Paul says in the very God of Peace sanctify you entirely perfectly completely he says holy and I pray God your whole Spirit soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ now as an aside let me I point this out that a lot of people say well theologians and maybe to a certain extent maybe in the message it's getting to where the outside doesn't count and home life doesn't count and all these other things and the Optics don't count but listen God cared enough to be so detailed and precise about this traveling tent in the wilderness that it covers chapters and chapters he doesn't just say put up a wall you know build the wall please it's going to be oo just going to be awesome he said I want it built this way I want it to look this way I want to be this long I want to have these kind of tabrets I want everything to buil be built in a certain way cuz it mattered to God yeah it mattered how it looked he said I'm going to live and dwell in this little room I'm that's the place I'm going to be I'm going to dwell between the wings of the cherubs and you say well make sure we get that right but the holy place it still mattered it was arranged a particular way the courtyard where everyone could come that had to be arranged a particular way and it tells us something about God's nature that even though we could say it's the soul where he'll dwell he cares about the condition of your spirit he cares about the condition of your body and he cares about the way you look to the people on the outside and he's not just saying oh I'll just live anywhere no it all had to line up even though he was going to live in some place very specific and particular the other parts matter to the point where he says your whole Spirit soul and body be preserved blameless not just the soul but your spirit and your body that three-fold person which we are that ought to give us courage to believe in our physical healing that ought to give us courage and and our in the healing of our spirits that are often broken and scared wounded but let me also say it speaks about the Holiness of what we express with how we dress and how we act it speaks about the Holiness of our thoughts and the things we pursue because the whole thing has got to be a temple brother bradam and the dedication of building to the dedication of building to the Lord he says the three room house several paragraphs here that deal with this he says a three the three room house a three compartment service one is your body what you do for Christ the the other is your spirit what you think of Christ the other is your soul the faith that you have in Christ Ah that's a good way of putting it is't it your faith which it's your faith that God seals with the baptism of the Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the new birth there in your soul which your faith allows you to be sealed or God seals your faith there is the faith that you have in Christ but now with your spirit it's what you think of Christ and your body is what you do for Christ Brother s said three compartment service he says again three room house completely absolutely dedicated to the service of the Living God justification by faith sanctification by the blood the filling of the Holy Spirit entering into peace and rest with God this is this pattern that's being expressed here he says completely absolutely dedicated to the service of the Living God what's completely absolutely dedicated to the service of the Living God my soul my spirit and my body it's the soul spirit and body that's to be preserved blameless it's the three rooms of the individual as it patterned in the Tabernacle in the wilderness as it was patterned in the the house that Solomon built as it was patterned in Jesus Christ so is it also reflected in Me God showing through these different structures that he allowed in the Old Testament that man was made to be his Temple that I gave you this division of Body Spirit Soul CU I wanted to reflect from the the very beginning that all along there was a place that I was wanting to have as my rest that you were going to be the temple a three room house in 1 Corinthians chapter 6: 19 like Paul's saying what know you not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which you have of God and you are not your own just picking up what he said you are the temple of God the spirit of God dwelleth in you he's dwelling in that Soul uh you're the for the temple of God is Holy which Templar are ye you are the body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost said the body yeah just like the Tabernacle just like the temple but where does he dwell there in the soul where where does where does he want to be in the soul no matter how much you might be filled with this enthusiasm and glory in the spirit or how much you might feel it on your flesh where God lived was in the soul there was a certain experience someone could have in the Holy place but it was in the holy of holies where he lived there was a certain experience someone could have in the courtyard but where he lived was in the most holy Most Holy Place brother Bram says in the sermon unveiling of God this would be a that would be a good one maybe just to tap into he says the Mighty God unveiled the unveiling of God both deal with these same principles you are templ Christ you are templ Christ that's behind the veil the skin the veil again in human flesh hides God the word from the unbeliever you are where God hides himself God hiding himself today in the Simplicity of a human being God tabernacled in flesh God is templed you are templ in Christ behind your skin Veil human flesh hides God the word from the unbeliever and you say oh yes God is hidden I've so completely hidden him that nobody has a clue some of you are really good at hiding them but where he hides himself he also reveals himself and if he's hid from the unbeliever you ought to be simple enough and hold and express God enough to where though the unbeliever doesn't see him it encourages the believer to know him through you no matter how holy we are no matter how dedicated we are no matter how right we are in our responding no matter how well we live the word of God he'll always be hid from the unbeliever but that's not an excuse to not express and reflect the Holiness of God in our lives he says and he veils himself today in Earth and vessels with the shikina the vessels hold the Shaka the outside looks like a bunch of Holy Rollers old Badger skins these bags waxing old but the inside hides the shikina glory the inside think of it just how quickly we moved to that just how quickly we can go from the temple in the will the Tab the wildness to the temple in Jerusalem to Christ to you right you are temple in Christ my brother B I'm saying that there's a three room house that God dwells in we see it in the Tabernacle we see it in the temple we see it in Christ now I see it in me you are temple in Christ God the word is hidden from the unbeliever In the Flesh of his bride I'm just going to wrap up I have another quote and just one more scripture to read read just follow me there now in this reading from the sermon dedication and when this body had been made a sacrifice the correct lamb had been sacrificed there was coming forth then who is the correct sacrifice Christ what did all the sacrifices and and all all of them whether it be uh Lambs or dobs or whatever it might be that that one offering once a year what did it all point to the correct lamb that was coming the Passover Lamb that they partook in all these individual families completely ate up uh there at the Feast of the Passover every year what did it point to Christ so now that Christ had been crucified the body had been slain the sacrifice had been altered offered and what a beautiful testimony of how that he goes to hell and now he's got to present the sacrifice in heaven just as the high priest would do once a year this bloody lamb was going to present himself in heaven and we see that this Christ uh between hell and heaven we see this image of him telling hold on you can't touch me yet I've got to go and make a representation of the slain lamb in heaven as the high priest did every year this time of year he said now once this has happened Watch What comes forth God came to his own body which was his bride yeah now we're on the day of Pentecost go Terry you till the day of Pentecost is fully come and he said and there had been 120 temples that God had created and were ready for dedication that had got all their unbelief beat out of them amen he he's I getting beat up well pray to God that it's he beating out the unbelief and no matter how much we're beaten as Believers at the end of the day no matter how much it feels like you're going to lose you've got one promise it's going to be unbelief that you lose it's going to be the unbelief that's beaten out of you sometimes we find ourselves really in The Crucible getting beat up and suffered quite a bit and we may feel that we suffer the loss of a lot of things but the best thing you're losing in all of it is your doubt and unbelief get it all all beat out of us it may not feel like it at the time you may feel like you're losing your faith you're losing your confidence you're losing your testimony but I promise you one day you're going to be able to stand and say if I lost anything it was that unbelief that was bringing me down and God had to beat me up to get it out of me and today I'm glad for it they gathered in the upper room and waited for 10 days for a dedicational service now notice how beautiful this is then when completely surrendered the day of Pentecost was fully come according to the promise the written word god came down again in the shakina of glory and filled all the house where they were setting do we not read that in Acts this is what happens what's amazing is now they're in this Upper Room they're in this place this Gathering Place the holy spirit's going to fall down on them and it's going to fill the whole place the glory the Lord's going to be seen we see in Exodus 40 we see in First Kings chapter 8 that there there's some representation where you feel like well it's it's beyond it's beyond the little room there's some spill over there's some effect where now even this pillar fire the cloud can be seeing these things but where is he going to be these tongues of fire there's things external there's things visible there's tongu being spoken but where did God come he wasn't in the tongues he wasn't necessarily in all these other things he was now coming to souls yeah amen and the same the same effect is taking place it filled all the house where they were sitting what did God do oh this is so beautiful like the ark dropping into its proper sockets for the message of that day God dropped back into his proper Channel not in a denomination or into a building made with hands but Into the Heart of men catch that it wasn't the upper room that made it so awesome it wasn't the tint structure it wasn't something Cathedral like but it was a special place that got an Envision it was some place that meant something to God he said that's where I met him that's where I was coming like the Ark of the Covenant dropping in to the most holy place the holy of the Holy and now the priests begin to leave and they pull out the staves and it comes into the holy place and now it's marked the entrance of the most holy place and as they step out God comes down into the holiest of holies that's where God was and though it might have reverberated and the glory of the Lord in Acts fills up the whole house where they are where they were the glory where it was living was in the heart of man because that's what the ark dropping into that Oracle of God who's the Oracle of God anyways where does it speak from in this end time who's the company that's publishing it in this end time God dropped back in his proper channel into building madebe with hands not in a building made with his hand but into the heart of man he dropped in his place for the last day which said the prophet Joel it shall come to pass in the last days I'll pour out my shika put All Flesh your sons and daughters shall prophesy your young men shall dream dreams and the old men shall see Visions you catch what's even being shown here the spirit can move but he didn't just want to move move he wanted to live he wanted to live and where does he live not in a church service not in a Saturday night meeting not even a prayer line he lives in the hearts of men God came to his resting place where he finds rest not in a building not in a tent not in a tabernacle not in a temple but in the heart of his people he finds rest God came to his resting place ultimately finally he found the place he wanted to live amen Brothers if you could come to your instruments we'll just wrap up here Hebrews chap 10:5 wherefore when he cometh into the world he sayith sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not but a body hast thou prepared me why was The Ultimate not the temple why would Jesus even come to the temple and and clear out say you've made the house of God a den of Thieves you've polluted it you've perverted it why would it even be that Christ would not come and restore Temple worship as it ought to be and bring the sh kind of Glory back behind the veil but actually that's not even what happens when he's sacrificed on the cross the veil is written and it shows there is no Ark of the Covenant there there is no mercy seat there there is no blood there he actually comes and exposes the shallowness and The Emptiness of their vain thoughts of this place this Temple this Cathedral this place of worship however they would have looked at he says no that's not where it was supposed to be to begin with the temple in the wilderness the temple in Jerusalem was all pointing to Christ the temple that would come so that he could be the ultimate sacrifice and represent the lamb that would forever consecrate his resting place the body thou has prepared me God was not Desiring and if I can say this today to you God is Not Desiring the discipline of abstaining from things God's not Desiring the sacrifice of abstinence from Evil and I don't cuss and I don't smoke and I don't drink he's not just asking for us to artificially clean up our lives as we could artificially keep a Courtyard Clean we could artificially set up all these different elements he's not just wanting your offering of Good Works he's not just wanting your offering of Praise And speaking in tongues in dcing and CH dancing other that and daning whatever else it is you do those aren't the things that he's wanting that's not what he's requiring but he wants a body he wants a Dwelling Place he wants a communion he wants a Divine Fellowship he wants a home amen where he finds rest today is in the heart the soul of a Believer that's a home with three rooms God could be in your kitchen all you want him to be and that's not where he wants to be he could be in your living room as much as you want him to be and that's still not what he wants he didn't doesn't want to be the friend that sleeps on a couch he doesn't want to be the the one you have pity on so you invite him over for dinner he doesn't want to be that person in the church that you invite over for dinner because you just want to you want to reach out in Fellowship he wants the most holy place he wants to live with you he wants to dwell with you he wants you to be a home with three rooms and if we could start there better helps us to find these other homes of three rooms helps to identify other places that are being pointed to in the house of God as it's referenced in the scripture and I know I I'm speaking to people who are sincere I know you want to be a Dwelling Place look for the language that brother bam uses in Statue of a perfect man in these other places how important it is for us to recognize our part in portraying the house of the Lord could you stand to your feet with me
