TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and it says this in the word and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins wherein time past ye walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit thou now worketh and the children of disobedience so let's just bow our heads for a word of Prayer Heavenly Father were a privileged people this morning father because you're present Lord and you've made your presence known even when we're yet sinners father God you you cared for us you loved us you manifested your plan to us Lord you brought us in Lord and also brought us out and father we're just so thankful for it today and so we just ask your blessings upon the people upon the speaker and the hearers god that whatever would come forth that it would be according to your will and your plan that we would speak words of eternal life to your children Lord that they would be received as such and Lord have an effect on us because father if there's no practical application to what it is then it's just Hollow singing and Hollow shouting in its Hollow preaching but if there's something that we can apply to our lives and just draw a little closer to you that's what we want to do today so we just commit this now into your hands we're asking in Jesus name God bless you you can have your seats so if I take a lot of drinks this morning please forgive me for whatever reason I I don't know if it's just because I'm preaching today that you wake up and your mouth is as dry as could possibly be so I don't know if it's the weather or or just the fact that you're nervous so it could be it could be a little both uh I'm not really sure but uh we just want to take a subject today and just before we do I'm going to bring up a definition for you and this isn't a trick definition like the last one so anybody that was in previous services this is actually straight out of you know a dictionary and it says the control of temperature humidity Purity and motion of air in an enclosed space independent of outside conditions anybody have a guess is my mic too loud no okay no not a thermostat but it's close it does the thermostat does something the kids should know this because okay so we live in Arizona and it's hot outside today what is it no close thank you air conditioning so we're going to talk about air conditioning today but maybe not in the way that you think but living in the desert right we appreciate it uh if if anybody looks at this picture and says that's exactly how my dad looks sitting under the air conditioner uh this your dad did not model for this uh that was no dad in particular that is sitting there it's just to show that there's an effect that air conditioning has and so we're going to talk about air conditioning just as we move forward today and brother Branham had talked in the message the God of this evil age brother I don't have that on there but in the God of this evil age that there's something that's actually happening today that was he tied back to something back in Genesis the 15th chapter about the iniquity of the amorites and he said that that iniquity of the amorites wasn't Yet full and so we see that that's progressing forward today and how that iniquity is actually filling up and so we're going to start off and I know this is going to be a little bit of an odd way to probably start to to get to the subject that we're talking about but what I want to do is to contrast something because a lot of times and I don't know why it is in human nature is it okay if I move around or is that okay okay thank you I feel better when I move around because obviously I've got people in the in the nosebleed section over here so I want to make sure I address you too uh our balcony commonly I mean I don't know if six inches can give you a nosebleed but hopefully not but um I just want to kind of move around a little bit if that's okay and so sometimes when we see a negative for whatever reason people tend to focus on a negative and they tend to acknowledge a negative a lot quicker than acknowledge a positive in fact you can notice in people's lives you'll have a tendency to if you have a bad thing happen to you and a good thing happened to you and it happens in the same day what do we typically end up at the end of the day remembering it's the negative thing yeah right it's just it's part of human nature for whatever reason I don't like it personally but I'm there with you that's what we have a tendency to do so we understand that in this day we have something that's happening and so in the scripture in Isaiah the 60th chapter in the second verse and you can move if you want but it should come up here the word says this for Behold The Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness the people but the Lord shall arise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee so we understand that this is the age that we're living and that there's a gross darkness and by gross that the scripture is talking about it's thick so it's something that's heavy it's something that you could say it's sticky it's something that's gonna it's just there like you it permeates things it's something that's so so heavy that it's covering the whole earth and we understand that we're seeing the effect of this particular Darkness taking place on on people all around us and we're living in that world we're living at this time when these things are happening so second Timothy 3 verses one to five the scripture says this this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves Covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful Unholy without natural affection truce Breakers false accusers incontinent Fierce despisers of those that are good Traders heady high-minded does this sound familiar maybe to some of us older folks maybe you young ones by God's grace you don't even know anything about this which is wonderful I think that's awesome I'm glad you're under an umbrella like that but heady high-minded lover is a pleasure more than lovers of God having a form of godliness and denying the power thereof and it says from such turn away and then in Revelations chapter 317 it's a very familiar verse to us it says because thou sayest I'm rich I'm increased with Goods I have need of nothing and know us thou not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked so I just want to go over this just briefly when we're talking about air conditioning and right now we can see the effect of the The Prince and power of the air and what condition he's created and under that gross Darkness we see this Satan's Eden is is what we we commonly call it we see that that kind of Eden the negative Eden taking place and most of us are will look at that and realize yeah this is actually happening like hey this is I mean this is perilous times you know this is a time of where people have Fury and they're angry and they're fierce and and and and it can be scary for some people and if you live in certain cities the things are worse than they've ever been and certain movements have taken place and we won't name them because obviously this is going to be on the internet and people get offended and then you get canceled but uh and I you know I don't want to be canceled certainly that that would be horrible uh but people pay so much attention to those things that are out there in the social media and the different things that are taking place and we focus on those things and we notice those things and there's an interesting thing that I see in the church is that we can realize that the prince and power of the air so this this air conditioning is taking place the devil is doing things and we see that and we know for one thing absolutely this is the word of God actually coming to pass right so this is just what you're seeing is the word coming to pass so first thing take courage in that because the words coming to pass but here's here's the part that I want to notice people are really good about noticing man look at how strong the devil is look at the things he's doing look at how Satan's Eden is getting so perfected look at how all these things are taking place look at how bad everybody is look at this you know horrible thing taking place over there and we realize that wow you know Satan's actually doing what the Bible said that he was going to do and we focus on those things and politics becomes a big deal by the way politics is is something that the devil controls just in case you're wondering uh that's what brother Branham said he said that demon power religion and and that political thing would come together those things and we've seen that and I I will tell you from my own standpoint I love it when people say I'm not lying it's only politics because a politician can tell you whatever they want and they say oh it's just politics no it's a lie it's just a straight out lie but you've taken a word and said this doesn't really mean a lie it just means I'm I'm kind of steering you the way I want you want you to go and so because I'm trying to help you I'm not really lying to you I'm just using politics to fix it so we understand that these things are happening and you see in our own country and this isn't just here in America so if we would take this same thought and take it to anywhere in the world you're going to find the same exact thing as this negative factor that's happening we ascribe so much to it and we recognize it and we see it and what we're failing to recognize is the power of God and the children of God and understanding that God is actually conditioning us to something so while there's a prince and power of the air working and we understand that it's working we need to realize that at the same time God is doing exactly what he needs to do and the problem that we have for some of us is that we have what brother Brandon referred to as a sticky nature right and what he said was that you know we we have a cockleburn nature and I I don't know cockle Bars were pretty common back in Wisconsin I don't see him out here but we have goat heads I don't know if anybody ever stepped on a goat head but just don't really like them um I don't know what they have down in Phoenix but we have those up North so but you can pick anything that sticks to you like a jumping Trail kind of like that yeah like you can walk past those things and I don't know how they get on you but they do and then you know you got to get a comb or something and get them off that something happens right so those things kind of stick to you and we understand that we have that sticky nature but brother Bynum also said that look at when you get wheat life into you so now on the inside you've got wheat life so that seed that goes into the ground what it's going to do is it's going to bring forth wheat life and I could I could read this to you but I'm trying to save some time it's going to bring forth wheat life because that's the seed that's on the inside so what Christ planted in you is is a wheat life but at the same time that nature that's on the outside still got some little stickiness to them still got a little bit of issue to them still got some things going on that is a problem and so because of that sticky nature sometimes we fail to realize or fail to recognize that God is preparing us for something God is working all the time and as much as we can see in the negative what Satan is doing we could be able to see in the positive what the Lord is doing in our lives because there's a great effect that's taking place for everyone here Saints and there's something that's moving and something that's happening so uh first Peter the scripture says this first Peter 4 we'll read 12 to 16 and then verse 19 it says beloved think it not strange the fiery trial which is to try you and so some strange thing happened unto you but rejoice in as much as your partakers of Christ's sufferings that when his glory should be revealed you may be glad also with exceeding Joy now I don't know about you but it's really hard to have exceeding Joy when you're kind of going through the test and trial but yet God does give you Joy at that time right he gives you peace at that time he he gives you the ability to smile you know through things that other people would be just overwhelmed by or overcome by yeah give you an example just driving on the freeway how many drive on the freeway right sometimes you can be overcome by the drivers that cut you off or the different things that happen on the freeway right and there are people that they can't even control their rage because we're in perilous times but yet we because there's something on the inside controlling you there's something on the inside conditioned you you're able to actually drive those freeways and come home and not like take it out on your family that the freeway was a horrible experience today and I really hated this and I didn't enjoy what I had to go through and this is really sad so now some of you younger ones someday you're going to be driving you'll understand this and I know you want to drive but for those of you that are driving now you have a you know you understand what I'm talking about I mean you can't even hardly go to a parking lot and get cut off by somebody and or actually maybe you're the one that cuts somebody off and they're ready to kill you like and and it happens right they have Road rages and it's people follow people home because we're in perilous times and we live in these perilous times so when we have these fiery trials that are assailing us when something is happening actually and something is taking place then we find out that though we can have exceeding joy and it says and if you be reproached for the name of Christ happy are you for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you on their parties evil spoken of but on your part he's glorified so people don't really like it when you don't act like they do right if if you don't get angry when somebody else does sometimes it makes them more angry because how are you under control and I'm like I got to do something something's got to happen here like let's let's go to it and they don't they're not able to really understand how you can have peace in a storm when they don't and they can't really understand or comprehend how it is that they're under an air condition they're they're in that gross Darkness phase and they're living in that and here you are it's all around you right but still you're under a different influence you got something else that's happening for you but let none of you suffer as a murderer or as a thief as an evil doer as a busybody in other men's matters now this is a whole different sermon but I just it strikes me in this particular verse that you have murderer thief evildoer and busybody so uh again this is a different sermon um but how impressive is it that busybody is thrown in with murderer thief and evildoer so the Lord must think something about that particular aspect of life to where we have to be involved in other people's you know business and let me tell you social media and if you have social media I'm not here to say yay or nay I don't personally have it but it is astounding to me how much people focus on social media kids take their own lives because of social media because of cyber bullying you know when when I was a kid and you made a mistake or in fact you didn't even have to make a mistake somebody just didn't like you uh and they would start saying bad things about you it was usually like a sphere of three four people now it's a sphere of three four million like it's it's that I children my my my hat is off to you to grow up in this world today because this is such a different atmosphere that's been created by this thing and it's a beast it's it's it's a devil and it's a demon thing that's out there because so many people focus on it and I'm going to tell you a secret right now there's a secret to social media it's called an off button because if you don't read the comments that people say about you and you stay away from those comments and don't listen to those things it doesn't have the same effect on you but you're being conditioned by the comments and as long as you keep reading the comments and keep focusing on those things then it keeps keeps you in that mindset and keeps you down that path and keeps you drawn into that particular thing but that social media watch out for it because it's something that is actually sent I believe to continue to destroy the fabric of of not just America but the world and that's what it's succeeding and doing you know even though social media do you know the social media Giants don't let their own children engage in their social media platforms because they set it up to control people's minds and they know it and so that's why so just just be wary of it I'm not telling you not to have it or two have it but anyway I just thought it was funny busybody murderer I don't know if you're a busy buddy you might want to think twice about that one uh verse 16 yet if any man suffer as a Christian let him not be ashamed but let him glorify God on this behalf wherefore Let Them Suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well-doing as unto a faithful creator so we understand that What's Happening Here is the Lord is talking about look at you're going to have things that happen in your life and you're going to have trials you're going to have tests you're going to have tribulation but these things are actually producing Joy though you don't really see it right now because there's an effect that's happening there's a conditioning that's happening and the end effect of this is joy the end effect of this is peace the end effect of this is love the end effect of this is eternity the end effect of this is something greater than what you're witnessing right now and you're actually being conditioned to do something because these things as they're taking place they're changing you and modifying you and and teaching you you know we could take Gideon and just talk about him for just a second you know here he is Lord sends an Angel and the angel comes to him and says get in you're a mighty man of Valor and Gideon's like what have you seen me like I'm hiding out I don't want anybody to notice me you know I've been in this way a long time and I I'm really afraid of these midianites I don't like them I'm not sure what to do I gotta kind of keep it on the down low nobody you know nobody noticed that Gideon's hiding out so the Lord comes and tells them look at you're a mighty man of Valor then what does he proceed to do he spends his whole time conditioning Gideon to believe you're a mighty man of Valor everything he does hey I'm going to have I'm going to put a fleece before you and there's going to be you know water on the ground but nothing in the on the the fleece and then I'm going to have the other way it's going to be the fleece is going to be soaking wet nothing on the ground and look at you're going to go into the camp of the midianites and they're gonna it was midianites I think that's right you're going to go into their camp and they're going to find out that uh you know you're going to hear that actually you're going to defeat them like they're afraid of you you're hiding out from them they're afraid of you so each thing that happens in Gideon's life is just building him up to where he can actually receive the fact he is a mighty man of Valor and that's what the Lord is doing as well he's building us up to receive the fact that we're Mighty people of Valor that we're actually that bride of Jesus Christ the things that have been coming over the pulpit I don't know if you noticed from brother Aaron but what is he doing it's building your faith to understand exactly what the relationship was with you in the Lord the Lord chose you he he was the one that chose you he's the one that's responsible for perfecting you he's the one that's taking care of these things he's the one that's responsible for conditioning you to believe those things and he takes that responsibility with full assurance that he's more than capable to do it it's not like he's worried about doing it you know the scripture says it's our adversary of the devil right it's our adversary you realize that while there is an adversarial relationship between the Lord and the Devil he's not really his adversary because at any moment in time what could the Lord do Satan gone that's not an adversary it's kind of like you and a bug that's really slow moving and not dangerous and you kind of take your finger and it's not really an adversarial relationship right it's an adversary to us but it's not an adversary to the Lord so if if we have an adversary we understand that that's okay we've got somebody that's overcome the adversary that that isn't even infected by the adversary right Christ and we just heard this preaching Christ went down he took everything with him all the sins that we had took it down and came right back up again right everything that we had everything that we would ever do from from the time you're born to the time you you leave this place and in whatever way you leave it all those things were taken care of in Christ so that adversarial relationship is already covered by Jesus Christ he's already taken care of it it's already there Romans the fifth chapter verses one to six and don't worry we're going to get to actually my my sermon we're not there yet we're just working our way so therefore being justified this is what the scripture says therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in Hope of the glory of God and not only so but we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation work patience patience experience and experience hope and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us for when we are yet without Strength In Due Time Christ died for the ungodly so again what we're pointing to here is that the Lord is letting us know look it you got tribulations but these tribulations are doing something so the tribulations Works patience and and through that patience you get experience and through experience you get hope because you realize that this is building to something and the Lord is working something in your life so whether you know it or not Saints you're being conditioned as well so just like under the prince and power of the air that those children of Disobedience are conditioned to behave a certain way there's a reason that you see truce Breakers and liars and the politics and the demon power and all these different things they're conditioned to believe a certain way this same thing is taking place okay the same thing is taking place in your lives but just on the positive side of it and I'm going to try and reinforce this as I preach today because again we focus so much on negative everything is negative that's our life like the uh the experiences in life if there's a problem that you have with your spouse it's always the negative that comes out first right if you get into a crisis situation what happens you don't say hey you're wonderful and you know you do great things the first thing that you do is go to the negative side look at what you did last week look at what you did 10 years ago look at what you did 20 years ago right that's where we go that's our human nature but yet Christ is working out something in us to get us somewhere else so remember this when we were out strength the Lord did this and I don't know about you but there's many times in my life I'm without strength still today you get into situations and it just doesn't seem like you have the strength to go through right but yet the Lord is more than able to get you through and he when we were yet without strength had strength for us and he manifests that strength when we need it he lets us know that that strength is there in second Peter 1 2-8 it says Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature so here he has he's given us promises he's made sure that he's multiplying the knowledge to us he's giving us power through these things he's making sure that everything that pertains to life and godliness everything that pertains to what we have need of through him that we're able to get that glory and The Virtue through Christ because he's giving exceeding great and precious promises and then to buy these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust so he's making us divine okay that's pretty heavy because I don't know if you looked in the mirror but brother Chris Don't Look So Divine in the morning and maybe you're the same I don't know but at this what he's doing he's he's through these different things he's actually getting you to a place where you're taking on his nature his nature is manifesting in your life and that's why in the parking lot or on the highway you're able to stay calm and and you're able to be at peace with it or even if you get a little bit riled up afterwards you're able to because sometimes you do sometimes you know I don't know you know maybe I'm the only one in the room but most of us are humans I think okay there's no body snatcher aliens present this morning so you know sometimes we do you get angry sometimes those things happen I'll tell you if I remember I'll tell you a story in just a little bit um we're at verse five I think and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge into knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and patience godliness and godliness brotherly kindness and the brother of the kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be Barren or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ so what's the Lord doing he's saying look at I'm building you up I'm conditioning you for something I'm making you into something that seed that's in you is going to manifest into something it has to manifest I'm going to make sure you get there so I'm going to have you add these things I'm going to have you do these things I'm going to have you make sure that all these things happen to you so we're going to actually start getting into the message here in just a second for when God made Hebrews 6 13-15 it says for when God made promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself saying surely blessing I Will Bless thee and multiplying I will multiply thee and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise so we understand this that God well actually let me read just the next thing in the Philadelphian Church age um seven churches I hope that's okay with everyone uh brother Brandon is referring to Hebrews 11 17 it says by faith Abraham when he was tried offered up Isaac and he that had received the promise the word of God offered up his only begotten son there it is Abraham was try it after he received the Word of Promise most think that as soon as we pray in Jesus name over the good Promises of God that there could not be a trial sorry it's not how it works so brother brand makes it pretty clear right here but here it says that Abraham was tried after he received the promise that is exactly correct according to psalmist referring to to Joseph so Psalms 105 19 until that time that his word came the word of the Lord Tried Him God gives us exceeding great and precious promises he has promised to fulfill them he will but from the time we pray until the time we get the answer we must learn to receive patience into our souls for only in patience do we possess life may God help us to learn this lesson even as we know the people of this sixth age learned patience we read the history of the lives of these great Christians what a contrast we see between their lives and ours for they were so patient and quiet and today we are but overcome and over impatience and haste now I can remember when I was a Youngster and it was quite a while ago as you can tell by my loss of hair and grayness and other situations that present themselves before you but one of the things that that I do know is when I was a Youngster and this would be after brother Branham had passed I was born in 63 so and passed in 65 so we're talking here about over impatience in haste and this is in the 60s so I grew up in the 70s and certainly you would have thought that people were over impatient and Hasty then but let's come fast forward to today and guess what the like the length of time for the attention span of a kid is nowadays kids what's your attention span nobody's gonna nobody's gonna admit this right now three seconds six seconds five seconds actually it depends on the kid but the fact of the matter is it's actually seconds they they have to change images have to change constantly things have to change the way that they make films and things nowadays in games and everything there has to be a change in the image constantly it has to fire off all the time and and it's because that same thing is just snowballed so look at here again is the negative right if the if Satan has perfected this to where people are so over impatient and Hasty and to the fact that our attention sounds now are down into the seconds rather than minutes or hours you know it used to be that people could actually sit and do nothing for hours and be perfectly happy doing that I know the women are thinking the guys do that all the time husbands that's what they do they just sit and do nothing that's that's kind of how they are but and I I do think men have a special ability to actually go to a nothing place and do nothing that that is certainly an ability that they have but the reality is is this has been perfected now I don't know how your attention and can get much shorter than seconds nanoseconds I don't know like you blink and then you're on to the next thing because that's where we're getting to so understand that in the same sense that that patience has gone from the children of disobedience understand that the patience for the people of God has increased the other direction so now we're actually going to start getting into our sermon because this is where I want to kind of take us so understand this um just before I re I want to go back and read that definition so if you could go back to the I think the second one brother John so the definition of air conditioning the control of temperature humidity Purity emotion of air in an enclosed space independent of outside conditions so like I said I know dads appreciate this I know we appreciate it I appreciate it I think you appreciate it but one of the things that's interesting about air conditioning is you know the effect of it is an amazing thing because you can right now outside it's probably I don't know 100 degrees are coming up on 100 degrees I don't know what it is here Philip you could probably tell me by looking at the little thing but the amazing thing is is right outside this building it's hot and in this lovely you know outfit that I have on and maybe your help at the same if you go out there and stand for a while and especially if you're not in the shade and you stand in the sun you're going to feel the effects of that right but there's a really awesome thing you can walk into the building you can take a thermostat and set a temperature and you can sit down in the cool now the whole building is surrounded right it's heat in fact we haven't even gotten miserable yet because Monsoon hasn't kicked in so I mean this has been one of the better I think kind of spring Summers that we've had in a while it's I mean I'm I don't know about you but I'm thankful for it but the reality is is that we we go from an air-conditioned car to an air-conditioned building whether it's a job or the store or whatever and then we get back out of that place and we go back into an air-conditioned car and we go somewhere right but are we in the environment yeah the environment surrounds us it's all around and that's how gross darkness is you're you're right now in an environment that Satan is controlling Prince and power of the air he's there he's in control of those things and it's sticky and it's thick now I know we have some that have moved from from where it's more humid than Arizona uh but I I've been to where it's sticky and I don't particularly like it uh because I I don't know about you but if you found that if you shower and then you get out of the shower you immediately want to take another shower because like you just feel like it's just so heavy and it's so hot and you know people say how do you live in Arizona well we have a secret right air conditioning we don't tell anybody because when I'm to move here but because they're like how can you live where it's 120. I don't stay out when it's 120 I'm in air conditioning like how do you live when it's you know 95 and 95 humidity you probably got air conditioning I mean kind of works the same in Arizona is here I know my sister years ago she lives in Alaska and years ago she uh um had come to my parents home and it was really and this is off the subject but she had come to my parents home and um one of the my my parents friends was there and they're asking her about Alaska now she lives just outside Anchorage in a town called Wasilla Anchorage is a modern city and the the family is the the person is asking her she's like so do you have igloos Where You Are you know I mean how do you guys get your food we go to the store I I have a pickup truck and a house because it's modern Alaska it's not like you know Eskimo Igloo Alaska although they have those but she lived in a you know Anchorage is a modern city it's got an airport it's got airplanes they got all those things even 20 years ago or 30 years ago they had those things uh but it's funny how people's perception of things is based on what little knowledge that they might possibly have so for someone from the south that's living in humidity and all that stickiness and that and they're like how can you survive in Arizona it's like brother I do the same thing you do I get out of that stickiness and I get an air conditioning and I stay in it until I have to go out in the stickiness and survive but one of the things that I want to point out about natural air conditioning is that you can have an environment around you right that's hot it's muggy it's sticky and you can actually live outside of that environment or actually inside that environment because you're protected and encapsulated in something that's controlled because right now this building's temperature is controlled by that little thing back there and it's controlling that temperature and because it's controlling that temperature we don't have to suffer with the fact that I want like I would be poor and sweat right now and trying to preach to you and in some foreign countries that's the way it is like you're Outdoors whatever the temp is that's what it is but here we get to enjoy something right we we get to enjoy a presence of air conditioning around us and that presence keeps us and we're encapsulated from it and so even though outside there might be somebody walking by that's suffering because they're out in the Heat and maybe they're getting hyperthermic and maybe one of you is sitting under a vent today and going it's really chilly in here why because outside it's hot outside it could be miserable but inside you're protected you're encapsulated you're surrounded by something so if you could go to the tile number three and I don't know that you can zoom in but so the actual title in my sermon today air conditioning is actually air conditioning Heir conditioning not air conditioning it's Heir conditioning I know that I kind of squeeze that together I kind of did it on purpose but that's actually Heir conditioning because air conditioning is taking place right now the scripture teaches us this Galatians 3 29 just tile 17 and if you could be Christ then are you Abraham said in heirs according to the promise so we're heirs today you're in Heir according to the promise now I believe I'm talking to wheat today I believe that seed is planted in You by Christ I believe that's why we're gathered together I think all those things are in you but you got a sticky nature right and you got a sticky nature so you want to know what you need to do to fix that sticky nature you got to be air-conditioned ACI are conditioned you have to come under the influence of that air conditioning and that air conditioning is actually changing your live Saints today it's actually drawing you closer to him every day that you're here and you're like listen brother Chris these things happen I've got all these trials and tests that are happening I I don't understand what's taking place and then you know my co-workers on my word I'm with these co-workers and there's something else and you know this music every time I go to the store and they got all these things on the shelves and everything else yeah all those things are out there but you're encapsulated today you're actually in something better than this building and with better control than what's there because Jesus Christ is able to air condition you to such a point that that sticky nature doesn't have the same hold on you that it has on everybody else that gross Darkness that's around the world that you're under right now that we you know where you can see it you can kind of feel it's kind of there that doesn't have the same effect you know it's kind of an interesting thing I I know that the Super Bowl was here not that long ago and one of the things that I kept hearing on the radio about the Super Bowl was oh you got to get down where the Super Bowl experience is because in that Super Bowl experience there was just this something in the air late there's like a tension or something and I suppose if you go to different events and you get enough people in there you can have that kind of something in the air right there's just something there's there's a tension there's a there there's it's just like oh I gotta get there I gotta I gotta experience this I gotta throw a football to a pro football player I got to do something like that it's very exciting I got to do that because there's something in the air it's Super Bowl everything's super right you got to have everything super supersonic speed we got to have super whatever Superman's doing stuff you know everybody's super but that experience you got to partake in it because there's something in the air right but Christ while that that thing is in the air and it's around you and it surrounds you Jesus Christ makes sure that you're protected he makes sure that you're under a different conditioning process because you're not being conditioned in the negative to receive those negative promises because there are promises lord said hey this is what I'm going to do to the children of Disobedience right this is what's going to happen but your promises are positive and amen right those promises are positive and amen to everyone that believes so here we are heirs according to the promise would we agree there were heirs okay so we know we've got gross Darkness around right that's where we live but yet Saints you can live in a different atmosphere you can exit that atmosphere and come in where something is controlled something is different now there's an interesting thing about the the building that we're in and the air conditioning that you're under right now now some of you undoubtedly are probably a little cool I don't know what the temperature is Philip you could probably say but um some of you are probably hot because as we started out the day we didn't have so many bodies in here right and as our bodies start to heat we get a little bit warmer and everybody gets a little bit warmer but some of you are probably sitting under a vent and if you're sitting under a vent you're nice and cool I hope but for the sake of the sermon you're nice and cool okay because you have to help me out here you got to give a brother a little help but why is it that you're nice and cool and somebody else maybe isn't so maybe they're not quite as pleasant as you are because you made a choice when you walked in the door right you decided where you were going to sit and maybe well some of you kids maybe you didn't decide where you're going to sit somebody that brought you in here said you're sitting here like Dad said Dave this is your seat take a seat right sometimes sometimes things happen because other people make choices and it affects our lives but just as often it's our choices that we do and it affects the the effect of what's actually taking place so while there's air conditioning available and that that presence is there that encapsulation is there maybe the effect because of the choice that we've made isn't having the same effect on us that it's having on someone else so here's the secret get to the vent you got to get to where the air is moving right you got to get to the right thing and and with the Lord the secret is get in the spirit because the spirit is where the power is the spirit is where that control is the spirit is where that that changes you and it makes you different the spirit is where you really get conditioned into something because without that Spirit I'm sorry but you're going to have the effects of that coming in if in other words this if we can't control that thermostat if there's not a control there and that thing's not working right eventually what's outside comes inside right it starts to affect deeper and deeper in this place so that Spirit of the Lord actually moves and does something and changes and makes things happen you know I don't think it's a coincidence that that the scripture teaches us that Christ breathed on them and said receive the Holy Ghost and then when the Holy Ghost came I don't think it was a coincidence that the Holy Ghost came with a rushing Mighty Wind right now we realize that he deals with us in a still small voice but yet what was Christ doing yeah you've got a prince and power of the air called the enemy or the devil right but he's not in control so the Lord was just using air to say hey I've got power too right I've got something too there's something here that I have so when I breathe out and when I have a wind come it's going to have an effect and that effect is going to change people and it's going to take them right out of gross darkness and right into the promises of God because they're Heirs of something we're Heirs of the promise so the promise has been given we know that we have a promise of eternal life we know that we have a promise that that Christ is going to live in us we know that we have all these promises we have promises of healing right we have promises of virtue we have promises of peace and joy we have these different promises yet in the promises we have trials why why because you're you're being conditioned to receive something so Abraham and Sarah right here they're going through their life they've they've got something going on for 25 years we know from the scripture and we won't read it today but from the scripture we we know that they've been waiting on a promise right the whole time Abraham and they're having to endure this time because I don't know about you but if if you know somebody that's about 90 years old walks up to me and says I'm going to have a baby I'm like okay God bless you talk to you later gotta go got something to do but so they're having to endure so Saints what is it that they're having to endure it's it's the fact that that promise hasn't manifested yet or maybe isn't manifesting but yet the promise is already working the what's happening in their lives is they're already being conditioned to receive the promised son right that conditioning is always happening in Abraham's Grace Covenant it's not on the on the slides um the brother Brandon was talking about you know Abram had something to do and the Lord had something to do and so um brother branham's talking about the particular situation here and and and and that the fact that you know um Sarah becomes young again and so he's like well yeah prove that she became young it's like well look at she goes to where abimelech is and you know abimelech who's this ruler that can have the choice of any women in the Kingdom because that's kind of what the the you know the king got or the the ruler got he got that opportunity to pick anybody he wanted and then he's attracted to the grandma that shows up right yeah he's like ah you you beautiful young women I don't want you I want this old lady right there I I love her I'm so attracted to her I want her but what he was showing was that look at for all those years that they were walking they were being conditioned to receive something and all the years that you're walking Saints you're being conditioned to receive something now when Sarah got to the body change and and we're talking a little bit about that today when she got to the body change yeah she became a young woman again but that wasn't the end of it because remember even when she was a young woman so she's 20 years old whatever she can't have children 30 years old she can't have children 40 years old she can't have children so she gets to be an old woman still hasn't had a child but after that conditioning had taken place and then there's a new condition that takes place right because now the promise is being made manifest that new condition takes place and now not only has she turned young again but she's also able to bring forth life and that's exactly what the Lord's doing with us it's not just the fact that you're going to turn young again now for some of you that are younger you're going to get older so I don't know if that's a happy feeling or not when I was younger I was excited about being older until I got older and then I want to be younger again but you know that's kind of how it is right you when you're younger you get older and some of you I'm sorry if you're 18 to 20 years old not much change so you're just kind of maybe a little bit but not not too much happening so for the older ones and the younger ones maybe it's a little bit easier to get excited about things like that but there's a change that's taking place and that change is not just to bring you you know a nice young body for a meeting in the air it's not just for that that changes to actually bring forth life and that's what's happening as you're bringing forth life and that life it becomes such a manifestation of something that when you're caught away here's the other part of the change that's taking place the condition that you're in right now and I know I I preach on space I I'm sorry I'm not preaching on Space today but we're preaching on air which is kind of close and even in the definition I think it said space so we're kind of hitting on it but one of the other things that has to take place is that you're going to have a body change to the point that you don't need a spaceship hey you don't need an astronaut suit I don't know about you but that's pretty impressive to me because if you're going to meet the Lord in the air that body has to change in such a way that you can do that there has to be something such a great change in you that you can actually take off of this planet without a propulsion system without a special suit on without Elon Musk being a part of it or or uh Bezos being a part of it Jeff Bezos whatever you don't need those things because God is conditioning a body change in you right now and I know when we look in the mirror we don't see that but we do see what Satan's doing all the time so Saints if he's doing that imagine how much more God's doing what he promised to do God is taking care of that situation and he's making sure that you're going to get there so we know absolutely beyond a shadow of a doubt what's taking place in our lives you're being air-conditioned right now your body is changing don't see it you know I guess we that are alive and remain I I guess you know we we can say yeah that's awesome we're going to change young but imagine the change that you're going to have if you're somebody that's already went to the Grave right some go to the Grave some go to the Sea some go to the Crematory I mean but yet they have that change coming too and because before they went out of this life there was something that conditioned them to prepare them for that day so we know when we understand that they're just waiting in a place to be called just to meet the same meaning that we're going to their meeting too so those changes are actually taking place but again I want to stress to you in in this particular sermon that air conditioning is so important for us it's something that has to take place and so when you have a test or you have a trailer you have these things that you go through understand that the Lord is actually conditioning you to something so let me give a personal example when I was a young person and this was a long time ago kids so it's okay I was young at one point when I was a young person I I was uh um my brothers were kind of the like the Rough and Tumble boys and I wasn't so I was the youngest in the family of seven um and and they tended to be especially the the middle boys tended to be kind of hotheads and I wasn't and so I'm thinking yeah pretty good you know people would do things to me and I couldn't stay mad at anybody for more than five minutes like it just that was my nature that was the nature I was born with you know some of us are born with a nature to be bold So when you say oh they needed boldness some people are just born with the nature they're just in your face like they're just bold that's your natural you know that's what you're born with right you're just that's the way you are some of us are are quiet from birth I mean that's just the way we are right you say well you need to have a Meek and quiet Spirit whether I was born with that like you know but the reality is when you're going through these things I'm going to use my own personal example here when you're going through these things there's a reason because in my thinking I'm thinking you know I I'm doing pretty good like I don't really get upset it takes a lot and even if people did stuff mean to me or whatever you know five minutes later I'm over it it just that was just my personality I was optimistic that's the nature I was born with and then guess what happened life anybody anybody have life happen to you yeah well it happened to brother Chris life happened it kind of Hit me hard and one day I realized that actually people could do things to the point that I would be angry a lot longer than five minutes and I would be upset a lot longer than that but what the Lord was doing was he was having to show me that listen you're relying on your own natural ability and sometimes you got to not rely on that because I had that natural ability but the Lord had to show me listen that's not where it's at you've got to find this in me because if you're relying on your natural ability to be bold or to be meek or to be humble or whatever it is if you're relying on that guess what's coming some kind of trial some kind of test and we call it life because it's coming at you because the Lord is going to condition you to receive exactly what it is that you have need of he's going to make sure under his air conditioning Heir conditioning that that air conditioning is going to take you beyond what you think you're capable of doing and Beyond what you even maybe were born with the ability to do and it's going to take you into a realm where things change and life changes and you can see that not just that Satan is making some kind of perfect Eden but God is bringing us back to a perfect place and at the same time that we can see the effects of what's going on outside here that we can understand that the Lord is working and the Lord is doing these things in a greater way in his children the problem is that sticky nature the sticky nature confuses us but when you get in the encapsulated area of the Holy Ghost because remember Abraham and Sarah who they had to meet Melchizedek right you got to meet Christ if you if you haven't met Christ you've got to meet him and you got to have that personal relationship and you have to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost because that's that that air of the Holy Ghost the power that spirit that moves that's the one that actually has to be in control that's the one that has to change your natural gifts or your natural abilities into something that God can use and to where we're not thinking man naturally I'm I'm pretty good I'm a great guy you know I don't get mad I don't get angry and then you realize that actually yeah you do actually yeah you need to work on that actually there's something here that that needs to take place in your life and something has to change and there's something that takes place so so under these different things and um in Abraham's Grace Covenant brother Branham says something to this way he says we which are alive and sorry we which are alive shall be changed in a moment twinkling of an eye an old man will be young an old woman will be young again and will be conditioned to meet the promised son Glory Hallelujah that's the next thing in God's order now we meet him here but not a formal introduction like you're going to have coming right because we have to meet Christ here that's if if you are Christ the scripture says right then we're heirs so that means you've got to be his you have to meet him you have to invite him in you have to make these things happen you have to be a part of that atmosphere already and then when you do that then then Christ works on that conditioning to get you to the place to where you have that formal introduction right where something actually happens there in the super sign brother Branham says this he can make everything work according to his big time clock that's ticking away for he could foretell the end from the beginning and therefore he knew that we would live in this day he knew that this would be our day he had plans for this day he has had plans for every day and never has one of his plans ever failed he's always on time and and and in the greatest news flash in history he says look at uh he would meet them at a certain designation so he's talking about Christ and the disciples he said hey we're going to meet at this certain place like you know go to the other side and we're going to meet you there so there was a designated place so there's a designation for us this morning and actually kind of going into another sermon but there's a designation and it says I'll meet you in the morning in the air right so you've got a designated place to go to and you're going to be conditioned to get to that place and that conditioning is taking place all the time it's something that's moving and breathing and changing and having a different effect on different people and it's causing us to get there from where we are today I'm skipping through a lot of these things I had to take I had so many notes that I had or slides that I had to cut them down because I knew that I would be really long I'm thinking I'm doing not too bad on time see the only thing is it's kind of like this uh for a preacher you have to just be shorter than the other preacher right for people to appreciate you it's kind of like it's kind of like if if you're you know if you're there's a bear chasing you how fast do you have to be just faster than the slowest person that's there right you just as long as you're a little bit faster than them everything's good so that's what we're trying to do but I want to as we we're going to bring this to a close I I hope that you're understanding that while we're in this world there and there's negative around and we can acknowledge those things let's not forget the fact that we're being conditioned as well and that you can be encapsulated by something and you can be protected by something and you can be taken out of something to the point that you can actually see Christ moving and Christ changing and when we have the trials and tests that are happening we can understand that listen this is just to get you to a promise so you've been given a promise and then the promise is going to manifest just like with um with Abraham and Sarah they were given a promise tests and Trials happen then the promise manifested right and that's the same thing for us Saints given a promise a lot of promises those promises are coming to pass as as we sit here actually and and those effects are actually taking place but there's something greater right that is coming and everything that's happening now is just preparing you so that trial that you had to go through and and it wasn't pleasant and there may be trials coming down the road that aren't Pleasant there may be tests that are coming down the road that aren't Pleasant I know some of us have endured wounds that are are deep and and you know I know this I've met people in my personal life that that I don't know how they endure I mean it astounds me because by God's grace I haven't had to endure what they have but yet God gives them Grace so you know everybody goes through different things and people handle things differently in their lives but I just want you to remember this so we understand this particular thing that um that while there's a prince and power of the air there is a prince and power of the air h-e-i-r okay and that that particular one um through his spirit is not just the prince and power of the air but he's also the the Prince of Peace to that air he's the Mighty God to that air he's the counselor to that Heir he's he's the comforter to that Heir he's the king to that air all these things he's the Everlasting father so this on Father's Day he's the Everlasting father to his heirs he is all these things so there's a reason that the Lord meets Us in the air I think it's the show Satan look at you you you're thinking that you got this thing under control right you think that you like this gross Darkness you're in control of this buddy you're not in control of anything because just to show you I'm going to condition my children to the point that they're going to meet in the place that you think you control we could have met anywhere we could have met on Jupiter I mean Lord could have said hey promise we're going to meet on Jupiter but that's not what he said he said we're we're going to meet in the air where are we meeting in what Satan considers to be his domain but brother sister God is the prince and power of the air h-e-i-r he's The Prince and power of you okay and that conditioning everything that's necessary for you all the conditions that are necessary for you to meet are being met in Jesus Christ and that Holy Ghost is breathing and is powerful and is moving and if we invite him in in a greater way if we sing the songs I have a lot of scriptures written down here but I'm going to try and bring this to a close that just the things that the Lord is doing and and how he's actually working in us to make us into that image to to bring us into that place and all those different scriptures are pointing to is the fact that God is doing something in our lives and he's making something in our lives so when you go out in the world today and you go to take Dad to to lunch or if you're doing that I don't know but if you're going to take father to lunch for Father's Day hopefully one there's not a lot of crowds but hopefully too that you'll remember this that you're you're under a particular umbrella you're under a a protection you're in a protected area you're under a complete thing that is able to condition you to the point that you can be in this world and not of this world and when when you're reviled just like Christ when somebody speaks something evil against you you can respond with kindness and when you're uh you know you feel like somebody has wronged you you can actually take the lower seat and apologize to them instead you can actually do those things because the spirit of Christ rests on you and it has done something to you and it has changed you and made you into something different why don't you stand with me you know isn't it amazing that the Lord gives us comfort you know he could have been he could have been when when the Holy Ghost came the Lord could have sent it said anything you know as far as what that particular thing was going to be he could have said you know this is going to be a mighty warrior this is going to be a defeater of enemies this is going to be what everybody said I'm sending you the comforter right because just like air conditioning is a comfort on a hot day that Holy Ghost comforter is a comfort to The Heirs that are being conditioned to receive the promise of God um I'm actually in in the uh in the hopefully this is okay but I'm in the um I don't want to say mood but I I feel like singing something that that is fast and uplifting so earlier today we we sang he brought me out and I'd like to sing that again because [Music] um he brought us out Saints and then not only did did he bring us out but he didn't just leave us there then he brought us in and he he shared something with us and he shared promises with us and he took us to a different place and he's taking us to a different place because he's shared those things with us and saints of God your heirs according to the promise amen your Heirs of Christ according to his promise according to his promise he'll fulfill it made an unconditional Covenant with Abraham Abraham I'm going to do this guess what he did with the bride of Christ same exact thing I'm gonna have a bride gonna absolutely have it do you have to worry about it no you can rest in him we can rest in him this morning I don't know if you can bring up the words that he brought me out but if it's okay we're going to sing a few
