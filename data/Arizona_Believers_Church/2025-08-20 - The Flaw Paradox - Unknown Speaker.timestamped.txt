[0:00] Isaiah chapter 53 and I'd like to read
[0:03] the whole thing. These 12 verses are so
[0:07] rich. Who hath believed our report. And
[0:09] to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?
[0:11] For he shall grow up before him as a
[0:13] tender plant and as a root out of a dry
[0:16] ground. He hath no form nor clumliness.
[0:19] And when we see shall see him, there is
[0:21] no beauty that we should desire him. Now
[0:23] remember this. This is about Jesus
[0:25] Christ. This is the Messiah, the son of
[0:28] God, the king of glory.
[0:30] He is He is despised and rejected of
[0:33] men, a man of sorrows and acquainted
[0:35] with grief. And we have hid we hid as it
[0:38] were our faces from him. He was despised
[0:41] and we esteemed him not. Surely he hath
[0:43] borne our griefs and carried our
[0:44] sorrows. Yet we did esteem him stricken,
[0:47] smitten of God, and afflicted. But he
[0:50] was wounded for our transgressions. He
[0:51] was bruised for our iniquities. The
[0:53] chastisement of our peace was upon him.
[0:55] And with his stripes we are healed. We
[0:59] like sheep have gone astray. We have
[1:00] turned everyone to his own way. And the
[1:02] Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us
[1:05] all. He was oppressed and he was
[1:07] afflicted yet he opened not his mouth.
[1:08] He's brought as the lamb to the
[1:10] slaughter and as a sheep before his
[1:11] shears is dumb. So he opened not not his
[1:14] mouth. He was taken from prison and from
[1:16] judgment. And who shall declare his
[1:17] generation? For he was cut off out of
[1:19] the land of the living. For the
[1:20] transgression of my people was he
[1:22] stricken? And he made his grave with the
[1:24] wicked, with the rich in his death,
[1:27] because he had done no violence, neither
[1:29] was any deceit in his mouth. Yet it
[1:31] pleased the Lord to bruise him. He hath
[1:33] put him to grief. When thou shalt make
[1:35] his soul an offering for sin, he shall
[1:37] see his seed. He shall prolong his days,
[1:39] and the pleasure of the Lord shall
[1:40] prosper in his hand. He shall see of the
[1:43] tr of the travail of his soul, and shall
[1:46] be satisfied. By his knowledge shall my
[1:48] righteous servant justify many, for he
[1:50] shall bear their iniquities. Therefore
[1:52] will I divide him a portion with the
[1:54] great, and he shall divide the spoil
[1:55] with the strong, because he hath poured
[1:57] out his soul unto death, and he was
[1:59] numbered with the transgressors, and he
[2:01] bear the sin of many, and made
[2:03] intercession for the transgressors. My,
[2:08] this is just amazing. Let's pray again.
[2:10] And heavenly father, Lord, I truly
[2:12] desire that as we've entered all these
[2:14] verses into the record that you could
[2:16] now amplify these to us in a way that
[2:19] not only helps us understand you, but
[2:21] understand the example of us for us.
[2:23] That we could stand as he did in the
[2:26] midst of all the suffering and please
[2:29] you that we too our days could be
[2:31] prolonged and we could receive this
[2:32] blessed inheritance that we have in
[2:34] Christ. We ask this in the name of the
[2:36] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. You can be
[2:39] seated.
[2:40] My title tonight is the flaw paradox. I
[2:44] taught maybe calling it the paradox of
[2:46] the flaw. My original working title was
[2:49] the masterpiece paradox and had been
[2:51] preparing these things. And I guess I
[2:53] could say in a lot of ways this is what
[2:55] I didn't finish on Sunday. And so this
[2:58] is a continuation of all these services
[3:00] we've been preaching. Nothing new. Uh
[3:02] it's just all flowing together. Early
[3:04] Monday morning. uh my thought
[3:06] crystallized just exactly on this
[3:08] particular subject of this paradox and
[3:11] on Sunday speaking about grace over
[3:14] shame and that uh that uh that subject
[3:18] if I could phrase it this way we looked
[3:19] at the paradox of nakedness and how that
[3:22] there's this emptiness or lacking
[3:24] there's this being stripped bare and
[3:25] you're laid bare and you have nothing to
[3:28] offer and nothing to bring yet there is
[3:30] this without that nakedness there is no
[3:33] grace if you use anything to try to
[3:35] cover yourself, you use anything to try
[3:37] to protect yourself, then it's almost as
[3:39] if God God's grace can't fully envelop
[3:42] you. So, we have to have that nakedness
[3:44] that it's a paradox of it. You have to
[3:46] be needy to be full. You have to be
[3:49] lacking. You have to be empty. And so,
[3:51] grace cannot cover us if we use our
[3:53] human efforts to shield us from shame.
[3:56] When we feel shame, we want to we want
[3:58] to make sure we don't feel shame. We
[3:59] feel bad. We want to make sure we don't
[4:00] feel bad. And so, we use all sorts of
[4:02] mechanisms to do so. But in this uh uh
[4:05] this brokenness or this nakedness, we
[4:08] have to em accept the shame and embrace
[4:11] it and admit our our lacking in order
[4:13] for grace to be sufficient. And it's
[4:15] Christ who makes it possible. Through
[4:17] Christ, he makes it possible that we
[4:19] could be once again naked but not
[4:22] ashamed.
[4:23] &gt;&gt; Not ashamed. Not through innocence, not
[4:25] through sinless perfection, but through
[4:27] grace. That now through his grace,
[4:30] through Jesus Christ, we could be naked
[4:31] and not ashamed. And so if you're naked
[4:33] and ashamed, there's a lot of things you
[4:35] can try to do to outrun that shame. Uh
[4:38] but yet when you just admit, I'm naked
[4:40] and and I need God's grace and nothing
[4:42] else I can offer. I can't offer any
[4:44] other efforts or conclusions. I'm just
[4:46] going to accept the fact that I'm needy
[4:48] and then his grace can step in and cover
[4:50] you. And you could you're still naked,
[4:52] but you're not ashamed. And so we know
[4:54] that Jesus Christ, as we're reading
[4:56] here, he was the sinless son of God, and
[4:59] he is the example of us for us. So, we
[5:02] can't be sinless. We're not to be in the
[5:04] sense that he was. We're not to be a
[5:06] sacrifice for sin and that he was called
[5:07] to it. But yet, he exemplifies this
[5:10] paradox of nakedness.
[5:13] But then there's also, as I'm calling it
[5:14] tonight, the flaw paradox or the paradox
[5:17] of flaws. And I'll hope you help maybe
[5:20] define what I mean by flaws as we go
[5:22] through this. In John 18:es 33-4, I'd
[5:26] like just to go through this moment of
[5:28] the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. And in
[5:31] doing so, uh, we'll be able to see, uh,
[5:35] the time of his crucifixion, we'll just
[5:37] see some of these things, uh, uh, put
[5:39] them in view. Our last youth meeting we
[5:41] spoke on is what is truth. My
[5:43] inspiration for that was everyone's
[5:45] going back to school. And if you go back
[5:47] to school, whether you're doing it at
[5:48] home or you're doing it uh, in in
[5:50] college or go to a public school or a a
[5:53] charter school or private school, you're
[5:55] going to be hearing a lot of facts, a
[5:57] lot of information. But what we want to
[5:59] know above all that is truth. And so I
[6:01] addressed it to the young people knowing
[6:03] we were going back to school. And we use
[6:05] this script these scriptures here. John
[6:07] 18:es 33 to 40. Brother Rowan, if I lose
[6:10] my place, you know everything I spoke on
[6:12] that day and you can help me get back in
[6:13] my spot. Then Pilate entered into the
[6:16] judgment hall again and called Jesus and
[6:18] said unto him, "Art thou the king of the
[6:19] Jews?" Jesus answered him, saying,
[6:23] answered him, "Sayest thou this thing of
[6:25] thyself? Uh, or did others tell it to
[6:29] thee? Very good. Tell it thee of me.
[6:31] It's very good question. Is this do you
[6:33] want to know because you're wondering or
[6:35] did someone else tell you that I claim
[6:37] to be this or that I am? Pilate
[6:39] answered, "Am I a Jew? Thine nation and
[6:40] the chief priest have delivered thee
[6:42] unto me. What hast thou done?" As Jesus
[6:45] answered, Jesus answered, "My kingdom is
[6:47] not of this world. If my kingdom were of
[6:50] this world, then would my servants fight
[6:52] that I should not be delivered to the
[6:54] Jews. But now is my kingdom not from
[6:56] hence. Very beautiful answer to explain
[6:59] why he was in this situation because
[7:01] he's saying if my kingdom is of this
[7:03] world then we would have fought this
[7:05] battle a little bit differently.
[7:07] &gt;&gt; Uh my position my calling and who I am
[7:09] in Jesus Christ would have been defended
[7:11] with swords. My life would have been
[7:13] defended with with opposition and a
[7:16] revolution. But saying my kingdom is not
[7:17] from here. So I'm not going to engage
[7:19] with you in this intellectual physical
[7:21] battle. Pilate therefore said unto him,
[7:23] "Art thou a king?" Then Jesus
[7:26] answered,"I think that's a good
[7:27] response." So he's saying, "My kingdom."
[7:29] Well, if he's saying, "My kingdom and
[7:31] having some ownership over it." Pilate
[7:33] realizes that he's claiming to be a king
[7:35] somewhere. Maybe Pilate thinks in
[7:38] another region, another part of this
[7:39] vast world. Jesus answered, "Thou sayest
[7:42] that I am a king. To this end was I
[7:45] born." What end? To be a king? Or is it
[7:48] what he's facing at this moment? And for
[7:50] this cause came I into the world that I
[7:52] should bear witness of the truth. So
[7:55] this is the cause to bear witness of the
[7:57] truth. Everyone that is of the truth
[7:59] heareth my voice. That's thus sayeth the
[8:02] Lord.
[8:02] &gt;&gt; If you are of truth then you will hear
[8:05] his voice. So it's not a question of
[8:07] whether or not you can become truth.
[8:09] It's not a whether or not you have the
[8:11] ear to hear it or the diligence to find
[8:14] it. If you are of truth, you'll hear the
[8:16] voice of truth which is Jesus Christ. So
[8:19] Pilate's response to this Pilate saith
[8:21] unto him what is truth
[8:24] and when he said what is truth and when
[8:27] he had said this he went out again unto
[8:28] the Jews. Now what does that tell us? He
[8:33] did not inquire of Jesus who just
[8:36] claimed to be that he is a witness of
[8:39] the truth and that if you are of the
[8:42] truth you would hear his voice. He
[8:44] doesn't ask him what is truth to know
[8:46] it. He said it dismissively.
[8:49] He wasn't actually seeking truth. He
[8:51] wasn't actually wanting to know truth.
[8:52] He says, "What is truth?" Brother
[8:54] Phillip, you might remember when you
[8:56] said, "Pastor, right? It's more
[8:58] dismissive. What is what is truth
[9:00] anyways? What does that even mean?" He
[9:02] wasn't wanting to know truth. He was
[9:04] really wanting just to get out of what
[9:06] was happening in the moment. Didn't like
[9:07] the position he's being put in. And when
[9:09] he said this, he went out again unto the
[9:11] Jews and saith unto them, what a
[9:13] interesting statement after dismissively
[9:15] saying what is truth. I find in him no
[9:17] fault at all. I want to come back to
[9:20] that. But you have a custom that I
[9:22] should release unto you one at the
[9:24] Passover.
[9:25] Will ye therefore that I release unto
[9:27] you the king of the Jews? Then cried
[9:30] they all again saying, not this man, but
[9:32] Barabbus. And then I love how John puts
[9:35] it here. Now Barabbus was a robber.
[9:38] It's kind of that interesting. Now
[9:39] Barabbus was a robber, right? The one
[9:41] whom Jesus loved. John just had a really
[9:42] neat way of writing these things. And
[9:44] not only was he a robber, but when you
[9:46] look at the into the Bible and the
[9:47] history and the tradition of Barabbus,
[9:49] he was a murderer. He was a rebel
[9:50] rouser. He had caused insurrections. He
[9:52] he was not a good person whatsoever. The
[9:55] things that you could relate to his
[9:56] charge were much worse than that of
[9:58] Jesus. And yet the people despised him
[10:01] so much that they would rather have
[10:03] Barabus
[10:05] than Jesus Christ. And so Jesus
[10:08] proclaims himself as the voice of truth.
[10:11] Pilate kind of under his breath it
[10:13] seems. And I don't think he's
[10:14] necessarily being true, you know,
[10:16] earnest about what is truth. But he
[10:18] questions what truth is. And then he
[10:21] answers the question with his own words.
[10:25] He stands before the people and he says,
[10:27] "I find in him the voice of truth. I
[10:30] find in him the king of the Jews. I find
[10:32] in him whose kingdom is not from here no
[10:34] fault at all." In other words, there's
[10:37] no crime. There's no offense. There's no
[10:39] guilt. There is no basis for condemning
[10:42] him to die. He is not as you have
[10:44] accused him of.
[10:47] &gt;&gt; You that have delivered him unto me. You
[10:49] have delivered one of your own. You of
[10:50] your own people have set you on trial.
[10:52] And I look at him according to your
[10:54] accusations. And I declare that he is
[10:57] not false according to your standards.
[10:58] He says, I find in him no fault.
[11:02] Yet Paul uh Pilate making this
[11:04] declaration, we could say Jesus's
[11:06] current predicament works against the
[11:08] narrative of him being a guiltless king
[11:11] who has a kingdom that it seems very
[11:14] self- serving. Well, if my army was
[11:15] closer, they would not let me be in this
[11:17] position and if my army was not from
[11:19] then you know there's a lot of excuses
[11:20] sometimes that are offered, but it his
[11:22] situation does not seem to be becoming
[11:25] of one who is a guiltless king.
[11:28] There were many accusations brought
[11:30] against him and there's ample reason to
[11:32] reject or even question his authenticity
[11:35] or the authenticity of his claims as
[11:37] being the son of God and the Messiah.
[11:41] And though they these there were these
[11:44] question marks and these uh the
[11:46] situation he was in he had no fault but
[11:51] he had many flaws.
[11:54] And when I use this term, it's when he
[11:56] had flaws, it's not in the sense of
[11:57] blame or guilt because there was no
[11:59] fault in him. But even our English word
[12:02] flaw kind of comes from they say it's
[12:04] maybe Scandinavian in its origin, but a
[12:06] splinter
[12:08] there of a flaw is like a brokenness,
[12:11] something that would make you
[12:12] uncomfortable or unsettling. So when he
[12:13] says, I find no fault in him at all,
[12:15] it's not said in such a way to where
[12:17] anybody looking at this guy would say
[12:19] he's tall, he's handsome, likes to hunt,
[12:22] right? the Cardinals fan, all those
[12:24] things we might think of to think of
[12:25] somebody that we really really like. It
[12:27] wasn't that you could just look at him
[12:28] and say, "This guy is flawless." No, he
[12:30] was without fault, but there was a lot
[12:32] of things about him that maybe we could
[12:34] say sticky or makes you uncomfortable.
[12:36] There was maybe a lot of flaws,
[12:37] especially from the human perspective.
[12:40] Calling this the flaw paradox. I'm
[12:42] wanting you to identify yourself in
[12:43] this. According to the Bible, Jesus
[12:45] Christ had many features that we could
[12:47] say as humans are considered to be
[12:49] negatives. As we read in Isaiah chapter
[12:52] 53, we could say he did no violence. He
[12:55] did not lie. Yet still his life and
[12:57] testimony was full of reproaches. He was
[13:00] uncumbling. He turned our faces as it
[13:03] were. The Bible says that if you really
[13:05] looked at him and you saw him, you'd
[13:06] say, "Oh my goodness."
[13:09] Bible says he was sorrowful and
[13:11] characterized by grief. I'm just reading
[13:12] through Isaiah 53 here, but I'm trying
[13:14] to do it in a way that we can keep our
[13:15] momentum. This implies a a a weak and
[13:18] haggarded warned look and disposition
[13:22] that he's sorrowful and acquainted with
[13:23] grief and he he's kind of characterized
[13:25] by you'd see him like man this guy looks
[13:27] sad you know why the long face John 8:es
[13:31] 57 to 59 then said the Jews unto him
[13:34] thou art not yet 50 years old and hast
[13:36] thou seen Abraham
[13:38] Jesus said unto him verily verily I say
[13:40] unto you before Abraham was I am so even
[13:43] though he's a man around his early 30s
[13:46] he doesn't look like a young man,
[13:48] &gt;&gt; right? He he he like myself, I look like
[13:51] I'm 30, right? Right. Even though I'm
[13:54] 50. And so here is a man who's in his
[13:56] 30s and he makes a comment like you're
[13:58] what about 50? This is not not not not
[14:01] yet 50 years old. But they're kind of
[14:02] saying, you're you're probably getting
[14:04] close. You look old.
[14:06] Yeah. I think this is something for all
[14:07] of us to remind ourselves that you know
[14:09] nowadays at my age when you meet
[14:10] somebody you haven't seen in a long time
[14:12] you're like man they look old and so so
[14:15] so do you brother Aaron you just see
[14:17] yourself every day if you got to see
[14:19] yourself after 20 years you'd be like
[14:21] man poor guy looks tired but it says
[14:23] then took they up stones to cast at him
[14:26] so this is what this instinctive hatred
[14:28] they have for him but Jesus hid himself
[14:29] and went out of the temple going through
[14:31] the midst of them and so passed by
[14:34] so here his sorrowful ful disposition is
[14:37] being characterized as grief shows in
[14:39] even his physical appearance. The Bible
[14:42] says he was despised that means deemed
[14:44] worthless, held in contempt and rejected
[14:47] by man. John 2 18 to 20. Then answered
[14:51] of the Jews and said unto him, what sign
[14:53] showest thou unto us, seeing that thou
[14:54] dost these things? Jesus answered and
[14:57] said unto him, destroy this temple and
[14:59] in three days I will raise it up. Then
[15:01] then said the Jews, 40 and six years was
[15:03] this temple and building and will thou
[15:05] tear it up, rear it up in three days.
[15:08] Notice just how instinctively they
[15:10] choose to hate him or to reject what
[15:13] he's saying instead of saying, "Well,
[15:14] that's a weird saying. What do you mean
[15:16] by that?"
[15:19] Because he was despised. He was held in
[15:21] contempt. Everything that he said just
[15:22] seemed to bother these guys. He was
[15:24] oppressed. Oppressed, it means pressed
[15:27] and tried. The Bible, it says that he
[15:29] was imprisoned. He was judged. He was
[15:30] led to death and then in dying he was
[15:32] buried with the wicked.
[15:35] Luke 19:47 I'm reading of this king
[15:40] Jesus Christ the son of God the Messiah
[15:41] and he taught daily in the temple but
[15:43] the chief priests and the scribes and
[15:44] the chief of the people sought to
[15:47] destroy him.
[15:49] They wanted to destroy him. It is them
[15:51] that succeeded in destroying him. And
[15:54] then even Judas, one of his very own, is
[15:56] the one that kind of colludes with these
[15:58] that hate him. And in conspiring to
[16:01] destroy him, they set a plan in place
[16:03] that's going to cause him to be tried
[16:05] and to be crucified.
[16:07] But yet then the Bible tells us that his
[16:10] he was stricken, he was smitten, he was
[16:12] afflicted, he was wounded, he was
[16:14] bruised, he was chastised, and he was
[16:16] striped. But it was not the Jews that
[16:18] did this to him, but it pleased God that
[16:21] it would happen.
[16:23] says, "It pleased God to bruise him, to
[16:25] grieve him, to subject him, his soul to
[16:28] great travail."
[16:30] Just in taking one scripture
[16:33] and then using Isaiah 53 and then John
[16:35] 18 and then begin to look at Isaiah 53
[16:38] and see how this played out, you can see
[16:39] that his life was full of flaws,
[16:43] resistance,
[16:45] criticisms,
[16:47] contradiction is what the Bible refers
[16:49] to it as. And these contradictions
[16:51] caused him to be a reproach, caused
[16:53] rumor, innuendo, it caused him
[16:55] suffering, and ultimately it caused him
[16:56] death.
[16:58] In Matthew chapter 9 10-11, let's see
[17:01] how they harped on his flaws. And it
[17:02] came to pass as Jesus sat at meat in the
[17:04] house, behold, many publicans and
[17:06] sinners came and sat down with him and
[17:08] his disciples. And when the Pharisees
[17:10] saw it, they said unto his disciples,
[17:14] "Why eatth your master with publicans
[17:16] and sinners?
[17:23] can't even go to lunch without them
[17:26] throwing shade on him. Why does your
[17:29] master eat with publicans and sinners?
[17:30] They had a problem with the people he
[17:32] fellowshipped with and he was identified
[17:34] with in Luke 7 36-39. And one of the
[17:38] Pharisees desired him that he would eat
[17:40] with him and he went into the pre
[17:42] Pharisees house and sat down to meet.
[17:43] Once again, it's eating that gets them
[17:45] in trouble. I can relate. And behold, a
[17:47] woman in the city, which was a sinner,
[17:49] when she knew that Jesus sat at meet the
[17:51] Pharisees how brought house, brought an
[17:53] alabaster box of ointment, and stood at
[17:55] his feet behind him weeping, and began
[17:57] to wash his feet with tears, and did
[17:59] wipe them with the hairs of her head,
[18:01] and kissed his feet, and anointed them
[18:03] with ointment. I know that we if we read
[18:06] the Bible, we know the end of the story.
[18:08] We read the Bible believing the Bible is
[18:10] true, and we read about Christ having
[18:12] already accepted him as our savior. But
[18:13] if you could somehow separate yourself
[18:15] from the narrative you already
[18:17] understand and give it a little bit of a
[18:18] critical glance, you'd begin to
[18:20] recognize some of these things that
[18:21] people are saying about him might be
[18:23] like, "That's an interesting take."
[18:26] Had you not known who he was and you
[18:28] were invited to lunch also, and you saw
[18:30] a harlot and a prostitute come up behind
[18:32] him and begin to kiss sweetly on his
[18:34] feet and wash his feet, then maybe you
[18:36] would have responded the same way these
[18:38] Pharisees did.
[18:39] &gt;&gt; That's right. When the Pharisees which
[18:40] had bidden him saw it, he spake within
[18:42] himself, saying, "This man, if he were a
[18:45] prophet, would have known who and what
[18:47] manner of woman this is that touchth
[18:50] him, for she is a sinner."
[18:54] Notice just how full his life is of
[18:57] contradictions.
[19:02] If he was a prophet, he would have known
[19:04] this was a woman of ill repute. What
[19:07] prophet would let someone like this get
[19:09] that close to him?
[19:12] This would be another mark against the
[19:13] Messiah. In John 5:18, therefore the
[19:16] Jews sought the more to kill him. Why?
[19:19] Who did he kill? What did he do? Because
[19:21] he not only had broken the Sabbath,
[19:24] but said also that God was his father,
[19:26] making himself equal with God.
[19:29] Jesus in claiming to be of God or that
[19:32] God was his father. If you were to say
[19:34] to a Jew, or this is what they're
[19:36] claiming, God is my father, then you
[19:38] have made yourself equal with God. And
[19:40] that angered them to the point to where
[19:41] they wanted to kill him.
[19:42] &gt;&gt; You catch that? Remember that? We'll
[19:44] come back to it. Matthew 12:4, but when
[19:47] the Pharisees heard it, they said, "This
[19:48] fellow doth not cast out devils, but by
[19:51] be elabub, the prince of devils." So
[19:53] now, when he does perform a miracle, and
[19:56] the devils are cast out, they cannot
[19:58] just say, "Well, we can't quite figure
[19:59] that out. This is unreasonable to us.
[20:01] How could this man that seems to be
[20:03] going against the grain on everything we
[20:04] believe and teach, how can he perform
[20:06] this great miracle and then in some ways
[20:08] try to understand who he is or given the
[20:10] pit of the doubt? They said, "No, he
[20:12] must be doing it by evil power.
[20:15] &gt;&gt; He must be inspired by the devil. This
[20:17] must be hocus pocus. This must be my
[20:19] reading. He must be like all the other
[20:20] false prophets who've tried to do this
[20:22] before.
[20:24] Behold, this is your Messiah."
[20:27] Luke 23:es 1 and 2. And the whole
[20:29] multitude of them arose and led him unto
[20:31] Pilate. And they began to accuse him,
[20:33] saying, "We found this fellow perverting
[20:35] the nation." Wow. Quite an influencer.
[20:39] Perverting the nation and forbidding to
[20:41] give tribute to Caesar, saying that he
[20:42] himself is Christ a king. Now it's just
[20:45] outright lies
[20:47] &gt;&gt; because when he was tested and tempted
[20:49] and they said, "Who to whom should we
[20:51] give tribute?" He goes, "Well, whose
[20:52] image is on the coin?" They said,
[20:53] "Caesar." He said, "Then give to
[20:55] Caesar." What's Caesars's? In every
[20:57] opportunity they had to trip them up, he
[20:59] always had an answer. But it didn't keep
[21:01] them from just outright lying in the end
[21:03] to meet their selfish agenda.
[21:06] &gt;&gt; He perverts the nation. He forbids to
[21:08] give tribute. And he says that he
[21:10] himself is Christ, that he himself is
[21:12] Christ, a king. Doing so, not only has
[21:15] he blasphemed the Jews by being the
[21:17] Messiah, but now he's an affront to
[21:19] Pilate claiming to be a king.
[21:23] These are all the voices of criticisms
[21:25] and uh recontradictions,
[21:28] all the flaws that are being pointed out
[21:30] in his life. And we could say, did he
[21:32] eat with publicans and sinners? Yes, he
[21:34] did. Did he let a harlot wash his feet?
[21:36] Yes, he did. Did he heal on the Sabbath
[21:38] day? Yes, he did. Did he say God was his
[21:41] father? Yes, he did. Did he cast out
[21:42] devils? Yes, he did. Did he do it by the
[21:44] elab? No, he didn't.
[21:47] &gt;&gt; But yet, there's all these things you
[21:48] just begin to stack up against them.
[21:50] Jesus says in Matthew 11 18 and 19, for
[21:53] John came neither eating nor drinking.
[21:55] Now he begins to call their hypocrisy
[21:56] out and they say he hath the devil and
[22:00] John eating uh eating honey and and wild
[22:03] locust, you know. So his diet was
[22:05] inoffensive. I I still think that maybe
[22:07] the vegans might have a problem with
[22:09] eating locust. Uh let me know if that's
[22:11] true. But yet still he just managed to
[22:14] offend somebody enough to say that he
[22:16] had a devil. The son of man came eating
[22:18] and drinking and they say, "Behold a man
[22:20] gluttonous and a wine bber, a friend to
[22:22] publicans and sinners." This is their
[22:25] conclusions about him. I know sometimes
[22:27] we like to think that, well, Jesus
[22:29] Christ was perfect and it's everyone who
[22:30] came later that tried to find fault with
[22:32] him. But no, even in his days of his
[22:34] ministry, they called him gluttonous, a
[22:36] wine bibber, a friend to publicans and
[22:38] sinners. But they says, "But wisdom is
[22:40] justified of her children. They that are
[22:43] of the truth hear his voice."
[22:46] It's a beautiful statement. The wisdom
[22:48] is justified over children.
[22:50] But he claim they claim that he's
[22:52] gluttonous.
[22:53] He's a drunkard. And they had a problem
[22:56] with the people that he associated
[22:58] himself with
[23:00] from the publicans and sinners that are
[23:01] in the just the two chapters prior when
[23:03] it offended him to the woman that washed
[23:05] his feet. They said, "Did you know the
[23:07] people he hung out with? Do you see the
[23:09] ones that he associates with?" They used
[23:11] all of these things as flaws.
[23:14] In the sermon, taking sides with Jesus,
[23:16] brother Bram says, "But Jesus, they just
[23:18] tried to find every little shadow that
[23:20] they could find to try to belittle him
[23:22] in the sight of the people." And that's
[23:24] what the devil wants. They want to they
[23:26] want to hurt your influence before the
[23:28] people. That's the way. Now, I I love
[23:33] how he says this here because he's
[23:35] saying the devil wants to point out the
[23:37] flaws.
[23:39] And then at that point, we can just say,
[23:40] "Well, it doesn't matter what you do.
[23:42] They're going to criticize you. But then
[23:44] he says, "You want to watch careful what
[23:47] you do." Walk like real men of God. Talk
[23:52] like men of God. Act like men of God.
[23:55] Live like men of God. Think about the
[23:58] responsibility. We can't just say,
[23:59] "Well, we have an enemy. We have an
[24:00] adversary. They're going to lie on you.
[24:01] They're going to cheat on you." And
[24:02] Jesus said, "Well, Jesus said, "They're
[24:03] going to call me a wine ba. I might as
[24:05] well drink a little anyways." They're
[24:05] going to say, "I'm gluttonous. I might
[24:06] as well enjoy my meals." They're going
[24:07] to say, "I hang out with the rabel
[24:09] risers. I might well might as well have
[24:10] a nice circle of friends." They're going
[24:12] to say that I claim to be a king.
[24:13] They're going to say, "I did this. I say
[24:14] I do that. I might as well do it
[24:15] anyways." No.
[24:17] &gt;&gt; He says, "Still live like men of God
[24:19] because the devil, your adversary, is
[24:20] going about like a roaring lion trying
[24:22] to devour what he can." Why did they do
[24:24] this? He says, "They were jealous of
[24:26] him." That's what's the reason they
[24:29] tried to belittle him. They were jealous
[24:31] of his ministry. And that's the reason
[24:33] they were trying to belittle. He had the
[24:35] ministry of God, and they knew that, but
[24:36] it was contrary to their creed, their
[24:39] thirst, their desires. So they were
[24:42] trying to belittle him, make every
[24:44] little flaw that they could find get him
[24:46] out of the way. They wanted him to quit.
[24:51] They wanted the people to denounce him.
[24:54] The devil was trying to show every flaw
[24:56] he could to get Jesus to quit. Do you
[24:59] realize the easy part was just to get
[25:01] people to criticize? How easy is it for
[25:04] to get you to criticize?
[25:06] &gt;&gt; Someone says, "You will not believe what
[25:09] so and so did." they actually did this
[25:11] and that and you're like, I knew he was
[25:13] awful. Oh, I was just kidding. Hey, it
[25:17] it it doesn't take anything at all to
[25:19] get you to criticize somebody. But it
[25:21] wasn't just getting people to speak
[25:22] freely and criticize and belittle him.
[25:24] All those efforts were to put enough
[25:26] weight on Christ where he would just
[25:28] quit.
[25:30] &gt;&gt; These are the paradoxes of these flaws.
[25:36] As we spoke about the paradox of
[25:38] nakedness, we mentioned how nakedness
[25:39] there's the paradox was it's associated
[25:41] with birth and innocence, but then it's
[25:42] also associated with death.
[25:45] And in the life of Jesus Christ
[25:46] scripturally as we looked at these
[25:47] things and we saw these uh kind of uh
[25:51] moments where Jesus is doing something
[25:53] and he's immediately met with criticism.
[25:56] So in that glimpse that we have of him
[25:58] from 30 to 33 as we try to deduce from
[26:00] the Bible uh that he is being criticized
[26:02] at every turn. There's flaws, there's
[26:04] accusations, there's all sorts of things
[26:05] he's doing wrong. But even in before,
[26:09] there's question marks on his birth and
[26:11] question marks because of his death.
[26:14] In John chapter 8 verse 41, it says, "Ye
[26:16] do the deeds of your father."
[26:20] So we know what Jesus means when he says
[26:22] this. You do the deeds of your father.
[26:25] It's referring to the devil. And they
[26:26] said to him, we be not born of
[26:27] fornication.
[26:29] We have one father, even God.
[26:34] Wait, what? Repeat that to me slowly.
[26:39] Who's your daddy?
[26:42] &gt;&gt; John chapter 5, Jesus was accused of
[26:45] blaspheming because he said God was his
[26:47] fathers. Now these hypocrites so blinded
[26:50] by hate says we have one father even God
[26:54] making themselves equal to God but yet
[26:57] they're not guilty of the same crime.
[27:01] This is how hate works.
[27:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[27:04] &gt;&gt; That when people could see be blinded by
[27:06] their own ambitions and deluded by the
[27:08] devil that they could say, "Oh my
[27:10] goodness, you claim to be this. I don't
[27:12] agree with that. That's awful. That's
[27:13] blasphemy. That that is not the true
[27:15] nature of God." And then they turn right
[27:17] around in a moment where he says, "You
[27:19] be born of fornication." In defense of
[27:21] themselves, they say, "No, we're not.
[27:24] Our father is God." But yet they're not
[27:26] guilty of blasphemy.
[27:29] He says they're born of fornication. In
[27:31] doing so, there's a lot of richness to
[27:33] it to where I believe he's referring to
[27:34] the original sin.
[27:37] And then also
[27:39] making uh referring to their claims that
[27:42] they're not bastard sons. But he's
[27:44] saying, "Look, you can't claim to be
[27:45] pure because you're natural birth." He
[27:47] says, "You are you do the deeds of your
[27:48] father. It's all rooted in the flesh."
[27:51] And yet
[27:53] I think there's more even to this
[27:55] because in his life and even
[27:59] uh after his death, his testimony of who
[28:03] he was born of is plagued with
[28:04] accusations.
[28:08] I want to just look at these very
[28:09] quickly. I'm looking at these flaws.
[28:13] Wouldn't it be nice if we were able to
[28:15] uncover, I don't know, let's say 1.2 two
[28:19] gazillion historical records that proved
[28:21] who Jesus Christ was. Wouldn't that be
[28:23] nice if we could just find the microfish
[28:25] that we all read and says, "Look, every
[28:26] single newspaper at that time said these
[28:28] things happened."
[28:31] But yet, when we go to the source that
[28:32] we have in Matthew chapter 2:1, it says,
[28:34] "Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of
[28:36] Judea in the days of Herod the king,
[28:38] behold, there came wise men from the
[28:39] east to Jerusalem." Here, Herod the king
[28:42] is Herod the Great. He died in the year
[28:45] 750 in the years of Rome. the year of
[28:47] Rome, year 750, that would be about,
[28:49] according to our calendars, 4 BC. So the
[28:53] Bible tells us that in the days of
[28:54] Herod, when Christ was born,
[28:57] it would have been about using our
[28:59] calendars 4 BC. Then in Luke chapter 2,
[29:01] it says, "And this taxing was first made
[29:03] when Sirenius was governor of Syria."
[29:05] You read that and think, "Oh, well, no
[29:07] big deal." But it's saying and
[29:08] identifying that the time of Jesus's
[29:10] birth would have been at the time when
[29:11] Sirenius was governor of Syria. But this
[29:15] is very perplexing verse is Sirenius was
[29:17] not a governor of Syria until 6 BC. So
[29:20] within the Bible, so Jesus is trying to
[29:22] say, "Well, I'm 30 years old." They'll
[29:24] say, "Yeah, right." Trying to say how
[29:26] old he was or when he was born. They
[29:28] say, "Well, that you say that you're
[29:29] born in 4 BC, but yet then it's 10 years
[29:32] later that Sirenius is the governor of
[29:34] Syria."
[29:38] As a matter of fact, there is so much
[29:41] historical record. It's on this point
[29:43] alone a lot of critics who don't believe
[29:45] Jesus Christ was the Messiah except that
[29:47] he was yet still a man based upon the
[29:51] historical record that claims that he
[29:53] was the son of Mary and a Roman soldier.
[29:56] Tiberius Julius Abdes Pantera it's
[29:59] recorded in the Jewish Talmet and in
[30:00] other Jewish writings and many different
[30:02] Roman records even gravestones and other
[30:04] records refer to Jesus as being the son
[30:07] of a Roman soldier.
[30:10] These are the rumors that chased him
[30:12] during his life.
[30:15] An illegitimate son. We'd be not born of
[30:17] fornication. He said, "You're of the
[30:18] father of the devil." It's it's even
[30:20] some suggest that when they say, "We be
[30:21] not born of fornication," it was being
[30:23] used as a slur against him.
[30:26] Even in the Bible, his lineage and his
[30:28] birth endure great contradictions. These
[30:30] are the flaws.
[30:33] In Matthew chapter 1:16 it says that
[30:35] Jacob begat Joseph
[30:37] saying that Joseph is the dad
[30:42] Joseph's dad is Jacob.
[30:45] It says the husband of Mary who is born
[30:47] of whom was born Jesus. It kind of goes
[30:49] through his paternal line or his royal
[30:51] right. The direction that Matthew moves
[30:53] is very differently than the way that
[30:54] Luke does in genealogies. But it says
[30:57] that Joseph's dad is Jacob. But then
[31:00] Luke 3:23 and Jesus himself began to be
[31:03] about 30 years of age being as we
[31:05] suppose the son of Joseph which was the
[31:07] son of Heli now Joseph's status
[31:11] and it gives another lineage now many
[31:13] scholars try to resolve this Christians
[31:15] really sincere Christians try to resolve
[31:16] this and say one is the line of Joseph
[31:19] his royal and legal right but the other
[31:20] one is this prophetic priestly line
[31:22] through Mary but Luke says specifically
[31:25] that this is the line through Joseph
[31:28] he was plagued with accusations of who
[31:30] his father was.
[31:33] There was no royal line that he could
[31:35] claim uh to descend from because there
[31:38] was this question mark. Yeah. Joseph
[31:41] found her when she was pregnant.
[31:44] There was a lot of stories told about
[31:46] him. A lot of ways that they tried to
[31:48] cover it up suggesting as as we suppose
[31:51] those writing these things believed him
[31:53] to be the son of God.
[31:55] Matthew 13:es 55-57 they said is this
[31:58] not the carpenter's son is not his
[32:01] mother called Mary they said is this not
[32:03] Mary's son using a phrase that was meant
[32:05] to be criticism and his brethren James
[32:08] and Jose and Simon and Judas and his
[32:12] sisters are they not all with us
[32:15] so it is in one sense looking at it from
[32:18] the standpoint saying hey we know his
[32:20] family we know his father we know his
[32:21] mother he is born of a woman his dad is
[32:23] Joseph his mother's Mary. At this point
[32:25] in the scripture, it's uh it's seems to
[32:27] be that maybe Joseph was dead and now we
[32:29] have his brothers James and and Simon,
[32:32] Judas, his sisters are all with us. And
[32:34] the language even suggest
[32:37] his sisters are with us. They don't
[32:40] understand what's going on. Jesus says,
[32:42] they said, "Whence this man that whence
[32:45] this then hath this man all these
[32:47] things?" And they were offended in him.
[32:51] And Jesus said unto them, "A prophet is
[32:52] not without honor save his own c and
[32:54] save in his own country and in his own
[32:57] house."
[32:59] So he wasn't even honored within his own
[33:01] house. There's not even this honor from
[33:04] his brothers and his sisters. They're
[33:05] they're the ones that brought up the
[33:06] fact that the sisters, they know the
[33:08] sisters, they know the brothers. He's
[33:09] saying, "Hey, this the skepticism and
[33:11] the rejection is within my own family.
[33:13] I'm honored everywhere else except in my
[33:15] own country and in my own house." And
[33:18] they're using this phrase, the son of
[33:19] Mary, as a slur about him to to uh to
[33:24] disparage his testimony.
[33:27] And Zakius the businessman.
[33:31] Now, as I'm going through this, I'm just
[33:33] I'm just I'm just identifying the
[33:36] paradox of the flaws. There's no fault
[33:38] in Jesus Christ.
[33:41] &gt;&gt; There's no crime of which he was guilty.
[33:44] &gt;&gt; He he he didn't merit death. despite all
[33:47] these things they accused him of and
[33:48] despite all these things we can say,
[33:50] "Well, he did heal on the Sabbath day."
[33:51] What does the Bible say about that? He
[33:53] did hang out with these guys. What does
[33:54] the Bible say about that? What what what
[33:56] does what do all these things mean? How
[33:58] how can we reconcile all these different
[34:00] things? He was accused. He was rejected.
[34:03] He was despised. The Bible told us he
[34:05] would be. We have not accepted Christ
[34:07] because it's easy.
[34:10] &gt;&gt; We have not believed on him because it
[34:12] was just absolutely convincing. We have
[34:14] done so because you're of him
[34:17] &gt;&gt; and you can't help but do it.
[34:19] &gt;&gt; The sermon Zakius the businessman,
[34:22] brother Bram, when he dramatizes this,
[34:24] it's such a wonderful story how he
[34:25] dramatizes it. But he says, "See how the
[34:27] devil does?
[34:29] He just tries to put everything in your
[34:32] way."
[34:33] So he'll move everything,
[34:37] every doubt, every flaw that he can to
[34:40] keep you from seeing what's truth. He's
[34:42] just good at doing that. So on the back
[34:45] of Satan's baseball card, the fun fact
[34:48] is he's just good at moving everything
[34:51] in your way. The scouting report, he's a
[34:55] one tool athlete. He's good. He'll move
[34:58] everything, every doubt, every flaw he
[34:59] can to keep you from seeing truth.
[35:01] That's what he's good at.
[35:06] &gt;&gt; Tries to put everything in your way.
[35:08] He'll move everything, every doubt,
[35:09] every flaw that he can to keep you from
[35:10] seeing what is truth.
[35:15] &gt;&gt; Nakedness is associated with birth. And
[35:17] when it comes to the birth of Christ,
[35:20] God has allowed there to be a lot of
[35:21] question marks.
[35:23] But it's even his death that may may be
[35:25] the ultimate nakedness,
[35:28] the ultimate shame and embarrassment.
[35:34] questions are
[35:36] surround his death. I know a lot of you
[35:39] love to study the word and read the word
[35:41] and I'm not just referring to ministers.
[35:42] I know that that the the love for the
[35:43] word is rich in this congregation. Have
[35:46] any of you ever tried to study just
[35:48] exactly what day Jesus died?
[35:51] Which meal did they eat in the
[35:53] scripture? Which one was the Passover?
[35:54] What day died?
[35:56] It's exhausting.
[35:59] It's hard to figure it all out with the
[36:01] mills and the dates and the times and be
[36:03] wonderful scholars, beautiful people,
[36:05] great scholars have all come to the
[36:07] conclusion that well it could have been
[36:09] on the Nissan the 14th, it could have
[36:10] been Nissan the 15th, it could have been
[36:12] the meal before this, it could have been
[36:13] the day before that. It's really hard to
[36:16] come up concretely with an exact date,
[36:18] an exact hour. But listen to his death
[36:21] in Mark 15 21-38. And they compel one
[36:25] Simon ofSire,
[36:27] a Sirenian who passed by, coming out of
[36:29] the country, the father of Alexander and
[36:31] Rufus to bear his cross. And they bring
[36:33] him under the place Golgtha, which is
[36:35] being interpreted the place of a skull.
[36:38] Just want you to notice just how ugly
[36:40] and awful his death is. Life hasn't been
[36:43] easy. Tries to heal somebody, he's doing
[36:46] it in the name of the devil. Just wants
[36:48] to have a quiet meal and he's he's a
[36:50] drunkard and a glutton.
[36:52] tries to help people and he hangs out
[36:54] with the wrong people. Is invited to go
[36:56] to a party and all of a sudden a woman
[36:58] starts washing his feet. Now he's not a
[37:00] prophet. If he if he was, he would have
[37:01] known better than to hang out with the
[37:03] likes of them. He had a rough life. And
[37:06] they gave him a drink wine mingled with
[37:09] myrr, but he received it not. And when
[37:11] they had crucified him, they parted his
[37:12] garments, casting lots upon them, and
[37:14] every man and what every man should
[37:16] take. And it was the third hour, and
[37:20] they crucified him. So now we have 9:00
[37:22] in the morning, the third hour where he
[37:23] is being nailed to the cross. And the
[37:25] subscription of his accusation was
[37:26] written over the king of the Jews. This
[37:29] subscription I think is different in
[37:31] three other places in the the account.
[37:34] And with him they crucified two thieves.
[37:36] The one in his right hand and the other
[37:38] on his left. We know that there's one
[37:40] thief who says remember me this day in
[37:42] paradise. Another one says both thieves
[37:44] railed on him. And the scripture was
[37:46] fulfilled which saith, and he was
[37:47] numbered with the transgressors, and
[37:49] they that passed by railed on him,
[37:52] wagging their heads, and saying, "Ah,
[37:54] thou that destroyest the temple and
[37:56] buildest it in three days." They're
[37:58] mocking him with what he said. Here's
[38:01] the guy who said he could destroy the
[38:04] temple and build it in three days.
[38:06] fascinating that they're accusing him
[38:09] and bringing this up as if it's it's a
[38:11] gotcha moment, but they're just
[38:13] reminding everyone that he said,
[38:14] "Destroy this temple and here they are
[38:16] in the act of destroying it." And what's
[38:18] going to happen three days later? That
[38:19] body's coming up.
[38:22] &gt;&gt; But yet, what was actually prophecy,
[38:24] what was actually something that
[38:26] vindicated him, they used to destroy
[38:28] him,
[38:29] &gt;&gt; to ridicule him, to find fault against
[38:32] him. save thyself and come down from the
[38:34] cross.
[38:36] The fact that he could have and didn't
[38:38] is one of the greatest compliments to
[38:39] his character. Likewise also the chief
[38:42] priests mocking said among themselves
[38:43] with the scribes, he saved others.
[38:46] Himself he cannot save. Notice notice
[38:50] how easy it is in that moment of
[38:52] weakness.
[38:54] They had many t opportunities they say
[38:56] to to grasp him. They didn't want to do
[38:57] it because of the people. And they had
[38:58] this opportunity. They were afraid of
[38:59] what the people would say. But now, now
[39:01] that he's hanging up there on the cross,
[39:03] now that their mission has been
[39:04] fulfilled, now that their collusion with
[39:06] Judas has produced this, now they could
[39:08] say, "Yeah, tough guy. Tough guy when he
[39:11] was alive. Tough guy, but now that he
[39:13] hangs upon the cross, can't do nothing
[39:14] for himself.
[39:16] Let Christ, the king of Israel, descend
[39:18] now from the cross that we may see and
[39:20] believe." This is the attitude.
[39:23] This is the conclusion. When all the
[39:25] flaws were brought to their attention,
[39:26] now do something now. and they that were
[39:29] crucified with him reviled him. So now
[39:31] this scripture says that these thieves
[39:33] those those hanging to his left and
[39:34] right reviled him. And when the sixth
[39:38] hour was come three hours later
[39:39] according to Mark now at noon there was
[39:42] darkness over the whole land until the
[39:44] 9inth hour. So at the sixth hour he's
[39:46] hanging on the cross. I believe it's in
[39:49] the book of John or maybe it's in Luke
[39:50] where it says at the sixth hour he was
[39:52] standing before Pilate. But here in
[39:54] verse 34 it says at the ninth hour Jesus
[39:56] cried with a loud voice saying Eloy lama
[40:00] sakati which is being interpreted my God
[40:03] my God why hast thou forsaken me the
[40:06] Bible says he gave up the ghost
[40:09] crucified to the cross at 9:00 in the
[40:11] morning fits that time period in which
[40:12] you would believe that a man being
[40:14] crucified would die
[40:17] becomes dark at noon he finally dies
[40:22] at 3:00
[40:25] in this ninth hour
[40:28] and all the earth is dark. He's died.
[40:32] Can't defend himself anymore. They've
[40:35] done to him what they wanted to do.
[40:38] Now that he's dead, that temple, he's
[40:40] not going to be able to tear down that
[40:41] temple and build it up again. Now that
[40:43] he's dead, how can he claim to be the
[40:45] son of God? Now that he's dead, he he's
[40:48] completely naked. Remember on on Sunday,
[40:50] it's in your death. is in that dying
[40:52] that you're stripped of every defense.
[40:55] He has no royal crown that he can point
[40:57] to. He has no throne that he can point
[40:59] to. He can't fight for himself. He can't
[41:01] vindicate himself. He's dead.
[41:05] This is a great mark. This is a great
[41:07] flaw on Jesus Christ.
[41:10] We believe the Bible.
[41:13] Can I get a witness?
[41:15] &gt;&gt; We believe the Bible so we know that he
[41:16] rose again. There's a lot of other books
[41:19] out there that some claim should be a
[41:21] part of the gospels that prove that he
[41:23] did not rise but that his disciples
[41:25] stole the body to create a religion.
[41:30] But we by faith believe this.
[41:33] &gt;&gt; We we believe this combination of books.
[41:37] &gt;&gt; We believe this combination of gospels.
[41:39] And you know what? It doesn't even
[41:41] bother us.
[41:43] How is it you can read this book and
[41:46] believe it so hardily?
[41:49] &gt;&gt; So ask yourself the question, why is it
[41:51] you could read this or any other
[41:53] translation of it, whether it be the
[41:55] amplified or the message or the NIV, and
[41:57] you may read it and say, well, this is a
[41:58] little bit different, but yet no matter
[41:59] what it is, those 66 books to you are
[42:01] sacred.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; Why?
[42:04] &gt;&gt; I think it's a good question.
[42:07] &gt;&gt; Why Why don't we treat the encyclopedias
[42:09] the same way?
[42:11] 66 volumes of encyclopedia books. Why
[42:13] why don't we treat that as a sacred
[42:15] text?
[42:19] &gt;&gt; We believe that he rose again.
[42:23] &gt;&gt; So no matter how bad it looked in that
[42:24] moment, we see where it ended.
[42:27] &gt;&gt; In Psalms 34 12 to20, we featured these
[42:29] verses quite a bit lately. What man is
[42:31] he that desireth life and loveth many
[42:34] days
[42:38] that he may see good? These scriptures
[42:41] speak to Isaiah 53. Because though he
[42:43] saw brokenness and suffering, God did
[42:45] prolong his days. And because of these
[42:48] things, he received goodness and in a
[42:50] place with the rich. Keep thy tongue
[42:51] from evil and thy lips from speaking
[42:52] guile. Depart from evil and do good.
[42:55] Seek peace and pursue it.
[42:58] We've looked at this on resolving evil
[43:00] and good and evil. The eyes of the Lord
[43:02] are upon the righteous and his ears are
[43:04] open unto their cry.
[43:06] The face of the Lord is against them
[43:08] that do evil to cut off the remembrance
[43:09] of them from the earth.
[43:12] The righteous cry and the Lord heareth
[43:15] and deliverth them out of all their
[43:18] troubles. That means the righteous are
[43:21] in trouble.
[43:24] &gt;&gt; Doesn't say he keeps them from trouble.
[43:26] They're in trouble and in their trouble
[43:28] they cry and they are delivered.
[43:31] &gt;&gt; The wicked are cut off in the
[43:32] remembrance from them from the earth.
[43:34] But the righteous are in trouble. The
[43:36] righteous get themselves in
[43:38] predicaments. The righteous have as
[43:40] Jesus Christ is the just one and the
[43:42] righteous one. God did not watch out
[43:44] over his life to where the way that he
[43:45] lived from his birth to his death,
[43:48] everything was just so neat and buttoned
[43:49] up to where everyone had to say that's
[43:52] my boy. That's our Messiah. He just has
[43:55] to go through this. Just let it run its
[43:57] course. It was controversial.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; The controversy of Christ is great.
[44:03] But it says, "The Lord is nigh unto them
[44:05] that are of a broken heart, and saveth
[44:07] such as be of a contrite spirit.
[44:11] Many are the afflictions of the
[44:12] righteous." Can someone please show me
[44:16] that in the Hebrew that means 172?
[44:19] That that's it. Once I've reached the
[44:21] once I've met the quota,
[44:24] no more afflictions, Brother Eleazer,
[44:26] you're good. Kind of like those that
[44:28] believe there's only 144,000 that are
[44:30] going to be saved and like once that's
[44:31] it, you're all out. Well, too bad we
[44:33] can't figure out how. Oh, there's only
[44:34] so many hours of grief you can endure.
[44:36] And we have a clock. We go we wake up in
[44:39] the morning, how many more hours of
[44:40] grief? Oh, I got it down to a hundred.
[44:43] It's not that way. Many are the
[44:46] afflictions of the righteous, but the
[44:47] Lord delivers him out of them all. They
[44:50] are afflicted. They are in trouble. They
[44:52] cry in their distresses. They are
[44:54] despised. They are cast down. But the
[44:56] Lord delivers them out of all. He
[44:58] keepeth all his bones. Now this prophecy
[45:00] of the crucifixion, he keepeth all his
[45:02] bones and none of them is broken.
[45:05] The life of Jesus Christ was full of
[45:07] wounds and scars, brokenness and
[45:09] rejection.
[45:11] And our lives are the same,
[45:14] &gt;&gt; right?
[45:15] &gt;&gt; It's the same disappointments.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; How many times have we felt like we
[45:18] achieved we we broke the sound barrier,
[45:21] right? We broke through. I'm now gonna
[45:24] just coast. I I've made it past the hard
[45:26] part in life.
[45:30] Have anybody ever said that before?
[45:31] Right? You thought if you could just
[45:32] make it to eighth grade, like life's
[45:35] going to get easy. All right, man. If I
[45:37] could just get the promotion, I could
[45:38] just get this all all sorts of junctures
[45:40] in life. We thought, man, if I could
[45:42] just I'm going to get through this. Let
[45:44] me just testify.
[45:47] I have found quite often I have a corner
[45:50] that I'm wanting to turn. And I feel
[45:52] like once I turn that corner, I'm just
[45:55] going to be like, "Here's the home
[45:56] stretch. It's all laid out before me.
[45:58] All free weekends. Got my schedule laid
[46:00] out. It's going to be good." Then I find
[46:02] out I feel like I'm on a NASCAR track.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; Just one giant turn.
[46:08] There's always something coming up.
[46:11] &gt;&gt; Rarely do we ever say, "I'm done." And
[46:13] have enough time to breathe without
[46:15] there something like, "Oh, got this
[46:16] coming up. You got that coming up."
[46:18] &gt;&gt; Because many are the afflictions of the
[46:19] righteous. difficulties, hard times. I
[46:23] know we preach a gospel of joy and peace
[46:25] and the fruits of the spirit are all
[46:26] make you feel really good when you think
[46:28] about it, but those things come at a
[46:30] great cost.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; The chastisement of your peace was upon
[46:35] him. It didn't mean that that would you
[46:37] weren't going to be chastised. It just
[46:40] means that through your chastisement,
[46:42] you could succeed to have peace.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:47] The wrath of God was upon him and he
[46:49] paid the price for your sins. But that
[46:50] doesn't mean we don't endure sadness and
[46:53] harshness and difficulty in this life.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; This is the paradox of being a perfect
[46:57] son or daughter of God. There's still
[47:00] brokenness and nakedness and suffering.
[47:02] But yet somehow in all this, he keeps
[47:04] all his bones.
[47:06] something. Though the outside was
[47:09] scarred and marred and bleeding and
[47:11] bruised and bloody and aged and despised
[47:14] and not beautiful and unccoming, there
[47:16] still was something that all that was
[47:19] held up by that God said, "I'll preserve
[47:21] the structure.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; I won't let a bone of his be broken."
[47:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; In other words, though the outward
[47:30] suffered, God preserved a wholeness.
[47:32] Amen.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; This is the paradox of flaws.
[47:40] God, it says God
[47:43] is close to those who have a broken
[47:46] heart
[47:47] and saves those
[47:50] who have a contrite spirit.
[47:53] If you want to find where God is, if you
[47:55] want to find him, get broken.
[47:58] He'll come to you in your depression, in
[48:01] your fear, in your anxiety, in your
[48:02] darkest moment when everything's falling
[48:04] apart. He's close.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; But will you turn to him?
[48:10] &gt;&gt; Will you accept him? Is that the moment
[48:12] you really want him?
[48:14] &gt;&gt; Because he says he's n to them that are
[48:15] of a broken heart.
[48:18] Or are we quick to start dressing
[48:20] ourselves in our loin cloths,
[48:24] in our rationalizations,
[48:26] in our own fears? is the Lord is nigh
[48:28] unto them. The paradox of flaws is that
[48:31] God feels the brokenness
[48:34] because he's nigh and he saves you
[48:36] because of it. The troubles, the
[48:38] difficulties, he covers your nakedness
[48:40] with himself.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; I know many of you are familiar with
[48:45] Michelangelo.
[48:50] And
[48:52] I always spell his name wrong.
[48:53] Instinctively, I want to spell it like
[48:54] Michael, you know, but it's uh it's
[48:58] looks like Michelle, M I C H E L. I'm
[49:00] just trying to teach a few things here.
[49:01] And then Angelo.
[49:04] Michelangelo is a very interesting
[49:06] artist. He's a very passionate person as
[49:08] the the histories will tell. And I found
[49:11] um as of late just studying these things
[49:13] that many of his works remained unfinish
[49:16] in life.
[49:18] And he was characterized as often. And
[49:20] he was characterized as someone who
[49:21] wanted to work with things that were
[49:22] unfinished and imperfect.
[49:25] Actually, a recent exhibition of his
[49:27] work with some of the genuine sketchings
[49:30] and maybe some small pieces, but then
[49:32] replicas of a lot of his famous marble
[49:33] works and sculptures was presented at a
[49:35] museum, I believe, in Copenhagen. And
[49:37] the name of the exhibition was
[49:39] Michelangelo imperfect.
[49:42] Something that just identified him in
[49:43] some ways as being imperfect. and the
[49:46] Doom of Pieta
[49:48] in this this uh picture here. This is a
[49:51] a sculpture he did later in life and he
[49:53] was trying to replicate something he had
[49:54] done when he was young. I know it's
[49:57] difficult to see, but even looking at
[49:58] it, you might realize it. The arm of
[50:00] Christ looks a little bit odd. But
[50:02] there's a lot of irregularities of this
[50:04] sculpture, disproportionate limbs.
[50:07] And and looking at it, you would say,
[50:09] well, this doesn't seem to be maybe a
[50:10] piece by a great artist.
[50:13] And even many critics have looked at
[50:14] this and said, compared to what
[50:15] Michelangelo was able to do, it's really
[50:18] melodramatic.
[50:20] It there's uh it's kind of listless.
[50:21] There's no energy to the piece.
[50:25] And there's a lot of troubling
[50:27] imperfections that exist in this great
[50:29] sculpture.
[50:31] And it it is not just believed, but the
[50:34] evidence is there even on the sculpture
[50:35] itself that Michelangelo hammered this
[50:37] statue statue. Took a hammer and began
[50:40] to beat it and strike it in many
[50:42] different places, obscuring perhaps the
[50:44] parts that he found dissatisfactory.
[50:47] Creates this piece. They found some
[50:49] letters where he wrote about it, what he
[50:50] was trying to do, and whatever, for
[50:52] whatever reason, he took a hammer, began
[50:54] to beat it, and he began to strike it
[50:55] many different places. And if you look
[50:57] closely, you could see chips and marks
[50:59] and cracks.
[51:01] After he died, another sculptor tried to
[51:03] fix it by chiseling the edges and
[51:05] smoothing out and polishing the surface.
[51:08] But one one writer at the time said,
[51:10] "It's good that that person died."
[51:14] Because what they tried to do is they
[51:15] were trying to polish up something that
[51:18] the artist himself had made broken.
[51:22] Trying to go back and fix the edges and
[51:24] the rough spots and the cracks and the
[51:26] fissures and the irregularities. He was
[51:28] trying to take something that was in the
[51:29] heart of the artist that reflected even
[51:31] the wrath and the anger and the passion
[51:33] of the artist and he was trying to clear
[51:34] it up
[51:37] such that the retouching, the polishing,
[51:39] though it was an attempt to fix the
[51:41] flaw, actually made it worse.
[51:44] You following me?
[51:45] &gt;&gt; Kind of drifted into art class, but
[51:48] we're talking about the masterpiece
[51:51] paradox.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; Then we have this sculpture of Moses.
[51:56] I've included this this picture here as
[51:58] it isolates him. I read this summation
[52:02] of the beast. Now, kind of just imagine
[52:04] what Michelangelo is bringing forth.
[52:06] Moses turns his head, eyes blazing.
[52:10] Very different from this last one we
[52:11] just looked at. There's there's emotion
[52:13] in this guy's eye. In Moses's eye, his
[52:15] body seems to follow his left leg tense
[52:18] as if he's about to rise. Do you kind of
[52:20] see that? To where the one the one going
[52:23] back, the other one ready. He he he
[52:25] looks ready to rise to the occasion.
[52:26] He's holding this the the tablets of
[52:29] stone, the locks of his beard flow
[52:31] through his fingers. You see that? As
[52:33] he's as he's holding that, we may be
[52:36] seeing him as he as described in the
[52:38] Bible upon his second ascent to Mount
[52:40] Si. He's just destroyed the first set of
[52:42] tablets inscribed with the Ten
[52:44] Commandments. In anger at his people,
[52:46] God now appears to him, showing only his
[52:48] back. Under his arms are uninscribed
[52:52] tablets upon which God's covenant will
[52:53] be reaffirmed. The Hebrew word for
[52:55] radiance around Moses's head can be
[52:58] interpreted as horns, which led to him
[53:01] frequently being depicted with horns on
[53:03] his forehead. Wow. There's a lot in
[53:05] this.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; There's a lot to see in this image. We
[53:09] say, "Oh, well that's that's Moses." But
[53:11] from the this leg being backwards, this
[53:13] one being forwards, his his fingers
[53:15] curling through his beards, his muscles
[53:17] are tight and tense, the look upon his
[53:19] face, the horns upon his head, it's
[53:21] showing this moment
[53:23] has so much energy, so much passion, and
[53:27] there's staggering details in this.
[53:30] Notice here. Can you see a slightly
[53:33] raised pinky
[53:35] in this with this pinky being slightly
[53:38] raised? You say, "Oh, well, maybe he had
[53:40] difficulty." My daughter is an excellent
[53:42] artist and uh we've been trying to learn
[53:44] how to draw lips. And so, there's some
[53:46] things that you draw that can be very
[53:47] difficult. I'm drawing hands. Hey, if I
[53:50] have an artistic style, my hands look
[53:52] one way, pterodactyl or something,
[53:54] right? I'm just going to, you know, it's
[53:55] a hand. You know what I'm going for
[53:57] here. You don't have to get all
[53:58] technical about how many fingers
[53:59] somebody has. Just do the mitten look,
[54:01] right? But here, Moses is being sculpted
[54:04] to where there's so much energy. There's
[54:06] so much life. And he has his pinky. Look
[54:09] at how hard he made this.
[54:12] But you talk about 3D printing.
[54:14] I'm fascinated with 3D printers. We can
[54:16] make lizards that glow and moving tails.
[54:19] And all the kids took all the glowing
[54:21] ones. I got like one whose spots glow at
[54:23] least.
[54:25] But this is amazing. And this man used
[54:27] stone and a hammer and chisel and could
[54:30] make a hand with the finger curled over
[54:33] the other. And it looks like it all has
[54:35] so much depth as if you could take the
[54:36] hand and move it. And that's not just
[54:38] the staggering detail of the pinky. He
[54:41] has the correct muscle flexed.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; When that muscle is raised, there's a a
[54:46] particular uh when that finger is
[54:48] raised, there's a particular muscle that
[54:49] flexes. And and I wrote it down because
[54:52] I knew I wouldn't be able to re remember
[54:54] it. But it by doing this, it
[54:55] demonstrates the extensor digit minim.
[54:58] But the Scott, I might just have you
[54:59] give the the Latin for all this in the
[55:01] future for anything uh that relates to
[55:03] the human body. But the muscle, notice
[55:06] the detail.
[55:08] If that was just smooth as glass, none
[55:10] of us would probably say, you know, I
[55:12] found a problem. See that pinky little
[55:16] bit distended? Where's the muscle?
[55:18] Where's the definition? We know Moses
[55:19] did that. He worked out. He did the
[55:21] putty.
[55:22] Never skipped pinky day.
[55:25] But in all the staggering details, what
[55:28] made it a masterpiece?
[55:30] What made it a masterpiece? This is the
[55:33] paradox of the masterpiece. The paradox
[55:35] of the masterpiece is the flaw that made
[55:38] it a masterpiece.
[55:40] If you look at this picture here, I've
[55:42] circled these parts so that you can see
[55:44] them.
[55:46] The knee, and I've read a lot of
[55:48] historians on this. I don't know why
[55:50] some conclude this and art skeptics say,
[55:52] "Oh, what we merely see here is a vein
[55:54] that was in the marble extending out."
[55:56] But if you look close, there's clearly
[55:58] some imprint right upon the knee at the
[56:01] moment that this vein begins.
[56:04] And this is the story that's often told
[56:06] that Moses and some that excuse me, I
[56:08] call him Moses, Michelangelo was so
[56:11] invested in this sculpture that he
[56:13] talked to it as if it was human.
[56:16] He was so caught up in the vision, so
[56:19] much consumed by what he saw on the
[56:20] block that he could even be so
[56:22] particular with the muscle movements. He
[56:24] could have the hair of his locks of his
[56:26] beard and curled in his hands. He could
[56:27] have this motion as if it were rising.
[56:29] He could have these eyes blazing with
[56:30] fire. He have this sense that maybe he
[56:32] had just seen the backside of God. And
[56:34] now he when he looks at he sees it. They
[56:35] say he took the hammer and he struck the
[56:37] knee.
[56:39] And it's not just the knee that struck,
[56:41] but if you follow the path of this, the
[56:44] toe is chipped.
[56:46] That would almost look like the path
[56:48] that the hammer may have followed when
[56:50] he struck the knee and followed through
[56:51] and chipped the toe.
[56:54] And some may look at that and say, "Ah,
[56:56] he messed it up."
[56:58] But that's what made it a masterpiece.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; It's not the pinky being raised.
[57:08] It's not the horns upon his head,
[57:11] it's the flaw.
[57:14] And the masterpiece, Brother Brham said,
[57:15] and when it was completed, he so was so
[57:17] inspired by to he thought his own
[57:18] masterpiece should speak back to him.
[57:20] And he struck it across the leg and
[57:21] hollered, "Speak."
[57:23] And it made a flaw on it. It put a flaw
[57:26] in the image.
[57:28] To me, the flaw was what made it the
[57:30] masterpiece.
[57:32] Maybe to the mind that might think
[57:34] different, you might think that spoiled
[57:36] it. No. To me, it made it what it was.
[57:42] This is what those guys, those
[57:43] Pharisees, and those scribes, and the
[57:44] people in the days of Jesus, this is
[57:46] where they had it all wrong. They
[57:47] thought the son of God would be so
[57:49] perfect, you couldn't lay anything to
[57:51] his charge,
[57:52] anything.
[57:54] That he would somehow just be so
[57:56] sensitive to all their sensibilities and
[57:58] their sensitivities and their rules and
[57:59] their regulations and who he could hang
[58:01] out with and who he could eat with. And
[58:02] that he would just plate everyone. He'd
[58:04] be a man of peace. And here he is
[58:05] causing so much subversion, so many
[58:07] controversies, so many problems. And it
[58:10] was all those things that turned people
[58:12] off. But it's those things that made
[58:14] Christ a relatable
[58:17] Messiah.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; But Elizer, I believe it was you,
[58:20] ministered on it earlier this year when
[58:21] he talked about, he asked the question,
[58:23] why did God let the scars remain?
[58:26] Why?
[58:28] Why didn't God just cover the scars up?
[58:31] Would have it not been just a
[58:33] supernatural Jesus appeared as they
[58:35] would have recognized him before as the
[58:36] disciples sat down to meet him like
[58:38] Jesus it's you what happened to the
[58:40] scars
[58:42] would have been just a testament but yet
[58:43] he retained the scars
[58:46] why would he let the perfect son of God
[58:47] in a glorified body that could not die
[58:50] still bear in it scars in marks of human
[58:54] woundings and hatred
[58:57] scars that indicate weakness
[59:00] wounds in his eye that indicated his
[59:02] very death. Why did God allow it to
[59:04] remain? Because it's in that that he's
[59:06] the Messiah.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; It's in that that he's the mighty
[59:09] conqueror. It's in that that we could
[59:11] see our sins and our peace.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; God is so interested in your peace and
[59:16] your salvation and your healing that
[59:18] even in the physical manifestation of
[59:20] his son, he did not remove the scars. He
[59:22] did not remove the holes. He did not
[59:24] remove the bleeding side. He wanted it
[59:26] always be visible that these flaws were
[59:28] for your protection. Amen.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; You see, so often what happens is when a
[59:34] somebody is afflicted with cancer and a
[59:36] lot of times it happens with even young
[59:38] people or spouses and they go through
[59:39] chemotherapy treatment and they get
[59:41] their hair, they lose their hair and
[59:42] they're completely bald and somebody
[59:44] else identifies themsel with that person
[59:46] and they shave their head. People who've
[59:48] grown their hair out for years, men or
[59:50] women, they shave it and do what? To
[59:51] show you're you're I I I'm with you in
[59:54] this. I support you. You're not going to
[59:57] go at this alone. And not only did he
[1:00:00] bear our sins, but he also bears in his
[1:00:02] bodies the marks of the fact that he
[1:00:04] died for your sickness. He died for your
[1:00:06] sins. And he'll want to appear before
[1:00:08] you naked and wounded and bruised every
[1:00:11] moment of every day. So that you
[1:00:13] recognize in him is your peace. Amen.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; And the very moment when it was
[1:00:17] announced that the mighty lamb, the lion
[1:00:19] has prevailed to take the book and loose
[1:00:21] the seals thereof, he didn't change his
[1:00:23] visions, he still wanted you to know he
[1:00:25] was a weak, wounded, bloody, beaten,
[1:00:28] naked lamb of God.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; He still bore the reproach. He still
[1:00:32] bore the scars. He still featured the
[1:00:35] flaws in the moment that you would think
[1:00:37] be as great as conquest. He said, 'I
[1:00:39] don't want anyone ever to forget that
[1:00:40] there's a lot of things, a lot of
[1:00:42] darkness and uh uh wounding and
[1:00:45] suffering.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; God values the flaw and uses it for your
[1:00:54] gain.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; But it's the devil that exploits the
[1:00:57] flaws to your loss.
[1:01:02] There's a writer, I can't remember just
[1:01:04] exactly now how the lyrics go, but
[1:01:05] speaking about the devil, and he says he
[1:01:08] gives he gives you hope and then takes
[1:01:09] it away. It's exactly what the devil
[1:01:11] does. Hey, guess what? Guess what? It's
[1:01:14] going to happen. It's going to be
[1:01:15] awesome. You're like, oh, yay,
[1:01:17] wonderful. And he's like, no, it's not.
[1:01:21] That's what he does. That's what the
[1:01:22] devil does. Psalm 51 16 and 17 says,
[1:01:26] "For thou desireest not sacrifice, else
[1:01:28] would I give it. Thou delightest not in
[1:01:31] burnt offering.
[1:01:32] Think of this moment in Psalm 51. What
[1:01:34] can I offer him? What can I give?
[1:01:37] What is it God wants to see? Does he
[1:01:39] want you to present a beautiful altar?
[1:01:41] Does he want you to present a lot of
[1:01:42] noise, a lot of language, a lot all
[1:01:44] these different things? Says the
[1:01:45] sacrifices of God, the sacrifices that
[1:01:47] God loves, that he looks for and wants
[1:01:49] are a broken spirit
[1:01:52] and a broken and contrite heart. God, oh
[1:01:55] God, thou will not despise. Contrite
[1:01:59] means broken or crushed.
[1:02:02] It's wounded, broken, split into pieces,
[1:02:04] scarred, naked.
[1:02:07] What can we offer him? A perfect
[1:02:09] sacrifice. Let's find a lamb without
[1:02:10] blemish.
[1:02:12] Let's find a a a red heer. Perfect. No,
[1:02:15] what he wants actually
[1:02:18] is a sacrifice of a broken spirit,
[1:02:24] crushed
[1:02:25] heart, broken into pieces.
[1:02:30] That may make some people uncomfortable.
[1:02:33] How could a loving God, why would he
[1:02:36] want that?
[1:02:38] God could watch over your life from
[1:02:41] birth till death and never allow you to
[1:02:44] feel pain, suffer, or ever experience
[1:02:46] any deficit. And you would die without
[1:02:49] having never known God.
[1:02:53] You just would have thought, "I'm
[1:02:54] charmed."
[1:02:57] It would have been it would have you
[1:02:58] would have never known him for a moment.
[1:03:01] But where do you find God? In those dark
[1:03:04] places.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; In the emptiness, in the void. Remember
[1:03:08] the evil in this world declares his
[1:03:10] presence.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; Not because he's in it. It's just the
[1:03:13] way that God works. You want to know why
[1:03:15] we believe in the the present Jesus
[1:03:18] Christ in this hour?
[1:03:20] Because we see the manifestation of evil
[1:03:23] at its greatest that it's ever been.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; Why? It's to show the light.
[1:03:30] Jesus, excuse me, in the sermon Jehovah
[1:03:33] Gyra part one, something come up in the
[1:03:35] church and the devil can get amongst a
[1:03:37] group of fine people and get in there
[1:03:38] and go to whipping that congregation
[1:03:40] around. The first thing you know, say,
[1:03:42] "Huh, I'm going to leave this old thing.
[1:03:44] There wasn't nothing to it in the first
[1:03:46] place." The devil's doing the whipping.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; Devil's whipping things around. This is
[1:03:50] just like the devil to go up to
[1:03:53] somebody, punch them in the lip, and
[1:03:55] their lips bleed and say, "Can you
[1:03:56] believe they have a bloody lip? God must
[1:03:59] not be in this thing."
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; He starts a fire, right? He's the
[1:04:04] arsonist because he wants to be the one
[1:04:06] to point it out.
[1:04:08] I'm leaving this whole thing. He goes,
[1:04:10] "The first little flaw the devil can
[1:04:12] show you, then you you're through with
[1:04:14] it." Because what is he good at? Flaws.
[1:04:18] He's got a compendium of them.
[1:04:20] The devil is only good at identifying
[1:04:23] flaws. If you ever want to know if it's
[1:04:25] the devil, he'll show you something's
[1:04:27] wrong without the ability to show you
[1:04:30] what is right.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; That's his secret. Because even when
[1:04:35] he's right about something, God does
[1:04:37] know the day you eat thereof your eyes
[1:04:38] will be open. He was right. But he
[1:04:40] doesn't understand fully and is not
[1:04:42] willing to fully share the consequences
[1:04:43] of it. Because at the end of the day,
[1:04:45] he's incapable of truth. Amen.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; So he can show you flaws all day long,
[1:04:51] but what he cannot do
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; is show you the God that's in it.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; So I want you to recognize this. When
[1:04:58] you see the flaw, don't panic. When you
[1:05:01] see the the the absence, the void, the
[1:05:03] pain, the suffering, when you see the
[1:05:05] brokenness, you see the crushed, you see
[1:05:08] the wounding, the bleeding, the
[1:05:09] rejection, don't panic. Keep looking
[1:05:11] closely.
[1:05:13] The wicked one is snared in the works of
[1:05:14] his own hands the pit that he dug for
[1:05:16] you. He'll fall into the midst himself
[1:05:18] because you'll look into the void.
[1:05:19] You'll look into the air. You'll look
[1:05:21] into the darkness. You'll look into the
[1:05:22] flaw. And in the flaw, God will reveal
[1:05:24] himself.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; You don't have to turn away from it.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; You don't have to run and hide. If you
[1:05:31] want to see him, you'll see him in the
[1:05:32] very thing
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; that causes people to turn away.
[1:05:36] Amen.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; There's a a a a
[1:05:44] principle of
[1:05:48] there's an ancient art called ksugi.
[1:05:52] It's a Japanese art of repairing broken
[1:05:54] pottery. It's rooted in an ancient
[1:05:56] philosophy of seeing beauty and flawed
[1:05:58] things or the imperfect.
[1:06:01] And unlike other techniques that try to
[1:06:03] hide damage, this kugi glorifi glory, I
[1:06:06] want to say it this glories in
[1:06:08] imperfections.
[1:06:10] Paul said, "Will you will you take this
[1:06:12] thorn away from me?" And Jesus Jesus
[1:06:14] said, "My grace is sufficient."
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; And so what he did is he said instead of
[1:06:18] removing the thorn, he wanted to
[1:06:21] accentuate it.
[1:06:23] He he wanted to glory in it because that
[1:06:26] wasn't proof he was rejected.
[1:06:31] And so if something broke, a piece of
[1:06:33] pottery broke,
[1:06:35] instead of rejoining the pieces
[1:06:36] meticulously with glue or some sort of
[1:06:38] camouflage adhesive, kinugi is in the
[1:06:42] Japanese, that word is two words, k
[1:06:44] andsugi,
[1:06:45] gold
[1:06:47] repair.
[1:06:49] Golden repair. Golden joinery.
[1:06:52] And what it does is it fills the missing
[1:06:54] pieces
[1:06:58] and rejoins the broken with gold.
[1:07:02] I want you to think about this. If you
[1:07:05] were a perfect piece of pottery,
[1:07:09] never any marks, never any fissures,
[1:07:12] nothing ever broken, you might be able
[1:07:15] to brag that you were a perfect piece of
[1:07:17] pottery, perfect flesh.
[1:07:20] But this pottery, when it's broken,
[1:07:24] they don't try to glue it back together
[1:07:25] in such a way to where you never noticed
[1:07:27] it was broken. Isn't that what we do
[1:07:29] when we break something? We want it to
[1:07:30] look so perfect that you can never know
[1:07:32] it was broken. Oh, I'm so glad for
[1:07:33] Gorilla Glue, right? You can't tell it
[1:07:36] was ever broken. That's what you want in
[1:07:38] an auto body repair shop, right? I don't
[1:07:40] want to know it was ever in a helltorm.
[1:07:41] I don't ever want to know that it was I
[1:07:42] want the paint to match. I want
[1:07:43] everything to be perfect. But yet,
[1:07:45] here's an art that glories in the
[1:07:47] imperfections. And you can see where the
[1:07:49] cracks are, but where it doesn't
[1:07:51] perfectly line up. Where there was
[1:07:53] something missing and where it was
[1:07:54] broken, it once separated. Gold is used
[1:07:57] to bring it back together to make it
[1:07:59] whole. And it's just as useful as it was
[1:08:03] before.
[1:08:05] Oh, hallelujah. Think about what the the
[1:08:07] image of what this represents in our
[1:08:09] lives. We don't ever want to be broken.
[1:08:11] If we see something broken, we recoil.
[1:08:13] It's wasted. It's garbage. Just get rid
[1:08:14] of it. Put it on the dung hill. It we
[1:08:16] don't need anymore. But God picks up the
[1:08:18] broken pieces
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; and he says, "I'm not just going to glue
[1:08:22] it together so you look perfect, but
[1:08:24] I'll be the gold that takes the broken
[1:08:27] pieces and mends the piece."
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; And if it was never broken, the deity
[1:08:33] could have never joined it back
[1:08:34] together.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; But it's called golden repair. What is
[1:08:38] that gold? Gold binds the broken pieces.
[1:08:41] What is that gold? It's the Christlike
[1:08:43] character.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; That brings you back together to
[1:08:46] yourself.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; When it all seems to been stripped away.
[1:08:50] When everything that you ever believed
[1:08:51] is taken from you. When you face your
[1:08:53] darkness and your willingness say, "God,
[1:08:55] I'm shattered into a million broken
[1:08:57] pieces." God can be the gold that just
[1:08:59] binds it all back together.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; God is the golden joinery,
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; turning our brokenness into beauty.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; And the flaw becomes points of contact.
[1:09:11] The brokenness, see all the goldeness,
[1:09:15] the crack, the broken pieces become the
[1:09:18] place where God says, "Here I am.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Here I am.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; Let me come in there. Let me bring it
[1:09:26] back together again."
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; God can do that in this church.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; God can do it in your marriages. He can
[1:09:32] do it in your family. He could do it in
[1:09:33] your in your body, your spirit. What is
[1:09:35] the Christlike character? It doesn't go
[1:09:36] through your life and say, "Oh, sister,
[1:09:37] you never ever made a mistake. You never
[1:09:39] told that lie. You never did this. You
[1:09:41] never did that. It takes the broken
[1:09:42] pieces, our conscience that's condemned.
[1:09:44] And he says, "Why don't I just give you
[1:09:45] character?" How you going to get the
[1:09:47] character? Not by saying you never did
[1:09:48] all those things, but by Christ like
[1:09:51] Christ the gold coming in and say, "Let
[1:09:52] me bring it back together. I'm going to
[1:09:54] make it stronger." This is a piece that
[1:09:55] lied one time, but now look at it.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; This is a piece that fell one time, but
[1:10:00] now look at it.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; This is a piece that did something
[1:10:03] Brother said never to do before, but now
[1:10:05] look at it.
[1:10:07] God can step into the broken piece
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; and go deity be in their Christlike
[1:10:13] character.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; Revelations 3:18, I counsel thee to buy
[1:10:16] of me gold tried in the fire. Why?
[1:10:19] Because you're broken.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; Why do you need gold? Cuz it's that
[1:10:22] which will fuse the broken pieces
[1:10:24] together. We're rich. We're increased
[1:10:25] with good. We have need of nothing, but
[1:10:26] you're wretched, miserable, poor, blind,
[1:10:28] naked, you're lacking. You're broken
[1:10:30] pieces. Why do you need gold tried in
[1:10:32] the fire? You need that gold. that
[1:10:34] purified pure gold to come and bring the
[1:10:37] pieces back together.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; Buy of me gold tried in the fire. The
[1:10:43] sermon, who is Jesus?
[1:10:46] Brother Brandham says, but there's
[1:10:47] something about it. Please listen to me
[1:10:51] with all that is in you. Say say in your
[1:10:54] heart even right now. Okay, I may not be
[1:10:56] going through it right now. I don't feel
[1:10:57] any brokenness whatsoever. That's great.
[1:10:59] That's fine. Listen right now and save
[1:11:01] this up for the day you're going to need
[1:11:02] it. That's right.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; Listen, I I mean this everybody here
[1:11:08] listen. It's amazing how many can come
[1:11:10] to church and not listen.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; But there's something about it. When you
[1:11:14] want to see Jesus real bad, you'll do
[1:11:16] anything.
[1:11:18] You'll do just anything. If you want to
[1:11:20] see him real bad, what was he? The way,
[1:11:21] the truth, the life.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; What is truth? It was Christ.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; If you really want to see it bad,
[1:11:28] Satan is going to try to keep you from
[1:11:30] doing it, too.
[1:11:33] You want Satan to show up?
[1:11:36] You want him to show up? Start seeking
[1:11:38] for truth.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; He's going to put a flaw in the way
[1:11:43] every time to keep you from seeing him.
[1:11:45] He'll blind your eyes with anything he
[1:11:47] can. But if you are determined, God will
[1:11:51] make a way for you. It's thus sayeth the
[1:11:54] Lord. If you want to see them, if you
[1:11:56] want to know them, you can guarantee
[1:11:58] that Satan will start trying to throw
[1:12:00] roadblocks and flaws your own or others,
[1:12:02] and he'll try to keep you from seeing
[1:12:04] truth. But don't turn away. Keep
[1:12:06] pursuing it with everything that's in
[1:12:08] you.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; Keep saying, "I want to see him. I want
[1:12:11] to know him. I want to feel them. I want
[1:12:12] that anchor."
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; No matter how many flaws he puts in your
[1:12:16] way, that's what he's good at.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; Did you not read the scouting report? He
[1:12:21] was already inducted into the Hall of
[1:12:23] Fame before his career ended and being
[1:12:24] the best at showing flaws and fa faults.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; But if you're determined, God will make
[1:12:29] a way for you.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; And we might say, "Oh, will he will he
[1:12:33] take all the flaws away?
[1:12:36] Will he change my past so that I I don't
[1:12:38] have these memories and these scars? Is
[1:12:40] everything going to be ever good at
[1:12:41] going to Columbia again?" No. You're
[1:12:43] going to look right at the flaw and all
[1:12:44] of a sudden you're going to say, "There
[1:12:46] he is.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; He was there all the time."
[1:12:51] He's in these broken pieces. Look at
[1:12:53] this beautiful picture. I see Christ in
[1:12:56] every verse. I even though these stories
[1:12:58] don't seem to line up with B 4 BC and 6
[1:13:01] AD and this one and that one and I I
[1:13:03] don't know what. But all of a sudden,
[1:13:04] God starts to make himself known and you
[1:13:06] can stand in the face of the flaws that
[1:13:09] won't go away. Say, I know my redeemer
[1:13:11] lives. I know this Bible is true. I know
[1:13:14] that God is a good God and a loving God
[1:13:17] and his love is to me. Amen.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; Sister Rebecca, if you could come to
[1:13:22] your instrument tonight, Brother Elliott
[1:13:24] in Hebrews 12:es 1:4.
[1:13:28] Brother Preston, I look forward to the
[1:13:29] day you grab that base.
[1:13:32] Wherefore, seeing we also are compassed
[1:13:34] about with so great a cloud of
[1:13:35] witnesses, let us lay aside every
[1:13:36] weight, and the sin which doth so easily
[1:13:39] beset us, and let us run with patience
[1:13:41] the race that is set before us.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; You got a race to run.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; Can Can I get any support tonight? I
[1:13:48] hate running.
[1:13:51] I knew God called me to the right group.
[1:13:54] Can't stand I don't even like to walk. I
[1:13:57] built my office three feet from my bed.
[1:14:00] I don't have to walk. I can just roll
[1:14:02] over and inchworm into my office. I just
[1:14:06] thought of it. I could sleep on a gurnie
[1:14:09] and just electric bed wake up
[1:14:13] just remote control myself into my
[1:14:15] office.
[1:14:17] be like hospice care.
[1:14:20] Call it hospice husk care.
[1:14:23] I don't like running, but I got a race
[1:14:25] to run.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; And running's not fun. Isn't it amazing
[1:14:29] what runners do to punish themselves and
[1:14:31] they love it? Hikers, people who love to
[1:14:32] hike, they haven't had fun until they're
[1:14:34] near death,
[1:14:36] right? But it's just in the nature of
[1:14:38] some people. Well, this is just that's
[1:14:40] just a poor example of what it means to
[1:14:42] be a Christian. You be you better be
[1:14:44] ready to run,
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; fight,
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; get got up. One thing I learned in
[1:14:50] hiking more since we moved back here to
[1:14:52] Arizona is anytime I would walk or hike,
[1:14:54] you'd reach that that initial exhaustion
[1:14:57] and pain like that's enough. We're not
[1:15:00] even to the trail head. I know I've had
[1:15:01] enough. Right? Then I keep pressing.
[1:15:06] You get past the initial weakness.
[1:15:09] You get past the initial fatigue. Your
[1:15:11] lungs start to burn. and you just keep
[1:15:12] going and your body just finds another
[1:15:14] level.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; That's the same way it is spiritually.
[1:15:17] Once it starts getting hard, don't stop.
[1:15:19] Don't go back down the mountain. Don't
[1:15:20] start questioning it. Keep pressing
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; cuz you have a race to run.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; Then what do I do? Well, look to Jesus.
[1:15:29] Looking unto Jesus, the author and
[1:15:31] finisher of our faith, who for the joy
[1:15:32] that was set before him, endured the
[1:15:34] cross, despising the shame, and is set
[1:15:36] down at the right hand of the throne of
[1:15:37] God.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; Okay. All right. For consider him that
[1:15:41] endured such contradictions of sinners
[1:15:43] against himself.
[1:15:46] Contradiction
[1:15:47] that sums up his life.
[1:15:49] [Music]
[1:15:51] Really his his yoke is easy and his
[1:15:52] burden is light. But Jesus, your
[1:15:54] testimony is rough.
[1:15:59] Your birth and your death hard to
[1:16:01] accept.
[1:16:03] Who can accept the birth of a virgin?
[1:16:05] Even when the prophecy in the Old
[1:16:07] Testament
[1:16:08] doesn't say that a woman who doesn't
[1:16:10] know a man will give birth to a child,
[1:16:12] it says a young maiden.
[1:16:15] But yet somewhere in that word, and I
[1:16:18] believe it was a virgin, a woman who
[1:16:21] never knew a man would conceive
[1:16:22] supernaturally the son of God. But
[1:16:25] textually, contextually, it doesn't
[1:16:28] always make sense.
[1:16:30] What is it? God
[1:16:33] let a hammer be taken to his masterpiece
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; so that we could recognize ourselves.
[1:16:42] Don't you recognize yourself?
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Don't you see yourself in the word?
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; He endured contradictions of sinners
[1:16:48] against himself, lest ye be wearied and
[1:16:50] faint in your minds. He was an example
[1:16:52] of us for us. And in him we see such
[1:16:55] great contradictions even in ourselves.
[1:16:56] Our hypocrisies,
[1:16:58] our inabilities to stand when we need
[1:17:01] to, lest you be weary and faint in your
[1:17:03] hearts. And then he says, just to remind
[1:17:05] us, you have not yet resisted under
[1:17:07] blood.
[1:17:09] You haven't been asked to give your
[1:17:10] life. Not yet. Striving against sin. And
[1:17:15] we have him who tasted it for us who can
[1:17:18] help us.
[1:17:21] Part of overcoming is recognizing the
[1:17:22] devil in every one of his tricks. And I
[1:17:24] could sum up his trick as saying he's
[1:17:26] really good at trying to find fault.
[1:17:30] But at the same time, you got to
[1:17:31] recognize that greater is he that is in
[1:17:32] you than he that is in the world. And
[1:17:34] through him, you are more than a match
[1:17:36] for the faultfinder.
[1:17:39] It's almost if to say that if he was to
[1:17:41] take a fault tonight and say,
[1:17:47] "Did you see that? Did you see this
[1:17:49] fault?
[1:17:52] And you'd be like, "Let me look at
[1:17:53] that." Yeah. Yep. That's a fault. That's
[1:17:58] me. I did that. Yeah, you're right.
[1:18:01] That's me. When the devil's over there
[1:18:03] going,
[1:18:05] told you
[1:18:07] there's the flaw. And he go, "But I just
[1:18:09] want you to notice something.
[1:18:12] That's what makes it a masterpiece.
[1:18:15] It's because of that I knew Christ as a
[1:18:18] healer.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; It's because of that I knew him as a
[1:18:21] deliverer.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; It's because of that I knew him that he
[1:18:24] forgave sins. It's because of this that
[1:18:26] I knew that he'd never leave me nor
[1:18:27] forsake me.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; The flaw.
[1:18:32] The flaw paradox. We're living it,
[1:18:34] saints.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; As I said Sunday,
[1:18:38] abandon. I didn't maybe put it these
[1:18:39] ways, but just abandon yourself to him
[1:18:41] because you could trust him. No matter
[1:18:44] how weak, how frail, how dark, how
[1:18:46] unnerving, how gutsick you are, whatever
[1:18:47] it might be. In that moment where it
[1:18:49] seems as if it's the darkest hour, it's
[1:18:51] then that you say, "God, I need you more
[1:18:56] than ever. Right now, I need you."
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Stand with me. Our gracious
[1:19:01] heavenly father,
[1:19:05] [Music]
[1:19:07] Lord, this sermon
[1:19:09] [Music]
[1:19:11] has so much
[1:19:13] [Music]
[1:19:15] There's so much in it for us to just
[1:19:18] yield to and open up our hearts to.
[1:19:21] I pray Lord that in the appropriateness
[1:19:23] of it, you could deal with each heart in
[1:19:26] a way that they feel comforted and
[1:19:27] encouraged.
[1:19:29] Lord, I'd love to be able to preach a
[1:19:30] gospel that tells them everything is
[1:19:31] going to be all right. You're never
[1:19:32] going to hurt. You're never going to
[1:19:33] agonize. You're never going to feel
[1:19:34] lost. You're never going to feel this.
[1:19:36] You're never going to feel that. But
[1:19:38] Lord, I can't do that because the word
[1:19:40] doesn't say that.
[1:19:42] But what I can say Lord
[1:19:45] is that in those things we are more than
[1:19:47] a conqueror.
[1:19:49] In those things we will not be forsaken.
[1:19:52] In those things we are not without hope.
[1:19:56] As Paul said we are compassed about on
[1:19:58] every side and we are perplexed and we
[1:20:00] are persecuted. And yet despite all
[1:20:02] those things he says we are not. We are
[1:20:04] not. We are not. Why? Because we have
[1:20:05] this treasure in this earth and vessel,
[1:20:09] the unbroken bones of Jesus Christ,
[1:20:14] the gold that holds us up.
[1:20:17] I pray Lord that we could continue to
[1:20:18] walk in your grace.
[1:20:21] That in doing so, recognizing our own
[1:20:23] faults and errors, we could be kind to
[1:20:25] ourselves because of your grace and kind
[1:20:27] to others.
[1:20:29] that we would never be without hope. Nor
[1:20:32] would we need fail to extend hope to
[1:20:36] others.
[1:20:38] This is your body.
[1:20:41] This is the way. Walk ye in it. Let us
[1:20:44] not turn to the left nor to the right.
[1:20:47] And we know that you'll see us all the
[1:20:48] way through to the end.
[1:20:51] Lord, I love these people here. I pray
[1:20:52] that you bless them. We pray for all
[1:20:53] those absent from us tonight. Bring us
[1:20:56] all back together safely on Sunday. I
[1:20:59] pray if you terry in the name of Lord
[1:21:01] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:21:05] Amen.
