[0:00] John chapter 5 verse
[0:03] 30-38 I can of my own self do nothing as
[0:07] I hear I judge and my judgment is just
[0:10] because I seek not my own will but the
[0:13] will of the father which hath sent me.
[0:15] If I bear witness of myself witnesses
[0:18] not true. There is another that beareth
[0:21] witness of me. And I know that the
[0:22] witness which he witnessth of me is
[0:25] true. Ye sin unto John and he beare
[0:28] witness unto the truth. But I receive
[0:30] not testimony from man, but these things
[0:32] I say that you might be saved. He was a
[0:35] burning and a shining light, and you're
[0:37] willing for a season to rejoice in his
[0:39] light. But I have a greater witness than
[0:42] that of John. For the works which the
[0:44] Father hath given me to finish the same
[0:45] works that I do bear witness of me, that
[0:48] the Father hath sent me. And the Father
[0:50] himself, which hath sent me, hath borne
[0:52] witness of me. You have neither heard
[0:54] his voice at any time, nor seen his
[0:56] shape, and ye have not his word abiding
[0:58] in you. For whom he hath sent him ye
[1:01] believe not. Amen. You can be
[1:05] seated. I have a a title tonight of
[1:08] real, relatable, relevant, and we're
[1:11] kind of foreshadowing a little bit on
[1:13] some other subjects that we going to be
[1:15] touching on tonight. We're going to
[1:16] focus more on the real aspect. These are
[1:19] elements of being a witness. real,
[1:22] relatable, and relevant. And in this, a
[1:26] witness is one who testifies of a fact
[1:28] or event from personal knowledge. It's
[1:30] one that bears testimony. And so, we've
[1:33] been looking at that particular aspect.
[1:35] So, I'm wanting these terms to kind of
[1:36] be uh used in light of this subject of
[1:40] being a witness, one that bears
[1:42] testimony. And so in introducing these
[1:44] different principles of real, relatable
[1:46] and relevant, I believe these can be
[1:48] applied to different aspects of being a
[1:50] witness, but then also applied to
[1:52] different aspects of witnessing or
[1:54] something that has that takes place on
[1:57] different levels and these are
[1:58] applicable. Lord's just been dealing
[2:00] with my heart over the last couple
[2:01] months in a way to put this so that it
[2:03] might be uh easily grasped. That's one
[2:05] of the reasons why we've taken this
[2:06] approach this year on using art is we
[2:09] want the word of God to be attainable
[2:10] and reachable, something that we can
[2:12] relate to that. And so that's part of
[2:14] even this thought we're looking at. And
[2:16] so these apply in different ways, but
[2:19] real as we're looking at it tonight,
[2:21] that means from a scriptural standpoint,
[2:23] real is not imaginary or pretended. It
[2:26] means to be authentic or genuine. So if
[2:29] it's real, it's not imaginary. It's not
[2:32] uh pretend. It's not makebelieve, but it
[2:34] means it exists in reality. And so when
[2:37] someone says it's real cheese, you
[2:39] expect it to be actual cheese. And so if
[2:42] something is real, it's not imaginary or
[2:45] pretend. It's authentic, genuine, and
[2:47] not fictitious or imaginary, but genuine
[2:49] and true. Those are the words that are
[2:51] used or definition that's used in the
[2:53] Bible when true is used or truth. It's
[2:55] that alaththenos. It's something that is
[2:58] real. And I'll say this, if you're going
[3:00] to be a witness, your testimony or your
[3:04] witness must be real. Must be something
[3:06] real. And that's what we're going to be
[3:08] focusing on tonight is this being real,
[3:10] being genuine, being this authentic uh
[3:12] person. Now, in John chapter 5, we'll
[3:15] start with verse 30 and we'll read to
[3:17] verse 31. Then we'll jump through and
[3:18] we'll continue through the remainder of
[3:20] this text. He says, "I can." Christ now
[3:23] says, "I can of my own self do nothing.
[3:27] As I hear, I judge. So my the judgment
[3:30] that he's given, he says, "My judgments
[3:32] are just. I'm only judging based upon
[3:35] what has been shown to me, what has been
[3:37] given to me." Brother Modin, good to see
[3:38] you. I didn't didn't notice you there.
[3:40] Right right there in the middle and
[3:41] didn't even notice you. God bless you.
[3:42] We welcome you. As I hear, I judge, and
[3:45] my judgment is just. So, he's not using
[3:47] his own thoughts, his own opinions, but
[3:49] he hears from the father. He can do
[3:51] nothing of himself, but he says what the
[3:53] father says. He does what the father
[3:55] wants him to do. As I hear, I judge, and
[3:57] my judgment is true. It is right, is
[3:59] correct, because I seek not my own will,
[4:02] but the will of the Father, which hath
[4:03] sent me. So, he's been sent by the
[4:05] Father to say what the Father told him
[4:07] to say. Then he uses this phrase. This
[4:10] is real key to where we're looking at
[4:11] tonight. If I bear witness of myself, my
[4:14] witness is not true. That doesn't mean
[4:17] that what he's saying is a lie, but he's
[4:18] talking about something being uh it uh
[4:22] not it's not admissible. you don't have
[4:24] to rely on it's not admissible as
[4:25] evidence but yet is uh his witness is
[4:29] genuine is authentic but yet if he says
[4:32] I'm just if I just bear witness of
[4:33] myself then it's something that's not
[4:36] admissible and what he's doing is he's
[4:38] actually admitting that under their law
[4:40] and their structure that if he was in
[4:42] the court of their opinion or their
[4:43] judgment his single witness would not be
[4:46] legally sufficient. So he's saying, "I'm
[4:48] not just testifying of myself because
[4:50] even in your own law and in your own
[4:52] worldview and how you do things, you
[4:54] would not accept that." So I'd be
[4:56] fighting uphill if I was just to say,
[4:57] "Well, believe me just because I'm
[4:59] telling you as a single witness."
[5:01] Deuteronomy 17:6, it says, "At the mouth
[5:04] of two witnesses or three witnesses
[5:06] shall he that is worthy of death be put
[5:08] to death." And it says, "But at the
[5:10] mouth of one witness shall not he shall
[5:13] not be put to death." So this is in
[5:15] their law that on the word of one person
[5:18] someone could not be guilty of a sin
[5:20] that was punishable or transgression
[5:22] that was punishable by death. It needed
[5:24] two or three. Again in chapter 19 of
[5:27] Deuteronomy verse 15. One witness shall
[5:30] not rise up against a man for any
[5:32] iniquity or any sin in any sin that he
[5:35] sinnth. At the mouth of two witnesses or
[5:37] at the mouth of three witnesses shall
[5:40] the matter be established. again at two
[5:42] or three or two or three the matter has
[5:45] to be established through notice the
[5:46] term not just one witness but two
[5:50] witnesses or three witnesses. So Jesus,
[5:52] when he says, "If I bear witness of
[5:55] myself, my witness is not true." He's
[5:57] speaking to something that they held in
[5:58] their minds according to their law. And
[6:01] he's acknowledging that in their
[6:02] reality, according to their court, if
[6:04] he's in their court, which he is, uh
[6:07] they uh they would not accept his
[6:11] singular
[6:12] witness. So he's not insisting that they
[6:16] just believe him because he says so.
[6:17] Necessarily does not insist on them
[6:19] accepting a single witness. Actually in
[6:22] the Jewish cannon as I was studying it
[6:23] in their Jewish law they did not even
[6:25] allow one man to be a witness for
[6:27] himself. The phrase would be no man is
[6:30] to be believed for himself. There's a
[6:32] number of different instances where you
[6:34] can read uh in their rich history and
[6:36] their oral tradition and all the the
[6:38] laws that they gathered around the laws
[6:40] that a man could not witness for
[6:43] himself. Somebody else had to stand and
[6:45] witness. So Christ is actually reasoning
[6:48] on their own principles and he's
[6:51] actually using this uh as not I won't
[6:54] just insist on my own as even a human
[6:57] testimony. I'm not just going to insist
[6:58] on it because he knew to them that would
[7:00] not be sufficient. But look at this in
[7:03] John 8 12 to 19. And I'm glad I feel
[7:07] like I've got you all in suspense. Says
[7:10] then Jesus then spake Jesus again unto
[7:12] them saying I am the light of the world.
[7:14] He that followeth me shall not walk in
[7:16] darkness, but shall have the light of
[7:18] life. The Pharisees therefore said unto
[7:21] him, Thou beest record of thyself. Thy
[7:23] record is not true. What were they
[7:25] drawing from? Their legal tradition or
[7:28] their approach where one had to have
[7:30] somebody else testify for them in order
[7:33] for them to be admissible of what was
[7:36] being said or what they're presenting to
[7:37] be accepted. And Jesus says, and it
[7:40] might seem like it's contradicting what
[7:41] he said earlier, but he says, Jesus
[7:43] answered and said unto them, though I
[7:45] bear record of myself, yet my record is
[7:47] true. In other words, it's real. It's
[7:49] genuine. Even though I'm bearing record
[7:51] of myself, it is authentic. Not that you
[7:53] have to accept it according to your
[7:55] traditions, but it is true. But catch
[7:57] what he says. For I know where I come
[8:00] from. I know whence I came and where I
[8:03] go, whether I go, but ye cannot tell
[8:05] whence I come and whether I go. Now,
[8:08] what has he done? He's appealed to a
[8:09] different reality and he's saying that
[8:12] you I'm coming and as in your eye as a
[8:14] human, you won't accept my human
[8:16] testimony of myself because you have the
[8:19] tradition and it's written in your law
[8:20] that you're not to accept the witness of
[8:23] one man if he speaks for himself. But
[8:25] he's saying, I am not of the same ilk
[8:28] that you're of. I'm don't come from the
[8:30] same way. I know where I came from. I
[8:32] know where I'm going, but you can't tell
[8:35] where I come from and where I go. says,
[8:37] "Ye judge after the flesh." So what is
[8:39] he saying? I'm not judging after the
[8:41] flesh. You judge by human means. You
[8:43] look for human testimony. It has to be
[8:45] cooperated a certain way. I don't judge
[8:47] any man. He says, I judge no man. In
[8:49] other words, I don't judge after the
[8:50] flesh. Yet if I judge, my judgment is
[8:53] true. It is real. It is genuine. It is
[8:55] authentic. For I am not alone, but I am
[8:58] the father that sent me. So he's not
[9:01] coming on his own. And he's not saying
[9:03] just believe me. He's actually saying I
[9:05] come as a representative of the father
[9:07] and what I speak is I'm witnessing and
[9:10] testifying what God your father has told
[9:13] me to say. It is also written in your
[9:15] law. So he's drawing specifically from
[9:17] where we read that the testimony of two
[9:20] men is true. I am one that bear witness
[9:23] of myself and the father that sent me
[9:26] beareth witness of me. And so they said
[9:29] then said they unto him where is thy
[9:31] father? Jesus answered, "You neither
[9:33] know me nor my father. If you had known
[9:36] me, you should have known my father
[9:38] also." Here he's pressing on these two
[9:42] different realities, if I could put it
[9:43] that way, since we're only looking at
[9:44] something genuine and real. And he's
[9:47] pointing out that there's something that
[9:48] he's testifying of that's obviously not
[9:51] real to them. It's a paradigm or view or
[9:54] something that they could not know,
[9:56] something that they had not experienced.
[9:58] So he says, "There is another that
[10:00] beareth witness of me." He's actually
[10:01] speaking of the father as I know that
[10:03] the witness which he witness of me is
[10:05] true. My record is true because God
[10:08] speaks of me he testifies of me. This is
[10:11] in John chapter 5 verse 30 uh or where
[10:15] he's still on John 8 there. Okay. Says I
[10:17] am the one that bear witness of myself.
[10:19] Ye neither known me nor my father. If
[10:21] you had known me, you should have known
[10:23] my father also.
[10:25] Now you this
[10:27] is uh it's important to catch this
[10:30] because now he's saying I'm I'm existing
[10:32] with knowledge of God that you don't
[10:34] have. So now in John 5:32, there is
[10:37] another that beareth witness of me and I
[10:40] know that that witness which he
[10:41] witnessed me is true. That's speaking of
[10:44] the father. Ye sent unto John. You went
[10:47] and inquired of John and you asked of
[10:48] him and he says and he bear witness unto
[10:51] the truth. So the father is the one that
[10:54] has sent him. And then we're going to
[10:55] read here in a moment how the father was
[10:57] doing these works through Christ and
[10:59] these things were being accomplished and
[11:00] that was a witness on behalf of Christ.
[11:02] But he says you asked of John and he
[11:05] gave you witness to who I was. Look in
[11:08] John 1 19 to 23 and this is the record
[11:12] or testimony witness of John when the
[11:15] Jews sent priests and Levites from
[11:17] Jerusalem to ask him who art thou? So
[11:20] they went and actually inquired of John,
[11:21] who are you? This is one that they had
[11:23] received and believed in. And he
[11:25] confessed and denied not, but confessed,
[11:27] I am not the Christ. And they asked
[11:29] them, "What then? Art thou Elijah?" And
[11:31] he said, "I am not." It's interesting
[11:34] that he says, "He's not Elijah." He
[11:35] says, "Art thou that prophet?" And he
[11:38] answered, "No." So he even knew that
[11:40] what they were looking for was a coming
[11:42] of Elijah that was different than the
[11:44] one that was being experienced then. And
[11:46] he knew that one was still yet to come.
[11:49] Then said they unto him, "Who art thou,
[11:51] that we may give an answer to them that
[11:53] sent us?" When sayest thou of thyself,
[11:55] he said, 'I am the voice of one crying
[11:57] in the wilderness, make straight the way
[11:59] of the Lord, as said the prophet Isaiah.
[12:02] You'll find in the very next verses,
[12:04] even the Pharisees begin to inquire of
[12:05] him. And then it says he's baptizing the
[12:07] next day. And he says, "Behold the lamb
[12:09] of God that takes away the sins of the
[12:11] world. This is the one that I was
[12:12] telling you I was sent before." He says,
[12:15] "And I witness the Holy Spirit descend
[12:17] upon him." And he gives this
[12:18] confirmation, this witness. And he
[12:20] testifies of what he knows of this being
[12:23] the Messiah and the father vindicating
[12:25] it with that dove that came down upon
[12:27] him. And Jesus is saying, "You accepted
[12:30] John and he bear record of me. He
[12:32] testified of me to the truth of who I
[12:35] am." John 5:34, he says, "But I receive
[12:39] not testimony from man. I am not relying
[12:42] solely on human testimony, but these
[12:45] things I say that you might be saved. He
[12:48] was, speaking of John, a burning and
[12:49] shining light, and ye were willing for a
[12:51] season to rejoice in his light. They had
[12:53] accepted him for a season and believed
[12:55] he was real. But I have greater witness
[12:59] than that of
[13:00] John. Greater testimony. For the works
[13:02] which the Father hath given me to
[13:04] finish, the same works that I do bear
[13:07] witness of me that the Father hath sent
[13:10] me. He's maintaining this very close
[13:12] relationship to the fact that God, the
[13:14] one that they claimed to serve, had sent
[13:16] him, and the works he was doing were by
[13:19] God, and those works were testifying and
[13:22] giving witness. Was it just his word
[13:24] only through human means or human
[13:25] convincing? But he had the witness of
[13:27] the father. And the father himself which
[13:29] hath sent me hath borne witness of me.
[13:33] And again, notice what he says. Ye have
[13:35] neither heard his voice at any time nor
[13:38] seen his shape. This is this isn't
[13:40] something they've experienced. This
[13:42] isn't something they know, but he's
[13:44] trying to testify to them and witnessed
[13:46] in them about the reality of God. And
[13:48] it's very hard for them to accept it
[13:49] because of their own paradigm and their
[13:51] way of viewing things. He says, "You
[13:53] have not his word abiding in you. For
[13:55] whom he hath sent him ye believed not."
[13:58] There it is again. It's that faith.
[13:59] What's the work of God? To believe upon
[14:01] him whom he hath sent. So he's saying,
[14:03] "The Father who has sent me has
[14:05] testified about me, but you can't hear
[14:07] it and you can't see it." And he's
[14:09] saying, "I know where I came from. I
[14:11] know where I'm going. This is real to
[14:13] me. It's this is not fake. This is not
[14:16] pretend. It's real to me. And I know
[14:18] that my witness is true."
[14:21] So Christ, we could say, we've already
[14:23] looked at how he is a true witness, but
[14:25] he's a true witness that's testifying to
[14:27] them of a reality beyond the one that
[14:30] they're presently
[14:31] experiencing, beyond the one that's
[14:33] structured around laws and how they
[14:35] judge things and the way that they judge
[14:37] man after mankind and they judge
[14:39] humanly. He's saying, "I don't judge the
[14:40] same way. What I'm coming to you with is
[14:43] not all the same things you're thinking
[14:45] about through your human senses." but he
[14:47] was sent from the father to testify of a
[14:50] different reality.
[14:52] Now, let's turn to John 20 21. So, this
[14:55] is where we're going to just turn a
[14:56] little bit, go just a little bit
[14:58] further. I don't expect to be very much
[15:00] longer this evening. And so, the more
[15:03] you pull, the more you enter in, the
[15:04] faster we will go. John 20 21. Then said
[15:08] Jesus unto them again, peace be unto
[15:11] you. As my father hath sent me, even so
[15:15] send I you as I came in my father's name
[15:19] and in hisstead or as his representative
[15:21] and as his voice I even going I am going
[15:24] to send you in my place. I'm going to
[15:27] send you out. So Christ was the the
[15:31] apostle, the representative, the witness
[15:33] of the father. He says now you are going
[15:36] to be witnesses of me. I'm going to send
[15:39] you. That word there send in the second
[15:41] part as the father hath sent me even so
[15:42] I send you. That Greek word is this
[15:45] notion of delegated authority that
[15:48] constitutes that uh the person that is
[15:50] being sent. You have delegated
[15:52] authority. You're this envoy. It's
[15:54] representative of the sender. Christ
[15:56] sends you. So now you represent him.
[15:59] Says it in chapter 17 18. As thou hast
[16:02] sent me into the world, even so I as
[16:05] he's praying to the father, even so have
[16:06] I also sent them into the world. The
[16:10] father sent him to be a witness. And his
[16:11] witness was true. We read about that in
[16:13] John chapter 5 and chapter 8. And we
[16:15] were looking at how that he was sent to
[16:17] be a witness. And now he's saying that
[16:20] as I was sent by the father to be a
[16:23] witness and I witness for him, now I'm
[16:26] sending you. I'm sending them to be a
[16:28] witness for me. You following how this
[16:31] order is working? Paul says it this way
[16:33] in 2 Corinthians chapter 5:20. Now then,
[16:36] we are ambassadors for Christ. We are
[16:39] his envoy. We are his representative. To
[16:42] be an ambassador means to undertake an
[16:44] embassy. That means a mission. You given
[16:46] charge. You represent Christ. So, you're
[16:48] commissioned. You're equipped as an
[16:51] envoy, as a specifically called and
[16:53] selected person to deliver a message. We
[16:57] are ambassadors for Christ. as though
[16:59] God did beseech you by us. You listening
[17:02] to this? We pray you in the place of
[17:05] Christ, in Christstead, be ye reconciled
[17:09] to God. This is exactly what Christ
[17:11] intended when he said, "As the Father
[17:13] has sent me, so I send you. As I am
[17:16] here, and I've been so long with you,
[17:18] and you should have known the Father,
[17:20] because I declare unto you the Father.
[17:22] I'm going to send you in like manner as
[17:24] ambassadors." And Paul says, "Therefore,
[17:27] I can stand and say in the place of
[17:30] Christ as the voice of God, be
[17:33] reconciled." Amen. So Paul could come
[17:36] with the full powers of Christ to
[17:39] publish and proclaim as if it was
[17:42] actually made by Christ.
[17:44] Brother Bram said, "If you're an
[17:45] ambassador from heaven, all heaven is
[17:47] behind you." He says, "And all heaven
[17:50] consists of the word." Catch that.
[17:53] That's an important phrase. All heaven
[17:55] cons is consisted of the word. So here
[17:59] he has as Christ came and was a witness
[18:01] and testified of the father. Now we are
[18:04] sent to be witnesses uh to be
[18:07] ambassadors are given this delegated
[18:09] authority that constitutes that it
[18:12] constitutes the one that we're we're
[18:14] representatives of
[18:16] Christ. In Luke chap 24:es 45- 49 Christ
[18:22] now in his uh after be after his
[18:25] resurrection and before his ascension he
[18:28] says then opened he their understanding
[18:31] that they might understand the
[18:32] scriptures. So this is important. He's
[18:34] teaching them. He's opened up their
[18:35] understanding. He's giving them greater
[18:37] knowledge. He says, "And said unto them,
[18:39] thus it is written, and thus it behooved
[18:41] Christ to suffer and to rise from the
[18:43] dead the third day. And now subsequently
[18:47] repentance and remission of sins should
[18:48] be preached in his name among all
[18:50] nations beginning at Jerusalem."
[18:54] It it says repentance and remission
[18:55] should be preached in his name upon his
[18:57] authority
[18:59] in as if it was Christ preaching. It's
[19:03] to be preached among all nations
[19:04] beginning at Jerusalem. So he says,
[19:07] since it must be preached, catch this
[19:09] key verse here in verse 48. And ye are
[19:11] witnesses of these things. And behold, I
[19:15] send the promise of my father upon you.
[19:17] But ter ye in the city of Jerusalem
[19:19] until you be endued with power from on
[19:22] high. He's actually qualifying them as
[19:25] witnesses. He's opening up their
[19:26] understanding. He's teaching them. He's
[19:28] establishing what they've witnessed and
[19:30] seen that Christ must suffer. He's rose
[19:32] from the dead. And now what is next is
[19:34] that the gospel must be preached in the
[19:36] name of Christ to all nations starting
[19:39] first at Jerusalem. And so since you are
[19:42] witnesses of these things, I'm going to
[19:44] endue you with power from on high. The
[19:46] father is going to endue you with power
[19:48] so that you can be true witnesses that
[19:51] can testify not of the history of Christ
[19:54] but the reality of
[19:56] Christ. Brother Brandham said God who
[19:58] God sends God
[20:00] protects. God confirms the word. If God
[20:03] sent an ambassador somewhere to do
[20:05] something, he's got to stand behind that
[20:07] commission. So here he's going to stand
[20:09] behind that. He's going to endue them
[20:11] with power from on high that's going to
[20:13] qualify and substantiate their ability
[20:15] to witness and testify of something, the
[20:18] gospel. They're going to be preached
[20:20] repentance or remission of sins. How are
[20:22] they going to preach that if they
[20:23] haven't experienced that? How are they
[20:26] going to be able to preach the the the
[20:27] quickening power of God if they have not
[20:29] experienced
[20:31] that? Luke writes it this way in Luke
[20:34] 1:es 1 to4.
[20:36] And we can see here in Luke 24, his
[20:38] understanding was open. Christ taught
[20:40] him. Christ commissioned him. And so
[20:43] when Luke writes this, he introduces his
[20:45] letter this way. For as much as many
[20:47] have taken in hand to set forth in order
[20:49] a declaration of those things which are
[20:51] most surely believed among us, many have
[20:53] been writing, these other apostles have
[20:55] written these letters, even as they
[20:57] delivered them unto us, which from the
[20:59] beginning were eyewitnesses and
[21:00] ministers of the word. Their witness is
[21:02] true. They saw it. They experienced it.
[21:04] Their understanding has been opened.
[21:06] They saw the works. They heard the
[21:08] voice. So he says, see, and they've had
[21:10] their voice and their witness. It seemed
[21:12] good to me also. Verse three, having had
[21:15] perfect understanding of all things from
[21:17] the first, to write under thee in order,
[21:19] most excellent Theophilus, that thou
[21:21] mightest know the certainty of those
[21:23] things wherein thou hast been
[21:26] instructed. Luke is taking it very
[21:28] seriously that as Christ was sent by the
[21:30] father, so has he been sent. and having
[21:33] an understanding and being an
[21:34] eyewitness. He wants to make certain
[21:37] ensured to Theophilles even by this
[21:39] letter. I want to testify. I want to
[21:40] give witness. I want to give my voice to
[21:42] those things which I know to be
[21:45] true. He's not doing it of his own. He's
[21:48] not testifying of himself. He's a
[21:50] representative of
[21:52] Christ. In Acts 1:8, he says, "But ye
[21:55] shall receive power." This is Christ
[21:57] again after the same order of how you
[22:00] will be endued with power from on high.
[22:02] Repentance and remissions must be
[22:04] preached in his name in hisstead among
[22:06] all nations beginning at Jerusalem. So
[22:08] it says it this way. Ye shall receive
[22:10] power after that the Holy Ghost has come
[22:12] upon you has come upon you there. Once
[22:15] you believed and you received this
[22:17] power, the Holy Ghost is going to give
[22:19] you power and ye shall be witnesses unto
[22:23] me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea
[22:26] and in Samaria and to the uttermost
[22:29] parts of the earth. Ye shall be martyrs.
[22:31] We might say martyrs in our English. You
[22:33] shall be witnesses unto me. You're going
[22:35] to prove by example the genuiness of
[22:38] your faith. You're going to testify.
[22:40] You're going to witness. You're going to
[22:43] broadcast of Christ beginning at
[22:48] Jerusalem. When they received the Holy
[22:50] Ghost, it empowered them to be
[22:52] witnesses. What were they testifying of?
[22:54] Not a historical Christ, a present
[22:56] Christ, one that was a reality to them.
[22:59] Once they received the Holy Ghost, now
[23:01] they could testify and say, "I know that
[23:03] God is real." A and I'm wanting to
[23:05] preach to you and show to you and
[23:07] express to you the realities of the word
[23:09] of God. I'm not just reading in the word
[23:10] and kind of speculating. I'm not just
[23:12] quoting. I'm not just putting together
[23:14] uh uh uh you know, some siloquies, some
[23:16] things that I had chat GPT drum up. I'm
[23:18] going to declare to you something that I
[23:20] know is reality in my heart.
[23:24] Peter says it this way in 2 Peter
[23:26] chapter 1:16.
[23:28] having witnessed the voice on Mount
[23:29] Transfiguration. He says, we witnessed
[23:31] this rehearsal of his coming. We've seen
[23:33] these things take place. If we have not
[23:36] followed cunningly devised fables, we're
[23:38] not making this up. This isn't fiction.
[23:40] We're not just imagining this when we
[23:43] made known unto you the power and coming
[23:45] of our Lord Jesus Christ. But we were
[23:48] eyewitnesses of his
[23:50] majesty. Peter's saying, "I'm a true
[23:52] witness. I've seen it. I know it. I'm
[23:55] not just making this up. I'm not just
[23:57] devising this. I'm not just conjuring
[23:58] this up. This isn't part of my own
[24:01] imagination. This is real. I am an
[24:04] eyewitness of his
[24:07] majesty. Proverbs 13:1 17 says, "A
[24:11] wicked messenger fallth into mischief,
[24:13] but a faithful ambassador is
[24:16] health." A true ambassador brings
[24:20] healing.
[24:22] A true ambassador is one who is faithful
[24:24] to say what needs to be said even at the
[24:26] meaning of the scripture that one who's
[24:28] a wicked and and not faithful even the
[24:30] wounds of a friend are faithful someone
[24:32] who's willing to be honest a faithful
[24:35] ambassador one who's an envoy someone
[24:37] who is an embassy sent on behalf of
[24:40] somebody one that has the truth an
[24:42] eyewitness he brings health he brings
[24:44] healing to love your neighbor fulfills
[24:47] the law is a an Easter egg a lingering
[24:50] reference from a prior
[24:53] sermon, brother says this in
[24:55] confirmation of the
[24:57] commission. This was I believe this one
[24:59] was preached in Tempe. I was really
[25:00] enjoying a lot of things in this. Maybe
[25:02] if you could go back and listen to this
[25:04] yourselves or read it, I think it'd be
[25:05] very appropriate for this theme. He
[25:07] says, "We find so many times, listen to
[25:08] this, it's so good. We find so many
[25:10] times in the army, I've heard my
[25:12] brothers and many of those who are
[25:13] overseas, many times the Japanese and
[25:16] the Germans and the other alien
[25:17] countries that were against us in the
[25:19] war." He's kind of looking at it
[25:21] historically. If they could find a dead
[25:23] pick up a dead soldier and get one of
[25:25] their soldiers in uniform that would fit
[25:26] him, he could impersonate an American
[25:29] soldier. Think of this very deeply now.
[25:31] He can wear the garb. He kind of present
[25:34] outwardly something. And he had to be
[25:37] properly identified or they'd never
[25:39] believe his uniform or maybe his tag he
[25:42] had on his neck. So, I'm not just going
[25:44] to go by the uniform or the tag. there
[25:47] was something maybe unknown or secret, a
[25:49] secret password or code, and he had to
[25:51] properly be identified or they'd never
[25:53] believe what he what he looked like. He
[25:55] had to be identified that he was an
[25:56] American soldier because could easily be
[25:59] a spy.
[26:01] He says just any cheap spy can wear wear
[26:04] a uniform of the United States, right?
[26:07] Kind of that's kind of nice. Cold War,
[26:09] espionage, war spies. He says we find
[26:12] that in all walks of life. Well, it was
[26:15] kind of fun, brother Bradom, when you
[26:16] were talking about war, espionage and
[26:18] spies and the KGB and the CIA, but now
[26:22] in all walks of life. And then this is
[26:25] the example he gives to me. It's just
[26:26] remarkable. We find today maybe on the
[26:28] street we hear many a person say that
[26:30] they're
[26:33] American. American. Listen, come on you
[26:36] Republicans. I want you to hear
[26:37] this. And here's some time ago coming
[26:40] out of the quartermaster that used to be
[26:42] there at Jeffersonville. I was walking
[26:44] one morning going on patrol and there
[26:46] was a well-dressed fellow walking down
[26:47] the street, great big cigar in his
[26:49] mouth, an employee of the government. He
[26:52] looked over at me in the morning with a
[26:53] pair of sunglasses on. I said, "Good
[26:55] morning, sir." He looked over at me and
[26:57] said, started walking on. Now I thought
[27:00] to myself self self he says I thought to
[27:03] myself I shouldn't say nothing but in my
[27:06] heart he wasn't really an
[27:09] American because American principles are
[27:12] not based upon such as
[27:14] that what do you think he says it's
[27:16] based on guns
[27:19] right freedom of speech right those are
[27:23] America
[27:27] right up
[27:29] Listen, America's principles are not
[27:32] based upon such such stuff as that
[27:34] fellowship, tolerance,
[27:38] goodwill. And all the bleeding heart
[27:40] liberals
[27:42] said, brother Ram said, "This is what
[27:44] America's based on. Fellowship,
[27:47] tolerance,
[27:50] goodwill." You see, all that live in
[27:53] America are not Americans. There are
[27:55] spies, communist, and everything
[27:58] else. And the only way that we know we
[28:00] can really know whether they're right or
[28:02] not is by their actual what's inside of
[28:05] them. Whether their heart is in America
[28:08] or just their pocketbook.
[28:12] Is that a riff on is is he ripping on
[28:14] capitalism now?
[28:16] Fellowship, tolerance, goodwill.
[28:20] He's saying if you don't have this,
[28:21] you're not American.
[28:25] Just because you wave an American flag
[28:27] doesn't make you American. It depends on
[28:30] what it is. Any phony can have these
[28:32] so-called credentials and still not be a
[28:35] real genuine
[28:37] article. That's why I believe that all
[28:39] who come our way calling themselves
[28:41] Christians, ambassadors sent from
[28:43] heaven, they should have a confirmation
[28:45] of their commission. I believe there
[28:47] should be a confirmation of their
[28:49] commission. Now let's just take the two
[28:51] examples that he gave and apply it to
[28:53] now how he's saying confirmation of the
[28:55] commission and how we are to be
[28:57] ambassadors of Christ as he was sent by
[28:59] the father and the father witnessed and
[29:01] vindicated to him said I know where I
[29:03] came from I know where I'm going the
[29:04] father he testifies of me he witnesses
[29:07] he backs up and proves the things that I
[29:09] say and the father is with me and so as
[29:11] the father has been with me so shall you
[29:14] be sent and he will be with you and the
[29:16] comforter will come brother saying if
[29:18] we're going to be his ambassadors and
[29:19] representatives. If we're going to stand
[29:22] in thestead of Christ, we have to have a
[29:24] confirmation of our Christian our our
[29:27] commission so that we can be the real
[29:29] genuine article, right? So that there
[29:32] can be something authentic about us and
[29:34] we're not just spies. We're not just
[29:36] putting on a dead soldier's
[29:39] uniform. We're not just pretending to be
[29:41] American. We're not just pretending to
[29:43] be Christian. He uses an example of a
[29:45] spy in an espionage with the intent
[29:47] maybe to deceive. and how someone worked
[29:49] for the government and was supposed to
[29:52] be an American, but in brother Brandon's
[29:54] view, this is him personally saying they
[29:56] didn't act like an American. Where was
[29:58] the fellowship? Where was the goodwill?
[30:00] Where was this reciprocation of my
[30:03] greetings? Where's the
[30:07] tolerance? Now, there's so there's an
[30:10] applicable and and then I would say if
[30:13] we want to be good Americans based upon
[30:15] what brother Brandham said, we should
[30:16] have fellowship, tolerance, and
[30:17] goodwill.
[30:18] But I'm not here preaching to
[30:20] Republicans and Democrats. I'm preaching
[30:22] to Christians. And in the same way, in
[30:25] the same manner, the kingdom that we
[30:26] were a part of, that we are a part of
[30:28] has certain
[30:30] characteristics. And he says that those
[30:32] that call themselves Christians, your
[30:34] heart better be in it.
[30:37] Not just in it for the wrong reasons or
[30:40] pretending. There must be a confirmation
[30:42] of your commission.
[30:45] I want to use this scripture. in 1 John
[30:48] chapter 5. And since I want to use it, I
[30:50] will use it. In 1 John chapter 5, 19,
[30:54] 20, and 21, now catch this in the same
[30:57] way that Jesus was saying, you don't
[31:01] know where I come from and where I'm
[31:02] going. You don't know the father. The
[31:04] word does not abide in you. And he's
[31:05] kind of drawing this line saying, you
[31:07] look at me as merely human. I'm not
[31:09] merely human. My reality goes beyond
[31:12] human means. I'm not subject to the same
[31:14] laws that you're thinking about. And so
[31:16] think of it in the same way here in 1
[31:18] John chapter 5 these three verses. We
[31:20] know that we are of
[31:23] God. This is something where he's saying
[31:26] we are of God not just of man. We have
[31:28] some deity in us. We're not just merely
[31:30] humanity. We know that we are of God and
[31:33] the whole world lith in wickedness. So
[31:36] now he has drawn that same dichotomy to
[31:38] where I come from God. I go to God is
[31:40] how Christ was saying it. Now John is
[31:42] saying we are from God. We are part of
[31:45] God. and the whole world is groping in
[31:47] darkness in evil and we know that the
[31:51] son of God is come and have given us an
[31:53] understanding. These are these
[31:55] principles upon which your experience
[31:57] must be based that we know that we have
[31:59] been born again by the baptism of the
[32:01] Holy Ghost. It has given us an
[32:03] understanding that we might know him
[32:05] that is and the Greek word is
[32:07] real or true here in the scripture and
[32:10] we are in him that is real. We are in
[32:13] him that is true even in his son Jesus
[32:15] Christ. This is the real God. This is
[32:17] the true God and eternal life. So we are
[32:20] in him. This is our reality. I my
[32:23] reality is not just based upon me being
[32:26] born of a woman. My reality is not just
[32:28] based in my human experience. I am of
[32:30] God because the Holy Spirit has come
[32:32] into me and given me an understanding
[32:35] and I know a reality beyond the human
[32:38] one. Think of this. Isn't that what we
[32:40] want to testify to to people? Isn't that
[32:43] what we want to be a witness of, but yet
[32:45] look wholly human
[32:48] where Jesus wasn't 900t tall and just
[32:50] kind of hovering in the air and said,
[32:51] "Come on, everybody believe in me." And
[32:53] they're like, "Well, I kind of think I
[32:54] probably should, but rather he looks
[32:57] human. He looked a man about 50 years
[32:58] old and and there was a lot of humanity
[33:00] about him, but he's trying to implore
[33:02] them and speak to him." And this great
[33:03] miracle would be that they could believe
[33:05] in him and trust in him.
[33:08] It's one of the hardest things that
[33:10] God's ever had to do is to get one man
[33:11] to believe in another.
[33:16] And then he makes this statement in
[33:17] verse 21, little children, keep
[33:21] yourselves from
[33:26] idols. Keep yourselves from
[33:30] idols. We are of God and the whole world
[33:32] lith in wickedness. Now I want to read
[33:34] this statement from brother Brandham in
[33:35] Hebrews chapter 2 part one. He says, "A
[33:38] messenger." You are a messenger. What
[33:40] are you, a messenger? From
[33:42] God. You are a messenger of good news or
[33:46] a messenger of bad news. So, I guess
[33:49] you're going to be a messenger
[33:51] regardless. Oh, isn't it beautiful? I
[33:54] guess if you shut up your mouth to the
[33:55] good news, it defaults to bad news. You
[33:59] know how they say uh bad news is good
[34:01] news, right? You know, to good bad
[34:03] publicity is good publicity, right? Any
[34:05] publicity is good. Well, we're not in
[34:07] marketing in that way. We're not not
[34:09] looking for clout or to go viral. And so
[34:12] they some say no news is good news in
[34:14] certain situations. Well, that's not how
[34:16] it works with the gospel. You can't keep
[34:18] your lip shut and not be guilty of bad
[34:20] news.
[34:23] You can't choose not to testify. You
[34:25] can't exercise your American rights. The
[34:28] fifth, I plead the fifth, God. No,
[34:30] there's no fifth.
[34:33] Says, "Oh, isn't it beautiful to know
[34:34] that we are ambassadors? We are angels,
[34:36] the messengers of the resurrection. Who
[34:39] is that today? I don't say this
[34:41] disrespectfully, but don't just try to
[34:43] put on the character of brother Brandham
[34:44] and wear the replica belt buckle and hat
[34:46] and carry the briefcase and put on a
[34:49] dead messengers's uniform and try to
[34:51] pretend to be an envoy of the message.
[34:55] You now have to be a messenger of the
[34:57] resurrection. We are God's messengers to
[34:59] the sinful world that Christ lives. What
[35:02] world? The world that's lying in
[35:03] wickedness. We are of God and the whole
[35:05] world lies in wickedness. And you are
[35:06] the ones that know that the son of God
[35:08] has come and has given you an
[35:09] understanding that you may know him that
[35:11] is real and you are in him that is real.
[35:13] You know Jesus Christ and you know the
[35:15] true God and you have eternal life and
[35:17] the whole world is wanting and lacking.
[35:20] And you're to be the messenger of that
[35:22] messengers to a sinful world that Christ
[35:24] lives in our hearts. He lives in our
[35:26] spirit. He lives and he brings us from
[35:28] the low debauch life of sin and exalts
[35:31] us and gives us a hallelujah in our soul
[35:34] and makes us new creatures. We are
[35:36] messengers, angels of the covenant.
[35:40] That's what you're to
[35:41] be. This is the reality that you're to
[35:44] testify of. And so he says, you are of
[35:46] God. If I could just say, put us all in
[35:48] this. We are of God. We are not of this
[35:50] world, but the whole world's lying in
[35:52] wickedness. So he says, keep yourselves
[35:54] from idols. The word there is apparition
[35:57] or spectre. Keep yourselves from
[36:00] phantoms of the mind.
[36:02] Keep yourselves from imaginary gods.
[36:04] Keep yourselves from an image of a false
[36:06] god. We might think that an idol is
[36:08] something that is crafted out of gold or
[36:11] silver that ones would kneel to in
[36:13] worship. But it also speaks of these
[36:14] vain things and these imaginations in
[36:16] our minds that we as Christians must be
[36:19] genuine. It must be real. And we've got
[36:21] to be our real selves.
[36:25] keep ourselves from vain imaginations.
[36:27] Keep yourselves from idolatry and idols
[36:30] because it's going to undermine what
[36:32] you're witnessing of.
[36:34] There is a genuine reality that you can
[36:36] testify to. If I could say this, try to
[36:39] encourage you to be the best witnesses
[36:41] you can. And I'm not even talking about
[36:42] using your words, but being the best
[36:44] witnesses you can. If you could be
[36:46] convinced that what you're representing
[36:48] and what you've experienced is real,
[36:50] then you could have confidence and
[36:51] believe in your heart, Lord, let the
[36:54] supernatural be impressed upon someone
[36:57] that I can convey through my character
[36:59] and my attitude that there's something
[37:00] greater than the paycheck. There's
[37:02] something greater than economics,
[37:03] there's something greater than the pain,
[37:05] that there's a real living God
[37:08] and a reality beyond this one. And I'm
[37:10] convinced of it. So, I'm not afraid of
[37:12] death. I'm not afraid of man. I don't
[37:14] live solely within this realm of
[37:16] humanity and I'm not trusted in human
[37:18] testimony because I having been sent by
[37:20] Christ. He is going to back up what I
[37:23] say the same way the same way that God
[37:26] backed the son up.
[37:30] My life he's going to stand behind
[37:33] me. It's a different reality. We are
[37:35] messengers of the covenant. So let's
[37:38] keep ourselves from idolatry phantoms of
[37:40] the mind. Acts chapter 17 28 and 29 to
[37:45] these are two verses that are so rich,
[37:47] so heavy to really lift. It'd be good
[37:49] exercise to lift these on a regular
[37:50] basis. For in him we live and move and
[37:53] have our being. This is our reality.
[37:55] This is where we have our motion. This
[37:57] is where we have our existence. This is
[37:58] where our origin is. This is where our
[38:00] continuence is. This is where our
[38:01] destiny is in him. We live, we move, and
[38:03] we're going to have our existence, our
[38:05] full
[38:05] being. Then he appeals to their pop
[38:08] culture. There are poets are certain
[38:10] also your own poets have said for we are
[38:13] also his
[38:15] offspring. Verse 29 is saying then if
[38:17] that's true if that's true then as we
[38:20] are the offspring of God we ought not to
[38:23] think imagine portray that God is like
[38:27] unto gold or silver or
[38:29] stone. He's not human in that way. He's
[38:32] not contrived by man. He's not made up.
[38:36] Graven by art and man's
[38:40] devices. There's a difference between
[38:42] the reality of God and man's
[38:45] perception. We ought to think or imagine
[38:48] God to be the same as somebody else's
[38:50] idol or the same as something that's
[38:52] been fabricated by man, made by the
[38:53] skill of man, or existing only in man's
[38:56] devices only in our imagination.
[39:02] There's a lot that you can do when
[39:04] you're convinced that it's true from a
[39:08] human perspective just from carnal you
[39:11] believe you can do it. And there's been
[39:13] people there's been evidence of people
[39:15] who've been told well do this and do
[39:17] that and this is going to be the
[39:18] outcome. And so someone just thinks well
[39:19] that's just what they do and they try to
[39:21] do it and it's like oh my goodness why
[39:22] did you do that? Well you said if I did
[39:23] this this is what happened. Did it work?
[39:25] Yeah. Why? Because they believed it was
[39:27] so and they could do it. And there's a
[39:30] there's a check here to where we say,
[39:31] "No, this isn't just human put yourself,
[39:34] you know, everything you can into it.
[39:35] You can accomplish whatever you want and
[39:37] all things are possible if you just try
[39:39] hard enough and put in 10,000 hours."
[39:41] No, that is not what godhood is like.
[39:46] If we are his offspring, then there's a
[39:48] reality different than the one that man
[39:50] perceives.
[39:53] Brother Elliot, I can think you can see
[39:54] that analogy of the cave in that. We've
[39:57] been talking about some of these
[39:58] philosophers and their perception of
[40:01] reality and how things are and how, you
[40:03] know, the allegory of the cave that you
[40:05] just you just lived in a cave and fire
[40:07] was on the other side of a curtain. All
[40:09] you saw were shadows being projected by
[40:11] man-made light. To you, whatever you're
[40:12] perceiving, that's all there is. But
[40:15] when one leaves the cave and they're in
[40:17] the sunlight, that's that's real living.
[40:20] That's the real thing. And even that is
[40:23] just an analogy of really Christ being
[40:25] made real. How when we're in the world,
[40:28] the whole world lith in wickedness. What
[40:30] are they? They're only viewing man-made
[40:32] things. They're only viewing humanity.
[40:34] They think like humans. And what we have
[40:36] experienced by the grace of God is
[40:38] something beyond that, something real
[40:40] and genuine. And therefore, we should
[40:42] have a heart for those who are still
[40:44] stuck in wickedness and darkness, who
[40:47] are groping at the shadows and the
[40:48] things that man contrive. So, we must be
[40:51] convinced that what we've seen and what
[40:52] we've heard and what we've known and
[40:54] what we've experienced is beyond the
[40:56] shadows, beyond the wickedness,
[40:59] that you are light in the world so that
[41:01] others could come to know and exit the
[41:03] cave as it were and come to live in the
[41:06] sun, the sen light.
[41:11] Matthew chapter 16, Jesus is saying,
[41:12] "Who do men say that I am?" Oh, you're
[41:14] this, you're that. And says Peter, but
[41:16] who do you say that I am? And Peter
[41:18] said, ' Thou art the Christ, the son of
[41:20] the living God.' And Jesus saying, "Now
[41:21] this is flesh and blood has not revealed
[41:23] this to you, but my father which is in
[41:25] heaven hath revealed this to you."
[41:27] There's the there's the kicker, right?
[41:29] That you you couldn't learn this
[41:32] humanly, but the father has given you
[41:36] understanding. And he says this in verse
[41:38] 19, "And I will give unto you the keys
[41:40] of the kingdom of heaven." Keys in this
[41:44] word, it denotes authority or power. I'm
[41:46] going to give you the keys of the
[41:47] kingdom of heaven. And whatsoever thou
[41:50] shalt bind on earth shall be bound in
[41:52] heaven. And whatsoever thou shalt loose
[41:54] on earth shall be loosed in heaven. One
[41:57] translation renders it that whatsoever
[41:59] thou shalt bind on earth shall have
[42:01] already been bound in heaven. Very
[42:04] interesting way of putting it.
[42:05] Whatsoever you loose on earth shall have
[42:07] already been loosed in
[42:09] heaven. Because what is it reflecting?
[42:12] Something that it already is. Right?
[42:15] Something that is real. God's thoughts
[42:18] are real. They are eternal. So the new
[42:20] birth, as we could take from some of
[42:21] these other scriptures, we're just
[42:22] coming to a close. It empowers you. It
[42:24] endus
[42:26] you as a believer to be an ambassador
[42:29] from
[42:31] heaven. So you stand between divine
[42:34] reality and human
[42:37] perception. Just as Christ came and
[42:39] says, "I'm from my father which is in
[42:40] heaven." And like before me, before
[42:42] Abraham was, I am. What in the world? We
[42:46] know who your dad is. You being a man
[42:49] not over 50 and you say before Abraham
[42:51] was, I am. And seriously, but in
[42:54] reality, he's standing there saying,
[42:55] "No, I'm bridging between two different
[42:58] realities."
[43:00] And no, I'm going to give you the keys
[43:02] of the kingdom of heaven. And whatever
[43:05] you bind on earth shall be bound in
[43:06] heaven. Whatever you loose on earth will
[43:07] be loose to heaven. You're going to
[43:09] stand between between this divine
[43:11] reality and human perception. You're
[43:12] going to stand between, just think of
[43:14] this. You're going to be a veil between
[43:16] heaven and earth.
[43:18] And as we used before last year, I think
[43:20] it was gates of heaven. You're going to
[43:22] stand there as one who knows you've got
[43:24] heaven behind you. You're going to stand
[43:26] there knowing that within you is
[43:28] something real and something eternal.
[43:30] And so, you don't just stand there with
[43:31] a human mind and a human intellect and
[43:33] you're but yet you want to be able to
[43:35] convey those things that are divine that
[43:37] are only known by his nature and spirit.
[43:39] You want to somehow be able to stand
[43:41] there as an emissary, as someone that
[43:43] stands
[43:45] between heaven and earth is remember
[43:48] heaven consists of the word which is now
[43:52] a reality in you, right?
[43:55] Luke 17 20 and 21. And when he was
[43:58] demanded of the Pharisees when the
[43:59] kingdom of God should come, he answered
[44:01] and said unto them, answered them and
[44:03] said, "The kingdom of God cometh not
[44:05] with observation. God's kingdom is not
[44:08] something that you're going to contrive
[44:10] mentally or work up. That's why Peter
[44:13] says we haven't followed cunningly
[44:14] devised fables. What does it mean to be
[44:17] cunningly devised? It's well thought
[44:18] out. Can sound convincing. You can spin
[44:22] a narrative in a yarn, right? You can
[44:24] just be you can invent all sorts of
[44:27] invectives and experiences and put them
[44:29] in a book and get millions and millions
[44:31] of followers.
[44:36] Kingdom of God comes not with
[44:37] observation. Neither shall they say low
[44:39] here or low there. For behold, the
[44:42] kingdom of God is within
[44:45] you. Again, it's drawing that line
[44:48] between human experience and human
[44:50] perception and how the kingdom of God is
[44:53] within you. Christ is your reality. To
[44:57] you, he's been made
[44:59] real, but yet not made real to the lost.
[45:03] The gospel be hid if hid to them that
[45:04] are lost.
[45:06] So now the gospel Christ who's been made
[45:09] real to you is to be made real in
[45:12] you. Jesus knew who the father was.
[45:16] Convinced then concerned. He knew where
[45:18] he came from. He knew where he was going
[45:20] in the in between. He had to be faithful
[45:22] to the father that sent him.
[45:25] Brother Brandham in the sermon adoption
[45:27] part one says then if God hath sent us
[45:29] to be his ambassadors all power that is
[45:32] in heaven all that God is all of his
[45:34] angels and all of his power stands
[45:36] behind our words if we are correctly and
[45:39] ordained sent messenger to the people.
[45:43] God has set you and placed you in the
[45:45] church and your experience to be a one
[45:48] who testifies of the gospel. Not
[45:51] necessarily a pulpit ministry, not even
[45:52] so much using your words, but in
[45:54] whatever means by which he can have
[45:56] preeminence in your life. You are to be
[45:59] an ambassador of God and you stand
[46:02] frontf facing. You face the world front
[46:04] face and you're facing the same things
[46:06] Jesus did where he said, "Well, you
[46:08] can't testify of yourself and you can't
[46:09] be a singular witness." But he says,
[46:10] "Well, I can because I know my father."
[46:14] So though we may be front-facing the
[46:16] world, all of heaven is behind us.
[46:18] though we might we're putting our face
[46:20] forward and we're going forward and
[46:21] we're working through this world. We
[46:22] know beyond this one is an eternal
[46:24] kingdom. We know beyond this one we're
[46:26] going to meet the Lord in the air. We
[46:27] know where we're going. We're certain of
[46:29] that. So as we face the world and we're
[46:31] frontf facing the world and we rub
[46:32] shoulders with the world. All of heaven
[46:34] is behind you.
[46:36] You know where you come from. You are a
[46:39] messenger to the people. Right.
[46:44] In closing, we use this scripture in
[46:46] John chapter 4
[46:48] 23. What a this even in John chapter 4.
[46:52] What a beautiful example of what it
[46:54] means to be a witness. Christ is
[46:55] standing there in thestead of God. He's
[46:58] representing the father and what
[46:59] happens. I want you to think about this
[47:00] in terms of witnessing because we we
[47:03] we've been talking about real and
[47:04] there's a lot there that we could chew
[47:06] on in this. But then there's also
[47:07] something that's
[47:09] relatable. And then and it also has to
[47:11] be you want to be
[47:13] relevant. I mean I mean we could be
[47:15] really really
[47:17] sincere and we can put our sincerity in
[47:19] terms that people can relate to. But if
[47:21] we're trying to get everybody to build
[47:22] an
[47:23] ark or rub a gravestone in
[47:27] Jeffersonville, that's not really
[47:30] relevant. But here Christ comes as the
[47:34] one she's looking for. Oh, we know when
[47:36] Messiah comes, I'm he. She goes and
[47:38] she's a witness. She runs into the city
[47:41] and she says, "Come see a man who's told
[47:43] me things that nobody else would know."
[47:47] And the whole city came out to see him.
[47:49] That that that's a good example of of
[47:51] being a witness. This even that
[47:53] exchange, very good example of what it
[47:55] means to be a witness. And he says, '
[47:57] But the hour cometh, and now is this
[47:59] phrase here, when the true worshippers,
[48:01] the real worshippers shall worship the
[48:04] father in spirit and in
[48:07] truth. For the father seeketh such to
[48:09] worship
[48:11] him. Really, at the end of the day,
[48:13] that's what you need,
[48:14] right? You need the spirit in you,
[48:17] living in you, and the
[48:19] truth. I say, if you only had two
[48:23] things, that's all you need. spirit and
[48:26] truth. His spirit living inside of you
[48:29] and a truth that's ever unfolding. Do
[48:32] you realize with that with his spirit
[48:34] and truth you you'll never have lack for
[48:41] anything. Only if you stand in the
[48:46] way, the real worshippers, the true
[48:49] worshippers. the Mike if you could come
[48:52] brothers to your instruments maybe we
[48:53] could sing that chorus as as one of a
[48:56] worship song let the worshippers arise
[48:57] the real ones the true ones of studying
[49:00] even this word worshipper and it speaks
[49:02] of of kissing the hand of the Lord and
[49:05] worshiping him and you know paying this
[49:06] honor and respect but do we not do that
[49:09] through the lives we live isn't true
[49:12] worship going to be expressed of the
[49:14] fragrance of your life I I like that
[49:17] song it was written I think it might be
[49:19] casting crowns. Is it okay to say that
[49:21] band? I didn't say counting crows. I
[49:23] said casting crowns. But let my life
[49:25] song sing to
[49:27] you. Let let my let it not just be in
[49:30] times like this. Right? As brother
[49:32] Josiah says, I want altars over stages.
[49:35] I don't want to be bright lights and
[49:36] music and a stage show. I I want it
[49:39] something sincere from my heart.
[49:43] And brother Bam says in question and
[49:45] answers on Hebrews part
[49:50] three. Listen, he says, "Oh, if the
[49:53] great holy church only realized its
[49:56] power to do these
[49:58] [Music]
[49:59] things, but there's so much doubt and
[50:02] fear and
[50:02] [Music]
[50:07] trembling. Don't you think it's true?
[50:10] Don't we don't we struggle sometimes
[50:11] with doubt? Oh, I'm sorry. This is
[50:13] Wednesday night. Excuse
[50:15] me. We'll save that for
[50:18] Sunday. There's so much doubt, fear, and
[50:21] trembling, wondering if it will could it
[50:24] happen? He says, as long as that exists,
[50:26] the church can never stand
[50:29] [Music]
[50:30] upright. And when every talk of fear is
[50:32] vanished and the Holy Spirit's
[50:34] completely in control of the church,
[50:35] then all fear is gone and that church
[50:37] has power.
[50:38] [Music]
[50:40] You see, brother Alfonso, where the
[50:42] devil would want to use this cause you
[50:43] to fear.
[50:45] [Music]
[50:47] He says, "Why? They have everything that
[50:49] heaven owns behind them.
[50:52] You're going to face the world tomorrow.
[50:53] You're going to do it. You're going to
[50:54] face your boss. You're going to face
[50:55] work. You're going to face troubles.
[50:56] You're going to face trials. You're
[50:57] going to face the critic, the
[50:59] skeptic, right? You're going to face the
[51:02] reality that the government's been lying
[51:05] to you for years because your former
[51:06] president had cancer.
[51:10] Can you believe it? The world's falling
[51:13] apart. And now there's a Chicago style
[51:17] pope. But you're going to have to face
[51:20] it. Face everything. But everything that
[51:22] heaven owns is behind you. Don't worry
[51:25] about what you face. Heaven's behind
[51:27] you. Don't worry about what you're going
[51:29] to be going through. Heaven's behind
[51:31] you. They are ambassadors of the throne.
[51:34] Absolutely. An ambassador of Christ has
[51:37] the authority and everything that Christ
[51:39] owns belongs to that
[51:42] ambassador. Hallelujah. This is what it
[51:44] means to be a joint heir. And he said,
[51:46] "Go you into all the world. You are my
[51:48] witnesses after the Holy Ghost has come
[51:50] on you." And what is a witness? It is an
[51:54] ambassador to come and witness
[51:57] something. The whole power of heaven is
[52:00] right in your
[52:01] hands. Listen. shake yourselves and wake
[52:04] yourselves up. Th this is why I think
[52:06] the the language of the third pull is so
[52:08] beautiful. This isn't a stage show. You
[52:11] know, I sit there going, "Oh man, I
[52:13] really wish I could preach a meeting and
[52:14] I could get up there and I could form
[52:15] the the the preacher tunnel for everyone
[52:18] to walk through. I wish I could do a
[52:19] miracle line." It's so far removed from
[52:23] that. That that's not where it exists.
[52:25] And we're all just kind of emptying out
[52:26] our buckets so the the big names can get
[52:28] up there and pray for people. No. All of
[52:30] heaven's behind you. All of heaven's
[52:33] behind the housewife. All of heaven's
[52:35] behind that homeschool teacher. All of
[52:37] heaven is behind you. Why? Because he's
[52:39] placed his Holy Spirit in you for you to
[52:42] be a witness.
[52:47] To come and witness something that you
[52:49] know is real and
[52:51] true. The whole power of heaven. You
[52:53] ought to believe this with everything
[52:54] that's in you. The entirety of heaven's
[52:57] power is in your hands.
[53:02] It's in your
[53:03] [Music]
[53:05] hands. He says it at different places.
[53:07] If we could just be that correctly
[53:09] ordained place. Just stay in your
[53:11] position. Stay in your lane. This isn't
[53:14] for you. This isn't to prop yourself up.
[53:16] Christ could have he came and he wasn't
[53:18] he wasn't just spouting himself off. He
[53:20] wasn't just trying to give this pretense
[53:21] that he was somebody. He still
[53:22] acknowledged the father and we come in
[53:26] his name and we'll be faithful to it. We
[53:29] are his ambassadors. We're not even
[53:30] we're not even representing the bride.
[53:32] Oh, we're bride. We're we're the bride
[53:33] of Christ. It's
[53:36] Christ. God, help us to be an ambassador
[53:40] who
[53:41] knows all of heaven is in our hands.
[53:44] Let's stand tonight. Let's bow our heads
[53:47] in a word of prayer. If you need prayer
[53:49] tonight, just lift your hand up before
[53:51] the
[53:53] [Music]
[53:55] Lord. Our gracious heavenly father,
[53:58] tonight through this short service we
[54:01] had a very singular
[54:03] focus to speak of your
[54:05] reality and how that when we were
[54:08] debauched in sinful living, we knew not
[54:10] that
[54:12] reality. We heard about it. Maybe there
[54:14] was moments where we might have felt
[54:17] something beyond ourselves. But to say
[54:19] that we
[54:20] knew, we couldn't say so, Lord.
[54:24] But when you reach down your hands for
[54:26] to us, Lord, and you reached to pick us
[54:28] up out of that mire and that muck,
[54:30] you've brought us into a light and an
[54:33] existence which is beyond this one that
[54:36] we know apart from human
[54:38] senses. It's not that we've tasted it or
[54:41] heard it or seen it physically. It's not
[54:43] even that we've imagined it or feel it
[54:45] emotionally, but it's real in our souls.
[54:49] And we know that you are alive. And not
[54:52] that just you're alive and there's
[54:53] something supernatural beyond
[54:55] humanity, but that deity lives in
[54:58] us. And as you sent your
[55:03] son to declare your heart and to declare
[55:07] your
[55:08] character, we know that we are likewise
[55:11] now sent as ambassadors of Christ, his
[55:17] representatives. Lord, may it become a
[55:19] greater reality. We need it for our own
[55:21] sakes, but also Lord, for
[55:24] others so that others could come to your
[55:27] light. And all
[55:29] heaven, all powers of heaven are in our
[55:33] hand because everything you own and all
[55:35] of heaven is behind us. We're compassed
[55:38] about with so many great a cloud of
[55:40] witnesses that have gone before us,
[55:42] who've stood with all of heaven behind
[55:43] them. And we know that when we're in
[55:45] your will, you'll fight this
[55:48] battle. that you'll back up what you
[55:51] said. Lord, I believe that's at the
[55:53] heart of what Jesus was expressing in
[55:55] John chapter 5 is I'm not just saying my
[55:58] own things. I'm not just writing my own
[56:00] lyrics. L this is you, the father, that
[56:03] gave it to him. So, he knew that he
[56:05] wasn't judging humanly. He wasn't
[56:07] judging after human tenementss and human
[56:09] thoughts, but he he had your mind to
[56:11] know what you want it done. He was
[56:13] catching revelation. He was feeding on
[56:15] that. So, it was from you, Lord. Let us
[56:18] likewise be very faithful to your word
[56:21] to have your mind to know what you want
[56:22] done with the word. Bless us tonight as
[56:25] we consecrate ourselves to you. We want
[56:27] this to be a reality as husbands, as
[56:30] fathers, as
[56:31] brothers. Lord, I know for me as I think
[56:34] of these things as a man, I I want to be
[56:36] the right kind of father to teenage
[56:38] boys. I want to be the right kind of
[56:40] father to a teenage girl.
[56:43] I want to have that kind of backbone and
[56:45] character for my children and also to be
[56:47] the right kind of witness for my wife. I
[56:49] want to be a leader in the home in the
[56:51] right
[56:51] way. Lord, I want to have that just as
[56:54] brother Brandham used the example of a
[56:56] spy or a fake American. Lord, I want to
[56:59] have the genuine article of a godly man
[57:01] and a Christian in my life. Maybe it'll
[57:04] be so salty other people get
[57:06] thirsty. Lord, I would want I want to
[57:08] lead a soul to you, Father.
[57:11] I want to see converts to this great
[57:15] light. Help us to be true witnesses. I
[57:18] pray in the name of the Lord Jesus
[57:19] Christ.
[57:20] Amen.
