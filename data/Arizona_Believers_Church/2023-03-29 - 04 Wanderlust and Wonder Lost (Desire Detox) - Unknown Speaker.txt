TRANSCRIPT
========================================
as I mentioned we're touching on again the subject of Wonder lust and wonder loss and I'll just revisit this slide on kids eat free I'm using this tonight this uh kind of in a segment of kids eat free because some of the things we're talking about tonight are very directed to parents for the benefit of our children and I think even our children could find that the things that are expressed tonight will be an advantage to them of some principles that they could pick up early on and my title specifically for tonight is desired detox and this will become clear to you as we go forward a desired detox and if we don't have time to finish tonight I feel comfortable just picking back up on Sunday morning and so just trust that you'll help me as we go forward in this if you want to jot that down for an overall theme tonight desire detox and brother John actually once once I get to the next scripture you could just take over from here I think it'll be self-explanatory but if I need to grab the will you're the captain and as a co-captain I'll just take over if I need to on the slides but I'll let you take it from there that I want to revisit uh coming back to life which we spoke on Sunday so as we're looking at Wonder lust and wonder loss uh there might be lost there might be some things that seem a little bit strange to those who haven't heard any of these Services yet but we're looking at finding rediscovering or discovering maybe For the First Time The Wonder of Christ in an age that is possessed with wonderlust and that wonderlust is that aimlessness that just desire uh to be driven by emotions and feelings without any real aim and coming back to life we were looking at how that the hope of real living and if we're really going to be living it's only found in Jesus Christ to have life to have reality to have things that are of substance uh it's only in Christ that we find that so coming back to life involved the theme of Hope and how that's where we find the real living and how that wonderlust it just leads to synthetic experiences it leads to things that have an illusion of fun or have the illusion of enjoyment but actually aren't enjoyment and we're touching on how all the available media that we have and the technology and the entertainment kind of creates that addiction to wonder after desire that's kind of the idea of wonderlust that I have this want I have this desire and I'm wondering after it I'm chasing after I'm trying to scratch a niche I'm trying to be satisfied and one thing that it's important to think about is these things that we enjoy so often whether it be our iPads our cell phones and the apps and social media these things have given us the illusion of control and that we think we're in control we think we're leading things but the illusion of control is the product of cleverly designed systems and they're designed to give you the sense that I can control this at any time I'm the one that determines my destiny I'm the one that's in control of it but actually they're giving you the illusion of control and that illusion of the control is very important for a human they need to know that they're in control and in order to control you they give you the illusion that you're in control you'll find that even some elevator buttons don't ever don't actually work but they're just there so you have the illusion that you're closing the door and the person that's walking down the hallway right and there's a there's a there's a button there telling you that it's going to turn the stop sign to a walk sign and it doesn't work at all it's on a timer but it's given there to satiate your desire to be in control and give you the illusion that you have you have power over something and so when we mentioned that and this theme of coming back to life I'm wanting you to think about influence and Ponder influence and the influence of things and we read this statement at the very I believe it was in the very first service uh to allude to the fact that we as human beings are made to be led by something and we might feel that I have a choice I have to say I have control there's a whole branch of the study of human behavior that says that we actually it's the illusion of choice that you haven't chosen anything your favorite color is the outcome of certain influences in your life where you wanted to go to school you didn't choose it it was already kind of determined by people in your life and things that are happening and so I want to just touch on how we are we are made to be led and brother Brahm says we have to be led he says God likened us unto sheep did you know a sheep can't lead itself so whether we think so or not something is leading us is the point I want to remember remind you of he'll wonder and stray away he just can't lead himself he has to have someone lead him the shepherd is supposed to lead the Sheep now that was back in the days of the Lord Jesus he was the Good Shepherd that led the Sheep but today we're living in another day everything has changed and perverted and he touches on the wrong leader and how the goat is leading sheep to slaughter and how the Sheep need to be led so something that'll lead them they'll just follow it without a leader they just wander off and so there's if I can say this you're you're made to be led but because you're made to be led you're susceptible to the wrong leadership because you want that you want headship you want you want someone to help you and to lead you and be a provider for you so you kind of you'll even give in to forces unknowingly that are leading you but it's the wrong kind of leadership he talks about how the wrong leader leads to death he says but Jesus he led them to life and held their hand and so he's the one that leads us to life it come unto me all ye who are burdened and heavy laden with all the things that encumbers come unto him and he'll give us rest to our souls he says but someone has to lead the Sheep so we're made to be led and so when we think that oh I'm in control of my own destiny and I'm making choices and these things don't control me I can put it up whenever I want to it's good to think about well what is leading you because we're made to be led now in James chapter 1 verses 14 and 15. again we're just reviewing some of these things on coming back to life it says but every man is tempted his character is tested when he is drawn away of his own lust his own wants and desires and enticed then when lust hath conceived to bringeth forth sin and sin when it is finished bringeth forth death so there's the outcome of the process that we are our character is going to be tested when of our own desires we're drawn away by your own want you're drawn away and enticed and you're kind of caught and trapped and so that was an important distinction I believe for us to look at how that it's our own lust our own desires that draw us away from Christ and that it's in our own want being excited something influences you to want something and when you allow that to draw you away that's when you do and do and say things that lead to death that lead to not living if I could put it that way it was how we were looking at it and we cannot find real living in just trying to satisfy the desires of our flesh and that that want that's coming back to that want every man is tempted when he's drawn away of his own want his own desires and they I guess this kind of pulls me into the greater thought on Sunday how the things that kind of drive us and the things that we want to do doesn't necessarily mean we like to do them there's just a part of us that wants to do it so desire and want is different from love and light it's different from Love and Happiness and enjoyment so we can be driven a compulsion to do things that we actually don't even love driven to do things that actually don't even bring us happiness and so there's a desire want versus love and in some ways I thought of this that some of us are trying to love the things we want that's what we're trying to do we're trying to love the things we want because we're trying to find a deeper connection with these things that we feel a compulsion for we're trying to find deeper meaning in these things we want to do but you're not going to find love there and so it's that that wrestling and that desire of wants and lust and and things that you want to have that aren't necessarily the same as what you like and what you enjoy and in second Corinthians chapter 2 verse 11 it says lest Satan should get an advantage of us for we and I we are not ignorant of his devices now that is you know he's using it in in the context but I believe the larger narrative to the Corinthians but he's saying that we do not let Satan Swindle us or defraud us or deceive us because we're aware of his tricks so he's saying he's teaching them to do something he says because if we don't since we're aware of his devices we're aware of how he tries to take advantage of us and since we're knowledgeable of us we don't let him defraud us so it's important for us even in this context of not letting Satan get advantage of us that we're aware of the devices they're stimulating our flesh uh and those desires to be entertained to be satiated to be satisfied and these are just some things about coming back to life these things we're feeding on our promoting death and Corruption and depression and anxiety and we'll we'll expound upon that more this evening but it's recognizing how there's things that are going to be offered to us that kind of excite our flesh and the flesh tends to addiction the flesh likes some repetitive behavior and doing things over and over again and we need we're just wanting to recognize those different things so uh I think this is I just want to continue on this coming back to life a little bit but take we're taking another step in this those all that was kind of just review so I trust that we're all on the same page now we use the phrase coming back to life to speak about sobering up and and kind of not being influenced by the things of this world sober from the intoxication of technology and media and I know that we've all experienced this on some level if you're if you don't that's not quite come into your mind uh just ask yourself the next time you watch something or hear something or see something how it makes you feel and you'll find that when you watch the movie about mountain climbers you wanted to go climb a mountain when you watched a movie about a road trip you wanted to go on a road trip you find you're being influenced by these things and so there's a an intoxication that's coming from all the media conception all the technology we engage in and the coming back to life is about renewing hope and about finding Wonder In Christ and not just in devices and Technology but finding this Wonder In The Wonder of Christ and I hope that you can recall all the scriptures that told us ahead of time what human nature is like and the eye never being satisfied with seeing the ear never being full of hearing and how the word has warned us ahead of time of the things that are to come and it's told us ahead of time of how that human nature works and it always gives us the answer doesn't say hey man your belly's never going to be full your eyes always going to see your ear is always going to hear and you just have to kind of lean into this uh addiction and just suffer through it but it kind of gives us the answer and the answer is Christ and it gives us the answer and so now I'm going to use some details here at the beginning hopefully this kind of just wakes us up and gets our attention because it's coming back to life is touching on how things are robbing us of real living they did a study in 2019 of high school students uh who are the high school students here raise your hand if you're in high school raise them high okay well we just got a few a few high school students those of you who are coming to it this will be good for you to think about they did a study on high school students found a third of all high school students reported persistent feelings of sadness and hopelessness one-third 33 percent of high school students said they felt persistently uh feelings of sadness and hopelessness and I was like wow they feel like adults do but this is something that they're recognizing they're just coming to adulthood a lot quicker these days I guess but they had these feelings of sadness and hopelessness and it was up 40 percent from where it would been a decade before or so and so they're noticing this increase of hopelessness this increase of this persistent sadness and that was the third of all high school students and even more alarming 50 of all the girls said they felt it so I had one out of two whatever every girl is fills this persistent sadness feels a persistent hopelessness and at the same time in 2019 the American Medical Association found that the amount of screen time uh time spent on screens or social media and on these devices increa can increase depression can increase anxiety and so if they're just looking at a correlation they'll readily admit that but they're pondering the causation and how that as we've seen the increase of screen time the increase of social media interaction as the increase of all these things from the world they're noticing an increase in hopelessness an increase in sadness amongst young people and any study that you read in any any literature that you'll find on this academic study or journalism will tell you that technology has improved their lives in many ways and that technology performs many useful tasks but all technology has a downside and carries with it some adverse effects and two areas they're finding where these adverse effects are so prominent is how that we come to become dependent upon them we have this increased dependence on technology and media and then also there's this the phrase that uses upward social comparison so there's two ways that we're that life is becoming less real to us and it's we're becoming more dependent upon technology and the more that we're interacting on technology the more that we compare ourselves to other people and it's upward comparison because we think they're better than us this increased dependence arises from I was going to do a whole sermon on the algorithm and I thought well that might just be a little bit too scary uh to really dive into what the algorithm is but we have this increased dependence upon technology and it's the it comes from this the manipulative algorithm that's used on all the platforms that we engage in and The Addictive design of them they're all designed to be addictive I mean I may be enlightening some people to this and I'll say this to parents who just hand their kids devices and you don't know this you better listen closely because by Design the the the graphic interface that they're using is made the GUI is made to cause them to become addicted to it and and the interactions on it there's a manipulative algorithm that kind of keeps any information and communication technology kind of has it baked into it now keep them on it as long as you can use an algorithm to make them depend upon it and I found this phrase in one study in order to make money these platforms algorithms effectively function to keep users engaged in scrolling through content it's made that way to keep you engaged to keep you online to keep you using it and then they intermittently reward you with some stimulus a like a follow a notification points right a crate a chest you know something new a new skin they have different ways of giving you something and as they intermittently reward you with stimulus it causes you to keep being engaged with whatever it is you're doing it's designed that way it's designed to keep you coming back and they call it a pleasure Rush that you get this pleasure Rush even from a notification and and I imagine some of you tonight you're gonna check your smart watch something's going to vibrate something's going to Ding and it's going to cause this little ooh I wonder what it is right it's your car warranties expired or or your Amazon account has been locked right and a Nigerian prince has the new password and so there's this pleasure Rush whenever you get a notification there's this ooh I wonder what it can be and even this sense of this Wonder of when I open it up who's going to be texting me who's going to be liking me how many people have looked at my WhatsApp status today uh what are the comments what's the feedback this it's they're called a pleasure rush and this pleasure rush act activates the same processes in your brain they call them dopamine pathways the same the same processes that relate to our motivation that have to do with our our rewards and addictions all those things so these things are all related together in our thinking and as these areas that are of concern that are causing this increase in depression and anxiety among people uh these social comparisons are one thing that happens a lot when you're engaged in social media and every even if it's a game or an app there's always something you're comparing yourself to you're part of a clan you're part of a group you're part of some community and there's certain rankings and there's certain feedback and everything's social they do it for a reason to get you to engage they find that social rewards light up our reward system much more than non-social Rewards something that inspires us a lot more these social things and and they they with these social comparisons we're wired to compare we just can't help it we're always we're always going to be making comparison and what happens through our interactions on social media we're always comparing ourselves to somebody else and we have a tendency to think that what they're experiencing is better than what we're experiencing because we're kind of in the reality we know we know that this beautiful picture we just posted on Instagram of the cake we just made it doesn't taste good and it was a nightmare and it fell apart as soon as you took the picture but everybody else is like wow that cake looks great and you're looking at somebody else's cake and he's saying I imagine it tastes better than mine and they did it very easily and they're so good and we compare ourselves and it's kind of this upward social comparison and we feel inferior and we're worried about impa imperfections in our lives that if you really examine it by the light of God's word they don't even exist but in the light of the world and all the filters and the things the world wants to present we're beating ourselves up through all these things that we experience and you wonder no wonder there's so much anxiety no wonder there's so much depression they say that teens who grow up checking social media more often are becoming hypersensitive to feedback from their peers there there's this heightened sensitivity to social rewards feedback how am I being accepted am I being followed and and the the three areas of the brain that are most impacted by this is the reward processing part and the regions of the brand that determine what you think is important to salience like recognizing an environment what's important what's a danger uh what what stands out in an environment what do I need to be paying attention to our brains are being conditioned even that prefrontal cortex which has to do with controlling our Behavior it's all impacted by the time we spend in apps and games and social media and on this technology it's being proven how much it affect impacts the brain and this is a statement that when I went back and found the article that I had that I'd found this in there was just a phrase in that I really really like and wow it stunned me when they were talking about this old antique I think it was called Hamlet's BlackBerry if anybody knows what it is it's not a shake you can get it nectar it was a phone it was a device and this is what the author wrote Our tools are fertile they're constantly multiplying and this is true here several you know over a decade later the more connected we are the more we depend on the outside world the world outside of ourselves to tell us how to think and live right you cannot buy something on Amazon until you look at the reviews right and find out what all the what those Bots think about this product they've never used before and so we become more dependent upon the outside world it amazes me how often we regurgitate tweets oh can you believe it what happened and they said this that and the other like okay like who's the expert that said that like Nancy in Tennessee like oh oh Nancy yeah the little Bastion of Truth and discernment and we we regurgitate it and spit it out as if this person has the right take on what's Happening what does it mean we're more in tune with what the and even the new newscast now have the Twitter scroll right and you've tuned out the expert right you've turned out the tuned out the one who wrote the paper copy that has the facts right and you're wanting to know what Bubba Love has to say about it right because that's what we've been conditioned to think and to do in the age that we're living it says we depend upon what the outside world thinks and says we hear the voices of others and we are directed by those voices these voices are directing us and I'm telling you this is what's causing that wonderlust this wondering this aimless pointless behavior that is devalued Christ in our eyes when he's the true Wonder they say that an average person spends 145 minutes on social media per day the average person and some of you are thinking I ain't average I'm a lot more than that right the average person sends 145 minutes on social media per day I'd like to think some of us are bringing that number down right by our failing to interact on these things and the more the time that you spin on it takes a toll and wanting to recognize it takes a toll on her mental health takes a toll in our brain and the way our brain processes things it's shaping our desires it's shaping our wants and I'm using this all to point out the fact that there's things that you're wanting that aren't necessarily the things that you like or the things that you need or the things that you love or the things that bring you happiness but you have a compulsion to want them and we're trying to find out why have I lost my sensitivity to the spirit why am I not hungering for the things of God more why don't I find that church excites me why do I find that Christ isn't like all the words I sing of him the Wonder the all I need and all that I want it's not because he isn't all you need and all that you desire and all that you love it's all the other things that are dumbing it down and these things that we engage in it's impacting our quality of life and it's causing an increase in loneliness anxiety fear of missing out social comparison and depression these are all the things that it's giving rise to there's these things are so numerous in terms of what it's impacting so now let's look at desire detox now what I mean by this when I say desire detox is detoxifying our bodies from addictive and unhealthy toxins that's what a detox is we'll come back to maybe here in a moment but we're detoxing our minds our hearts our Spirits things that we find ourselves we have a compulsion to do what we want to do is detoxify our Spirits from these addictive and unhealthy toxins I call it a desire detox we're looking at Satan's devices worldly devices things that are intended to deceive or to trick us gimmicks that kind of hook us and entice us and as we read in Jeremiah the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know it this the addictions are deceptive the heart is deceitful Above All Things there's this false sense of fulfillment I want it but it's not bringing me fulfillment but I still want it it's those empty calories right and you can't you just keep eating it and you never feel full and you'll you can find yourself just keep eating that's the way the world is there's no satisfying substance in it and so I almost called it a deception detoxification but I realized this is pointing to desire we want we want we want and we want to consume it and we want to have it but it's never satisfying us so we need a desire detox a detoxification is a the action of depriving uh one of the deprivation of poisonous qualities a detoxification is the removal of addictive substances so if you're on a detox it's the process or period of time whether it be a process or just a period of time when one abstains from or rids the body of toxic things they do this when one is trying to recover from an addictive substance they they for a space of time they remove them from ingesting it on any level so that all traces of an addictive substance are removed from them so they can overcome their dependence on it this is what we would do this is what would be done and certain clinical settings when someone has a chemical addiction they they bring them into a place to where they can't ingest it in any way and let it get out of the system and they'll experience withdrawals and they'll experience a lot of painful things as a result of it but they're wanting to get the body to a place where it's no longer depending on it and it takes the detox to do that it's finding anything that's a toxin anything that's a poison anything that someone is addicted to or has a compulsion to and they remove it so they can overcome their dependence on it now let's look at the scripture in Psalms 139 together because this is this is where I want to make this relevant to us because it says search mail God you say oh detoxification that's for people addicted to pain pills that's for people who use drugs not so fast search me o God and know my heart try me and know my thoughts and see if there be any wicked way in me and Lead Me in the way Everlasting lead me into life lead me into abundance and so see if there be any wicked way in me now I know some of you are thinking Lord do I really want to rob a bank do I want to murder my neighbor and you're thinking in terms of Wicked Ways you kind of think on that level but here this Hebrew word Wicked just means a pain or a sorrow or Idol it speaks of a hardship and this what's at the root of it see if there be any wicked way in me way means manner of habit course or Direction manner of life or habit see if there'd be any manner of life or habit course or direction of my life see if there'd be any wicked way it means an object of pain or an object of offense see if there be any Habit in my life that causes me suffering see if there'd be any Habit in my life that causes me pain or hardship and this is an honesty don't just examine me to see if there's some sort of filthy vile thing it's even Lord see if there's some way in my life manner or habit or cause course of action in my life that is a burden to me and I don't know it because it's saying examine me it's not even offering up Lord deliver me from this habit of chewing my fingernails Lord deliver me from this habit of ingesting this no he says Lord search my heart because I know my heart is desperately wicked and there might be a useless way in me there might be an offensive way in me there might be some Habit in my life that I don't even realize is bringing me down the path of pain and I want you to deliver me from it so I can walk in the way Everlasting and I want and I could be very very specific tonight very very precise but I'm talking about a desired detox it's any want any desire that is toxic to us so we're using this scripture as kind of our main point tonight see if there be any way in me Lord examine my heart try me you know my heart you know my ways you know my thoughts see if there be any object of hardship or some offense in my in my manner or habit the Bible says in First Corinthians chapter 7 verse 31 these are these General Commandments that Paul is given he says and they that use this world is not abusing it for the fashion of this world passeth away let's talk about when it says not abusing it it's the overuse of it that's what the phrase means not abusing it the overuse or the excess of something so there's certain things that we may use but when it says it's not abusing it don't take your happiness from it Don't Take Your satisfaction from it don't take your fulfillment the full use of it that this to me is what is going to satisfy me because he says for the fashion of this world passeth away the way things are will change and anything you become dependent on anything that to you means something and it matters it's it's all transitory It's All Temporary what a warning to us that put stake our whole identity into something and said this is my living this is my life this is my reputation and they can shut the platform down overnight they could change the rules to the game these things could disappear it says these things are so change all the time so it says don't if you use the world don't get your happiness out of it don't get your identity out of it don't get you're full of it because it's just going to set you up for disappointment because it always changes you're finally able to afford those Yeezys and he comes out as a complete wacko right you think man I finally got a pair of Yeezys and now you find out the guy's certifiably insane why because the world just changes no offense Kanye just pay your ties you might remember that we touched us touched on this in the year in preview I think it was part four we touched on these things and we talked about how this Bible is saying that we that use this world are not abusing it and it's specifically talk about how things are designed to constantly get us to stimulate the pleasure center of our minds and that these games uh triggered these addictive responses these incentives lead to soft addictions we touched on all that the apps the games the movies the shows all these things the the narratives behind all these things it's all made to get us to abuse or overuse so they that use this world I want to say they that use any kind of Technology they that use any kind of entertainment they they those that gay engage in any kind of recreation let's not abuse it and it specifically means let's not overuse it so using but not abusing it's the overuse or excess of information and communication technology the overuse and excess of media the overuse and excess of entertainment and music and sports and all these things because the Bible's tell us it's those things that inflame desire so those things that that cause this greater passion and again this goes on any level I believe I just feel that we could just say it uh uh just without any reluctance or hesitation at all there's the eye and the ear they always want more you have a favorite team and you want them to win and when they win the championship you don't archive your jersey right yeah you don't say hey they made it they climbed to the top of the mountain they planted the flag it's over it's done let's move on to something else no you're thirsty for another one right you want to get all the commemorative memorabilia and you're already starting to watch out and see whether or not they can defend their title and you're trying to trademark three Pete and things like that why because you cannot be satisfied with what the world offers you by Design they never want you to stop being hungry so it inflames desire and overusing is a scripture word and they that use this world is not overusing it and overusing is a medical term overusing has been termed dependent syndrome to Define addiction and habituation the World Health Organization uses dependent syndrome to signify overuse we say overuse that means a habit an addiction and this overuse refers to a strong desire some sense of compulsion to where you can't you're not in control of your behavior anymore maybe it's a little bit controversial but they're finding that behavioral addictions are is a syndrome that's analogous to a substance abuse substance syndrome addiction but it's about your behavior and it's maybe an emerging field of study but they can diagnose you with the substance addiction but now they're realizing there's behavioral addictions and when the Bible and many of these behaviors we have can provide us with short-term rewards and because they provide us with that short-term reward it engenders persistent Behavior because there's a reward for it when you check when there's a reward for it when you play when there's a reward for it when you're interacting it causes to be more persistent in doing it and so the Bible's using this term and science is picking up on it this overusing points to a compulsion to an activity and this compulsion to an activity is maybe one that we're not even in control of anymore we think we are but we're not and just for the this is just the statistic I had here at this point they say the average adult checks their phone 110 times a day and I know what we're all thinking amateurs right they were like only 110 you need to get those numbers up you need a smart watch right you need to you need to put that that app on your home screen so you can check your numbers 110 times a day they do it that means once every 13 minutes they checked their phone and your phone will tell you now how many pickups you have what your screen time is and so adults are checking their phone 110 times a day once every 13 minutes but for most people it increases to every six seconds in the evening how many of you have checked your watch already tonight not to tell the time right how easy is it just to look just to check it's because there's this compulsion and the screen use is this exponentially more addictive and detrimental for children exponentially more addictive and detrimental to youth as a matter of fact the American Academy Academy of Pediatrics says zero screen time for children under two years old zero and strict controls for anyone older than that and think about how much unfettered access we give to PlayStation to Xbox to we to switch remember the sermon on restoring the switch in the home like that I alluded to I didn't actually preach it but they're the less the American Academy of Pediatrics get after me but they there is a this think about all the access they have to screens and the doctors that take care of your kids are saying if they're under two they shouldn't have it at all if they're older than until you better have strict controls on it and so there's it's becoming a pandemic it's becoming a pandemic not even epidemic this is not this is not just a first world problem anymore it's spreading it's spread all over the world where now there's this issue with young people and children finding themselves their minds are being shaped and their brains are being changed all by the way that they use these things the reward processing their their salience uh their their risk control all these things are being influenced by the screens that they're on and they're thinking how can we control our kids on screens how is it that we can help our children direct statement parents should reduce their own screen time they figure the best path to help our kids is to demonstrate to them by example and that if we're ever going to get our kids to reduce their own screen time we've got to reduce it ourselves the Bible says in Philippians chapter 4 verse 5 let your moderation be known unto all men the Lord is at hand why does it say the Lord is at hand the rewarder that's what he's referred to the judge the rewarder is at hand so you need to let your moderation be known unto all men because God is doing what rewarding you for your behavior not to determine salvation right this is rewards he says the the Lord is at hand he's going to judge your moderation moderation is translated to being gentle and patient the scripture patience is used gentle is used let your gentleness let your patience let your moderation be known unto all men moderation speaks of something that is suitable or fair or mild the the Greek root there is to yield your yieldiness and the thought that's being expressed in Philippians let your modesty be made known let your humility be made known and what it's referring to is that to all men let the sweetness of temper be made known in your whole Behavior this temperance it went to speak of being gentle and you look at the other scriptures your meekness under provocation and she said well brother Aaron it seems to me that it's telling me that if a fellow human being provokes me or somebody else tries to make me mad I can be harsh I can be judgmental I need to be patient I need to be I need to be gentle and that's part of it but moderation is being referred to is moderation and all behavior is the government of our passions it's a government of Desire and it's meekness under provocation let your moderation be known under the algorithm let your moderation be known unto all men and all things that are trying to provoke you provoke your passions influences you say well I think he's speaking about getting angry it's speaking about any desire curbing any desire let your moderation we use that to speak of something like not into excess and being too much but it does speak to this controlling our desires and controlling our passions Psalms 101 verse 3 says I will set no Wicked thing before mine eyes the wicked there again is not the things that we might normally tend to is of something perverted or naked or something nasty but it just means useless unprofitable he says I hate the work of them that turn aside from The Wonder of Christ the phrase turn aside is the ones that would turn from the truth turn from the law it says it shall not cleave to me which means to stay close by I think the writers propose in a detox I will set no useless unprofitable thing before mine eyes that doesn't necessarily mean the device itself or it within your vision but to set something before your eyes means I said it forth as an example to follow or something I approve of that I give it enough attention and I give it enough treatment and I give it enough place in my life to where it's not just something I use but now it's becoming something I abuse and I will set no useless unprofitable thing before me such that it is an example that I follow or something that I approve of he says I will not let it cleave to me in other words I am not going to let this inflame my heart it's not going to be something that I'm attached to something I'm tied to something that becomes my example something that I look for for approval and the wicked thing here extends to those things that are useless and unprofitable yet addicting and think about the example we set for our children in the things that we handle and touch and enjoy and listen to the most and what it signals to our children and now that they themselves are watching the useless unprofitable things that you've set before you and it becomes an example to them Ephesians chapter 5 verse 18 says and be not drunk with wine wherein is excess and then the contrast but be filled with the spirit be influenced by let it have premise let the spirit have preeminence be not drunk with wine where in his excess it means wasteful of prodigal do not be overly influenced by fleshly intoxicants I would say it it's precisely speaking of wine but it's pointing to anything that would inordinately intoxicate you as Paul says in First Corinthians 6 12 I would not be brought into the power of any anything can have a power to intoxicate us anything can become some compulsion and it's amazing the things that people find themselves compulsion to do and you think oh that's weird that's bizarre it's the human nature that they can be brought into the power of anything there's a power to yield to something to give in to I want you to think about this and Lord search my heart and find if there be any wicked way in me any habit any anything that I do in a regular course where there is not moderation where I am setting something useless before me that I seek my own approval in it or that I approve of that has become an example you know I've allowed anything to have power over me Lord anything wherein there is access Jesus says in Luke 21 verse 34 and take heed to yourselves lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with sir fitting and drunkenness and cares of this life is it just coincidence that surfing the web like searching surfing in here it's a way we could just kind of force that in there overcharge that's all we're worried about is how big how much our batteries are charged he says your heart's be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness and the cares of this life so that that day so that day come upon you unaware speaking of a a day that you ought to not be caught off guard by if you even dissect these scriptures the revealing of the son of man has lost its Wonder through Hearts being overcharged with surfeiting drunkenness and the cares of this life watch ye therefore in other words do not be snared take heed to yourselves be aware looking watch out for these things to be overcharged it means to be made heavy through excess the word there to be overcharged uh to be overcharged speaks of the idea of consuming so much it deadens your senses it kind of deadens your kind of dull to your rational senses surfeiting is a heaviness or a dizziness drunkenness means you're unable to think maturely you're unable to perceive or calculate and discern things maturely this is what the scripture is saying take heed to yourself listen any times your hearts become overcharged and your senses become dull through heaviness through drunkenness through the cares of this life it's an anxiety about temporal things it's an inordinate value given to temporal things something that you've placed way too much attention on or a value on be be aware of guard against if I can say this the destructive power of all these modern time wasters that we have that are empty that are vain in Romans chapter 13 verses 11 to 14. I I was gonna I preached this on a Wednesday night because I thought for sure all of our you know straight line Believers would be here tonight and you'd just be saying amen so much about for The Neighbor in the apartment next door and it just would have been like we just would have been shouting so much we'd have widened the aisles you know it just would have been a good old time I guess it's just sobering some of these things Romans chapter 13 verses 11 12 13-14 Romans 13 11. I think this just speaks directly to us in these things and that knowing the time that now is high time to wake out of sleep these things are causing us to be drunk loneliness to sleep or it's Doling our senses it's the surfing and the drunkenness the cares of this life are overcharging our heart and we become dull our other senses are becoming dull because we're more in tune to the notifications we're more in tune to what the world is saying we're more concerned about the Tweets we're more concerned about the algorithm we're more concerned about the content consumption right these things are what catching our attention and it's causing us to fall asleep so it says awake out of sleep for now is our Salvation near than when we believed the night is far spent the day is at hand let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of light it's maybe an Old English language to you maybe archaic and Antiquated but it's telling us to get away to get distance from the things that tend to the anxiety get distance from the things that dull us to sleep to get distance from the things that are synthetic and not real and to put on the armor of light and start living start doing things that are worth doing it says let us walk honestly as in the day not in rioting and drunkenness not in Chamberlain chambering and wantonness not in strife and envying it's speaking to these passions these desires I have this drunkenness this rioting this chambering this wantonness this stripe this Indian these are all these things that are stirred up assignment these are all Old English words for the things that you're wrestling with day by day as you engage in these platforms and consume content just another way of saying it it's the work of Darkness when we need to be dressing ourselves in the armor of light and it puts it so beautifully in verse 14. but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ and make not provision for the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof isn't it amazing how much provision we make for the flesh right to fulfill the lust thereof I'm trying to think of an example so I don't offend anybody here tonight it's amazing all the provision that will be made for a Thursday morning to be sure you make make it and nothing given to Wednesday night the extent to which we will make provision for the flesh the extent to which we will break our necks making sure we can get what we need for our flesh the desire the itch the scratch whether it be social interaction whether it be some Endeavor Recreation we'll do whatever we can to satisfy what our flesh needs but to fulfill the lust of the flesh but no provision to feed our spirit and I'll say this to those who are present here tonight you're making the right decision you may you may not be able to recognize it now but the benefit you get from taking your children from where they sit at home and driving whatever distance it is that you do to come here on a Wednesday night to sit in the atmosphere that you sit in and to hear the word and to worship will pay exponential dividends in your children's lives well beyond what you can get on the iPad the screen of the Stream I'm not downplaying the utility of streaming but if that's what God wanted us to do we'd all be there right now every single one of us we put all our money into having the right kind of bandwidth and that and we would be making sure that we could stream the best we can with all the pyrotechnics that we could but this is what God has ordained to make families healthy and strong make not provision for the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof this is a direct commandment to recognize desires that want to be fulfilled and say you know what I think I'm just going to starve you buddy I'm not going to make contingencies to have things so that I can continue to Satisfy My Flesh I'm going to recognize I'm going to wake up out of sleep I'm going to wake up out of the works of darkness I'm going to wake up out of the rioting and the drunkenness and the surfing and the overcharging and the and the anxieties by putting too much value on the things of this life I want to wake myself up to Hope I want to come back to life the Bible says in first Thessalonians 5 22 abstain from all appearance of evil speaking of keeping a safe distance from the for all forms of evil and I was just studying this scripture this week and getting into detail today and within the the framework of what Paul is encouraging them in it just almost hits you in your face that he's saying do not use the pretense of good to justify your your bad actions do not use the pretense of the good or usefulness of something to engage in an activity that tends to the flesh do not use the pretense of learning is he saying to Heap to yourself teachers that give you itching ears do not use any pretense of good or usefulness to engage in an activity that tends to something that's not useful we can say wickedness or evil here abstain from the appearance of evil God brings me back to all set no Wicked thing before me I want to achieve a safe distance from those things that are useless that can kind of get inside of me and cause me to start acting in ways that are habitual and have compulsion I want to recognize it I want to abstain from it I don't want to seek its approval no do I nor do I want to approve it I need to have healthy distance from all forms of evil I was reading this statement today where brother Madam tells this story and from that time he says the drunk I've met many of those that said brother Branham he says down the skid rows I think this is just so beautiful the way he uses it but I want you to think much deeper in terms of what your what Wicked way may be in you he says when I was in New York not long ago I won't have time to tell it but how did I picked up a drunk he was the president of a bank that I could look at from where he was because he's going from up from that time so one time he was the president of a bank he said I come home one night found a Dear John Letter I thought I would drink it away here I am he's a drunk on the street he says could you give me a quarter to get a drink he says there you are so think look at where it starts you know some is you're using something to kind of I just need a break right the job is stressful work is stressful life is stressful whatever it might be I just needed some release I need some sort of break and he said this is where it starts he says there you are they don't aim to do it they don't aim to become addicted they're not looking for some unhealthy compulsion the cigarette smoker that woman that smoked her first cigarette she didn't mean to become a tobacco worm that boy the first time you smoke that little corn silk cigarette whatever that is you didn't mean to become a cigarette fiend maybe in modern parlance you that picked up the Vape you didn't mean to become a vape fiend the first little social drink you took you didn't mean to become a drunkard see you don't mean to but it started because somebody influenced you to do it there's so many people after you said that's it all the stories of these 31 years around the world around and around hearing the confessions and things and to raise the hair on your head to think of the things that hear them confess of what they started how innocent it was and how beautiful sin looks and how attractive it looks to be but it's a way of death don't go at whatever you do shun the very appearance of evil now I know tonight if that's what I was harping on a cigarette use and alcohol abuse and social drinking and these things some of us might just breathe the sigh of relief but whoo I'm free from it but you know as the mental health toll has increased and as more young people feel a sense of hopelessness and feel a sense of dread or suffering from more anxiety that some drug use has declined uh you know sexual activity is declining but what is increasing is there dependency upon social media their interaction on these gaming platforms and it's causing greater and more is at least as much as destructive Behavior is all the things we might preach against if we were just wanting to clothesline just preach against cigarettes just preach against TV in the home just preach against rock stars and movie stars and preach against all The Usual Suspects and then just these other things just kind of slipping right on by I guess it'd be pretty hard to preach on these things if you use an iPad Pro for your notes an Apple Watch to keep track of the time and smart shoes to keep your feet from getting numb so what do I mean by desire detox I feel like I got at least 10 minutes I'm talking about experiencing real living lead me to the way Everlasting as almost put it we can experience real living when we free ourselves from toxic desires where we're no longer in bondage to the ones when we're no longer acting according to what we feel we think we need or what we want so what I'm proposing is a desired detoxification I've been thinking about these things person in my life I fellowship with some of you on this some of you shared with me some really tremendous examples of how the Lord has been dealing with you uh one one parent shared with me something that was just really really eye-opening and how that we're conditioning our children to when they need our attention whatever it is we're trying to finish is more important than what they're how they're trying to demand our attention because we're always in our screen for everything and it may be something useful but chances are it's probably not always useful but we use the useful moments as justification for all the wicked moments right they're useless the evil things that we we're not using this phrase of wow Wicked I I'm doing I'm doing something filthy and perverted on my phone no no you you've got an excuse for it but what's what message is it signaling and I'm proposing a desired detoxification I'm not suggesting a digital detoxification I'm not suggesting a detoxification from a cell phone but an examination of influence it's a desired detoxification it's it's detoxing our desires and maybe you desire a detox but it's taken intentional scriptural steps that's what it dawned on me today that the Bible is very plain in these things taking very intentional scriptural steps to Take Back Control of our minds Take Back Control of our bodies and our wants do we begin to recognize I'm being I have a compulsion to do something I have compulsion to check my phone once every six seconds in the evening I have a compulsion to check the status on this app I have a compulsion to check the news I have a compulsion to check the scores I have a compulsion to do to play this game I have a I'm set to a schedule where at this time I can always be found doing this and all my gaming buddies join me at the same time and I'm at the conference once a year and I'm doing the cosplay whenever I want and you can play the part in something that's not even real by your own want your own desire and there's a supernatural Christ who wants you to play his part by his own power we drag ourselves all over the place and let our wants drag us all over the place and we can take very deliberate scriptural steps to Take Back Control of our minds and our desires and our impulses Paul said in First Corinthians 9 27 but I keep under my body and bring it into subjection I know we've read this scripture quite a bit but he says I he's saying I make my desires my servants I don't let my desires make me the servant I keep under my body means I treat it harshly the phrase that's used as I beat it up and I make my body subject to me because my body my flesh my mind my desires are not my master that's what he's saying I keep under my body Paul is not saying you know ever since I became an apostle not one problem buddy right he's not saying it he recognizes that he in his body are desires wants and drive and he says I beat him down I bring him under subjection I'm I allow Christ in me to be the master of my wants and my desires if you say lest I when I've labored I do not receive a reward and so when I talk when I'm when I'm proposing a desire detox and I was very careful and I just tried to obey the Lord and with just exactly how I could present this because I'm proposing this to you and and you're the only one that can that can take steps uh to to the how you say Lord search my heart and see if there be any man or a habit in my life that's useless that's tending me to compulsion you're the ones that can examine yourselves and offer this up to the Lord one thing about accountability is it cannot be demanded it has to be voluntarily and willingly offered and so I'm not demanding accountability I don't need to have some sort of digital record you don't need to install uh you know the pastor's telescope on your your phone where I get to always look in on what you're doing or a pastor's microscope get the developers working on that it'd probably be a good idea right where at any time I can just pull up what you're doing oh my goodness look at this right you get all sorts of sermon material that's not the that's not the purpose of it and I could propose a digital detox and say everybody uh nobody play Flappy Birds for a month and we're all like okay right but it's about taking back control of our desires and I believe I mean this if you could take back control of your desires and that purifying that's what a detox is it's purifying it purges our thoughts Purge in our Spirits from these compulsions wonder will be found the Wonder lost will be I promise it to you I'm telling you according to the word of God the more you can do a desired detox where you're starving the carnal desires the more you'll find Wonder in the things of Christ and there's a lot of things that we could share with you that could be very practical but I've just I I just wrote a few down because there's different ways that you can do this and and this I believe there's intentional scriptural steps that we can take but I believe that when it comes to technology and media entertainment all these things that we should take intentional breaks from them that we should we should designate I I am going to get distance from this I'm going to prove that that's not doesn't have the power over me because I can determine when I when I check it it doesn't tell me when to look I'll look when I want to I I'm not going to be told that if you can if you do this by such and such time you get more points and if you respond to this by such and such time this will happen and that will happen in all the ways they're trying to entice you to engage and be manipulated into something you say no no no no no no no I I control this by the power that is in Me by Christ that is in me I'm going to keep under my body and and take these intentional breaks from these things you can do it by turning off notifications whether you do it during certain times or you just do it permanently I I actually I think for years now I don't even I don't have any vibration or sounds nothing on my phone where it's going to indicate to me when someone calls me or when they text me when they write me and and I did it because I don't need the notification I don't want the notification but all it did was just make you look at it more right because you don't know when it comes I used to say why are you staring at your phone I need to know when someone texts me why you just turn the ring around no no you don't do that because then it interrupts you it'll break your concentration right you could turn these notifications off you can there you could just delete the app all right just delete apps I think there's an app you can install on your phone to make phone calls just add that one right just use it to make phone calls but there's things you can do to create areas I've been reading a lot on this one brother shared with me that how as we begin to preach on this that he started uh just when he goes walks on a daily basis he leaves all the media behind but but the um anything let your moderation be known to all men so all the men in those think tanks and all those design groups and all the guys who are trying to figure out ways that you can always have something on you when you run right they want you to carry your watch they want you to carry your phone they want you to carry the smart vest right the integrated Under Armor that's telling you how you're breathing how much electric lights you're losing and we get so caught up in the metrics and the data and I'll just leave it behind and go on a walk so at least at some point in your life you're not you're not sensitized to everything that's taking place around you you could create areas in your life whether it be in your home or certain things here it's digital free whether we don't bring our cell phone to the the dinner table we don't when we're in The Homeschool Room we don't bring these things in there whatever it might be just create these or even just certain times of the day you say you know what during these times we're we're creating a Faraday Box we're closing these things off and I believe that you can intentionally purposely make time to connect with your family and friends that are right there with you or get this spend time alone like break up with Nancy from Tennessee right don't let her invade your thoughts when you're sitting there trying to take in a sunset be able to sit on a couch and do nothing just sit there and then when it starts to hurt keep sitting there when you start to get bored just keep sitting there and then I know what is it the voice we use the Garrison Keeler I need a cigarette voice from you know that when you start feeling elegant Elliot bring me my phone like no lock lock them up tie them down hey like just tie me to the mast I'm sailing right you force me to stay where I'm at as the siren song calls you to pick up your device to check in to find out yes yes football's over to remind yourself yeah who who was the Super Bowl MVP in 73 I need to know that right now they find yourself just sitting there I know if you could get distance if you could do a desired detox you can be more productive you could be more creative could be more useful we can become more present with one another we can nurture our personal relationships in a better way I think a desire detox just disconnect whatever's feeding that desire I could propose to you very specific things we could we could try to create some sort of 30-day challenge of this is what we're going to do and I think there's enough research and enough technology where we can all do that and implement it right but I want you to want it and and one thing I meant to say at the very beginning none of this and at no point in my heart has ever been like something explosive or exposing nothing corrective my whole inspiration is to be in my whole desire was to be inspirational I just want to inspire people to Christ to kind of awaken that Wonder of Christ to where even our children become enamored with the idea of the supernatural and there and you start to talk about Christ and you start talking about the things of God they're like well that's nothing Elon Musk is building a huge data center in Austin and it's bigger than any mountain and it's bigger than this and they're all enamored with all these rock stars you know did you know Jesus walked on water with in America can do this right you mean Jesus died huh they can keep our superheroes alive now and it's like there's just no attraction to the things of God and and what I'm proposing is to to not feed those desires a desire detox the Bible says in Hebrews chapter 13 verse 5 thanks for the 10 minutes it says let your conversation be without covetousness and be content with such things as you have free hath said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee let your manner of Life be your let your habit or your custom be without covetousness there is a word that means the Love of Money covetousness speaks to the love of that gain money is what's used here it says be content with such things as you have and I would say this in light of the scripture covetousness extends Beyond just money but to that part of the mind that money stimulates because all these things we've talked about stimulate the same addictive neurons in your mind that money does when you get a paycheck and it stimulates the mind so do the fake points in your app stimulate the same point in your mind the the same part of your mind that responds to social rewards and more followers and more likes and more notifications when you're scrolling through Tick Tock and you're scrolling through all those YouTube shorts the same rewards you get out of the same part of the brain that responds to a paycheck and we have social rewards we have clout we have all sorts of ways of having gain or digital currency and it's that same way when the Bible says be without covetousness I believe it touches on all these things we're talking about and the way that he leads be without let your conversation be without covetousness be content I want to come back to contentment be content with such things as you have he says for he had said I will never leave thee nor forsake thing in other words this is where contentment is found this is what covetousness brings you away from when you're coveting the things that you feel like you don't have when you have the fear of missing out when you have the depression when you have the anxiety when you have the hopelessness the real drawback of all that is you forgot that he said the god of a Wonder said I'll never leave you nor forsake you your provision your protection your pleasure it says hey I'm right here I can entertain you beyond what you could think this is where contentment is found first Timothy 6 6 but godliness with contentment is great gain I think it speaks of being satisfied with Christ contentment I know that there's a way maybe this was just in my mind but I suspect that some of you have the same thought that happiness we've redefined happiness to mean except what I have right you're poor just accept it you don't have anything just accept it and that's what we kind of try to shoehorn contentment to mean is be content with what you have you're broke you're poor you're bored you've got nothing you're you're carrying around an iPhone 6 whatever it might be just be content with it you're still using dial up or DSL be content with it right you don't have the latest and greatest be happy with it you're still on a Windows laptop be happy with it right we just kind of have this idea if you hey if you're settling for that I mean if you're just one of those people that go like Android that's fine you know just be happy with whatever you have but it doesn't mean that at all in the sense of settling but it means find the sufficiency in it in what you have to be of a truly have a happy mind it means to really rest in what you have to genuinely be satisfied in what you have telling you turn this around the world is trying to make you feel sick because you don't have something and what you don't have isn't even real and they're making you want a desire for something that has no substance and and to make you long for it and desire it when there's nothing to it that's the synthetic happiness that that's the things that'll never satisfy and so when it says be content the world is wanting you to settle for an alternative reality they want you to settle for digital currency they're wanting you to settle for things of the Flesh and the faster of this world that will always change when he says such things that I give unto you the things that I can provide you should find sufficiency in that like there's real happiness to be found in the way Everlasting There's real happiness to be found in Christ There's real happiness to be found in serving the lord There's real happiness to be found in serving others to be satisfied with Christ it means to rest and be said it means to give satisfaction to do you mind if I quote brother Benjamin Franklin he said we'll just disregard his French days and we'll just focus on some of the good he did for us but he says money never made a man happy yet nor will it remember let's use money as a placeholder and for let's just strive for directional accuracy instead of perfection on what he's meaning by money but let's use it as a placeholder of the things that excite our desire he said there's nothing in its nature to produce happiness I mean some of you need to really hear this all right that we think money is going to solve all our problems he says there's nothing in its nature to make make us happy the more a man has the more he wants instead of it feeling a vacuum it makes one it satisfies what satisfies one want excuse me if it satisfies one want it doubles and trebles that want another way and brother Benjamin said it perfectly in the 1700s exactly what's happening to us we think this is going to quench but if it fills some desire it triples a desire somewhere else it doubles a desire somewhere else because it's made that way by Design no Movie Maker no show script writer no no business no economy no ecosystem out there ever wants you to put it down and say I've had enough they want you to keep coming back for more but godliness with contentment is great gain brother Micah you could come musicians you could come godliness with contentment by the Lord you could come godliness with contentment is great gain it's that finding that sufficiency in Christ finding my satisfaction this contentment is not settling this contentment is being awakened to true satisfaction and so he continues in verse 8 having food and reignment let us be there with content notice how it comes back to recognizing the base needs the things that are just the simple things the things that I could say in life I have what I need to perform my functions I have what I need I can use the world for what I need but I must not overuse it could I take a poll tonight does this mean anything to anybody here tonight does it does it strike a chord in your heart does it speak to something in your life does it inspire you as a parent to be more mindful of the battles our young girls are facing the battles that our young people are facing and the source of their anxiety and the source of their desires is because the world is right up there in their face all the time instigating desire instigating desire and we need to demonstrate from the top the godliness with contentment is great gain that having the things that are necessary and getting the use that we have out of the world let us be content but they that will be rich they that desire for more the trembling of a desire the tripling of a desire the Dublin of a desire fall into temptation and a snare and into many foolish and hurtful lust drowned men in destruction and perdition For the Love of Money is the root of all evil that's a that's a blanket statement he says which while some coveted after [Music] they have aired from the faith and pierced themselves through with many Sorrows a desire detox is what Paul is proposing to Timothy Timothy be mindful as a young man he says flee also youthful lust lust of a particular age some of you may be sitting here in the service tonight thinking I don't even read my text messages I have my wife do that right there's things that you you're not on social media you don't have a Facebook footprint you don't have a digital footprint go ahead Google me brother Aaron you won't find anything about me you might have been able to abstain from all sorts of services and everything and you find yourself in no way impacted by this that's great I hope your takeaway is that the Temptation is real because youthful luster lusts that are appropriate for a certain age and some of us may not be the digital natives that these young people are growing up online some of us may have already been well into adulthood before these things begin to take shape or take hold so we're not prone to the same thing our brains were already fully developed certain things in our lives are already very very static and there was no elasticity to develop addictions of these things but our young people and their mind the most critical age of development are being bombarded with all this stuff it's not like it used to be where you could just be away from it and even when you go to message camps and you go to message meetings and you'd go to message church and you would go to a private school you could just get so much distance right from the world so much this is there's no distance anymore and we've got to find ways as Believers to detox desire to shut off the the the intoxification of the world to shut off all the contamination that comes through the world and these things that it's talking about that if we don't if we find desire getting the best of us it's what leads to hurtful us it's what incites and inflames Youthful us it's what excites passions where if we're following after it and where you have these addictions we have these compulsions we air from the faith and we Pierce ourselves through with many sorrows and so he proposes a desire detox he says oh man of God flee these things to talk yourself from these toxins purge yourself purify yourself from these toxins and fall after righteousness godliness Faith love patience meekness John Wesley wrote of this in general they may all be summed up in one Desiring happiness [Music] so how how do I you know how do I take into perspective a desire detox and The Wonder of Christ how how am I going to take all these ways the world has its tentacles in me and then follow after righteousness and God in his faith love patience and meekness I've said this before and I'll present it to you this way that in talking about the Wonder lust and wonder lost we said we were going to begin to restore wonder by identifying the influences that cause the wonderlust because as long as you're wanderlusting it's going to be really hard for you to find the Wonder In Christ because your desire is going to drive you this way and you're going to have a desire that keeps pitting you to pursue and pursue and so what you need to start with is realizing wow this whole false economy has got me addicted all these platforms all these ideas and I know that some of you have used false pretense to continue to engage in things that you know aren't necessary and have no utility and you say you know what enough of it enough of it if you can't do it for your own self do as Christ did and sanctify himself for his children's sake for the disciples sake and if this I believe that if recognizing that the influences if we could start there with a desired detox that frees us up it begins to free us up and you have help in this you can ask God to help you it frees up your spirits and your minds and your attention and your time for the things of God it's not desire that's driving me but it is Desiring happiness out of God and I've used this example before this is what popped in my mind when I went down this path that they say that if you're depressed that diet and exercise or to the most important thing sleep diet next are three of the most important things you can get when you're depressed but guess what depression it makes it really hard eating right exercising sleeping at the appropriate times and then they tell you that the solution to your depression are is resolving all the symptoms of your depression you can like I don't know doc you sound like a quack to me how can I eat right if I don't feel right how can I exercise if I don't feel like I want to and there can just be this incredible uh like what what do I start with what do I start with you know that may be exactly how you begin to feel so inundated and uh and drunk with the things of the world you begin to think overwhelmed how is it I'm ever going to get out of this why don't you start Desiring happiness out of God all these things could be summed up in this Desiring happiness out of God come unto me he says [Music] I propose a desire detox would you take it seriously with me I said Lord see try my heart and see if there be any object of pain any useless Habit in my life that is keeping me from the way Everlasting Stand Together [Music]
