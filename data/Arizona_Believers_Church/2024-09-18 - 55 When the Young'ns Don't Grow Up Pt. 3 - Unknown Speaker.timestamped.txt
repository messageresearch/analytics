[0:00] as Paul is saying uh lifting up that
[0:03] more excellent way and he speaks of
[0:05] Charity and he speaks of it in a number
[0:06] of different context in this chapter he
[0:10] speaks of prophecies and knowledge and
[0:12] these different gifts these tongues and
[0:14] says that they're in part uh they'll
[0:16] they'll be done away with and that when
[0:19] that which is perfect is come is the
[0:20] time that that happens then he says when
[0:23] I was a child I spake as a child
[0:25] understood as a child I thought as a
[0:27] child and he says when I was a child I
[0:30] did these childish things because uh it
[0:33] was expected of him at that time if you
[0:35] had saw a child act like a child um
[0:38] there's really no correction in that
[0:39] necessarily it's to be expected and
[0:42] often times it's when children don't act
[0:44] like children that they get the most
[0:46] attention it's like wow that was really
[0:47] mature of you or that was beyond your
[0:49] years and Paul says when I was a child I
[0:52] acted as you would expect he says but
[0:54] when I became a man I put away childish
[0:56] things so there's the mark of maturity
[0:58] even a mark of manhood is when you put
[1:00] childish things away and that's why we
[1:03] look at maturity or this aging or this
[1:05] adulthood that Paul's talking about not
[1:07] so much when you come of age by a number
[1:10] turn 18 or 21 or 30 but rather when your
[1:13] life begins to demonstrate a growth and
[1:16] an understanding of things and I think I
[1:18] mentioned it Sunday morning that I was
[1:20] want to refer all the way back and start
[1:22] pull back from some of the things we
[1:23] ministered on the beginning on the one
[1:26] thing desired and how that life is about
[1:28] learning value and making choices ches
[1:30] to pursue those things which are worth
[1:32] pursuing and that would be a mark of
[1:33] maturity is how that one uh spends their
[1:36] time and their resources and it shows
[1:38] that one is learning value and how
[1:40] things work and so we've used this title
[1:43] when the youngans don't grow up and I
[1:45] believe it really speaks specifically to
[1:48] this particular verse when I became a
[1:50] man when I grew up there was things
[1:52] about my childhood that found their
[1:54] place and there's things that I no
[1:56] longer did because I'm in manhood now
[1:58] I'm in adulthood and I'm using this
[2:00] title as I felt the Lord just impressed
[2:02] upon me to to structure it this way the
[2:05] title implies that you could age but not
[2:08] grow up so it suggests the possibility
[2:11] of not growing up we may say it suggests
[2:14] that you can be a fully functioning uh
[2:17] human being and have all the faculties
[2:19] and the physical abilities of any other
[2:21] human but fail to mature or you fail to
[2:24] reach your potential and that might be a
[2:26] really good way of putting it that you
[2:27] have all the resources available to you
[2:29] you have all the training you have all
[2:31] the gifts and all the talents but you
[2:32] never quite reach your potential or
[2:35] another way of saying it is when young
[2:37] ones don't grow up is they don't fulfill
[2:38] their purpose and we always we kind of
[2:41] joke a lot of times maybe not always
[2:43] that you there you know you're still
[2:45] living at home in your mother's basement
[2:47] and we're like we immediately know they
[2:48] don't live in Arizona and that they must
[2:50] live in Ohio or something and and it's
[2:53] like you're a 40-year-old man you live
[2:55] at home in your mother's basement that's
[2:56] always like one of the biggest uh disses
[2:58] I guess you could give some somebody is
[3:00] to suggest that that means you've never
[3:02] fulfilled your purpose no matter how
[3:04] much uh trolling you do online uh you
[3:06] have not succeeded in life you've never
[3:08] fulfilled the purpose of being a a human
[3:12] being is to grow up and contribute and
[3:14] and to be successful in these different
[3:15] ways and that's one way of saying that
[3:18] you didn't grow up it's not that you
[3:19] didn't age because for some of us may be
[3:22] praying and Desiring that we don't grow
[3:23] up physically but that this is about not
[3:26] maturing and we'll find in the message
[3:28] of God in the of the message of the hour
[3:30] in the Bible the word of God that God's
[3:32] will for his children is perfection and
[3:35] we are a three- room house God wants us
[3:38] to be complete in every respect it's We
[3:40] Are The Dwelling Place of God uh it we
[3:43] are a temple of the Holy Ghost he's
[3:45] wanting to build us up into that stature
[3:47] in 1 Thessalonians chap 5: 23 and 24
[3:52] Paul says in the very God of Peace
[3:53] sanctify you holy and I pray God your
[3:56] whole spirit and whole soul and whole
[3:59] body body be preserved blameless unto
[4:02] the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ
[4:04] Faithful Is He that calleth you who also
[4:06] will do it we do what preserve you
[4:09] blameless to keep you holy and perfect
[4:12] in spirit soul and body to be holy means
[4:15] to be perfect to be complete in all
[4:17] respects so your whole Spirit soul and
[4:20] body that means your entire person
[4:22] there's nothing wanting or lacking it's
[4:24] speaking that God desires that there be
[4:27] Health in your body the desires that
[4:28] there' be soundness of mind he desires
[4:30] that your your soul be sealed and this I
[4:35] know we've ministered on that thought
[4:36] before and I think we could say it this
[4:38] way we know that God's promised us a
[4:40] glorified body that we're going to be
[4:42] perfect in the physical sense the soul
[4:44] has been sealed it's perfect in a
[4:45] sinless sense and it's already in an
[4:47] eighth day condition and so I believe
[4:49] that this wholeness that God desires for
[4:52] us that God who called you can also do
[4:54] includes emotional Harmony and spiritual
[4:57] maturity
[5:00] some review from Sunday in Hebrews
[5:01] chapter 6: 1 to3 Chapter 5 really forms
[5:05] the basis for this he's he's telling
[5:07] them you should be the teachers by now
[5:10] but you're having to be taught again and
[5:12] so you're being held back of grade you
[5:14] should have graduated you should be the
[5:15] professors you should be the one
[5:16] teaching I've got a lot I'd like to say
[5:18] to you but you can't bear it and you
[5:20] become as ones that need milk he says
[5:22] you're still babes you're not growing up
[5:23] you're not continuing so he says
[5:25] therefore leaving the principles of the
[5:27] doctrine of Christ let us go on unto
[5:30] Perfection that word there is perfector
[5:33] it speaks of Christ the perfect one who
[5:36] is the highest example of faith in
[5:38] Ephesians he said that we may grow up
[5:40] into him which is Christ so there's a
[5:43] maturing a growing up let us go on unto
[5:45] the perfect one not laying again the
[5:47] foundation of repentance from dead works
[5:49] and of Faith toward god of the doctrine
[5:51] of baptisms and of laying on of hands
[5:54] and of resurrection of the dead and of
[5:55] Eternal judgment and this will we do if
[5:58] God permit the the same one that called
[6:00] you he also will do it we will come to
[6:03] this place if God will allow if God will
[6:06] permit so he says there's a foundation
[6:08] and if there's a foundation there must
[6:09] be a structure there must be something
[6:12] that is built upon that foundation and
[6:14] it is perfection this Perfection is not
[6:17] sinless Perfection where we're able to
[6:19] go an entire day and not do something
[6:22] wrong but rather it speaks this
[6:23] Perfection is a matter of growth it is a
[6:26] it is maturity it's fulfilling purpose
[6:29] so he's closing out this uh writing to
[6:32] the Hebrews in chapter 13 verses 20 and
[6:35] 21 he says now the God of Peace that
[6:36] brought again from the dead our lord
[6:39] Jesus that great Shepherd of the sheep
[6:41] through the blood of the Everlasting
[6:43] Covenant make you perfect that's to to
[6:47] make perfect is to strengthen to
[6:49] complete and it's rooted in that same
[6:52] the same thought of being a made whole
[6:53] is to make one as they ought to be and
[6:57] that's your full potential what God
[6:58] wants for your life if you're 100 going
[7:00] to be 100 be 100 live it hundredfold
[7:03] make you perfect in every good work to
[7:05] do his will working in you that which is
[7:07] well pleasing in his sight through Jesus
[7:09] Christ to whom be glory forever and ever
[7:12] amen to make perfect remember that word
[7:15] I think we used on Sunday that artios it
[7:17] speaks of uh a special aptitude for a
[7:20] given use so God has called you for
[7:22] specific purpose when he makes you
[7:24] perfect he suits you and nurtures you
[7:26] and brings you to that place where you
[7:28] can fulfill your purpose that part which
[7:31] God has planned for you that specific
[7:33] use that God has for you in the body of
[7:35] Christ he perfects you to be able to do
[7:38] that some of the scriptures we ended
[7:41] with on Sunday morning is be therefore
[7:44] perfect and be therefore followers of
[7:46] God as dear children it's Ephesians 51
[7:49] be therefore perfect or be therefore
[7:52] followers of God as dear children it's
[7:54] this imitation of God and to be a son it
[7:57] necessarily implies imitation of the
[8:00] father coming into His Image it
[8:02] necessarily implies growing into what
[8:05] the father is and in this example in a
[8:08] spiritual birth we've got the perfect
[8:10] father uh my sons may not have that in
[8:13] the natural life but they do have it in
[8:15] the spiritual life that to be a follower
[8:17] of God as dear children imitate him so
[8:20] that you can fulfill Matthew 5:48 be
[8:22] therefore perfect even as your father
[8:25] which is in heaven is perfect be
[8:27] therefore complete have perfect
[8:29] integrity and and virtue fully grow and
[8:32] mature as he is perfect as he needs
[8:34] nothing added to be better as he needs
[8:37] nothing added to be what he is let us
[8:39] also grow let us also mature and be
[8:42] perfect our as our Heavenly Father which
[8:44] is in heaven is
[8:47] perfect now if you turn to Romans
[8:49] chapter
[8:50] 8 vers 15 to1 17 and if you'd like to go
[8:54] back and read the whole chapter before
[8:55] Sunday I'd like to dwell in this chapter
[8:58] a little bit more
[8:59] and uh if you if you have your Amen on
[9:02] mute or Airplane Mode you can turn it
[9:05] off and uh I want to ask the question
[9:09] why grow up you say well I'm a son I'm a
[9:12] son why do I need to grow up and and
[9:14] what what's the what would be the
[9:15] purpose in this even maybe besides
[9:19] identifying that it's God's will for us
[9:21] uh why is it God's will what's in his
[9:24] program and now I know I'm jumping right
[9:26] into the middle of a very large thought
[9:28] a beautiful thought a feel Romans
[9:29] chapter 8 is kind of a summary of the
[9:31] entire message uh and God's end time
[9:33] plan for you have not received the
[9:35] spirit of bondage again to fear but
[9:37] you've received the spirit of adoption
[9:39] whereby we cry ABA father so we're no
[9:41] longer in bondage to a Jew they're no
[9:43] longer under the bondage of the law to
[9:45] all we no longer under bondage of sin
[9:47] and the fear of death he says but we've
[9:50] received a spirit of adoption the spirit
[9:53] itself beareth witness with our spirit
[9:55] that we are the children of God and of
[9:58] children then HS HS of God and Joint HS
[10:01] with Christ if so be that we suffer with
[10:03] him that we may be also glorified
[10:07] together and he's using this phrase and
[10:11] if children so the spirit itself bear
[10:13] witness that we are the children of God
[10:16] we have received the spirit of adoption
[10:18] we haven't received the fullness of
[10:20] adoption but the spirit which is able to
[10:22] bring us to this adoption and this
[10:25] rapturing Grace he says then the spirit
[10:28] indwelling us testified that we are
[10:30] children of God and if children so he
[10:32] said if we're children this all applies
[10:35] and we're not just children in the sense
[10:37] that we trust God or that we love God or
[10:39] that we're dependent upon him but we're
[10:41] children in the sense that we are his
[10:43] seed we we have come from him as it says
[10:46] in Acts 17:28 for in him we live and
[10:49] move and have our being as certain also
[10:51] of your own poets have said for we are
[10:53] also his
[10:55] offspring so Paul is using this phrase
[10:58] if children or that we are children to
[11:01] be used of those who are in a
[11:02] relationship that is nurturing to be
[11:05] used of those who are in a relationship
[11:06] wherein your character is being molded
[11:08] by one that has uh oversight over you
[11:11] responsibility to you so we're children
[11:14] of God and in this relationship with God
[11:17] he is nurturing Us in this relationship
[11:19] to God he is molding our character as
[11:22] children we are led by his spirit and
[11:24] being led by his Spirit it it gives us
[11:27] it governs our thoughts and it animates
[11:29] our actions therefore it reflects
[11:32] God right just like sometimes you might
[11:36] see somebody do something in our family
[11:37] so that's just like brother Aaron they
[11:39] do something good that's just like
[11:41] sister Elizabeth in other words they're
[11:43] they're they're demonstrating what you
[11:44] feel they're learning either by nature
[11:47] or by nurture and really both and
[11:49] they're demonstrating something about
[11:51] the family name about their genes and
[11:52] about how they're they're being raised
[11:54] and so the same as children of God the
[11:56] how we think and how we act reflects
[11:58] upon the character of God as children we
[12:01] are dependent upon God as children we
[12:04] are possessed with the love for his word
[12:06] these are things that it means to be a
[12:08] child of God and then he says as
[12:11] children then hirs so since we are
[12:14] children of God he says there's an
[12:16] allotted inheritance that we have a
[12:18] right to and I love how Paul says we're
[12:20] children of God he says then if you're
[12:22] children think about the consequences
[12:24] then you're heirs Hees of God this is
[12:27] what we are then as his children is we
[12:30] have an allotted portion that is going
[12:32] to be granted to us and he just doesn't
[12:35] stop he says join heirs with Jesus
[12:37] Christ this is the firstborn of God this
[12:39] is our elder brother it says in later in
[12:42] the chapter verse 29 for whom he did for
[12:45] know this is Romans 8 he also did
[12:47] predestinate to be conformed to the
[12:49] image of his son so we can say there's
[12:52] God's desire that if we are forn and by
[12:55] forn knowledge we're elected to a new
[12:56] birth God just does not want us to be
[12:58] born born again but he's also
[13:00] predestined us for a destiny of being
[13:02] conformed to the image of his perfect
[13:05] son so God who fornew us and elected us
[13:08] to a New Birth has also destined us to
[13:11] be conformed to the image of his son
[13:13] that he Jesus Christ might be the
[13:16] firstborn among many
[13:19] Brethren did you know that Jesus isn't
[13:22] the only begotten Son of
[13:24] God not anymore he was at the time but
[13:28] now he's the firstborn born among many
[13:30] Brethren he is the he is now the elder
[13:32] brother our divine elder brother and
[13:35] this thought this concept of the
[13:37] firstborn is a very important principle
[13:40] so we realize that Christ is the elder
[13:42] brother he is the firstborn and then we
[13:45] God is saying we are join HS
[13:48] together with Christ that we are not
[13:51] grandchildren to God when I was in
[13:54] Michigan I didn't get a vacation I'm
[13:55] feeling the effects of it I think but I
[13:57] preached a couple services there on a
[13:59] Wednesday and a Sunday while everyone
[14:01] else was vacationing and I ministered
[14:04] God is not a grandpa and I had to make
[14:06] it very clear that that wasn't my time
[14:08] to take shots at brother John my
[14:10] father-in-law uh but it was just using a
[14:12] thought that God cannot be a grandpa God
[14:14] doesn't want to be a grandpa because God
[14:17] only has sons and daughters so our
[14:19] relationship to God is that as a son and
[14:22] a daughter in the same way that Jesus
[14:24] Christ then is saying I'm a son and he
[14:27] prayed that we would be one as he is one
[14:29] with the father and that's the the
[14:30] beauty of this work of Grace and this
[14:33] being translated into the body of Christ
[14:35] is that we are now joint HS with
[14:39] Christ in Hebrews chap 1: 1-4 it says
[14:43] this about Jesus Christ this is the
[14:45] image of God's son God who at sunry
[14:48] times and in diverse manners spake in
[14:50] time past un the fathers by the prophets
[14:53] God hath in these last days spoken unto
[14:55] us by his son whom he hath appointed
[14:58] heir of all things things so Christ is
[15:01] the heir of All Things by whom also he
[15:03] made the worlds who be in the brightness
[15:05] of his glory and the express image of
[15:07] his person and upholding All Things by
[15:09] the word of his power when he had by
[15:11] himself purged our sins sat down on the
[15:14] right hand of the Majesty on high being
[15:17] made so much better than the angels as
[15:20] he hath by inheritance obtained a more
[15:22] excellent Name than they Jesus Christ is
[15:26] the heir of all things he hath purged
[15:29] our sins by himself this is something he
[15:31] did as a son and being obedient and hath
[15:34] by inheritance obtained a more excellent
[15:37] Name than they this is what Christ is
[15:40] heir of all things he's obtained an
[15:42] inheritance he was uh the Son of God
[15:45] sent into the world to perform a
[15:46] specific purpose of God and as God's
[15:49] children were also promised an
[15:51] inheritance jointly with Christ Christ
[15:54] is the heir of all things Paul says if
[15:57] children then HS heir of God like he
[16:00] says your heirs like well what am I
[16:01] going to inherit you're an heir of God
[16:03] and join HS with Christ you're not
[16:05] usurping Christ but now it's an
[16:07] inheritance that we share with Christ as
[16:10] Revelations 217 he that 217 says he that
[16:14] overcometh shall inherit all things and
[16:16] I will be his God and he shall be my
[16:20] son he that overcometh shall inherit all
[16:22] things Christ hath been appointed to be
[16:25] heir of all things there's this there's
[16:28] so much more that could be be expressed
[16:29] in this what I'm trying to show is that
[16:32] as being children of God we're going to
[16:33] be heirs we stand to receive an
[16:36] allotment and as Christ obtained an
[16:39] inheritance he he purged our sins and he
[16:43] by inheritance obtained the more
[16:45] excellent Name than the Angels there is
[16:47] a an inheritance also for us in Christ
[16:51] he's been appointed heir of all things
[16:53] now he that overcometh shall inherit all
[16:55] things and I will be his God and he
[16:58] shall be my
[17:00] son Jesus gives a parable in Matthew
[17:03] 25 uh of the different servants who are
[17:07] faithful Unfaithful the diff levels of
[17:09] faithfulness and he concludes this in
[17:12] verse 21 his lord said un him well done
[17:14] thou good and faithful servant thou Hast
[17:16] been Faithful over a few things I will
[17:19] make thee ruler over many things enter
[17:21] thou into the joy of the Lord this has
[17:24] great meaning for faithful Believers
[17:26] that you have a role you have a function
[17:27] you have something that you're doing for
[17:29] the kingdom of God in this life and
[17:31] because of our faithful in this life you
[17:32] are made a ruler over more he that is
[17:35] faithful in the least will be faithful
[17:37] in much and so that principle that
[17:40] Christ elicits in those Parables is this
[17:43] making one a ruler they're inheriting
[17:46] something because of their
[17:48] faithfulness in Revelations 3: 21 to him
[17:51] that overcometh will I grant to sit with
[17:54] me in my throne even as I also overcame
[17:57] and and set down with my father in in
[17:58] his throne amen quite a statement the
[18:01] Bible says that he has been made much
[18:04] better than the angels having sat down
[18:07] on the right hand of the Majesty on high
[18:10] but now there is a promise that to him
[18:11] that overcometh I will grant to him to
[18:15] sit with me in my throne even as I also
[18:18] overcame and sat down with my father in
[18:20] his throne notice that that beautiful
[18:22] symmetry how a son comes into the world
[18:25] and then he sits at the right hand of
[18:26] the majesty and now he gives us this
[18:28] picture to where he is now set in his to
[18:32] sit in his throne as he had sat in the
[18:35] father's Throne how he ALS he overcame
[18:39] and was sat down in the father's Throne
[18:41] now he's going to Grant to us this is
[18:42] our inheritance you are children and
[18:45] being children your heirs heirs not just
[18:47] of anything but of God and join HS with
[18:50] Christ so he grants to the Overcomer to
[18:53] inherit all things to sit with him in
[18:55] his throne as we overcome just as he was
[18:58] gred a privilege and a right as he
[19:01] overcame so we are children and as
[19:03] children were
[19:05] heirs and Acts
[19:08] 20:32 says and now Brethren I commend
[19:11] you to God and Paul in doing so says and
[19:15] to the word of his grace what a
[19:17] beautiful statement I commend you to God
[19:19] and to the word of his grace which is
[19:21] able to build you up and to give you an
[19:24] inheritance among all them which are
[19:26] Sanctified quite a quite a statement I
[19:30] going I'm going to commend you to God
[19:31] and to his word of Grace and God through
[19:34] his word of Grace is able to build you
[19:36] up and give you an inheritance among all
[19:38] them which are
[19:40] Sanctified to build up it means to
[19:43] finish the structure the foundation was
[19:45] laid for if he's going to build you up
[19:48] there's a foundation that is laid to
[19:50] build up is to finish the structure to
[19:53] perfect it to raise it up and to uh
[19:55] ornament and and and fill it out that
[19:58] structure was intended when the
[19:59] foundation was raised so it's God and
[20:02] the
[20:03] word are able to build you up because
[20:07] sunship is not just about birth being a
[20:09] daughter of God is not just about birth
[20:10] but it's also the upbuilding and
[20:13] perfecting we're built upon Christ to is
[20:15] assur foundation and now upon that
[20:18] Foundation we need this edification we
[20:20] need the training we need teaching we
[20:22] need the cultivation in order to be
[20:24] built up see that in Ephesians chapter 4
[20:28] so the instruction ction of God and the
[20:29] word of his grace the admonishment of
[20:31] the scripture the nurture of God is so
[20:33] that he can give us our full inheritance
[20:36] I commend you to God and to the word of
[20:38] his grace if Paul was the father in The
[20:40] Gospel if he was one that birthed them
[20:41] he knew that it's one Waters and one uh
[20:45] plants and there's different works but
[20:46] God's the one that gives the increase
[20:48] it's God that's going to grow them in
[20:50] Grace so he says that God is going to
[20:53] build you up and give you an inheritance
[20:56] among them which are sanctified
[20:58] it's all for the purpose the building up
[21:01] is for the purpose of the inheritance so
[21:03] you say well why grow up well if you're
[21:05] a child of God and you don't grow
[21:08] up I guess it is a question when the
[21:11] young ones don't grow up when the young
[21:12] ones don't grow up kind of like when you
[21:14] know what what what happens when they
[21:16] don't it's posing the question Romans
[21:20] chapter 8:1 17 says and if children then
[21:23] HS Heirs of God and Joint HS with
[21:26] Christ if so be that we suffer with him
[21:30] that we may be also glorified together I
[21:33] commend you to God under the word of his
[21:34] grace which is able to build you up and
[21:36] to give you an inheritance among all
[21:38] them which are Sanctified so the
[21:40] building up by the word of his grace is
[21:42] necessary to be given the inheritance
[21:45] and here he says you're children of God
[21:47] you're Heirs of God you're heirs with
[21:50] Christ if you suffer with him we must
[21:53] suffer with him in order to be glorified
[21:56] together with him this suffering is
[21:58] necessary as a child it's necessary as
[22:01] an heir if so be that we suffer with him
[22:05] if so be that we imitate him in that we
[22:08] deny ourselves we follow the will of God
[22:10] we do uh to the father what he did also
[22:13] to the father amen we're join HS with
[22:17] Christ if we suffer as Christ suffered
[22:21] it requires this suffering in order to
[22:23] be granted the same inheritance
[22:30] in Galatians chapter 4 veres 1
[22:38] to7 going going through this pretty
[22:40] quick tonight we might make it before
[22:42] all the restaurants
[22:45] close it says and now this is uh in this
[22:49] reading there's a lot in the context
[22:51] here to the the Church of galatia a lot
[22:54] more even in this chapter but this
[22:56] principle should be very familiar to us
[22:58] says now I say that the heir as long as
[23:01] he is a child differ nothing from a
[23:03] servant though he be Lord of all that
[23:06] the image I think has been painted the
[23:08] picture is very clear in the message of
[23:09] the hour I think it's uh clear even in
[23:12] the scripture that a child is an heir
[23:15] it's what he walks through in Romans as
[23:17] a child of God you are an heir so that's
[23:19] the logical conclusion that when one is
[23:21] in the family there's some portion that
[23:24] is allotted to him that he stands to
[23:26] receive especially in the law of the
[23:27] firstborn so The Heir uh is destined to
[23:31] be to be the Lord of all he has an
[23:34] inheritance by relationship to the
[23:36] father but he says as long as he is a
[23:39] child as long as he's immature as long
[23:41] as he doesn't grow up or we could say
[23:43] when he's a child he's no different than
[23:46] a servant the firstborn of a father
[23:49] could be eight years old and he could be
[23:50] the one that stands to receive
[23:52] everything that's in the father's name
[23:54] but he does not have all the rights and
[23:56] privileges of the firstborn granted to
[23:58] him at Birth or even at 8 years old but
[24:00] he's just like a servant who has to do
[24:03] what he's told has certain
[24:05] responsibilities and works within a
[24:06] certain framework and he doesn't have
[24:09] any more privileges as it were he
[24:11] differs not from a servant though he be
[24:13] Lord of all so Paul explains gives us
[24:16] more detail to this so this child who
[24:19] stands to be heir of all things is put
[24:22] under verse two under tutors and
[24:24] governors until the time appointed of
[24:26] the father so there is tutorship there's
[24:30] Governors there's those that look out
[24:31] after him and train him and child trade
[24:33] him and teach him how things are done so
[24:35] the child is educated and he's
[24:37] disciplined as a child to grow up to a
[24:39] certain time a time appointed of the
[24:42] father a season a moment says even so we
[24:45] when we were children were in bondage
[24:48] under the elements of the world now
[24:51] there's a lot here that's uh context to
[24:54] the Jews and their their dispensation of
[24:56] time where they were brought forth under
[24:58] under the law and then there's an ending
[25:00] of their dispensation where in Christ
[25:02] comes to take them out from under the
[25:04] law and bring them into the promised
[25:06] land of the Holy Ghost he says but when
[25:08] the fullness of time was come God sent
[25:10] forth his son made of the woman made
[25:12] under the law to redeem them that were
[25:14] under the law that we might receive the
[25:16] adoption of sons and because you are
[25:19] Sons God hath sent forth the spirit of
[25:21] his son into your hearts crying ABA
[25:24] father notice the Symmetry there to
[25:26] where the spirit of adoption that he's
[25:28] given us so now because you're Sons God
[25:31] has given you the spirit he says
[25:32] wherefore Thou Art no more a servant but
[25:34] a son he's emphasizing to them again
[25:36] you're not servants you are a son and if
[25:39] a son then an heir of God through Christ
[25:42] now we could read that and think oh okay
[25:44] well he Circle back to where we don't
[25:45] differ from a servant we're Sons fully
[25:47] adopted fully placed in the body of
[25:49] Christ and that's what the spirit is
[25:51] signifying but the spirit signifies that
[25:54] you're a child the the spirit testifies
[25:57] that you're a son it is a spirit of
[25:59] adoption in that it has a purpose it
[26:01] serves as brother bandam teaches us that
[26:04] here one was given tutors and governors
[26:06] till a time appointed of the father in
[26:08] The Natural brother bam says the Holy
[26:10] Ghost is that tutor for us the Holy
[26:13] Ghost is the inside teacher those that
[26:15] have been born again now it manifestly
[26:18] declares that they are Sons but they're
[26:20] not yes manifested Sons so thou we are
[26:23] no more servants don't ever get to your
[26:25] head that you're a servant you are a son
[26:27] and being a son you're an heir of God
[26:30] through
[26:31] Christ and then Paul if you continue to
[26:33] read begins to admonish them and
[26:36] encourage encourages them to be obedient
[26:39] to finish to persevere to to do those
[26:41] things which are right and again as we
[26:44] said before and the title the title
[26:46] implies that you cannot you may not grow
[26:48] up and again this points to the purpose
[26:51] as we're saying Sunday we wanted to
[26:52] emphasize a couple things this points to
[26:54] that purpose of the Holy Spirit the role
[26:57] of the the Seal of God the indwelling of
[26:59] the Holy Ghost that new
[27:02] birth and as Paul is bringing this
[27:04] parallel of how that a son could be
[27:06] placed under a tutor till a specific
[27:08] time where the father would want to
[27:10] determine whether or not he could
[27:11] receive his
[27:13] inheritance instead of natural
[27:15] development this is Supernatural
[27:17] development by God he's developing
[27:20] Supernatural qualities in the same way
[27:23] that life requires in for in order for
[27:25] us to reach the full potential of our
[27:27] DNA in order for us to reach the full
[27:29] potential of our intellectual ability
[27:31] our physical abilities there are certain
[27:33] things that we must be disciplined in
[27:34] and trained in and learn how to do
[27:37] there's certain things in life they tell
[27:38] if you want to be successful you know
[27:40] make your bed and you think is that it
[27:42] no wonder I'm not successful but there's
[27:44] certain things that they could teach you
[27:46] just have these certain habits and
[27:47] manners of even in how you treat people
[27:50] I have found that some of the most
[27:51] successful people I've met in my life
[27:53] have been people that treat you with uh
[27:55] integ they have integrity and they treat
[27:57] you decently
[27:59] they they show you they show you respect
[28:02] and they give you uh and they they just
[28:05] they'll be friendly to you make you feel
[28:07] good no matter who they are they're not
[28:08] going to Big Time you they're not going
[28:09] to try to make you let you know how much
[28:11] more they know than you and put you down
[28:13] and belittle you and so some of the most
[28:15] successful people are people who just
[28:16] know how to treat other people well it's
[28:19] integrity and and it's a it's the right
[28:21] that
[28:22] really uh uh in some ways could say that
[28:24] every human should have is the right to
[28:26] be treated decently right and so this is
[28:29] there just as those qualities are
[28:31] cultivated and nurtured in the natural
[28:34] through parenting and training and
[28:36] school and exercise that's why even in
[28:38] school I was thinking here recently when
[28:40] I was in college I took I had to take
[28:42] golf weightlifting walking and I think I
[28:45] had another one I just can't remember it
[28:46] must have been a really bad one and it's
[28:48] like why am I pain to show up for a
[28:51] class at 7:00 in the morning to walk it
[28:54] was
[28:55] horrible I'm sure I passed wait liting
[28:58] it was just awful but there is something
[29:01] to the curriculum where they understood
[29:03] that not just book learning was all you
[29:05] needed to do but there was something
[29:07] good in getting the blood going and with
[29:08] exercise and that's why there's PE and
[29:10] recess even in in other uh grades and
[29:13] schools it's a way of it's recognizing
[29:15] that the whole person needs to be
[29:17] stimulated for natural
[29:20] success and this is not natural
[29:22] development this is Supernatural
[29:24] development whatever you could glean
[29:26] from the world that determines what
[29:28] makes one SE successful and they they I
[29:30] think they've proven that it's not
[29:31] necessarily true I don't know if
[29:32] Gladwell just pulled it out of a hat but
[29:34] the 10,000 hours that one would have to
[29:36] use to master something or put into
[29:38] something it's not necessary I don't
[29:40] think it should be a Doctrine or a
[29:41] rubric that just 10,000 hours and you've
[29:43] got it because I think I got sleeping
[29:46] down I haven't done the math but I've
[29:48] probably perfected it but it's the idea
[29:50] that it takes proficiency requires
[29:52] practice and do something over and over
[29:54] again and you stay at it and you work
[29:56] and you work and you work so the same
[29:58] concept applies in this way of natural
[30:00] development it applies to Spiritual
[30:02] Development yes you're born again you've
[30:04] got the baptism of the Holy Ghost but
[30:06] the word of God cries out you are a son
[30:09] you are a daughter the spirit of Christ
[30:11] dwells inside of you you are now a babe
[30:14] in Christ who has the full potential
[30:17] laid out before you to become whatever
[30:19] God wants you to become you just need to
[30:22] learn you need to
[30:25] yield this is that beautiful picture
[30:28] that's being expressed in these things
[30:30] so why grow up you're a child of God
[30:33] born by his spirit and you have an
[30:36] inheritance and having an inheritance
[30:39] God wants to train you he wants to teach
[30:41] you he wants to cultivate gifts inside
[30:43] of you he wants to develop you but it's
[30:46] the process of character development is
[30:48] the work of
[30:50] patience in Hebrews 12:
[30:54] 1-1 this will give us a little bit more
[30:57] on
[30:58] Christ and then that role also for us
[31:01] wherefore seeing we also are compassed
[31:03] about with so great a cloud of witnesses
[31:05] let us lay aside every weight and the
[31:08] sin which doth so easily beset us and
[31:10] let us run with patience the race that
[31:12] is set before
[31:14] us I'm glad this isn't a natural
[31:17] race I mean as hard as a spiritual one
[31:20] is I didn't like my walking class let
[31:23] alone a running class but it says let us
[31:26] run with patience the race that is set
[31:27] before us that that when the Holy Ghost
[31:30] was G you received the Holy Ghost that
[31:32] bang you heard that shot you heard was
[31:33] the starter pistol and guess what you
[31:36] didn't cross the finish line you just
[31:38] begun this is the start this is the
[31:40] beginning this is New Life new creatures
[31:42] in Christ new laws new responsibilities
[31:45] new power the power of an endless life
[31:47] this is a new beginning and I think all
[31:50] of that is really beautiful to to see
[31:52] and to breathe in and to experience
[31:53] realize the old man's dead now I'm
[31:55] putting on the new man when the old man
[31:56] tries to get Resurrected put them back
[31:58] down bring them under subjection this is
[32:00] the newness of life this is A New Path
[32:01] forward I got a new race now we're to
[32:04] run this race with patience looking unto
[32:08] Jesus who is the beginner the author and
[32:11] the perfector the finisher of our faith
[32:14] he's the one that we began in he is our
[32:17] the the one who pays the price that we
[32:19] can be quickened and not only has he
[32:21] started us but he'll help us to finish
[32:24] and we're to look to him as an example
[32:26] who for the joy that was set before
[32:28] endured the cross despising the shame
[32:30] and is sat down at the right hand of the
[32:31] Throne of
[32:34] God for consider him that endured such
[32:36] contradiction of Sinners against himself
[32:38] lest you be wearied and faint in your
[32:40] minds ye have not resist resisted unto
[32:43] blood striving against
[32:45] sin and ye have forgotten the
[32:47] exhortation which speaketh unto you as
[32:49] unto
[32:51] children what is why why grow up because
[32:55] as a child you're an heir and being an
[32:58] heir God wants to train you he wants to
[33:00] cultivate you he wants the best for you
[33:03] one of the things that uh they say about
[33:06] being a grandparent is there's a lot of
[33:08] different things they say but they say
[33:09] that um being a grandparent as soon as
[33:11] you enter the room all discipline flies
[33:12] out the window for the
[33:14] grandkids right I think that may have
[33:16] mentioned it here before that it was
[33:17] once I had children and observed my dad
[33:19] as a grandpa that's when I got my
[33:20] Revelation that God is not a
[33:23] grandpa and it was like it makes perfect
[33:25] sense now because there's just not the
[33:26] burden of respons ability uh there's not
[33:29] even the accountability that there's a
[33:32] that a grandparent is supporting one
[33:34] would support the parents in the vision
[33:36] for their children not impose their own
[33:38] they would recognize certain boundaries
[33:39] that the parental care is entrusted in
[33:41] the the dad and the mom and that there's
[33:43] certain respect you want to have for
[33:44] those boundaries and you support them in
[33:46] the vision you don't override it you're
[33:47] trying to dictate or guide it and you
[33:49] certainly don't undermine
[33:51] it you wouldn't undermine it so there is
[33:53] a this relationship that a father has to
[33:56] his child he wants you to he wants the
[33:58] best for you and so he's wants to bring
[34:01] everything out of you that he can once
[34:03] you've now been a babe in Christ and you
[34:05] begin to grow he has all the resources
[34:07] he has all the time don't think that God
[34:09] doesn't have the time for you don't
[34:10] think that God doesn't have the
[34:12] resources for you he's going to give you
[34:14] the time if I by example myself if I've
[34:18] demonstrated to my children that God not
[34:19] isn't always present or that the father
[34:21] isn't always present the father doesn't
[34:23] always have time doesn't always have the
[34:24] right answers doesn't always do it right
[34:26] then I wouldn't want that to reflect
[34:27] upon God because he's always present
[34:29] always has the best in mind is always
[34:31] able always has the time because he
[34:33] wants to see you
[34:36] grow and so it says listen to this
[34:38] exhortation that speaks to you as unto
[34:40] children my son despised not the chasing
[34:42] of the Lord nor faint when thou art
[34:44] rebuked of
[34:45] him and I know those are rough
[34:48] words the chastening the rebuke for whom
[34:51] the Lord loveth he chasteneth and
[34:53] scourgeth every son whom he receiveth
[34:56] you know you wouldn't expect to see
[34:57] Scourge and love in the same sentence
[34:59] but yet here we are whom the Lord loves
[35:02] he scourges whom the Lord loves he
[35:04] corrects he
[35:06] chastises and he says if you endure
[35:08] chastening God dealth with you as
[35:11] Sons he dealth with you as with sons
[35:14] he's dealing with you as a father would
[35:15] his son we recognize that in terms of
[35:19] Correction and instruction and
[35:20] discipline that that's the proper
[35:22] purview of the parent and that they're
[35:25] the ones that would have a standard and
[35:27] there the ones that would uh govern that
[35:30] and implement it and even correct if
[35:32] it's not met and if you knew well
[35:34] brother Aaron told Jack to never do this
[35:37] and you saw him do it you wouldn't go
[35:38] over there and spank him right right you
[35:43] know I mean you wouldn't you wouldn't do
[35:44] that you may not you may you may not do
[35:47] it instinctively you may not do it
[35:48] consciously or whatever you just it's
[35:50] just it's not your
[35:52] responsibility so this it's the
[35:54] responsibility of a parent to not only
[35:56] instruct but to correct
[35:58] and so God if he corrects you that he's
[36:01] telling you you're a son he says for
[36:03] what son is he whom the father Chase
[36:06] not for verse eight but if you be
[36:08] without Scourge and chastening and
[36:10] chastising and correcting whereof all
[36:12] are partakers then are ye bastards and
[36:14] not Sons if God's not training you if
[36:17] he's not disciplining you then it's
[36:20] because you're not that you're not in
[36:21] his program furthermore we had fathers
[36:24] this is where the parallel comes right
[36:25] back to the idea of a child being
[36:27] trained and being tutored and being
[36:29] governed for the purpose of coming into
[36:31] the image of the father we had fathers
[36:33] of our flesh which corrected us and we
[36:34] gave them reverence shall we not much
[36:37] rather be in subjection unto the
[36:39] father's spirits and
[36:40] live so it's a it's a matter of yielding
[36:43] and being subjection to him it's him
[36:46] having preeminence in all things for
[36:48] they verily for a few days chastened us
[36:50] after their own pleasure but he for our
[36:53] profit that we might be partakers of his
[36:55] Holiness now no chastening for the
[36:57] present seeth to be joyous but Grievous
[37:00] and all the children said amen there's
[37:02] no correction or punishment that seeth
[37:05] to be uh joyous and I can say that if in
[37:09] the moment when you're correcting or
[37:11] scourging or chastising if to the child
[37:13] it's joyous then to the parent it's not
[37:15] joyous so there's no correction that is
[37:18] joyous but Grievious at that time and in
[37:20] that moment but it says nevertheless
[37:21] afterward it yieldeth the Peaceable
[37:23] fruit of righteousness unto them which
[37:25] are exercised thereby exercised by what
[37:28] instruction discipline correction
[37:30] scourging it's cultivation it's
[37:33] growth it's
[37:35] maturity it's
[37:38] harvest he says we are compassed about
[37:40] with these great Witnesses let us run
[37:42] this race with patience looking to Jesus
[37:44] who affords us an example of persevering
[37:47] and looking to the goal and looking to
[37:48] the end and he is the beginner of our
[37:50] faith he is the perfector of our faith
[37:51] the grower of our faith the maturing of
[37:54] the measure of faith that we have and
[37:56] therefore we ought not to be weary when
[37:58] God corrects us because this is the
[37:59] nature of the relationship that God has
[38:01] with his children he's going to chasen
[38:03] he's going to rebuke he's going to
[38:04] Scourge why because he's teaching you
[38:06] he's giving you Revelation he's showing
[38:07] you things in the word he's dealing with
[38:09] your heart therefore we must yield to
[38:11] that instruction and say yes sir and
[38:14] modify when we've been corrected be a
[38:16] subjection to God and know that at the
[38:19] time it may not feel good but if we
[38:21] listen and we obey it produces this
[38:24] yield of a Great Harvest of Peaceable
[38:25] fruit of righteousness
[38:28] so there's instruction
[38:30] cultivation and through this learning
[38:32] and through correction it promotes this
[38:34] growth and there's this maturity and
[38:35] ultimately a beautiful Harvest of the
[38:37] character of
[38:41] God I want to close with a a
[38:45] thought that I know is I debated on
[38:48] whether or not to do it at the beginning
[38:50] because it's just so familiar all the
[38:51] scriptures so familiar you might be able
[38:53] to just quote the scriptures before I
[38:54] even get to them but I wanted to use
[38:56] them in this very familiar setting and
[39:00] and structure together to make this
[39:02] point in light of when the youngans
[39:04] don't grow up and what does it mean to
[39:05] grow up why are we growing up I hope you
[39:06] can see it because as a child you're an
[39:08] heir heirs receive very specific
[39:11] instruction servants don't and the
[39:14] disciples and Jesus he says well the
[39:16] servants don't know what their Master's
[39:17] doing but the son is going to be told
[39:20] this is why this is why why does he
[39:22] telling him because he wants him later
[39:23] to make the same decisions the servants
[39:26] just need to be told what to do they
[39:27] don't need to know the wisdom behind it
[39:28] they don't need to know the reasons
[39:30] behind it they just are told to do it
[39:32] and they do it but we as Sons he wants
[39:33] to impart with to us knowledge and
[39:35] wisdom and
[39:37] understanding and I I thinking about
[39:39] this this past week just how that Jesus
[39:42] Christ we say he Prophet priest and King
[39:45] and he came and as when he came as the
[39:47] Messiah he was a prophet he foretold
[39:49] things to come this is Jesus Christ who
[39:52] is the perfect man he's the one that we
[39:55] make our example he's the one that we
[39:58] should uh that we look to the author and
[40:00] the finisher consider him who endured
[40:03] these contradictions who suffered who
[40:05] persevered Jesus Christ comes as a
[40:09] prophet speaking of a future speaking
[40:11] and prophesying of things to come and
[40:13] then through obedience he's made a high
[40:15] priest descends up on high and there he
[40:16] sets as a high priest he becomes priest
[40:18] and one day will be crowned
[40:20] King it says this in Hebrews 5: 8 and9
[40:23] though he were a son this is Christ the
[40:26] sinless one yet learned he obedience by
[40:29] the things which he suffered quite a
[40:32] phrase he learned he increased in
[40:34] knowledge he learned by practice to
[40:36] learn means to be
[40:37] informed and he's learning before the
[40:40] next verse he's being informed he's
[40:42] being instructed he learned obedience by
[40:45] the things which he suffered and being
[40:47] made perfect he became the author of
[40:49] Eternal salvation notice un all them
[40:52] that obey him so though he were a son he
[40:55] had to obey and in obeying he became the
[40:59] author of Eternal salvation through
[41:01] obedience Through The Obedience of the
[41:03] cross through the death of the Cross he
[41:04] became the author of Eternal salvation
[41:06] he became the author of our faith and he
[41:09] learned
[41:12] obedience this learning obedience came
[41:14] before the Perfection he learned
[41:16] obedience it was made perfect mean
[41:18] carried completely through it was
[41:20] accomplished he was finished and I say
[41:23] this I believe every time I use this
[41:25] scripture I say this even said it
[41:26] earlier when we're talking about
[41:27] Perfection this Perfection does not
[41:29] refer to being sinless right because
[41:32] Christ knew no sin from birth right he
[41:34] never had sin he didn't have to come to
[41:37] sinless Perfection but then he's made
[41:39] perfect he was already perfect as far as
[41:42] Sin but this sinlessness is not what
[41:44] relates to Perfection he knew no sin was
[41:46] without sin but yet could still be
[41:48] carried through to completion what was
[41:51] it his character was perfected Jesus
[41:54] increased in wisdom and stature Jesus
[41:56] increased in knowledge and wisdom and
[41:58] understanding he learned though he never
[42:00] sinned he still
[42:01] [Applause]
[42:03] learned and therefore he affords us an
[42:06] example in Hebrews chapter 2:1 speaking
[42:09] of God for it became him it became the
[42:10] father it became God it became him this
[42:14] is an act fitting of his divine plan
[42:16] this is an act that is becoming of God's
[42:18] character this is an act that testifies
[42:20] of God's intent for a son it became him
[42:23] for whom are all things and by whom are
[42:25] all things in bringing many son into
[42:27] Glory catch that he's no longer the only
[42:30] begotten son it's not just that one man
[42:32] would be heir to all things but he is
[42:34] destined us to be heir of all things
[42:37] it's not that just one would sit in the
[42:38] throne but as he has overcome to sit in
[42:40] his father's Throne he wants you to rule
[42:42] and reign with him in his throne so in
[42:45] order to bring many sons under Glory it
[42:48] became God and it was uh conducive to
[42:50] his character expressive of his nature
[42:52] to make the captain of their salvation
[42:55] perfect through suffering
[42:58] Christ though he did not sin though he
[43:01] never made a mistake in a sinless way he
[43:05] still was made
[43:09] perfect this one who is the author of
[43:11] our Eternal salvation was made perfect
[43:13] in Hebrews 5 it says this one who is the
[43:16] captain of our Salvation the one who
[43:18] affords the example was made perfect
[43:21] mature complete whole through
[43:25] sufferings I'm not sure where we
[43:27] mentioned this before if it was this
[43:28] year or in some prior series on this but
[43:31] it's not the this
[43:34] Perfection is not our our quiet
[43:37] suffering and and our private sufferings
[43:40] our our internal struggles that's not
[43:42] what makes your character but I believe
[43:44] this phrase was that how character is
[43:46] made in the Stream of life it's when
[43:48] you're out there amongst the people
[43:50] living a Godly life living a Christian
[43:51] Life and character can only be built
[43:54] through obedience brother BR says
[43:56] perfect character simply cannot be made
[43:58] without
[43:59] suffering and so there's a process of
[44:02] learning and applying he learned
[44:04] obedience by the things which he
[44:06] suffered and tragedy suffering isn't
[44:10] always
[44:11] tragedy suffering isn't always
[44:14] persecution suffering is denying
[44:17] yourself suffering is overcoming
[44:20] suffering is taking the harder way
[44:22] suffering is choosing to do things now
[44:24] for the benefit of a better future
[44:26] suffering is s Define yourself for
[44:28] others sakes that's what suffering is
[44:30] sometimes we think suffering is well I
[44:32] got fired from my job what for well I
[44:34] slapped the guy in the cubicle next to
[44:35] me they're just persecuting me because I
[44:37] was a Christian you laugh you think it's
[44:40] funny I've sat there and heard the guys
[44:41] I've heard uh read a letter one time
[44:44] where somebody quit their job and the
[44:46] letter was a scathing rebuke of their
[44:48] boss for being unchristian and you know
[44:50] what the response was they're just
[44:51] jealous of my wife it's like wait a
[44:53] minute did you do all those things and
[44:55] it's like yeah but they're just jealous
[44:57] of my wife what it's a lack of character
[44:59] say well that's just blessed are those
[45:01] that suffer no no no no no no listen
[45:04] it's also suffering for doing right it's
[45:07] suffering it's suffering by denying
[45:09] yourself it's suffering by uh uh
[45:11] bringing the flesh under
[45:15] subjection brother eler I've just been
[45:17] going back to some statements you made
[45:19] about what character is a and how that
[45:22] it's uh it's not Charisma but what that
[45:24] character really means and that that
[45:27] overcoming I think suffering sometimes
[45:29] is so misunderstood it's the person with
[45:31] Leprosy it's the one with boils it's the
[45:33] one who lost their job it's the one who
[45:34] got run over by car oh their characters
[45:36] being perfected the charact you know a
[45:38] lot of people go through stuff but it
[45:40] never turns them into a belie it never
[45:42] turns them into someone with character
[45:44] some people are abused and they become
[45:46] an abuser some people are lied to and
[45:48] they become a liar some people are
[45:50] offended and they become an Avenger
[45:52] there's a lot of ways that people have
[45:53] not responded appropriately to pressure
[45:56] to persecution to suffering and I
[45:59] believe that as Believers as Sons and
[46:01] Daughters of God you have a quality
[46:03] inside of you to through pressure be
[46:06] turned into a diamond to be properly cut
[46:09] and shaped to fit into the body of
[46:10] Christ to find your place and this
[46:12] suffering is not just the pain and Agony
[46:14] of rejection but it's an everyday
[46:17] process of learning and making
[46:19] application because the flesh Wars
[46:21] against that
[46:23] process and the flesh is going to suffer
[46:26] when we've open obey God and we do what
[46:28] he wants us to
[46:30] do it may it may mean there's a lot of
[46:33] uh humbling ourselves to situations that
[46:35] we just personally don't want and I
[46:38] don't think I should have to do that I
[46:40] don't think I should have to put up with
[46:41] that but yet it is the nature and
[46:43] character of God to humble yourself and
[46:45] do the right thing for the sake of your
[46:46] children for your spouse to live a Godly
[46:48] life and make the right decisions not
[46:50] only for your own Spiritual Development
[46:52] but for the supernatural development of
[46:54] the seed and those that you're leading
[46:55] and guiding and trusted and
[46:58] raising so
[47:00] suffering is
[47:02] overcoming in 1 Peter chapter 2:21 for
[47:05] even here unto were ye called because
[47:07] Christ also suffered for us leaving us
[47:11] an example that you should follow in his
[47:13] steps you got to follow his steps Christ
[47:17] who followed in the father's steps
[47:19] became as the father became raised up to
[47:21] a a seed of Power with Christ with God
[47:24] he is there co-equal with God
[47:27] as it were thought it not Rob to be
[47:29] equal with God he is there made one with
[47:31] the father and Christ who is our example
[47:35] has left a measure of suffering for us
[47:37] that we through suffering would be made
[47:39] perfect because Christ suffered we must
[47:42] also suffer because he is our example
[47:45] and we must follow in his steps says if
[47:48] so be we will be glorified together if
[47:50] so be if we suffer with him to be
[47:53] glorified you're a child of God being a
[47:56] child of God you're an heir and not just
[47:58] an heir of anything but an heir of God
[47:59] and not just an heir of God but joint HS
[48:01] with Christ because you are a child
[48:04] because you are young and birthed by the
[48:06] Holy Spirit you stand to receive in the
[48:08] inheritance of all things and therefore
[48:10] if you are going to be an heir he says
[48:13] we can obtain this inheritance and this
[48:15] glorification if we suffer with him and
[48:18] Peter says we must follow in his steps
[48:20] and if we follow in his steps there must
[48:22] be suffering yes and if there's
[48:24] suffering there's learning and if
[48:26] there's learning there's obedience if
[48:28] there's obedience there's Perfection
[48:32] amen Revelations 1: 6 it says this about
[48:35] us and hath made us Kings and Priests
[48:39] unto God and his father to him be glory
[48:43] and Dominion forever and ever to him be
[48:45] the rule to him be the glory of
[48:47] authority he's made us Kings and Priests
[48:50] unto
[48:51] God and to him be glory and Dominion
[48:54] that's rulership that's Authority that's
[48:56] power for ever and ever Peter said we
[48:58] are a beautiful phrase a royal
[49:00] priesthood a contradiction of terms
[49:02] especially with the division in the Old
[49:04] Testament we are royal priesthood we are
[49:07] Priestly kings that is what we have been
[49:10] made we are priests and kings and we
[49:12] have responsibilities and we have
[49:14] certain services that we have to perform
[49:16] as priests we have certain authorities
[49:18] that we have as kings right now we have
[49:21] dominion being made Kings and there's
[49:23] certain things that we give service to
[49:24] right now being Kings but it's saying we
[49:26] we give this we've been made Kings and
[49:28] Priests and we give him all glory and
[49:30] Dominion forever and ever amen and Paul
[49:33] says this to Timothy second Timothy 2:12
[49:35] like I said like I'm reading from a
[49:37] script these are all very obvious places
[49:39] to go if we suffer we shall also reign
[49:41] with him if we deny him he also will
[49:43] deny us that's right we have been
[49:46] promised to sit with him in a throne we
[49:49] have been promised to be heir of all
[49:51] things power apart from character is
[49:54] satanic so we must suffer if we're going
[49:56] going to rain if we are going to be
[49:59] granted possession of an
[50:02] inheritance God is going to ensure that
[50:04] when he gives you that full right and
[50:06] full Authority you're mature enough to
[50:08] handle
[50:10] it there are certain rules are
[50:13] uh uh parameters built into Family Trust
[50:16] where to my daughter I give a billion
[50:20] dollars when she turns
[50:22] 25 and has has a doctorate in financial
[50:27] management it's like but until then you
[50:29] can't get a penny of it and it's written
[50:31] right in and the one who's the the the
[50:33] trustee over that estate is going to say
[50:35] I'm sorry you don't have your doctorate
[50:37] yet yeah you're 25 but you've got it's
[50:39] it's built into the trust so that you
[50:42] don't squander your inheritance and
[50:44] there's ways and even God went to such
[50:46] great links in the Old Testament to show
[50:49] that God in his wisdom demonstrated the
[50:52] value of the inheritance to where he had
[50:55] laws built in it that someone was
[50:57] foolish and lost it the family could
[50:59] still get it back CU that's how much he
[51:02] values The Inheritance how much he
[51:05] values The
[51:06] Possession and so God is saying if we're
[51:09] going to Reign he wants to perfect our
[51:12] character he does not have a program
[51:14] where you're born again on Sunday night
[51:16] or maybe it's Saturday night that's when
[51:18] everybody gets born again but you don't
[51:19] get born again on the main night of the
[51:21] camp meeting and the next day you're the
[51:23] one that's going to get up there and go
[51:24] all right come on somebody let me cast
[51:26] out a demon I though you could have all
[51:30] authority given to you in the name of
[51:32] Jesus Christ and you have every right to
[51:34] testify and you can go out and preach
[51:36] the gospel we still recognize and
[51:38] realize that that person has not been
[51:41] cultivated and grown and matured and
[51:43] learned and been seasoned
[51:46] out brother bandam deals with it so
[51:48] often in the message I don't feel like I
[51:49] need to go down that line to make myself
[51:52] clear on this but we've got to re if
[51:54] we're going to Reign we must be taught
[51:55] we must be trained we've got to
[51:58] suffer and if you're not suffering maybe
[52:00] you're not
[52:01] listening if you're not suffering maybe
[52:03] you're not
[52:06] learning would ever want to take away
[52:08] someone's sunship I would say oh well
[52:10] because we're Sons he sent forth his
[52:12] spirit because you are seed you can be
[52:14] born again to him gave you power to
[52:17] become the sons of God not that you
[52:19] weren't already elect not that you
[52:20] weren't in his mind before but the power
[52:23] I believe for everyone here I believe it
[52:25] for my children I believe it for your
[52:26] children children I believe for those
[52:27] who are lost and Wayward now that
[52:29] there's a life germ seed inside of them
[52:31] that if it could just fight away all the
[52:33] muck and mire that's been built around
[52:35] it they can be quickened to life
[52:37] manifest sunship daughter of God and
[52:40] begin to grow in the grace of God learn
[52:42] and Obey and
[52:43] become real
[52:46] Christians so we have been made Kings
[52:48] and Priests in order to fully step into
[52:51] that office and function as a king that
[52:53] can Reign we must suffer right
[52:57] then Revelations chapter
[52:59] 5 Vincent is your license plate
[53:01] Revelations chapter 5 is it verse
[53:04] 5 I've already I said I got dibs if he
[53:06] ever gets rid of it I love
[53:09] it and this is after the book has been
[53:11] taken and the seals have been opened
[53:13] we'll come back to verse 5 in a second
[53:14] it says and they sung a new song saying
[53:16] Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to
[53:18] open the seals thereof for thou was
[53:19] slain and has redeemed us to God by the
[53:22] blood by thy blood out of every Kindred
[53:24] and tongue and people and Nation now if
[53:26] you go back and read some of these
[53:27] things we've been reading in Hebrews you
[53:28] just see how this beautiful fabric woven
[53:31] together of Christ the perfect one who
[53:33] by his own blood has purged our sins and
[53:36] was made higher than the angels to his
[53:38] own obedience this beautiful hymn that's
[53:40] being sung out and hath made us unto our
[53:43] God Kings and Priests that's exactly
[53:46] what he said in Revelations
[53:47] 1:6 and we shall reign on the
[53:52] earth he hath made us Kings and Priests
[53:55] under our God I would say right now your
[53:58] Kings and Priests don't take anything
[54:01] away from it but then it says and now we
[54:03] shall reign on the earth now we can take
[54:07] full possession now we can have full
[54:09] Authority why because verse five and one
[54:12] of the Elder saith unto me weep not
[54:13] Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah
[54:15] the root of David hath prevailed to open
[54:19] the book and to loose the Seven Seals
[54:21] thereof that word there prevailed I know
[54:23] Prevail sounds more like that might he's
[54:25] prevailed
[54:27] right he's prevailed he's conquered but
[54:28] it says he hath overcome to open the
[54:32] book same word he ha overcome to to open
[54:35] the book and to him that overcometh will
[54:38] I grant so instead of always saying well
[54:40] I'm just an overcomer I'm just an
[54:42] overcomer and if it makes it seem like
[54:43] we're just barely getting by I want you
[54:45] to start saying I'm a prevailer because
[54:48] the lion of the tribe of Judah hath
[54:50] prevailed to take the book and I believe
[54:52] that God has called you and is
[54:54] encouraging you as sons and of God to
[54:57] not just in your mind get over something
[55:00] but Prevail I'm a
[55:03] prevailer and we have been told in this
[55:05] day that the in the days of the voice of
[55:07] the seventh angel when he shall begin to
[55:08] sound the mystery of God should be
[55:10] finished perfected as yet declared to
[55:12] his servants the prophets and John in
[55:15] Revelations 10: 7-1 he's caught up in
[55:17] this and the voice which I heard from
[55:18] Heaven spake unto me again and said go
[55:21] and take the little book which is open
[55:22] in the hand of the Angel which standed
[55:23] upon the sea and upon the
[55:25] Earth and when we were when we're
[55:27] children you know what we would say yeah
[55:30] when I'm done with
[55:33] this okay right if we're a child what do
[55:36] we do we just put it off go go take this
[55:40] book I I just uh children is it okay if
[55:43] I just Bear My
[55:45] Heart Is it okay I can't tell you how
[55:48] many times everybody's getting nervous
[55:50] for my
[55:52] kids never mind I I'll use uh I'll use
[55:54] brother Michael Jenkins kids as an
[55:57] example I can only guess how many times
[55:59] Rowan's been asked to do something 3
[56:02] hours later it's like hey did you get
[56:04] that done and R's like what what I ask
[56:07] you to do oh I
[56:09] forgot never happened has it yeah see I
[56:12] was wrong so let's go back to my kids I
[56:14] can't tell you how many times it happens
[56:16] when you ask somebody ask one of your
[56:17] children to do something and they forget
[56:19] and you know why because they put it
[56:22] off they don't do it
[56:24] immediately this is what OB be means to
[56:26] do something
[56:27] willfully to do something out of love
[56:30] for God and notice what John
[56:32] demonstrates he says go and take the
[56:34] little book which is open in the hand of
[56:35] the Angel which stand upon the sea and
[56:36] upon the Earth and I went un the angel
[56:38] and said to him give me the little book
[56:40] there's your obedience this is what God
[56:42] wants the Bride of Jesus Christ to come
[56:43] to that way that she packs out his
[56:45] commands she has thus sayith the Lord or
[56:47] keep still what you you have some people
[56:49] running with what they called thus say
[56:51] the lord they're just a bunch of false
[56:52] prophets and then you have other people
[56:54] that just keep sitting still
[56:56] disregarding the real thus sayith the
[56:57] Lord and we've got to have a bride that
[57:00] won't be false prophets but won't also
[57:02] be led to sleep and be starchy and do
[57:04] nothing but a bride that has the mind of
[57:06] Christ to know not what he wants said
[57:08] about the word but what he wants done
[57:10] with the word prevails is what he
[57:13] wants so he goes he says give me the
[57:16] book and now there's a special
[57:17] conversation take it and eat it up amen
[57:20] notice how much more opens up when you
[57:23] obey what is it the angel wants you to
[57:25] yeah he wants me to go take the book he
[57:27] wants me to take the book so we think
[57:29] it's all about taking the book but it's
[57:30] not until you take the book that he
[57:32] tells you what to do next it's not when
[57:35] you have obey it's not until you've
[57:36] obeyed the first part that the next part
[57:39] unfolds take it e it up and it shall
[57:40] make thy belly bitter but it shall be in
[57:42] thy mouth sweet as honey and so John
[57:44] said well let me think about it I don't
[57:46] really have an
[57:46] appetite I took the little book out of
[57:48] the Angel's hand and I ate it
[57:51] up he did exactly what he said and it
[57:54] happened exactly as he said it what it
[57:55] was in my mouth sweet as honey and as
[57:57] soon as I had eaten it my belly was
[57:58] bitter and now he's able to prophesy
[58:02] again to many peoples and Nations and
[58:05] tongues and
[58:06] Kings this is a beautiful picture of
[58:09] what God's wanting to do when that which
[58:11] is perfect is
[58:13] come Christ was made perfect by the
[58:15] things which he
[58:16] suffered that is the one that were joint
[58:19] HS with he was made perfect he was
[58:20] brought to completion and became the
[58:23] captain of our Salvation the author and
[58:25] finisher of our faith
[58:26] and then we too are to follow in his
[58:28] steps it's the same process of training
[58:31] the same process of disciplining and as
[58:34] he prevailed to take the book we need to
[58:38] also Prevail to take the book and
[58:41] Prevail by taking the book Prevail
[58:45] because we're eating the book
[58:47] prophesying again to people's Nations
[58:50] tongues and
[58:52] Kings this is why brother Bram could say
[58:54] in the middle of 19659 I believe that
[58:56] we've been children long enough God's
[58:59] going to turn his church into manhood
[59:01] now what was it going to take it's going
[59:04] to take these things to be brought to us
[59:06] the spirit of Truth and we have played
[59:08] and frolicked as children these are
[59:11] words that are descriptive of the age of
[59:14] leody deia and not so much out in the
[59:16] world but the church move we played and
[59:19] Frolic his children is is that is that a
[59:22] a
[59:22] disc is that a a a
[59:27] is that a disparaging term a derogatory
[59:30] phrase that he's using no it's an
[59:31] observation by a
[59:33] prophet we're children when I was a
[59:35] child speak as a child we've expected
[59:38] these things and the way if if the
[59:40] restoration of the gifts brother the
[59:42] last order of the Reformation if the new
[59:44] birth is comprised of justification
[59:45] sanctification and the baptism of the
[59:47] Holy Ghost what would you expect to get
[59:51] babes it proved that it had worked it
[59:54] proved that God was restoring he says
[59:56] but we've played and Frolic as children
[59:57] we've seen enough gifts we've seen
[59:59] enough things happening we've heard
[1:00:00] enough word we got to come to a place
[1:00:02] where now God wants to turn his church
[1:00:04] into manhood and I believe that brother
[1:00:07] Brandon when he tells us that we're in
[1:00:08] adoption time and he tells us we've
[1:00:10] turned a corner and we come to these
[1:00:12] great things that transpire into
[1:00:13] Revelations 10 and Revelations 5 that
[1:00:15] it's telling us that we're no longer in
[1:00:17] the age of reformation that we're no
[1:00:19] longer under the cycle of Revival and
[1:00:21] death but we've come to Capstone time
[1:00:24] that's why he said it's not a
[1:00:25] Pentecostal age it's not the L to age
[1:00:27] it's the bright age because we've come
[1:00:29] to the age of the consummation we've
[1:00:31] come to the age of completion and if you
[1:00:33] try to reject that or redefine it you
[1:00:36] miss the whole purpose of the
[1:00:38] message and this is why you'll see waves
[1:00:40] I haven't been in the message long
[1:00:42] enough to know this 49 years old and and
[1:00:46] and and ministering as long as I have
[1:00:48] and serving God as long as I have I
[1:00:49] don't have half the knowledge a lot of
[1:00:51] these guys have but I've learned from
[1:00:52] them and they've told me the stories and
[1:00:54] they've demonstrated even the
[1:00:56] testimonies of their own church that
[1:00:57] they emphasized the gifts and they tried
[1:00:59] to teach the gifts and they made a big
[1:01:01] huge mess so they had to pull back and
[1:01:02] they had to bring everybody back into
[1:01:04] order and and and emphasize this and
[1:01:06] change that and sick and tired of Unholy
[1:01:08] all this ungodly living and everything
[1:01:10] and they have to do this and do that and
[1:01:11] then it go right back into the same
[1:01:13] thing again right back into the mess
[1:01:16] again because you don't recognize the
[1:01:18] age you're
[1:01:19] in that this is the age of adoption this
[1:01:21] is the age of
[1:01:23] maturity and not every age has been the
[1:01:25] age of
[1:01:26] adoption every age was the age of the
[1:01:28] Holy Ghost for the True Believer but
[1:01:30] this is the only age where it comes to
[1:01:33] that
[1:01:34] fullness he says and we played and
[1:01:36] frolicked as children but now we're
[1:01:38] going to have to put away childish
[1:01:39] things and take on manhood maturity not
[1:01:42] putting away yourself you're not putting
[1:01:44] away what God's made you it doesn't mean
[1:01:45] you're putting the gifts on the Shelf so
[1:01:47] to speak as some people paraphrase and
[1:01:49] it's not that they don't have a place
[1:01:51] because I still hope we're birthing
[1:01:53] children as I said I Believe on or maybe
[1:01:56] it was last Wednesday I I hope that
[1:01:57] there's births and I hope when people
[1:01:58] are being birthed we don't look down on
[1:02:00] them and say well you know I've been in
[1:02:01] this message for 50 years and we just
[1:02:03] don't act that way well let them maybe
[1:02:06] you should have when you came in the
[1:02:07] message
[1:02:08] before let let's not get so starchy
[1:02:11] about it but and be mature enough and
[1:02:14] and have enough Integrity that once
[1:02:16] those children have played in Frolic
[1:02:18] long enough they know where the goods
[1:02:20] are to grow they know where the word is
[1:02:23] that can teach them and instruct them to
[1:02:25] overcome
[1:02:31] let's Stand Together
