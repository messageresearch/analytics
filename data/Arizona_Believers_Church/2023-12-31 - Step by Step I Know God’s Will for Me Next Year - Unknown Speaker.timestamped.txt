[0:00] I trust you'll be able to kind of stick
[0:02] with me and just hold real tight to the
[0:04] subject matter. We had a really
[0:06] wonderful time in worship and we just
[0:07] have one service today. So, we'll just
[0:09] give our all to it. If we're not able to
[0:12] finish this year, u maybe we'll just
[0:14] pick up the subject next year. But we
[0:16] wanted to share something with you that
[0:18] would kind of have a little bit of a a
[0:20] New Year's theme to it, if we could put
[0:22] it that way, and minister on things that
[0:25] would be an encouragement to you that
[0:27] would uh hopefully give you some
[0:29] practical principles or just simple
[0:32] thoughts in the word of God that you
[0:33] say, "All right, that's something I
[0:35] could take and I can use uh this
[0:37] afternoon or tomorrow." And even though
[0:38] we may not be very explicit in these
[0:41] precepts, I think there's just some
[0:43] general propositions we're making today
[0:45] that you can say, "Yeah, that that's a
[0:47] guiding principle. That's something that
[0:49] I could utilize uh in my daily life."
[0:51] And we're calling it step by step. And I
[0:54] wanting to take that from these certain
[0:56] scriptures that talk about taking
[0:58] footsteps. And as we ministered a series
[1:00] at the beginning of the year on um I I I
[1:03] know the will of God for me this year.
[1:06] and we were taking it uh kind of forward
[1:08] looking into the new year. I want to
[1:10] take it I know God's will for me next
[1:12] year just kind of transition from the
[1:14] 31st into the 1st to say just be
[1:16] reminded of all these things that we've
[1:19] know and have been taught in the word of
[1:21] God. So I'd like to give a little bit of
[1:23] kind of a cliche and this might be some
[1:25] lowhanging fruit or a trope that you
[1:27] probably get cringe over but just look
[1:30] at the year in review as we did the year
[1:32] in preview. I think that was the title
[1:33] or I know that was the title of our
[1:35] series the year in preview and took
[1:37] things from the word of God to say these
[1:39] are things I know is that that are God's
[1:42] will for me this year thing six things
[1:44] that we could be doing all the time to
[1:46] know I'm in his will by doing these
[1:48] things and so I'll just run through
[1:50] these real quickly we separated them out
[1:52] into two categories each one having
[1:54] three for six total but as it relates to
[1:58] our togetherness as a body of Christ as
[2:00] a local church and our relationship ship
[2:02] to one another and even our duty in the
[2:04] scripture. There was a few things that
[2:06] we identified as things that we know we
[2:08] can be doing to please the Lord and it
[2:10] was to attend church and to contribute
[2:13] in our giving as far as tithes and
[2:15] offerings and then also to support
[2:17] missions. And we took it from the
[2:19] standpoint that it is our duty as
[2:21] Christians to the word of God to to
[2:23] gather ourselves together. And we saw
[2:25] that very clearly in the word of God and
[2:27] that in gathering uh we have a
[2:29] prescription in the word of God to give
[2:31] and to give from our hearts and to give
[2:33] according to the word of God. And then
[2:35] we added that third part and it's
[2:37] scriptural. We see it in the word of God
[2:38] to support missions. And what I uh liked
[2:42] about it is these things kind of work
[2:43] together that if you're if you're coming
[2:45] to church and fellowshipping and in the
[2:46] word of God and getting to know one
[2:48] another, it kind of builds uh a
[2:50] faithfulness even in your giving. And
[2:52] once you've been able to establish a
[2:54] rhythm in those things, then you could
[2:56] actually begin to support beyond
[2:58] yourself locally. Uh we're not a
[3:00] missions organization. If we were, we'd
[3:02] kind of just shut this part down and
[3:03] tell you to give all the gas money you
[3:05] used to come here and all the money you
[3:07] spend on meals afterwards and all your
[3:08] tithes and offerings and everything. We
[3:10] wouldn't need it for this and we would
[3:11] just collect funds as a missionary
[3:13] organization and send it overseas. But
[3:15] that's not God's that's not God's will.
[3:18] And so as you do these other two things,
[3:20] it's kind of a this supporting missions
[3:22] and looking beyond your own borders is
[3:25] kind of the outcome and the product of
[3:26] our faithfulness in these other two
[3:28] things. We're faithful in coming to
[3:30] church. faithful in our giving. It
[3:32] allows us to be able to do things beyond
[3:34] our Jerusalem around the world to
[3:37] support other needs. And I was going to
[3:39] take some time maybe this morning to
[3:40] show pictures of uh churches that we
[3:43] help put windows on and missionaries
[3:44] we've supported and the works and
[3:46] printing things overseas and all these
[3:48] different things this church has been
[3:50] doing. But I thought maybe we'd save it
[3:51] for the new year. But there's just a lot
[3:53] of things that we can be doing as we're
[3:55] faithful. we see this product and this
[3:57] consequence of the the momentum we have
[4:00] in the word of God. And there's a lot
[4:02] that can be said on this and it it just
[4:04] relates to this right here. The coming
[4:05] together as a body of believers in our
[4:07] hearts believing that we're part of a
[4:09] church here and God's brought us
[4:10] together. These are things that are
[4:12] God's will for us. And then we what I
[4:15] would say is the most important part or
[4:18] these three things that relate to more
[4:20] of our personal lives and our lives away
[4:22] from church. And let me say this, the
[4:24] attending church part to me is for the
[4:28] purpose of supporting this part. Uh
[4:30] you're not going home and living good
[4:32] lives at home so that you can make our
[4:34] church look good when you show up at
[4:35] church and so that you represent our
[4:37] church well and you represent your
[4:39] pastor well and you represent my
[4:40] ministry well. Has nothing to do with it
[4:42] at all. As a matter of fact, what we do
[4:44] here is for the purpose of representing
[4:46] you well and supporting you and lifting
[4:48] you up so that you can live an
[4:50] overcoming life uh and and be a
[4:52] testimony to your community and your
[4:53] neighborhood. And these are three things
[4:55] we could say are God's will for us
[4:58] without a doubt. And we outlined them as
[5:00] sanctifying your home. Looked at that in
[5:03] the context of applying the token. And
[5:05] then as we uh move the world out, we
[5:08] bring the word in. And this should be
[5:09] something that's part of a regular
[5:10] discipline. whatever interval you might
[5:12] have as a family. I think some rhythm is
[5:14] important and doing it frequently is
[5:16] good to gather around the word. There's
[5:18] a lot of things that are very easy to
[5:20] gather around and there's no resistance.
[5:22] There's no reluctance for it. I think in
[5:24] our family if we promised Freddy's or
[5:26] something like that on a regular basis,
[5:28] everybody would be up for it. Uh even if
[5:30] it was open 24/7, you could probably get
[5:32] everybody in the car and off of the K.
[5:34] When I say everybody, you'd have to drag
[5:36] Sister Elizabeth and I. But Elliot could
[5:38] just tell the Tesla, "Drive me to the
[5:39] nearest Freddy's." And they could show
[5:41] up and eat all. They do it every time.
[5:43] They say, "Let's grab the Bible. Let's
[5:44] pray. Let's read." There's always a
[5:46] there's always friction there. It's
[5:47] always tough, but it's important for us
[5:49] to gather around the word. And then I
[5:51] look at this as kind of a consequence
[5:53] and the fruit of a sanctified home that
[5:55] gathers around the word. You start
[5:57] looking outside of yourself and you can
[5:59] live for others, which is perfectly
[6:01] eternal life. So each one of these, the
[6:03] attending church, contributing, the
[6:05] gathering around the word as an assembly
[6:07] allows us to minister beyond our borders
[6:09] and beyond our walls. And then
[6:11] sanctifying your home, gathered around
[6:13] the word creates and cultivates an
[6:15] atmosphere of unselfishness to live for
[6:18] others, whether it be others in your own
[6:20] family, others in the church. There's a
[6:22] lot of things uh that we could use to
[6:24] point that out. But it's kind of the
[6:25] consequence or the fruit of doing doing
[6:28] the first two. So, I'd say, "Let's not
[6:30] start with number three on both of
[6:31] these." I say, "Well, let's just we want
[6:32] to support missions or we we want to
[6:34] live for others. Do these other things
[6:36] first." And it puts you in a in a a path
[6:39] and it puts you in a rhythm to be able
[6:41] to do more for God. That was kind of
[6:43] part of the underlying theme was people
[6:46] want to do great things for God, but
[6:47] they don't want to do the little things
[6:48] that God has asked of them in order to
[6:51] do the great things and be used of God.
[6:52] So, there's a lot of real rich
[6:54] principles that we could use in our
[6:56] daily lives. And so these six things are
[7:00] part of God's will for us. And I say
[7:02] part because I know there's a lot more
[7:03] to it. And then there's very specific
[7:05] individual things that we may be called
[7:07] to do, but they all have a reason in
[7:09] doing it. There's a purpose or as we see
[7:11] there's an outcome from doing it where
[7:13] God's not just asking you to do
[7:15] something so that you could check a box.
[7:16] It's not Catholicism where you did the
[7:18] stations, but God has a very practical
[7:21] uh output that he wants to see or that
[7:24] he can give you by doing that. The
[7:26] statement uh introduces a a a saying
[7:30] that I want to come back to later on
[7:33] seek ye first the kingdom of God and
[7:35] bring that out of Matthew 6. But brother
[7:36] Brandham preaching witnesses says seek
[7:38] ye first the kingdom of God. Have you
[7:40] ever witnessed that to be the truth?
[7:43] Amen.
[7:43] He says put God first. Pay your tithes
[7:46] first. Pay everything first. Uh pay God.
[7:48] Pray first at morning. Pray all through
[7:50] the day. Give God the first place in
[7:52] everything. You'll be a witness. This is
[7:54] one of those scriptures we or quotes
[7:56] that we used when we did this series on
[7:57] how there's a certain emphasis on doing
[8:00] the right thing and doing it first and
[8:02] letting the word have preeminence. And
[8:04] he says you ought to uh put God first,
[8:06] give God the first place in everything.
[8:08] He says you'll be a witness. You'll be
[8:10] the appropriate reflection of the word
[8:13] of God. You'll be an ambassador. You'll
[8:14] be a billboard a and you'll be an
[8:17] accurate representation of what the word
[8:19] stands for. No matter what you say, if
[8:22] you're not doing these things and
[8:23] actually putting God first, then then
[8:26] there's you're not going to accurately
[8:28] portray a Christian. And if I could say
[8:31] this, I don't even know if I ever
[8:33] expressed this, but I was just even
[8:34] going back through some of the things I
[8:36] was writing down at the end of the year
[8:37] last year as God was dealing with me on
[8:40] that subject and kind of this year in
[8:43] preview and these six different things.
[8:45] My original burden was to inspire just
[8:48] Lord help me as a pastor to inspire a
[8:50] greater faithfulness. Uh I just don't
[8:53] want the discipline
[8:55] of coming to church and just getting
[8:56] into a rhythm of church things and we
[8:58] just become very churchy. My desire was
[9:00] to inspire greater faithfulness to and
[9:03] an engagement with the word there. Some
[9:05] it's something living. It's something
[9:06] real. It's something that transcends
[9:08] just the the dynamics of a local
[9:10] assembly. And just inspire it. inspire
[9:12] faithfulness to attendance and tithing
[9:14] and and supporting missions. And you all
[9:16] have done a wonderful job on those
[9:18] things and and then doing all that so
[9:20] that we could have the kind of teaching
[9:22] and ministry here to be able to
[9:24] encourage you and give you the resources
[9:26] you need to sanctify your home, gather
[9:28] around the word, live for others. So to
[9:29] me just all working together I thought
[9:31] Lord how can we inspire uh a greater
[9:34] faithfulness to the word of God and
[9:36] engagement interaction in the word of
[9:38] God so that those who are gifted and
[9:40] those who are called to certain
[9:41] positions and those who have even maybe
[9:44] a place that they need to be and I'll
[9:45] even say it this way that if you're here
[9:47] in the perfect will of God but
[9:49] ultimately his will is going to move you
[9:51] somewhere else then I want to provide
[9:53] the resources so that you can follow the
[9:55] path that God has for you and place you
[9:58] where you need to be because as much as
[10:00] I love you, I don't want you out of the
[10:02] will of God by being here.
[10:05] I I I just don't know that we would ever
[10:07] want to compromise that way. And just
[10:10] believe that if it's God's perfect will
[10:11] for you, we want it for you. We want to
[10:13] see you succeed. And that was really at
[10:15] the heart of of of these things and that
[10:18] whole series as we're kind of looking at
[10:20] it in review. And it's these things are
[10:22] for your own spiritual development.
[10:24] Amen.
[10:25] And and for your uh and for your own
[10:27] spiritual well-being individually, your
[10:29] spiritual well-being, your spiritual
[10:30] development as an individual, but also
[10:32] for your families. A and whether you be
[10:35] just a young newlywed couple or whether
[10:37] or not you be single uh or your
[10:39] grandparents or wherever you may be in
[10:40] life. Uh there's things those things are
[10:43] a part of our lives as Christians and
[10:46] ways that we can be faithful to the word
[10:47] of God, giving him access to our hearts
[10:50] to change things in our lives and for
[10:52] our own spiritual development and
[10:53] well-being.
[10:54] And so I want to use the statement
[10:56] hopefully to use this as a little bit of
[10:57] a a transition now into step by step.
[11:02] And I want to introduce now another
[11:04] theme to seek ye first the kingdom of
[11:06] God. And now another principle is in the
[11:09] great commission. You just be what you
[11:11] are. It's a very important principle
[11:14] because we're wired to compare. We see
[11:16] one person doing one thing and we feel
[11:17] like, oh, that's the right thing to do.
[11:19] And we could admire other believers. We
[11:21] could look up to them. We can see their
[11:22] example and their testimony. Their
[11:24] spirit bears witness with ours. And so,
[11:26] they're they're natured a certain way
[11:27] and they do things really, really well.
[11:29] And you go, "Oh, I want to do that,
[11:31] too." And trust me, there's things that
[11:33] godly people do that we want to aspire
[11:36] to do. And you're we're just not natured
[11:38] that way. We're just not gifted that
[11:39] way. And you'll try it and you'll fail.
[11:42] Amen.
[11:42] And you'll and then you'll get
[11:44] discouraged. So, it's just important to
[11:45] be what you are. If you're not the type
[11:47] of person to do certain things and you
[11:49] see someone doing it, thank God there's
[11:51] someone that God has called and burdened
[11:53] and blessed to do it so you don't have
[11:54] to.
[11:55] Right? There's certain people we want
[11:57] helping in certain areas because they do
[11:58] it really, really well. And if you're
[12:00] not gifted in that way, you don't want
[12:02] to be doing it. You want to find what
[12:03] you are and be who you are.
[12:06] Just be what you are. God wants you the
[12:08] way he made you and just keep that in
[12:11] mind and be just what and that kind of
[12:13] trails. It's a fragment, but maybe he
[12:16] was gonna say just be what God called
[12:18] you to be. Be what you're supposed to
[12:19] be. And he says if it's a doormat, be a
[12:22] doormat.
[12:24] Uh it reminds me of a time when a
[12:25] delivery driver came by our house and
[12:27] knocked on the door and then was walking
[12:28] away and um and my brother Matthew
[12:31] answered the door, looked out and the
[12:32] guy looked back and says, "It's by the
[12:33] doormat." And he goes, "How did you know
[12:35] my name?" He's like, "No, the doormat."
[12:40] And so he says, "If you want to be a
[12:42] door," he says, "If it's a doormat, be a
[12:44] doormat." I want to be the best doormat
[12:48] he ever had.
[12:49] Kind of reminds me of the testimony of,
[12:51] you know, be the best bum you can be. If
[12:53] you're going to be something, be the
[12:54] best. But now it's more in line with not
[12:57] what you want to be, but what he wants
[12:59] you to be. I want to be the best doormat
[13:01] he ever had. If I have to be the doormat
[13:04] or whatever it is in the house of God, I
[13:07] love that. Whatever it is in the house
[13:08] of God, let me serve my office the best
[13:12] that I can for him.
[13:15] That's another theme. If you want to
[13:16] just kind of jot it down and whatever,
[13:17] however you take notes, if you have
[13:19] columns, if there's different ways that
[13:20] you do it, that's that's another one I
[13:22] want you to key in on. This is brother
[13:24] saying, "Whatever he wants you to be,
[13:25] you be the best." If he wants you to be,
[13:28] be the best. So we ought to have some
[13:30] ambition as Christians, as message
[13:32] believers to not just be good message
[13:34] believers and maybe not even to be
[13:36] message believers alone, whether it be
[13:38] good, better or best, but we want to be
[13:40] the best uh that he has called us to be.
[13:43] Not just be satisfied with the status
[13:45] quo and being very static, but we want
[13:47] to step by step be if we can say we're
[13:51] good, then we're good getting better.
[13:54] And it's step by step from good to
[13:56] better till we take that last step into
[13:58] perfection to our better has become
[14:00] best. And as we look back on this past
[14:03] year, I'm sure there's a lot of things
[14:04] that we look back on and I think brother
[14:05] Brandham even makes reference to this in
[14:08] the new year sometimes where we may look
[14:10] back with a lot of regrets and we go,
[14:12] "Oh, I did this and I did that." And
[14:13] often times it's our regrets that kind
[14:15] of form our vision for the future. I I
[14:18] regret gaining this much weight. I
[14:19] regret doing this habit. I regret that I
[14:21] didn't do this. I regret that I didn't
[14:23] do that. So, we make a lot of promises
[14:24] in the new year of the things that we
[14:26] want to change. And I believe that we
[14:28] ought to have um a discipline in our
[14:30] hearts and a desire in our hearts, not
[14:32] in that carnal way of turning over a new
[14:34] leaf and a and New Year's resolutions,
[14:37] but say, "Lord, what is it that I can do
[14:39] better?
[14:40] How can I do better to serve you as a
[14:43] husband or as a as a son in the home, as
[14:46] a as one that attends church or
[14:48] interacts with the community, whatever
[14:49] it might be? Lord, how can I better
[14:51] serve you so that we could take another
[14:53] step from where we you're good. You're
[14:55] doing great. I can say to you all uh and
[14:58] the and in the presence of witnesses
[14:59] today of our visitors that as a church,
[15:02] you all are the cream of the crop.
[15:03] You're doing awesome in your attendance,
[15:05] in your giving, in your faithfulness, in
[15:06] your supporting for missions. I I I
[15:09] haven't done any audits on your homes,
[15:10] but just based upon your lives around
[15:12] us, you're sanctifying your homes just
[15:14] by your conversations. We see you're
[15:16] gathering around the word and we see it
[15:18] in the nature of the hearts of the
[15:19] people to live for others. You all are
[15:21] doing awesome. You're doing wonderful.
[15:23] And with that in in our hearts and our
[15:25] minds, let's not get complacent. said,
[15:27] "Lord, if this is all about uh uh
[15:30] progress and this is all about outcome
[15:32] and fruits, and as I do these things,
[15:34] let it get better and let it step by
[15:36] step be my best cuz I want to do be the
[15:39] best." He says, "The best that I can for
[15:42] him." And there's some that we could say
[15:45] that as long as you know you're given
[15:46] your best.
[15:48] I think we find this principle is even
[15:50] true in child development that what you
[15:52] want to encourage and promote in your
[15:54] children is not that they're smart or
[15:55] that they're talented, but they tried
[15:57] their hardest
[15:58] and that they did their best. And if one
[16:00] a child does something and you look at
[16:02] it and this one draws something and then
[16:03] the other one draws something, you're
[16:05] like, "Well, I know what this is. That's
[16:06] really really really good. I don't know
[16:07] what this is." you by comparison, you
[16:10] could really destroy the confidence in
[16:12] the one and maybe inflate the one of the
[16:14] other to where you say, "Did you try
[16:16] your best? Did you give it all? Did you
[16:17] follow instructions in a way that you
[16:19] encourage that?" Because that kind of
[16:21] mindset is what's going to produce
[16:23] success. And so, we're not comparing
[16:25] ourselves to others, but we're just
[16:26] asking ourselves, am I doing what I know
[16:29] I can do within the power that God has
[16:31] given me to be my best for him?
[16:34] Now in Psalms 119 verse 133 as we were
[16:38] reading in here
[16:40] uh in this passage and I don't know how
[16:42] much maybe we'll go back and capture
[16:43] some of these other parts but I wanted
[16:44] to use this and so I felt that that
[16:47] would be a good text to take. He says
[16:50] David I think maybe is the one that this
[16:52] is attributed to order my steps in thy
[16:55] word and let not any iniquity I love how
[16:58] he says any iniquity have dominion over
[17:01] me. He's expressing a strong desire for
[17:04] revelation and I I I want to know your
[17:08] will for my life. I want to know your
[17:11] word. I want to understand your
[17:12] precepts. And it would have been easy in
[17:14] those days for a student of the law to
[17:17] have the text and just uh you know just
[17:19] read it a a and know what it says. But
[17:22] what he's expressing is that I want what
[17:24] I know to be written to be translated
[17:27] into an understanding and spiritual
[17:29] knowledge so I can do the right things
[17:30] in the right moment. It was a it was a a
[17:34] strong desire not only for revelation
[17:35] but a desire to go forward because he
[17:37] says steps I want to move forward
[17:40] correctly. I want to move forward
[17:41] righteously.
[17:43] Order my steps means make them firm so
[17:46] I'm not stumbling that they're not
[17:47] halting. I'm I'm not tripping up. I'm
[17:50] not complacent. Uh I'm not being slowed.
[17:53] So want to order my steps so I'm
[17:55] stepping in a way that allows me to keep
[17:57] going forward. Because maybe sometimes
[17:59] we see, well, I need to go this
[18:00] direction. But we step in a way to where
[18:02] we're losing momentum. We're bumping
[18:03] into things. We're not taking the clear
[18:05] path. And we want, he said, order my
[18:07] steps, my motions, and my actions. Order
[18:10] them that they might be according to thy
[18:12] word, which we know his word is his
[18:14] will.
[18:15] Amen.
[18:15] This speaks of an ambition. This speaks
[18:18] of a desire.
[18:19] I came across so many different
[18:22] statements. I just want to be able to
[18:23] kind of pepper these in and I hope they
[18:25] find the right spot. But I was reading
[18:27] where brother Brandham in the sermon
[18:28] faith once delivered to the saints. He's
[18:30] talking about how these services is
[18:31] coming up and there's something in the
[18:33] afternoon. A and he he wanted to keep
[18:35] himself uh committed and to himself. He
[18:38] says, "I like to be a little alone later
[18:39] in the afternoon when the service would
[18:41] be going here." And so there was a
[18:43] service going on, but he had a
[18:44] commitment to minister. And so he wanted
[18:46] to be alone so that I could pray and
[18:48] concentrate and wait for that service
[18:50] tomorrow night. It's uh speaks to
[18:53] something. Now he's taking this serious.
[18:54] He's in a series of meetings. there's
[18:56] going to be a service taking place in
[18:58] the afternoon and the next day he's
[18:59] preaching in the evening. He says, "I
[19:01] want to I I won't be able to come to
[19:03] that service that afternoon." He says,
[19:05] "Cuz I want to be the best."
[19:07] Amen.
[19:08] I want to do my best. I want to be found
[19:11] doing my best to pray, to concentrate,
[19:13] to get ready, to prepare, to minister
[19:15] the next night. I want to be found doing
[19:17] my best. What time I have left, I want
[19:20] it every hour to count for Christ. I
[19:23] purposed in my heart by the grace of God
[19:25] to do everything that I know how for the
[19:27] kingdom of God and the coming of Christ.
[19:29] Likewise, this ought to be our purpose.
[19:31] I if I could put it this way, the way
[19:33] this doveetailed for me is David says,
[19:35] "Order my steps in thy word." Brother
[19:38] saying, "I want to be my best. I want to
[19:40] be doing found doing my best." What
[19:42] better can there be except to do what
[19:44] God wants us to do.
[19:46] That would be the best thing we could
[19:47] do. I wanted to be the best. I want to
[19:51] do my best. I want to be found doing my
[19:54] best. With what time he had left, he
[19:56] wanted to to count for Christ. He
[19:58] purposed in his heart to do everything
[20:00] that he knew how for the kingdom of God
[20:01] and the coming of Christ.
[20:04] Order my steps in thy word.
[20:08] And it's a request that's made known to
[20:10] God. It's a lifting up to the Lord
[20:12] because it's this isn't something we
[20:15] figure out on our own where we're going
[20:17] to sit back and be like, "Oh, let's just
[20:18] kind of sit down and let's just map out
[20:20] 2024 a little bit and let's just put
[20:22] together a bucket list and let's put
[20:24] together some sort of paradigm of the
[20:25] things that we want to be able to do and
[20:26] accomplish uh for the year." Uh this is
[20:29] something that you ask God to direct you
[20:31] in or it's something that you go back to
[20:33] the word of God to find the framework
[20:35] within which you're going to operate.
[20:38] There may be something God wants you to
[20:39] do, but you can't just do it any way you
[20:42] want to. You got to do God's will God's
[20:44] way.
[20:46] You have to do it that way. Well, get
[20:47] the ark back where it belongs. Okay,
[20:49] well, let's just put it on a cart. No,
[20:51] you've got to do God's will his way.
[20:53] Amen.
[20:54] And in Jeremiah 10:es 23- 24, it says,
[20:58] "Oh Lord, I know that the way of man is
[21:01] not in himself.
[21:03] It is not in man that walketh to direct
[21:07] his steps.
[21:09] Lord, correct me, but with judgment, not
[21:12] in thine anger, lest thou bring me to
[21:14] nothing. Quite a statement that he's
[21:17] expressing here
[21:19] that I know that the way of man is not
[21:22] in himself. It is not in man that
[21:24] walketh to direct his steps.
[21:27] And it is believed that it is said of
[21:30] Nebuchadnezzar
[21:32] that he himself uh was not the master of
[21:35] his own decisions and that he wasn't a
[21:38] mastermind and tactician and one who was
[21:40] such a great king and a great military
[21:43] leader and visionary to he his prowess
[21:46] was on display in conquering nations and
[21:48] when he went to go defeat this uh
[21:51] country he changed his mind and went and
[21:52] defeated another it and basically the
[21:55] observation that's being made is God was
[21:57] using him to bring his own word to pass
[22:00] and that God had made a promise to
[22:01] Israel if they did certain things and he
[22:03] would bless them and since they weren't
[22:04] doing what they were supposed to do they
[22:06] were coming captive to these other
[22:07] nations and so Nebuchadnezzar was
[22:10] conquering and doing a lot of great
[22:11] things and he's thinking
[22:14] look at my life it's so blessed and
[22:15] everything I did in 2023 is so awesome
[22:18] and everything is good and he believed
[22:20] it was because of himself but this
[22:23] observation is made by the inspiration
[22:25] of God I know that the way of man is not
[22:27] in himself that and it is not in man
[22:29] that walketh to direct his steps. So
[22:33] there must be a humility to acknowledge
[22:36] that his his way. A humility to say this
[22:39] isn't a path of my own. This isn't a way
[22:42] that I'm a role that I'm holding on my
[22:44] own. This isn't a direction I've chosen
[22:46] for myself. But rather I have been shown
[22:48] the way and therefore I make the
[22:50] decision to take his way. that it's not
[22:53] just a matter of blazing a new trail,
[22:54] but Lord, show me the path I need to go.
[22:57] And if that's the path you need to go
[22:58] in, then you humble yourself to take his
[23:01] way. And then you credit him for giving
[23:03] the grace in your life. I say, "Well, he
[23:06] showed me the way to take. I took that
[23:07] way." And when it works out, you don't
[23:09] come out on the other side and say,
[23:11] "Man, was this not a great decision or
[23:12] what?" You say, "This was this is his
[23:15] grace."
[23:16] Could we not all admit that there's been
[23:18] a lot of things in our lives that worked
[23:19] out really, really well and God blessed
[23:21] it? And you know what?
[23:23] God looked out after us and covered us.
[23:25] I was going to say we got lucky, but uh
[23:27] don't call me lucky, call me blessed.
[23:29] Thanks, Sister Sherry. And so, there's a
[23:31] there's a thought to where we look at it
[23:33] and say, "Wow, I didn't even know what I
[23:35] was doing or I made I did that for all
[23:37] the wrong reasons, but God washed out
[23:39] over me." That's where we ought to say,
[23:40] you know what, if it was up to me, this
[23:42] would be a mess.
[23:44] But God's grace and where we have that
[23:45] humility to say, Lord, order my steps in
[23:48] your word. And as you order my steps in
[23:51] your word, Lord, I want to have the
[23:52] humility to take that
[23:54] that grace for him to show you and the
[23:56] humility for you to walk in it. And then
[23:58] when it's all done, have that kind of
[24:00] humility to come back and say, "It's the
[24:01] Lord. I didn't do this."
[24:05] The Bible speaks of how who can
[24:07] understand his errors and to be cleansed
[24:08] from secret faults.
[24:11] It says in Psalms 19:13, "Keep back thy
[24:13] servant also from presumptuous sins." Or
[24:16] you could even maybe say the sin of
[24:17] presumption, but presumptuous sins, let
[24:20] them not have dominion over me.
[24:23] This brings us back to the statement of
[24:25] let not any iniquity have dominion over
[24:27] me. order my steps in your word that all
[24:30] my motions and my actions are according
[24:32] to your will so that I'm stepping in the
[24:34] right direction so that my there's no
[24:36] secret faults and presumptuous sins that
[24:38] are keeping me or that are the result of
[24:41] not being in your will or that are
[24:43] keeping me from getting back in your
[24:45] will.
[24:47] Keep me back from presumptuous sins. Let
[24:50] them not have dominion over me. There's
[24:52] a way that these presumptuous sins have
[24:54] dominion over us to keep us from doing
[24:57] the right thing. So it goes back to Lord
[24:59] order my steps in thy word because if I
[25:01] can be in your word then no iniquity can
[25:05] have dominion over me lest I step out of
[25:08] or veer away from come out from under
[25:10] the protection of his perfect will.
[25:14] So it's a it's a a request. Lord I I I
[25:17] and maybe I should just put it this way.
[25:19] I want you to recognize the power of
[25:20] being in his will where there's no
[25:22] dominion over you by any iniquity and we
[25:25] can be kept from presumptuous sins that
[25:28] likewise have dominion.
[25:30] So he could point back to
[25:31] Nebuchadnezzar. Nebuchadnezzar got
[25:33] lifted up. He didn't have the humility
[25:36] to acknowledge uh God and his ways or he
[25:39] got lifted up in his pride because of
[25:40] things that were happening. And what did
[25:41] God do? Made him lose his mind. turned
[25:43] and acted like a beast and was eating
[25:45] grass and and there was this great uh
[25:48] transformation that took place in his
[25:50] life and he brought was brought very
[25:52] very low and it's an incredible biblical
[25:54] story but it was because he got lifted
[25:56] up in his own pride and wouldn't humble
[25:58] himself to even give God the glory
[26:02] and the sermon influence brother
[26:04] Brandham is touching on that a little
[26:06] bit and this is a very lengthy statement
[26:08] and I do recognize just the time is
[26:11] really getting away from us this
[26:14] I promise to be done this year. And in a
[26:16] sermon influenced by it, it says, "Now
[26:18] we find that this king did like so many
[26:20] Christians of today. As long as he
[26:23] stayed humble, then God blessed him."
[26:25] And we know he's uh uh not referring to
[26:27] Nebuchadnezzar right here, but he comes
[26:29] to he says, "But the Bible said here
[26:31] that when he got lifted up, when he got
[26:34] everything secured, then he become
[26:36] lifted up in his own self and then he
[26:38] was on his road out."
[26:40] So when we when we take inventory the
[26:43] things that have taken place in our
[26:44] lives and all the blessings and my we
[26:46] could just talk about all the great
[26:48] blessings that have been transpiring in
[26:49] people's lives and they thrill us and
[26:51] encourage us but let's just remember
[26:53] from whom they came and what brought it
[26:56] and what brought these things to us
[26:58] because he says he kind of looked and
[27:00] felt secured and got lifted up and even
[27:02] he could say in the things maybe that
[27:03] God's doing the things that have
[27:05] transpired the blessings that have come
[27:06] our way the job choices or whatever it
[27:08] might be that are paying off. He says he
[27:10] was once he got lifted up in himself, he
[27:12] was on the road out.
[27:15] Now, that's how it is today with
[27:16] churches. Pay very close attention so we
[27:19] can just make it applicable to
[27:20] ourselves. It's always been that when
[27:22] men feel that they have become
[27:24] sufficient, they don't have to pray
[27:26] anymore. They don't have to wait upon
[27:28] God for their ministry.
[27:30] If you'll par this expression, I agree
[27:32] with a certain writer that that's what
[27:33] has caused many of these men that's been
[27:35] in these latter-day revivals of this
[27:37] last day revival to fly to pieces.
[27:40] There's this uh overconfidence in the
[27:42] things that have been happening. A and
[27:44] even the genuine moves of God and the
[27:46] healings and the signs and wonders and
[27:47] maybe some gifted discernment or
[27:49] whatever it might be that work, they get
[27:50] lifted up in themselves even to the
[27:52] point where men will start to use a gift
[27:55] in air and refuse to acknowledge it.
[27:59] because they get lifted up. They don't
[28:01] have to pray. They don't have to wait on
[28:02] God for their ministry. It's just
[28:03] they're very carnal now. They're just
[28:05] using it. And he said, "Wait, he says
[28:06] that these latter-day revivals or
[28:08] movements, they fly to pieces. Some of
[28:10] them found they've been claimed to drunk
[28:12] in their pulpit and some of them has
[28:15] done wrong." What a shame.
[28:18] What a shame. It's because they have
[28:20] such an influence on the people to they
[28:23] begin to feel that they're
[28:25] self-sufficient.
[28:27] That's their little kingdom and they can
[28:29] and they got the people so in their grip
[28:32] that they can just do anything they want
[28:34] to and the people don't notice it.
[28:37] This is exactly the truth.
[28:39] It's that reality distortion field. It's
[28:41] that those dynamics of a cult where
[28:44] there's a authoritarian leader and
[28:46] there's one at the top and everyone just
[28:48] kind of obeys and does whatever they say
[28:50] and they can do no wrong
[28:52] to the point to whatever they do that
[28:54] becomes the new standard. there's an
[28:56] excuse for it. Now, I'm not reading
[28:58] these because I feel like I'm preaching
[28:59] to a bunch of uh false prophets and cult
[29:02] leaders. I mean, that would be a
[29:04] different convention, but we're we're
[29:06] doing this because he's going to bring
[29:08] it down from maybe this high level stuff
[29:09] to us individually. But God notices it.
[29:13] And that's where you can take great
[29:14] comfort. God notices it. You see, that's
[29:17] the one like Nebuchadnezzar one day
[29:19] walked out and said, "Look what a great
[29:21] kingdom I've built." And then the angel
[29:23] Lord smokeote him. And when a man or
[29:25] woman, now he's not just talking about
[29:26] these ministers in these uh latter reign
[29:28] revivals. He says when a man or woman,
[29:30] no matter whether he's a bishop or
[29:32] cardinal or whatever he might be,
[29:35] when you begin to feel that you are
[29:37] self-reliant,
[29:40] then you better begin to watch and take
[29:41] heed.
[29:42] When you feel that the way is in
[29:44] yourself, when the Bible says, "I know
[29:46] that the way of man is not in himself.
[29:48] It's not in man that walketh to direct
[29:50] his steps." When you feel self-reliant
[29:52] in your own decisions, your own thought
[29:54] making ability that you have the right,
[29:56] you have the right chi and I'm going to
[29:57] be able to navigate this life uh uh well
[30:00] because of the energy that I have and
[30:01] this life force that I have within me uh
[30:03] within and of yourself or some sort of
[30:05] universal power. You've got to recognize
[30:07] that it's not in man organically to know
[30:11] the way within himself, the right way
[30:13] and to get it right. So, we have to
[30:15] recognize I am not self-reliant, but I
[30:18] am al sufficiency is in Christ.
[30:22] He says, when you begin to think that
[30:23] you're self-reliant, then you better
[30:24] begin to watch and take heed because God
[30:27] won't let you go like that because he
[30:29] will not share his glory with anyone.
[30:32] Let me pause this that there may be
[30:33] things that happen in our lives just
[30:34] because God needs to correct your
[30:36] attitude. It's not evidence that you're
[30:38] not his child. It's more evidence that
[30:39] you are his child because he's like look
[30:41] I need you cannot uh be taking the
[30:44] glory. My glory cannot be shared with
[30:46] anyone. You have to recognize from whom
[30:48] this came and there's this God allowing
[30:51] things to happen so that we recognize oh
[30:53] this is what's doing it.
[30:55] Now instead of us just thinking man what
[30:57] a narcissist God is that he wants to get
[30:59] all the credit. No he wants you to
[31:01] recognize the dynamics that work
[31:04] that he gets the glory. In other words,
[31:06] we recognize, oh, that's why these great
[31:08] things are happening because I'm doing
[31:10] this and this is according to his will.
[31:12] This is operated according to principle
[31:14] in the word of God or a principle of
[31:15] faith. And so, the more I do this, the
[31:17] more successful I'll be spiritually, the
[31:19] better benefit I'll be to my family, to
[31:21] my loved ones, the better I can live
[31:23] above depression and anxiety and
[31:25] financial ruin. There's a way that if
[31:26] I'm doing this, then that's what works.
[31:29] And so, God's not just wanting to get
[31:31] credit for it. He's wanting you to
[31:33] credit him so that you could take
[31:35] advantage of his credit.
[31:37] Why? He's giving you a checkbook. He's
[31:38] want you to know that you can fill it
[31:40] out and know how to use it and not just
[31:42] luck your way into blessings.
[31:45] He says he will not share his glory with
[31:47] anyone. No sir, God takes glory alone.
[31:49] Sometimes God can bless a man and give
[31:50] him a little minister that maybe is a
[31:51] little better than his brethren or not
[31:53] better, but just something a little
[31:54] different from his brethren. And the
[31:57] first thing you know, the man becomes
[31:58] exalted with his chest out and oh my, he
[32:00] would he would brush you off the street.
[32:02] And that's the time that I believe that
[32:04] man has started again. He says this out
[32:06] the door. He's using that phrase down
[32:08] the road. Out the door. And he says
[32:11] because God don't God can't use a person
[32:16] like that.
[32:18] When we're looking for God's blessings
[32:21] and his will in our lives, let's keep
[32:24] the credit to him.
[32:27] and not believe that we're self-reliant
[32:28] because it's not in us to know our way.
[32:32] It's not in us to figure it out. So
[32:33] David says, "Order my steps in thy word.
[32:36] Show me the steps to take your steps."
[32:39] And then and then we have to take the
[32:41] corrective measures to imp implement
[32:43] that path. that if God tells you to take
[32:46] a step here and there's something that's
[32:48] keeping you from taking that step, then
[32:50] you have to know that if God wants you
[32:52] to do something, he's provided you with
[32:54] the power and resources to do his will.
[32:57] He's never going to ask you anything
[32:58] that his grace cannot allow you to do
[33:00] it.
[33:01] So, we have to sometimes make the
[33:03] difficult choice and put forth the
[33:05] effort and the corrections to implement
[33:08] or to take that step.
[33:10] And I'm using this as a New Year's
[33:13] statement to us. And it this was maybe
[33:16] one of the original things that began to
[33:17] turn in my heart a little bit as we
[33:19] neared this service in the sermon
[33:21] contest. He preached it on New Year's
[33:22] Eve in 1962. Heavenly Father, as we
[33:25] stand here, as many thoughts are dying
[33:27] out in our hearts and the mistakes of
[33:30] the last year, and as we're approaching
[33:32] the death of 62 and the birth of 63, and
[33:35] we could say the same now as 23 is dying
[33:38] out, and it's soon going to be gone, and
[33:39] there's going to be 20 uh four going to
[33:41] be coming uh coming up and being born.
[33:44] He says, "Oh, God, may we be one step
[33:47] higher up the ladder."
[33:49] Now, that's maybe not a lot of rungs.
[33:52] He's just saying one.
[33:54] And would you rather stay on the one
[33:56] you're on or at least go one?
[33:58] But sometimes I believe that people are
[34:00] happy never getting on the ladder if
[34:02] they can't immediately be at the top.
[34:05] They say, "Well, I want to be on the
[34:06] top." Well, you can't do it that way.
[34:09] You got to start climbing. Well, then I
[34:10] I'm not I'm not even going to try.
[34:13] And and I know maybe in that sense it's
[34:15] kind of uh calling out a bad attitude,
[34:17] but sometimes it could be a little bit
[34:18] different than that. And it's just like,
[34:20] well, I don't know if I can make it to
[34:21] the top, so I'm not even going to try. I
[34:23] I just don't know if I'm worth going to
[34:25] the top, so I'm going to try. And
[34:26] listen, it's not a matter of here's the
[34:28] ladder, here's the mountain, get to the
[34:29] top. Say, just take a step.
[34:32] Just make take a step. If you know it's
[34:34] God's will, just take the step. I'm sure
[34:36] you've heard the story before where a
[34:38] man was had a lived out in the
[34:40] wilderness and he had built a house and
[34:43] he built the house kind of in such a way
[34:44] to was by this rock for some shelter.
[34:46] And God spoke to him one day and he knew
[34:48] it was God was just he said God told him
[34:51] to push against this boulder in front of
[34:53] his house. And so he thought well I I'd
[34:57] better do what God wants me to do. So
[34:59] the man be to push this boulder day
[35:01] after day trying to move this boulder
[35:04] trying to push it down the hill or get
[35:05] it away from his house. And he tried day
[35:07] after day after day to where he got very
[35:09] very discouraged. And after a while,
[35:11] maybe it was at the end of the year, he
[35:12] kind of said, "Well, Lord, you spoke to
[35:14] me a year ago, and you told me uh to
[35:16] push against this rock, and here I've
[35:18] pushed all year long, and I've never
[35:20] moved the rock. Lord, I'm a failure, and
[35:23] and I and I just I'm just going to quit
[35:25] and give up." And God immediately spoke
[35:26] to him again, and said, "I never asked
[35:27] you to move it.
[35:29] I just asked you to push against it."
[35:32] And the man was like, "Well, what was
[35:33] the point?" He said, "How strong is your
[35:35] back now?
[35:36] How much more strength do you have in
[35:38] your muscles and your fortitude and your
[35:41] stamina? He's like, "Oh, well, I just
[35:43] assumed you wanted me to move the rock.
[35:44] I didn't realize you were putting me in
[35:46] a pretty good resistance training regime
[35:48] for a whole year." And God's like,
[35:49] "Yeah, I know what I'm doing. I know
[35:51] just how to get you fit spiritually."
[35:53] And and and sometimes we think, "Well,
[35:55] if I go to church, this has to happen.
[35:56] If I do this, this has to happen. If I
[35:58] pay my tithe, I I got to get the bonus.
[36:00] If I support missions, I got to see
[36:01] this." He hasn't asked you to
[36:02] predetermine what he's wanting you to do
[36:05] by doing it. He just wants you to do it.
[36:08] Whatever it is, just do it. And then the
[36:10] results will be what God wants those
[36:12] results to be.
[36:14] And sometimes it's just take another
[36:16] step on the ladder.
[36:17] I want to be like those firefighters who
[36:19] can work in tandem. And the next thing
[36:20] you know, the guy's up there and the
[36:22] water buckets are just going, I want to
[36:23] be I want to be at the top. He says,
[36:24] "No, just take one step."
[36:26] One step up the ladder. It's remarkable
[36:29] to think that he can make this
[36:30] statement. May we be one step higher up
[36:33] the ladder knowing what's coming in
[36:35] 1963.
[36:38] He says until we can see Jesus and his
[36:40] program.
[36:41] What is that? What how does it the
[36:43] language sound to you? Step by step.
[36:46] Maybe we unstep higher up the ladder.
[36:48] Until. So Lord, let me just keep going
[36:50] one step at a time.
[36:51] Amen.
[36:52] With each step, one step at a time, Lord
[36:54] willing, step by step, higher and
[36:55] higher. And as I get higher and higher,
[36:57] I see your program. I see you. I see
[36:59] Jesus and his program. That's what's
[37:01] opened to us in the opening of those
[37:03] seals is one step higher up the ladder
[37:05] until that moment. And how do you get to
[37:07] the opening of the seals? How are you
[37:08] going to get to those great things
[37:09] promised in that? One rung at a time.
[37:12] Amen.
[37:12] One step at a time.
[37:14] Step by step.
[37:17] Deuteronomy 11. There's this image of
[37:20] footsteps in the Exodus. I want to read
[37:22] verses 18 to 28. And maybe we won't stop
[37:26] and expound upon a lot of these
[37:28] statements. So, we'll just highlight a
[37:29] couple places here, but I'm going to
[37:31] read these many verses here so you can
[37:34] catch the theme of God, God's word, and
[37:38] even what David would be drawing from
[37:40] when he talks about order my steps in
[37:42] thy word. And he talks about that thy
[37:43] law is precious and thy words are sweet
[37:45] and how much preeminence, especially in
[37:47] Psalms 119, is given to the word. It's
[37:49] because this is what God has to say.
[37:51] Therefore shall ye lay up these my words
[37:54] in your heart and in your soul and bind
[37:56] them for a sign upon your hand that they
[37:58] may be as frontlets between your eyes.
[38:00] The word of God is to have this uh this
[38:03] preeminence.
[38:05] And you shall teach them your children,
[38:07] speaking of them when thou sitest in thy
[38:09] house, and when thou walkest by the way,
[38:12] and when thou liest down, and when thou
[38:14] riseth up. Well, there's not much room
[38:17] for not doing it.
[38:20] and thou shalt write them upon the
[38:21] doorpost of thy house and upon thy
[38:23] gates. This is that word that we're
[38:24] talking about. You gather around. This
[38:26] is the word that we're being obedient
[38:27] to. This is the word that's to order
[38:28] your steps. Wasn't just the the the uh
[38:32] wasn't just to have a sign, but it was
[38:34] having a reminder of the word and what
[38:36] the word spoke of.
[38:38] So, you would come back to what what
[38:40] what it what it referred to, what it
[38:42] meant, and what it wrote about. and I
[38:44] shall write them upon the doorpost of
[38:45] thine house and upon thy gates that your
[38:47] days may be multiplied. Here's the
[38:49] outcome. Here's the fruit. Here's the
[38:50] blessings. In the days of your children,
[38:52] in the land which the Lord swear unto
[38:54] your fathers to give them as the days of
[38:56] heaven upon the earth. For if ye shall
[38:59] diligently keep all these commandments
[39:01] which I command you to do them, to love
[39:04] the Lord your God, to walk in all his
[39:06] ways, and to cleave unto him,
[39:09] then will the Lord drive out all these
[39:12] nations from before you, and you shall
[39:14] possess greater nations and mightier
[39:16] than yourselves. What was the secret to
[39:18] fully possessing their promised land?
[39:19] Full fully being positionally placed,
[39:22] loving the Lord, walking in his ways,
[39:24] and holding to him. summarized
[39:26] essentially as diligently keeping all
[39:28] his commandments. That's why no true
[39:30] believer is any more healthy or
[39:31] spiritually alive than his knowledge of
[39:33] and his cleaving to and holding to the
[39:36] pure word of God.
[39:38] Every place where on the souls of your
[39:41] feet shall tread shall be yours. Why?
[39:44] Because you're walking in all his ways.
[39:47] So there has to be step by step where
[39:49] the souls of your feet where they tread,
[39:51] it shall be yours. Now, how are you
[39:54] going to do that?
[39:55] You have to step on it. Has to be step
[39:58] by step. I know there's a lot of things
[40:00] we just claim, right? We just claim it
[40:02] and we're just using the third pull.
[40:04] We're claiming it. We're just going to
[40:06] speak it and we're going to we're going
[40:09] to claim it in that way. But you know
[40:10] what? There still has to be footsteps.
[40:12] Sometimes what we're doing is we're just
[40:14] doing a I dream a genie blink and hoping
[40:17] it's going to happen. That's what we
[40:18] did. We just claimed it by I believe my
[40:20] children could be saved
[40:22] and we're not putting any footsteps to
[40:24] it. Right. Right.
[40:25] No overt action, no no demonstration of
[40:28] a confidence in the word of God. So
[40:29] there has to be footsteps. Every place
[40:31] where on the souls your feet shall tread
[40:32] shall be yours. From the wilderness in
[40:35] Lebanon, from the river, the river
[40:36] Euphrates, even under the uttermost sea
[40:38] shall your coast be. So now he tells
[40:40] them where they need to walk.
[40:42] And know what's beautiful about this? He
[40:43] tells them where not to walk.
[40:46] He's saying within these boundaries,
[40:48] walk all you want cuz it's yours. And I
[40:50] think maybe sometimes what we're doing
[40:51] is we're trying to dip our toe in the
[40:53] world and take possessions in the world
[40:55] that aren't ours. And when we go to
[40:57] stepping on that, that's when we get
[40:58] something bad happens cuz God said, "I
[41:00] never promised to give that to you. I'm
[41:02] telling you what the borders are. I'm
[41:04] telling you what you can have confidence
[41:05] in. I'm telling you what you can
[41:06] believe. That's where you can put your
[41:08] foot and know that it's yours.
[41:11] There shall no man be able to stand
[41:13] before you. For the Lord your God shall
[41:15] lay the fear of you and the dread of you
[41:17] upon all the land that ye shall tread
[41:19] upon, as he hath said unto you.
[41:22] They still have to tread upon it.
[41:25] Behold, I set before you this day a
[41:27] blessing and a curse.
[41:30] a blessing if you obey the commandments
[41:32] of the Lord your God, which I command
[41:34] you this day, and a curse if you will
[41:36] not obey the commandments of the Lord
[41:38] your God, but turn aside out of the way
[41:40] which I command you this day to go after
[41:43] other gods which you have not known.
[41:44] Notice again the image of veering from a
[41:47] path.
[41:48] Notice steps but in the wrong direction.
[41:50] Steps but upon the wrong promise. Steps
[41:52] but upon the wrong thing to where now
[41:54] they're going to be possessing things
[41:55] they should not have.
[41:58] It's kind of a remarkable thought if you
[41:59] think that wherever your souls or your
[42:01] feet shall tread, it will be yours. That
[42:03] means you're taking possession of some
[42:05] of these nasty things that you've got in
[42:07] your life.
[42:08] Why? You're walking on it.
[42:10] Why do you own that bad attitude? You
[42:11] stepped on it.
[42:13] Why do you own that lust? You're
[42:14] stepping on it and you're possessing it.
[42:17] Keep your feet clean by walking in the
[42:19] path. Let's wash cleanse our way by
[42:21] taking heed according to the word of
[42:23] God. And let's take some personal
[42:24] accountability. Hey, the reason why
[42:26] these things are is because we took
[42:28] possession of these things. We took
[42:30] ownership of these things and so I want
[42:32] to relinquish them because it's not
[42:34] within the framework of what God
[42:36] promised to me.
[42:39] Brother Bradam says this in the message
[42:41] presuming God's got a program.
[42:44] Oh God, let us be one step higher up the
[42:47] ladder.
[42:48] One rung at a time, one step at a time
[42:50] till we can see Jesus and his program.
[42:52] And this isn't just some sort of guess.
[42:54] He says, "God's got a program."
[42:58] So he says, "And let's just get right in
[43:00] it and move on."
[43:01] Amen.
[43:01] God is sharing with the children of
[43:03] Israel his program. This word I gave to
[43:05] you, this is my program. Walk in it and
[43:07] all your enemies will flee before you.
[43:10] Walk in every promise of it and you'll
[43:11] possess all the entirety of the borders
[43:13] that I've granted you. God's got a
[43:15] program. Let's just get right in it and
[43:17] move on step by step. Move in it. And I
[43:20] love this. He says, "Don't wait and try
[43:21] to get this and that. You move yourself.
[43:26] God will move those who he's ordained to
[43:29] move that way.
[43:32] Sometimes it could look like a lonely
[43:33] road. Like, well, if I take this path,
[43:35] I'm going to do it alone. Well, if God
[43:37] wants you to take it, maybe he wants you
[43:39] to be alone. It's best to take it alone
[43:41] than to look for the crowd.
[43:43] Sometimes we're going the opposite way.
[43:46] Think about it. when there was this
[43:47] exodus and all those millions of people,
[43:50] two millions and this exodus and they're
[43:52] leaving and you say, "Well, okay, I'm
[43:54] going to follow these people." And as
[43:56] you get to going, all of a sudden you
[43:58] notice a couple guys veer off and
[44:00] they're headed straight for the promised
[44:01] land. You're like, "Who are these guys?"
[44:02] Oh, it's just Joshua and Caleb. They're
[44:04] headed to the promised land. You'd be
[44:05] like, "Well, you probably think, well,
[44:07] there's, you know, there's almost two
[44:09] million. There's just two there. I I'll
[44:12] I'll stick it out here." But guess what?
[44:13] It was the two that were right.
[44:16] Sometimes we need to go alone.
[44:18] God will move those. He says you don't
[44:20] wait to get this and that the other.
[44:21] Just reminds me sometimes of how people
[44:23] run their metrics and the choices
[44:25] they're making. Well, this needs to
[44:27] happen and this needs to be that way and
[44:29] if it had this and that and they start
[44:30] doing this choice. It's like the
[44:31] question is what about God's will?
[44:35] I if you know his will. Now, I'm not
[44:37] talking about the process of determining
[44:38] whether or not it's his will or making a
[44:40] decision the best you can and praying
[44:42] about what God's will is. There's some
[44:44] people who say no to what they know in
[44:46] their gut is God's will because all the
[44:48] other stuff isn't lining up yet for
[44:49] them.
[44:51] He says, "Don't wait and see that this
[44:52] lines up and this happens and get this
[44:54] and that. Move yourself. God will move
[44:56] those He's ordained to move that way.
[44:58] Just take your own. It's your stand. You
[45:01] take your stand. If the next fellow
[45:04] doesn't, how do we know it? Might not be
[45:06] for him to take it.
[45:09] This is this is pretty this is to me is
[45:11] real wonderful stuff. And it might it
[45:13] might mean a lot more to me personally
[45:15] than it does for you because this is one
[45:16] of the things that God supernaturally I
[45:18] I would deal my gave my wife in a very
[45:21] supernatural way when we were praying
[45:23] about our move here because just in the
[45:25] trajectory of how we were leave left
[45:27] Texas and we found ourselves in Newton
[45:29] North Carolina and as we were there and
[45:31] God was calling us to move uh here to
[45:33] start a church we were thinking well
[45:35] we've got a family of six we've got uh
[45:37] we've got 12 years and under is kind of
[45:39] the age range of our children and we're
[45:42] going to go move and we're going to have
[45:43] church with brother Mike and sister
[45:44] Jennifer. What a great youth group and a
[45:47] and young couples and all the things
[45:49] that we'll be doing. And it was like
[45:51] what are we moving to? What are we what
[45:54] what are our children? How are they
[45:56] going to have fellowship and how are
[45:57] they going to have a youth group? And
[45:58] could you imagine if I decided not to
[46:00] start a church because my church didn't
[46:02] have a youth group? Like well that's
[46:04] kind of backwards, isn't it? How about
[46:06] you start the youth group, right? some
[46:09] things maybe sometimes, well, I don't
[46:11] want to do that because they never do
[46:12] this. Well, why won't you be the guy
[46:13] that does it?
[46:16] And so, as when we were coming, the Lord
[46:18] just providing this through daily
[46:20] devotion and this scripture coming up,
[46:22] it spoke so deeply to my wife's heart.
[46:24] God's got a program. Just get right in
[46:25] it and move on. Don't worry about what's
[46:28] going to be there. Don't worry about all
[46:29] the other things. Just do what I've
[46:31] asked you to do. He says, you move
[46:33] yourself. God will move those he's
[46:35] ordained to be there. Oh my, I can
[46:38] almost jump out of my skin. Look what
[46:40] he's done for us. I just testify as a as
[46:43] a son of God, as a father who had a
[46:45] burden for his children. Look what he's
[46:47] done. Look at the ones he's ordained to
[46:48] be here that we would have never thought
[46:50] would be here.
[46:52] Why? God just did in his program. Do
[46:54] what he asked you to do. He'll take care
[46:56] of the rest.
[46:57] I say it's worth it. It's worth the
[46:59] sacrifice. It's worth overcoming the
[47:02] fears. It's worth overcoming the
[47:04] complexes because the glory that awaits
[47:06] on the other side of the opposition when
[47:08] God has called you to take possession,
[47:10] it's worth it.
[47:13] Hallelujah.
[47:14] He says it might not be for the others
[47:16] to go that way. And that's how we can
[47:19] have grace sometimes when God's moving
[47:20] us and others don't follow. It's may may
[47:22] not be for them. Their battle may be
[47:25] they want to follow you, but God's
[47:26] asking them to do something else. And
[47:29] that's that's where they've got to
[47:30] overcome the same way you did to take
[47:32] their path.
[47:33] Yes.
[47:35] He says it might not be for them to take
[47:38] it. My sheep hear my voice. And then he
[47:40] combines this. All the father has given
[47:42] me will come to me.
[47:45] They know a voice and the voice will
[47:46] guide them to that place.
[47:50] My sheep hear my voice and I know them
[47:52] and they follow me.
[47:57] John 10:27 said, "My sheep hear my voice
[48:02] and I know them and they follow."
[48:05] There's that recognition of his voice
[48:07] and what his voice wants you to do. And
[48:09] then you w you step. How do you follow?
[48:11] One step at a time. It's that great
[48:14] riddle or that great question. How do
[48:15] you eat a 2,000lb elephant? Anybody know
[48:18] how to do it?
[48:20] One bite at a time. If God askked you to
[48:22] do something, just do it one bite at a
[48:24] time. One step at a time. I want you to
[48:26] climb that mountain. Well, I can't make
[48:28] it to the top. Well, you're never going
[48:29] to make it if you don't take a step.
[48:31] And sometimes you step and next thing
[48:32] you know, the step gets easier. It's one
[48:34] thing I've learned living in Arizona is
[48:36] we we have pretty much good hiking
[48:38] weather all year round. Just sometimes
[48:40] that time of the day is different. But,
[48:42] uh we you could there's you can always
[48:44] go on hikes and we're we as a family
[48:46] enjoy hikes. My wife and I enjoy uh
[48:48] going on certain hikes. I like the short
[48:50] flat ones. And uh so there's you find I
[48:53] found that the more that I would engage
[48:54] in the more rigorous ones and by
[48:56] rigorous I just mean you know a couple
[48:58] rocks here and there and you find that
[49:01] man your legs can get tired you get a
[49:02] little winded but you know if you just
[49:04] keep stepping
[49:05] you your legs aren't tired anymore you
[49:07] get your wind back and you realize oh
[49:09] man how how long 48 years of quitting at
[49:12] the first breath and the first pain when
[49:14] all I had to do is just keep stepping
[49:16] and you just keep stepping and it gets a
[49:18] little bit easier like man I was winning
[49:19] it I was my legs were weak I I was all
[49:21] shaking and we just got out of the car
[49:23] and finally got to the start of the
[49:24] trail. But just keep stepping. Just keep
[49:27] stepping. The more you step, the more
[49:28] strength you get, the more stamina you
[49:30] get, the more courage you get. And all
[49:32] it takes is just keep making a step.
[49:35] Keep making a step. Brother Brand, he's
[49:37] talking about these promises of every
[49:39] place that your souls uh shall tread
[49:41] upon. I'll give you land. He says, "If
[49:43] you can't take a step, just wiggle your
[49:45] toe. Just do something to show you want
[49:47] to move. I've heard your voice, oh Lord.
[49:50] You told me to take another step up the
[49:52] the rung up the ladder. I may not be
[49:54] able to get my leg back, but I can reach
[49:56] up to touch this one, and I'm just going
[49:58] to hold on to that one because soon
[50:00] enough I'm going to be able to get that
[50:01] leg up. I'm going to take the next step.
[50:06] Exodus 23:29-31,
[50:08] God gives these great promises. If you
[50:11] lay up these words in your heart and you
[50:12] diligently keep these commandments, I
[50:14] will actually drive out all the nations
[50:16] before you, I'll do it, and you will
[50:18] possess greater nations and mightier
[50:19] nations. Every place that your foot
[50:22] lands, I'll give it to you within these
[50:24] borders.
[50:26] He says, I give you a choice now,
[50:28] blessing or cursing. Then he says this
[50:30] this way. I want you to recognize how
[50:32] God then more detailed than this. Exodus
[50:35] 23:29-31
[50:37] says, "I will not drive them out from
[50:40] before thee in one year." So now we have
[50:42] a little bit more color as he had said
[50:43] this in in the Exodus to this driving
[50:46] out all the enemies. So now he's kind of
[50:47] given an idea that it's not that I've
[50:49] already driven them out or that as soon
[50:51] as you knock on the door of Jericho, all
[50:53] of a sudden you're just going to feel
[50:54] this vacuum is all the interlopers are
[50:57] just leaving the promised land. He says,
[50:59] "I won't do it in one year lest the land
[51:01] become desolate and the beast of the
[51:02] field multiply against thee." You
[51:04] recognize the wisdom in that?
[51:06] He needed someone there tilling the
[51:07] fields. He needed someone there managing
[51:09] the crops and the and the animals. And
[51:11] he was going to leave them there for a
[51:12] while. He was going to use their uh
[51:14] their uh trespassing. He says, "I'm not
[51:16] going to do it all at once because then
[51:18] something terrible can happen to the
[51:19] land. Something terrible can happen to
[51:21] uh uh what I'm wanting to give you." So
[51:22] he says, "I won't do it immediately
[51:25] because of the consequences of that." So
[51:27] God has this great wisdom. Sometimes
[51:28] like, "Oh, this I want this time. I want
[51:30] that time." God's like, "We'll just take
[51:31] the first steps." Yeah.
[51:33] And if you just keep it, take a step,
[51:35] then as you make steps, it'll get closer
[51:37] and closer to your victory. And
[51:39] sometimes we're refusing refusing to
[51:40] take a step until we see the victory.
[51:42] Until we see that, well, you you haven't
[51:44] moved the roadblock. You're not even
[51:45] close to it yet.
[51:47] You're want me to remove the the the
[51:49] roadblock, but you've made no
[51:50] affirmative actions to show me that you
[51:53] want to go that way, that you will go
[51:54] that way. I told you this is the way I
[51:55] want you to go, and you're stopping.
[51:57] You're not doing anything I asked you to
[51:58] do. You're not doing any of the six
[51:59] because you need to see the roadblock
[52:01] move. move and God said just take a
[52:02] step. No, I don't want to do it. The
[52:03] roadblock's still there. You're not even
[52:05] close to the roadblock. But yeah, but
[52:06] once I get to the I feel like I'm
[52:07] talking to my kids. Once I get there and
[52:09] the roadblock's there, then right. He's
[52:12] like, the more you step, the more you
[52:14] step and the more you step.
[52:16] Then if there's a roadblock there, guess
[52:18] what? God will move it.
[52:19] When you go to make that last step,
[52:21] he'll be there.
[52:23] I think sometimes though, that roadblock
[52:24] was just an illusion.
[52:27] And you get closer and realize, oh,
[52:29] that's actually not a block. It's a
[52:31] step.
[52:35] He says, "By little," verse 30, "by
[52:38] little and little," if I could just be a
[52:41] little self- serving today. By step by
[52:43] step,
[52:44] "By little and little, I will drive them
[52:47] I will drive them out from before thee."
[52:49] Again, I'm just going to do it. God's
[52:51] going to do it step by step. God's going
[52:53] to do it little by little until thou be
[52:55] increased and inherit the land by little
[52:57] and little, step by step. If I can say
[52:59] this, there's no shortcuts. There's no
[53:01] easy fixes. There's nothing really quick
[53:03] by this. You've got to do it step by
[53:05] step. You've got to put footsteps to it.
[53:07] You've got to do the things that God
[53:09] asked you to do. You've got to be
[53:10] diligent in the simple things, the small
[53:12] things, the ABCs. You've got to be doing
[53:14] those six things that we've told you
[53:15] about in order to take the greater steps
[53:17] into other areas. You've got to be doing
[53:19] what God wants you to do and called you
[53:21] because there are no shortcuts to
[53:23] perfection. There is no shortcut in the
[53:25] rapture. There's no shortcuts into his
[53:27] grace. You've got to find the way that
[53:29] he wants you to take and take it
[53:32] cuz he says until thou be increased.
[53:34] What is that referring to? Maturing,
[53:36] growing. You know, with each push
[53:38] against the stone, the back gets
[53:40] stronger,
[53:41] the m muscles get stronger, the hands
[53:44] get more calloused, you get more ready
[53:46] and prepared for the labor that awaits
[53:47] you.
[53:50] He says there so there's a growing
[53:53] there's a maturing process with each
[53:55] step so that you can be in a better
[53:57] position. He's saying if I if I drove it
[53:59] all out then you would show up and you
[54:01] wouldn't be able to manage things. It'd
[54:03] be chaotic because you wouldn't have the
[54:05] maturity. You wouldn't have the knowhow.
[54:06] You wouldn't have the knowledge and the
[54:07] experience to be able to possess your
[54:09] land. But if I just do it piece by
[54:10] piece, you're learning as you go. You're
[54:12] growing. You're understanding more of my
[54:14] nature and my will. It's that tutoring.
[54:15] It's that child child rearing. It's that
[54:17] whole adoption process that brother
[54:19] Brandham expanded so much in his
[54:20] ministry on until thou be increased lest
[54:23] the field multiply against it. I'm going
[54:25] to let you grow into this to where you
[54:27] can fully possess everything. God is
[54:29] wanting to give us an adoption robe and
[54:31] we try it on and it doesn't fit and we
[54:32] just stumble over and trip over it, but
[54:34] if we'll just grow into it, it fits you
[54:36] just perfectly.
[54:38] And I will set thy bounds from the Red
[54:40] Sea and under the sea of the Philistines
[54:41] and from the desert under the river. And
[54:42] so now he's just mirroring that language
[54:43] of this is where you can walk. This is
[54:46] where you're going to go step by step.
[54:47] For I will deliver the inhabitants
[54:50] inhabitants of the land into your hand.
[54:53] Notice there it's God saying,"I will not
[54:55] do it in one year, but if you'll just
[54:57] take step by step and grow and mature, I
[55:01] will deliver the inhabitants of the land
[55:02] into your hand." And then he says, "And
[55:04] thou shalt drive them out before thee."
[55:10] I will do it. He says, "I will deliver
[55:13] the inhabitants and you'll drive them
[55:16] out." This is God's program. Brother
[55:19] says, "God has a program and we must
[55:21] measure up to that program."
[55:25] This is how God wants us to do it. Step
[55:27] by step,
[55:30] step by step. Now, I'm at a spot here
[55:33] where I can determine whether or not
[55:34] I've already got my notes for Wednesday
[55:35] night.
[55:37] It's only 11:37. We haven't quite been
[55:39] preaching a full an hour yet. And the
[55:42] believer can sit hour after hour
[55:45] drinking in the word.
[55:47] Amen.
[55:50] Not quite in the after hour yet though.
[55:52] Matthew chapter 6. I would go ahead and
[55:54] just start reading this since we opened
[55:55] with that statement on seeking first the
[55:57] kingdom of God. Then we could just
[55:59] there's not much more here in terms of
[56:01] uh more thoughts that we could probably
[56:03] just go through very quickly here. I'll
[56:05] read this again much like we did in
[56:07] Deuteronomy 11. Are you are you awake?
[56:09] You feeling good individually? If we got
[56:11] enough that feel good, we can kind of
[56:12] rub off on everybody else who doesn't.
[56:15] And you can amen loud enough to wake up
[56:16] those who are sleeping. Matthew 6 25-34.
[56:20] Says, "Therefore, I say unto you," and
[56:22] therefore then is piggybacking off of
[56:23] these great things he's already been
[56:25] expounding upon. Take no thought for
[56:27] your life what you shall eat or what you
[56:28] shall drink. And we're kind of like,
[56:30] "Then what else do you think about?"
[56:33] I mean, we talk about what we're going
[56:34] to have for the next meal while we're
[56:35] eating the meal we just prepared. So,
[56:38] it's like, "What else? What else is
[56:39] there to talk about?" But what we're
[56:41] going to be eating, take no thought for
[56:42] your life, what you shall eat or what
[56:44] you shall drink, nor yet for the your
[56:46] body, what you shall put on. So it
[56:47] brings the sisters into the fellowship.
[56:49] He said, "It's not the life is not life
[56:51] more than meat and the body than
[56:53] reignment."
[56:55] And then just the the the logic, the
[56:57] pure logic of this is so beautiful.
[56:59] Behold the fowls of the air. For they
[57:01] sow not, neither do they reap, nor
[57:03] gather into barns, yet your heavenly
[57:05] father feedth them. Are you not much
[57:07] better than they? This I hope this just
[57:09] strikes a little bit deeper when all the
[57:12] things that we obsess about and we get
[57:13] anxious about and God's like, "Uh,
[57:17] just check out check out the birds next
[57:19] time."
[57:20] A and know that I'll take care of you.
[57:23] Amen.
[57:24] Which of you taking thought can add one
[57:26] cubit under his stature? That goes back
[57:27] to man thinking he's got the way within
[57:29] himself when he begins to think he's
[57:31] self-reliant. Which one of you can go
[57:34] and get taller?
[57:35] It doesn't happen. Isn't that right,
[57:36] Brother Elliot? doesn't happen. No, no
[57:39] matter how much you go
[57:41] now, it's just your tippy toes. You
[57:43] can't make yourself taller. Ellie,
[57:45] you'll get past six foot. I'm praying
[57:46] for you. It says he says, "Which one of
[57:49] you taking thought can add one cub into
[57:51] a stature? And why take ye thought for
[57:53] raignment?" So there's the food. Now the
[57:56] the the raignment consider the liies of
[57:58] the field how they grow. They toil not,
[58:00] neither do they spin. This is that lily
[58:03] of the field. When brother Brown talked
[58:05] about the lily spinning and toiling,
[58:06] he's talking about the pond lily. So
[58:08] that's where you don't get tripped up
[58:10] like, oh my goodness, this is a lily of
[58:12] the field versus the pond lily. Says,
[58:14] "And yet I say unto you that even
[58:16] Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed
[58:18] like one of these. Wherefore, if God so
[58:21] clothe the grass of the field, which
[58:23] today is, and tomorrow is cast into the
[58:25] oven, shall he not much more clothe you,
[58:29] oh ye of little faith?"
[58:31] And even the most simple of things,
[58:34] reminds I don't know if it's brother
[58:35] Timothy that was ministering on it or
[58:36] maybe some something I was listening to
[58:38] or my wife was listening to on just how
[58:40] maybe it was brother Timothy how
[58:42] unconscious faith is it takes faith to
[58:44] do everything
[58:46] we have faith that the car is going to
[58:48] start we have faith that this is going
[58:49] to be there and this is going to happen
[58:50] he says it's all it's the most common
[58:52] thing it is he said and so he says oh
[58:54] you have little faith because the thing
[58:56] that you have so commonly you won't use
[58:59] it in the thing that's the most
[59:01] important to just believe God will
[59:03] provide. Let it be said of us as
[59:06] believers as this old year dies out and
[59:08] we enter into the new one. I will not be
[59:10] careful, anxious, and bow down about
[59:12] anything that God said he would provide
[59:15] for me. It may not be what you asked
[59:17] for, but he will provide what you need.
[59:22] That's right.
[59:25] We wanted to eat at Flemings every night
[59:26] of the week. Well, maybe it's not going
[59:28] to be that, but you will be eating.
[59:30] Amen.
[59:32] Take no thought.
[59:34] Verse 31. Therefore, take no thought,
[59:36] saying, "What shall we eat, or what
[59:38] shall we drink, or with all shall we be
[59:40] clothed?" And we were all thinking about
[59:41] whether or not we should go home and
[59:42] change before we go eat. So, we had to
[59:44] pick out two things. Our outfit and
[59:46] where we wanted to eat. Right now,
[59:48] today, while service is going on,
[59:49] there's probably already been a note
[59:50] pass. Where are we eating later?
[59:53] I think I'm going to put on my RTO's
[59:55] fit.
[1:00:00] For all these things, after all these
[1:00:02] things do the Gentiles seek. Now, why
[1:00:04] did he just bring us into it?
[1:00:07] It's because they didn't have a God who
[1:00:08] made them specific promises.
[1:00:10] So, they lived according to the flesh.
[1:00:12] They woke up every morning being like, I
[1:00:14] better keep my land. I better keep my
[1:00:15] crops. I better keep my possessions. I
[1:00:16] better keep my assets. I got to keep all
[1:00:18] these things that I need in order to
[1:00:19] procure living and substance and be able
[1:00:21] to barter and trade because they had to
[1:00:23] look after themselves, defend their
[1:00:25] borders, everything else. Because the
[1:00:26] Gentile didn't have a God who said,
[1:00:27] "I'll give you a land. I'll give you
[1:00:28] crops. I'll give you rain. I'll give you
[1:00:30] blessings.
[1:00:32] Everything you need, just do what I say,
[1:00:33] I'll give it to you." They didn't have a
[1:00:34] promise. So, what they had to do, fend
[1:00:35] for themselves.
[1:00:36] They had to take thought. They had to
[1:00:38] barter. They had to exchange. They had
[1:00:39] to be creative. They had to fight. They
[1:00:41] had to war. He says, "You don't have to
[1:00:42] act like the heathen does, right? You
[1:00:45] don't have to live that way. Because
[1:00:47] your pro your heavenly father knoweth
[1:00:49] that you have need of all these things.
[1:00:51] But seek ye first the kingdom of God and
[1:00:54] his righteousness
[1:00:57] and all these things shall be added unto
[1:00:59] you.
[1:01:00] Take therefore no thought for the
[1:01:02] tomorrow. For the tomorrow shall take
[1:01:03] thought for the things of itself.
[1:01:05] Sufficient of the day is the evil
[1:01:06] thereof.
[1:01:08] Seek ye first the kingdom of God. What
[1:01:10] was the kingdom of God? The spirit. The
[1:01:12] word of the Lord made spirit and life in
[1:01:13] your own life.
[1:01:15] Christ is mystery. God revealed. We did
[1:01:16] a series on the kingdom of God. You
[1:01:17] might notice we're bringing in a lot of
[1:01:18] from different series we've preached all
[1:01:19] year long. Says, "Seek ye first the word
[1:01:22] of God made spirit and life in your own
[1:01:24] life." That's what I want to seek. The
[1:01:27] word of God made spirit and life in my
[1:01:28] life. It's that object of supreme
[1:01:30] choice,
[1:01:32] the kingdom,
[1:01:34] his righteousness,
[1:01:36] his this is what I want to pursue. His
[1:01:38] character, what is right. In other
[1:01:40] words, he's saying the heavenly
[1:01:43] and the earth will follow. Amen.
[1:01:45] Seek the heavenly. Seek that that that
[1:01:48] that that uh mystery of heaven. Seek the
[1:01:51] glories of God. Seek the revelation of
[1:01:53] God. Seek the heavenly and the earthly
[1:01:55] will be added.
[1:01:57] I'll just read through it very quickly.
[1:01:58] In the church age book, Brother Bam was
[1:02:00] talking about how God even in the
[1:02:01] Smyrnian age, he said, "I knew your
[1:02:03] poverty like a father. He looks on his
[1:02:04] family. He's the head of the household.
[1:02:06] He's the provider. He's a protector. And
[1:02:09] how the unbeliever stumbles at it? But
[1:02:11] God, how can God bear to look upon his
[1:02:14] own in a time of need and not just stop
[1:02:16] it all, just give in and lavish every
[1:02:18] material upon him? Here is where we have
[1:02:20] to believe again in the love and the
[1:02:22] goodness of the and the goodness and
[1:02:24] wisdom of God. And this is where he uses
[1:02:27] Matthew 6, take no thought for the
[1:02:29] martyr, what shall eat, what you shall
[1:02:31] put on. Your father knoweth the things
[1:02:33] you have need of. He who clothe the lily
[1:02:35] and feeds the sparrow shall do much more
[1:02:37] for you. These physical things are not
[1:02:40] the true basic necessities of your life.
[1:02:42] For a man's life consisteth not of the
[1:02:44] things he possesses, but rather seek ye
[1:02:46] first the king of God and his
[1:02:48] righteousness, and all material
[1:02:50] necessities will be added unto you.
[1:02:53] Hallelujah.
[1:02:54] Seek him first and all the material
[1:02:58] necessities will be added. You realize
[1:02:59] just how backwards we've got it. We've
[1:03:01] been trying to get all the material
[1:03:03] necessities together so that we could
[1:03:04] seek him first. Well, if I can just get
[1:03:06] a go job that allows me to be in church.
[1:03:07] If I could just get enough money to pay
[1:03:09] my tithe, if I could just do this and do
[1:03:10] that. And we're trying to get all the
[1:03:12] material necessities in place first to
[1:03:14] serve God. Like, no. No. You've got it
[1:03:16] backwards. Put me first and it'll be
[1:03:19] there for you.
[1:03:21] Put me first and it'll be there.
[1:03:24] I just been warned by so many thoughts
[1:03:27] and testimonies that we could share
[1:03:28] personally of how people even in this
[1:03:32] past year began to do the things that
[1:03:34] God asked them to do and the immediate
[1:03:36] benefits and results they begin to see
[1:03:38] from it. Whereas before maybe they
[1:03:40] thought if I could just get to a place
[1:03:41] where I can if I could just get to a
[1:03:45] place where I can and it's this sense of
[1:03:47] well I need all the basic necessities in
[1:03:48] place. I need these certain things in
[1:03:51] order for me to really give my all to
[1:03:52] God and put God first and do what I
[1:03:54] should do as a Christian. I need all
[1:03:55] these basic necessities. And God's
[1:03:57] saying, "Well, I kind of thought it
[1:03:59] might be better if
[1:04:01] you just gave your whole heart to me,
[1:04:04] and just sought me with everything that
[1:04:06] was in you, with every whatever you had.
[1:04:07] You if you could just give me your best,
[1:04:08] what you have now, your best,
[1:04:10] I'll provide the basic necessities. And
[1:04:12] with the basic necessities, you'll have
[1:04:14] the momentum you need to where your be
[1:04:16] better can become best. And your best
[1:04:19] gets best and best till it's the
[1:04:20] bestest.
[1:04:23] Psalms 37:23,
[1:04:25] the steps of a good man are ordered by
[1:04:28] the Lord.
[1:04:33] A good man here is
[1:04:35] it's quite a statement. I know we all
[1:04:37] try to want to profess to be a good man.
[1:04:40] Uh my accountant for a number of years
[1:04:42] it he would always keep his clients
[1:04:44] boxes just all around in his office and
[1:04:48] uh my box had my name Aaron McGiri and
[1:04:50] underneath it he said it said a good man
[1:04:52] nobody else had it and all my brothers
[1:04:54] and my dad they all used the same
[1:04:55] accountant so I was kind of always like
[1:04:59] right just want you to notice
[1:05:02] and who knows it might have been Goodman
[1:05:04] the Goodman corporation or something
[1:05:06] before that but I thought it was a good
[1:05:08] man you know
[1:05:10] But here it says a good man. The reason
[1:05:12] why it says a good man, it doesn't just
[1:05:14] mean only a good man because the word
[1:05:16] they're good means a strong man, a
[1:05:18] conqueror, a hero.
[1:05:20] In other words, even the most powerful
[1:05:23] must rely upon God
[1:05:25] instead of their own efforts or their
[1:05:26] own strength. The steps of even a good
[1:05:29] man, the steps of a conqueror, the
[1:05:32] steps, the steps of a strong and the
[1:05:33] wise are ordered by the Lord. If you're
[1:05:35] weak and feeble and don't have knowledge
[1:05:37] and wisdom and understanding, you might
[1:05:38] feel like, "Well, yeah, I'm just totally
[1:05:39] dependent upon the Lord." But even those
[1:05:41] that you think have it all together and
[1:05:42] are smart enough to figure it out, they
[1:05:44] too likewise should depend and must rely
[1:05:47] upon the Lord to get it right. Even the
[1:05:50] strongest, a good man, a strong a
[1:05:51] conqueror has to rely upon God and not
[1:05:53] his own strength or his own will or his
[1:05:56] own strength will fail.
[1:05:59] The steps of a good man are order of the
[1:06:01] Lord and he delightth in his way.
[1:06:06] In other words, my happiness, I can say
[1:06:08] this for all of us, our happiness comes
[1:06:09] from doing the will of God.
[1:06:12] And that's what creates that um when we
[1:06:14] preached on wonder lust and wonder lost.
[1:06:17] What what we've been we're chasing that
[1:06:19] thrill or that high that dopamine
[1:06:22] release. So, it's this natural process
[1:06:24] that we engage in as as human beings and
[1:06:27] whether it be the apps or sports or
[1:06:28] whatever it might be that kind of gives
[1:06:29] us that creates that requisite tension
[1:06:31] and there's a certain reward or payoff
[1:06:32] that comes and as as that happens and
[1:06:35] transpires then we want to do it again
[1:06:37] and with some of these things there's
[1:06:38] certain rhythms to it whether it be apps
[1:06:40] that say every day at 2:00 there's going
[1:06:41] to be a new crate chest cart whatever it
[1:06:43] might be that's released and so you
[1:06:45] can't wait you can't wait you want to
[1:06:46] open it up and see what you get and then
[1:06:48] there's other tensions where now there's
[1:06:49] a game on Monday night there's a game on
[1:06:51] Tuesday night there's a game on
[1:06:52] Wednesday night there's a game on
[1:06:52] Thursday night. There's a game on Friday
[1:06:53] night. Right. Right. Right. Now, they're
[1:06:56] starting to stack them up to where you
[1:06:57] always have these intervals where you
[1:06:58] can get tension release. Tension
[1:07:00] release. And it's creating
[1:07:02] synthesizing the joy that a believer and
[1:07:05] the stimulation a believer is supposed
[1:07:06] to get out of the word
[1:07:08] where there's some sort of tension,
[1:07:09] there's some sort of pressure. You go to
[1:07:11] the word of God. You're seeking relief.
[1:07:13] You're you're wanting to find him. And
[1:07:14] then when you find him, it gives you
[1:07:15] that thrill, gives you that benefit,
[1:07:16] gives you that stimulation. So, you find
[1:07:18] yourself torn in this cycle of feeding
[1:07:20] all the natural things. when the Bible
[1:07:23] says my I will delight in his way when I
[1:07:27] keep the good the word of the lord
[1:07:29] that there's a certain satisfaction that
[1:07:31] must come so that's what creates as
[1:07:33] there's this dopamine cycle that we get
[1:07:35] fed into we become addicted to soft
[1:07:37] addictions or whatever it might be and
[1:07:38] even hard ones follow that cycle the
[1:07:40] same thing for the word for the word of
[1:07:42] God that the more that our steps are
[1:07:44] ordered the more that we are enthused by
[1:07:46] it the more that we'll seek after it and
[1:07:48] the more that we'll find that our
[1:07:49] stimulation our excitement our
[1:07:51] motivation our inspiration and will be
[1:07:54] driven to find more of his will.
[1:07:56] You say, "Well, where do I start?" Well,
[1:07:58] just like you did with those games,
[1:08:01] button by button, step by step, and and
[1:08:04] and step into the word of God and
[1:08:06] engage. Direct all my actions, govern
[1:08:09] all my thoughts and all my affections in
[1:08:11] the way that your word prescribes them.
[1:08:13] Yes. Brother Brandman when he's
[1:08:15] preaching in Lima, Ohio, the India trip
[1:08:17] report, he says, "But I got better hopes
[1:08:19] of you, brethren, here this morning that
[1:08:21] you'll be men of God who stay with the
[1:08:22] word of God and let everything else fall
[1:08:25] right to left,
[1:08:28] but stay right with that word. Don't
[1:08:30] move." No matter if you're a doormat out
[1:08:33] there, be a good doormat. And he told us
[1:08:35] to be the best. Don't try to compete
[1:08:38] with someone else or do this. Just get
[1:08:40] right in the word. Hear this. Stay right
[1:08:43] there and God will positionally place
[1:08:46] you into his kingdom where you can be
[1:08:49] the best.
[1:08:51] Hallelujah. This is for us as
[1:08:52] individuals. Stay in the word of God.
[1:08:55] Don't compete with somebody else. Just
[1:08:57] get right in the word and stay right
[1:08:59] there. Then he can positionally place
[1:09:02] you within the promised land where your
[1:09:04] place is. And that's where you can be
[1:09:07] the best. Why aren't things improving?
[1:09:09] Why aren't things growing? Well, God's
[1:09:10] got a purpose and a reason, but let's be
[1:09:13] sure we're in the place where my better
[1:09:15] can become best.
[1:09:18] Sometimes I think we just want to run
[1:09:19] farther, hike longer, go higher, and do
[1:09:22] more. And you're out there trying to
[1:09:24] blaze a trail to keep up with the guy
[1:09:25] who's running all the way to the
[1:09:26] furthest most border to pitch his tent.
[1:09:28] And God's like, "Well, I was just going
[1:09:30] to give you the stuff right here."
[1:09:32] And you're out there chasing pies in the
[1:09:34] sky and dreams everywhere trying to find
[1:09:35] where you belong. God's like, "Well, I I
[1:09:37] don't know. I just thought maybe it
[1:09:38] might be easier. He just came right back
[1:09:40] at this is where you can be your best.
[1:09:41] No, I want to do this. I want to do
[1:09:42] that. Well, but this is where you can be
[1:09:43] your best. This is where I can bless
[1:09:45] you.
[1:09:47] He says he delights in his way. When
[1:09:50] following him step by step, that's where
[1:09:52] their satisfaction is. That's where that
[1:09:54] the wonders regained in Christ. It's a
[1:09:57] deliberate choice. When our way matches
[1:09:59] his way, it's that harmonizing of aims
[1:10:03] to where we're sub we're subject to his
[1:10:05] will. steps
[1:10:08] the steps of a good man. It's that
[1:10:10] course of life
[1:10:12] as ordered by God.
[1:10:14] And when you're following him that with
[1:10:16] those steps, then we know that any
[1:10:18] difficulty, any failure is not permanent
[1:10:21] because he's got a plan for us.
[1:10:24] And the sermon accepting God's provided
[1:10:26] way at the end time, he says, "In a
[1:10:28] church today is the same way." And I
[1:10:30] just love this language, this phrasing.
[1:10:31] I almost opened the service with it, but
[1:10:34] as we are closing here and and we we
[1:10:37] just have a a half a dozen more
[1:10:39] scriptures and about 24 other quotations
[1:10:42] to get to.
[1:10:43] Amen.
[1:10:43] But he says and accepting God's provided
[1:10:45] way at the end. And a church today is
[1:10:47] the same way. It's got to be a Bible
[1:10:49] constructed church.
[1:10:51] And I just love this. My experience is
[1:10:54] not to be the best member in the church,
[1:10:58] but an experience that's constructed by
[1:11:00] the word of God. Amen.
[1:11:01] Go ahead, take your pictures.
[1:11:05] It's a good quote. I know sometimes
[1:11:06] people are taking pictures of the quote,
[1:11:08] so here's your chance. This one's
[1:11:10] picture worthy. Come on, put this on
[1:11:11] Instagram, somebody. Not with me in it.
[1:11:14] There is Don't Please don't put on
[1:11:16] Instagram. There is so much beauty in
[1:11:19] this statement
[1:11:21] because I think that there's so much
[1:11:23] churchianity as brother Bram called it
[1:11:25] and things have become so church centric
[1:11:26] in our lives as message believers that
[1:11:29] we feel that what we need to be is the
[1:11:30] best member in the church and church
[1:11:33] just becomes a bunch of competitors
[1:11:36] trying to outdo the others so they can
[1:11:37] be the best member in the church. Man, I
[1:11:40] finally made it 30 minutes early. Oh,
[1:11:41] really? Those are rookie numbers.
[1:11:45] And we get here 45 minutes early and
[1:11:46] then somebody's over there going
[1:11:48] amateur.
[1:11:50] I was here an hour early. I'm like,
[1:11:51] "Honey, we need to be there an hour and
[1:11:53] 10." And there's still somebody over
[1:11:54] there going, "I drive two hours to get
[1:11:55] to church and I'm here 3 hours early."
[1:11:57] Right? Like just forget about it. That's
[1:12:00] But that's not what God's called us to
[1:12:02] be is the best member in the church.
[1:12:04] I Let's get it out of our minds to be
[1:12:06] the best member. That's not it at all.
[1:12:09] It has nothing to do with it. I know
[1:12:11] there might be some vernacular we might
[1:12:12] use sometime, oh, they're the best piano
[1:12:13] player. they're the best at this. And
[1:12:15] that's just a language you use to
[1:12:16] express maybe how much you love to hear
[1:12:18] this person play or they really really
[1:12:20] good at something. But when it comes
[1:12:21] down to it, he says, I I do not want to
[1:12:23] be the best member in the church, but
[1:12:25] you want to be the best.
[1:12:27] Where do you want to be be the best in
[1:12:29] your place in his kingdom? Because
[1:12:31] that's where you can be the best.
[1:12:33] So you want to be the best, but it's not
[1:12:35] to be the best church member. You want
[1:12:37] to be the best in your position. And why
[1:12:40] is that beautiful? Because there's
[1:12:41] nobody else who can be the best there.
[1:12:43] That place is for you alone. And there
[1:12:45] you can be the best. Put anybody else
[1:12:47] there and they can't be the best because
[1:12:48] that's yours. And the same goes for all
[1:12:51] of us. It's only in our place is where
[1:12:52] we can be the best. And if we're all
[1:12:54] trying to be the best church member,
[1:12:56] it's just going to be king of the hill.
[1:12:57] We'll knock you off one day. You'll get
[1:12:59] back up. Knock off the other person the
[1:13:00] other day. And it's always just going to
[1:13:01] be a big tug-of-war. Lay it down. No
[1:13:03] more tugofwarss. No more competition. No
[1:13:06] more comparison. I'm not trying to be
[1:13:08] the best church member. I just want to
[1:13:10] be the best in my place in his kingdom.
[1:13:14] Amen.
[1:13:15] I want to be the best. I want to do my
[1:13:17] best. I want to be found doing my best.
[1:13:20] Whatever it is in the house of God, let
[1:13:22] me serve my office the best that I can
[1:13:26] for him.
[1:13:29] Brothers, if you could come to your
[1:13:30] instruments,
[1:13:32] if you could just maybe concentrate now
[1:13:35] as we close.
[1:13:40] I was reading in the sermon a guide and
[1:13:43] I was drawn to it because the statement
[1:13:45] brother Brad made it about walking and
[1:13:47] he's you probably familiar with it where
[1:13:49] he's saying, "I can't even walk without
[1:13:50] you."
[1:13:52] And that really spoke to me in my I'm
[1:13:53] thinking, "Yeah, step by step. I don't
[1:13:56] even want to I don't even want to take a
[1:13:58] step without them."
[1:14:00] And and just and just, you know, I think
[1:14:02] maybe there's a spiritual type in all
[1:14:04] the counting steps
[1:14:07] on our wrists in our apps. What has it
[1:14:09] made us do? Just take steps. And then we
[1:14:12] found out that we can just bang on a
[1:14:13] piano and get stabs, right? So, we're
[1:14:15] just we're just at our desk going
[1:14:19] and and we we feel the ring and we're
[1:14:21] like, "Yeah, I'm getting so healthy.
[1:14:23] I burned 500 calories today bouncing a
[1:14:26] basketball, right? Because it it it's
[1:14:28] calculating its steps and you swing it
[1:14:31] too far and all a sudden the ambulance
[1:14:32] shows up. You had a heart attack, you
[1:14:35] got in an accident, a sudden stop or
[1:14:37] something. But there's this this we get
[1:14:39] so into counting steps to where we just
[1:14:40] think it's the steps that count.
[1:14:43] So we're just we're just into into
[1:14:45] taking steps, but you realize God's not
[1:14:47] counting steps. It's not the steps that
[1:14:50] count. It's the path.
[1:14:53] It's who's with you when you make it.
[1:14:57] I'm not I just don't want to get my my
[1:14:58] my steps in.
[1:15:01] But if he steps, I want to step.
[1:15:04] When he tells me to take a step, I'll be
[1:15:06] right there with you. I want to trust
[1:15:07] him to take the step. And I want to go
[1:15:09] step by step in his grace and in his
[1:15:11] word until I can see more of him in his
[1:15:14] program.
[1:15:16] So where my my better can become best
[1:15:21] to find my place where I can be the
[1:15:23] best.
[1:15:25] Not to be the best member in the church,
[1:15:30] but an experience that's constructed by
[1:15:32] the word of God.
[1:15:35] We could get signs put up on every
[1:15:36] single parking lot reserved for the best
[1:15:38] member in the church.
[1:15:40] Right?
[1:15:44] We've reserved the parking space that is
[1:15:46] the furthest away from the front door
[1:15:48] from the entrance for the pastor
[1:15:50] because I think that's appropriate. I
[1:15:53] was going to park in the horse barn
[1:15:54] across the street, but climbing that
[1:15:56] wall was just a little bit too tough.
[1:16:00] But it's got to be an experience. This
[1:16:02] phrasing is so beautiful. It's got to be
[1:16:04] an experience that's constructed by the
[1:16:07] word of God. Planned, laid out, built
[1:16:11] up. That beautiful
[1:16:16] bride. You've got your permit.
[1:16:19] It's all been paid for.
[1:16:23] All the materials are available. Start
[1:16:25] building.
[1:16:27] And he'll be there as your general
[1:16:31] guiding you every step of the way. And
[1:16:33] when you need a resource, he provides
[1:16:35] it. When you need to know just exactly
[1:16:37] how it fits, he gives you a revelation
[1:16:39] of the blueprints. And it's an
[1:16:41] experience constructed by the word of
[1:16:45] God. Brother Bram tells a story in a
[1:16:47] guide to how that he was out on his I
[1:16:49] think it was his honeymoon. Now I'm kind
[1:16:51] of wishing I would have uh drilled back
[1:16:53] a little bit further, but and he's got
[1:16:54] his wife down at the bottom of a hill on
[1:16:56] a snowy night. He's out hunting and he
[1:16:58] gets lost and he thinks he's going to
[1:16:59] die and his wife and baby are there.
[1:17:00] Maybe it's the anniversary trip and he's
[1:17:02] oh my, I've got this wife there and I've
[1:17:05] got this baby there and she's going to
[1:17:07] die. She won't be able to survive this
[1:17:08] night. and he's up there and so if you
[1:17:10] if you're familiar with the story, you
[1:17:11] could just nod your head and if I get
[1:17:12] enough nods, I'll just move those who
[1:17:13] don't know it behind. But he just starts
[1:17:16] putting up his hand. He's trying to get
[1:17:17] a spot where he could see the light and
[1:17:18] he know that if he could find a way and
[1:17:20] his hand hit a guide wire
[1:17:22] that he knew that ran down to the base
[1:17:24] of the hill. Just put his hands up. Oh
[1:17:26] God, help me.
[1:17:27] He found a wire and he followed it down
[1:17:29] to his waiting wife and baby and it
[1:17:31] saved his life. And he was using that as
[1:17:33] a inspiration for the sermon, a guide.
[1:17:35] And as he goes to pray at the end, he
[1:17:37] says, "Heavenly Father, I'm so thankful
[1:17:38] for the guide, the one who leads me. Oh,
[1:17:40] sometimes, Father, I can't hear him
[1:17:42] around me. I get scared. I want him
[1:17:45] close to me cuz I don't know what time
[1:17:49] I'm going to run up on the river where
[1:17:51] he's talking about getting off the road
[1:17:52] and all these things." He says, "I want
[1:17:54] him to be near me." And this prayer,
[1:17:56] this is what so struck me. Don't ever
[1:17:59] leave me, Lord. I can't talk. I can't
[1:18:02] preach. I can't hunt in the woods. I
[1:18:05] can't fish on the bank. I can't drive my
[1:18:08] car. There's nothing I can do without
[1:18:13] you.
[1:18:14] You're my guide.
[1:18:18] Don't leave me, Lord. I can't talk,
[1:18:20] preach, hunt, fish, drive. Nothing I can
[1:18:24] do without you. You are my guide.
[1:18:28] And I took from that. I can't even walk
[1:18:30] without you.
[1:18:32] How happy I am to say to this
[1:18:34] congregation tonight, I don't think I've
[1:18:36] been preaching that long, but
[1:18:38] how that you have guided me in all these
[1:18:41] things and how that you have brought me.
[1:18:45] Then he does some self-reflecting, just
[1:18:47] please bear with me as I continue. I was
[1:18:49] thinking the other day, no more than a
[1:18:51] few years ago, standing down here on the
[1:18:52] street and because that my family had
[1:18:53] done wrong and no one would talk to me.
[1:18:55] I was lonesome for fellowship. Nobody
[1:18:57] wanted anything to do with me. They said
[1:18:58] his daddy's a bootleggger and Lord saw
[1:19:01] no one would talk to me and I love
[1:19:03] people. But one day when I caught a hold
[1:19:05] of that line
[1:19:07] now I think Lord I have to slip off and
[1:19:09] get into the wilderness to get a little
[1:19:10] rest. What did it? Please catch this.
[1:19:14] Not personality, not education. I have
[1:19:17] none. But it was you Lord. You Lord.
[1:19:21] Could we take inventory and just look
[1:19:23] back? It was you Lord.
[1:19:26] All these things that I have are you
[1:19:27] from you, Lord. All this goodness. You
[1:19:30] know, sometimes we think, well, I just
[1:19:31] have a particular ability and I'm really
[1:19:32] good at this and I'm a rock star in this
[1:19:34] and I can I got can figure that out.
[1:19:36] Can't we just humble ourselves and say
[1:19:37] even in the most natural things
[1:19:39] that God blessed us with it?
[1:19:42] How can you figure it out? How do you
[1:19:43] have favor with these people? How is it
[1:19:45] that seems like whatever you think you
[1:19:46] can do, it just works for you? God did
[1:19:48] this.
[1:19:49] [Music]
[1:19:51] You let me zero the target. Now he
[1:19:53] starts talking about even being good at
[1:19:54] hunting and fishing. You let me catch
[1:19:56] the big fish because you know how I
[1:19:58] wanted to do it. You give me fathers and
[1:20:01] mothers. You give me brothers and
[1:20:02] sisters. You give me my health. You've
[1:20:04] give me a wife. You've given me family.
[1:20:07] Who is he crediting, not his pickup
[1:20:10] lines, right? Not the vision he could
[1:20:12] invite her into, but God. He said,
[1:20:15] "You're my guide, Lord. Let me hold your
[1:20:18] hand.
[1:20:20] Don't never never let me turn loose.
[1:20:24] If one hand gets weary, I'll change
[1:20:26] hands. Help me, Lord.
[1:20:29] Then he makes it so personal. And I
[1:20:31] wanted to lead up to this now. Many may
[1:20:34] each one in here take a hold of that
[1:20:36] same lifeline. Lord the Holy Spirit
[1:20:39] which is our life lifegiving resource
[1:20:42] and may it guide us all to that happy
[1:20:45] land yonder where the toils of life is
[1:20:47] over and our work on earth is done and
[1:20:49] then there'll be no more old age no
[1:20:51] feeble people no more weary nights no
[1:20:53] more crying and praying no more alter
[1:20:54] calls but will young there forever
[1:20:56] sickness and sorrow will be no more
[1:20:58] there'll be no more sin and we'll live
[1:21:00] in righteousness of God through all ages
[1:21:02] and that is to come through a ceaseless
[1:21:04] eternity grant it father what an image
[1:21:06] what a vision how am I going get there,
[1:21:08] brother. And I want to be there step by
[1:21:10] step. I want to I want to get there now.
[1:21:13] You got to find the line and just step
[1:21:14] by step. Follow it to the bottom. Follow
[1:21:17] it to the place this heavenly land yon.
[1:21:19] And now, father, this is where he makes
[1:21:20] it even more personal. If there's any in
[1:21:22] here tonight who's never had a hold of
[1:21:24] that lifeline, may they find it right
[1:21:26] now. There's any here today that have
[1:21:29] never gotten a hold of it, find it now.
[1:21:33] Find it now. Oh, and may the Holy Spirit
[1:21:35] who's guided and I can say from my heart
[1:21:36] with my hand on your word, he's always
[1:21:39] been right. I've been wrong. I'm wrong
[1:21:40] many times, but he's right. Let him stay
[1:21:43] with me, Lord. Let me stay with him. And
[1:21:45] may others in here who don't know him
[1:21:47] tonight, may they take a hold of his
[1:21:49] unchanging hand that they might be
[1:21:51] guided down.
[1:21:54] And he begins to recognize this time
[1:21:56] when we'll all be joined together. And
[1:21:58] someday we're coming out to the river.
[1:22:00] It's going to be foggy that morning,
[1:22:01] too. The old sea will be roaring. the
[1:22:03] old Jordan. The breakers dashing death
[1:22:04] choking the life out of us. But God, I
[1:22:06] won't be scared. I settled it long ago.
[1:22:10] I just want to take off the helmet as a
[1:22:11] warrior, turn around and look back down
[1:22:13] the path to see where that line has
[1:22:14] guided me to. See all the wilderness
[1:22:16] I've come through, every brier patch,
[1:22:18] every pile of stones that I got bruised
[1:22:20] on, beholden the wire.
[1:22:22] And you said, the poet said, "Some
[1:22:24] through waters and some through the
[1:22:25] flood, some through deep trials, but all
[1:22:27] through the blood." And I want to take
[1:22:29] this the old sword here that's protected
[1:22:30] me along the road and stick it back in
[1:22:32] its sheath. C scream out, "Father, send
[1:22:36] across the boat this morning. I'm coming
[1:22:37] in home. You'll be there, Lord. You
[1:22:40] promised it. You can't fail."
[1:22:44] He's praying now. And I pray this for
[1:22:46] you. Bless everyone that's here now. And
[1:22:49] if they don't know how to hold this line
[1:22:51] and never touched it, may holy hands
[1:22:54] raise up now. Wanting hands, desiring
[1:22:58] hands, and touch the lifeline that'll
[1:23:02] lead them to their heart's desire.
[1:23:04] Perfect peace and satisfaction. Rest in
[1:23:08] Christ.
[1:23:10] Could we bow our heads?
[1:23:13] Which hands are yours?
[1:23:16] Holy hands, wanting hands,
[1:23:20] desiring hands.
