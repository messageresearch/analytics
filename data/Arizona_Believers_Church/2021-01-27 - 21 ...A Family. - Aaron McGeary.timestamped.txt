[0:00] it's known amongst us now just ask if he
[0:03] would come
[0:04] and take the bread of life and feed it
[0:07] to us our gracious heavenly father
[0:10] we are gathered together tonight in your
[0:12] name
[0:13] we're gathered into a natural building
[0:16] one that may be set aside for different
[0:17] uses
[0:19] but lord we as a vessel are set aside
[0:21] for one use that's yours
[0:23] so father come now not just inhabit
[0:26] these walls and
[0:28] move along these aisles but lord make
[0:29] your presence known deep within our
[0:31] souls
[0:33] lord may it resonate in a place to where
[0:35] we can walk from here
[0:36] having been shook by your word and
[0:39] knowing that we remain
[0:41] father as i know you desire to speak to
[0:44] your people tonight i say
[0:45] come take the bread and break it to us
[0:50] lord touch every soul that is here
[0:52] tonight touch those who would be
[0:53] streaming
[0:54] lord even in the peculiarity of the
[0:56] subject matter or
[1:06] [Music]
[1:10] would lack tonight father so we commit
[1:13] it to you and pray your blessings upon
[1:14] us now
[1:15] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:17] amen
[1:18] amen i'm going to be reading from john
[1:21] chapter
[1:22] 6 and so while you're turning there we
[1:25] wanted to make a couple of announcements
[1:27] and the first one is that beginning in
[1:30] february uh february 3rd it's wednesday
[1:34] february the 3rd we are going to be
[1:36] meeting in
[1:37] a new facility and it's where we had our
[1:40] very first service as a church
[1:42] back in july and some of you may not
[1:45] even realize that that's how far back we
[1:47] started but we had
[1:48] our first service in july um at the
[1:50] hilton garden inn with this
[1:52] at this address and this facility has
[1:54] certainly been very kind to us they've
[1:56] been very gracious they've worked with
[1:58] us
[1:58] uh they just had a scheduling conflict
[2:00] and so uh
[2:01] we didn't didn't begrudge or we didn't
[2:03] feel that god was frustrated and all of
[2:05] a sudden god was looking at his calendar
[2:07] trying to figure out how this happened
[2:09] we just took it in stride knowing that
[2:10] the lord will provide
[2:12] and so brother mike has worked very hard
[2:14] on trying to
[2:15] identify another interim facility before
[2:18] the lord
[2:18] blesses us with that surprise which will
[2:20] be our our building our next building
[2:22] hopefully one more permanent than a
[2:24] hotel um
[2:25] and i'm sure there's uh this type of
[2:28] setting up and tearing down creates a
[2:30] certain desperation
[2:31] amongst different individuals and i
[2:32] believe it'll be their cry
[2:34] under the lord that'll cause him to come
[2:37] down and deliver them
[2:38] from their task masters of a pop-up
[2:41] service and so
[2:42] we appreciate everyone's labors and the
[2:44] works that they're doing um to
[2:45] facilitate this but beginning in
[2:47] february february 3rd which is a
[2:48] wednesday
[2:49] be in prayer for that service because
[2:50] it'll be our first time
[2:52] there with this new setup and having the
[2:55] the entire thing so
[2:56] beginning wednesday february 3rd and
[2:58] then continuing through the month of
[2:59] february
[3:00] that's we'll be meeting continue to be
[3:02] in prayer as it's our desire to find a
[3:03] more permanent facility
[3:05] and there's many that are working very
[3:06] tirelessly to do that and we appreciate
[3:08] it
[3:08] the next announcement just to repeat it
[3:11] this sunday night
[3:12] there's a youth service at 4 pm and
[3:15] that's correct right it's 4 p.m
[3:16] and then and there's a sign up sheet for
[3:18] those who desire to participate in the
[3:20] food
[3:21] and everyone's welcome to come i believe
[3:22] we we have a youth group that's going to
[3:24] enjoy it but also those who desire to be
[3:26] here and create the atmosphere and be a
[3:28] part of it
[3:29] you're welcome to be a part of it john
[3:31] chapter six
[3:32] i'd like to start with verse 47
[3:36] and it's one of those chapters that um
[3:40] you you'd like to begin you start
[3:43] reading where your text is going to be
[3:44] then you go back a few more you go back
[3:46] a few more and before you know it you
[3:47] want to start with genesis 1 1.
[3:49] at least here it'd be very logical to
[3:51] start where jesus multiplies
[3:53] the loaves and the fishes and how that
[3:55] in performing that miracle
[3:57] there was those that were drawn to that
[4:00] type of
[4:01] that type of manifestation and jesus
[4:04] even chastised those that come and says
[4:06] that they've come
[4:07] because their bellies were filled
[4:09] naturally and because they wanted to see
[4:11] more miracles by way of loaths and
[4:13] fishes and that's what prompts him
[4:16] to go further into what we call the
[4:18] opening of the word
[4:19] we might identify as the third pull of
[4:21] his ministry but where jesus
[4:23] isn't just emphasizing signs and wonders
[4:25] and the multiplication of loaves and
[4:27] fishes which satisfies the hunger of the
[4:29] body
[4:30] but he begins to open up the word of god
[4:32] and point to the word of god even the
[4:34] body word of the son of man
[4:36] and that's what really feeds and that's
[4:37] what really attracts
[4:39] and so that's kind of the context for
[4:41] what we're reading
[4:42] and i'd like that to be kind of in at
[4:44] the at the forefront of your thoughts as
[4:46] we go forward tonight
[4:47] so verse john chapter 6 verse 47 verily
[4:50] verily i say unto you he that believeth
[4:52] on me
[4:53] hath everlasting life i am that bread of
[4:57] life
[4:59] what bread of life that that bread that
[5:01] comes down out of from god out of heaven
[5:04] and he says your fathers did eat man in
[5:06] the wilderness and are dead
[5:07] this is the bread which cometh down from
[5:09] heaven that a man may eat thereof and
[5:11] not
[5:12] die not the natural bread not even the
[5:13] bread that your father's ate in the
[5:15] wilderness he says i
[5:16] am the bread of life eating me produces
[5:18] life
[5:19] brings life i am the living bread which
[5:21] comes
[5:22] this is the bread which cometh down from
[5:23] heaven that a man may eat thereof and
[5:25] notice this and not
[5:26] die i am the living bread which came
[5:29] down from heaven
[5:30] if any man eat of this bread he shall
[5:31] live forever and the bread that i will
[5:33] give is my flesh which i will give for
[5:35] the life of
[5:36] the world and the jews there have strove
[5:39] among themselves saying
[5:41] how can this man give us his flesh to
[5:43] eat so they're
[5:44] they're wrestling with the semantics
[5:46] they're wrestling with the rhema of what
[5:47] he's saying
[5:48] unable to catch the thought behind those
[5:51] words and they're thinking
[5:53] this guy wants us to eat his flesh and
[5:55] his blood brother branham says what is
[5:56] he a vampire
[5:57] and then jesus having discerned their
[6:00] thoughts could have said hold on i think
[6:02] you misunderstood me
[6:03] and tried to explain it but he just it
[6:05] seemingly aggravates it
[6:07] by even putting it in more controversial
[6:11] terms and jesus said unto them verse
[6:13] 53 verily verily i send you except you
[6:16] eat the flesh of the son of man
[6:17] and drink his blood ye have no life in
[6:20] you who so eateth my flesh and drinketh
[6:22] my blood
[6:23] hath eternal life and i will raise him
[6:26] up at the last day
[6:27] for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood
[6:29] is drink indeed
[6:30] he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my
[6:32] blood dwelleth in me
[6:34] and i in him as the father
[6:37] as the living father hath sent me i live
[6:39] by the father so he that eateth me
[6:42] even he shall live by me this
[6:45] is that bread which came down from
[6:47] heaven not as your fathers did eat manna
[6:49] and are dead he that eateth of this
[6:51] bread shall live
[6:53] forever amen you can be seated well
[6:55] that's exciting
[6:56] exciting to read that and i trust that
[6:59] i'll be able to come back to it
[7:00] here in a few moments i um
[7:03] well i almost forgot in the midst of all
[7:05] my announcements the most important one
[7:08] if i'm making the announcement and it's
[7:09] sister elizabeth mcgeary's birthday
[7:11] today
[7:12] so i wanted to i wanted to say that
[7:16] and i thank god i didn't forget
[7:21] i want to mention a few things just to
[7:23] connect the last couple services we've
[7:25] been ministering on we're continuing on
[7:27] the subject of a family
[7:28] this subject is so heavy on my heart
[7:30] tonight and so
[7:31] pronounced to me and it kind of captures
[7:36] some things that i had not yet uh maybe
[7:38] explicitly read to you or shared with
[7:40] you but have formed the basis for
[7:42] um this inspiration on this series that
[7:44] started within the beginning
[7:45] and evolved to in the beginning god
[7:47] created and what we've been looking at
[7:49] is a family and i i think we may be able
[7:52] to just even summarize things tonight
[7:54] such that if the lord would lead us to
[7:55] um go further into the subject of a
[7:57] family and the different roles
[7:59] uh we've laid the foundation how the god
[8:01] in the beginning here in genesis the
[8:02] first few chapters
[8:04] is is giving us an expression or an
[8:06] image of what he would like us to be
[8:08] so just a few things at the outset we've
[8:09] looked at how in the beginning god
[8:11] created
[8:12] a family and last wednesday we're
[8:14] looking we're looking at how god has
[8:15] arranged us together
[8:17] with particular responsibilities to one
[8:19] another and in doing so that created
[8:21] an agreement or covenant between among
[8:23] ourselves and amongst the different
[8:24] family members
[8:25] with rights and responsibilities to each
[8:27] one
[8:28] in on sunday morning we looked at
[8:30] proverbs 17
[8:31] 17 says a friend loveth at all times and
[8:34] the brother is born
[8:35] for adversity and there is a there's a
[8:39] way that you could use this to suggest
[8:41] that your natural
[8:42] flesh and blood you will strive with and
[8:44] there's adversity
[8:45] among siblings but the the meaning of
[8:48] this phrase that's meant in the hebrew
[8:50] and it's
[8:51] certainly referenced in other ways in
[8:52] the scripture that a brother is born
[8:54] for time of trouble and a child even a
[8:58] child is born into the family
[9:00] to be there for purpose a child is just
[9:02] not there as a consequence of an act but
[9:04] a child is born into a family
[9:06] and by virtue of its birth it has a
[9:08] purpose and then even as a child it has
[9:10] a purpose
[9:11] and you can see how that a newborn
[9:12] though helpless brings joy to a family
[9:15] and it allows a woman to step into that
[9:17] office of a mother allows a man to step
[9:19] into the office of father
[9:21] and it brings forth emotions and
[9:23] feelings that neither could have ever
[9:24] imagined
[9:25] and i can still remember the very moment
[9:28] the exact moment that elliott was born
[9:30] and then realized that there was
[9:32] feelings and a love and an affection and
[9:34] a
[9:34] an instinct to protect that i could have
[9:36] never fathomed before
[9:38] and so it took that child coming forth
[9:40] and it served a purpose even in
[9:42] calling men and women to a higher
[9:44] calling and to fulfill the role and
[9:46] responsibility as parents
[9:47] and then even for that child as they
[9:49] begin to grow they have a purpose within
[9:51] the family
[9:52] they have a responsibility even as a
[9:53] young child and maturity reveals the
[9:56] greater utility
[9:57] of that person and their duty as they
[10:00] would grow to the age of accountability
[10:02] and as they would grow further to be
[10:03] a young man or a young woman that would
[10:05] enter into marriage and
[10:06] that brings forth the responsibility of
[10:08] a spouse and then when they enter into
[10:10] parenthood
[10:11] so what i'm wanting to maybe use in that
[10:13] way as a child is born into a family a
[10:15] brother is born for a purpose
[10:17] and the scripture here just mentions
[10:18] that singular purpose of you have us
[10:20] you have a brother you have siblings you
[10:22] have family members
[10:24] to be there for you when you can't help
[10:26] yourself and when you need mercy
[10:28] and so i'd like to use it in this
[10:30] language
[10:31] that there's a scriptural covenant among
[10:33] the members in the family
[10:35] and that word covenant is a scriptural
[10:37] word we might say contract we might
[10:39] look at it as an agreement brother
[10:41] branham says a true family they're all
[10:42] in agreement and love one to another we
[10:45] have a scriptural covenant or contract
[10:48] between family members among family
[10:49] members and it's an obligation that we
[10:51] owe one another
[10:53] and it's an obligation we have to one
[10:55] another just as brothers and sisters in
[10:56] christ there's obligations we owe one
[10:58] another
[10:59] just by being human beings uh we have an
[11:02] obligation to be honest no matter who it
[11:03] is
[11:04] uh we have an obligation um to deal with
[11:06] one another fairly and to
[11:08] a and to do good unto all men and these
[11:10] are things that are established
[11:11] by scripture uh that we have a
[11:14] responsibility to
[11:15] all men and so there is a scriptural
[11:17] covenant and we were emphasizing that
[11:19] last wednesday that in these
[11:21] relationships and how we interact with
[11:23] one another
[11:24] in the duties that are imposed upon us
[11:25] by the word of god give us an
[11:27] opportunity
[11:28] to express god's character and how that
[11:31] relationships bring things out of us
[11:32] that we otherwise
[11:34] maybe would not have an opportunity to
[11:36] express
[11:38] now in genesis chapter 2 verses 15 and
[11:41] 17 we were
[11:42] identifying verse 18 in great detail
[11:45] in services past
[11:48] and it says in the lord god took the man
[11:52] and put him in the garden of eden to
[11:54] dress it
[11:55] and to keep it so he has put man on
[11:58] earth with a purpose he does not just
[11:59] say
[12:00] he created man and kind of threw him out
[12:01] there into the world but as he does it
[12:03] he gives him
[12:04] a purpose he is commanded to dress the
[12:07] the garden
[12:08] and to keep the garden and then he gives
[12:10] them this
[12:11] verbal commandment and the lord god
[12:12] commanded the man saying of
[12:14] every tree of the garden thou mayest
[12:16] freely eat
[12:17] now when he refers to the trees of the
[12:19] garden that he may freely eat he's
[12:20] referring to those that grew out of the
[12:22] ground which were good for food
[12:24] and then using symbolic language but
[12:25] representative of something that god had
[12:27] tasked the man with
[12:29] he tells him that he's placed man there
[12:31] with the covenant to dress the garden to
[12:33] keep the garden
[12:34] and now he tells him you can eat of
[12:36] every tree in the garden and that
[12:37] certainly connected with the commandment
[12:39] that he had
[12:39] and now he cautions him in verse 17 but
[12:42] of the tree of the knowledge of good and
[12:44] evil
[12:44] thou shalt not eat of it for in the day
[12:47] that thou eatest thereof
[12:48] thou shalt surely die this is
[12:52] god giving adam something for him to
[12:56] keep
[12:57] and it's put in this context he says if
[12:59] you will he's telling them
[13:01] commanded to eat of every tree and if
[13:03] you eat of every tree of the garden
[13:04] you're free to do so but there's a tree
[13:05] of knowledge of good and evil
[13:06] that thou shalt not eat of it for if you
[13:09] do
[13:10] if you will keep my commandment and not
[13:12] eat of the tree of knowledge of good and
[13:13] evil you will live forever
[13:15] but if you don't in that day you'll die
[13:18] now this is what brother adam referred
[13:19] to as the eden covenant
[13:21] he referred to it in another place as
[13:23] the adam covenant
[13:24] so god had brought forth a son he had
[13:27] brought forth the daughter god the
[13:28] father with the son and daughter
[13:30] then established a covenant with his
[13:32] children called the adam covenant or the
[13:34] eden covenant and it was the family of
[13:36] god
[13:36] arranged together to to one another with
[13:39] rights and responsibilities with the
[13:40] covenant between themselves
[13:42] but then also a covenant that they had
[13:44] with god that they are to eat of every
[13:46] tree of the garden
[13:47] for that for just the sustaining of the
[13:50] flesh and to
[13:51] to enjoy but of this tree of the
[13:53] knowledge of good and evil
[13:54] if they ate of that then they would die
[13:57] so i'm just
[13:58] using this and i maybe might have done
[14:02] served me well just to say in the
[14:03] beginning just kind of stay with me
[14:05] i just feel like i'm i'm going to be
[14:08] going down a path very quickly tonight
[14:10] very focused very direct and just
[14:12] hitting it one after another so i
[14:14] appreciate
[14:15] your attentiveness tonight but god gave
[14:17] man genesis chapter 2 verses 15 to 17
[14:20] god is giving man a word that he must
[14:23] keep
[14:24] this is the one thing if we join it with
[14:26] genesis 1 28 this is one thing we can
[14:28] point to said god put man on earth
[14:30] to dress and keep the garden god put man
[14:32] on earth to be fruitful multiply and
[14:34] replenish the earth
[14:35] and have dominion over all the all the
[14:37] all the creatures and over the earth
[14:39] and that god also told him that he had
[14:41] to draft that he had to
[14:42] not eat of the tree of knowledge of good
[14:44] and evil we could put all these
[14:46] scriptures together and say this is the
[14:47] eden covenant
[14:49] this is the covenant that god made with
[14:50] abraham if you will do this you will
[14:52] live forever
[14:53] but if you don't you will die and so
[14:55] this is something that
[14:57] as long as adam kept up his end death
[15:00] could not enter in
[15:02] now if you look at verse 15 again it
[15:05] says and the lord god took the man
[15:08] and put him into the garden of eden to
[15:11] dress it
[15:12] and to keep it so this speaks of
[15:14] responsibilities that the man and the
[15:16] woman would share
[15:18] and i want to identify this here though
[15:20] we could we've done it in other places
[15:21] but i want to just use it right here
[15:23] when god says he put the man in the
[15:25] garden of eden
[15:26] we know that the garden scripturally is
[15:28] symbolic of a spouse
[15:30] and so there's an image of a spouse
[15:32] being something that is kept that is
[15:33] protected that is looked after
[15:35] and so he put the man in the garden of
[15:37] eden to dress it and to keep it
[15:39] and this arrangement that god places the
[15:41] man to the garden is even symbolic of
[15:43] the responsibility
[15:44] that the man would have over his wife
[15:47] it's it's uh
[15:48] symbolic of the responsibility that adam
[15:51] would have been given
[15:52] over the woman and so in the message
[15:54] satan's eden
[15:55] brother branham refers to this image
[15:59] of man and woman in the garden having
[16:01] faith in all his word his seeds
[16:03] brought an eden of holiness love and
[16:05] eternal life
[16:06] that's what god's eden produced holiness
[16:10] and we looked at this in great detail in
[16:11] a couple services last year
[16:13] he says and it brought an eden of
[16:15] holiness of love understanding
[16:17] perfection
[16:17] and eternal life so this is brother
[16:20] branham describing what was in the
[16:21] beginning
[16:22] a perfect eden that came forth by god's
[16:25] word by his seeds producing
[16:27] he says that's what that is what god is
[16:29] planting
[16:30] his word his seed so he planted it then
[16:33] now there's something that's been
[16:34] planted that's going to come to maturity
[16:36] and he says
[16:36] that's what his church will be at the
[16:38] end it will be
[16:39] the same thing what is it going to be
[16:42] it's going to be like a garden
[16:43] it's going to be like a garden which was
[16:45] planted by god that brought forth seed
[16:47] that brings forth fruit that
[16:48] produces the very fruit of god it's the
[16:51] manifestation of the word of god that
[16:53] comes forth in its fullness
[16:54] just as god wrote in isaiah and this
[16:57] vineyard i will keep i will
[16:58] water it i will protect it i will make
[17:00] sure that it's fruitful and it'll come
[17:01] forth
[17:02] brother branham saying that god has
[17:04] planted this bride he will bring her
[17:06] forth in the end she will come forth
[17:08] as an eden of holiness not satan's eden
[17:10] but a guard another garden of eden it's
[17:12] the tree of life restored back to him
[17:14] she stands radiant in the fruits of god
[17:17] uh
[17:18] being born through her flesh through her
[17:20] body and brother branham's saying that's
[17:22] what his church will be at the end
[17:23] she's going to be in eden so there's
[17:25] this parallel that we've identified how
[17:28] that the guard is representative of a
[17:29] spouse
[17:30] that the bride is likened into a
[17:32] vineyard and that
[17:34] the bride in the end is going to be an
[17:36] eden of holiness of love
[17:37] understanding perfection and eternal
[17:39] life
[17:40] so in ephesians chapter 5 verses 25 to
[17:43] 28
[17:45] paul says husbands love your wives even
[17:48] as christ
[17:49] also loved the church and gave himself
[17:51] for it
[17:52] so now paul is speaking directly to
[17:56] husbands
[17:56] and he's telling them that they're under
[17:58] a scriptural duty to
[18:00] love their wives and to clarify that
[18:02] duty and to even
[18:03] whether whether you want to say to
[18:04] qualify it or to clarify it
[18:06] he says the standard by which i am
[18:08] asking you to love your spouse or to
[18:10] love your wives
[18:11] is to do so as christ loved the church
[18:14] and this is a love which is not
[18:15] necessarily demanding in what you can do
[18:17] for me but as a sacrificial love
[18:19] because he says love your wives as
[18:22] christ loved the church
[18:23] who gave himself in service to his wife
[18:27] and the service and this giving and this
[18:29] attitude that he took towards the church
[18:31] was that he might sanctify and cleanse
[18:33] it with the washing of water
[18:35] by the word so this produces a parallel
[18:38] that a husband has a responsibility if
[18:40] he loves his wife as christ loves the
[18:42] church
[18:42] that there's some sacrificial service
[18:44] that when he does this
[18:46] it sanctifies and cleanses his wife
[18:49] and then it says that he might present
[18:51] it to himself a glorious church
[18:53] not having spot or wrinkle or any such
[18:55] thing but that it should be holy and
[18:56] without blemish
[18:58] now this is placing before us
[19:01] a particular image that we understand is
[19:04] produced
[19:05] by the word of god and by a perfect man
[19:08] right and he's asking us who are not
[19:11] perfect
[19:12] to love our wives perfectly and to use
[19:15] this as our standard
[19:16] and he's not setting it up so that we
[19:18] would fail but it's to take us out of a
[19:20] mindset maybe a carnal mindset out of
[19:23] pictures that aren't correct about these
[19:25] relationships and and stabilize them and
[19:27] center them and place them as they
[19:29] should be because
[19:30] after he has set forth how christ loves
[19:32] the church he says so ought men to love
[19:34] their wives as their own bodies
[19:36] so though you may not be able to do to
[19:38] your wife what christ is able to do to
[19:40] the bride
[19:41] look we can't give our wives a new body
[19:43] that will never die right
[19:45] but we can help her look after and care
[19:47] for the one that she has so we're not
[19:49] saying that there's some
[19:50] sort of parallel whereas he can heal we
[19:52] ought to be able to heal and where he
[19:53] can forgive sins we ought to be able to
[19:54] forgive sins
[19:55] in the same way that he does but there's
[19:57] parallels how that we can respond
[19:59] and react and live for our wives that
[20:02] christ has done spiritually we do so
[20:05] within the context of our marriages
[20:07] naturally
[20:08] and that's not what i'm emphasizing i'm
[20:09] just trying to bring these thoughts
[20:11] before us
[20:12] so so what meant to love their wives as
[20:13] their own bodies he that loveth his wife
[20:16] loveth himself and and i would have
[20:18] liked to have read more how he begins to
[20:20] talk about how
[20:20] no man hates his own flesh and then he
[20:22] speaks of this mystery
[20:24] of christ in his bride but paul
[20:27] when he when he uses these this
[20:29] admonishment to the man
[20:31] what i want you to pick up is that he's
[20:33] hearkening back to the original marriage
[20:34] agreement
[20:36] that paul is not using moses's treatment
[20:39] of marriage he's not using some other
[20:42] reference point he's actually going all
[20:44] the way back to the beginning
[20:45] and he begins to speak how that for this
[20:47] cause shall man leave his father and
[20:49] mother and they shall be one flesh and i
[20:51] i did leave out that out and it would
[20:52] have been appropriate to read it and
[20:54] that's how
[20:55] we see that paul is drawing from the
[20:57] original marriage covenant
[20:58] so if you want to go back and read that
[21:00] more plainly i accidentally just cut
[21:02] this a little bit short when i was
[21:04] trying to shorten up my notes this
[21:06] afternoon paul
[21:07] when he's speaking this he goes back and
[21:09] he quotes genesis chapter 2.
[21:11] he quotes this unction for this cause
[21:14] shall a man leave his father and mother
[21:16] so when paul says husbands love your
[21:18] wives as christ did who gave himself who
[21:20] he labors that he might sanctify and
[21:22] cleanse to present
[21:23] and to keep free from any harm he's
[21:26] telling us
[21:27] that we are now to live under that
[21:30] covenant or in likeness as christ loves
[21:32] the church
[21:32] he's bringing us back and pointing us to
[21:34] how it was in the beginning
[21:36] because adam was asked and this is where
[21:38] we can see the parallel he put the man
[21:40] in the garden to dress it and to keep it
[21:42] to dress means to work for another to
[21:44] serve another by labor
[21:46] so adam was tasked though he was god and
[21:48] though he was the lord and though he was
[21:50] the
[21:50] the most supreme one on earth he had a
[21:52] responsibility to work for another to
[21:54] serve another
[21:55] and this duty was to the woman there
[21:58] were co-laborers together and it says to
[22:00] keep which mr guard protect
[22:02] or to save life and we can see that adam
[22:05] walked in the parallel and he lived that
[22:07] parallel his brother madam dramatizes to
[22:09] us or expresses it to us this way
[22:11] that when the woman fell that adam went
[22:13] to her and acted and the way that he
[22:15] acted actually preserved her life
[22:19] and so i'm just kind of laying this
[22:21] these things out in seed form
[22:24] that there were duties and
[22:26] responsibilities
[22:28] that adam had to keep and the woman had
[22:30] to keep and they related to one another
[22:32] and it related to creation
[22:34] and paul is referring to duties and
[22:35] responsibilities that a spouse
[22:37] ought to willingly keep and they relate
[22:41] to this eden covenant you can see
[22:42] parallels in the even eden covenant
[22:45] now this is the statement that maybe fi
[22:47] that becomes this
[22:48] turning point and it connects it to
[22:50] where i want to go next brother benham
[22:52] writes this in the church age book
[22:54] god's intention for his creation man
[22:57] is to express his words
[23:00] doesn't that just put it so succinctly
[23:02] that what what what did god want to do
[23:04] he wanted his words to be expressed
[23:06] how is he going to achieve it not just
[23:08] through creation but through man
[23:10] he says god's intention for his creation
[23:12] we say well the things of god are known
[23:13] in the creation around us
[23:15] but he wants to bring it down to this
[23:16] this particular expression that man
[23:18] mankind adam and the woman
[23:19] were his intent in bringing them forth
[23:21] was to express his words
[23:23] he says in genesis adam was given the
[23:25] word to live by now ponder that
[23:27] god's intention for his creation man was
[23:31] to express
[23:31] his words so in genesis god gave adam a
[23:34] word to live by what does that tell us
[23:37] that living by the word would express
[23:39] god's word
[23:40] and so when he gave adam genesis 1 28
[23:43] when he gave him genesis 2 15 to 17
[23:45] this was the how that god's word would
[23:47] be expressed he gave him a word to live
[23:49] by if adam kept that word then the word
[23:52] of god would be expressed
[23:53] and even all the mysteries that had not
[23:55] been uh verbalized
[23:57] in the creation and laid there in seed
[23:59] form adam would have brought them forth
[24:01] and they would have expressed been
[24:02] expressed as he just
[24:04] lived the life just lived the life
[24:06] according to the word god's words would
[24:08] have been expressed
[24:08] so brother branham brings it this way
[24:11] which to me summarizes it
[24:13] so well a life lived by the word would
[24:16] be
[24:16] the word expressed now we often think
[24:19] about the full word being born into
[24:21] manifestation and the seven seals were
[24:23] open and what was that that was the open
[24:24] of the word
[24:25] to reveal christ and we can use very
[24:28] we can use a language that describes
[24:31] mysteries and thunders and seals and the
[24:33] book of revelation and the third pull
[24:35] and all these different terms and we
[24:37] love it it's fantastic it's energizing
[24:39] it's inspiring
[24:40] but there's a point at which we can just
[24:42] start using using these phrases to keep
[24:45] getting lifted up and lifted up and at
[24:46] some point we can actually kind of leave
[24:49] the very realm that god wants it to be
[24:50] the most relevant in
[24:52] because if the third pull is the
[24:54] revealed word if the third pulls the
[24:56] open of those seals to reveal christ
[24:58] then there is a revealing of christ in a
[25:00] spiritual realm there is a presence of
[25:01] jesus christ
[25:02] when he is here now revealing himself to
[25:04] the bride making himself known to the
[25:06] individual there's a marriage that's
[25:07] taking place there's a union that's
[25:09] taking place
[25:10] but brother adam says that that's not
[25:12] the fullness of the word being expressed
[25:14] the fullness of the word being expressed
[25:16] is when a life is lived by that word
[25:19] so when you have a life lived by the
[25:20] seventh seal when you have a life lived
[25:22] by the third pool when you have a life
[25:24] lived by the seven thunders
[25:25] that's the word being born into full
[25:27] manifestation
[25:29] not just as brother branham expressed it
[25:31] when he preached the seals not just as
[25:32] he preached christ as the mystery
[25:34] not as 63 64 and 65 unfolded and then we
[25:37] put the period there at the end of his
[25:38] ministry and said that's the full word
[25:40] being born into manifestation
[25:42] but when you even if it's just one of
[25:43] yours takes the word of god and lives it
[25:46] that's the word being born into full
[25:48] manifestation again
[25:50] even if it's just one and if it's only
[25:53] going to be one
[25:53] i want to do everything i can if i'm not
[25:55] going to be that one to help the one
[25:57] who's going to do it do it
[25:59] i don't want to stand in anybody's way
[26:01] if i'm not going to do it then i want to
[26:02] help somebody else do it
[26:03] i'm going to say well if i can't be the
[26:04] one that brings the full word born into
[26:05] manifestation then i don't want them do
[26:07] i say lord
[26:08] my way even to get into eternal life at
[26:10] white throne judgment
[26:11] is to serve some purpose and do
[26:12] something right so i want to help that
[26:14] one if there's only going to be one
[26:17] because a life lived by the word is
[26:19] going to be the word expressed
[26:21] so the expression of the word in the end
[26:22] time cannot come apart
[26:24] from it being lived
[26:28] and so as we could bring this picture
[26:30] out more fully in the garden of eden
[26:33] in greater detail i'd like just to maybe
[26:36] put it in this way so we can just use it
[26:37] as a building block the life
[26:39] that adam and eve lived according to the
[26:42] word according to that covenant would
[26:44] have been the word expressed
[26:46] that adam covenant that eden covenant
[26:48] they would have kept that
[26:49] that would have been a life lived
[26:50] according to the word and that would
[26:52] have been the word expressed
[26:54] now if i could put it this way
[26:58] what i want to do with this is a
[27:00] foundation
[27:02] and uh it's it's 7 47 so i'll try to
[27:05] pilot this
[27:06] you know to to an early close but
[27:10] i want to use the remainder of this
[27:12] service to give context
[27:13] to all the relationships we have he said
[27:16] well that sounds like a
[27:17] pretty lofty idea it's very simple
[27:20] but i want us to ponder what kind of
[27:22] relationships we have to one another
[27:23] what kind of relationship i would have
[27:24] to a friend the kind of relationship i'd
[27:26] have to children the relationship
[27:27] that i would have to uh within a church
[27:30] officers amongst themselves and song
[27:31] leader to congregation however you'd
[27:33] want to look at
[27:34] what's the context to all these roles
[27:35] and responsibilities we have what's the
[27:37] purpose
[27:38] of being a brother and a family what's
[27:40] the purpose of being a son or daughter
[27:41] to a father and mother what's the
[27:43] purpose of being a wife
[27:44] and you try to make sense of all these
[27:45] things and what i find what's the most
[27:48] easy thing to do
[27:49] is to get lost in all the relationships
[27:51] and the responsibilities
[27:52] and feel that they demand so much of our
[27:54] time and our energy and we get
[27:55] so stretched then that those very
[27:57] relationships and responsibilities to
[27:59] children responsibilities at work and
[28:01] all these things that we have to do
[28:02] they begin to weigh us down because we
[28:04] feel as if they're taking us away from
[28:06] the word of god
[28:07] and the purpose that we have in this end
[28:09] time but what i want you to be able to
[28:11] see
[28:12] that though it may weigh you down if
[28:14] you're fulfilling your purpose
[28:16] in that calling there's no loss in that
[28:19] weight
[28:21] that that there's no there's not two
[28:23] separate things where you've got the
[28:24] word of god being born into full
[28:25] manifestation and if i could just
[28:27] somehow not have to worry about being a
[28:28] husband if i could somehow just stop
[28:30] worrying about paying the bills
[28:31] no there's got to come a revelation that
[28:33] takes all these things over here in the
[28:35] natural
[28:36] harmonizes it with all these things in
[28:37] the spiritual and sometimes what it
[28:39] takes is for you to truly understand how
[28:41] the spiritual
[28:42] longs to have harmony and union with the
[28:44] natural in order for it to have real
[28:46] expression
[28:48] we could sit around all day long and
[28:49] talk about a perfect bride
[28:51] and feel really good about ourselves as
[28:53] long as it's just some kind of ethereal
[28:54] thing that's just kind of out there
[28:56] nothing ever really that has to be
[28:58] concrete and lived out
[29:00] but he wants it lived out and so in
[29:03] genesis chapter 3 verse 6
[29:10] i i'm just going to be throwing out some
[29:12] principles
[29:13] um even on this aspect of the eating the
[29:16] asp
[29:17] aspects of a covenant and new covenant
[29:19] just some things out there
[29:21] to kind of give us a little bit of a
[29:22] push further and
[29:24] when the woman saw that the tree was
[29:25] good for food and that it was pleasant
[29:28] to the eyes
[29:29] and a tree desired to make one wise this
[29:31] is in direct contradiction to what god
[29:33] said about the tree
[29:34] god never said this tree was good for
[29:36] food
[29:37] and pleasant to the eyes means it was
[29:39] lustful to the flesh it wasn't something
[29:41] that was just pretty to look at
[29:43] it describes the fruit in the beginning
[29:45] that was pleasant to the sight
[29:46] that meant that it was a something that
[29:48] when you looked at
[29:49] that it was actually it was physically
[29:51] beautiful but here there's something
[29:52] being stirred up inside of her
[29:54] as as we've i think i've made even the
[29:56] statement here i've been hungry before
[29:58] but i've never looked at food this way
[30:01] and this and the meaning behind the
[30:03] scripture is not how one would look at a
[30:05] meal
[30:05] says in a tree desire to make one wise
[30:07] she took the fruit thereof
[30:08] and did eat and gave also under a
[30:11] husband with her and
[30:13] he did eat so there's something now
[30:16] that they both did we know it's symbolic
[30:18] we know it's representative of a
[30:19] particular act
[30:20] so when she says that she saw that it
[30:22] was good for food let's not just think
[30:23] in our minds
[30:24] that it was something that was good to
[30:26] literally eat but rather it was
[30:28] something connected with something else
[30:30] and she thought it had use to bring
[30:32] forth something else
[30:33] just as god told him in the beginning
[30:35] that of all the trees that grow out of
[30:36] the ground of every tree of the garden
[30:38] thou mayest freely eat what would it be
[30:39] good for for sustaining life sustaining
[30:41] flesh it would be something
[30:43] that they could enjoy but now when she
[30:45] saw the tree of the knowledge of good
[30:46] and evil that god said
[30:48] it's not that you should not eat it she
[30:50] saw that it was good for something
[30:52] in other words she saw something in that
[30:54] to live by
[30:56] she saw it as something that would bring
[30:58] life this is good for life this will
[30:59] make us wise this will cause us to
[31:01] mature
[31:02] this will bring out some further
[31:03] expression of us so she took in it and
[31:05] then she gave it to her husband
[31:06] they're not physically eating they're
[31:08] not literally eating but it's symbolic
[31:10] of of of life coming forth or
[31:12] procreation
[31:13] so it relates to just re uh fulfilling
[31:16] responsibilities assuming particular
[31:18] roles
[31:19] and it relates to life it relates to
[31:22] relationships
[31:24] and so in and i hold that remember that
[31:26] she saw it was good for food it was good
[31:28] to live by it was something good to
[31:29] bring forth life it was something
[31:30] that would enrich relationship is
[31:32] something that we ought to do as a
[31:33] course of life
[31:35] and so when the woman did this she
[31:37] breached her covenant to adam which was
[31:38] her husband
[31:40] and we say also to god because she was
[31:42] under the requirement not to do so but
[31:43] then adam broke his covenant to god
[31:46] and so and we know there's certain
[31:48] representations in that but notice now
[31:50] the eden covenant the adam covenant
[31:52] was adam if you will then you will never
[31:55] and now in doing so he failed to keep
[31:57] the conditions of the eden covenant
[32:00] he failed to live by the word so in what
[32:02] he did this was not the word being
[32:04] expressed
[32:04] he left the image he left the blueprint
[32:06] he left the direction that he ought to
[32:08] go
[32:08] and so the breach of the covenant is
[32:10] expressed symbolically as eating
[32:14] we realize this is something symbolic
[32:17] and in that eating and partaking of it
[32:19] it brought forth death
[32:22] and this is him failing to keep that
[32:25] covenant
[32:26] now in luke chapter 4 brother branham
[32:29] tells us that the
[32:30] temptation of eve in the beginning
[32:33] was is represented in the lust of the
[32:35] eyes the lust of the flesh and the pride
[32:36] of life
[32:37] and the temptations of the woman in the
[32:39] garden of eden correspond
[32:41] to those three different things that are
[32:43] in the world then brother branham
[32:45] teaches us that the temptation of christ
[32:47] corresponds to the temptation of eve so
[32:50] as the eve
[32:51] as e the woman was tempted in the
[32:52] beginning by the serpent christ now goes
[32:55] into the wilderness
[32:56] and he's tempted of the devil and the
[32:58] temptation of him relates to the lust of
[33:00] the flesh the lust of the eyes and the
[33:02] pride of life
[33:03] and jesus in answering he says well
[33:05] commanded these stones to be made bread
[33:06] and eat of them
[33:07] that was to satisfy this hunger that
[33:09] jesus had in his natural
[33:11] body but he says it is written that man
[33:14] shall not
[33:14] live by bread alone but by every word of
[33:17] god
[33:18] in matthew it speaks of the word of god
[33:20] every word of god that proceedeth
[33:21] everywhere that proceedeth out of the
[33:23] mouth of god
[33:24] so it's this is the construct we know
[33:27] that we
[33:27] live naturally by partaking of fruit or
[33:30] bread
[33:31] and in the beginning adam and the woman
[33:32] would have eaten of every tree in the
[33:34] garden that grew from the ground and
[33:35] they would have lived but as long as
[33:36] they didn't eat of the tree of knowledge
[33:38] of good and evil
[33:39] they would have continued to live now
[33:40] jesus says that man cannot solely live
[33:43] by just satisfying the flesh man cannot
[33:47] solely live by making sure that he has
[33:48] provision
[33:49] of what he may eat and what he may drink
[33:51] and how he'll be clothed and where he
[33:52] may sleep
[33:53] but man has an obligation to live by the
[33:56] word of god
[33:57] so eating means more than just what you
[33:59] do when you sit down for lunch or you
[34:01] sit down for dinner but eating
[34:02] represents the manner of life
[34:04] it represents the way that we live the
[34:06] way that we conduct ourselves it has to
[34:08] do with our thinking it has to do with
[34:09] our speaking
[34:10] it has to do with our conduct it's not
[34:12] just the act of eating
[34:14] when she saw that it was good for food
[34:15] it didn't just mean that she was hungry
[34:17] but it spoke of something that she would
[34:19] do
[34:19] something she would act and something
[34:20] that would bring out another calling
[34:22] within her life when jesus says man
[34:24] shall not live by bread alone
[34:26] it's not just the eating he's referring
[34:28] to but we must live by the word of god
[34:33] this is this is
[34:35] this is now you can see this was the
[34:37] covenant in the beginning but now
[34:38] mankind
[34:39] is being introduced to another covenant
[34:42] because god established a new covenant
[34:45] so that the purpose of his creation
[34:47] would be satisfied
[34:48] god didn't start all over again but he
[34:50] made a conditional covenant with adam he
[34:52] made a conditional covenant with noah
[34:54] but what happens in genesis chapter 12.
[34:56] this is an unconditional covenant and i
[34:58] realize there's some paradox to it but
[35:00] when god made his covenant with abraham
[35:02] that was one that he has not annulled or
[35:05] broken even if abraham stumbled in it
[35:07] even if israel stumbled in it god made a
[35:10] promise he would bring forth a seed and
[35:11] guess what
[35:12] he done it amen the seed which was
[35:14] christ came why did it happen
[35:16] not because man kept his in but even
[35:19] though god was requiring something of
[35:21] abraham requiring something of israel
[35:23] god said you know what i will i will i
[35:25] will
[35:27] it wasn't up to abraham it wasn't up to
[35:29] somebody else but god said i'm going to
[35:30] do it i'm going to see that it's done
[35:32] through your weaknesses through your
[35:33] failures through your ups and downs and
[35:35] you're in and out
[35:36] i have made a promise and i'm going to
[35:37] keep it
[35:39] and so with adam conditional covenant
[35:41] with noah conditional covenant with
[35:42] abraham in genesis 12 if you read those
[35:44] first few verses
[35:45] this is an unconditional covenant and
[35:48] christ
[35:49] is that seed through which all the seed
[35:50] of abraham is to be blessed
[35:53] now christ i just want to use this very
[35:54] quickly in matthew chapter 26 verse 28.
[35:58] when he's saying take eat of the bread
[36:00] this is my body which is broken for you
[36:02] and then he says he says drink also of
[36:05] this cup for this is my blood of the new
[36:06] testament
[36:07] which is shed for the remission of shed
[36:09] for many for the remission of sins
[36:13] the new testament the word testament
[36:15] there is covenant
[36:16] this is my new contract my new agreement
[36:19] this is a new
[36:20] disposition or arrangement of things
[36:22] he's introducing a new order
[36:24] not dependent solely on what we will do
[36:26] as it was with adam
[36:27] not dependent upon us as it was with
[36:29] noah be saying this is the new covenant
[36:32] which is the blood of the new covenant
[36:33] which is shed for the remission of sins
[36:35] so now i'm going to do this and with the
[36:38] shedding of my blood it remits your sins
[36:40] it's going to bring you into fellowship
[36:42] so that you can be new creatures
[36:44] and paul amplifies this new covenant
[36:46] through many of his writings
[36:47] and so with this idea now that christ
[36:50] then becomes
[36:51] this new covenant the one that's the
[36:53] bearer of a new covenant the one that
[36:54] says this is valid this is enforceable
[36:56] this is the new agreement that i write
[36:58] with you this is the covenant which i
[36:59] will have with you
[37:00] that i will keep with you that i will
[37:02] wash you of your sins and that
[37:04] i'll write the word upon your heart your
[37:05] sins and iniquities will be remembered
[37:07] no more against you god giving this
[37:09] foreshadowing in the old testament that
[37:10] there's going to come a new covenant
[37:13] there was when adam send consequence
[37:15] when noah sent consequence
[37:16] but now we say look i'm going to make a
[37:18] covenant with you that is so
[37:20] unconditional that your sins and your
[37:22] iniquities will be remembered no more
[37:24] against you
[37:26] and it's not like he just sets a restart
[37:27] date and says all right from this moment
[37:29] on everything in the past i've forgotten
[37:31] but if you make another mistake then
[37:33] sorry you got one shot at it
[37:35] it's not even that way am i right or am
[37:38] i right
[37:40] all of our sins past present future he
[37:42] has told the elect
[37:43] listen i've atoned for it amen so well
[37:45] i'm 45 years old and i've been sinning
[37:47] for 45 years i accept your forgiveness
[37:49] lord thank you i'm washed i'm cleansed
[37:51] i'm justified i'm going forward and then
[37:53] you make another mistake and he goes oh
[37:54] man you should have waited to claim that
[37:57] you should have waited because you can
[37:58] only use it once
[38:00] and and listen this isn't a board game
[38:02] where you can only get out of jail once
[38:03] with that card and then you forfeit it
[38:05] he's basically told you this is a new
[38:07] covenant that i make with you
[38:09] and we're under this new covenant and
[38:12] under this new covenant
[38:14] this is now the connection i want to
[38:15] make and i feel like this is just the
[38:16] pathway we have to go
[38:18] to understand this not to understand it
[38:20] rather but for me to express it
[38:23] but under this new covenant it fulfills
[38:26] the promise of the original covenant
[38:28] because god has not abandoned what he
[38:30] wanted to do in the beginning
[38:33] and he has not said well i'll start over
[38:34] with christ but rather christ
[38:36] is the seed of genesis 1 20. christ is
[38:38] the seed of genesis 3 15.
[38:40] christ revives and resurrects all the
[38:42] potential impossibility
[38:44] that the first adam had and we're taught
[38:46] that we see that jesus christ is acting
[38:48] even in john chapter 6
[38:49] by multiplying the loaves and the fish
[38:51] is showing that something that adam lost
[38:53] in the fall is being restored back to
[38:55] mankind
[38:56] and so now christ then is introducing to
[38:59] us the new covenant by new birth we're
[39:01] brought into this new covenant
[39:02] and that original covenant is made void
[39:04] by eating
[39:06] right it was void by conduct it was void
[39:09] by the way that the woman acted by the
[39:10] way that the man acted
[39:12] now just to use a few statements to show
[39:15] that
[39:16] under this new covenant we are now under
[39:18] an unconditional covenant with god
[39:20] that he will through us fulfill what he
[39:23] originally desired to fulfill in genesis
[39:25] 1 and 2.
[39:26] listen to how brother branham writes
[39:27] this this is in the revelation of jesus
[39:29] christ chapter 1 of the church age book
[39:31] as adam and eve were in the garden and
[39:33] did not finish out the thousand years
[39:35] we understand that
[39:39] that there was not a thousand years
[39:40] lived by adam and the woman
[39:43] he says now jesus our last adam and his
[39:46] eve
[39:47] now let me just and he says true church
[39:49] so let me just step in here and say this
[39:51] that brother branham is he could have
[39:54] finished this statement by saying
[39:56] and i could try to cover it up so you
[39:57] don't finish it and so that
[39:59] my thunder's kind of stolen here but he
[40:02] does not just say that
[40:03] adam the last adam and the true church
[40:06] will live out a thousand years in the
[40:07] millennium
[40:08] he's not just saying that because we
[40:10] know that's true that we will do that
[40:12] and that's done to fulfill things that
[40:14] were lacking in the beginning and things
[40:16] that didn't happen in adam and the woman
[40:17] it's kind of that
[40:18] that honeymoon that man never lived out
[40:21] he says
[40:22] jesus our last adam and his eve the true
[40:24] church
[40:25] will fulfill what all the plan
[40:28] of god so it's not just limited to a
[40:31] thousand years on earth in the
[40:32] millennium
[40:33] it's actually he's saying look whatever
[40:35] god's plan was in the beginning
[40:37] he is summoning up his climax in it and
[40:40] he's finishing it through the true
[40:41] church
[40:43] can you can you catch that i think
[40:44] there's so much weight there i want you
[40:46] to understand that he says
[40:46] that christ and his bride will fulfill
[40:50] all the plan of god as initially
[40:53] expressed and given to adam and the
[40:55] woman
[40:56] whatever his plan and purpose was
[40:57] remember his purpose was that a life
[40:59] lived by the word would be the word
[41:00] expressed
[41:01] now the bride is going to fulfill that
[41:03] potential
[41:05] he writes in chapter 5 of the church
[41:07] book by and through the members of the
[41:08] bride will be fulfilled
[41:10] all that was promised of god to be made
[41:12] manifest in
[41:13] the virgin so now there's a language
[41:15] that he's using that is not just
[41:17] exclusive to a millennial reign
[41:19] that is not exclusive to just one
[41:21] provision but they will fulfill
[41:22] all the plan of god and now whatever
[41:25] potential that the woman held in
[41:26] relationship to her husband
[41:28] she will now fulfill all that was
[41:30] promised of god to be made manifest
[41:32] in the virgin this is not something she
[41:34] can do by herself this is not something
[41:36] that she could have done without adam
[41:38] but it's representative of that marriage
[41:40] covenant
[41:40] the potential the man had the potential
[41:42] the woman had to bring forth the word of
[41:44] god in its fullness to bring forth that
[41:46] son jesus christ
[41:47] he's now saying that now in the last
[41:49] time the bride
[41:50] will bring forth that word because it
[41:53] was promised to be done
[41:54] in the woman it was promised to be done
[41:55] in the church both of them having failed
[41:58] and meeting their potential
[41:59] the bride will realize it in the end
[42:05] and now a statement brother brennan
[42:07] makes in christ is the mystery of god
[42:08] revealed
[42:10] and again if you if you'd like to recall
[42:12] this one side where it's the headaches
[42:14] of this life the responsibilities
[42:16] domestic responsibilities our work
[42:17] responsibilities all the things that
[42:19] we're having to do and then over here
[42:20] the seals are being open
[42:22] christ is revealing himself the son of
[42:23] man is here feeding on failing body word
[42:25] of the son of man
[42:26] washing clothes feet we see in christ
[42:29] united with his bride
[42:31] the mighty angel one foot on the land
[42:33] one foot on the sea
[42:34] going to work every morning and and we
[42:36] start seeing this and that
[42:38] and this and that but what i want you to
[42:40] see is that they're just going to come
[42:41] to the place where they harmonize
[42:43] and they begin to work together and
[42:44] they're not two separate things
[42:47] they're things that god established for
[42:49] a purpose
[42:50] you think you're just working here and
[42:52] one day you won't have to work he says
[42:53] we're going he talks about the land
[42:54] beyond he says we're going to work
[42:55] actually says we're going to work so if
[42:57] you don't like work now well
[42:59] you may not enjoy the the land beyond
[43:02] the river so to speak so we're going to
[43:03] work we're going to have fun there's
[43:04] things we're going to enjoy
[43:05] right brother makes this statement of
[43:08] christ is the mystery of god revealed he
[43:10] says the anointed man this was a much
[43:11] larger statement that appeared down
[43:13] just to this point says then the ointed
[43:15] man which is christ the last adam the
[43:17] second adam he has the capital m there
[43:19] just like it would have been
[43:20] in genesis 2. now the anointed people i
[43:22] would say this this is aaron mcgeary the
[43:24] anointed woman
[43:26] the bride oh my to bring back the
[43:28] anointed bride and the anointed
[43:30] bridegroom so christ is that man he's
[43:33] got to come back the bride has to come
[43:35] on the scene
[43:35] he says anointed by accepting what eve
[43:39] turned down and adam so whatever she
[43:42] turned down
[43:43] we have the opportunity to receive and
[43:46] in receiving what she turned down
[43:48] we can fulfill all the plan of god we
[43:51] can fulfill all that was promised to be
[43:52] made manifest in the virgin anointed by
[43:54] why accepting what eve turned down at
[43:56] and adam he says and adam and the way
[43:59] that this is phrased i think you could
[44:00] even put it
[44:01] a little bit differently accepting what
[44:02] eve turned down and adam coming back
[44:04] with the anointing of the word because
[44:06] he said
[44:07] my word is spirit christ the second adam
[44:10] coming back the anointed word
[44:11] see anointed with the word what eve
[44:14] turned down
[44:15] he comes back and we accept amen
[44:18] oh man i love the third pool i love the
[44:22] opening of those seven seals all seven
[44:23] of them are opened
[44:25] and i love how he's making this plane to
[44:27] where it means something to us
[44:28] as a member of the bride by and through
[44:30] the members of the bride will be
[44:31] fulfilled all that was made promised to
[44:33] god that god promised to be made
[44:34] manifest in the virgin
[44:35] now he's saying that we as bride right
[44:37] now have the opportunity
[44:39] to receive what eve turned down our
[44:42] bridegroom comes back
[44:43] and we accept and then we are able to be
[44:46] the anointed bride the anointed word
[44:49] which she turned down to be
[44:52] and we have that privilege we have that
[44:53] opportunity to be that
[44:56] now again that sounds like really fun
[44:58] you know saturday night convention type
[45:00] stuff
[45:02] everybody like man you would just love
[45:03] to be able to preach that in south
[45:05] africa and tell everybody to please be
[45:06] seated
[45:07] and they come and they start beating on
[45:08] the pulpit and i've been preaching
[45:10] places where they just come and grab you
[45:11] while you're preaching you're going
[45:14] like will this end and it's but it's not
[45:17] just to get excited
[45:18] though these things do excite us but
[45:20] listen there's more to it than just how
[45:21] it kind of
[45:22] itches it tickles our ears in john
[45:25] chapter 6 as we've already given some
[45:27] context to
[45:28] this this is what we could say
[45:32] is christ not just going back to the
[45:35] first pool second pull of his ministry
[45:37] the loaves the fishes the signs and
[45:38] wonders but
[45:39] pointing them to the fact that there's a
[45:41] word that i'm bringing you that you must
[45:42] accept there's promises being fulfilled
[45:44] don't just get hung up on the things
[45:46] that i do that make the flesh feel good
[45:48] or remedy things in the flesh
[45:49] but there's a word that must rightly
[45:51] divide the soul that you've got to
[45:52] receive into your soul
[45:54] and that in receiving that you become
[45:56] there's some change that takes place on
[45:58] the inside
[45:59] and he's saying he that believeth on me
[46:01] hath everlasting life
[46:03] i am that bread of life remember how
[46:06] eating in the beginning caused the fall
[46:08] then he says that man shall not live by
[46:10] word of bread alone but by every word of
[46:12] god and i said i
[46:13] am that bread of life your fathers did
[46:15] eat man in the wilderness and are dead
[46:17] this is the bread which cometh down from
[46:18] heaven that man may eat thereof and
[46:21] not die now there's a parallel
[46:24] what adam and the woman ate in the
[46:26] beginning caused death
[46:27] now christ is speaking of something that
[46:29] if you eat you don't die
[46:31] it's akin to that very tree of life that
[46:33] jesus god said look let's guard the way
[46:35] to the tree of life left man eat of that
[46:37] and live forever now jesus is saying
[46:39] i am i represent something i am the
[46:41] bread of life
[46:42] if you eat this bread you you will not
[46:44] die i am the living bread which came
[46:46] down from heaven
[46:47] if any man eat of this bread he shall
[46:49] live forever and the bread that i give
[46:51] is my flesh which i give for the life of
[46:53] the world
[46:55] jews therefore strove among themselves
[46:57] and how can this man give us his flesh
[46:58] to eat
[46:59] then jesus said unto them john 6 53
[47:01] verily verily i say unto you
[47:03] except you eat the flesh of the son of
[47:05] man and drink his blood
[47:06] you have no life in you so it's living
[47:10] it's life it's vitality it's purpose
[47:12] brother man talks about how that if you
[47:13] had the life of
[47:14] an artist in you you would do the art of
[47:16] that artist so life isn't just
[47:18] well i'm living i'm breathing but it's
[47:21] something that has character has
[47:22] integrity it has an expression
[47:24] it has a dna that needs to be unfolded
[47:26] so there's something more to it than
[47:28] just being say well i'm never gonna die
[47:29] but
[47:29] how are you gonna live listen i do not
[47:32] believe this promise that we're never
[47:33] gonna die
[47:34] is all that we're thinking about that
[47:36] we're never gonna die but the fact that
[47:37] we're never
[47:38] going to die ought to change the way
[47:39] that we're living if i'm never going to
[47:41] die well hey then i can live a little
[47:42] bit differently
[47:43] than everybody else has lived in ages
[47:45] past and that doesn't mean i try to get
[47:46] away with doing dirt but it means i'm
[47:48] under a promise and a power now that's
[47:50] going to give me provision over anything
[47:52] that would have taken death before
[47:55] anything that would have taken life or
[47:56] anything would cause you to despair of
[47:57] life
[47:58] anything that would defile emotions or
[48:00] disrupt the harmony of the physical body
[48:01] if that's the promise i'm living under
[48:04] it's not just so that i can wag my
[48:06] finger in the face of death but that i
[48:07] can lift up life
[48:08] now so that life could be lifted up
[48:12] right now
[48:14] so he says this uh whosoever eateth my
[48:17] flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal
[48:19] life
[48:20] and i will raise him up at the last day
[48:22] so you have life in you there's
[48:24] consequence i'm going to raise them up
[48:25] at the last day
[48:26] for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood
[48:28] is drink indeed he that eateth my flesh
[48:30] and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and
[48:32] i in him
[48:33] as the living father hath sent me i live
[48:34] by the father
[48:36] i mean this is just catch the language
[48:38] he lives by the father
[48:40] just like we live by from meal to meal
[48:42] we live by the natural elements he said
[48:43] this is something
[48:44] that characterizes life so he that
[48:47] eateth me
[48:48] even he shall live by me life living
[48:50] character conduct
[48:51] thoughts actions deeds this is that
[48:54] bread which came down from heaven
[48:56] what did the jews think is he literally
[48:58] talking about us eating his body and
[48:59] drinking his blood
[49:00] what is christ talking about there being
[49:02] a substance that when you eat it you
[49:04] live by it
[49:05] what do you mean live by it everything
[49:09] everything you do
[49:12] not as your fathers did eat manna and
[49:14] are dead he that eateth of this bread
[49:16] shall live forever
[49:19] so christ is that tree of life this is a
[49:22] contrast to genesis 2 17. if you eat of
[49:24] the tree of knowledge of good and evil
[49:25] the day you eat that
[49:26] of that tree you shall die but now
[49:28] christ is saying here i am the bread of
[49:31] life the bread from heaven
[49:32] that if you eat of this you'll never die
[49:35] now there's a parallel i know this has
[49:36] been ministered before
[49:38] and to great lengths through the decades
[49:39] of this message unfolding
[49:41] and the men of god lifting it up and
[49:43] preaching these great things and these
[49:44] great truths
[49:45] and establishing us in them we see a
[49:47] parallel of how christ's
[49:48] ministry followed signs and wonders and
[49:51] gaining crowds and certain attractions
[49:52] and they gather
[49:53] they see what he did in the
[49:55] multiplication of the loaves and fishes
[49:56] he crosses the sea and they all show up
[49:58] and he says you've come because your
[49:59] bellies are hungry
[50:01] you come because you want to see more of
[50:02] the fleshly things you want to see the
[50:04] healings you want to see the signs you
[50:05] want to see the wonders but what did he
[50:07] do
[50:07] he didn't put on a show for him he
[50:09] opened the word
[50:10] he began to speak the word the truth of
[50:12] the word the revelation of the son of
[50:14] man
[50:14] the deeper things and it's those things
[50:16] that offended them and caused them to
[50:17] walk away
[50:18] so what christ is talking about here
[50:20] that a man will eat of bread and live
[50:23] eat of bread bread and have life eat of
[50:25] him and actually have a particular way
[50:27] of living
[50:28] that's the third pull and so the type
[50:31] that we see in genesis
[50:32] excuse me in john chapter six in this
[50:34] hour the eating of the unfailing body
[50:36] word of the son of man
[50:38] is to have an effect in us not that we
[50:40] can gather in coffee shops and in
[50:42] churches
[50:43] and around around tables and sit around
[50:45] and talk a language that other people
[50:47] don't understand
[50:48] but that we can live a life without ever
[50:50] opening our mouths that causes other
[50:52] people to get thirsty
[50:55] to actually live a life so does that
[50:57] mean i can't make mistakes does it mean
[50:59] i have to live above reproach
[51:00] well that's our objective i don't think
[51:03] we
[51:04] want to tell everybody you know go ahead
[51:06] and leave tonight and and just try to
[51:07] get your mistakes out of the way first
[51:09] in the morning so you could
[51:10] try to live a little bit clean in the
[51:11] afternoon we'd say oh god just help me
[51:14] help me lord to walk in your will help
[51:15] me to live a life that's above reproach
[51:17] do we make mistakes yes do we fall short
[51:19] of this of this yes but we're believing
[51:21] in a god and a power to raise us up
[51:24] above it
[51:26] and so this third pool as it's expressed
[51:28] in john chapter six
[51:31] when he's talking about eating bread
[51:33] he's talking about living a life
[51:36] it's not just something that you eat in
[51:37] secret and
[51:39] and nobody has a clue that you're eating
[51:45] but it's something that means something
[51:46] to us maybe i could put it this way
[51:50] the we are
[51:53] god knows we're natural beings and so i
[51:56] have as natural beings the scripture
[51:58] says
[51:58] your heavenly father knows you have need
[52:00] of those things
[52:02] he knows that you're concerned about
[52:03] where your next meal is coming from he
[52:05] knows that you're concerned about
[52:06] whether or not
[52:07] you're going to be able to uh to make a
[52:09] mortgage payment he knows that you're
[52:10] concerned about what you're going to eat
[52:12] what you're going to wear where you're
[52:13] going to lay your head he knows that
[52:14] you're concerned about providing those
[52:16] things for your children so he says
[52:17] i know you have neither of those things
[52:19] but seek me first
[52:20] and all these things will be added unto
[52:22] you and he he makes promises to us
[52:24] things that we can count on and things
[52:25] that we can bank on
[52:27] and these things that that means so much
[52:29] to us in natural life
[52:31] god is so mindful of that he harmonizes
[52:34] them
[52:34] with things that mean so much to us
[52:36] spiritually
[52:37] things that we would hold very dear and
[52:39] very precious to us about god fulfilling
[52:41] malachi 4 5 in this end time
[52:43] and luke 17 30 being fulfilled in this
[52:46] end time in first thessalonians 4 16
[52:48] being fulfilled in revelations 10 1-7
[52:50] being fulfilled
[52:50] and all these great precious promises
[52:52] that we could say this day this
[52:53] scripture is fulfilled
[52:55] it's those things that if we are seeking
[52:57] them if they're coming to us as a
[52:58] revelation
[52:59] if we're feeding on those things they
[53:01] translate to
[53:02] god being present in your natural life
[53:05] and making a difference and all these
[53:07] other consternations and worries and
[53:09] fears
[53:09] and all these other relationships we
[53:11] have and that's when it's really going
[53:12] to matter the most
[53:15] that's when it's really going to be the
[53:17] full word born into manifestation
[53:23] now in the message possessing all things
[53:28] is a very lengthy statement that i
[53:29] believe i have broke up into just two
[53:31] sections here
[53:33] oh but i just love this so much how
[53:35] prophet makes this connection
[53:39] don't miss the prophetic connection that
[53:41] brother brennan makes between the third
[53:43] pool
[53:44] and the everyday lives we live and the
[53:47] rapture
[53:48] this is what i want you to see is
[53:50] brother brown's going to reference the
[53:51] third pool
[53:52] then he's going to connect it to the
[53:53] lives that we live and it's connected
[53:55] well i will raise him up in the last day
[53:58] this is not just brother brand i'm
[53:59] accidentally stumbling on a scripture
[54:01] but it's god actually using a prophet to
[54:04] reference a scripture
[54:05] that we can put our promise on here in
[54:07] the last days when there's going to be a
[54:08] bride what
[54:09] raise up when you hear a word and you're
[54:12] raptured up quickly to meet it with
[54:14] these things that take place
[54:15] where she is now risen he says you're
[54:17] feeding on unfailing body word if you
[54:19] haven't done it
[54:20] to give you strength to fly above the
[54:22] denominations and all these things
[54:23] so eating on the unfailing body word of
[54:26] the son of man gives us strength to rise
[54:27] up
[54:29] and he says this he says in saint john
[54:30] the sixth chapter
[54:32] jesus said whosoever eats my flesh and
[54:34] drinks my blood
[54:35] has everlasting life and i will raise
[54:37] him up at the last day
[54:39] that promise isn't that a glorious thing
[54:43] i will raise him up
[54:48] can are you with me to this to this
[54:50] juncture this is john chapter six this
[54:52] is him reading from these very
[54:53] scriptures
[54:54] i i he that eats my flesh and drinks my
[54:56] blood has a life
[54:58] and there's a promise in the end where
[54:59] they're gonna be raised up he says
[55:01] did you ever think what you are here for
[55:04] now this is this is where it gets real
[55:07] now to your children what are you going
[55:09] to school for children
[55:11] and so think about this i'm trying to
[55:12] look at my children jack why do you go
[55:14] to kindergarten
[55:15] have you ever thought about it elliott
[55:16] what do you go to school for eliza
[55:18] preston wherever you are what are you
[55:19] going to rowan what do you go to school
[55:20] for
[55:21] he's over there giggling at my kids and
[55:24] he's like ooh
[55:25] what do you go to school for now we're
[55:28] thinking about this
[55:29] what are you working for dad somebody
[55:32] got the children in it we got the dad in
[55:34] it
[55:34] what makes you get up mother of a
[55:36] morning and get the kitties to school
[55:38] wash their face
[55:39] make up the beds and cook and do it all
[55:41] now this is a very interesting
[55:43] line of questioning to go down he just
[55:45] read from the third pool john chapter
[55:47] six
[55:47] he that eats the body word of the son of
[55:49] man i'll give him power to raise up at
[55:51] the end time and we're like
[55:52] whoa glory to god hallelujah third paul
[55:55] bring it to me come on baby
[55:56] speak that token language and now he
[55:59] starts asking us why we go to school
[56:01] starts asking us why we work he starts
[56:03] asking us why we
[56:04] why we why moms get up in the morning
[56:06] and wash their kitty's face
[56:08] now he hasn't all of a sudden lost his
[56:09] notes oh my goodness what have i done
[56:11] i'm working on another sermon all
[56:12] i'm in question and answers now what do
[56:14] i do these things
[56:16] makes these things connect these things
[56:19] are so relevant together
[56:20] he says come in all wore out and the
[56:22] next day start the same thing
[56:24] that's what that's what we do the man
[56:25] goes to work the mom works all day at
[56:27] home the man works
[56:28] all day making a living the kids go to
[56:30] school all day and do their homework and
[56:31] then what do we do the next day we do
[56:32] the same thing again
[56:34] he says what do you do it for back to
[56:37] the dads why do you labor and slave dad
[56:39] and everything
[56:41] come in at night and weary one of the
[56:42] kids get sick you walk the floor cry
[56:44] pray struggle
[56:45] they get well then back and you do it
[56:46] again every sunday wash their faces get
[56:49] them down to the church
[56:51] this is the routine right this is where
[56:53] we have this in our minds i'll just say
[56:55] this for myself i'm like if i can just
[56:56] get through sunday
[56:57] and then i'm like once i get through
[56:58] sunday then i'm gonna be all caught up
[57:00] and i'm gonna be in a groove and we'll
[57:01] start we'll do this and we'll do that
[57:03] and
[57:03] everything's gonna be great and then
[57:04] monday it's like you're behind again you
[57:06] start all over
[57:07] and it's monday night if i could just
[57:09] get through sunday
[57:10] right and then monday comes and what do
[57:12] you say again if i could just get
[57:13] through sunday
[57:14] just seems like there's always something
[57:16] you're chasing
[57:18] he says and well what's it all about
[57:23] what what are we here for is that all
[57:27] there is to it
[57:31] is in doing that he's not he's not
[57:34] getting us to question why
[57:35] whether we should do it but he's saying
[57:37] do you even realize why you do it
[57:41] did you ever think what we're here for
[57:43] why are you going to school
[57:44] why are you working why are you taking
[57:46] care of your kids why are you
[57:48] praying for them when they're sick why
[57:49] are you bringing them to church what's
[57:50] it about what are we all here for
[57:53] it continues he said my that'd be
[57:55] miserable knowing you've got to go
[57:56] anyhow
[57:56] what's it all about oh brother it's
[57:59] examination time
[58:01] it's an opportunity time it's the
[58:03] opportunity to accept
[58:05] this tell me something to take its place
[58:07] tell me something better than that
[58:09] produce anything in the world be the
[58:11] king of the earth rule the universe be a
[58:12] crucifer or a kennedy or whatever you
[58:14] wish to be
[58:15] you'll just die just the same oh
[58:18] hallelujah do you realize he's just said
[58:20] that whatever you're doing as a
[58:21] housewife
[58:22] there's nothing to take that place
[58:24] whether you be a khrushchev or a kennedy
[58:26] or a king of the earth
[58:27] what you're doing the role you have the
[58:29] opportunity you have
[58:31] is greater than all those things
[58:36] right you don't know what time will come
[58:38] by any minute but here when death does
[58:39] strike
[58:40] you've got eternal life and can't die
[58:42] with the guaranteed by god of all
[58:44] creation
[58:44] who's the possessor of heaven and earth
[58:46] i will raise him up again at the last
[58:48] days and notice this tremendous prayer
[58:50] help thou my unbelief oh god fill my
[58:53] soul o god
[58:54] cleanse me fill me charge me send me out
[58:57] let me not die
[58:58] let me live to tell the story
[59:02] this is what it means i'll raise him up
[59:03] in the last days this is why brother
[59:05] brennan makes this connection and i
[59:06] would love to go
[59:07] much deeper into this great connection
[59:09] but brother branham is setting before us
[59:11] this image
[59:12] that the son of man has revealed himself
[59:14] again today to his bride
[59:16] that you have the privilege and
[59:17] opportunity to feed on that and jesus is
[59:20] saying
[59:20] i if you eat this flesh and drink this
[59:23] blood i'm gonna raise you
[59:24] up in the last days what has he raised
[59:27] you up to do wash your kids face in the
[59:29] morning
[59:29] go out all day and work come back home
[59:31] sit around the table
[59:32] do a devotion and start it all over
[59:34] again why what gives reason to that
[59:36] what gives purpose to that the very
[59:38] thing that god's called me to
[59:40] the very thing that's given me a life
[59:41] and unction to do it
[59:44] oh help thou my unbelief oh god fill my
[59:47] soul oh god cleanse me fill me charge me
[59:49] send me out let me not die let me live
[59:51] to tell the story let me go to every
[59:53] cracking corner of the earth and preach
[59:54] the word and sow the seed yes sir
[59:56] that there may be a harvest in the last
[59:58] days of the true unadulterated word with
[1:00:01] believers in
[1:00:02] christ he's taken the word
[1:00:07] which we believe this opening of the
[1:00:10] word
[1:00:11] we're in this hour we're feeding on the
[1:00:13] unfailing body word of the son of man
[1:00:14] and he's asked us what are you doing all
[1:00:16] this else for
[1:00:18] and it's all fulfilling that
[1:00:22] what can take the place of that tell me
[1:00:25] something to take its place
[1:00:27] tell me something better than that what
[1:00:28] do you mean if you disagree with the
[1:00:30] emphasis i'm
[1:00:30] putting on let me just say this way what
[1:00:32] can what would be better than to take
[1:00:34] the place of the role that you have
[1:00:35] within your family whether it be a
[1:00:36] husband or wife
[1:00:38] what would be greater than to be a
[1:00:39] father of a mother what would be greater
[1:00:41] than to just take your place in the body
[1:00:42] of christ to take your place within the
[1:00:44] family of god to do your part within the
[1:00:46] church
[1:00:47] so what would be greater to be a kennedy
[1:00:48] or a khrushev
[1:00:51] to be a biden or a putin what would it
[1:00:54] be
[1:00:59] this is the statement that i i wanted to
[1:01:01] read it earlier but i've saved it to
[1:01:02] this point or moved it to the end here
[1:01:04] god equipped his children with the right
[1:01:06] kind of ammunition the right kind of
[1:01:08] attack the right kind of everything that
[1:01:09] they had need of
[1:01:10] that would sweep them all the way from
[1:01:12] eden to the rapture
[1:01:14] and here we are the the word that god
[1:01:18] gave them in the beginning
[1:01:19] they were to live by adam wasn't to do
[1:01:22] anything more than just
[1:01:23] live by it and if he lived by that word
[1:01:26] they would never die
[1:01:27] and it's that same word that we live by
[1:01:30] and what's it going to do bring a
[1:01:31] rapture
[1:01:32] so then what are the mechanics that we
[1:01:34] worry that we're worried about live the
[1:01:38] life
[1:01:39] just live it you say well how about
[1:01:42] there how can i do it well
[1:01:44] what do you what are you going to school
[1:01:45] for children what are you going to work
[1:01:47] for dad
[1:01:48] why are you doing everything you're
[1:01:49] asked to do mother
[1:01:51] that's it that's the secret that's
[1:01:54] that's what we that's all we can do
[1:01:56] it's not holding our hands a certain way
[1:01:58] when we pray
[1:02:00] it's not saying oh lord please bring
[1:02:01] back the conventions of the 80s and 90s
[1:02:03] where we all got together and there was
[1:02:04] thousands of us and
[1:02:06] and these preachers preached and the
[1:02:07] revelations came and that feeling we got
[1:02:09] the presence we got listen
[1:02:10] we're living off the benefit of that now
[1:02:13] and we're going we're going further than
[1:02:15] the word of god and what we know we can
[1:02:17] do the lit the the one thing we can do
[1:02:19] it's the only
[1:02:20] thing we can do in many ways but it's
[1:02:21] the best thing we can do in this do what
[1:02:23] you're supposed to do
[1:02:26] because the eden covenant that adam
[1:02:28] failed we are now under an unconditional
[1:02:30] covenant and what do we do we just live
[1:02:32] the life
[1:02:34] we live it the way that he asked us to
[1:02:35] live it brother branham when he's
[1:02:37] referring to the unconditional covenant
[1:02:40] it's unconditional not i will i have
[1:02:42] i've already done it he says and that's
[1:02:44] the law that christians must
[1:02:46] live by it's already done
[1:02:50] i mean this is there's it's kind of a
[1:02:51] it's an odd thing that you've been asked
[1:02:53] to come to
[1:02:54] he's inviting you into this relationship
[1:02:56] and then by union really the revelation
[1:02:58] is it's already done
[1:03:01] he's taking care of it
[1:03:05] now who do you say this is brother ben
[1:03:07] says god may
[1:03:08] manage this tremendous prayer god made
[1:03:10] men and women
[1:03:12] no longer hold on to traditions and
[1:03:13] creeds but may they come out of that
[1:03:16] thing give their lives completely to god
[1:03:19] and believe not just try upon
[1:03:22] theory and things of man but trust in
[1:03:24] the living god
[1:03:26] while these holidays are going on the
[1:03:27] cry still is who is this what is this
[1:03:30] what's it all about see the question
[1:03:33] that's echoed brother branham
[1:03:35] echoes it in possessing all things
[1:03:36] what's it all about what are we here for
[1:03:38] is this all there is what's it all about
[1:03:40] he's asking this question from the
[1:03:42] standpoint of a prophet
[1:03:43] looking into the prophecies of the word
[1:03:44] of god that relate to the last day
[1:03:46] these challenges what is it all about
[1:03:48] what is it all about and now he's saying
[1:03:50] that laodicea and the nominal world they
[1:03:52] have this question
[1:03:52] who is this what is it what's it all
[1:03:54] about religious people say the same
[1:03:56] thing
[1:03:56] and it's the same lord jesus made flesh
[1:03:59] in his people
[1:04:00] anointing his word for the bride did he
[1:04:03] not say that this is what eve turned
[1:04:05] down
[1:04:05] he comes back and we accept this is the
[1:04:07] anointed word
[1:04:08] he says and they can't understand it
[1:04:11] they're all so
[1:04:12] tore away and laodicea until they don't
[1:04:14] know what it's all about
[1:04:15] can i just admonish you as believers
[1:04:17] don't be all so
[1:04:18] tore away unto laodicea that you don't
[1:04:20] recognize your day and its message
[1:04:22] that you are now living in a bright age
[1:04:25] also torpin all the demands upon
[1:04:26] laodicea that you don't realize you're
[1:04:28] in the time
[1:04:29] that the lord jesus has made flesh in
[1:04:31] you
[1:04:34] we give our lives completely to god and
[1:04:37] believe
[1:04:39] genesis chapter 18. i i i must i must
[1:04:43] finish this
[1:04:43] let's go through this very quickly
[1:04:45] genesis chapter 18 verses 1 to 8.
[1:04:49] because he said he brings this contrast
[1:04:51] of laodicea
[1:04:54] and the same lord jesus made flesh in
[1:04:56] his people
[1:04:57] it's the son of man being revealed again
[1:05:00] in human beings in the bride in your
[1:05:03] flesh
[1:05:05] but people are so tore away in laodicea
[1:05:08] that they don't know what it's all about
[1:05:11] now maybe there's a way that we can put
[1:05:13] ourselves in that even though we are the
[1:05:15] ones
[1:05:16] who the lord jesus is making himself
[1:05:18] flesh in this flesh is becoming word
[1:05:20] and we really we know this we repeat it
[1:05:22] we accept it we hear it preached way
[1:05:24] amen
[1:05:24] we feel some connection with it it's
[1:05:26] kept us very in very dark times
[1:05:28] when people we love have turned their
[1:05:29] back on it there's something there he
[1:05:31] said well i'm tied to this is more than
[1:05:32] life to me
[1:05:33] i may not be able to explain it and
[1:05:35] things may not be the best
[1:05:36] for me right now and things may not be
[1:05:38] going very well and you may be able to
[1:05:39] point out a lot of things in my life and
[1:05:40] a lot of circumstances and i may not
[1:05:42] look like much of a believer
[1:05:43] but there's something i'm tied to that's
[1:05:45] more than everything i see and more than
[1:05:47] everything i feel
[1:05:48] and you know this word is true but then
[1:05:50] we could ask ourselves what's it all
[1:05:51] about
[1:05:54] so tore away on laodicea so there's some
[1:05:56] there's a deeper connection that we need
[1:05:58] to make with this revelation
[1:06:00] this word that we have been given to
[1:06:02] sweep us into a rapture
[1:06:04] and in genesis 18 brother battle uses
[1:06:06] this scripture so often
[1:06:08] to speak about the sign of the son of
[1:06:09] man revealed the sign that the son of
[1:06:11] man is being revealed
[1:06:13] and it says the lord appeared unto
[1:06:15] abraham it's unto him in the plains of
[1:06:16] memory
[1:06:17] and out it speaking of abraham he sat in
[1:06:19] the tent door in the heat of the day
[1:06:21] and he lifted up his eyes and looked and
[1:06:23] lo three men stood by him
[1:06:25] and when he saw them he ran to meet them
[1:06:27] from the tent door
[1:06:28] and bowed himself toward the ground so
[1:06:31] if we could just use it as some sort of
[1:06:32] image or
[1:06:33] type abraham's there he's near his tent
[1:06:35] he's in his domain he's in his property
[1:06:37] he's doing the things that he would do
[1:06:38] there at the heat of the day there's
[1:06:40] maybe certain things
[1:06:41] at that time of the day he may have been
[1:06:42] taking a break trying to be in the shade
[1:06:44] taking a break from the labors that he
[1:06:46] had as one who had a vast kingdom
[1:06:48] and as he's sitting there resting from
[1:06:50] his natural duty he sees these men
[1:06:51] approaching
[1:06:52] and he runs to them just a normal day
[1:06:56] there's nothing about this day that
[1:06:58] suggests that abraham
[1:07:00] was told that this is going to be the
[1:07:01] biggest day of your life he's just there
[1:07:03] he's at the tent door he looks up and he
[1:07:04] sees and he said my lord
[1:07:06] if now i have found favor in thy sight
[1:07:08] and we see that how there's three but he
[1:07:10] recognized the lord
[1:07:11] pass not away i pray thee from thy
[1:07:13] servant let a little water i pray you be
[1:07:15] fetched
[1:07:16] and wash your feet and rest yourselves
[1:07:18] under the tree
[1:07:20] now recognize some of the things that
[1:07:22] are taking place
[1:07:23] here comes the lord who stepped into a
[1:07:26] body
[1:07:26] and here's this one veiled in flesh and
[1:07:29] he comes to abraham
[1:07:30] at his house he showed up at his house
[1:07:32] and now abraham immediately
[1:07:34] is able to do things hey let me go fetch
[1:07:38] you some water why because that's
[1:07:39] something he customarily did
[1:07:41] let me wash your feet rest yourselves
[1:07:43] under a tree he had all these things
[1:07:44] and i will fetch you a morsel of bread
[1:07:49] and comfort your hearts after that you
[1:07:51] shall pass on
[1:07:52] for therefore you are come to your
[1:07:53] servant and they said so do as thou has
[1:07:56] said
[1:07:56] abraham says why don't you stop let me
[1:07:59] feed you
[1:08:00] let me wash you why don't you rest a
[1:08:01] little while and then you can continue
[1:08:03] your journey
[1:08:04] and abraham with all the things he
[1:08:05] expressed that he wanted to do they say
[1:08:07] we'll do it
[1:08:08] we'll stay and then
[1:08:11] verse 6 i love this and abraham hastened
[1:08:13] into the tent unto seven now sarah was
[1:08:16] in the tent
[1:08:16] i said make ready quickly three measures
[1:08:19] of fine meal knead it and make cakes
[1:08:20] upon the earth
[1:08:22] now he wouldn't have asked her something
[1:08:23] to do that was out of that she wouldn't
[1:08:25] have normally done or knew what to do
[1:08:27] he didn't go into her say honey you need
[1:08:29] to make a cake eight feet tall
[1:08:31] it needs to be gluten free and make sure
[1:08:33] you have pomegranates
[1:08:35] i always just say hey this is something
[1:08:36] she would do every day she'd make bread
[1:08:38] she would need it and so now she's being
[1:08:40] asked to do something that she would
[1:08:41] have normally done but we know this day
[1:08:43] is a little bit different than any other
[1:08:44] day because now the lord's there
[1:08:46] now god is veiling himself in the flesh
[1:08:49] to bring a promise to him and so he said
[1:08:51] honey go make these
[1:08:52] cakes and bake this meal and abraham ran
[1:08:54] into the herd and festive calf tinder
[1:08:55] and good and gave it to the young man
[1:08:57] and he hasted to dress it and he took
[1:08:59] butter and milk and a calf which he had
[1:09:00] dressed
[1:09:01] and he set it before them and he stood
[1:09:03] by them under the tree and they did eat
[1:09:06] is this a beautiful picture i mean are
[1:09:07] you can you get excited about this
[1:09:10] that abraham has god visit him
[1:09:14] god veiled in flesh comes to his tent
[1:09:16] door and everything
[1:09:17] abraham does is what he would have done
[1:09:19] any other day
[1:09:22] where they sat is where they would have
[1:09:23] always sat what they eat is what they
[1:09:25] ate what she made is what she would have
[1:09:27] made any other day maybe what they would
[1:09:28] have done to any stranger that came
[1:09:30] their way
[1:09:31] they're now doing it but they're doing
[1:09:32] it in the presence of the one that made
[1:09:34] the promise
[1:09:34] in the presence of the one that says i
[1:09:36] will return unto you about this time
[1:09:38] next year according to the promise of
[1:09:39] life
[1:09:40] and sarah shall have a son here's
[1:09:42] abraham just doing what he would have
[1:09:43] done any other day christ comes and
[1:09:45] visits him
[1:09:45] and he just keeps doing what he'd done
[1:09:47] every other day but now it's to christ
[1:09:50] now it's to him who is present with him
[1:09:51] abraham was living a life when he came
[1:09:54] and he continued to live the life in his
[1:09:56] presence and what does this tell us
[1:09:58] that when christ himself has descended
[1:10:01] we don't need to get so spiritual that
[1:10:02] we're of no earthly good
[1:10:04] we realize now in the presence of christ
[1:10:06] i will love my wife
[1:10:07] now in the presence of christ i will
[1:10:09] reverence my husband now in the presence
[1:10:11] of christ
[1:10:12] i will do what a man ought to do what a
[1:10:14] woman ought to do
[1:10:15] what a child up to do with more
[1:10:18] authority and boldness and more
[1:10:19] confidence than ever
[1:10:20] because he that both will and desires is
[1:10:23] in me to do it and i can
[1:10:24] release my cares to him and he can
[1:10:26] accomplish it amen
[1:10:28] what a beautiful story my we could tell
[1:10:30] the story of god veiled and flesh the
[1:10:32] mighty angel coming down the earth
[1:10:34] taking the book and eat it and all these
[1:10:35] different things that we can express
[1:10:37] but we see it perfectly lived out in
[1:10:39] genesis 18.
[1:10:40] amen what does it look like what does it
[1:10:43] look like when god veils his flesh and
[1:10:44] his bride
[1:10:45] what does it look like well abraham
[1:10:49] fetched bread poured milk
[1:10:52] sarah made the bread the lamb he went
[1:10:55] and grabbed it he'd been raising it was
[1:10:56] there he begins to use all these things
[1:10:58] that's what it looks like what do you do
[1:11:01] it for dad
[1:11:02] what do you do it for mother you do it
[1:11:05] for him
[1:11:07] what do you do it for because he's here
[1:11:09] what do you do it for because he said
[1:11:10] he'd raised me up in the last day
[1:11:12] well when is he going to have oh no no
[1:11:14] he raised me up in this last day to be a
[1:11:16] dad
[1:11:16] he raised me up this last day to be a
[1:11:18] son he raised me up to be a man of god
[1:11:20] he made raised me up to be a man of
[1:11:21] integrity he raised me up to be a cycle
[1:11:23] breaker he raised me up to be a bearer
[1:11:25] of his word he raised
[1:11:26] me up to be a life lived by the word
[1:11:27] that's what he raised me up for well
[1:11:28] you're not doing a very good job well
[1:11:30] then i'm going to yield more
[1:11:31] i'm going to repent where i make my
[1:11:33] mistakes i'm going to say i'm sorry i'm
[1:11:34] going to keep trying i'm going to keep
[1:11:35] trying
[1:11:36] because he's made a promise that he will
[1:11:38] he will he will he will
[1:11:40] this covenant will not fail
[1:11:45] but what a different picture in genesis
[1:11:46] chapter 19
[1:11:49] in genesis 19 verses 1 and 2.
[1:11:54] and there came two angels to sodom and
[1:11:55] even
[1:11:57] because there's one that stayed back and
[1:11:59] what's abraham going to do when he stays
[1:12:01] back
[1:12:02] he could keep doing what he always did
[1:12:04] right if that if that angel wanted to
[1:12:06] stay with him you know what he would
[1:12:07] have said
[1:12:08] hey i've got to go check on the herdsmen
[1:12:12] about this time every day i go down
[1:12:13] there and check on them
[1:12:15] and we make decisions why don't you go
[1:12:17] with me
[1:12:19] it wasn't like all of a sudden god
[1:12:21] showed up veiled in flesh and he's like
[1:12:22] honey don't bother me you do this and
[1:12:24] guys go away
[1:12:25] i'm just gonna sit here and basket the
[1:12:27] glory of the cloud
[1:12:29] and try to think of all the wonderful
[1:12:31] types i can pull out of it and all the
[1:12:32] beautiful things that god is doing in
[1:12:34] this last days hear the voice of god and
[1:12:36] catch the types and the revelations he
[1:12:37] said why don't you go with me while i go
[1:12:39] do my job
[1:12:41] who is sarah making it for all these
[1:12:43] people interacting all these things
[1:12:44] that's what happened with
[1:12:45] as this one stayed with abraham but
[1:12:47] genesis 19 1-2 and there came two angels
[1:12:49] to sodom and even
[1:12:51] and lot sat in the gate of sodom now
[1:12:54] it's now the even in the at the heat of
[1:12:57] the noon abraham was by his tent
[1:12:59] now in the evening time when lot
[1:13:01] probably should have been at home he's
[1:13:02] at the gate of sodom
[1:13:04] i'm not saying that it has to be that
[1:13:06] way i'm just saying
[1:13:08] there's a difference between lot and
[1:13:09] abraham in lot seeing them rolls up to
[1:13:12] meet them so he does even as abraham
[1:13:13] he runs out to me he bowed himself his
[1:13:15] face toward the ground and he said
[1:13:16] behold now my lords different revelation
[1:13:19] than abraham had
[1:13:20] turn in i pray you into your servant's
[1:13:21] house terry all night wash your feet
[1:13:23] you shall rise up and go on in your ways
[1:13:25] so this sounds just like abraham
[1:13:28] sounds like abraham he said hey why
[1:13:30] don't you guys stay well wash your feet
[1:13:31] we'll feed you clothing and then you can
[1:13:32] continue on your way but notice what
[1:13:33] they say
[1:13:34] nay but we will abide in the street all
[1:13:36] night
[1:13:39] now that's that's striking with abraham
[1:13:42] all three of them said yeah we'll terry
[1:13:44] we'll sit in your home
[1:13:46] we'll eat we'll partake of the things
[1:13:48] that you want to provide
[1:13:49] but with lot he invites them into home
[1:13:52] but they say no we'd rather
[1:13:53] sleep in the streets
[1:13:56] because there's something that's unknown
[1:13:58] to us about lot something that we can
[1:13:59] gather from the rest of the scriptures
[1:14:01] that lot wasn't about doing what he
[1:14:03] should be doing
[1:14:05] abraham immediately knew immediately let
[1:14:07] me wash your feet let me go get you some
[1:14:09] milk let me tell this guy to start
[1:14:10] dressing the calf honey start making
[1:14:12] bread
[1:14:12] and he had all the things he had been in
[1:14:14] practice he was doing the things he was
[1:14:15] supposed to do
[1:14:16] and now he's able to keep continue to do
[1:14:18] it he's able to give service in the
[1:14:20] presence of christ
[1:14:20] lot's just sitting there in the gate of
[1:14:22] sodom i don't know what he's doing
[1:14:25] you know he deleted all those tweets
[1:14:26] before we could archive them
[1:14:28] we don't know what's going on and next
[1:14:31] thing you know he runs he seems like
[1:14:32] he's doing what abraham did but there's
[1:14:34] something missing in lot's life there's
[1:14:36] something missing in his revelation
[1:14:37] that when these angels were invited into
[1:14:39] his home they said no we're better off
[1:14:41] sleeping in the streets
[1:14:43] brother baton catches this in jehovah
[1:14:44] gyra part two in case you're thinking
[1:14:46] man brother aaron it's amazing how you
[1:14:47] pull that out i just read the message
[1:14:50] that's what i do let's just make it very
[1:14:52] clear right now
[1:14:53] somebody told me one time you need to
[1:14:55] tell the people where you're getting it
[1:14:56] i'm like what do you mean they know
[1:14:57] where i'm getting it
[1:14:58] i'm just preaching the message
[1:15:02] he says two of those messages went down
[1:15:04] into sodom and they preached to those
[1:15:06] sodomites and they blinded them at night
[1:15:08] at the word but remember there was one
[1:15:10] he stayed with abraham and his group
[1:15:12] they had their sign of stranger among
[1:15:14] them look at lot
[1:15:15] sitting in the gate and said my lords
[1:15:18] and living in such a way
[1:15:20] they said come into my house he said
[1:15:22] we'll sleep in the street
[1:15:25] he says what a home
[1:15:29] identifying something as it was in the
[1:15:32] days of lot
[1:15:33] so shall it be in the day when the son
[1:15:35] of man is revealed
[1:15:36] the son of man is being revealed you can
[1:15:38] either be a lot or you can be an abraham
[1:15:40] if you don't catch the revelation to the
[1:15:42] purpose of the son of man
[1:15:43] you could use the language of abraham
[1:15:45] but you're living like lord
[1:15:47] you can recite all the quotes of brother
[1:15:48] branham but you're living like lot but
[1:15:50] when you catch the revelation you live
[1:15:52] like abraham you live the life
[1:15:54] and a life lived by the word is the word
[1:15:56] expressed not books and tapes and quotes
[1:15:58] and trying to
[1:15:59] explain what brother man and preach said
[1:16:00] i may not be able to explain it but oh
[1:16:02] god let me
[1:16:03] live it let my life be the
[1:16:06] interpretation let my life be
[1:16:08] the very unfolding of this beautiful
[1:16:10] perfectly complete message
[1:16:14] oh god fill my soul cleanse me feel me
[1:16:17] charge me send me out
[1:16:18] let me not die but let me live to tell
[1:16:21] the story
[1:16:23] he says we'll sleep in the street what a
[1:16:24] home but as soon as abraham they said
[1:16:27] there's a difference with abraham this
[1:16:30] is the purpose we come for
[1:16:32] we sit down here by the side of you
[1:16:36] that's the way live so that if god would
[1:16:40] come want to use you
[1:16:41] he knows right where to come get you
[1:16:45] you're in a position living a life clean
[1:16:47] before god
[1:16:48] your words are honest your life is true
[1:16:52] that's the kind of a place that angels
[1:16:54] come
[1:16:56] the opening of the seven seals doesn't
[1:16:59] change this
[1:17:00] it brings us to this i want to share a
[1:17:04] personal testimony i don't normally
[1:17:06] i try to insert my own but i just felt
[1:17:08] like i was really challenged today
[1:17:09] i bought i bought elizabeth a birthday
[1:17:12] gift yesterday i bought it in the store
[1:17:14] and then um and then i got an email
[1:17:16] later on saying your product will ship
[1:17:17] tomorrow
[1:17:18] i thought well this has got to be a
[1:17:19] mistake and then they sent me an email
[1:17:22] said your
[1:17:22] product's out for delivery and i was
[1:17:25] like oh thank you lord
[1:17:27] right oh this is an excellent
[1:17:29] opportunity here
[1:17:30] and sure enough they delivered the exact
[1:17:32] same product
[1:17:34] paid full price for it yesterday
[1:17:35] something went wrong in the analysis
[1:17:37] and now i had the exact same thing and
[1:17:39] nobody would have been the wiser if i
[1:17:40] kept it
[1:17:42] but something inside of me i wanted to
[1:17:45] do the right thing
[1:17:46] i wanted to sow a good seed
[1:17:49] and so i called up the store and i
[1:17:52] talked to the person who sold it to me
[1:17:53] said i want to talk to you first because
[1:17:54] i don't want to get you in trouble
[1:17:56] i walked out of the store with product
[1:17:57] yesterday and i received it's the same
[1:17:59] thing today
[1:18:00] uh but it was delivered to me and kind
[1:18:03] of the attitude was
[1:18:04] well good for you
[1:18:08] right and i said i want to do what's
[1:18:11] right
[1:18:12] help me do what's right i'm willing to
[1:18:14] return i want to take it back i want to
[1:18:15] return it do whatever is right because
[1:18:16] it's going to be kind of a
[1:18:17] complicated thing to unwind and uh
[1:18:20] and elliott knew knew what was happening
[1:18:22] and he said well
[1:18:23] did they say you could keep it and you
[1:18:24] know what the manager said he said
[1:18:26] he could keep it if he wants but you
[1:18:29] know what i want to do i still wanted to
[1:18:30] return it
[1:18:31] and let me just tell you why because one
[1:18:33] day i may make a mistake
[1:18:35] and somebody may be able to take
[1:18:36] advantage of me and i want to be made
[1:18:39] whole
[1:18:40] i don't want to be defrauded i don't
[1:18:42] want to be taken advantage of i don't
[1:18:43] want to make a mistake and somebody
[1:18:44] capitalize on
[1:18:45] so i looked at it as an opportunity to
[1:18:47] sow good seed
[1:18:49] and and and maybe just a challenge to
[1:18:50] get all distracted today and not be able
[1:18:52] to preach because it's like woohoo i got
[1:18:53] something free
[1:18:55] but this is the kind of to me this is
[1:18:57] just personally this is how i can
[1:18:58] testify it doesn't necessarily mean
[1:18:59] anything for you
[1:19:00] but for me i feel like that's an example
[1:19:02] of how that i can live the right kind of
[1:19:04] life so he knows right where to come get
[1:19:05] you
[1:19:06] you're in a position living a clean life
[1:19:08] before god your words are honest your
[1:19:10] life is true
[1:19:10] that's the kind of place that angels
[1:19:12] come look at elizabeth and zacharias and
[1:19:14] honest
[1:19:15] upright walking in the commandments of
[1:19:16] the lord that's the way we want to live
[1:19:18] so when one
[1:19:19] when god gets ready to use us he says
[1:19:23] this is my people i can do with this
[1:19:25] church what i want to
[1:19:27] they believe me they stand on my word
[1:19:29] see that's the way you want to do
[1:19:31] live the life that's it
[1:19:36] that's what we can do this is my people
[1:19:39] i can do with this church what i want to
[1:19:42] they believe me
[1:19:43] they stand on my word this is what
[1:19:46] brother branham identifies in genesis 18
[1:19:47] and 19.
[1:19:49] lived the life so that when god wanted
[1:19:52] to use them
[1:19:54] he knew right where to come find him and
[1:19:57] that's the way
[1:19:58] liv said if god would want to use you
[1:20:01] he knows right where to come get you and
[1:20:04] i say this
[1:20:05] let's live a life where you say this is
[1:20:06] my people i can do with this church what
[1:20:09] i want to they believe me
[1:20:10] they stand on my word let's stand to our
[1:20:13] feet this evening
[1:20:35] let's bow our heads in a word of prayer
[1:20:43] if you have a need before the lord just
[1:20:45] express it in your own way in your heart
[1:20:47] feel free to lift your hand to him
[1:20:50] our gracious heavenly father
[1:20:54] your word is perfect
[1:20:58] there are things that we can read in the
[1:20:59] word and not understand
[1:21:01] there's things that we see in the word
[1:21:03] that we might from a natural standpoint
[1:21:05] feel that they contradict
[1:21:07] with some other part but lord we know
[1:21:11] it's perfect
[1:21:15] maybe there's a way that we can take
[1:21:16] comfort lord as we look at our lives and
[1:21:18] we feel that there's things that are
[1:21:19] incongruent with your word we feel
[1:21:22] there's things that have happened that
[1:21:25] don't make sense or fit within the
[1:21:28] perfect picture that we thought was
[1:21:29] unfolding
[1:21:33] but lord without the ability to change
[1:21:34] our past
[1:21:37] we just want to live out to the future
[1:21:44] and we want to look into the word now
[1:21:48] see that in the beginning you created a
[1:21:51] family
[1:21:55] and in the end you've raised one up
[1:21:58] and that each one of us no matter what
[1:22:00] our past
[1:22:02] no matter what our circumstance
[1:22:05] we stand here tonight man or woman
[1:22:09] boy or girl with a calling
[1:22:14] with a purpose
[1:22:18] and if on a normal day in the heat of
[1:22:20] the sun
[1:22:21] you came and visited abraham
[1:22:24] [Music]
[1:22:25] and had a message for sarah
[1:22:29] that all we read about in genesis 18 are
[1:22:32] things that we can do
[1:22:35] the lord i want to do what i can do
[1:22:41] i may not be called to do things that
[1:22:43] are public
[1:22:46] as it's often mentioned we may not ever
[1:22:48] go overseas and preach a meeting we may
[1:22:50] never lay our hands upon the sick and
[1:22:51] feel
[1:22:52] the charge of god raise a dead body back
[1:22:53] to life
[1:22:56] but i can do what you've called me to do
[1:22:59] i can clean my house i can cook for my
[1:23:01] family
[1:23:03] go to work
[1:23:06] lord brother scott roberts was sharing
[1:23:09] with me about his schedule and
[1:23:12] up so early and home so late
[1:23:15] [Music]
[1:23:17] seems like the same thing every day lord
[1:23:20] he wasn't complaining he was just
[1:23:23] want me to know his schedule because i
[1:23:25] asked
[1:23:28] lord i pray that you would help
[1:23:31] him to seek purpose in the long hours
[1:23:35] just as i would desire for all of us to
[1:23:38] have a sense of purpose in our labor
[1:23:42] that it's not without consequence
[1:23:45] that what we do every day to serve our
[1:23:48] family what we do
[1:23:49] every day to provide what we do every
[1:23:51] day to make a living what we do every
[1:23:53] day
[1:23:53] to get an education to work whatever it
[1:23:55] is lord what we do every day
[1:23:58] can be the very thing that we need to do
[1:24:02] to express the word
[1:24:05] what i don't express it by going home
[1:24:07] and taking a message book and showing it
[1:24:09] in the mirror i don't do it by studying
[1:24:11] prayer alone lord that that's not how
[1:24:12] i'm going to do it i'm going to do it
[1:24:14] in a way that other people will be
[1:24:16] witnesses to it
[1:24:18] i'm going to do it in a way that my
[1:24:20] children feel it i'm going to do it in a
[1:24:21] way that my wife will feel it
[1:24:22] [Music]
[1:24:24] life lived by the word is the word
[1:24:26] expressed
[1:24:29] i know sometimes lord what we say with
[1:24:31] our lips
[1:24:33] doesn't harmonize with what we do
[1:24:37] but lord i know it matches what's deep
[1:24:41] within our souls
[1:24:42] as sons and daughters of god
[1:24:46] and may we humble ourselves before you
[1:24:48] tonight
[1:24:49] with this confession and this profession
[1:24:52] that we do
[1:24:52] desire to live the kind of life so that
[1:24:55] when you want to use this
[1:24:56] you know right where to find us let me
[1:25:00] be
[1:25:00] abraham may i can say it this way let me
[1:25:03] be
[1:25:04] sarah let us be doing what man and woman
[1:25:07] ought to do
[1:25:09] not begging for your presence but in
[1:25:12] your presence lord
[1:25:14] not hoping one day to serve you but
[1:25:16] knowing that now
[1:25:17] our lives can be poured out upon your
[1:25:19] feet as incense
[1:25:22] as oil lord that our labor and our
[1:25:26] expressions and our sacrifices
[1:25:29] what we do to teach in this natural life
[1:25:31] what we do to serve and
[1:25:34] what we do to earn a paycheck what we do
[1:25:36] to feel that we did our duty as a
[1:25:38] housekeeper or spouse or mother father
[1:25:40] lord it means something to you in this
[1:25:42] great economy
[1:25:43] that's leading us to a rapture that's
[1:25:46] what i desired lord to just seal it with
[1:25:49] is it has purpose it has meaning
[1:25:52] it's the lord may we then be not like
[1:25:56] dumb driven cattle
[1:25:58] [Music]
[1:25:59] but may we realize we're sons and
[1:26:01] daughters of god with a purpose
[1:26:03] [Music]
[1:26:06] may we live the life lord may we do that
[1:26:09] father i pray
[1:26:10] we commit these things to you in the
[1:26:13] name of the lord jesus christ we pray
[1:26:16] amen
