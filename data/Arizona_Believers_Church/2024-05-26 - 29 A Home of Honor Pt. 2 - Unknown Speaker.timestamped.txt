[0:00] Wednesday night we began on the subject
[0:02] of a home of honor and we were drawing
[0:07] from a place in Scripture it talks about
[0:08] an honest and good heart and we're
[0:11] taking it as an honest house and an
[0:13] unselfish house is one of the things
[0:15] that we touched on at the very end and
[0:18] highlighting certain characteristics of
[0:20] home life some things that I believe
[0:22] should be present if it's going to be a
[0:24] home and not just a place that we live
[0:27] if it's going to be a quiet resting
[0:28] place if it's going to be a peace ible
[0:30] habitation uh if it's going to be a sure
[0:32] secure dwelling there's certain
[0:34] characteristics that need to be there in
[0:36] order uh for there to be to have that
[0:39] atmosphere in a family where everyone's
[0:41] always pranking one another and playing
[0:43] jokes on each other there may be a
[0:44] certain level of tension that makes it
[0:46] more of an arena than it does a
[0:48] Peaceable habitation and so I say that
[0:51] just to point out if someone's always
[0:52] trying to trick you or lied to you can't
[0:54] trust them that would certainly make for
[0:55] an uncomfortable atmosphere in the home
[0:58] uh if everyone was always out to get
[1:00] their own um you know they would be
[1:02] hiding the good cereal which our kids do
[1:04] at times uh you can never find the bag
[1:06] of really really good chips um those
[1:08] have been stashed away somewhere somehow
[1:10] the best of the the frozen treats are
[1:13] gone uh within 24 hours of getting them
[1:15] so there's a lot of things where you got
[1:17] to get yours and you got to find it when
[1:19] you can and so honesty and unselfishness
[1:21] are kind of these themes that we're
[1:23] we're drawing from now if you look here
[1:26] in our text it speaks of a certain rich
[1:28] man and we took Wednesday night some
[1:31] time to show that Jesus is rebuking an
[1:34] attitude of the Pharisees in particular
[1:36] one thing he points out quite a bit
[1:38] about the Pharisees is that they are
[1:40] hypocrites and being a hypocrite it
[1:42] means they are a pretender uh they're
[1:44] just playing a part or playing a role
[1:46] the word speaks of a uh an actor or
[1:48] stage player so where they're
[1:50] impersonating something or playing the
[1:52] part and are they playing the part of a
[1:53] Pharisee no the Pharisee plays the part
[1:56] of one who is righteous they're not
[1:57] really righteous inwardly they just do
[2:00] things for pretense and for show to make
[2:02] you think that they're holy that they
[2:04] know the truth that they're right so
[2:06] that they can have some opportunity or
[2:08] privilege or right in Luke 12:1 Jesus
[2:11] says beware ye of the leaven of the
[2:13] Pharisees which is hypocrisy hypocrisy
[2:17] is the the sin of pretending that you
[2:18] have virtue the sin of pretending that
[2:20] you are good it's all for display and
[2:23] it's all for show and Jesus calls it
[2:25] leaven so it will corrupt it will
[2:27] pervade ultimately it will go through
[2:30] and through and so the leaven of the
[2:32] Pharisees is hypocrisy it's going to
[2:34] corrupt it's going to pervert and two
[2:37] words I want to use today to highlight
[2:40] the nature of these Pharisees and I hope
[2:42] that you can go back to Wednesday night
[2:43] and kind of see some of these
[2:44] characteristics as I don't know that we
[2:46] have much more review on this particular
[2:49] part but they were
[2:51] self-serving in other words they acted
[2:53] primarily for their own benefit they
[2:55] didn't do the things that they did for
[2:56] the benefit of others they did it solely
[2:58] for their own or primarily for their own
[3:00] benefit so they did things that served
[3:03] only themselves and then they were also
[3:05] self-preserving in other words they
[3:07] wanted to ensure their own Survival uh
[3:09] they needed to be relevant they needed
[3:10] to be needed and so these are things
[3:13] that are uh uh negative Dynamics within
[3:16] an individual it can be an atmosphere
[3:18] that begins to per pervade a group
[3:19] dynamic as it did the Pharisees but it's
[3:22] most important for us to apply it to
[3:24] ourselves as individuals what kind of
[3:26] Outlook we have on life are we
[3:28] self-serving where we act to benefit
[3:29] ourselves are we self-preserving where
[3:32] we want to uh ensure our own health and
[3:34] safety alone and our own Survival and in
[3:38] Proverbs 18:12 it says Before
[3:41] Destruction the heart of a man is hotti
[3:43] it is arrogant it is presumptuous it is
[3:45] lifted up and before honor is humility
[3:49] so if there's going to be any honor in
[3:51] our individual lives there needs to be
[3:52] humility there's going to be any honor
[3:54] in our homes there needs to be humility
[3:56] if there's going to be any honor of the
[3:57] Lord in this church there first needs to
[3:59] be humility uh that humility is not
[4:02] weakness it's not that well we're a
[4:03] broke Church we're a broken Church we're
[4:06] you know got all sorts of problems a a
[4:08] and we all make a bunch of mistakes and
[4:10] we're all adulterers and we all cuss and
[4:12] we smoke we're just broken people God
[4:14] bless us and and we got to give this
[4:16] idea since we can't do anything right
[4:17] we're humble no you're just
[4:19] wrong you still need Jesus You're
[4:21] Pitiful uh uh but it's not that's not
[4:24] humility humility is like meekness it's
[4:26] it's power under control where I could
[4:29] do this but I won't right I I could say
[4:32] this I could take advantage I could take
[4:33] opportunities but I'm not because I am
[4:36] respectful I I recognize that God is a
[4:38] god of boundaries and I respect other
[4:40] people's boundaries and I respect the
[4:42] boundaries of God's word I act within
[4:44] his parameters and that's my humility is
[4:47] to surrender myself to a greater
[4:49] Authority and when I act I'm not self
[4:51] asserting I'm not trying to promote
[4:53] myself I'm not trying to ensure my own
[4:54] Survival and I'm not just acting for my
[4:57] own benefit so that I look good I I I'm
[4:59] honestly will act to glorify the Lord
[5:01] and for the benefit of others and not
[5:04] really maybe just a good thesis
[5:06] statement for this morning now if you'll
[5:08] look at Luke chapter 16: 19 to 21 I'd
[5:11] like to read these to cue up and to tee
[5:14] up this Parable once again there was a
[5:18] certain rich man as I mentioned on
[5:21] Wednesday night the word that's used in
[5:23] the Latin Vulgate I pronounce it as
[5:25] Dives I would still stand by that as
[5:26] being one of the many pronunciations uh
[5:29] that are used used in the ecclesiastical
[5:30] realm around the world but I have been
[5:33] called to task by doctors and even the
[5:35] professor of Classics in Latin the
[5:38] University of Baylor was offered to me
[5:40] as an authority personally through a
[5:42] personal contact and so I'm going to go
[5:44] with Devas just to not run the risk of
[5:47] offending anybody who may be streaming
[5:48] this but dvas is also maybe the more
[5:51] appropriate ecclesiastical pronunciation
[5:54] if you really want the correct
[5:55] pronunciation ask Brother Scott Walker
[5:57] because I found out he's a true friend
[6:00] because he did not want another Mortage
[6:02] uh situation was like brother Aaron I
[6:04] really I studied this in college I
[6:06] really think we should talk about this
[6:07] and I was like that's a real friend
[6:09] emailed his Professor from many many
[6:11] years ago said hey my pastor said Dives
[6:13] the other night and I'm falling apart
[6:15] over here help us out and it was it was
[6:17] awesome I love it so D dvas it is and
[6:20] and that's what if we refer to him we
[6:22] might say I might say Dives U somebody
[6:24] queued up a very neat picture of the
[6:25] Rich Young Ruler with a guy feri uh and
[6:28] said this is this would be a perfect one
[6:30] for Sunday morning I didn't use it but
[6:32] it's in the queue perhaps maybe to use
[6:33] it in the future but there certain rich
[6:35] man in the Latin Devas we may say that
[6:38] he's the certain rich man uh but we it's
[6:41] great to have that nomination we refer
[6:43] to him and something stood out to me
[6:44] when I was studying this last week and
[6:46] so I was able to just really jump into
[6:48] it with Brother Scott when he was
[6:49] bringing up um some of these correct
[6:51] things and some of the things I was
[6:52] missing um I'd been studying it and
[6:54] trying to find the right way to say it
[6:56] and found it in the Latin the root for
[6:58] this word uh is it speaks of one it says
[7:01] rich man it speaks of in the Latin one
[7:04] that's favored by the
[7:06] gods and is uh blessed or
[7:10] Divine and I felt it was no coincidence
[7:12] that this would become somewhat of a
[7:15] colloquial reference to this rich man
[7:18] because his wealth gave the appearance
[7:20] that he was blessed it gave him the
[7:23] appearance of being favored by God so
[7:25] this uh Devas was one that one would
[7:27] look at say man he has made God proud
[7:30] God has favored him God has blessed him
[7:33] and now as we continue to read about
[7:35] this uh certain rich man he was clothed
[7:37] in purple and fine linen and feed
[7:39] sumptuously every day he's got it he's
[7:41] got it going on and and he's blessed
[7:44] he's blessed he seems to be favored and
[7:46] and then it says there was a certain
[7:48] beggar and and immediately we know not
[7:50] he's not blessed because he's a beggar
[7:53] named Lazarus one does not have a name
[7:55] the other is named and I think that that
[7:57] is is relevant to how Jesus is trying to
[7:59] lay this out he says which was laid at
[8:01] his gate full of sores this tells us
[8:03] that he has open wounds that no one is
[8:05] treating he has H uh that says the dogs
[8:07] come and lick uh his wounds and his
[8:10] sores the dogs care enough about them uh
[8:13] than him than anybody else and it's a
[8:15] it's a really poor and pitiful situation
[8:17] and he's laid at dias's gate in other
[8:21] words he can't even make it himself
[8:23] there but one has assisted him and help
[8:25] him to be there and it says and Desiring
[8:26] to be fed with the crumbs which fell
[8:28] from the rich man's table
[8:30] I read in one place where the crumbs
[8:31] would be the things that would be
[8:32] brushed off of someone's hands and it's
[8:35] those things that he would have been
[8:37] happy to eat the things that Annoy Us
[8:39] and the things that bother us H we want
[8:41] to get it off our hands it's those
[8:43] things he would have been happy to
[8:45] eat and as we think of this contrasting
[8:48] pictures of a certain rich man in
[8:50] Lazarus we pointed out that the rich
[8:53] man's lifestyle and all the things that
[8:55] he had were no indication of God's favor
[8:57] or God's blessing I almost said flavor
[9:00] flavor town the rich man's uh flavor but
[9:04] it there was no indication at all that
[9:06] he was blessed you you couldn't deduce
[9:09] because he had a house with the gate and
[9:10] because he drove a nice car because he
[9:12] wore nice clothes and all these things
[9:14] and ate well that he must be pleasing
[9:16] the Lord it was no indication that he
[9:19] had morality that he had character that
[9:21] God had favored him and in the inverse
[9:23] lazarus's poverty is no indication of a
[9:26] lack of morality we can say oh well he's
[9:28] homeless because he was a
[9:29] addict or he's homeless because he was a
[9:31] con man and he's this way because he had
[9:33] this problem he did that problem you
[9:34] can't make these assumptions about
[9:36] Lazarus it was no indication of his lack
[9:39] of morality or a lack of character and
[9:41] it was no indication of the lack of
[9:43] God's blessing or
[9:44] favor I know those things are difficult
[9:47] to wrestle with individually or when we
[9:48] view the circumstances of someone else
[9:50] one of the most controversial stories in
[9:53] scripture for the critic the skeptic and
[9:54] even for the Christians and whatever
[9:56] side you're on is the story of job it's
[9:59] so difficult to wrestle with the the way
[10:02] that that story is presented that here's
[10:04] a man who seems like he's doing
[10:06] everything right and God wagers with the
[10:07] devil for his life to be completely
[10:09] destroyed and who is it that suffers the
[10:11] children the wife and everyone and yet
[10:13] job maintains his uprightness and how
[10:15] that story could be used to justify so
[10:18] many different things it's really really
[10:19] hard to wrestle with and so we I would
[10:22] acknowledge the difficulty when we see
[10:24] someone suffering when we see somebody
[10:26] without when we see somebody losing
[10:28] somebody homeless a beggar full of sores
[10:30] who's being disregarded but we we have
[10:33] to keep in context the the Heavenly and
[10:36] the
[10:36] Earthly and that this life isn't the
[10:39] only life and God's blessings aren't
[10:40] always counted by carnal
[10:43] means and in the sman church age of the
[10:47] church age book it's chapter 4 brother
[10:49] brandham writes this he says here's
[10:51] where you have to believe again in the
[10:53] love and goodness and wisdom of God and
[10:56] said that way in the sense that it's
[10:58] would be easy to wrestle with his love
[11:00] it's easy to question his goodness and
[11:04] and rationalize with his wisdom given
[11:07] the circumstances of his children at
[11:09] time he said this too is needful
[11:11] remember he admonished take no thought
[11:14] for the tomorrow what you shall eat or
[11:16] what you shall put
[11:17] on we'll come back to these scriptures I
[11:19] believe later so it's good maybe that
[11:22] they they're entered into the record
[11:23] now and this is something that's become
[11:26] more and more pronounced to me that when
[11:28] when I look at message of the hour I'm
[11:30] not just looking at it as a singular
[11:33] message and this is what he said in this
[11:35] sermon and then you dissect that to try
[11:37] to figure it all out and and present
[11:39] what brother Brandon was teaching in
[11:41] that message to me it's a body of work
[11:42] that uh to understand even things that
[11:45] were said early on in his ministry it's
[11:47] good to stay in the continuity of it and
[11:49] see what he said later on and and look
[11:50] at it as God speaking to us through that
[11:53] vessel and through that Prophet a a and
[11:56] not just to cabbage down on one part but
[11:58] realize I need to maybe take everything
[12:00] in total and everything in whole as much
[12:02] as I possibly can so I'm going to
[12:04] continually to pray and seek the Lord
[12:06] for Revelation so that I can understand
[12:08] his thoughts towards me well if we take
[12:10] that approach with the message of the
[12:11] hour even more so with the Bible that we
[12:14] can't just take any truth and isolate it
[12:17] from the whole body of
[12:18] Truth said he said this and say all
[12:21] right well we're going to take this
[12:22] principle and put over here and that God
[12:23] does this and but if you isolate it from
[12:26] the broader context of the whole truth
[12:28] then this be given way too much weight
[12:31] or not enough
[12:33] weight and we misuse it then and so when
[12:37] when brother brandham says considering
[12:39] his love and goodness and wisdom take
[12:41] this into consideration how the
[12:43] scripture admonishes us take no thought
[12:45] for the marrow what you shall eat or
[12:46] what you shall put on your father
[12:48] knoweth the things you have need of he
[12:50] who clothes the Lily and feeds the
[12:52] sparrow shall do much more for you these
[12:54] physical things are not the true basic
[12:56] necessities of your life for a man's
[12:58] life consisteth not of the things he
[13:00] possesses but rather seek first the
[13:03] kingdom of God and his righteousness and
[13:05] all material Necessities will be added
[13:08] unto you we could argue that wouldn't a
[13:10] God who loves us just simply give us all
[13:12] those things regardless of our attitude
[13:15] in our efforts and and good if he loves
[13:18] us just lavish us with certain things
[13:20] and you would realize real quick that
[13:22] that doesn't even work in Natural
[13:24] Life uh to do that with your own
[13:26] children and your own relationship so
[13:28] there's some wisdom and Prudence that we
[13:30] begin to gather from this and then this
[13:31] is the statement I think that's
[13:32] beautiful summary how the necessities of
[13:35] life and for a man's life consists not
[13:38] just in the things he possesses then he
[13:40] says the people of God are not material-
[13:42] minded and all the people of God said
[13:44] amen they are christm minded they do not
[13:48] seek the treasures that are below they
[13:50] seek those above it is absolutely true
[13:53] the majority of Christians are not
[13:55] wealthy rather they are on the Poor Side
[13:59] it was so in Jesus's day it was true in
[14:01] Paul's day and it should be true today
[14:04] oh it is not TR too true today for the L
[14:06] toen age is one of the vast one of vast
[14:09] wealth where often the Criterion of
[14:11] spirituality is an abundance of Earthly
[14:15] Goods this is just our Instinct it's
[14:17] kind of our base nature and certain uh
[14:21] and I don't know if it's so much true
[14:22] now but this is just kind of what we've
[14:24] learned in uh in our Readers Digest or
[14:26] whatever it is we would read growing up
[14:28] that certain cultures if a man was fat
[14:31] he was blessed he was rich because he
[14:32] could afford to
[14:34] overeat and so there are certain things
[14:36] that are that are a show or display that
[14:38] man this guy's got it going on he's got
[14:40] it figured out well I think there's the
[14:41] same there's the same mentality where we
[14:43] see certain people as being spiritual a
[14:47] a and they must be blessed and they must
[14:48] be doing things right because our
[14:50] barometer for God's blessings is an
[14:52] abundance of Earthly goods and just
[14:55] think of how much pretense there is to
[14:57] that where the measuring is is the
[15:00] outward things he goes my how rich the
[15:03] church is in Goods but how poor in
[15:05] spirit in other words not that they're
[15:07] poor in spirit as Jesus would desire
[15:09] them to be but lacking the capital S
[15:11] Spirit blessed be the poor for yours is
[15:14] the kingdom of God the kingdom of God is
[15:16] Not meat and
[15:18] drink it is not
[15:21] Material it is within
[15:24] us that that the idea of the kingdom of
[15:27] God as he says as he's quoting that seek
[15:30] ye first uh the kingdom of God is what
[15:32] he's referring to in his righteousness
[15:33] and then these material Necessities will
[15:36] be added under your provided he says the
[15:38] kingdom is within us and he says a rich
[15:41] man is rich in God not in worldly
[15:45] things a rich man is rich in God not in
[15:49] worldly things now if we read that the
[15:52] wrong thing we would say a man who's got
[15:54] a lot of money has a lot of
[15:57] God but what he say is a a man who is
[16:01] rich in God is a rich
[16:04] man I I I can't remember just exactly
[16:07] how it is I think it was brother Le
[16:09] Lester Buckley that first said it but he
[16:10] said he was either horse rich or horse
[16:12] poor meaning all his money was in
[16:15] horses and maybe was horse poor might be
[16:17] the way you say it like I'm horse poor
[16:19] I've got a 100 horses and that's why I'm
[16:22] poor maybe I should uh have him email me
[16:25] exactly what that phrase was but there's
[16:27] this idea that if a a man is rich in God
[16:30] no matter how poor he may be he's rich
[16:32] in God so a rich man is one that is rich
[16:35] in God not one that is rich in worldly
[16:38] things just because you're rich in
[16:40] worldly things and even if you attribute
[16:42] that to God and you acknowledge that all
[16:44] good things come from God and I have
[16:46] this wealth because of God it's not
[16:48] because of your wealth that you are
[16:49] wealthy it's because God that's why you
[16:53] can be rich amen so there's a being rich
[16:56] in this world and being rich in God
[16:57] those are two different riches and so
[16:59] you could be D so your name could be
[17:01] rich and I want to be a one that's rich
[17:03] in
[17:04] God Luke 16 Verse 22 now as we're just
[17:08] continuing on where we were at there now
[17:11] we have the rich man and we have Lazarus
[17:14] and it came to pass that the beggar
[17:15] Lazarus died and was carried by the
[17:18] Angels into Abraham's bosom Jesus now as
[17:20] he's telling this Parable to a captive
[17:22] audience he needs to use a language he
[17:24] doesn't have the privilege of a 29 part
[17:27] series at this point
[17:29] he's got to get to the point here and
[17:31] he's going to give a lot of uh images in
[17:34] this very statement that the beggar is
[17:36] carried by angels He was carried by men
[17:39] to the gate of the rich man but now
[17:42] Angels carry him to the Gate of Heaven
[17:44] into the very bosom of Abraham and then
[17:47] it's almost dismissive the rich man died
[17:49] also and was
[17:51] buried and then and in hell he lifted up
[17:55] his eyes being in torments what a
[17:57] contrast in the bosom of Abraham which
[17:59] was analogous to the paradise he is in
[18:04] the bosom of Abraham Lazarus is but now
[18:07] the rich man is in Hell being in
[18:09] torments and I like that it's not being
[18:10] in torment he's in
[18:13] torments and it is and seeth Abraham a
[18:16] far off and now he's able to see Abraham
[18:19] and Lazarus in his bosom it's remarkable
[18:23] that on a daily basis he was able to see
[18:25] Lazarus carried by men to his gate and
[18:28] he was Ed maybe at multiple points in
[18:30] his day of Lazarus and there was always
[18:32] this image and then even after he dies
[18:34] he's not able to escape the image of the
[18:37] beggar but now he's no longer at his
[18:39] gates in hell he is now in the bosom of
[18:42] Abraham and he's being he's in
[18:47] torments now if we look at this picture
[18:49] now and I want you to
[18:51] consider what a horrific uh feeling that
[18:55] must have been that Jesus is trying to
[18:58] convey
[19:00] so what is the lesson that Jesus is
[19:03] trying to teach his disciples as their
[19:07] primarily his audience as he begin we'll
[19:09] come to it here at the beginning of the
[19:10] chapter he said unto his disciples but
[19:11] yet the the Pharisees and the publicans
[19:14] and all were very close to him uh uh
[19:17] hearing him give these Parables before
[19:19] as you look in chapter 15 and so they
[19:22] are the ones that kind of interject and
[19:23] they rebuke him and chide him in the
[19:25] middle of the chapter and so what is he
[19:28] trying to to teach his disciples also
[19:30] what is he rebuking to the in the
[19:33] Pharisees in verse 25 is Abraham
[19:37] speaking now to the rich man but
[19:40] Abraham's son said remember that thou in
[19:43] thy lifetime receivest thy good
[19:45] things and likewise Lazarus evil thing
[19:48] so there's really no splitting hairs
[19:51] about oh no it it was a blessing that he
[19:53] was full of sores and it was a blessing
[19:56] that he was laid at the gate we have to
[19:58] be careful sometimes the way that we
[19:59] characterize our suffering and realize
[20:02] hey that you know what suffering is
[20:03] suffering and abuse in any context is
[20:06] abuse and it's evil and so he suffered
[20:09] evil things now I realized that trying
[20:12] to figure out why God would allow
[20:13] certain things is is is a difficult
[20:16] exercise but he acknowledges that yeah
[20:18] the the rich man got good things Lazarus
[20:20] evil things but now in the final
[20:22] analysis with the Eternal weight now he
[20:25] is comfort and thou art tormented so I
[20:28] would ask who was the rich man
[20:30] ultimately as we pointed out Wednesday
[20:32] Lazareth means God is my
[20:36] help and maybe what a reproach for one
[20:38] who laid at the gate and people would
[20:40] say there's Lazarus God sure helped him
[20:42] out didn't
[20:44] he right and just the mocking and the
[20:46] ridicule that perhaps he would have
[20:48] endured but yet for for Lazarus we could
[20:51] say that the true riches are not
[20:53] material but
[20:55] spiritual that lazarus's wealth and
[20:58] abundance was not in Earthly Goods but
[21:01] his he was there was something spiritual
[21:03] about him that despite him being
[21:05] destitute he still trusted in God and so
[21:08] how do you know he trusted in God that
[21:09] when it came to his death and maybe he
[21:11] died because of infection maybe he died
[21:13] because of hunger or neglect but
[21:14] regardless we know that he died and
[21:16] maybe he died much more quickly than the
[21:18] rich man had died and the man had just
[21:19] completely forgot Lazarus was ever a
[21:21] beggar he just went home one day and he
[21:23] was no longer there and the dogs were
[21:24] off licking somebody else's sores and so
[21:27] yet we realize that Lazarus then comes
[21:29] to his end and his demise and it's then
[21:32] that God carries him away we could argue
[21:35] well how could you say that he was
[21:36] blessed and how could you say that he he
[21:38] was rich and and good things to the very
[21:40] end he trusted God and God honored his
[21:42] faith by carrying him into the bosom of
[21:47] Abraham he was rich in Heavenly things
[21:50] and spiritual things because that's what
[21:52] he inherited the Bible says in Proverbs
[21:56] 23:4 I will go ahead and acknowledge
[21:58] that I'm repeating a lot of things that
[22:00] have already been mentioned over this
[22:01] pulpit and and you're going to find
[22:03] eventually that I'm just always quoting
[22:05] the same Bible quoting the same
[22:08] messenger and and so Proverbs 23:4 says
[22:11] labor not to be
[22:13] rich cease from thine own wisdom so
[22:16] there's a wisdom of this Earth there's
[22:18] this base nature that we have where I
[22:20] need to get rich or di triing I need to
[22:22] get mine when I have the opportunity uh
[22:24] you know take advantage of these chances
[22:27] uh you look got after yourself I'm
[22:29] looking out after Numero Uno uh you you
[22:32] you you know there's a dog eat dog
[22:34] mentality it's a rat race uh these
[22:37] different things says cease from thine
[22:38] own wisdom so because you shouldn't be
[22:40] striving and stressing and laboring and
[22:42] exerting and putting everything into
[22:45] compiling wealth or riches sorry David
[22:49] Ramsey uh my my ambition in life is not
[22:53] to hoard
[22:54] wealth at least we should not labor to
[22:57] be rich neither should you labor to be
[23:02] poor give me poverty nor riches Just
[23:05] Give Me A Life That's pleasing to
[23:08] you 1 Timothy chapter 6: 17 and 18 as
[23:11] we've referenced this quite a bit in
[23:13] this theme charge them that are rich in
[23:15] this world so there are those that are
[23:17] rich in this world but Paul recognizes
[23:19] there must be a specific charge to them
[23:22] that are rich in this world to all the
[23:24] riches who are here there's a charge for
[23:26] you if you're rich in this world you are
[23:28] not to be high-m minded you are not to
[23:31] trust in those riches because they will
[23:33] fail you they are uncertain but trust in
[23:37] the Living
[23:38] God so if there are any here that would
[23:41] be considered wealthy or you have a
[23:42] little bit higher uh uh balance sheet on
[23:45] your Ledger than others would have it's
[23:47] so it's not that if you're rich you
[23:48] can't be a Christian you can't be a
[23:50] message believer but if you are rich you
[23:52] should always remember to not be
[23:55] high-minded not think more of yourself
[23:56] than you ought to to not be ar arant or
[23:58] presumptuous and whatever you do don't
[24:00] trust in your
[24:02] wealth trust in God and then makes a
[24:06] statement that we hope to revisit here
[24:07] in a few
[24:09] moments who gives us this living God who
[24:11] gives us richly all things to enjoy the
[24:15] use of the term richly I is not by
[24:18] accident God who is Rich lavishes us
[24:21] with things to enjoy he is he is
[24:23] generous towards us and therefore we
[24:26] realize I will not trust in the riches
[24:29] because I will ultimately recognize that
[24:31] there is a living God who has given
[24:33] richly to me therefore whatever I have
[24:36] he's given
[24:38] me he said then continuing to charge
[24:41] those that are rich in this world that
[24:43] they do good that they be rich in Good
[24:46] Works notice all these riches they that
[24:49] are rich in this world should trust in a
[24:52] God who is
[24:53] Rich and that they should be rich in
[24:57] Good Works
[24:59] ready to distribute of their riches
[25:02] willing to communicate through their
[25:04] wealth it's exactly what he's saying he
[25:08] doesn't mean ready to willing to
[25:09] communicate in other words always answer
[25:10] your text messages dude come on respond
[25:12] to emails in a timely manner return
[25:14] phone calls it's saying there ought to
[25:16] be a
[25:18] desire to make use of the richness of
[25:23] God in your life for the benefit of
[25:25] others and not just for
[25:27] yourself so Jesus is as he has phrased
[25:31] these things and he carefully crafted
[25:34] this Parable and I believe God watching
[25:36] out over its different tellings and its
[25:39] translations so that there could be
[25:40] thoughts conveyed to us Jesus is
[25:42] addressing the selfs serving
[25:44] self-preserving
[25:46] Behavior not just in the rich man but in
[25:48] the Pharisees and using it as
[25:51] instruction to his disciples don't be
[25:53] these people don't be like
[25:55] this it was selfishness verse is
[25:59] selflessness there was a selfishness on
[26:01] the part of the rich man there was a
[26:03] selfishness on the part of the way the
[26:05] Pharisees conducted themselves and so
[26:07] Jesus wants to kind of catch them in
[26:09] this moment especially after the
[26:11] Pharisees ridicule him on this prior
[26:13] parable about the unjust Steward and and
[26:16] he's he's wanting to reinforce these
[26:20] things it says in verse
[26:23] 14 and the Pharisees also who were
[26:25] Covetous they were lovers of riches
[26:29] they lusted after they desired it they
[26:30] labored to be rich they were
[26:32] self-serving and self-protecting when
[26:34] they heard these things they derided him
[26:36] now we'll come back to what these things
[26:38] are but notice this is the context for
[26:39] the parable of the rich man he says and
[26:42] he said unto them ye are they which
[26:44] justify yourselves before men it's an
[26:48] attitude where they're more concerned
[26:50] about being perceived to be right than
[26:52] actually being right there's always an
[26:54] excuse there's always an explanation
[26:56] there's always going a step further
[26:57] there's just no will willingness just to
[26:58] say yes that is how it is I agree I
[27:01] accept they justify themselves not even
[27:04] before God they're only worried about
[27:06] the pretense says but God knows your
[27:09] hearts for that which is highly esteemed
[27:12] among men is abomination in the sight of
[27:15] God what would impress men doesn't
[27:18] impress God when the Bible says labor
[27:21] not to be rich it says cease from thine
[27:23] own wisdom this is what men would highly
[27:26] esteem one who is a go-getter one who
[27:28] hustles one who who knows how to make
[27:31] money and and a lot of times we applaud
[27:34] those who who make millions and then
[27:35] lose them just as easily but can always
[27:37] make them again a and we kind of like
[27:40] man these guys are amazing he made a
[27:42] million dollars and lost it made it
[27:43] again and lost it and we kind of admire
[27:45] this and we make them Our Heroes so
[27:47] guess what whatever you win by following
[27:50] that guy's trajectory you're probably
[27:52] going to
[27:53] lose cuz that's the way that it
[27:56] works so there's a certain wisdom of
[27:59] this world that go brother excuse me
[28:00] that Jesus is saying is highly esteemed
[28:03] among men but is an abomination in the
[28:05] sight of God that's important as we
[28:07] continue I'm I'm going way too slow
[28:09] today so we may just have to pick this
[28:11] up next Sunday but there is
[28:14] a uh you me to stop now I mean I don't
[28:17] know Portillo's open it's 11 o' should
[28:20] be there's
[28:22] a they justify themselves before men and
[28:26] they esteem certain things for pretense
[28:28] sake that God thinks is an
[28:31] Abomination like wow that was shrewd
[28:33] that was wise that was good but God says
[28:35] it's an
[28:36] Abomination to be selfish is to be
[28:38] devoted to caring only for
[28:42] yourself devoted to yourself caring only
[28:45] for yourself is to be concerned with
[28:48] your your own individual interest I I
[28:50] want to begin that with the individual
[28:53] if you are selfish you're concerned
[28:54] about yourself you're only devoted to
[28:57] caring for yourself and you're only
[28:59] worried about yourself now if we were to
[29:01] extend that to a family it would be a
[29:02] family that only lives to itself and s
[29:04] in a church the same way that we're just
[29:06] kind of protective of our image we're
[29:07] protective of our congregants we're
[29:09] protective of what we're doing and we
[29:11] never live beyond ourselves but to be
[29:13] selfless is to be concerned more with
[29:16] the needs and desires of others than
[29:17] what with one's own so to be selfless
[29:21] doesn't mean you couldn't care less
[29:23] about yourself or that you completely
[29:26] disregard yourself and you're into uh uh
[29:29] being taken advantage of and and and
[29:31] being abused and this is just what a
[29:33] Christian does no that's just that's the
[29:35] wrong kind of teaching so that someone
[29:37] from a position of power can keep taking
[29:39] advantage of you but it is that you have
[29:41] this mindset where you are concerned
[29:43] more with others needs you're concerned
[29:45] about yourself but you're not willing to
[29:47] take care of yourself at someone else's
[29:49] expense you're also concerned more with
[29:52] the needs and desires of others and not
[29:53] just your own
[29:55] needs now take into consideration then
[29:57] this definition of being selfish or
[29:59] selfless look at the response of the
[30:02] rich man when he suddenly dies and or
[30:04] say suddenly but he finds himself in
[30:06] hell and as Jesus tells the story he's
[30:09] in Hell being in torments and all of a
[30:11] sudden he's able to see from Hell
[30:13] Lazarus this one that was a beggar at
[30:15] his gate all these days or years or
[30:17] whatever it was he's in the bosom of
[30:20] Abraham he occupies the place that this
[30:23] rich man thought he deserved and had
[30:24] earned in
[30:26] life and
[30:28] Abraham and in seeing this notice what
[30:31] his immediate response is verse 24 and
[30:35] he cried and said Father Abraham have
[30:38] mercy on me for I was a miserable wretch
[30:41] I was a grinch I did so many things
[30:43] wrong in life I was a scrooge I
[30:45] disregarded your son Lazarus was a good
[30:47] man forgive me for the way I treated
[30:53] him it's kind of like the kids are
[30:55] listening to some Adventures in Odyssey
[30:57] where they tell the story of
[30:59] Joseph if he was
[31:01] selfish was it selfish was the word is
[31:04] that the one or he didn't want to
[31:06] forgive and so his brother's like hey
[31:08] Joseph we're really sorry and he's like
[31:09] yeah you shouldn't have done that who
[31:11] wor you wore my coat who does that lock
[31:13] him up throwing him in jail and it leads
[31:15] to this terrible
[31:16] catastrophe where Aliens destroy the
[31:18] world it's like what kind of episode is
[31:21] this it's one of my
[31:26] favorites but if we reach told this in a
[31:29] way that maybe it should have been the
[31:31] rich man would have been horrified oh
[31:34] God Abraham have mercy on me I failed
[31:37] what you stood for your faith and I
[31:39] didn't do anything like you did you
[31:41] erected a Grove and the desert to take
[31:44] care of people like Lazarus and I got so
[31:46] caught up in my own things but notice
[31:48] you're already reading it so you know
[31:49] that I'm being dramatic have mercy on me
[31:52] in s Lazarus so that I can hug his neck
[31:54] and I could ask for forgiveness no that
[31:56] he may dip the tip of his finger in
[31:59] water and cool my
[32:01] tongue for I am tormented in this flame
[32:05] you want to talk about character and all
[32:07] death does is change your Dwelling Place
[32:10] torments couldn't change this guy's
[32:13] character realizing that he had been
[32:15] wrong he still couldn't wake up right
[32:19] and what does he want from Lazarus could
[32:21] you dip your finger in water and comra
[32:25] the torments of hell and Fire to cool my
[32:29] tongue I want you to risk being burned I
[32:32] want you to risk departing from
[32:34] Abraham's bosom I'm in need here don't
[32:36] you see I'm in torments I'm burning up
[32:38] dip your finger in water and cool my
[32:41] tongue and some may say oh what a humble
[32:43] gesture this is arrogance at its worst
[32:46] hiding behind the pretense of oh I'll
[32:49] just take a
[32:51] drop and Lazarus is thinking well maybe
[32:54] Lazarus wouldn't be thinking it but
[32:55] we're thinking Lazarus just wanted a
[32:58] crumb
[32:59] dude I think your drop's a little too
[33:02] late
[33:04] bro he was self-centered you know how
[33:07] self-centered he was he knew lazarus's
[33:11] name so it's not like Lazarus was an
[33:13] unknown to him he immediately recognizes
[33:16] him he knows him by name and says
[33:19] Abraham have Lazarus come and cool my
[33:22] tongue I'm
[33:24] tormented recognize the nature of the
[33:26] rich man
[33:29] he never looked beyond
[33:32] himself even when he knew somebody's
[33:34] name Abraham you know how some people
[33:36] always call you by your name because
[33:37] they're trying to sell you something now
[33:39] listen Aaron Aaron Aaron I want to come
[33:42] up with a really weird name next time I
[33:43] run into a Salesman like that just to
[33:45] see if he can keep saying it
[33:50] right he never looks beyond his own
[33:53] possessions he never looks beyond his
[33:55] own wants in his own life in his natural
[33:57] life he never did that and now in Hell
[33:59] he's of the same character he still
[34:01] doesn't look Beyond himself he's
[34:03] oblivious in life he's oblivious and now
[34:05] in Hell he's
[34:07] oblivious still can't understand the
[34:09] true nature of his torment to think that
[34:11] it'd even be worth the effort to just
[34:13] put a drop of water on his
[34:15] tongue does he not recognize and
[34:17] appreciate the gravity of the
[34:23] situation I think there's a lot to think
[34:26] about whole lot to think about in this
[34:29] picture
[34:31] of this Rich Man versus Lazarus he never
[34:37] looked
[34:39] beyond acting
[34:41] doing you name it for
[34:45] himself if it wouldn't benefit him it
[34:48] wasn't worth undertaking and I'm I'm
[34:50] emphasizing this just so you could catch
[34:51] it personally he didn't regard Lazarus
[34:55] in life nor in death
[34:58] because he wanted him to sacrifice
[35:01] himself and do greater than he was
[35:04] willing to do in
[35:07] life he was clueless about what he
[35:10] needed I don't know if I'm going to have
[35:12] time today to get to
[35:14] it Devas was
[35:17] clueless about what he actually needed
[35:20] in life he let his riches obscure what
[35:23] he actually
[35:24] needed and worse yet it BL Ed him to the
[35:28] needs of
[35:30] others Luke 16:
[35:35] 1-15 this is an important context to the
[35:38] parable that we've been reading these
[35:39] last two
[35:41] Services the rich man and Lazarus should
[35:44] be I think it's better understood by the
[35:47] parable that Jesus has just told there
[35:50] are other things that are said in these
[35:52] prior chapters that kind of tie in as
[35:54] you look at the Lost coin and the lost
[35:56] son the lost sheep and the the prior
[35:58] chapter so there's definitely this
[35:59] continuity to these different themes
[36:01] they all tied together but here in
[36:03] particular after he has addressed the
[36:05] the scribes and these different critics
[36:06] and ones the publicans that had come
[36:08] unto him he said unto his disciples Luke
[36:12] 16 ver1 I believe I'm going to read all
[36:13] the way to verse uh 13 or
[36:16] 15 he
[36:19] says there was a certain rich
[36:22] man now he revisits the same phrase
[36:25] later on in the parable of the rich man
[36:27] and Lazarus so now I think there is some
[36:29] connection here in terms of status or or
[36:33] position uh certain privileges that one
[36:35] might have it may doesn't have to be the
[36:37] same person but we're looking at a
[36:38] certain class of people that present a
[36:39] certain way live a certain way think a
[36:41] certain way there was a c certain rich
[36:43] man which had a steward and the same was
[36:46] accused unto him that he had wasted his
[36:48] good what's good what's unique about
[36:50] this is there's not a clear connection
[36:53] between the rich man in God and the
[36:55] steward being Israel uh
[36:58] there there's it's something that's set
[36:59] forth in a way do you realize this is
[37:00] and I'm going to say this way it's
[37:01] almost as if this is a purely carnal
[37:04] Endeavor just like the unjust judge and
[37:07] the Widow that wearied him that he's
[37:09] using this in the sense that this is
[37:10] what the unjust does then he's saying if
[37:12] the wicked will do that how much more
[37:14] your father so in the same sense he's
[37:15] kind of saying this is just something
[37:17] that may happen in Natural Life a rich
[37:19] man has a steward and that word Steward
[37:22] there is comes from the word that we
[37:24] would use about a deacon uh one that is
[37:28] uh would is willing to serve a servant
[37:31] and the same was accused unto him that
[37:33] he had wasted his Goods so this Steward
[37:35] had wasted his master's Goods he hadn't
[37:38] looked out after them he'd squandered
[37:39] them and he called the steward and said
[37:42] unto him how is it that I hear this of
[37:43] thee I've heard that you've been wasting
[37:45] my goods I hear that you haven't been
[37:46] managing these accounts properly and my
[37:48] estate's being wasted you're wasting the
[37:50] money so he says give an account of thy
[37:52] stewardship think of that give an
[37:54] account I'm holding you accountable for
[37:56] how you behaved with what I gave you
[37:58] give an account of thy stewardship for
[38:02] thou mayest be no longer
[38:03] Steward now recognizing that he has been
[38:06] called out the steward again Jesus
[38:08] crafting this narrative is in a way that
[38:10] tells the point so sometimes what he
[38:12] doesn't say is just as important as what
[38:13] he's saying that the steward does not
[38:15] say that's a lie I've been honest the
[38:18] lord taketh away from me the stewardship
[38:21] he knew he had been found
[38:23] out I'm not willing to work and I got
[38:26] too much price to
[38:28] beg I cannot dig I'm not willing to work
[38:31] hard I'm not willing to do the labor
[38:32] that's beneath me to beg I am ashamed I
[38:35] am resolved what to do that when I am
[38:37] put out of the stewardship they may
[38:40] receive me into their houses so critical
[38:42] to catch this in light of what we read
[38:44] about the rich man in Lazarus in other
[38:45] words he realizes he's about to lose his
[38:47] job so he's going to get all the
[38:49] supplies from the supply cabinet he
[38:51] possibly
[38:52] can he's about to lose his job so he's
[38:54] going to take advantage of all the
[38:56] resources he has kind of like if we were
[38:58] getting ready to leave Arizona we would
[39:00] all submit receipts for Esa
[39:03] funds everybody in the family I have an
[39:05] iPad for math I have an iPad for history
[39:07] I have an iPad for science right we'd
[39:10] all we would just lavish ourselves and
[39:12] take advantage of everything that was
[39:14] available to us because pretty soon if
[39:16] we're at least halfway honest we would
[39:18] stop doing it once we
[39:19] left but maybe there's a
[39:23] loophole so he is saying I want to do
[39:27] things now so that once I'm fired I will
[39:32] have gained the favor of others who will
[39:35] return kindness kindness to me and take
[39:38] care of
[39:39] me I'm going to be nice to somebody else
[39:43] so that when they see that I've been
[39:44] fired they'll take pity on me notice the
[39:47] sole reason for acting to benefit
[39:49] himself so he called every one of his
[39:51] Lord's debtors unto him and said unto
[39:53] the first how much thou owest unto my
[39:55] Lord how much do you owe my master he
[39:58] said a 100 measures of oil and he said
[40:01] take thy Bill sit down quickly and write
[40:03] 50 now I want you to know just how
[40:07] deceptive this is one owes oil so he's
[40:11] going to have him settle that account
[40:14] and he then he said another how much
[40:15] owest th and he said a 100 measures of
[40:17] wheat the other owes wheat so take thy
[40:20] Bill and write for score so notice
[40:23] there's different measures right based
[40:26] upon the there's a different value
[40:28] attributed to what the resource is so he
[40:31] is able to offer to the one a 50%
[40:34] discount the other 20% but then he could
[40:37] present the payoff as the
[40:40] opposite to his boss and Leverage come
[40:43] on you don't realize this kind of stuff
[40:45] happens he's going to leverage that to
[40:47] where his master
[40:49] thinks that he has settled the accounts
[40:52] and gained more but what he doesn't
[40:53] realize is one did 50 and one did 80 but
[40:55] now he's presenting it differently and
[40:57] he thinks this is shrewd the funds are
[40:59] Cod mingled he knows that they both ow
[41:01] he's essentially owed a hundred measures
[41:03] of this and a 100 measures of that but
[41:05] he's written out something different and
[41:07] he pays differently and then so you
[41:09] catch what's happening here this is all
[41:11] deceit and why is he doing it not
[41:13] because the guy that owns a hundred
[41:14] measures of oil needs a break and he's
[41:18] down on his luck he's probably a
[41:20] businessman just like the master but now
[41:22] this intermediary here's working on
[41:24] behalf of the master this goes to show
[41:26] the deceitful of riches the more wealth
[41:28] you have the more you have to rely upon
[41:30] others to manage and look after it and
[41:32] in that way there's always one who might
[41:34] stand in the
[41:37] middle and this one is taking doing
[41:39] these deals oh you owe a 100 write me a
[41:41] bill for 50 and you're let go and the
[41:43] guy's like sweet came out good on this
[41:46] deal he's a businessman right he's happy
[41:48] it's not necessarily ding someone down
[41:50] on their luck then the next one how many
[41:52] measures of wheat oh you know what you
[41:54] got a you 100 take write a bill for 80
[41:56] sweet I made a better
[41:59] deal then the Lord the Lord here is not
[42:02] a capital l it is a the rich
[42:06] man it is a businessman it is a man
[42:09] whose wealth had become so great he
[42:10] relied upon stewards to look after his
[42:13] Affairs he commended the unjust Steward
[42:17] because he had done
[42:19] wisely for the children of this world
[42:21] are in their generation wiser than the
[42:22] children of light
[42:29] I'll be honest this Parable is has been
[42:33] hard for me to figure
[42:34] out I think I've even recently preached
[42:37] on it just taking out phrases the
[42:40] children of this world are in their
[42:41] generation wiser than the children of
[42:43] light and you can catch what Jesus is
[42:45] saying but this whole phrase where the
[42:46] Lord commended the unjust Steward
[42:48] there's a way that you can take his
[42:50] actions and maybe spin it to where his
[42:52] actions were commendable but the more
[42:54] I've studied this and wrestled with it
[42:55] in the context of Luke chapter 16 trying
[42:57] to figure out this rich man and now the
[43:00] unjust Steward he's given a name if if
[43:03] it's Devas maybe this and if there's a
[43:05] Justice this is unjustice
[43:07] and he is acting in a way that is
[43:10] ripping his boss off now whether or not
[43:12] the boss realized that the 80 came from
[43:15] the guy with the wheat and the 50 came
[43:16] from the guy with oil or it was reversed
[43:18] to where he's not he's not quite sure
[43:20] just how much was he was taken advantage
[43:22] of nevertheless it says that the Lord
[43:25] commanded the unjust St Steward because
[43:27] he had done wisely and the wisdom there
[43:29] is not the wisdom of God it's the wisdom
[43:31] of this world it's the wisdom that
[43:33] proverb says labor not to be re Rich
[43:36] cease from thine own
[43:38] wisdom in other words this Lord was
[43:42] impressed with the shrewdness of the
[43:44] unjust
[43:46] Steward I had a client one time he's
[43:48] going to be wiring I think uh you know
[43:50] $2 million into a trust account for a
[43:52] transaction and I was like I'll just
[43:54] charge a
[43:55] percentage and I did you I got paid very
[43:58] little but in this trust transaction it
[44:00] was like $20 million is initially going
[44:01] into my trust account and um and he go
[44:04] he was asking some questions about you
[44:06] know what kind of account it was and I
[44:07] used a particular one for deals like
[44:09] this uh and and so and and I said well
[44:12] and I just said um he's like well why
[44:15] why aren't you using an Iola is what
[44:18] it's called and it's a it's a trust
[44:20] funds lawyers oh my goodness I'm getting
[44:23] lost in the weeds flavor town guer and
[44:26] he asked me why was using this
[44:27] particular account I said hey I'm not I
[44:29] mean it's just a secure I'm I'm doing
[44:31] this in trust and he goes oh well hey
[44:33] I'm not worried about you running off
[44:35] with it if you did I'd be
[44:36] impressed right like I'd be impressed
[44:39] man I'd be a lot of Moxy for you to run
[44:41] off a 20 million and I knew right then
[44:44] I'm glad I'm not sending him
[44:47] money right he would be impressed cuz
[44:49] he's like man the guts for this lawyer
[44:51] to run off a 20 million knowing that he
[44:53] could probably just use it to defend and
[44:55] live off of for the rest of his life
[44:57] life so anyways this is kind of how this
[45:00] guy's thinking is like man I'm why
[45:02] didn't I think of that when I was coming
[45:04] up like a Gordon gecko type like wow
[45:08] you're shrewd you're slick like you
[45:10] figured it out man you you took
[45:12] advantage of these guys so he was
[45:14] impressed with his
[45:16] shrewdness but at the end of the day
[45:18] unjustice acted selfishly and he acted
[45:22] for his own
[45:24] interest everything he did was
[45:26] self-serving he'd been called out by for
[45:28] fraud and instead of apologizing for
[45:30] defrauding his master he doubles down on
[45:32] the fraud and continues to defraud his
[45:34] master for his own benefit by offering a
[45:36] deal to those that owned his dtor or his
[45:39] his
[45:40] master same attitude we take sometimes
[45:43] to our employers they're rich they'll
[45:44] never notice and and sometimes it
[45:46] horrifies me the attitudes that some
[45:47] employees have to their business a you
[45:49] can take it I don't care like um you
[45:51] didn't charge me for that $99 you know
[45:53] electronic part I'm like n it's okay you
[45:56] can keep it I'm like
[45:57] I don't know about that is your last
[45:59] name Best
[46:01] Buy right it's just one of those things
[46:04] you're like N I don't know that you're
[46:06] really are you allowed hey
[46:08] manager is he authorized to make this
[46:10] call right you want to be honest and
[46:13] upright and here he was doing this going
[46:15] these guys and he's making these deals
[46:17] and he's self-serving he's
[46:19] self-protective I cannot dig I'm not
[46:21] willing to work hard I'm not going to go
[46:23] get a hardworking job and I'm ashamed
[46:25] but I will cheat my my Lord to gain the
[46:28] favor favor of
[46:32] others notice he served neither his
[46:34] master nor his master's debtors he
[46:37] served
[46:38] himself and Jesus says he was unfaithful
[46:41] and we think oh who is the unfaithful
[46:43] too the debtors was he unfaithful to his
[46:45] master he's
[46:46] Unfaithful so Jesus now wants to bring
[46:49] this
[46:50] to a a relevant lesson now do you see
[46:54] how this attaches to The Story of
[46:55] Lazarus very very well and I say unto
[46:58] you verse 9 make to yourselves Friends
[47:00] of the mment of unrighteousness that
[47:02] when ye fail they may receive you into
[47:05] Everlasting
[47:09] habitations what an interesting
[47:10] statement especially when you find later
[47:12] on when he gives the
[47:14] parable and it's almost as if did he
[47:16] have this queued up I mean did he
[47:18] know like he has this repository of
[47:20] Parables like based upon their response
[47:23] let go over here Lazarus rich man got it
[47:25] here because it fits perfectly here
[47:26] telling his parable about this man being
[47:29] received into Everlasting he's saying
[47:30] about you know make yourself Friends of
[47:32] the Mammon of unrighteousness when he
[47:33] says that it's worldly things worldly
[47:35] riches people of this world that when
[47:37] you die they may receive you into
[47:39] Everlasting habitations and then just in
[47:41] a moment he's going to be telling a
[47:42] parable about one man being in received
[47:44] into Everlasting habitations and another
[47:46] one being in hell and torments he says
[47:48] he that is faithful and that which is
[47:50] least is faithful also in much the
[47:54] unrighteous Mamon is the least it's not
[47:58] even what determines whether or not
[48:00] we're
[48:00] rich and so if we are not faithful in
[48:04] unrighteous
[48:06] things it's what then how can we be
[48:08] faithful in the things that really count
[48:09] or really
[48:11] matter if if you're if you're miserable
[48:13] wretches towards one another right if
[48:16] you're selfish and self-serving if
[48:17] you're dishonest if you're always
[48:19] fighting and always cheating if you
[48:21] can't handle this life which is the
[48:25] least how can you handle
[48:27] eternal
[48:29] life he that is faithful and that which
[48:31] is least is faithful also in much and he
[48:32] that is unjust in the least is unjust
[48:35] also in much if therefore you have not
[48:37] been faithful in the unrighteous Mammon
[48:40] who will commit to your trust the true
[48:42] riches I believe that God wants to
[48:44] commit to us the true riches which are
[48:47] himself which is revelation which is
[48:48] favor and his Blessing but there's this
[48:50] certain uh barometer now where he saying
[48:52] how can I bless you with the greater
[48:54] spiritual things when you are knowingly
[48:57] Reckless about natural
[49:00] things and if you have not been faithful
[49:02] in that which is another man's who shall
[49:05] give you that which is your
[49:07] own in other words we are stand as joint
[49:10] heirs and to inherit a possession in God
[49:12] which is our very very own but how can
[49:14] you how can you then be found faithful
[49:17] if you can't even manage the things that
[49:18] have been given you even naturally so he
[49:21] brings it to this head and this is what
[49:23] caused the Pharisees to be so upset
[49:25] because they were Covetous and they
[49:26] derided him and ridiculed him he says no
[49:28] man can serve two masters for either
[49:30] he'll hate the one and love the other or
[49:33] else he'll hold to the one and despise
[49:34] the other you cannot serve God and th
[49:36] this other Master
[49:39] Mammon and if I could even if I could
[49:42] use
[49:43] this you cannot serve God and serve
[49:49] yourself because let's just be honest
[49:52] this serving Mammon is not altruistic
[49:54] I'm just I'm just working hard man and
[49:56] so that the world can just get richer I
[49:59] mean I just I'm doing this I know I'm
[50:01] going to get fired so I'm just going to
[50:02] go and work hard like I should have and
[50:05] I'm going to give some of my own savings
[50:06] get some of my 401k back and I'm going
[50:08] to give I'm going to just forego some of
[50:10] my vacation and I'm going to work really
[50:12] really hard once I get a new job digging
[50:13] ditches and I'm going to pay the master
[50:15] back for everything I stole from
[50:17] him like the people who say that you I'm
[50:20] going to declare bankruptcy and I'm
[50:21] going to get my debts wiped out but I'm
[50:22] going to keep track cuz one day I'm
[50:23] going to go back and pay them
[50:25] all anybody know any Christian that's
[50:27] ever done that I'm just curious I'm not
[50:29] saying I'm not trying to call that
[50:30] attitude out necessarily but I'm just
[50:32] saying this guy does not have that
[50:35] attitude the Mamon he served was for
[50:38] himself Pharisees were the same way
[50:41] that's why it bothered them so much the
[50:42] unjust acted in his own interest and for
[50:45] his own protection against his master's
[50:48] interest against the interest of others
[50:52] so I realize I'm just going to have to
[50:53] close in here but we're all stewards
[50:57] we should all on some level find
[50:58] ourselves as a steward this man was a
[51:01] servant to a rich man there was
[51:04] this relationship where one had the
[51:06] wealth that he entrusted to somebody
[51:08] else who was to look out after it and
[51:09] manage it but yet he was wasting it in
[51:11] the end he was going to get fired so his
[51:13] final Act of courage and finally you
[51:16] know getting up and doing something was
[51:17] to further cheat his boss not to give a
[51:20] good deal and to show favor to the
[51:22] debtors but to rather Curry favor for
[51:24] himself that once he is fired by this
[51:27] master who knows what he was saying is
[51:28] like yeah I'm going to do a deal look my
[51:30] master wants to sue you he wants to
[51:32] bankrupt you he's going to go after you
[51:33] for everything you're worth but you know
[51:35] it's Memorial Day weekend I'm going to
[51:36] offer you a deal I'll cover the other 50
[51:39] it's on me you don't worry about it and
[51:41] he cuts these deals and then he gets
[51:43] fired he says yeah he fired me for
[51:44] standing up for you you know I took a
[51:46] loss and they're like oh man stay with
[51:49] me man right you're on my team now and
[51:53] you know probably they're thinking do
[51:55] you think you could do that deal with
[51:56] somebody else for me because I got a lot
[51:58] of people that owe me money or you I got
[52:00] I owe a lot of other people money maybe
[52:02] you could figure this out and you could
[52:03] go around and you could figure things
[52:04] out for me in whatever context that this
[52:06] Steward was represented we can find
[52:08] ourselves on some level from the
[52:10] youngest of us to the oldest of us a
[52:13] steward and if that seems difficult for
[52:15] us to understand and you certainly
[52:17] reject maybe or maybe you reject the
[52:18] idea that you're a steward to the
[52:19] government what it does for you or a
[52:21] steward to this employer but we are all
[52:23] stewards and everything that we have
[52:27] in terms of money are trust
[52:31] funds and everything that we have in
[52:34] terms of time is trust
[52:36] time in 1 Corinthians chapter 4: 1-2
[52:39] Paul is saying now as he took ownership
[52:41] of his stewardship of the Gospel he says
[52:43] let a man so account of us as a steward
[52:46] he's willing to be held accountable he
[52:48] was not thinking oh I've been called on
[52:49] the carpet I'm going to come up short he
[52:51] says no I know I'm going to be held
[52:53] accountable so I'm going to do as I
[52:55] ought as of the min of Christ and
[52:57] stewards of the mysteries of
[53:00] God let so man account of us I'm willing
[53:03] to be held accountable moreover it is
[53:04] required in stewards that a man be found
[53:07] faithful Paul is taking own ownership of
[53:09] his stewardship as a minister of the
[53:12] Gospel of stewardship of the Mysteries
[53:13] that have been revealed to him he is
[53:15] saying this about himself but he says
[53:17] stewards are required to be found
[53:19] faithful and all of us here are stewards
[53:22] of something we are stewards of time we
[53:25] are stewards of money we are stewards of
[53:27] the faith and belief that we have we're
[53:28] stewards of a household we're stewards
[53:30] of our spouses we're stewards of our
[53:31] children we're stewards of
[53:33] others and we are not to live in a way
[53:36] to where we're only looking out after
[53:38] ourselves but we have to look beyond our
[53:41] gate and know that there's usually a
[53:43] Lazarus at our doorstep that there's
[53:45] others that are in our lives and in our
[53:46] orbit who knows how many people Devas
[53:50] walked by not just outside his gate but
[53:52] in his own
[53:54] house his son sitting there depressed on
[53:57] his couch his daughter over there with
[53:59] an eating disorder at the table his wife
[54:01] over there pulling her hair out in the
[54:02] laundry room and just walks right past
[54:04] it right to go do his Recreation to do
[54:06] the things that helps him relax in the
[54:08] evening and is completely oblivious to
[54:10] everything else going on in the
[54:14] home the Bible says in Colossians 4:5
[54:17] walk in wisdom now this is a different
[54:21] wisdom this isn't the wisdom that
[54:23] the uh Lord commended the unjust Steward
[54:28] for walk in wisdom toward them that are
[54:32] without Redeeming the time that phrase
[54:34] Redeeming the time is amazing to think
[54:38] that there's a way to live wisely where
[54:40] you can redeem lost
[54:44] time as the phrase is slow down we don't
[54:48] have a moment to
[54:50] waste there's a way that we can redeem
[54:52] the time with the way that we live the
[54:54] way that we act the way that we serve
[54:55] walk in wisdom and it just doesn't say
[54:57] walk wisely for your own benefit walk in
[54:59] wisdom towards them who don't have
[55:01] wisdom walk wisely for the benefit of
[55:03] those who aren't wise sometimes we just
[55:05] have such arrogance about us toward it's
[55:07] like well I know and they're just
[55:10] stupid then behave yourself wisely for
[55:12] the benefit of the one that doesn't know
[55:14] better demonstrate for somebody the
[55:16] right way to handle something
[55:18] demonstrate give the right example don't
[55:20] just sit back and say well if it was me
[55:22] I'd know exactly what to do and but
[55:24] afford the right example walk in wisdom
[55:27] even if it be in the actual words walk
[55:28] in wisdom towards them that are
[55:30] without if I could say this selfishness
[55:33] is one of the most destructive forces in
[55:36] any relationship self-centeredness is
[55:38] one of the most destructive forces in
[55:40] terms of trust and
[55:42] confidence if you can't trust that
[55:44] someone else is acting in the benefit of
[55:46] others and not just themselves if you
[55:47] feel like there's always something in it
[55:49] for them that's the worst kind of Leaven
[55:51] to sew into a relationship is
[55:53] selfishness and self-centeredness
[55:58] the unjust use the rich man's
[56:00] wealth and I don't know why to me it
[56:02] almost draws it it's like this is when
[56:05] you want I wish I knew these guys names
[56:08] um I don't know what they what their
[56:10] names are but I know something like Ben
[56:12] Shapiro would argue with Barack Obama I
[56:15] don't know I don't know who these people
[56:17] are anymore but this argument of well
[56:19] you know it's the the Socialist idea
[56:22] you'd be nothing without me the pencil
[56:24] makers right you'd be nothing without me
[56:26] I'm make the pencils but then the
[56:27] argument is but the the boss is the one
[56:29] that built the plant and provided the
[56:31] resources and there's always this two
[56:33] class system and it's all going to be a
[56:34] big Civil War one day and we're going to
[56:35] see who
[56:36] wins and uh depending on who you vote
[56:39] for in
[56:42] November
[56:44] and I really regret that we never got to
[56:46] do the Christmas play that would have
[56:47] been amazing but now we have yet another
[56:50] opportunity with another election cycle
[56:52] with Trump in it
[57:00] the unjust unjustice
[57:03] used his master's wealth for his own
[57:07] benefit and his own
[57:10] protection he may have been able to
[57:12] support a Lifestyle by wasting his
[57:15] master's
[57:16] goods and now he realized that the time
[57:19] was short and he couldn't just keep
[57:20] cheating his
[57:21] master it was that gig was going to be
[57:23] up and he immediately thinks I'm not
[57:25] willing to work hard to maintain my
[57:26] lifestyle I'm not willing to dig which
[57:28] would have been one of the lowliest jobs
[57:29] that could be had he says I'm not
[57:30] willing to dig and I got too much pride
[57:33] to
[57:34] beg this is the attitude of the rich
[57:37] man and so think about how Devas looked
[57:41] down on Lazarus who begged at his
[57:46] gate this was a man that wasn't willing
[57:48] to dig and a man who's Too Proud to
[57:53] Beg it was for his own PR profit and
[57:58] protection and so what Jesus is teaching
[58:00] us is to be righteous
[58:04] stewards knowing according to 1 Timothy
[58:06] 6 that a living God has given us all
[58:09] things to
[58:10] enjoy your
[58:14] health your
[58:15] wealth your time and I'm saying it today
[58:19] to Christians there's nothing you have
[58:21] in life that God has not allowed or has
[58:24] he's if there's anything good he's given
[58:26] you things richly to enjoy and th all
[58:30] those things you're stewards of children
[58:33] are the heritage of the Lord You're a
[58:34] steward over the children he gives you a
[58:35] spouse is the greatest thing that God
[58:37] could give you outside of Salvation a
[58:38] wife that's you're a steward over that
[58:40] you begin to think about relationships
[58:42] and interactions and all these different
[58:43] things he's teaching us that we ought to
[58:45] be righteous stewards as God has given
[58:47] us all things to
[58:49] enjoy teaching us that we ought to use
[58:52] what he has made available to us not
[58:54] solely for our own benefit but for the
[58:56] benefit of
[59:03] others musicians if you'd come I just I
[59:05] need to stop not even halfway finished
[59:08] but I just I need to stop here
[59:34] in Mark chapter 8: 3 34-
[59:39] 38 and this might be just a perfect
[59:41] place to pick back up next Sunday
[59:45] morning and when he had called the
[59:47] people unto him with the disciples also
[59:48] he said unto them whosoever will come
[59:51] after
[59:52] me let him deny himself and take take up
[59:56] his cross and follow
[59:58] me for whosoever will save his life
[1:00:02] shall lose it but whosoever shall lose
[1:00:05] his life for my sake and the gospels the
[1:00:08] same shall save
[1:00:11] it what is his pronouncement take up the
[1:00:14] cross and follow me for what shall it
[1:00:16] profit a man if he shall gain the whole
[1:00:19] world and lose his own
[1:00:24] soul what shall a man give in exchange
[1:00:26] for his soul whosoever therefore shall
[1:00:30] be ashamed of me and my words in this
[1:00:33] adulterous and sinful generation of him
[1:00:35] also shall the son of man be ashamed
[1:00:37] when he cometh in the glory of his
[1:00:39] father with the Holy
[1:00:41] Angels this may seem a little bit
[1:00:43] disjointed without the context of the
[1:00:45] rest of these scriptures and quotations
[1:00:46] I wanted to share this morning but maybe
[1:00:49] just to see the the future sermon to
[1:00:51] take up the cross and
[1:00:54] follow requires be a
[1:00:57] selfless if I could just say this to
[1:01:00] take up the cross is
[1:01:04] self-denial let him deny himself and
[1:01:07] take up his
[1:01:09] cross and follow me that phrase it let
[1:01:12] him deny himself take up his cross and
[1:01:15] follow me in other words there's a
[1:01:17] pattern of behavior that Christ
[1:01:18] demonstrated there's a way that he lived
[1:01:19] a way that he uh acted we could insert
[1:01:22] into here sermon after sermon after
[1:01:24] sermon on the thought that he eternal
[1:01:26] life is living for
[1:01:29] others that if we live just to ourselves
[1:01:32] that's a selfish
[1:01:34] life so to deny myself and take up the
[1:01:37] cross and follow him that is in itself
[1:01:39] its
[1:01:41] selflessness and as we'll find out next
[1:01:45] time Devas is introduced to us in this
[1:01:50] Parable but Christ is showing us the
[1:01:53] future of a certain rich man
[1:01:57] he's already spoken in the parable then
[1:01:59] later you'll find it in Luke chapter 18
[1:02:01] Jesus is approached by a ruler a certain
[1:02:04] ruler and he is the living
[1:02:07] image of
[1:02:10] Devas the rich man it's the Rich Young
[1:02:14] Ruler and what is it that Jesus said he
[1:02:16] lacked sell all thou Hast take up your
[1:02:20] cross and follow
[1:02:24] me if if we're ever going to have a home
[1:02:28] of
[1:02:29] Honor we're going to have to start
[1:02:31] living outside of
[1:02:36] ourselves if you're rich in this world
[1:02:39] take the charge that Paul gave to
[1:02:41] Timothy to charge those that are rich in
[1:02:43] this
[1:02:44] world whatever you have been given I'll
[1:02:47] hopefully amplify this to in a much
[1:02:49] greater way in future services but use
[1:02:53] what God has given you for the benefit
[1:02:56] of others in studying some of the
[1:02:59] Parables may maybe not the parable but
[1:03:01] just the Life of Christ and the way that
[1:03:03] he handled certain situations it's it's
[1:03:06] astounding that in his moment of
[1:03:08] grieving and sorrow wherein La his
[1:03:11] friend or excuse me John the Baptist his
[1:03:14] cousin has died he's been murdered at
[1:03:16] the hands of an unjust man and he tells
[1:03:20] his disciples let's just get away and
[1:03:21] rest I believe it's Matthew that gives
[1:03:23] us the greater details to this
[1:03:26] I and let's get away and rest and the
[1:03:28] the the crowds kind of got idea that
[1:03:30] they're going out to the Wilderness to
[1:03:31] get away to rest and they hurry up and
[1:03:33] they beat him there and Jesus is wanting
[1:03:35] to get away to grieve the death of his
[1:03:37] cousin and he comes to these Shores and
[1:03:39] as he lands there I'm going on vacation
[1:03:41] we need a break we've been working so
[1:03:43] hard I need to rest and here's Christ
[1:03:45] and he sees the multitudes and when he
[1:03:48] would have been right to grieve for
[1:03:50] himself he sees the multitudes thousands
[1:03:52] upon thousands in the telling of the
[1:03:54] story 5,000 men
[1:03:56] just the men and it says he had
[1:04:01] compassion and his thought was they need
[1:04:03] to
[1:04:04] eat and you know we would say oh no no
[1:04:06] no Jesus you're on vacation man let them
[1:04:09] starve let them they're they're they're
[1:04:11] adults let them figure it out they they
[1:04:13] shouldn't that was Reckless for them to
[1:04:15] come all out here in the wilderness you
[1:04:16] know how far away the nearest Ros is
[1:04:18] that's on them to come all the way out
[1:04:21] here in the
[1:04:22] wilderness and Jesus says we need to
[1:04:24] feed him and I'm should have had all
[1:04:25] this prepared but there's kind of this
[1:04:27] argument man we're in the middle of
[1:04:28] nowhere the disciples says we are out in
[1:04:30] the middle of the barren Wilderness and
[1:04:32] you're telling us to go get food for
[1:04:34] them and we can't afford that take I
[1:04:36] think they said it takes a half a year
[1:04:37] salary to feed these
[1:04:39] people and they're asking themselves how
[1:04:42] are we ever going to feed them and Jesus
[1:04:44] instead of panicking just says well what
[1:04:46] do you
[1:04:48] have what do you have here's a need and
[1:04:50] you're already rationalized it's too
[1:04:52] great there's no way I can help oh
[1:04:53] they're trying to get books to Botswana
[1:04:55] trying to get this to this place there's
[1:04:57] all these things we're trying to do and
[1:04:58] oh there's no way there's no way we
[1:05:01] could ever help there's no way we could
[1:05:02] come up with those Millions it's like
[1:05:04] well we're not asking for you to go buy
[1:05:06] takeout for 5,000 people but the only
[1:05:09] thing you can start with is what you
[1:05:10] have what do you have and they had Five
[1:05:13] Loaves and two
[1:05:16] fish and there's some especially in the
[1:05:19] taling of Mark it's so amazing Mark
[1:05:21] doesn't say anything other than that
[1:05:23] Jesus took it and blessed it and the
[1:05:24] next thing we know they had enough
[1:05:26] leftovers to fill 12
[1:05:29] baskets and Mark leaves out the
[1:05:32] miraculous in how that there was the
[1:05:34] bread was multiplied and the fish was
[1:05:36] multiplied suggesting that there was
[1:05:39] something and I don't think he suggested
[1:05:41] it but leaving it silent it's look by
[1:05:43] asking the disciples what they had and
[1:05:44] being willing to offer what they had
[1:05:47] they as they gave God made it go
[1:05:51] further and that God you all you could
[1:05:53] do is be responsible for what he's given
[1:05:55] you well they said they need a million
[1:05:57] dollarss well you don't have any money
[1:05:58] at all what can you give what is that in
[1:06:01] your hand what is it you have to offer
[1:06:03] are you willing to give even what you
[1:06:07] have even to think that as the story is
[1:06:09] told ad Divas could have just brushed
[1:06:12] his hands off as he
[1:06:15] left he's got a Carolina's green chili
[1:06:17] breakfast burrito and he could just
[1:06:19] shakeing a little bit out as he walked
[1:06:20] by there was he could have done
[1:06:22] something for Lazarus and then in the
[1:06:24] end he said oh just let me have a drop
[1:06:26] of
[1:06:26] water I do think it's
[1:06:29] challenging I really do think it's
[1:06:31] challenging and God saying what is it
[1:06:33] that you have that you can
[1:06:35] offer and there is this sense in
[1:06:38] scripture to where gluttony is this
[1:06:40] excessiveness where one consumes and
[1:06:43] hoardes more than is necessary and the
[1:06:46] sin of gluttony is not necessarily just
[1:06:48] in eating alone and that doesn't absolve
[1:06:50] us who struggle with that but it it kind
[1:06:52] of maybe brings us into more fellowship
[1:06:54] with others who are gluttonous with
[1:06:55] other things they don't know when to
[1:06:57] stop and when to preserve or give or
[1:07:00] share and let others have they hoard
[1:07:02] everything for themselves and if
[1:07:04] anything Jesus is really attacking this
[1:07:06] selfish self-centered mindset of the
[1:07:08] rich man who only lived to
[1:07:12] himself and that's why in the end he
[1:07:14] really was
[1:07:18] poor in the end that's
[1:07:21] why he would only ever have what he made
[1:07:27] [Music]
[1:07:30] but the blessings of the Lord maketh
[1:07:33] rich and he addeth no sorrow to it could
[1:07:36] you stand with me as we pray today
