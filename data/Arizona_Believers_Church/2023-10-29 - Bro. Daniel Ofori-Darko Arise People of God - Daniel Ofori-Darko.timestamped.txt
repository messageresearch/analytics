[0:00] on this topic arise people of
[0:04] God Arise people of
[0:08] God we know that
[0:10] creation of this world remain it a
[0:15] mystery hallelujah how many of you
[0:18] believe that oh yes it's a
[0:21] mystery it's a mystery in the sense
[0:24] that here we are now I think the time is
[0:28] a little after 10:00 is
[0:30] but when you go to Africa right
[0:35] now it's getting to the
[0:39] evening and when you go to
[0:42] Australia you can
[0:43] imagine the time that they are in now so
[0:48] it happens that whil some are sleeping
[0:50] and
[0:51] snoring others are
[0:53] working when others are sleeping others
[0:56] are eating you know and you cannot
[0:58] determine how God was able to do it that
[1:02] way so it remains mystery Hallelujah and
[1:07] uh he gave the day for us to work and he
[1:11] gave the night for us to sleep amen so
[1:15] therefore sleeping is normal is that not
[1:17] it sleeping is
[1:21] normal and everybody love to
[1:25] sleep in fact when when you are you are
[1:29] feeling sleep sleeping
[1:30] sometime and uh at the same time you are
[1:33] trying to do something is not
[1:36] comfortable at all is that it yeah you
[1:39] you realize that you are torturing
[1:42] yourself until you you've been working
[1:45] and you'll be dozing off which is very
[1:50] dangerous amen there are some medication
[1:52] even the doctors will give you will give
[1:55] to you sometime and they will tell you
[1:56] that when you take it don't
[1:58] drive because if you dare take it and
[2:01] you drive you may wreck your
[2:03] car because you you be you do off
[2:07] Hallelujah so so sleeping is normal but
[2:10] there is time for
[2:12] everything amen you sleep and you wake
[2:15] up that is why sometime when we we need
[2:18] time to do something we have to set our
[2:20] alarms well so that when the time comes
[2:22] it will you know awake us
[2:25] automatically even your time your your
[2:27] alarm don't want you to sleep
[2:32] your your alarm don't want you to sleep
[2:34] so that is why it will wake you up and
[2:37] get you
[2:38] up sleeping is noral as I've already
[2:41] said but oversleeping is what not is
[2:46] good amen over sleeping is what is not
[2:50] good but sleeping God added it to human
[2:55] nature amen so you see we have the
[2:59] physical sleeping and we have spiritual
[3:04] sleeping okay now
[3:07] Isaiah was not calling
[3:10] us to wake up
[3:14] physically but he was calling us to wake
[3:16] up
[3:18] spiritually you see when you are
[3:22] sleeping physically on naturally there's
[3:25] nothing wrong right but when you are
[3:28] sleeping spiritually
[3:30] that is where the danger
[3:32] is amen and
[3:35] amen so this morning I don't want to see
[3:37] anybody sleeping in the
[3:39] church
[3:41] right because he is calling us to rise
[3:46] from our sleep and when the prophet or
[3:49] when the word of God is calling you to
[3:51] rise it is calling you into a Revival
[3:55] yes because nobody will be in a Revival
[3:58] and be dozing of no
[4:00] is it's impossible a soldier who is
[4:04] ready for battle do you think he will
[4:06] feel Slumber no no no no no no no he
[4:08] will not and so that is what the prophet
[4:11] Isaiah was calling the people of God to
[4:14] be
[4:16] amen now look at it this way he say
[4:20] awake awake put on thy strength oh Zion
[4:25] and the prophet said that any place that
[4:26] you read in the Bible put yourself in
[4:28] there so now he not talking to Zion but
[4:32] he's talking to you and
[4:34] I Hallelujah he said put on thy
[4:36] beautiful garment oh Jerusalem the holy
[4:40] city for henceforth there shall no more
[4:43] come into Thee the uncircumcised and the
[4:46] unclean and remember that the uncircum
[4:48] the uncircumcised and unclean is the
[4:50] Antichrist
[4:52] okay he said Shake thyself from the dust
[4:56] arise and sit down Shake sh yourself
[5:00] from the dust what is the dust that the
[5:02] prophet is talking about the Dust of
[5:05] unbelief yeah
[5:07] right the dust of
[5:10] worldliness the dust of Doubt of God's
[5:14] word hallelujah the dust of the things
[5:18] the idea of human being that always take
[5:21] the word of God completely from the
[5:23] people it say shake yourself from that
[5:27] dust Hallelujah and sit down oh
[5:31] Jerusalem lose thyself from the bands of
[5:35] thy neck oh captive Daughter of Zion for
[5:39] thus sayeth the Lord ye have sold
[5:42] yourself for nothing and ye shall be
[5:45] redeem without
[5:48] money we sold ourselves to the taals of
[5:52] the world because David said in sin did
[5:58] my mother conceive to me
[6:03] I was Sheed in
[6:05] iniquity there was nothing good in
[6:08] me so automatically I was born into this
[6:12] world a
[6:17] sinner
[6:18] Hallelujah we sold
[6:21] ourselves for
[6:24] nothing and brother sister you agree
[6:26] with me that anything that the devil use
[6:28] man to
[6:31] accomplish you don't gain anything out
[6:33] of
[6:37] it prepare you for
[6:41] punishment anything the devil uses us or
[6:45] anything the devil used Us in the world
[6:47] to do we benefited nothing so that is
[6:51] why the prophet is saying that we sold
[6:53] ourselves for nothing but we have been
[6:56] redeemed without money amen oh brother
[6:59] brother our Salvation we didn't pay any
[7:02] dollar for
[7:04] it our Salvation we didn't exchange
[7:07] anything for
[7:08] it Hallelujah we were Redeemed by the
[7:11] blood of Jesus Christ free of
[7:16] charge amen last Sunday we were saying
[7:18] that he knew us before the foundation of
[7:21] the world and for that matter he had
[7:23] already prepared our Salvation it is not
[7:27] that today that God is thinking how he
[7:29] is going to save you he had already done
[7:32] that
[7:33] already praise be the name of our God so
[7:37] we are redeemed without money
[7:42] Hallelujah now we know that Redemption
[7:46] was under the
[7:47] seals in
[7:49] fact we were born into so many churches
[7:52] so many
[7:54] denominations we were even baptized we
[7:57] grew up as Christians so
[8:00] called and we were attending church you
[8:04] know regularly until we we thought that
[8:08] oh we were close to heaven right we
[8:11] thought that if Jesus Christ came today
[8:14] we are going to go with him we didn't
[8:17] know that we have were born into error
[8:20] right until we came face to face with
[8:23] the message of this
[8:25] hour and what is the message of the hour
[8:29] the message of our is not just as what
[8:32] you see but there was a mystery that was
[8:36] hidden before the foundation of the
[8:39] world and God's word says that when the
[8:43] seven angels begin to sound those
[8:46] Mysteries that was Kept Secret will be
[8:49] made known that's right and brother when
[8:53] we came face to face with that that is
[8:56] what made us to realize what
[8:59] Christianity is
[9:01] about had it not been the Revelation
[9:04] that you and us you and I have brother
[9:07] would have remained over there at the
[9:09] other side amen so we see that
[9:12] Redemption was under the seals and the
[9:14] bible say that the uncircumcised will no
[9:17] longer come and run it yes because now
[9:19] you have the
[9:21] truth now you know who Jesus is nobody
[9:23] can Chop God into three pieces and give
[9:25] it to you you will not accept that it
[9:28] was a mystery
[9:29] until today it still remain a mystery in
[9:32] the minds of people in the heart of
[9:34] people they don't even know the god that
[9:36] they are
[9:37] worshiping they're still thinking that
[9:39] God is an old man sitting somewhere and
[9:41] his son Jesus Christ on his right hand
[9:43] and the Holy Ghost also moving
[9:45] somewhere that is what people are
[9:47] believing it is a mystery brother sister
[9:50] for you to know the God that you are
[9:52] worshiping and thank God when the seals
[9:55] were open you and I we have come to the
[9:57] knowledge of the truth
[10:01] amen and he said when it happen like
[10:04] this the circumstance will no longer
[10:07] come around that because your faith is
[10:12] sealed
[10:14] amen with the truth and when you have
[10:17] that truth it is very difficult for you
[10:21] to be
[10:22] deceived no way nothing can deceive you
[10:26] again nothing can turn you your because
[10:28] you eyes are now open to the truth
[10:33] hallelujah amen amen and amen and he
[10:35] said the Antichrist will no longer come
[10:38] around you the world system we believe
[10:40] that was injected into the church to
[10:42] defile her and somebody may think that
[10:46] oh it was it was after the apostles No
[10:50] it started in the garden of
[10:52] aeden that is the thing that the devil
[10:55] always does the devil cannot change the
[10:58] word of God God but the devil can cause
[11:01] you to disbelieve the word of
[11:03] God that is why he either add something
[11:07] to it or he will take a portion out of
[11:09] it and that is what he did in the Garden
[11:12] of Eden to defile the human race right
[11:15] and in this end time Satan is still
[11:18] doing that right Hallelujah and by so
[11:21] doing he's he has managed to sway a lot
[11:24] of people into error right but there is
[11:28] something that I to share with you which
[11:30] is in the Bible Jesus said that the
[11:34] elect cannot be
[11:35] deceived and so if you are part of the
[11:38] elect I am assuring you this morning
[11:40] that nothing can shake your faith amen
[11:44] amen I love the song that the family
[11:46] sang he say I have made my mind up to go
[11:50] God's way Hallelujah and that is what we
[11:54] have done after the seals were open and
[11:57] we know whom God is we know what we are
[12:00] worshiping we know the promises of God
[12:03] that nobody can take it from our hands
[12:05] we made our minds
[12:07] up to go God's
[12:10] way
[12:12] Hallelujah you know when people allow
[12:16] themselves to be swayed by the
[12:18] enemy when the people allow themselves
[12:21] to be influenced by the enemy and they
[12:24] didn't believe God's word in their time
[12:28] they all all died and they went to
[12:31] hell but you see what the love of God
[12:34] is the bible say that when Christ died
[12:38] on the
[12:39] cross he went to preach to the souls
[12:42] that were in
[12:44] prison he went to cause an Awakening
[12:47] over there because by that time the
[12:51] blood of Jesus Christ had never yet been
[12:53] shared so Believers and you know
[12:56] unbelievers all of them died and they go
[12:59] to the same place right but when Christ
[13:02] came down to
[13:05] accomplish the purpose of God for you
[13:08] and I our Salvation before the
[13:10] foundation of the world and he show it
[13:13] openly on Mount
[13:15] Calvary and he screamed that it is
[13:17] finished and he gave up the ghost the
[13:20] bible say that he went to the region of
[13:22] the lost to preach the gospel there to
[13:25] bring his people
[13:27] out and you imagine do you know what
[13:29] happened there that day in hell when
[13:32] Christ entered over there and the people
[13:35] were all there all the people that has
[13:39] gone by they were all
[13:42] there but there was something that
[13:49] happened
[13:52] everybody that God dealt with it was
[13:56] time for their salvation right any
[14:00] person that believe on God that was at
[14:03] the place it was time for them to come
[14:05] out right so Jesus went there to cause
[14:09] an
[14:09] Awakening they were all sleeping in hell
[14:12] and Jesus said that this is not the time
[14:14] of be here it's time of getting out from
[14:20] here and so he called his
[14:25] people call them one by one he mentioned
[14:29] their names one by one this one will say
[14:32] yes I can recognize this this
[14:35] Voice Hallelujah Jesus look at Abraham
[14:39] he said Abraham come on come over here
[14:41] this is not your
[14:43] place he look to Isaac he said Isaac
[14:45] this is not your place come over here
[14:47] come and follow me
[14:49] Hallelujah and they were following him
[14:51] little by he was calling them
[14:55] all
[14:57] amen he will see Daniel and Daniel will
[14:59] look at his face he will mention Daniel
[15:01] Daniel said no this is the man that I
[15:03] met over there when they thre me into
[15:05] the lion Z the angel that came to to to
[15:09] to I mean to close the mouth of the
[15:11] Lions this is the man oh praise be the
[15:15] name of our God and so the Bible says
[15:18] that when he was
[15:20] resurrecting that day he resurrected
[15:24] with all these
[15:25] people he brought them out from
[15:29] hell why because that place was not
[15:32] prepared for them hell was prepared for
[15:35] Satan and his followers not the people
[15:38] of God so God brought his people
[15:41] out so if you read the account carefully
[15:44] he said the day of Resurrection they saw
[15:47] the Old Saint also resurrected and they
[15:51] walk on the street of
[15:52] Jerusalem the day of Resurrection
[15:55] hallelujah how much more we are that are
[15:58] living today yes we must also be
[16:01] resurrected yes from our unbelief yes we
[16:06] must be resurrected from our doubt we
[16:09] must be resurrected from the things that
[16:11] goes contrary so long as God's word is
[16:13] concerned because God have prepared a
[16:16] place for us amen he said
[16:19] arise and Shake yourself from the dust
[16:24] arise and Shake Yourself from
[16:26] unbelief arise and Shake yourself from
[16:29] the sin of this world and
[16:32] sit sit where you sit in the word of
[16:36] God you sit on the revelation of God but
[16:40] when you sit with the word of God
[16:42] brother storm make wind May blow storm
[16:46] may blow but your Anchor Holds within
[16:49] the veil there is nothing that can shake
[16:52] your faith because you are sitting on
[16:56] the word of God Hallelujah there must be
[17:00] an Awakening in you brother sister if
[17:03] there is nothing like that then you must
[17:06] think
[17:08] again something must Shake any unbelief
[17:11] out something must keep you on fire
[17:16] something should make you arise from
[17:18] your sleeping and your Slumber right
[17:21] because it is time of preparation of
[17:25] meeting the Lord God our Lord Jesus
[17:27] Christ
[17:30] amen and amen one time when Mary
[17:34] Magdalene when that woman met Jesus
[17:37] Christ the prophet said that there were
[17:39] about nine or seven demons in that
[17:42] woman but when she came face to face
[17:45] with Jesus Christ something happened to
[17:47] her there was an Awakening That Shook
[17:50] all those demons out Hallelujah and
[17:53] today if we come face to face with Jesus
[17:55] Christ that same thing can happen to us
[17:57] amen it may not be demons but it may be
[18:00] something that is taking our
[18:02] concentrations
[18:03] away and when we meet Jesus Christ
[18:06] brother everything must be
[18:09] settled Hallelujah one time when Peter
[18:13] and the rest were at the
[18:15] shore remember that Jesus Christ went
[18:18] there and Jesus pleaded with Peter he
[18:22] said Peter will I will you let me use
[18:24] your canoon for a moment he said why not
[18:27] go ahead and Jesus climbed it and he
[18:31] started preaching to the
[18:33] people he preached the word of life to
[18:36] the
[18:37] people they
[18:39] rejoiced now after Jesus didn't call for
[18:43] any other call but rather he told Peter
[18:46] he said Peter now go a little further
[18:49] and cast your net now who told Jesus
[18:53] Christ that Peter was looking for
[18:56] fish who told Jesus that Peter have come
[19:00] all the place that previous night and
[19:02] they didn't catch anything so he by thec
[19:05] he said you go a little further and cast
[19:08] your net there and Peter said
[19:12] Lord throughout the
[19:14] night we've come all the place we didn't
[19:17] catch a thing right but according to
[19:21] your
[19:22] word oh Hallelujah let it always be
[19:26] according to your word that's right and
[19:29] when he went and threw the cast The Net
[19:32] over there brother you know the story he
[19:35] has to call for his brothers to come and
[19:38] help them pull the net because they had
[19:42] abundant of fish over
[19:45] there it was
[19:47] amazing it was just Jesus Christ was
[19:51] just letting Peter know that there is a
[19:54] way that you can cause an Awakening in
[19:57] yourself
[19:58] yes Peter look at Jesus said Master
[20:01] depart from me depart from me I am a
[20:05] sinner this thing that you have done
[20:07] tells me something depart from me I
[20:10] don't want to defile you Jesus said
[20:12] don't be afraid from now on you not be
[20:16] fishes you not cat fish again but you be
[20:18] fishes of
[20:20] men and from that day Peter started his
[20:25] missionary work by going to place
[20:29] preaching to people and all over the
[20:31] place believing people coming all over
[20:34] the place to believe Jesus Christ
[20:36] brother sister perhaps today's you and I
[20:39] our
[20:40] 10 we have to allow something to happen
[20:43] to us we must have some
[20:46] experience in fact we have to feel that
[20:50] God have a work for us to do by going
[20:54] out telling people about the coming of
[20:56] the Lord Jesus Christ look the prophet
[20:59] said something and sometime we take it
[21:02] light he said if the last bright member
[21:06] don't come to believe the message the
[21:08] Rapture will still be
[21:12] waiting have you ever heard that before
[21:14] he said if the last bright member don't
[21:17] come into the fold the Rapture will not
[21:21] go because we are not going to leave any
[21:23] child of God here hallelujah brother
[21:27] sister so what about but if the last
[21:29] bride member is hiding somewhere in
[21:33] finish and we are not going out we are
[21:37] not inviting we are not persuading the
[21:39] people we are not telling the people
[21:41] about Jesus Christ how are we going to
[21:43] come how is going to be that the Rapture
[21:46] will take place the last bride member is
[21:49] hiding in finish here I may not know you
[21:52] may not know that is why all over the
[21:55] place we have to cast the net like how
[21:58] how Peter cast it let us cast the net
[22:00] like how Peter cast it and let us pull
[22:03] when we pull though it will bring
[22:06] abundant of fish but the Lord God knows
[22:08] how to do the
[22:10] selection we don't do selection but he
[22:14] himself does The Selection our duty is
[22:16] to cast the net and pull the fish amen
[22:20] and
[22:21] amen let me read something quickly from
[22:24] this message he said discernment okay
[22:28] Discerning body of the Lord he said we
[22:31] can't discern by what people
[22:34] think what intellectuals tell us what
[22:38] Psychiatry tells us he said we got to go
[22:42] by what God
[22:44] says he said man shall not live by bread
[22:47] alone but by every word that proceeded
[22:50] out of the mouth of
[22:52] God hallelujah that is what the
[22:56] instruction is we should not leave by
[22:58] bread alone no no not by Pizza not by
[23:02] hamburger alone Hallelujah not by
[23:05] sandwich
[23:08] alone B by the word of God
[23:12] right every time every day in our lives
[23:15] we must feed on God's word
[23:18] amen he says not Discerning the Lost
[23:22] body many are weakly and sick many are
[23:24] asleep dead spiritually dead he said the
[23:28] last plague that hit Egypt was death and
[23:31] the last plague that hit the church he
[23:34] said the last plague that that hit the
[23:37] church is spiritual death what we need
[23:40] today is a spiritual awakening
[23:44] Hallelujah A Spiritual Awakening to what
[23:47] discernment yes amen we ought to be able
[23:49] to descend the two spirits that are
[23:51] awaking now am the spirit of deception
[23:56] and the spirit of the Lord God which of
[23:58] course leaders into all truth amen and
[24:01] amen you see when you become idle okay
[24:06] you automatically do
[24:09] off yes when you become Idol you will
[24:13] automatically do
[24:16] off that is the reason why we must
[24:20] always make sure that we are sharing our
[24:23] Cutlas I don't know what the Cutlas you
[24:26] have do you you know what Atlas is yes
[24:30] sword that's
[24:31] right what
[24:33] good will it do you when you have a
[24:37] sword that is not sharp
[24:40] right what good will it
[24:43] do that is why well I will use home
[24:47] experience I don't know of America
[24:49] America when you are farming you do you
[24:52] use mechan mechanized f is that we use
[24:56] Manpower
[24:58] and every farmer has a
[25:01] Cass and there is a stone okay that they
[25:05] Shar their knives on not not machine no
[25:10] but Stone yeah and remember that stone
[25:12] represent
[25:14] Revelation so they sharp every time they
[25:17] sharp it always they make sure that it
[25:19] is very sharp and no farmer will go to
[25:22] the bush without a sharpen
[25:24] Cutlass and when not bringing into our
[25:27] our spiritual way we have also source
[25:31] which is the word of God in our heart
[25:33] and always we must make sure that it is
[25:36] sharpened that when we take it it cut
[25:39] both here and both here because when it
[25:41] become idle it will be dead
[25:45] Hallelujah that is the reason why look
[25:48] when this brothers cleopas and his
[25:51] friend
[25:52] remember after the resurrection of Jesus
[25:55] Christ you remember that they were
[25:58] doubting about the resurrection can we
[26:01] imagine brother sister Jesus Christ that
[26:05] walked with this people he fed them with
[26:08] so many good things he gave them power
[26:11] to even overcome evil spirits they came
[26:15] back with testimonies and the Lord was
[26:18] rejoicing with them and even told them
[26:20] that don't Rejoice that demons are made
[26:22] subject to you but Rejoice because your
[26:24] names are written in heaven amen and he
[26:27] told them about his death his burial and
[26:30] resurrection that the third day he will
[26:33] rise
[26:34] again now these people were in the
[26:37] church they had all this Jesus told them
[26:41] but just three days they forgot about
[26:45] that right so that means they were in a
[26:48] church their assault were
[26:53] dead we don't have to be in that
[26:56] experience we have to make make sure
[26:58] that our our Cutlas or our sword is
[27:01] always
[27:02] sharpened very sharp of course ready to
[27:05] cut both here and
[27:07] there and the Bible says that when the
[27:11] woman went to the supper and they found
[27:13] out that the the tomb was empty they
[27:16] came back with they knew that the Lord
[27:19] is risen Buton they said the Lord is
[27:21] risen but the disciples doubted
[27:25] it why would they doubt it because
[27:28] spiritually they were sleeping yeah am
[27:35] and they argue among
[27:37] themselves some were doubting some were
[27:41] asking questions they didn't know what
[27:43] to do whether to accept what the women
[27:45] were telling them or
[27:47] not
[27:49] until cleopas and his friend decided to
[27:52] go back to where they came from and the
[27:55] Bible says that when they were going by
[27:57] the way
[27:59] they were contemplating they were
[28:00] discussing about this thing that has
[28:03] happened then all of a
[28:05] sudden Jesus walked with
[28:09] them actually they were talking about
[28:12] Jesus Christ
[28:14] right and you know the good part of it
[28:17] is that when you talk about Jesus Christ
[28:19] every place Jesus will walk with you
[28:23] right it is better brother sister to
[28:26] talk about Jesus Christ
[28:28] in your homes in your schools at your
[28:30] work places that you talk about this
[28:33] things that is going on in this
[28:36] world when when cleopas and his friend
[28:39] was talking about Jesus immediately
[28:41] Christ walked with them and Christ ask
[28:43] them a question what are you thinking
[28:45] about what are you discussing and you
[28:47] look so
[28:50] sorrowful and they asked Jesus are you a
[28:52] stranger in this
[28:53] land can you imagine this sharp question
[28:56] they asked Jesus
[28:57] are you a stranger in
[28:59] fin that you don't know what has
[29:01] happened this last three days well
[29:03] there's a man that called Jesus Christ
[29:05] they didn't even say that our Master
[29:07] they said there a man called
[29:10] Jesus who who have done so many
[29:13] tremendous Miracles and we are you know
[29:16] testimony of those things but he died
[29:19] and well he was
[29:22] buried and some of our company have come
[29:25] to tell us that he
[29:28] risen and that is why we are so confused
[29:31] and we don't know what to
[29:32] do Jesus Christ look at them and say you
[29:35] are
[29:38] fools because they were
[29:41] sleeping they were spiritually
[29:43] sleeping he look at them and say you are
[29:45] fools and the bible say that then Jesus
[29:48] Christ took the word from them and now
[29:51] begin to explain to them he preached to
[29:54] them he told them about himself and what
[29:56] will happen to him and all that he told
[29:59] them at
[30:01] first the Bible says that whilst he was
[30:05] talking there was something that was
[30:07] dropping in your
[30:09] heart but their eyes were still holding
[30:13] that they will know him right so when
[30:16] they got to the
[30:18] village where they were going Jesus
[30:21] Christ told them well if you are coming
[30:24] to finish I am going to continue to flax
[30:26] house
[30:29] they said no master don't go it is night
[30:32] it's late there is Danger on the way
[30:36] come and pass the night with us so that
[30:39] in the morning you can continue your
[30:41] journey and Jesus
[30:44] oblig you know what happened when they
[30:47] went in to the
[30:49] house food was
[30:51] ready and you know that every man like
[30:55] food Every Woman like food every child
[31:00] like food because food was made for
[31:05] man after all the day walking from
[31:09] Jerusalem to that Village they were
[31:12] hungry so when the food was ready they
[31:15] were so
[31:16] happy and they invited Jesus Christ to
[31:19] bless the food yes a stranger that you
[31:22] didn't know yeah how come that they will
[31:25] invite Jesus to bless the food
[31:28] yes because of what came out from him
[31:31] they realize that this man is not an
[31:34] ordinary man so if he bless our food
[31:37] we'll be blessed and the bible say that
[31:39] then Jesus Christ took the food and
[31:43] bless it the old way as he used to do
[31:47] when he was with
[31:49] them and when they said amen their eyes
[31:53] were open yes to know that this is the
[31:56] master and then he vanished from among
[31:59] them amen but brother
[32:03] sister this were the same people who
[32:06] were telling Jesus Christ few minutes
[32:09] ago that it was
[32:11] late that it should not go on the
[32:14] journey but when their eyes were open
[32:18] the Bible says that they forgot about
[32:21] the dangers on the road at that night
[32:23] and they ran back to
[32:25] Jerusalem Hallelujah what was that there
[32:28] was an Awakening that has set into their
[32:30] system Hallelujah when you come face to
[32:33] face with Jesus Christ brother you
[32:34] cannot remain the same something must
[32:37] happen to you you must got an experience
[32:40] you cannot see the same way you must
[32:43] Shake yourself from the dust and they
[32:45] ran from that Village back to
[32:49] Jerusalem and they told the disciples
[32:52] hey it is
[32:53] true the master is indeed resen and he
[32:57] has appeared to us oh brother sister
[33:01] will you make that experience come into
[33:04] your
[33:05] life that you not be so much touchy you

[33:51] that is left is in the Bride of Jesus
[33:54] Christ and you are part of the bride and
[33:56] I'm part out of it so when we are
[33:58] talking about Revival we are talking
[34:00] about the bride's
[34:02] Revival that is why nothing shakes us am
[34:08] that is why our faith is
[34:11] holding that is why we cannot doubt the
[34:14] revelation of the word amen because we
[34:18] have shaken ourself from unbelief amen

[35:54] into you amen that is our power that is
[35:57] our strength amen and the prophet said

[36:38] ceased he said we see it
[36:41] everywhere the last great move the
[36:43] message has gone forth everything is
[36:46] ready now
[36:48] waiting the church is sealed away the
[36:51] wicked are doing more wicked churches
[36:55] are becoming more churchy

[37:48] 1963 when the seals were open
[37:51] my I don't know whether you have caught
[37:53] that experience before he said when
[37:55] there's mystery were being open to him
[37:58] he will shout he will scream and
[38:01] sometime he wonder whether it will not
[38:03] disturb the neighbors around right right

[38:09] hour is a message of fire am it's a
[38:13] message of fire amen it is Jesus Christ
[38:16] himself that reveal himself listen he
[38:20] said he owned my body that's what the
[38:22] prophet said he say Jesus owned my body
[38:25] and he entered into my body to do his
[38:28] perfect work so this ministry that we
[38:31] are holding on is the ministry of Jesus
[38:33] Christ
[38:34] himself
[38:36] brother what what what kind of people we
[38:39] ought to be we have to Rejoice always we
[38:42] have to give thanks to God always for
[38:44] what he has made us to be it is not
[38:46] something that we went to school to
[38:47] learn
[38:48] no no no no University can produce this
[38:54] right no Seminary can give us the holy
[38:56] SP Spirit but the message the word of
[39:00] God that is
[39:01] revealed that is what has made us what
[39:03] we are
[39:04] today amen and
[39:06] amen amen and amen
[39:11] now he says
[39:15] remember
[39:17] remember God was in the
[39:21] boat God was in the
[39:24] storm and God was in the fish
[39:28] how do you calculate
[39:31] that let me repeat it he said God was in
[39:34] the
[39:35] storm God was in the
[39:39] fish and God was in the
[39:42] boat I hope you've got the answer
[39:45] now it's in the
[39:47] Bible Hallelujah you remember when God
[39:52] called uh what's the man's name Jonah
[39:56] yeah Jonah go to nineve and go and
[40:00] proclaim the go Elizabeth you remember
[40:03] that Jonah said
[40:06] what for what God you want me go to n no
[40:11] I'll not go to n I'm not ready to go to
[40:15] n a
[40:17] man having his own will yeah instead of
[40:21] being a will of
[40:25] God
[40:28] this have not told you this I pray to
[40:30] the Lord I said Lord if this is the time
[40:33] you want me to come to Arizona let
[40:35] brother respond to
[40:36] me if it is your
[40:41] will so the moment brother responded to
[40:43] me I said
[40:44] well then that means God has answered
[40:46] the prayer so therefore it's not longer
[40:49] my will but it's God's will
[40:53] right and brother
[40:57] sometimes Christians we find it
[41:00] difficult to ask God let your will be
[41:04] done
[41:06] look do
[41:08] never do never think that your will as
[41:13] you are your will will be something good
[41:15] for you
[41:19] that's if there is anything good that
[41:22] can come to you it must be the will of
[41:25] God
[41:28] right so please do not hesitate at any
[41:31] time to say God let your will be
[41:35] done oh Father I need this organ in the
[41:38] name of Jesus Christ Lord I claim
[41:42] it you claim it have you asked God
[41:45] whether it is your
[41:47] will you claim it continue to claim it
[41:51] sometime you claim something that does
[41:52] not belong to
[41:54] you come on Hallelujah
[41:57] let us say God let your will be done in
[41:58] our lives and when the will of God come
[42:02] into your life brother you go with
[42:03] confidence there is no danger on the way
[42:07] Hallelujah and and this man Jonas say no
[42:11] no no no God I'm not going to
[42:13] n rather I know how your prees can be if
[42:17] I don't get up from your presence you
[42:19] will continue to distur me go to go to
[42:22] so I'm now going I'm going to run away
[42:24] to passes
[42:27] and the Bible that he bought tickets to
[42:29] go to
[42:30] tashes and in the boat oh my that is
[42:34] what the prophet said that God was in
[42:35] the
[42:37] storm God threw a problem Into the Storm
[42:40] and you know it started shaking here and
[42:42] there and the boat was turning up and
[42:45] down like this and like that and
[42:47] everybody was praying that hey what an
[42:52] experience we have never experienced
[42:54] this thing before what is going on on so
[42:57] they started praying everybody was
[42:59] calling on the
[43:01] God and the ship master was going up and
[43:05] down and lo and behold there was a man
[43:08] that was
[43:09] sleeping he doesn't even know what has
[43:11] happen or what is happening he was
[43:14] snoring
[43:15] [Music]
[43:17] seriously then he went and tap him amen
[43:20] get up and pray call on your God perhaps
[43:24] he will answer you and all of us will be
[43:28] saved and you know what Jonah indeed
[43:34] arose and you look at the
[43:37] storm and you look at the face of the
[43:39] ship
[43:40] Master he said
[43:43] Master don't disturb yourself this thing
[43:46] is happening because of
[43:50] me
[43:53] what you making such a confession
[43:57] what do you know about this
[44:00] storm that you making such a statement
[44:03] do you have any secret that we don't
[44:05] know he say
[44:07] yes I am a servant of God God have sent
[44:11] me for an aan and I'm refusing to to
[44:14] go that is why this thing is happening
[44:17] to you so what should we do Jonah
[44:21] said well you may disagree with Jonah
[44:24] but there was nothing he could do
[44:27] Jonah told the man before you be free
[44:30] bind me and throw me into the water can
[44:35] you
[44:36] imagine the the ship master was thinking
[44:38] that the man was not
[44:40] correct he was thinking that he has gone
[44:44] crazy we should throw you into the
[44:47] sea he said that is the only thing that
[44:49] can save
[44:50] you if you want to be saved do
[44:54] that and they bound this
[44:57] man and indeed they threw him into the
[45:00] water the moment his skin touched the
[45:05] water the storm ceased
[45:08] right
[45:11] what what an amazing
[45:14] experience and you know
[45:16] what when they were saved like that what
[45:20] was happening to Jonah Jonah was
[45:23] sinking perhaps he he didn't he he
[45:25] didn't even know how to swim like how I
[45:27] don't know how to swim so I don't play
[45:29] around
[45:31] water Jonah was thinking but lo and
[45:35] behold the prophet that God was in the
[45:37] fish yes God have already prepared a
[45:41] natural
[45:43] submarine Jonah was the first man to
[45:45] experience
[45:47] submarine that was not made by the hand
[45:49] of a man but God himself oh Hallelujah
[45:54] and Jonah realiz that this was a fish
[45:57] that has opened it mouth for him yeah
[46:00] and he entered into it and the door was
[46:03] closed yes but you see the bible say
[46:07] that when
[46:10] Solomon dedicated the building and he
[46:13] said Lord wherever your children will
[46:17] be when they are in any
[46:21] situation that is not so good for them
[46:23] to enjoy when they take around and face
[46:27] this Temple Lord whatever they pray hear
[46:30] them and do for
[46:32] them and brother this inspiration struck
[46:35] Jonah in the belly of the fish yes and I
[46:39] don't know what Compass or navigation
[46:42] tool he used and he was able to turn in
[46:45] the fish the belly of the fish and face
[46:48] the temple in
[46:50] Jerusalem and he prayed a prayer Lord
[46:52] have mercy on
[46:54] me and God heard the prayer and God
[46:58] directed the
[46:59] fish and the Lord brought the fish at
[47:02] the shores of
[47:05] n but in his will he was going to
[47:12] tashes the people of n were at the shore
[47:15] all of a sudden they saw fish coming to
[47:18] dock the first time in their life and
[47:21] then the fish opened its mouth and they
[47:23] saw a man walking
[47:26] out from the face
[47:29] what this an experience that we have
[47:32] never seen
[47:34] before and the moment Jonah St on the
[47:37] shore and he said thus sayth the Lord
[47:41] all the people
[47:44] repented you see what God can
[47:47] do if God say that this is your work you
[47:52] can never run away from
[47:54] it amen
[47:56] if God said that he will use you you can
[47:58] never run away from it he know how to
[48:02] Corner
[48:03] you he know how to hold you he know how
[48:07] to grab you and make sure you come to
[48:09] the post of
[48:12] Duty amen and
[48:15] amen
[48:17] hallelujah he say so God was in there
[48:20] and he would just keep hunting you so
[48:23] why do we wait any longer
[48:26] let us just start the Revival right now
[48:30] yes what are you waiting on brother
[48:33] sister we believe that the coming of the
[48:36] Lord is at hand and he is going to have
[48:39] a bride and the bride is ready and we
[48:43] don't want no ships to any tashes we are
[48:47] going to nineve we don't want to go to
[48:50] any place we are going to glory and the
[48:52] prophet shouted amen here that is right
[48:55] we are going where God is going to bless
[48:59] and that is what we want to do amen
[49:04] hallelujah amen and amen you see so that
[49:06] is the reason why this is not the time
[49:08] of Slumber this is not the time of
[49:09] sleeping but this is the time that
[49:12] Believers we must be on
[49:14] fire hallelujah look at what is
[49:16] happening right now in the Middle East
[49:19] Palestinian against
[49:22] Israel look sometimes we we we forget
[49:26] about
[49:27] ourselves these things are bound to
[49:29] happen and it is happening the war
[49:32] between Israel and those people it is
[49:35] not from today a time from Memorial from
[49:39] the day of
[49:40] Abraham when God said that Abraham get
[49:44] up and walk every place that the show of
[49:46] your feet will tread it is the part of
[49:48] the land I have given you he said there
[49:51] can never be any man to stand against
[49:53] you and any man that cat you I'll cat
[49:55] them and any nation that will bless you
[49:57] I'll bless that nation and from that
[50:00] time Abraham fought and took the
[50:04] land when Moses led the people also from
[50:07] Egypt God sent them to that same portion
[50:10] of land he said this is what I gave to
[50:13] Abraham it belongs to you you are his
[50:16] descendants how many wars didn't they
[50:19] fight when Joshua took over oh my it was
[50:23] worse Joshua has to destroy all those
[50:26] Nations around because the bible say
[50:29] that God said as I commanded my servant
[50:32] Moses do
[50:34] it and they took all over this Gaza that
[50:37] they are fighting on now God gave it to
[50:40] his
[50:42] people but you know
[50:44] what all these
[50:46] things do not be
[50:49] confused that the the Palestinians are
[50:54] fighting Israel and Israel is fighting
[50:56] the Palestinian very soon the whole
[50:58] world is going to be against
[51:02] Israel but it is for a
[51:05] purpose I say what it is for a purpose
[51:08] brother sister it is for our own good
[51:12] because very soon when it becomes so
[51:15] much Israel is going to call for their
[51:17] Messiah to save
[51:19] them but you see before the Messiah will
[51:23] come you and I we must be in
[51:27] Glory if you read Joshua chapter 10 and
[51:31] Joshua 11 you see what God did for
[51:34] Israelites on this piece of land called
[51:36] Gaza it is there in the Bible Hallelujah
[51:40] so so we should not be confused at all
[51:42] beloved brothers and sisters are the
[51:44] Bride of Jesus Christ we know where we
[51:46] are standing Hallelujah we know where we
[51:49] are standing and I said this is
[51:51] preparing the ground for your rapture to
[51:53] take place amen and amen you see that is
[51:57] the reason why when those H 10 virgins
[52:01] the Jesus called them 10 virgins is that
[52:03] he say five were foolish and five were
[52:08] wise
[52:11] today we are the bread of Jesus
[52:15] Christ we represent the wise
[52:19] virgins hallelujah
[52:22] amen but what is the group that is
[52:25] called the foolish
[52:27] virgins the bible say that they all had
[52:30] the same
[52:32] idea they were all all all of them were
[52:35] waiting for the the bridegroom to come
[52:37] in
[52:38] yes that is the reason why when you sink
[52:41] they also
[52:42] sink When you pray in the name of the
[52:45] Lord Jesus Christ they also pray in the
[52:46] name of Jesus Christ when you say praise
[52:49] God they also say praise God when you
[52:52] say hallelujah they also say hallelujah
[52:55] but
[52:55] Jesus said five were
[52:59] wise and five were
[53:01] foolish but I thank God that we are the
[53:05] wise virgins yes amen Oh I thought you
[53:08] would say Amen
[53:09] here I maybe you didn't hear I said I
[53:12] than God that we are the wise virgins
[53:15] yes sir God bless you brother I like
[53:17] that when you say Amen say amen for the
[53:20] devil to know that you know what you are
[53:24] about don't do any sick amen okay do an
[53:28] amen that have life an amen that have
[53:31] power oh Hallelujah you see and the
[53:35] bible say that all of them were waiting
[53:38] for the coming of the
[53:40] bridegroom what happened the bridegroom
[53:43] delayed he says the first hour when they
[53:46] were expecting him he didn't come the
[53:48] second hour he didn't come the Third
[53:51] Watch The Fourth Watch the fifth watch
[53:53] the sixth watch it was the seventh
[53:55] watch and even the seventh watch it was
[53:58] at the midnight when all were
[54:01] asleep then all of they heard a shout
[54:04] behold the bridegroom
[54:06] cometh and then all of them got
[54:09] up because of the wi Having the Holy
[54:12] Ghost their lamps were burning but the
[54:17] foolish okay who didn't have the Holy
[54:19] Ghost their lamps were down right now
[54:22] they went to the wise virgins to ask
[54:24] them to give them oil because they want
[54:28] the wife said no no no no no no the holy
[54:30] ghost that I have I cannot share it with
[54:34] you yes I can't share my Holy Ghost with
[54:38] anyone you can't share your Holy Ghost
[54:40] with anyone Hallelujah he said if you
[54:43] want the Holy Ghost go to them that
[54:46] sell and the Bible said that indeed they
[54:48] left to go and
[54:50] buy when they came back the groom has
[54:54] already come
[54:56] and the wise have entered in with him
[55:00] and the door was
[55:02] [Music]
[55:03] shut but the question even is when the
[55:07] wise when the foolish went to buy the
[55:09] oil did they get
[55:12] it they
[55:15] didn't they didn't get it so they even
[55:18] came back to the spot in
[55:20] darkness that is why there is going to
[55:23] be a tribulation right amen okay and the
[55:26] tribulation you and I as the Bride of
[55:29] Jesus Christ we don't go through the
[55:30] tribulation but the foolish virgins are
[55:32] going to go through the
[55:34] tribulation because we have shaken
[55:36] ourselves from the things of this world
[55:39] and we are sitting in the word of God
[55:42] today Hallelujah the glory of God that
[55:46] he has poured upon this message is so
[55:49] much that it is giving us always Joy of
[55:52] Salvation and is giving us rapturing

[56:27] changed as a child of God Lisha has
[56:32] ended amen and when your body is changed
[56:35] is because you shook yourself from the
[56:38] unbelief of the world right and you sat
[56:41] in the word of God that is why your body
[56:44] is going to be changed you see what is
[56:46] going to change our body it is the

[1:06:01] n so why there is war over there between
[1:06:04] the israelit and the Philistines they
[1:06:06] are looking
[1:06:08] up and if they are looking up what
[1:06:11] should you and I the blood of Jesus
[1:06:12] Christ do because whether you like it or
[1:06:15] not Joseph must hide the wife and
[1:06:18] children in the palace before he reveal
[1:06:20] himself to his
[1:06:23] people amen and that is the condition
[1:06:26] that we the Church of Jesus Christ we
[1:06:29] have found
[1:06:30] ourselves now when you go I don't know
[1:06:33] about here but I know that the SP back
[1:06:36] home there's a smelting Factory okay
[1:06:38] there's a smelting Factory I'm closing
[1:06:40] with this brothers and sisters I don't
[1:06:42] want to take you too much there's a
[1:06:43] smelting Factory and there are people
[1:06:47] that do business with these
[1:06:50] companies they go and gather scraps from
[1:06:54] all over the place in the country
[1:06:56] wherever they will get it and then they
[1:06:58] will send it to the factory and sell it
[1:07:02] now when they buy it they have a common
[1:07:05] place that they pour all this crafts in
[1:07:09] there
[1:07:10] and a time will come then they'll
[1:07:14] release a big steam you know what a
[1:07:16] steam is
[1:07:18] magnet okay because when they are taking
[1:07:21] the scrap they they add so many things
[1:07:24] that are not really you know Iron Metal
[1:07:27] that they use so they bring the steam or
[1:07:31] the magnet on those
[1:07:34] scraps so that if there is anything good
[1:07:38] for them to use it will
[1:07:41] Attract it will attract them okay
[1:07:44] Hallelujah I think you understand what I
[1:07:47] mean and so when they are releasing
[1:07:50] it okay it will come to a time you you
[1:07:54] see that all those metal that have
[1:07:56] connection with the magnet will be
[1:07:58] shaking in the hole they cannot keep
[1:08:02] quiet it will be
[1:08:05] shaken and they will continue to release
[1:08:07] it like that then they will no longer
[1:08:11] stay there they will
[1:08:13] jump and touch the magnet they will jump
[1:08:17] and T the magnet they anything that have
[1:08:19] connection with the magnet is good and
[1:08:22] then they'll jump and touch it and when
[1:08:24] it is done brother then it will take all
[1:08:29] and release them in a
[1:08:31] fire now when they release them on a
[1:08:34] fire like that it is going to be
[1:08:37] melted and when they melt it then out of
[1:08:41] it they'll produce a new Iron
[1:08:46] rods and that is the experience that the
[1:08:48] Holy Ghost has put us
[1:08:50] in
[1:08:52] Hallelujah all this things that is going
[1:08:54] on in this
[1:08:56] world God is bringing himself down
[1:08:59] gradual am gradual by his Spirit
[1:09:04] gradual and you see that nations are
[1:09:08] breaking people's heart are fing them
[1:09:10] from Fear they don't know what is going
[1:09:12] to happen there are so many people today
[1:09:15] they they say Jesus is coming but they
[1:09:17] are afraid because they don't know what
[1:09:20] their their their position is going to
[1:09:21] be but not you and I all right we have a
[1:09:25] Blessed
[1:09:26] Assurance so while God is coming down a
[1:09:30] time will reach brother we can no longer
[1:09:32] stay on this earth right right we can no
[1:09:35] longer stay on this earth that is why
[1:09:36] our body will be changed and then we
[1:09:39] jump and meet the Lord in the air and
[1:09:42] the Bible said that so shall we ever be
[1:09:43] with
[1:09:46] him Paul
[1:09:48] said when a man come to the Lord Jesus
[1:09:53] Christ
[1:09:55] he said behold all things are passed
[1:09:58] away yes everything has become
[1:10:01] new that is the reason why when those
[1:10:05] iron rods are taken and put into the
[1:10:08] fire and it's melt they produce a new
[1:10:12] one from
[1:10:14] it we were so
[1:10:17] vile we're not a good
[1:10:19] people but God Favored us yes and he
[1:10:23] called us by our
[1:10:25] names and he move us from the unbelief
[1:10:28] of the world and he put us into his holy
[1:10:31] spirit fire and the Holy Spirit father
[1:10:33] has melted our bad ways and he has
[1:10:37] produced a new character out of us my
[1:10:41] brother my sister what should we do we
[1:10:45] should always Rejoice am and glorify the
[1:10:48] name of our maker that he didn't count
[1:10:51] us as one of the sinners
[1:10:54] but he has pointed us as his righteous
[1:10:56] Sons and Daughters even though it is not
[1:10:59] our own righteousness but his own
[1:11:01] righteousness and they will pray that
[1:11:03] prayer like Daniel he said Lord when we
[1:11:06] come unto you we are not coming because
[1:11:09] of our righteousness but we are coming
[1:11:11] to you because of your great mercies
[1:11:14] upon us that is what has made us what we
[1:11:17] are today brother sister let us arise am
[1:11:21] let us Shake ourselves amen from every
[1:11:24] unbelief and sit in the word of God God
