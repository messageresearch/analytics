[0:00] this is the 14th service I believe on
[0:03] the the kingdom and Heaven's mystery
[0:04] Earth's glory and looking at part three
[0:08] of seven women
[0:10] and one bride
[0:12] and there's a lot that we've already
[0:13] spoke on through the first couple parts
[0:15] out of Isaiah chapter four and I'd like
[0:18] to continue in that so if you could take
[0:19] your Bibles and turn to Isaiah chapter
[0:22] four I'd like to read verses one and two
[0:24] so that we can get
[0:26] a little bit of context to this
[0:30] it says in Isaiah chapter 4 verse 1 and
[0:33] in that day seven women shall take a
[0:36] hold of one man
[0:37] saying we will eat our own bread and
[0:40] wear our own apparel only let us be
[0:42] called by thy name to take away our
[0:45] reproach and so this is one view of
[0:48] seven women in that day but then it says
[0:51] kind of changing the picture in that
[0:53] they shall the branch of the Lord be
[0:55] beautiful and glorious and the fruit of
[0:58] the Earth shall be excellent and comely
[0:59] for them that are escaped of Israel and
[1:03] the next verse is talking about he that
[1:05] is left in Zion and there is going to be
[1:07] uh this is a specific uh kind of
[1:11] comparison in verse 1 and verse two
[1:12] seven women and I'm calling this branch
[1:15] of the Lord and those identified with it
[1:17] and those that are escaped of Israel as
[1:19] brother Branham identifies it even says
[1:20] Zion that this is representative and in
[1:23] type we see the figure of the bribes
[1:26] that's the seven women in one bride
[1:28] brother Branham and the sermon the
[1:30] future home of the Heavenly bridegroom
[1:32] and the Earthly bride he said there is
[1:34] one bride not a dozen denominations but
[1:37] one bride and and to me this language is
[1:40] just so beautiful one bride that's the
[1:43] elected out of the earth so this is to
[1:46] me it has that image of what God created
[1:48] the Earth for and the Very purpose why
[1:49] he created it to get a bride out of it
[1:51] there was one bride that's elective out
[1:53] of the earth that's been predestinated
[1:55] to this
[1:57] that the ones who can recognize their
[2:00] place in the Kingdom that just takes the
[2:03] whole thought and puts it together the
[2:04] kingdom of Heaven's mystery Earth's
[2:07] Glory that there's a bride that's
[2:08] elected out of the earth and you're the
[2:11] ones that are predestinated to recognize
[2:13] your place in the Kingdom that's that's
[2:16] given to you
[2:18] now I I trust that some of you have been
[2:19] reading maybe studying the sermon the
[2:21] future home of the Heavenly bridegroom
[2:23] and the Earthly bride and there's a lot
[2:25] of things in it that are a lot of
[2:28] details and a lot of putting together of
[2:30] scriptures and bringing out a lot of
[2:31] different principles and he makes the
[2:33] statement uh later on in the sermon he
[2:36] says this is a deep Revelation from God
[2:39] and when he when he says that there
[2:41] might be some things we're thinking oh
[2:43] well this is the Deep revelation of God
[2:45] and this is the Deep revelation of God
[2:46] and I would say that even in
[2:49] articulating it even if he says this is
[2:51] a deep revelation of God and he just
[2:53] gives the scriptures of how many cubits
[2:54] the city would be uh just reading it and
[2:57] knowing the math isn't the Revelation
[2:59] there's something to be quick and
[3:01] there's something that's in it but when
[3:03] he refers to the Deep revelation of God
[3:04] I think we should kind of press in a
[3:06] little bit and say well Lord I want the
[3:08] Deep Revelation just don't want the
[3:09] veneer I just don't want the surface I
[3:11] don't even want to just conclude things
[3:13] as the Deep Revelation that had already
[3:16] been understood and charted and figured
[3:18] out just by reading the scripture I want
[3:21] the revelation of it
[3:22] and as it refers to this deep revelation
[3:25] of God he then begins to refer to the
[3:27] city and the dimensions of it and how
[3:29] the span that it would be and what it
[3:32] would cover even relating it to how that
[3:34] would Set uh in the United States and he
[3:36] talks talks about a pyramid-like
[3:38] mountain uh that's going to push up from
[3:40] the earth and he's talking about there's
[3:42] going to be a bride that's elected out
[3:43] of the earth and so there's something
[3:45] that's going to be emerging and so you
[3:46] see there's something coming but then
[3:48] there's something that is and he begins
[3:50] to talk about a king
[3:52] it makes this statement very near this
[3:54] part where he says a deep Revelation
[3:56] from God I'm kind of just putting this
[3:58] out there so that I know that it's been
[3:59] uh mentioned if we can't quite dive into
[4:02] it much today I want this in kind of our
[4:04] fabric as we go through this series it
[4:06] says in this pyramid with seven steps
[4:09] then the king's chamber so this in that
[4:12] seventh step it's not the king chamber
[4:14] but then the king's chamber he says
[4:16] we're in the seventh Church age before
[4:18] the king takes his throne he's looking
[4:21] at this moment in time this place where
[4:24] we are and then this this other chamber
[4:26] uh beyond that seventh step he says
[4:28] remember the pyramid never had a did
[4:31] have a Capstone on it
[4:33] and that that brings into our mind a lot
[4:35] of things about the Capstone and the the
[4:37] Capstone that's revealed and uh even in
[4:39] Christ the mystery God revealed how that
[4:41] headstone of that Capstone speaks of a
[4:43] kingdom
[4:44] and he brings things into one view it
[4:47] kind of gets our attention a deep
[4:50] Revelation from God he starts talking
[4:51] about the pyramid the city this mountain
[4:52] pushing up out of the earth and then he
[4:55] takes this pyramid and he says well
[4:57] there's seven steps and then there's you
[4:59] go into this king's chamber and he's
[5:02] relating this in the pyramid and the
[5:04] pyramids never had a Capstone so the
[5:06] things that he brings into view are the
[5:07] seven Church ages the Capstone Christ is
[5:10] King and his bride if you go and read
[5:13] this particular portion he's taking all
[5:15] these different elements and kind of
[5:16] piecing them in there
[5:17] and he comes to shortly after this he
[5:20] reads Isaiah chapter four he reads the
[5:22] entire chapter and you can see from
[5:24] those verses three to six how it it
[5:27] fills in and it relates to and you can
[5:30] see this burning and this purging and
[5:32] this creating of this this atmosphere
[5:34] for the Millennium even as it would lead
[5:36] into uh that perfect day where
[5:38] everything is destroyed and everything
[5:40] is purged and everything is cleansed
[5:42] and as he reads Isaiah chapter 4 verse 1
[5:45] he said that's the end time where we're
[5:48] living now
[5:49] so this is he says marriage and divorce
[5:52] and what more prostitution he said
[5:54] there's a there's the seven women taking
[5:56] hold of wanting to take a hold of one
[5:58] man still wanting to eat their own food
[6:00] and dress themselves but they want the
[6:02] pretense of uh legitimacy they want to
[6:06] be able to say oh these seven these
[6:08] these daughters we have well they're
[6:09] they're from him we have a husband a
[6:12] true husband and so there's different
[6:14] Boston claims that these women make and
[6:16] he's saying that's the end time that
[6:17] we're living in now and then he when he
[6:19] reads in Isaiah 4 he says the daughter
[6:21] of Zion he says that's always the bride
[6:25] so there's there's a type in Zion you
[6:28] can see a type of the Bride enzyme
[6:30] there's things that very literally and
[6:31] specifically would apply to Israel or
[6:33] Zion that there's things spiritually and
[6:35] even literally that apply in full uh
[6:38] fulfillment and perfect fulfillment in
[6:40] the bride so he's bringing something
[6:42] into our view as he takes these
[6:43] scriptures as we said before his brother
[6:46] says that's the end time these seven
[6:48] women I'm using as kind of a type and
[6:51] just a way to refer to them and
[6:53] hopefully in the next couple Services we
[6:55] can get into more of the background of
[6:57] when the Bible says in that day what
[6:59] it's referring to and the image that's
[7:01] being represented the influence it has
[7:02] on the people but these seven women are
[7:05] the product of Satan's deception
[7:07] he's designed them he's manipulated them
[7:10] he's caused them to think a certain way
[7:11] and desire a certain way but the bride
[7:14] there's one bride and this one bride is
[7:16] one with Christ
[7:18] she is a bride and not just in
[7:21] anticipation of being married but a
[7:23] bride is called a bride in the day that
[7:25] she's wed
[7:26] even the term bridegroom it means a man
[7:28] who's about to be married and so there's
[7:30] something in that designation of Bride
[7:32] and bridegroom that brings us to a union
[7:34] not being engaged but to a union
[7:36] and this these seven women and this one
[7:39] bride as we're just using those phrases
[7:41] uh these are two they're animated by two
[7:44] different lives
[7:45] there they have that's two different
[7:47] Natures two different characters and you
[7:50] can see in the one the very image of a
[7:52] laodicean woman but the other is she is
[7:55] the bride of Christ
[7:58] and the the subject that I'm wanting to
[8:00] lead into
[8:01] and as we're as we're looking at this
[8:03] this contrast between these two and if
[8:05] you look at the contrast between two
[8:06] Edens in Two Cities
[8:08] but there there's there's in the bride
[8:10] there's Kingdom power and Kingdom
[8:13] character that's being manifested
[8:15] that in in the bride and you as
[8:18] individuals members of it you are
[8:19] manifesting the glory of Heaven the
[8:22] mystery of Christ it is ordained that it
[8:24] would be revealed through you
[8:26] and lest we think for at any moment that
[8:28] that means that we could sit down at a
[8:30] coffee table and chart out the seals
[8:32] together with the church ages and and
[8:34] show what the revelations 10 1 was and
[8:37] and try to figure out all the types and
[8:38] all the figures now it's about living
[8:40] the life and that nature of Christ being
[8:43] expressed through you that that's what
[8:46] it means for the kingdom to be expressed
[8:49] now that is a foundation if you could
[8:51] look at Revelations chapter 19. verses
[8:54] 11 and 12.
[8:57] and I want to use
[8:59] as we've
[9:00] we've kind of shown the contrast and how
[9:03] the devil impersonates and the devil's
[9:05] lie versus the the truth of God and how
[9:08] he's always a mimic he's always an
[9:09] impersonation
[9:11] and I had originally prepared to start
[9:14] with Revelations chapter six and come
[9:16] back to Isaiah 4 and kind of look at the
[9:19] seven women first I I wanted to kind of
[9:22] break that pattern a little bit and just
[9:24] take some time this morning in looking
[9:26] at the brides because by seeing the
[9:27] bride we can see this contrast uh to
[9:30] these seven women so it says in
[9:32] Revelations 19 verses 11 and 12 and I
[9:35] would I I do appreciate just how
[9:37] intentive you are this morning and very
[9:40] very focused I need that I need that
[9:42] help and you're doing a tremendous job
[9:43] already
[9:44] he says I saw heaven opened and behold a
[9:47] white horse so he taken our minds a
[9:48] white horse this gives us this image in
[9:50] this figure and he that sat upon him was
[9:53] called faithful and true now we have one
[9:55] riding on a white horse and he is called
[9:58] he that sat upon Him is called faithful
[10:00] and true
[10:01] and in righteousness he the judge and
[10:05] make war
[10:06] so this is kind of characterizing him in
[10:09] this moment and in this time
[10:11] now these different designations here
[10:14] his eyes were as a flame of fire
[10:17] and on his head were many crowns and he
[10:20] had a name written that no man knew but
[10:24] he himself
[10:26] now this is if I could put it this way
[10:28] this is after the Rapture leading into
[10:30] the Millennium this is then it was a
[10:32] catch the timing here it's after the
[10:33] Rapture it's leading into the millennial
[10:35] Millennial Reign and as we read already
[10:37] it tells us of his characterization as
[10:41] the one who is writing it says this this
[10:43] is Christ the King of Kings is how he's
[10:46] declared the Lord of lords and these are
[10:49] three things I want to look at
[10:50] his eyes is flaming fire crowns on his
[10:54] head and a name written hopefully today
[10:57] we can look enough at the crowns on his
[11:00] head to see something there and then
[11:01] hold off some about the name
[11:04] but there's a deep truth
[11:06] that's represented in each one of these
[11:08] descriptions of Christ uh they're
[11:10] they're presented symbolically now if
[11:13] there is a very literal ex literal
[11:16] expression of Christ riding on a white
[11:17] horse and he's literally presented in
[11:20] this way and is and writing out this way
[11:22] as he comes to his Millennial Reign then
[11:24] that's wonderful then we can realize
[11:26] that even in the literal fulfillment
[11:28] their symbolism in it that we can catch
[11:31] and gather from it and so there's deep
[11:33] truths that are being represented in
[11:35] this description of Christ does he death
[11:37] judge and make war is Isis flame as
[11:39] fires crowns are upon his head and he
[11:41] had a name written and I I want you to
[11:44] see Christ I want you to see things
[11:46] about Christ and and it's wonderful to
[11:49] see him but I believe that his desire in
[11:52] revealing himself is to show you who you
[11:55] are
[11:56] it's not just all self-centered on him
[11:59] like look at me how great I am how
[12:00] awesome I am but by peering into his
[12:03] heart he's hoping that you learn
[12:04] something about yourself but your true
[12:06] nature and who you truly are so there's
[12:08] things to see about Christ but then
[12:10] there's things to see about us and
[12:12] there's several things that I'll be
[12:13] using in the scripture today that I want
[12:15] to say now that we're looking at in type
[12:18] and I hope that that at the Bedrock you
[12:21] see the truth of it and we're not just
[12:22] trying to pull out uh the symbols and
[12:25] the types and make them the truths
[12:26] themselves but these things that we're
[12:28] looking at in types speak to a truth
[12:31] about Christ and about his bride
[12:33] now if we just look at his eyes were as
[12:36] a flame of fire I'm just doing this very
[12:37] quickly just to show that the message
[12:39] brings out things about this in
[12:42] Revelations 1 14 it's describing Christ
[12:44] in the same way and we're taught in the
[12:47] message that this is Christ we know from
[12:48] Revelations 1 this is Christ The Living
[12:50] Word
[12:51] and this is him these eyes of the flame
[12:53] of fire and this this representation of
[12:55] him this is the Supreme judge this is
[12:58] him in a dispensation of judgment now we
[13:01] know that he's always uh he always has
[13:03] the power to judge and it's been
[13:05] committed to him but the time of judging
[13:07] is a specific dispensation
[13:09] and so here is as eyes of flame of fire
[13:13] is speaking to a characteristic of
[13:15] Christ
[13:16] and then it says and I may be taking
[13:18] this a little bit out of order but this
[13:20] is just to kind of help me this morning
[13:21] it says that he had a name written that
[13:24] no man knew but he himself
[13:27] it says that his name is called the word
[13:30] of God
[13:31] now I'm not trying to get kind of caught
[13:33] up on the semantics and I'm not saying
[13:35] that they're necessarily different just
[13:37] wanting you to recognize that it his
[13:39] name is called the word of God and it
[13:42] says he had a name written that no man
[13:45] knew but he himself I want you to think
[13:47] about that we know his name is called
[13:49] the word of God and and in the prayer
[13:51] verse though it says he has a name
[13:53] written that no man knew but he himself
[13:58] this phrase as I want you just to think
[14:01] about it a little bit
[14:03] as let me just just read it
[14:06] and in verse 13.
[14:09] it says and he was clawed with the
[14:11] vesture
[14:12] dipped in Blood and I because I don't
[14:14] think I'm going to get to get to this
[14:15] this morning and his name is called the
[14:18] word of God
[14:20] so we the Bible's already telling us his
[14:23] name is called the word of God and and I
[14:26] just want you to think of this this
[14:27] breaking it out there's a name on him
[14:30] that's written that no man knows but he
[14:31] himself and his name is called the word
[14:33] of God I'm not saying they're two
[14:35] different things but they're presented
[14:36] two different ways
[14:38] but we're told his name is called the
[14:40] word of God and this one uh
[14:43] characteristic that's given about this
[14:45] name is no man knew
[14:47] and in the New Testament it's translated
[14:48] to see or Saul perceive even one place
[14:52] cannot tell
[14:53] so if no man knew man was not able to
[14:56] perceive it he could not see it he could
[14:58] not know it
[14:59] and it's one that he knew himself
[15:03] but no other man could tell
[15:06] no other man could see or know this name
[15:11] and it's in that to me that I begin to
[15:14] recognize that the bride is represented
[15:17] in this image of Christ
[15:19] because there's a name written and it's
[15:22] a name that man cannot perceive cannot
[15:25] no cannot tell
[15:27] and therefore when we think about the
[15:29] bride she is Untouched by man
[15:32] she is not known or she is not made or
[15:35] discovered by men
[15:37] no man says oh this is the brighter this
[15:40] is and can conjure her up and brother
[15:43] Branham says in spoken word is the
[15:44] Original Seed the true bride like Mary
[15:47] and I'm glad that we could read this
[15:49] from the message because I know that
[15:51] it's uh it's mature language he says the
[15:53] true bride like Mary will have a virgin
[15:56] womb for the Bride of the word which is
[15:58] Christ
[16:00] when Christ the word comes to the bride
[16:02] she will be the same as he is
[16:07] I think all the the he him stuff is just
[16:09] Satan get tripped getting tripped up on
[16:11] she is him
[16:12] since she will be the same as he is a
[16:16] Virgin by the word oh God I hope it's
[16:19] going over brother Neville brother
[16:20] Neville is it going over
[16:22] he says I hope you understand what was
[16:24] he
[16:26] the word word the word of God and now
[16:29] notice where he goes upon his vesture he
[16:32] had a name written the word of God now
[16:34] he's combined verses 12 and 13. on his
[16:37] master he had a name written the word of
[16:39] God so autonomy has a name written and
[16:42] his name is called the word of God and
[16:43] he brings Revelations 19 in there when
[16:46] he's talking about the bride word
[16:48] and he judges to John 1 in the beginning
[16:50] was the word of the word was with God
[16:51] and the Word was God verse 12 in the
[16:53] word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us
[16:55] he says he is God and God is the word
[16:59] and when his bride comes she'll be the
[17:02] same product that he is
[17:04] so Christ his name is called he is
[17:07] called the word of God and now he says
[17:10] the bride which she comes she's going to
[17:13] be the same product
[17:15] she is the word of God
[17:17] in the sermon God of this evil age and
[17:18] bringing a lot of out of this sermon
[17:20] he's talking about how contrary
[17:22] denominations are to God's will
[17:24] to God's word and I think that's a very
[17:26] statement he makes just before we read
[17:27] this how contrary is denomination to
[17:29] God's word he says show me where God
[17:31] ever blessed the church after it was
[17:33] organized remember the the mark of the
[17:35] beast the Antichrist
[17:38] and the Beast it's not just only the
[17:40] Roman Catholic church but it's organized
[17:42] religion it says show me where uh God
[17:45] blessed a church after it was organized
[17:47] she went on the shelf and died with
[17:49] intellectual wisdom from the Devil by
[17:51] their leaders
[17:52] and refused now that's a mouthful refuse
[17:56] the word of God as it grew up into the
[17:58] perfect statue of Christ
[18:00] now think of where he's rejected and
[18:02] where he's put out now it's at the head
[18:05] now we're at the Capstone we're at the
[18:06] crowning he says how contrary and then
[18:09] he says separate from that unbelieving
[18:11] Eve you children of the evening light
[18:13] separate from that unbelieving Eve you
[18:16] children of the evening light Satan God
[18:18] of this age by his knowledge getting the
[18:20] people to eat from his mixed tree of
[18:21] Good and Evil notice Satan by his
[18:24] knowledge causing the people this evil
[18:25] age to eat from his tree of Good and
[18:28] Evil there's that mixture again there's
[18:30] those worldly kingdoms he says that he
[18:33] is building a greater Christian
[18:34] Civilization by his knowledge of Good
[18:36] and Evil a greater Christian
[18:37] civilization but Christ little virgin
[18:41] word flock bride
[18:43] don't care for his knowledge
[18:46] she keeps free from of him
[18:48] now let's talk about her a minute she
[18:51] waits for her Lord and his Millennial
[18:53] honeymoon right with the word groom as
[18:56] she is the word bride
[18:59] now recognize how there is a people who
[19:01] separate from the unbelieving eve
[19:04] and that they won't be mixed with it she
[19:06] keeps free from him
[19:08] and he's using this language of a
[19:11] virgin word flock bride
[19:16] and in the marriage and divorce he says
[19:18] and the bride will be a lovely little
[19:19] lady of the word unadulterated not
[19:23] touched by any man's organization any
[19:26] man-made Theory she'll be purely
[19:28] unadulterated Bride of the word
[19:33] now when there's a name written that no
[19:35] man knew
[19:36] then this this name represents something
[19:39] that man hasn't man handled something
[19:42] that man couldn't get to they could
[19:44] pervert something off of it and they
[19:46] could make something look like it but
[19:48] God is going to preserve for himself one
[19:50] that is not touched by man one that
[19:53] cannot be manhandled one that has not
[19:55] been defiled and and she will be this is
[19:58] the bride the word
[20:00] I recognize that his name is called the
[20:03] word of God and now you are the word of
[20:06] God
[20:07] and we know the bride takes on the
[20:09] bridegroom's name
[20:10] Batman makes the statement the bride was
[20:12] the word of God and the testimony of
[20:13] Jesus Christ
[20:15] so the bride is the word of God and the
[20:18] testimony of Jesus Christ
[20:20] so what I'm wanting to express is how
[20:23] that the bride of Christ when Christ is
[20:26] symbolized and Christ is represented the
[20:29] bride is riding with him and is
[20:31] represented in these symbols
[20:34] Christ has a name written
[20:37] and it is said that no man knew so
[20:40] there's something we could say well
[20:42] there's a hidden Mystery to this name
[20:43] there's a knowledge that's not commonly
[20:45] known that there's something that's
[20:47] hidden and therefore it's connected then
[20:49] with revelation
[20:51] that if no man knows it then the only
[20:53] way that you could know it is if the son
[20:54] would reveal it to you
[20:57] now let's look at this name names that
[21:00] are written in other places in scripture
[21:01] and again I'm just wanting you to see
[21:03] how the bride is represented in this
[21:05] name that's written his name is called
[21:06] the word of God in this name that's
[21:08] written that no man knows
[21:10] and brother Branham takes
[21:13] these scriptures
[21:14] in Revelations 19 and in God of this
[21:17] evil age he's showing us at the end time
[21:20] there's this separating out of this one
[21:23] true bride from the rest of Satan's
[21:25] mixing and denominationalism and
[21:27] organization
[21:29] in Isaiah 49 verse 16 he says behold
[21:32] I have Graven these talking about Zion
[21:35] here I have Graven thee I've inscribed
[21:38] I've written I've Graven thee upon the
[21:40] palms of my hands thy walls are
[21:43] continually before me remember in
[21:45] Revelations 21 how much the wall the
[21:46] foundation of the wall and the wall is
[21:48] mentioned over and over and over again
[21:50] and here and talking about the bride or
[21:52] Zion we can see the bride he said you're
[21:54] written in my hands
[21:57] and in the engraving in the hand it's to
[22:00] signify not just power and personal
[22:04] ownership but it's the eternal security
[22:07] you're Graven I'm not just holding
[22:10] feathers I'm not just holding a
[22:12] collection of names I'm I'm not I just
[22:14] don't have a record uh well some make it
[22:17] some don't but I have those that are
[22:18] permanent that eternally secure and he
[22:21] says I've they're written in the palm of
[22:23] my hands
[22:25] and then in John chapter 10 verses 27
[22:28] 28-29 Jesus says my sheep hear my voice
[22:32] so that's a designation my sheep hear my
[22:33] voice and I know them
[22:37] and they follow me so this is a specific
[22:40] class of people that are only known by
[22:42] God
[22:43] and you say well it's not just know
[22:45] their name and know they exist and know
[22:47] who they are know of thee kind of the
[22:49] the
[22:50] the mystical entity but rather he knows
[22:53] specifically who they are that and it's
[22:56] a personal absolute knowledge and no man
[22:58] knows that he says my sheep hear my
[23:00] voice and I know them and they follow me
[23:01] and I give unto them eternal life that
[23:04] they shall never perish
[23:06] neither shall any man pluck them out of
[23:09] my hand
[23:10] so we have an image of names Graven in
[23:13] the palm of a hand and he says my sheep
[23:16] know my voice
[23:18] and I know them
[23:19] and no man can remove them
[23:24] he says my Father which gave them me
[23:27] is greater than all and he repeats it
[23:29] and no man is able to pluck them out of
[23:32] my father's hand
[23:34] now there's some Unity there there's
[23:36] some Union that there is a Graven in the
[23:40] hand and cannot be plucked out of the
[23:42] father's hand
[23:43] and I think plucking I obviously maybe
[23:46] it's obvious to you what it means and it
[23:49] means to carry off by force
[23:52] or to pull
[23:54] that and it carries this meaning that if
[23:56] something is plucked you you claim it
[23:59] for yourself
[24:01] when if you're gonna Harvest fruit if
[24:03] you pick it you pluck it off the vine
[24:05] and you take something you're taking
[24:07] ownership of it you're claiming it for
[24:08] yourself so he says I have these names I
[24:12] have these people these sheep that are
[24:13] given to me and no man can claim them
[24:17] for himself
[24:18] no man can pull them away even by force
[24:21] no attraction no draw no signs and
[24:24] wonders no powers no move of the
[24:26] Antichrist is able to claim them take
[24:29] ownership of them to defile them
[24:32] and it's in this selection and in this
[24:35] position in his hand that Jesus gives
[24:38] the disciples the comfort in Luke 10 20
[24:40] notwithstanding in this Rejoice not
[24:42] don't Rejoice that demons are subject to
[24:44] you and that you can use his name to
[24:45] cast out devils and raise people from
[24:47] the dead and do many wonderful Works he
[24:49] says and he says that the spirits are
[24:51] subject unto you that's not what we
[24:52] rejoice in alone but rather Rejoice this
[24:55] is the ultimate because your names are
[24:57] written in heaven
[25:00] and we have in this image together with
[25:02] Christ that there's one who has a name
[25:05] written that no man knew but he himself
[25:07] and his name is called the word of God
[25:10] and your name is written in heaven
[25:13] your your names are Graven in his hands
[25:17] you are represented represented as being
[25:20] in his hand
[25:22] this is even in the image of Christ we
[25:25] see ourselves in Christ writing on the
[25:28] White Horse
[25:30] it says on his head
[25:32] and I'll come back to those names
[25:34] here later maybe in the next service
[25:39] he says on his head
[25:41] that's the image one head
[25:44] on his head are many crowns
[25:46] but only one name written
[25:49] and these symbols are being connected
[25:51] together
[25:52] on his head are many crowns and on his
[25:55] name on him only and only one name
[25:57] written
[25:58] there's only one head Christ
[26:01] there's only one New Jerusalem there's
[26:03] only one mountain
[26:04] so you have Christ with one head and
[26:07] many crowns you have one one mountain
[26:11] that that is this New Jerusalem
[26:14] and if again if I could say this in
[26:16] these images of Christ the bride is
[26:18] always there even if you don't see her
[26:21] she's hidden in him she's unseen she's
[26:23] represented with him
[26:24] and in Revelations chapter 5 verse 6
[26:28] says and behold and lo in the midst of
[26:30] the throne
[26:32] and of the four beasts and in the midst
[26:34] of the elders this is the time when the
[26:35] seven sealed book is being opened this
[26:37] is the one that was found worthy to step
[26:39] forward and take the book
[26:40] stood a lamb as it had been slain so
[26:43] there's there's the we even see this
[26:46] Blood
[26:47] in this picture is the same as you would
[26:49] see it is garment being stained with
[26:51] blood in Revelations 19 having seven
[26:54] horns and seven eyes in the Bible
[26:56] tells us what these are representing
[26:59] these seven eyes which are the seven
[27:00] spirits of God sent forth into all the
[27:03] Earth
[27:04] takes the scripture and I think it's uh
[27:06] he's preaching the Revelation series he
[27:07] says what is it the Bride In Christ
[27:10] so he says it it's Christ and his bride
[27:13] is what he says what is it Christ and
[27:15] his bride so she's represented
[27:18] even in this image in Revelations 5 is
[27:21] this lamb that had been slain in this
[27:22] image having seven horns and seven eyes
[27:24] and brother Ram shows us how the seven
[27:26] horns represent seven Church ages and he
[27:29] says it means a kingdom
[27:31] so there's a kingdom that's being built
[27:33] up there's a kingdom that's being
[27:34] expressed in this image of Christ and he
[27:37] says that the the seven eyes the Bible
[27:40] says the seven spirits of God into all
[27:42] the Earth that these are messengers to
[27:43] the church
[27:45] this is this this is maybe not to deep
[27:48] rich symbolism of these scriptures but
[27:50] this is what these symbols are
[27:51] representing
[27:52] and we know that according to the
[27:54] message of God that only the elect hear
[27:57] the message only that truly hear the
[28:00] message the true church hears the
[28:03] message but the false church WIll oppose
[28:06] the message to each age even if they
[28:09] claim to believe it they don't humble
[28:10] themselves to it
[28:12] so as we touched on Wednesday night part
[28:14] of the message
[28:15] is to the church that rejects him
[28:18] judgment it's The Binding of the tares
[28:20] he speaks and it's judgment we have to
[28:22] be careful that as he speaks judgment
[28:24] and calls them the church and judge it
[28:25] comes upon them that we don't say take
[28:28] that to mean it's upon the bride but
[28:29] he's a messenger they claim to be the
[28:31] church so he speaks the message of
[28:32] binding and judgment to the church that
[28:34] rejects him but there's also a word only
[28:37] to the elect
[28:39] that nobody else can claim he speaks a
[28:41] word only to the elect
[28:43] now again just keep in mind this image
[28:46] of Christ the lamb with these seven
[28:50] horns
[28:51] and then these seven eyes and this is
[28:53] all represented as one this one lamb
[28:56] and
[28:57] there's a bride that's represented here
[28:59] this Kingdom that's represented in this
[29:01] lamb or with this lamb now there's a lot
[29:04] that we could read from the force Hill
[29:05] but I want to read this
[29:07] the Antichrist refuses the true bride
[29:11] Doctrine
[29:12] and therefore he takes his own right now
[29:15] and builds her up under a Creed of his
[29:18] own
[29:19] takes his own bride and makes her
[29:21] denomination
[29:23] she gives birth to other denominations
[29:26] as quoted in this Holy Scripture gives
[29:29] birth to daughters
[29:31] and she becomes just like her mother
[29:33] natural worldly denominational
[29:37] opposing the spiritual bride the word
[29:42] this is this is portrayed even in
[29:44] Revelations 19 as there's Christ is
[29:46] coming to judge and make war it's coming
[29:49] against those that would oppose anything
[29:51] that would be against and there's this
[29:52] there's this binding and there's this
[29:54] tearing down and there's this destroying
[29:56] that's signified in war in this judging
[29:58] and this Rod of iron
[30:01] but brother Branham takes the Antichrist
[30:03] and he says that he takes his own bride
[30:06] and through her gives birth to
[30:08] denominations
[30:10] called daughters or the mother of
[30:12] harlots
[30:13] and she's natural worldly denominational
[30:16] and it opposes the spiritual bride of
[30:19] the word
[30:20] I know this is just more of the same to
[30:23] what's already been said just using
[30:24] other statements
[30:26] now if I could take you and I know that
[30:29] it's not I haven't reached a conclusion
[30:30] I'm just bringing things into into view
[30:32] here so you have Christ riding on a
[30:34] white horse and he has on his head many
[30:37] crowns his eyes his flame as fire and he
[30:40] had a name written that no man knew but
[30:42] he himself this sets forth Christ right
[30:44] in a White Horse different symbols are
[30:47] represented in him and this is Christ
[30:49] and you're represented with him
[30:51] now there's a false bride and there's an
[30:54] antichrist Spirit who wants to achieve a
[30:56] bride so in Revelation chapter 6 verse 2
[31:04] we're making good time I don't know if
[31:06] I'm going too fast but we're making
[31:07] really good time today
[31:09] he says in Revelations chapter 6 verse 2
[31:11] and I saw
[31:13] and behold a white horse
[31:15] and he that sat on him had a bow and
[31:19] again what's brought out is there's no
[31:21] arrows
[31:22] and the crown was given unto him
[31:26] and he went forth conquering and to
[31:29] conquer
[31:30] notice there's no name given at this
[31:33] point it doesn't have a name written on
[31:34] him there's no name given we recognize
[31:37] this to be the Antichrist spirit
[31:39] and there was a time when many believe
[31:42] this to be the end Jesus Christ and now
[31:45] I believe it's most widely accepted that
[31:47] this is the Antichrist
[31:49] and this is the position that we see in
[31:52] the word of God is that this would be
[31:54] the Antichrist Spirit riding out so it's
[31:56] up the spirit
[31:58] and brother Branham in
[32:00] now as you see that image of
[32:03] one riding on a white horse and he has a
[32:06] crown
[32:07] and he's he's riding up to conquer he
[32:10] has a bow so there's something in it
[32:11] that a lot of people read says oh this
[32:12] is Christ this is Christ This Is The
[32:14] Mighty conqueror right in a White Horse
[32:15] and we're going to see him again in
[32:17] Revelations 19. but this is The False
[32:19] Image
[32:20] and what's remarkable is how in
[32:22] Revelation 6 he's riding on a white
[32:25] horse
[32:26] and we don't see Christ right until
[32:28] Revelations 19.
[32:30] and I know it's not perfect in
[32:31] chronology but in the way that this
[32:34] unfolds we see here in Revelation 6 this
[32:37] White Horse seemingly going out first
[32:38] with a with a beast to meet him and it's
[32:41] not Christ on a white horse it's Satan
[32:44] portraying himself first as one riding
[32:47] on a white horse
[32:48] and in the sermon the unity of one God
[32:50] and the one Church he's talking about
[32:52] Islam and he says in Muhammad he says
[32:55] you ever think why the White Horse
[32:56] because they believe that Muhammad is
[32:57] going to come riding on a white horse
[32:59] and those that stand guard and how they
[33:01] keep their religion he said did you know
[33:03] the scripture says that Jesus shall come
[33:04] riding on a white horse and his Vester
[33:07] dipped in Blood and his name is called
[33:08] the word of God
[33:10] it's the Lord Jesus
[33:12] shall come riding into Heavens with the
[33:15] armies behind him riding on a white
[33:17] horse
[33:19] can you see that perverted religion
[33:22] turned around and make it Muhammad on a
[33:24] white horse
[33:26] this is the perversion in religion but
[33:29] Jesus is coming in the heavens and
[33:31] Muhammad is Earthly
[33:34] here's a here's a religion that takes
[33:36] some symbolism and takes some idea and
[33:38] has co-opted it and taken it
[33:41] and it's being represented in their
[33:43] Theology and their belief system he says
[33:44] that's just perverting the truth
[33:47] and if you recall when Babylonian
[33:49] religion began in the very beginning
[33:51] with Nimrod his religion spread out
[33:54] through all the Earth so that you see
[33:56] the same symbols in every religion
[33:58] around the earth even if they couldn't
[33:59] be connected together in time or close
[34:02] in proximity
[34:03] because it's the Satan's perverted
[34:05] religion it's that mimic weed that twin
[34:08] and he says Muhammad is Earthly
[34:11] so Satan works with the earthy Earth
[34:14] things
[34:16] while God works with the heavens
[34:19] I love that how he said God works with
[34:21] the heavens Satan only has Earthly
[34:23] things to work with and did you ever
[34:25] think of the Tower of Babylon and
[34:27] compare it with Jacob's Ladder this one
[34:28] had me really I was like yes yes how
[34:32] that they were trying to build stair
[34:34] steps to around the tower that would
[34:36] reach into heaven
[34:38] only trying to pervert Jacob's Ladder
[34:41] which reached from Heavens to the Earth
[34:43] and Angels descending and ascending
[34:46] perverting it
[34:49] are you thinking what I'm thinking I'm
[34:51] not talking about taking over the world
[34:53] but I but in the fact that there's a
[34:56] Jacob's Ladder and we're associated with
[34:58] Jacob who comes much later
[35:01] but yet the Tower of Babel is a
[35:04] perversion of Jacob's Ladder
[35:06] so you've got to you recognize what
[35:08] Satan is able to see inside get over it
[35:10] some of you you got to recognize there's
[35:12] some things that Abe that Satan is able
[35:14] to see and mimic that are only known in
[35:17] the spiritual Realm
[35:18] things that he has some familiarity with
[35:21] an image in heaven the way the heavens
[35:23] would be laid out the way that things
[35:24] would be spread out the way the order
[35:26] and hierarchy way God expresses himself
[35:28] in Satan is trying to be the one to get
[35:30] his story out first
[35:33] and now the Tower of Babel is used to
[35:35] represent something that's Heavenly and
[35:37] spiritual that Jacob sees as a ladder
[35:40] and Angels descending up and down in
[35:42] Satan tries to build it in an Earthly
[35:44] image in the Tower of Babylon
[35:46] that's because Satan works with Earth
[35:49] things and God works in things that are
[35:52] unseen to bring them seen Satan has to
[35:55] work with the he's working tangibly
[35:58] then we see that Satan has a white horse
[36:01] he has a crown
[36:04] and a bride
[36:07] brother bam says the denominational
[36:09] bride here he has a white horse
[36:11] the one that's riding upon Him is this
[36:14] Antichrist spirit with the bow a crown
[36:15] is given to him and he went forth
[36:17] conquering and to conquer and this is a
[36:20] perversion of Truth
[36:23] in Revelations chapter 17 verse 5
[36:27] if you could take this as a
[36:30] difference now
[36:33] because we read in Revelations 19 Christ
[36:36] is riding a white horse
[36:38] he's called faithful and true
[36:40] in righteousness he judges and makes War
[36:43] eyes a flame of fire on his head were
[36:46] many crowns and he had a name written
[36:49] now
[36:50] this
[36:52] the crowning
[36:54] the crown is upon his head the crowns
[36:56] are upon his head
[36:57] and it says in a name written that no
[36:59] man knew himself it brings those symbols
[37:01] very near to each other
[37:03] in Revelations chapter 17 verse 5
[37:06] and upon her forehead
[37:09] was a name written
[37:11] I recognize where this is written it's
[37:13] written on her forehead
[37:14] and to name it in the first name is
[37:18] Mystery
[37:20] Babylon the great the mother of harlots
[37:23] and Abominations of the earth and so
[37:25] it's broke out mystery and I would say
[37:26] mystery Babylon and we combine them
[37:28] together but the way that it was broken
[37:30] out in this translation is Mystery
[37:32] Babylon the great the mother of harlots
[37:35] and Abominations of the Earth
[37:37] this woman is not presented in this
[37:40] picture as having a crown but a name
[37:43] written on her forehead
[37:46] and as we read about her we know that
[37:48] this woman has crowned herself
[37:51] in Revelations 18
[37:52] she's glorified herself she said herself
[37:56] as a queen
[37:58] and in the way that she's portrayed
[38:01] herself in verse 7 of Revelation 17.
[38:03] kind of catches John in awe and he said
[38:07] unto me what wherefore did thou did US
[38:10] thou Marvel
[38:11] I will tell thee The Mystery of the
[38:14] woman
[38:16] and the Beast that carried her
[38:19] the Beast that carrieth her which hath
[38:21] the seven heads and ten horns
[38:25] I just recognize how closely the numbers
[38:29] are matching and
[38:31] and all these representations because we
[38:34] have a lamb that has seven horns and
[38:36] seven eyes
[38:37] and now we have a this woman
[38:40] who has a name a mystery written on her
[38:43] forehead
[38:44] and this Beast that she's riding on
[38:46] that's carrying her has seven heads and
[38:49] ten horns and another numerically
[38:52] they're different and expressions are
[38:53] different but there's these similarities
[38:56] that are that are coming together and
[38:59] she was a Marvel
[39:01] and if I could say she was beautiful
[39:04] powerful
[39:05] charismatic
[39:07] and she's crowned with a name on her
[39:11] forehead
[39:12] this is this is a nomination this is
[39:15] some crowning upon her name
[39:17] I I I I I get the feeling that we're
[39:21] very near whatever this means we're very
[39:24] near closing making really good time
[39:26] today
[39:27] so maybe you might think why didn't he
[39:29] do this when it was 118 a couple Sundays
[39:32] ago
[39:34] now as the Bible tells us upon her
[39:36] forehead was the name written is just
[39:37] describing as verses 7 chapter 17
[39:39] chapter 18. the word tells us the truth
[39:43] behind the mystery
[39:44] tells us the truth behind the crown it's
[39:47] telling us the Sinister nature of the
[39:49] heads and the horns and these things and
[39:51] so as the Bible is writing it it tells
[39:53] us even symbolically it exposes the
[39:56] hidden Mystery behind this woman why are
[39:58] you marveling
[40:00] when we read it or we read it as if the
[40:02] cover is already being pulled off
[40:04] so we need to kind of back up and
[40:06] recognize that before this happens she
[40:09] presents herself according to Matthew 20
[40:11] 24 24 24 24 she expresses herself in a
[40:15] very deceiving way and the Bible's using
[40:17] symbolic language say we're exposing her
[40:20] she's being exposed her power's being
[40:23] uncovered what she is is being made
[40:24] known and it's exposing symbolically in
[40:27] Revelation 17 and 18. the Mystery behind
[40:29] this woman
[40:31] and the Bible shows us the true
[40:33] character and Power
[40:34] of the of what's written on her forehead
[40:38] here's this woman
[40:40] and lest we would Marvel at her beauty
[40:42] and how she's dressed and how she's
[40:45] arrayed and all the elements that make
[40:47] her up and pearls and gold and and Lenin
[40:49] and robes and purple and all the ways
[40:52] that she's fashioned and if that had
[40:54] only been the image that would be
[40:55] expressed why we would have a really
[40:57] good time trying to pull it apart but
[40:58] John as he sees the symbol the angel
[41:01] catches him marveling at her and being
[41:03] in awe and he's saying you need to see
[41:05] what's really behind all this
[41:08] mystery Babylon the great the mother of
[41:10] harlots and Abominations of the Earth
[41:12] the Bible is showing us the character
[41:14] and power behind the name the false part
[41:16] the wicked part
[41:19] and God of this evil age brother bam
[41:20] says she is the devil's bride
[41:23] wrapped in his religious sin loving
[41:26] knowledge of this present evil age
[41:30] to deceive you
[41:33] I mean if she just would only keep the
[41:35] name tag on it would make it so much
[41:37] easier for us
[41:39] right if she would just have the name
[41:42] tag mystery Babylon the great mother of
[41:46] harlots and Abominations of the earth
[41:48] and say well well you know there's no
[41:49] such thing as the bride age don't you go
[41:51] what's that on your
[41:53] oh sure buddy right you should she she's
[41:57] if she just would wear the name tag but
[42:00] she presents herself as the church
[42:03] he presents herself in this in a certain
[42:05] way where she's religious but it's sin
[42:08] loving knowledge of this present age to
[42:11] deceive you he says oh my a whole click
[42:14] or denomination of seducing spirits
[42:18] you don't have to be a denomination all
[42:20] you have to do is be a click
[42:22] you don't need to have the Appalachian
[42:24] nomination of the Blasphemous names and
[42:26] be called by a particular name just
[42:28] become a clique
[42:30] with seducing Spirits by scientific
[42:32] knowledge and a modern civilization
[42:35] this is what is raised up in this hour
[42:37] this is what's portrayed and allele to
[42:39] see in age this is what these seven
[42:41] women are all taken a hold of
[42:44] taking a Hold by and then he continues
[42:46] and Satan will soon same sermon Satan
[42:48] will soon take and I was reading these
[42:50] statements to catch this part
[42:53] I feel like I need to kind of review
[42:54] this for a second
[42:56] they have the image of Christ
[42:58] riding on a white horse and Benny crowns
[43:01] are on his head and a name written that
[43:03] no man knew but he himself
[43:05] and his name is called the word of God
[43:07] now Satan has his own image the bride's
[43:10] rep even as we continue reading
[43:12] Revelations 19 that there's the ones
[43:13] riding with him on white horses so
[43:15] there's there's an image of the pure of
[43:17] the truth faithful and true those riding
[43:19] out with him now Satan has his white
[43:21] horse
[43:22] and he now by deception achieves his
[43:26] bride
[43:27] and if we could catch this image God
[43:30] already had you ordained beforehand
[43:32] Satan rides out conking into conquer to
[43:35] make it up as he goes
[43:37] collecting his subject as he goes God's
[43:39] already ordained it beforehand uh the
[43:42] Satan takes the crown presumptuously
[43:44] with the intent to deceive and he does
[43:46] it he accomplishes his agenda
[43:48] and he's crowned even at that outset
[43:50] wearing a crown
[43:52] given a crown
[43:54] now
[43:56] as Christ has many crowns on his head I
[43:59] want you to recognize the source of the
[44:02] crown of the Antichrist brother man says
[44:04] Satan will soon take his intellectual
[44:05] bride and exalt this great one
[44:08] which is the Antichrist the hierarchies
[44:13] and set him upon a throne
[44:17] and the whole world will wander after
[44:19] him
[44:21] what's being portrayed is that this
[44:22] Fallen church this this Fallen woman
[44:26] is crowning the Antichrist
[44:29] setting him upon a throne exalting him
[44:31] lifting him up this is in the the
[44:33] symbolism this is in the the the way
[44:35] that it's represented symbolically and
[44:37] the false Christ and false prophets at
[44:39] the end time are going to enthrone him
[44:42] they're going to coronate him as the
[44:44] Antichrist spirit is going to be a
[44:46] brother that says incarnate in the
[44:48] people
[44:49] this is the crowning of that Ministry
[44:51] this is the exaltation of that Ministry
[44:53] that they are going to exalt the
[44:55] intellectual bride and the false World
[44:57] system is going to bring it to a throne
[44:59] and bring it to a crowning
[45:02] Revelations 13 1 he says I stood upon
[45:04] the sand of the sea
[45:05] and saw a beast rise up out of the sea
[45:09] and that's the that catch this the CSP
[45:12] are we as represent his people
[45:15] the Antichrist is crowned he's rising up
[45:17] crowned by the people he's coming up out
[45:20] of the sea giving Power by the Sea
[45:22] rising out there's maybe some more
[45:24] symbolism we'll use in the next service
[45:25] I stood upon the sand of the sea and saw
[45:27] a beast rise up out of the sea having
[45:29] seven heads and ten horns
[45:32] this is the same we see the same saying
[45:35] that this Beast that carried this
[45:37] Mystery Woman uh this woman of mystery
[45:39] this Babylon the great this Beast has
[45:42] seven heads and ten horns and upon his
[45:45] horns ten crowns in upon his heads the
[45:49] name of blasphemy
[45:51] recognize again how the crowns are
[45:53] together with names
[45:56] and it speaks of character speaks of
[45:58] power
[46:00] the seven heads we recognize are seven
[46:02] mountains just reading it in the
[46:03] scripture whereas there is one head and
[46:05] one mountain now you have seven heads
[46:08] and they represent Seven Mountains Seven
[46:10] Hills
[46:11] this Beast rising up out of the sea
[46:13] we're just looking at verse one because
[46:14] I know as we read more there's types and
[46:16] symbols of the United States and there's
[46:17] other things it's it's trying to present
[46:19] itself one way but speaks another way
[46:21] you see the images of papal secession
[46:23] and those things and I'm not wanting to
[46:25] get caught up in all those details I
[46:27] think there's just a lot of a lot of
[46:28] information out there on it but he
[46:30] stands upon the sea he sees a beast rise
[46:32] up out of the sea seven heads ten horns
[46:35] the horns have crowns
[46:38] and the heads have names
[46:42] these are Blasphemous names
[46:45] names of blasphemy names of organization
[46:47] names that are given that relate to men
[46:49] names that relate to the things of it
[46:52] names that men knew
[46:54] names that men give names after men
[46:59] these are the names that are given
[47:02] these names that are represented in this
[47:05] in this Beast that this woman is riding
[47:07] on and I want you to recognize how that
[47:10] the names
[47:12] are coming together with the crown
[47:16] and upon his heads were names upon the
[47:19] horns or crowns on Christ's head are
[47:23] many crowns and a name written
[47:28] and it's this Antichrist I think maybe
[47:30] as I realize now the scriptures I have
[47:32] in front of me I'm wanting to see that
[47:35] there's a crowning
[47:37] of the Antichrist by the people
[47:40] that they're the ones that are even at
[47:42] nicaea it was voted upon they made the
[47:45] decision they gave the they gave it over
[47:48] to they made they officiated the
[47:50] marriage they brought it together and
[47:51] he's finding his power in the people
[47:53] finding this they're they're lifting
[47:55] them up they're exalting him they're
[47:57] bringing raising him to this place
[47:59] and in the anointed ones at the end time
[48:02] 's talking about Saint Martin of Tours
[48:05] and there's
[48:07] I was going back and reading in the
[48:09] other histories and other remarkings of
[48:11] the story of Saint Martin
[48:12] and how he cleared cut the Garment in
[48:16] one place and these different
[48:17] Supernatural stories of him that are
[48:19] documented throughout history
[48:22] and I found it remarkable how that many
[48:25] sources quote Martin's Story one way
[48:30] and brother Branham is telling the same
[48:33] story the same way but he in one place
[48:35] he he brings out a greater truth about
[48:37] it
[48:38] and this is he says I want to show you
[48:40] how deceiving the devil is and he's
[48:42] talking about Satan Martin of Tours one
[48:44] day he Saint Martin was setting in a
[48:46] study
[48:47] up come a mighty Angel crown on his head
[48:50] golden shoes on lace around his garments
[48:52] of gold and said Martin do you know me
[48:54] and and remember it wasn't Martin do you
[48:56] know me right
[48:58] it was Martin do you know me and he says
[49:01] he said I'm your lord and savior I'm the
[49:05] one that saved you worship me Martin
[49:08] but that Prophet knowing there's a
[49:09] little something strange here kept
[49:11] looking at him he said Martin I'm your
[49:13] savior Jesus Christ worship me don't you
[49:15] know me Martin remember I'm telling the
[49:17] story to recognize how deceiving Satan
[49:19] is
[49:21] and how he has these these clicks of
[49:23] seducing spirits
[49:25] and he said
[49:27] and Martin kept looking at him the
[49:29] scripture running through his mind he
[49:32] said Satan get away from me
[49:35] you got a crown on your head this is the
[49:37] part where brother Brown emphasizes this
[49:38] a little bit differently he says and the
[49:40] word of God says his Saints will crown
[49:43] him at the End of the Age
[49:47] there's that's the reason why I read
[49:48] that is to see how that there's
[49:50] symbolically there's this representation
[49:52] how that Christ isn't snatching his
[49:55] crown
[49:56] it's not Christ crowning himself
[49:58] necessarily but there is a the saints
[50:01] that are crowning him he says at the End
[50:03] of the Age
[50:04] that there's a time where it's being
[50:06] made up it's being built up the jewels
[50:08] are being made up and the elements to
[50:10] the crown are being made up and so it
[50:12] takes this process of time for the
[50:13] crowning to be complete and for it to
[50:15] take shape through seven Church ages
[50:17] Satan's representative Revelation 6 2
[50:19] the very beginning riding out on a white
[50:21] horse he's already got his crown because
[50:23] he's going to use power to deceive to
[50:25] make up the jewels of his crown so he
[50:28] presupposes himself as king to give the
[50:31] authority and the inference of authority
[50:33] to bind people under him but Christ is
[50:35] willing to remain the lamb until the
[50:38] crown is made up and then have the
[50:40] people his own bride crown him
[50:46] and then he says wouldn't that have been
[50:48] Pentecostal bait
[50:54] really
[50:55] that whole that the way that it can
[50:57] appear the way that it could show itself
[50:59] he says wouldn't have that been
[51:00] Pentecostal babe he says watch that word
[51:03] brother that's where it pays
[51:06] that Pentecost obey is saying the thing
[51:07] that kind of catches the Pentecostal
[51:09] mindset draws them offside they would
[51:11] have snapped a hold of that real quick
[51:12] worshiped it praised it rejoiced in it
[51:14] those fabricated signs and those
[51:16] different things that get people worked
[51:17] up he says that would have been
[51:19] Pentecostal bait but watch the word
[51:21] there's where it pays
[51:23] and Christ said that there as Martin is
[51:26] been kind of challenged by this image of
[51:29] this angel
[51:30] and he recognizes the crown at this
[51:32] dispensation this time he sees the crown
[51:34] and brother Branham puts this in the
[51:37] heart of Saint Martin he kind of brings
[51:38] this this is the the response of Saint
[51:40] Martin of tourists that Crown is
[51:42] untimely
[51:44] because Christ is going to be crowned by
[51:46] his Saints
[51:48] Christ
[51:49] crowning has to do with him making up
[51:52] his jewels Christ crowding has something
[51:54] to do with the finishing up of his body
[51:56] he can't be crowned prematurely this
[51:58] crowning that has to take place he says
[52:01] what happened at the end of his age and
[52:03] the Saints will crown him
[52:05] so recognize that image and on his head
[52:07] were many crowns brother Branham says in
[52:10] the second seal he's been crowned by his
[52:13] Saints
[52:15] this is a different coronation
[52:18] Satan has taken his crown or his
[52:21] authority presumptuously
[52:22] he's posturing he's he's using Force
[52:25] he's using intimidation he's trying to
[52:28] show you uh he's the one that's thinking
[52:31] to take over the world he's the one
[52:32] that's wanting to ride out and Conquer
[52:34] but Christ's crowning is the true
[52:36] coronation
[52:38] this crowning as the name written in the
[52:40] forehead of This Woman This mystery of
[52:43] the woman this name written had a
[52:44] mystery and it spoke of her power and
[52:47] her character that's diabolic and it's
[52:49] from below this crowning of Christ and
[52:51] this name written it represents his
[52:53] character and his power
[52:56] I know we went over this in on rewards
[52:58] in Revelations 4 4.
[53:01] this is the scene that's being set
[53:03] before the lamb
[53:06] in the time that he's described called
[53:09] the line of the tribe of Judah
[53:11] the crowning of the Lamb
[53:13] it's that time of this crowning it's
[53:15] this time of this coronation and the
[53:16] round about The Throne we're four in 20
[53:18] seats and upon the seats I saw Four and
[53:21] Twenty Elders sitting clothed in white
[53:23] Raymond and they had on their heads
[53:25] crowns of gold
[53:27] it's a Golden Crown brother Brian said
[53:29] the gold of God is christ-like character
[53:31] remember your character is the only
[53:33] thing you take with you
[53:34] these Elders have crowns of gold
[53:38] it's a reflection of christ-like
[53:41] character
[53:42] that's what they took with and they took
[53:44] their character with them this is their
[53:45] testimonies they sit there round about
[53:46] The Throne they had on their heads
[53:48] crowns of gold and then in verse 10 the
[53:51] four and 24 Elders fall down before him
[53:53] that sat on the throne
[53:55] and worship him that liveth forever and
[53:58] ever
[53:59] recognize how that Beast system has how
[54:02] it tries to perpetuate and live forever
[54:04] and ever but this is one who doesn't die
[54:06] and rise again or die and rise again and
[54:08] die and rise again he's the one that was
[54:09] dead rose again and lives forever and
[54:11] ever and cast their crowns Before the
[54:14] Throne
[54:15] now this is this crown that represented
[54:18] symbolically they're casting their
[54:21] crowns to him
[54:22] to this to this one they're casting
[54:24] their crowd saying Thou Art Worthy O
[54:26] Lord to receive glory and honor and
[54:30] Power
[54:31] for thou Hast created all things and for
[54:34] thy pleasure they are and were created
[54:39] this taking of a crown
[54:42] and this acknowledgment of the four and
[54:45] 24 Elders as they have these crowns and
[54:47] I'm just using it in type of this gold
[54:50] this gold of God which is christ-like
[54:52] character a crown of gold is some crown
[54:54] on these men's lives and their
[54:55] testimonies and in this moment they
[54:57] recognize I can't I can't claim this
[55:01] as my own
[55:03] not to you alone is there glory honor
[55:06] and power that this this I have not
[55:09] earned of my own this I have not made of
[55:11] my own this is not this character is not
[55:14] my own character this testimony is not
[55:16] my own testimony but I take my crown and
[55:20] I'm casting it to you and I'm giving my
[55:22] crown and may we see that in the
[55:24] scriptural image in brother Brown in a
[55:26] couple places says he's been done
[55:29] crowned by his Saints
[55:32] that there's a crowning that we give
[55:35] Christ
[55:37] there's a crowning that takes place
[55:40] in Isaiah chapter 62
[55:43] we'll read verses one to three and not
[55:45] to verse 12. he says for Zion's sake
[55:49] will I not hold my peace
[55:51] and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest
[55:54] until the righteousness thereof go forth
[55:57] his brightness and the Salvation thereof
[55:59] is a lamp that burneth
[56:02] there's his intent
[56:05] even through the church ages
[56:09] and it says in the Gentiles shall see
[56:10] thy brightness
[56:12] and all Kings thy Glory
[56:15] and thou shalt be called by a new name
[56:19] which the mouth of the Lord shall name
[56:21] out of his mouth which proceedeth
[56:24] as a new name which the mouth of the
[56:27] Lord shall name and now verse 3 Thou
[56:30] shalt also be a Crown of Glory in the
[56:34] hand of the Lord
[56:35] and a royal diadem in the hand of God
[56:40] the diadem is a crown
[56:42] one is a Crown of Glory in the hand of
[56:44] the Lord said again in a Royal diadem in
[56:48] the hand of God
[56:50] as the Bible said that I know them and
[56:53] no man shall pluck them out of my hand
[56:56] in no man is able to pluck them out of
[56:58] the father's hand
[56:59] and it says that a Crown of Glory in the
[57:02] hand of the Lord a royal diadem in the
[57:05] hand of God
[57:07] and this is the image that last week was
[57:09] just washing over me
[57:11] and I was going to stop by Burger King
[57:12] and get a crown
[57:14] and then I forgot to ask
[57:16] I forgot to ask if there was a crown
[57:17] that happened to me laying around the
[57:18] house
[57:19] and if you could just imagine this
[57:22] that there's a crowd it symbolizing a
[57:25] crown in his hand is very unique
[57:27] the crown is in his hand
[57:30] and the crown now
[57:32] the crown in the hand I want you to
[57:33] recognize there's going to be a change
[57:35] in this position where the crown in his
[57:38] hand is now placed upon his head
[57:43] and there there this is again I'm saying
[57:45] in type let those that are in his hand
[57:48] and they're going to be a crown in the
[57:49] hand of the Lord a royal die dim in the
[57:51] hand of God but there's got to come a
[57:53] time of The Headstone coming to the body
[57:56] there's got to come a capping there's
[57:59] got to come a crowning and the crown
[58:01] that is in his hand there comes a time
[58:03] when the crown is placed upon the head
[58:07] oh Hallelujah
[58:09] and recognize what this looks like in
[58:11] scripture seven women one bride and it
[58:15] says in Proverbs 12 4 a virtuous woman
[58:17] is a crown to her husband
[58:20] Hallelujah
[58:22] there comes a time where the very
[58:24] engagement ring that has been slipped on
[58:26] her finger there Comes A Time of the
[58:29] Union where the one that has been given
[58:31] the promise in the hand is going to be
[58:33] placed as a crown upon his head a
[58:36] virtuous woman is a crown to her husband
[58:39] oh maybe we'll get into it the next few
[58:41] service but she that maketh ashamed as
[58:43] rotten in his bones
[58:46] seven women
[58:47] one
[58:49] one bride
[58:51] a Godly wife
[58:53] meditate on this for the next few days a
[58:55] Godly wife is a crown to her husband
[58:58] and if a virtuous woman is a crown or a
[59:00] husband the bride is the crown to Christ
[59:03] she's the glory of Christ those that are
[59:06] those that are in his hand he crowns
[59:08] he's crowned with
[59:10] this The Virtuous Woman is a crown to
[59:13] her husband
[59:15] recognize what brother Branham writes in
[59:17] the church age book this is and I'll
[59:20] I'll even say this
[59:22] and uh let's take a deep breath
[59:28] many if they didn't know it was already
[59:30] said in the church age book would think
[59:31] this came from the catechism
[59:35] the True Church of Jesus Christ the
[59:37] bride is likened to pure gold
[59:40] her righteousness is his righteousness
[59:42] her attributes are his own glorious
[59:45] attributes her identity is found in him
[59:49] what he is she is to reflect what he has
[59:53] she is to manifest
[59:55] now if you could
[59:56] ponder that a little bit we could say
[59:59] his his
[1:00:00] but what's on Earth
[1:00:02] her her
[1:00:04] what what's going to be expressed
[1:00:06] where's this image coming from the True
[1:00:07] Church of Jesus Christ is likened to
[1:00:09] pure gold he says there's no fault in
[1:00:13] her
[1:00:15] she's all glorious within and without
[1:00:18] this mystery Babylon could present
[1:00:21] herself without his glorious but her
[1:00:23] within she's glorious from beginning to
[1:00:26] ending she is the work of her Lord and
[1:00:28] all his works are perfect here's this
[1:00:31] phrase in fact in her is summed up and
[1:00:36] manifested the Eternal wisdom and
[1:00:38] purpose of God
[1:00:40] in hers the sum of the Eternal purpose
[1:00:43] of God in her in fact in her summed up
[1:00:46] the Eternal purpose of God
[1:00:49] in fact in her is summed up when vital
[1:00:51] musicians to come in her is summed up
[1:00:55] and manifested
[1:00:57] the Eternal wisdom
[1:00:59] of God
[1:01:01] the Eternal wisdom of God is summed up
[1:01:04] in her
[1:01:06] I want to make this very very practical
[1:01:09] I'm not going to do it today
[1:01:12] I want to make it I I'm leading and just
[1:01:14] been building to things very very
[1:01:16] practical and I love just how much of a
[1:01:18] broad Foundation we have so we realize
[1:01:20] these things are rooted in truths these
[1:01:22] things are based upon principles and
[1:01:24] found founded on very clear things
[1:01:27] in the bride is summed up and manifested
[1:01:30] the Eternal wisdom of God
[1:01:35] in Proverbs Chapter 4 verses 7 8 and 9
[1:01:37] just catch this image as we close
[1:01:39] wisdom is the principle thing
[1:01:42] therefore get wisdom
[1:01:45] and with all that getting good
[1:01:46] understanding
[1:01:49] and I began to look at this as I see in
[1:01:53] the bride and brother Ramen future home
[1:01:56] takes the stages of the earth which you
[1:01:58] could just see through scripture
[1:02:00] and and there's there's others who'd
[1:02:03] postulated diagrammed and charted these
[1:02:06] things about the stages of the Earth
[1:02:08] and if you catch you don't need to go
[1:02:11] look at what others have done but let me
[1:02:13] just say it for you brother Branham
[1:02:14] changes drastically what men had probed
[1:02:17] at before
[1:02:18] and it completely changes and places
[1:02:22] things and he says that something really
[1:02:24] inspired him so he went and tried to
[1:02:25] find things and he found places where
[1:02:26] things were given and definitions were
[1:02:28] given and and his inspiration is leading
[1:02:30] me he's always it bringing it back to
[1:02:31] the word and there's this image that's
[1:02:34] being portrayed where he sees God doing
[1:02:36] stages to the Earth
[1:02:38] right
[1:02:40] and he says now it's the stages of the
[1:02:42] individual
[1:02:43] and what God does the individual does
[1:02:45] the Earth and he's seeing this these
[1:02:47] Reflections and then there's this stage
[1:02:49] of the future home that isn't
[1:02:52] necessarily in those threes but it's the
[1:02:55] final product he forms the wheat outside
[1:02:56] the three stages there's a final product
[1:02:58] that comes out of it and as he's looking
[1:03:01] at that this bride this bride has been
[1:03:03] portrayed Christ is bride future home of
[1:03:06] the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly
[1:03:07] bride it's all being portrayed
[1:03:09] and as it goes through that process what
[1:03:13] what I began to recognize I just kind of
[1:03:15] was washing over me and this and this
[1:03:17] channel last week wisdom is the
[1:03:19] principal thing therefore get wisdom
[1:03:22] with all that getting get understanding
[1:03:25] and I caught it from the from the
[1:03:28] perspective of God
[1:03:30] out of you
[1:03:32] you are what he's achieving
[1:03:34] you are what he's cultivating
[1:03:36] you're what he wants to get
[1:03:39] not that he wants a great beautiful
[1:03:40] kingdom he doesn't want this and he
[1:03:42] doesn't want that in all the pretense of
[1:03:44] it with what all is getting he wants to
[1:03:46] understand he wants wisdom and the Bible
[1:03:48] says exalt her
[1:03:50] and she shall promote thee
[1:03:52] she shall bring thee to honor when thou
[1:03:55] Embrace her
[1:03:57] and I saw this image of Christ
[1:04:01] raising up his bride lifting her up
[1:04:05] washing her he doesn't beat her down he
[1:04:08] doesn't bully her she he raises her up
[1:04:10] he lifts her up he washes her he's she
[1:04:14] he's exalting her and then what does she
[1:04:16] do she promotes him
[1:04:18] she lifts him up and she says oh to you
[1:04:22] be your glory honor and power oh and the
[1:04:25] image of these Elders being promoted to
[1:04:27] have a crown on their head and then what
[1:04:29] is it they do with their promotion they
[1:04:31] say sorry this is yours Oh Glory to you
[1:04:35] all power to you this attributes not my
[1:04:38] own it's yours he's like this is what I
[1:04:40] gave you this is what you gave me I
[1:04:43] don't take ownership I don't take glory
[1:04:45] and then it says she shall give to thine
[1:04:48] head an ornament of Grace
[1:04:52] Crown of Glory shall she deliver them oh
[1:04:56] oh for the joy which was set before him
[1:04:58] Christ knew he'd take the crown one day
[1:05:01] Satan offered it to him in the form of
[1:05:03] Kingdoms and he would have taken all
[1:05:04] those wives but he had In His Image one
[1:05:07] day there would be a bride that would be
[1:05:09] his crown one day the bride would
[1:05:12] deliver him the crowns
[1:05:14] [Music]
[1:05:16] she shall give thine head an ornament of
[1:05:18] Grace
[1:05:19] and a Crown of Glory shall she deliver
[1:05:21] thee this is why he's there writing
[1:05:26] with one head
[1:05:27] and many crowns
[1:05:30] is we've taken it we've given it all to
[1:05:32] him
[1:05:33] it's it's fully identified and placed in
[1:05:35] him
[1:05:37] and you're represented in this beautiful
[1:05:39] picture
[1:05:42] of Christ
[1:05:43] you're riding on a white horse
[1:05:45] then there's the impersonator
[1:05:50] impersonator of this
[1:05:52] Beast
[1:05:53] this Antichrist Spirit lifting up
[1:05:55] empowering a woman and now it gets real
[1:05:58] practical
[1:06:00] there's a kingdom power and a kingdom
[1:06:01] character
[1:06:03] of God
[1:06:05] and you can go listen to unveiling of
[1:06:07] God and God of this evil age in some of
[1:06:09] these places and where Bear Brown is
[1:06:11] going to bring these very scriptures
[1:06:12] into view and the challenge is that
[1:06:14] we've got to live like that Kingdom
[1:06:18] and recognize the spirit that's making
[1:06:20] women and making men
[1:06:22] after the things of this world
[1:06:24] could you stand together with me
[1:06:26] [Music]
