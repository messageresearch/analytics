TRANSCRIPT
========================================
continue on the subject of i am an open book and we on wednesday we were we felt it'd just be too exciting uh to be in the new place to just jump into a part four of something and so with the newness uh maybe be gone for some of us and the strangeness gone for some of us i just feel that liberty to go right back to where we were last sunday on this subject of i am an open book i'm going to read from the masterpiece to start this was the last statement i used last time on this subject and i want you to kind of catch this because we've been using statements of the bible became a new book when the seals are opened and so this is i'm not i've just kind of kept it open in my heart maybe to just follow the leading and take some liberty maybe to expound upon what my overall aim has been in looking at this and maybe this statement will open that up he says he speaking of christ fulfilled the old testament so christ is the fulfillment of the old testament now it's the new testament another piece to be fulfilled so we've looked at how christ fulfilled one part there's another part to be fulfilled you think about that the old testament may read like a historical record but it was actually prophecy the new testament in many maze many ways may read like a historical record but it's prophecy so he says see the new and the old is husband and wife i mean that just that really clarifies it right there the new and oldest husband and wife it took the old to for show the new christ come the masterpiece to fulfill that christ the masterpiece came to fulfill the old testament now his bride will fulfill everything that's in the new testament another masterpiece is in making that's quite a statement to take christ who is the masterpiece and then lift up the bride to the place of being another masterpiece in the making and and there's a lot of ways that that even that line of thinking can be uh uh criticized in the sense oh well that sounds like catholicism but realize catholicism took truth and perverted it and so this the thought and the premise that there is going to be a bride who's going to fulfill the new testament and going to be a another masterpiece in the making is just the culmination of paul saying that the church is his body it's the fullness of him that filleth all in all and so that's what i'm uh looking at in terms of i am an open book it's something that you can say and in what we see unfold to the old testament into christ i want you to recognize unfolds through the new testament into this last days when god raises up a bride now there's going to be some things i think there's going to be some scriptures that might be review that we've gone over before but i want to use hebrews chapter 1 just to start our going further into this but keep that in mind the bride is the new testament she's the fulfillment of the new testament hebrews chapter 1 verse 1 we'll just kind of go through this to verse 5. i might make reference to a few other scriptures very quickly but says god who at sundry times and in diverse manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets we're not going to get into what sundry times and diverse manners are what i want you just to recognize the past god spoke by the prophets and the words of the prophets were memorialized in their in the scrolls memorialized in scripture so the words of the prophet god's speaking by the prophets there's an oral tradition then there's a written tradition and there's actually a tren a writing down books are written the word lord moved upon the writers of these scrolls and these scriptures and to the jews they had what they called the book they had scrolls they had scriptures and jesus makes reference in matthew 26 something transpires and he says that all this was done that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled so think of that wording scriptures of the prophets the writing the the the memorializing the putting down into record it's the record of the prophets and then on the road to uh well then jesus in luke chapter 4 verse 21 he takes the book and he takes the scroll of isaiah and he unfolds it he begins to read he says this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears what was it the scripture of isaiah the writing the record of isaiah then on the road to emmaus it says that he took begin with moses and all the prophets and expounded to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself so they had a written word that is rolled up in these scrolls it's this writing they believed in the prophets they believed that their words were inspired they believed that that was a record from god as the spirit moved upon the prophets to write it and they had we called the old testament but to them that was their book this was their scriptures these were their scrolls it's what the scribes transcribed and wrote down and copied over and over and over again and this is what pharisees became experts of and this is what even some of the oral traditions that begin to be added it's compared the sadducees and different ones comparing oral tradition to the written word and this was to them their book that they looked to to give them guidance to memorialize the works of god and his promises to them now when christ is standing there what i want you to realize is their written word had become living word because then the next verse then it says that god at sundry times spoke by the fa unto the fathers by the prophets that's what's given you their bible and he says hath in these last days verse 2 spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the world so this is hebrews chapter 1 verse 2 who he hath appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the world he's speaking of jesus christ so now he says he at one time spoke by the prophets now he speaks by his son the son is now speaking and there's a timely timely slide there remember if you want to give we can start taking up more offerings even while i'm preaching hey first one to donate right now i'll take to lunch here we go smash that subscribe button make sure you turn on notifications oh look at this sister so-and-so just denied a thousand dollars let's turn it into a live uh twitch is that what it is twitch stream now monetize that this will be a real maybe a good platform we can switch to and monetize our services there's half in these last days spoken at us by his son so now he's comparing he spoke by the prophets before but now he speaks by his son the words of the prophets became the old testament but now when the sun begins to speak what i want you to realize and this is the part to me i just started really feeding on last week and energize me excited me now the spoken word because christ is now speaking because now he's speaking by the son now the spoken word complained the written word and these things are working together so he has they have the written word but now the spoken word comes and the spoken word will not contradict the written word the living word cannot contradict the written word the and so here's the written word now the spoken word is is is making plain the written word and this is what on the road to emmaus and we've used this previously so it just kind of gives us that cause uh just to refer back to it that after he had was made known in the breaking of the bread they said did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us by the way and while he opened to us the scriptures so here he's speaking and it's the spoken word making plain the written word and it's written it's there but now as he opens it up he takes something says but all this was done that it might be fulfilled as was written by the prophets and the scriptures of the prophets to be fulfilled this is remarkable because it's the spoken word and the living word making plain what had already been written so he hath in these last days spoken of this by his son and this is kind of the the unfolding now from he spoke by prophets now he's speaking by his son and then he says of the son who be in the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high being made so much better than the angels as he hath by inheritance attained a more excellent name than they this excellent name it's a concept that we could veer off into and explore to uh great benefit but this excellent name has to do with sun this position this relationship for under which of the angels said he had any time what angel did he ever say you're my son he says thou art my son this day have i begotten thee he never said it to an angel and again i will be a father to him and he shall be to me a son this is referring back to the prophecy to the written word and some of the psalms so christ now is the express image of god he is in the brightness of the glory of god that's one thing we've been trying to make this relation to you have the i am that spoke to moses now christ is that i am it's the same god now but christ is the express image of his person this is a complete different relationship than any prophet had to god this is a different relationship than any prophet had to the people he says he is in the express image of his person brother brahma in hebrews chapter 5 and 6 part 1 he said god then became in another type of a tabernacle and that tabernacle was who jesus and god was inside of jesus and he was hid amen god was inside of jesus and yet the veil the flesh hid god because they looked at him and it wasn't say oh of course god this is god veiled in flesh they said you being a man not over 50. it says that before abraham was i am and they took exception to him because his appearance and his physical stature but yet god was hid in that simplicity so he said he was hid but he was reconciling the world to himself by his expressions so this was the this was god expressing himself attributes were being displayed and the part i really want you to key on here is christ revealed god this is what christ did christ revealed god now i will come back to this prophets god spoke to prophets and god's works were made manifest to the people there's glimpses that they could get they could understand his heart and recognize he's certainly a god of detail because he asked him which fabric could mix with other fabrics and where they could wash these pots and what meats they could eat definitely a god of detail and they could extract things about god as a righteous god and certain things were an abomination to them but they the word of god was expressed to the prophets and there was a lot of foreshadowing in that of christ i want to come back to this a lot of it was pointing forward to christ who had come then when christ comes he reveals god that phrase christ revealed god i'm really feeding off the principles of christ is the mystery of god revealed so christ revealed god now in john chapter 14 verses 5 to 9 we've been reading these scriptures lately often it says if you had known me you would you should have known my father also and from henceforth you know him and have seen him maybe a startling phrase when they know he's speaking of god so philip says lord show us the father and it sufficeth us he said if you've he's just said you have seen him but he says just show us he says have i been so long time with you and yet hast thou not known me philip he that have seen me have seen the father and how sayest thou then show us the father believeth thou not that i am in the father and the father in me i want you to recognize this relationship the words that i speak unto you i speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works this is a remarkable relationship he's saying the father that dwells in me he's creating this uh this connection and this union between the father and the son he's saying the father dwells in me there's this personal intimate fusion and connection he's the one that's doing the works god is in me veiled in my flesh god has hidden me he's doing the works so it's my works that are revealing to you who god is so he says believe me that i am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very work's sake believe me for my word's sake because i say so but also believe me for my very work's sake verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also this is to him that believeth then he says and greater works than thee shall he do now how where are those greater works going to come from how are there going to be greater works because i go into my father so there is a work there's works that can be done because through faith and through belief but then and i'm wanting maybe just to kind of wet your appetite for the these scriptures greater works than thee shall he do because i go unto my father so there's greater works that are prophesied there's works that are done by faith then there's greater works because he goes unto the father that these scriptures are telling us something very striking and brother brahm looks at these scriptures and he says god became expressed in the person of jesus christ jesus was the express image of god jesus was the express image of god it's the father dwelling in me he does the work so now let's just with this scripture in mind and pondering this the father is dwelling in me he's doing the work so that whenever you've seen me you've seen the father something about christ standing there before him speaking acting living breathing performing miracles but also just living his everyday life we might focus more on the miracles oh he walked on water that's god but you realize god can make himself very very small and it was god in the interpersonal relationships it was god in the wisdom it was god in the eating it was god in his communications and his associations it's god making himself known because he does refer he does take phillip and he says we've been with each other for a long time and we can look into the scriptures and just see glimpses but he's saying i've been walking with you i've been living with you you've watched my manner of life you see the way that i speak you see how i treat people you know how i talk to you and how we commune one with another this you're experiencing god and you're experiencing his attributes when you've experienced me because i am the expressed image of god now i want to take a step back from that and and put it this way the old testament was a divine record of god dealing with israel it's a divine right it's an actual record it's the record the scriptures speak of uh the record of the prophets they have recorded this down and we understand that in this record of god dealing with israel there were shadows of things to come in the sacrifices types of things to come even in the feast days and there's all these different glimpses we have and there's a lot of pointing forward a lot of prophecy contained in the paschal lamb in exodus 12 and 13 when god institutes the passover feast and we that is that is god foreshadowing his son to come as a lamb as a sacrifice so these very specific detailed things that are in the word of god it's god pointing forward to a time where christ would come express image of god and i don't have this on the slide i just want to read it very quickly god brother bram says god who on occasions would manifest his presence by the cloud or pillar fire that struck fear in the hearts of men this god whose heart characteristics were made known only by revelation of words to the prophets now became emmanuel god with us declaring himself wow that's a write that down you know uh put a nice font on it and maybe some barn wood in the background a little bit add some depth put a nice filter over it and forward it to everybody right put it on your whatsapp status that's a statement this one god whose heart characteristics were only known by revelation of words through the prophets you could only know things about god as the prophet spoke by divine inspiration he says now he becomes not god above us but god with us in christ and now that god is indwelling in his son he says he's declaring himself and this there's there's this beautiful symmetry from the old testament to the new testament even from genesis to revelation as we took a lot of time to explore some time ago as a church and here in the it says in genesis 1 1 in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth what a beautiful revelation right there seed in it always from the beginning in the beginning god created the heavens which is the type of the bridegroom and the earth which is the type of the bride in the very beginning he's already telling us foreshadowing what his story is going to be in the beginning god created the heavens it's the opening of the old testament and then when john comes to write his record he says in the beginning was the word and so he connects the in the beginning of the old testament now he's picking up within the beginning was the word and the word was god and the word uh it was with god it's in the the word is god and and he says things he gives us kind of john the baptist and he comes to this uh this statement that it's that word that was made flesh in jesus christ it comes later says and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and so this is in the beginning god now john says in the beginning the word and you have the old testament opens up with god the word but now the new testament is that word made flesh in jesus christ and brother bram says the very substance of god was made flesh and dwelt among us the great spirit god unto which no man could approach which no man had seen or could behold was now tabernacled in flesh and dwelt among men expressing the fullness of god to men moses and all his glory could not express the fullness of god to men david and even his heart which is like and unto god god's own heart i could not express the fullness of god to men but the substance of god who man could not approach who had not seen could not behold was now tabernacled in flesh among men expressing the fullness of god to men if you're jotting down notes put a little star do something to kind of highlight that because that's something i want you to be able to come back to later he's saying it's god the fullness of god in flesh among declaring the attributes of god to men and then as brother branham said emmanuel god with us was declaring himself john says it in john 1 18 no man has seen god at any time the only begotten son which paul was saying which angel was ever called son the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he hath declared him that word there declare i often point out that it means to unfold as a narrative and it means to and and i use that to make you recognize it's not just like a paul revere right in the midnight hours saying the british are coming the british are coming and that one moment there's this declaration made but it's more to his life his manner of living the way that he uh his it's his whole the whole thing and to declare means to thoroughly explain and make clear he have thoroughly explained and made clear the father there's definitely a paradox there right because here he is declaring plainly god thoroughly explaining god and what do they do they crucify him so there's a paradox there but this is god manifested in his son and it's this culmination of the prophet's prophecies in first john chapter 1 verses 1 to 3 it says that which is from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon this is the sun that paul talked about that god has spoken to us now in their days they're looking at very real john's ryan said i've heard them speak watched them live i've seen the miracles our hands have handled of the word of life we've heard the word of life we've seen the word of life we've looked upon it we've our hands have handled them the word of life says for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us beautiful dynamics because john could say i've been with him i've handled them this word of life life was manifested to us i've seen it now i'm bearing witness unto you and makes a statement and i show unto you that eternal life you can already see where this is going they've seen it now he's saying i shown you eternal life which is with the father and was manifested under us now he's a conduit he has this burning desire as life was manifested to me through the sun i likewise want to be faithful to show the same fidelity to god and his nature and characteristics and i also want to manifest to you this eternal life that was manifested unto us that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you what i've seen what i've heard i'm a true witness i declare unto you that you also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son jesus christ this is life was manifest this is god being revealed brother brahman said when god was truly revealed he was manifested in the flesh he that hath seen me hath seen the father when god is revealed he's manifested in the flesh you can't god is not an epiphany alone he's not just a thought he's not an imagination you say well i've had a i've had a revelation of god i've got this image of god well then it has to it has to manifest in flesh if i could just use it this way you ever get a revelation of your healing it manifests in your flesh yeah if you had a if you had a broken arm and you got a revelation all of a sudden it was going to be amended guess what it's going to be mended so it's when god is revealed it's manifested in flesh now just again pause let's look at it as from an overview again maybe coming back to what i said just a moment ago but the scriptures then the bible i want you to kind of catch on this thought the bible the old testament was made flesh in jesus christ so god inspired the written record now god is oh revealing that record he's he he makes it flesh in jesus christ his life the life of christ was an open book it was to explaining he had declared the father he's explaining he's making clear the father so christ and i want you to make this this make the connection of the israelites to uh their the old testament to the scrolls to the scriptures christ was the revelation of god to the people of the old testament right that shouldn't be maybe a foreign concept but christ christ is the revelation of god to the people that the old testament very quickly identifies you look at the beginning of the the book it kind of gives context as to why we're here and then well why did god uh call abraham well he he wanted to have a people and the old testament is a record of abraham and all his children all his seed after him because from him is going to come the seed of the woman prophesied in genesis 3 15. so that one comes to the people of that book he comes to those people of the old testament and that's a pattern for us then as the prophets were sent to israel as the promises were given to israel as the messiah was to come to israel as they were to have their physical possession in a physical land and receive a physical messiah it gives a shadow and a type and a pattern for us and we can say that even that coming of the messiah it unfolds through the the process of conception to birth even until the day that the holy ghost fell on pentecost this is all related to that that time and coming of christ and the purchase of salvation and the sending back of his spirit and his ascension into heaven it kind of encapsulates this whole thing that the prophets are pointing to about the messiah now i want to make this statement and i hope it becomes clear to you in these quotes i want to read the coming of christ was the climax for the jews if they didn't recognize it it was and there was it was one of those things where you wait you wait wait for the moment the great climactic moment and then all of a sudden you look away just for a moment and you look back and it's happened you missed it and that's what israel did they looked away they've been waiting for this they've been waiting for this they've been waiting for this and all of a sudden they look away and it's gone this was the coronation christ coming was the crowning of their scriptures all the scrolls that they had laid out and they had all these scrolls laying there christ comes as the climax i can say this way the capstone to everything the prophets had written amen it was their their capstone their crowning of their scriptures of their bible and paul is touching on this in galatians chapter 4 verses 1 to 5. he says now i say that the heir as long as he is a child differeth nothing from a servant though he be lord of all but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father now he's drawing from tradition of a son born into a family taught and trained until the father sets a time until a particular time that the father has designated that the child that he is adopted so it's not a change of relationship it's position it's placing so then he's speaking of the jews he says even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of the time was come now he's speaking he's speaking in present tense for him he's speaking as historically jews speaking for those to whom the promises were given and he says but when the fullness of the time was come that's a remarkable statement god sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem that them that were under the law because they were under bondage to the elements of the law they were had tutors and governors until the time appointed father to redeem them that were under that we might receive the adoption of sons now this is there was an adoption that pertains israel it's important sometimes to make that difference between the adoption of israel and the adoption that brother branham teaches us in the message of the hour so here he's saying there's this and we read it last time there's an adoption that pertains to israel paul is talking about this that when christ came he was made of a woman made under the law to redeem those of us israel who was under the law that we might receive our placing in the word of god that was promised to us when we received the law that was promised us by the prophets that was promised to us in all the word that was written so we have these great wonderful precious promises given to us and he says in the fullness of time the fullness of time was come god sent forth the son the fullness of time is that time appointed by god because he says until the time appointed the father so he's making that connection there's this adoption until the time appointed the father so he says now when the fullness of time was come god sent forth his son the fullness of time is the end of a dispensation some time period where god is an administrative administration a dispensing of rules or authority or wisdom is that this in the fullness of time had come there's this end of dispensation so what paul is referring to is the end of the jewish church state paul is referring to the end of the law it says when the fullness of time was come this is the time that the prophet specified would come this is the time that god intended all those mosaic elements and institutions to reach he gave the sacrifices he gave the the feast he gave all these observances all these ordinances and he gave them to be to a particular time and god instituted them and said they'll be in full force and effect until this time but god had determined beforehand that they would go no further so i want you to can you catch that concept in your minds that god had determined the time now in this dispensation there's this jewish church there's there's the mosaic all there's sacrifices there's priesthoods and these things are going to be in effect and he says that until a time appointed the father so in this dispensation god had appointed that these things would be in effect but only until a certain time and then once you reach that time once you come to that point and you've reached this time he says it comes to here and it goes no further so paul was saying in the fullness of time we've spanned this gap we finished the course we've done what god said we had to do during this time period but now it reaches to here and it goes no further so paul's looking like it's filled up it's over it's finished now he speaks by his son now he sent forth his son and romans 10 4 says for christ is the end of the law there it is right there christ christ is the end of the law it says for righteousness to everyone that believeth because you know jew could argue right now no we keep the law we keep the law but christ is the end of the law for everyone that believeth now the end there the word there means the aim the purpose the end to which all things relate he he is the end of the law in that the law was related to him christ was the aim of the law christ was the purpose of the law remember we read in romans 15 that he was the confirmation of the promises to the prophets christ came and confirmed the covenant confirmed the promises christ was the very scope and the very aim of the the very design of the law it spoke to that if even if you just look at it this way the law was given so man could just try to live and i know maybe in a little different context but the law in one sense just spoke the fact that you needed a christ you needed a sacrifice you needed a redeemer no matter how you look at it if you're looking at it in the right way from whatever perspective this you have to see christ because he is the very design of the law christ is the end of the law the law was given to israel the law was given to the jews in the fullness of time there was a there was a point where a dispensation had ended brother branham says in the message god's eye what a remarkable title and he's the scripture romans 15 8 says he came and confirmed these promises confirmation he says then as jesus confirmed listen we are making great time today you'll have plenty of time to avoid all the uh the the uh weed killer uh this afternoon because we're making great time but recognize just how peculiar the statement is jesus confirmed that guiding i being with him in the days when he revealed himself to the jews before the ending of that church age for the jews or their dispensation he manifested by looking through the eye of god now that's that's remarkable we need to catch that he just said jesus confirmed he's confirming something in the days when he revealed himself to the jews so he's someone in his first coming before the ending of that church age for the jews now i know it's terminology and before you start thinking well i need to find the seven church ages book for the jews well it's the old testament yes right it's already written out it's already laid out there but he says it's the internet church it's for the jews he says or their dispensation because in using a different language we have seven church ages but it's just a break up and ordering of the dispensation of the gentile church and so it's the ending of that church age for the jews or their dispensation you're catching the language he's using then in the invasion of the united states he says in the old testament if the lord willing maybe the coming services i'd like to show how that the seven church ages typed out in the old testament we who that's pretty neat how he could type out the old testament the seven church ages in the old testament how that they began just like exactly like in the beginning of the church ages of the gentile church and went right down through a similar dark age and come out into the glorious time of pentecost he said think about these things think about these this order think about all these different things that happen he said i'd like to maybe take some time in the coming services and even though there's no place i can specifically find where he took time to use that nomenclature and those words of first age second age third age fourth age he's certainly using a language that in the ending of the church age for the jews or the ending of the jewish dispensation it's the end of the law it's the end it's the fullness of times as it related to the scriptures of the that the prophets wrote in the old testament you could point out the seven church ages typed out i like that at the beginning just exactly like at the beginning of the church edge of the gentile church went right down through the similar dark age and come out in the glorious time of pentecost at the fallen of the holy spirit in the early church in the jewish dispensation so he's he's saying that you could go into the old testament and see the same pattern to israel that you see in the church same pattern we we have it and and keep this in mind because i'm definitely this is what i'm tracking is the the seven church ages that are given are all prophecy those are forward-looking now in first kings chapter 16 verses 30 to 33 i'm just going to pull this out as an example because brother brandon points to it of how you can begin to identify certain characteristics and abe ahab king ahab brought israel into their dark ages by marrying idolatry by marrying jezebel and marrying this balaamism and babylonianism in with the jewish church and so just exactly what you see happen in the christian church it already happened foreshadowing it in the jewish church and how it they entered their dark age it was the darkest worst time for them it was they're going into the ground as you could say they enter their dark ages under ahab which is the type of the dark ages of the gentile church that dispensation again be thinking revelations chapter one to revelation chapter five you can think about that whole narrative that's in there for us so it says and ahab the son of omri did evil on the side of the lord above all that were before him this is the the depths this is the darkness and it came to pass as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of jeroboam the sons of the but that he took to wife jezebel the daughter of ethbol king of the zidonians and went and served baal and worshiped him and he reared up an altar for bail in the house of bell which he had built in samaria and ahab made a grove and ahab did more to provoke the lord god of israel to anger then to anger than all the kings of israel that were before him this is this is the dark ages for israel this is the depths of of of satan's work against israel this is in their church age or dispensation of the jews he says i'd like to show how the seventh church they just typed out in the old testament i want you to see this as a type so in the sermon why we are why are we not a denomination he says if you'll notice at the beginning when god began to deal with the jews and they went through the golden age and then the darkest age of the jewish dealings god had with the jews was in the ray of ahab and if you'll notice reading those church ages there he gets right back to it again he said now a few things ago he and said he says now right in that dark age and i realized that what he's referring to is he pointing to the revelations chapter two of three or is he pointing back to first kings which one is he pointing to well both because he's saying that the the the israel church had golden age dark ages and the jewish readings he says then reading those church ages there he gets right back to it again so it was in the old testament here it is in the new testament it says 1500 years there or the time of ahab first and the jews the darkest age they had when ahab married jezebel and brought idolatry into israel and made all the people worship after ahab after jezebel's god so he's referring it to as a dark age he's talking about they're even their church ages and and i doubt that anybody here maybe was doing it but man how would brother aaron even make that stretch that ahab represented the dark ages to israel as the dark ages were to the church well it's because brother bram said it and so maybe reserve judgment until you know that i don't have a quote he says right there he makes that direct connection this this is their dark ages so think of the pattern i want you just to recognize the pattern of god remember the whole uh emphasis in the beginning of how i am an open book was to recognize god's pattern of unfolding himself god's way of making himself known so it's not that we have to go back and find a strict church age and go oh well the first king 16 is the dark ages then then this king must have been a type of luther and this king this time period must have been a type of wesley don't try it it's not this strict thing where you try to break it out and come up with seven strict church ages but it's an actual dispensation what i'm wanting to recognize an actual dispensation that has a beginning and it has an end and it's a period of time where god is dealing with israel as if they were his church dealing with israel as his chosen people so my using this language i want to put it this way christ came at the end of their church ages the end of the jewish church ages he comes at the end of their church ages and reveals the mystery of god christ revealed god at the end of their ages when the fullness of time had come when the time was right the time appointed the father he sent forth his son to fulfill everything that was being foreshadowed and portrayed in the old testament but i said god was manifest himself before the ending of the jewish dispensation so here he is it's going to come to close it's going to end so here he is standing there at the close of the jewish church ages it's going to be finished paul's going to say at the fullness of it's come to this point it's going to end it's going to transition we're all going to get out of here he manifest himself before the end of it and would it be wrong to say that old testament became a new book when he came i don't think so now not everybody maybe people stood strong on their traditions and held to their prior theologies and wanted to keep their their their oral traditions they wanted to be i'm a strict constructionist it reads this it has to be this way and and so they just they they cabbage down on certain things but the old testament became a new book because god was manifest himself and brother branham says in sirs we would see jesus he says now in closing i might say this this brother bram i'm saying that don't put words in my mouth brother abraham is saying that we could stand here all night but we'd never get to the end of it because it's just the whole bible just hugged right around there now remember that was the end of the jewish dispensation in the samaritans he's talking about the days of christ the signs of the messiah the things christ was doing he's like oh we could stay here all night why because it's just the whole bible what christ was doing it he says it just hugs around there that was the end of the jewish dispensation and the samaritans and he's speaking of christ and he's referring to christ and his attributes his characteristics his ministry and i'm he says that settled the jewish dispensation that settled the jewish dispensation after they had years of theology and teaching christ settled after years of interpretation years of tradition years of theology years of schooling years of groups i mean think of how many groups they had you had scribes that wrote down you had pharisees that disagreed with the sadducees you had the zealots you had all sorts of denominations through israel's belief system some believed in the resurrection others didn't right a lot of different churches and church splits and and and ways that they viewed things and ways that they believed about the rapture and the resurrection ways that they viewed messiah they had all those messiahs there's a lot of parallels to the church he says they had years of theology and teaching but christ comes and he settles the jewish dispensation the end of all arguments he says now the church is his gentiles now it's coming to their end the fullness of time came for the jews there's going to be a fullness of time for the gentiles and paul says in romans 11 25 for i would not brethren that you should be ignorant of this mystery unless you should be wise in your own conceits that blindness in part is happened to israel until the fullness of the gentiles become in it's not a different concept or idea the fullness of gentiles because there was the fullness of the jewish dispensation paul's writing and it's a language that a jew would understand that we're going to have this time of bondage we have this time of prophets we have these times of kings but one day a messiah is coming he's going to enter in a glorious reign of a kingdom that will know no end and all people will come to his light and peace will reign upon the earth they knew one day come and change everything and so paul when he uses the phrase fullness of the gentiles it's the same fullness of times that the jews believed in but now he's kind of divided it to where we have the fullness of the jewish dispensation oh but now there's another one and it's the fullness of the gentiles to come in it's the filling up of the gentiles it speaks of another time appointed by god just as the old testament spoke of christ's first coming now the new testament is speaking of another manifestation of god another climax another culmination another capstone as christ came and capped and ended the jewish dispensation there's going to be the same thing happen in the ending of the gentile dispensation and then paul saying hey don't be ignorant of this mystery that in part israel was blinded so that god could bring forth a dispensation of his bride to have a bride of his own choosing one of the mysteries of the old testament the mystery of god and so now that speaks the new testament speaking of another manifestation of god look at it through first corinthians chapter 13 verses 9 to 12. first corinthians 13 9-12 for we know in part and we prophesy in part paul is not speaking as a jew under their dispensation he's speaking this at the dawning of this fullness of the the dispensation of the gentiles before we not prophesy in part but when that which is perfect has come is he prophesying is he pointing forward is he saying that some perfect income no he's not saying christ isn't perfect he's not saying the holy ghost isn't perfect he's looking at god's plan and fullness completion aim a purpose but when that which is perfect he's come then that which is in part shall be done away does that mean the parts go away or does it mean the parts are assumed into the hole the part goes away because now it's whole and now it has its purpose it has its aim you just you see something laying out there and you're like what is that well i don't know it's just a part and then you take the part and you put it where it belongs and guess what the parts done away with so beautiful he says when i was a child as fake as the child i understood as a child as a child but when i became a man i put away childish things so what is that maturity growing purpose placing an adoption even for the gentile church and then he says comes back to it again we know in part we prophesy in part now we see through a glass darkly a riddle a mystery a reflection we know what it is but we don't see it quite perfectly it's an enigma it's a puzzle to us but then face to face then it's going to be an open book then it's going to be clear and now but now i and then now i know in part but i know even as also i'm known he's he's he's pointing to another mystery he's pointing to another unfolding he's pointing to the fact that yes there's things we have things we believe things that are very real to us things that we anchor our faith and as being a perfect coming of christ that has ushered us into a new and living way forever consecrating for us a relationship with god that nobody has ever had before but now this new birth has borne inside of us a living hope and a living expectation that our life is not merely to soldier and here for our days and then die and go into a grave and that cycle's not just to repeat itself until mankind completely abolishes himself and then god's gonna raise us all back up again but we're all building to a climactic end when one day even those that sleep are gonna be resurrected and even there will be people who are alive and remain and are changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye he says that's what the new birth brings up inside of you a hope and an expectation just as a circumcision to the jews prophesied i'm part of a people i'm part of a country i'm part of a land that the redeemer is going to come to we too have the same experience actually so i'll say this the new testament must be opened in the same way that this mystery laid hidden and the old testament and christ came as a manifestation of it and declared it at the climax of their church ages then the seals upon this book must be loosed to bring forth full life was god with him yes he said he would be with them was god manifest himself was god speaking yes he did all those things but he had made a promise and when he fulfilled his promise it was the word of life that was manifested something broke something was opened up even there said there's gonna be a fountain opened gonna be living water it's gonna be bread of life it was an open up that which had been damped up that which had been sealed that access they couldn't have that would be the maybe one of the hearts cry of a jew i would just want to see god maybe when they sat around eating dates and uh and and fellowshipping they said oh man i just if i could have one thing i just want to see god and then the subject kind of changes says you never believe who i saw yesterday oh son of joseph out there rant you'll never believe what he had to say and this was what their dream would have been just want to see god and he starts using a language to the his disciples those closest to him when you've seen me now wouldn't that i if and i'm just sharing my heart with you maybe personally i just want to maybe make this like just myself trying to grasp this because i realize in preaching this this isn't just you know um it's the learning vowels there's there's something to this this isn't memorization this is this is just not repeating things that have been preached before this is trying to trying to grasp the greatness of god and what he's done for us and there's there's maybe you've experienced it in this way i just think myself that when somebody sees something maybe you're you're out on a hike and you're you're hiking and you're there at the the steps of her and and you're in this very rigorous hike you've been training for all morning and someone says oh my you see that ram over there like what a ram no it's just right over there it's not on that not only so it's the next one over and i had a friend text me a picture of a ram that he saw it wasn't on this desk but nearby he was on a hard hike and he saw he saw a ram there i mean it's a big horn sheep it looked like it's like what's this thing doing here you pranking me it wasn't april 1st and he said he saw it you know if you were ever in a situation where someone stan says do you see that out there and you go no i don't see it like no it's right there then when you know it's there and you believe them and you don't think they're just playing tricks on you're like wait i want to see it no show me where it's at no is it on this is it by this trees like that and you all said you get very interested like no i i don't i don't see it i understand that and there's situations in our lives where maybe someone tells us no do you see it and all of a sudden we get very concerned and very interested in seeing what they see or seeing what we want to see and and that's what i think it might have done in the heart of philip he says oh just show us the father and he said i am the father philip said from this moment on a purpose in my heart that if i'm gonna see anything i'm gonna see my father revealed in his son if i'm gonna get anything out of my days with him as a master and as a teacher let me see what he said he could show me that if i see him let me see the father listen don't get frustrated if you haven't seen it don't get frustrated if you don't understand it if the word of god tells you he's here to reveal himself and you haven't seen it then just get serious about it and say oh god let me see it if you haven't felt him if he moved if you see signs five signs and what miracles get frustrated don't doubt it just get serious about it and say if you're showing yourself i want to see you maybe let me get critical did you feel the move of god if you didn't feel it we just get critical ah nothing to it a bunch of fanatics well hold on slow down if it's god don't you want to see it amen here he is the book is being made alive and you can tell hey jews the books being made alive all that there would be a seed inside of one to say then i want to see it even if you don't see it i don't see it i don't understand it doesn't make sense to me i've been hearing i've been listening to it i've tried to study it try to figure it out but it keeps saying it over and over again if there's just something inside of you says it's there and you want it then get serious about it to god i want to see it now remember when we we read this i think it was part one souls that are in prison now the end of the church ages revealed the mystery of god that fulfilled the old testament we read at the very start of this service that's the old testament and he says there's a new peace to be fulfilled it's the new testament but it says when the seventh were opened that opened up the entire bible seven says it was sealed with seven mysteries and in these seven seals held the entire mystery of it he says and it was the book of redemption and then he says new testament not the old because there's a redemption to israel that that there's even still uh even in the 70 weeks daniel prophesies there's promises still to israel that's been interrupted that he's going to come back to but he can't do it until what we leave he says it only proclaimed for the new testament the revelation of the mystery of god the seven seals the open of that book held the entire mystery of if i could say this of the new testament now it's also in the old but what was the aim the name of the new testament wasn't to lift up and to promote the old testament it comes in the fulfillment of it it's the amplification of it old testament now is part of the new it took the old to foreshow the do it's the new that comes out of the old just as here christ comes the fulfillment of the old testament out of christ comes the bride now the christ comes the new testament so you can't separate them up and does that well this one belongs on blogs are there they're beautiful together but in the open of the seals what becomes a new book what that relates to us is this new testament book of redemption in the harvest time i'm just reading some quotations here to close brother braham says as noah moses and david reflected the coming of this perfect bridegroom so has luther wesley and pentecost reflected the coming of a perfect bride can be written into planer and if you could have just read that at the beginning we'd all be at chipotle right now noah moses david line them up isaiah jeremiah all of them reflected becoming a perfect bridegroom so has luther wesley and pentecost reflected the coming of a perfect bride in the old testament we read their names but in the new testament we read the symbols the jewish dispensation symbols we could see a golden age in the gospels we can say the institute we can see christ and the precious promises being given in the writings of paul and peter and john we see this new scroll being written new promises being given and then in the last book the book of revelation it tells us what's going to happen church isn't so much of a historical record which the old testament was we're given the prophecies and the symbols of our dispensation of our church ages in revelation and he says then luther wesley pentecost even those church ages reflect the coming of a perfect bride what another golden age another capstone age and it was the stubborn traditions of the jews that kept them from seeing the end of their that it kept him veiled at the end of their ages they were so staunch in the way that it had to be they were so adamant about what it would look like it was their stubborn traditions that they were so tied to and and took so much personal ownership of that and and pride of authoring ideas well we figured it out and it's going to be this way and and you can get you take so much so much ownership that's one of the um one of the dangers and getting very quick to defend certain things is you take ownership of a thought you take ownership of a position and an idea and you make it very very hard for your mind to ever change even in the presence of evidence that says you are wrong and that's exactly what they did they just were no they were so just latched onto it and it was their traditions and their ideas and their concepts that veiled him at the end of the jewish church ages did not has it not happened again amen brother says in looking under jesus that's the very reason that jesus was not understood when he came up to the earth if they would have only looked into the word of god instead of their tradition of that day they would have known he was the son of god glad it's up there so you could see this the bible plainly declared his full coming the bible plainly declared his full coming and he come in the full revelation of the word that's the old testament right the bible plainly declared his full coming and he come in the full revelation of the word so there's a written word that prophesied it now he comes and he plainly declares the spoken word plainly declaring the written word and it's the written word that becomes the living word there's how he's the full manifestation or the full revelation of their scrolls and of their scriptures so the revelation has to come he says and each generation reveals him in the full revelation that's lauded for that time i mean i love this what's that what's the revelation for our time we know that luther sanctification we could think or justification we could think of of wesley in sanctification we could think of other other ages that had some law something measured out to them some disposition he says this generation jesus christ that's revelation of him that's promised in the word must be revealed to this generation if the churches won't receive it somebody will rise up and do it and the churches didn't receive it and somebody has risen up to do it to what receive the full revelation if i could put it this way not just receive the full revelation but reveal it to this generation the churches can't do it but the bride has risen to what revealed jesus christ to this generation because that's what her calling is musicians please come my last statement is this and in this age laodicean the revelation of god will come in its due time it will not falter neither will it be premature think on this and heat it well if we are in the end time today i love it think on this and heat it well because we're in the end time today what does he want us to think about that the revelation of god will come in its due time he did well because it won't fail it won't be premature it may seem like oh where it took forever it took forever he said but it'll be there the revelation of god will come in its due time and then think about christ he come in the full revelation of the word and each generation reveals him in the full revelation that's lauded for this he says this generation must reveal jesus christ and somebody will rise up and do it because the revelation of god will come amen let's stand together
