[0:00] so happy to see everyone out to the
[0:01] house the Lord be together in Fellowship
[0:05] the title that I'd like to give the
[0:07] service tonight is kind of just stepping
[0:09] away just for a second from Kingdom
[0:11] identity maybe we'll pick up on some of
[0:12] those themes on Sunday but this is a
[0:15] carryover of character expression and an
[0:18] even Kingdom identity but tonight it's
[0:20] Kingdom Worthy
[0:21] and my desire in expressing this is that
[0:24] we would be and I want this to be very
[0:26] personal to you as you consider these
[0:29] things and really what's something
[0:31] that's turning over in my heart a lot is
[0:33] a greater consecration that we could
[0:35] have individually in our lives and not
[0:38] for one moment would we want to express
[0:41] things to you so that we could just have
[0:43] some sort of church pretense and that
[0:46] you know let's you know let's check our
[0:48] lives so that we're dressing right
[0:49] because you might be on camera or you
[0:51] know people are going to come to church
[0:52] and if they see how you're living that
[0:54] looks bad on Arizona Believers Church
[0:56] though that's that's not the idea at all
[0:59] whatsoever but the the real uh the real
[1:02] thrust is to have real life and the real
[1:04] living and a lot of things I've been
[1:06] studying to find that brother Branham
[1:07] identifies a little bit of problem a
[1:09] problem with consecration or
[1:10] sanctification and he's kind of makes
[1:13] the statement that's why you don't have
[1:14] Victory and I believe that we're all
[1:16] Desiring to overcome we want to see
[1:17] Victory and maybe many different facets
[1:19] in our lives whether it be Financial
[1:20] whether whether it be having a
[1:22] breakthrough emotionally or just finding
[1:25] some stability within our relationships
[1:27] or maybe it might be something very
[1:29] large in terms of a decision to do
[1:31] something and you're just not being able
[1:32] to break through there's a lot of things
[1:34] that we could take a step back and look
[1:35] at in our lives to find that they're
[1:37] actually becoming barriers to the
[1:39] victory to the Breakthrough to getting
[1:40] to hearing that voice that we want to
[1:42] hear and I'm using this phrase Kingdom
[1:45] worthy because I'm going to be doing a
[1:47] lot of reading from the sermon is your
[1:48] life worthy of the gospel and brother
[1:51] Branham takes his text from Luke chapter
[1:53] 14 verses 15 to 24 is where he's drawing
[1:57] these things from and these excuses that
[1:59] were given and I just hope that there's
[2:01] some punch to it that'll really
[2:02] encourage you but at the same time if it
[2:04] doesn't get you thinking soberly about
[2:06] the word of God in your life then then
[2:09] that's uh then you know there's a
[2:11] greater encouragement and hearing God
[2:13] speak to you where you are in knowing
[2:15] that he's mindful of the things that
[2:16] you're facing and I hope that that takes
[2:18] place as well
[2:19] as I'm wanting to look at the manner of
[2:22] our life and how we're living and how
[2:23] we're kind of looking at character
[2:25] expression is kind of how we live our
[2:27] lives expresses the power of the kingdom
[2:29] and not a manufactured environment where
[2:32] we're able to manifest certain things
[2:34] but just to be able to live a daily life
[2:36] with Christ Out Among the people showing
[2:39] Christ power manifesting
[2:41] um the the Life of Christ to others as
[2:43] we're looking at that thought in second
[2:45] Timothy chapter 3 verse 10
[2:48] Paul says this about himself and it's a
[2:51] quite a remarkable statement and I'm
[2:52] just going to zero in on the manner of
[2:55] life that terminology he uses here but
[2:58] he says Thou Hast known fully known my
[3:00] Doctrine and so we can see this
[3:02] component of the word what he taught
[3:04] that matters what one teaches matters
[3:06] and then he says manner of life then
[3:09] purpose and then he says and so that's
[3:11] kind of what his motive and objective is
[3:13] what he's trying to accomplish and he
[3:15] says faith long-suffering charity
[3:17] patience and these very things that he's
[3:20] expressing there in terms of Faith
[3:21] long-suffering charity and patience he
[3:23] even uses some of these uh very things
[3:26] as the fruit of the spirit in Galatians
[3:28] chapter 5. and he said you've known this
[3:31] you you've seen my long suffering you've
[3:34] seen my faith in my charity you know
[3:35] this and my patience you know what I
[3:37] teach you know the word that I've
[3:39] brought you and he says and my manner of
[3:41] life and that's his conduct and manner
[3:42] of living even the word kind of speaks
[3:44] of a leading and so has something to do
[3:46] with even one's discipline their
[3:48] training they're conducting themselves
[3:50] you know how I live my life and Paul
[3:53] could say this he can say you know me
[3:54] I've lived before you you know what I
[3:56] teach you know my purpose my motive and
[3:58] objective what I'm trying to accomplish
[4:00] you know my faith my long suffering my
[4:02] charity and my patience and so you've
[4:04] seen the fruit of the spirit in my life
[4:05] is what he's expressing
[4:07] and the Bible tells us that these when
[4:09] it comes in Galatians he says there's no
[4:11] law against the fruit of the spirit in
[4:13] other words you cannot preach against
[4:16] the Fruit of the Spirit
[4:17] there's no bar on that there's no law
[4:20] against the fruit of the spirit but
[4:21] brother Bradham does go to Great Lengths
[4:23] uh to get us to understand that the
[4:25] fruit of the spirit or these fruits that
[4:27] we could break them down into can be
[4:30] impersonated and that there can be
[4:32] outward demonstrations of the fruit of
[4:34] the spirit but brother Bradham called
[4:35] the fruit of the spirit he says what is
[4:37] the fruit of the spirit the
[4:38] manifestation of the promised word and
[4:41] so that that kind of takes all these
[4:43] other things that can be a part of it
[4:45] and it zeros it in on what is the real
[4:47] indicator that someone's in the word or
[4:49] in the truth or has the spirit is when
[4:52] their lives line up with the word when
[4:54] the spirit inside of them can say Amen
[4:56] to the word and when they can receive
[4:57] the full word as it's being brought to
[4:59] them and so that's when he comes down
[5:01] and he says unless you accept that word
[5:03] of the hour when it's manifested you're
[5:05] in a predicament no matter how much
[5:07] outward demonstration you have he says
[5:09] how much you speak with tongues how kind
[5:10] and gentle in everything you are if you
[5:12] can't accept the word of God or if you
[5:14] reject any part of the word there you're
[5:16] in a predicament
[5:17] and but he makes this statement about
[5:19] the fruit of the spirit he says the
[5:21] fruit of the spirit proves what you are
[5:24] and I just want to lay these things in
[5:26] very quickly because Paul is saying
[5:27] you've known my Doctrine what I teach
[5:29] you've known my purpose Faith
[5:30] long-suffering charity patience and we
[5:32] could I think we summarize this you've
[5:34] known my conduct my manner of Life How I
[5:36] Live brother bam says the fruit of the
[5:38] spirit proves what you are
[5:41] right and he says not the reaction of
[5:43] the spirit not we know what a difference
[5:45] a reaction and the fruit he says not to
[5:47] speak with tongues not to shout that
[5:49] goes with it too that all goes with it
[5:51] but unless the fruit of the spirit Bears
[5:53] record with God's word
[5:56] and so there's a there's a a spirit
[5:58] inside of you that's bearing record with
[6:00] God's word I just want to lay a few of
[6:01] those things in there at the outset
[6:03] because we have emphasized that quite a
[6:04] bit over the last several Services I
[6:06] think that we have to be in the word it
[6:08] has to be lining up with the word now as
[6:10] he says my life has testified you've
[6:13] known it and he's drawn relation to his
[6:16] testimony
[6:17] brother batam in the sermon is your life
[6:19] worthy of the Gospel
[6:21] he's praying at the very outset before
[6:24] he even I think it's even before he
[6:25] takes his text he says Lord Jesus any
[6:27] man physically or woman or child can
[6:30] move back the pages of this Bible but
[6:32] there's no one that can reveal it but
[6:35] you
[6:36] he says I pray Lord of taking this text
[6:39] as it's placed upon my heart to send out
[6:41] across the Nations for the people that
[6:44] they might know what type of life is
[6:46] required of them to live
[6:48] so when Paul says you've known my manner
[6:50] of life he knew the type of life that
[6:52] was required of him to live so much so
[6:54] when he comes to the end of his ministry
[6:56] and end of his life he says I fought a
[6:58] good fight I finished my course and
[7:00] henceforth because I've done what I
[7:02] ought to do there's a crown of
[7:03] righteousness laid up for me because
[7:05] I've fulfilled my purpose and brother
[7:07] Brandon said I'm going to preach this
[7:09] sermon when he talks about his text he's
[7:10] even talking about his title is your
[7:12] life worthy of the Gospel that they
[7:14] might know what type of life is required
[7:17] he says for so many have many as people
[7:20] for so many has asked me is the
[7:23] Christian Life a life of church service
[7:26] is it helping the poor the needy or is
[7:29] it a constant member is it a loyal
[7:32] loyalty to the church
[7:35] in such questions and I would say that
[7:38] there is so much message theater anymore
[7:41] to where we have distilled down the
[7:44] message to loyal loyalty to church being
[7:47] a constant member or just a life of
[7:50] church service and he's posing the
[7:52] question I believe because he's going to
[7:53] demonstrate that you couldn't just
[7:55] confine it to your duty to your local
[7:57] church though that he would say that is
[8:00] part of it he says in such questions
[8:01] father May the correct answer come
[8:03] tonight through these words as we make
[8:05] an endeavorance to bring them to the
[8:06] people he says in the name of the Jesus
[8:08] Christ we ask it amen this is his
[8:11] introduction to the sermon his opening
[8:13] prayer that they might know what kind of
[8:15] life is required because people are
[8:16] saying what is the Christian Life is it
[8:18] loyalty to church is it that I'm
[8:20] constantly attending services and I'm
[8:22] loyal to the the needs of the church and
[8:24] the things that are happening in the
[8:25] church and he says hopefully tonight
[8:27] we'll have an answer for that
[8:29] and Paul is saying you've known my
[8:30] manner of Life Brethren wants to deal
[8:32] with the type of life that's required in
[8:34] Hebrews chapter 12 verse 28 Paul come
[8:36] into the conclusion of the very book of
[8:38] Hebrews and and this introduction to
[8:40] Mount Zion he says wherefore we receive
[8:42] in a kingdom which cannot be moved let
[8:45] us have Grace
[8:46] whereby we may serve God acceptably
[8:50] we have to have Grace for others if
[8:51] we're going to serve God acceptedly we
[8:53] need to have Grace if we're going to
[8:55] serve God acceptably and to serve God
[8:57] acceptably with reverence and godly fear
[9:00] he says to serve God acceptably it means
[9:03] a manner which is well pleasing
[9:05] and these are these are I know these are
[9:07] obvious themes and maybe we repeat them
[9:09] quite often but I feel that it's uh the
[9:12] purpose of church is to encourage you
[9:13] and equip you and give you the resources
[9:15] to live to live lives close to God and
[9:18] to order your homes and to overcome and
[9:20] we so we'll draw you back to this
[9:22] principle that your the life you live is
[9:24] where it counts and where it matters
[9:26] I would never want our church to become
[9:28] a hobby
[9:30] or a place of recreation we're just kind
[9:32] of steal away for a little bit and we
[9:34] kind of get our let off some steam and
[9:37] and we kind of shut down a little bit
[9:38] that that's just a recreation that's
[9:40] just a hobby it's no different than the
[9:42] sporting arenas they're going out and
[9:43] playing golf that that's not what church
[9:45] is for
[9:46] and so there's uh we want to know how to
[9:49] serve God acceptably with reverence and
[9:51] godly fear that's a matter that is well
[9:53] pleasing he says since we've received a
[9:55] kingdom then let's serve God acceptably
[9:58] let's live the life and the question
[10:01] could be asked what does the Kingdom
[10:02] look like
[10:03] what does it look like in my life if
[10:05] brother bam said here's the Kingdom
[10:06] right here all of it the system and the
[10:07] life if the kingdom is the word of God
[10:09] made spirit and life in my life I would
[10:11] ask myself what does that look like
[10:14] and perhaps challenge myself through
[10:16] some intervals or some reminders
[10:18] throughout the day whenever there's a
[10:19] certain moment say is this what the
[10:20] Kingdom looks like and it might be
[10:22] enough to kind of nudge you along a
[10:24] little bit out of whatever it is you're
[10:25] thinking about or whatever it is you're
[10:26] doing to say this what this moment
[10:28] matters
[10:29] how I'm thinking how I'm acting what I'm
[10:31] doing it matters this has some substance
[10:33] to it
[10:35] in Luke chapter 14 if you could
[10:38] just look back at verse 15.
[10:41] well and as you're looking there
[10:44] are just verse 15 is where all we need
[10:46] to look at it says as Jesus had just
[10:48] given this uh
[10:50] you know just said spoken of the
[10:52] resurrection of the just
[10:54] and this kind of prompted this Jew
[10:56] sitting there one of the scribes or
[10:57] Pharisees or one sitting there at the
[10:59] table and when one of them that sat at
[11:01] me with him heard these things he said
[11:02] unto him blessed is he that shall eat
[11:05] bread and the kingdom of God he was
[11:07] moved and and the things that Jesus was
[11:10] talking about would have kind of
[11:11] oriented them to the idea of the Messiah
[11:14] coming and the kingdom of God being at
[11:17] hand and that when the Messiah is
[11:19] present there's going to be a
[11:20] resurrection of those just Israelites
[11:22] had gone before and they'll be able to
[11:24] live in the time of the restoration of
[11:26] the kingdom and all the Gentiles will
[11:27] come to this Kingdom and he'll be ruling
[11:30] and reigning and so there's a lot of
[11:31] Kingdom principles that would have been
[11:32] in the mind of this Jew and as he thinks
[11:35] about this future moment he's like man
[11:37] blessed is he one day who's going to be
[11:40] able to sit there and eat bread in the
[11:42] presence of the Messiah in the kingdom
[11:44] of God
[11:45] kind of an ironic statement
[11:48] because he was ignorant of the
[11:49] opportunity that set before him
[11:52] the Messiah was presently feasting with
[11:54] him the Messiah was there the kingdom of
[11:57] God was at hand but yet there was just
[11:59] something about the language there's
[12:00] something about his expectations and
[12:01] something about his a lack of Revelation
[12:04] to where he's like oh bless God one day
[12:06] one day we'll sit with the Messiah one
[12:08] day we'll be eating bread in the kingdom
[12:09] of God and Jesus is actually addressing
[12:12] his mindset and he kind of telling kind
[12:14] of exposes himself a little bit
[12:16] and the purpose of The Parables and even
[12:18] this one of the great supper it
[12:20] addressed their misconceptions about the
[12:22] kingdom
[12:23] they had certain ideas of what it was
[12:25] going to look like certain things that
[12:26] were going to be required certain things
[12:28] that were going to be made manifest and
[12:29] like oh when the Messiah comes and this
[12:31] is what he'll look like and this is how
[12:32] live and this is what the meetings are
[12:34] going to be like this is what the throne
[12:35] is going to be like and this is oh bless
[12:37] God man we're that day when we eat bread
[12:40] in the kingdom of God and they had a lot
[12:42] of grand ideas about what that would
[12:44] look like so Jesus uses this Parable to
[12:47] kind of punch back at him a little bit
[12:48] says oh you think you got this figured
[12:50] out huh
[12:52] what they assumed would be glorious and
[12:54] Powerful
[12:55] what he's saying is that they would
[12:57] actually neglect it and they would
[12:58] despise it
[13:00] the very thing that they were invited to
[13:02] Feast upon is they would maybe be told
[13:04] you are feasting on failing body word of
[13:07] the son of man ah you know what we want
[13:08] something else
[13:10] I'd be told that now from then on comes
[13:12] the word and the word only now I think
[13:13] we'll take the Plus
[13:16] hey there's something about the nature
[13:18] of man we're saying I know your mind
[13:19] said I know your attitude I know what
[13:21] you'll do in the end you'll be bidden to
[13:23] the greatest Feast there ever was and it
[13:25] won't look the way you think it should
[13:27] look it won't be as powerful as you
[13:28] think it should be and their idea of
[13:30] glory and power would be so great they
[13:32] look right over the top of it and he was
[13:35] telling them you will actually despise
[13:37] and you do despise the kingdom when it's
[13:39] manifested you won't even want to go and
[13:41] you'll make such lousy excuses
[13:44] has anyone ever had an appointment to
[13:46] rearrange their sock drawer
[13:49] that's the excuse I give when I don't
[13:50] have a good one said sorry I can't be
[13:52] there to help you move I have an
[13:53] appointment to rearrange my sock drawer
[13:54] that day and they said I haven't even
[13:56] told you what day it is you're right I'm
[13:58] going to be out of town that day
[14:01] it's bad excuses is what each one of
[14:03] these give
[14:05] and brother Bam's drawing from these
[14:06] very things where Jesus is exposing
[14:08] their attitude towards the kingdom their
[14:11] understanding of what the kingdom will
[14:12] look like even their service in the
[14:14] kingdom and what they would get out of
[14:15] it and how they would benefit and I'm
[14:17] sorry it gives this bidding and each one
[14:20] says it makes the excuse and goes on
[14:21] brother uses that as his text to preach
[14:24] the sermon is your life worthy of the
[14:26] Gospel
[14:27] and he says this we've got to follow
[14:29] every day every hour of the day every
[14:32] step of the way
[14:34] that's a high standard
[14:36] we've got to be led by the Lord Jesus
[14:38] Christ if we don't we take an
[14:40] organizational life
[14:43] you mean we don't have to have dot org
[14:46] in our URL we can just not follow the
[14:49] word of God and be led by the Lord Jesus
[14:50] Christ and we take an organizational
[14:52] life absolutely
[14:54] I remember years ago when after Al Gore
[14:56] invented the internet and certain
[14:58] charges churches were registering their
[15:00] URLs and I remember that one Church took
[15:03] on the mark of the beast because it was
[15:05] dot org
[15:06] and these are things that were being
[15:07] preached over the pulpit things that
[15:09] were being spread but yet you could take
[15:11] the dot org by just not being led by the
[15:13] Lord Jesus Christ
[15:15] he says the life that doesn't follow
[15:17] Christ daily is not worthy
[15:21] now think about this I think there's
[15:23] sometimes maybe just a little bit of a
[15:25] misunderstanding what brother bam is
[15:26] trying to say because what we think is
[15:28] well I've got to live the life of Christ
[15:31] correctly every day in order to Merit
[15:33] the gospel well you've missed it
[15:36] that's not what he's saying a man that's
[15:38] a Christian on Sunday and goes to church
[15:40] set back there and thinks he owns the
[15:42] church because he does this that or the
[15:44] other and on Monday we'll steal and lie
[15:48] think about it
[15:49] he's talking about character
[15:51] that somebody who can come to church and
[15:53] thinks he owns it
[15:55] maybe we could go back to one who has a
[15:57] life of church services helps the poor
[15:59] and the needyers are constant members
[16:00] loyal has loyal loyalty to the church
[16:02] part of me wants to know brother Branham
[16:04] what was it you were seeing could you
[16:06] just tell me give me some names
[16:08] send me a link to their Facebook page I
[16:10] want to know what it is you're talking
[16:12] about because he's dealing with
[16:13] something clearly but a man who thinks
[16:16] he owns the church because he does this
[16:17] that or the other and on Monday we'll
[16:19] still in lie hey cut the rug and do all
[16:23] you want on Sunday in other words
[16:25] do all you want to the church for the
[16:27] church on uh three times a week whatever
[16:29] it has to do with the church he says but
[16:31] what about your Monday morning
[16:33] how do you line things up how do you
[16:35] treat people what do you talk about what
[16:36] do you lift up he says a man that'll
[16:38] Monday will still in line and then he
[16:40] kind of turns it into the web and he
[16:42] says women that'll go on to the public
[16:43] beaches
[16:44] not there won't be a it won't be a it
[16:46] will be a while before Arizona has
[16:48] beachfront property
[16:49] he says they go out to the public
[16:51] beaches and out upon the streets with
[16:52] immoral clothes on I thought of the
[16:54] first lady wouldn't even put on makeup
[16:56] to go before the Pope he says and come
[16:58] back instead of Waterhead haircut spree
[17:00] for the women in the nation
[17:02] and all these dresses when she becomes a
[17:04] mother every woman in the country wants
[17:05] to wear one of them mother type dresses
[17:07] now that's right it's examples now
[17:11] I was trying to remember who the first
[17:13] lady was
[17:15] I'm glad it's a first lady still
[17:17] but they maybe we're not taking our cues
[17:20] from Dr Biden
[17:22] but there's a whole lot of other
[17:23] influencers and people in power where
[17:25] we're getting our cues from
[17:27] and and I came across a phenomenon I
[17:30] can't remember where I was reading it
[17:31] how now that there's how Christians I
[17:33] mean Christianity is trying to compete
[17:35] in the space with the world where now
[17:37] you have Christian Tick-Tock dance teams
[17:39] and stuff like that nonsense
[17:44] nonsense okay all right I heard a door
[17:47] slam and I started to get nervous
[17:51] I was like maybe I drove past the church
[17:53] today and hit the wrong parking lot
[17:56] now he's talking about where we take our
[17:58] cues from what we emulate what we're
[18:00] feeding on
[18:02] and he says examples and they know that
[18:05] those people would do that they take on
[18:07] a spirit of the world
[18:09] we need to be so mindful of how the
[18:12] spirit of the world can just kind of
[18:13] cling on us
[18:15] and how the spirit of the world can
[18:17] still impact the spirit of a man the
[18:19] spirit of a woman the spirit of our
[18:21] children and even though our soul may be
[18:23] sealed we're still susceptible to
[18:25] diseases because of the Flesh and
[18:28] influences because of our spirit and
[18:30] we've got to know how to keep the spirit
[18:31] clean we got to know how to live down by
[18:33] the life of God that's down in our side
[18:35] of our soul or we could take on the
[18:37] spirit of the world he says and that
[18:39] don't belong in the Church of the Living
[18:40] God
[18:42] he says women ought to look to Jesus
[18:44] Christ
[18:45] there's a place that we can look there's
[18:47] a standard an example that we can
[18:49] identify remember I'm talking about if
[18:51] your life doesn't follow Christ it's not
[18:54] worthy
[18:56] we've looked at these scriptures already
[18:57] this year in this series I even believe
[19:00] in second Peter chapter 3 verse 11 we
[19:02] might have referenced it we've been
[19:04] studying it a lot because our
[19:05] inspiration came from the future home
[19:07] and the the the the Earth itself being
[19:09] renovated
[19:10] and the fire that burns up the earth and
[19:12] the pattern that brother man shows for
[19:13] the Earth to the individual
[19:15] and Peter's referring to those of the
[19:17] sin then that all these things shall be
[19:19] dissolved
[19:21] what manner of persons ye ought to be
[19:24] ought ye to be in all holy conversation
[19:27] and godliness
[19:29] in in light of the things that are to be
[19:31] in light of what God is going to do and
[19:33] even the things that are going to be
[19:35] renovated and changed and I think it
[19:37] just it hits me even more when brother
[19:38] bam says that what God does to the Earth
[19:41] he's done to the individual those of us
[19:43] who've had the baptism of fire for God
[19:45] to renovate our souls and set us on fire
[19:48] by the new birth deep down in our soul
[19:49] what man and persons are you to be
[19:53] that there has been uh unbelief
[19:55] dissolved down in our soul what manner
[19:57] of persons ought we to be in all manner
[20:00] of Life conduct and behavior that's what
[20:02] he means by holy conversation
[20:04] and godliness that's Holiness that's
[20:06] devotion
[20:08] this is
[20:10] showing us that it's a life that's got
[20:12] to be lived I hope this challenges all
[20:14] of us tonight
[20:16] and the question is is your life worthy
[20:19] of the Gospel
[20:21] and we could read that and say well
[20:24] do I have I lived my life correctly
[20:27] enough in order to receive it
[20:30] and that misses it
[20:32] um am I have I merited it am I worthy to
[20:36] receive it what's the beautiful part of
[20:37] the Gospel as it comes to those who
[20:40] can't earn it comes to those who can't
[20:42] Merit it the gospel is for those who the
[20:45] only thing they have is the favor of God
[20:47] upon them in the election of God upon
[20:49] them and it was in our helpless State
[20:51] and needing Mercy that God sends us the
[20:53] gospel and so when brother Bob says is
[20:55] your life worthy of the Gospel
[20:58] the sense that it's meant is
[21:01] I'm taking this from the dictionary that
[21:03] brother banham used the most often and
[21:05] even borrowing it from the the
[21:07] definition that you would have found in
[21:09] the dictionary at the time is your life
[21:11] good enough to have been written said
[21:14] done or created
[21:16] when something is worthy of something in
[21:18] this sense
[21:19] is it good enough to have been written
[21:22] said done or created
[21:24] is it worthy of their authorship is it
[21:26] worthy of of their name or their title
[21:29] did they produce this work and did they
[21:32] accomplish this is we just read this
[21:34] book is this worthy of Shakespeare we
[21:36] just read this we just saw this painting
[21:38] is it worthy of a van Gogh and he's
[21:40] saying good enough to have been written
[21:42] said done or created by the gospel
[21:46] is your life worthy of the Gospel is it
[21:50] to cause us to ask ourselves have I
[21:51] earned his favor have I earned his
[21:53] presence have I earned disgrace have I
[21:55] earned the gifts have I earned a
[21:57] manifestation but rather is the life
[21:59] that I'm living are the things written
[22:01] the things said the things done the
[22:03] things created are have they been done
[22:06] by the gospel
[22:08] [Music]
[22:09] do they testify of the Gospel
[22:13] Hallelujah
[22:17] now I'd like to take a very lengthy
[22:20] reading
[22:21] and begin
[22:22] with paragraph 128
[22:25] to paragraph 153 of the sermon is your
[22:28] life worthy of the Gospel
[22:30] I don't normally maybe just read this
[22:32] much as far as an excerpt from one
[22:35] sermon
[22:36] uh for no not that I have some sort of
[22:39] uh quote meter that sounds whenever I
[22:43] copy paste and I get kicked out because
[22:44] I have too many lines
[22:46] but but rather
[22:50] just just there's times where you can
[22:52] get the point across
[22:53] and hit it with just a portion of what
[22:55] brother I'm saying and I always
[22:56] encourage you all to go back and look at
[22:58] these things yourselves but I think this
[22:59] just tells so much in this In this
[23:01] passage that is super practical
[23:04] and it speaks to the things where the
[23:06] gospel if he's asking is your life
[23:09] worthy of the Gospel does your life
[23:11] speak
[23:12] does your life create
[23:14] does it do
[23:16] is what you do in your life good enough
[23:21] has it is it to have been done by the
[23:25] gospel
[23:27] how well does it your life speak and
[23:29] testify of the Gospel
[23:31] and he says here in paragraph 128 I
[23:34] believe it is is your life worthy of the
[23:36] Gospel a Christian is not a tool
[23:38] or some kind of mechanical wrench to a
[23:40] great big religious regime
[23:42] now if you'll if you could kind of pick
[23:44] the theme that brother banham is dealing
[23:46] with is it a Christian Life Of Life of
[23:49] church service
[23:50] is it a constant member is it a loyal
[23:52] loyalty to the church
[23:54] he's tearing apart a particular paradigm
[23:57] the church-centric attitude sometimes we
[24:00] adopt in order to have a fig Leaf
[24:01] religion to placate ourselves into
[24:03] everything's good everything's cool
[24:06] and sometimes we find that comfort in
[24:07] numbers right well because I'm not the
[24:09] only one that shows up on Wednesday
[24:10] night or I go to a church that's large
[24:12] and we kind of play kid ourselves asleep
[24:14] they all believe the message we're all
[24:15] doing this together and this is a pretty
[24:16] big thing I must be right but listen
[24:19] McDonald's has proven that billions can
[24:21] be wrong
[24:25] so he says a Christian is not a tool or
[24:28] some kind of mechanical wrench to a
[24:30] great big religious regime that's right
[24:31] a Christian is not some kind of tool
[24:34] that keeps a religious organizational
[24:36] organization moving
[24:39] it's not being a cog in a movement it's
[24:41] not getting caught up in a movement
[24:42] that's not what makes a Christian not
[24:44] some kind of tool that keeps a movement
[24:45] going
[24:47] a Christian that is not a Christian a
[24:49] Christian is to be christ-like
[24:51] and a Christian cannot be a Christian I
[24:53] think this is just so beautiful I love
[24:55] that we just lately it seems to be a
[24:57] real emphasis on this and a Christian
[24:59] cannot be a Christian until Christ comes
[25:02] into the man
[25:03] The Life of Christ is in them
[25:06] if you're having difficult to chew in
[25:08] this just check the date it looks post
[25:10] seals when I look at it
[25:12] and he is saying that Christ coming into
[25:16] the man is what makes him a Christian
[25:18] that should be our the primary
[25:21] definition we think of when we think of
[25:22] a real Christian
[25:24] now if you have the Life of Christ
[25:26] inside of you you'll show respect
[25:28] to any person
[25:30] he's talking with my brother on Monday
[25:32] and he was talking about something and
[25:34] he was expressing you know a feeling
[25:36] about something
[25:38] and how that maybe as a Christian you
[25:41] know we should treat somebody
[25:42] differently as a Christian and really
[25:43] what we arrived at is as Christians you
[25:45] treat humans would you treat them
[25:47] respectfully
[25:48] treat everyone with some sort of decorum
[25:50] indecency there's just a way that you
[25:52] treat people and that's the nastiness
[25:55] that's crept into into Christianity and
[25:57] maybe into our message attitudes is we
[26:00] kind of want to have some sort of idea
[26:01] that we see the we see the right kind of
[26:03] markings we see these secret handshake
[26:05] it's like oh I can be nice to you
[26:09] and then we can be mean and lie and
[26:11] cheat and steal with everybody else no
[26:13] God forbid
[26:16] and and he said that with Christianity
[26:18] is a life that's lived and Christianity
[26:20] Christ comes into a man who lives in him
[26:22] so I'll just to close that Loop if
[26:25] someone professes to be a Christian
[26:26] treat them as one
[26:28] fellowship with them as if they are one
[26:31] let them let them get thirsty for that
[26:33] Christ that they claim to know
[26:36] and a Christian cannot be a Christian
[26:37] until Christ comes into the man the Life
[26:39] of Christ in him then it produces the
[26:42] life that Christ lived and you do the
[26:45] things that Christ did
[26:47] what are those things are these things
[26:50] or is it just cursing fig trees and we
[26:52] ask ourselves what what does it mean
[26:55] something to find out he goes what am I
[26:57] talking about personal relationship to
[27:00] Christ
[27:01] what is it is your life worthy of the
[27:05] Gospel
[27:08] scripture brother Brandon refers to in
[27:10] just another
[27:11] scripture to add to this
[27:13] in Matthew chapter 7 verses 21 to 23
[27:18] Jesus says wherefore by their fruits you
[27:20] shall know them
[27:22] it's quite a statement
[27:24] not everyone saith unto me now if we
[27:27] could just exercise
[27:30] some spiritual thinking
[27:33] he says you'll know them by their fruits
[27:37] and then he says something about fruits
[27:41] not everyone that saith unto me Lord
[27:43] Lord shall enter the kingdom of heaven
[27:44] so it's not just the fruit of one's lips
[27:46] where they're just saying Lord Lord but
[27:48] he that doeth the will of My Father
[27:50] which is in heaven I know that sometimes
[27:52] that makes it a little bit more
[27:53] difficult because it might seem to be
[27:55] just a little bit elusive what does the
[27:57] will of God mean for you and for me what
[27:58] does the will of God stand for but yet
[28:01] we know that God's will is his word that
[28:04] one cannot act contrary to the word of
[28:06] God and be in the will of God though you
[28:08] may be trying to do him a service
[28:11] then he says many will come to me in
[28:13] that day and say Lord Lord and now he's
[28:15] dealing even with more demonstrative
[28:17] works and our demonstrations and fruits
[28:19] he says have we not prophesied in thy
[28:21] name and you know they had but yet it's
[28:23] not by that fruit you'll know him and in
[28:26] thy name cast out devils and you know
[28:27] what they had but it wasn't by that
[28:29] fruit that you'll know them and I name
[28:31] done many wonderful Works maybe he just
[28:33] didn't want to keep going on and on so
[28:34] he just summarizes it all and he's not
[28:36] saying he didn't but he said that's not
[28:37] by the fruit which you'll know him he
[28:39] says and then I will profess him I never
[28:41] knew you'd depart from me ye that work
[28:44] iniquity
[28:47] so there are fruits that he's saying
[28:49] that by them will know
[28:52] I again I'm not being precise I'm going
[28:54] to be very specific I'd be remiss to try
[28:56] to distill it down and just put a period
[28:59] on it
[29:00] but it is something to ponder
[29:02] and brother Branham refers to this
[29:04] scripture he does it more than once
[29:06] where he's looking at
[29:07] the fruit of one's life is it worthy of
[29:11] the Gospel
[29:13] now continuing on
[29:16] in this his very next paragraph after he
[29:18] says is your life worth of the Gospel
[29:20] well now I'm just going to cut some out
[29:22] here I should have made myself a note
[29:24] then he began he talks about Israel
[29:26] wanting a king
[29:28] how that they had rejected
[29:31] uh they'd rejected God it rejected God's
[29:34] order God's program and Israel wanted uh
[29:37] to be like the rest of the Nations and
[29:39] they wanted to have a king because they
[29:41] had their idea of what a kingdom should
[29:42] look like
[29:43] and we we see in Israel rejecting the
[29:46] prophet they rejected God and that even
[29:49] as we read on Sunday that when he talks
[29:51] about restoring system restore your
[29:53] judges and your counselors
[29:54] and and it wasn't about resurrecting uh
[29:57] some prior king or family and bringing
[29:59] them up to the throne but God's order
[30:01] that he had in the beginning he was to
[30:03] be the king
[30:05] so he's not wanting to look to the flesh
[30:06] he says Pentecost wanted an organization
[30:08] anyhow it got it and that's the parallel
[30:10] to Israel wanting a king that's right
[30:12] wanted to be like the rest of the
[30:13] churches you are
[30:16] go ahead that's just what it takes
[30:19] but God is our King God is our King
[30:24] this is right how we ought to look at
[30:27] this yes sir what is it
[30:29] it's because that the people like they
[30:31] did in the days of Christ like they have
[30:34] in every age they find an excuse
[30:37] this is what we see in Luke chapter 14
[30:40] and this is what he's hearkening back to
[30:42] what's the reason why people organize
[30:44] what's the reason why people find
[30:46] themselves believing that the Christian
[30:47] Life is a life of service to the church
[30:49] and and and and just because I do this
[30:51] that and the other that I own the church
[30:53] and there's all these things he's kind
[30:55] of punching at when he talks about being
[30:57] a Christian in some sort of great big
[30:58] religious movement and all these things
[31:00] he's identifying some sort of Base
[31:02] Instinct in the human mind that takes
[31:04] comfort in human things and he's saying
[31:06] the reason why this happens is they
[31:08] always find an excuse if I can put this
[31:10] way a justification for what they're
[31:12] doing
[31:14] and he says they have their own Creed
[31:16] they want to eat their own food and they
[31:18] want to wear their own clothes you might
[31:20] not want to say it I bought a cow and I
[31:22] go see whether she'll work or not or
[31:23] give milk or what stock it she is you
[31:25] might not have the that excuse but
[31:28] here's the kind of excuse that they may
[31:29] say I'm a presbyterian we don't believe
[31:32] in that I'm Baptist we don't believe in
[31:34] those stuff such as that well I'm a
[31:36] Lutheran well that don't have anything
[31:37] to do with it that don't mean you're a
[31:40] Christian that means you belong to a
[31:42] bunch of people that's organized and you
[31:44] belong to the Lutheran Lodge the Baptist
[31:46] laws the Pentecostal Lodge there's no
[31:49] such thing as a Pentecostal Church
[31:50] there's no such thing as a Baptist
[31:53] Church it's Baptist Lodge Pentecostal
[31:55] Lodge Presbyterian Lodge
[31:59] any anybody want to say it
[32:03] but there's only one Church
[32:05] and there's only one way you can get
[32:07] into it and that's by birth
[32:09] I love just how clear he is on the what
[32:11] the new birth is it's by birth you're
[32:13] born into the Church of Jesus Christ and
[32:15] a member of his body of the spiritual
[32:18] delegation of Heaven
[32:20] then the signs that Christ is with you
[32:23] lives through you
[32:26] yeah I know it may seem Elementary but
[32:28] brother Brown's hitting at something
[32:30] this is his point of emphasis how things
[32:32] could begin to turn to where maybe he's
[32:35] seeing something after the open of the
[32:37] seals and people expecting some great
[32:38] big something to happen he finds he's
[32:40] got to reoriented them to the the
[32:42] foundation of it all that it's about
[32:44] Christ
[32:45] and this is what has been opened up to
[32:47] us and this is what we're feeding on and
[32:48] this is the one that's making himself
[32:49] known and it's got to be him in you that
[32:51] lives through you and don't get
[32:53] sidetracked by all the accoutrements of
[32:56] church and find that if he's inside of
[32:58] you church will find its place he's
[33:00] inside of you I believe you'll serve the
[33:02] church if he's inside of you you'll give
[33:03] to the church if he's inside of you
[33:04] you'll find the church is for you and it
[33:07] serves a purpose but you can't try to do
[33:09] it the other way around and think that
[33:10] because you're loyal to church that's
[33:12] made your life worthy of the Gospel
[33:16] then the signs that Christ is with you
[33:18] lives through you Christians oh you must
[33:21] have a personal relationship to God
[33:25] in order to be a Son of God you must
[33:27] become relation to God
[33:29] he must be your father
[33:31] in order for you to be a son
[33:34] that fellowship with some pastors lately
[33:38] and uh there's just there's some
[33:40] fellowship we have and some meetings
[33:42] that we have and the question was kind
[33:43] of surfacing
[33:45] on
[33:46] Christians and who saved and who's not
[33:49] saved
[33:50] and and I think this would have to be
[33:52] the end of the discussion only his sons
[33:54] and daughters are saved not the members
[33:57] of a church but sons and daughters
[33:59] and there's only one thing that'll
[34:01] produce that that's the new birth
[34:03] think of that the only ones that are
[34:05] saved are Sons and Daughters the only
[34:07] one that'll produce it that's the newest
[34:08] New Birth the new birth is the only
[34:10] thing that will reproduce relationship
[34:12] to God
[34:15] now if you were born again by the
[34:17] baptism of the Holy Ghost that sets you
[34:19] in a knowledge of relationship to Christ
[34:23] puts the Life of Christ on the inside of
[34:26] you by one Spirit we're baptized into
[34:27] one body that's what he's pointing out
[34:29] here we're not members of a church but
[34:30] we come members of his body as Sons and
[34:32] Daughters of God and now if we have that
[34:35] profession or that experience he says
[34:37] then Christ lives through you
[34:39] if we have that experience brother Brown
[34:41] said I'm wanting you just know what type
[34:42] of life is required
[34:44] and he doesn't want to just kind of give
[34:46] the details of the lives that required
[34:48] without identifying the life that it
[34:51] takes on the inside to produce the life
[34:53] that's required otherwise what he could
[34:55] do is just kind of create a checklist or
[34:56] a bucket list that we all kind of go out
[34:58] there and we try to hit the mark a
[35:00] little bit
[35:01] that's why in the whole uh the the
[35:03] fallacy of the evidence of the Holy
[35:05] Ghost speaking and speaking in tongues
[35:07] it becomes some demonstrative thing that
[35:10] one could do and that just get to
[35:12] whether they after they do it
[35:14] right and once they've done it they're
[35:15] like I got it and everybody's like I
[35:17] think you do
[35:18] I had no idea what you're saying I think
[35:20] that's it
[35:21] all right and that's kind of what he he
[35:23] avoids by wanting you to know by faith
[35:26] that you've met the mark
[35:29] continuing
[35:33] he said here's the question I want to
[35:34] get to you
[35:36] and he talks a little bit
[35:39] uh if you could just go and maybe listen
[35:42] to this sermon I think it'll be a
[35:43] benefit to you he says here's the
[35:44] question I want to get to you
[35:46] the man says what do I do then after
[35:48] we've been born again
[35:50] so many asked that question
[35:53] what should I do then brother Branham
[35:56] if you're born again
[35:58] now notice if you if you could just
[36:01] really pay attention he says what do I
[36:03] do after I'm born again and notice what
[36:06] he doesn't tell you you need
[36:08] he says if you're born again your entire
[36:10] Nature's changed you are dead to the
[36:12] things you once thought
[36:14] well you say brother Brandon when I
[36:15] joined the church I got that well then
[36:17] when God said Jesus Christ is the same
[36:19] yesterday today and forever he still
[36:21] heals the sick he still shows Visions
[36:22] but brother Brandon my church now you're
[36:25] not born again you can't be now what is
[36:27] he bringing it back to the word test
[36:30] how the fruit of the spirit is the
[36:31] manifestation of the promised word and
[36:34] that if you can't
[36:35] if your spirit can't say Amen to the
[36:37] word that's not the new birth
[36:40] if you're denying the word of God he
[36:42] says you're in a predicament
[36:45] he said that's the one evidence is when
[36:47] you can receive the word not some system
[36:48] but have a clear understanding he says
[36:50] it can be for if the very God if his
[36:52] life is in you when you're born again
[36:54] it's in you like you're in the life of
[36:56] your father
[36:57] and at the very life of God is in you
[37:01] the very spirit that was in Christ
[37:04] in you
[37:06] how can the spirit live in Jesus Christ
[37:08] and write this and then come back down
[37:11] in you and deny that
[37:14] how could the god I when I was uh listen
[37:18] to brother Branham and he kind of
[37:19] corrected himself right and he says that
[37:22] um about the author of the scripture and
[37:24] he says he says Paul wrote it God was
[37:27] the author if I remember I just listened
[37:29] to something where he refers to that and
[37:31] he said it's Paul that wrote it it might
[37:34] have been Paul the instrument of his
[37:35] hand or whatever that wrote it but we
[37:37] know it's God he's the author
[37:40] and he wrote this word and how can the
[37:42] very life of the word the very Breath of
[37:44] God who wrote the word how could he
[37:46] write that word and then be living in
[37:48] you and be like no don't don't believe
[37:50] it
[37:51] it's kind of it's kind of what takes
[37:53] place on the witness stand when someone
[37:54] says do you recognize that handwriting
[37:56] uh yeah I do whose handwriting is that
[37:58] uh it's mine
[38:00] did you write that yeah I did and it
[38:02] says this I killed him it says well did
[38:04] you kill him like no I didn't no no not
[38:07] me
[38:11] he says it'll punctuate every word to be
[38:13] sown
[38:14] did he say well I'm a good church member
[38:16] that don't have one thing to do with it
[38:18] why is he punching at people who go to
[38:19] church
[38:20] and why would I choose a Wednesday night
[38:22] to do that
[38:26] you're welcome
[38:28] that don't have one thing to do with it
[38:31] there's a
[38:32] he's challenging us
[38:35] it terms of does is the life that we're
[38:37] living
[38:38] there's a lot of things that human
[38:40] nature can produce
[38:42] people have very hard disciplines to
[38:45] things and belief systems and structures
[38:47] and personal discipline to ideologies
[38:49] that cause them to give their lives and
[38:51] to commit Jihad and to abuse themselves
[38:54] there's a lot that mankind will do when
[38:56] he's deluded and when he's convinced of
[38:57] something and brother I'm going to say I
[38:59] got to get past this level of human
[39:01] intensity I got to get past on this
[39:04] outward demonstration and I need you to
[39:06] come to a place of peace to know that
[39:08] Christ is down on the inside of you and
[39:10] then if you've got that down on the
[39:11] inside of you says I want you to know
[39:13] the kind of life that that produces and
[39:15] if I could keep bringing that up before
[39:16] you with the right kind of emphasis and
[39:18] Rhythm then I know you're going to make
[39:20] progress down the in this road of
[39:22] Christian Living
[39:24] the very life of God inside of you
[39:27] and he says when this takes place
[39:31] this new birth
[39:35] the thing you'll do then
[39:37] you'll find out that the spirit that
[39:39] comes in you from the new birth
[39:40] you will believe and do everything that
[39:43] God says his word is for you to do
[39:47] you will believe and do you will
[39:49] acknowledge and follow
[39:52] your knowledge of and adherence to the
[39:54] pure word of God
[39:56] it says and everything that the Bible
[39:58] quotes for you to do you'll punctuate it
[40:01] with an amen
[40:02] and you'll not stop day and night until
[40:04] you receive it that's right that's right
[40:07] and all this time you'll certainly above
[40:09] everything bear the Fruit of the Spirit
[40:13] this is this is good
[40:15] it's good to know if anyone has been
[40:18] frustrated with maybe a lack of uh the
[40:20] fruit of the spirit in your life it may
[40:22] be frustrations well enough and doubt is
[40:24] well enough you know just stick with the
[40:25] word of God
[40:26] just stick with the word it's right say
[40:28] an amen do it not stop day and night and
[40:31] believing in the word of God and
[40:32] believing in the word of God I know
[40:34] oftentimes a lot have said is about
[40:36] Warfare and fighting the devil and going
[40:38] toe-to-toe with the devil drawing your
[40:40] sword against the devil and you gotta
[40:41] fight the devil
[40:43] punch them till your arms fall off kick
[40:45] them till your legs fall off and then
[40:47] bite them till your teeth fall out and
[40:48] then gum them to death
[40:50] right and you're like yeah
[40:53] and you just want to find the devil and
[40:55] bite on him first
[40:57] you're like well if I could find him I'd
[40:59] do it but you know the greatest weapon
[41:01] you have against the devil the greatest
[41:02] thing you can do to fight them the
[41:04] greatest way you can declare war on the
[41:06] devil is to believe God's word
[41:08] that's Warfare
[41:09] believe in God's word that's Warfare not
[41:11] how loud you can shout how much all you
[41:13] can pour on yourself not how much you
[41:15] can dance how much you can run not even
[41:17] how much you can testify but to believe
[41:19] down in your heart that God's word is
[41:22] right that's the greatest weapon that's
[41:25] the greatest power that a Believer has
[41:27] it's faith in God's word
[41:30] that's how you fight
[41:33] you just punctuated with an amen
[41:36] you say will I speak with tongues you
[41:39] might do that
[41:40] and you might not
[41:42] will I shout
[41:44] you might do that you might not
[41:47] but there's one sure thing you will do
[41:51] you'll bear the Fruit of the Spirit
[41:53] one sure thing you will do if the
[41:56] spirit's on the inside of you if you
[41:57] stick with it there's one thing you will
[41:59] do you may shout you may speak with
[42:01] tongues but there's one sure thing that
[42:03] you will do bear the Fruit of the Spirit
[42:04] and the fruit of the spirit is love joy
[42:06] peace Faith long-suffering meekness
[42:07] gentleness patient
[42:10] brother Branham says that unless there's
[42:12] fruit I'm just drawn from another place
[42:14] he says and the fruit of the spirit is
[42:15] not outward demonstrations it's an
[42:18] inward work of Grace
[42:19] love joy peace long-suffering goodness
[42:22] Faith meekness genderless patience there
[42:24] you are those are all things that become
[42:26] an abiding condition of the spirit not
[42:29] things that we try to earmark in the
[42:31] flesh but something you know you've got
[42:33] in your spirit and whether somebody
[42:35] recognizes it or not you know you've got
[42:37] love you know you've got joy you know
[42:39] you've got peace you know you've got
[42:41] faith you know you're long suffering you
[42:43] know you have meekness and gentleness
[42:44] and patience that's where it really
[42:46] counts is to know you've got access to
[42:48] it
[42:48] [Music]
[42:51] he said there's just so much reliant on
[42:53] outward emotions and demonstrations
[42:56] because when it takes a genuine pure
[42:57] born-again holy ghost-led life to prove
[42:59] what you are
[43:01] he says you'll bear the Fruit of the
[43:02] Spirit
[43:04] and now here comes the test right
[43:07] your temper will not be ooh and I should
[43:10] have gone and listen to it again just to
[43:11] kind of hear how he says it
[43:13] right
[43:15] what did it look like when your parents
[43:17] got mad with you huh
[43:20] knucklehead right
[43:22] ooh just remember
[43:25] when you got that that poisons the holy
[43:27] spirit away from you
[43:30] when you get to that place you want to
[43:32] fuss with everybody you come along to
[43:35] there's something wrong
[43:37] and we get to a place where a minister
[43:38] will read from the Bible that it's wrong
[43:40] to do a certain thing and you'll just
[43:42] remember
[43:43] here he says you kind of cuts I says
[43:45] just remember there's no Christianity
[43:47] there at all
[43:48] right that's now that by their fruits
[43:50] you shall know them that's what Jesus
[43:53] said
[43:55] now he's talking about temper a lot of
[43:57] things I've been reading lately and
[43:58] where brother branham's talking about
[44:00] where the church had failed and people
[44:02] who
[44:03] sometimes can be the most churchier you
[44:06] know the most religious he says you know
[44:08] watch their tongue
[44:10] tip it like a buzzsaw right gossiping
[44:12] and their personal relationships and
[44:14] can't get along with anybody and a lot
[44:15] of those different things and you
[44:16] realize man there's a lot of religion
[44:19] and pretense that can be out front and
[44:21] that's what the person starts to judge
[44:23] themselves by
[44:24] well how could I be wrong this this and
[44:27] there's a whole lot out front and
[44:28] they're not examining themselves by the
[44:30] word of God he said hey if your temper
[44:31] gets to you you're poisoned the holy
[44:34] spirit away from you fussing with
[44:36] everybody
[44:37] he says always picking fusses or you're
[44:39] always griping about something there's
[44:41] something wrong with you
[44:43] he's talking about don't Lord don't
[44:45] Crown my life at that crabby complaining
[44:48] critical spirit
[44:52] when the word is preached up no you dig
[44:54] in your heels lock up and say no I don't
[44:56] believe that brother bound even talks
[44:58] about it says well you you say this and
[45:01] the Bible says something no I'm a
[45:02] Lutheran I don't believe that the Bible
[45:03] says this no I don't believe that the
[45:05] Bible says that you shall lay hands on
[45:06] the sick and you can and try to find
[45:09] that place where he actually says what
[45:10] he's referring to there I talk about
[45:12] it's he envisions and and these things
[45:14] up no we don't believe in that really
[45:18] he's saying that you got to be careful
[45:20] he said if it's the word
[45:23] and God said so
[45:25] that spirit in you will cope with that
[45:28] word
[45:29] every time
[45:34] because genuine Holy Spirit Will cope
[45:36] with the word
[45:37] because the word is life and spirit
[45:39] there's the kingdom
[45:43] all right let's
[45:45] that's
[45:46] I think that's heavy
[45:49] Jesus said my words are life and if
[45:51] you've got eternal life and he is the
[45:53] word how can the word deny the word
[45:56] what kind of person would you make God
[45:58] that's one thing to know that you're a
[46:00] Christian is when you can fully agree
[46:01] upon every word of God
[46:05] so glad that we have Grace
[46:08] that's one way you know where your
[46:10] Christmas you can fully agree upon every
[46:12] word of God this is a master class the
[46:15] brother bam is teaching us and you find
[46:17] yourself in love with your enemy and it
[46:19] gets real practical as we read through
[46:20] this
[46:21] you find yourself in love with your
[46:23] enemy
[46:24] somebody said well he's nothing but a
[46:25] Holy Roller
[46:27] and you start to get
[46:28] be careful
[46:30] now be honest
[46:33] true story has anyone here ever in your
[46:37] life called somebody a Holy Roller
[46:41] all right so you better think of
[46:43] something else
[46:44] that you've called somebody
[46:47] think of something else you've called
[46:48] somebody and how easy it is to run
[46:51] somebody down about this and run
[46:52] somebody down about that he says oh
[46:54] they're nothing but a holy roll and you
[46:55] start to get be careful be careful
[46:58] but when you really find yourself that
[47:00] you love him regardless of what they do
[47:03] you still love them then you beginning
[47:05] to find and your patience gets from
[47:07] about that long
[47:09] till it just don't have no end I don't
[47:11] know where he was in the measuring of
[47:13] this
[47:14] anybody just keep saying things about
[47:16] you well I don't care what you say
[47:20] get stirred up
[47:23] if you get stirred up
[47:26] you better go pray first before you talk
[47:29] to them again
[47:30] there's some Grace
[47:32] he says don't get stirred up you said
[47:34] too late right you're sorry well then
[47:36] just pray first
[47:37] pray soften your spirit with prayer
[47:39] bring them before the Lord pour out your
[47:41] heart before them you know how it works
[47:43] as soon as you start to do something
[47:45] like that well so and so did this to me
[47:47] and so-and-so did that and they said
[47:49] this about me and Lord could you just
[47:50] Heap coals of fire upon Him may you just
[47:52] cause it to hell just right on their
[47:54] house can a monsoon just come and dump
[47:56] it all right on the walls right behind
[47:57] their house just sweep it all away
[47:59] because he did this and he did that and
[48:01] you know what if that happened it would
[48:03] be really sad and you your spirit starts
[48:05] changing you start realizing well maybe
[48:07] he said that because I said that about
[48:09] him and maybe somebody told me that I
[48:11] said all those things about him
[48:14] he says pray about it first before you
[48:16] talk to him
[48:18] he says don't get in fusses
[48:20] don't like to get in fuss
[48:24] can somebody just make that like a
[48:26] sticker don't like to get in fuss
[48:29] start telling our kids that hey don't
[48:31] like to get in fuss
[48:33] because it happens
[48:34] maybe for some of us maybe if whether we
[48:36] went to law school or we're just natured
[48:38] that way or it's in our DNA you kind of
[48:39] like to our want to build cases and say
[48:41] things
[48:42] I says no don't don't like to fuss get
[48:44] in fuss
[48:46] if you like to see somebody raise up in
[48:48] church and say you know what I'll tell
[48:50] you so and so did so and so
[48:52] it means you like to hear
[48:54] you want the tea right
[48:57] let me know what's up I want to hear it
[48:59] tell me what's going on
[49:01] what what's so and so doing
[49:03] and you'd like to hear it you say now
[49:06] brother shame on you
[49:08] if you say oh is that so listen to that
[49:11] Scandal watch out
[49:15] how many of us should be willing to say
[49:17] I don't want to hear it
[49:19] you did you I don't want to hear it
[49:22] if we were
[49:23] if we were more capable of doing that
[49:27] you'd be in a better position when a
[49:28] brother comes to you in the right Spirit
[49:30] he says I've got a situation I want to
[49:32] talk to you about and they need to say
[49:34] something that's been done they need to
[49:35] express something about the leadership
[49:37] they need to say something about things
[49:39] going on but you're if you're always
[49:40] complaining you're always negative
[49:42] you're always griping about something
[49:43] and then you come along and say
[49:46] did you see who parked there right it's
[49:49] like what does that even matter just
[49:51] trying to stir things up trying to
[49:53] agitate things he says watch out he says
[49:55] the holy spirit is not a cesspool
[49:58] and when he says this this gives me some
[50:00] ownership over my spirit to know that
[50:03] the spirit fell on the inside of my soul
[50:05] that wants to have preeminence in my
[50:07] spirit doesn't need to be dancing around
[50:09] all the rumor mongering all the tea all
[50:12] the gossip and all the 4-1-1 that people
[50:14] want to pour into us
[50:16] I remember one time a sister called my
[50:18] wife and just started railing on people
[50:20] and my wife said you know what well I'm
[50:22] going to commit that to prayer and I'm
[50:24] gonna if the Lord wants me to I'm going
[50:25] to go talk to him she said
[50:27] you're gonna what
[50:29] you're gonna say something about she
[50:31] says well yeah I'm not a garbage can
[50:34] you're going to tell me this I need to I
[50:36] need to bring it before the Lord if God
[50:37] wants me to do something about it I'm
[50:38] going to do something say well then I'm
[50:39] never going to tell you this kind of
[50:41] stuff again and my wife was like thank
[50:43] you
[50:45] you know why sometimes our Spirits are
[50:47] so defiled you've let your spirit become
[50:49] accessible you're letting things get
[50:51] sewn into your spirit a little bit of
[50:52] Gossip a little bit of dirt a little bit
[50:54] thing on that oh you want to know you
[50:55] want to get the latest bits and tidbits
[50:57] and he says the holy spirit is not
[50:59] accessible he says no no no no no no
[51:03] he says the heart is occupied by the
[51:06] Holy Spirit
[51:08] is full of Holiness Purity that's what
[51:10] the holy spirit is this is the way that
[51:12] we want it to operate according to First
[51:13] Corinthians 13 thinketh no evil doeth no
[51:15] evil believeth in all things endureth
[51:17] long-suffering
[51:19] see how practical it is that brother
[51:21] Madam just starts identifying little
[51:23] things in people's lives and instead of
[51:25] him doing a great big huge discourse on
[51:28] how effective our prayers could be when
[51:30] laying hands on the sick or the the
[51:31] right kind of oil to buy in order to
[51:34] properly anoint the sick with it and
[51:35] avoid Doterra by the Young Living in
[51:38] order that you might see the secret he
[51:40] stays way away from all the works of
[51:41] Matthew 7 and he starts talking about
[51:43] the way that we live our life and the
[51:45] kind of relationships we have with other
[51:46] people
[51:48] he says don't fuss
[51:51] when the family gets in a fuss don't
[51:53] fuss with them
[51:56] your mother said I ain't having you go
[51:58] up there that old church anymore well
[52:01] all you think about now you're letting
[52:02] your hair grow out you look like some
[52:04] old grandma don't fuss with her
[52:08] say okay mother it's all right I love
[52:10] you just the same
[52:12] and I'll be praying for you as long as I
[52:13] live
[52:14] he says now don't fuss
[52:16] think about how practical this is temper
[52:18] breeds temper
[52:20] first thing you know you grieve the holy
[52:22] spirit away from you you'll be fussing
[52:23] back
[52:25] then the Holy Spirit takes its flight
[52:28] temper breeds temper and love breeds
[52:29] love
[52:32] this is instructive to us
[52:34] how easy it is sometimes in our
[52:35] relationships with one another it can
[52:37] happen with siblings it happens between
[52:38] husband and wife it happens with parents
[52:39] to children where there's just a little
[52:41] bit of fuss and that's what you do you
[52:43] get into fuss
[52:44] right and when you get into in in fuss
[52:47] then if you fuss back
[52:50] and you meet that intensity with the
[52:52] same kind of response temper breeds
[52:53] Tipper child gets frustrated and angry
[52:56] and you respond with frustration and
[52:57] anger yourself he says it Grieves the
[52:59] Holy Spirit right away
[53:00] and has given us practical things that
[53:02] we can do in our daily life to kind of
[53:04] have that kind of quick discernment whoa
[53:05] I don't like where this is going a
[53:06] little bit uneasy you know what you can
[53:09] do if brother Branham says that when you
[53:11] get stirred up
[53:12] he says you better go pray first maybe
[53:14] it's okay in certain situations if
[53:17] things begin to escalate just say could
[53:18] I just have a moment
[53:20] let's just step back from this for a
[53:22] second let's just soften our Spirits a
[53:24] little bit we're getting it we're
[53:25] getting away from the very things that
[53:27] we're trying to fix here
[53:30] temper breeds temporary love breeds love
[53:32] be full of love Jesus said this will all
[53:35] men know
[53:36] you're my disciples when you have love
[53:37] one for another that's the fruit of the
[53:40] Holy Spirit love
[53:44] remember the title is your life worthy
[53:46] of the Gospel
[53:48] good enough to have been written said
[53:50] done or created by the gospel
[53:53] are the things I'm saying
[53:55] are they said by the gospel
[53:58] are the things I'm writing are they
[54:00] written by the gospel
[54:02] are the things that I'm creating
[54:06] are they created
[54:07] by the gospel
[54:10] brother Bama says
[54:12] then you've seen those
[54:14] excuse me
[54:17] and did you know you're a little Creator
[54:19] yourself
[54:21] you know that certainly
[54:24] did you know that
[54:25] you're a little creator
[54:28] you've seen people that you just love to
[54:29] be around
[54:31] you just don't know why just that loving
[54:33] type of person have you seen that just
[54:36] as kind there you like to be around them
[54:37] they create that atmosphere
[54:41] by the life they live
[54:43] the way they talk the conversation
[54:48] it's the life we live it's the things we
[54:50] talk about the openness that we have to
[54:53] talk about things that are positive
[54:55] it's the things that we walk away
[54:57] thinking about
[54:59] it's when there's times maybe where we
[55:01] find ourselves really doing good and
[55:03] we're encouraged and we're believing the
[55:05] word of God and you you meet somebody or
[55:07] you come in the presence of somebody and
[55:09] you're just saying hey man how are you
[55:10] doing they're like hey man did you know
[55:12] that by tomorrow morning the US dollar
[55:14] is gone
[55:16] that they're going to declare martial
[55:18] law how many times have you guys got the
[55:19] text message that tomorrow at noon
[55:21] they're going to declare martial law and
[55:23] Trump's going to be president again
[55:25] right
[55:26] and you know what we just let them keep
[55:28] lying and keep lying and keep lying and
[55:30] you let them keep making your holy your
[55:32] your spirit of Cesspool with that kind
[55:33] of nonsense
[55:35] it takes a victory away from you start
[55:37] thinking about other things
[55:39] he says they create that Atmosphere by
[55:41] the life they live the way they talk
[55:43] their conversation said this about
[55:45] Christ so there was just something about
[55:47] his talk that caught the heart of the
[55:49] people though he didn't have to be
[55:51] forceful about it in an outward
[55:53] demonstration but there was something
[55:55] down in his talk that fascinated the
[55:57] hearts of the people
[55:59] it wasn't because he was demonstrative
[56:00] it wasn't because he was charismatic I
[56:02] found myself being demonstrative and I
[56:04] caught myself
[56:05] it's the way that he talked
[56:07] it wasn't the way that he was forceful
[56:09] it wasn't his just finding the right
[56:11] kind of volume to the crescendo whereas
[56:13] he taught him the synagogue in those
[56:15] precious words proceeded from his mouth
[56:17] he didn't just find the right Cadence
[56:19] whereas in rhythm with their heartbeat
[56:20] and he knew just how to punctuate it and
[56:22] Mesmerize them with the piano playing
[56:24] and all sorts of music and instruments
[56:26] he just talked in a way that got their
[56:28] attention
[56:29] and it fascinated the hearts of the
[56:31] people
[56:32] by the same token we have the ability by
[56:34] the life we live and the things we talk
[56:36] about in our manner of living the things
[56:38] we promote we have the ability to create
[56:40] an atmosphere
[56:41] he said there's people like that he says
[56:43] then you've seen those every time you
[56:45] shunned them don't get too loud here
[56:47] all time they want to talk about
[56:49] something evil talk about somebody say
[56:51] oh my there they come
[56:54] they're going to criticize somebody
[56:55] there
[56:58] you know we're talking about in the
[57:00] apartment next door
[57:02] he's in here now he's going to talk
[57:04] about this man
[57:05] there's just this Instinct you know
[57:07] they're going to be negative they're
[57:08] going to be critical
[57:09] gonna run something down they're gonna
[57:10] find something bad to say he's here now
[57:13] he's going to talk about this man all
[57:14] they're doing is going to do is tell
[57:16] dirty jokes or something about women or
[57:18] something like that you just hate to get
[57:20] around them or at least you should right
[57:22] it should be something he's like I just
[57:23] don't know where my spirit always feels
[57:25] this way and and there's times you might
[57:27] you might want to start asking yourself
[57:29] take an inventory when you find an
[57:31] attitude creeping out and you find
[57:33] you're getting a little bit short with
[57:34] your husband you find yourself getting
[57:35] critical towards this and critical
[57:36] towards that you actually where have I
[57:38] been
[57:39] what have I been feeding on
[57:41] you take a sister that teaches in school
[57:43] and she's there dealing with third
[57:44] graders all day long and she's going to
[57:46] come home she's probably going to treat
[57:47] her husband like a third grader and she
[57:48] needs to take a step back think a little
[57:50] bit like no I'm at home with my husband
[57:52] different atmosphere different setting
[57:53] and you got to realize those things wear
[57:55] on you they control they control you
[57:57] they manipulate you and you find
[57:59] yourself fighting in your spirit you've
[58:00] become a cesspool and before you know it
[58:02] you're talking a certain way and driving
[58:04] a certain line it's good for us to take
[58:06] a step back and identify the things in
[58:08] our lives that are pushing us to the
[58:10] edge where we're no longer walking in
[58:13] the character of the word and I want to
[58:15] minister of Grace to all of us tonight
[58:16] and say it even with the thus saith the
[58:19] Lord there are Christians there are
[58:21] believers filled with the Holy Ghost who
[58:24] find themselves under pressure and
[58:26] because of the pressure and because of
[58:27] the long tongues and because of the
[58:29] false lifting up and all the things of
[58:31] the world they find themselves no longer
[58:33] acting in a way that's worthy of the
[58:36] Gospel that's so precious down on the
[58:38] inside of their soul
[58:42] you just hate to get around them they
[58:45] create
[58:46] seemingly pretty nice people but they
[58:48] create that atmosphere
[58:49] and the things that you think on and the
[58:52] things that you do
[58:54] the actions the things you talk about
[58:56] creates an atmosphere
[58:59] and this is the very statement
[59:02] that I started with
[59:04] this next statement
[59:06] and I hope that this could have
[59:09] uh just kind of bring down to this
[59:11] relevant as I was studying on Kingdom
[59:13] identity
[59:14] and the identity of the kingdom and
[59:16] women the identity of the kingdom and
[59:18] Men
[59:19] and how brother Branham thank God that
[59:21] we had a Prophet come in modern times
[59:24] and speak to us in a language that's
[59:26] preserved so that we could see the word
[59:30] of God address things in our lives
[59:31] whether it's a man or a woman to show
[59:34] what influence is operating in US
[59:37] and he starts it by talking about the
[59:38] influence of a woman who's visible
[59:40] and at the time there may be movie stars
[59:43] and fashion idols and things like that
[59:45] would have their preeminence on TV or on
[59:47] a screen and they would fashion
[59:49] themselves after a woman in as a first
[59:52] lady and I think it's important for us
[59:54] to take a step back and ask ourselves
[59:56] what kind of models are we looking at
[59:58] and how are we modeling our life whether
[1:00:01] it be in our our demeanor with one
[1:00:03] another the things we talk about the
[1:00:04] language we use and there's certain
[1:00:06] things that maybe we could kind of
[1:00:08] resurrect from our past and things we
[1:00:10] might do that may seem to be innocent
[1:00:11] but you've got to recognize just how
[1:00:13] much power you have as a Christian to
[1:00:16] sometimes even begin to marry in that
[1:00:18] something that's dead and it gives off
[1:00:20] Vibes and it's alive and somebody else
[1:00:22] can pick up on it and they can be
[1:00:24] infected by my
[1:00:26] where'd that come from you started it
[1:00:32] and this is I was bringing out some of
[1:00:35] these statements where Bear Mountain
[1:00:36] talks about how you watch a man and what
[1:00:39] he lifts up and what he promotes and
[1:00:40] you'll find out what kind of life he has
[1:00:43] he said I went into a man's office here
[1:00:45] in the city
[1:00:46] and the man is a trustee or a deacon it
[1:00:48] is in a fine Church
[1:00:50] and I went over to see that man about
[1:00:52] some business
[1:00:54] and there's a radio over there with that
[1:00:56] rock and roll or twist or whatever what
[1:00:57] it was just as hard as it could go
[1:01:00] so it's what we listen to
[1:01:04] you think about that it's what we listen
[1:01:06] to
[1:01:07] it's gotten watered down enough to where
[1:01:09] we find ourselves listening to things
[1:01:11] that you have been able to convince
[1:01:13] yourself there's nothing wrong with it
[1:01:15] now maybe so for you
[1:01:18] but what does your teenage son think
[1:01:20] when he hears it
[1:01:23] does he think oh well maybe there's
[1:01:24] nothing wrong with Bob Dylan
[1:01:26] maybe there's nothing wrong with Merle
[1:01:28] Haggard maybe there's nothing wrong with
[1:01:30] Kenny G or whatever else it might be
[1:01:32] that you listen to and you've done it
[1:01:34] because you're able your whole it goes
[1:01:35] filled you can filter these things out
[1:01:37] maybe it doesn't get a hook in you so
[1:01:39] you think but the others around you are
[1:01:41] watching it listen to it and they don't
[1:01:43] know
[1:01:44] they don't know that these things defile
[1:01:46] and they corrupt and it's building up
[1:01:48] these bulwarks and these strongholds
[1:01:50] within the spirit of somebody else and
[1:01:52] you're creating a stronghold of the
[1:01:55] enemy in the spirits of others if we
[1:01:58] just have Grace that it's not happening
[1:01:59] to you
[1:02:01] so it's what we listen to
[1:02:06] and I guess there was 40 Pinups in his
[1:02:08] office of nude women
[1:02:13] so it's what we look at
[1:02:17] now you can't tell me how much Deacon or
[1:02:19] how much more
[1:02:20] you let me see what you look at
[1:02:24] come on let's all think of ourselves
[1:02:26] tonight get rid of the Pitchfork get the
[1:02:28] rake out bring it home
[1:02:30] this is for me no matter how old you are
[1:02:32] how young you are it's what you look at
[1:02:35] what you read what kind of music you
[1:02:38] listen to the crowd you associate with
[1:02:42] and nowadays when we say the crowd you
[1:02:45] have got to take into consideration what
[1:02:48] kind of groups you're a part of socially
[1:02:50] in a digital world
[1:02:52] and I don't care if you're using some
[1:02:54] other name to hide your identity your
[1:02:57] spirit is attached to that
[1:02:59] come on the holy spirit is speaking out
[1:03:01] against things and Discerning things in
[1:03:03] people's lives and they have no idea
[1:03:05] where it's coming from but it's hidden
[1:03:07] itself very subtly behind a name and an
[1:03:09] avatar
[1:03:15] what you look at what you read the kind
[1:03:17] of music you listen to I'll say the
[1:03:19] reason why you preach this on a
[1:03:20] Wednesday night is because by the time
[1:03:22] you're done everyone who was there when
[1:03:23] you started still there
[1:03:25] I don't know if I can say that on a
[1:03:27] Sunday morning
[1:03:29] they'd be like I didn't even know we had
[1:03:30] Wednesday night service
[1:03:35] he says
[1:03:36] what you look at what you read what kind
[1:03:38] of music you listen to
[1:03:40] the crowd you associate and I'll tell
[1:03:42] you what kind of spirit is in you
[1:03:46] would we fail a test
[1:03:49] with all the the history erasing we can
[1:03:53] do
[1:03:55] with all the private browsing with all
[1:03:56] the deleting with all the Incognito with
[1:03:58] all the ways that we can cover our
[1:04:00] tracks all the ways that we can find the
[1:04:01] excuses in Luke 14 how we covered our
[1:04:04] tracks enough with all of our excuses
[1:04:07] that somehow we feel as if we would pass
[1:04:09] the test and brother Brown says let me
[1:04:11] see what you look at
[1:04:12] what you read what kind of music you
[1:04:14] listen to the crowd you associate with
[1:04:16] I'll tell you what spirit is in you
[1:04:19] and you talk about a man who's listened
[1:04:21] to some rock and roller twist and he has
[1:04:24] all these pin-ups I think you ought to
[1:04:26] make it a little bit more relative in a
[1:04:27] digital world
[1:04:29] what's on your wallpaper what kind of
[1:04:31] pins do you have on Pinterest what's
[1:04:33] written on your wall on Facebook what
[1:04:35] kind of boards are you posting to and
[1:04:37] reading what kind of forms what are the
[1:04:38] tweets what are the DMS
[1:04:40] one of the bookmarks the p1s the
[1:04:42] playlists the subscriptions the
[1:04:44] favorites the notifications what are you
[1:04:46] following what's your avatar
[1:04:50] what about the receipts
[1:04:52] hey
[1:04:53] what about the photos
[1:04:56] what about the screenshots
[1:05:07] if anyone feels a spectator in this
[1:05:12] and you feel that just maybe you're
[1:05:13] observing this and you're and you're and
[1:05:16] you're wrestling with this let me say
[1:05:17] there's a soul crying out tonight saying
[1:05:20] thank God
[1:05:22] thank God it's still thank God it can be
[1:05:24] spoken with such Precision because it's
[1:05:27] the very thing that loses shackles
[1:05:33] he says you hear a guy me do so and so
[1:05:35] that Bunch just remember I don't care
[1:05:37] what he says
[1:05:39] because he's again I mean notice how
[1:05:41] many times brother Benham comes back to
[1:05:42] the kind of punch at the church identity
[1:05:44] right decontrusty whatever I don't care
[1:05:48] he says his actions speak louder than
[1:05:51] what anything could say
[1:05:54] he could testify and say he's a
[1:05:55] Christian sure and maybe do anything but
[1:05:57] you just watch the kind of life he lives
[1:05:59] that tells what he is
[1:06:04] is our life
[1:06:06] Worthy
[1:06:07] of the Gospel
[1:06:09] as our musicians come as we bow our
[1:06:11] heads
[1:06:13] brother Branham comes to the end of the
[1:06:15] service and he says
[1:06:17] that word is the truth right
[1:06:20] and the spirit of God will recognize his
[1:06:23] own writing
[1:06:25] it speaks to him
[1:06:27] and you're identified by believing it
[1:06:30] and it gives your credentials of
[1:06:32] identification
[1:06:33] could I say this I'm not trying to add
[1:06:35] to what brother Branham said
[1:06:37] but we call ourselves message believers
[1:06:41] and I believe that this message is the
[1:06:43] word of God
[1:06:45] I believe it was sent to us
[1:06:47] to correct the age and just put it in
[1:06:49] order
[1:06:51] and what and this word is the truth
[1:06:55] and the spirit of God will recognize his
[1:06:57] own voice
[1:06:58] and we are identified by what it spoke
[1:07:02] and we're identified by believing and it
[1:07:04] gives us our credentials of
[1:07:05] identification I believe that we ought
[1:07:07] to take give a more Earnest heed to the
[1:07:09] things that we've been taught in this
[1:07:10] message
[1:07:11] again I will express it to you tonight
[1:07:13] this way by no means do I feel compelled
[1:07:17] to say this so that we are so that we
[1:07:20] could kind of create a little bit better
[1:07:21] Church image I'll go so far as to say
[1:07:23] this God had to completely wreck me and
[1:07:26] tear me down to even get me in this area
[1:07:28] to start to preach about it because for
[1:07:30] my Optics I would say I feel like we're
[1:07:32] doing pretty good
[1:07:35] and so it has nothing to do with church
[1:07:37] pretense as a matter of fact you could
[1:07:39] you could do all these things and and I
[1:07:41] I I don't have any mechanism to get into
[1:07:44] your home and call you out and try to
[1:07:46] get you to toe the line
[1:07:48] the only place that we might have some
[1:07:50] Authority as a church is in the
[1:07:52] positions that are occupied and those
[1:07:54] that serve there's certain
[1:07:56] qualifications and things that they
[1:07:57] would observe and a testimony that they
[1:07:59] would have before the people outside of
[1:08:01] that I don't care what how upside down
[1:08:03] your life is and how unworthy it seems I
[1:08:06] want to encourage you
[1:08:07] I want to give you the resources and
[1:08:09] tools you need to win the battles that
[1:08:10] you're needing to win
[1:08:12] is that our lives can be picked up
[1:08:13] that's the thing that's been coming to
[1:08:14] my heart over and over and over again
[1:08:15] perfect Faith all our lives need to be
[1:08:17] picked up
[1:08:21] brother Graham said don't fuss with
[1:08:22] others
[1:08:23] don't have these family fusses
[1:08:26] when you've been hurt when you've been
[1:08:28] wounded when you've been aggrieved
[1:08:30] sometimes it's cathartic just to kind of
[1:08:32] argue it out
[1:08:35] and don't think that the relief you feel
[1:08:37] after you've fought it out is the Holy
[1:08:39] Spirit and you coming back around
[1:08:42] you've already grieved that
[1:08:44] so he's reminding us this fussing has
[1:08:46] got to end
[1:08:47] don't have these family fusses
[1:08:50] maybe we need to find ways to continue
[1:08:51] with intense moments of Fellowship
[1:08:54] and stop with the nastiness and the
[1:08:56] pettiness and the cattiness and the
[1:08:57] bitterness and the harshness that
[1:08:59] surfaces when we have disagreement to
[1:09:01] hurts
[1:09:03] he said don't have these family fusses
[1:09:05] as I said love breeds love and temper
[1:09:07] breeds temper
[1:09:10] has the Holy Spirit got your attention
[1:09:11] tonight
[1:09:13] if you would not want to give the Holy
[1:09:15] Spirit the credit of it would you say
[1:09:16] that I have gotten your attention
[1:09:18] tonight
[1:09:21] at the very least I've given you
[1:09:22] something to wrestle with even if you
[1:09:24] want to say well that's just brother
[1:09:25] Aaron and well he's he just said this
[1:09:27] and he does this and he does that
[1:09:30] however you try to rationalize with it I
[1:09:32] would say whatever you do don't make
[1:09:33] them a mistake of giving the excuses
[1:09:36] that they gave in the days of Jesus
[1:09:38] brother bam said you might not say well
[1:09:40] I bought a piece of land I've married a
[1:09:42] wife I've I got to do this I've got to
[1:09:44] do that he says but you'll make your
[1:09:46] excuses
[1:09:49] I encourage you tonight not to make any
[1:09:51] excuses
[1:09:54] brother Aaron what about the things I
[1:09:57] wrestle with so deeply
[1:10:00] what about the things that become a
[1:10:01] compulsion
[1:10:03] what about the things that this pattern
[1:10:05] that I can't seem to break out of
[1:10:08] do you realize that the great victory
[1:10:11] that you can have in those things begins
[1:10:14] in a victory in the small things
[1:10:17] that if we could come back to an honesty
[1:10:19] about whether or not you have the Holy
[1:10:21] Ghost that begins the that the victory
[1:10:23] Bells begin to ring when we can be
[1:10:25] honest with ourselves that maybe
[1:10:26] something's missing because I've never
[1:10:28] fully surrendered and obeyed the word of
[1:10:30] God to receive the Holy Ghost and hey
[1:10:31] that's liberating
[1:10:34] those of us who even find ourselves
[1:10:36] filled with the Holy ghostly brother
[1:10:38] Branham use this language throughout
[1:10:40] this to talk about the holy spirit being
[1:10:41] grieved and uh grieving the Holy Spirit
[1:10:43] right away from you and we can find that
[1:10:45] in other places in the message maybe
[1:10:47] you're finding yourself giving into
[1:10:48] compulsion
[1:10:50] because other things more subtle have
[1:10:52] weakened the influence of the holy
[1:10:54] spirit in your life
[1:10:56] and begin when we begin to take
[1:10:59] inventory
[1:11:01] about how my life isn't Worthy
[1:11:04] it might find you might find
[1:11:08] that Victory begins in a much smaller
[1:11:10] space
[1:11:12] than you thought it would
[1:11:15] I'm hoping that you're thinking if you
[1:11:16] have you could bow your heads for a
[1:11:18] moment brother Branham is praying at the
[1:11:19] end of the service and I want to pray
[1:11:21] this
[1:11:22] [Music]
[1:11:26] he says we pray now
[1:11:28] I I I'll ask this is there an eating
[1:11:32] heart tonight
[1:11:33] needy Spirit are there needy homes
[1:11:34] sister Elizabeth let's raise our hand
[1:11:38] we have needs in our home we have needs
[1:11:41] in our life
[1:11:42] we have needs and relationships
[1:11:45] we have needs
[1:11:47] and when we think about everything
[1:11:48] brother was saying it just seems to be
[1:11:50] so vast it may be so complicated but
[1:11:53] listen to what he brings it down to we
[1:11:55] pray now that you'll bless every person
[1:11:57] in divine presence
[1:11:58] everyone that hears this tape Lord
[1:12:01] around the world
[1:12:02] may they get away from those old Creeds
[1:12:05] and things
[1:12:06] and come and serve the Living God and
[1:12:09] this is what got me come
[1:12:12] and invest in it
[1:12:15] how are we making investments in this
[1:12:18] church
[1:12:19] not as a church we invest weekly twice a
[1:12:22] week we invest for over an hour but how
[1:12:25] have you invested personally in your
[1:12:27] home
[1:12:28] how have you invested in it
[1:12:31] oh we commit our resources so much to
[1:12:34] learning disciplines and collecting
[1:12:36] things and accomplishing things and we
[1:12:39] have a lot to invest in but oh God how
[1:12:41] much have I invested in the Living God
[1:12:45] he says do like the queen of the South
[1:12:47] did she come took her three months to
[1:12:49] get to where a man was representing
[1:12:51] Jesus Christ or the god of Heaven
[1:12:52] Solomon Jesus says she come from the
[1:12:55] uttermost parts of the world to hear the
[1:12:56] wisdom of Solomon and behold a greater
[1:12:58] than Solomon is here he says and we know
[1:13:01] the greater that Solomon is here the
[1:13:04] great Holy Spirit himself is here
[1:13:05] working through the people he says how
[1:13:08] we thank you for this father I pray the
[1:13:11] blessing now and I say to you tonight
[1:13:14] who have your heads bowed Jesus Christ
[1:13:16] the same yesterday today and forever is
[1:13:20] here he's a person he is he is calling
[1:13:24] to your hearts he is asking for
[1:13:26] Fellowship he desires preeminence and he
[1:13:29] has lingered and he has lingered and he
[1:13:32] has hovered and he has that he has dealt
[1:13:35] with you softly and he has stayed near
[1:13:38] you and he now calls you will you invest
[1:13:42] in me
[1:13:44] not in church service
[1:13:47] will you invest in me
[1:13:51] and he says oh are greater than Solomon
[1:13:54] is here
[1:13:55] working through the people
[1:13:58] and I say God let it be
[1:14:00] that I could sell all I have that I
[1:14:03] could come to you and without with my
[1:14:06] whole heart that perfect love that you
[1:14:08] require let me present my body as a
[1:14:11] Living Sacrifice which is my reasonable
[1:14:14] service that I may serve you acceptably
[1:14:18] that I can have the testimony that Paul
[1:14:20] had you know my Doctrine my manner of
[1:14:24] living my purpose my faith my long
[1:14:26] suffering my charity my patience oh I
[1:14:29] pray tonight with your heads bowed I I
[1:14:32] pray tonight May there be a Deliverance
[1:14:34] come in our personal lives may there
[1:14:36] come a Deliverance to our digital
[1:14:38] addictions May there come and Deliver us
[1:14:40] to the things we desire the things we
[1:14:42] pursue May the Holy Spirit Come and
[1:14:45] begin to perform surgery May the word of
[1:14:48] God loose us from shackles that abound
[1:14:51] us and I pray that there would be births
[1:14:54] and that there'd be Souls liberated and
[1:14:57] that we would see a mighty move of God
[1:15:01] Hallelujah let's stand
