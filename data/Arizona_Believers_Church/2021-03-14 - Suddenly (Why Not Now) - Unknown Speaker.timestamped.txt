[0:00] galatians chapter 3 verses 1 to 9
[0:03] o foolish galatians who hath bewitched
[0:05] you that you should not obey the truth
[0:08] before whose eyes jesus christ hath been
[0:11] evidently set forth crucified among you
[0:14] this only what i learned of you receive
[0:16] ye the spirit by the works of the law
[0:18] or by the hearing of faith are you so
[0:20] foolish
[0:21] having begun in the spirit are you now
[0:23] made perfect by the flesh
[0:25] have you suffered so many things in vain
[0:27] if it be yet in vain
[0:29] he therefore that ministereth to you the
[0:31] spirit and worketh miracles among you
[0:33] doeth he by the works of the law or by
[0:36] the hearing of faith
[0:38] even as abraham believed god and it was
[0:39] accounted to him for righteousness
[0:41] know ye therefore that they which are of
[0:43] faith the same are the children of
[0:45] abraham
[0:45] and the scripture for seeing that god
[0:47] would justify the heathen through faith
[0:50] preach the gospel unto abraham saying in
[0:53] thee shall all nations be blessed
[0:55] so then they which be of faith are
[0:57] blessed with faithful
[0:59] abraham let's bow our heads in a word of
[1:01] prayer
[1:02] our heavenly father we are just basking
[1:05] in your glory today
[1:06] we are enjoying your presence we looked
[1:09] out upon the congregation and though we
[1:11] see
[1:12] several families that are gone because
[1:14] of travel and because of moving
[1:16] uh certain situations and for vacation
[1:19] spring break lord we still see some that
[1:22] are gathered here today that
[1:24] the devil tried to keep away and tried
[1:26] to physically hinder from coming and
[1:28] different weaknesses of the flesh and
[1:29] circumstances so lord we see victory
[1:32] we see a rejoicing in the people's
[1:34] hearts to be able to be here today
[1:36] and lord i pray that you would bless
[1:38] those that are streaming those that have
[1:41] listened to the archive those that are
[1:42] here present with us
[1:44] that in engaging in that activity lord
[1:47] we're not doing it just to find out
[1:48] who's at church or what brother aaron
[1:50] has to say
[1:51] or lord it's not even done to be
[1:53] critical to try to find something to
[1:55] trip me up on lord but those that will
[1:57] hear are coming
[1:58] to hear your word and to receive from
[2:00] you so i pray lord that you would make
[2:02] this
[2:03] edifying and beneficial to your body
[2:05] that you would be glorified in it that
[2:07] you would take control of this service
[2:08] for your glory
[2:10] lord as we have different needs that
[2:11] have been mentioned in our church and
[2:14] mentioned before the people we are
[2:16] desiring that you would come upon the
[2:18] scene
[2:18] lord we have anointed with oil and we've
[2:21] prayed for the sick and we keep hearing
[2:23] testimony after testimony of your
[2:25] healing power delivering from cancers
[2:28] and
[2:29] unstopping ears that couldn't hear lord
[2:31] just so many different testimonies in
[2:33] our midst
[2:33] it gives us confidence to believe that
[2:35] as we pray for sister morgan's
[2:37] grandmothers we pray for brother elias
[2:39] lord as we pray for these
[2:40] different needs that have been lifted up
[2:42] as we pray for brother james hayes lord
[2:45] we just know that you'll come upon the
[2:46] scene and you'll you'll do miracles and
[2:49] you can bring to pass those things which
[2:50] are pleasing in your sight
[2:52] so today lord as we stand in your divine
[2:54] presence
[2:55] we desire to hear from you come take the
[2:58] bread of life and speak to us we pray
[3:00] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[3:02] amen amen you may have your seats
[3:07] i'll give you my title in just a few
[3:10] moments
[3:10] and i want to let you know up front that
[3:13] i'm
[3:14] preaching a one-off or maybe just a
[3:16] different sermon a singular sermon today
[3:18] not continuing
[3:20] in the line of um what does wisdom look
[3:23] at
[3:23] look like so if you're one of those
[3:25] types where you take a lot of notes and
[3:27] you're praying and you're under
[3:28] expectation and you're reading in your
[3:30] bible
[3:31] and then you try to anticipate where i'm
[3:33] going so you're trying to see how these
[3:34] things fit i'm going to do you a favor
[3:36] by saying
[3:37] i'm going into on a completely different
[3:38] direction different subject this morning
[3:40] if you could let's look at verse 2 in
[3:43] our text galatians chapter 3 verse 2
[3:46] as this is speaking about the just
[3:48] living by faith
[3:50] and how there is only one faith and one
[3:52] faith in jesus christ and he's
[3:54] using the phrase foolish galatians and
[3:57] how they've been bewitched
[3:59] to not obey and he's getting to the
[4:01] heart of where they're
[4:02] what they're getting into to keep them
[4:04] from obeying and in verse two he says
[4:06] this
[4:07] only what i learn of you receive ye the
[4:09] spirit by the works of the law
[4:11] or by the hearing of faith he's asking
[4:14] them the question did you receive the
[4:15] seal of god did you receive the holy
[4:17] ghost
[4:18] were you born again by works is it
[4:20] something you did is it something you
[4:22] accomplished
[4:23] did you receive this by keeping of the
[4:25] law or was it by the
[4:26] hearing of faith he revisits the same
[4:29] question in verse five he there
[4:31] therefore that ministereth to you the
[4:33] spirit and worketh miracles among you
[4:35] doeth he by the works of the law or by
[4:38] the hearing of faith
[4:40] so he's asking the works that you see
[4:42] the things that are made manifest in
[4:44] your presence after he
[4:45] has already established that you have
[4:48] not received the spirit
[4:49] uh by the works of the law and if you
[4:52] received it by grace and you received it
[4:54] by faith and
[4:54] are you now made perfect by the flesh he
[4:57] asked it in this way so then also ponder
[4:59] that if these things were accomplished
[5:01] by the hearing of faith then you should
[5:03] look at the totality of everything else
[5:05] that the preaching of the word the
[5:06] working of miracles among you
[5:08] is not done by the works of the flesh or
[5:10] the works of the law but by
[5:12] the hearing of faith and so the hearing
[5:14] of faith
[5:15] consists not in working but in receiving
[5:19] the hearing of faith as he's putting in
[5:21] this in this context and he's using this
[5:22] phrase
[5:23] to delineate from the works of the law
[5:25] bringing stuff to pass and bringing a
[5:27] promise to you
[5:28] and how a promise is fulfilled he says
[5:30] it's it's in
[5:31] receiving faith consists not in your
[5:33] works and not in the law
[5:35] but in receiving so he's saying you have
[5:37] not merited
[5:38] the holy ghost you did not earn that you
[5:41] did not work your way into the baptism
[5:42] of the holy ghost
[5:43] he's saying the miracles that are right
[5:45] among you are not worked into and
[5:47] practiced into
[5:48] these things are done by the hearing of
[5:50] faith and so the
[5:52] word preached produces a faith to
[5:55] receive the holy spirit he's saying you
[5:57] receive the spirit by the hearing of
[5:58] faith so the gospel preached
[6:00] work within you to produce a faith to
[6:02] receive the spirit he's saying the same
[6:05] is how you benefit from the miracles of
[6:07] the spirit the word preached the word
[6:09] ministered
[6:10] raises your faith to believe and then to
[6:12] receive miracles and that's how miracles
[6:14] are wrought among the congregation
[6:16] and that's how and even within the body
[6:19] of christ and this is what paul
[6:21] is trying to say don't be foolish don't
[6:23] be bewitched
[6:24] it's by the hearing of faith when he
[6:26] writes to the romans he says in romans
[6:28] chapter 10 verse 17
[6:30] so then faith cometh by hearing in
[6:32] hearing by the word of god
[6:34] so this is a principle that we all
[6:37] understand but i'm wanting just to raise
[6:39] it here in the beginning
[6:41] to lay some of these principles how that
[6:43] faith comes by hearing
[6:44] of the word of god that we have faith
[6:46] because we have heard the word
[6:48] you do not get faith by hearing fables
[6:50] you do not get faith by hearing a lie
[6:52] you do not get faith by uh just reading
[6:54] a science fiction novel but you get
[6:56] faith by the word of god
[6:58] so faith's final resting place is in the
[7:01] word as you hear the word
[7:02] as you receive the word it instigates
[7:04] and inspires faith
[7:06] and it's that hearing of faith that
[7:08] hearing of faith as paul refers to it
[7:10] that is going that allows one to receive
[7:12] the spirit it's the hearing of faith
[7:14] that allows someone to receive a miracle
[7:16] that's the principle by which the word
[7:18] operates so faith comes by hearing
[7:20] and hearing by the word of god as we
[7:23] hear the word
[7:24] it brings faith and it produces a faith
[7:27] so my title today
[7:28] is suddenly this is this is the title
[7:31] that i'm wanting to use
[7:32] is suddenly just this phrase suddenly
[7:35] and so the suddenness this immediate
[7:37] immediately i'm wanting to think in
[7:38] terms of something happening very
[7:39] quickly very suddenly
[7:41] and i'm asking the question why not now
[7:45] and i'm i'm preaching this this morning
[7:49] to build your faith and maybe for some
[7:53] it would be just a little bit of a
[7:54] recalibration of faith or just to orient
[7:56] our faith because our faith must be
[7:59] a word only faith our faith must only be
[8:02] to the word
[8:03] it must only be to god there are certain
[8:05] things that we could be looking to
[8:08] for god to accomplish and so we say well
[8:10] i believe this is going to work
[8:12] and this is going to achieve a certain
[8:13] result but our confidence has to be into
[8:16] in the god who led us in that path we
[8:19] can't just say well i've got confidence
[8:20] that jeff bezos is going to make the
[8:22] right decisions to keep amazon prime at
[8:24] the price that it is now
[8:25] for the next five years otherwise it's
[8:27] gonna break my budget but if you felt
[8:29] that god had quickened that to you that
[8:30] he can move upon the heart of a
[8:32] billionaire
[8:33] to keep prices stable so that your
[8:34] budget doesn't break then your
[8:36] confidence isn't in capitalism your
[8:38] confidence is in a god
[8:40] who's promised to keep you and so that's
[8:42] where our faith must
[8:43] always rest not not in your own wisdom
[8:46] not in your own abilities
[8:47] not in certain things that the the
[8:49] indicators are trending the right way
[8:51] but i we're wanting to speak to
[8:54] something that will build your faith
[8:56] and then even help us to take faith
[8:58] which is strong
[9:00] and place it solely in the word of god
[9:02] because it's the only place strong faith
[9:04] is effective
[9:05] you can have a lot of faith and a lot of
[9:07] confidence but project it towards the
[9:09] wrong things
[9:10] and your faith isn't going to bring you
[9:11] the benefit that it can like you can
[9:13] when it's
[9:14] it's projected into the word so keep
[9:16] this thought in mind suddenly
[9:18] this this is a phrase that was just
[9:20] working within my heart suddenly
[9:22] and we're going to be asking the
[9:23] question why not now and this is
[9:25] derived from a subject that i've been
[9:27] studying for a few months now to
[9:28] minister on
[9:30] called christ my healer not just christ
[9:33] the
[9:33] healer but christ my healers the lord
[9:35] has been dealing with my heart very
[9:36] deeply
[9:37] about divine healing and not only in the
[9:40] context of divine healing but even the
[9:42] healing of the soul
[9:43] the deliverance of the deliverance of
[9:45] our spirits from certain bondages and
[9:47] weaknesses or addictions
[9:49] uh thinking in terms of redemption and
[9:51] restoration and so there's a lot of
[9:53] different ways that the word of god
[9:54] works within our lives to accomplish
[9:56] certain things
[9:57] and we can say it through salvation and
[9:59] the new birth experience
[10:01] by sealing me into the body of christ
[10:02] this is this is a salvation of the soul
[10:05] and that works by faith that's a healing
[10:07] of the soul
[10:08] and then we may think well we're
[10:10] thinking of terms we need divine healing
[10:11] we need god to heal our bodies then
[10:13] then this is a promise within the word
[10:15] of god but then there's also
[10:16] the redeeming of something that we've
[10:18] lost that doesn't relate to physical
[10:20] healing
[10:21] that doesn't relate to matters of a a
[10:23] sin-sick soul
[10:24] but relates to things that we've
[10:26] experienced whether joy or whether
[10:28] relationships there's a restoration a
[10:29] redemption
[10:30] and we look to christ to accomplish any
[10:33] of those things
[10:35] and so i those those are some of the
[10:36] things i've been pondering and i just
[10:38] felt the lord dealt with my heart
[10:39] to speak on this even as a foundation
[10:41] that we could point back to
[10:43] that if we're going to be believing for
[10:44] restoration or redemption or a miracle
[10:47] our faith has to be in the right things
[10:50] brother braham says if our faith is set
[10:52] right
[10:52] and in the right position it gives a
[10:54] constant satisfaction
[10:56] that's what i want i want a constant
[10:58] satisfaction
[11:00] i don't necessarily even want something
[11:01] that's just up and down and up and down
[11:04] and i'm
[11:04] and i'm i'm just always in this valley
[11:07] and looking forward to a mountaintop but
[11:08] i want something constant and steady
[11:10] and so if my faith is set right and in
[11:13] the right position so i'm in the right
[11:15] position
[11:15] and i'm oriented correctly my attitude
[11:17] is correct then it gives a
[11:19] constant satisfaction so this is a
[11:22] reorientation of our faith this is
[11:24] checking our attitude
[11:25] and our altitude to make sure that we're
[11:27] going in the right direction and we're
[11:28] traveling
[11:29] in the right trajectory now continue on
[11:32] this subject of faith and the foundation
[11:34] here
[11:35] romans chapter 4 verse 14 says for if
[11:38] they which are
[11:38] of the law be heirs faith is made
[11:42] void and the promise made of none effect
[11:45] now in the context that he's speaking of
[11:47] there's a lot more
[11:48] that should be shared if you're wanting
[11:50] to
[11:51] amplify the point that he's saying about
[11:53] they that be of the law if you're saying
[11:56] if you're solely
[11:57] those that keep the law and those that
[11:59] adhere to the law
[12:01] were made inherited and received the
[12:03] promise or were heirs
[12:04] he says there's avoiding of faith that
[12:06] faith is nullified faith is
[12:08] is not even relevant does not play a
[12:10] factor and he says and the promise is
[12:11] made of not effect
[12:13] so faith if faith is rendered useless
[12:17] then the word cannot be effective in
[12:20] this instance he's saying that if it's
[12:21] if it's by the works of the law if it's
[12:23] merely in the keeping of something
[12:24] then we have no need of faith and if you
[12:26] have no need of faith then the promise
[12:28] can be of no effect
[12:29] so wherever faith is rendered useless
[12:31] the word of god cannot be effective
[12:34] and this is an important principle for
[12:36] us to always always remember
[12:38] that if we if we see a promise in the
[12:41] word of god and we and it doesn't come
[12:43] to pass
[12:44] the problem problem is not with the
[12:46] promise
[12:47] the problem the problem is never the
[12:49] word the word is perfect
[12:51] the problem can be our faith towards the
[12:52] word or it could be our understanding of
[12:54] the promise
[12:56] that we could be misunderstanding the
[12:57] promise well the bible says this the
[12:59] word of god says that so that means this
[13:01] and our problem is the conclusion or the
[13:03] assumptions that we're making
[13:05] but it's never the seed of the word of
[13:07] god the word of god is perfect it is
[13:09] pure
[13:10] and so when when faith is rendered void
[13:13] is this
[13:13] faith is made void and faith being made
[13:15] void the promise is made of
[13:16] none effect it's no longer effective
[13:19] then
[13:19] this is then we want to always remember
[13:21] that our faith has to be set right in
[13:23] the right position
[13:24] towards the word of god in order for the
[13:26] word to be effective on
[13:27] us jesus says in mark chapter 7 verse 13
[13:31] that they had made the word of god and
[13:33] he makes this statement a couple places
[13:34] or it's
[13:35] written differently by the different
[13:36] apostles making the word of god of not
[13:39] effect
[13:40] through your tradition so the word of
[13:42] god though it is effective though it has
[13:44] power though it has life
[13:46] though there was a promise attached to
[13:48] honor thy father and thy mother and
[13:51] and if you do this you'll have long days
[13:52] upon the earth he's saying the word of
[13:54] god was made of no
[13:55] effect it was not effective did not
[13:58] produce the desired result
[13:59] through tradition so tradition can
[14:02] intervene
[14:03] and change the effectiveness of the
[14:04] promise of god
[14:06] it says in matthew chapter 13 verse 58
[14:09] about christ he did not
[14:10] many mighty works there because of their
[14:13] unbelief
[14:14] it's not because christ wasn't capable
[14:16] of mighty works
[14:17] it's not because they weren't uh they
[14:19] didn't need
[14:20] mighty works but rather unbelief
[14:22] hindered the mighty works from being
[14:24] made manifest
[14:26] so paul says that when faith is made
[14:28] void the promises
[14:29] of none effect jesus is saying that
[14:31] traditions could have so much
[14:32] preeminence to where the power of the
[14:34] word of god
[14:35] is of none effect and now jesus was
[14:38] unable to perform mighty works
[14:40] because of unbelief even in hebrews
[14:43] chapter 3 as we've been reading that
[14:44] ourselves personally and pondering the
[14:46] rest that god has left for the elect
[14:48] says so we see that they could not enter
[14:50] in enter into rest
[14:52] because of unbelief the rest was there
[14:55] it was available it was even promised to
[14:56] them and god's saying hey
[14:58] come on enter into rest but they
[15:01] couldn't because of their own unbelief
[15:03] there was something in their confidence
[15:06] in their trust and their understanding
[15:08] that was keeping them from entering into
[15:10] rest and it was unbelief at the root of
[15:12] it
[15:12] unbelief that kept mighty works from
[15:14] being done unbelief that causes
[15:16] the word of god to be of none effect so
[15:19] avoided faith produces an
[15:20] ineffective promise when our faith is
[15:23] made void
[15:24] a promise cannot be effective now this
[15:27] is one of a couple principles i'm
[15:28] wanting to use
[15:29] in the beginning to establish i'm going
[15:31] to mention it here just a moment about
[15:33] i'm wanting just to preface it by saying
[15:34] there's a couple principles
[15:36] that i'm trying to lay in a foundation
[15:37] to come to a few scriptures to point out
[15:40] something
[15:41] and it's just going to be a very uh
[15:43] short
[15:44] sermon in one sense very directed very
[15:46] focused to build our faith so i don't
[15:49] i'm not planning on
[15:50] uh just plodding along and laying in a
[15:52] lot of things but just
[15:53] i want to make this statement here for
[15:55] talking about faith being
[15:57] avoided and this requires just some
[16:00] uh amp amplifying on my part and i'm
[16:02] just not sure how to express
[16:03] this but we ought to never use a part of
[16:07] the word
[16:08] to weaken the faith that we have in
[16:10] another part of the word
[16:13] and it sounds by the response it sounds
[16:14] like um i made more of this in my mind
[16:16] than i should have because in my mind
[16:18] i'm thinking
[16:18] this is such a big thing i've really got
[16:20] to be able to express this
[16:22] but if we have faith in a particular
[16:23] promise of god and we feel that this
[16:25] faith is rising
[16:27] i believe this i believe this for me and
[16:29] then we find
[16:30] somewhere else in the word of god
[16:32] another promise another statement
[16:35] something else another
[16:36] principle or even another circumstance
[16:37] of the scripture
[16:39] we should never let that work against
[16:42] the work with this in a way to weaken
[16:44] our faith in it
[16:46] so if we have faith in the word of god
[16:48] for something then
[16:49] no other part of the word of god can if
[16:51] placed properly
[16:52] weakened the faith you have in another
[16:54] promise i'm believing the promise of the
[16:57] scripture that says
[16:58] this shall be and then you read another
[17:00] scripture that says and this shall be
[17:02] that should not weaken the faith that
[17:04] you have in the promise of god
[17:07] so don't let faith in a promise become
[17:09] void because you have some sort of
[17:11] carnal interpretation of another promise
[17:14] because when you do that you make the
[17:15] word compete against the word
[17:18] it's word versus word well the word of
[17:20] god says that this is gonna happen
[17:22] but the word of god says this is gonna
[17:23] happen and we use it in such a way to
[17:25] say
[17:26] well god says it's gonna rain in the
[17:27] morning but the word of god says it
[17:28] won't rain in the morning and you can't
[17:30] get it that way
[17:32] you can't make them compete to decrease
[17:35] your faith
[17:36] the lord taught me a huge lesson one
[17:38] time about fleecing
[17:41] i prayed and i asked the lord if you
[17:42] want me to do something then when
[17:44] it hadn't rained for some time i believe
[17:46] and i said lord if you want me to
[17:48] uh i can't remember which whether we
[17:50] were in a drought or monsoon season or
[17:51] non-soon whatever it was
[17:53] i was living in texas at the time so
[17:55] there's no monsoons there
[17:57] but this was as a very very young
[17:58] christian i pray lord if you if you want
[18:00] me to do something
[18:01] then um then let it let it not be
[18:04] raining in the morning and i think it
[18:05] had been raining for some time and i
[18:06] woke up it was just dry
[18:09] and i was like well there you go fell
[18:11] back to sleep
[18:12] woke up raining cats and dogs well then
[18:15] which one is it
[18:17] you know which one do i go by and you'll
[18:19] find that fleecing
[18:20] is generally not a very good uh it's not
[18:23] a principle that you flip through your
[18:24] bottom we find everywhere i read i'm
[18:26] told to fleece i've told the fleece no
[18:28] you need to understand the context of
[18:29] the fleecing because you can fleece in a
[18:32] way to where you're
[18:32] you're asking god to compete against his
[18:34] promises
[18:36] and so you want to use a wisdom and how
[18:37] that you pray wisdom how you approach a
[18:39] promise
[18:39] because we cannot make the word compete
[18:41] against the word
[18:43] the bible says in john chapter 1 verse
[18:45] 12 but as many as received him and i'm
[18:47] going to use this as an example
[18:49] but as many as received him to them gave
[18:51] he power to become the sons of god
[18:53] even to them that believe on his name so
[18:56] the promise is that if you receive him
[18:58] and believe on his name then you are
[18:59] given power to become the sons of god
[19:02] then we ought to believe that that
[19:03] promise is true and then have faith that
[19:05] if i receive him he will give me power
[19:08] by my faith in him to become a son of
[19:10] god but then when we read in john
[19:12] chapter 6 verse 64 it says but there are
[19:14] some of you that believe not
[19:16] we ought not to reason with that and say
[19:18] well then i guess that might be me
[19:20] because the bible says there's some that
[19:22] believe not don't take your faith
[19:24] in the promise that says you are that
[19:26] you are healed or you're sealed or
[19:28] you're saved or you are delivered
[19:29] there's a promise that you're believing
[19:31] and then read another scripture and say
[19:32] well i guess maybe this means i might
[19:34] not be
[19:36] because then you're taking this faith
[19:37] that you have in one part of the word of
[19:38] god
[19:39] and then you're actually starting to
[19:40] project it incorrectly towards another
[19:43] promise
[19:43] and you have divided you've divided your
[19:45] faith in a way to where you're causing
[19:47] you're letting a misinterpretation of
[19:49] the word of god a misplacing of faith in
[19:51] another promise
[19:52] of god weaken your faith in another
[19:54] promise
[19:55] the bible says jesus says i will not
[19:57] leave you comfortless but i will come to
[19:59] you
[20:00] that's a promise that you can believe it
[20:01] you can believe in the promise of
[20:02] comfort
[20:03] it's replete through the new testament
[20:05] god is there to comfort you the comfort
[20:07] of scripture the comfort of one another
[20:09] the comfort of the holy ghost but then
[20:10] you can't read other places that say
[20:12] well the believer is going to go through
[20:14] hard trials and if you're not suffering
[20:15] you're not being made perfect
[20:16] and read all these other scriptures to
[20:18] conclude well i guess i must not
[20:20] have comfort or must not deserve comfort
[20:22] or the promise of comfort must not be
[20:24] for me
[20:24] you're making the word of god compete
[20:26] it's word versus word
[20:29] and you can't do that if he made you a
[20:31] promise of comfort that means
[20:32] he has promised to be there as a
[20:34] comforter through your suffering through
[20:36] your trials through your adversities
[20:37] through your difficulties
[20:39] and you can take the same faith that
[20:40] causes you to believe that there
[20:42] absolutely will be comfort
[20:43] and cause it to remain strong when you
[20:45] believe that i will endure suffering
[20:48] so it's amazing it's a matter of us
[20:52] allowing the word of god in one place to
[20:54] weaken our faith
[20:56] in a promise of god and if we do that
[20:58] there must be a misunderstanding
[21:01] if we believe in very strongly for
[21:03] something and then we read another
[21:04] statement we hear another verse we
[21:06] we listen to the word preached and it
[21:08] causes us to we our faith to be weakened
[21:10] then either we have not heard the word
[21:12] or you misunderstand the word which you
[21:14] have heard
[21:16] so never let the word of god compete
[21:18] with itself
[21:20] election does not work against grace
[21:22] predestination does not work against
[21:24] faith these are things that harmonize
[21:27] and they work together
[21:29] one part doesn't cancel out the other
[21:31] part
[21:32] well faith without works is dead so then
[21:35] you have to have works but it doesn't
[21:36] cancel out faith
[21:38] faith without works is dead so you have
[21:40] to have works you have to have fruits of
[21:41] the spirit
[21:42] it's you have to do this but it doesn't
[21:44] cancel out um election
[21:46] he said it's god it's neither him nor
[21:48] willeth or him that runeth but god
[21:50] that showeth mercy but it doesn't
[21:52] nullify your will and you're running
[21:55] some of us read that and say well i'm
[21:56] not going to want and i'm not going to
[21:57] run
[21:58] and that's a misinterpretation of saying
[22:00] if you're running and if you're willing
[22:02] it doesn't matter if god doesn't show
[22:03] mercy
[22:04] so the word one part promise doesn't
[22:06] void out another promise of god
[22:08] in the sense that it nullifies it makes
[22:10] it ineffective or
[22:12] declares that it's not true so when god
[22:15] makes a promise this is a very
[22:16] elementary
[22:17] way of expressing this when god makes a
[22:19] promise we accept it by faith
[22:21] and if we've accepted a promise by faith
[22:23] then we patiently wait for it
[22:26] that's all that we're asked to do if we
[22:27] if we accept god makes a promise then we
[22:29] accept it by faith
[22:30] and then we can say then i believe that
[22:32] the promise is mine
[22:34] in luke chapter 24 verse 49 here's an
[22:36] example of a promise and then what the
[22:38] what you must do and behold i send the
[22:41] promise of my father upon you
[22:43] but tarry ye in the city of jerusalem
[22:45] until you be endued with power from on
[22:47] high
[22:48] so he says i the promise i'm going to
[22:50] send the promise so terry it means sit
[22:51] settle
[22:53] until the promise comes when the
[22:55] promises are made then stay fixed stand
[22:57] fast stand as paul says stand there for
[22:59] him
[23:00] and you're standing firm in the promise
[23:02] you're believing when god makes a
[23:04] promise accepted by faith
[23:05] and stand steady if he promises that
[23:08] he'll put a sword in your hand
[23:09] supernaturally and he says if you just
[23:11] keep your hand out i'll drop a sword in
[23:13] your hand then you just accept it by
[23:14] faith and you keep your hand out
[23:17] and you don't start getting impatient
[23:18] saying well maybe i should run to the
[23:19] thrift store and buy a sword no keep
[23:21] your hand
[23:22] out he made a promise so in acts chapter
[23:25] 1 verse 4
[23:26] it says and being assembled together
[23:27] with them commanded them that they
[23:29] should not depart from jerusalem so now
[23:30] the disciples and those
[23:32] 120 are gathered together in jerusalem
[23:34] according to the promise they say
[23:36] so that god told them the promise is to
[23:38] you i will send it but terry in
[23:40] jerusalem
[23:40] until so they have this promise until
[23:43] so now the scripture describes their
[23:46] obedience to that promise they've been
[23:47] assembled together
[23:48] and they wait for the promise of the
[23:51] father which saith he
[23:52] you have heard of me and in bibles that
[23:56] capture
[23:56] the sayings of jesus in the red letter
[23:59] the wait for the promise of the father
[24:01] is in red
[24:02] and then ye have heard of me is in red
[24:05] so these are the words of jesus that
[24:06] they're obeying
[24:07] he said that he would send the promise
[24:09] of the father so we've got to go to
[24:11] jerusalem
[24:12] and wait until the time of the
[24:15] fulfilling of the promise
[24:16] so hearing the promise hearing the
[24:18] promise of god hearing the promise from
[24:20] jesus
[24:20] excited of faith that brought them into
[24:23] obedience and under expectation
[24:25] he said to go to jerusalem wait so what
[24:26] did they do they were excited to go to
[24:28] jerusalem and wait
[24:29] and now they're under anticipation of
[24:31] the promise
[24:32] we made this statement of brother
[24:34] branham's a few times recently every man
[24:36] that has ever had
[24:37] the spiritual revealed truth of the will
[24:39] of god makes preparation for the
[24:41] fulfillment
[24:42] if you ever have the spirit the truth of
[24:45] the word of god
[24:46] spiritually revealed to you then you
[24:48] make ready for the promise
[24:50] whatever that is you make preparation
[24:52] you put yourself in position to benefit
[24:54] from it
[24:55] so every man that has had the truth of
[24:57] god spiritually revealed to them
[24:59] makes proud rape makes preparation and
[25:01] readies them to receive it
[25:04] and so there's a confidence that comes
[25:07] it's an expectation of faith
[25:09] that that as i said is bringing us under
[25:12] expectation or this is faith that brings
[25:14] us under expectation
[25:15] so it's confident and it's an
[25:16] expectation that's very if i i
[25:19] tried to think of a way just to describe
[25:20] it it's anxious but it's patient
[25:24] it's under it's it's eager it's under
[25:26] eager anticipation but it's at rest
[25:29] it's like i can't wait it's coming
[25:32] this is gonna this is gonna be great and
[25:34] uh and i guess maybe
[25:36] like my children whenever they get
[25:37] excited it's just for elliot doesn't do
[25:39] it very much anymore but boom boom boom
[25:41] boom boom boom
[25:42] and you know they're just jumping up and
[25:44] down in place and it's just really
[25:46] really it's like hey what are you so
[25:48] excited about
[25:49] and so in some ways maybe maybe we're
[25:51] kind of doing the same thing we're not
[25:53] running around but inside our faith is
[25:54] going boing
[25:55] boing boing boing it's coming
[25:57] chick-fil-a's coming we're gonna get it
[25:59] and you're all really really excited
[26:00] because you just believe so it's an
[26:02] eager anticipation
[26:03] but it's confident in that rest it's not
[26:05] are you joking are you for real is this
[26:07] serious but it's something just so
[26:09] knows it's going to happen so there's
[26:11] this eager anticipation that comes
[26:14] paul when writing about a promise that
[26:15] is being waited for that you believe
[26:17] absolutely in he says in romans chapter
[26:19] 8 verse 24
[26:21] but if we hope for that we for that we
[26:23] see not
[26:24] so if you believe for something and you
[26:26] don't see it then he says then we
[26:30] then do we with patience wait for it
[26:34] if you have real hope according to a
[26:35] promise if you have if you've been by
[26:38] faith
[26:38] believe a promise is coming then faith
[26:41] births a hope an expectation an earnest
[26:44] expectation
[26:44] that you will see it so if you have not
[26:47] received it then there still has to be a
[26:48] hope
[26:49] and expectation that it's going to come
[26:51] so then you do with patience wait for it
[26:53] when god makes a promise you accept it
[26:55] by faith
[26:55] and then we patiently wait for the
[26:57] fulfillment the receiving of the promise
[27:00] now i want to i would love to and by
[27:02] god's grace maybe we'll have the
[27:03] opportunity to spend more time on this
[27:05] subject
[27:06] but there's the wrong kind of hope
[27:09] there's a dark side of hope if we could
[27:10] put it that way that can actually work
[27:12] against
[27:13] your realization of or the the
[27:15] acceptance
[27:16] of the promise actually receiving of the
[27:18] promise the fulfillment of the promise
[27:20] of god in your life can be hindered
[27:22] through the wrong kind of hope
[27:24] brother man makes the statement just a
[27:25] few times but he's identifying a carnal
[27:28] hope
[27:29] and a carnal attitude which we cannot
[27:31] confuse for faith or scriptural hope
[27:33] that is joined with faith and charity
[27:35] but a carnal kind of hope
[27:37] that actually is an enemy to faith and
[27:39] he says it this way
[27:40] little timid hope lovely and sweet as
[27:43] she is
[27:44] yet she's the greatest enemy faith has
[27:47] if there's a sister hope here today we
[27:49] we know exactly what he's talking about
[27:50] we're not talking about
[27:51] little sister hope over there she's so
[27:53] sweet and timid and she's like
[27:55] i didn't know i was the greatest enemy
[27:56] to faith why did you name me hope
[27:59] but little timid hope lovely and sweet
[28:01] as she is yet she's the greatest enemy
[28:03] faith has
[28:04] that's right and could you imagine twin
[28:06] sisters one named faith one named hope
[28:08] and faith is over the one you got that
[28:09] right
[28:11] that's right the greatest enemy faith's
[28:13] got is hope because a person that
[28:15] becomes so hopeful
[28:17] be till they leave away from faith
[28:21] brother branham is not he doesn't spend
[28:23] a lot of time amplifying what this means
[28:25] but he's saying that he characterizes
[28:28] the timidity the the this this uh
[28:31] uh little timid hope who seems lovely
[28:34] and sweet
[28:35] but someone gets so hopeful to
[28:38] actually leave and away from faith
[28:40] because faith is what
[28:42] burley she has hair on her chest
[28:47] all right wait for using she but if
[28:49] faith is burly it's strong it's got
[28:51] muscles it's got hair on its chest
[28:53] that's what faith is and then you have
[28:56] this little timid hope
[28:57] and so someone becomes so hopeful
[29:00] they're projecting all their energy into
[29:02] the hope and faith is over saying this
[29:04] is really what you should use
[29:06] to bring this promise to pass he said
[29:08] you put so much in your hope
[29:09] until you get away from faith so there's
[29:12] a dark side to hope this wrong kind of
[29:14] hope it's fragile
[29:16] it's actually easily unraveled and and
[29:19] this kind of hope is easily manipulated
[29:22] and so there's a wealth of of principles
[29:25] that we could dive into
[29:27] to actually begin to identify how that
[29:29] our base human
[29:30] instincts when we're relying on a hope
[29:33] that that can be used to manipulate
[29:36] behavior
[29:37] can be used to string people along and
[29:39] it can actually be used to cause people
[29:42] to acquiesce and become more complacent
[29:44] and to back away
[29:45] in brother branham's identifying this
[29:47] this is in the early 50s he calls hope
[29:50] little and timid and now there's volumes
[29:52] and volumes of studies that are
[29:54] beginning to show that there's this dark
[29:56] side of hope
[29:57] to where it can be easily manipulated
[29:59] easily unraveled and actually causes
[30:01] people
[30:01] to no longer be proactive and no longer
[30:04] act and do the things that they ought to
[30:05] do
[30:06] all because of hope
[30:11] brother branham said it's little and
[30:12] timid so it's fragile it's insecure
[30:15] but faith hebrews chapter 11 verse 1
[30:17] faith is the substance of things hoped
[30:20] for
[30:20] the evidence of things not seen so if
[30:24] you have faith in something
[30:26] somebody can ask you for the proof and
[30:28] your faith is the proof
[30:31] where where is the where is the
[30:33] substance of your joy it's in my faith
[30:36] where is the evidence that you're healed
[30:39] my faith is the evidence
[30:41] literally is something we should take
[30:42] literally faith is
[30:44] the substance it is the the grasping the
[30:47] holding it to you
[30:48] is as good as the real thing it is the
[30:50] substance of things hoped for
[30:52] so if you are hoping for a body change
[30:55] your faith that there will be a body
[30:57] change
[30:57] is the substance of your body change
[31:01] because how are you ever going to get
[31:02] there through faith so it becomes the
[31:04] substance of it
[31:05] if you're believing for healing you're
[31:07] believing for something but yet you have
[31:08] not seen it
[31:09] your faith is the evidence of it
[31:11] therefore having faith you do not doubt
[31:13] even though you don't see it with these
[31:14] eyes some say well it's never going to
[31:16] happen so i'm going to
[31:17] sorry i've already got the faith you've
[31:19] come too late
[31:20] i've already seen the evidence
[31:24] if we use the scenario the example of
[31:26] the the spies that entered into the
[31:27] promised land
[31:29] when they went over and they brought
[31:30] back the grapes and they carried this
[31:32] on their shoulders you could say they
[31:35] could say that they had the
[31:36] evidence that this was in the land and
[31:38] nobody could say and you'll notice the
[31:40] ten spies
[31:41] did not say well there's no fruit there
[31:43] and there's no nice grapes and this
[31:45] isn't there they couldn't do that
[31:46] because they'd already what
[31:47] brought back the evidence and so those
[31:50] the evidence stood
[31:52] that they could have confidence that the
[31:53] land was exactly as god said it would be
[31:57] and what did they have to do well yeah
[32:00] but there's these giants in the land and
[32:02] there's this and there's that
[32:03] and just as god said that there's
[32:05] enemies there there's enemies there
[32:07] and then they take the truth that
[32:09] there's enemies and they use it to work
[32:11] against the truth that god said i've
[32:12] given it to you
[32:15] faith is the substance of things hoped
[32:16] for the evidence of things not seen
[32:19] in the message third exodus brother
[32:20] brahma says now to you sick people
[32:22] oh how i'd like to drive this home
[32:25] when you catch that faith that you're
[32:27] going to be healed
[32:28] every circumstance everything else all
[32:31] signs all symptoms can point
[32:33] that you are dying and you'll never move
[32:37] its resting place is in the sanctuary of
[32:40] god's word
[32:42] faith when you get the faith that you're
[32:44] going to be healed no circumstance
[32:45] diagnosis symptom
[32:47] conditions certainly they can all point
[32:49] to your dying but it won't move you from
[32:50] the faith
[32:52] he says it's resting places in the
[32:54] sanctuary of god's word when
[32:55] faith genuine faith sets itself there
[32:58] not
[32:58] make believe now faith not hope
[33:02] but faith hope is out here hoping it was
[33:07] so hope is something external may if i a
[33:09] and not having the benefit of seeing
[33:11] what he's pointing to
[33:12] we know that he refers to another places
[33:14] how there's a way where you're on the
[33:16] outside looking in and then on the
[33:17] inside looking out
[33:18] there's something external it's not in
[33:20] the soul realm but maybe it's in your
[33:22] imagination
[33:23] conscience memory reason and affection
[33:25] or what you can see
[33:26] so you have this hope that may be a good
[33:27] report maybe a change in circumstance
[33:30] i'm hoping that tomorrow when i wake up
[33:32] i'll hear
[33:32] get an email from this and there's this
[33:34] hope that something out here is gonna
[33:36] happen
[33:36] and that's what hope has to do is it
[33:39] doesn't have any strength within itself
[33:41] so it's looking for confirmation it's
[33:42] looking for affirmation it's looking for
[33:44] something to make it feel good about
[33:46] itself because it's little and timid in
[33:47] me
[33:48] but faith is over there saying i'm the
[33:49] evidence of it i'm the substance of it
[33:52] doesn't need doesn't need the email in
[33:54] the morning it doesn't need the
[33:55] reference doesn't need the
[33:56] the affirmation it is the affirmation
[33:59] itself so he said faith
[34:01] he says hope is what is on the outside
[34:03] out here
[34:04] hoping it was in faith is already in
[34:08] looking out and saying it's done
[34:11] it's done it's done it's done it's done
[34:14] it's done
[34:15] that's faith faith is saying it's done
[34:17] hope is going well i don't know i mean
[34:19] maybe and my yeah
[34:21] yeah i don't know right little timid
[34:24] hope but faith is over it's done it's
[34:27] done
[34:29] it's done got bad news it's done
[34:32] got more bad news it's done got more
[34:35] good news i told you it's done
[34:36] but then we got bad news well it's done
[34:39] it's finished
[34:41] it's saying it's done that's faith
[34:42] that's what faith that is where faith
[34:45] takes its resting place for it knows
[34:46] that god will never never
[34:48] let the enemy right over the top of him
[34:51] praise the lord he never has he never
[34:53] will faith knows and so it rests in the
[34:55] word of god
[34:57] now this this is where maybe i'm working
[35:00] within this um
[35:02] uh maybe working to the second point as
[35:05] i said we should never let one word of
[35:06] god compete with another word of god
[35:08] this is maybe unfolding this a little
[35:10] bit more but kind of a second point
[35:12] this hope this wrong kind of hope
[35:14] creates tension
[35:16] with our faith by establishing certain
[35:19] parameters
[35:20] his brother and says if hope is out here
[35:22] hoping it was
[35:23] in so there's a hope well could it be
[35:26] this could it be that since it's not
[35:27] faith
[35:28] hope works to establish certain a
[35:30] framework
[35:32] or certain circumstances or conditions
[35:34] parameters for god to work within
[35:37] so hope becomes a mental bias
[35:40] i hope it's this way i hope this happens
[35:43] i hope i hope
[35:44] and so it begins to establish a way that
[35:46] you expect it to happen
[35:48] in the way that you want it to be so
[35:50] this hopeful mind
[35:52] that brother branham identifies it's
[35:55] what hinders faith
[35:58] and it's a human it's a human mind it's
[36:00] a it's an assuming mind it's one that
[36:02] kind of creates these scenarios uh
[36:04] scenario creating and
[36:06] and all these assumptions and well if
[36:08] this is gonna happen that's gonna happen
[36:09] and it's like prognosticating and
[36:11] predicting well if this is what it's
[36:12] going to be then that's going to have to
[36:13] happen if this is going to happen this
[36:14] is going to have to happen
[36:15] and we get it all figured out in our
[36:16] minds right well if god's going to do
[36:19] that then this is going to have to
[36:20] happen and then that's going to have to
[36:21] happen and this is going to have to
[36:22] happen and that's going to have to
[36:24] happen
[36:24] and we go back and we look through all
[36:26] these different things
[36:27] and even though we're saying i believe
[36:30] that this is going to happen
[36:32] hope begins to think about all the
[36:33] moving pieces that are going to have to
[36:35] somehow fit together and we start
[36:37] looking at all that
[36:39] yeah i know he said this is going to
[36:41] happen but
[36:42] look at all this other stuff
[36:45] and so our carnal expectation and this
[36:48] is how the hopeful mind
[36:50] binds us because it's a it's a human
[36:52] thinking it's a mental bias
[36:54] our carnal expectations the thoughts you
[36:57] form as a human being are bound by
[36:59] language time and distance now
[37:02] i'll just throw the caveat there out
[37:03] there the qualifier these are this is
[37:05] just my way of trying to make sense of
[37:07] it
[37:08] i don't have any authority necessarily
[37:10] we know brother branham talks about the
[37:12] dimensions we live in not
[37:13] light time and matter those are the
[37:15] three dimensions we live within
[37:16] light time and matter so there's
[37:19] distance there's substance there's
[37:20] things that we relate to but as we begin
[37:22] to talk about things and we describe
[37:24] things or we form in our hearts and our
[37:26] minds things that we want to do just as
[37:28] a natural person
[37:29] if you're going to make plans well i
[37:30] want to go on vacation or i want to go
[37:32] buy a car
[37:33] or i want to do this we can only
[37:34] understand it in terms of language
[37:36] and we can only begin to process what
[37:38] has happened what's happening and what
[37:40] will happen
[37:41] by this language time in space
[37:45] distance if i say that i'm going to walk
[37:48] to the back of the room then you would
[37:50] expect you understand
[37:51] my intention by my language and then you
[37:54] would begin to recognize that this
[37:56] intent is being fulfilled
[37:58] as i cover distance during a particular
[38:01] time
[38:01] frame and you would expect well brother
[38:03] ann's going to walk to the back of the
[38:05] room
[38:05] you'd begin to formulate this idea well
[38:07] how long do you think it would take and
[38:08] say well it might take him five seconds
[38:10] to do it it really depends on how
[38:12] how fast he walks and so you kind of
[38:13] begin to understand things in the sense
[38:15] that you can immediately begin to say
[38:18] well if he's coming walking to the back
[38:19] of the room then that's just going to be
[38:21] maybe a few seconds
[38:23] it's the same thing when people say hey
[38:25] um can you come over i need some help
[38:27] say yeah i'm on my way you immediately
[38:29] begin to think
[38:30] that they've left they live about 15
[38:33] minutes away so i can expect them in 20
[38:35] minutes
[38:36] and really what they meant is i am now
[38:39] formulating the thought
[38:41] of leaving right
[38:44] and let me just say this i'm going to do
[38:46] all of you a favor today
[38:49] let's get in the habit of just being
[38:50] honest about when we left and how far
[38:53] away we are
[38:55] because we get this pride i don't want
[38:57] them to know i left 10 minutes late so
[38:58] they text say
[38:59] are you going to be here on time you're
[39:00] like i'm just going to be five minutes
[39:02] late and you've already left
[39:04] 15 minutes late just say you know what i
[39:06] left 15 minutes late i'm looking at 20
[39:08] minutes maybe
[39:09] and all of a sudden and they'll be going
[39:12] yes we needed 20 more minutes
[39:15] right just be honest about it if you can
[39:18] get in the habit of being honest about
[39:19] things that really at the end don't
[39:20] matter
[39:22] then the payoff is going to be when you
[39:23] need to be honest about things that
[39:24] count like really count
[39:26] so always be in the habit of telling the
[39:27] truth always been the habit of being
[39:29] honest and so this is just one of those
[39:31] ways where
[39:31] i just wanted us to think in terms of
[39:33] when someone says something
[39:34] we begin to understand what's happening
[39:36] in terms of space
[39:39] activity things taking place language
[39:41] time and distance
[39:43] so we think in terms of and this is
[39:45] where i i want to make this relevant to
[39:47] what i'm
[39:47] speaking on this morning we think in
[39:49] terms of a process
[39:51] so there's a difference between
[39:53] non-linear thinking and linear thinking
[39:55] in terms of problem solving and working
[39:57] through things and i'm not wanting to
[39:58] delve into
[39:59] creative thinking versus linear thinking
[40:01] but we are all
[40:02] in some way by the our base logic and
[40:05] human experience we are linear thinking
[40:07] thinkers in that we think in a
[40:09] step-by-step progression
[40:11] or we we act in a step-by-step
[40:13] progression
[40:14] now we can we can identify times in our
[40:16] lives where we don't think through
[40:17] things like oh yeah i should have done
[40:19] that first
[40:20] duh but yet we when we're thinking about
[40:23] things we typically
[40:24] are maybe generally described as a think
[40:26] in terms of
[40:27] step by step where one thing follows
[40:29] another
[40:31] if we're going to wash our clothes we
[40:33] take them off first before we put them
[40:35] in the laundry
[40:35] the washing machine that's just how we
[40:38] think we don't think well
[40:39] how am i going to fit in here we think
[40:40] logically step by step
[40:42] this is how you do it and so this is
[40:45] what this is how our minds work and i'm
[40:47] only bringing this up
[40:48] so i can identify something about our
[40:49] human minds
[40:51] we think in terms of a process
[40:54] and we know that process takes time
[40:58] that we so we think we think in this way
[41:01] of step-by-step progression we think in
[41:02] terms of process
[41:03] and so we think chronologically that
[41:05] when things happen things
[41:07] move along in time that if i said
[41:10] at 11 15 i was going to walk to the back
[41:13] of the room you would not expect for me
[41:15] to arrive
[41:16] at 11 14. because you think no matter
[41:19] how
[41:20] fast brother aaron can walk he's going
[41:22] to be walking forward in time
[41:25] that's how you can wake up at a
[41:28] at ten o'clock in the morning or eight
[41:30] o'clock in the morning and get to church
[41:31] at seven o'clock in the morning because
[41:32] you woke up an hour late because you
[41:34] lived in an eastern time zone and your
[41:36] your phone was wrong can i get an amen
[41:39] it happened to happen to me today my
[41:41] alarm went off like man seven o'clock
[41:43] came early well somehow someway
[41:45] google's not smart enough to figure out
[41:47] that i've lived in arizona for the last
[41:48] six months
[41:49] got me in some other time zone and the
[41:53] my cell phone that i bought when i
[41:54] didn't live in arizona
[41:56] didn't uh it it sprang forward in time
[41:59] so i was waking up at what i thought was
[42:01] seven but it was actually six
[42:03] and i i just felt so early i just
[42:05] dismissed it there's not going to be a
[42:07] snooze so when we finally woke up i told
[42:08] elizabeth
[42:09] we're running late and then we looked at
[42:12] the clock we're like oh my goodness this
[42:14] can't be right
[42:15] surely we're not running this late and
[42:17] she says yes we are don't call me
[42:18] shirley
[42:20] and then we realize no something's wrong
[42:21] here somewhere the time's not right
[42:24] and so even though you can uh
[42:26] theoretically maybe on a clock
[42:29] mess with the time zone to where now
[42:31] it's it's i've moved forward in time and
[42:33] haven't lost an hour of my life
[42:35] we know logically that things move
[42:38] forward in time things progress
[42:40] you say well let's go on a road trip
[42:41] you're immediately going to try to
[42:42] understand that in terms
[42:44] of when are we leaving how far are we
[42:46] driving where are we going to stay
[42:47] because it's something that
[42:48] covers distance and as you drive it
[42:51] passes time
[42:52] we ask a distinction in question
[42:54] sometimes how how far away is it and
[42:56] someone says it's 10 minutes like no i
[42:58] want to know
[42:58] how far it is i want to know the
[43:00] distance not the time
[43:02] other time you say how far away is it it
[43:03] says well it's 12 miles no i don't want
[43:04] to know
[43:05] the distance i want to know the time
[43:06] because that's the way we think to get
[43:08] the full picture
[43:10] now with that in mind and i think maybe
[43:12] i spent a little bit too much time on
[43:14] that
[43:14] then i wanted to but now that we're
[43:17] really thinking we're we're conscious of
[43:19] this human mechanism that we think
[43:21] in terms of step-by-step progression uh
[43:23] and process
[43:24] and then we think in terms of the
[43:26] passage of time
[43:27] there's things in our lives that we had
[43:29] openly meant we just say
[43:31] well things take time
[43:34] and there's things that we say well it's
[43:35] a process
[43:38] and we understand that by virtue of
[43:39] human nature then we look to things in
[43:41] the word of god and we realize that god
[43:42] gave abraham a promise and he waited
[43:44] 25 years for it to happen so then we
[43:47] begin to realize that even when it comes
[43:48] to the word of god i don't want to be mr
[43:50] impatient
[43:51] because if he gave abraham the promise
[43:52] and he waited 25 years then i believe 25
[43:54] years then we say well remember noah
[43:57] god made a promise to noah he waited a
[43:59] hundred years and so
[44:00] we have these instances where we have a
[44:03] rebuke to mr impatient because we
[44:05] realize
[44:05] well when god makes a promise he's going
[44:07] to fulfill it and so then to try to
[44:09] understand
[44:10] why we haven't received the promise we
[44:12] could recognize that things do take time
[44:14] and it is a process
[44:18] with respect to the new birth we
[44:21] understand
[44:22] that there is stages steps or a process
[44:25] of the new birth
[44:26] and we would describe as a process of
[44:28] justification sanctification
[44:30] and the baptism of the holy ghost and
[44:33] when we think of the new birth and then
[44:34] we think it's a process
[44:36] of justification sanctification and the
[44:38] baptism of holy ghost
[44:39] it's impossible for us to not think of
[44:41] it in terms of time
[44:44] it's impossible to say well the new
[44:46] birth is comprised of three elements
[44:47] justification sanctification the baptism
[44:49] of the holy
[44:50] ghost and it's impossible for us to
[44:51] begin to think about that any in
[44:53] eternal realm because when we think that
[44:55] jesus christ died for our sins
[44:57] and we try to get the full scope of that
[44:59] we go back to the beginning and we begin
[45:01] to think about this process and abraham
[45:03] and to him the promise was made
[45:05] and it comes all the way up and then
[45:06] jesus christ is born as a baby in the
[45:08] manger
[45:09] and here he is he's got a baby that's
[45:10] born to die and then
[45:12] he's baptized by john it's the washing
[45:15] and you go through all these different
[45:16] steps of the lamb
[45:18] coming to a place to be sacrificed so
[45:20] when we think about jesus christ
[45:22] dying for our sins which accomplishes
[45:23] our justification which accomplishes our
[45:25] sanctification which made way for the
[45:27] baptist the holy ghost
[45:28] then we think in terms of chronology in
[45:30] terms of a process but yet in the word
[45:32] of god
[45:33] the lamb slain before the foundation of
[45:34] the world
[45:36] i mean it's done i mean it was already
[45:38] it was already done finished and sealed
[45:41] but yet so it's impossible for us to
[45:42] think about a promise
[45:44] and not begin to try to relate to it in
[45:46] terms of time
[45:48] so we take we take the concept of time
[45:51] and distance which is natural to our
[45:53] thinking our thought process
[45:55] and then and then the process and then
[45:57] what we do we process
[45:59] the promise of god through these natural
[46:02] processes
[46:04] we take the concept of time and distance
[46:07] and then we take a promise and then we
[46:09] process
[46:10] we look at the process of the promise
[46:12] and we run it through natural process
[46:15] now we do it through our own experience
[46:16] and this is where i could just say that
[46:18] when brother man says the way with
[46:19] experience is the plumb line
[46:21] people experience certain things and
[46:24] they receive a promise
[46:25] and then they take the template of their
[46:27] experience and they try to make
[46:29] everybody
[46:30] fit within their template of their
[46:32] experience in order to benefit from the
[46:34] word they benefited from
[46:36] why because they've taken their
[46:37] experience away with experience as the
[46:40] plumb line
[46:40] if god says something's going to happen
[46:42] and somebody else went through a
[46:44] different process to get it
[46:45] our faith is in the promise that said it
[46:48] was going to happen
[46:49] not the process they went through to get
[46:51] it
[46:53] listen i don't want my faith to be made
[46:55] perfect in the same way that abrahams
[46:56] was
[46:57] where he asked me to sacrifice my son
[47:00] but i do
[47:00] know that i will go through a process
[47:03] for it to be made perfect but i don't
[47:05] want to take the template of noah the
[47:06] template of abraham the template of
[47:08] somebody else and say well i guess i've
[47:09] got to go through this in order to get
[47:11] it
[47:11] away with experience as the plumb line
[47:14] you know what's amazing about a lot of
[47:16] people that create these arbitrary
[47:18] carnalistic temp
[47:19] templates for you to fit within and this
[47:20] mold for you to fit within
[47:22] in order for you to get something
[47:25] and then you take that and say oh well
[47:27] that's interesting show me
[47:29] when you did it and they're like oh well
[47:32] um
[47:34] i'm the one speaking you listen to me
[47:36] i'm the one asking the
[47:38] questions and you immediately realize
[47:39] they don't even follow their own advice
[47:42] they haven't been washed according to
[47:43] the same parameters that they expect you
[47:45] to be watched they don't they're not
[47:46] asking you they haven't done the same
[47:47] thing they're asking you to do listen
[47:49] one thing we know about god he practices
[47:51] what he preaches
[47:54] and so we could take this concept and
[47:56] then of of time and distance and process
[47:58] the promise
[47:59] through these processes think about in
[48:01] terms of healing
[48:04] we read james chapter 5 verse 14. what
[48:06] it says call the elders
[48:08] anoint with oil and it says
[48:12] the prayer of faith will save the sick
[48:13] it says it so if you're going to take
[48:15] your faith
[48:16] in the promise to call the elders then
[48:18] you need to call an elder call the
[48:20] elders
[48:22] they need to come anoint you with oil
[48:24] lay hands on you and pray for you so
[48:25] immediately we're thinking in terms of
[48:27] me
[48:27] benefiting and i'm not saying this
[48:29] thought process isn't in any way wrong
[48:31] because we haven't figured out
[48:32] us elders or whoever the elders are
[48:34] haven't figured out time travel
[48:36] there you have to bring them by language
[48:40] ask them to come by activity they
[48:43] travel through time and space to where
[48:46] you are
[48:48] to accomplish this act of anointing with
[48:50] oil and praise so that's how we process
[48:52] the promise of healing according to
[48:53] james 5.
[48:53] even according to mark chapter 16 verse
[48:55] 18 you shall lay hands on the sick and
[48:58] they shall recover
[48:59] we think in terms of identifying the
[49:01] sick laying our hands on them praying
[49:04] there's a process
[49:05] this is what we do with the promises of
[49:06] god
[49:08] but let me say this now as we turn this
[49:11] corner
[49:13] these promises that we see in james 5
[49:16] and mark 16
[49:17] even the truth of the new birth being a
[49:19] process these promises must not be used
[49:22] to create
[49:23] an arbitrary barrier to god fulfilling
[49:26] his word
[49:28] that we read in james 5 we read in mark
[49:30] 16. we read this we hear this
[49:31] we cannot carnally take the building
[49:34] blocks of the word of god to create a
[49:37] wall
[49:37] that we say that god can't cross over in
[49:40] order to fulfill his promise
[49:43] we're just constructing a maze well if
[49:44] god's going to heal me he's going to
[49:45] have to come this way
[49:49] and we're just looking for around the
[49:50] mountain when he comes
[49:53] right because he'll be coming around the
[49:55] mountain when he comes and says
[49:56] you know what god said he's going to get
[49:58] around the mountain under the mountain
[49:59] over the mountain he just told me he's
[50:00] coming
[50:00] so i'm not going to be looking around
[50:01] the mountain when he comes i'm just
[50:03] looking for him to come
[50:04] i haven't said which way he's coming i'm
[50:06] not looking to an angle
[50:07] and if i see something coming around the
[50:09] mountain well it's the wrong side god
[50:13] he said he's come and i'm looking for
[50:14] him to come
[50:16] this is how the promise works we cannot
[50:18] use other promises in the word of god
[50:20] to create some kind of random carnal
[50:22] arbitrary
[50:23] circumstance that god has to meet in
[50:26] order for you to receive the promise
[50:28] because god's word should never be
[50:30] weaponized
[50:31] against another part of the word should
[50:34] never say
[50:35] in this corner john 3 16 and in this
[50:38] corner john 6
[50:39] 64. eight rounds of championship
[50:42] unbelief boxing and have the word duke
[50:45] it out
[50:50] turn the ufc into ultimate faith
[50:52] championship and have word fighting
[50:53] against word
[50:54] which one's going to win we're going to
[50:57] have divine healing versus
[51:00] just contentment
[51:04] god's word should never be weaponized
[51:05] against another promise of god
[51:07] should never be used to limit god's
[51:09] power well i know the word says this but
[51:11] did you know the word says this
[51:13] and do it as a way to water it down or
[51:15] average it out
[51:18] now i would say that most of us would
[51:20] never do it that way or maliciously we
[51:22] wouldn't do it with our hands on our hip
[51:23] with an attitude and snapping our
[51:24] fingers and
[51:25] moving our neck but we would we would do
[51:28] it
[51:28] innocently we wouldn't do it maliciously
[51:32] we would do it even without realizing it
[51:34] let me use an example for you
[51:38] in the example of the the baptism of the
[51:40] holy ghost
[51:42] the promise of the baptism of the holy
[51:43] ghost is a promise
[51:45] that is clearly stated in the word of
[51:47] god
[51:49] if you read your bible the promise is
[51:52] there
[51:53] if you're a believer of the message of
[51:54] the hour the promise is clearly there
[51:57] in acts chapter 2 verses 38 to 39 then
[52:00] peter said unto them repent and be
[52:01] baptized every one of you
[52:02] in the name of jesus christ for the
[52:04] remission of sins and you
[52:06] shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
[52:08] for the promise
[52:10] is unto you and your children and to all
[52:13] that are far off
[52:14] even as many as the lord our god shall
[52:17] call
[52:18] whether you're the far off you're at
[52:20] least the as many
[52:22] as the lord our god shall call now this
[52:25] is the promise of god but these are the
[52:27] comp
[52:28] this is the competition now where we
[52:31] want the promise of acts 2 38 and 39
[52:35] promise is very clear but now we begin
[52:36] to throw up the the competition
[52:39] and the opponents to this luke chapter
[52:41] 24 verse 49
[52:42] jesus said to go into jerusalem and
[52:45] tarry
[52:46] until you're endued with power from on
[52:47] high we read action chapter 1 verse 4
[52:50] where it says they were told to wait
[52:53] and so we take luke chapter 24 we take
[52:55] acts chapter 1 we take the very
[52:57] logistics and the actual physical
[52:59] circumstances of the disciples in that
[53:01] time
[53:02] and we say well they were all in one
[53:04] accord they were all
[53:06] doing the same thing they were all like
[53:08] this and and we have to
[53:09] we begin to create this scenario where
[53:12] if everyone could just be doing the same
[53:14] thing at the same time and we have this
[53:16] whole thing kind of figured out and
[53:17] lined up
[53:18] because that's how it happened on the
[53:20] day of pentecost and what are we doing
[53:21] we've taken the promise of acts 2 38
[53:24] and we start either running up
[53:26] qualifiers
[53:28] or opponents yeah he says the promise
[53:32] that you should do this
[53:33] repent be baptized and you shall receive
[53:35] the gifts of the holy ghost
[53:36] but acts chapter 1 has something to say
[53:39] about it
[53:41] it doesn't make much sense when i
[53:42] describe it that way does it
[53:44] but this is how the carnal mind begins
[53:46] to play a gi joe
[53:48] with the promises of god
[53:52] we arbitrarily then and i say
[53:54] arbitrarily because it's not rooted in
[53:56] some actual
[53:57] scriptural process thought process we
[53:59] establish a time frame for god
[54:02] this isn't like a vision where a prophet
[54:04] has a vision that something happens and
[54:06] he sees a hat on the dresser he sees
[54:08] someone sitting here
[54:09] he sees someone sitting there and he
[54:10] knows in the vision all these things
[54:12] have to line up for it to be brought to
[54:14] pass
[54:14] we're saying the word of god says do
[54:16] this and you shall and then we start
[54:18] saying oh but wait a minute
[54:19] wait a minute you got to do this and you
[54:21] got to do that all of a sudden you got a
[54:22] bunch of hoops and getting the holy
[54:23] ghost becomes the olympics
[54:27] brother says god's under obligation if
[54:30] your faith is right towards god
[54:32] to give you the holy ghost the minute
[54:34] that you obey his word
[54:39] think about that this is not just one
[54:41] statement i dug up
[54:42] in in 47 to 65 where he never says
[54:45] anything like this and i spent the last
[54:47] week trying to find the one to make my
[54:49] point
[54:51] god's under obligation if your faith is
[54:53] right towards god to give you the holy
[54:54] ghost
[54:55] the minute that you obey his word
[54:57] brother man consistently teaches that
[54:58] the seal is a confirmation of your faith
[55:00] not your works
[55:04] so then what but what the weakness is
[55:06] our flesh begins to construct parameters
[55:08] and timelines and the framework that god
[55:10] has to operate within
[55:13] and what happens we say well if i didn't
[55:14] speak with the tongues i don't have the
[55:16] holy ghost
[55:17] if i didn't speak with tongues then i
[55:18] don't have the holy ghost
[55:21] and use that to put god in a box and say
[55:24] i don't have the holy ghost because i
[55:25] didn't speak in tongues now we can all
[55:27] admit
[55:27] that that would be an unscriptural
[55:29] framework that we're trying to demand
[55:31] that god work within
[55:32] in order to confirm to us that we have
[55:34] the holy ghost
[55:35] but that's the way the human mind works
[55:39] we take statements and quotes and
[55:40] certain things to judge and to condemn
[55:43] ourselves or even others when it comes
[55:45] to these things
[55:46] brother brahm says in the message israel
[55:48] in the church part 1
[55:49] people say let's have a tearing meeting
[55:51] glory to god let's go back
[55:53] and say glory to god let's carry for the
[55:56] holy ghost he says
[55:57] there's no such thing
[56:01] terry doesn't mean pray terry means wait
[56:06] he says this and he teaches this that
[56:08] there's no such thing as
[56:09] tarrying meetings to get the holy ghost
[56:11] in other words you can't set up a stop
[56:13] watch
[56:14] and say what we're going to do is we're
[56:15] going to pray until
[56:17] such time that the holy ghost is going
[56:19] to fall and seal us and this is how
[56:21] we're going to do it this is how we're
[56:22] going to go about it but
[56:23] i said there's no such thing to that
[56:25] terry doesn't mean that you
[56:26] have to pray and pray and reach some
[56:28] kind of threshold where you have
[56:30] over in the corner you have a volume
[56:31] meter right
[56:33] let's see how loud the congregation's
[56:35] getting the needle's like
[56:37] you're almost there keep shouting keep
[56:39] shouting getting loud
[56:40] louder saints louder and louder boom
[56:42] we're
[56:47] right but that's exactly what people are
[56:48] currently doing
[56:50] they've got a crowd meter in the back
[56:53] hey guys
[56:53] hey we need we need more get that dun
[56:55] dun dun dun dun
[57:01] people start whirling around and
[57:03] cheering and going crazy it's the carnal
[57:05] metrics
[57:07] it's the framework in which we think god
[57:08] has to work
[57:10] brother brother branham says this and
[57:12] believeth thou this every man and woman
[57:14] here
[57:16] every man and woman here who has a need
[57:17] of god can receive it right now
[57:21] do you believe that how many believes
[57:23] with all your heart he says if you have
[57:26] a need
[57:27] you can receive it right now so he says
[57:29] you sinners and people seek in the holy
[57:31] ghost
[57:32] here's what the holy ghost is friends
[57:34] you that's seeking it
[57:35] you don't have to seek and beg and tarry
[57:38] it's right
[57:39] with you now you say well we need a
[57:42] tarian meeting terry means wait
[57:44] not pray and i could say this with
[57:47] absolute assurance this is a question in
[57:50] your heart
[57:53] this is a question that people wrestle
[57:55] with this is something people want
[57:57] settled they want to stop asking
[57:58] themselves so they can go
[58:00] forward in the grace of god do i have
[58:02] the holy ghost do i have the holy ghost
[58:03] have i been born again have i done this
[58:05] have i done that and they've got to have
[58:07] this settled i'm saying that god has
[58:09] heard you you say are you talking to all
[58:10] of us i'm talking to somebody
[58:12] god has heard the cry of your heart and
[58:14] he's confirming to you his promise
[58:16] and he's establishing your faith to
[58:18] believe for the right things
[58:22] because god starts to do something in
[58:23] our lives and we begin to experience the
[58:25] benefit of the holy ghost
[58:26] and god is accomplishing many many
[58:28] wonderful things and then the devil
[58:29] sometimes just wants to take us
[58:31] out of out of line like well let's go
[58:33] all the way back here and let's just
[58:35] ask are you even really in it
[58:39] and why because as he's dragging us back
[58:41] he's going did you see this this church
[58:42] you went to and that situation you're in
[58:44] and you went through this and you went
[58:45] through that in this difficulty
[58:46] and he's trying to bring us back to get
[58:48] us back in line waiting for a promise
[58:50] when we were standing right there with
[58:51] it to begin with
[58:55] it's the way the mind works god is under
[58:58] obligation to give it to you the minute
[58:59] you obey
[59:00] there's no such thing as tarrying
[59:02] meetings praying and begging and
[59:04] you don't have to seek begging terry in
[59:06] one place he says if you've been seeking
[59:08] the holy ghost for years
[59:09] he says i'm not scolding you
[59:12] but he says you're either mistaught you
[59:15] don't understand or there's something
[59:16] wrong
[59:19] so if there's a listen if someone's been
[59:21] seeking the holy ghost fears if
[59:23] someone's known the message for years if
[59:24] someone
[59:26] has been witness to if there's a
[59:27] situation in someone's life and we could
[59:29] say and they could admit i don't have
[59:31] the holy ghost
[59:32] brother branham doesn't say well then
[59:33] you just must not be elect
[59:36] he goes no no no no if you knew there
[59:38] was a promise and you haven't got it for
[59:40] years
[59:41] you either been taught wrong or you've
[59:43] misunderstood correct teaching
[59:46] or something's wrong in your heart
[59:47] something's wrong somewhere
[59:49] and he's not suggesting you may not be
[59:51] seen we could say that clearly
[59:53] the elect cannot be quickened but we're
[59:56] not dealing in the realms of
[59:58] of the the non-elect we're talking about
[1:00:00] the elect
[1:00:01] we're talking about you this morning
[1:00:02] that god speaks to and deals with we're
[1:00:04] talking about the promise of god who's
[1:00:06] under
[1:00:06] as many as the lord our god shall call
[1:00:08] if something's not happening
[1:00:10] and there's something that hasn't taken
[1:00:12] place then we don't take one part of the
[1:00:14] word to speak against another part of
[1:00:15] the promise of god
[1:00:17] we just take the word of god to begin to
[1:00:19] examine our hearts to put our faith in a
[1:00:20] place to receive
[1:00:21] it exact chapter 10 verse 44
[1:00:25] while peter yet spake these words this
[1:00:27] is acts chapter 10
[1:00:30] okay not acts chapter 1 chapter 2 verse
[1:00:33] 38 and 39 it's while peter yet spake
[1:00:35] these words the holy ghost fell on all
[1:00:38] them which
[1:00:39] heard the word while he's preaching the
[1:00:43] word
[1:00:44] they received the word and the holy
[1:00:46] ghost fell on them that believed
[1:00:49] the word and if you say well you know
[1:00:51] they had been baptized already in the
[1:00:52] name of lord jesus christ
[1:00:53] no if you keep reading he says which one
[1:00:56] of you will forbid them from being
[1:00:57] baptized in christian baptism
[1:00:59] sin they've already received the holy
[1:01:01] ghost
[1:01:02] we get this structure in our mind this
[1:01:05] has to happen
[1:01:06] this has to happen for that that
[1:01:08] happened and we have this measuring
[1:01:10] stick we measure
[1:01:10] everybody by experience well so when
[1:01:13] were you justified
[1:01:15] how many years were you sanctified
[1:01:17] that's not a really long time
[1:01:20] don't you think you should have been
[1:01:21] sanctified a lot longer than i mean
[1:01:23] three years
[1:01:26] some people are giggling other people
[1:01:28] are going you know what that's exactly
[1:01:30] how people are
[1:01:35] in other words as peter yet preached the
[1:01:37] word the holy ghost fell on them which
[1:01:39] heard the word
[1:01:40] there was no more terry until
[1:01:45] there was no magical timeline
[1:01:48] if your objection is but what about the
[1:01:50] process what about the process no
[1:01:52] what about the promise it's god's
[1:01:55] promise
[1:01:56] therefore it's god's process don't take
[1:01:59] god's promise
[1:02:00] and try to work it down and shoehorn it
[1:02:02] into some sort of physical
[1:02:04] carnal personal process like i remember
[1:02:07] it's got to happen this way god made the
[1:02:09] promise lord i yield to your process
[1:02:12] you made the promise you fulfill your
[1:02:14] promise
[1:02:15] brother brown says three elements and
[1:02:17] that's the elements we go through when
[1:02:18] we are born again
[1:02:19] justification sanctification baptism of
[1:02:22] the holy ghost let's all say it together
[1:02:24] now that can all be in one
[1:02:27] act hallelujah
[1:02:31] when are we thinking about a change
[1:02:33] something happening something taking
[1:02:35] place in someone's heart
[1:02:36] my heart another person's heart
[1:02:38] whoever's heart it may be
[1:02:39] let's not begin to get out our calendars
[1:02:41] and say honey did you
[1:02:42] buy a day minder for 2025 because as i
[1:02:45] looked at this process i think this is
[1:02:47] about the time we're going to see
[1:02:48] god fulfill his promise the process of
[1:02:51] justification
[1:02:52] sanctification baptism all he goes can
[1:02:54] all
[1:02:55] be in one moment
[1:03:00] that's brother branham's statement
[1:03:04] that's what we see happening in the
[1:03:05] scripture
[1:03:10] so in acts chapter 2 verses 1 to 4 when
[1:03:12] the day of pentecost was fully come
[1:03:15] they were all in one accord in one place
[1:03:16] why because god said this was the
[1:03:18] promise
[1:03:19] you've got to go to jerusalem and you've
[1:03:21] got to wait
[1:03:22] until god had established
[1:03:26] a time frame god said it had to be
[1:03:30] on the day of pentecost which was a
[1:03:31] jewish feast holiday
[1:03:34] now we think the day of pentecost is the
[1:03:36] day that they finally all crossed hands
[1:03:37] just right
[1:03:38] they were sitting in a circle is it
[1:03:40] kumbaya maybe it's kumbaya no let's
[1:03:42] we tried that for a few days let's try
[1:03:43] michael row your boat ashore give us the
[1:03:46] key of g
[1:03:47] michael rowe and and we're all just
[1:03:49] holding hands
[1:03:50] and we've got this perfect instagramable
[1:03:53] indie worship scene going and then the
[1:03:56] holy ghost falls
[1:03:57] against our bead board and farm uh
[1:04:00] barriers
[1:04:01] that we've put up all around us and our
[1:04:02] chicken baling wire and all of a sudden
[1:04:04] the lord starts moving in a really
[1:04:06] dynamic way
[1:04:07] because it was just this perfect scene
[1:04:09] that we had created no god said
[1:04:11] it's got to be on the day of pentecost
[1:04:14] that's when the promises kind of come
[1:04:16] you got to wait until that day
[1:04:18] once that day came there never was
[1:04:21] another day on the calendar that a
[1:04:23] believer had to wait for to get it
[1:04:27] today is the day of salvation
[1:04:30] not a another day of pentecost not
[1:04:32] another date on the calendar
[1:04:35] once that happened the calendar was
[1:04:37] destroyed
[1:04:38] every age brother bram said it is the
[1:04:40] age of the holy ghost to the true
[1:04:41] believer
[1:04:42] there wasn't one age where they were
[1:04:43] just justified there wasn't just another
[1:04:45] age where they were just sanctified
[1:04:46] every age every day every minute every
[1:04:49] moment
[1:04:50] is the day of salvation for the elect
[1:04:54] so when the day of pentecost was fully
[1:04:55] come not their works
[1:04:57] they were all in one accord in one place
[1:04:59] according to the promise their faith in
[1:05:01] brahman
[1:05:02] and suddenly there came a sound from
[1:05:04] heaven as a rushing mighty wind
[1:05:06] and it filled all the house where they
[1:05:07] were sitting and they appeared unto them
[1:05:09] cloven tongues like as a fire
[1:05:11] and it sat upon each of them and they
[1:05:12] were all filled with the holy ghost and
[1:05:14] began to speak with other tongues
[1:05:16] as the spirit gave them utterance the
[1:05:19] wait
[1:05:20] was over
[1:05:23] the day of pentecost should come the
[1:05:25] wait was over that's why it says while
[1:05:27] peter yet spake these words
[1:05:29] suddenly the holy ghost fell upon them
[1:05:31] that believed why
[1:05:32] once the day of pentecost was fully come
[1:05:35] suddenly they could now walk into the
[1:05:36] promise of the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:05:40] there's no more word set time period
[1:05:44] for the believer to get the holy ghost
[1:05:47] suddenly there came it's immediately
[1:05:50] quickly and unexpectedly it came
[1:05:54] suddenly it happened it wasn't
[1:05:57] it was this at one point we could say
[1:06:00] according to the promise jesus said
[1:06:02] if he could have articulated the whole
[1:06:04] promise to them you need to go to
[1:06:05] jerusalem and you got to wait until the
[1:06:06] day of pentecost fully comes
[1:06:09] and then it's the prom then then this is
[1:06:11] going to happen
[1:06:15] then we could have said well we got 30
[1:06:16] days we got 29 there could have been a
[1:06:18] counting down
[1:06:20] but god gave them the word that they
[1:06:22] needed to receive
[1:06:24] in order to be the in the right kind of
[1:06:26] frame of mind
[1:06:28] to receive the promise when it was time
[1:06:31] so he said terry and wait and they knew
[1:06:34] that's what the word of god said so they
[1:06:36] did what the word said
[1:06:38] now that the wait is over he says
[1:06:40] believe
[1:06:42] believe and so the word wants to put us
[1:06:44] in the right frame of mind to receive
[1:06:46] the promise
[1:06:47] so he's not giving us the back story
[1:06:49] he's not trying to give us everything
[1:06:50] else to take he's not giving us
[1:06:51] everybody else's experience
[1:06:53] it's something that happens suddenly
[1:06:56] and that's why i asked the question why
[1:06:58] not now
[1:07:01] if it's now while the peter yet spake
[1:07:03] these words the holy ghost fell
[1:07:05] if the promise is in the word of god
[1:07:06] without some sort of time frame or
[1:07:08] barrier then why not now
[1:07:10] he said well what do you refer to
[1:07:11] healing salvation deliverance
[1:07:13] restoration redemption somebody could be
[1:07:16] despairing over some circumstance in
[1:07:18] their life that's existed
[1:07:19] for dozens of years and you say well if
[1:07:21] this has been this way for
[1:07:23] this long then it's going to take a long
[1:07:25] time to fix it i'm saying
[1:07:26] why not now why not right now
[1:07:32] and so before i go to want to do this
[1:07:34] kind of like a runway of just going down
[1:07:36] a bunch of scenarios in the scripture
[1:07:38] and i had to pare it down from dozens to
[1:07:40] just a few
[1:07:41] what kind of arbitrary limits have you
[1:07:43] been placing on god in your life
[1:07:47] in other words god makes a promise and
[1:07:48] you say but this but this but this but
[1:07:50] this
[1:07:51] and we often say we put god in a box how
[1:07:53] many have said that we put god in a box
[1:07:54] but really let's just be real
[1:07:56] you can't put god in a box who have we
[1:07:58] put in the box
[1:08:00] your faith yourself god's saying hey i
[1:08:03] i own the cattle of a thousand years i'm
[1:08:06] the god
[1:08:06] of creation i'm the one who the lover of
[1:08:09] your soul i've made the promise
[1:08:11] come ask of me be bold come speak to me
[1:08:14] i'm your father i'll give you good
[1:08:16] things
[1:08:16] come and ask like um when you need me
[1:08:18] i'll just be in my box here
[1:08:19] yes and we shut the door and we put
[1:08:22] ourselves in the box and god's like hey
[1:08:24] come out enjoy the promises of god what
[1:08:27] kind of
[1:08:28] limits have we placed what kind of
[1:08:30] man-made barriers are holding you back
[1:08:32] from the promise
[1:08:33] i tell you i'm inspired and anointed by
[1:08:35] the spirit of god this morning
[1:08:37] to take a bunch of man-made berries and
[1:08:39] destroy them for the last time in
[1:08:41] people's lives
[1:08:42] that they no longer let the intimidation
[1:08:45] and the threats and the walls and the
[1:08:46] barriers and the complexes
[1:08:48] and the false doctrines hold you back
[1:08:50] from receiving the promise
[1:08:52] of god that is present here right now
[1:08:57] be honest about these barriers
[1:09:09] i've almost been preaching about 45
[1:09:11] years here so this morning
[1:09:13] bear with me in luke chapter 8 verses 43
[1:09:17] to 44.
[1:09:20] and a woman having an issue of blood 12
[1:09:22] years
[1:09:23] which had spent all her living upon
[1:09:25] physicians neither could be healed of
[1:09:27] any
[1:09:28] all her money was going to doctors all
[1:09:30] her money was going to
[1:09:31] ways and treatments and therapies and
[1:09:34] remedies
[1:09:35] for 12 years trying to fix it
[1:09:40] and she came behind him and all she did
[1:09:43] was touch
[1:09:44] the border of his garment didn't have to
[1:09:46] pay for that
[1:09:48] and immediately her issue of blood
[1:09:51] staunched
[1:09:53] 12 years sick 12 000
[1:09:56] shekels spent
[1:09:59] and just the touch of an ordinary
[1:10:01] garment
[1:10:03] just a moment she reached out and
[1:10:06] touched it
[1:10:07] and immediately
[1:10:11] it wasn't he didn't stop and say well
[1:10:13] you've been sick for 12 years
[1:10:14] and you touched a half inch of my
[1:10:16] garment and because you didn't touch a
[1:10:18] foot of my garment
[1:10:19] it's it's you're going to take a half
[1:10:21] inch of 12 years it's going to take six
[1:10:23] years for you to be healed and god just
[1:10:24] did some kind of math on the spot
[1:10:27] no it was her faith saved her she
[1:10:30] touched
[1:10:31] the hymn of his garment and the bible
[1:10:32] says suddenly
[1:10:34] immediately she was healed 12 years
[1:10:37] a few chapters later in luke chapter 13
[1:10:39] verses 11 to 13 and behold there was a
[1:10:41] woman which had a spirit of infirmity
[1:10:43] 18 years and was bowed together and
[1:10:47] couldn't always lift up herself
[1:10:49] and when jesus saw her he called unto he
[1:10:52] called her to him and said on her
[1:10:54] woman thou art loose from the infirmity
[1:10:58] 18 years bound and he laid his hands on
[1:11:01] her
[1:11:02] and immediately she was made straight
[1:11:04] and glorified god
[1:11:06] how what process what process did she go
[1:11:10] through
[1:11:12] well first you need to start introducing
[1:11:13] this into your diet
[1:11:15] right and then you need to start doing
[1:11:17] this
[1:11:18] and you need to buy the royal rife light
[1:11:20] machine
[1:11:21] and you start doing ear cones and you
[1:11:24] start doing this and just
[1:11:25] prescribe a bunch of things no
[1:11:27] immediately
[1:11:31] she was made straight 18 years 12 years
[1:11:35] 18 this is getting gooder
[1:11:37] in john chapter 5 verses 5 tonight and a
[1:11:39] certain man was there
[1:11:40] which had an infirmity 30 in eight years
[1:11:43] he had been sick for
[1:11:44] 38 years laying there at the pool of
[1:11:47] bethesda so there was a process when the
[1:11:49] water stirs if i can be the first one
[1:11:50] i'll get healed
[1:11:51] that's the way everyone thought didn't
[1:11:52] matter how sick you were how long you'd
[1:11:54] been sick if you could just be the first
[1:11:56] one in you'll be the one to be healed
[1:11:58] and i find it interesting i'm in no way
[1:11:59] criticizing the use of this scripture to
[1:12:02] inspire people to jump in the pool when
[1:12:04] the water is being stirred
[1:12:05] but the literal dynamics of that is if
[1:12:07] you're not the first one in you're just
[1:12:09] getting wet
[1:12:13] do i need to read the whole story at the
[1:12:15] pool of bethesda
[1:12:16] when the angel the lord stirred the
[1:12:18] waters the first one in got healed
[1:12:20] but the story teaches us that you don't
[1:12:23] have to get wet to get healed
[1:12:26] when christ the healer is walking up to
[1:12:29] you
[1:12:30] and says i am the lord that healeth all
[1:12:32] thy diseases
[1:12:34] take thy bed rise up and walk the
[1:12:37] stirring of the water was for
[1:12:38] dispensation it was for
[1:12:40] time you could use it as a type when the
[1:12:42] angel lord stirs within the service get
[1:12:44] your promise
[1:12:44] but who are we looking to to heal as
[1:12:46] christ my healer
[1:12:50] he had been sick for 38 years it says
[1:12:52] jesus in verse 6 knew that he had been
[1:12:54] now a long time in that case
[1:12:56] he saith him will thou be made whole the
[1:12:58] impotent man
[1:12:59] answered him sir i have no man when the
[1:13:01] water is troubled to put me into the
[1:13:02] pool
[1:13:03] but while i am coming another step down
[1:13:05] before me
[1:13:07] and jesus saith in him rise up now
[1:13:09] notice he just speaks the word
[1:13:11] rise take up thy bed and walk and
[1:13:14] immediately
[1:13:15] the man was made whole 38 years of an
[1:13:19] infirmity
[1:13:20] 38 years of a sickness
[1:13:23] and immediately he's made whole
[1:13:26] took up his bed and walked and on the
[1:13:28] same day was the sabbath
[1:13:31] 12 years 18 years 38 years
[1:13:35] what are we prone to do say well i've
[1:13:37] had mine for 39 what are you going to
[1:13:39] do now brother aaron it doesn't matter
[1:13:42] to me if it's been your whole life and
[1:13:43] you're 90. the bible's not establishing
[1:13:47] timelines that well if you've only been
[1:13:50] sick 11 years with your blood issue you
[1:13:51] got to wait 12.
[1:13:54] oh you you've you've uh you've had this
[1:13:56] infirmity for
[1:13:58] 17 years this is the kind where you have
[1:13:59] to wait 18 years no the bible is saying
[1:14:02] it doesn't matter how long it can change
[1:14:05] suddenly
[1:14:07] in acts chapter 3 we get the gate called
[1:14:09] beautiful we could read of this story
[1:14:11] peter james peter and john went up
[1:14:13] together in the temple at the hour of
[1:14:14] prayer be in the ninth hour
[1:14:16] and a certain man lame from his mother's
[1:14:19] womb
[1:14:20] how's that for not 13 years or 18 years
[1:14:22] or 38 years
[1:14:23] his whole life well how long his whole
[1:14:24] life
[1:14:26] as long as he had ever had life this is
[1:14:27] a man who'd been sick and lame
[1:14:29] from birth from day one moment one whom
[1:14:32] they
[1:14:32] laid daily at the gate of the temple
[1:14:34] which is called beautiful to ask
[1:14:36] alms of them that entered into the
[1:14:37] temple so here he is he'd been sick his
[1:14:39] whole life
[1:14:40] and he's begging alms and what did peter
[1:14:42] say such as i have i give unto thee
[1:14:44] silver and gold have i none but such as
[1:14:46] i have i give thee
[1:14:47] in the name of jesus christ of nazareth
[1:14:50] rise up and walk i want you to notice
[1:14:51] this is the word and the mouths of a
[1:14:53] believer
[1:14:54] not in the mouth of jesus christ but
[1:14:56] peter speaking the word
[1:14:57] and he took him by the right hand and
[1:14:59] lifted him up and
[1:15:01] immediately his feet and ankle bones
[1:15:04] received strength
[1:15:05] why is this so extraordinary it wasn't
[1:15:07] that just what was wrong was healed
[1:15:09] but now he had a lifetime of strength to
[1:15:11] know how to walk
[1:15:14] a lifetime of coordination when somebody
[1:15:16] has a stroke they could be
[1:15:18] 50 years old in the prime of health and
[1:15:20] then have a stroke and they have to
[1:15:22] learn to write
[1:15:22] all over again through therapy day after
[1:15:25] day
[1:15:26] after day have to learn how to walk they
[1:15:27] knew how to walk they have the strength
[1:15:29] but something is lost
[1:15:32] but this person didn't need therapy he
[1:15:35] wasn't scheduled
[1:15:36] for therapy he wasn't scheduled for this
[1:15:38] or scheduled that immediately his feet
[1:15:40] feet and ankle bones received strength
[1:15:43] and he
[1:15:43] leaping up stood and walked and entered
[1:15:46] with him into the temple
[1:15:47] walking and leaping and praising god he
[1:15:49] had a lifetime of strength coordination
[1:15:52] ability suddenly
[1:15:56] a man who could never walk could walk
[1:15:57] like somebody who'd walk their whole
[1:15:58] lives who could dance
[1:16:01] who could praise that's the god you
[1:16:04] serve
[1:16:08] what is it telling us we should not
[1:16:10] establish arbitrary
[1:16:11] limits on god we should not keep putting
[1:16:14] something off in the future
[1:16:16] off in the future off in the future
[1:16:19] i don't get it right now i'll get it
[1:16:22] right now
[1:16:25] and if i don't get it this moment i'll
[1:16:27] get this moment
[1:16:30] if it doesn't happen this second it
[1:16:31] happens this second
[1:16:33] because why with each one this
[1:16:36] this is the way our mind works it works
[1:16:38] this way
[1:16:39] right each second tick tick
[1:16:42] tick tick tick
[1:16:45] and so we can believe then that if it
[1:16:48] didn't happen now
[1:16:49] now is now now is now then
[1:16:53] let then be then let now be now and
[1:16:56] isaiah chapter 53 verse 5
[1:16:58] but he was and notice the progression of
[1:17:00] the language he was wounded
[1:17:02] for our transgressions he was bruised
[1:17:05] for iniquities
[1:17:07] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[1:17:09] him
[1:17:10] and then and with his stripes we
[1:17:13] are healed
[1:17:17] even if we could place the the wounding
[1:17:18] the bruising and the chastising
[1:17:21] in past tense the healing is present
[1:17:24] tense
[1:17:27] god's word is not bound by time and
[1:17:29] distance
[1:17:31] the bible says you are healed
[1:17:35] and it says it in such a way to even if
[1:17:37] you were to look at the not just using
[1:17:39] the english language though i'll try to
[1:17:41] do it now in a moment to help you to
[1:17:42] understand
[1:17:42] that even in the way it's written in the
[1:17:44] hebrew is to create this timeless
[1:17:46] promise
[1:17:47] you are healed such that your state now
[1:17:50] of being healed is your state in past
[1:17:52] present and future
[1:17:54] and there's no tense that's being
[1:17:55] ascribed to it it just is
[1:17:59] if i can put it this way the promise is
[1:18:01] always perfectly present
[1:18:04] we know that within the english language
[1:18:06] there's three verb tenses to show action
[1:18:08] i say we know that
[1:18:09] just kind of paying you a great
[1:18:10] compliment for listening in elementary
[1:18:12] school
[1:18:13] there's three verb tenses that show that
[1:18:15] of action has been completed
[1:18:18] we don't know something has been
[1:18:19] completed he was wounded that's past
[1:18:21] perfect you could say
[1:18:22] i had seen it it's something completed
[1:18:25] in the past
[1:18:26] if it's future perfect you're using
[1:18:28] language to suggest
[1:18:29] that it will happen in the future he
[1:18:31] will be
[1:18:32] wounded that's future perfect you say i
[1:18:35] will have
[1:18:36] seen it i will have done it but present
[1:18:39] perfect
[1:18:41] to say i have seen it it means the
[1:18:43] action
[1:18:44] is completed with respect to the present
[1:18:48] and i would like to use it in the sense
[1:18:50] to say that the promise of god we
[1:18:52] are healed i would like to use it just
[1:18:55] for our english language to say that it
[1:18:56] is
[1:18:57] present perfect but i want to take a
[1:18:59] step further and say the promise is just
[1:19:01] presently perfect
[1:19:05] it's perfect right now there's nothing
[1:19:08] wrong with the promise there's no reason
[1:19:09] to create
[1:19:10] a box and go live in it we can just be
[1:19:12] in the presence of the promise
[1:19:15] in exodus chapter 3 verse 14 and god
[1:19:17] said unto moses
[1:19:18] i am that i am
[1:19:22] i am that i am he's just saying this
[1:19:25] i am there's no i was i will be
[1:19:28] it's just i want you to know that i am
[1:19:31] so that you don't try to look back you
[1:19:32] don't try to look forward you just have
[1:19:34] to recognize me
[1:19:35] in the present because if you don't see
[1:19:37] me in the present
[1:19:38] you're not going to find the true me in
[1:19:40] the past and you'll never receive the
[1:19:42] true me in the future if you don't have
[1:19:44] me in the now
[1:19:47] he says i am and because he can say i am
[1:19:50] because he
[1:19:50] is i can say thus i am because he is you
[1:19:54] are
[1:19:56] because as he is in this world so are
[1:19:58] you this
[1:19:59] is the promise what he is now presently
[1:20:01] is what i believe in
[1:20:04] he is the present god we're not trying
[1:20:07] to figure out where he's dwelling in our
[1:20:08] past or future
[1:20:09] he is a god that can only be present
[1:20:14] and the promise is just as much god as
[1:20:17] god is it knows the promise is just as
[1:20:20] much
[1:20:20] present it's just presently perfect just
[1:20:23] as god is present
[1:20:25] and god is perfect
[1:20:28] the promise what it says by his stripes
[1:20:30] we are healed
[1:20:33] it's not to create this looking back
[1:20:37] or looking forward but it's to create
[1:20:39] truth
[1:20:41] that what i do is i believe that
[1:20:44] that's what i believe i believe the
[1:20:47] truth
[1:20:48] and the truth isn't subject to the
[1:20:50] chronology the truth isn't subject
[1:20:52] subject to carnality
[1:20:53] this is a timeless promise that i
[1:20:55] believe by his stripes
[1:20:57] we are healed
[1:21:00] it's not bound by time in galatians
[1:21:03] chapter 3 verse 17 and this i say
[1:21:06] that the covenant that was confirmed
[1:21:07] before of god in christ the law
[1:21:11] which was 430 years after this is the
[1:21:13] covenant
[1:21:15] that was confirmed before god of christ
[1:21:19] and the law which was 430 years after
[1:21:23] the covenant so he's actually produced a
[1:21:24] very interesting time frame you have the
[1:21:26] covenant
[1:21:27] confirmed in christ but then he says 430
[1:21:32] years after the promise came the law
[1:21:36] he says if the promise given to abraham
[1:21:38] that was confirmed in christ
[1:21:41] was intervened by a law that came 430
[1:21:44] years after
[1:21:45] the law cannot disannul the covenant or
[1:21:48] the promise
[1:21:49] that it should be made that it should
[1:21:50] make the promise of none effect
[1:21:53] the messiah came they say 1911 years
[1:21:56] after the promise then the law comes
[1:21:59] 430 years after the promise in other
[1:22:02] words
[1:22:02] god made the promise nothing that
[1:22:04] intervenes
[1:22:05] in the meantime can any way disannound
[1:22:09] the promise
[1:22:10] even if it's something that happens 430
[1:22:13] years later
[1:22:13] and it's still not yet for another 1500
[1:22:16] years that the promise is fulfilled
[1:22:17] there's no amount of time there's no
[1:22:19] amount of distance there's no amount of
[1:22:20] circumstance
[1:22:21] there's not enough hurt there's not
[1:22:22] enough pain there's enough circumstances
[1:22:24] symptoms there's not enough surgeries
[1:22:26] there's not enough charts there's not
[1:22:27] enough doctors
[1:22:28] there's not enough wikipedia there's
[1:22:30] nothing that can disa no
[1:22:32] the promise of god nothing that can do
[1:22:35] it well it's been years it's been years
[1:22:37] it's been years
[1:22:39] does it distant all the promise no
[1:22:42] it doesn't disand all the promise bill
[1:22:45] graham said god covers all space and
[1:22:47] fills all time
[1:22:48] he's omnipotent he's omnipresent he's
[1:22:51] infinite
[1:22:52] he's here now
[1:22:58] just as he says you don't have to beg
[1:23:00] and tarry and seek
[1:23:02] it's right with you now
[1:23:07] oh if i could just get if i could just
[1:23:10] well if you don't have faith you'll get
[1:23:11] there and you'll think it's another one
[1:23:14] it's not faith you'll get there and it's
[1:23:15] got to be somebody else
[1:23:18] your rest is in coming to a place where
[1:23:19] it's the word of god
[1:23:21] not the building not the man not the zip
[1:23:25] code not the time zone
[1:23:27] it's just something where you know it's
[1:23:29] the word
[1:23:30] it's the word 430 years cannot
[1:23:33] disappoint no
[1:23:34] and make the promise of no effect why
[1:23:36] because god covers all time and space
[1:23:39] i wanting to wrap this up so you could
[1:23:42] see this from a perspective
[1:23:44] that is god
[1:23:48] how this is a god that cannot just be
[1:23:51] broken down
[1:23:52] into a chronology one of the remarkable
[1:23:55] things that
[1:23:56] of many that brother bischo's ministry i
[1:23:58] believe is uh can teach us
[1:24:00] is how that when he met with brother
[1:24:02] branham and brother branham told him he
[1:24:03] said you had
[1:24:04] brother biscuit having not shared this
[1:24:06] with brother brown he had three
[1:24:07] questions
[1:24:08] and brother branham told him he says you
[1:24:10] have three questions brother biscuit
[1:24:11] never told him he said you have three
[1:24:13] questions
[1:24:14] and he's in one of them was about how
[1:24:16] people could be anointed
[1:24:17] with the holy ghost but still live a
[1:24:19] false life
[1:24:20] and brother brown asked him the question
[1:24:22] he says have you gotten my tape
[1:24:23] on the anointed ones have you heard my
[1:24:25] sermon on the anointed ones
[1:24:27] and brother branham hadn't preached it
[1:24:28] for three years
[1:24:31] what does that teach us that god doesn't
[1:24:34] have a calendar like we do
[1:24:36] and he doesn't have a thing of time that
[1:24:38] runs forward like we do
[1:24:39] in other words if it was going to be
[1:24:41] preached in 65 it had already been
[1:24:43] preached
[1:24:44] in the mind of god because there's
[1:24:45] nothing unknown to him waiting for the
[1:24:47] veil to drop and be like ah
[1:24:50] schrodinger's cat is there right
[1:24:53] he's not waiting for something to be
[1:24:54] opened up to figure out what's there he
[1:24:56] already knows he's omnipresent he feels
[1:24:58] all time and space
[1:24:59] he's omnipotent he's infinite he's here
[1:25:00] now
[1:25:02] and i want you to think about this in
[1:25:03] terms of how the
[1:25:05] the immediacy bringing to a place to
[1:25:07] believe without any barriers
[1:25:09] the bible says and peter writes that a
[1:25:10] thousand years is one day to god
[1:25:13] and one day a thousand years if you took
[1:25:16] time to
[1:25:17] to to work this out and i went through
[1:25:19] all these different sticky notes and
[1:25:20] doing different things and i googled it
[1:25:21] to confirm my work and
[1:25:23] one thousand years is equal to a day if
[1:25:25] you do the math it means
[1:25:26] one hour is 41 years and eight months
[1:25:31] because we think well it's going to take
[1:25:33] time
[1:25:35] then if from god's perspective what's
[1:25:37] lasted for 41 years
[1:25:40] in an hour it's taken care of
[1:25:44] one minute is nine months
[1:25:47] one second is four days
[1:25:51] time doesn't limit god
[1:25:54] to think that one hour's 41 years and
[1:25:57] eight months
[1:25:58] and then every six minutes you can add
[1:26:00] another four and a half years
[1:26:03] why not now
[1:26:07] why not now you spent so many years in
[1:26:11] this situation so many years to this
[1:26:13] the marriage is broken and it's been
[1:26:14] years and years all these different
[1:26:16] things these scenarios
[1:26:17] we just have a way of framing it to
[1:26:18] we're telling god in our minds we think
[1:26:20] well if this is going to happen it's
[1:26:22] going to have to take this long but i
[1:26:24] say
[1:26:24] why not now
[1:26:29] we believe in a rapture don't we the
[1:26:32] bible says it'll happen in a moment
[1:26:35] the change of our bodies will happen in
[1:26:37] a moment
[1:26:38] in the twinkling of an eye we shall be
[1:26:42] changed
[1:26:42] suddenly in a moment i
[1:26:46] say we should believe for that moment
[1:26:49] i say that we should believe that we're
[1:26:50] living in the time when it can
[1:26:52] happen at any moment and not say well
[1:26:55] this has to happen and that
[1:26:57] has to happen and this has to happen say
[1:26:58] god you said it would happen in a moment
[1:27:01] then if there are circumstances and
[1:27:02] scenarios that are gonna have to happen
[1:27:04] let's see if the word says this has to
[1:27:05] happen that has to happen
[1:27:06] then god has a way to make it all happen
[1:27:09] in a moment
[1:27:11] he can take 41 years worth of things
[1:27:14] and make him happen in one hour he can
[1:27:16] take four days worth of stuff and have
[1:27:18] it happen in one second
[1:27:19] time is not a barrier to god it can
[1:27:22] happen
[1:27:23] suddenly so i say don't let your hope
[1:27:27] hinder your faith
[1:27:29] don't cause the word that in some other
[1:27:31] area a quote a statement
[1:27:33] a truth don't let it weaken your faith
[1:27:35] in the word if you're believing
[1:27:36] that by his stripes we are healed then
[1:27:39] don't let any other testimony
[1:27:41] any other narrative any other bible
[1:27:43] story any other statement any other
[1:27:45] quote
[1:27:46] any other experience hinder you from
[1:27:48] believing he said it
[1:27:49] i believe it and i'm not going to
[1:27:51] qualify it
[1:27:53] when now well it didn't happen oh it's
[1:27:55] going to happen now well it didn't
[1:27:56] happen it's going to happen now
[1:27:58] you have an attitude like that guess
[1:27:59] what it's when it's going to happen
[1:28:01] now they they
[1:28:05] bullied and intimidated that blind man
[1:28:07] who was claiming his healing
[1:28:09] i'm healed i'm healed now they're making
[1:28:11] fun of them go on a day after day i'm
[1:28:12] healed i was blind i was healed i was
[1:28:14] prayed for that meeting i was healed and
[1:28:15] that barber says
[1:28:16] oh really then how many fingers am i
[1:28:19] holding up and he goes
[1:28:20] four tore out of that
[1:28:23] that barber chair ripped off his the the
[1:28:26] gown he's like hey i can see i
[1:28:28] can see why because it never changed
[1:28:30] when he was healed
[1:28:31] he was healed right now and as long as
[1:28:34] he believed it was now
[1:28:36] he was in a position to be healed but if
[1:28:39] you always believe it's tomorrow can we
[1:28:41] have a special
[1:28:41] tomorrow what is it it's always
[1:28:45] together now a day away right
[1:28:49] always if you're going to be healed
[1:28:51] tomorrow you'll never
[1:28:52] see tomorrow but if you're healed today
[1:28:56] you're in a position to receive it the
[1:28:58] same thing of any promise
[1:29:00] restoration of broken relationships
[1:29:02] redemption of something that's lost your
[1:29:03] joy your peace your physical healing
[1:29:05] salvation today is the day of salvation
[1:29:08] why
[1:29:09] not now why cannot we believe
[1:29:12] why can't we believe that the promise of
[1:29:14] god can be fulfilled
[1:29:16] suddenly
[1:29:19] in one moment everything can change
[1:29:24] and that's where the as i was pondering
[1:29:25] the christ the healer
[1:29:27] i began to think about certain
[1:29:28] circumstances and realize in a moment
[1:29:31] in one moment things can change from
[1:29:35] night
[1:29:36] to day just a blink of an eye
[1:29:40] it's changed and it didn't require
[1:29:44] sitting down working on a budget
[1:29:47] thinking through the layers of
[1:29:48] complexity
[1:29:49] what am i missing no it's a total moment
[1:29:52] where god takes control and time doesn't
[1:29:55] mean anything anymore
[1:29:57] and suddenly
[1:30:02] musicians you could come to your places
[1:30:04] if you'd like
[1:30:06] i have a scripture i want to read to
[1:30:08] close
[1:30:16] john chapter 6 verses 16 to 21.
[1:30:21] and when even was now come his disciples
[1:30:23] went down to the sea and
[1:30:26] entered into a ship now this isn't a
[1:30:29] cruise ship this is doesn't have a
[1:30:31] 250 johnson on it nice casting deck
[1:30:35] this is a row boat essentially
[1:30:39] and went over the sea toward capernaum
[1:30:41] they've gotten
[1:30:42] they've gotten into this boat and
[1:30:43] they're going to cross it to capernaum
[1:30:45] based upon where they entered and where
[1:30:47] they were going it was six miles across
[1:30:49] for them to get to the other side and
[1:30:52] now it was dark
[1:30:54] and jesus was not come to them so now
[1:30:57] they've
[1:30:57] got into this sea they're in this boat
[1:31:01] the testament on the sea is unfolding
[1:31:05] and i could say suddenly the sea arose
[1:31:07] by reason of a great wind that blew
[1:31:10] unexpected
[1:31:13] these men being familiar with the sea we
[1:31:16] could
[1:31:17] assume that they would not have gotten
[1:31:19] in the boat
[1:31:20] had they foreseen bad weather coming
[1:31:24] but things are favorable to sailing the
[1:31:26] the the weather is good the signs are
[1:31:29] favorable let's get into the boat and
[1:31:30] let's row to the other side and go to
[1:31:32] capernaum
[1:31:33] and so when they had rode about five and
[1:31:36] twenty
[1:31:36] or thirty furlongs about three to four
[1:31:40] miles
[1:31:41] so they had just about two more miles to
[1:31:43] go to the shore
[1:31:44] six miles from the point of departure
[1:31:47] point of destination
[1:31:49] three to four miles in a great wind
[1:31:51] blows and the storm arises
[1:31:54] they've got two more miles to go things
[1:31:57] don't look good
[1:31:59] all that rowing to get to the other side
[1:32:01] and now we're just two miles left
[1:32:04] two thirds of the way there we're almost
[1:32:06] there we can make it
[1:32:08] we got the last third to go a great
[1:32:10] storm blows up
[1:32:13] and right in the middle of the storm
[1:32:15] they're fearful that they're going to
[1:32:16] lose their lives
[1:32:18] jesus comes walking on the water
[1:32:21] walking on the sea and drawing night
[1:32:24] into the ship
[1:32:26] now what ought had that represented
[1:32:29] deliverance what did it initially cause
[1:32:34] fear their help was coming in a way that
[1:32:37] they didn't expect it
[1:32:40] if you're drowning in a boat at sea what
[1:32:43] you don't want to see
[1:32:44] is some guy in a robe you know
[1:32:48] dog paddling towards you or an
[1:32:50] apparition or a ghost you'd love to see
[1:32:51] a coast guard
[1:32:54] you want to see a helicopter right
[1:32:57] they've come to save me they come to
[1:32:58] rescue but now this the appearance of
[1:33:00] this one
[1:33:01] struck fear them but it was jesus
[1:33:03] walking on the water
[1:33:04] so he said them it is i be not afraid
[1:33:09] can we not all admit today no matter
[1:33:12] where we are in the tempest no matter
[1:33:14] where we are in our boats no matter
[1:33:15] where we are in the range you see
[1:33:16] no matter where we are in our journey
[1:33:18] from the point of departure to the shore
[1:33:20] that we're trying to reach
[1:33:21] can we not just all admit that jesus
[1:33:24] is the one that can deliver us from all
[1:33:26] our fears and he's the one that time
[1:33:28] after time after time appears when we
[1:33:31] need him
[1:33:32] with the resolution to our problem and
[1:33:36] that he's perfectly present
[1:33:37] and he has a promise for what we need
[1:33:39] and though initially we might be a
[1:33:40] little bit scared and we might not be
[1:33:42] fearful
[1:33:42] but as soon as he speaks to us we know
[1:33:44] it is i the lord be not afraid
[1:33:46] then that's the moment that we can
[1:33:48] believe that though the storm
[1:33:50] rages i'm just safe
[1:33:53] though i've gone these four miles and
[1:33:55] i've got two more to go
[1:33:57] i know i'll make it to the other side
[1:33:59] because jesus is with me
[1:34:03] it is i be not afraid
[1:34:07] we often look at this story and we think
[1:34:09] in terms of the miracle
[1:34:13] being that christ walked on the water
[1:34:17] we think in terms of the miracle being
[1:34:19] when the story is given of jesus walking
[1:34:21] on the waves and peter walking
[1:34:22] and those are tremendous miracles but
[1:34:24] there's a hidden miracle in this story
[1:34:27] and it's the miracle of his presence and
[1:34:30] in order for jesus to come walking on
[1:34:32] the water
[1:34:32] it's likely that he may have began at
[1:34:34] the same shore
[1:34:36] that they began and he knew right at the
[1:34:39] moment that he started
[1:34:43] by the time that he got within eyesight
[1:34:45] would be right about that moment that
[1:34:46] that great wind would come up
[1:34:49] saw the wind coming and so he took his
[1:34:51] steps
[1:34:52] and god knew because he's omnipotent
[1:34:55] that about the time
[1:34:56] the wind hits i'll arrive
[1:35:00] and they'll look and see me god just
[1:35:02] planning things
[1:35:04] god just planning things i had a brother
[1:35:07] the very moment the very time that god
[1:35:10] had
[1:35:11] god was conceiving in vindicating that
[1:35:13] he was calling
[1:35:14] there to be a church another phoenix
[1:35:16] raised up here another church be born
[1:35:19] i had a brother meet with me and begin
[1:35:21] to tell me a testimony
[1:35:23] about how that 20 years prior a
[1:35:26] situation had happened
[1:35:28] where bank had messed up in a wire
[1:35:29] transfer and money had ended up in his
[1:35:31] account or had not left his account
[1:35:34] and actually they actually worked with
[1:35:36] the bank and hired a lawyer and did all
[1:35:38] sorts of different things
[1:35:39] in order to try to figure out how to get
[1:35:42] rid of this money they didn't need it
[1:35:43] and the resolution of all the actions
[1:35:45] and the work of the lawyers was you know
[1:35:46] what
[1:35:47] it's there we don't want it we make no
[1:35:49] claims we release it and we give you the
[1:35:51] money
[1:35:52] it's yours to keep and over 20 years 20
[1:35:55] years ago they said you know what
[1:35:56] this is from the lord we're gonna put it
[1:35:58] into a bank
[1:36:00] in one day a bank account one day god's
[1:36:02] gonna want us to use it
[1:36:04] and the brother comes to me says brother
[1:36:06] aaron we would want to give this to help
[1:36:08] the church find a building
[1:36:11] and i thought my to think that one day
[1:36:14] there's going to be a young girl 21
[1:36:16] years old that's going to come to the
[1:36:18] lord
[1:36:19] and we'll be able to say the very money
[1:36:21] that god used to provide for this
[1:36:23] building
[1:36:24] that the altar where your soul was
[1:36:25] sealed god gave it before you were even
[1:36:28] born
[1:36:30] before you were even born god allowed a
[1:36:32] wire mix-up and a working out of a
[1:36:34] resolution
[1:36:34] and preserve the funds that's the god we
[1:36:37] serve
[1:36:39] not a god that we're not we're worried
[1:36:41] about this and we're worried about that
[1:36:42] and god says i'm a god that's here with
[1:36:44] you right now
[1:36:45] you say you've been seeking the holy
[1:36:47] ghost for years if you could just
[1:36:48] believe it's right here with you
[1:36:52] right here with you i have to fight for
[1:36:55] it and claw for it and beg for it and
[1:36:56] trip my tongue up for it
[1:36:58] i can believe for it
[1:37:01] because the miracle of him being here
[1:37:03] right now was not that and he walked
[1:37:04] upon the water
