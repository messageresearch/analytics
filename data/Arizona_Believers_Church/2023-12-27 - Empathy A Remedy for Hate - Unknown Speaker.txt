TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Luke chapter 10 verse 25 and behold a certain lawyer uhhuh of course a certain lawyer stood up and tempted him saying Master what shall I do to inherit eternal life there's a lot of context to this that would be helpful but we just feel to zero in on one particular aspect in Jesus it says he said unto him what is written in the law how readest thou and he answering said Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy strength and with all thy mind and thy neighbor as thyself and he said unto him thou Hast answered right this do and thou shalt live but he willing to justify himself said unto Jesus and who is my neighbor and Jesus answering said it's remarkable that he's not just answering it directly and but he's he is is answering it in a very profound way a certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among Thieves which stripped him of his reignment and wounded him and departed leaving him half dead and by chance there came down a certain priest that way and when he saw him he passed by on the other side and likewise a levite when he was at the place came and looked on him and passed by on the other side but a certain Samaritan as he journeyed came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him and went to him and bound up his wounds pouring in oil and wine and set him on his own be and brought him to an end and took care of him on the tomorrow when he departed he took out two pence and gave them to the host and said unto him take care of him whatsoever thou spendest more when I come again I will repay thee now Jesus asked the lawyer again which now of these three thinkest thou was neighbored unto him that fell among the thieves and he said he that showed Mercy on him then said Jesus unto him go and do thou likewise amen you can be seated my my title tonight is empathy a remedy for hate and as we uh covered hate through a few services and a series on hatred uh we just we want didn't want to leave that subject just yet as a matter of fact uh some of the things that brother Timothy ashong was me mentioning on Sunday kind of just nudged me further into this I had been um just working on some thoughts on kind of my working title was thoughts on overcoming hatred and was looking at the themes of compassion and EMP empathy and how those things all relate and then brother Timothy uh mentioned some things and even used some quotes and uh talked about some things I'd like to just take right from there are a few things that he quoted from and just use them again tonight and explore this subject of empathy and call it a remedy for hate and so it's kind of thoughts on overcoming hate and hopefully this will not we're not going to dwell so much on the hatred but even how that we can recognize the precursors of hate and how that there's certain seeds uh that if they take root it becomes a root of bitterness certain things that can start out as an emotion a very strong reaction to something and if we don't uh address that wrath or that anger or the offense if we don't give it some context and let the Holy Spirit deal with it and have the right attitude towards it that's what can breed hatred hatred and lead us to some more intense emotions and we want to uh remember as we're using this a remedy for hate that hate is a poison and so there's some antidote there's something that we need to counteract hatred that when it begins to try to draw near to us and work in our minds and in our hearts and so hopefully this subject of empathy and kind of the things we explore around it will help us to understand how that we can address and deal with these feelings these strong feelings that either are projected towards us that we're trying to be provoked into or if we're experiencing them ourselves the best way to overcome it and if I could put it this way and I want to point out this is one of my favorite paintings this is by Vincent van Gogh and it is uh him copying uh de la croy's Good Samaritan painting he kind of does it in his own style it's a very beautiful painting but that's what's depicted here as hiso is uh you know the this re uh image of this Good Samaritan lifting this man who fell victim to thieves upon his own burden and you could see even his his possessions are emptied out of the suitcase you even see maybe the Levi just passing around the corner in the foreground so it's real beautiful painting and uh and just wanted to present this image to the Good Samaritan so we come to in a moment but if I could use this hate can be overcome by perspective and you think wow that's you that's quite a statement but if I could say when we see things differently than before it could change the way we feel about someone or something our initial glance at something might cause some sort of horror we might be repulsed by it but once you understand better the context or you understand more to the situation uh you realize oh okay that that makes sense I mean if I told you that I know of a message Minister who's married dozens of women you might think well that's horrible but I'm just referring to him officiating wedding ceremonies you oh well just you put it that way it makes more sense and so there's things sometimes that just give some color to things we hear that changes the way we feel about something and referring to I can't remember now just exactly I think it was on the last time we ministered on a Sunday we were looking at how that people often hate because they fear something the thing that we fear the thing that we don't know the thing that we understand we can hate it just because it's different from us it's called the fear of the unknown and because there's fear it leads to hatred uh something that you don't understand it can lead you to hate uh things that you're not willing to accept it can lead you to hate it and sometimes we do that just to un justify our lack of understanding or to keep us in that laziness of not trying to understand and we saw in the scripture where Paul is telling us that we should work to cultivate an understanding of others so that we could guard against that kind of hate that kind of disdain and judgment that comes from ignorance even we're looking at that statement that fear is bred by the fear of the unknown or fear of anything that's different than you our fear of things that are outside of what you consider to be normal and and this is I think it's really good for us to challenge ourselves because let's just admit it we're different and as message Believers I would say this even if you're just raised in the message and and you just do everything that the messages taught you and even haven't been born again we could just be different by discipline different by theology but the Bride of Jesus Christ is distinctly different than everyone else and if we're not careful our differences in being different can cause us to look upon others in negative lights and look upon people in bad ways and look down on people and in doing so that's going to condemn our hearts and in a way of justifying the way that we feel it'll lead us to hate the things that are different than than us and be so far from the spirit nature of this message that it will begin to corrode and corrupt our our good works and our testimony so I want to use the parable of the Good Samaritan to start with tonight and there's so much here that we could use and I I could get kind of lost in this story we ministered on it extensively uh back in 2020 and 2021 and I know all of you remember it just perfectly so I don't need to cover it in any kind of detail but there's a lot that Happening Here leading up to this question by this lawyer about how he could inherit eternal life and really Jesus could have said nothing I said what can I do to inherit eternal life Jesus could have said nothing but it's as if Jesus loves to I want to say toy but he loves to challenge those who want some sort of affirmation that they're good enough that they can accomplish it uh and that they're smart enough or this is something they could do on their own in some ways that's exactly what he did with the Rich Young Ruler we told him oh go sell all that have give to the poor and then come follow me he asked of him something uh that he knew challenged him where he was and so this lawyer saying you know what can I do to get eternal life Jesus saying nothing there's nothing you could do for eternal life he says well what does the law say and he quotes from the law saying that to love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and all thy soul and all thy strength and all thy mind and love thy neighbor as thyself so this is a good summation Jesus and Paul each one in the New Testament saying this is what everything hangs on and this is how it all can be summed up in this love thy neighbor as thyself so Jesus says you've done well do it and you'll live and the lawyer's response is quite telling because he says willing to justify himself he says and who is my neighbor and if I could just change the question a little bit H and this isn't self-serving in a way it is but it's not necessarily self-serving we're just exploring actually what he's saying cu the question is love thy neighbor as thyself in other words you owe a duty to love your neighbor so when he says who is my neighbor he's actually saying to whom do I owe no duty to love or rather who am I allowed to hate wow I'm just going to preach over here that's good uh that's to me it is a wow when you begin to think if he's kind of carving out well who's my neighbor he's say not so much who can I who am I allowed to love but who do I owe no duty to love who am I allowed to hate CU he's wanting to justify not his love or his selective love he's wanting to justify his hatred and when he says who am I allowed to hate Jesus is going to answer with a parable but let me show how this this uh lawyer would have been very much aware that the issue is hatred because in Luke chapter 19 verses 17 and 18 says Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart Thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbor and not suffer sin upon Him Thou shalt not avenge nor bear any Grudge and we dealt with some of these things earlier against the children of thy people so they're thinking very particularly converts or to Jews those of the blood but Thou shalt Love Thy Neighbor now this is this escalation this broadening of the scope of whom the duty is too but Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself I am the Lord so when it's dealing with not hating thy brother and and being able to rebuke Thy Neighbor but not avenging and not grudging it would have been given that you look out after the house of Israel you're looking after the Seed of Abraham but it talked about how you owe a duty to the stranger you owe a duty to The Foreigner you owe the duty to the one that even though they hate you if they're under their Beast of Burden that you should help them and there's a lot in the law that required service and Aid to those who were not your seed who were foreigners strangers in your land so it says Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself this lawyer knew that love and hate were at issue and when he says well who's my neighbor willing to justify himself he was wanting to justify his hatred so Jesus in answering this immediately goes to the parable of the Good Samaritan and yet it's not evident at first who he's talking about but he says a certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho and he doesn't tell us whether or not he's a Jew he doesn't tell us if he's a Samaritan he just says it was a certain man we could gather that perhaps he was an Israelite coming from Jerusalem him down to Jericho and he falls among Thieves who beat him up who rob him leave him half dead he's just stripped naked and the next person to come upon Him is a priest and the priest sees and recogn he sees this scene he knows what's happening but he passes by on the other side and continues on and there's some that wrestle with the text saying oh well he could he had to keep himself pure and he wouldn't had to touch him and then the next comes a levite he's not a priest he's a levite and yet he kind of he recognizes the same thing and he passes on by and as I I was studying this and I find myself just drawn to it more and more again lately and and just been hearing I think it's just maybe an odd phenomena but just a number of people commenting how they've gone back and started listening to this series on who is my neighbor I think it would be wonderful if we did that any new families or any believers who began coming to this church go back and visit that because it really is good in giving the context for this body that we exist within a a city within a community of the Christians and other churches and we didn't to know who our neighbors are and how to look upon others and treat other people and so I've been looking at this with new eyes and studying it again and I I've come across some things that to me it was kind of like we have these jokes you know he said there's always three people in a joke and and you have this one this one and this one and so it's like a a priest walked into walked into a restaurant and then then a a automobile salesman walked in and then the lawyer and there's always like these threes a preacher doctor and a lawyer and to the Jews they had the same nature with some of their storytelling that there was always a story of the priest the levite and then just the regular average person so this lawyer may have been in that mode this is this modality it's it's going to happen the priest the levite and just your average Joe but then Jesus changes it up completely and instead of maybe going where he expected what would be expected of the average Israelite and so they had this rhythm of Threes And storytelling long before goldilock and so there was some expectation of this third character and brother Travis you might be know that this rule of Threes that even exists within storytelling he use these different characters and then the third one is supposed to bring something out and and show something so Jesus is following this method but then instead of just going to the regular Israelite he introduces the Samaritan and this would have been a completely a complete departure from what these Israelites were expecting and he says but a certain Samaritan and Jesus is very deliberate in his using the Samaritan Luke 10:33 because we know that hatred existed between the Jews and the Samaritans and there was certain natural uh National and religious prejudices uh that created this hostility between the Jews and the Samaritans instead of getting into the history of it the Jews considered them half breeds considered them dogs and it was those who were in Exile who begin to marry amongst the Assyrians uh there was this blending of Assyrian Syrian and Jews and so their children some kind of mixture of the there was some tradition there and some ties to the uh the children of Abraham and they begin to adopt uh certain beliefs same beliefs they believed the first five books of the Bible the pentito were the only true word and believed in the law of Moses and kind of looked down on the Jews because they had to add all these prophets and Poets and all these other things but they believed the law as Moses gave it they had their own Temple they thought was greater than that which was in Jerusalem so there was this kind of competitivness that existed between them and in the Bible you'll find and even a history that the Samaritans were kind of antagonist to the Jewish identity so you had the Jews who were the children of God but then these a Samaritans who claimed to be probably they claimed to be the children of God the original the pure they held to the law the right way and they did everything in their power to annoy the Jews partly because of their similarities but mostly because of their differences and you can see in the scripture that when Jesus talks to the Samaritan woman that her first commment is you Jews don't have any dealings with us I believe it's in the Bible when Jesus has not received uh uh welcomed by the Samaritans in a particular Town what was it the disciples said should we pray that Hellfire be rained down upon these Samaritans so this was kind of their attitude towards them there was this Mutual disdain this Mutual hatred so Jesus uses the Samaritan to teach us not to hate and he's using it to show that we ought to overcome evil with good cuz the again we're looking at the lawyer from the standpoint of saying justifying who he's allowed to hate so he uses the Samaritan one that he would have hated and one that he would have been able to carve out an exception to loving so it says but a certain Samaritan we're still in verse 33 here as he journeyed came where he was and this is this one this certain man who came down from Jerusalem to Jericho and was beaten by thieves and when he saw him says he had compassion on him the Bible tells us he came where he was and if I could say this he saw him as he was and because he saw him as he was then he could come to him amen as as we read and maybe we there's some speculation it's as if the priest sees and knows well enough from where he's at to keep moving on and not to uh not to tell a story on my dad because he's not here to defend himself but I remember one time we were fishing on a lake and as a family we were on the boat and as we were going he noticed somebody way out in the distance it looked like he was siging him he said don't look we're just going to ignore him because by law we must stop and render Aid if they're in distress and so not a I guess he's a pastor not a priest but father mcgi wanted just to keep moving on and and this is maybe this is what the priest was doing is the priest is kind of seeing this and he goes oh man I'm just going to ignore this because if I'm able to perceive that this is one in need then I'm going to have some sort of moral you know obligation to render Aid so I'd rather not know I'd rather not ask and then maybe the levite it's supposes that he kind of looked enough to where he knows because it says he was looking and he came and looked on him and it's going yeah I don't want to deal with this nope right and he gets out of there but now this Samaritan he sees him and he says he came to where he was and saw him and when he sees him it causes him to have compassion so he was willing to take it in he did avert his gaze he he he looked at him and it says he had compassion it means he felt love and pity for him and In This Moment he acts and it says and he went to him verse 34 and bound up his wounds pouring in oil and wine set him on his own beast and brought him to an end and took care of him so quickly Jesus recites a number of activities and actions that are in no wise easy right that are so rich in in love and compassion and service he binds up his wounds he pours in oil and wine think of just what the attention that's being given and the way that he's carrying and then he lifts him as the picture depicts but Jun maybe you could just show that real quick that title slide it's depicted and and the way that Cy did it and even here as van go replicates it it's as if he's still unconscious and he's been bound in look at the labor and the strain that he would have to do to set him up on his own on his own beast of burden and he would set him up on there put him on this horse or whatever it might be and now he's going to walk beside this and bring him to an end and it says and he took care of him it wasn't until the next day now as he spent this whole night with him that he gives charge to the inkeeper and makees sure he has everything he needs but this was an act of compassion this Samaritan who to a Jew would be a half breed a dog it was actually a by word this was a if you wanted to offend another Jew you just call him a Samaritan and yet here's one that's acting better than the levite acting supposedly in the point that's being made better than the priest and as he has placed upon this Beast after having been bound in oil and wine poured in them as we take this image in I want to say this because this is what struck me as this Samaritan came to where he was saw him as he was and then could come to him and help him we often lack compassion because we don't have perspective and we're are we're unwilling to gain it such as the priest and the levite we want to hold on to our our opinions we want to hold on to our judgments and our prejudices we want to hold on to our hate we want to hold on to our criticism we want to hold on to our judgment we say well that's not right this is is wrong and then instead of really taking it in and trying to understand and see it for what it is we avert our gaze very quickly wanting to hold on to our kneejerk reaction amen that's right but he came to where he was this was a humble act might have taken it might have been some a precarious move it might have been again just speculating and painting the picture that the thieves cast his body into a difficult place to reach and tried to cover it up and maybe they hurried him off to some other spot in order to get to him and beat him up and rough him up and do it without the views of others he might have he knew he was putting himself at risk cuz this is one who had just been taken by thieves so it was an act of vulnerability and it it was a humble act and what I think is beautiful is to this Samaritan showing kindness in serving this less unfortunate one was no threat to his identity it was no threat to his worth it was no threat to his testimony he didn't have to worry about what could be said about him there was no self-righteousness there was no fear of stooping down in doing something to help somebody up or be kind to somebody listen I want to speak to it very directly we sometimes confuse righteousness and AAL for God for just some sort of prejudice bias and hate that we have in our hearts towards certain things and we act on it thinking we're doing God a service when in actuality we're just spewing out hate which is of the devil amen thinking that we can't have a kind word we can't help somebody we can't we can't can't even show kindness and just decency to another person in some situation because we need to be Pious and we need to be holy and we're just falling ourselves all right so maybe it is still heavy I don't know challenging at least right brother David but he was able to recognize the reality of this man's condition enough to where he had compassion it wasn't oh yeah there's somebody who needs to put some clothes on right what would we do today if that ain't lay to see you naked you know and laying there naked and just start judging right away about how ridiculous this I can't even go to J Jericho without a naked man laying on the side of the road but he was able to recognize the reality of this man's condition and what really happened that he needed to be ministered to he needed to be his wounds needed to be bound up he needed oil and wine and and that forethought to no this is what he needs uh to rid of infection this is what he needs to begin to promote healing this this is what he needs to protect it going forward and then just not leaving him there say well I've done my duty but to take it the next step and I I feel maybe just compelled to acknowledge this that Jesus often asked very hard things of people who were putting on hirs as if they had it all figured out and so this Parable it doesn't impose upon us a duty to stop and help everyone with a flat tire and give our money away to everybody who's asking for it you have to be real mature when you look at these parables in what Jesus was asking because Jesus acknowledged that there's always going to be poor Among Us when he went to the pool of Bethesda he passed by many other sick people and only healed the one when he sent his disciples out he didn't send them out by themselves he sent them out two by two and made sure they had the things they need so Jesus had a much better a much richer perspective of this than just saying oh we just need to go out and stop everybody and help everybody but he is challenging Prejudice and things in people's hearts with this and I could say this we'll never be able to see correctly until we take the risk of humbling ourselves the same way as we said before get beneath live above and get beneath I want to live above these things live above this all this pretense that's out there and get beneath somebody else if I could help them but all these paradigms of pride and arrogance and uh Prejudice distort our view of those we hate of those that we hold bitterness against and jealousy or animosity those things it's all part of the fabric that we're looking to when we see them and this statement that brother Timothy read on Sunday it is so it was so direct and so you'll see how I'm trying to weave together some of those things that we just heard but it says brother brandham says in the Great Commission May I drop this in this little thing to you Brethren as I know you're different denomination so he's acknowledging kind of this division of beliefs I've never talked like this to a group of people but in this locality here and throughout the nation is becoming now if the devil can keep us separated he's got us shooting at one another so he's got an open Target anywhere he wants to shoot and what's the use of shooting we're shooting one another I I call them tennis matches usually but where one serves the other one return serves and now it's just two people voling back and forth uh trying to beat one another in a game of quote versus quote sermon versus sermon spy versus spy and here brother Brandon puts in terms that you're just shooting it shooting at one another this brother believes this let's just shoot at him over the pulpit this person believes that let's just shoot at him and brother bradam says as long as we're shooting at one another he said the devil doesn't even need to take a shot that's right the devil can just sit back and relax what does that tell you the devil's the one that usually does the shooting but when we start shooting we're doing the devil's bidding amen and we're just mercenaries doing the devil's sniping work and he doesn't have to fire any bullets and then we blame the devil the devil's like not me I didn't pull the trigger you did and God's over there saying that's true you're the one pulling the trigger and we're over there saying you're going to pull this gun from my dead fingers right come and take it because we we believe the right to bear arms and use them he says if I found Grace in your sight though through God you take my word for this Brethren if you want to be a blessing and get a blessing you remember that did you catch that on Sunday that phrasing if you want to be a blessing and get a blessing so you want to bless others and be blessed yourself when a man has done you wrong and he is absolutely justly Noti he's saying look I'm not just saying you think he did you did you wrong he did you wrong I mean he has done you wrong and you know what he's done you wrong he has done you evil don't mention that I believe the way that it strikes me in reading it that maybe it's one of those things where don't just go around telling everybody he says you take him to prayer before God and don't take it in the way of just to selfish and say well I'm supposed to do this the words you go before the Lord and say wow this guy's evil he's horrible he did this to me and he just you're just kind of going about it in a selfish way he says but stand with your shoulder to his shoulder and stand in the presence of God our Father way a prayer should be made in the presence of God and say father here's my brother he deserves punishment because he's done evil and I don't see why he did it now do you recognize just exactly what brother brandham has asked you to do and even what's being implied that in some spiritual way in some dynamic as a child of God you have the ability to Bow your head in your heart and stand before God and bring the offender with you into the presence of God and he says you're standing there shoulder toosh shoulder with your offender and you're there as a victim and you're calling out what has been done to hurt you and you're acknowledging that it's been evil and as you bring it he said it's he's saying now leave it at that kind of what I mentioned recently about how I'm handling things at home that if something has been done is a hurt or offense that somebody's done something wrong if my children ask me to do something by way of addressing it and a a penalty my answer is no Dad Elliott wrecked your car will you ground him nope sorry you just handcuffed me now that he's wrecked the Tesla I got for myself on Christmas instead of him I can't even ground because you asked me to ground him but this is something that I I think about as he standing here say this is an offense this is a wrong but we don't we don't call for Hellfire we don't come up with the punishment he says then let God go to talking to you doesn't this teach us something how that we ought to be sometimes we come and we're looking for advice we're looking for help we're looking for justice we're looking for God to do something for us and we say he did this she did this she did that she did this and then God just starts addressing us and we're like but they're the one that did it he says well they're not I'm talking to you you're the one that brought it up this is the place to start let me deal with your hearts first let me address you first then let God go to talk to you and you'll see maybe what the man's been through why because now you've brought him before you he's there with you in the presence of God and as you stand there in the presence of God you said this man's done me evil now God starts talking to you about what this man did and why he did he says maybe you'll start to see him in a different way you'll see what this man's been through the devil's Twisted him up somewhere and caused him to do that though he's absolutely wrong before you leave the Throne of God you'll be feeling sorry for that man you'll be sympathizing with that brother so there's your sympathy hold on to that and when you get back down to Earth again woo that beautiful you have have the ability to come up before God in a Heavenly place and bring this person with you shoulder to- shoulder in the presence of God and there things are disclosed things are opened up God begins to deal with your and then when you come back down you're going to be different now when you come back to earth you'll go over to that brother and shake his hand because you know what he's been through you cannot stand with the mortal and the presence of God and condemn anybody that's the statement to write down you cannot stand in the presence of God as a mortal and condemn anybody anybody there's nobody as a mortal that you can condemn in the presence of God I don't believe no sir even if he's a ranked sinner we start thinking well what about this one what about that one what nobody and what about a brother that's made a mistake though I say he's wrong and I love how brother bam continues to acknowledge it's wrong even before God he says and though he's absolutely wrong why is that sometimes we're afraid to go through this exercise it's because we're afraid that somehow we're going to have to accept that it wasn't wrong maybe worse we're afraid that we'll find out that we're the ones that's wrong he says even when he's he's a ranked Sinner and what about a brother that's made a mistake though I say he's wrong sometimes he's accused wrong when he's not wrong but if he is wrong if we take him to the throne of God stand there shoulder toosh shoulder with our brother I'm telling you this is powerful that we can do this knowing he's Immortal and maybe his destination rest upon your attitude towards him here you see when Christ is standing there crucified upon a cross how we drew from that this this to be like Christ and taking on this figure of Christ and having the mind of Christ we look at here he is on the cross his father forgive them for they know not what they do his eternal destination rest upon your attitude towards him think about how Jesus tells the Rich Young Ruler sell all that halves and give to the poor and come follow me and you'll have eternal life he tells the good he tells this uh lawyer here he says go thou and do likewise as the Good Samaritan this is a heavy ass these are big things to do and then there he as he's dying on the cross and the thief says oh forgive me and he said what did he say this day you'll be with me in Paradise no big ask of him why because Jesus this is his attitude this is what he's looking for this is how that he's instinctive to recognize this one and his eternal destination rest upon his attitude towards him says when we come back from the Throne of God we'll realize that we are everyone guilty and we all need help one from the other not we need help one from another and the best way to do is pray am and there's just so much here yeah so much to begin to think about and how little hurts and offenses and just things that accumulate things that happen in life but he says that you'll begin to feel sorry for him you'll be sympathizing with that brother so he's using a language I think that we all relate to but to have sympathy is the ability to understand and acknowledge the feelings of another person so when you sympathize with someone here he says that you uh you begin to recognize this and you go to sympathizing for him he he's he's using it in the sense that you recognize what he's been through you see that Something's Happened you start to feel this pity for him and you sympathize so it's feelings that you have for someone else feelings of pity feelings of sorrow and I know there's a way that we use that when we say well this person did this to me and this person did that to me go well I just feel sorry for him and I would say that in some ways if we're being hypocritical or we're not really being feeling about it that a true sympathy that's being expressed here is how that you say this man has done evil to me and now by bringing him in the presence of God God is able to open up something to you to now when you look at him your fist aren't clenched teeth clenched wishing that he'd be destroyed forever there's something in you that just that that that anger and heat dissipates and you're just like man I just feel sorry for him he's pitiful man he's in rough shape and man the devil's really got to him to make him do this and the way that he acts and the way that he responds and the all his tropes and everything he does whatever it might be like man what a pitiful creature and I think that we ought to challenge ourselves about whether or not we are allowing God to give us perspective of on others to where we are able to understand the feelings of another person are willing to acknowledge the feelings of another person are we allowing us our our elves this capacity when something happens to say well I mean I see it for what it is and I know what's happened and I know this is wrong but there's context to this and I think even in fellowshipping with some people and even brother Lucas I think uh you've even mentioned this before and it's something that's really really good to remind ourselves I think it's instinctive sometimes for us when our children do something go what is wrong with you and we're really not being psychoanalytical in that point saying there's clearly something wrong with you we need to diagnose the problem but we're more more or less commenting on the situation and that can cause great damage when someone does something and they're kind of being told something's wrong with me but there's a better question to ask sometimes when you see repetitive behavior is what happened to you there's some things that we do as men there's some things maybe we could say this as sisters but there's some things that we do and it's just because we learned it in our family environment and we don't even know that's not the right way to be so the question ought to be what who taught you that how did you learn learn that what happened you to cause you to be that way can we uh accept where someone is coming from can we acknowledge it you know a lot of times it's all people want is they they're wanting to be heard and something happens and it's born from frustration because no one's ever willing just to acknowledge you don't have to agree but at least acknowledge we get so obstinate and stubborn where we don't even want to take time to acknowledge something I've been trying to teach my children and um I I you know I wish I could my wife for this but there's a certain nature in our children that they just hold really strongly to certain ideals and they see all the facts and they're going to argue those facts and those facts alone and I think sometimes it's good to say yeah I think I'm right and all the facts support me as to why Tom Brady's better than Brock pie but you know sometimes you have to soften yourself up a little bit and begin to consider why somebody else might think something like that no matter how crazy that might be but just find yourself acknowledging well I don't agree but I can see where you're coming from otherwise you know what you're saying you're crazy you're out of your mind there's no rational basis to feel that way there's no reason to feel like that and that just makes the chasm worse and worse and worse can we have the capacity to begin to sympathize not agree but acknowledge and understand where someone may be coming from because that's what brother brandham is challenging us on that's what he's saying being in the presence of God will do Peter says it this way in 1 Peter 3: 8 to9 woo we're running out of time time finally be you all of One mind having compassion one of another that means being sympathetic feeling for each other love as Brethren be pitiful be courteous right those are just real strong words that he's challenging us that we ought to be pitiful be courteous love his Brethren having compassion sympathizing and this kind of fits right into it not rendering evil for evil or railing for railing if railed against don't rail back why because you have compassion You're Pitiful you're Court is if Evil's been given don't render evil back he says but contrary wise blessing this is notice how it fits perfectly with brother said if you want to be a blessing and get a blessing start sympathizing so he shows us how to start dealing with this hurt or offense or this evil that's been done to us we bring we go up before God we bring the offender with us shoulder Tosh shoulder we begin to talk about God about it then we let him start talking to us and he says this is how you can be a blessing and be blessed and Peter says instead of rendering evil for evil for raing render a blessing in other words you can be a blessing and you'll be blessed knowing that you are there un to called that you should inherit a blessing this is exactly what brother braham's teaching us Paul dealt with it this way in Colossians 3: 12 and 13 put on therefore as the elect of God holy and beloved bows of mercies it means sympathizing this inward pity inward compassion the the Jews felt like there was there was this connection in the bowels and these even physical organs where it was a source of this love and this Mercy this pity this compassion bows of mercies kindness humbleness of Mind meekness longsuffering forbearing one another forgiving one another If any man have a quarrel against any even as Christ forgave you so also do ye with no qualification if there's a quarrel with somebody else he says just forgive them the first thing we ought to do Lord help us to do it I know this is easy for me to say and much harder to do an application but when something has been done wrong you've been hurt by your spouse they've done something wrong they've betrayed your trust there's great hurts and harms whatever it might be forgive them when you're even when you're mad at them when you're hurt when you're disappointed when you're fearful when you're doubtful do it for your own sake just forgive them and even forgive them knowing that even perhaps their Eternal destination depends upon your attitude towards them any quarrel forgive brother bam kind of carries the same thought if you notice in doors inside door inside the door it's just a few days before he makes this comment in the great Great Commission he says you know what a blessing is do something for somebody else it's a m drop moment right just stop it right there you want to know a blessing is and you know what we all thought oh yeah like when you give me something that's a blessing but he says do something for somebody else that's right and if you have a neighbor or somebody that's done you Injustice remember this for me don't never turn him down or don't ever turn him down don't try to get off on the double negative don't ever turn him down take him to God in prayer and see what a different attitude you'll have if you're sincere in prayer you stand shoulder-to-shoulder with him though he's done you wrong Injustice again he's dealing with kind of that mental bias we have where it's like well if I forgive I'm saying he didn't do anything wrong if I forgive him then I'm saying it was okay if I forgive him then I'm inviting the cont uh conduct again no though he's done you wrong Injustice but you just take that man to God and stand there in the presence of the father one time and say father my neighbor here has done me wrong but I guess he says watch when you go to tell and his wrong it not only helps him but it'll help you also to God and you'll see what he's been through in the Temptations and things it'll change your attitude towards that brother and it'll help him also you always are doing good when you're praying one for the other you want to do good pray for Somebody Pray for each other recognize here how in both of these instances both of them together to where I would say this is kind of brother brand in this time period is dealing with the same thing from the same Vantage Point you'll see what he's been through and it changes your attitude there's something about being able to understand where a person's coming from they they might say something really nasty to you and do something very nasty to you and it's absolutely wrong it's an injustice but when you understand where they're coming from you like oh well okay now I see why you did that right like whenever in some of these situations where it's just simply a misunderstanding yeah they should have never flown off the handle they should have never done that but they perceive something or something happened and interrupted things or maybe you just forgot a word and a text you sent out and it blew everything up and you're like oh well I had no idea right well why are they running me down why did they blast me why did they do this and it's like well you find out later that your best friend whom you told that you didn't like them and thought all these things about them told them and they're like oh well you know never mind I didn't know they knew how I really felt about them right and then you kind of get to feel a little sheepish because you realize now it's your own animus and it's your own bitterness and it's your own jealousy that provoke them to act that way keep preaching like this this pastor's never going to have me back again Galatians chapter 6: 1 and 2 because I want you to recognize this this might seem to be a little bit of a a a quick turn here but there's a you see his Temptations you see what he's been through you recognize how brother BR saying that you call out his Heir and his wrong but now God's able to give you a better view of this person and you see what made him do it or made her do it The Temptations the devil twisting them up now there's something here I think I want us to catch it's not this attitude of that poor fool just always letting the devil get them I never do that right it's not this matter of you pity them because man they're just always falling into a traper snare but you can do more than just sympathize like you can relate because in Galatians chapter 6: 1 and2 bre if a man be overtaken in a fault ye which are spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of meekness I I say this with absolute certainty the reason why some people are incapable of addressing someone who's an heir with the spirit of meekness it's because they're not spiritual to begin with because only those which are spiritual can restore one with a spirit of meekness too often people do it harshly because they're afraid of their own weaknesses and they and they lack meekness but notice how he says considering thyself lest thou also be tempted bear ye one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of Christ so this the law of Christ is love thy neighbor as thyself everything can be summed up we see what Christ taught as his law but we're to Bear one another's burdens now let me be very clear as brother brandham uses this kind of language this is not justifying what somebody else has done this is not excusing what somebody else has done nor is it approving of what somebody else has done I think sometimes we abandon our Aid and our ministry to other people because we're afraid in being Christ to them it's going to approve of what they've done it's going to give it's going to be accepting of what they've done it's going to be justifying and excusing what they've done when in reality we can fulfill the law of Christ by supporting and helping someone without approving what they've done only a real Christian could do that and what we do is we just deprive we just deprive somebody of love because we don't want to approve of what they're doing and that's the same as hate to withhold intimacy to withhold uh love to withhold something that's due somebody to to bring this Gap and and I can show you through scripture and through human nature that that's exactly what hate is to deprive somebody of what they're do that's hatred and we do it because we're afraid somehow some way it's going to justify our excuse or approve I know maybe it deserves a lot more time than I'm giving this but I hope it's challenging some of our Notions sometimes of what we think is right and that person's rescue we're depriving that person of their rescue from sin because we have the wrong kind of attitude towards them and this is how Paul addresses it considering thine own self lest thou also be tempted I believe that when he says this it's an admonition Beyond just accepting that you can fail and I know that that kind of obvious on its face is here someone who has been taken overtaken in a fault and Paul saying if you're spiritual restore this one in the spirit of meekness considering also that you could be tempted so you're considering your own selves but I I believe that there's more to it that he's not just asking you to acknowledge Your Capacity to sin but it's an admonition to accept that you it's also an admonition to empathy not that you could sin but that you've been there before too that you know what it's like and so here's kind of an actual difference between sympathy and empathy whereas sympathy is this the ability to understand the feelings of another person or acknowledge how another person feels empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of another person to you can actually relate to what they're going through not just go man I know that's got to be really tough to have that happen to you never happened to me but I can see how that would be rough to empathize and say I know exactly how it feels to be in your situation it's actually seeing things from someone's point of view if I could put it this way it's it's walking in someone else's shoes say I've gone down that road before I know what it's like and and just to give a an example there's a lot of things to where you can empathize with someone else is going through even though you can't share their actual experience but it's that it's being able to see something from someone's Vantage Point there's a poem written by uh a Mary LA from Jackson Michigan good old Michigan it was called judge softly you'll recognize some sayings in this that are very common in our in our language pray don't find fault with the man that limps or stumbles along the road unless you have worn the moccasins he wears or stumbled beneath the same load there may be tears in his Souls that hurt though hidden away from view the burdens he bears placed on your back may cause you to stumble and fall too don't sneer at the man who's down today unless you have felt the same blow that caused his fall or felt the shame that only the Fallen know you may be strong but still the blows that were his unknown to you in the same way may cause you to stagger and fall too don't be too harsh with the man that sins or Pelt him with words or stone or disdain unless you are sure you have no sins of your own and it's only wisdom and love that your heart contains for you know if if the tempter's voice should whisper as soft to you as it did to him when he went astray it might cause you to falter too just walk a mile in his moccasins before you abuse criticize and accuse if just for one hour you could find a way to see through his eyes instead of your own muse I believe you'd be surprised to see that you've been blind and narrow-minded even unkind there are people on reservations and in ghettos who have so little hope and too much worry on their minds brother there be but brother there but for the grace of God go you and I just for a moment slip into his mind and traditions and see the world through his spirit and eyes before you cast a stone or falely judge his conditions remember to walk a mile in his moccasins and remember the lessons of humanity taught to you by your elders we will be known Forever by the tracks we leave in others people's lives are kindness and generosity take the time to walk a mile in his moccasins may not be politically correct or woke these days but to deprive to to get rid of this is to lose what it really means to understand and relate to really see what beautiful poetry showing us of what it means to consider thyself you you too to see something from someone else's point of view to have empathy it's this mode of intentionality that makes it possible to access what somebody else is going through cuz it's their subjective experience but you're able to access it with the awareness even that experience isn't your own but you're able to you're able to get in there you're able to see it for what it is the Bible says in Romans 12:15 Rejoice with them that do rejoice and weep with them that weep that's empathy it's not it's not hearing that somebody's gotten this and they're happy and you see that they're happy oh well I know what it's like to be happy so congratulations it's to Rejoice also and how can you truly Rejoice unless you can empath aiz my best way of expressing this is uh kind of with in my life I got married when I was 30 most of my friends were much older than me even to now where my friends all have grandchildren are probably going to be great-grandchildren before I'm a grandpa but there's there was always this congratulations when a friend would have a baby congratulations man I was smiles and I was happy but then as soon as Elliott was born I was like man those were the worthless most empty congratulations ever offered because I didn't even know what I was saying but then once I had my own child and it's not just you Elliott the rest of them too added to that feeling but there was this sense of wow whereas now when someone has a baby I'm like oh my goodness this is so awesome you can't lose having kids and it's such a gift it's such a blessing and I I'm not just saying oh I'm happy for you but I'm rejoicing with those that rejoice and I can say this in the same way some of you who've lost people very close to you very dear as brother Timothy said he lost his wife very young in the in the Lord and serving the lord he's somebody who cannot just say I'm sorry if you've lost a loved one but he can empathize there's a level level of Sorrow that I can't achieve because maybe I haven't lost someone very close but I've had I've had loved ones people I was close to and even converts take their life in different things and you can begin to relate to how that would feel so on some level you're not just Sorrowing you empathize you rejoice when they Rejoice You Weep when they weep your congratulations or your condolences come from a place of I'm not having your experience but I'm able to tap into it I'm not just sympathetic I'm empathetic this statement stands out to me the sermon broken sisters he's preaching it on July 23rd 1965 the headline in the New York Times that day was that Lyon B Johnson was admitted to the hospital with a raspy cough they admitted him because he had great pain in his chest and they said they were going to keep him for five days it was kind of like for a cough and then brother Bram says our heavenly father he's praying he says our heavenly father we're standing in a desperate need for the leader of our nation our president and I I know what what you Republicans are thinking right and you know how you're just like you know is it be like asking you to pray for Biden right hey and Hey listen I'm just gonna be honest I know how some of you feel very un Christlike when it comes to somebody of another political affiliation that's good right you're a visitor you can just you can really get behind it we'll we'll even remove that the technology is there just remove your voice they won't be able to find out who you are undercover agent you know just in there getting behind things listen there's it's true we're so quick to justify real genuine nastiness towards somebody and here's brother Brandon play praying for Lyndon B Johnson right and this is the moment where he saying well not everything he said was th sayth the Lord right prophets make mistakes too but this is real our heavenly father we're standing in desperate need for the leader of our nation our president he may never know this Lord but you know it I pray for brother Johnson as he professes to be a believer in you all right that's it I'm leaving the message and you think it's funny but people will do it over politics because it doesn't scratch their hate I pray for brother Johnson as he professes to be a believer in you and father a heart attack we understand has struck him that thought found that to be very interesting I pray God spare his life we're in a national crisis right now let thy Spirit come upon them Lord and right now in the hospital wherever he may be let your spirit come down to that Walter Reed hospital and touch his body sparing his life Lord now this is where I saw the empathy that man's Under Pressure more pressure than what we understand so we pray God as Believers and as a part of this nation we pray for our leader that you will grant him an extension of life in this great hour oh and I thought here he's not a pro president pres but he's a prophet he's not leading a nation but he's leading a bride and he's a lead he can understand the pressure of people looking to him he could empathize what this man was going through he says I profess I pray for him as a brother since he professes to be a believer in you it'll help us even change our attitude towards Trump we pray for our leader as Believers as part of this great nation he says we understand he's got to be under so much pressure that's empathy in Hebrews chapter 4 verses 15 and 16 we're just about we're about to wrap up here and just stick with me a little bit he says for we have not a high priest I catch this we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the filling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin let us therefore come boldly which is honestly under the throne of grace there there doesn't need to be pretense you don't need you you can come honestly before the throne of grace you don't need to hide anything you don't need to have this pretense and these HS of well I need this and I need that you can just admit it because Jesus will understand he'll empathize so we can come boldly we don't have to come with HS or pretense under the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find Grace to help in time of need I like to say this this is more than sympathy but empathy well brother Bram said we realize that we're everyone guilty what did that provoking you when you were Before the Throne empathy not sympathizing and saying oh you know this guy is's just a devil I just feel sorry for him it's you realize man I do some of the same things yeah maybe I don't do it as bad but I or I've done that before are you listening to me it's empathy I think I believe my original title I was going to use is compassion with empathy because I I wanted to use this this idea of compassion but then take it a step further that it's it's more than just compassion it's more than having pity but it's having empathy because we have a high priest which can be touched which means have compassion but it's more than just have compassion but it means to be affected with the same feeling as another so it's not that he's up there sinless and you're to go oh I'm being tempted and he's like man I just I I know that's got to be hard I don't know what it's like but I know that's got to be difficult but he was tempted yet without sin but then also he became sin righten he has a level of empathy did he ever commit sin no but he has a level of empathy where he knows what it's like yes he could be sympathetic to those who do sin but I'm saying there's more to it he can be affected with the same feeling that when you go to them with the feeling say I know what you're feeling it's empathy he can be touched the scripture talks about it's compassion I I know kind of the the way that we're the way we kind of built our Theology and and I say this because I remember I know for me just getting really really legalistic um you know he he called Lyndon B Johnson brother Johnson and and I had just this strict rubric in my life that basically if somebody denied certain evident tenants in the message I'd be like how could I call him brother I mean really come on right how can they really be my brother if they're outright denying certain basic truths of the message and I realize what value is there in that true just just I'm going to show myself different like oh well you know bless you dude right I'm not g to say brother I'm just going to say their name a a and deprive them of that when brother Brandon would call Lind be Johnson the president brother Johnson that's instructive that tells us something about our attitudes and how we're looking down on people and how we allow to hold on to these prejudices and these spites and so brother Bram tells us that real Divine compassion is to do the will of him that sent you to do it he said that's what agape love is so we know there's this big confusion about real compassion in real love we say well Jesus didn't have compassion because he didn't heal all the other sick at the pool of Bethesda but he was doing what God asked him to do that's real Divine compassion is to do the will of God but let me say this the real Divine compassion will never lead you to violate the word of God compromise the word of God deny the word of God or otherwise reject the word of God you cannot say that you're just doing the will of God and exhibiting agape love in real Divine compassion when you're hating and you're exhibiting nastiness I'm just going to use that as an umbrella to cover all those things we can talk about to do the will of him you have to love thy neighbor as thyself you have to do un good good to those who despitefully use you and then you'll find that the word of God is very explicit about what his will is and how we treat other people so as I bring it to this musicians if you'd like to come I'm giving you the option because I could just keep preaching all night but this will help bring it to a close empathy a remedy for a remedy not saying it's all of it but it's a remedy for hate because we don't allow our hearts to become hard we don't get cold but we have empathy a change of perspective can change your heart where it melts feelings of resentment it it takes away the bitterness I if I could put it I I think even in more innocent context I maybe in the way that we're talking about sometimes it does pit it in sides where you have like the the North and the South Waring in a civil war and it's just such deepr rooted hatred and there's been this great big Chasm and they're on different sides of a Warfare but sometimes it's just right within our own home that's right a and a husband and wife or a parent to a child just get on different sides and something can be done that's wrong it's a betrayal it hurts and his brother B saying it's wrong it's evil it's it it it there's no justifying or excusing it but from your St vantage point of being the one that's hurt you don't ever allow yourself the opportunity of understanding what happened to them and why they did what they did and even though what they ultimately did hurt you and cause great hurt you don't understand that where it ultimately came from is it was the devil that got them twisted up it's not because they hate you it's not because they're at war with you it's not because it's it's not as bad as you're making it out out to be if you could just understand what made him do it and sometimes if you just can begin to empathize with the other person it begins to melt the bitterness and you realize I'm hurt for what you did I'm very very hurt by what you did and I've got my own hurt to deal with but I understand now why you did what you did what made you that way and now we can together I'm not your enemy I'm not your ad even though I'm the victim and this I'm I want together together let's heal amen and that's because I I don't think that we should ever look at our spouses and our children and our neighbors as our enemy so that if we're asked to love our enemies to love those that hate us it should just be this trickle down it's like if I'm asked to do that then how much more is brother BR said what about your brother who makes a mistake I'll be brother Timothy even mentioned this on Sunday in the sermon that day on Calvary he said he lived and had eternal life because he did not live for himself he lived for others and you receive eternal life by receiving that day and you don't live for yourself no more you live for others that day is that day on Calvary someone said how can you stand and let anyone call you such bad names here's your this is the a remedy a remedy for hate remedy for bitterness he says you don't live for yourself you live for others that you might redeem that man what man is he talking about the one who's spewing out the hate you become sons and the trouble of it is that the church has forgot they were Sons you are Sons you're taking Christ's place you are Sons so don't live for yourself live for others well brother BR I can live for this brother because he sure is a nice man that's not it live for the man that hates you live for that person who would kill you if they could could we get a clear uh tape on this to be sure that's not what he said are we sure we filtered this down enough were they do using some sort of AI on this and generating this live for the person that would kill you if they could that's what they did to him they killed him and he died that he might save them that's eternal life when that's in your bosom notice now it's perspective you're facing heaven then you're not facing the offender you're not facing the evil we've got to change perspective because when we're facing heaven and if we can have the courage to bring up our offender in the presence of God and now we're standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the one that's hurt us and we're standing there facing Heaven it's there in that perspective that things can change he says you're facing heaven then but then you sacrifice your own things give them up like the sheep gives its wool you look on towards Calvary that's what's going to give us the empathy I believe that we can relate can we not relate we've often said things hateful we've often done things wrong we've betrayed we've lied we've stole we've killed we've done all those things we were Sinners too and as the poet said but for the grace of God there goeth I I I have walked a mile in his moccasins I have been there before but somebody who loved me who turned his back on my sins there was one who rescued me that's right am why because let's just admit it we're the Samaritans we're the ones that are EST stranged we're the ones that were uh uh heathens we were the ones broken from the promise We're The Pretenders but he loved us and he redeemed us so much that we could realize that the hate for sin his God detested he hates it he hates Pride he hates lies and guess what we're born in the world doing it but yet he did not let his hate for sin deprive us of the love he had for our souls and I believe it challenges us to be more empathetic and I hope it helps in this there's so much more we can Minister on this subject after having dealt with hate for so long I think there's it's a challenge to us that when we go through a situation maybe it's not rising to the level of hate maybe it's not rising to the level of betrayal but all these little things that happen if we could just try to understand the situation a little bit better and give context think of it this way often times we're EAS we're very quick to justify ourselves like well I do this because that's my personality that's the way I am that's the way I'm just this way but we never give the benefit of Doubt to somebody else and that's what empathy can be you know what I can be really weird I'll let them be weird too I can do this I can do that I understand where they're coming from it doesn't mean you're excused nor they excuse but it's recognized in a situation where it's already bad let's not make it worse [Music] and maybe it comes down to even being a little bit more empathetic with ourselves and because we're not willing to give ourselves room to grow and to make mistakes and to change we're not willing to do with others there's a whole lot we can learn from this could we pray together tonight if you'll just stand together with me
