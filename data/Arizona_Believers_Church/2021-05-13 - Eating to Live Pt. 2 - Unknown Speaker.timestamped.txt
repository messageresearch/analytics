[0:00] matthew chapter 6 verse 9
[0:05] matthew chapter 6 verse 9 and we'll read
[0:07] to verse 13.
[0:09] we're continuing on the thought of
[0:11] eating to live
[0:12] and we've been examining the subject of
[0:14] being hungry and taking the word of god
[0:16] and eating it and feeding on the right
[0:17] things
[0:18] and so i'd like to kind of finish up
[0:22] what we were exploring last wednesday
[0:24] night and then take a little bit of a
[0:25] turn of a corner hopefully about midway
[0:27] through to begin to look at
[0:29] what's inspired me about this uh eating
[0:32] and its appropriateness for the hour
[0:34] that we're living in
[0:35] matthew chapter six verse nine after
[0:37] this manner therefore pray ye
[0:39] so jesus is teaching his disciples to
[0:42] pray our father which art in heaven
[0:44] hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come
[0:47] thy will be done
[0:48] in earth as it is in heaven give us
[0:51] this day our daily bread and forgive us
[0:54] our debts as we forgive our debtors
[0:56] and lead us not into temptation but
[0:58] deliver us from evil
[1:00] for thine is the kingdom and the power
[1:02] and the glory
[1:03] forever amen amen you may be seated
[1:13] i'd like to read a statement at the
[1:15] outset uh
[1:16] it's a little bit out of the way maybe
[1:18] um in the flow of the service i
[1:20] i'd been pondering maybe to use it at
[1:22] the end
[1:24] but i had was just reading today and
[1:26] studying and i came across this
[1:27] statement and i was so
[1:29] uh moved by it and i thought it was so
[1:30] profound i sent it along to
[1:32] a number of my friends even some that
[1:35] probably wouldn't even normally text
[1:36] they just all of a sudden get a quote
[1:38] from me and they think well this must be
[1:39] substantial
[1:40] but um i want to read it just at the
[1:43] outset
[1:44] and maybe it will i think you can see
[1:46] where it'll tie in but
[1:47] brother branham this sermon separation
[1:49] from unbelief he says it's a bad way for
[1:51] you to come
[1:52] to church at night expecting to get
[1:54] healed
[1:55] and i can say expecting anything and he
[1:58] says
[1:58] without having a good long season of
[2:00] prayer before you leave home
[2:02] and so he's kind of and i would say this
[2:04] is certainly appropriate if you're
[2:05] looking for healing and you're looking
[2:07] for god to come and do something very
[2:08] supernatural
[2:09] touch you in a particular area of life
[2:11] that you have to have the sincerity
[2:13] with which you approach the um approach
[2:15] the lord and approach his gift
[2:18] and the opportunity that he gives in a
[2:20] church service and this is what he says
[2:21] we ought to pray
[2:22] in this uh long season of prayer as he
[2:25] calls it say lord i want you tonight to
[2:28] do something for me
[2:29] when i get down down there tonight may
[2:31] the holy spirit just sink
[2:33] every word in my heart and faithful
[2:36] anchor there
[2:37] and i can raise right up in the meeting
[2:39] and get my healing
[2:40] and walk away perfectly whole and this
[2:43] is really god's
[2:44] uh preferred method this is god's way of
[2:46] giving us healing
[2:47] is through the word this is the bride's
[2:49] way as she matures to come to a place
[2:51] where she takes him at his word
[2:53] and the preaching of the word of god
[2:56] produces these great signs and wonders
[2:58] in our midst and in our hearts and in
[2:59] our lives
[3:00] so he says let every word sink into my
[3:02] heart let faith anchor and i'm going to
[3:03] leave
[3:04] perfectly whole he says but this is kind
[3:06] of like the opposite of what happens he
[3:08] says then you'll get healing
[3:09] then you will go get getting healed but
[3:12] so
[3:12] this is the way to approach him in the
[3:14] season of prayer approaching service
[3:16] with this mindset this attitude says but
[3:18] if you eat a great big supper
[3:20] fuss around the house a while argue all
[3:22] the way down
[3:23] why then when you come down here you'll
[3:24] probably go back the same way you come
[3:26] in
[3:27] and it's remarkable and i think we could
[3:29] all say amen to that
[3:31] how we have often just come especially
[3:33] maybe on a wednesday night where we've
[3:35] eaten a big supper
[3:36] we've had certain things going on and
[3:37] taking place and there's fussing and
[3:39] fighting and there's a lot of commotion
[3:41] and we just make it in time to service
[3:44] and we're not in the state of mind and
[3:45] we're not in the right
[3:46] frame of expectation under the right
[3:49] kind of expectation to really receive
[3:51] something from god
[3:52] and when we leave maybe we're leaving
[3:54] the same way we came in
[3:56] and and you could say well you could ask
[3:59] me well what what you want me to take
[4:00] away from this
[4:01] i think one would be to establish a good
[4:04] habit before going to church
[4:06] and reminding ourselves that we're not
[4:08] just going to church
[4:10] we don't come to hear the word of god
[4:11] the same way we'd go to baseball
[4:12] practice or the same way we'd go
[4:14] to top flight golf the way we'd go to
[4:16] dinner there's just there's a way that
[4:17] we want to approach this
[4:18] because this is more than just a natural
[4:20] gathering this is more than just a place
[4:22] where we expect to hear something that
[4:24] would teach us some good real estate
[4:25] investment tips
[4:27] or ways to approach the stock market
[4:28] this is an opportunity to hear from god
[4:31] so we approach it with a mindset i'm
[4:33] going to come and i'm going to hear from
[4:34] the lord
[4:36] and if you if you leave a service and
[4:38] you feel hey i really don't think i
[4:39] really got anything out of that
[4:41] it's always it's always good to first
[4:43] self-examine and ask yourself well
[4:45] how did i in what condition did i arrive
[4:47] to church in
[4:48] was there a big was there a big supper
[4:50] and a lot of fuss and a lot of fight and
[4:52] you just kind of make it in
[4:53] and then you kind of we show up and kind
[4:55] of said this all right fix me preacher
[4:56] all right tell me something new
[4:58] uh give me the word of god and we leave
[5:00] well i didn't get much out of service
[5:02] it's important
[5:03] to step back and ask ourselves well was
[5:06] i in a position to receive something
[5:08] did i approach it the right way was i
[5:10] was in the frame of mind where when the
[5:11] man of god began to get into a
[5:13] particular area
[5:14] that would have been beneficial to me i
[5:16] was in i was able to kind of catch what
[5:17] was being said
[5:18] and be in harmony with the holy spirit
[5:21] and i thought this statement was just
[5:22] really really profound and really struck
[5:24] me so i wanted to share it in the outset
[5:26] and i think it does speak to the subject
[5:30] of eating to live
[5:31] because it talks about our mindset and
[5:33] our attitude when we come to hear the
[5:35] word
[5:36] are we coming prayerfully are we coming
[5:38] with the attitude that i want to receive
[5:39] something from you
[5:40] and are we asking holy spirit let every
[5:43] word sink into my heart
[5:44] where faith can anchor so that i can
[5:47] walk away better
[5:48] can walk away having heard from god and
[5:50] having been benefited
[5:52] i think that's a wonderful statement in
[5:54] second timothy chapter four
[5:56] we want to read verses two to four and
[5:59] this will be
[6:00] just picking right back up where we were
[6:03] before
[6:04] second timothy chapter four verses two
[6:06] to four
[6:07] paul instructing timothy says preach the
[6:09] word the instant in season
[6:11] out of season reprove rebuke exhort with
[6:13] all longsuffering and doctrine
[6:16] for the time will come when they will
[6:18] not endure sound doctrine the people
[6:21] will not be able to handle
[6:23] pure teaching good teaching sound
[6:25] doctrine that's sound doctor means
[6:26] something that's not mixed with
[6:27] air and has opinions and other things
[6:30] mixed into it they
[6:31] they will not be able to stomach it as
[6:33] we pointed out last time
[6:35] and he says but after their own lust
[6:36] shall they heap to themselves teachers
[6:38] they still want to hear
[6:40] they just don't want to hear sound
[6:41] doctrine they still want to be taught
[6:43] they just don't want to be taught
[6:44] sound doctrine they'll heap to
[6:46] themselves teachers having itching ears
[6:48] this is a they have a an itch that needs
[6:50] to be scratched they they want to hear
[6:52] it a particular way they want to hear a
[6:53] specific doctrine
[6:54] expounded upon they actually need needed
[6:57] to be within a particular channel or
[6:58] maybe even a certain manner like if the
[7:00] preacher doesn't get really worked up
[7:02] then wow that didn't really suit my
[7:03] fancy and others can be well if the
[7:05] preacher gets too worked up
[7:06] well that kind of offends me i don't
[7:08] like it when they move around that much
[7:09] i don't like it when they get loud
[7:11] and so they have a taste that they want
[7:13] to get when they're hearing the word
[7:16] and it says this causes them they shall
[7:18] turn away their ears from the truth
[7:20] and shall be turned unto fables and we
[7:23] took this scripture just to point out
[7:24] that something had
[7:25] changed in their diet something had
[7:28] changed in their appetite
[7:29] to where they can't stomach the word of
[7:31] god he's saying there's going to be a
[7:32] time when the people will not be able to
[7:34] stomach the word
[7:35] but they're actually going to crave
[7:36] things that are not spiritually healthy
[7:39] they're still going to have a crave for
[7:40] spiritual things they're still going to
[7:42] have a language that may
[7:43] refer to biblical things and scriptural
[7:46] things and things pertaining to the word
[7:48] but then it cannot be sound otherwise
[7:50] they don't want to eat it
[7:52] there has to be some personality mixed
[7:54] into it something else in it so they can
[7:55] okay
[7:56] that's good enough that i can eat that
[7:58] we may we all may know some
[8:00] some people that will eat anything as
[8:01] long as there's enough hot sauce on it
[8:04] and there's certain people like that and
[8:05] some people even just by virtue of
[8:07] uh smoking seven packs a day for their
[8:09] whole lives have to add enough tabasco
[8:11] to things just so that they can taste it
[8:14] and in some ways that may be exactly how
[8:16] some people approach the word of god
[8:18] you have to add things in it has to be
[8:20] in a particular package it has to be
[8:21] served a particular way
[8:23] otherwise they don't want it if it's
[8:24] just the pure word coming
[8:26] in a pure way they can't stomach it but
[8:28] then they still crave
[8:30] for something but what they crave for
[8:33] isn't going to build them up
[8:35] spiritually and so we saw even in the
[8:38] scripture how by not feeding on the
[8:39] truth it causes you to turn from the
[8:41] truth where they left their first love
[8:43] and
[8:43] they had not learned to love the truth
[8:45] here it says they shall be turned
[8:46] to fables so they begin to build this
[8:49] appetite for
[8:50] fables they begin to have this craving
[8:53] this taste i need to hear
[8:54] fiction i need to hear a story i need to
[8:56] hear something in it
[8:58] and so this is kind of those are some of
[8:59] the things that we were speaking on last
[9:01] time
[9:02] and how brother ram talks about they're
[9:03] cutting away the very value of the word
[9:05] they're taking the word which is pure
[9:07] and they're taking the benefit out of it
[9:09] because god is in his word
[9:11] and you can't take the word and change
[9:12] it and then expect to get the full
[9:14] benefits of the word
[9:15] there has to be there has it has to be
[9:17] the word it can't you can't preach jesus
[9:19] and add something to it
[9:20] and say well i'm preaching jesus there's
[9:22] not another jesus you can't add to or
[9:24] take away from the word
[9:26] and still be preaching the word so by
[9:27] changing the word
[9:29] it deprives the hear or as we're
[9:31] pointing it out this way it deprives the
[9:32] eater
[9:33] of the nutrients that the word has the
[9:36] essential ingredients in the word that's
[9:38] supposed to give us this
[9:39] energy and this strength and this power
[9:42] if you change the word or you mix
[9:43] something into the word or you
[9:45] cut it in half you take out the power
[9:48] and the effectiveness of the word
[9:50] that we made reference to kind of hybrid
[9:52] and even genetically modified you could
[9:54] take those principles
[9:56] in our natural diet how so if something
[9:58] can be pure if something is not hybrid
[10:00] if something's not mixed in
[10:01] there's something different about the
[10:03] original seed there's something
[10:04] different about those plants
[10:06] that are organic and they have better
[10:08] nutrients and our body can better relate
[10:10] to them and
[10:10] and use them in a better way that's kind
[10:12] of a principle that i want you to think
[10:14] about
[10:16] so we were identifying scripturally how
[10:17] that there's a cycle
[10:19] of how the wrong diet leads to the wrong
[10:22] kind of cravings
[10:24] paul says they don't endure sound
[10:25] doctrine but they heap to themselves
[10:27] teachers and what they're hearing
[10:29] doesn't cause them to turn back to the
[10:31] word but it actually causes them to
[10:32] crave the wrong things
[10:34] and it has to have something to itch
[10:35] scratch their itch their ears or tickle
[10:38] their ears
[10:39] and in doing so you eat the wrong things
[10:41] you begin to crave the wrong things and
[10:42] so it
[10:43] creates a cycle that begins to
[10:44] perpetuate and how is it that you have
[10:47] to get out of it in the natural
[10:48] sometimes you have to go on a diet
[10:50] have to go on a fast or go on some sort
[10:52] of cleanse to do what kind of break the
[10:54] cravings
[10:55] so you can say no to the the pound cake
[10:58] or the pound of pound cake
[11:00] so you can say no to the you know did
[11:01] you know they're handing out free donuts
[11:03] to anybody that got a vaccine
[11:04] sign me up there's a dozen vac dozen
[11:06] krispy kreme donuts because you got a
[11:08] vaccine
[11:09] and you feel like well it's my civic
[11:10] duty not only to get the vaccine but
[11:12] also eat a dozen donuts
[11:14] for getting it and you find yourself
[11:15] craving these things
[11:17] after you eat a meal that should
[11:18] completely satisfy what happens
[11:20] well i i want to have the i don't is
[11:22] there still claim jumpers
[11:23] nearby they have do they still have that
[11:26] boston cream
[11:27] dessert that's like a foot and a half
[11:29] long
[11:30] right foot long i ordered a foot in half
[11:33] long
[11:34] and what do you do you have to eat the
[11:35] whole thing you have to have that after
[11:37] you eat dinner and you have to eat it
[11:38] this is the cycle
[11:40] of eating the wrong things and then
[11:41] craving the wrong things and it just
[11:43] keeps perpetuating
[11:44] and the point spiritually is if you're
[11:47] in that cycle when it comes to church
[11:49] when you're in that cycle when it comes
[11:50] to the message of the hour
[11:52] if you're in that cycle in terms of
[11:54] following jesus christ it's going to
[11:55] weaken your appetite for the pure word
[11:58] it's going to have to be in a particular
[12:00] way it's going to have to maybe even be
[12:01] a particular preacher it's going to have
[12:02] to be
[12:03] it's going to have to say a certain
[12:04] thing or you're just not going to really
[12:06] have the patience for it
[12:07] if you're feeding on the wrong things
[12:09] it's going to weaken your appetite for
[12:11] the pure word of god
[12:13] in proverbs chapter 13 verse 25 says the
[12:16] righteous edith to the satisfying of his
[12:18] soul
[12:19] but the belly of the wicked shall want
[12:21] and some translations
[12:23] render this to the righteous eat to live
[12:26] and the wicked
[12:27] live to eat and there's a
[12:30] this is a saying that i think has its
[12:33] root in scripture
[12:34] even socrates said bad men live that
[12:37] they may eat and drink whereas good men
[12:39] eat and drink that they may live
[12:41] and we realize that we all we all have
[12:43] to we all live to eat in the sense that
[12:46] you know because we're alive we can eat
[12:48] again and if you're eating you want to
[12:49] enjoy it
[12:50] but it's identifying a mindset it's
[12:53] identifying
[12:54] an approach to eating or a perspective
[12:56] on eating
[12:57] it says the righteous eat some of the
[13:00] translations and the wording means the
[13:01] righteous eat and they're satisfied
[13:04] so the right way to eat brings
[13:05] satisfaction it brings contentment it
[13:07] brings fulfillment
[13:09] and as brother branham was even
[13:10] identifying if you don't come to church
[13:12] with prayerfully and under expectation
[13:14] and say lord feed my soul
[13:16] then you walk away and you go back the
[13:18] same way you came in you go out
[13:20] hungry why because you haven't
[13:22] approached
[13:23] the the the meal you haven't approached
[13:25] the service you haven't come to it
[13:26] with this attitude of i need something i
[13:28] want something and therefore when you
[13:30] eat you leave satisfied if you come you
[13:32] say well i ate i heard every word i said
[13:33] amen
[13:34] but if you don't leave satisfied then
[13:36] maybe something
[13:37] is wrong in how whether or not your
[13:39] approach to eating is correct
[13:42] so feasting on the word should bring
[13:43] contentment it should even provoke
[13:46] the right desire it produces the right
[13:48] thing but it says the wicked eat
[13:50] and still want the belly of the wick and
[13:52] still want so they eat and they're left
[13:54] dissatisfied
[13:56] so here's two different eaters they sit
[13:58] down they eat one eats and is happy and
[14:00] is satisfied another one eats but he's
[14:02] left dissatisfied
[14:03] and it and as a consequence is unhealthy
[14:07] so in one side and even putting this in
[14:09] natural terms you have the righteous who
[14:11] eat and then are satisfied that's
[14:12] someone who's eating healthy
[14:14] then you have on the other side the
[14:15] wicked who eats but then he's
[14:16] dissatisfied his belly still wants
[14:18] that's eating wrong
[14:20] eating poorly so you have these two
[14:21] different sides that we're using this
[14:23] type of eating and a natural diet to
[14:25] understand
[14:26] so you have one that eats and receives
[14:28] contentment and can live spiritually
[14:30] healthy
[14:31] the other who's eating but yet since
[14:32] it's not contenting him
[14:34] there's still maybe more eating but it's
[14:36] not giving him the spiritual benefit of
[14:38] what he's supposedly eating
[14:39] should give them and so i want to use
[14:43] an example of this in the natural
[14:47] and they have found through various
[14:49] different studies that people who are
[14:50] unhealthy have fewer dopamine receptors
[14:53] than healthy people
[14:54] and so you have these dopamine receptors
[14:57] that are going to
[14:58] kind of fire off they're going to catch
[15:00] things they're going to get signals
[15:01] they're going to receive
[15:02] input and then it's going to create a
[15:04] stimulus when you eat
[15:06] and so they say that and these dopamine
[15:08] receptors are related to
[15:10] our neurological processes so they're
[15:12] supposed to they even say that these
[15:13] receptors these dopamine receptors
[15:15] relate to motivation
[15:16] and pleasure and memory and learning and
[15:19] and
[15:19] the control of signaling all the neurons
[15:21] signaling to your body so this is
[15:23] a real important part of how our mind
[15:25] works so i have these dopamine receptors
[15:27] and it relates to my motivation and my
[15:29] memory and my ability to learn and my
[15:31] control these different things
[15:34] and so what they found with the
[15:35] unhealthy people
[15:37] is that without the these enough
[15:39] dopamine receptors or real healthy and
[15:41] vital receptors
[15:43] when they eat they derive less pleasure
[15:45] from eating
[15:46] and in receiving less pleasure from
[15:49] eating
[15:49] it leads to bad cravings so this is the
[15:53] science behind
[15:54] why you can eat and you and you want to
[15:56] eat more and you want to keep eating
[15:57] more and you want to keep eating more
[15:58] they call it heat and eating where
[16:01] you're eating merely for pleasure
[16:02] consuming food for pleasure
[16:04] and you're not consuming food to
[16:06] maintain what they call energy
[16:08] homeostasis
[16:10] write it down you can feel educated you
[16:11] can go past a certification i'm sure by
[16:13] the end of this service
[16:15] and be and be at least a a nutritional
[16:18] assistant or something
[16:20] so they say that these people who don't
[16:21] have these fewer dopamine receptors
[16:23] they're eating for pleasure and they're
[16:26] eating just to satisfy cravings and
[16:28] they're not eating really because
[16:30] they're hungry
[16:31] and they've depleted their energy and
[16:32] they need to maintain this their energy
[16:35] levels
[16:36] it's energy homeostasis or homeostasis
[16:38] is the state of optimal
[16:39] steady functioning of a living organism
[16:42] so you eat so that you're in an optimal
[16:43] state
[16:44] you eat i give myself um i'm eating
[16:47] calories i'm eating substance so that my
[16:49] body can stay in this
[16:50] this state of optimal functioning i'm a
[16:52] living organism i have to
[16:54] take things i have to feed on things i
[16:55] have to put things into my body
[16:57] and i do that because energy is being
[16:59] depleted i need to maintain these energy
[17:01] stores
[17:01] and this is energy homeostasis i need to
[17:03] maintain vital function
[17:06] so energy homeostasis is the regulation
[17:08] of food intake
[17:09] in energy expenditure what is that food
[17:12] in
[17:13] or energy in through the food which is
[17:14] how a calorie is a measure of energy
[17:17] so you're consuming this and then there
[17:19] should be energy out
[17:22] now that's how it ought to work that's
[17:23] an optimally functioning
[17:25] uh uh body they say if you want to
[17:27] maintain weight they figure by your
[17:28] height
[17:29] and your in your gender and and uh and
[17:32] your weight that this is how many
[17:33] calories you need a day
[17:35] this is how much energy in you need a
[17:36] day to maintain weight
[17:38] based upon they figure this is how much
[17:40] energy a person of your size and weight
[17:43] and age
[17:44] and build and gender is going to burn so
[17:45] the energy in
[17:47] ought to be expended and not to be used
[17:49] up and this should keep you
[17:50] in this optimal state of functioning but
[17:53] in an
[17:53] unhealthy condition a person is eating
[17:57] because of the psychological reward and
[18:00] not because their energy need
[18:03] they're following this when they when
[18:06] someone is eating in this heating
[18:08] a hedonic eating or this they have fewer
[18:10] dopamine receptors they're eating but
[18:11] they're not
[18:12] eating because they they want to reserve
[18:14] enter they want to store energy or
[18:16] because they need energy
[18:17] they're eating just because of a
[18:18] psychological reward and if as i say
[18:21] this if it's to you kind of saying well
[18:22] isn't that what eating is all about
[18:24] i mean i join with you i i don't find
[18:27] myself typically when i'm eating saying
[18:29] well
[18:29] i want to be sure that i i i get enough
[18:32] energy in because i'm expending energy
[18:33] i'm generally
[18:34] hey where do you want to go eat and we
[18:36] begin to think in terms of
[18:37] what sounds good what's going to taste
[18:40] good what's going to scratch the itch of
[18:42] my pleasure center
[18:43] where and i want to eat for
[18:45] psychological reward and i'm not saying
[18:47] well what's the place where i can eat
[18:49] and i'll receive an optimal amount of
[18:51] calories
[18:51] that'll balance out the energy that's
[18:53] been expended and give me some reserves
[18:55] in order to make it through the
[18:56] remainder of the day
[18:57] i don't approach eating that way
[19:00] and if all of you do then you know how
[19:02] to pray for me i'm generally looking for
[19:04] something that's good and something
[19:05] that's rich
[19:06] and something that i'm is going to be
[19:08] four stars and the palette
[19:10] uh category like hey that was awesome we
[19:11] need to go back that was good and i'm
[19:13] not walking away saying wow that was
[19:15] that's that should fill up my energy
[19:16] needs i'm in a state of energy depletion
[19:19] and i need to consume energy so that i
[19:20] can remain at this optimal state
[19:22] no that's the person you don't invite to
[19:24] lunch
[19:26] but in understanding this this negative
[19:28] way that we can eat as humans
[19:31] this it's i'm wanting you to look at
[19:33] this how there's kind of a
[19:34] there's a context so there's a way you
[19:36] use that as a type how we approach
[19:37] spiritual eating
[19:38] but they call this eating that's driven
[19:40] by pleasure
[19:42] and when you're eating and it's driven
[19:44] by pleasure you say well there may have
[19:46] been nothing wrong with choosing a place
[19:47] that sounds good and has good food and
[19:49] you enjoy it
[19:50] but it begins to feed a habit to where
[19:54] the the meal you ate the entree wasn't
[19:56] enough you need to see the dessert menu
[19:59] and i said would you like to see the
[20:00] dessert train you said yes i would
[20:02] actually
[20:02] i would like to see the whole thing and
[20:04] if you could just leave it here it'll be
[20:06] fine we'll take care of it
[20:07] and so you begin to crave things you
[20:09] begin to crave sweets you begin to
[20:11] want to eat a dessert even after a
[20:13] satisfying meal you have cravings
[20:15] towards the end of the day you need
[20:16] something more you need something more
[20:18] that's not
[20:19] the body itself telling you
[20:22] that it needs more calories to maintain
[20:24] an optimal state of functioning
[20:26] that's the pleasure center of your mind
[20:28] your psychology saying
[20:30] i'm hungry i'm craving i want to i want
[20:32] something to hit the spot
[20:34] i need something to kind of scratch that
[20:35] itch and you may have already received
[20:37] enough calories from what you received
[20:39] what you ate in the meal but how many
[20:41] times we even says well that just didn't
[20:43] hit the what
[20:44] the spot and by spot we don't mean the
[20:46] stomach
[20:48] we really don't even need the mean the
[20:50] mouth cause it all made it down our pie
[20:51] hole
[20:52] right and it's made it it's it's on its
[20:55] way to work its way through the
[20:56] digestive system but we say well it just
[20:58] didn't hit the spot
[20:59] it's the psychological part that's not
[21:01] satisfying
[21:02] and this is when you're we can say
[21:04] you're probably in an unhealthy state of
[21:06] mind
[21:06] because it's then that you say well you
[21:08] know what why don't we just go ahead and
[21:09] order pizza
[21:11] you just had a whole meal well it just
[21:13] didn't hit the spot let me eat a whole
[21:15] gallon of bluebell
[21:16] rocky road ice cream because it didn't
[21:18] hit the spot
[21:19] and that's the way that we can respond
[21:21] and act
[21:23] when we're now eating for pleasure and
[21:26] we're not eating for need
[21:29] and so consumption for food or
[21:31] consumption of food for pleasure
[21:34] has become more and more common in our
[21:36] society
[21:37] and in doing so it's become more
[21:40] problematic
[21:41] dozens of studies have been done on it i
[21:43] say dozens dozens and dozens of studies
[21:45] have been done
[21:46] they're looking at how that we have made
[21:47] available cheap processed foods
[21:50] and how that you can just grab a bag of
[21:52] chips you could grab a diet coke
[21:54] and you can eat that and it doesn't it's
[21:55] not really going to give you
[21:57] the the true contentment and
[21:59] satisfaction the body needs
[22:01] it's just going to set you up for more
[22:02] cravings later you're going to want
[22:04] another you're going to want this and
[22:05] you're going to want that
[22:06] and these are things that we begin to
[22:07] consume in the natural which creates
[22:09] bad habits in the natural now i want to
[22:13] use this as a type
[22:14] when the bible says a righteous man eats
[22:17] to the satisfying of his soul
[22:19] that means when he's eating it brings
[22:20] contentment and satisfaction it brings a
[22:22] benefit whereas the wicked when he eats
[22:24] he's still left satisfies and he's still
[22:26] left unsat dissatisfied
[22:28] and so he still has a hunger he still
[22:31] has a craving
[22:32] and there's a way that we can put this
[22:34] to where if the word is not satisfying
[22:36] you
[22:37] you're going to seek something to
[22:39] satisfy you
[22:40] and if we're not finding our pleasure in
[22:42] the word of god we could find ourselves
[22:44] getting pulled into other things
[22:45] as kind of a release or an escape or a
[22:47] way to feel
[22:49] feel some sort of enjoyment or
[22:50] satisfaction and so it can
[22:52] tend to the wrong kind of living or an
[22:55] unsanctified lifestyle or mistakes that
[22:57] are made
[22:57] through the course of the day that might
[22:59] tend to things that are not pleasing to
[23:01] the lord
[23:02] in terms of temper and indulgence or
[23:04] things like that so
[23:05] i could use it in that context but
[23:07] within the context of what our spiritual
[23:09] appetite is
[23:10] we do not want to be come to a place of
[23:13] spiritually eating
[23:14] where we're just kind of in a
[23:15] traditionally approaching church
[23:17] traditionally approaching the word of
[23:19] god
[23:19] and we're just kind of scratching an
[23:21] itch and we're eating more out of
[23:22] pleasure
[23:23] for a psychological reward instead of
[23:25] actually feeding our souls
[23:27] and that's that's the point behind me
[23:29] using the phrase eating to live
[23:32] we're challenging our mindset when it
[23:34] comes to our interaction with the word
[23:36] how am i interacting with it am i am i
[23:39] taking the word
[23:40] and the word only am i taking the pure
[23:42] word and feeding on it because i have a
[23:45] a very sensitized conscious to the fact
[23:47] that i need this
[23:49] and i need what's in it and i have an
[23:52] energy need
[23:53] and and i'm i'm doing things that are
[23:56] pleasing to lord our desire to do things
[23:57] pleasing the lord we could even say
[23:59] right now if you want to live a
[24:00] christian life you want to do things
[24:02] that are pleasing to the lord you're
[24:03] going to need the energy of the word to
[24:04] expend that energy
[24:06] and so am i how am i interacting with
[24:09] the word am i
[24:09] interacting it within a way that what
[24:12] i'm actually receiving is my body's
[24:14] spiritual energy needs
[24:15] or am i interacting with it where i'm
[24:17] just getting the psychological reward
[24:22] it's an interesting thing to think about
[24:25] should we break out do we have a
[24:26] breakout session and get into discussion
[24:28] groups and
[24:28] ponder this for a moment because it's
[24:30] relevant
[24:32] it's very pertinent it's important to
[24:34] think about this because we can get into
[24:36] habits
[24:37] of even listening to the word of god and
[24:39] it's only become background noise
[24:41] and it's just there really to scratch a
[24:44] psychological itch
[24:46] and we don't have these times where
[24:47] we're interacting in it from the point
[24:49] of need
[24:50] i need this i need to hear this and it
[24:53] would beg the question of what things
[24:55] are we feeding on what
[24:56] if there's if there's if there's things
[24:58] going out what's coming in
[25:00] there's a phrase in computing uh
[25:02] programming or code garbage in garbage
[25:05] out
[25:06] you know if there's a there's it's got
[25:08] to be putting the right things in if you
[25:09] want the right things out
[25:11] and so are we eating are we eating to
[25:12] feed the soul are we meeting because of
[25:14] a spiritual energy need or are we just
[25:16] tickling our ears that's the question
[25:19] we're asking
[25:20] and so feeding on the wrong things i
[25:22] want you to see how brother bradham
[25:23] identifies this in the message and
[25:25] thirst
[25:26] and what i want you to see is how he
[25:27] takes the same type and i
[25:29] didn't have time maybe to expound upon
[25:31] these different places where he says
[25:32] this
[25:33] uh because he's using the point in the
[25:36] natural
[25:37] to refer to what's taking place in the
[25:39] spiritual
[25:40] let me say this feeding on the wrong
[25:42] things instigates a destructive cycle
[25:45] for not eating the right things we
[25:47] deteriorate in health naturally but now
[25:49] looking at spiritually if we're not
[25:51] feeding on the wrong
[25:52] right things and if we're not feeding
[25:53] the right way with the right approach
[25:55] and the right attitude
[25:56] it puts us in a cycle to where we're not
[25:58] getting the energy in
[25:59] that we need and then we begin to say
[26:02] crave and long and want to have
[26:04] but the things we crave for are not
[26:06] going to put us in the right kind of
[26:07] spiritual health
[26:08] so we're talking about spiritual diet
[26:10] brother branham says in the message
[26:12] thirst he says you see what's done it
[26:14] it's about the deteriorating of our
[26:16] human health it's been this hybrid food
[26:18] it's talking about
[26:19] the the the body changing for young
[26:21] girls and men and everyone he says this
[26:23] hybrid food and stuff we're eating
[26:25] see it's the stuff the food and the life
[26:28] that we're living
[26:29] scientist has brought it to us and in
[26:31] doing so they're killing you
[26:33] can i get a witness where's my hammond
[26:36] b3 backing me up in a moment like that
[26:39] that's exactly he's exactly the truth
[26:42] and this is what we believe and we had a
[26:44] prophet that was teaching us this back
[26:45] in the 50s and 60s
[26:47] and now you know all the all the
[26:49] nutritionists now are catching up to us
[26:51] saying oh no hybrid foods are bad and
[26:53] processed foods are bad and you
[26:54] shouldn't be eating this and you
[26:55] shouldn't be in that you say hey we've
[26:56] been believing that since we came to the
[26:58] message
[27:00] we've at least recognized that knew that
[27:02] the hybrid foods are
[27:03] causing cancers hybrid foods are causing
[27:05] health deficiencies
[27:06] hybrid foods are causing early menopause
[27:09] and and the changing of the physical
[27:11] body and it's all related to the foods
[27:14] that we're eating
[27:15] it's laid out it's it he lays this out
[27:17] of the message and he says it's the
[27:18] scientists who've done it
[27:20] and what is it he said was cutting away
[27:22] the value of the word the scientist
[27:25] so just as science has brought us a
[27:28] nutrition has brought us
[27:29] uh uh in my i just kind of said a phrase
[27:32] that
[27:32] makes me begin to think about our food
[27:34] pyramid and what you should eat for
[27:36] breakfast and a lot of times a lot of
[27:37] things
[27:38] that have framed uh those agendas
[27:41] and made those so important without
[27:43] getting into those let me just say it
[27:45] was the diamond lobby it was a diamond
[27:47] company that set
[27:48] that established the one month salary
[27:50] for an engagement ring
[27:52] that's not it's not tradition that's not
[27:54] in the word of god that's not something
[27:56] that men have done
[27:57] throughout ages that's not what's
[27:59] necessarily proper or right
[28:01] this is what de beers the diamond
[28:02] company wanted you to think that you
[28:04] better spend at least
[28:05] a month's salary on your engagement ring
[28:07] why so you'd buy a diamond
[28:10] when you buy a diamond you buy a lot and
[28:13] so not everyone who's told you what you
[28:14] should eat
[28:15] is always honest when they're telling
[28:18] you what you should eat
[28:19] that's why anytime someone tells me hey
[28:21] you really should be eating this all
[28:22] right what are you selling
[28:24] how did you know i have in my car here
[28:28] homemade granola bars that has
[28:29] everything in it that you'll ever need
[28:31] it's 100 flaxseed
[28:33] and don't eat too many at one time but
[28:34] i'm telling you this is what you need
[28:37] for optimal energy
[28:38] uh homeostasis i'm like oh okay you got
[28:41] to be careful sometimes people are
[28:42] selling you things and brother brahms
[28:44] identified how
[28:46] that this agenda and these scientists
[28:48] have offered us food and offered us
[28:50] nutritional things
[28:51] or things that are supposedly helpful to
[28:53] our nutrition he says but it's
[28:54] killing us the hybrid foods the changes
[28:57] the stuff that we're eating in the life
[28:59] we're living is deteriorating us
[29:01] so let me say this let's not let our
[29:04] spiritual receptors diminish
[29:07] if the wrong kind of eating an unhealthy
[29:08] lifestyle reduces the number of dopamine
[29:11] receptors or healthy dopamine receptors
[29:13] whereas one begins to eat they're not
[29:14] receiving the pleasure that they ought
[29:16] to receive and the contentment they
[29:17] ought to receive so they find themselves
[29:19] always craving to eat and craving to eat
[29:21] but never getting the real value and
[29:22] nutrients from it
[29:23] let us not let our spiritual discernment
[29:26] our spiritual taste
[29:27] and our spiritual appetite diminish
[29:30] let us not come to a place where our
[29:32] eating is driven by religion
[29:34] and not by life
[29:37] let it not be that there's things we say
[29:39] things we do things that we'll
[29:40] experience
[29:41] because we merely want to maintain
[29:42] religion and we're not eating because
[29:44] this is life or death
[29:46] why are you listening to that tape oh
[29:47] because i was told from headquarters
[29:49] that i better push play and obey
[29:52] you better be doing more than just doing
[29:54] that
[29:55] you better be doing it because it's life
[29:58] you better be doing it because you want
[29:59] to live not just because there's been
[30:01] some order given and i better do it
[30:03] no that that's how you begin to eat and
[30:05] it's unhealthy and what you do you just
[30:07] crave more human things
[30:08] more things of man and more nutrients
[30:11] that's been mixed into it and hybrid and
[30:13] perverted no
[30:14] i'd listen to the word of god because
[30:16] it's life or death
[30:17] i'm not eating to maintain religion i'm
[30:20] eating because i want to live
[30:23] and brother adam says in the message he
[30:25] cares do you care
[30:27] he says and these weaknesses of
[30:28] interbreeding of the foods that we are
[30:30] eating for life
[30:32] is weakening the body which causes
[30:34] cancer mental
[30:35] mental troubles and all kinds of
[30:37] diseases are setting in upon the human
[30:39] body
[30:40] because it is its weakness
[30:44] think about it scientific destroying
[30:47] themselves getting away from god's
[30:50] plan now there's a there's a way that we
[30:53] could look at this and say well the god
[30:54] gave the fruits and the herbs and he
[30:56] gave the
[30:56] cattle he gave certain things for man to
[30:58] eat and they ought to have just left it
[31:00] that way but when it came to food
[31:01] production and
[31:03] and the change from an agrarian society
[31:06] to a more production society and
[31:08] technological
[31:09] industrial society and these
[31:10] technological advancements you had to
[31:12] make food quickly had to process it you
[31:13] had to preserve it and there's all sorts
[31:15] of methods that begin to develop
[31:17] and science he says is destroying
[31:18] themselves and they've got away from
[31:20] god's plan
[31:21] now i want to get into god's plan and
[31:22] this is where we begin to turn the
[31:24] corner
[31:24] but notice what happens when you get
[31:26] away from god's plan and you hybrid the
[31:28] food
[31:29] and you're you weaken the body it causes
[31:31] cancer
[31:32] mental troubles all sorts of diseases
[31:35] because of the weakness of the food
[31:38] and the weakness of the food is actually
[31:41] what causes
[31:41] makes it strong economically or makes it
[31:44] strong for a capitalist
[31:45] because you want more of it you can't
[31:47] just get a little bit and go a long way
[31:49] you need more and you keep needing more
[31:50] and you need to keep needing more
[31:53] so scientific again scientists have
[31:55] brought it to us and are killing you now
[31:56] science
[31:57] has is destroying us destroying
[32:00] themselves
[32:00] and they've done it from getting away
[32:02] from god's plan
[32:05] now i'm talking about eating to live in
[32:07] a spiritual sense i'm not i'm talking
[32:08] about getting the word of god
[32:10] interacting with the word of god obeying
[32:12] the word of god
[32:13] not just so that we can satisfy a
[32:15] religious itch but we do it because it's
[32:17] life or death it's why we go to church
[32:20] it's why we obey the word of god that's
[32:22] why we
[32:23] do take communion and wash one another's
[32:25] feet it's why we pay our tithes it's why
[32:27] we give offerings it's why we
[32:29] it's why we live for others these all
[32:30] these things is part of feeding on the
[32:32] word of god
[32:33] expending energy in the word it's not
[32:35] religious function it's not the
[32:36] scratching itch it's not for pride or
[32:38] for politics or pretense
[32:39] it's so the word can have preeminence he
[32:42] says they get away from god's plan
[32:44] in the message greatest battle ever
[32:46] fought how many have listened to that
[32:47] lately
[32:48] a few of you i recommend listening to it
[32:50] it's a tremendous message and i've been
[32:52] pouring through it for some of these
[32:54] things we've been ministering on
[32:55] greatest battle ever fought he tries to
[32:57] show you satan does he tries to show you
[32:59] something better an easier way
[33:03] this is typically how it works with
[33:05] these processed foods
[33:07] they're easier they're just easier you
[33:10] just rip it open
[33:12] i was uh i was doing a um
[33:17] a shout out to dr andrew coffey uh he
[33:20] wanted me to do a sugar detox and i did
[33:22] it i did it with them and it's kind of
[33:23] like so what's what can you do and he
[33:25] said if it has a label on it don't eat
[33:27] it
[33:29] so i had elizabeth take all the labels
[33:30] off my favorite foods
[33:32] and it went great i mean the cleanse was
[33:34] a breeze really i don't know what the
[33:36] complaints were all about
[33:37] oh it the label speaks that this has
[33:39] gone through a process
[33:41] and it's easier for us just to take
[33:43] things that have a label on them say oh
[33:45] well this looks good you know it's
[33:47] it's uh you know there's no no carbs in
[33:50] it well
[33:50] but how many calories and how high in
[33:52] fat is it well it's just easy it's
[33:54] easier this way just to put it in these
[33:56] uh these ways of viewing things well i'm
[33:57] gonna eat all this and eat all that and
[33:59] sometimes the easier way
[34:01] is not the good way so he says he tries
[34:04] to show you a bet some
[34:05] something better an easier way or a more
[34:07] sensible plan
[34:09] but there's no more sensible plan than
[34:11] that which god
[34:12] laid down at the beginning
[34:16] there's no more sensible plan this is
[34:19] there's no more sensible plan than the
[34:20] plan that god laid down at the beginning
[34:22] and it
[34:23] is his word hold that word get a grip on
[34:28] it let it get a grip on you
[34:30] stay there with him that's exactly what
[34:32] we should do we should get a grip
[34:34] on it make sure it's got a grip on us
[34:35] and then stay there with
[34:37] it so god's plan god's plan for you to
[34:40] be spiritually healthy
[34:41] is not coming to church
[34:44] stay with me because this isn't our last
[34:47] service
[34:50] unless we're getting out of here in the
[34:51] meeting in the air and then it'll just
[34:53] be that eternal youth meeting
[34:57] there it's got to be part of an overall
[35:00] relationship with jesus christ
[35:02] in its right place otherwise can you
[35:06] believe it
[35:06] that actually going to church can hinder
[35:09] a lot of people
[35:10] because it just becomes part of their
[35:12] traditional approach to the message
[35:15] and at the end of the day they're not
[35:17] con they're not reading if i could just
[35:19] use this i know it says it has a label
[35:21] don't read it or you know don't eat it
[35:23] but they're not even reading the label
[35:24] on what they're eating anymore
[35:27] it doesn't matter well is it the message
[35:30] i mean is he quoting the message is it a
[35:31] message church i mean does he claim to
[35:32] believe the message okay all right
[35:33] i'm good and the only consideration
[35:36] people have anymore and say
[35:37] you know i hear there's a lot of good
[35:38] job opportunities in rhode island is
[35:40] there a church in rhode island
[35:42] i said yeah there's a church they don't
[35:44] even need to know what kind of church it
[35:45] is they just need to know there's a
[35:46] church there
[35:47] and they get there it's like there's not
[35:48] a message church in rhode island well
[35:50] you didn't ask about a message church
[35:52] you just asked about a church
[35:54] well that's what i meant well i didn't
[35:55] know that this church was this pastor
[35:57] believed in polygamy
[35:58] and had eight wives and the church was
[35:59] just nine people
[36:01] until i showed up
[36:04] well they're on the message directory
[36:07] you've got to give more thought to it
[36:09] than just is there a place where i can
[36:11] scratch the itch that you're supposed to
[36:14] go to church
[36:17] whoo
[36:21] hold to that word it's got to be the
[36:23] word brother brahm says in god of this
[36:25] evil age
[36:27] now this is kind of where we've turned
[36:29] the corner in this
[36:31] and i feel that even through um hungry
[36:35] and i am hungry and
[36:39] not being fed really
[36:42] through those sermons we've been
[36:43] identifying this eating to live we've
[36:45] been wanting just to kind of lay the
[36:46] foundation of the dynamics
[36:48] of hunger and even the mechanics of it
[36:50] and the natural parts to it
[36:53] in order to begin to turn our focus to
[36:55] the fact if i could say this and this is
[36:56] what i've been pondering the fact that
[36:58] god has
[36:59] laid out for us the best spiritual feast
[37:02] there has ever been in any age
[37:05] at any time you name it it's
[37:08] there's never been a better one and so
[37:10] this is the time that we're living in to
[37:12] where we're going to be living way below
[37:14] our privileges if we just kind of
[37:16] approach this as a need to satisfy
[37:18] religion
[37:19] or as a need to kind of promote religion
[37:21] or we're eating for religious purposes
[37:23] and we're not eating
[37:25] for life like this food is life there's
[37:28] rapturing faith in this word
[37:30] there's power to overcome in this word
[37:32] it's just not an escape from the trials
[37:34] of life so i can go and hang out with
[37:35] some believers
[37:36] we have to have some fellowship together
[37:38] and we can hear a good sermon preached
[37:39] about the message
[37:40] and we can see everybody who believes
[37:41] the message then we go right back to the
[37:43] grind
[37:43] but we're showing up and everyone comes
[37:45] and everyone knows
[37:47] i know why you're here i know exactly
[37:49] why you're here
[37:50] uh-huh let's go let's do this we're here
[37:53] to feed
[37:54] we're here to get the word why because
[37:55] life awaits us there's
[37:57] problems to solve there's children to
[37:58] raise there's depth to overcome
[38:00] and we're all coming together because we
[38:02] want to overcome
[38:04] can i tell a story about ritos
[38:07] when i first discovered rito's i am i am
[38:10] the one the first one to discover it
[38:13] it's in my resume i didn't invent ritos
[38:17] i discovered it
[38:20] and i remember having not been a drug
[38:22] addict
[38:23] ever the closest that i could relate to
[38:26] a drug addict
[38:27] is my visits to ritos
[38:30] because you'd have cash in hand and
[38:33] you'd stand
[38:34] outside of a house at 14th and
[38:38] roosevelt and there'd be bars on the
[38:42] windows and doors
[38:44] and you'd be in line with a bunch of
[38:46] other people who have a handful of cash
[38:48] and you're all sitting there kind of
[38:49] going
[38:52] man don't they usually open at 10
[38:56] and you all kind of look at each other
[38:57] knowingly like i know why you're here
[39:00] you ain't fooling anybody you're not
[39:01] here to get them to sign up for
[39:03] buy some encyclopedias you're here for a
[39:06] burrito
[39:08] and everybody's there for the green
[39:09] chili and that was the only way i could
[39:10] relate i used to think at one point
[39:12] they're putting nicotine in the beans
[39:13] and cracking the burrito
[39:15] because you craved it so much you wanted
[39:17] it so much
[39:18] and this is what happens you ought to
[39:20] have the kind of attitude that when we
[39:21] all show up to church
[39:22] i know why you're here you're not here
[39:25] to be seen and you're not here just to
[39:27] see somebody else
[39:28] you're here because it's life or death
[39:30] you're eating because you need the word
[39:31] you've made the decision
[39:33] to forsake the world you've made the
[39:34] decision to not listen to the nonsense
[39:36] of the lord you've sacrificed friendship
[39:38] and family
[39:39] you've persevered you've stayed the
[39:41] course you've continued in this message
[39:43] in this word
[39:43] not because it was fun playing church
[39:46] but you did it because you knew there
[39:47] was a purpose in it
[39:51] you meet some people and say hey well
[39:52] why don't you why don't you eat this
[39:54] and why don't you eat that i'm allergic
[39:56] to it well come on just try it just eat
[39:58] the shrimp it's not going to kill you're
[40:00] like no
[40:01] that's exactly what it's going to do
[40:03] it's going to kill me
[40:04] and we should should have the kind of
[40:06] attitude like we have an allergy against
[40:08] anything that's not the word and if i
[40:10] eat it it can kill me
[40:11] and have these strict protocols or keep
[40:13] it out keep it out keep it clean
[40:15] why because god has a plan and he's
[40:18] given us the word in this hour
[40:19] to satisfy them and the message god of
[40:22] this evil age and brother bram says and
[40:24] the word
[40:25] was from the beginning god's plan but
[40:28] god revealed by revelation the very
[40:29] thing that he vindicated and punctuated
[40:31] that that was right
[40:33] not religion not an altered not
[40:35] belonging to church not making a
[40:36] sacrifice not being sincere
[40:38] man strike one strike two strike three
[40:42] strike four strike five
[40:44] not religion not an altar not belonging
[40:46] to church not making a sacrifice not
[40:47] even being sincere no none of that's
[40:49] gonna work
[40:49] but by the revelation of the word of god
[40:52] how that we
[40:53] how are we to live how are we to bring a
[40:55] sacrifice how are we come to
[40:57] should we come to church by revelation
[40:58] of the word of god it's got to be the
[41:00] word first it's got to be the word
[41:02] that's the energy in
[41:03] otherwise we're not depleting energy
[41:05] properly we're never going to live
[41:07] spiritually healthy
[41:09] cain brought a sacrifice that was very
[41:11] beautiful from the fruit of the ground
[41:12] and it was something
[41:13] that that would have been an offering to
[41:15] god but it had to be
[41:17] by revelation that was god's requirement
[41:19] and that's the same plan today the word
[41:21] was from the beginning god's plan
[41:24] and not just sincerity not just
[41:25] sacrifice not belonging to church
[41:27] not coming to the altar not religion but
[41:29] you've got to have a revelation of the
[41:31] word of god
[41:32] that's what feeds the soul
[41:37] in matthew chapter 6
[41:42] he's teaching them how to pray so it's
[41:45] often referred to as the lord's prayer
[41:48] we know it's not the lord's prayer per
[41:50] se but it's the lord teaching us how to
[41:52] pray
[41:53] and let me say this is a powerful prayer
[41:58] may not be very long may be very easy to
[41:59] remember but there's all sorts of
[42:02] mysteries and prophecies and revelations
[42:04] and depth
[42:04] to this prayer we're first acknowledging
[42:08] god and asking that his kingdom come
[42:10] that his will be done and then once
[42:13] we've established this as a basis
[42:16] it comes to what we could say would be
[42:18] the primary need of an individual
[42:20] on a daily basis and and the struggle of
[42:24] human existence
[42:26] and and the the necessity to survive
[42:29] matthew 6 11 give us this day our daily
[42:32] bread
[42:34] and it says give us this day our
[42:38] daily bread and the phrase daily bread
[42:41] it speaks the bread of our necessity
[42:44] the bread we need it is not give us this
[42:47] day our foot long boston cream from
[42:49] claim jumpers it's give us this day
[42:52] our daily bread because bread speaks of
[42:55] all the necessities of life
[42:57] bread speaks of not only all the
[42:58] necessities of life but all that is
[43:00] needed to support life
[43:02] this is what ought to be properly viewed
[43:04] when you say give us
[43:05] this day our daily bread it's speaking
[43:08] of the necessities of life
[43:09] and what you need to support life so
[43:11] this is a request that's saying
[43:13] i have need i don't have what i need
[43:17] i i have this need in my life and what i
[43:20] need the need needs to be met by
[43:21] something that you have and i want you
[43:22] to give it to me it must come by your
[43:24] hand
[43:24] and so there's a necessity of life that
[43:26] needs to be satisfied
[43:28] he says give us this day our
[43:33] it's called our daily bread because we
[43:35] need it and we can't live without it
[43:38] not that we would necessarily have a
[43:40] right to it and some claim on it but we
[43:41] call it our daily bread because we need
[43:43] it and we know that we cannot live
[43:44] without it
[43:46] and if we were to look at this in the
[43:47] sense that give us this day our daily
[43:49] bread speaks to
[43:50] and clearly clearly we could use it to
[43:52] speak to the fact that
[43:53] we ask him to provide by his hand and by
[43:56] his goodness and the opportunities he
[43:57] gives us
[43:58] the the food to place upon our table to
[44:00] feed our bellies and feed our family and
[44:02] to raise our kids and so there's a
[44:03] natural bread
[44:05] and substance that we we acknowledge we
[44:07] turn thanks we say thank you god for
[44:09] this food
[44:09] we give him thanks for all these things
[44:11] for we know it came by his hand
[44:13] and if we took the scripture and said
[44:14] that give us this day our daily bread
[44:16] is a petition for the needs of the body
[44:20] it is unquestionably pointing to a
[44:22] higher need
[44:24] there's no doubt that it's pointing to a
[44:25] higher petition we say oh this is
[44:28] pleading with god to give us bread that
[44:30] it may satisfy natural life
[44:31] but then if that's the case it is
[44:33] actually still yet pointing to
[44:35] a higher request and a higher desire
[44:37] that he would give us what we need to
[44:39] feed our souls
[44:42] in psalms 104 and also psalms 145
[44:45] verse 15 it's talking about all of
[44:49] creation
[44:50] it's very very beautiful phrase that's
[44:52] used here and and it says
[44:54] the eyes of all that wait upon thee
[44:58] and thou give us them their meat in due
[45:01] season
[45:02] all of you all of all of creation
[45:06] is looking to god to give them what they
[45:09] need to eat
[45:11] and as you read the psalms and you read
[45:13] the the the context of this statement
[45:15] all
[45:15] eyes wait upon thee and thou give us
[45:18] them their meat and due season
[45:19] god gives food that's suited for each
[45:21] beast for each creature for each animal
[45:23] and then he also gives them food not
[45:25] just for each beast and each creature
[45:27] and all animal but for all stages of
[45:29] life for each beast each creature and
[45:32] each animal
[45:34] it's not just feeding sheep but it's
[45:36] also feeding lambs
[45:37] it's not just feeding the mature but
[45:40] it's feeding the babes it's food suited
[45:41] for each animal but also for every area
[45:43] of your life
[45:44] all of creation looks to god to give
[45:46] them and this is the phrase that we
[45:48] hear often spiritual food and due season
[45:50] to give us
[45:51] meat in due season and this scripture is
[45:54] talking about life
[45:55] depending upon food at a proper time in
[45:58] a proper season
[46:00] give us this day our daily bread all
[46:02] eyes look to the
[46:03] you to get their meat in due season it
[46:06] speaks of
[46:06] everything that is living depending upon
[46:09] god to give them food
[46:11] at a proper time and food that is proper
[46:14] in that time and in the right season in
[46:17] order to live
[46:19] give us this day our daily bread is give
[46:21] us give us bread day
[46:23] by day by day by day
[46:28] and brother branham says in the message
[46:30] turn on the light
[46:33] this is this is some good stuff
[46:38] he says so should the church bring forth
[46:40] the bread of each age
[46:43] the bride's got to bring forth the bread
[46:45] of the bright age
[46:46] the church must bring forth the bread of
[46:48] each age that jesus
[46:50] jesus commanded that man shall not live
[46:52] by every word
[46:53] man shall live by every word that
[46:55] proceeds out of the mouth of god
[46:58] so this is how man ought to live by
[46:59] every word that proceeds from his mouth
[47:01] he says the church should bring forth
[47:02] the bread of each age
[47:04] that's what we're going to live by the
[47:06] bread that is brought forth he says in
[47:07] the rapture message that the shout is
[47:09] the living bread of life
[47:11] bringing forth the bride you see that
[47:13] the bread brings forth the bride the
[47:15] bride feeds on that bread and then the
[47:17] bride
[47:17] lives the substance of that bread and
[47:19] she has bread and life to give to those
[47:22] who need it so the church must bring
[47:24] forth the bread of each age
[47:25] because man has to live by the bread of
[47:27] god and then he says
[47:29] the bread that we need is the bible
[47:32] and not another translation not another
[47:35] interpretation
[47:36] not a different kind of leather not a an
[47:39] elect
[47:39] a an e bible or or some other form of
[47:43] the bible he says
[47:44] it is the complete revelation of god's
[47:46] plan
[47:48] it is the complete revelation of jesus
[47:50] christ so god
[47:52] man tries to get us to some kind of
[47:54] sensible plan something easier
[47:56] something other than what god laid down
[47:58] this bible
[48:00] is what god gave us to feed on you say
[48:02] well just this bible
[48:03] it's prophecies and the fulfillments of
[48:05] it
[48:07] that if the bible speaks of something
[48:09] and it comes to pass
[48:10] and the word is being brought to pass
[48:12] and and the things that pertain to this
[48:14] bible are coming to life
[48:16] then it's giving us food that we have
[48:17] need of in the time that we're living in
[48:22] even this act of coming and hearing the
[48:24] word preached that's the bible in action
[48:27] this is what we live by this is what we
[48:29] must have and this bible it's the
[48:31] complete revelation of god's plan it's
[48:32] the complete revelation of jesus christ
[48:34] and listen we're living in a time when
[48:37] the full word has been made available to
[48:38] the believer
[48:41] he says we add nothing to it or take
[48:43] anything from it if you do what happens
[48:45] it's not going to give you it's not
[48:46] going to give you the strength you need
[48:48] you're going to create the wrong kind of
[48:49] appetite
[48:50] whosoever does his name shall be taken
[48:52] on the book of life we don't need any
[48:54] creeds to add to this
[48:57] this message this bible became a new
[48:59] book when the word was opened
[49:01] so this bible is god's plan this word is
[49:04] god's plan
[49:04] this word is god's nutritional plan for
[49:06] the believer this word is god
[49:08] is the bride's feast you want to call it
[49:10] a diet that's fine but sometimes it
[49:12] scares us who like to eat
[49:13] it's the bride's feast
[49:18] this message is the bread of this day
[49:20] day by day
[49:22] it's our fresh manna as god poured out
[49:24] manna from heaven every day
[49:26] fresh in the morning upon the dew and
[49:28] this was bread that they ate in the
[49:29] exodus that's clearly a type how that
[49:31] there was bread that came every morning
[49:33] and it fed them in the exes that's the
[49:35] type how that god will give us the bread
[49:37] that we need day by day by day by day
[49:39] from the word of god
[49:45] let me let me just read a few scriptures
[49:48] that we read last time
[49:50] laodicea is ending in chaos descending
[49:53] into chaos
[49:54] in the preview of the bride here they go
[49:56] just falling right down
[49:58] into chaos and as their the church world
[50:00] is going down into chaos
[50:01] there's a different procession taking
[50:03] place and the bride is sending up
[50:06] and so the the announcement in
[50:08] revelations chapter 4
[50:09] is to the bride to come up higher it's
[50:12] connected with this voice in revelations
[50:14] 3
[50:14] 20. so as the world is in chaos
[50:17] and they're in there they're sick and
[50:19] they're unhealthy and they don't think
[50:20] they need to change
[50:22] god gives us the the diagnosis and then
[50:25] he gives a prescription for this
[50:27] laodicean condition
[50:28] it's christ who stands at the door
[50:30] knocking
[50:31] and he says if you'll hear his voice
[50:33] that's what you've got to hear not the
[50:34] knocking you've got to hear his voice
[50:37] there elijah in the cave and what
[50:39] happened the lord passed by
[50:41] and there was an earthquake there was
[50:42] wind and there was fire but what what
[50:44] what did the scripture teach us god
[50:47] wasn't in those
[50:50] though that were it was evidence of his
[50:52] presence and there was something that
[50:53] was taking
[50:54] place earthquake he caused an earthquake
[50:55] he causes fire he causes wind
[50:57] so here elijah recognizes something is
[50:59] happening this seems significant there's
[51:01] a lot of commotion
[51:02] but god wasn't in those three things
[51:04] he's not in the knocking
[51:05] it was in the still small voice that's
[51:07] where eliza elijah heard
[51:09] the voice of god and that's what he was
[51:12] waiting to hear because that's the only
[51:13] thing that could motivate and satisfy
[51:15] not just a bunch of commotion and lots
[51:16] of fire lots of wind a lot of earthquake
[51:18] a lot of shaking
[51:19] i need to hear the voice that's what's
[51:22] going to feed me that's what's going to
[51:23] inspire me that's what's going to get me
[51:24] going
[51:28] behold i stand at the door knock if any
[51:30] man hear my voice
[51:31] and open the door and this is what takes
[51:34] place
[51:35] i will come into him at that day
[51:39] it's i in you and you and me i will come
[51:41] into him
[51:42] and will sup with him and he with me
[51:46] god's answer to the dark laodicean
[51:48] condition the most ridiculous
[51:49] age the age that has rejected jesus
[51:52] christ he's a fugitive in his own church
[51:54] what's his how do we how do we solve
[51:55] this do we fix lao to see it no let's
[51:57] just come out of it
[51:58] and he calls the bride to a spiritual
[52:01] feast
[52:02] he types the answer the answer we have
[52:06] and let me say it this way so the point
[52:08] is made
[52:09] the answer to whatever condition that
[52:12] laodicea wants to put on you
[52:14] the answer to whatever battle whatever
[52:16] fight
[52:17] and whatever enigma you may be facing as
[52:19] a result of the laodicean condition that
[52:21] we see around us
[52:22] the answer is feasting with him
[52:26] the answer is christ the answer is
[52:28] interacting with the word the answer
[52:30] is approaching the word the right way
[52:32] and getting out of the word what you
[52:33] need
[52:34] to defend against all the nonsense
[52:35] that's in the world and to get the
[52:36] energy you need to fly above all the
[52:38] nonsense of the world
[52:39] that's in the word the suffering that it
[52:42] refers to here
[52:43] i will come into him and sup with him
[52:44] and you will sup with
[52:46] him there's a spiritual feast then that
[52:48] this message invites you to
[52:51] before the wedding supper in the sky
[52:53] you're eating here first
[52:56] there's a feast that's taking place here
[52:57] there's a spiritual feast here
[52:59] and it's actually the feeding here and
[53:01] the things you get here
[53:02] that's going to translate you to go to
[53:04] the wedding supper in the sky so listen
[53:06] don't hold back now say
[53:07] no i'm i'm saving myself for the wedding
[53:09] supper you ain't going to get there
[53:11] eat up roll up your sleeves put a
[53:14] spiritual bib on don't worry if it gets
[53:16] messy
[53:17] eat eat eat fill yourself with this
[53:20] because if you don't you won't make it
[53:21] there you know sometimes people make a
[53:24] big mistake this is just my opinion
[53:26] you've heard the beep there's a
[53:27] disclaimer that's scrolling across the
[53:28] bottom
[53:29] they say oh we're gonna go over to
[53:31] so-and-so's house or thanksgiving and
[53:32] what do you do you starve yourself for a
[53:33] couple days leading up to thanksgiving
[53:36] you're never gonna be able to eat as
[53:37] much as you want
[53:39] if you starve yourself your stomach
[53:42] shrinks
[53:43] you lose your appetite and so you're
[53:45] actually in a good spot to eat healthy
[53:47] on thanksgiving right because you
[53:48] finally shrunk it down you haven't been
[53:50] eating anything
[53:51] and you eat and you get full real fast
[53:53] oh man i'm surprised i got so full so
[53:55] fast
[53:56] you know what you need to do you need to
[53:57] pre-gain for 72 hours
[54:00] you need to be drinking a lot of water
[54:03] eat a lot of
[54:04] foods to fill that belly up get it
[54:05] really distended you know make sure
[54:07] you're in a position that by the time
[54:09] you get to eat
[54:10] you've got a belly that's really big but
[54:12] empty and you can eat as much as you
[54:14] want
[54:15] we ought to be spiritual confetti
[54:16] competitive food eaters in a sense
[54:18] he was like hey god's given me seven
[54:20] seals give me a law
[54:23] oh i'm just gonna enjoy the second seal
[54:26] in the second seal so good i think
[54:28] that's enough i've had enough
[54:30] get in there eat it there's a feast
[54:33] that's poured out before you
[54:35] and you better be eaten here you'll
[54:37] never get there
[54:39] and what is it that takes place is it it
[54:41] this is the the door that opens up
[54:43] there's a spiritual
[54:44] uh john is called up high in revelations
[54:47] 4
[54:47] and then we see this beautiful scene
[54:49] which is prophet prophecy to the
[54:50] gentiles in revelation chapter 10.
[54:53] and in revelations chapter 10 the mighty
[54:55] angel comes down with the book that was
[54:57] sealed in revelations 5. it's now
[54:59] open in revelations 10. and in the
[55:01] breach brother branham
[55:03] before the seals are preached and before
[55:04] they're fully coming open as he
[55:06] expresses them
[55:07] he's using the breach in revelations
[55:09] chapter 10 is the context for these
[55:11] seals becoming open
[55:12] and he's probing with different things
[55:14] and he's adding these things in there
[55:16] but he's definitely facing this reality
[55:19] that these mysteries are opened up and
[55:21] they're given to the seventh angel to
[55:22] give to the people
[55:24] and the seventh angel is on earth at the
[55:27] time that the mighty angel comes down
[55:29] out of heaven
[55:29] with the book open and then this mighty
[55:32] angel
[55:33] comes down and gives this book to the
[55:34] seventh angel and
[55:36] this is what's literally happened in our
[55:38] day the revelation that came to the
[55:39] messenger is now given out to the bride
[55:42] and the bride now has opportunity to
[55:44] feast on the same revelation
[55:46] and to be spiritually eaten in these
[55:48] things so in the days of the voice when
[55:50] he shall begin to sound the mystery of
[55:52] god is finished
[55:53] and then what takes place is now i hear
[55:55] another voice that tells me to go to the
[55:57] angel
[55:58] and ask for the book and in verse 9 so i
[56:01] go to the angel and i tell him
[56:02] give me the little book but now that you
[56:05] have opened the door
[56:07] and he has come into you and you to him
[56:09] now
[56:10] he will sup with you or feast with you
[56:13] or
[56:13] eat with you so it's not just give me
[56:15] the book and we're all going to sit
[56:17] around and talk about the book and talk
[56:18] about the message
[56:19] he says no now this is christ with the
[56:22] further revelation
[56:23] take the book and eat it up
[56:28] eat it up eat it all
[56:32] every bit of it this message brings us
[56:34] to a spiritual feast with christ
[56:38] now just to wrap up and finish up this
[56:40] eating to live part
[56:41] i think i've said enough there and that
[56:44] segment
[56:45] to for you to understand what it is i
[56:49] i'm burdened with
[56:51] we have a message that we should be
[56:52] feeding on we have truths that have been
[56:54] brought to pass in this hour
[56:55] that we can feed on take the book eat it
[56:58] up
[57:00] then he says he takes the book and he
[57:01] says listen when you eat it this is
[57:02] what's going to happen
[57:04] so john takes it eats it is exactly what
[57:05] happens so now
[57:07] the in the process of eating the book
[57:09] and when you take something and you eat
[57:11] it your body processes it
[57:14] and and so there's certain ways that it
[57:15] impacts you uh there's
[57:18] you know they there's a thought and
[57:21] there's even even some science behind it
[57:23] that
[57:24] if you if you eat the toenail of a pig
[57:26] it's going to strengthen your toenails
[57:27] right
[57:28] grind it up in powder put in your jello
[57:30] oh they do that with the thyroid of a
[57:32] pig
[57:32] you take a thyroid pill and it's
[57:33] supposed to strengthen your thyroid you
[57:35] can eat bone broth and what's it
[57:36] supposed to do
[57:37] strengthen your bones you eat the skin
[57:38] of chicken it's supposed to make your
[57:40] skin glowing
[57:41] that's why we all have glowing skin in
[57:42] here because we do skin on chicken
[57:45] and what they're saying is this that the
[57:46] one feeds the other and strengthens the
[57:48] other
[57:49] and so your body processes it and then
[57:51] it distributes the nutrients and the
[57:53] strength and the
[57:54] and and the health to those parts of the
[57:57] body
[57:58] now if you just take that say that's
[57:59] that's some symbol or some analogy
[58:02] or some type now think then what this
[58:04] word is supposed to do
[58:06] it is going to materialize the word body
[58:08] around you
[58:10] it's going to produce the word in your
[58:11] life and so it says
[58:13] in revelation chapter 10 verse 11 after
[58:15] he's taken the book and eaten it
[58:17] there's a consequence for eating this
[58:19] book
[58:20] there's a process that takes place when
[58:22] you eat it verse 11 and he said unto me
[58:24] thou must prophesy again before many
[58:27] peoples and nations and tongues and
[58:29] kings
[58:30] thou must prophesy again this is not
[58:33] just you eating and
[58:35] and enjoyed it and sitting back wow that
[58:37] was really good
[58:38] but this is you now declaring the
[58:40] contents of the book
[58:42] this is you now living out in flesh the
[58:44] contents of that book
[58:46] you receive a revelation in secret you
[58:48] are feasting seemingly in secret
[58:50] but then your life becomes the public
[58:52] distribution
[58:53] and manifestation of all the health and
[58:55] all the life and all the nutrients
[58:57] of what was in that book we must
[59:00] manifest and prophesy again
[59:03] brother brown says the word itself made
[59:05] flesh in you you
[59:06] are a reflection of this hour give us
[59:10] this day our daily bread if you're
[59:11] eating your bread for this day
[59:14] then you become the reflection of this
[59:16] day's bread
[59:18] you're a reflection of this hour the
[59:19] message reflection of it he says
[59:21] you live again you live the life that
[59:24] was in jesus christ
[59:26] what is prophesy again live again
[59:30] you live again you live this word again
[59:32] however it looked that in the days of
[59:34] christ
[59:34] as the word was being made flesh then we
[59:36] live it again now
[59:42] this is a statement familiar with us
[59:47] god's intention for his creation man is
[59:49] to express his word so god intends us to
[59:51] express his words
[59:54] now how are you going to express his
[59:56] word
[59:57] unless you're eating his word
[1:00:01] how are you going to express it unless
[1:00:02] you're eating it john was not told to
[1:00:05] prophesy again and then when you get
[1:00:06] hungry go eat the book
[1:00:08] he had to eat it first before he could
[1:00:10] live it
[1:00:12] he had to eat it first before he could
[1:00:14] speak it
[1:00:16] the word itself made flesh in him you
[1:00:19] your reflection of this hour you live
[1:00:20] again so god's intention for creation
[1:00:23] is to express his words in genesis adam
[1:00:25] was given the word to live by
[1:00:27] the word to live by it's like bread this
[1:00:30] is what i live by this is substance this
[1:00:32] is strength this is life
[1:00:33] he says a life lived by the word would
[1:00:36] be the word expressed
[1:00:38] i think there's a phrase you are what
[1:00:40] you eat well this is how we could use it
[1:00:41] in this context
[1:00:42] i'm eating the word therefore i am the
[1:00:45] word expressed
[1:00:47] i'm eating the book therefore i am the
[1:00:49] book expressed
[1:00:51] i'm eating christ therefore i am christ
[1:00:53] expressed oh you're pulling me right
[1:00:55] into just the whole vast
[1:00:56] uh uh array of what god says in the word
[1:00:59] of god why is it
[1:01:00] that we are becoming one body because
[1:01:02] we're all eating one bread
[1:01:05] how can we become one body and have one
[1:01:08] voice if we're not all eating of the
[1:01:10] same body word and feed it on christ and
[1:01:12] it's
[1:01:13] been assimilated in our character and we
[1:01:15] become this marching army
[1:01:18] life lived by the word would be the word
[1:01:20] expressed in other words
[1:01:21] eating to live bill abraham says in the
[1:01:25] laodicean church age there will not be
[1:01:26] one person who will sit in the throne of
[1:01:28] the lord jesus christ
[1:01:30] unless he has been living that word
[1:01:34] what did we read earlier about how
[1:01:35] brother branham said it's not religion
[1:01:37] not an altar not belonging to church not
[1:01:38] making a sacrifice
[1:01:39] not being sincere but a revelation of
[1:01:42] the word of god
[1:01:44] he says your prayers your fastings your
[1:01:45] repentances
[1:01:47] no matter what you present to god none
[1:01:49] of that will gain you the privilege of
[1:01:51] sitting in that throne
[1:01:53] it will be granted only to the word
[1:01:56] bride so i have not
[1:02:00] i am not approaching church
[1:02:03] i'm not approaching prayer i'm not
[1:02:05] approaching fasting i'm not approaching
[1:02:07] repentances
[1:02:08] i'm not reproaching approaching any of
[1:02:09] these other things
[1:02:11] so that it'll somehow earn me the
[1:02:14] opportunity to sit in the throne
[1:02:16] but i'm doing it because that's my
[1:02:18] destiny
[1:02:22] i'm doing it because it's where i know
[1:02:24] that god is leading me i'm doing it
[1:02:25] because i know
[1:02:26] that this is what god has for me i'm
[1:02:29] eating these things
[1:02:30] because these things are going to be
[1:02:32] leading me somewhere i'm eating these
[1:02:34] things because i know that god has a
[1:02:36] that i'm part of a process i'm part of a
[1:02:38] plan there's something that's taking
[1:02:40] place
[1:02:41] in my life i've got to be feeding on
[1:02:43] this and i'm feeding on this because
[1:02:45] not because i want to become the word
[1:02:46] bride but because i am the word of right
[1:02:49] word bride i'm feeding on the word of
[1:02:50] god
[1:02:55] i was fellowshipping with a real dear
[1:02:58] friend of mine his father passed away a
[1:03:02] couple years ago
[1:03:04] and and then another friend a close
[1:03:06] family friend had passed away and were
[1:03:08] fellowshipping this past week and he's
[1:03:09] just in a
[1:03:10] transition time in his life and i could
[1:03:12] tell he was really really heavy and
[1:03:14] after being on the phone with them for a
[1:03:15] while i kind of felt like man i just
[1:03:17] got off the phone and i was encouraged
[1:03:18] but i felt like i didn't really have
[1:03:20] much
[1:03:20] uh to say to him i in the phone call and
[1:03:23] just something overwhelming i wanted to
[1:03:25] express it to him and i just
[1:03:27] and i i reached out to him and i told
[1:03:30] him i said you know
[1:03:31] not everything you're experiencing in
[1:03:33] going through
[1:03:34] is because of loss
[1:03:38] and because of the uncertainty of life
[1:03:40] not everything you're going through is
[1:03:41] because
[1:03:42] you've lost something not everything
[1:03:44] you're going through is because of the
[1:03:45] uncertainties of the the age that we're
[1:03:47] living in
[1:03:49] but oftentimes we feel empty or we feel
[1:03:51] hungry feel
[1:03:52] lonely because what our destiny is
[1:03:55] i don't feel this way because i'm really
[1:03:57] going through it i don't feel this way
[1:03:59] because
[1:03:59] because i've lost something i don't feel
[1:04:01] this way because something's wrong
[1:04:03] i feel this way because what i'm called
[1:04:05] to
[1:04:07] i feel this way because of my destiny
[1:04:09] and i if i didn't feel this way then i i
[1:04:12] wouldn't be coming to it i feel this way
[1:04:14] because i'm going to come to it
[1:04:15] i feel this way because i know that this
[1:04:17] word is go is mine it's my right
[1:04:19] i feel this way to eat this way because
[1:04:22] i know the throne is mine
[1:04:24] i'm eating because yes there's a longing
[1:04:26] there's an emptiness and there's a
[1:04:27] desire but not because of loss not
[1:04:29] because of sin not because of some
[1:04:30] mistake
[1:04:31] but because of what i'm called to
[1:04:34] that's why i'm hungry
[1:04:38] so it will not be granted to those who
[1:04:40] are
[1:04:41] doing a bunch of things that are
[1:04:42] religious but it will be granted to
[1:04:44] those that are living the word
[1:04:46] and if you're going to be living the
[1:04:47] words you've got to be eating the word
[1:04:49] it'll be granted to the word bride
[1:04:51] brother branham says in the message
[1:04:52] perfect faith
[1:04:53] you become the word as you receive the
[1:04:57] word
[1:04:59] how we the word bride how are the word
[1:05:00] by nodding and saying yes to the word no
[1:05:02] no by receiving
[1:05:04] the word we become the word bride we
[1:05:08] become the word bride because we receive
[1:05:10] the word and in taking that word
[1:05:14] we're becoming the manifestation of that
[1:05:16] word
[1:05:17] but mike if you could come i'd like to
[1:05:20] close
[1:05:26] you become the word as you receive the
[1:05:27] word
[1:05:30] bill branham in the church age book
[1:05:32] chapter five when he's writing out
[1:05:33] what god spoke was speaking or if
[1:05:37] this phrase here rather is him
[1:05:40] uh expressing what god is saying to the
[1:05:42] age i
[1:05:44] am the word this is god speaking
[1:05:47] if you want deity in your midst then
[1:05:49] welcome and receive the word
[1:05:53] if you want the word then welcome and
[1:05:55] receive it if you want god in your home
[1:05:57] you want god in your life you want god
[1:05:58] in your situation then welcome and
[1:06:00] receive him into it make can welcome if
[1:06:03] you want deity in your midst then
[1:06:04] welcome and receive the word
[1:06:08] this is not receiving a picture of the
[1:06:09] hoffman's head of christ
[1:06:12] this is not receiving a rosary this is
[1:06:13] not doing any kind of religion
[1:06:15] this is welcoming and receiving the word
[1:06:17] you want deity in your midst then
[1:06:19] receive the word
[1:06:20] you become the word as you receive the
[1:06:21] word the throne is only gonna be granted
[1:06:23] to a word bride
[1:06:24] only granted to those who are living the
[1:06:25] word a life lived by the word would be
[1:06:27] the word express
[1:06:28] here's the process receive the word
[1:06:30] receive the word receive the word
[1:06:32] be the word live the word
[1:06:35] become the word so if you want the word
[1:06:39] you want god in your midst then welcome
[1:06:41] and receive the word and then he says
[1:06:42] don't
[1:06:43] ever this is god speaking don't ever let
[1:06:45] anyone or anything get between you and
[1:06:46] that word
[1:06:47] this which i am giving you the word is a
[1:06:50] revelation of myself
[1:06:51] i am the word remember that
[1:06:55] i am the word remember that
[1:07:02] and then listen to this statement
[1:07:05] i wonder if we are sufficiently
[1:07:09] impressed
[1:07:10] with the word in our midst
[1:07:17] something could take place and we could
[1:07:18] say impressive
[1:07:22] so an opportunity can be presented to us
[1:07:24] like well that's
[1:07:25] i'm impressed and there's a lot of
[1:07:29] things
[1:07:29] that we could respond to and say yeah
[1:07:32] that left an impression i was impressed
[1:07:34] but brother brown does not just say i
[1:07:36] wonder if we're impressed
[1:07:37] by the message there's a lot of people
[1:07:40] that are impressed with it
[1:07:42] a lot of people but the message has a
[1:07:45] purpose
[1:07:46] so it's not just merely are you
[1:07:47] impressed with it are you
[1:07:49] sufficiently impressed
[1:07:53] and i believe that we must have the
[1:07:55] attitude
[1:07:56] to where we say god sufficiently impress
[1:07:59] me press yourself lord
[1:08:03] i welcome and receive the word
[1:08:07] that it may be pressed into me
[1:08:10] that i might become one with it
[1:08:14] i want to be sufficiently impressed i
[1:08:16] don't want to just be
[1:08:17] impressed with its vindications
[1:08:19] impressed with its doctrines
[1:08:20] impressed with certain things about it i
[1:08:23] want to be sufficiently
[1:08:24] impressed in other words i want the word
[1:08:26] to be so welcomed and received
[1:08:28] to where it fulfills its purpose in my
[1:08:30] life
[1:08:31] sufficiently impressed enough to meet
[1:08:34] its purpose
[1:08:35] enough to do what it's supposed to do
[1:08:38] and and to welcome and receive it so
[1:08:40] that he
[1:08:41] is not just acknowledged
[1:08:45] but he's he has preeminence
[1:08:49] this is what i mean by eating to live
[1:08:54] that when i sit down to eat i'm
[1:08:56] sufficiently impressed with the
[1:08:57] opportunity i have before me
[1:09:00] i'm sufficiently impressed that
[1:09:03] my coming to church is not
[1:09:07] just another opportunity to say i've
[1:09:09] gone to church
[1:09:11] but it's an opportunity to feast at his
[1:09:12] table
[1:09:14] when i pray it's an opportunity to for a
[1:09:16] face-to-face
[1:09:18] conversation with god when i read my
[1:09:21] bible i'm looking him
[1:09:23] face to face when i listen to the voice
[1:09:25] of go listen to the message of the hour
[1:09:27] i'm hearing god's
[1:09:28] messenger i'm hearing the voice of god
[1:09:30] coming through to me
[1:09:32] and i i'm recalibrating my expectations
[1:09:35] i'm recalibrating my assessments and my
[1:09:37] judgments
[1:09:38] i'm rearranging my balance sheet to get
[1:09:40] it back in order to realize no
[1:09:41] these things are valuable these things
[1:09:43] are important lord
[1:09:45] let me be sufficiently impressed with
[1:09:47] your word
[1:09:48] for now i'm not just doing it because of
[1:09:51] religion
[1:09:53] i'm not just doing it in the sense
[1:09:55] because i need i i want to feel a
[1:09:57] certain way and i want to
[1:09:58] uh i'm not just driven by religious duty
[1:10:01] i'm not just
[1:10:02] driven by what is required of a message
[1:10:05] believer
[1:10:05] but i'm driven for life i'm sufficiently
[1:10:09] impressed to say
[1:10:10] give me this day my daily bread this
[1:10:12] isn't a supplement
[1:10:15] let me just say this if you're getting
[1:10:17] what you need you wouldn't need to
[1:10:19] supplement
[1:10:24] this message has it this message has
[1:10:27] what we need
[1:10:31] well brother aaron should we read
[1:10:32] anything outside of it i'm not saying
[1:10:34] that
[1:10:35] if you're eating it's going to give you
[1:10:37] the right kind of appetite to get what
[1:10:38] you need out of other things
[1:10:41] some people don't realize they're
[1:10:42] starving and that's why they're
[1:10:44] supplementing
[1:10:44] they're not doing it because they're
[1:10:45] healthy they're doing it because they're
[1:10:47] unhealthy
[1:10:48] let it not be said of us that we're just
[1:10:50] reaching out craving trying to find
[1:10:52] something
[1:10:52] that'll satisfy something to give us
[1:10:54] faith something to encourage us
[1:10:56] because we've lost our spiritual
[1:10:57] receptors and we're trying to find
[1:10:59] something to satisfy and placate this
[1:11:01] hunger
[1:11:01] let's start eating healthy and break the
[1:11:04] wrong kind of cravings
[1:11:05] find the right kind of table to sit at
[1:11:07] begin to feed upon the pure word of god
[1:11:09] again
[1:11:10] feed on it as we feed on it then we
[1:11:12] start to get the right kind of nutrients
[1:11:14] we need from the meals that we're taking
[1:11:16] and i don't need a supplement i'm
[1:11:18] getting all the vitamins i need from the
[1:11:20] word of god
[1:11:22] god bless you let's stand
[1:11:36] let's take the word brother bram says
[1:11:38] feel your heart and mouth
[1:11:40] with him let's do that let's purpose in
[1:11:43] our hearts as a church to listen to more
[1:11:46] of in our own personal devotion
[1:11:50] to listen to the message of the hour to
[1:11:52] talk about it when we're with one
[1:11:53] another
[1:11:56] to spiritually feast on the right things
[1:11:58] and then personally fellowship around
[1:11:59] these things
[1:12:01] to promote the presence of christ to
[1:12:04] promote healing
[1:12:06] so that we can live live the
[1:12:10] live the right kind of life so that we
[1:12:12] can be living the word
[1:12:14] it's not my desire to to express that so
[1:12:17] that we can become a better church
[1:12:20] so that you individually can live
[1:12:23] a life closer to god that's what's
[1:12:25] important
[1:12:26] the closer you walk with god the more
[1:12:28] you overcome monday
[1:12:30] monday to saturday the more that you're
[1:12:31] in fellowship is what's going to make
[1:12:33] church even better it doesn't make we
[1:12:36] don't need to get a better church to
[1:12:37] make you better you just need to be
[1:12:39] fed and spiritually healthy and alive
[1:12:41] and that's what's going to make things
[1:12:42] better
[1:12:44] that's our desire gracious heavenly
[1:12:45] father tonight as we close this service
[1:12:48] we thank you for the opportunity
[1:12:50] we've had to be here we thank you lord
[1:12:53] for the sacrifices that are made to
[1:12:54] provide this facility
[1:12:56] we thank you lord that we were able to
[1:12:59] have this service despite the pressures
[1:13:01] and things that were
[1:13:03] pushing in against us but i'm very proud
[1:13:06] of this congregation
[1:13:07] all the members of it that support and
[1:13:12] pray and communicate and do all the
[1:13:15] things that they're doing
[1:13:16] as we fellowship together and are making
[1:13:19] great sacrifices lord to produc
[1:13:21] conduct ourselves in a church service in
[1:13:24] a setting that's not customary or not
[1:13:26] typical
[1:13:27] [Music]
[1:13:28] but i believe it speaks to a desire in
[1:13:31] the people's hearts
[1:13:33] to fellowship around the right things to
[1:13:35] be in your presence
[1:13:36] and to feast at your table a lord of
[1:13:39] sacrifices have been made not only to
[1:13:41] stream and to hear the word
[1:13:44] over the internet but lord to be here
[1:13:45] present now and to hear it i ask that
[1:13:48] you would touch the hearts of those
[1:13:49] who've heard
[1:13:52] [Music]
[1:13:54] for that one who prayed today
[1:13:58] it had a long season of prayer before
[1:14:00] they came here
[1:14:02] and said lord i'm coming to church
[1:14:04] tonight because i need something
[1:14:07] and they asked for you to come and meet
[1:14:09] their need may you now father
[1:14:11] give them the healing they asked for
[1:14:15] give them the relief that they desired
[1:14:17] give them
[1:14:20] the meat that meets their need tonight
[1:14:23] or they did exactly what your prophet
[1:14:24] said to do they were in a season of
[1:14:26] prayer they put themselves aside they
[1:14:28] prayed
[1:14:28] they came expecting they came with the
[1:14:30] right attitude and lord now may they
[1:14:32] leave here having received
[1:14:34] what they had need of may they go to
[1:14:36] getting healed as your prophet said
[1:14:40] lord for a lot of us it's probably a
[1:14:43] chaotic evening
[1:14:46] but you saw our hearts lord
[1:14:50] we finally say enough and push the chaos
[1:14:52] aside so that we can come
[1:14:55] and hear from you lord i pray now
[1:14:58] despite the chaos of the afternoon and
[1:14:59] even the things that were just
[1:15:01] pressing on us as we walked in the door
[1:15:03] lord we heard you
[1:15:06] our spirit said amen to you we ask now
[1:15:09] for a special touch
[1:15:11] let your firefall let your presence move
[1:15:14] strengthen and encourage
[1:15:16] forgive and set free give us that
[1:15:19] freshness in our spirits we long to have
[1:15:21] lord
[1:15:23] bless your people be with us now we pray
[1:15:26] in jesus name
[1:15:28] amen
