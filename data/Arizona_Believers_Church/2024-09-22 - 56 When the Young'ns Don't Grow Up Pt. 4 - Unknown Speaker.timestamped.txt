[0:00] part four this morning of when the young
[0:02] ones youngans don't grow up and I'll
[0:05] give just a little bit of background of
[0:07] where we were at on Wednesday night but
[0:08] when we pose this title uh it's to uh
[0:12] provoke thought and to give us to start
[0:14] thinking about youngans and what is even
[0:16] meant by youngans we might be able to
[0:17] say babes or uh infants or children of
[0:21] Christ or the CH uh kids in Christ
[0:23] however you might want to look at it but
[0:25] when we say uh when the young on don't
[0:26] grow up we're referring to failing to
[0:29] mature
[0:30] uh properly to grow up as one ought to
[0:32] you think in terms of the development of
[0:34] a a natural child that there's certain
[0:37] benchmarks that even the medical
[0:39] community is looking for to know that
[0:40] there's natural progression and
[0:42] development physically and even mentally
[0:44] within a child and so we're just using
[0:46] that as a um a type of what God does for
[0:49] a child of God spiritually and so it it
[0:52] reflects a failure to mature also a
[0:54] failure to reach the potential that one
[0:56] would have that you have uh um certain
[0:59] gifts or certain qualities or certain uh
[1:01] characteristics by nature and failure to
[1:04] reach that potential would be maybe a
[1:06] failure of nurture failure of
[1:08] environment or uh poor decisions in life
[1:11] and it also speaks to fulfilling your
[1:13] purpose as Paul said that we walk worthy
[1:15] of the vocation wherewith you're called
[1:17] and that we all have a calling yet we're
[1:20] all United together and we have
[1:21] different measures we are to fulfill
[1:24] that purpose we want to fulfill that
[1:25] measure if you've only been given a
[1:28] measure and instead of given a new
[1:29] numeric value let's just say your
[1:31] measure is e uh you want to reach that
[1:34] fullness of whatever that is and that
[1:36] would be hundredfold that would be you
[1:39] reaching your full potential and that's
[1:41] ought to be what our desire in life is
[1:43] is not to be like somebody else but I
[1:45] want to fill up my full potential
[1:47] knowing that if I fill up my full
[1:49] potential I've got a full reward and I
[1:52] don't fall short of of anybody else I I
[1:55] I I fulfill the plan that God had for me
[1:58] and we know that God's will is
[1:59] perfection
[2:00] and if we were if we got together as a
[2:02] committee and we had the uh privilege of
[2:05] interpreting the Bible for everyone else
[2:07] to read we might selfishly say no God
[2:09] God does not require Perfection uh God
[2:12] just wants us confession that's all he
[2:14] wants and we would feel really good
[2:15] about ourselves and we'd go eat tacos
[2:17] right now but we know that God's will is
[2:20] beyond that it's it's Perfection and
[2:22] that there is a sinless Perfection of
[2:24] the Soul through Christ it's a perfect
[2:26] blood it's a perfect uh forgiveness it's
[2:28] a perfect justification but yet there's
[2:30] more to that so that that's why the
[2:32] Bible I say is as big as it is is
[2:35] because God has so much uh in uh so much
[2:39] love for us he's detailed and he wants
[2:41] to have a place in our lives and so
[2:43] there's so much more to the process of
[2:45] coming to know Christ than just that
[2:47] initial work of the Holy Ghost Wednesday
[2:49] night we pose the question well why grow
[2:51] up as you look at the title slide it
[2:53] says when youngans don't grow up uh when
[2:55] the young ons don't grow up it's
[2:57] implying uh you know there's a lot of
[2:59] different things that we could wrestle
[3:00] with but why grow up we looked at how as
[3:02] a child as a young you're an heir and
[3:05] you are an heir of God and not just an
[3:07] heir of God but joint heirs with Christ
[3:09] in Romans 8:17 we could read this and so
[3:12] because you are an heir you are trained
[3:15] to inherit as he says and if children
[3:17] then heirs Heirs of God and Joint heirs
[3:20] with Christ if so be that we suffer with
[3:22] him that we may Al be also glorified
[3:25] together this is uh pretty good
[3:28] breadcrumbs for understanding where I'm
[3:30] coming from when I talk about growing up
[3:33] and why grow up because we're children
[3:35] we're heirs and being heirs we have to
[3:38] suffer that we can be inherit we can
[3:40] receive the inheritance and this
[3:42] suffering is not being called names only
[3:44] it's not being persecuted it's not
[3:46] physical suffering alone or some sort of
[3:48] trauma but it is the process of
[3:50] character development and the process of
[3:53] character development also is hearing
[3:55] what you ought to do and humbling
[3:56] yourself to do it uh the process of
[3:58] character development is making mistakes
[4:00] and being corrected and following
[4:01] through so there's a lot that goes into
[4:03] this suffering not just a physical
[4:06] persecution or physical sickness so
[4:08] because we are children we're Heirs of
[4:10] God joint HS with Christ and being heirs
[4:12] we need to be trained we need to suffer
[4:14] we need to have our character developed
[4:16] that we might be glorified together with
[4:18] Christ in Acts 20:32 and it says now
[4:21] Brethren I commend you to God and to the
[4:23] word of his grace I just love that
[4:25] phrase the word of his grace which is
[4:28] able to Build You Up it is the word that
[4:30] is able to build you up so there's a
[4:33] Grace that has come uh in your initial
[4:35] regeneration by the baptism of the Holy
[4:37] Ghost and this grace is able to build
[4:40] you up and to give you an inheritance
[4:42] among all them that which are Sanctified
[4:46] this buildup it means to finish the
[4:48] structure for which the foundation was
[4:50] laid so when it says build up it means
[4:52] there's some Foundation there what is
[4:53] the foundation salvation the New Birth
[4:55] the indwelling of the Holy Spirit the
[4:57] the the old man dying the new man being
[5:00] awakened being quickened to life that
[5:02] seed being germinated and coming to life
[5:04] and therefore the building up is the
[5:06] finishing of the work that God started
[5:09] in you to build on that Foundation Jesus
[5:12] Christ the author and finisher of our
[5:16] faith and so there is a perfecting
[5:19] process that takes place and it's the
[5:21] word of his grace that's able to build
[5:23] you up or to serve my purpose grow you
[5:26] up and we would I guess I could conclude
[5:29] when Night by saying that being born or
[5:32] being a child of God is more than just
[5:33] being born say born I'm a Child of God
[5:36] now I wouldn't want to take anything
[5:37] away from that because that that's what
[5:40] guarantees you a resurrection that's
[5:42] what guarantees you the Rapture it's
[5:44] it's what permanently gives you a place
[5:45] in the body of Christ but being a child
[5:48] of God not only implies a birth but it
[5:50] also means growing up or
[5:53] perfecting now today I want to continue
[5:55] in that thought and as I've always
[5:57] already been reminded by my family that
[5:59] it's been very repetitious but I've been
[6:01] assured it's been in a good way and so I
[6:03] appreciate that feedback and I want to
[6:07] continue look at growing up from babes
[6:09] to mature Believers and I want to take
[6:11] some time here at the outset to say
[6:13] there's nothing wrong with being a babe
[6:14] and for some of you who calls your
[6:16] spouse babe uh that's just something
[6:18] that you commonly hear every time is
[6:20] babe babe babe babe and you never know
[6:22] if it's a man or a woman but everybody's
[6:23] a babe now if you've got a boo right or
[6:26] a ba I mean everybody's everybody's got
[6:28] some sort of nickname uh uh for for
[6:31] their spouse and babe seems to come up a
[6:33] lot but there's nothing wrong with being
[6:35] a babe and all the Babe
[6:37] said amen right but there's nothing
[6:41] wrong with being a babe in Christ in
[6:43] Luke 10: 211 it says in that hour Jesus
[6:46] rejoiced in spirit and said I thank thee
[6:48] oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth that
[6:50] thou Hast hid these things from the wise
[6:52] and prudent and H has revealed them unto
[6:54] babes even so father for so it seemed
[6:57] good in thy sight
[7:01] this uh positioning of the wise and
[7:04] prudent versus babes would be like this
[7:06] is the David ver versus Goliath this is
[7:08] the Harvard Professor talking to a
[7:10] canary brain a lot of different ways
[7:12] that you could position this but in this
[7:14] case uh the the one that is being uh put
[7:18] in a peculiar place to not receive the
[7:20] Revelation are those who are WIS in Wise
[7:23] in prudent they're learned they're
[7:25] intelligent they're educated in some
[7:27] ways you can say they already have all
[7:28] the answers they already know everything
[7:30] and so they can't be taught and so he's
[7:33] saying God has hid these things from
[7:35] those who are wise and prudent and
[7:38] reveals them unto babes and so it seemed
[7:40] good in thy sight means this is God's
[7:42] will this is God's plan and the word
[7:45] they babes the the napos is the Hebrew
[7:50] word the Greek word that is used and the
[7:52] Nay there is a negative it implies
[7:54] negation of apos which is to say or to
[7:57] speak so when it says babes it's
[8:00] basically saying unable to speak and as
[8:02] a babe a newborn does not inherently
[8:05] upon birth understand language as a
[8:08] matter of fact when a baby is born
[8:09] they're not born with any sort of innate
[8:11] ability to understand whatever native
[8:14] language their parents were born with
[8:15] you could take a baby that was born uh
[8:18] to Chinese parents who the parents spoke
[8:21] Chinese at Mandarin to be specific and
[8:23] then that baby be raised by uh
[8:26] Spanish-speaking parents and the baby
[8:27] would learn Spanish just as easily as
[8:29] would have Chinese so there's no
[8:31] necessarily innate ability to speak a
[8:33] particular language but the newborns not
[8:35] even be able to understand language
[8:37] initially they have to learn that
[8:40] language and language could be defined
[8:43] as some sort of socially agreed upon
[8:45] symbols uh that convey a meaning and
[8:47] that and human human beings are the only
[8:50] ones that would have a system of
[8:51] language a spoken language like this so
[8:54] babes I'm just using this to make this
[8:56] point that babes aren't able to speak
[8:58] initially
[9:00] and they don't understand language
[9:01] initially so they have to learn it
[9:04] they're still learning value they're
[9:06] gaining knowledge of right and wrong and
[9:08] one of these components is being able to
[9:11] learn how to speak how first of all we
[9:14] can say learn to understand what is
[9:16] being said to them so they can
[9:18] understand instruction they can
[9:19] understand correction they can
[9:21] understand what to do and then it's a
[9:22] process of learning not only to
[9:24] understand language but to say it back
[9:25] and to convey it back I know in our
[9:27] family as our children are being raised
[9:29] there were certain things that they
[9:30] would say and I might instinctively want
[9:32] to correct how they're saying Elizabeth
[9:35] say oh no let them say it it's cute let
[9:36] them say it as long as they can I
[9:38] knowing that eventually they would grow
[9:40] out of it and wouldn't it be funny if
[9:41] they never did but the the idea is
[9:45] they've got to learn to understand
[9:46] what's being said so that they can grow
[9:48] up properly and then they have to also
[9:50] learn how to communicate so when Jesus
[9:52] says he's revealed it un babes he's
[9:54] saying that they they don't necessarily
[9:56] understand language so they have to be
[9:58] taught to understand and then the babes
[10:01] aren't able to
[10:02] speak so maybe they just it just sounds
[10:05] like J gibberish and that stage is cute
[10:07] whenever they're at that stage where
[10:08] it's just blah blah blah blah blah and
[10:10] I've always loved the long stories that
[10:13] are just
[10:14] sounds and to them it's making sense I
[10:17] remember when we had been visiting
[10:18] Europe and we had been in Europe for
[10:20] maybe a week and a half when Jack was
[10:21] the only child with us that traveled and
[10:23] after about a week or so he started
[10:25] talking to us and we realized he was
[10:26] speaking French in what he understood
[10:29] French French to be or German and that's
[10:31] just the that's what a toddler a babe is
[10:34] someone growing up will do and they're
[10:35] trying to mimic they're trying to
[10:37] learn and yet so it's a god reveals the
[10:40] word to babe so I when I say that I want
[10:42] you to see that there's this
[10:44] characteristic except you become as one
[10:46] of these little ones uh you cannot enter
[10:48] into the kingdom of heaven so there's a
[10:49] characteristic of being a babe that is
[10:51] precious that there should be no slight
[10:53] against it but yet at the same time the
[10:55] Bible says in Isaiah 3:4 and I will give
[10:58] children to be their princes and babe
[11:00] shall rule over them and nobody in the
[11:02] kingdom was saying yes immediately they
[11:05] understood this to be a negative whoo
[11:07] when your princes eat in the morning
[11:09] your kings eat in the morning and they
[11:10] drink and they satisfy uh uh their
[11:12] pleasure in the morning and they satisfy
[11:14] their spiritual appetite instead of
[11:16] dispensing justice so it says I'll give
[11:18] children to be your princes and babes to
[11:20] rule over you nothing wrong with being a
[11:22] babe but character isn't suited for the
[11:26] position the character of a babe isn't
[11:28] suited to be a prince the of a babe
[11:29] isn't suitable to rule over the people
[11:32] there's something about being a child
[11:33] that's not one that ought to be ruling
[11:34] there's something about a babe that
[11:36] shouldn't be a king so there's nothing
[11:38] wrong with being an infant being a
[11:39] toddler being a child being an
[11:41] adolescent but there's something about
[11:43] those times of life that aren't Fit For
[11:45] A calling or a
[11:47] position says in 1 Timothy 4:2 let no
[11:51] man despise thy youth so there's
[11:53] something precious about being a babe
[11:56] there's something precious about being
[11:57] young and younger than others and being
[11:59] in your youth says of this Youth and
[12:01] Timothy obviously was older than a babe
[12:03] or just a child but says but be thou an
[12:04] example of the Believers in word and
[12:07] conversation and charity and spirit and
[12:09] faith and Purity let no man despise your
[12:12] youth but don't use your youthfulness as
[12:14] an excuse to not become a bear of the
[12:17] perfect will of God it's wonderful to be
[12:19] young it's wonderful to be a a babe in
[12:22] Christ it's great to be a youth but
[12:24] remember that God has called you to be
[12:26] the an example of the word in your life
[12:29] in charity and spirit and faith and
[12:31] Purity so being a babe is nothing to be
[12:33] ashamed of being youth a youth a young
[12:36] and is nothing to be ashamed of nor
[12:38] should we ever despise
[12:40] youngans say this to comfort the young
[12:43] those young in Christ those that uh feel
[12:45] that they're in the early stages of
[12:46] growing that's nothing to be ashamed of
[12:48] don't have to pretend you don't have to
[12:50] try to fit in with the revelated crowd
[12:51] you don't have to try to fit in with
[12:53] everybody who seems to be more spiritual
[12:55] just know where you are in Christ and
[12:57] understand there's nothing to be ashamed
[12:58] of in being young and to those who feel
[13:01] that they're perfect or more advanced or
[13:03] older or adults whatever you might be
[13:05] there do not despise a young don't
[13:09] despise a babe when they're being a babe
[13:11] don't despise the youth when they're
[13:12] being youth a and and I and I would even
[13:15] say if they're making mistakes don't
[13:16] despise them sometimes it's our uh
[13:20] self-righteous indignation which is
[13:22] unjustified towards young people and
[13:24] people that make mistakes that makes
[13:26] their way back harder pushes them out
[13:28] into into the world and doesn't create a
[13:30] place where they feel like they're being
[13:31] nurtured it's like well they just expect
[13:33] Perfection if you don't tow the line you
[13:35] might as well just leave and they might
[13:37] feel just as good being out in the world
[13:39] than to be a hypocrite in your family or
[13:41] in your church and that's no place to be
[13:44] because I would argue it's in the world
[13:46] that they're a
[13:47] hypocrite and they should be amongst
[13:49] Believers being nurtured and the grace
[13:51] being shared so don't despise youth
[13:54] youth are a certain way they think a
[13:56] certain way they have a certain energy
[13:57] we shouldn't despise
[13:59] that for it says in Luke 2: 11 and 12
[14:03] For unto you is Born This Day in the
[14:05] city of David a savior which is Christ
[14:08] the
[14:09] lord now the language here that is used
[14:12] by these angels might have suggested
[14:14] some coming forth some manifestation and
[14:16] they might have thought oh wow this is
[14:18] going to be amazing we're going to go
[14:19] see a conqueror we're going to go see a
[14:21] lord we're going to go see a king we're
[14:22] going to see a savior but it says in
[14:24] verse 12 and this shall be a sign unto
[14:26] you ye shall find the Babe wrapped in
[14:28] swaddling clothes lying in the
[14:31] manger a savior Christ the lord the
[14:35] Messiah and the the first image that
[14:38] anyone ever had of him was a
[14:40] helpless blood covered babe a
[14:44] newborn and these Shepherds would come
[14:47] and they would find their Messiah the
[14:49] savior Christ the lord helpless wrapped
[14:53] and swaddling clothes Lin in a Manger
[14:55] characterized as a babe there's nothing
[14:58] evil about being being a babe there's
[14:59] nothing wrong with being a young it's
[15:01] even how Christ began and Peter says in
[15:04] 1 Peter chap 2:2 as newborn babes desire
[15:07] the sincere milk of the word there's no
[15:09] shame in being a babe there's nothing
[15:11] wrong with being a young one but you
[15:12] should have a desire for the sincere
[15:14] milk of the word that you may grow
[15:16] thereby this is one of the outstanding
[15:18] characteristics of being an infant or
[15:20] being a babe or being an adolescent is
[15:22] there's a certain diet that you must be
[15:24] have to consume and to feed upon that
[15:27] you may grow says if so be that you've
[15:28] tasted that the Lord is
[15:30] gracious so we are likened unto babes
[15:33] nothing wrong with being a young Christ
[15:36] started out as a bab we all begin upon
[15:38] our new birth as being babes who desire
[15:41] the milk of the word that causes us to
[15:42] increase and grow the same was so for
[15:45] Christ in Luke 2:52 and Jesus increased
[15:48] in wisdom and stature and in favor with
[15:50] God and
[15:52] man Jesus as a Christ the lord being the
[15:56] word h being deity formed by the very
[16:00] word of God in the womb of a virgin when
[16:02] he was born still went through the
[16:03] process of increasing in wisdom and
[16:06] physical stature and as he increased in
[16:08] wisdom he gained favor with God and man
[16:11] that means God's favor for him grew as
[16:14] the child
[16:16] grew so being a babe God has revealed
[16:20] hidden things to
[16:21] babes babes must learn to understand
[16:25] language napos they don't have an
[16:28] understanding language they aren't able
[16:30] to speak they have to learn speech which
[16:32] is the output of a language system and
[16:35] maybe initially as they begin to speak
[16:37] it's not clear it's intelligible it's
[16:38] characteristic of an infant or youth who
[16:40] doesn't have the dexterity with their
[16:42] tongue and able to speak clearly or the
[16:44] understanding the language but they are
[16:46] re the word is revealed so that they can
[16:48] speak
[16:50] clearly brother bham teaches us in a
[16:52] number of different places I've chose
[16:54] this uh a larger excerpt from trying to
[16:58] do God AER without it being its will
[17:00] this is preached in that sh shareport
[17:02] series around Thanksgiving Day 1965
[17:04] which I encourage you all who are
[17:06] looking for material or things to read
[17:08] and some devotion things I'd really
[17:10] encourage you to have taken this entire
[17:11] series for forms the inspiration for
[17:15] this part that we've been ministering on
[17:18] he's speaking how words can take on
[17:20] different meanings and how in the early
[17:21] church there was arguments and splits
[17:23] over single words in the Bible he say
[17:25] just like our language the word c use
[17:27] the word c you could mean body of water
[17:29] I understand or many things I I I love
[17:33] VC and you'd say
[17:35] well what are you referring to right and
[17:38] it's kind of the question what's a
[17:39] pirate's favorite letter and everybody
[17:42] says R and it's like no it t the C so it
[17:44] can mean different things it could be a
[17:46] sea a letter sea it could be the ocean
[17:48] it could be to understand or to see
[17:50] something says many things bored to be a
[17:52] Bor to be boring a hole make a walk or
[17:55] you bored me or you paid my board or it
[17:58] could mean many things remember one time
[18:01] we're filling a a question was asked
[18:02] about well they'll get the church board
[18:04] after you and a trying to translate the
[18:06] statement that brother Brandon made into
[18:07] another language and so in the minds of
[18:09] the ones that were reading it English
[18:11] being their second or third language
[18:12] they were thinking that the church had a
[18:14] board you know that they would get after
[18:16] you like a paddle and so there's a lot
[18:18] of meanings to these words it could mean
[18:20] many things and those little vows and so
[18:23] forth Just Chang the whole meaning what
[18:25] does that tell us understanding the
[18:27] language is important in the natural
[18:29] just one letter off I remember when I
[18:31] was learning lingala and uh it was uh
[18:34] there was a St phrase that you could use
[18:36] and I'm not going to try right now
[18:37] because I realize I may make the same
[18:38] mistake is you could say I am your
[18:40] brother and if you just change the
[18:42] inflection just a little bit you're
[18:44] saying I am your
[18:45] witch i h and so there's the fine line
[18:48] between being embarrassed or pregnant in
[18:50] Spanish right so there's there's certain
[18:53] things you got to get right or the
[18:54] meaning completely changes and so it
[18:57] says God wrot he said and so
[18:59] so you'll never do it like that God
[19:01] wrote it like that and all the word is
[19:03] inspired he said that I thank thee
[19:06] father that thou has hid these things
[19:07] from the wise of the wise the eyes of
[19:09] the wise and prudent and were revealed
[19:11] to babes and this is the phrase I really
[19:13] wanted you to catch such as will learn
[19:16] if you read it in the Bible both in Luke
[19:18] and Matthew you'll find that Jesus says
[19:21] hath revealed it them unto babes and
[19:25] many times dozens of times when brother
[19:26] BR quotes the scripture he adds this
[19:28] part part to say such as will learn to
[19:30] convey the sense that babes are those
[19:33] that are able and ready to learn not the
[19:35] wise and prudent we've already learned I
[19:37] already got to figure it all out but
[19:38] this Revelation is for the babes that
[19:40] will learn it's that key phrase such as
[19:42] will learn such as would learn I want
[19:45] you to understand a babe is one who has
[19:47] the potential and the better capacity to
[19:49] learn he says it's a revelation of him
[19:51] as I said last evening will reveal it to
[19:57] babes just skipping down it says God
[19:59] does things in such a strange way to our
[20:02] intellectual thinking that makes it
[20:05] God and he talks about how God didn't go
[20:07] to theologians and so forth and the
[20:09] smart cyesis he had it just right but
[20:12] God went down and got fishermen that
[20:13] couldn't even sign their name and that's
[20:15] what he
[20:16] took that's God he takes something
[20:18] that's nothing he makes something out of
[20:20] it to his own
[20:22] honor there's there's even the sense of
[20:24] beginning with Clay a new Fresh and this
[20:28] phrase he took a chaos and made an Eden
[20:30] it's God and that's what the world is to
[20:33] a baby it's chaos it's unintelligible
[20:36] they can't figure it out the their
[20:37] senses their depth perception everything
[20:39] is just chaotic but then there's a
[20:40] nurturing that takes place and an
[20:42] education that takes place and the whole
[20:43] world is a baby laboratory and they're
[20:46] learning things they're trying to figure
[20:47] things out and this is what God does he
[20:49] takes chaos and makes an
[20:52] Eden so this phrasing
[20:54] babes implies it's inherent to
[20:58] understand that babes who do not have
[21:00] the capacity to understand language nor
[21:02] to speak it God reveals to them so it's
[21:05] say he wants to convey to one whose
[21:07] nature is suitable to learn he conveys
[21:10] it to those that are able and ready to
[21:12] learn that can be trained that can be
[21:13] instructed can grow up right that that
[21:17] they they have the flexibility to grow
[21:19] they're not old in the later stages a a
[21:22] and if you put wine into that it's going
[21:24] to burst he wants wants new he wants it
[21:27] fresh and Ephesians 4:14 it says that we
[21:30] henceforth be no more children tossed to
[21:33] and fro and carried about with every
[21:35] wind of Doctrine by the slide of men and
[21:37] cunny craftiness whereby they lie and
[21:38] wait to deceive if I could just say this
[21:41] quickly as we'll revisit this scripture
[21:43] here in a little bit the childhood is
[21:45] marked by up ups and downs if you watch
[21:48] one's life and you were able to look at
[21:50] pictures and follow it you'd see
[21:51] different stages in that child's life
[21:53] where they were trying to figure out
[21:54] their identity and figure out who they
[21:56] were and what they wanted to do and and
[21:58] all sorts of hodgepodges of certain
[22:00] things and so childhood is marked by ups
[22:02] and downs I want to be a firefighter no
[22:04] I want to be the president of the United
[22:05] States no I want to be this no I want to
[22:06] be that no I love this I love that I
[22:09] found that one thing that is certainly
[22:10] characteristic of a certain age is
[22:11] what's your favorite yeah everything's
[22:14] got to be a favorite now now that I'm
[22:15] being asked at almost 50 I'm like I
[22:17] don't
[22:18] know do I have to have a favorite and I
[22:22] don't know if you were a fruit what
[22:23] would you be I don't know just start
[22:27] crying and say strong strawberry right
[22:29] you just you just there's some things
[22:30] you just don't figure out and you don't
[22:32] know because when you get to a certain
[22:33] age you're like I don't I don't have a
[22:35] favorite fruit I don't have a favorite
[22:37] color but there's this idea way of
[22:39] identifying yourself and identity and
[22:41] who you are and what do you belong to
[22:43] that's marked by childhood and so
[22:44] there's a certain characteristic of a
[22:46] childhood where they're tossed they're
[22:48] carried about what are they trying to
[22:49] find purpose trying to find
[22:51] identity and then there's also this and
[22:53] I I'm not saying that that's all in
[22:55] itself bad but it's the instability
[22:58] of infancy toddler child uh
[23:04] adolescence these different stages as
[23:06] one grows and as we've mentioned this
[23:08] scripture quite a bit recently 2 Timothy
[23:10] 2:22 flee also youthful lust that means
[23:14] these are lusts that are characteristic
[23:15] of Youth certain desires and passions
[23:18] that one would have as a child things
[23:19] that they really really want to do and
[23:21] things that they want to enjoy and
[23:22] places they want to go things that they
[23:24] want to do and Paul is saying Timothy
[23:26] flee and instruct those to flee youthful
[23:28] lust there are lust that are
[23:30] characteristic of certain ages and I
[23:32] mean literal times of Life of teenagers
[23:34] and pre-teens and those things saying
[23:36] don't follow them don't give in them
[23:38] recognize that there's certain things
[23:40] that are characteristic of Youth like
[23:42] staying up all
[23:43] night right just playing video games all
[23:46] night long not even sleeping until the
[23:49] sun comes up and then being able to
[23:51] sleep till 2:00 in the afternoon you'll
[23:52] find that as you get later in adult life
[23:54] you need your
[23:56] sleep yes you find out I can't do this
[23:59] cuz I pay a heavy price and so there's
[24:01] certain things about the youth this says
[24:03] but follow righteousness Faith charity
[24:05] peace with them that call in the Lord
[24:06] out of a pure heart the very things he
[24:08] says let no man despise your
[24:11] youth but be an example of the believer
[24:13] in these things so he's telling them to
[24:15] flee lust of your youth that no man
[24:18] would despise your youthfulness and in
[24:20] that you convey the wrong things and you
[24:23] express the wrong attitudes and you give
[24:24] yourself over to things that aren't
[24:26] appropriate
[24:28] so just as the word of his grace is able
[24:30] to build us up in 2 Peter 3:18 he says
[24:33] but grow in Grace and in the knowledge
[24:35] of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[24:37] Christ there's nothing wrong with being
[24:40] a babe there's nothing wrong with being
[24:41] a young man but to if you've tasted that
[24:44] the Lord is gracious if you one day want
[24:46] to be glorified together if you want to
[24:47] receive a full reward if you want to
[24:49] reach your full potential then we must
[24:51] grow in Grace and in the knowledge of
[24:54] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we
[24:56] don't grow in grace to become saved nor
[24:58] do we grow in the knowledge of our Lord
[25:00] Jesus Christ to become Sons and
[25:01] Daughters of God but because you are his
[25:04] sons because you are his daughters you
[25:06] can grow in Grace and in the knowledge
[25:08] of Our
[25:09] Lord nothing wrong with being a babe as
[25:11] a matter of fact he reveals it unto
[25:13] babes such as would learn because this
[25:15] characteristic of one who's been newly
[25:17] born in Christ this season of life in
[25:19] your youth in your singleness in this
[25:21] stage of being a young one just as in
[25:24] the natural a baby's brain is has
[25:26] tremendous capacity neuroplasticity how
[25:28] many want to break out into just a
[25:30] session on neuroplasticity it's this
[25:32] ability to change and adapt to new
[25:34] experiences and the baby and when it's
[25:36] first born this neuroplasticity is
[25:38] always on for a baby this is even good
[25:41] to learn just even as we're raising kids
[25:44] and the baby's brain is wired to try
[25:46] over and over again to master a skill
[25:49] and that's why we would encourage try
[25:51] hard things try difficult things try
[25:52] things that make you uncomfortable try
[25:54] things that you fail at so you can learn
[25:55] this resilience and this perseverance
[25:57] and this grit and you you're okay with
[25:58] being uncomfortable and you encourage
[26:00] that during a particular time where the
[26:01] brain is doing this and as this brain is
[26:04] trying this neuroplasticity is creating
[26:07] these new connections it's learning
[26:09] these learning these processes creates
[26:11] neural Pathways that make this
[26:13] connection they connect and it opens up
[26:15] a new channel and all these things are
[26:17] taking place and it's it's most constant
[26:19] is within the first five years of being
[26:20] born very critical stage of one's
[26:23] development I say that's the time of
[26:24] being a babe and what does God do he
[26:26] reveals it unto babes such as would
[26:28] learn a time when they're able to make
[26:30] connections your Youth and your
[26:32] youthfulness and your singleness it's a
[26:33] time when the right emphasis is so
[26:35] important to emphasize you still enjoy
[26:38] your youth I mean when our babies are
[26:40] born we don't give an aptitude test
[26:42] which one do you want to be you want to
[26:43] be loyal you want to be a lawyer huh we
[26:45] don't we don't do that they kind of let
[26:47] them grow and they let them Comm but we
[26:48] can be teaching them things as they grow
[26:50] and as they develop say emphasize the
[26:52] right things understand we're training
[26:54] them for adulthood we're training them
[26:56] for a future to also be husband husbands
[26:58] and
[27:00] wives and so this learning process is
[27:03] very very active this neuroplasty
[27:05] reveals under the babes this is so in
[27:07] the natural I believe it's also so in
[27:09] the
[27:09] spiritual that how we cultivate how we
[27:12] grow and how we learn in our youth is so
[27:14] critical to our development as a
[27:17] Christian and one thing that's very
[27:19] remarkable during this stage these first
[27:21] five years or when this neuroplasticity
[27:22] is always on or where it remains very
[27:24] active is you can quickly learn thing
[27:27] habits and and then unlearn negative
[27:29] habits and you can unlearn things that
[27:32] are negative and replace them with
[27:33] things that are positive and this is a
[27:36] process that takes place when one is a
[27:38] babe where there's things that are
[27:39] negative that you can quickly teach and
[27:41] discipline and instruct and cause them
[27:43] to unlearn negative habits my wife and I
[27:46] this morning were talking about
[27:47] something in particular we said I and I
[27:48] just said I don't believe it's too late
[27:50] for change even if they are a pre-teen
[27:53] or teenager no matter what age are just
[27:55] have this Faith to believe that we can
[27:57] teach and train and demonstrate the
[27:59] right example so that if there's some
[28:01] neural process some bad habit that
[28:03] there's enough neuroplasticity in their
[28:06] minds and in their brains to be able to
[28:07] grab a hold of
[28:09] something I realize I I say this I guess
[28:11] it just pops in my mind but I remember
[28:14] when um do we do we still use Co do we
[28:17] still say
[28:18] Co do we still say that well I remember
[28:21] when I when I got Co back in
[28:23] 2020 I had such tremendous brain fog I
[28:26] couldn't figure anything out but the day
[28:28] I couldn't do puzzles it's like the it's
[28:30] like a curse I sit there and stare at a
[28:32] puzzle go what's a border piece right
[28:35] and so there's just this brain fog well
[28:36] I realized kind of later on that's just
[28:38] getting
[28:39] old and and so you in your mind you
[28:42] think I I I could figure this out I can
[28:43] figure this out I figure that out and
[28:44] you know everything and you kind of feel
[28:45] sorry for your kids right your silly
[28:47] little kids are never going to learn
[28:48] anything and they just figure everything
[28:49] how do you know that how do you know how
[28:50] do you figure that out what what what
[28:52] you no I'm the one I was around when
[28:53] that was invented I'm Al Gore I invented
[28:55] the Internet how do you know how to use
[28:56] that right but to plasticity the things
[28:59] they pick up on the way they can figure
[29:00] things out it's very very robust well
[29:02] God wants the same thing for us as
[29:05] newborn babes and there's this other
[29:06] Dynamic where we learned all sorts of
[29:08] things in this thing right and then we
[29:10] get 21 years old and we get the Holy
[29:12] Ghost and now we're babe in Christ and
[29:14] he wants us to unlearn bad habits here
[29:16] by a greater neuroplasticity in a
[29:18] spiritual soul and a mind to have the
[29:21] mind of Christ to overcome and unlearn a
[29:23] lot of negative things that we have in
[29:25] our human humanity and so the revelation
[29:28] of the word should be working to mature
[29:30] our thinking and our
[29:32] acting now in Ephesians 4: 7- 11 I hope
[29:36] I can go uh quickly here as we're
[29:39] looking at our text but unto every one
[29:41] of us is given Grace so we want to grow
[29:44] in Grace this grace that has been given
[29:45] to us we want to grow in according to
[29:48] the measure of the gift of Christ so
[29:49] there's some measure of Grace given to
[29:51] us every one of us has given Grace
[29:52] according to a measure of the gift of
[29:55] Christ wherefore he saith now because of
[29:58] this verse seven is I think very
[30:00] important to understand every one of us
[30:01] given a Grace according to the measure
[30:03] of the gift of Christ everyone has a
[30:04] vocation wherewith we are called though
[30:07] there is one God one Lord one baptism
[30:09] one in all of us one Faith one f one
[30:11] hope your all these things that we share
[30:12] this Oneness all of us are given a Grace
[30:15] according to a measure of the gift of
[30:16] Christ wherefore he saith he ascended up
[30:19] on high he led captivity captive and
[30:22] gave gifts unto men let's just skip to
[30:24] verse 11 and he gave some Apostles and
[30:27] and some prophets and some evangelists
[30:29] and some pastors and teachers so the
[30:32] ascended Christ has given he ascended up
[30:36] on high and gave gifts to men because
[30:39] every one of us is given a Grace
[30:41] according to the measure of the gift of
[30:42] Christ so the measure of the gift of
[30:43] Christ is here and because every one of
[30:45] us has a measure of the gift of Christ
[30:47] he's given
[30:49] gifts catch that we've been given gifts
[30:52] because of this measure now going back
[30:54] to verse n he says now he that ascended
[30:57] what is it but that he also descended
[30:59] first in the lower parts of the Earth
[31:01] this is just beautiful teaching that he
[31:02] inserts there he says he that descended
[31:04] is the same also that ascended up far
[31:06] above all the heavens that he might fill
[31:09] all things so he has ascended with the
[31:13] purpose that he would have preeminence
[31:15] or fill all things and that you have a
[31:19] measure of the gift of Christ every one
[31:23] of us is given a Grace according to that
[31:24] measure of the gift of Christ that he
[31:26] wants to fill up amen and because he
[31:29] wants to fill that up he's given gifts
[31:32] the ascended Christ is to fill all
[31:33] things and this is a process that coming
[31:36] to full measure process of this Grace
[31:38] being uh applied in your life to where
[31:40] he can fill up all things have prence so
[31:43] God gives gifts Colossians 1:18 and he
[31:46] is the head of the body of the church
[31:47] who is the beginning the firstborn from
[31:49] the dead there he is the firstborn from
[31:51] the dead the only begotten of the son
[31:52] the father that in all things he might
[31:55] have the preeminence right so he wants
[31:58] to fill All Things fill up the full
[31:59] measure of the gift of Christ Ephesians
[32:02] 1: 22 and 23 and hath put all things
[32:06] under his feet and gave him to be the
[32:08] head over all things to the church which
[32:11] is his body the fullness of him that
[32:13] filth all in all so the body is the
[32:16] fullness of him that filth all in all
[32:19] every one of us has been given Grace
[32:20] according to the measure of the gift of
[32:22] Christ Christ has ascended that he might
[32:24] fill all things so having been ascended
[32:26] he gives gifts and he gives these gifts
[32:28] of prophets evangelists teachers
[32:30] Apostles and pastors and he has given
[32:34] these gifts to do this he has given
[32:37] these gifts to that he that that that
[32:40] they might fill all things that in all
[32:42] things he might have the
[32:44] preeminence that the body can be the
[32:46] fullness of him that filth all in all
[32:49] they say well that's quite the uh that's
[32:51] quite the stringing together of other
[32:53] scriptures brother Aaron well let's just
[32:55] read and let's cover again he's every
[32:57] one of us has been given a Grace
[32:58] according to the measure of the gift of
[33:00] Christ that he might fill all things so
[33:03] he gave gifts to
[33:04] men Apostles prophets evangelists
[33:07] pastors teachers verse 12 for the
[33:11] perfecting of the Saints the Saints
[33:13] those have already been born again
[33:14] Ephesians 1 is addressing those who have
[33:16] already received the Holy Ghost those
[33:17] who are already in the body of Christ
[33:19] remember the Ephesian church is not like
[33:21] the Pentecostal Church in Corinthians
[33:23] that was unsettled and tossed about and
[33:25] and and but this is a church that's
[33:27] matured in the word ready for their
[33:29] placing ready to enter into the final
[33:31] inheritance for the perfecting Saints
[33:32] for the work of the ministry for the
[33:34] edifying of the body of Christ why do
[33:36] these gifts exist why does God give them
[33:38] so that we could be in awe of the
[33:40] teacher whoa no it's there for you the
[33:44] gift is there for you for the perfecting
[33:46] of the Saints the maturing the full
[33:48] development of the Saints for the work
[33:50] of the ministry for the edifying the
[33:52] building up and the increase of the body
[33:54] of Christ till we all come in the unity
[33:57] of the one faith and of the knowledge of
[33:59] the one son of God unto a perfect man
[34:02] that we all would do this under the
[34:03] measure of the stature of the fullness
[34:06] of Christ comes back to verse S un every
[34:09] one of us is given a Grace according to
[34:10] the measure of the gift of Christ and so
[34:12] there is the work of the spirit in our
[34:14] lives to bring us to a perfect man under
[34:17] the measure of the stature of the
[34:18] fullness of Christ according to the gift
[34:20] and the measure that he's given
[34:22] us so just as Christ grew and increased
[34:24] and learned obedience did the father's
[34:27] will as we we can see that in the
[34:28] scripture God's word now is to edify the
[34:32] body until it can mature into the
[34:34] fullness of Christ unto a perfect man of
[34:39] full age is what that means fully grown
[34:41] mature it means we are to go from babe
[34:44] to
[34:46] adulthood and the sermon of God be with
[34:48] us brother bam says you can't expect a
[34:50] baby to be born a man it's got to grow
[34:53] to it and we grow in Christ to a full
[34:56] stature not some get converted tonight
[34:58] and tomorrow go preach the gospel we
[35:00] grow up into manhood into the stature of
[35:03] Christ that it's conveying and I do not
[35:06] believe he's he's saying it's
[35:07] prohibitive that there would be some
[35:08] sort of conversion and be able to
[35:10] minister or to preach the gospel but
[35:12] he's saying that there's there's
[35:13] something some maturing that goes
[35:15] through this there's something that God
[35:16] has in mind you can't expect a baby to
[35:19] be born a
[35:20] man we would certainly not think that uh
[35:24] even though I've seen some newborns that
[35:26] looked every bit of man uh especially
[35:28] with their head of hair but it's not
[35:29] they're not born
[35:31] men we we get that we get they don't
[35:33] have the capacity you know son here's
[35:36] the keys to my car you got your own room
[35:38] you know let's go to Donovan for steak
[35:41] and he's you know 48 Hours old we just
[35:43] we don't even think that way but in some
[35:46] ways in a spiritual sense that's exactly
[35:48] what we do think wow and we actually go
[35:51] so far as to say well this is
[35:52] characteristic of an infant this is
[35:54] their birth this is how they act and we
[35:55] say this is it man this is the
[35:57] penultimate this is the way it should be
[35:59] not realizing this is a stage of growth
[36:01] and development this is a certain time
[36:02] period where the spirit of God is moving
[36:04] in somebody's life but you can't expect
[36:06] a babe in Christ who's been born by the
[36:08] word of God to be a fully grown mature
[36:10] man you've got to grow into the stature
[36:12] of Christ you are every bit the Son and
[36:15] Daughter of God when you were born again
[36:17] you are every bit a child of God
[36:19] destined to the Rapture nothing can take
[36:21] that away sin cannot be imputed to you
[36:23] John even go so far as to say you can't
[36:25] sin
[36:27] and then says if you do sin remember you
[36:29] have a perpetuation so there's some
[36:31] levels of maturity and understanding
[36:33] even in that but it's there's nothing to
[36:35] take away from being a young but the
[36:37] Young's got to grow
[36:39] up we've got to grow up into the stature
[36:41] of
[36:43] Christ so clear for the perfecting of
[36:45] the Saints and the perfect man verse 14
[36:48] that we henceforth be no more children
[36:50] there's something wrong with being a
[36:51] child nope something wrong with being a
[36:53] babe nope something wrong with being a
[36:56] young nope no
[36:58] do you need to grow up yep amen right
[37:01] there's got to be a growing up that we
[37:03] be no more children Paul is not saying
[37:05] well if you're a child you're lost oh my
[37:06] goodness you're lost now you start out
[37:08] as a child what does God do because
[37:09] we're children he gives us his Holy
[37:11] Spirit and the Holy Spirit is living
[37:13] it's Dynamic it's working it's active
[37:14] and he gives it on the inside of us as a
[37:16] teacher but then he doesn't just leave
[37:18] us to ourselves I'm so I don't let me
[37:20] think how I can say this I'm so glad
[37:22] that
[37:23] God is a homeschool parent I was going
[37:26] to say good thing he's not a hom School
[37:27] School parent but he doesn't just send
[37:29] us to our room to figure it out right
[37:32] just hasn't he just hasn't like say well
[37:33] you got the Holy Ghost go figure it out
[37:35] kid he's active he's available if you
[37:39] want to say he sends us to school and he
[37:40] gives us the best
[37:41] teachers he's looking out after us he
[37:44] puts us in in classrooms with other
[37:46] believers of like faith and this is God
[37:48] watching out to cultivate you and to
[37:50] grow you and he's happy that you're a
[37:52] child but his vision is that you become
[37:54] a man he's happy that you're young but
[37:56] his vision is that you become young lady
[37:58] that you grow up so there's nothing
[37:59] wrong with being a young one but we
[38:01] can't stay youngans forever that we be
[38:03] no more Young on tossed to and fro and
[38:05] carried about with every wind of dark
[38:06] and by the slide of men and cunning
[38:07] crabness whereby they light and wait to
[38:09] lie and wait to deceive there's a
[38:11] vulnerability to the young ons
[38:13] vulnerability when you're young and and
[38:15] enthusiastic and impressionable and
[38:17] Desiring and this newness of life that's
[38:19] inside of you you want to serve God you
[38:20] want to please God and you have a lot of
[38:22] zeal and a lot of enthusiasm there's a
[38:24] vulnerability to being tossed about and
[38:26] carried around
[38:29] but speaking the truth in love and this
[38:30] is the mandate to parents this is the
[38:32] mandate to Ministry this is the mandate
[38:34] to the elders we've got to speak the
[38:35] truth in love and speaking the truth in
[38:37] love may the children grow up into him
[38:41] Christ in all things comes right back
[38:44] that he might feel all things and so
[38:46] therefore I hope you can see just
[38:47] perfectly how Paul has pinpointed this
[38:50] God's desire is that we would grow up
[38:52] into him in all things he has ascended
[38:55] on high and gives these gifts that we
[38:57] might might be built up into him in all
[39:00] things which is the head even Christ
[39:03] from whom the whole body fitly joined
[39:05] together and compacted by that which
[39:06] every joint supplieth according to the
[39:07] effectual working in the measure of
[39:08] every part maketh increase of the body
[39:11] under the edifying of itself in
[39:15] love the use of these phrases in love in
[39:18] chapter 4 are not arbitrary they're very
[39:20] intentional but if I could just
[39:22] summarize it this way the purpose of the
[39:24] Holy Spirit living in you is to bring
[39:26] you to maturity
[39:27] it's to cause us to grow up to the image
[39:29] and the stature of Christ says may grow
[39:32] up into him in all things all things
[39:36] it's the whole it's everything that's
[39:39] what all things
[39:41] means in Hebrews chapter 1 ver2 hath in
[39:44] these last days spoken unto us by his
[39:46] son whom he hath appointed heir of All
[39:49] Things by whom also he made the worlds
[39:52] Christ who is the perfect man in whom we
[39:56] are fitted together and we are to come
[39:58] into the stature of
[40:00] Christ of whom we are the body
[40:03] of this son has been appointed heir of
[40:06] all things this is the one that were to
[40:09] grow up into him in All
[40:11] Things Revelations 21:7 he that
[40:13] overcometh shall inherit all things and
[40:15] I will be his God and he shall be my
[40:17] son I use these scriptures to say that
[40:20] if we are going to inherit all things we
[40:22] need to grow up into him in all things
[40:25] it's the very purpose of Ephesians
[40:27] chapter four that we may grow up into
[40:29] him in all things why because he has
[40:31] appointed heir of all things and as
[40:33] children of God we are joint HS with
[40:34] Christ and he that overcomes shall
[40:36] inherit all things so in order to
[40:38] inherit all things we must grow up into
[40:40] him in all
[40:42] things when that which is perfect the
[40:45] part is done away the time of all things
[40:48] the fullness of all things grow up it
[40:50] means to increase means to cause to grow
[40:52] to augment to increase to become greater
[40:55] we must grow up increase
[40:57] into him says of John the Baptist in
[41:00] Luke 1:80 and the child grew and whacked
[41:03] strong in spirit and was in the deserts
[41:04] till the day of his showing unto Israel
[41:07] the child grew it means he grew up this
[41:10] is a word that's used of Youth of
[41:12] children babes growing up the child grew
[41:15] and whack strong in spirit when it says
[41:18] we grow up into him in All Things Paul
[41:20] uses the word that expressly indicates
[41:23] from the the first generation of and
[41:27] animation of life to adulthood says it
[41:30] of Jesus Christ in Luke 2:40 and the
[41:33] child grew and whack strong in spirit
[41:34] filled with wisdom and the grace of God
[41:36] was upon them should that not also be
[41:39] the mark and characteristic of us who
[41:41] are born again that we would grow the
[41:43] child grew in wax strong in spirit that
[41:45] we as children of God would grow in
[41:47] waack strong in spirit filled with
[41:48] wisdom and the grace of God being upon
[41:50] us that we may grow up into him is the
[41:53] same word that's used of John the
[41:55] Baptist growing up before he was
[41:57] presented to Israel Jesus Christ a child
[41:59] growing up as a child and Jesus when he
[42:03] gives the parable of the sewer in Mark
[42:04] chapter 4 verse 8 and those on the good
[42:07] ground he said did yield fruit that
[42:08] sprang up and increased grew up and
[42:11] brought forth some 30 some 60 and some
[42:14] 100 we know that the seed is the
[42:17] word that the full word is what grows
[42:20] this word is what grows and increase not
[42:23] just a seed not just green not just a
[42:26] sapling
[42:27] but ripen come to maturity the child
[42:30] grew the seed increased that's the same
[42:33] that's the image that Paul's trying to
[42:34] create when he says that we may grow
[42:38] up in Acts chap 6:7 it says and the word
[42:42] of God
[42:43] increased and the number of the
[42:44] disciples multiplied in Jerusalem
[42:46] greatly and the great a great company of
[42:48] the priests were obedient to the faith
[42:51] this is the book of
[42:53] Acts and I say another Branch will do
[42:55] the same
[42:57] and this is one of the to me one of the
[42:59] most singular greatest aspects of the
[43:01] book of Acts is the word of God
[43:04] increased there's a lot of things in the
[43:06] book of Acts that we could find in other
[43:09] places in the Bible there's a lot of
[43:11] things that we could find in the book of
[43:12] Acts in other religions and other areas
[43:15] but there's one thing you can't find
[43:16] anywhere in any other religion but is
[43:18] singular to the church and singular to
[43:21] the book of Acts and that's the word of
[43:22] God increased the word of God increased
[43:26] it's the same word it grew
[43:27] same word used in in Ephesians grow up
[43:30] the same word used in Luke 1 and chapter
[43:32] 2 grow up the the same word used in Mark
[43:34] 4 increased the word of God increased he
[43:37] uses again in chapter 12 acts 12:24 but
[43:39] the word of God grew and
[43:42] multiplied listen if there's going to be
[43:44] another book of Acts written it must
[43:46] have this characteristic that it is the
[43:49] word of God that is growing the and in
[43:52] our youth and our enthusiasm and the
[43:54] Holy Spirit pouring out yes it'll be
[43:56] there because it was in the book of Acts
[43:58] but after these things happened what
[44:00] demonstrated the fact that they had
[44:01] tasted that the Lord was gracious was
[44:03] that the works were there and the word
[44:07] grew amen and
[44:10] multiplied and that's what the word is
[44:12] doing in our lives as we grow up into
[44:15] him the word revealed what is it it's
[44:17] the eating of the book it's the feeding
[44:19] on the son of man the revealing of the
[44:21] word Works to mature our
[44:24] character in Romans 8: 29 for whom he
[44:27] did Forno he also did predestinate right
[44:30] to be conformed to the image of his son
[44:33] that he might be the first born among
[44:35] many Brethren it's characterized as the
[44:37] firstborn from the dead prior earlier
[44:39] and we were reading here he's the first
[44:41] born among many Brethren he was the only
[44:43] begotten Son of God not anymore because
[44:45] now there's many others who have been
[44:46] begotten and now he is our elder brother
[44:49] this principle of the firstborn is
[44:50] crucial to understanding certain
[44:52] teachings the first born among many
[44:54] Brethren that means there's going to be
[44:55] many others that are born of the father
[44:57] as he was born of the father conformed
[45:00] to the image of his
[45:03] son this is something that's not
[45:06] temporary this is something that's more
[45:08] inherent it's not just an external
[45:10] image the son was in God's image the son
[45:13] was in the image of the father now we
[45:15] are predestinated that's Destiny that's
[45:17] not birth it's
[45:18] Destiny when you were born again on the
[45:21] day that you were born again by the
[45:23] baptism of ghost you could say well I'm
[45:24] a Son of God every bit a Son of God I
[45:26] was a daughter of God but you have not
[45:28] yet come fully into the image of who you
[45:31] are there's a lot more that goes into it
[45:33] God's image the father was expressed in
[45:36] the son now those who are elected to a
[45:38] new birth who are forn therefore elected
[45:41] to a birth by forn knowledge there are
[45:43] seed of God to be born again now our
[45:45] destiny points to being conformed to the
[45:47] image of his
[45:49] son and image is not a look it's a
[45:53] life I think sometimes that's the way we
[45:55] think about it image is a is a look the
[45:58] image is that's when we think about the
[45:59] book of Acts it's the image right it's
[46:01] what it looks like but image is a life
[46:04] it's values it's a character it's the
[46:05] things that that really relate to the
[46:07] person remember Satan had the wrong
[46:09] image of God he had the optical image
[46:11] the Grandeur the bigness the the the the
[46:14] imposing mightiness of him and all the
[46:16] beauty but the beauty of God was his
[46:18] character and so the look is the image
[46:21] is not a look but it's a
[46:23] life so we are to be conformed to the
[46:25] image the life the character of Christ
[46:28] conformed to the character of Christ and
[46:31] it repeats it in Romans 12 1-2 I 1:2 I
[46:34] beseech you therefore Brethren by the
[46:35] mercies of God that you present your
[46:37] body as a Living Sacrifice holy
[46:39] acceptable to God which is your
[46:40] reasonable service we have not presented
[46:43] our bodies as a as a Living Sacrifice
[46:46] when we're born again we've offered up
[46:48] our hearts our souls we've offered our
[46:49] all but it's our soul that God takes and
[46:51] indwells us and now he's saying to you
[46:53] whove been regenerated by the baptism of
[46:54] the Holy Ghost present your bodies your
[46:56] mind mind and your your flesh present it
[46:59] to God as a Living Sacrifice holy accept
[47:02] God that's your reasonable service
[47:04] that's the least you ought to do it is
[47:06] what you're called to do and there he
[47:08] cautions be not conformed to this world
[47:10] this conforming to the world is that
[47:11] which is temporary and transitory and
[47:13] subject to change but be ye transformed
[47:15] which is permanent Eternal be
[47:18] transformed by the renewing of your
[47:21] mind not the renewing of your soul your
[47:23] soul has been born again it's been
[47:25] bought it's been purchased it's covered
[47:26] in the the shed blood of Jesus Christ
[47:28] the the spirit lives in you the inside
[47:30] teacher lives there now our minds are to
[47:33] be renewed and it's the renewing of our
[47:34] minds that gives the proof of what is
[47:37] good acceptable and perfect in the will
[47:40] of God only through the renewing of our
[47:43] minds can our lives be the proof of the
[47:46] perfect will of God only through the
[47:47] renewing of our spirits and our flesh
[47:49] that we can prove what is that good and
[47:51] acceptable and perfect will of God only
[47:52] as I yield as a blood bought Son of God
[47:55] only as I yield completely to him and
[47:57] allow him to have preeminence can my
[47:59] mind be renewed to transformation and my
[48:02] life can prove the perfect will of
[48:04] God brother brandom in the power of
[48:07] transformation says now that we have
[48:08] been saved as we are and that we have
[48:11] been filled with the Holy Ghost as we
[48:13] have there's some finality to that
[48:17] now that we have been saved as we are
[48:20] and that we have been filled the Holy
[48:22] Spirit as we have this is our have right
[48:25] next slide he says now we want the mind
[48:28] that was in Christ to be in us that we
[48:30] might be transformed from the Natural
[48:32] Things of life and be brought into to do
[48:34] the perfect will of God by
[48:36] transformation of God's spirit by his
[48:39] word this is it this is the marching
[48:41] orders this is what gives real purpose
[48:44] and meaning I can say as a young
[48:46] Christian and I began to serve the Lord
[48:48] it was when I it was awakened to me and
[48:50] I'll get maybe more into the specific
[48:52] subject of of what I was studying at the
[48:54] time 27 something years ago whatever it
[48:57] was that when it opened up to me I
[48:59] realize oh this gives me
[49:01] purpose I'm not just saved and just
[49:03] holding on for dear hope that I don't
[49:06] backslide I hope I don't go through
[49:07] another cycle I hope no it was like now
[49:09] there's re there's reason to live
[49:11] there's purpose to this Holy Ghost it
[49:13] was transformative for me initially in
[49:15] my thinking and we're to be transformed
[49:18] because we have the Holy Ghost now we
[49:20] want to have the mind of Christ now we
[49:22] want to be transformed from the Natural
[49:24] Things of life to be brought into to do
[49:26] the perfect will will of God through
[49:27] this process of transformation by God's
[49:29] spirit through his
[49:31] word this is the desire that Paul had in
[49:33] Galatians
[49:34] 4:19 chapter 4 and even around there you
[49:36] could say Paul is speaking on the
[49:38] subject of adoption you did run well who
[49:40] hindered you that you didn't fulfill all
[49:42] the will of God he's talking about
[49:43] maturity and how that he labored and
[49:45] desired to see a full growth of the word
[49:48] in them he says my little children of
[49:50] whom I travail and birth again until
[49:52] Christ be formed in you
[49:57] my my little children they are already
[49:58] birthed in the gospel they are already
[50:00] under his tutelage they they already
[50:02] begun in the race he says I travail
[50:05] until Christ be formed in you not
[50:08] through a birth because Christ is in The
[50:11] Believer by birth but Christ be formed
[50:13] formed that word to be formed in you
[50:14] means to manifest externally morphe is
[50:18] what it comes from that it be manifested
[50:20] externally in your attitude and your
[50:22] conduct and your behavior even in the
[50:23] way that you dress and the way you act
[50:25] but Christ be formed that he manifest
[50:28] amen he display his attributes through
[50:30] you
[50:32] amen it's that we would have the mind of
[50:35] Christ we're in that time where brother
[50:36] says it's forming into the head for the
[50:37] Rapture it's from that sheveport Series
[50:39] in ' 65 now it's in the head the top the
[50:43] peak for the Rapture he said this is not
[50:45] the day of Pentecost the Pentecostal age
[50:47] is passed Pentecost is gone this is
[50:49] Harvest Time and the Harvest Time the
[50:52] grain the waters done been poured out
[50:54] the grain's getting ripe good that's
[50:56] where we are it's harvest time it's in
[50:59] the head it's to grow up it's to mature
[51:03] Our Lives should be following the same
[51:05] pattern spiritually well what happens
[51:07] brother if I'm not if I don't fully
[51:09] understand this and fully understand
[51:10] that let's not worry about that let's
[51:12] just get in the process just yield to
[51:14] the
[51:15] process accept the fact that as a child
[51:18] of God you've been born again and and if
[51:19] you haven't I encourage you by all means
[51:22] seek forgiveness you know look into the
[51:24] Forgiveness of sins accept his
[51:26] forgiveness identified with the
[51:27] sacrifice call upon God to be saved a a
[51:30] and receive him as your savior be
[51:32] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[51:34] because you feel that that forgiveness
[51:35] of sins and know know that you know that
[51:38] he's promised you the baptism ghost be
[51:40] sure that you've received this
[51:41] indwelling of the Holy Spirit to be born
[51:42] again cuz you must be born
[51:46] again and then once you know that you're
[51:48] walk that you have this blessed
[51:50] experience we should just desire to walk
[51:52] to grow to
[51:54] increase let's not so much worry about
[51:56] the results cuz that's his process
[51:58] that's his job but let's worry about
[52:01] what we must do and let's yield to the
[52:03] process one of the things you look to in
[52:05] a child is whether or not they're
[52:06] stubborn or rebellious so they won't
[52:08] listen the stubbornness and Rebellion
[52:11] these sins of childhood and Adolescence
[52:14] indicate whether or not this son will
[52:15] ever learn whether or not he'll ever be
[52:17] able to follow in your steps whether or
[52:19] not he is going to be a proper child and
[52:22] so what we need to learn in this stage
[52:24] is to
[52:25] yield to oby
[52:27] obey in 1 John Chapter 2 I'll just skip
[52:30] to verse
[52:32] 5 I did not think I'd get this far but I
[52:34] know I've been going pretty fast
[52:36] today and so please forgive me if it was
[52:39] too
[52:40] fast but say who so keepeth his word in
[52:43] him verily is the love of God perfected
[52:45] hereby know we that we are in him when
[52:50] we obey when we keep his word this is
[52:52] the mark and characteristic of a child
[52:53] of God he obeys his
[52:55] father if I was to say right now son go
[52:57] get me a glass of water you know there's
[52:59] only three in this room that would do
[53:02] it and everybody's like right well I
[53:05] mean I I'm assuming only three would do
[53:06] it thanks brother the Lord I appreciate
[53:08] it but I'm referring
[53:09] to my sons would they would respond they
[53:11] would listen right they would identify
[53:14] with that and this is a mark and
[53:16] characteristic of a child of God they
[53:17] hear the voice they hear the shepherd's
[53:18] voice and they do another they will not
[53:20] follow they keep his word and the
[53:22] Beautiful part I know that I always joke
[53:25] around I know you remember perfectly you
[53:26] may not remember even the fact that we
[53:27] preached a series series of services on
[53:30] perfect love but in him VAR is a love of
[53:32] God perfected when we obey it means
[53:35] God's will for his love is working in us
[53:39] it's reaching its purpose our love for
[53:42] him it's purposeful when we do what he
[53:45] asked us to do our love for somebody
[53:47] else it means something and it matters
[53:50] when it changes our Behavior that's the
[53:52] beautiful part of Love Is there love is
[53:54] so outstanding that it it realizes even
[53:57] in situations where something may be
[53:59] unreasonable it'll act out of love for
[54:02] the person yes because it's love and
[54:05] then there's times that love won't act
[54:08] because of the person it knows this
[54:10] isn't what's
[54:11] best so when love is when we keep his
[54:14] word that's the love of God's that's the
[54:16] purpose we're beneficiaries of it and
[54:18] he's a beneficiary of the love that we
[54:20] have for him and it means the love of
[54:21] God is working in us and that's how we
[54:24] know that we are in him is when we obey
[54:26] it do love is perfected and then verse 6
[54:28] the reason why I use this
[54:30] passage he that saith he abideth in him
[54:33] ought himself also so to walk even as he
[54:37] walked he that says he's a Son of God
[54:40] ought to live as a Son of God lived he
[54:42] that says he abides in Christ ought to
[54:44] also live and act as Christ walked been
[54:47] thinking a lot lately about what would
[54:49] Jesus do and I've been thinking what
[54:51] would Jesus
[54:53] do because it really is the question
[54:56] anymore that when people were wearing
[54:58] those bracelets however many decades ago
[55:00] that was people had the what would Jesus
[55:02] do bumper stickers and the wjg uh on
[55:05] their bracelets and different things and
[55:07] you would observe their life and you'd
[55:08] say well if your life's the answer it
[55:10] means
[55:11] anything everything it's all fair
[55:15] game but he that saith he abideth in him
[55:18] ought to also walk as Christ walked that
[55:20] walk means make progress I have no
[55:22] greater desire than to see that my
[55:23] children walk in truth that doesn't mean
[55:25] accept truth but progress ress and Truth
[55:27] amen walking in the light watching more
[55:29] unfold this is the mark and
[55:31] characteristic of a real child of
[55:34] God 1 Peter 1: 13-16 he says wherefore G
[55:39] up the loins of your mind be sober and
[55:41] hope to the end for the grace that is to
[55:43] be brought unto you at the revelation of
[55:46] Jesus Christ as obedient children
[55:50] children who ought to themselves walk as
[55:53] their father walked walk as Christ
[55:58] walked and that walking as obedient
[56:00] children and the loins of our mind being
[56:03] girded up being sober hoping to the end
[56:06] for this grace to be brought as obedient
[56:08] children not fashioning yourselves
[56:09] according to the former lust in your
[56:11] ignorance you have been born again by
[56:13] the baptism the ghost he's revealing
[56:15] truth to you as a babe now we're not to
[56:17] Fashion ourselves like we did when we
[56:19] were in the world we're to
[56:20] change put off the old man put on the
[56:23] new man which is born a new but as he
[56:25] which had called you is Holy so be ye
[56:28] holy in all manner of life amen there's
[56:31] to walk as he walked progress
[56:34] grow the grace that is to be brought to
[56:37] us when we come to the Head the Capstone
[56:39] it comes crying Grace Grace what is the
[56:42] Capstone the perfecting the
[56:45] finishing as obedient children we're to
[56:48] Fashion ourselves after him in 2
[56:51] Corinthians 3: 17 to 18 now the Lord is
[56:54] that spirit and where the spirit of the
[56:55] Lord there is there is Liberty that's
[56:57] the whole ball game As Trump said it's
[57:00] the whole ball game he said two
[57:02] Corinthians though
[57:04] 3:17 but we all with open face beholden
[57:07] as in a glass a mirror the glory of the
[57:10] Lord right this is what it ought to be
[57:14] that we understand that's
[57:17] me we begin to understand when we look
[57:19] into the mirror of God's word that's
[57:21] me and seeing ourselves in the word when
[57:25] all obscure is removed when all darkness
[57:27] is removed when the spirit of Truth
[57:29] directs us to the word we will with open
[57:31] face Behold Him in a glass but see in
[57:33] ourselves that the image were to come
[57:35] into are changed into the same image
[57:37] from glory to glory even as by the
[57:38] spirit of the Lord this is our daily
[57:41] task is to look into the mirror of God's
[57:43] word and allow the glory that we see in
[57:45] the word reflect back upon us and change
[57:48] our Vis change our thinking change our
[57:50] lives to be changed from glory to glory
[57:53] by the spirit of the Lord that is what
[57:55] it means where the Spirit of the Lord
[57:56] there is Liberty to be changed where the
[57:58] spirit of the Lord is there's liberty
[57:59] for the glory of the Lord to make a
[58:01] change upon me not to make me feel good
[58:03] but to change my
[58:06] life brother Bram said in the unveiling
[58:08] of God the light over the word as the
[58:10] light of the sun changes the seed from
[58:12] glory to glory we also become more like
[58:14] him as we live in his presence like him
[58:16] being conformed to his blessed image as
[58:18] we walk with
[58:20] him we have to lay in the presence of
[58:22] the sun to get ripened amen light over
[58:25] the the word changes the seed from glory
[58:27] to glory light upon the seed of God in
[58:30] your soul will change the rest of your
[58:32] nature into his nature and one day we'll
[58:35] change your mortal body amen into a
[58:38] glorified
[58:39] body we're changed from glory to glory
[58:42] as we Behold Him in the word as the
[58:44] spirit of God operates in our lives
[58:46] we're not becoming more Sons we're
[58:48] becoming a son in His image we're
[58:51] growing we're increasing the child grew
[58:54] the fruit the seed
[58:57] sprang up and increase the word of God
[58:59] grew conformed to His Image transformed
[59:02] by the renewing of our minds grow up
[59:04] into him in all things growing in
[59:07] Grace in all things him having
[59:10] preeminence coming to the perfect man
[59:12] the measure and statute of fullness of
[59:14] Christ the word is replete over and over
[59:17] and over again that babes must grow to
[59:20] adulthood young ons must
[59:23] mature and Christ is it Christ is
[59:26] revealed in his own word been doing some
[59:28] study on this very beautiful things I'm
[59:30] finding down through the age we started
[59:32] off from the foundation from the first
[59:34] church age when the seed went into the
[59:35] ground the complete seed then it come
[59:37] through the feet Luther come back out
[59:39] through Wesley then into the
[59:40] Pentecostals the tongues in the lips
[59:42] it's the marking characteristic of the
[59:44] outpouring of the gifts the restoration
[59:46] of the gifts that Pentecostal age even
[59:47] in the L toen age the tongues see that's
[59:51] now it's in the eyes prophetic of
[59:54] Malachi 4 and so forth
[59:57] and now there's nothing else left for it
[59:59] to come but him himself to step into
[1:00:01] that because that's the last thing there
[1:00:03] is am the last thing is for him to step
[1:00:06] into it it it's language just describing
[1:00:09] what's taking place for him to step into
[1:00:11] it it's if I could put it this way
[1:00:13] there's nothing left but for him to be
[1:00:15] manifested for him to have PR for him
[1:00:18] the fullness of him that filth all and
[1:00:20] all to come to its Perfection to come to
[1:00:22] its Rapture to come to its ripeness to
[1:00:24] come to its Harvest said there's nothing
[1:00:25] left but him to come to step in the next
[1:00:28] he says is the intelligence that's him
[1:00:30] the intelligence the head not the
[1:00:32] tongues not the but the the not just the
[1:00:35] eyes but the
[1:00:36] intelligence to make sense of it all of
[1:00:39] what's being seen and what's being said
[1:00:41] the next is intelligence we have no
[1:00:42] intelligence of our own it's his we have
[1:00:44] no sight of our own how can a man
[1:00:45] foresee these things he can't do it it's
[1:00:47] God himself it's becoming to a place and
[1:00:51] he's governed the body all the way
[1:00:52] through every age is the age of the Holy
[1:00:54] Ghost for the True Believer it's always
[1:00:56] been the holy ghost in the church it's
[1:00:58] always been the baptism of the Holy
[1:00:59] Ghost the Son of God working in the
[1:01:00] church but now it comes in the last days
[1:01:02] where he's to come forth as the son of
[1:01:04] man manifested again God In the Flesh of
[1:01:07] his bride God In the Flesh of his people
[1:01:09] living out the word the life lived by
[1:01:11] the word being the word expressed he's
[1:01:13] governed it all the way through but now
[1:01:15] then the complete body of Christ is
[1:01:17] revealed in the form of a bride that was
[1:01:18] taken out of his side like Adams was at
[1:01:21] the
[1:01:22] beginning now when you when you read
[1:01:25] that
[1:01:26] there is so much scripture that we could
[1:01:28] begin to just build in our minds in this
[1:01:30] image of Adam and the woman in the
[1:01:33] beginning and how this
[1:01:36] reflected God's purpose his primary
[1:01:38] objective to have a bride of his
[1:01:39] choosing Heaven and Earth beautiful
[1:01:41] image and then Christ comes forth as the
[1:01:43] second Adam or the last Adam not just a
[1:01:46] living soul but a quickening spirit he
[1:01:48] is a new creature he is a new race super
[1:01:52] race he's not just Adam patched up it's
[1:01:55] something different now that God's plan
[1:01:57] foreshadowed he comes forth but he say
[1:02:00] that now the bride is to come forth and
[1:02:03] be the complete body of Christ that
[1:02:05] reveals what was hid in Christ the bride
[1:02:08] which is taken out of the sight of
[1:02:09] Christ taken out of Christ he says like
[1:02:11] Adam's wife was taken out of him at the
[1:02:14] beginning now if we go back to the
[1:02:16] beginning the scripture does not tell us
[1:02:18] that in when God brought man forth you
[1:02:21] found him a babe wrapped in swadding
[1:02:24] clothes lying in the manger
[1:02:27] Adam was made a fully grown adult
[1:02:30] male Adam was brought forth in flesh in
[1:02:34] placed in the garden with a commission
[1:02:38] Adam was not necessarily learning he was
[1:02:40] manifesting Adam was not L they been
[1:02:43] instructed he had the mind of God all
[1:02:44] the channels were clear God put him on
[1:02:46] Earth says it's yours have dominion run
[1:02:48] it the way you want hadam name all the
[1:02:49] animals and then brought forth this
[1:02:51] woman to bring forth all God to grow
[1:02:53] multiply and replenish the Earth and God
[1:02:55] just Fellowship with them God wasn't
[1:02:57] saying well
[1:02:59] Adam don't you think that should be a
[1:03:01] giraffe I mean seriously come on think
[1:03:03] about it no Adam did it Adam did not run
[1:03:07] around the garden saying in the name of
[1:03:09] God the father in the name of God the
[1:03:11] son right Adam just did it he was a
[1:03:15] fully placed adopted full grown adult
[1:03:17] male
[1:03:18] son and when the woman was brought forth
[1:03:22] and the brought and the man was brought
[1:03:23] to the woman Adam to go oh a cute little
[1:03:26] thing I'm going to marry you one day
[1:03:27] that's right I'm nope fully grown woman
[1:03:30] fully
[1:03:31] mature the woman came from him fully
[1:03:34] grown a fully grown adult female ready
[1:03:36] to fulfill the promise she was able and
[1:03:38] ready then right it was just a matter of
[1:03:42] timing but Jesus was a begotten Son of
[1:03:45] God Jesus was born a babe and what was
[1:03:48] he he was made perfect he was
[1:03:51] adopted and
[1:03:53] glorified and we are to come forth the
[1:03:56] same way the same process but we're to
[1:03:59] come to that place of adulthood and
[1:04:02] maturity where we can bring forth a
[1:04:04] place of
[1:04:18] placing musicians if you'd come we'll
[1:04:20] just end
[1:04:23] there I'll hold off on uh
[1:04:26] that Ephesians there brother John if you
[1:04:27] just want to bring it to that last quote
[1:04:30] from you must be born
[1:04:35] again go back and read Ephesians chapter
[1:04:38] 1 as we're reading Ephesians chapter
[1:04:41] 4 in love speaking the truth in love may
[1:04:44] grow up into him and that the body
[1:04:47] tempered together makes increase of
[1:04:49] itself in
[1:04:53] love he says in Ephesians chapter 1 that
[1:04:56] in love he predestinated us unto
[1:04:59] adoption I want you to start thinking
[1:05:01] about the subject of
[1:05:04] adoption brother B says this and you
[1:05:06] must be born again he said there are no
[1:05:09] shortcuts they want to come right
[1:05:12] quick they don't want to
[1:05:14] grow there is a an attitude of
[1:05:19] impatience sometimes even in
[1:05:21] Christianity even amongst those who
[1:05:23] maybe are emotional or
[1:05:25] given to those things they they they
[1:05:27] want it to come right quick they don't
[1:05:29] want to grow and he says we grow in the
[1:05:31] Lord it takes growth and
[1:05:34] experience tonight you're a sinner
[1:05:36] tomorrow you're manifested sons of God
[1:05:37] he says
[1:05:38] nonsense where do you get that in the
[1:05:41] word babies are not born men they're
[1:05:44] born babies and grotto men
[1:05:50] yes nothing wrong with being a
[1:05:53] baby nothing wrong with being a young
[1:05:55] and
[1:05:56] but there is something wrong if you
[1:05:57] don't grow up that's right would you
[1:06:00] agree there is something wrong if the
[1:06:02] word's not working mightily you can have
[1:06:04] all the characteristics and marks of a
[1:06:05] babe all the marks and characteristics
[1:06:07] of a young but if the word of God is not
[1:06:09] growing and increasing if it's not
[1:06:11] multiplying if it's not fruitful in your
[1:06:13] life it begs the
[1:06:15] question have you been born
[1:06:18] again the only kind of children that the
[1:06:21] world can bring forth and the church
[1:06:23] nomino can bring forth are dead right
[1:06:26] they cannot produce the life of the word
[1:06:29] they can produce a lot of things but
[1:06:30] they can't produce the growth of the
[1:06:32] word of God Amen and this is a question
[1:06:34] that you must be satisfied within
[1:06:36] yourself is to know that his word is
[1:06:38] working mightily in
[1:06:39] me and I have been thinking this quite a
[1:06:42] bit as we've been ministering on this
[1:06:43] subject even over the last month or so
[1:06:46] that I'm hoping that in this there's a
[1:06:48] Grace that's being ministered to
[1:06:49] recognize there's a reason why we've
[1:06:51] made mistakes that we've made reason why
[1:06:53] we continue to make mistakes is we're
[1:06:54] still growing yes it it's not just a
[1:06:57] song for the Sunday school he's still
[1:07:00] working on me ain't it interesting that
[1:07:02] those who aren't even born again usually
[1:07:04] are the one singing it when in
[1:07:06] reality it's us that he's really working
[1:07:10] on I mean our our kids could sing he's
[1:07:14] still working on me talking about their
[1:07:17] dad to make me what he wants me to be
[1:07:21] right but then God when we're born again
[1:07:23] we say he's still working on me he he's
[1:07:25] not finished with me yet I there one
[1:07:28] thing I've said I think I've maybe said
[1:07:29] it here before that if you look at my
[1:07:32] children and you and you and you see
[1:07:35] things in them and you're you're
[1:07:36] disappointed and you judge me as a
[1:07:38] father that's fine that's fine you have
[1:07:40] every right to do that but I ask that
[1:07:42] you not judge them as a
[1:07:44] son and don't judge them as a daughter
[1:07:47] because you ain't seen them yet you may
[1:07:50] see a lot of me you may see a lot of my
[1:07:51] mistakes and a lot of my lack of
[1:07:53] faithfulness and there may be
[1:07:54] conclusions you can make about me as a
[1:07:56] 49y old man but I said don't judge them
[1:07:58] yet cuz he's not
[1:07:59] done and I want God to have a chance
[1:08:02] with them and I say that to give a Grace
[1:08:04] to all of us to realize there's reasons
[1:08:07] why we've gone the way that we've gone
[1:08:08] there's reasons why we've made mistakes
[1:08:10] and it's not because we weren't seed
[1:08:11] it's not because we're not elected it's
[1:08:12] not because we're not his children it's
[1:08:14] because we're still
[1:08:15] learning and maybe today we could say
[1:08:17] Lord I want to I want to learn better I
[1:08:21] want to grow I'll be transparent there's
[1:08:24] different junctures in my life life when
[1:08:25] I look at him that God moved me through
[1:08:28] great suffering and tremendous
[1:08:30] loss turbulence and some of the worst
[1:08:33] difficult times I've ever been through
[1:08:34] my life have have preceded
[1:08:37] transition and I've wondered God can you
[1:08:40] not just tell me what you're want to do
[1:08:42] you me to do like show up when
[1:08:44] everything's just perfect and say Aaron
[1:08:46] I'd like you to do this and I'm like
[1:08:48] perfect right and everything just goes
[1:08:50] smoothly but he has a way of wearing us
[1:08:52] down and tearing things apart and
[1:08:55] putting us in a place and he's teaching
[1:08:57] us to trust and we go through things and
[1:08:59] you know as much as I'd like to say I've
[1:09:00] been a perfect Son of God I've only
[1:09:02] always obeyed his will and if there's
[1:09:05] anybody in the Bible who can relate to
[1:09:06] me it's job or
[1:09:08] Jesus right I've only suffered according
[1:09:11] to God's will but you know the reality
[1:09:13] is I brought a lot on myself and I'm so
[1:09:16] grateful that I'm his son because he's
[1:09:18] never given up on me you realize there's
[1:09:21] something about bringing forth a child
[1:09:23] in this world that no matter what
[1:09:24] happens they can change their name they
[1:09:25] can change their gender do alls of stuff
[1:09:28] but they'll never they'll never stop
[1:09:30] being your child they're always your
[1:09:33] child that's the way God feels about you
[1:09:37] there's not an adoption in God's mind
[1:09:39] where he says you know what I made a
[1:09:40] huge mistake when I adopted you you're
[1:09:42] crazy and try to reverse the process
