TRANSCRIPT
========================================
as we continue in kind of the theme of the house of the Lord and drawing from the different types and shadows uh from the Tabernacle and the temple and how that extends to us as individuals the New Testament Tabernacle the New Testament Body of Christ or Temple of the Lord and how that that comes down to us being uh part of that as well as individuals as extension of our families and even our church my title today is where his name dwells where his name dwells I'm drawing it from there in verse um 11 primarily and I put this title slide together this particular slide together uh at the outset just to create kind of a word picture so that you could have this in your mind where the scripture is where his name dwells as we're drawing that title that's our title but then this caricature of modern day Christianity where there's a billboard in front of a house that says Jesus and so it's it's signaling something it's identifying something and I'd like to even though I may not hold this theme throughout as far as using these words but this character versus character and how that there's certain things that uh are just characters or just message theaters I like to use that phrase it's things that just try to put off pretense or heirs and it's no more than just a billboard with the name on it trying to signify something or sell something versus where his name dwells and what that would mean and that means character and so we're revisiting um some recurring themes and um and going back over many things that we're already very very familiar with and some subjects that we've already covered but I just feel this it's this particular subject of character so important to visit now if you look at verse 11 where we just read I'd like to start with this because this will help describe uh where his name dwells versus the billboard with the name Jesus on it it says in verse 11 then there shall be a place which the Lord your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there thither shall you bring all that I command you your burnt offerings and your sacrifices your tithes and the heave offering of your hand and all your choice vows which you vow unto the Lord this is where we get that phrase where his name dwells and the phrasing uh is very direct the place that God chooses to cause his name to dwell so it's very deliberate in the phrasing that the Lord your God shall choose a place where his name will dwell that dwell means to settle or to reside it's to become fixed in so it's where God would be it's where his name would be called upon so his name would be invoked he would be praised he would be worshiped so when he says where I will cause my name to dwell it's where God is that being where God is it's where you call upon the Lord being where God is that's where you would worship and you would bring your burnt offerings your sacrifices your tithe your heave offering of your hand all your vows you would bring before the Lord in this place this Tabernacle which became a Temple and so it is called by his name because it is his dwelling and that's use of the phrase his name we're kind of getting into what an idea of a name is but it's called by his name because it's his house it's where he dwells this is the house of the Lord so it would carry his name or it would be called by his name so his name is attached to it be in his house and it be in his house it must have certain prerequisites and certain characteristics so if you look at verse one one it says these are the statutes and judgments which you shall observe to do in the land which the Lord God of thy fathers giveth thee to possess it all the days that you live upon the Earth ye shall utterly destroy all the places wherein the Nations which you shall possess serve their gods upon the high mountains and upon the hills and under every Green Tree and you shall overthrow their altars and break their pillars and burn their Groves with fire you shall heue down the graven images of their gods and destroy the names of them out of that place so the name is associated with something there it it evokes something it embodies something so there's to be a removal destroy the name from that place destroy all its elements all its forms of worship and he says ye shall not do so unto the Lord your God now he's connecting these forms of worship to how they're to Worship the Lord but unto the place which the Lord your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there even even unto his habitation shall you seek and thither shalt Thou come and thither ye shall bring your burnt offerings and your sacrifices and your tithes and heave offerings of your hand and your vows and your free will offerings and the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks and there ye shall eat before the Lord your God and you shall rejoice in all that you put your hand unto ye and your households wherein the Lord thy God hath blessed thee I'm looking at this as characteristics and prerequisites in that all other places of worship were to be destroyed anything that had a form of idolatry was to be removed anything that was from a prior way of worship or tradition alone was to be cast down and he says you shall not do so unto the Lord your God in other words you could not blend the worship of these heathens you could not blend the worship of these other nations in with the worship of their God if there was a Grove that was planted if there was an altar a and and trees that were used for worship and for a temple and for sacrifice CH he was saying you can't just go into this country and then begin to worship the one true God using all the instruments and locations and all the traditions of false worship thinking oh if we just invoke his name even though we've changed some uh we haven't changed much we just use the new name that that'll satisfy he says you can't do this to your lord God you couldn't mix other forms of worship you couldn't bring in other ideas as it says in verse 8 ye shall not do after all the things that we do he this day every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes for you are not yet has yet come to rest and to The Inheritance which the Lord your God giveth you the ways of Egypt and the ways of the Wilderness wouldn't work in the promised land how that God even had to deal with them in Egypt and how God had to deal with them in in the wilderness those ways would not work in the promised land and he says you can't do what you're doing now where every man's ways are right in his own eyes whether it be his forms of work worship as forms of dedication and sacrifice it this would this could not be carried over into the promised land even acknowledging right now in the wilderness things are a little bit different but once you cross over into your rest once you're into the land of promise you can't take what you've left with you and you can't try to simulate what was just what was there and you got dispossessed into your worship we take from this as brother bradam does in the sermons he preaches on this subject there was only one place that the shik glory would dwell there's only one place that God would make home and the Bible is telling us it's not just a place where God would be but it's also inviting us to come and it's a place where we would eat not in the holy of holies but in the outer Court a place of eating for all those that would bring their vows and their sacrifices a place of rejoicing there would be Fellowship there would be forgiveness there would be praise worship giving you could see by all these things that are expressed that it it wasn't just oh there's where God dwells high on a hill but it'd be place that others would gather to and they would be able to give they would be able to serve they'd be able to eat they'd be able to rejoice and worship in verse 12 it says and ye shall rejoice before the Lord your God ye and your sons and your daughters and your menservants and your maid servants and the levite that is within your gates for as much as he ha no part nor inheritance with you this is a place of rejoicing a place that the families were to gather together the tribes all uh shared things in common though they would have different position s in different places and different callings this is one place where they could all assimilate and worship God together now if you look at verse five it says but under the place which the Lord your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there even unto his habitation it says shall you seek and thither shalt thou Thou shalt come so it's a place that you must seek not the Groves not the altars not the guards not the high places not the things of the past not going out to the Wilderness not going back to Egypt but this place that God shall choose out of your tribes to put his name there now there's some mystery to this by him alluding to the fact that I will choose but as to where we don't know as to which tribe it's not yet detailed here but it's a place that we should seek and it's the place that we would come it's this place this is where he would place his Tabernacle in other words this is where he would uh take up residence it was where he would cause his glory to dwell as the the root of these words speak of the kind the Tabernacle it's where his glory would dwell but he chooses this phrasing twice in here this place to put his name or to cause his name to dwell there this is an appalation as a Mark or as something as a memorial of identification so a name is a mark of identification or a memorial of identification so this name has an identity or it's to identify something and it is a place in the the root of this word uh that's used the Shem as it speaks it's a place that you would find God's honor his authority and his character this is what's thought of in the shim in the name it's a place it it speaks of one's honor their Authority and their character so when God says I'm going to cause my name to dwell there we can't just simply think of a mark this isn't a trademark we can't think of it as just a symbol but yet it speaks it symbolizes and identifies God and identifying God it identifies whatever his characteristics are his honor his authority and his character in the New Testament the Greek word anoma is a word is used of name and its roots are in knowledge and understanding so a name has the ability or ought to carry with it convey some understanding and convey some knowledge as there's some languages whose words are very descriptive and in the name itself it describes to you the thing or the person the same should be said of a name where that when you say it it gives understanding it gives knowledge the name is used for everything which the name covers so think of how important a name would be because you'd use a name and you just wouldn't want to you not just saying hey bud or hey dude it's not just so much to get someone's attention but if you used a name that name ought to carry some weight with it or have something behind it to where you knew by the name that this land dwells to this family or that we're of the this tribe or we're of this identification and it would it would carry history it would carry present possessions so everything the name covers everything that comes to mind or how you feel when the name is mentioned or when you hear the name it's everything that would come to mind in how you would feel when you say the name it's everything that would come to mind and how you'd feel when you hear the name that's what's behind the name the name of the Old Testament would speak of Honor Authority character and identification in the New Testament it would speak of one's position their Authority their possessions their interest their Pleasures H uh their their how excellent they were their all these different the things that they've done their personality this would be bundled up in the name and we know from the message that the name invokes a person's character that a name characterizes a person it characterize the nature of a person's life I know that this it might seem uh I I don't know if sometimes we back into it but there's something to a name and we're taught that brother Bry talks about be careful what you name your children because there's something there's something to a name and that's what I'm want you to think about not so much how that a name would take on meaning but how the name has meaning that would God says I'll cause my name to dwell there that we should be thinking deeper than just a mark thinking deeper than just um this the arrangement of syllables with the prefix or suffix and we should be thinking more than just phonics when we think of a name but it evokes a person's character and the nature of a person's life a person's name is their reputation that's right a person's name is their testimony that's right if I if I could say this way the name is the logos that that the the reputation and test are the logos that the name is carrying so you say you say you could give a name but the real understanding of that name is in the reputation the testimony the character the honor the authority there is a logos to the name there's something understood by there's something meant and intended by it and that's what God is saying he says I will cause my name to dwell there in 2 Chronicles 6:33 this is just another scripture that describes this residence and habitation but then brings us to the name then hear thou from the heavens even from thy dwelling place and do according to all that the stranger cth to thee for that all the people of the earth may know thy name and fear thee notice how this is showing where God dwells and his name that may know and fear thee as do thy People Israel it may know that this house which I have built is called by thy name but words of Solomon has he's trying to identify that this place where you dwell it's a place where we will know your name where we'll fear thee and that all may fear you and know that this house is called by thy name that you're taking if it were that phrase alone the house of the Lord if it's not a specific name if we can't get more desri descriptive than that is to say this is where the one true God is this is where the real one it's a place that he identifies himself with it is a habitation of his presence these themes have been expressed multiple times this year already in this series but it says it's a place called by his name where his name dwells now fast forward in quite a bit in a study of this or even what I would consider to be an appropriate sermon on this part I'm going to skip into the middle of another part in John chapter 5: 43 Jesus says I am come in my father's name and you receive me not if another shall come in his own name him you sh will receive so one coming in his own authority his own honor his own character you would receive him a man that is looking only to himself and self-promotion comes on his own authority he's saying you'll receive him so this is quite the rebuke but he says I'm come in my father's name and he's not hiding anything about who his father was he's not talking about Joseph he's talking about God I come in my father's name I am from above you are from beneath I am from I am come in my father's name now we might think oh he is carrying then oh now we know what his dad's name was his name is his name was Jesus and that somehow we've now the the name of God's been revealed but that would be that wouldn't quite convey what Jesus is actually meaning because to them Joshua or Jehovah is savior is a name that would have been heard before and it wasn't so much a new name so no matter if someone carried that name and may have been a prophet or a teacher or a great person who might have forshadowed Christ or spoke of Christ he said now I am come in the fullness of my father father's name not just a mark and not just a memorial but a very clear identification of his honor his authority and his character that now when you hear the name Jesus you can ascribe the appropriate Excellence to it that now when you hear the name Jesus that there are certain thoughts and feelings that must be aroused to mind that when you speak the name Jesus there are certain things that should be focused on and be clear to you when you say it amen brother Bram said Jesus Christ is the only place that you'll ever find fellowship and worship to God so if we could draw from the Old Testament Tabernacle and Temple is the one place that God chose to place his name is the one place that he chose to dwell and it was that one place where sacrifices to be were to be offered it was the one place that three times a year the Jews would have to fall back to it was the one place that God was so adamant about that he actually carved out exceptions if it was impossible to make it there to sacrifice it was that important God put his name in Jesus Christ just as he was saying it about the temple and it was his name would dwell there now we have the name of the Lord Jesus Christ God put his name in Jesus Christ and it's of Greater significance this helps us understand better what this name means it we know it means more than just a nominator a mark in itself an appalation as Jesus says in John 17:26 I have declared unto them thy name and will declare it that the love where thou Hast loved me may be be may be in them and I in them I have declared unto them Thy Name Jesus did not go around uh Judea with a a great reveal as there's genda reveals are really popular these days and make great viral videos Jesus wasn't just uh doing a name reveal over and over again and say is everybody ready to know the name of God and then he pulls back the curtain everybody's like he's saying that I have declared thy name and it wasn't saiding I'm going to let you in on a secret I'm a junior and I have his name and my name is Jesus and his name is Jesus that that would have been that misses the mark what Jesus means he says I have declared unto them thy name I have made known the name of God in that I have represented to you accurately his nature amen that I have revealed to you perfectly his character that in my teaching and in my acting and in my speaking I am demonstrating to you and revealing to you the perfect will of God for those things I speak my father has spoken those things I do my father has shown me therefore when I have declared unto you the name of God or the name of my father I've declared unto them thy name I come in my father's name I have unfolded and manifested to to you God the Bible says in John 1:18 no man hath seen God at any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he hath declared him I think it's remarkable in that if we take into uh consideration the instances where God was made visible in the Old Testament if we could use that even when Moses said let me see let me see your glory and God hid him in a place and God passed by and Moses saw uh uh the backside of God and how Moses even coming face to face with the glory of God as it were on the mountain in a burning bush in these instances where a man beheld some representation or manifestation of God so this sentence uh we we should kind of unpack it maybe next year in homeschool you guys can diagram this it says no man hath seen God at any time no man completely takes in and knows God at a glimpse right yes exactly though we could argue that well Moses saw God but no man has seen God at any time our house is falling down did that just happen okay things are falling apart don't look now we're working on another balcony no man have seen God at any time you just don't see the backside of God and say you know him you don't just hear his name Jesus Jesus and say I got him no man has seen God at any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father leaking him to the heart the nature and character of God he hath declared him it means he you have to take all of Christ the word even speaks is to unfold a as a narrative he was a source of understanding God he was a source of knowing god the knowledge of God not just in a glimpse oh I saw him walk on water oh I saw him multiply the Loaves and fish no that that wouldn't say enough it says something about him but he has declared him because Jesus Christ was the living manifestation of God who as he lived and as he spoke you knew more about God Amen his thoughts his actions his words made God clear that if you heard him speak you say that came from the heart of God you saw him react you'd say there's another part of God when you saw him show have compassion there's the compassion of God when he showed Mercy there's the mercy of God when he showed judgment that's the Judgment of God when he all these things that he did you say I'm am understanding better who God Is by The Living Word that makes God present Jesus Christ Jesus Christ is the Son of God to a Hebrew son the word Ben it speaks of the the word Ben it's the builder of the family name a son scripturally is the multiplication of the father that the son is to bring forth an image of the father he's to to uh multiply the the image the nature and the character of the father Ben and using as a prefix the son of like barjona and the places you would see the son of it's the when you're the son of Jonas or you're the son of this or the son of that you're the Builder of that name as the son so Jesus declared the father as the son he declared the father as the son it it's not that you need to figure out who God is and then once you know who God is you're going to back you can figure out who the son is the son tells us who the father is it's the only way to know him so as the son he manifested the father's glory and just as the Tabernacle and Temple were the place where God's glory would dwell now Jesus Christ is the perfect fulfillment of what the house of the Lord represented brother bam writes this in the church age book chapter 5 God who on occasions would manifest his presence by the cloud or a pillar of fire that struck fear in the hearts of men this God whose heart characteristics now focus on that phrase heart characteristics were made known only by revelation of words through the prophets so in the Old Testament you would only know characteristics of God's heart his will his attitude his Justice his judgment his Mercy as Revelation came to the prophet and the prophet spoke it and that would at the very minimum disclose to you God's attitude towards something at the time or what God would do at a later date and all of it becoming this Menagerie or this picture that is slowly developing over time as to who God is but he say now this God became Emmanuel God With Us declaring himself so the one that you would catch glimpses of in the prophet as they re received a revelation from God and spoke these words and his heart characteristics were known at these different glimpses he now becomes God With Us and it's God declaring himself the word declare is taken from the Greek root which we often interpret as exis which means to thoroughly explain and make clear this exy is of the of the declare Declaration this is me speaking it means I have thoroughly explained and made clear to you God he should not be confused he should not be muddled up he should not be misunderstood though you may not be able to explain it if it's Christ it's him it's God that's just who he is that is what the Living Word Jesus did he brought God to us for he was God he revealed to us he revealed God to us with such perfect clarity that John could say about him in 1 John 1 veres 1 to3 now hear this that which was from the beginning which we have heard yes there's the logos that which is the a speech which we have seen with our eyes which we've looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that ye Also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son Jesus Christ brother BR writes to this when God was truly revealed he was manifested in the flesh amen Believers will see it not everyone will see it well Believers will see it and he says he that hath seen me quoting the scripture now hath seen the father am that's right I've been with you in Flesh and Blood I've been with you in eating and drinking and sleeping and tearing and traveling and he say show us the father and he says have I been so long with you that you don't know the father when you've seen me you've seen the father that doesn't mean when you saw a picture right you couldn't follow Jesus on Instagram and I know some of you thinking he wouldn't be on that platform he'd be on Snap or Tik Tok maybe he kept Vine he resurrected Vine and he you said you couldn't just get 60 second Snippets you couldn't just get 140 or 60 characters you couldn't be following him on X and feel like you really knew him just in these Snips and snaps but he's saying I am you've been I've been with you so long so he wasn't castigating him that Phillip like the first time you laid laid eyes on me you saw the father they said as I've been with you this is what you're supposed to know this is what I my purpose is as I've been with you you have been communing with and fellowshipping with the father amen Hebrews chap 1: 1 to4 making such good time every place is available for lunch today it's it's going to be it's going to be perfect you're going to have your choice Hebrews chap 1: 1:4 God who at sunry times and in diverse manner spake in time passed unto the fathers by the prophets this is what brother bradam in some ways is summarizing or we could substantiate what brother Bram is saying by this that God's heart characteristics were made known as the prophet spoke the word that was given to them God spake by the prophets but verse two hath in these last days spoken to us by his son whom Heath appointed heir of All Things by whom also he made the worlds there's a mouthful who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person there's another mouthful and upholding All Things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high there's a lot that goes into this a lot that you could meditate on God spoke by prophets who revealed in these uh instances heart characteristics of God but now he is spoken by his son who is the expressed image of God who upholds all things by the word of his power by himself purged our sins and now he's at the right hand of majesty on high it's telling us just trying to paint a picture of who Jesus Christ is being made so much better than the angels as he hath by inheritance attained a more excellent Name than they amen the Angels were created by God the Angels worshiped by God but these Angels were not Sons these angels though they may have brought messages to the prophets and brought messages from God as that should be looked at appropriately to verse one that God in sunry times and diverse maners spake to unto the fathers by the prophets that there were angels that brought messages and there was God was being revealed or his word was made known through these Messengers but now he's given him a more excellent Name than that of the Angels why Christ is where God put his name as I said already he was the manifestation of God this has implications today because you can only worship God in Christ today this name that is spoken of here as Heath by inheritance obtained a more excellent Name this name arises from Christ's nature he has a more excellent Name he has obtained a more excellent name because it not only arises from his relationship to God as son but arises from the nature that was expressed to through him as son he was declared to be God's son and that he and then so being declared to be God's son oh he's he's a b he's a builder of the father name father's name oh he's a son he's going to give a reputation and testimony of who God is but that can be bad sometimes there there's uh I can imagine just how often maybe our parents cringe when it's like oh you're a migiri right and immediately they begin to think about the meiri boys and they make make a name and a testimony and they think when well we we knew you're you're meari as the the white wizard who had been converted or the one that loved rubber duckies or whatever it is they might have some sort of image of portrayal of the of the father but then the boys begin to live their life and it gives the N the family name new meaning right I had to wait till I had family here to witness this to share this but you know what I mean that you can say oh well he's a mcari and somebody who knows different sides of the mcari family would' be like which one hey which which nature of mcari is it because there's a name that's associated with the nature so he was not just the Son of God but he accurately portrayed God yes so therefore he obtained a more excellent name because he manifested that he was the son of God by his life amen by his words by his teachings by his abstinence by where he went he was showing God's heart at the pull of Bethesda if he would have just healed everybody then we could say that was God's will but he didn't so he was showing us something about God's compassion when he went into the temple and turn turned over the tables he said you've made my house of den of Thieves he was speaking something about the Zeal of God the Zeal of my house hath eaten me up as the prophecy was he was knowing and declaring God's heart at every turn if I could say this when you read of Christ and you learn of Christ it's something safe to just take in all of it all of it and it exposes how deadly it is when one tries to change Christ either by adding to or taking away or preaching a Jesus that doesn't exist because Jesus Christ is the only way to know God it's the only place to worship God and Jesus Christ even as we look at him in the Book of John as these different ref says I've come in thy name Heath declared him and declared unto them thy name he was the perfect manifestation of God by words actions Deeds response restraint you name it he declared God's heart and the house of the Lord was to be the same thing in type the house of the Lord was to be the same thing as a shadow of Christ which was to come it was a place that was to reflect as the way the place where I will cause my name to dwell it was to reflect God's character and he was going to do it through his glory through his presence in Philippians chap 2: 99-1 it's speaking of Jesus Christ wherefore God also hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name we're talking about reputation talking about testimony to about honor Authority character not a name the Lord Jesus Christ as as a Mark or appalation think of it as there's more to it there's more to it than just a a nominator say oh he's given them a name which is above every name listen I think we have to be very careful maybe I could say it this way it's a Razor's Edge where there's some who use the name as a seance and they use it as as it's unlocking some key that no matter what's happened Jesus right and and even this colloquialism we might use I speak Jesus well what did you mean by that or we sing it and we're invoking a name we're forming the words and the phrase Jesus and and we think oh there's power in that name but do you realize in other tongues it doesn't even sound that way so we could think and this is just commentary on the American mindset we think so much so much about America that when there is an eclipse here the Rapture is happening right but when there's a when the the moon the sun is dark for 20 seconds in America this is a sign from God not knowing that it happens almost on a regular intervals year after year and before it happens here the next time it's going to happen dozens of times or a dozen times before it happens here again and I guess if we lived on a tiny island in the Pacific Ocean we'd be like the gods are coming right and we would think it to be a sign but we get so American Centric and if we're not careful we can get so English Centric on Jesus the name and we've deluded it to just a mark we've trademarked the name Jesus and we don't realize the power behind that name what it represents to where it's some something so precious that people can unrighteously partake in it God hath highly exalted him and given a name which is above every name that is that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in Earth and things under the Earth at the name of Jesus now I'm not wanting you to get hung up on the pronunciation I'm not wanting you to get hung up on the hard J sound or the the smooth Su I'm not wanting you to so much think in terms of English and how you pronounce his name but at the name of Jesus at the testimony and reputation of Jesus just as those demons say in the name of Paul in the name of Jesus of Nazareth says Jesus we know Paul we know but what reputation do you have what kind of testimony do you have there's nothing that's symmetrical to what the name represents your name could be Jesus and you could be invoking the name of Jesus Christ and that doesn't create the Symmetry but it's the character it's the life it's the honor it's the authority it's the power at that name every knee should bow of things in Heaven and Earth and under the Earth that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father you got to get that right where the glory is going to ultimately because at the name of Jesus he's highly exalted him and given him a name and he's obtained by inheritance a more excellent name so what wasn't he given that name well he's a builder of the name Christ had never come we could still be living today waiting for the Messiah and having people today named Jesus and Joshua and false christs but it's Christ who now shows us who God is believe it or not I'm at a stopping point Proverbs Chapter 2 ver 22 verse1 a good name is rather to be chosen than great riches God in bu in speaking of a tabernacle and a temple it is a place where I will cause my name to dwell if we were told with absolute Authority that there was only one God and that he dwelt somewhere then that would give us reverence for that place us believing in a one true God he said I will cause my name to dwell there that speaks something to us this is a precious place this this is a sacred place this is a a place of purpose and this is now speaking generally to a name a good name is rather to be chosen than great riches this is the followup to a a Mortage home and a and the home being for sale how a home can be sold how we can be housed we could be homeless and the whole idea of as we begin to get into some things about finances and money in the URS of Le DEA says a good name is better and it's rather to be chosen if you were given the choice of a good name or riches don't none of you lie at some point in your life you would have chose riches right and now having read this scripture you're all going to say oh no good name brother Aaron a good name and those of us who maybe don't like our names and we've changed them or whatever we'd say I know exactly what I'm thinking about too but a good name is rather be chosen than great riches and loving favor rather than silver and gold now these phrases taken together mean more than the time I'm going to give them now but this good name it comes by doing well a good name is better a good name is rather to be chosen you should choose a good name over riches and it doesn't mean that you start looking through H uh baby name books and you start looking at meanings and you start trying to run the uh uh the Hebrew and the English and all the different meanings to try to come up with a really really good name and and I've come up with this name and this is what it means that that's not what is meant it meant it means a reputation a good reputation when a company is sold a and there's and there's Assets in that company you can affix you can assess what those things are if they have printers if they have machines and they have laths they have all different sorts of physical tangible assets you can get them appraised and it has some value but then the company that's existed has what's called Goodwill and it's the reputation it it it means this speaks to the intangibles about this business and what it's worth not merely because it has property or assets but because it's established itself and has done business for so long that the name of the company has value sometimes even more than the assets themselves some people could have customer list and want to sell their customer and sometimes the people just want the customer list because they don't want the name because it's a bad name other times people could say keep your customers I just want the name because it's a good name good name comes by doing well it means a man's reputation if you can think of it this way your good name is what goes before you when you get there and this is saying character is better than riches a good name a testimony a good testimony is better than riches and loving favor rather than silver and gold in other words this respect this Integrity loving favor is better than silver and gold testimony now if you could for me do the this is you need to do this work make this practical and what this looks like in your individual lives and what you're trying to Aspire acquire or aspire to be and what you lift up in your families and what we Aspire and try to do as a church a good name is better to be chosen than great riches and loving favor than gold silver and gold character is better than riches why it's a stronger Foundation right but it's harder to acquire the scripture is saying it's easier to get riches than it is to get character it's easier to get silver and gold than it is loving favor but character is more useful than money character lasts longer than money and the loss of character is worse than losing money take this to Heart we're talking about character versus character ch right that the the loss of character is more harmful than the loss of money is job lost everything and maintained his integrity at the in the end he lost nothing the Bible says in Ecclesiastes a good name is better than precious ointment in Proverbs 13:22 this is a scripture worth focusing on a good man leaveth an inheritance to his children children and the wealth of the Sinners laid up for the just in other words the the a sinner's wealth ultimately ends up in the hands of a better man that it's always tenous that a wicked man generally gains even his income dishonestly uh the cheating The Cutting Corners the looking out after himself even if he's not necessarily a thief he doesn't have the kind of character where you can guarantee that he's always had the right motive and objective and so it implies that a sinner's wealth even though he may have worked for It ultimately it'll end up in the hands of a just man or a better man and this phrase a good man leaves an inheritance to his children's children the Bible tells us in Ephesians to be dear followers of God as or be followers of God as dear children so I say this to express this that a good man leaves an inheritance not to his children alone but to the children of his children it would be his grandchildren and it is the nature of a child to follow his parents so he says he says follow God as dear children children inherit I don't mean to scare anybody here today but children inherit the nature of their parents and every child here child here should go that explains everything they inherit the nature of the parents and without any effort they imitate us yes without any forethought beforehand they mimic and they express and they show things cuz by Nature they have by birth they have the nature of the parents and so by Nature they will follow in mimic their father or mother so Paul says follow God as dear children but now if we could think of it in a natural sense as a good man leaves an inheritance for his grandchildren the nurture of a parent not just the nature but the manner in which a parent raises that child the way that he interacts with him and the example that he gives will either promote the worst of our nature or point to something better and as this scripture says a good man leaves an inheritance to his children's children if I can say this the impact of a man's example and his habits influences children and therefore their children if I have given my son Preston my nature and Elliott's going right it's off the hook today if I've given Preston my nature and then he only gets my base nurture I probably will promote the worst of who I am and if that just runs its course when he has children here in a few years when he begins to have children guess what his children will be influenced by me this is what the Bible is telling us the habits that a child learns from his father are the foundation of that child's character I know you're all thinking when did this sermon start like when you said it was a good stopping point maybe it was actually a good stopping point but the habits that a child learns from his father anybody remember the the commercial from the 80s that when a father is standing over his child at the bed and and he's chat he's holding a like a cigar box of drug paraphernalia and the father's like said Son where did you get this and the son says to his daddy I learned it by watching you okay I learned it by watching you and the dad's just like like what could he say then the habits that our children learn become the foundations of their character so it says a good man leaves an inheritance not a curse he leaves something valuable a treasure a good man's inheritance then survives the Next Generation and passes to the third if I could phrase it this way a man of character a man who is just not a character of the message but a man who has character of the word a man wherein the name of God dwells and it's not just pretense a man of character leaves something that can benefit multiple Generations brother brandom writes in the church age book you'd better come before it's too late sayith the Lord and buy of me gold tried in the fire and then you will be truly rich brother B I'm taking this great urge to to the Le de seean Church Age come and buy of me gold tried in the fire white rment that you would be clothed and eyes have that you may see he saying this is God saying do it now before it's too late you're deluded you're deceived you're caught up in yourself you need your eyes to be opened then you'll be truly Rich truly Rich why because there is a good name that is better than riches there's loving favor that's better than silver and gold there's a good a good man leaves an inheritance an example to his grandchildren he says are we getting it that's his question listen to me naked physically we came into the world but naked spiritually we will not leave it that's a turn of events oh no we're going to take something with us what that something is is all we can take with us nothing less and nothing more so we better be real careful now to see what we take that we take something that'll make us right before God so then what we will take with us well I guess if I was trying to be politically correct I would write the blood of Jesus Christ right well let's just think about it if we want to be right before God we want to bring his righteousness that there are certain things you think oh if I want to be right with God this is what I need to bring but he takes it in this level and he looks at it in a little bit different way which to me is the product of these other things it's not apart from the blood it's not apart from his righteousness but it's the effect of the blood it's the effect of his righteousness it's the good habits of Jesus Christ it is the character of God that has produced this we will take our character that is what we will take with us now what kind of character will you take with with you wow will it be Disney Looney Tunes will you will it be like his whose character was molded by suffering in the fiery furnace of Affliction or will it and jot this phrase down will it be the softness of This characterless leod Dean people where the great burden of this age is soft living and nervous tension and riches the softness of this characterless Leo Dean people so soft sof and malleable so scalable in Spectrum on the spectrum that we can choose whatever we want to be there's nothing hard nothing rigid nothing sure soft characterless genderless L de seeing people then he says it is up to each one of us for in that day every man will bear his own burden I've said it this way before and I'll impress it upon us now as it says a good man leaves an inherit for his grandchildren if there's an inheritance that can be enjoyed by grandchildren it's also Jo enjoyed by the children it's not that a good man knows how to write his will where it skips his children and goes straight to the grandchildren if you want to know how to do that I can help you but that's not what's being implied in this instance saying that the children can enjoy it and there's always leftovers for the grandchildren the grandchildren aren't looking at this estate saying wow Grandpa's worth how many millions of dollars and when he he dies that goes to oh wait my Aunts Uncles and my dad uh or my mom am I going to get any of it when it's those things it may not survive even to go to the children there's gifts that lapse all the time because a person will write a will and say to my daughter I give my million dollars in my Bank of America my wacovia bank account cuz they watch over your money and it's in my watch over your bank account and then that bank gets assumed by some other bank and then it gets transferred to another bank and when it gives time to give that million dollars to the daughter the gift fails because it was so specific that it's no longer there but this is something that cannot fail this type of character and so if a man leaves something then we take our character and what you leave is your legacy what you leave your character has left an imprint your character has left a testimony you take your character with you but there's a reputation that remains and if we think of character as a victory something that can only be molded by suffering in a fiery furnace of Affliction it's something you fight for something you labor for something that you earn something that in conquering you receive that tells me something remarkable that I take my character with me but then what am I leaving because I can't leave my character to my sons or daughter I can't leave my character to my grandchildren because character is not a gift it's not received nor inherited but there is something I can leave and I'm tying all this to the phrase where brother B said in speaking the difference between a house and a home he said it's the character of the inside that makes a home Character Matters brother bman the time tested Memorials of God says a man's character is made known by his works whatever you are your Works prove what you are right you say well I I'm a I'm a plumber and your whole life you build brick walls right you say well I'm GNA I'm going to say you're a Mason just you know forgive me for a moment here and I'm just going to say you're a brick layer no I'm a plumber licensed certified got the degree name on the truck you know Aaron's plumbing and all you do is got mortar and bricks in your the back of the van right you say well I'm just going to say no matter what you call yourself sir plumber sir if you want to be called a plumber you're a plumber but the bricks tell me you're a brick layer CU a man is known by his works whatever you your your Works prove what you are no matter how much you testify whatever you say Pro or con that has nothing to do with it I'm this I'm that I I I I I what you do is what counts your Works tell what you are tells what you are inside every job that you do manifest what you are you businessman if you just do a patched up job see what I mean just a halfway job don't do that if you can't do it right just don't do it don't do it at all why because your work testifies of your character you may call yourself a plumber you may have a plumber's license but your your awesome brick walls testify that you're an awesome brick layer your Works testify of your character and it's our works it's the way that we live that's building our character our works then build the character of our house that if you could think of it this way if you take your character with you there's something to be said about what you take with you even when you're not present whether it be by death or by work when you leave the home you want something that's holding the home together yes that's more than just your iron fist or your intimidating presence so that the garage door opener immediately triggers you know a panic attack in the children and the mom at home but there is a character that is left in the home it's our testimony that influences how others view us and even view our house as I said before maybe this is just a Nuance we'll have to kind of break down a little bit more in the future if you take your character with you you can't give character to your children as a gift but your character matters because your Works build your character therefore the works that are seen build the works that are seen Pro or con Better or Worse your Works determine your character so I want to know what I'm building because if that's building my character my Works become my example my works and my Deeds my words my choices how I spend my time what I say how I react all those different things will show and be something I will leave my Works to my children I will leave a legacy the imprint I leave in the home the atmosphere I create I may take my character when I go but I leave the atmosphere I've created my Character Matters I couldn't get away from this scripture because it just seemed to speak of so much Proverbs 10:22 the blessing of the Lord it maketh Rich you want wealth come to me what before it's too late you'll truly be rich be blessed of God His blessings where he causes his name to dwell his will that's what really makes us rich to be rich in His blessings does not imply to be rich in this world we'll touch on this maybe later kind of this becomes a very good segue into what I was studying last week the blessing of the Lord makes rich and he addeth no sorrow with it the Bible teaches us that with the wealth of this world there comes sorrow that when man have been greedy for gain and the love of money is the root of all evil that there are certain things that we can acquire with the world and and Solomon noted that when we get that it's vanity and when you get that sorrow comes with it but God is saying there's an addition there's a blessing there is a benefit that there's no sorrow added to it am there's a there's a wealth and a rich that God gives the blessing of the Lord it makes rich I will not mortgage my home my home is not for sale there is things in this world I do not want but there's blessings from God that have no sorrow with it and that's what makes me Rich amen that's what makes my house a mansion that's what makes everything I own and everything I pursue a blessing because it's makes it wealth because it's a blessing from God I have two more scriptures scripture readings to read this one will just sum up where his name dwells in Colossians 3: 12-1 17 it says put on therefore as the elect of God holy and beloved vows of Mercy kindness humbleness of mind meekness longsuffering forbearing one another and forgiving one another as the elect of God put on as those who are the place where he puts his name amen as those that are the Bears of his presence these are the things then that must be made available if you are the his Dwelling Place if you are a tabernacle of the Holy Spirit then these are the things that must be there Mercy kindness humbleness of Mind meekness longsuffering forbearing one another forgiving one another these are all things that were available in the Tabernacle these are all the things that were in the temple and these are all the things that Christ manifested because it continues that we forgive If any man have a quarrel against any even as Christ forgave you so also do ye so Christ for fores therefore we should forgive and above all these things put on charity which is the bond of perfectness and let the peace of God rule in your hearts to the which also you are called in one body and be ye thankful let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with Grace and your hearts to the Lord these were images of the Temple these were images of the Tabernacle these are things now that he's saying if the word of Christ dwells in you richly then let it be in wisdom teaching and admonishment there's singing There's rejoicing there's feasting and I believe it's written this way so as to just tie it all up so that you don't miss the point that he's making as the elect of God put on Mercy kindness humbleness of Mind meekness longsuffering patience forgiveness wisdom teaching admonishment singing Grace so he's just like okay I could keep going on forever whatsoever you do in word or deed do all in the name of the Lord Jesus that doesn't mean when I wake up in the morning I go and I start grabbing eggs in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ scrambled eggs in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I'm going to add a little heavy whipping cream and it's that's not it at all it it's not just a crutch for where whatever I do in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I'm going to do it it means in his character in his nature with his honor in mind if I can't do it in a way that will honor him I don't want to do it if I do it in a way that confuses it confuses the true nature and spirit of God I don't want to do it that even goes so far as to sometimes the hard decision we have to make is to do the thing that's the most offensive to some but the most in harmony with the character and nature of God yes yes sir do all in the name of the Lord Jesus in his character whatsoever you do in word or deed do it in his character whether it be the meekness of Christ the moderation let the word of Christ dwell in you richly let it manifest if you are where his name dwells do all in the name of the Lord Jesus is this character this is the challenge this is my clothes this is the ask as a Salesman don't you have to clothes with an ask or something I don't know how it works i''d be a horrible salesman because I can hardly return food that I'm paying for that's not cooked right let alone knock on someone's door and try to sell them something they don't want I didn't know if you maybe wanted this okay never mind I know you right if I had to do cold calling for a living we wouldn't be making a living and I admire people that do it but is this character available in your life what type of inheritance then are we building for our children and grandchildren the temple was built as the place where his name would dwell that regardless of the individuals that frequented it that fellowshipped that praised that rejoiced that ate that offered that vowed that served that no matter who who it was levite or all the other tribes that God's presence would dwell there for subsequent generation after generation after generation and the experience would always be the same because God's word had preeminence and therefore in type what are we what kind of Tabernacle will our children inherit if we want to think about your own lives well they're going to have to do something with your body and all your junk that you accumulate through throughout your life if you die and they'll have to deal with that but I'm thinking about what kind of family name are we building what kind of home will we leave them we're not worried about square footage and the right kind of zip code we're talking about the blessings of the Lord that make Rich we're talking the example of the father that forms the foundation of his son's character what type of building are we what kind of inheritance are we building not only for our children but our grandchildren as Paul is instructing us to be as the elect of God to have bows of Mercy kindness humbleness of Mind meekness longsuffering forbearing one another forgiving one another he uses the phrase even as Christ therefore I would say in all these things do all in the Name of Christ it means do it even as Christ we must be Christ we must be where his name dwells and not a t-shirt that says Jesus not the right pictures in our home alone not the right kind of bum bumper sticker I I I'm I'm not I'm not so much worried about the pretense and the Optics or the character of Christianity I want the character of it even if it's not necessarily wrapped in a physical way that people would say I want that but if the name's there if it's salty people get thirsty there's a brand of Christianity that is just stoking the hatred right of those that deny Christ because it's so in congruent with the nature of Christ right it's so muddled that it will never speak to one who's anti someone who's anti is just going to flip to another anti-side but if someone's caught up in the the caricature of Christ if they get uh whether be jaded or they become hurt or uh you know kind of confused with their movement they they'll just flip to the other side and say I I don't even believe I'm anti this I'm anti that there's got to be Christ in there somewhere that's calling to the hungry I was trying to find where I originally read this phrase I couldn't remember if it CS Lewis and I had it in some of the notes I a research I was doing at one time I think I even used it in a sermon here a few years ago and this writer remarked I I've never gotten anyone's attention by talking about the word unless of course they were looking for an argument no matter what you say Pro or con he said but when I just live the word I'm amazed how the people that need it the most pick up on it immediately when I just live it the living is the character of it a life lived by the word would be the word expressed Jesus Christ was the word of God expressed he was the very heart characteristics of God and it wasn't known merely through his words but it was the totality of life where his name dwelled there the word was living now I'm going to read I'll invite our musicians to come and I'm going to read a parable that piggy backs off of Christ teaching about wealth and a faithful Steward and those that have and have not and but in Luke chapter 16: 19 we'll just read to verse 23 there was a certain rich man I'm using this to as a p painting a picture at the end there was a certain rich man which was clothed in purple and fine linen and fared sumptuously every day there's one picture and there was a certain beggar named Lazarus which was laid at his gate full of sores and Desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table moreover the dogs came and licked his sores there's two different Instagram posts a man who is Rich dressed in purple and fine linen who fares eats well has a house with the gate he's a rich man and the other guy is at certain beggar named Lazarus and he has laid at a gate he's full of sores and just to paint the picture of the pity dogs are licking his sores and he would be happy to have the crumbs that came from the rich man's table to drastic different pictures and Jesus cuts to the end and it came to pass that the beggar died and it says the rich man also died but he says it came to pass that the beggar died and was carried by the Angels into Abraham's bosom this is a that was a symbolic of paradise the rich man also died and was simply buried though we could argue well did the Angels carry his physical body into Abraham's bosom they this is the end of that man the rich man who fared sumptuously every day all his fair living and all his wealth and all his riches he ended up in a grave just like Lazarus but it says the beggar he had something that could be taken and so that person who he was was carried into Abraham's bosom into the presence of God by angels and in verse 23 and in Hell the rich man lifted up his eyes being in torment and seeing Abraham a far off and Lazarus in his bosom in life the rich man had it made in life Lazarus not so much but which one would you rather be which one are you today and I would argue that many of us right now in this present life cannot identify with Lazarus therefore it would be more appropriate for us to identify with the rich man and so the question I ask is what are you doing with the beggar at your gate the question I ask is what kind of inheritance are you leaving what kind of life are you living brother Brandon in the sermon time tested Memorials of God he said them memorials is gone he's talking about all the great conquerors and heroes and Caesar and all the ones that have gone before My Brother David was shared with me his experience in being in Israel and walking along streets and seeing tops of houses entrance into houses that were just now barely peing above street level because things just get built built up on top all the great memorials to man how many surviv today and live today he says they're all gone but that Living Word of God Still Remains just the same and just as valuable that's a memorial remember remember a name is a Mark or a memorial of identification he said that's a memorial so I say today brother the things that you do the words that you say now I'm quoting brother Brandon and if I don't have it on the slide it's maybe just to test whether or not you trust me the the the things that you do the words that you say how you treat your neighbor and what you do about Christ will be an everlasting Memorial how you treat your neighbor how you treat your neighbor an everlasting Memorial you might have a fine home to leave your children you might be working for some livelihood to leave your children but I'd rather leave them the word of God than anything else those houses will vanish that's perfectly all right that's good I have nothing against it but don't do those minor things and leave the great things undone we work and strive to have the Investments we work and strive to have a savings that we can live on and enough maybe to leave our children and we're constantly calculating how we're going to pay for college and what we're going to leave he says it's all leave them houses and have a livelihood where you can set your grandchildren up that's all fine but I'd rather that's minor he says leave them the great things is to leave the word because the word will the house will perish and the people will perish with it but the word will raise them up in the last days and give them Eternal and Immortal Life again he says and now in order to make an estate like this WOW an estate what you leave when you die you what you own is called your estate and there's an executive of your estate or there's one that has a trust care over your estate to divvy it up and to pass it along and he's saying there is then a care an estate like this he said God's Eternal Word and if you take your character but what you built what you honored what you pointed to was the word that will impact for Generations he said I think of this old song we used to sing here years ago time is filled with swift transition not of Earth unmoved shall stand build your hopes on things Eternal hold to God's unchanging hand when our journey is completed to God we've been true fair and bright our home and Glory our un raptured Soul shall view how much better it is to look out in the face of the setting sun when your veins are cooling in your body and your children standing around the bed to know that you got a Memorial built like that honey someday daddy will meet you on the other side I'd rather have that when the doctor says Billy there's nothing more can be done for you I see my kitties and I kiss them goodbye I say but daddy's not dying he's going to a rest to a place for this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved I have one already waiting he says what a memorial to speak out of I'd rather to do that in the face of my children than to say honey I've got a million dollars in this bank and a million over here in this one for you he said I'd rather be able to face them with if that's all you had than to say well I've got a million dollars here son I got a million dollars here daughter I'd rather leave that testimony and then he quotes with partings leave behind us footprints on the sands of time footprints that perhaps another sailing over life solag for a forlorn and Shipwrecked brother seen shall take heart again we may take our character but you're leaving footsteps footprints in the sands of time so he summarized it absolutely leave them for a memorial your testimony am leave for him a memorial your testimony that's what the Tabernacle was the Tabernacle of witness the Tabernacle of testimony that's what the whole house of the Lord was to be and that's what you are today is where his name dwells and where his name dwells we have to have character to accurately portray pray him and not just be a character we don't want just houses with clean Lawns and everything manicured and the pretense of Jesus and a billboard so to speak even as a church it's not the pretex it's the life it's the character behind the name that's what we want to have where his name dwells God bless you today we're done you can stand with us
