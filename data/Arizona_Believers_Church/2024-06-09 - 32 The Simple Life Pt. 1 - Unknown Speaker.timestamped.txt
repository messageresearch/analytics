[0:00] my title this morning is the simple life
[0:03] and we're taking it from we're still
[0:05] continuing on the subject of the house
[0:06] of the Lord I was going back to some of
[0:08] the earlier sermons we preached on this
[0:10] and just revisiting some of the themes
[0:12] that we've had in this and so this theme
[0:14] of
[0:15] Simplicity and uh The Simple Life of
[0:18] Christ may be one way of putting it but
[0:21] we want to uh explore this idea of the
[0:23] simple life and a few weeks ago when we
[0:26] were visiting my grandma in San Diego my
[0:30] wife was speaking with her and maybe
[0:32] have maybe asked a question and her
[0:35] answer was striking especially at the
[0:38] time with the things I was studying and
[0:39] ministering on uh she made this
[0:42] statement just live an ordinary life
[0:45] some people try to jump too high just be
[0:48] ordinary and it struck me in the telling
[0:51] of it at the moment as we were had just
[0:53] spent some time with her and we thought
[0:55] maybe this may be the last time we've
[0:56] seen her but apparently my kids just
[0:59] enthused with so much energy she's doing
[1:01] great now and uh and so we're very ha
[1:05] happy for that and grateful for that but
[1:07] she was trying to convey and she may
[1:09] have she said some other things around
[1:11] it that conveyed that you know some
[1:12] people in life are so worried about
[1:14] reaching so high and becoming something
[1:17] uh that they don't ever just really live
[1:19] an ordinary life and do their ordinary
[1:21] things and and to be ordinary it's
[1:24] something that is just regular or
[1:27] customary and we know that a garnet Peak
[1:29] brother brandham said he was more than
[1:31] just an ordinary teenager of passing
[1:33] through and I don't believe that brother
[1:35] brandham was saying that he was
[1:37] extraordinary in life where everybody
[1:39] was like oh man this guy g a peak man
[1:41] people looked at him he's like well he's
[1:43] he's sick he's a uh he's an invalid he's
[1:46] and but brother brandom identified that
[1:47] he was more than just an ordinary
[1:49] teenager who are looking at life a
[1:51] certain way and doing something a
[1:53] certain way so when we use the term
[1:54] ordinary we're not just talking about
[1:56] common in the world but something that
[1:58] is customary or in a usual order or
[2:02] something that is after a certain course
[2:05] and it's just the ordinary way that
[2:07] something is done and and I think that
[2:10] that was what she was tapping into is
[2:12] this idea of just live simply don't try
[2:15] to reach to high but just live simply
[2:18] and so I'll say this at the outset so
[2:20] that you're you're ready for you know
[2:23] where I'm going with this but the simple
[2:25] life let me put it this way the life
[2:28] that Taps into the mystery of Christ is
[2:30] a simple life the one that can get to
[2:34] the real deepness of the mysteries of
[2:36] Christ a life that Taps into the mystery
[2:38] of Christ and when I say mystery it's
[2:40] that which is customary or the usual
[2:42] course or order of Christ and uh that's
[2:46] the that's the life that is a simple
[2:49] life Christ is outside of the ordinary
[2:52] course of religion he's outside the
[2:54] ordinary course of of nominal
[2:56] Christianity but there is something that
[2:58] customary of Christ something that you
[3:00] would expect of Christ something that's
[3:02] usual of Christ and so I'm looking at
[3:05] this in the sense of the simple life and
[3:08] I I'll say a humble life is the deeper
[3:10] life sometimes we think people oh the
[3:12] deeper things the Deeper Life and we
[3:14] want to get deeper we want to get more
[3:16] Revelation and we call upon God for
[3:18] Revelation and we think that the deeper
[3:20] that we go in Christ like the the higher
[3:22] our understanding is to man and the more
[3:24] that we could figure things out and and
[3:26] be impressive and other people would
[3:28] rely upon us but TR the deeper we get
[3:31] the more grounded we get the more stable
[3:33] we get and in some ways the more
[3:34] ordinary we're going to be when it comes
[3:36] to the things of God and where it comes
[3:39] to Living the Life of Christ and not
[3:41] just trying to be a religious
[3:43] fanatic I'll say this I maybe I'm I'm
[3:46] tracking this in my mind over and over
[3:48] again because there's always this this
[3:51] side where people will
[3:53] recognize uh that you are a Christian
[3:56] but it doesn't necessarily mean they'll
[3:58] be happy with that
[4:00] you know there's times that you behave
[4:02] appropriately you're humble you're Meek
[4:04] you demure you say I'm sorry you try not
[4:06] to engage and escalate the situation and
[4:08] it makes the world mad he like I was
[4:11] wanting to fight I I thought that if I
[4:13] could lock horns with you you would say
[4:15] or do something that would make me feel
[4:17] Justified for my anger and my bitterness
[4:19] but you've just diffused the whole
[4:20] situation and quite frankly you've made
[4:22] it worse for me so it's not that the
[4:24] world's always going to be like you're
[4:26] Christ I love it no that's not the case
[4:28] but it's what Christ Christ would do and
[4:31] it may not be extraordinary in the eyes
[4:32] of the world and it may not be the real
[4:34] religious Thunder that we would like to
[4:35] have in our own lives but yet it is just
[4:37] it is just what Christ would do and so
[4:40] we're trying we want to live that Deeper
[4:42] Life which is the humble life I'll say
[4:44] this now as a cue to those who would
[4:46] like to do so or those who usually do
[4:47] this but I've really been uh just
[4:51] grabbed my attention has been grabbed by
[4:53] the sermon Harvest Time and brother
[4:55] bradam will'll take a text in there as
[4:57] we get to a c u we get to a scripture
[5:00] reading later brother bam took it as a
[5:02] text in that sermon and I've just been
[5:04] it's I've been hearing it it seems it
[5:05] feels as if for the first time it's just
[5:07] so amazing now in Daniel 12: 1 to4 since
[5:12] we're talking about a life that Taps
[5:13] into the mystery of Christ and kind of
[5:15] that Deeper Life is a humble life I I
[5:18] want to look at it in the context of the
[5:21] time that we're living in now because we
[5:23] don't ever want to go backwards and and
[5:25] say well the simple life let's just go
[5:27] back to the the days of the Little House
[5:29] on the prayer and let's just go back to
[5:30] living uh without technology or living
[5:33] without this and living without that and
[5:35] so there's a way that we could be trying
[5:36] to go back to a simpler time and we're
[5:39] not actually tracking the word of God to
[5:42] e to the to Israel when they were in The
[5:44] Exodus there was a point at which they
[5:45] felt that the life in the wilderness was
[5:47] way too complicated and they would
[5:49] rather go back to Egypt because it was
[5:52] just simpler was just you know we got
[5:54] told what to do we knew where we were
[5:56] living we knew what we were eating and
[5:57] we don't want to have that kind of
[5:59] attitude
[6:00] well well we just we want to go back to
[6:01] some archaic way of living we want to
[6:03] know the promise of God for today and
[6:06] not go
[6:07] backwards and so in Daniel chapter 12
[6:09] and especially as I've been studying
[6:10] Harvest Time this scripture is just
[6:12] right in this vein and at that time
[6:14] shall Michael stand up the great Prince
[6:16] which standeth for the children of thy
[6:17] people and there shall be a time of
[6:20] trouble such as never was since there
[6:22] was a nation even to that same time and
[6:25] at that time thy people shall be
[6:27] delivered everyone that shall be found
[6:29] written in the book what great meaning
[6:32] uh names written in a book an unfolding
[6:34] a revealing an opening of a book and
[6:36] many of them that sleep in the dust of
[6:38] the Earth shall awake some to
[6:40] everlasting life and some to shame and
[6:42] everlasting contempt so we see that it's
[6:45] speaking about end time things a time
[6:48] when books will be open and people will
[6:49] be judged a time of even a resurrection
[6:52] of those who will awake to everlasting
[6:54] life and then a period of time where
[6:56] there's even those uh that will wake up
[6:58] to Everlasting contempt and they that be
[7:01] wise shall shine as the brightness of
[7:04] the firmament and they that turn many to
[7:07] righteousness shall shine as the Stars
[7:10] forever and ever they that turn many to
[7:12] righteousness as the Stars forever and
[7:14] ever but thou oh Daniel shut up the
[7:17] words and seal the book what an image
[7:20] what a striking image for us even to the
[7:22] time of the end many shall run to and
[7:26] fro and knowledge shall be increased
[7:30] this phrase many shall run to and fro
[7:32] and knowledge shall be increased is one
[7:34] that's uh interesting to really wrestle
[7:36] with and even the translations or even
[7:37] the original language in terms of uh
[7:40] traveling and moving on and gaining
[7:41] knowledge and experience there a there's
[7:43] a lot to be uh impressed with that but
[7:46] it's the scripture is connected with the
[7:49] end times and the increase of human
[7:52] wisdom the increase of Science and
[7:54] knowledge where uh the the globe is
[7:57] understood now and I was even reading an
[8:00] article or saw a headline of an article
[8:02] where the world's economy may need to
[8:04] shrink we may need to shrink our
[8:06] economies because it's becoming uh a
[8:08] detriment to have a global economy h a
[8:11] book that really uh kind of uncovered
[8:14] and put into context a lot of what's
[8:17] happened in the world today it's a book
[8:18] I think it's by fredman called The World
[8:19] is Flat has anybody read that book The
[8:21] World is
[8:22] Flat it's it's huge so oh you did read
[8:25] it okay you probably listen to it right
[8:27] yeah you listen to it that's cheating
[8:29] it's all I do really anymore is listen
[8:30] to books though a and it's this idea
[8:33] that because of the technology we have
[8:35] uh we could be communicating right now
[8:37] somebody on the other side of the earth
[8:39] could be listening to this service right
[8:40] now live and they know exactly what has
[8:42] been preached and it doesn't have to
[8:44] travel by letter through the sea and so
[8:46] it's just the world has been flattened
[8:48] and everyone's connected and news it
[8:50] meets us immediately and everything is
[8:51] unfolding in real time and that's the
[8:54] time that we're living in many shall run
[8:56] to and fro we've circumnavigated the
[8:58] globe everyone is everywhere connected
[9:00] all the time and there's been this
[9:01] increase of knowledge and as we have
[9:04] been ministering on for the last couple
[9:06] months this increase of knowledge has
[9:08] led to the increase of the possession of
[9:11] things but we've never achieved an
[9:14] understanding of things a true
[9:16] understanding of things or pure
[9:17] understanding or achieved understanding
[9:19] that Daniel is writing here uh that uh
[9:23] that we would desire that we think we
[9:24] should have so we've had the pursuit of
[9:27] knowledge and gaining knowledge we've
[9:28] got the possession of things but yet
[9:30] there is no understanding if anything
[9:33] we've reached kind of a real interesting
[9:36] time in technology and the
[9:38] evolution of science and knowledge to
[9:41] where in some ways we're just kind of
[9:43] putting out the same thing over and over
[9:45] again but just trying to tweak it so
[9:46] that people think they're buying
[9:47] something
[9:48] new so it's there's not a lot of new
[9:50] things to be
[9:52] envisioned we're we're just nearing that
[9:54] end of the cycle brother Bram in this
[9:57] day this scripture is fulfilled I was
[9:58] reading every instance that I could find
[10:00] where brother bradam is referring to
[10:02] this uh Daniel chapter 12 but this was a
[10:06] I'm really good to kind of sum it all up
[10:07] here in 65 politics is rotten corrupted
[10:10] rotten to the bottom just exactly what
[10:13] Matthew 24 said it would be Nation would
[10:16] be against Nation Kingdom against
[10:18] Kingdom all these things would take
[10:19] place so there's this politics are
[10:22] rotten this is a good script should read
[10:23] during an election year politics are
[10:25] rotten rotten to the bottom Nation
[10:28] against Nation Kingdom against Kingdom
[10:29] there's so much division let's consider
[10:32] this now all right notice another the
[10:33] increase in scientific research my
[10:37] grandfather went to see my grandmother
[10:38] in an ox Ox cart now it's a jet plane or
[10:42] even an orbit into outer space he says
[10:44] it's great who said this Daniel 12:4
[10:48] said knowledge shall increase in the
[10:49] last days so he says we see the hour
[10:52] that we're living in we're living in
[10:54] this hour where this Daniel was told
[10:56] shut up uh the words and seal the book
[10:59] until the end the time when knowledge
[11:01] has increased the scientific Age and and
[11:04] man has given himself over to himself to
[11:07] trust in himself and his data collection
[11:09] and his data analysis and he's let loose
[11:11] his faith in God and went from the ox
[11:13] cart to a space shuttle in a short
[11:14] period of time he's saying that's that's
[11:17] the time that we're living in we see the
[11:18] hour we're living in notice now the
[11:20] conditions of the world the condition of
[11:23] Science and notice again today in our
[11:25] educational system so there's a lot that
[11:28] we could ident ify in terms of knowledge
[11:30] science and
[11:32] education and the uh the advancement of
[11:35] humanity through these different things
[11:37] whether it be uh uh Science Education uh
[11:41] and these different things
[11:42] Transportation these things that brother
[11:43] Brown's referring to I I I want to
[11:46] summarize this so I can keep going
[11:47] further we are living in the day of
[11:49] Daniel 12 H we're living in the day that
[11:52] many of them that sleep shall awake
[11:54] we're living in a time when the words of
[11:56] the book are are are are opened up and
[11:58] unsealed we're living in a time when
[12:00] they that be wise shall be shall shine
[12:02] as the brightness of the firmament so if
[12:05] you look at that scripture there in
[12:07] verse three they that be wise it's those
[12:11] that will understand the word they will
[12:14] their lives will radiate with the
[12:17] gospel in a time when people are running
[12:19] to and fro and gaining knowledge and
[12:21] knowledge is
[12:22] increased and there's a lot of
[12:24] advancements and a lot of technology and
[12:26] there's a lot of living and and the
[12:27] World is Flat though that will
[12:30] understand the word their life will
[12:32] shine as in darkness there's going to be
[12:34] a customary way of the world there's
[12:36] going to be things that are expected of
[12:37] the world there's going to be a life
[12:39] that's lived by the world but there's
[12:40] going to be those that are shining and
[12:42] even though it's just a common life it's
[12:44] just like the common star you see in the
[12:47] sky every night it's light in
[12:50] darkness the life they live by the
[12:53] understanding of the word now it says
[12:55] they that be wise will shine as the
[12:56] brightness of the firmament and they'll
[12:58] turn they'll be the same that turn many
[13:00] to righteousness so it's the life that
[13:03] they live by the understanding of the
[13:05] word that leads others to
[13:09] Christ and this is I'm not tossing off
[13:12] on books and blogs and and videos and
[13:15] and uh explanations and expository
[13:18] teaching I think that's all wonderful
[13:20] and there's a lot of effort that's put
[13:21] out there in social media uh there's
[13:23] even some who in Europe that have had
[13:26] significant success utilizing Facebook
[13:28] to spread the message uh and it gained a
[13:31] lot of souls but then it kind of reached
[13:32] a point to where there's a law of
[13:33] diminishing returns and it was no longer
[13:35] viable and I believe in some ways we're
[13:38] reaching that time where it is in fact
[13:40] gleaning and the most effective witness
[13:43] of the Gospel is not going to be uh uh
[13:46] uh YouTube shorts or or new books or
[13:50] blogs or even tweets the real
[13:53] effectiveness of the Gospel is going to
[13:55] be in the lives that people are living
[13:57] before those they come and cont cont
[14:00] with and again let me be very very clear
[14:02] I have nothing in general against any of
[14:05] those things I do have a little bit of a
[14:07] a sensitivity against some people have a
[14:09] gluten sensitivity it's not an allergy
[14:11] it's just a Sensitivity I do have some
[14:13] sensitivity when it comes to apologetics
[14:15] we feel like we need to explain
[14:17] everything and make everything sound
[14:18] just right well sometimes I think it's
[14:20] good when there's rough edges and it's
[14:22] not explainable because that's just the
[14:24] way my God
[14:26] is now it is going to be the life that
[14:30] they live that turns others to Christ
[14:33] and then in verse 9 of Daniel 12 it says
[14:35] and he said go thy Way Daniel and again
[14:37] it's kind of summing these things up for
[14:39] the words are closed up and sealed till
[14:41] the time of the
[14:42] end now with this idea of this book
[14:45] being sealed until this time when these
[14:47] things are going to be in a specific
[14:48] time in history of mankind that these
[14:50] things will unfold it says many shall be
[14:52] purified and may white and tried there's
[14:55] going to be a group that is Tried by the
[14:57] word and stands White and purified
[14:59] there's going to be those who are judged
[15:01] on Earth by Jesus Christ and they
[15:03] renounce any hidden things of darkness
[15:05] and their lives are made pure and
[15:06] they're made white there's going to be
[15:08] many that are purified made white and
[15:10] tried but it says but the wicked shall
[15:11] do wickedly and none of the wicked shall
[15:15] understand so there's going to be the
[15:17] unrighteous that continue to do
[15:19] unrighteousness and there's going to be
[15:20] the wicked that continue to do wickedly
[15:23] and he says they're not going to have
[15:25] understanding and it's the lack of
[15:26] understanding that explains why they're
[15:28] lost it's the lack of understanding that
[15:30] explains why they continue to do
[15:31] wickedly and they continue to do
[15:33] unrighteous things but the wise shall
[15:36] understand the wise shall understand the
[15:39] words of the book that have been sealed
[15:41] up to the end time the wise shall
[15:43] understand uh the mind of God and the
[15:44] things of God the wise shall understand
[15:46] and it's through the understanding that
[15:48] they're purified made white and
[15:51] tried it's through their understanding
[15:53] that they shine as the brightness of the
[15:55] firmament and turn many others to
[15:57] righteousness
[16:00] in Revelations 10: 10 and 11 we
[16:03] understand the sequence of events from
[16:04] Revelations 5 in the opening of the book
[16:07] to Revelations 10:1 and the book and the
[16:09] contents of that book being revealed and
[16:11] brought back down to
[16:12] earth John in the scripture is
[16:15] challenged to go to him who has the open
[16:17] book which is Christ This Book of
[16:19] redemption and to take it and so he says
[16:21] I took the little book out of the
[16:23] Angel's hand and ate it up because he
[16:24] was commanded by the angel to eat it and
[16:27] it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as
[16:28] soon as soon as I had eaten it my belly
[16:30] was bitter and he said unto me thou must
[16:32] prophesy again before many peoples and
[16:35] Nations and tongues and Kings if I could
[16:38] just summarize it this way without
[16:40] getting into a lot of details the life
[16:42] or this this this mystery that was
[16:45] hidden in this book which now John
[16:48] symbolically has taken and eaten that
[16:51] mystery is to be lived out before many
[16:55] to be somehow processed in your life and
[16:57] then demonstrated in manifested before
[17:00] many as it was in Revelations 5 to Every
[17:03] Creature H and there's going to be a
[17:07] blessing and honor and glory and power
[17:09] that's going to be radiated out of
[17:11] that's going to be lived out of and
[17:13] expressed by in in this type of John how
[17:16] he takes the book and he's told you're
[17:18] going to prophesy again to many peoples
[17:20] Nations tongues and Kings I could say in
[17:22] type the bride is processing the word of
[17:25] God the body of Christ is the bearer of
[17:28] his glory his honor and his power and as
[17:31] she lives her life the mystery is lived
[17:34] out before many peoples Nations tongues
[17:37] and kings around the
[17:39] world as many shall run to and fro and
[17:42] knowledge shall be increased there's
[17:43] going to be wisdom and understanding
[17:45] likewise that's going to be lived out in
[17:47] the life of the Believers around the
[17:49] world those that receive the word become
[17:53] the
[17:53] word and then they live a life by the
[17:57] word so that it's prophesying
[18:01] again now if we could again this may
[18:04] seem like kind of a little bit of a leap
[18:06] but I'm I'm now just I'm not sure when
[18:10] we read a lot of these statements and we
[18:11] built a lot more into it but there was a
[18:13] sermon within the last a couple years we
[18:16] we read a lot of this and we tracked a
[18:17] similar thought and as it was meditating
[18:20] on it even this morning I realized that
[18:22] this may be something that you just you
[18:24] need to revisit on a regular interval so
[18:27] that we don't lose sight of this
[18:30] commandment and I I want to put it in
[18:31] that sense this end time commandment
[18:34] this emphasis as we read Daniel chapter
[18:36] 12 the book is sealed and the words are
[18:38] going to be open in the end time and the
[18:40] wise are going to understand but the
[18:41] wicked won't understand and that many
[18:43] will be made purified it will be
[18:45] purified and made white and tried but
[18:47] the wicked will continue to do wickedly
[18:49] and thou must prophesy again and there's
[18:51] a way that you begin to paint this
[18:54] picture where that it's so Grand and
[18:57] great in our eyes and you got the white
[18:59] and you have the wicked and you got to
[19:01] be very careful with those terminologies
[19:02] but you have those that are made white
[19:04] and purified and tried and they're going
[19:06] to be the holy ones and they're the
[19:07] righteous ones and they're the ones that
[19:09] understand but then you have the wicked
[19:10] ones that are continue to do
[19:12] wickedly and there this this Chasm that
[19:14] begins to develop in our minds and we
[19:16] see it it's so vast and so different
[19:18] these callings and these positions and
[19:20] these elections and even the Fulfillment
[19:22] of these scriptures shine is the
[19:24] brightness of the stars turn many to
[19:26] righteousness a and these words being
[19:29] opened up in the end time and the book
[19:30] coming down and a mighty Angel and
[19:32] there's a lot of things that we begin to
[19:33] read but I want you to catch the
[19:36] emphasis that was given to us at the
[19:39] time that the word was opened and how
[19:42] important it is to recognize this is
[19:44] still part of the mystery because of its
[19:47] Simplicity brother brandom on March 24th
[19:50] 1963 he takes time to give question and
[19:52] answers on the seals after he has
[19:54] preached uh God hiding himself in
[19:56] Simplicity the breach and the first six
[19:59] before he preaches the seventh seal that
[20:00] evening he takes question and answers
[20:03] and I'm only cutting these out and I
[20:05] know I'm cutting them out of context but
[20:06] the statements to me don't lose their
[20:08] meaning by uh when you remove it from
[20:11] this question that's being asked and
[20:13] maybe the subsequent statements but he
[20:14] says you just go ahead and just remember
[20:17] what you're told live a Christian
[20:20] Life go to your church be a real light
[20:23] wherever you are and just burn for
[20:25] Christ and tell the people how you love
[20:28] him so there's going to be many that are
[20:33] purified made white and tried those are
[20:37] the wise that understand and the wise
[20:40] shall shine as the brightness of the
[20:43] firmament that's fire so he says go
[20:46] ahead and live a Christian Life go to
[20:48] your church be a real light and just
[20:51] burn this ISS exactly Daniel
[20:54] 12 he says tell the people how you love
[20:57] and just let your testimony be with love
[21:00] all the time with the
[21:01] people cuz if you don't you twist
[21:04] yourself out into something there and
[21:06] then you're off the Beaten
[21:08] Track that if we don't are have love all
[21:11] the time with the people if we're not
[21:13] lifting up how much we love him if we're
[21:15] not going to church if we're not a real
[21:17] light and we're not burning for Christ
[21:19] and we're not living a Christian Life
[21:21] you've somehow gotten yourself into an
[21:24] area now he he's not necessarily
[21:26] cautioning against I'm back sliding and
[21:29] and turning uh the message becoming a
[21:31] drug cult or sex cult or something
[21:33] really crazy H H and you say well where
[21:36] are you going with that well you know
[21:37] what there's a lot of people that have
[21:38] been associated with the message that
[21:39] have done awful perverted things and
[21:41] horrible things in the name of the
[21:43] message and it still continues under the
[21:44] guise of the message to this day a and
[21:47] and I would argue that the same has been
[21:49] done in the name of the Bible to the
[21:52] same if not worse degrees but there's
[21:55] he's referring to this idea that we
[21:57] could take the thing that are being said
[21:59] and done and get weird with it leave the
[22:03] weirdness to Portland and Austin right
[22:06] like there's an idea where that we don't
[22:09] we don't want to get weird with it we
[22:11] want to listen to what is being said
[22:13] catch the true understanding of it
[22:15] instead of trying to jump too high and
[22:18] and and live in a way that is weird
[22:21] before the people and distant and
[22:23] distinct we want to live stay grounded
[22:26] and Live the Life of Christ otherwise
[22:29] you're getting off the track the beaten
[22:31] path that has been demonstrated for us
[22:33] the example that's been provided he says
[22:35] remember what I preached on and I
[22:36] believe he's hearkening back to the
[22:38] beginning of the week
[22:39] humility don't forget that he says I'm
[22:43] going to
[22:44] stop a minute to warn that again all
[22:48] this is in question answers on the seals
[22:50] remember when God predicts anything
[22:51] great to happen the people are looking
[22:53] so far away by their wisdom till they
[22:55] miss what happens he mentions that old
[22:58] over and over and over again even about
[23:00] John the Baptist uh how they expected
[23:02] him to be a certain way and even how
[23:04] John the Baptist he said it was so
[23:05] simple to even the prophet missed it I
[23:08] don't think I'm reading that one but he
[23:10] says that about how John the Baptist
[23:11] missed the Simplicity of Christ because
[23:14] he expected the Messiah to be in a
[23:16] particular way and even John the Baptist
[23:19] was not uh didn't catch it at first he
[23:22] said they didn't understand it even the
[23:23] disciples didn't get it and it's by our
[23:26] wisdom by our knowledge by the increase
[23:29] he says that by their wisdom they miss
[23:30] it they looking so far away we're
[23:32] looking up and he said you're looking
[23:33] over it right you're looking for
[23:35] something great something big they don't
[23:38] understand it even the disciples didn't
[23:39] get it Simplicity be humble go right
[23:42] down when God promises something big it
[23:44] is big in his sight the blade of grass
[23:48] has life in it it's so simple and
[23:51] humble the blade of grass is big in
[23:54] God's eyes but yet simple and humble in
[23:56] our eyes we've been able to uh produce a
[23:59] synthetic grass that's better than real
[24:03] grass it may get 180 degrees on days
[24:06] like
[24:06] Friday but it's simple the blade of
[24:09] grass is humble it's simple it's humble
[24:11] you see a man is a big man all right but
[24:13] if he's big enough that he can become
[24:15] simple he'll find God you find God in
[24:18] that
[24:19] Simplicity big enough to become simple
[24:21] he'll find God but if he don't become
[24:23] simple he'll never see him so you've got
[24:26] to become simple
[24:28] now there is a simple in the Old
[24:30] Testament which is
[24:31] foolish so there is a there is a simple
[24:34] that brother bam is not alluding to but
[24:37] he's he's the way that he's saying is
[24:39] this way of trying to make things
[24:41] extravagant and make things complicated
[24:44] and and complex and make things big and
[24:46] showy he's saiding no you've got to be
[24:48] simple like Christ you've got to be
[24:50] humble like Christ if you don't you're
[24:52] going to get away from it you're going
[24:54] to miss it so he says get humble just
[24:56] stay humble
[25:00] just go on he says and live a good
[25:03] Christian life now I'm not repeating
[25:04] this is his his emphasis I'm not
[25:06] rereading something I've already read
[25:08] this is Brother brandham continuing with
[25:10] this repetition in question and answers
[25:12] the morning before he preaches the
[25:14] seventh seal he says just go on and live
[25:16] a good Christian life because you only
[25:18] wind yourself away from the real thing
[25:20] when you do it if you don't live a
[25:24] Christian Life if you don't stay humble
[25:26] you'll wind yourself away from the real
[25:28] thing so there is something genuine
[25:31] there is something real but it's not
[25:33] found in and uh in not living the
[25:36] Christian Life it's not going to be
[25:39] manifested or expressed outside of being
[25:41] a
[25:42] Christian he says well just be real
[25:44] humble again these are just statements
[25:46] I'm pulling from it not just one quote
[25:49] you just be real humble be a Christian
[25:51] and try to live for God and live honest
[25:54] with your fellow man and love those who
[25:55] don't love you he saids don't try to
[25:58] make any and it is a fragment but we
[26:01] could maybe just let the Lord fill in
[26:04] our heart what he might have said if
[26:05] we're going to be honest and love those
[26:06] that don't love us you see you do you
[26:09] only make it a mysterious something and
[26:11] mess the real program of God
[26:17] up you'll mess the real program of God
[26:20] up now God has a program and we want to
[26:21] get right in
[26:23] it God God has a way God has something
[26:25] he's trying to do brother bam calls it a
[26:27] beaten path he calls it the real thing
[26:29] there's different ways if we try to get
[26:32] mysterious making a mysterious something
[26:34] you mess the real program up now I want
[26:37] to just throw this out there I think it
[26:38] might be worth a really long series
[26:40] maybe 2025 can be on this but there is
[26:42] the idea of a mystery and a mystery is
[26:44] something that's not understood or known
[26:46] and so a revelation is the revealing of
[26:50] the mystery a revelation kind of unfolds
[26:52] or exposes what the mystery was all
[26:54] about yet we understand that even if a
[26:57] mystery scripturally
[26:59] is revealed and so there's a revealing
[27:01] of the mystery there can still be a
[27:03] mysterious element that remains and it
[27:05] can also be that not everyone
[27:07] understands the mystery's been
[27:09] revealed and so I'm not trying to uh I I
[27:14] don't necessarily want to open up
[27:15] something that causes a lot of a thought
[27:17] and you get kind of lost in my thought
[27:19] today but in the thinking of the mystery
[27:21] versus the revealing and if there's
[27:23] going to be many that are wise and they
[27:25] shall understand they're going to
[27:27] understand the my hisory of God there's
[27:29] going to be something in the simp the
[27:31] the the God they're going to find God in
[27:33] simplicity so there's going to be a man
[27:35] no matter how big or how great we are we
[27:37] become humble we become simple and we
[27:39] find God and in finding God he's saying
[27:42] just live a Christian Life and so this
[27:44] is the part I want to express that if
[27:46] there's the mystery and then there's the
[27:47] revealing there's nothing more telling
[27:50] than a person's
[27:52] life there's nothing more telling
[27:55] there's nothing more revealing in than
[27:57] how someone
[28:00] lives we can talk a talk we can pretense
[28:03] pretense but examine a man's life and
[28:06] there's something telling about a way a
[28:08] man lives and I don't mean just in the
[28:10] moment when he's angry or upset or when
[28:12] he stubs his toe and he throws something
[28:14] or he gets caught off guard I'm not look
[28:16] at the man's life not judging him in a
[28:18] moment but as he lives his life even you
[28:20] could say someone I've never met a man
[28:22] that makes more mistakes but as that man
[28:24] lives you might find I've never met a
[28:26] man who handles mistakes better and
[28:28] humbles himself better than that person
[28:30] he was I've never met a man who's
[28:31] learned more from his mistakes I've
[28:33] never met a man more
[28:36] perfect and and you ask man you're
[28:38] perfect bro you're amazing it's like
[28:40] I've made a lot of mistakes I've just
[28:43] learned from all my mistakes you're like
[28:44] man this guy won't take credit for
[28:45] anything and so it's just something
[28:47] where he's learned he's grown he's lived
[28:50] and and you look at there's nothing more
[28:51] revealing than a person's
[28:54] life right I'm not I never mind I hope
[28:58] you I hope you understand what I'm
[28:59] saying if you don't agree challenge me
[29:01] to become be uh do better to get myself
[29:04] out of the way and study and find the
[29:05] inspiration of God to make those things
[29:07] clear now he arrives at this spot in
[29:10] question and answers to me that just
[29:13] open it up so much in sum up what he's
[29:16] been saying and he
[29:18] uses some references that we may we like
[29:21] we're maybe all thinking what nobody
[29:24] does this anymore but he says if you're
[29:25] planting wheat plant your wheat
[29:29] he says if you're digging potatoes go on
[29:31] and dig them out I don't know if you
[29:34] plant wheat at the same time you're
[29:36] digging out potatoes but I'm sure
[29:37] there's a lot there that someone could
[29:38] look into and find some sort of cycle of
[29:40] things but if you're planting wheat
[29:42] plant it plant the
[29:45] wheat oh some great big mysterious
[29:47] things happened H HH this is amazing and
[29:50] let's all just let's all just move to
[29:52] presc it and start a camp or let's do
[29:53] this let's do that let's let's all get
[29:55] together and do something and withdraw
[29:57] ourselves and any moment now we just
[29:59] could keep your eyes on brother brandom
[30:00] follow brother brandom because if he
[30:01] goes we want to go with him and if he
[30:03] and if he goes we want his Mantle when
[30:05] he leaves
[30:06] and and he's saying listen if you got
[30:09] wheat to plant don't just follow me
[30:10] around and stalk me go plant your wheat
[30:13] if got to crop the Harvest go Harvest it
[30:15] you got to dig out some potatoes dig out
[30:17] some potatoes he says if I knew he was
[30:19] coming tomorrow and I was a farmer I'd
[30:21] put my crop in today if he made me a
[30:24] farmer I'm going to stay right at my
[30:27] duty
[30:28] now take that if you made me a farmer
[30:31] that's really
[30:32] specific uh to a particular occupation
[30:35] and we can make a lot of assumptions
[30:36] based upon that that title of farmer but
[30:39] now put yourself in this if he made you
[30:43] a if he made you a husband and a father
[30:47] and a mechanic or a coder keep doing
[30:50] your duty be right at your duty do not
[30:54] use the message of the hour as an excuse
[30:56] to Sher your duty do not use being
[30:59] spiritual and studying Revelation as an
[31:01] excuse to not be a good husband to not
[31:03] provide for your family there are men
[31:05] who have used this excuse of being
[31:07] spiritual and being gifted and being
[31:09] prophets to just lay
[31:11] waste to their children and their wives
[31:15] and some of them do have wives
[31:19] plural but he says just keep doing what
[31:23] your duty is he says if I'm hoing
[31:25] potatoes I'll just be hoing away just as
[31:27] hard as I I can now let's we're not
[31:30] going to feel left out if we're not a
[31:32] wheat farmer we're not going man well
[31:34] I'm not even a potato farmer and and
[31:36] we're not like leaving today really
[31:38] really jealous of the brother in the
[31:39] church who's both both a wheat farmer
[31:41] and a potato
[31:43] farmer all somebody who's both Ukrainian
[31:45] and Irish or something were like man
[31:47] this guy won the lottery when it comes
[31:49] to the message because he's farming
[31:51] wheat and digging potatoes and we think
[31:52] he's the most spiritual whatever you are
[31:55] whatever your duty is keep doing
[32:00] it dig the potatoes and go to
[32:07] church where's the camera I always for
[32:10] dig the potatoes and go to
[32:14] church if I'm hoing potatoes I'll just
[32:17] be hoing away just as hard as I can dig
[32:20] the potatoes and go to church and write
[32:22] on if it takes place in the morning
[32:25] you'd be found doing just exactly what
[32:28] you are supposed to be
[32:31] doing this is remarkable in the sense
[32:33] that if we all knew right now that Jesus
[32:36] Christ was going to come tomorrow
[32:37] morning at 10:30 in that vacular that
[32:40] language of this idea that at 10:30
[32:42] everything's going to be over and then
[32:44] it's like well I'm not going to go to
[32:45] bed I'm G to stay up all night I'm going
[32:48] to finish reading the Earth is flat I
[32:51] want there's this idea that this is what
[32:53] I'm going to do you wouldn't go to
[32:55] work would you send your kids to
[32:59] school yeah I mean thank someone's
[33:05] listening that's what he's telling us we
[33:07] should do that if we knew that at 10:30
[33:10] the next day that that there was going
[33:12] to be a translation to change and many
[33:15] that sleep are going to be raised and we
[33:16] that are alive and remain are going to
[33:17] be changing a moment in twink of VI
[33:19] don't be afraid to send your kid to
[33:21] school you're going to see them just
[33:23] beyond the veil Don't Be Afraid just to
[33:25] keep doing what you're doing and all
[33:27] don't let fear dictate what you do and
[33:31] don't let Faith make you weird and
[33:34] cultish and not do what a normal person
[33:36] would
[33:37] do wake up in the morning go through
[33:39] your
[33:40] routine make your Lion's man
[33:44] tea and and eat your Crispy Cream donut
[33:46] with it and just do your
[33:50] routine he says just keep doing what
[33:52] you're supposed to be doing he says
[33:54] don't start and I love it it's a
[33:55] fragment don't start
[33:57] in other words whatever you were just
[33:59] thinking nuh no don't don't
[34:01] start whatever it is you would do nuh
[34:03] don't start he doesn't say don't start
[34:06] you know binging Netflix he doesn't say
[34:09] anything but no no no no no whatever you
[34:11] were thinking don't
[34:12] start when you do you twist the very
[34:15] thing away from the purpose that it's
[34:18] intended
[34:20] for now if I could put it this way and
[34:22] if you feel that I'm Taking Liberties I
[34:25] understand because I'm I'm trying just
[34:26] to summarize this
[34:29] if he's talking about the Lord
[34:33] coming I want to read it just
[34:36] exactly if it takes place in the morning
[34:39] and the things if it's this change this
[34:41] Rapture whatever we're thinking this fin
[34:43] final event that's up going to upset
[34:45] everything and turn everything around
[34:46] said if it's to take place in the
[34:48] morning you keep doing exactly what
[34:50] you're supposed to be doing so whatever
[34:52] he's referring to that's to take place
[34:56] has a purpose that it's intended
[34:58] for and if you don't just keep doing
[35:01] what you're supposed to do and live the
[35:03] Christian life then you defeat the
[35:06] purpose for what this was intended for
[35:10] and tell me if this Prophet isn't being
[35:11] very delicate but yet able to hit the
[35:14] mark exactly saying these things that
[35:16] are transpiring are not supposed to lift
[35:19] you out into a Mountaintop somewhere
[35:21] where you're isolated from everybody
[35:23] else not to keep you from doing what
[35:25] other normal people would do it's not to
[35:27] make you arrogant it's not to make you
[35:29] proud it's not to make you indifferent
[35:30] but it's to get you to a place where you
[35:32] live a good Christian Life you uh you go
[35:34] to church you're real light wherever you
[35:36] are you're burning for Christ you love
[35:38] the people you do good to those who
[35:40] don't do good to you you love those who
[35:42] hate you and you're planting your
[35:43] potatoes and you're harvesting your
[35:45] wheat you're doing whatever it is you're
[35:46] supposed to do because if you don't what
[35:49] this is is intended to make you do that
[35:53] and if you don't you've twisted your way
[35:54] from the very thing it's for it's
[35:56] for you twist yourself away from the
[35:58] very purpose that it's intended for so
[36:01] brother brandham in the seventh seal he
[36:03] says remember Revelations 10:1 to7 at
[36:05] the end the seventh Angel's mystery all
[36:07] the mysteries of God would be made known
[36:09] we're at the end time the open of the
[36:10] Seath seal how did I know the other day
[36:13] last week a Sunday ago when I was
[36:14] preaching on be humble be humble
[36:17] remember God deals in the little things
[36:20] now the placing of these two things next
[36:23] to each other is amazing Revelations
[36:25] 10:1 the open of the seventh seal
[36:26] Revelations eight and Revelations 5 all
[36:28] these things that kind of collide
[36:30] together and he says remember a week ago
[36:31] be humble be humble remember God deals
[36:33] in little things I didn't realize what
[36:35] it was really talking about and now I
[36:36] see it it is in such a humble way you
[36:40] think that something like that would be
[36:41] revealed to the Vatican or it just comes
[36:43] like John the Baptist it he says but it
[36:45] comes just like John the Baptist it
[36:48] comes like the birth of our Lord in a
[36:49] stable glory to God so help me the hour
[36:52] is at hand we are here we are here we've
[36:55] arrived at the unfolding and The
[36:57] Happening of these things but it's not
[36:59] big like men thinks it's going to be big
[37:01] it's going to be big like God thinks
[37:03] it's going to be big a blade of grass
[37:05] that's got life in
[37:06] it simple humble in the little things
[37:10] like John the Baptist or a baby laying
[37:12] in a
[37:13] Manger so he says now as he's gone on
[37:16] and he's kind of gotten into some areas
[37:17] that maybe he's he feels later on that
[37:20] he's venturing too far but as he
[37:21] preaches this he says there's no great
[37:23] men among us we're not great men not
[37:24] great women we're all brothers and
[37:26] sisters all the the same in the same
[37:28] bracket we're not great one don't make
[37:30] one greater than the other not a thing
[37:32] at all to do to do remember that without
[37:35] prejudice but we're just all human
[37:38] beings don't try to interpret the things
[37:40] don't try to interpret this to make
[37:41] brother Bram God don't try to interpret
[37:44] it to where we have modern day Elohim
[37:46] don't try to interpret it to where we
[37:47] have modern day eth Messengers he says
[37:49] don't try to do anything more
[37:52] than just live a close
[37:54] Life Giving praise and honor to Jesus
[37:57] Christ Christ everybody understand that
[37:59] now amen love him with all your heart
[38:03] what what an incredible conclusion to
[38:05] arrive at at the time that these things
[38:07] are happening you'll see that they track
[38:09] Revelations 10 uh 10 and 11 they track
[38:12] Daniel 12 1:4 and 10 11 9 and 10 there
[38:15] there's this harmony with these very
[38:17] things how he says don't try to be or do
[38:19] anything more than live a close Life
[38:20] Giving praise and honor to Jesus Christ
[38:23] not running after the flashy we're not
[38:25] running after the charismatic we're not
[38:26] running after something things that the
[38:28] world's going to cause call great but
[38:30] we're want we're wanting to live close
[38:31] to God now brother brandom after he
[38:34] preaches these things and he feels like
[38:36] he's gone too far the next day he wants
[38:38] to re-record a certain portion of the
[38:40] sermon to go out on tape and remove a
[38:42] part so after he has had 24 hours or
[38:45] whatever it might have been to think
[38:46] about this was I doing the Trump
[38:47] accordion hands do I do
[38:50] that brother brandom the next day so so
[38:55] the thing that he says this is the next
[38:57] day after he's had time to think about
[38:59] it he says so the thing for us to do is
[39:03] to be reverent before God and serve
[39:07] him and do all that we know how to do
[39:09] and live good Christian lives he's had
[39:12] time to think about this this is a
[39:14] prophet that is staring something in its
[39:15] face and he recognizes something has
[39:18] transpired and these these mysterious
[39:20] events and things that are being
[39:21] revealed and things that he doesn't
[39:22] quite know yet and as he sees these
[39:24] things happening and he knows that it's
[39:27] been mysterious he knows that it's been
[39:29] powerful he knows that he's uh been
[39:31] caught up in this constellation of
[39:32] angels there's things that are so
[39:34] astounding and he says the one thing for
[39:37] us to do is to be
[39:39] reverent serve God do all that we know
[39:42] how to do live good Christian
[39:47] lives but it's right along and then he
[39:49] then I'm skipping some but listen he
[39:50] says but it's right along with what he
[39:51] said no one will know his coming they
[39:54] also would know nothing about the seven
[39:55] Thunder mystery so you see it's
[39:58] connected together I think that's
[40:01] important to understand that much we
[40:02] have an understanding of today because
[40:04] the rest of all of it
[40:05] unfolded but this is not unfolded but
[40:09] setting in my room I seen it unfold to
[40:10] the seven
[40:12] Thunders and that's as far as we can go
[40:14] right
[40:16] there now that's oo
[40:19] right especially if you if at that time
[40:22] he they didn't release the tape he
[40:23] originally preached and then he adds
[40:25] this over it and you're like ooh
[40:28] and now I trust that each and every one
[40:30] of
[40:31] you will try to find the original
[40:34] copy and study it for decades trying to
[40:37] dissect it to figure out what this last
[40:40] part was that
[40:42] unfolded he says now I trust that each
[40:45] and every one of you will serve God and
[40:47] do that which is right and love him all
[40:50] your life and serve
[40:51] him and God will take care of the rest
[40:58] this is the Matthew
[41:00] 6:33 this is the real this is the real
[41:03] wisdom of the of what we're facing when
[41:06] it comes to things unfolded and things
[41:08] revealed and things mysterious or things
[41:10] unknown that God has a program that God
[41:14] has a beaten path and that way is a way
[41:18] of righteousness and that program is the
[41:20] program of revealing and living and
[41:21] unfolding and manifesting and he says
[41:24] I've seen it unfold and all this is
[41:26] connected seven Thunders seal all these
[41:28] things are connected together and he
[41:29] says now I trust that what you'll do is
[41:32] serve God do what is right love him with
[41:34] all your life serve him and God will
[41:36] take care of the rest what we don't
[41:39] understand what we don't know what's
[41:41] left to be fulfilled we can't try to
[41:42] figure out and make it be fulfilled in
[41:45] our minds or try to make sense of it
[41:47] we've just got to keep living a
[41:49] Christian Life we can't have bitterness
[41:51] we can't strive we can't attack we can't
[41:53] try to tear down we've got to live the
[41:56] Christian Life when people take off
[41:57] their coat roll up their sleeves and
[41:59] want to box you because of something
[42:01] you've got to say no I'm sorry please
[42:03] forgive me that's not what I'm in this
[42:05] for I'm running this race to please
[42:07] Christ I want to win others to Christ I
[42:10] don't have time for
[42:12] that whatever your next job is do
[42:15] it but know that God will take care of
[42:19] the
[42:23] rest now in 2 Corinthians chapter 11
[42:27] that was a very important piece to
[42:33] this because now I with with that
[42:36] setting that's where we are now we
[42:39] understand what these end time
[42:40] Commandments were and what he wants us
[42:43] to do and so we find ourselves now in
[42:46] this position as the bride of Christ in
[42:49] Satan's Eden being united together with
[42:51] her bridegroom the revealed word and
[42:54] there's this uniting going on and
[42:56] there's this life being lived as a
[42:58] consequence of it we could take all I
[42:59] want to read them again almost just read
[43:00] them all together without expounding so
[43:02] you understand this live a simple life
[43:05] keep doing what you're supposed to do
[43:06] keep right on doing what you're doing
[43:07] because there's something that's taking
[43:09] place that has a purpose and if you
[43:11] don't live the life that's you leave the
[43:13] purpose it's intended
[43:15] for so there is a calling there is a
[43:19] duty there is a be it unto me according
[43:21] to Thy word there's a time and a place
[43:24] that's been appointed for us to bring
[43:26] forth the full word of of God again in
[43:29] the lives that we
[43:31] live and however God chooses to to
[43:33] manifest that in many different ways 2
[43:36] Corinthians chap 11:3 we'll get to verse
[43:38] four here in a moment hopefully now Paul
[43:41] says but I fear and it's interesting as
[43:43] he's speaking about a Godly jealousy
[43:44] prior to
[43:46] that and this fear is not inconsistent
[43:49] with love as you could study it and find
[43:51] that it's it's not that Paul was uh
[43:54] wrong but he says I fear lest by any
[43:55] means as the serpent beguiled Eve
[43:58] through his subtlety so your mind should
[44:01] be corrupted from the Simplicity that is
[44:04] in
[44:06] Christ as the serpent seduced Eve now if
[44:10] I could just be straight to the point in
[44:12] my Bible when it gets to Genesis chapter
[44:14] 3 it says the
[44:16] Temptation that's that's what that time
[44:19] that that uh uh that story tells us the
[44:21] temptation of mankind of the woman and
[44:24] then also Adam so as the serpent seduced
[44:28] the woman he seduced her from her
[44:31] obedience to God's word like that's just
[44:33] let's just put it in the most simple
[44:35] terms we can so if we want to build off
[44:38] of that metaphor as he says as the
[44:40] serpent beguiled Eve through his
[44:41] subtlety he seduced her from her duty to
[44:45] her
[44:46] husband he seduced her from her duty to
[44:49] the word he seduced her from the purpose
[44:52] that God had intended for her in the
[44:55] beginning so that's put in the most
[44:57] simple terms what however you want to
[44:59] look at the unfolding and what he said
[45:00] and what he did and what it resulted in
[45:02] if we could take the the metaphor that
[45:04] Paul is working with as the serpent
[45:06] seduced the woman through his
[45:09] subtlety and brother BR when he writes
[45:11] this in the church age book remember
[45:13] we've shown clearly All Through the Ages
[45:14] that even as Adam and Eve fell because
[45:17] they left the word so s Satan through
[45:20] his subtlety entic the woman to leave
[45:22] the word so the Ephesian age fell by
[45:25] turning slightly from the word this is
[45:28] always Satan's tactic until the every
[45:30] age continuing to turn away we have a
[45:33] final repudiation of the word by the
[45:35] World Church system that's how you get
[45:36] to Revelations 3 where Christ is on the
[45:38] outside of the church this Lal deene age
[45:41] ends in a blackout of the word thereby
[45:44] causing a departure of the Lord from the
[45:46] midst he stands outside calling to his
[45:49] own who follow him by obedience to the
[45:52] word so the seduction of the serpent in
[45:55] the beginning was a t temption for the
[45:58] woman to leave the beaten path to leave
[46:01] the intended program to leave the
[46:03] purpose that God had intended it for he
[46:05] says a short and Powerful demonstration
[46:07] of the spirit after a short and Powerful
[46:09] demonstration of the spirit this little
[46:10] hunted and persecuted group will go to
[46:12] be with
[46:14] Jesus if I could put it this way then as
[46:17] we're wanting to narrow it down on this
[46:19] time as Paul says in his age I Fearless
[46:21] by any means this metaphor of the
[46:22] serpent beguiling Eve he would corrupt
[46:24] our minds Satan will try to tempt the
[46:27] bride away from her mate the revealed
[46:29] word he'll try to seduce her away from
[46:32] Simply believing and obeying Jesus
[46:36] Christ and he's seductive brother br
[46:38] will refer to Matthew 24 a lot it'll be
[46:40] so close and what is it it's a gospel
[46:43] that's so close and so near but it's
[46:45] trying to get you away from the
[46:47] Simplicity of Christ in first John
[46:51] chapter 2:18 he writes little children
[46:53] it is the last time this is the mindset
[46:55] and the attitude that Paul is working
[46:57] with that John is working with as you
[46:58] have heard that Antichrist shall come
[47:01] even now are there many Antichrist
[47:03] whereby we know that it is the last
[47:06] time the Antichrist Spirit was already
[47:09] at work against the church it had caused
[47:11] the Ephesian age by to turn slightly
[47:13] away from the word thereby causing its
[47:15] fall and so now the Antichrist spirit
[47:18] that Antichrist is the wicked one
[47:20] working against the
[47:23] word now I feel good about uh just how
[47:26] much been able to cover so far but I'm
[47:28] only maybe close to halfway through and
[47:31] I don't want this to seem disjointed but
[47:33] I want to look at the temptation of
[47:35] Christ in Matthew chapter 4 the
[47:38] temptation of Christ in the wilderness
[47:41] is going to mirror the one in Eden so
[47:44] Paul is using the temptation of Eve as
[47:48] the metaphor for how Satan is tempting
[47:50] the bride in the Bible after the new New
[47:53] Testament Church is born in particular
[47:56] the Corian Church a lot that he says to
[47:59] them that is perfect in this vein so
[48:03] what happened
[48:04] then was in its most simple way is the
[48:07] serpent Satan used the serpent he used
[48:10] the means to open Eve up to pursue
[48:15] knowledge apart from God's perfect will
[48:18] to gain knowledge to do something that
[48:20] was contrary to the will of God all
[48:21] under the guise of religion all you know
[48:24] that subtlety you know be so close
[48:26] brother brandom said emphasized over and
[48:28] over about this work in the end time as
[48:30] Matthew 24:24 puts it are you doing good
[48:33] this morning everybody feel all right
[48:35] it's only 11:30 I me that's not bad
[48:37] right I in I started a little bit late
[48:40] we had to pray for the infirm in the
[48:41] week the sick before I got up here in
[48:45] Matthew 4: 1-1 then was Jesus led of the
[48:49] spirit led up of the spirit Into the
[48:52] Wilderness as the woman was in God's
[48:54] garden now the man is in the wilderness
[48:57] of Satan's Eed he in the wilderness of
[48:59] humanity in the earth to be tempted of
[49:02] the devil just as the woman was tempted
[49:05] and when he had fasted 40 days and 40
[49:07] nights he was afterward in hunger and
[49:09] when the tempter came to him he said if
[49:12] thou be the Son of God isn't that just
[49:15] like the devil to ask you to do
[49:18] something to prove something that
[49:19] doesn't really need the proof If thou be
[49:22] the Son of God command that these Stones
[49:24] be made bread now in in the context here
[49:28] is a man who the the humanity of Christ
[49:30] is hungry he has just fasted so there's
[49:33] the need to feed the body there's the
[49:35] need the human needs the human wants the
[49:37] human desires the struggle of the flesh
[49:39] that might crave something but the
[49:41] tempter says to change stones to bread
[49:44] that it might vindicate that you are a
[49:47] son of God and there's something very
[49:50] subtle about this request because there
[49:52] as I've even mentioned before this would
[49:54] have been the first miracle of his
[49:55] ministry to in a Wilderness in a time of
[49:58] famine take something Stony and by his
[50:01] word turn to bread that could feed him
[50:02] in man could you imagine the sermons we
[50:04] could have preached off of that type but
[50:07] Jesus recognizing the subtlety says in
[50:10] verse four it is
[50:12] written and he brings it back to the
[50:14] word in other words he's not saying well
[50:17] I'm a Son of God and I could do that but
[50:20] but or just do it to prove it he just
[50:21] says it's written men shall not live by
[50:23] bread alone but by every word that
[50:25] proceedeth out of the mouth of God in
[50:27] other words I may get hungry and it may
[50:29] be in my power to turn stones to bread
[50:31] it may be in my power to make money it
[50:33] may be in my power to feed my body maybe
[50:35] in my power to do a lot of natural
[50:37] things but you know what that's not the
[50:38] most important thing so Satan was trying
[50:41] to tempt him into deifying something
[50:45] Beyond to lift up and Elevate something
[50:47] beyond the word of God it's all the
[50:49] devil learns from this interaction that
[50:51] was his first scheme if he could put it
[50:53] that that way then the devil taketh him
[50:55] up into the holy City and Seth him on
[50:58] the Pinnacle of the temple as the
[51:00] scripture say he shall suddenly come to
[51:01] his Temple he says now again if thou be
[51:04] the Son of God cast thyself down for it
[51:07] is written oh Satan's learned
[51:09] something so now he's going to use the
[51:11] word this is his second scheme he shall
[51:13] give his angels charge concerning thee
[51:16] and in their hands they shall bear thee
[51:18] up lest at any time thou Dash thy foot
[51:21] against a
[51:22] stone so it is there's some symmetry to
[51:26] the Messiah
[51:27] and I if thou be a Son of God here's
[51:29] what the word of God says so why don't
[51:31] you make it
[51:32] happen the Bible says you shall do this
[51:34] the Bible says this shall follow them
[51:36] that believe so just make it happen do
[51:39] it to prove it make a show of it make
[51:42] make these things happen and so he says
[51:44] it is written again Thou shalt not tempt
[51:46] the Lord thy God now there's wisdom in
[51:49] his response and is exposing Satan's
[51:51] scheme he's tempting him to perform the
[51:53] supernatural he's tempting him to do
[51:55] something that would cause the angels to
[51:57] come to his Aid and keep him from um
[51:59] dashing his foot against a stone the
[52:02] devil's not done he works in his third
[52:03] one again the devil taketh him up into
[52:05] an exceeding high mountain and showeth
[52:07] him all the kingdoms of the world and
[52:09] the glory of them whether it be past
[52:13] present future showing these kingdoms
[52:15] he's showing them wives he's showing
[52:16] them a a family he's showing them all
[52:19] these things that he could have and
[52:20] saith unto him now that he has seen this
[52:23] all these things will I give thee if
[52:25] thou will fall down and worship
[52:27] me and Jesus said get thee hint Satan
[52:30] for it is written again he he doesn't
[52:33] deviate from the word thou shalt Worship
[52:35] the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou
[52:38] serve Jesus could have looked into the
[52:41] word and seen that it was written that
[52:42] all these kingdoms would be his he would
[52:45] see that to receive all these kingdoms
[52:47] would not be contrary to the Lord to the
[52:49] word but he realized that the end does
[52:52] not justify the
[52:54] means that he could not fulfill the word
[52:56] of God while dishonoring another part of
[52:58] the word of God so he comes back to the
[53:01] Simplicity of the word that I shall
[53:02] Worship the Lord my God and no other
[53:04] shall I serve says then the devil
[53:06] leaveth him and behold Angels Came and
[53:08] ministered unto him in each instance if
[53:12] I could as I summarized the temptation
[53:14] of the woman to say that she was tempted
[53:16] to dis Disobedience to the word tempted
[53:18] to unfaithfulness to her husband in each
[53:20] instance it was submission to scripture
[53:22] that thed Satan's
[53:24] scheme he just finds the script that
[53:26] becomes the balancer to the
[53:29] other oh you're hungry you need bread
[53:32] and and he says well I you know what man
[53:34] shall not live by bread alone so I find
[53:37] something that gives him that is
[53:38] enlightening to the circumstance well
[53:40] they throw yourself down the angels will
[53:42] take charge you well the Bible says not
[53:43] to uh tempt the Lord thy God well why
[53:46] don't we just speed this thing up do
[53:47] what you're supposed to do here a a and
[53:49] get this over with but he says you I
[53:51] can't take shortcuts and I can't worship
[53:54] you so the tempter is using different
[53:58] angles brother brandham says
[54:01] this in uh the church age book chapter n
[54:04] in Matthew 4 where Jesus is tempted of
[54:07] the devil now focus on this he overcame
[54:11] the personal Temptations of Satan by the
[54:15] word the language the personal
[54:18] Temptations of Satan by the word and by
[54:21] the word
[54:22] only and each of the three major trials
[54:24] that corresponded to the tempt it
[54:27] corresponded exactly to the Temptation
[54:29] Of The Garden of
[54:30] Eden so now he's showing us that The
[54:33] Temptations of Christ here in Matthew
[54:35] chapter 4 correspond exactly to the
[54:37] temptation of the woman in the Garden of
[54:39] Eden so now as a serpent beguiled Eve
[54:42] he's trying to beguile us and the
[54:44] example is seen in the garden and now
[54:46] with Christ the lust of the flesh the
[54:48] lust of the eyes and the pride of
[54:51] life Jesus overcame by the
[54:55] word so he was tempted with the lust of
[54:57] the flesh the lust of the eyes and the
[54:59] pride of life and he overcame by the
[55:01] word he fell to the personal Temptation
[55:05] Of Satan by failing to use the word it's
[55:08] this refrain personal Temptations Adam
[55:11] fell in direct Disobedience to the word
[55:13] but Jesus overcame by the word and right
[55:16] now let me say that this is the only way
[55:18] to be an overcomer also it is the only
[55:20] way to know that you if you are
[55:21] overcoming because the word Can't Fail
[55:24] now notice again how Jesus overcame the
[55:27] World Systems of religion when he was
[55:31] repeatedly badgered by the theologians
[55:33] of his day he constantly applied the
[55:37] word he spake only what the father gave
[55:39] him to speak there was not a time when
[55:42] the world was not utterly confused by
[55:44] his wisdom for it was the wisdom of
[55:47] God in his own personal life contending
[55:51] with himself he overcame by obedience to
[55:55] the word of God
[55:57] our personal
[55:59] Temptations contending with ourselves in
[56:02] our personal life and battle with the
[56:05] worldly theologians The Temptations of
[56:08] the world the answer is obedience to the
[56:12] word and he says that it's
[56:24] all it's the personal temp temp
[56:27] ations and he says the Temptation in the
[56:29] wilderness and the Temptation in the
[56:31] garden were the lust of the flesh the
[56:33] lust of the eyes and the pride of
[56:35] life and in 1 John Chapter 2 it says for
[56:38] all that is in the world the lust of the
[56:41] flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride
[56:43] of life is not of the father but is of
[56:45] the
[56:47] world we we'll come back to this maybe
[56:49] Wednesday night I just will skip over
[56:54] that the Temptation in the garden and
[56:56] the temptation of the Wilderness were
[56:57] the
[56:59] same I love how it's summarized in the
[57:01] lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes
[57:03] and the pride of
[57:04] life Satan brings it in seed form into
[57:07] the garden then he's showing it even in
[57:10] its final form to Christ as he stands
[57:13] them up upon that high mountain apart
[57:14] and he says look at where it ends
[57:16] up make stones of bread now I've studied
[57:20] this for many years just trying to find
[57:22] just exactly how this thing could be
[57:24] delineated and how you could apply a
[57:25] header to each one and I found that they
[57:27] can all be moved around and so in some
[57:30] ways maybe it's not so much these
[57:32] individual Temptations break out into
[57:34] three but that each one is connected
[57:37] with those three lust and the pride
[57:39] those two lust and that Pride but you
[57:41] can see in the making stones of bread
[57:42] how that there was the lust of the flesh
[57:44] where it's not seeking the kingdom of
[57:45] God first that there's some
[57:47] self-preservation it's a lust for money
[57:49] it's lust for income lust for things and
[57:52] then to cast thyself from the temple to
[57:53] be rescued there was a certain pride of
[57:55] life
[57:57] uh uh he called it tempting God that
[58:00] what what a scene this would cause if he
[58:02] jumps off the temple seemingly to kill
[58:04] himself and the angels arrive at just
[58:06] the right time to vindicate him and it's
[58:08] this this even to me speaks of
[58:10] popularity where wow what this look at
[58:13] what has
[58:15] happened to this this vanity and this
[58:18] pride and then he offers all the
[58:20] kingdoms if he bows and worships and he
[58:23] shows them something that he could lust
[58:25] after the lust of the eyes the
[58:29] power even as we've looked at the
[58:32] women and each one of these things
[58:35] there's something that Satan is tipping
[58:37] his scheme he's showing you his tropes
[58:40] he's showing you what he
[58:42] uses now I'll read this I don't want to
[58:44] because I just want to stop but I kind
[58:46] of hate getting this far and just
[58:48] petering out here no offense to
[58:51] Peter but in the Harvest Time brother
[58:53] Bram says remember the Bible said in the
[58:55] mouth of three Witness says let every
[58:56] word be established we'll get on that in
[58:58] a few minutes on the three Temptations
[59:01] of Christ the three Temptations of
[59:04] ministers today where they make their
[59:05] fall you know how we always like to talk
[59:07] about the Temptations of a minister
[59:10] three Temptations of the church and
[59:12] where they make their fall three
[59:14] Temptations of an organization and where
[59:16] it makes its fall you liking this so far
[59:19] and the three Temptation in the
[59:21] individuals and where they make their
[59:24] fall listen to this
[59:26] the these areas that Satan
[59:29] tempts these areas that he tries to
[59:32] cause us to be seduced and to be
[59:35] beguiled we could look at these very
[59:37] deeply we could break them down we could
[59:39] take more time trying to dissect the
[59:40] Temptation in the garden even the
[59:42] Temptation in the wilderness but Paul
[59:44] brings us to 2 Corinthians 11:34 I want
[59:46] to hurry to finish this morning but I
[59:47] fear lest by any means as the serpent be
[59:50] guiled Eve through his subtlety so your
[59:53] minds should be corrupted from the
[59:55] simplicity it that is in
[59:58] Christ please take some time to pray
[1:00:01] about meditate on study if you'd like
[1:00:04] how our minds can be corrupted from the
[1:00:06] Simplicity that is in Christ that is in
[1:00:10] a met that that the Temptation and the
[1:00:12] garden and the in willness are an
[1:00:14] example type or a metaphor of then in
[1:00:17] the same way that the woman fell but in
[1:00:19] the same way that Christ was tempted and
[1:00:20] did not fall how can our minds be
[1:00:23] corrupted from the Simplicity that is in
[1:00:25] Christ and Paul then gives us something
[1:00:28] to to look at he says for if he that
[1:00:30] cometh preacheth another Jesus whom we
[1:00:33] have not preached or if you receive
[1:00:36] another Spirit which you have not
[1:00:38] received or if I could say accept
[1:00:40] another gospel which you have not
[1:00:42] accepted you might well bear with
[1:00:44] them and it says you'll bear with them
[1:00:47] it kind of gives this idea of suffering
[1:00:49] it but it's this sense that you
[1:00:51] will continue to
[1:00:54] exist you will
[1:00:56] sustain it's not just you put up with it
[1:00:59] you tolerate it but there is a way that
[1:01:01] you interact in it that you sustain
[1:01:03] another Jesus you keep alive another
[1:01:06] Spirit you keep alive another gospel you
[1:01:08] not just tolerate it but in your
[1:01:10] tolerance you're allowing it to ex
[1:01:12] subsist and to
[1:01:14] persist brother bam says in God of this
[1:01:16] evil age Adam's bride believed every bit
[1:01:18] of the word but confused on one promise
[1:01:21] that he's the same yesterday today and
[1:01:23] forever failed on One Promise under the
[1:01:27] temptation of the enemy face to face in
[1:01:30] the personal temptation as Christ was
[1:01:32] tempted in his own personal life and had
[1:01:34] to contend with himself he overcame by
[1:01:37] the word the woman was tempted to fall
[1:01:39] and she had to face the enemy face to
[1:01:41] face and she
[1:01:44] fell Paul says I fear lest you'd be
[1:01:46] corrupted from the Simplicity of uh that
[1:01:50] is in
[1:01:54] Christ just as the woman and just as it
[1:01:57] was attempted on
[1:01:59] Christ now I'll I I'll just finish with
[1:02:03] these things I want um I'll maybe go
[1:02:06] back and cover back some of these things
[1:02:08] that we'd mentioned
[1:02:11] before but God hides in
[1:02:17] Simplicity when we even began
[1:02:20] this uh the series in that one thing
[1:02:23] have I desired the one thing desired the
[1:02:26] ultimate Simplicity is to have desires
[1:02:27] reduced to
[1:02:29] one to have one desire that we examine
[1:02:32] every other Pursuit and desire in light
[1:02:34] of and that it was that the our ultimate
[1:02:37] aspiration should be focused on a a
[1:02:38] singular objective and even use the
[1:02:42] phrasing that life should be the process
[1:02:44] of finding out what is
[1:02:46] valuable and what is not valuable and
[1:02:49] this effort that as we gain we
[1:02:52] understand value and we can get Beyond
[1:02:54] even what we immediately get out of that
[1:02:56] but get behind it to where it's through
[1:02:58] this research or through this finding
[1:03:00] and and this process of determining
[1:03:01] value that simplifies our
[1:03:06] life and I think it has application in
[1:03:08] so many different ways even just in how
[1:03:11] we are our lives are filled up with
[1:03:14] stuff but even how that we can make the
[1:03:16] message and the Bible just full of a
[1:03:18] bunch of stuff and we miss the
[1:03:20] Simplicity of
[1:03:22] it God hiding himself in simplicity then
[1:03:26] revealing himself in the
[1:03:29] same where God is
[1:03:32] hiding is where you find them and it's
[1:03:35] what Satan's trying to get us away
[1:03:38] from in those very Commandments to the
[1:03:40] woman of what she should not do was the
[1:03:42] mystery of what she should do and the
[1:03:44] Very things that Satan was trying to
[1:03:46] confuse her on that he's the same
[1:03:47] yesterday today and forever was the
[1:03:49] mystery was the power for her to be what
[1:03:51] God wanted her to be and so Satan was
[1:03:54] using these means to call her out from
[1:03:57] her obedience to the word of God so that
[1:03:59] the purpose of God would not be
[1:04:00] fulfilled in her life then Jesus comes
[1:04:02] and he's on Earth and he's LED of the
[1:04:03] spirit Into the Wilderness his ministry
[1:04:05] is going to begin it's going to be a
[1:04:06] short Ministry but he's going to be
[1:04:08] finishing a work that he was called to
[1:04:09] do so Satan shows up at that very moment
[1:04:12] and he uses these different schemes to
[1:04:14] try to tempt Jesus Christ away from
[1:04:17] obedience to the word of
[1:04:19] God whether it be face to face with the
[1:04:21] Enemy or in this personally Temptation
[1:04:23] personal Temptations of Christ or the
[1:04:25] Temptations of worldly systems or
[1:04:27] contending with himself he overcame by
[1:04:29] the
[1:04:30] word and Paul says just as Satan
[1:04:33] beguiled the woman he feared lest Satan
[1:04:36] would use schemes in the world to tempt
[1:04:39] the bride away from
[1:04:40] Christ if I can put this it self serving
[1:04:43] to my title but distract us away from
[1:04:45] the simple
[1:04:46] life but let me remind you he's trying
[1:04:49] to get us away from that simple
[1:04:53] Commandment that obedience to the word
[1:04:56] for our
[1:04:57] day Satan targets were God's expressing
[1:05:01] himself when Satan showed up in the
[1:05:03] Garden of
[1:05:04] Eden and there's a lot that could color
[1:05:07] this idea but Satan just didn't happen
[1:05:10] upon the serpent chose him for a reason
[1:05:13] he didn't just accidentally like the the
[1:05:16] the serpent was going to go beguile the
[1:05:18] armadillo so he's like and all of a
[1:05:21] sudden bumps into the woman a and
[1:05:23] instructions were unclear and so what he
[1:05:25] was supposed to try on the arm of lit
[1:05:27] Dow he's now trying to convince the
[1:05:28] woman to do something that's not the way
[1:05:30] that it worked it was deliberate so
[1:05:33] Satan is
[1:05:34] anticipating a and is trying to find
[1:05:37] God's next move so Satan is targeting
[1:05:40] himself where God is expressing himself
[1:05:43] and he's trying to cut God off at his
[1:05:45] next move and so he does this in the
[1:05:48] garden because there was an oncoming
[1:05:51] promise there was something that the man
[1:05:53] and the woman were going to fulfill
[1:05:54] there was a part of it that sat had
[1:05:55] anticipated that he's trying to figure
[1:05:57] out and now that the Messiah is being
[1:05:59] identified and this is a this is
[1:06:01] something that Satan can't disregard
[1:06:03] anymore because there was witnesses to
[1:06:05] this voice there was witnesses to this
[1:06:07] baptism now he's led the the spirit Into
[1:06:09] the Wilderness to be tempted by the
[1:06:10] devil and the devil is attacking where
[1:06:13] God is manifesting himself and he's
[1:06:15] trying to get him from his next
[1:06:18] move are you with me so when these
[1:06:22] things happen to Revelations 5
[1:06:23] Revelations 8 Revelations 10 all these
[1:06:26] things happen in March of 63 all these
[1:06:28] things are being preached what is God's
[1:06:30] next move what is it we're to be doing
[1:06:32] next live a Christian Life go to church
[1:06:34] be a real light wherever you are and
[1:06:36] just burn for C Christ and tell the
[1:06:38] people how you love them let your
[1:06:40] testimony be with love all the time you
[1:06:42] just go on and live a good Christian
[1:06:44] Life just be a real humble be a real
[1:06:46] Christian try to live for God live
[1:06:48] honest with your fellow man love those
[1:06:49] who don't love you You' just be found
[1:06:51] doing exactly what you're supposed to be
[1:06:53] doing don't try to be anything more than
[1:06:55] just living a close Life Giving praise
[1:06:57] and honor to Jesus Christ and I trust
[1:06:59] that each and every one of you will
[1:07:00] serve God and do that which is right and
[1:07:02] love him with all your life and serve
[1:07:04] him and God will take care of the
[1:07:08] rest God is expressing himself for the
[1:07:12] next move for the very next thing so
[1:07:14] Satan's targeting where he's expressing
[1:07:16] himself to keep you from doing what God
[1:07:18] wants you to
[1:07:20] do Brothers come to your
[1:07:22] instruments there's a lot more here
[1:07:24] maybe we could explore when wednes night
[1:07:26] but brother makes brother Brandon makes
[1:07:28] this statement in God's gifts always
[1:07:29] find their
[1:07:30] places he's praying oh it's just so
[1:07:33] powerful let this hit home go listen to
[1:07:35] harvest time even listening to uh the
[1:07:40] unveiling of
[1:07:42] God he says make the little housewife so
[1:07:45] sweet and
[1:07:46] humble that she'll be able to lead
[1:07:48] others to
[1:07:51] you and they that be
[1:07:53] wise shall shine
[1:07:57] shine right we think glow like this is
[1:08:00] glitter like oh wow w't want but he just
[1:08:04] says so sweet and
[1:08:06] humble that she'll be able to lead
[1:08:08] others to you the gift you give her that
[1:08:11] feminine little ladylike may she be so
[1:08:14] ladylike till the neighbors will see her
[1:08:16] and want to be like
[1:08:20] her the just in studying and reading and
[1:08:23] it's kind kind of become at the
[1:08:25] Forefront in some of the news
[1:08:28] reporting just
[1:08:30] how uh trying to think of just the right
[1:08:33] way to say
[1:08:34] this there's this brand of Christian
[1:08:37] woman that is real bold and
[1:08:40] loud and obnoxious about obeying their
[1:08:43] man right and it it's really in
[1:08:47] congruent with the whole concept I'm a
[1:08:49] real woman that stays at home and cooks
[1:08:51] for my husband while I'm Ming a
[1:08:53] following on Tik Tok and telling
[1:08:55] everybody about it right it's like
[1:08:57] that's not it's really a it's really a
[1:08:59] poor representation of what the Bible
[1:09:01] wants a man to be and what the Bible
[1:09:03] wants a woman to be may she be so
[1:09:06] ladylike till the neighbors will see her
[1:09:07] and want to be like her make the man the
[1:09:10] shop worker he says whoever he is Lord
[1:09:14] make him humble a humble life like
[1:09:17] Christ that others might
[1:09:20] see we don't know where those people are
[1:09:23] standing out there father
[1:09:25] but we never want to leave the Grand Old
[1:09:28] Highway we don't want to get off the
[1:09:29] beaten path we don't want to get go
[1:09:32] astray we want to twist away from the
[1:09:33] program of God we don't want to mess the
[1:09:35] real program of God we don't want to
[1:09:36] twist our swells away from the real
[1:09:38] thing he says but we'll lean backwards
[1:09:41] Lean Forward reach way out anywhere to
[1:09:43] get a
[1:09:45] soul I want to stay in the simple life
[1:09:48] and reach forward lean backwards reach
[1:09:51] way out anywhere to get a soul put that
[1:09:54] Within our reach Lord we
[1:09:57] pray and give us the life that would
[1:10:00] cause people to want to live like that
[1:10:03] as we consecrate ourselves to you that's
[1:10:07] the simple
[1:10:10] life in summary I could say this when I
[1:10:14] looked at
[1:10:15] this The Simple Life of
[1:10:18] Christ that life that Taps into the
[1:10:20] mystery of
[1:10:22] Christ it's the life that just it lives
[1:10:24] as Christ Christ would live and in the
[1:10:26] way we could say Christ was an ordinary
[1:10:29] but he's made a he set an example for us
[1:10:33] he's got a program there's something
[1:10:34] that's in that ordinary course of
[1:10:37] Christ and I'm not trying to get caught
[1:10:39] up on the the pattern Interruption that
[1:10:42] the word can be at times or just how
[1:10:44] extraordinary The Life of Christ is and
[1:10:46] how times God does things out of the
[1:10:48] ordinary way and if something's just in
[1:10:49] the same ordinary course it's not God
[1:10:52] but there's a way that it fits with the
[1:10:53] Scripture it fits with the word and
[1:10:56] we've gotten in our ruts and we've
[1:10:57] gotten in our Traditions but the simple
[1:10:59] life that I'm identifying today is the
[1:11:03] that life that living that living the
[1:11:05] word of
[1:11:07] God in light of the great things that
[1:11:09] have happened today because that's the
[1:11:12] purpose of the great things that
[1:11:13] happened we're living in Satan's Eden
[1:11:16] where the power of Darkness powers of
[1:11:18] Darkness are worse than they've ever
[1:11:19] been before there's more Temptation in
[1:11:21] this age than there's ever been before
[1:11:23] there's never been more Darkness there's
[1:11:24] never been more perversion the onslaught
[1:11:26] of perversion is so great so what does
[1:11:29] God give his bride so that she could
[1:11:31] overcome the word he's given her the
[1:11:34] word and Satan now if he gives you the
[1:11:37] word and you have the word Satan is
[1:11:39] going to try to twist you away from the
[1:11:41] word and if he can't get you away from
[1:11:43] the word it is written he'll find other
[1:11:46] schemes to offer you to where you're
[1:11:48] starting to live this extravagant comp
[1:11:52] complicated Christian Life that isn't
[1:11:55] the the simple life that you're supposed
[1:11:57] to
[1:11:58] live there's so much there in this image
[1:12:02] for us to take into
[1:12:05] consideration maybe go back and listen
[1:12:07] to those things or read those things if
[1:12:09] you want the quotes I can provide them
[1:12:10] for you just get humble stay humble live
[1:12:12] the life go on and live a good Christian
[1:12:14] Life we're not leaving Behind these
[1:12:16] things we're in them we're studying them
[1:12:19] we're learning them they're unfolding to
[1:12:20] us we stay in the word of God we pray we
[1:12:21] read our Bibles we feed on the word of
[1:12:23] God and then always remind yourself the
[1:12:25] outcome of that the product should be to
[1:12:27] live a Christian
[1:12:30] Life and I believe that we can simplify
[1:12:32] Our
[1:12:34] Lives by getting deeper with
[1:12:37] Christ God bless you today thank you so
[1:12:40] much for your prayers for me God is good
[1:12:42] God's doing great things just excited
[1:12:44] about all the things that God is doing
[1:12:47] in our church what God is doing in other
[1:12:48] people's lives I could even say this
[1:12:50] it's exciting and thrilling to see God
[1:12:53] moving in other people's lives even if
[1:12:55] they're
[1:12:57] moving if it's God we Rejoice we're
[1:13:00] happy and if it's not God we don't want
[1:13:02] to
[1:13:03] Rejoice right we sorrow maybe we pray we
[1:13:06] desire God uh uh uh to bless but let me
[1:13:08] say this God watches out over the
[1:13:11] faithful he watches out over the
[1:13:13] faithful and we will not fear what man
[1:13:15] could do unto us uh we won't fear the
[1:13:18] things that are for boing the things
[1:13:20] that are on the horizon if God allows it
[1:13:22] it's for my good in his glory and and so
[1:13:25] just remain
[1:13:27] steadfast a a and look for the good and
[1:13:29] and busy ourselves with one another
[1:13:32] because God is doing such Supernatural
[1:13:34] things in our midst and we may not even
[1:13:36] see them but they're happening but the
[1:13:38] reason why we don't see them is we're
[1:13:39] looking right over the top of them but
[1:13:41] as I have the advantage point the
[1:13:43] vantage point today I can just look and
[1:13:45] see the goodness of God and all that
[1:13:48] he's doing so don't look past it today
[1:13:50] as you are dismissed soon you see one
[1:13:52] another just look at what God is doing
[1:13:55] and rejoice in it in one another and
[1:13:58] desire to be the wise who shine as the
[1:14:01] brightness of the firmament and turn
[1:14:03] many to
[1:14:04] God that's what you're going to do by
[1:14:06] burning for Christ by being a light and
[1:14:08] living the Christian Life oh Lord make
[1:14:11] me that humble shop worker make me that
[1:14:14] humble housewife let me be man let me be
[1:14:17] lady like whatever your calling may be I
[1:14:19] just want to be doing what I'm supposed
[1:14:21] to be doing could we pray together you
[1:14:24] can stand your feet while we pray
