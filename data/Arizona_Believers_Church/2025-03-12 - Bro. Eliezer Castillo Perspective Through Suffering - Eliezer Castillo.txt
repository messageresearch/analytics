TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so that scripture um you know I've read it a lot of times and it's helped me in my personal life but here Paul this is chapter 4 Paul is is telling the Corinthians that the the very um light and temporal Affliction it it's it's a very light and it's temporal and it's that compared to the Eternal weight of Glory but um if you go to 2 Corinthians 12 7 and 10 here he's talking about a different thing he's uh ex crying out to the Lord here he says and lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations there was given there was given um me uh given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of Satan to Buffet me lest I should be exalted above measure for this thing I besought the Lord Thrice and that it might depart from me so here Paul he's um struggling here yet in the other scriptures he says our Affliction is very light and it's very um it's just for a moment and here in in um when he's talking about his Thorn there's no indication that Paul found any joy in this Thorn um he didn't he wasn't content of in the presence in fact he was very troubled and it earn early and earnestly desire to be free from it he he cried to the Lord three times Lord take this away from me so at first he couldn't even see any spiritual benefit in this Thorn he didn't see any sanctifying purpose in it it seemed like an overwhelming burden which which is why precisely he prayed Lord take this away from me so this is first he's telling us that affliction is just for a moment and it's very very light he's given us a perspective here because we we're all going through something one way or another whether it's a physical pain whether it's through a family whether it's going uh Financial issues whatever it might be we're going through a pain we're going through some kind of valy we're going through something that we say Lord take away this Thorn take away this this trouble that we're going through but Paul's giving us an eternal perspective and say is as just a little one compared to what God has in store for us but then now you see Paul in his situation he said Lord take it away from me Lord take this away from me and and honestly whenever we're going through our situations it's easy to forget the vision yeah it's easy to forget the perspective that God wants us to have whenever we're going through something you know it's so easy to have faith for somebody else right it's so easy to say you know what brother I'm praying for you you're going to get up and you're going to do this again but let us have the same thing and we say Lord why me Lord why am I going through this but there there's a certain cloudiness a certain uh thing that takes away our vision takes away our perspective and that is called suffering that is called Affliction and Paul he needed to be reminded saying everything works for good to those who love God God needed to remind him why he was going through these things 2 Corinthians 12 verses 9 and 10 this is Jesus answering him he said and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness Mo so here's that's Jesus he says my grace is sufficient for thee and my strength is made perfect in weak now Paul he sees this he gets another perspective he of of the word he sees what the Lord is doing and he says most gladly therefore I will rather glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ May rest upon me and there he says therefore I take pleasure in infirmities in reproaches in Necessities in persecutions in distress for Christ's sake for when I am weak then then I am strong now there is nobody that can wor Worship the Lord and glory in their infirmities nobody's like oh thank you Lord for another one thank you Lord that I'm suffering but when God can give you an opening a vision a perspective of why you're going through this and saying hey I'm here with you I'm in the darkness with you I'm leading you through these things then you can say Lord thank you Father thank you and not only that but Jesus says that my grace is sufficient my strength is made perfect now we all know what that word perfect is it's to be complete right my my strength is perfected in you Paul says wow so when I'm in this problem when I'm in this struggle therefore I am strong I am strong in the Lord whenever I'm weak in this flesh I am weak in my life but Brothers often it's difficult to discern God's purpose through the lens of suffering suffering it has a way of clouding our perspective and making it Challen challenging to see beyond the immediate pain or hardship when we're first uh when we're in the midst of difficult circumstances whether it's a loss of a loved one Health crisis Financial struggles relation relational Brokenness and you could fill that in whatever you're going through it's it's hard to see that it can feel as if everything is chaotic and and the most the thing that we have to worry about or not worry about but watch out for is that it's all of it is without meaning that's where we have to be careful that our suffering our this chaotic life that we're going through whatever we're going through is without a meaning that's when a person can go into dark roads right because there is no purpose there see Paul is saying our light Affliction it's it's working towards an eternal weight of Glory it's working for something but you take that working out you take that meaning that purpose that perspective out right and a person can become resentful right bitter yes lost they they they don't have their faith is gone why because their anchor is gone Romans 8:28 it says that and we know all things work together for good to them that love God and to them who are called according to his purpose we have to take that to heart when we're going through those things we have to take that say everything works for good everything works for good but it's hard for a lot of people to see that Vision because they begin to compare what shall be to what is now right oh Lord Lord you said you're going to give me this but look at me now we look at our present condition we look at the situation we're going on now then it's hard to see the promise I I believe if we want to think about the children of Israel that's exactly what happened to them they actually they didn't look at their present condition but they were looking at the condition back there and say ah we were actually better off over there brother branam in the message Christ speak he was talking about how Moses had the vision and because Moses had a vision he was able to take all of the people out of Egypt because he saw them as perfect people when Pharaoh he saw them and they're just bunch of uh mud dobbers and and worthless slaves but when Moses saw him he had a different perspective right he saw the children of God and whenever he got the children of God and he began to take him to the promised land he knew what the purpose was he knew what the goal was the goal was the promised land but a lot of times man when hunger begins to start whenever things start happening in our lives we begin to murmur and we say man the garlic was better out there right we need to have that perspective that the Lord wants to show us the problem with suffering is is we focus on the now present discomfort and uncertainty our vision be begins to be uh narrow centered solely on the pain we're experiencing this makes it hard to see the bigger picture of God's plan we may struggle to understand how our suffering could fit into a larger Divine Purpose or why God would allow us to go through such trials that a lot of times it's a why me a lot of times is why do I have to go through this what's happening here but it's because we're focusing on what is going on now I really like what brother Brandon every time he talks about Jonah and um you know he has a lot of things to say about Jonah but when Jonah was in the belly of the fish the whatever you want to call it he says that he was in the worst condition we could ever find ourselves in he said whenever he looked here he saw whales belly he looked there he saw whales belly when he looked there he saw whales belly that was his perspective right then and there that's where he was at that was his condition brother bandam says that was his symptoms we look at our symptoms we look at our condition we see what's going on in the family we see what's going on with sons and daughters we see what's going on at work whatever is going on and that's all whales belly but but Jonah he chose to have a vision he chose to listen to God's word and he says all that I see are lying vanities man to say that your present condition is nothing but a lie that's bold to say to say that oh well sister you have this well you're going through this brother you're you have that but that's a lie maybe the the doctor can say this maybe my situation can say this but they're all lying vanities cuz I'm looking toward your temple Lord I'm looking toward your word in Proverbs 29:18 it says where there is no vision the people perish but he that keepeth the law happy is he now that that's a for me that's a very profound scripture um the word Vision it's I believe it's pronounced uh kazon kazone something like that chazon but it's vision and it's it's what it says it's a sight it's a dream or it's a revelation or an oracle it's a spiritual sight of God or it's prophecy so where where there is no Revelation the people perish when there's that not that contact with the word being made manifest to us there there's a perishing going on in us um brother brandham says in the message come let us reason together he says I put my arm around him a real brother I said my beloved brother every time you open up the Bible you see a vision God revealing himself here is God's Vision just open it up open and say God now open my eyes that I can see you the word is God in the beginning was the word and the word was um with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelled Among Us and he's here God and every time you open up the Bible you see a vision of God speaking forth to you set with a humble heart so every time we see God's word and God says don't worry every time God's word tells you that there is another way that is a vision that's a vision outside of the condition even if if we're in a condition of a habitual condition where we can't get out we can't get out of of our uh present condition of maybe lukewarmness who knows what it is his word takes us out his word will always help us out Vision it keeps you moving when you see something then you can walk to it because you're looking at the destination it's something you can't touch but it's there you're you can see it you're walking towards it now the word to perish because it says where there is no vision the people perish now people start beginning to think like oh my goodness we're going to we're going to die we're going to perish but this word actually means to be loose to be loosened of restraint bear go back make naked set not perish or uncover so where there's no living Revelation no perceived contact between God and man there the bonds which hold the people together are relaxed and broken yeah good whenever there's when we cannot see the word when there is no vision when we don't have our our hearts towards the word of God then what happens is we begin to lose restraint we see that in the children of Israel every time the man that had the vision when he would leave the scene what happened the mice would go out to play When the cat is gone right and that's the same thing when we don't have the word when the word is not within us every single day then we begin to break down we begin to lose restraint we begin to to uh see our issues and and and begin to be formed and transformed by the issue that we have we begin to be defeated and um change a lot of people um sometimes they lose that vision and when you lose that Vision what happens whenever we're going through a struggle we lose the vision of the word what happens well then it's easy to as simple as not coming to church as simple as as uh not wanting to serve the Lord anymore why there's no meaning purp this this Affliction without meaning then we don't see the goal then it's easy to just become bare like the word says perish lose restraint from our lives a lot of times a person can walk into that just continue to walk a Christian walk without knowing the destination let me just keep walking but they don't have the vision anymore they've lost restraint and they're walking suffering without a purpose or with without purpose here in second Corinthians the the verse that we read in the beginning he says for our light Affliction which is um but for a moment worketh now I really want to hit that word worketh for us a far more exceedingly an eternal weight of Glory The New International Version says instead of worketh it says achieving New Living trans translation says yet they produce English uh Standard Version says preparing so it's it's a producing that our Affliction doesn't only uh we just don't just go through it so that we can get to a goal but it's actually producing the Eternal weight of glory amen that that Eternal weight of Glory that we're waiting on that we're looking at it not it's not necessarily out there but day by day we're producing it I I don't want to take away from this eternal weight of Glory but just like in uh Corinthians I believe 3:18 it says whenever they you behold the glory you become the glory from Glory unto Glory so there there's there's a sense of every struggle that we go through every daily life that we live we are becoming that glory and we're growing into that there's a preparing there there is a growing into that Glory every single moment every single suffering that we're going through and that gives your suffering purpose so this glory is not uh is not going to only be a consequence of these AFF afflictions but the afflictions will be the cause of it yeah it will be the cause of your actual Glory every single thing that you go through that's Glory being manifested here he says that the glory of God has not is not only a reward that it comes after suffering but it's all the very thing that is being worked through us as we Face the trials the afflictions we adore endure they're not pointless nor they're not just merely obstacles in the way of Glory but they are the very tools God uses to bring us into the fullness of his glory shaping us preparing us to reflect his divine presence in a deeper and more profound way Romans 5: 3 to4 it says not only so but we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh patience and patience experience and experience hope the word experience a lot of people want to translate that as character the word I think it's dominik or it's a strange word but it it's actually trustworthiness that our tribulation it's working into a perfect image or character of Christ this suffering that we're going through and jesus' suffering and death was not merely a means of to secure his glory but it was progressively revealing and making manifest the very uh image of God his suffering was it was manifesting God so Jesus says the son of man has to is going to be glorified and whenever he said that then he said but if a seed falls on the ground and lest it die it will not bring forth anything but when it dies will bring forth much fruit so his death his suffering was going to bring forth you and I his suffering was going to bring forth life brother brandham he says this in the exposition of the seven Church ages the samiran church age he says you see they could not figure out God's love they thought love meant no suffering they thought love meant a baby with parental care but God's said his love is elective love the proof of his love is election that no matter what happened his love was proven truly by the fact that they were chosen unto salvation because God had chosen you unto salvation through the sancti sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth he may commit you to death as he did Paul he may commit you to suffering as he did job that is his prerogative he is Sovereign but it is all with a purpose that that comforts me there let me die let me suffer but it's all with a purpose man purpose is greater than gold the Bible says by the like the trial of your faith is more precious than gold why there's a purpose there if he did not have a purpose then he would be the author of frustration and not of Peace his purpose is that after we have suffered a while we would be made perfect be established strengthened and settled as job said he puts strength in US job 23:6 you see himself you see he himself suffered he learned obedience by the things he suffered we want know obedience we want to know Lord let me get closer to you man there's going to be a lot of suffering a lot of going through things and it's not that so much that God's like ah put them in the fire but it's so much where where we go through things knowing that we are Cut From a Different Cloth we're we're we're different than the world because you know I I have just to give you a little insight and um I'm sure we can see this everywhere but I I have an uncle that he he's he went through so much he went through so much rejection he went through so much in his life to where in the end of his life he was just you did one thing wrong to him that's it you're cut off he he built himself so many barriers and so many complexes in his life to where nobody can touch him nobody's going to hurt me nobody and and sometimes we think we're we're protecting ourselves like that we think we're by creating a wall of of a hard heart of bitterness of oh I'm not talking to that person no more I'm not going to do this no more I'm not going to do that for them no more and we feel like we're protecting our heart but what's going on is enclosing ourselves right we're we're we're creating all of these strongholds in our lives so that the devil can sit there and say ah we got them ah yeah look at now we're we're the ones on top but we're sitting there hurt feeling like we're we're uh safe in these complex walls but we're literally in prison we're in strongholds we're in things that that simply we cannot forgive no more we can't love properly anymore but whenever a person can look at purpose and look at the greater thing look at what Jesus is doing then you can every lash that you take every trial that you take you know thank God is for a purpose thank God Lord Praise Your holy name and in one day through all of that suffering and trials God will use it for his perfection so he says the very character of Jesus was perfected by suffering according to Paul he has left the church a measure of suffering that they too by faith in God will suffer for him would God come in place uh come into a Perfection why did he want this James 1: 124 he says brother count it all joy when you fall into diverse Temptations knowing this is that the trying of your faith worketh patience but the patience have her have her perfect work that ye may be perfect entire wanting nothing you know every Mark that Jesus had everything that he went through it was all for a purpose in uh Isaiah 53 2-12 we know that scripture a lot but just to see the perspective of that he hath borne our griefs verse four so think about it his grief was a purpose to Bear ours he carried our sorrows yet we esteemed him stricken smitten of God and Afflicted he was wounded for our transgressions now I just want you to think about that and personalize it you were wounded but brother Bram just said in this the the quote that I gave you that he has a portion of suffering for his bride that there's a portion of suffering for the church and you have to think that your wounding your suffering is for a purpose for somebody else he says he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed praise God everything that he went through think of just just to think about I don't know if everybody anybody's watched The Passion of the Christ I I can't that's that's a hard movie to just watch and and that's probably not even half of it what he went through the suffering in gsem all everything that he had to go through think about every lashing that he took my name was on there yeah amen everything was for a purpose and what if he said I'm done why cuz he was looking at the present condition and he says I'm done with this but a brother Bram says that his hardest moment was at the Garden of Gethsemane because that's where he made his choice to give his life to the Lord or give his life for the world that's where he made his hardest choice and that's why he said Lord just run the books again look over everything again and see if there's another way that's what he basically said if it's not if it's your will let this cup pass from me Lord said it's my will for you to die Let It Be Your Will then and there he accepted the suffering and then after that he already made his decision after that then the suffering came but he made his decision to suffer for us and every mark our name is on it your healing is on those marks those stripes that beating that death that cry we were in that suffering it can cause bitterness when when we think our suffering is unfair unending or beyond control this sense of hopelessness or Injustice it will would often breed negative emotions resentment anger deep sense of of being wronged you know the sad part of of bitterness is is that you're the victim that it it's not that you're a bad person that the but the the the person that's receiving this bitterness is the victim they're the ones that have been hurt they're the ones that have caused there's pain that's caused to them and yet if they do not see the purpose of God or see the word or forgive for forgive whoever is hurting them then they become full of resentment anger bitterness I truly believe with all of my heart Jesus wasn't a victim I believe this was in Isaiah 532 hundreds of years before Jesus even died God already prepared his suffering yes what about ours but we look at it right now and I'm the victim and I'm I'm the one that's being hurt and and forget all of them but yet God already pre-ordained that even before the foundation of the world the lamb was already slain and Jesus had to understand those words and to understand the prophecy that was behind him and there's I believe with all of my heart heart there's prophecy behind us there's prophecy for the bride today yes she is to endure suffering yes she's in uh ready to endure it though she's pressurized she she's built for pressure she's built for all of these things because God gave it to us from our limited perspective our human perspective the pain it seems overwhelming but God's Eternal perspective sees beyond that moment he sees everything that's why we have to get into this word not because of historical context not because of anything else but because this is a vision of our future this is what shows us how we're going to overcome am that we are more than Overcomers you know I I know we've probably heard it a lot of times in churches while it's like oh one day we're going to just drag drag ourselves to heaven and we're going to say we finally made it we finally made it with bruises and cuts the the Bible doesn't say that though it says that we are more than conquerors now we're not just a conqueror because just a conqueror can just barely make it we're more right we're going to go there and we're going to be beholding or we're going to be bearing all of these things but these are going to be our Victory your your scars your wounds are the means for the glory that you re him everything Jesus suffered it was for his glory his glory was being manifest by the whippings by the suffering by by the hunger by all of that his glory was being manifested and now we see him here in uh he died and he rose again and we see him with scars and that's a beautiful thing because Jesus he didn't need to have scars in his glorified body now this was Ultimate fulfillment or ultimate Glory his glorified body and in his glory he Beed every single scar that he had wow our problems it's either going to defeat us or it's going to develop us we're either going to become people like the world hateful and no love right or we're going to become glorified yes we're going to be and what did he do with those scars man look at what you guys did look at look at the pain you've caused me no when somebody was unbelieving beling when somebody was weak in faith when Thomas was like I I don't know if I can believe him I don't know I don't know if if he's the one he's said the only way I'll be able to believe him is to see his scars he said come here Thomas look it that his car was not just to show what he suffered but it was a confirmation of the miracle of Resurrection I'm the the same one that died and your scars your suffering your things that you went through is a confirmation of your Miracle of what you've gone through in your life so that you can become that person to somebody else somebody's going through it somebody's going through an unbelieving phase somebody's going through a trial that they can't go through and you can go and show them your scars and say this is what I've gone through this is how God gave me the miracle gave me the promise you become that what do your marks testify today what do my marks my trials all my wounds that I've gone through what are they saying about me man grumpy grumpy guy he didn't want to talk to nobody or he's this and he's that man I you know you close yourself off you you you try to hide but what is it we became a victim of these things when there's prophecy over your trials how can I become a victim of what God already pre-ordained how could I be that no I become That Glory for somebody else how when somebody's struggling you begin to sympathize or empathize with that person how I I remember there's a um a brother that preached a message I already forgot what it's called but it's basically the gift of suffering or the gift of understanding and it's he was talking about how you could understand somebody else's grief how do we do it because a lot of times you know you see a a bum in the streets or you see somebody that's struggling like oh man poor guy here let me give him a dollar man poor guy and then we forget him about that person that's normal that's human life right there but when we enter into their pain when somebody can that that was the gift of Jesus Christ that's why Jesus could enter into pain it it it actually helped that he could he knew what they their whole life so he knew when they were babies he knew when they were smiling when then everything was good and then he knew when everything changed yeah when the trouble started when the problems happened saw and he's like Ah that's why that's why he could see talk to Legion and just like brother brandham said oh first it was one drink was one devil next drink another devil until it was legance of devils that's how much he drank brother brandham he saw that in people there was one time where brother Bram he was praying for a Mexican man in a prayer line and this man would he he the way he explain is just amazing but his his face was just all wrinkled and he was missing shoes and he was he couldn't say anything I think he had a um what is a rosary and he was he was there a Catholic man and when he saw that man he said that's my dad what did he do he entered into to his pain because he already suffered through that with his father he already went through those things he had a scar he was able to help somebody because of his own wounds his own scars he said hey Dad that's what he called him hey Dad come up here started looking at his shoe took off his shoe and checked his foot and it didn't fit him but what did he do he entered into his pain there was one time where you know we know the story of how him and his wife they suffered and and his wife ended up dying his then he's there seeing his baby daughter looking at her says that she was suffering so much that her eyes began to cross that's that's a suffering of of a man that suffering that we go through with our family that that's suffering when there's a a loved one that passes on that's a suffering when when a child doesn't want to serve the Lord that's a suffering whenever we're we're going through sicknesses we're going through those sufferings but we what do we use those sufferings for yeah are we mad are we bitter are we close off the world or we begin to use our own scars to heal others he said there will never be another person that's cross-side that will not be healed that's what he said because of his own daughter he said God will never permit it every person that's crosy would have been was going to be healed in a prayer line he said why because his heart went out for that person so much cuz he would his daughter every time the gift of understanding somebody suffering the gift of bearing your own scars he didn't have to suffer he didn't have to go through those things he did it for us there was one time when the devil when he you know his daughter died the devil God rejected him a black sheep came down and the devil began to say oh you trusted in him you did all these things for him and look at he just rejects you he he starts doing that and he said at my weakest moment see Paul he had a weakest moment Paul could tell us hey there there's our light Affliction just for a moment but yet when he's in it he said Lord take it away Lord help me why when you're in it just as a human if it wasn't for God we would break if it wasn't for God where would we be yes and there the devil's trying to do the same thing saying just reject him just just turn away and he says if it w if it hadn't been for that moment if it hadn't been for God taking me through he said there would no be not be a church here he was talking about Jeffersonville brother we wouldn't have a message right brother we we wouldn't have the word revealed through a prophet if he he caved in and and sometimes we look at our issues we think oh lord it's just let me just throw the towel but had it not been for the Lord bringing you through there there wouldn't be people serving the lord now there wouldn't be people blessed by your life if you didn't if you didn't uh um give your heart to the Lord if you didn't over come that trial Jesus you know I I heard a brother once say and it's a funny little quote but he said there's only one man-made thing that that is in heaven he said that's the scars that Jesus has Jesus he chose to take it to Heaven whenever they announced the lion they he saw bloody lamb he saw a wounded person I bear my scars I bear my trials I bear everything because our names are on that our names are in this in his suffering we are there even to the point where the Jews are going to be saved through the S the scars of Jesus they're going to say who who are you and then they he shows them his scars and he says who who Did That to You Lord he said from the the house of my friends my own people my own loved ones so by the the whole salvation is through this this suffering that Jesus had to go through the bride is going to go through the same thing and um as I'm kind of closing I I started thinking about Joseph his story is is remarkable because it's an example of how problems and trials can either defeat or develop us fa facing this immense suffering that Joseph did um everything that he' gone through but his faith his wisdom and ability to forgive led him to a place of prominence and purpose he was not defeated by his circumstances but developed into a leader God intended him to be this narrative encourages us to view our struggles through the lens of God's purpose trusting that even the hardest challenges can lead to spiritual growth and fulfillment of uh God's greater plan whenever his his brothers they saw him and they cried because he finally revealed himself to them they they said they were scared and he said you thought of evil you thought evil against me but God meant it unto good to bring to pass as it in this day to save much people alive so every suffering that he went through his brothers they hated him he was he he was a little rascal but God gave him a vision or a dream what the Bible says they gave him a dream of him being a great man him being over all of his brothers being over his um own father and mother and even the father and mother were like even we're going to have to worship you we're going to have to bow down to you and the brothers resented him so much that they threw him into a pit and they wanted to kill him but one of the brothers repented and they sold him suffering suffering what do you think he went through what do you think he thought in his mind I wonder if he begin to think about that vision and sayl was was that just did I just sleep too late did I just eat too late or was this you Lord I believe he believed in that Vision I believe he stood on that word because he kept his Integrity whenever he was sold to potier his Piper's wife um um falsely accused him he was put into prison he even helped the Baker and the the Butler and the butler forgot about him all of these things all of these trials where he could have said I give up yet every single piece every single trial was a step closer to his glory that was a piece a part of the puzzle so whenever we're going through our things our going just remember that's just a step that's just a step to the glory that's another step that's another reason that's another purpose that's another uh achievement to the glory that God is going to give me there finally when they saw him he said you thought evil God meant good right no matter what is going on no matter what anybody can Tre how they treat you they could think bad things people can think they can dis the devil can think he could distort God's plan but God me means it for good he means it for your Victory he means it for the glory let us stand to our feet I I truly believe that every single scar is so that we can be a help to others that we could Rejoice with those that are rejoicing just as Romans 125 16 it says Rejoice with them that do rejoice weep with them that weep be of the same mind toward one another mind not High um high things but condescend to Men of
