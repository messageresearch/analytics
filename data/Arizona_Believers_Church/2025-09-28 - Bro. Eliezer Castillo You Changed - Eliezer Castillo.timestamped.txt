[0:00] If you'd like to turn with me to uh
[0:02] Romans 12:2,
[0:06] go straight into the scriptures.
[0:09] I have a really strange title and it's
[0:11] not that I wanted to um you know, I
[0:14] wanted to have a weird title or
[0:17] anything. I just couldn't think it just
[0:18] whenever God gave me this inspiration,
[0:21] that's all that was popping up is this
[0:24] thought of you changed. All right.
[0:26] &gt;&gt; And I I don't know if um you've like had
[0:29] a family member, especially a young one
[0:33] you haven't seen in maybe even two
[0:34] months. Then you see them again and
[0:37] they've to grown taller than you.
[0:40] &gt;&gt; They have more uh facial hair than you.
[0:42] And you're like, "Whoa, you grew up.
[0:44] You've changed. You've" And um that's
[0:47] kind of the thought that I have is um
[0:50] this thought of maybe it's not drastic.
[0:54] Maybe it's every day, but there's this
[0:56] thought of, wow, whenever a perspective
[0:59] or somebody sees you and they say, whoa,
[1:02] you've changed.
[1:03] &gt;&gt; Something happened. And so that's kind
[1:06] of the the thought that I have today. If
[1:08] you'd like to um go in Romans 12:2,
[1:12] it says,
[1:14] "And be not conformed to this world, but
[1:18] be transformed by the renewing of your
[1:20] mind, that ye may prove what is of what
[1:24] is that um what is that good and
[1:27] acceptable and perfect will of God."
[1:30] &gt;&gt; Let us uh pray one more time. Heavenly
[1:33] Father, Lord, we've read your scripture.
[1:36] We just want to put everything in your
[1:38] hands, Lord. Father, you know every
[1:40] heart. You know every desire. You know
[1:43] every need. And we just ask that your
[1:45] word may go forth and fulfill the needs,
[1:48] Lord, according to your will. We give
[1:50] you the honor and the glory. We give you
[1:52] the preeminence. In the name of Jesus
[1:53] Christ, we pray. Amen. And amen. You may
[1:56] be seated.
[1:58] So, um Paul is is clearly telling the
[2:01] Romans um a very clear thing. He's
[2:03] saying, "Be not conformed, be
[2:06] transformed." And um if anybody ever
[2:09] want to look at those words, they're two
[2:11] different words. They're not two, you
[2:13] know, the same. He's saying, "Don't be
[2:16] fashioned like the world. Don't be
[2:17] molded by the the things of the world."
[2:20] And then he's he's saying another word
[2:22] to be transformed. It's almost like
[2:24] metamorphosis.
[2:26] It's to meta means uh uh to be uh I
[2:31] believe it means to be changed and
[2:33] morphe is another form. So to be changed
[2:35] into another form inwardly. Don't be
[2:39] conformed outwardly by the things of the
[2:41] world but to be changed inwardly because
[2:43] that's the greatest change. Right? Um to
[2:46] bring a historical context to this
[2:48] verse, it's not like I'm going to go
[2:50] completely deep into this this verse,
[2:52] but I just want to shed some light. Um
[2:54] he wrote this book of Romans around 55
[2:58] to 58 AD. People kind of pinpoint it to
[3:01] 57 AD. And during that time he wrote
[3:05] this letter. Rome was arguably the the
[3:08] epicenter of the world for political
[3:11] views for the culture for um economic
[3:16] military. It was Rome. Rome was the
[3:19] spot. If you would like to think about
[3:21] it as the New York City or LA or even
[3:24] Phoenix, these great epicenters, these
[3:28] great places um for a lot of things, a
[3:31] lot of culture, a lot of things flowing
[3:33] in and out. Um Rome was that place,
[3:37] right? And so Rome was it was a mashup
[3:40] of cultures, mashup of different
[3:43] religions and and uh you had Roman gods
[3:47] like Jupiter and mystery cults in the
[3:49] east of the east and you had a Jewish
[3:52] community and and um you had people
[3:54] worshiping even Nero himself. It was
[3:56] Nero the emperor and you had them
[3:59] worshiping other emperors that passed
[4:01] on. They had um worshiping just other
[4:04] gods. And so this is kind of the scene
[4:07] that we see ourselves in in um with Paul
[4:11] and um and
[4:14] you see these people you you see um
[4:17] different ideas clash. You see
[4:18] philosophers and you see poets and you
[4:21] see all these people um you know vying
[4:26] for attention
[4:28] &gt;&gt; and a lot of the culture it kind of
[4:30] leaned into access. So you you had these
[4:32] gladiator fights and you you had excess
[4:35] partying and you had all these moral
[4:37] standards decaying and it it was just a
[4:40] horrible place.
[4:41] &gt;&gt; I'm sure we don't know any place like
[4:43] that today, right?
[4:45] &gt;&gt; Well, it's a good picture of today.
[4:48] &gt;&gt; And it's not there's not one epicenter
[4:50] of a place like that where it's a mashup
[4:52] of culture, a mashup of ideas and and
[4:55] philosophies, but it's every city that
[4:58] we go to now. It's it's every little
[5:01] town now. I I always used to think, man,
[5:04] you go to a little town, you kind of
[5:05] hide away from that. No, not with social
[5:07] media. Social media will get a thought,
[5:10] a culture, a trend right away to your
[5:13] doorstep as soon as you open up your
[5:15] phone.
[5:16] &gt;&gt; As soon as you open up social media, so
[5:18] you don't have to be in an epicenter
[5:21] anymore. It's everywhere. We we think
[5:23] about
[5:24] &gt;&gt; every place. you can go to the littlest
[5:27] village and somebody has a phone.
[5:30] &gt;&gt; So, um, we see that today and that's
[5:32] what was going on over there. And so,
[5:36] you have all these different types of
[5:38] groups and and within all these groups,
[5:41] you had a little tiny group that knew
[5:43] the truth and they were called
[5:44] Christians. A little handful of a bunch
[5:48] of people. Now, think about it. You have
[5:51] this great place and you have a bunch
[5:53] little handful of people that knew the
[5:56] truth. It was 57 AD. So it wasn't long
[6:00] be after what happened to Jesus Christ
[6:03] after the the resurrection and and what
[6:06] happened in the upper room. and and and
[6:08] now you have these people that that had
[6:11] personal experiences with Jesus Christ
[6:14] living in this whole mashup, this
[6:16] conglomerate of sin,
[6:19] &gt;&gt; knowing the truth,
[6:21] knowing the word of God. And Paul, he's
[6:25] telling these people, he's saying,
[6:27] "Don't be conformed.
[6:30] You know the truth. Do not be conformed
[6:34] to this world."
[6:36] He and these people, you know, Ro R
[6:38] Romans Rome's culture just like this one
[6:41] was a loud and proud culture.
[6:43] You were expected to join in join in to
[6:47] things like like the emperor worship
[6:49] like the all these festivals of uh big
[6:52] civic festivals of of honoring these
[6:55] pagan gods. All all this stuff was going
[6:58] on in this place.
[7:01] &gt;&gt; And it was one of those things of you
[7:03] have to be tolerant to this. You you
[7:06] have to accept these things. You have to
[7:08] accept the culture of the day.
[7:12] And now you have Christians in this
[7:14] place saying, "No thanks."
[7:17] And that could lead, if you think about
[7:20] it, that could lead you to being the
[7:22] weirdo, right?
[7:24] &gt;&gt; That could lead you to be the
[7:25] oldfashioned.
[7:27] That could lead you, it all left them
[7:31] almost as traitors. Now you have to
[7:33] think about it in this the context of
[7:35] the history it was 57 AD. In 64 AD
[7:41] the persecution of the Christians
[7:43] started
[7:44] where they begin to kill and murder
[7:47] these people. So there was already a
[7:49] tense vibe, a a tense uh thing going on
[7:53] with the Christians
[7:55] and these people were were
[7:59] pressuring by their culture, by their
[8:01] beliefs, by whatever they were, by their
[8:04] identities. Uh they pressured, they tug
[8:07] the believers, tempting them to blend in
[8:10] just to get by.
[8:12] Now, my inspiration for this message, it
[8:15] comes from, I'm sure, um, what we've all
[8:19] experienced in these few days, these few
[8:21] months, these few years of this distinct
[8:24] line drawn in the sand in this world.
[8:28] &gt;&gt; A a a distinct line of culture
[8:31] differences,
[8:33] of race differences, of political
[8:36] differences, of religious differences.
[8:38] There is a line being drawn
[8:42] from the whole world
[8:44] &gt;&gt; and and and if you as a person believes
[8:47] in Jesus Christ, you have already been
[8:49] categorized by the world.
[8:52] &gt;&gt; You have been categorized and there's
[8:54] this this pull on each side. I'm not
[8:57] saying one side is good. Both sides are
[8:59] controlled by the devil.
[9:01] whatever you want to say. If there's
[9:03] these racial issues, cultural issues,
[9:06] political issues, religious issues,
[9:11] &gt;&gt; American Christians is not what it's
[9:13] supposed to be.
[9:16] &gt;&gt; So, so, but these they've drawn a line
[9:18] to where it's like, oh, well, if you're
[9:20] this, then you this, you believe this,
[9:21] and you believe that. And each spot and
[9:25] each side is is causing people to say,
[9:28] "Hey, choose a side.
[9:31] &gt;&gt; Hey, conform.
[9:34] Hey, you got to tolerate.
[9:36] Hey, you've got to become."
[9:40] &gt;&gt; And there's this group of Christians,
[9:43] group of believers that know the truth.
[9:47] &gt;&gt; That that know that there is no there is
[9:50] no going on one side or the other.
[9:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. But there is a a a purpose that
[9:56] God has given each and every one of us.
[9:59] &gt;&gt; There is a duty that God has given a
[10:01] Christian knows just like Jesus when
[10:04] they said, "Well, what are you here to
[10:06] do?" You know, for the rel for the Jews
[10:10] and and for at that time, they weren't
[10:13] thinking about church. They weren't
[10:15] thinking about building churches and
[10:17] having pastors and and doing this and
[10:19] that. No. To the Jews, it was strictly
[10:23] uh uh government.
[10:26] &gt;&gt; They needed a king.
[10:28] They needed somebody to to pick sides
[10:31] with them so that they can overthrow the
[10:34] government.
[10:35] Hey, we've been in bondage too long. We
[10:39] need a king to step in so that we become
[10:42] the Jews and and we can establish our
[10:44] our kingdom again. So when Jesus came,
[10:48] they said, "Oh, so Pilate asked him, so
[10:50] you're the king of the Jews, huh?"
[10:53] "Oh, well, you're this and that." And he
[10:55] says, "You know what? My kingdom is not
[10:56] of this place."
[10:59] &gt;&gt; They wanted to establish something here.
[11:01] They wanted to say, "Oh, I'm this." But
[11:04] Jesus says, "My kingdom is not from this
[11:06] place."
[11:08] &gt;&gt; There there is no conforming. There is
[11:11] no changing this place.
[11:13] &gt;&gt; There's no changing the world.
[11:16] The greatest one of the greatest
[11:18] scriptures that everybody knows is for
[11:20] God so loved the world. People think,
[11:22] "Oh, God so loved the earth." No, he
[11:25] loved the world, the the the system, the
[11:28] order, the people that were in that
[11:30] order to change them,
[11:33] to change somebody inwardly and not
[11:36] change the things that are going on.
[11:39] So that's where my inspiration came. It
[11:42] actually came from was just all these
[11:44] things. And I I I'm not here to speak
[11:46] anything political or anything like
[11:48] that, but I'm just telling you how my
[11:51] inspiration came. And um it actually
[11:54] came from when the news happened to
[11:56] where all that happened with that
[11:58] person, you know, um getting shot and
[12:00] and hearing the story of the young man.
[12:05] And I don't care what anybody says. Oh,
[12:06] well, he was this and he was that and
[12:08] this was going on. The the one thing
[12:10] that inspired me I I believe that God
[12:14] showed me was this change from this
[12:17] young man not it doesn't mean what their
[12:19] the parents' political views were it was
[12:22] that they were Christians
[12:25] &gt;&gt; that they they believed in Christ I
[12:27] don't know if they were good Christians
[12:28] or they whatever they were but they had
[12:32] a certain value of the scripture
[12:35] &gt;&gt; and throughout his childhood he was
[12:37] living that life
[12:40] and somehow
[12:42] he goes out, goes to college and and
[12:45] adopts different views,
[12:48] adopts a different thought.
[12:52] So much so that he conforms, he's
[12:55] shaped, he's formed into the thoughts
[12:58] that has been fed to him to where he
[13:01] acts in this way.
[13:06] And people can say, "Whoa, he changed."
[13:09] Maybe his friends could say, "Whoa, that
[13:12] person changed. He wasn't like that when
[13:14] he was when he was here or when he was
[13:17] there, when we were in Bible school or
[13:19] whatever they were doing."
[13:22] I believe they were Mormon. So, whatever
[13:24] whatever place they were at, maybe they
[13:27] were like, "This is not the person that
[13:28] we we knew."
[13:30] but because a a pressure,
[13:34] an idea,
[13:36] a thought began to just knock at his
[13:40] door
[13:42] &gt;&gt; and he began to see things a little
[13:44] differently and and things began to
[13:46] happen. Now, I'm not I don't know what's
[13:50] going on you. There's so many
[13:51] conspiracies. I'm just thinking about
[13:52] the story. We can almost associate that
[13:55] story with anybody.
[13:58] We've got maybe family members, friends
[14:00] that that same things happen where where
[14:05] a thought begins to happen, a belief
[14:07] begins to happen, and their whole
[14:09] trajectory, their whole life begins to
[14:11] change because they they listen to
[14:14] something else.
[14:16] &gt;&gt; And and um
[14:19] now I I truly believe that there's a way
[14:22] that we can change as people
[14:24] &gt;&gt; and not not lose our belief. Yeah,
[14:28] &gt;&gt; I I believe that's called growth,
[14:30] &gt;&gt; right? So, we all change,
[14:33] &gt;&gt; we all grow. We all we all change into
[14:38] somebody else. I I heard once a man
[14:41] saying that um a man he was talking
[14:44] about his marriage and that he was
[14:45] saying that his wife was married to five
[14:47] different men and all of them were him.
[14:51] Why? because he changed that your
[14:54] 20-year-old self is not your 30-year-old
[14:57] self.
[14:58] &gt;&gt; And sometimes you want to look at that
[15:00] person be like, "Man, that guy was a
[15:02] dummy. That guy didn't know what he was
[15:05] doing. What is it?" He changed.
[15:09] &gt;&gt; So, so there is a changing there's
[15:11] there's a growing in a person where
[15:14] where
[15:15] you're not the same person that you
[15:17] were.
[15:18] &gt;&gt; We're meant to change. I believe that's
[15:22] that's the greatest thing that God has
[15:24] given us. That's what encapsulates free
[15:27] will and accepting and declining and and
[15:30] accepting certain things. And that's
[15:33] that's a process of change that God gave
[15:35] to the human race. Right?
[15:38] &gt;&gt; That is an authority that God gave to
[15:41] the human race where we can accept
[15:42] things, we can um not accept things and
[15:45] we can change and be formed to the very
[15:48] things that we believe in and we hold
[15:49] dear to.
[15:52] &gt;&gt; So that's called growth. But I I I truly
[15:56] believe what's going on in this world is
[15:58] people looking into this these changes.
[16:01] young people looking into changes and
[16:03] and seeing their emotions and
[16:05] identifying themselves by the feelings
[16:08] that they have and their change.
[16:10] &gt;&gt; So they begin to solidify their identity
[16:13] by the feelings and all these things
[16:15] that are happening and then you begin to
[16:17] find a bunch of crazy ideas.
[16:20] &gt;&gt; Yep. That's right.
[16:21] &gt;&gt; Because of the the attaching their
[16:25] identity to the little changes that
[16:27] we're going through. Wow.
[16:29] &gt;&gt; That's why you can see people becoming
[16:32] whatever they want to be. They can be
[16:34] she her and then turn into they them and
[16:37] non-binary and all these these ideas
[16:40] that are are fluid. They're not solid
[16:44] beliefs. These are things that can
[16:45] change from one day to the other. But if
[16:47] you don't categorize them the way they
[16:49] want you to, then you have committed
[16:52] unpardonable sin. Right?
[16:54] &gt;&gt; Even though they can change tomorrow.
[16:57] What is what is it changing with the
[17:00] cultures
[17:01] &gt;&gt; becoming fluid and and people don't know
[17:04] what they are. You can't you can't
[17:06] compare the '9s to today.
[17:09] &gt;&gt; Why? Culture, trends, technology, all
[17:13] these things just flow and they change
[17:15] and they move and all these things and
[17:17] you can't attach yourself, your identity
[17:20] to those kinds of things
[17:23] &gt;&gt; and say, "Oh, I am this."
[17:26] That's why the best thing to attach your
[17:28] identity is something solid,
[17:31] &gt;&gt; a solid belief. That's why I believe
[17:33] there's an identity crisis that is going
[17:36] on with the world, the the youth of the
[17:39] world.
[17:40] &gt;&gt; Why? There there's they don't know who
[17:42] they are, but they can find themselves
[17:46] in the word of God.
[17:49] &gt;&gt; They can find themselves
[17:51] in Christ.
[17:53] &gt;&gt; And you know what? It's not going to
[17:54] change
[17:56] &gt;&gt; tomorrow. It will not change.
[17:58] &gt;&gt; You can stand on the word. You can stand
[18:00] on who you are and things will not
[18:03] change.
[18:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:05] &gt;&gt; But um unfortunately that's the way the
[18:09] world is. The way they think that they
[18:11] can create their own identity, but they
[18:13] don't realize that that they're
[18:15] influenced by something that is going to
[18:18] change
[18:19] &gt;&gt; that is not solid.
[18:22] Um, I I truly believe that it's your
[18:24] belief that changes your identity. It's
[18:27] people that attaching a belief to
[18:29] certain things changes your moral
[18:32] compass, changes the way you dress, the
[18:34] way you act, the way you do things.
[18:38] is because you begin to believe in
[18:40] something and and maybe you somebody can
[18:43] hold on to Christ or hold on to a
[18:46] religion or hold on to whatever but then
[18:48] they begin to believe in something else
[18:50] automatically you cannot hold on to the
[18:52] other thing.
[18:54] &gt;&gt; You begin to be formed by what you
[18:56] believe in and and the things that we
[18:58] feed on that's what begins to change
[19:01] change us.
[19:02] &gt;&gt; So Paul he's he's basically telling us
[19:05] to stop conforming. Yeah.
[19:07] &gt;&gt; He says, "Do not be conformed." But it
[19:08] it this is a ongoing resist.
[19:12] &gt;&gt; Stop conforming. He's telling us to not
[19:15] just to isolate ourselves from the
[19:17] world. We can't do that. We can't be um
[19:20] Amish people, right? We can't just
[19:23] because what I realized and I I I heard
[19:26] this from a theologian, but it it was
[19:28] scriptural. He says that there's three
[19:31] things that a person has to be careful
[19:32] with and that is that is your flesh.
[19:36] that is the world and that's the devil.
[19:38] A lot of people what the Amish did was
[19:41] let's isolate ourselves from the world.
[19:45] &gt;&gt; Well, that's a good thing, but they
[19:46] still got their flesh and the devil to
[19:48] work with.
[19:50] &gt;&gt; Right? So, and people want to um you
[19:53] know fight with the flesh, but they got
[19:55] to remember about the world and the
[19:57] devil.
[19:58] &gt;&gt; Some people say, "Oh, it's the devil's
[20:00] fault." Yet, it's probably their own
[20:02] desires.
[20:04] &gt;&gt; That's right. So there there's things
[20:05] that you have to be careful with.
[20:08] &gt;&gt; There's things that you you you have to
[20:10] uh uh check up. There's a constant
[20:13] resisting from these things. And so it's
[20:16] not telling us to isolate from the
[20:18] world. It's not telling us but don't
[20:20] blend in.
[20:23] &gt;&gt; Don't try to chase these things. Don't
[20:26] try to become like everybody else.
[20:30] Because once we begin to adopt the
[20:32] thoughts of the world, we are just a
[20:35] number. There's nothing special about
[20:38] us. Maybe we think we're special and we
[20:40] think we're unique, but we become one of
[20:43] the fish going down the river just like
[20:45] everybody else.
[20:48] &gt;&gt; Going in the flow of the trend of the
[20:51] day,
[20:51] &gt;&gt; right?
[20:53] &gt;&gt; So, u it's telling us to resist those
[20:56] things. It's these fleeting fashions as
[20:58] as one commenter says is resist these
[21:01] fleeting fashions that are going to come
[21:03] and go. They might look harmless at the
[21:06] moment. They might
[21:08] they might think that you might think
[21:10] you're nothing's going to happen, but in
[21:12] the long run it can pull you away from
[21:13] your faith.
[21:16] &gt;&gt; And one day, somebody can walk to you
[21:19] and say, "You've changed."
[21:22] Maybe you can look in the mirror and
[21:24] say, "Whoa,
[21:25] what happened here?
[21:28] I changed
[21:30] what we begin to adopt little things
[21:32] here and there.
[21:34] We begin to conform."
[21:36] This conforming is a shaping and shaping
[21:39] and shaping every single day. Conforming
[21:43] until we look in the mirror and we don't
[21:44] know what we're looking at anymore.
[21:48] If you'd like to turn with me to
[21:49] Revelations
[21:52] 2:18.
[21:58] Forgot to put on my timer. So, um I'll
[22:02] just
[22:05] Revelations 2:18 and we'll read to uh
[22:08] from 18 to 20.
[22:21] says,
[22:23] "And unto the angel of the church of
[22:25] Thyia, write these things, sayith the
[22:27] Son of God, who hath eyes like unto a
[22:31] flame of fire, and his feet like unto
[22:33] fine brass." He says,"I know thy works
[22:37] and charity and service and faith and
[22:40] thy patience and thy works and uh and
[22:43] the last to be more than the first." I
[22:46] like that.
[22:48] Usually works degrade.
[22:52] Then then he says here, hold on, let me
[22:56] make sure.
[22:59] So in in Revelations
[23:02] 2:20
[23:04] it says,
[23:07] "Nevertheless,
[23:12] notwithstanding, I have a few things
[23:13] against thee, because thou sufferest
[23:17] that woman Jezebel, which calleth
[23:18] herself a prophetist, to teach and
[23:20] seduce my servants, to commit
[23:22] fornication, and to eat things
[23:24] sacrificed unto idols."
[23:27] Now, that's that's a big thing there.
[23:31] He begins to explain who this person is
[23:33] and and he begins to say what she's
[23:35] doing and and it's a horrible thing.
[23:38] And and the first thing I I love how
[23:40] Christ is. He he's doesn't come and he's
[23:43] not doesn't come to us and says, "Hey,
[23:45] your issue this let me tell you what
[23:46] your issue is." No, he's he's actually
[23:50] um knows he's a good leader. Amen.
[23:53] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you what you've done good
[23:55] first. Let me tell you all your
[23:58] qualities and good traits. And he he
[24:01] begins to tell them of their life
[24:03] continue progress and and that that each
[24:06] day it's better than yesterday. And I
[24:10] think that's a Christian's goal.
[24:13] &gt;&gt; Lord, let me be better than yesterday.
[24:16] &gt;&gt; There there is one one uh church where
[24:19] he says that you've left your first
[24:21] love. That's an issue.
[24:23] &gt;&gt; What What happened? There was a a
[24:25] degrading. There was something going on
[24:27] to where they're worse than they were
[24:29] when they first gave their heart to the
[24:31] Lord.
[24:32] &gt;&gt; You see somebody give their heart to the
[24:33] Lord and their their zeal sometimes they
[24:36] don't know how to aim and they don't
[24:37] know how to say things right and and but
[24:40] their zeal is there.
[24:42] &gt;&gt; Their love for the Lord is there
[24:44] &gt;&gt; and sometimes they say things that that
[24:46] they're not supposed to.
[24:49] I remember when I gave my heart to the
[24:50] Lord, I I was telling people, "Oh, I
[24:52] think you're going to go to hell." I
[24:54] didn't know the word enough
[24:56] &gt;&gt; to say, "Hey, man." Like, there's more
[24:58] of the word than, "Hey, you sin, you go
[25:00] to hell."
[25:02] &gt;&gt; And there's more grace in words that you
[25:04] can say to bring something to Christ,
[25:06] somebody to Christ, and then instead of
[25:09] making them run away, right? Amen.
[25:11] &gt;&gt; So, so, uh, there's that zeal, but these
[25:15] people, it said that that zeal got
[25:17] greater and greater and greater
[25:20] &gt;&gt; and the works that you did yesterday,
[25:22] they're better today.
[25:24] &gt;&gt; That's a beautiful thing.
[25:27] &gt;&gt; Then after all those beautiful things,
[25:29] your their works, their charity, their
[25:32] love, their kindness, their patience, oh
[25:34] man, he made them feel good. But he
[25:36] says, "Notwithstanding.
[25:39] Nevertheless,
[25:42] I have a few things against you."
[25:45] Not that you sinned. He didn't say, "Oh,
[25:47] I have this against you. You sinned that
[25:49] one time. You lied. You stole. You did
[25:53] something horrendous."
[25:55] But he said, "You suffer." Which that
[25:57] word in other translations means you
[25:59] tolerate.
[26:02] You tolerated a person.
[26:06] That's what I have against you.
[26:10] &gt;&gt; You tolerated.
[26:13] Now, now it's like I said, the the
[26:16] Bible, the word, Paul is not telling us
[26:19] to separate ourselves from from the
[26:21] world completely.
[26:23] It says that we have to be in the world,
[26:26] that we have to work, we have to
[26:29] conversate, we have to we we have
[26:31] friends. But here he says you tolerate
[26:34] it.
[26:36] Bible or the word tolerate is to allow
[26:39] to be done without hindrance or
[26:41] contradiction
[26:43] or to put up with. Now I'm not talking
[26:46] about the friend that's at work or or
[26:48] somebody at the grocery store. Sometimes
[26:50] it's within us. Amen.
[26:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:52] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's within our own home.
[26:55] &gt;&gt; Is to to put up with to allow something
[26:59] to fester in when you should break it
[27:02] off right away.
[27:04] &gt;&gt; Break that sin. Break those little
[27:06] things. Even those little conversations,
[27:08] those little thoughts, all those things.
[27:10] You've tolerated those things.
[27:12] &gt;&gt; And people might say, "Oh, no. That's
[27:14] okay. That's all right. You got to be
[27:16] that's what the world wants you to be.
[27:18] You got to tolerate."
[27:19] &gt;&gt; Wow. You you have to comply.
[27:23] You have you have to be like that in
[27:25] order for you to move around the world
[27:28] until one day you wake up and you are
[27:31] it. You become it.
[27:35] &gt;&gt; He said you've tolerated that woman
[27:38] Jezebel.
[27:39] Now the the scripture is is beautiful
[27:43] because um you go back to Kings and you
[27:48] think about Ahab.
[27:50] Think about not only that he tolerated a
[27:53] woman but he married her.
[27:55] &gt;&gt; He adopted her her idols. He adopted her
[27:58] her religion. He adopted all those
[28:00] things that not only uh took his life
[28:04] down but the whole country,
[28:06] &gt;&gt; the whole nation
[28:08] &gt;&gt; was flooded with idols. Why? Because one
[28:10] person accepted not only accepted but
[28:13] was conformed by the very thoughts of
[28:16] that person.
[28:18] &gt;&gt; Honestly, you know, this is just my
[28:21] perspective, my my thought. I I don't
[28:23] think if you you can you can correlate
[28:25] Ahab to this these people because Ahab
[28:28] wasn't a good person.
[28:30] He completely adopted those things. He
[28:32] became it. But there was a good man
[28:35] named Jehoshaphat.
[28:37] And for me reading the scriptures that
[28:39] was was one of the greatest kings of
[28:42] Judah outside of David.
[28:45] He was one of the greatest because he he
[28:47] didn't sin like everybody else. He
[28:50] didn't fall away from the Lord. You know
[28:53] what his sin was? He tolerated.
[28:58] &gt;&gt; He he saw the division of these two two
[29:01] nations and and um he knew it was an
[29:04] issue and and himself thinking, man, I
[29:09] know God wants us to be all together.
[29:12] I know God wants us to be all one. I
[29:15] know God wants us to be like this. So
[29:17] what he tried to do was was become
[29:19] friends with Ahab
[29:21] &gt;&gt; when God didn't want him to.
[29:24] &gt;&gt; God didn't want him to tolerate their
[29:26] sin. God says, "I've already condemned
[29:29] him through the mouth of Elijah."
[29:32] &gt;&gt; They they already had the word spoken to
[29:34] them.
[29:36] &gt;&gt; That's what the world is.
[29:38] &gt;&gt; That's what United States is today.
[29:41] &gt;&gt; Yet we want to say, "Let's save our
[29:43] country.
[29:45] Oh no,
[29:46] &gt;&gt; let's do this. Let's do that. Let's do
[29:48] all these things.
[29:50] &gt;&gt; Uh the word has been spoken.
[29:54] &gt;&gt; The word has been spoken. And that's
[29:56] what makes us different than uh uh
[30:00] American Christian.
[30:03] &gt;&gt; That's what makes us different because
[30:04] we our kingdom is not over here. I'm not
[30:07] going to try to do a patchwork on this
[30:08] world. I'm going to work on this world.
[30:12] &gt;&gt; I'm going to work on this world. If
[30:14] somebody needs saving, I'm going to
[30:16] speak to the soul and not to the nation.
[30:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[30:20] &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus, he came to change the
[30:22] world. How did he do it? To become a
[30:24] king. He said the first doctrine, he
[30:26] said, "You must be born again."
[30:29] &gt;&gt; That was his teaching.
[30:31] &gt;&gt; That's what he wanted was a change of
[30:34] the heart and soul.
[30:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:38] &gt;&gt; Here, Jehoshaphat, he wanted to change
[30:40] the nations. He wanted to do these
[30:41] things. And and and so the Bible says,
[30:44] and I'm not bringing up the scripture.
[30:46] You guys can look it up yourselves, but
[30:47] there's this word. It says that he had
[30:49] an affinity with Ahab. And that was a
[30:53] word that they used as a contract.
[30:57] And the way they would make a contract
[30:59] was they would get he would he got his
[31:01] son, Ahab got his daughter, and they
[31:03] married one another. And that was their
[31:06] contract saying, "Hey, we are partners
[31:09] now.
[31:10] And maybe we think, "Oh, that well
[31:12] that's fine. That's okay." But but God
[31:14] told us not to do that.
[31:17] &gt;&gt; God told us it. He says, "Evil
[31:20] communications corrupt good manners."
[31:23] &gt;&gt; Be not unequally yolked.
[31:27] &gt;&gt; Do not do those things. Doesn't mean you
[31:30] can't go on through those things. It's
[31:32] not because to be mean or to do all
[31:34] those things because there is a
[31:35] detriment
[31:37] not only to you but to things after
[31:41] they did all those things and and you
[31:43] know Micah the prophet he's spoke the
[31:46] word and he says you're going to die
[31:48] here and this is what's going to happen
[31:52] and those things happen and you think oh
[31:56] Jehoshaphat man okay he's done um Ahab
[31:59] died. No, he finds his son. He said,
[32:02] "Oh, let's be friends."
[32:05] Same thing. Elisha goes and they call
[32:07] him. And Elisha told Jehoshaphat, "Man,
[32:10] if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't even
[32:12] look at that person. I wouldn't even be
[32:15] here. But because you as a believer,
[32:17] you've tolerated.
[32:19] &gt;&gt; Now I have to stand here. Now I have to
[32:22] protect you. Now I have to be here."
[32:25] Sometimes we get ourselves in issues
[32:28] because we want to kind of be around the
[32:30] world. Kind of not be but kind of be.
[32:33] &gt;&gt; That's what gets us into issues.
[32:35] &gt;&gt; That's what gets us into problems
[32:38] &gt;&gt; when we find ourselves in places we're
[32:40] not supposed to be in.
[32:42] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm always in my house. Always.
[32:46] &gt;&gt; I'm always there.
[32:48] &gt;&gt; We don't h We don't have to leave our
[32:50] house anymore.
[32:51] I don't have to go to Rome anymore to
[32:53] the epicenter.
[32:56] &gt;&gt; The world is is infiltrating us.
[33:00] &gt;&gt; The world is is trying its best to apply
[33:04] pressure
[33:05] &gt;&gt; toward say well you know what we can
[33:07] somehow tolerate. We can s somehow do
[33:10] those things but God says don't do it.
[33:15] Jehosaphat he didn't stop there. I think
[33:17] he did it like one or two, three more
[33:18] times
[33:20] and he ended up dying and and I remember
[33:22] Joo telling him like, "Man, you're a
[33:25] good guy, but you're getting into
[33:27] trouble being around these people
[33:31] and he ended up dying with that
[33:32] reputation as a good man
[33:36] yet being too close to sin."
[33:39] And people think, "Oh, well, the story
[33:41] ends there." No, his daughter
[33:44] um Athaliah, she ca caused mayhem with
[33:49] his children.
[33:50] Almost killed the whole lineage of Judah
[33:54] except for one.
[33:56] It was his daughter-in-law
[33:59] that married his son.
[34:02] his son died and she killed all of the
[34:05] descendants except for one, trying to
[34:07] destroy Judah
[34:09] because of one little handshake,
[34:13] because of one little decision of let me
[34:15] align myself with a world.
[34:18] It says, I have one thing against you
[34:21] that you tolerate.
[34:24] You know, um that's I I think this is
[34:27] what our pastor would call a prelude,
[34:29] right? Toleration. Wow.
[34:32] &gt;&gt; When when we begin to tolerate when we
[34:35] allow certain things, we begin to put
[34:37] little bit of seeds here and there, then
[34:40] we know what the main symphony is going
[34:42] to be.
[34:44] &gt;&gt; We know what's going to happen if we
[34:46] begin these little tiny things.
[34:49] &gt;&gt; When we think, "Oh, everything is okay."
[34:51] But then one day we look in the mirror
[34:53] and there's a conformity going on. There
[34:55] is a complete change. And then you can
[34:58] tell yourself, "Man, you've changed.
[35:02] Man, something happened."
[35:06] &gt;&gt; If you'd like to turn with me to Psalms
[35:07] 1:1,
[35:15] this is a beautiful scripture. It says,
[35:19] "Blessed is the man."
[35:22] So, I want to know how I can be blessed
[35:25] today.
[35:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:27] He said, "Blessed is the man that
[35:29] walketh not in the counsel of the
[35:31] ungodly, nor standeth in the way of the
[35:33] sinners, nor siteth in the seat of the
[35:36] scornful." Now psalmist is explaining
[35:39] what a man that is blessed,
[35:43] what he is, and he's explaining by
[35:45] negation. So, so he's saying he's
[35:48] blessed because he does not do this,
[35:52] &gt;&gt; right? So, he's saying he's blessed
[35:54] because he doesn't do this and he
[35:56] doesn't do that. And and you know what?
[35:57] That's how many scholars try to figure
[36:00] out who God is actually. That's how the
[36:03] Bible explains who God is because we
[36:05] can't we can't wrap our minds around who
[36:09] God is,
[36:11] &gt;&gt; right? As a human being.
[36:13] &gt;&gt; So, what a a human being can do is they
[36:16] know their environment. They know the
[36:17] world. They know the the ex uh the uh
[36:21] the world and themselves and all of
[36:22] that. So they can say, well, God is not
[36:27] finite,
[36:28] right? So they're explaining that he's
[36:30] infinite by saying, well, he's not like
[36:32] us.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; Well, he's not sinful. He's not like us.
[36:36] So that's how people try to explain who
[36:38] God is by understanding that he's not
[36:41] like this.
[36:43] And this is how the psalmist is saying.
[36:46] He's saying, "Blessed is the man because
[36:48] he is not walking with the uh walketh
[36:52] with the counsel of the ungodly,
[36:54] standeth in the way of the sinners, now
[36:56] siteth in the seat of the scornful."
[36:57] Now, there's a lot of things going on in
[36:59] this little tiny scripture. The
[37:01] scripture, it's talking about the
[37:03] blessed man, and he's talking about how
[37:06] he doesn't walk, he doesn't stand, or he
[37:08] doesn't sit. Not only that, but not he
[37:11] doesn't walk with the counsel, stand
[37:13] with the in the way and sit in the seat.
[37:17] And then you can also break it down of
[37:20] the ungodly, the sinner, and the seat of
[37:23] the scornful. But you can really break
[37:26] that down and see all those things. But
[37:28] I really want to go into walkth standeth
[37:30] and sitting. It's almost a degradation
[37:32] of a person.
[37:35] There's there's a point of walking with
[37:37] a person, standing and then sitting
[37:42] &gt;&gt; and and walking it suggest a movement, a
[37:45] passing engagement
[37:47] &gt;&gt; implying somebody is beginning to listen
[37:49] or or to entertain advice or ideas. What
[37:51] is that? Toleration, right?
[37:54] &gt;&gt; The the um begin to entertain advice,
[37:58] ideas, perspective of the wicked, those
[38:01] who reject God's ways. This is the
[38:05] initial stage, if you want to call it,
[38:07] of toleration where a person may not
[38:10] fully embrace a sinful mindset, but is
[38:12] open to hear and kind of dabble into it.
[38:16] Well, let me hear your perspective.
[38:18] Well, let me see where you're you're at.
[38:20] And and we begin to tolerate those
[38:23] things. We begin to try to understand
[38:26] those things even though word even
[38:28] though the word clearly says it's wrong.
[38:31] Yeah.
[38:33] &gt;&gt; So there's this part of walking. So when
[38:37] God is is
[38:39] correcting thiteria, he's not telling
[38:42] them that they sin. He's saying, "Hey,
[38:44] you're getting into a path that you do
[38:46] not want to go into."
[38:48] &gt;&gt; You're walking, you're tolerating these
[38:50] things. And this toleration is going to
[38:53] get to a place where well Lady Osia
[38:56] ended up right
[38:58] where it was a complete conformity.
[39:01] Now to stand indicates a pause a
[39:05] lingering
[39:07] suggesting a deeper level of engagement.
[39:10] The person is no longer passing through
[39:12] but actively aligning him his his life
[39:15] with that kind of lifestyle. His way of
[39:18] sinners.
[39:19] the way
[39:22] and it's these people who habitually
[39:25] practice sin. This represents a shift of
[39:28] from a a toleration to almost a uh
[39:32] association
[39:34] where the individual begins to adopt or
[39:36] justify sinful behaviors. There's a
[39:39] degradation of a person where he begins
[39:42] to be lured in and lured in and lured
[39:45] in. And here sit implies the state of
[39:50] comfort of permanence.
[39:53] Let me sit here. It's the seat of the
[39:56] scoffers. And if you want to go back, a
[39:58] pastor spoke on the scoffers, the
[40:01] skeptics, the people that always think
[40:04] evil and think wrong of those things.
[40:08] People that openly mock God.
[40:11] This stage a person has fully conformed.
[40:15] A person has fully adopted those sinful
[40:18] behaviors and embracing the mindset of
[40:21] the scoffer, of the sinful, of the the
[40:23] the skeptic, all these people. We've
[40:26] completely embraced those things.
[40:31] But the Bible says, "Blessed is the man
[40:33] that doesn't do those things.
[40:35] &gt;&gt; Blessed is the man that stays away."
[40:39] And and you see this with this whole
[40:41] scripture that this slide from
[40:43] toleration to conformity. And I started
[40:45] to think about Genesis um 3:1,
[40:50] how it starts talking about the the
[40:52] serpent and how he was the most subtle
[40:55] and and um he was most intelligent and
[40:58] all of these things and and how he goes
[41:01] to the woman and he begins to talk to
[41:03] her
[41:05] and and she she tolerates him there.
[41:08] He begins to say, 'Well, um, haven't you
[41:12] eaten of every tree? Haven't you done
[41:14] this one? And and she says, 'Yeah, you
[41:15] can eat of every single one, but don't
[41:17] eat this one. Don't touch it, lest you
[41:19] die.
[41:22] There's her walking with him, tolerating
[41:25] his his his little antics, and then they
[41:29] begin to engage in conversation.
[41:32] Um, Brother Brandham has a really um
[41:34] cool kind of um uh dramatization and
[41:38] conflict between God and Satan where
[41:40] where he says that that Satan would
[41:42] would shoot at his target. Well, God
[41:45] well well, didn't it say this? And she
[41:47] and she would go back and say, "But God
[41:49] said,
[41:51] well, what about this?" But God said,
[41:54] and he just kept walking with her,
[41:57] talking with her. But what about this?
[41:59] What about that? And what about this?
[42:01] And what about that? But God said, but
[42:02] God said, but God said. And there he
[42:05] kept on shooting his darts. Kept on
[42:08] shooting at the target. Kept on and kept
[42:11] on and kept on. And and there you see
[42:13] that sliding from toleration all the way
[42:16] to conformity. that whole accepting what
[42:19] this this serpent was saying
[42:23] &gt;&gt; to the point where where um where
[42:26] finally he says but you know the wisdom
[42:28] of God you know do you want to be wise
[42:31] like God and she said then she stops
[42:35] brother Brandham says don't ever stop
[42:36] for the devil
[42:38] &gt;&gt; he says that in this scripture or in
[42:40] this quote he says don't ever stop for
[42:43] the devil once you stop there you've
[42:45] made your mistake
[42:48] there. She stopped. She got comfortable
[42:50] with the statement. She got comfortable
[42:52] with the situation and she said, "Well,
[42:55] I do kind of want to be like that. I'm
[42:57] not like this and I don't know those
[42:59] things and I don't." And he's like
[43:00] there, he got her there.
[43:04] &gt;&gt; He says, "Don't do that. Don't stop for
[43:06] the devil."
[43:07] &gt;&gt; Right?
[43:08] &gt;&gt; Don't stop even a little bit.
[43:10] And there she she finds herself, her and
[43:13] her husband, in this this total
[43:16] depravity from God. Changed,
[43:21] &gt;&gt; man. They've changed.
[43:23] You can look at them. You can talk to
[43:25] them and say, "Man, Adam, you changed.
[43:28] What happened
[43:30] here?" In Genesis 3:10 and 11, it says
[43:34] he said, um, here God is looking for
[43:36] them. Of course, we know when he says,
[43:38] "Where art thou?" It's not a a thought
[43:40] of not knowing,
[43:43] but it it's deeper than that. And here
[43:48] Adam says, "I heard thy voice in the
[43:50] garden. I was afraid because I was naked
[43:53] and I hid myself."
[43:56] And God, he he asks another question
[43:59] here, not because he doesn't know, but
[44:02] because he's pinpointing something here.
[44:05] He says, he said, "Who told thee thou
[44:08] was naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree
[44:11] where I command thee that thou should
[44:13] not shouldn't uh not eat?"
[44:16] What? What was it? God confronted Adam
[44:20] and Eve.
[44:22] And this question underscores the role
[44:25] of an external influence.
[44:28] Who told you
[44:31] who who told you these things?
[44:34] because of that external influence, that
[44:36] thing that that molded you. Now you have
[44:40] been changed to where I'm naked. I'm I'm
[44:44] scared. And when he began to ask them,
[44:47] they began to, you know, of course,
[44:50] blame each other and do all those
[44:51] things. what they changed.
[44:55] They allowed somebody to come into their
[44:57] life and and and put in an idea to where
[45:01] they completely changed from one thing
[45:04] to another.
[45:06] &gt;&gt; Who told you you changed? Who told you
[45:08] you changed?
[45:10] &gt;&gt; Who told you this idea?
[45:15] The serpent's influence in initiated the
[45:18] degradation,
[45:20] the process of Adam and Eve and and and
[45:23] starting with the tolerance to the
[45:26] association all the way down to the
[45:28] sitting down and conforming
[45:32] shows that this these external
[45:34] influences will change a person.
[45:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:38] &gt;&gt; That we when we go out into the world,
[45:40] we have to understand where we stand.
[45:43] Amen.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; Paul, he knew what and danger these
[45:47] people were in in Rome. And he says, "Do
[45:50] not be conformed.
[45:52] Don't be conformed to the world."
[45:56] Many of us or not maybe not us but maybe
[45:59] many of the world they say we need a
[46:01] change.
[46:03] We need a change in administration. We
[46:06] need a change in this. We need a change
[46:07] in this thing. People can say in
[46:09] Arizona, "Well, we need to change this
[46:11] law. We need to do this. We need a
[46:13] change. Maybe we can say in ourselves, I
[46:15] need a change. We need a change. We need
[46:17] a change.
[46:19] Change from certain things. I need a
[46:21] change from this. I need a change from
[46:23] that. But what are we changing into?
[46:27] &gt;&gt; See, change is is the beginning of a new
[46:30] trajectory.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; So when I leave this, I adopt something
[46:36] else. I start, I begin a new way, a new
[46:41] walk, a new thing.
[46:44] What are we changing?
[46:46] Now, we know what change means, but I I
[46:47] just want to solidify this word. It says
[46:50] to make a a a diff um make something
[46:53] different. to make a a a radical change
[46:58] or something radically different to give
[47:02] a person a position, course or direction
[47:04] to change to change to replace with
[47:09] another
[47:11] to make a shift from one to another. So
[47:14] change isn't I'm going to leave this and
[47:17] then now I'm fine. No, whenever you
[47:19] leave it's a switch. It's an adoption of
[47:21] something else. Yes.
[47:24] &gt;&gt; Change is another
[47:26] life, another way. That's what change
[47:29] is.
[47:31] So when we want to change, what are we
[47:33] changing to?
[47:35] When the world says we need change, we
[47:37] need to change this government. Well, to
[47:39] what? It's going to get worse.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; Every change that this government, that
[47:45] this world, that people have made has
[47:48] become worse. It hasn't gotten better.
[47:51] every change.
[47:54] &gt;&gt; You can't The thought I thought about
[47:56] when I was thinking about this is you
[47:58] can't put away Christ and keep his
[48:01] values.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; If if I put Christ aside and say I need
[48:07] a change in my life,
[48:10] my life, my moral values, my thoughts,
[48:14] my actions, the way I dress, the way I
[48:17] act is all going to change.
[48:20] because all of my life is revolved and
[48:24] shaped in the word of God
[48:28] &gt;&gt; in Christ Jesus. So I I I I get away
[48:31] from a belief and I receive another
[48:33] belief. I change and conformed into that
[48:37] belief.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; I go another way. I change my
[48:39] trajectory.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; Same thing. You can't you can't receive
[48:44] Christ and keep the world's values.
[48:48] So we can't say, "Hey man, I'm saved you
[48:50] and I'm" We see that in the world.
[48:53] People that are saved, people that have
[48:56] accepted Christ, but nothing has changed
[48:58] in their lives.
[49:01] &gt;&gt; When you adopt the belief, you become
[49:06] it.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; You change.
[49:10] Peter, he says in Acts 2:38, we all know
[49:13] it. He says repent.
[49:16] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, he says a really good
[49:18] quote. He says repent means to turn
[49:20] around.
[49:22] &gt;&gt; So whenever we give our heart to the
[49:24] Lord, it's not that we're changing our
[49:27] ideas and we're kind of, you know,
[49:29] adding some ideas about Christ and and
[49:32] seeing how that fits. No, we turn
[49:34] around.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; We drop one thing and we grab another.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; That is change in our lives. He's right,
[49:43] brother.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; He says to turn around. So Romans 12:2,
[49:47] it says, "Be not conformed to this
[49:49] world, but be ye transformed,
[49:53] &gt;&gt; changed, not shaped outwardly like
[49:56] conformity is, but a transformation, a
[49:59] metamorphice,
[50:01] &gt;&gt; like a butterfly, like like something
[50:04] from within. There is a change.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; You're not the same person."
[50:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:10] this this word it's actually metamorphu
[50:13] and it appears four times in the new
[50:15] testament I I think the scarcity of of
[50:19] the word means or gives it its weight
[50:24] it's four times the two times is in the
[50:27] mount transfiguration
[50:29] in Matthew 17:2 and mark 9:2 where it
[50:33] says that he was changed
[50:35] this metamorphu
[50:37] so when the bible says says, "Be ye
[50:40] transformed, be changed." It is a
[50:42] beginning of not only your inward, but
[50:45] you are going to be completely changed
[50:46] one day.
[50:49] &gt;&gt; It is the beginning process. The last
[50:51] scripture is 2 Corinthians 3:18 where we
[50:54] are being transformed to the same image
[50:57] from glory unto glory.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; We are being transformed. There is a
[51:02] beginning of this transformation that is
[51:04] going on. This is not an just adding and
[51:07] taking away ideas. This is a
[51:10] transformation in your life.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; To where this transformation is going to
[51:15] take you to a certain destination,
[51:18] &gt;&gt; a glorified body.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; A rapture in your life.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; That's what's going to happen. There's
[51:26] going to be a rapture in your life. It's
[51:28] not correcting the outward man. Yeah,
[51:31] &gt;&gt; I I long time young part of my my
[51:35] Christian walk, I realized that we do
[51:38] not just as Paul says in Ephesians 6:12,
[51:41] we do not wrestle with flesh and blood.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; We do not correct an outward person. We
[51:49] do not try to change the outward. We do
[51:52] not conform it to what we want it to be.
[51:55] Well, I'm sure we've all seen it. long
[51:58] time. I I I saw somebody say, "Well, uh
[52:01] this sister, you know, this is a long
[52:02] time, so I'm I get to say it, I guess."
[52:04] Um they said, "Oh, she can't, you know,
[52:08] before you sing in the choir, you need
[52:09] longer dresses."
[52:12] Well, the sister, she wasn't living a
[52:14] life.
[52:16] She was dressing because that's the way
[52:18] it was, but she still wanted her style
[52:20] and all these things. She wasn't living
[52:22] a life.
[52:24] So changing changing the skirt size
[52:27] wasn't going to do anything for her.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; I realized that I said, "You know what?
[52:32] This sister doesn't need uh different
[52:35] clothing. She needs a change in her
[52:37] heart."
[52:39] &gt;&gt; She needs something to happen within
[52:41] her.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; I'm sure we've all gone through it. I I
[52:45] man, when I was young, I tried to be a
[52:47] Christian many times because I grew up
[52:49] in it,
[52:51] &gt;&gt; right? I was, "Oh, man. Today's my day.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; Didn't work. Didn't work. Didn't work
[52:57] until I needed the change and I wanted
[53:00] the change.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; And when that change happened, it wasn't
[53:04] an outward change
[53:05] &gt;&gt; cuz I was still dressing the way I
[53:07] wanted and all those things until my
[53:09] life began to catch up with my
[53:11] conviction.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; That is the inward change. Amen.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; I remember well uh Jesus he says in uh
[53:22] Luke 22:31 it says
[53:27] he says and the Lord said to Simon uh
[53:30] Lord said Simon Simon behold Satan hath
[53:33] desired to have you that he may sift you
[53:37] as wheat shake you up.
[53:40] Who's been shooken up before?
[53:43] He He desires to shake you up, to get
[53:46] you off your course.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; He's But I prayed for thee.
[53:51] That thy faith fail not, and when thou
[53:55] art converted, strengthen your brethren.
[53:59] So he he he's given an a distinction
[54:03] here. He says, you're not completely
[54:07] what I want you to be yet. He was
[54:10] walking with the Lord for three and a
[54:11] half years.
[54:13] yet you're not converted yet. You're not
[54:15] changed yet.
[54:17] How many times have was I sitting in the
[54:19] pew before I was changed? How many years
[54:22] &gt;&gt; I could be with the with the, you know,
[54:26] singing songs and all of that, but yet
[54:28] desires, the influences of the world are
[54:31] still around.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; I I'm I'm still getting pulled and I'm
[54:35] still getting tempted. But what God
[54:37] wants you to do is be converted. That
[54:40] word is to return to turn around.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; So he wants you to change from one
[54:47] trajectory to another. And then whenever
[54:50] you are changed now do what you need to
[54:54] do. Now live your life. Now do
[54:58] everything that I ask you to do.
[55:02] As I said, Jesus's first doctrine was
[55:07] you must be born again.
[55:10] Jesus wanted to change the world one
[55:12] soul, one heart at a time.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; And he successfully did it. He got what
[55:18] he needed. He has his bride.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; How? By doing traditions and all those
[55:27] things. No, by changing the heart
[55:30] &gt;&gt; into being conformed or transformed into
[55:34] the word.
[55:36] I think that's the best thing. I I think
[55:38] Christianity, if you guys would like to
[55:39] stand and the musicians come. I I I
[55:42] truly believe that Christianity is a
[55:45] transformation.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; Salvation is a transformation.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; It's not just an accepting beliefs and
[55:54] and see how it goes and but when you
[55:57] become a Christian, you are transformed.
[56:00] Amen.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; The Bible says let um it says let let
[56:04] the old man go
[56:06] &gt;&gt; and get the new man.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; Doesn't say man you're going to fight
[56:09] with him and and sometimes the new man's
[56:11] going to be there then the old man. No,
[56:13] it says let him go.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; Also there's a scripture where it says
[56:17] die.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; So what is it? A dying to the old person
[56:23] &gt;&gt; and becoming a new creature.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; That is Christianity. That is change.
[56:30] That's what every Christian goes
[56:33] through.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; And then when the world is out there,
[56:37] when when all these things are against
[56:39] you, you can say, "I am not going to
[56:41] conform to the world."
[56:43] &gt;&gt; And there's this constant transformation
[56:46] by the renewing of your mind through the
[56:49] Holy Spirit. That's my desire.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; And Lord, keep me in your word.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; Give me a desire for your word. That
[56:58] should be our prayer.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; Our prayer is Lord, give me a desire to
[57:02] look into this.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; Give me open the door. Lord, I know when
[57:07] I first gave my heart to the Lord, man,
[57:09] the these, the thous, they're still
[57:11] messing me up sometimes, but it's
[57:13] sometimes hard to understand.
[57:16] Lord, give me understanding.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; Let me hear the messages. Let me hear
[57:20] our our pastor. Let me hear and give me
[57:23] understanding and and a thirst for your
[57:25] word, Lord,
[57:26] &gt;&gt; that I may search these things and I can
[57:29] be completely renewed and transformed
[57:32] to the very image.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father,
[57:38] Lord, that's our desire. Father,
[57:41] the world is trying so hard to change
[57:45] these things. Father, try so hard to to
[57:50] manipulate things in our lives and do
[57:52] all these things and and and and there's
[57:55] a showdown coming
[57:57] whether it's going to be in our lifetime
[57:59] or not. Father, we know that Lord, we
[58:01] are going to meet you one way or
[58:02] another.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; Whether it's through the rapture,
[58:05] through the grave, Father, we will see
[58:07] you again.
[58:09] Father, let our life be solidified, set,
[58:13] founded in you, Father,
[58:15] so that whenever any wind of doctrine,
[58:18] any movement, any cultural change,
[58:21] anything that happens, Lord, we can
[58:23] stand on your word, Father.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; Help your people. Strengthen them,
[58:27] Father.
[58:29] Get them more in love in you before of
[58:31] you, Father.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; We give you the honor and the glory. In
[58:34] the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen
[58:37] and amen. Bless you. God bless
