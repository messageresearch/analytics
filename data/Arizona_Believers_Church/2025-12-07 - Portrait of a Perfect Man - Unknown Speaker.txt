TRANSCRIPT
========================================
My my title is portrait of a perfect man. And I'm realizing now that in my in looking at this I may not even get to the scripture in Ephesians. So let me just uh just read it very quickly but it says in Ephesians chapter 4 and that might be on my last slide there if you want to get to it but it's a portrait of a perfect man before we move. This is a painting by Karavajio and it's the uh road to Emmas. It's when he was called aside and was at in with the disciples and was speaking at the table. I really like the the style of Cardavagio, but he's there uh speaking. It's when did our hearts not burn within us when he spoke to us along the way? And this is when he broke bread and revealed himself. And I love the the arts that are able to portray um a scene where we can begin to think this was a very real thing that happened. Christ sat down with his disciples on the road to Emmas and he sat down and broke bread. And it was in the breaking of bread, something common, something that he had done before wherein he made himself known to his disciples. And I wanted to use this just as a an expression of this portrait of a perfect man because we might think of a perfect man as having a halo uh and maybe not looking very human. But this may be perhaps except for maybe the boyish face as the Cardagio used for the model. Uh it was a very real thing. would have looked like any other human being sitting and eating and breaking bread that day. But I'm looking at the portrait of a perfect man. This as we go forward in the next few services, I have a lot on my plate that the the portrait of divinity, the portrait of humanity, and how these things can be viewed separately, but yet they're combined in this perfect one, Christ. But it says in Ephesians 4:13, "Till we all come into the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. He is the measure of a perfect man. Christ is the perfect man." There is the stature of a perfect man then that God is wanting to bring forth in us. And in Ephesians 4, it's saying that God has given gifts. these gifted men to be able to bring us to this image, this measure, and the stature of a perfect man. So, I'm looking at the portrait of a perfect man. And in particular, how I've been approaching is the image of Jesus Christ as portrayed by scripture. because we have not seen him. Nor should we just assume that the picture that Cardagio painted is what Jesus looked like or what that scene looked like because he's just painting what he the impression maybe even though it's a different period. It's not impressionism. But then that Baroque period he's painting it in a style as he has interpreted or it's been inspired to him from the story of the road to Emmas. And so the portrait or a portrait of a perfect man is painted in the scripture that that's the art that's going to convey to us who Jesus Christ was. In the book by Frank Bristol is 1897. I know you've all probably read it a couple times, listened to the audio book, but it's called the ministry of art. Makes a lot of tremendous statements in this book. It's a a very fascinating read in terms of the time period that it comes. This is before multimedia and picture shows and and all these different advancements. And he was looking at how art how used it how religion has used art. &gt;&gt; And it says art has glorified Christianity. It has set forth her doctrines portrayed her saints and even her very God and savior. He makes the phrase that it's been a teacher of divine things. So that's what art does. It it has been something that's conveyed to us Christ. It has portrayed instances in the scripture of whether it be uh parables or actually uh events in the lives of the saints. It is we have art has taken uh the truth and put it in pictures just as that road to scene that supper there portrayed. And because of that I'd like to begin to look at it this way. I'm just going to uh try to take my time today. Not be lengthy, but just slow down because whatever I don't get to today, I'll have ample opportunity to get to uh this afternoon or whatever I get don't get to this morning, I have ample opportunity to get to in a future service. But art has tremendous power to influence our understanding. &gt;&gt; So that when we when we look at art and sometimes this happens just with songs, there's things that we sing or things that we believe and like where is that scripture in the Bible? and we go to try to find it and it's not a scripture in the Bible. It's it's you know Tidwell wrote that, right? And like oh so maybe we don't speed up and they slow down but and it it's not in the Bible but it's just something that someone had taken from the word of God and use some artistic license uh to paint a picture or to use a phrase. And so sometimes we hold beliefs because of how art has informed us, &gt;&gt; his power to influence our understanding and therefore it has power to influence our faith or our belief. And therefore it has been concluded and I believe I'm not saying this in any way that would be a a surprise but art has been able to shape culture &gt;&gt; that if and this is how even uh representations of gods and things portrayed and and that's even how Greek mythology it was more pervasive than just being an oral story but they actually used images and they painted these pictures or told these stories in a way that it impacts belief. Right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And so this the the moral and visual power of art embeds itself in our minds. And I want to make a I'm wanting to make a a a very important spiritual point by these things because they have found that art the visual art sometimes embed itself or influence us more powerfully than the written or spoken language. that that image, the scene of it, uh, puts something in our minds and that's how the way we imagine it that it is. I want to show you a picture. This is Warner Salman's head of Christ. I think you've probably seen this one before. Did I put that in there, Brother Mitch? Okay, good. Yeah, I I I changed my SL I taken a whole bunch of slides out. I was like, I'm going to do this another time, then I put it all back in. But who's seen this picture before? &gt;&gt; This is a very very famous called the head of Christ. painted in 1940. It's a gentle uh Jesus with blue eyes turned heavenward with dark blonde hair. And all of us uh wasp, white, white Anglo-Saxon Protestants say that's what Jesus looks like, of course. But it this picture is the most reproduced religious work of art. It has been printed reproduced over a billion times. The statistic I found was from 15 18 years ago or so and it had been printed over a billion times then. It is as New York Times said the best known American artist and the best known American piece of art of the 20th century. Even though we might not know who the artist is, this is one of the most recognizable symbols. The artist himself said in painting this picture that he wanted to create a very familiar fe similar feeling to an image of a school or professional photo. This is the uh uh what do I what do I always call it? Um where is it we went David to go get our pictures? Olan Mills. That's what I always joke about Olan Mills. And not to trigger everyone about family picture time, but this is creating that head shot, this image of a school or professional photo of the time, the 1940s in making it more accessible and familiar to the audience. Now, what strikes me is that sounds a lot like modern day Christianity. We want to make the word of God more familiar. You know, let's preach a whole series on Christ in Tron, right? or we're going to be doing a series next year on the return of the king and we're going to use it through Tolken and we're going to tell the story of the second coming by using hobbits and so there's a way that people want to make the gospel more accessible or familiar to the audience and this is what he is saying he's trying to do but what happened IS IT CROWDED OUT ALL OTHER depictions of Jesus &gt;&gt; so that for many people in this 20th century 21st century that when they thought of Jesus Christ he was a white man &gt;&gt; and that's how they this is how they pictured Christ being when in fact the earliest images they have of Jesus uh often painted him with dark skin. Sometimes he appeared to be more African than Caucasian. And there's a there's a way that Christ now shifted from being actually a Jew who would have had different tone of skin, a different color of hair, a different look than what we pictured to be a white a white man, Caucasian, somewhere very similar. Like that guy can relate to me, right? I can relate to that guy except for maybe the hair. Uh but he's got a little bit more of some receding hairline there. I appreciate that. A little bit of nod to uh the plight of the white man. And so, but there's something relatable and there's vast literature on how much this impacted African-American Christians because it so embedded itself in their minds to believe that Jesus Christ was in fact a a Caucasian. This is how he appeared. Now you begin to combine that with the atrocities and the horrors that white men have perpetuated on the Indians, right? The white man, he's the renegade. And how the church in the image of of Western European had had gone on crusades and told people of other races and colors and tongues that either accept our religion or you die. Right? &gt;&gt; And so there is an association then of well if if this is Jesus is this really what I want. &gt;&gt; But I say it so that you can begin to think about how art influences belief. But not only is art used to influence belief, but art also is used to reflect belief. Just as much as it has power to shape cultural values, it can instead be used to mirror cultural values. where one would paint a picture or tell stories and they're they're not trying to change or shape culture to make it differently, but they're doing it to reinforce it. But Travis, that's how storytelling would work in certain cultures is you're trying to reinforce what you believe, not change morality or change a particular image. You're wanting to preserve it. And so you do it through art. And so art then in that case is supposed to reflect uh uh uh reflect something that is very real. So let me say it this way as we try to go a little bit further in this. A true portrait of Christ must mirror truth, &gt;&gt; must reflect reality, not try to change it. &gt;&gt; Where none of us would necessarily need to engage in some sort of balancing of the scales to try to produce a a Jesus that was is so vastly different ethnically to where he looks different than the white Jesus. came across some stunning portraits where Jesus is painted as a Mouy warrior and and I'm not necessarily put off by it with all the tattoos and the adornments, but I appreciated the fact that someone's trying to CONVEY WHAT CHRIST WOULD have looked like HAD HE COME AS A Maly &gt;&gt; because Jesus Christ came born of a of a woman. We know he born of virgin birth, but he was born AND HE WAS RAISED BY Jewish parents, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He would have not looked foreign. and he would have looked like any OTHER UH SON OF JOSEPH PERHAPS. &gt;&gt; And so there's a way that we in order we don't try to uh do some sort of reparations by presenting a gospel that balances out what's been perverted but rather we just want the truth of it. &gt;&gt; Sometimes I think today we become more uh reactive in terms of our beliefs or reactive in terms of Christianity. uh there's this ground swell of opposition against a move a particular way. And so since all these things are being promoted and all these things are being put up uh in images and certain things are being lauded then there's a response to that to kick against it and try to paint a picture of Christ that opposes that and in doing so goes too far this way. So then what's the next swing to try to paint a picture of Christ that goes the other way. So now you have a transgender Jesus &gt;&gt; who's welcoming, who's open, who understands and can relate and because they're trying to push back against maybe the hate that created a false Jesus. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; But a portrait of Christ must present the reality of Christ. &gt;&gt; So now John 5:37, we're making excellent time. We will be super early to the youth dinner. I haven't even got to my first scripture. It says, "In the father," John 5:37, "and the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me." Think of this phrase, "You have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his shape." If I could say it this way, God cannot be seen by natural senses. &gt;&gt; Now, when we look at nature, we God makes himself known or is making himself known as the Bible says. All the visible things around us declare the handiwork of God. But yet when you've seen a tree, you have not seen God because therefore because we do not worship the tree. We do not worship the sun. Though there have been many cultures that have been impressed by the greatness of these elements, but yet they have replaced them as God himself. But God cannot be seen by natural uh senses. Therefore, God cannot be painted. &gt;&gt; You're listening to this? God cannot be painted. He can't be seen with the eye. Therefore, he cannot be painted. In Exodus 30 33:20, he said to Moses, "Thou cannot cannot see my face, for there shall no man see me and live." There's God in his beginning in his original form was alone with nothing else. We understand darkness as the absence of light. There we understand things by contrast. There was nothing to contrast God or give him any existence. We exist within time and space. And then we begin to articulate our existence within that by using language. But none of those things pertain to God whatsoever. He just was. I am the I am. And this God uh could not be seen. He says you cannot see my face. There's he he's saying there's something about even uh uh uh me that you cannot see, but I he creates a scenario where Moses is going to see his backside. So he's going to place himself in a form where his effect or his image can be seen but yet not his face just something that God has done. John chapter 14 6 to9 or 7 to9 if we'll just start there he says if you had known me you should have known my father also and from henceforth you know him and have seen him. So now we have this shift where God who could not be looked at in his face or you die. And then David in Psalms 27 you said seek my face your face will I seek. So, one thing have I desired is to behold that face. &gt;&gt; If anything, we could say that God was saying, "Seek the Messiah." And David said, "I want to behold the Messiah." Because now the Messiah is saying, "You have not seen God at any time. You've not known him." But you now have known him and see him. Why? Because there he stood in this representation, in this form, God in flesh, the word made flesh, and his son Jesus Christ. Philip really picking up on it says, "Lord, show us the Father and it will suffice us." There was this true understanding then that what Christ was impressing upon them was this reality of being able to see God. &gt;&gt; A Jew perhaps would not have said, "Let me look into the face of God unless they had an unal alive wish." But here he's saying, "Then let me see." And Jesus said, "Have I been so long with you? Have perhaps my human traits uh have I become so common that the supernatural God that's being revealed to my flesh, it has not impressed itself on you? Have I been so long with you that you have and yet hast thou not known me? Have I become familiar to you? Do you have you not seen what's being expressed, Philillip? He that hath seen me hath seen the father. And how sayest thou then show us the father? I know there's somewhat of a paradox. I think some of these paradoxes can be resolved in scripture and some of them will be resolved perhaps ultimately in that place of perfect understanding beyond this life. But Jesus is saying I when you've seen me, you have seen God. &gt;&gt; And and yet the principle and the truth remains that God in his original form cannot be seen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, if I could put IT THIS WAY, GOD CANNOT be painted, but his manifestation can be painted. &gt;&gt; How can God be described? &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; HE'S WITHOUT END. &gt;&gt; HE FILLS ALL TIME AND SPACE. &gt;&gt; If we with ink the ocean fill uh a and every man ascribed by trade and EVERY STOCK ON EARTH AQUILL. THE WRITER SAID, "TO WRITE THE LOVE OF GOD ABOVE WOULD DRAIN THE OCEAN DRY." WHY IS IT that you could not write the love of God? Because God is love. There is he he cannot be described but when love is manifested &gt;&gt; when God is manifested &gt;&gt; that can be painted. &gt;&gt; The ways that he allows himself to be made known that can be described in Psalms 103:7. He made known his ways unto Moses. And what did Moses do? He wrote them down. &gt;&gt; He took an image of what he saw in heaven and he built a tabernacle on earth. As God manifested himself, Moses could write his acts unto the children of Israel. What happened? The prophets could describe the prophets could transcribe. &gt;&gt; None of them having seen God face to face could yet still describe the mighty works of God because he makes known when God makes himself known. Now you can you can write that you can describe that. Now, Matthewap 11:2, this was our text. And if you could um just stay very focused and if if my if my congestion is a little bit annoying, just look past that. Um if if it's cold, if it's hot, if you're uncomfortable, if you've got a crockpot that you started too early today, just forget about all that. Really important to focus because the point I've just made is the point I'm making, but I think it needs to be really emphasized because we want to know God. &gt;&gt; We want to know him. We want to know him as he is. And we want to we want to accurately portray him &gt;&gt; in Matthew chap 11 verse 25 and we'll read to verse 26 but then we'll keep going all the way to verse 30 I believe eventually we'll read to verse 27 and here it says in that time Jesus answered and said I thank thee oh father lord of heaven and earth because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and hast revealed them unto babes even so father for it seemed good in thy sight. Now, if you were to back up and start with the beginning of this chapter when he is questioned by um or John's questions for Jesus and they're presented to Jesus, what Jesus says that you have hid these things and revealed these things, he's speaking of the Messiah, which Christ was, &gt;&gt; and the forerunner, which John was, &gt;&gt; and the works that that Messiah was doing. So he says, "You've hid these things, the Messiah, his forerunner, and the works that the Messiah did." Maybe we could describe it this way. You've hid the truth of who the forerunner was and the truth of who the Messiah was and the works that he's doing, but you have not only hid them from one class of people, but you revealed them unto another, babes. So it speaks of some sort of different kind of quickening, even a newness who are then able to learn to be taught. That's so you can't teach an old dog new tricks. That's kind of the idea here. I would say putting that in modern language, but that's probably not modern anymore. I don't know what would be a modern way of saying that. Uh I'm not even going to try. You can't six seven a skip-doo or whatever it is, right? Is it does that help? AND THEREFORE YOU THERE'S something to be said about when one is set in their ways, there is a an inability to learn or an unwillingness to learn. But he's saying you've revealed this to those who are willing to learn &gt;&gt; and who need to learn. Now God then is either hidden [clears throat] and I would say both. He's either hidden or revealed through the ways that he manifest himself. So that the manifestation you've hid these things from the wise and prudent. So God manifests himself and the wise and prudent are saying that cannot be God. But then there's this babe over there that sees him in the very same thing. So he reveals himself or hides himself in the very simple ways that he manifests himself. God's power is made known. His glory is made known. His glory is expressed. His power is expressed. And sometimes it's in the most mundane things. Sometimes it's in the most difficult things you have to go through, but God reveals himself in that. Fellowshipping with some families and some people even as of late who've gone through some very difficult things, but then they're able to look at what God did just uh months before THEM LIKE, "WOW, THAT'S GOD." &gt;&gt; But then somebody else could look at that and say, "Well, THEN WHY DID GOD LET THIS HAPPEN IF he knew this was going to happen?" And God has done something and in it he reveals himself. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So God makes himself known to those he's ordained to see him &gt;&gt; because he doesn't just say, "Well, it's kind of indiscriminate. It just kind of happens." He says, "As it seemed good in his sight, &gt;&gt; as it pleased you, as what your will was." And and I believe we have to accept this as Christians as hard as it may be. But God chooses some &gt;&gt; and there's others who are not chosen. &gt;&gt; We say, "Well, God by fornowledge does that." We can accept that. There's ways that we try to begin to understand exactly why God would love uh Jacob but hate Esau. &gt;&gt; A and but so we see then that God by his fornowledge, by his omniscience, by his power has chosen some but others are condemned who are forained the Bible says to condemnation, good in thy sight, elect according to the will of God. So God, you've hid some things from some people, but in in the manifestation, but the same thing that these things, the manifestation of the Messiah, the forerunner of the works, the acts, and all these things that work together, you've revealed them to others. So Jesus says, "All things, verse 27, are delivered unto me of my father, and no man knoweth the son." These these these phrases here to me are outstanding. No man knows the son but the father. So let's now we have two two entities. You have Jesus Christ, the son, and you have God. And nobody knows Jesus Christ but God. &gt;&gt; Then he says, "And no man knows the father but the son." &gt;&gt; So no man knows God but the son. So there's two entities that are only known to each other in nobody else knows him. So neither knoweth any man the father save the son. And he to whomsoever the son will reveal him. When you have seen me, you've seen the father. When you have known the son, you now know the father. You know God. Now this is not in a Pentecostal oneness representation of the godhead. Nor is this three gods. &gt;&gt; But this is the son Jesus Christ who reveals him. Only God fully knows the son. Only the son fully knows the father. I say that because creation itself declares that there is a god. The son was standing there. People say, "Oh, Jesus. Jesus and Nazareth. I know him. The son of Mary. Yes, I know him. But what he's saying is in terms of seeing him who he is, knowing this knowing and recognizing, he's saying God only knows the son and only the son knows the father. But then that God, the father can only be known through the son. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ alone, the son of God reveals God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Th this is where we see the beauty of the prophecy of the Old Testament where God in measure is handed out and we can see God in David. We can see God in the prophets. We can see God in Elijah. There's ways that we see these glimpses of God. But the foreshadowing of the Old Testament is that one day God would come in flesh and in him &gt;&gt; was the seed of Genesis 3:15. And in him is the seed of Abraham, not Isaac. and that in him all nations of the earth would be blessed because now he becomes the expression of God in the only way to be saved and the only path of redemption. &gt;&gt; So Jesus Christ alone reveals God. Yes. &gt;&gt; In second Corinthians chapter 4:4. And whom the god of this world and think of this beautiful uh symmetry of this layering. The god of this world, Satan has blinded the minds. Remember this. Maybe just put a little star and uh start a timer because we're going to come back to this. Says has blinded the minds of them which believe not. God hath hid these things from the wise and prudent. So there's a group that's blinded. Blinded the minds of them which believe not. lest the light. Think of all these things we've been ministering on this aspect of light of the glorious gospel of Christ who is the image of God should shine unto them. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; God is revealed in the face of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's his brilliance. &gt;&gt; That's his light. That's who he is. It's his glory. It's his beauty. And then when someone looks into that face and doesn't see God, it's because their minds are blinded &gt;&gt; because Christ is the image of God. In Colossians chapter 1 12 uh we'll go to verse 15. Given thanks unto the father which hath made us meat and made us worthy or uh heirs appropriate made us meat to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have redemption through his blood. Whereas it says in 2 Corinthians 4, in whom the God of this world has blinded them from Christ, who is the image of God. Now in Christ, in whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins. Who is this? His son Jesus Christ. Verse 15, who is the image of the invisible God. &gt;&gt; This is why no man has seen God at any time. God is in his essence essentially invisible. &gt;&gt; Until he makes himself known in some way that our senses can acknowledge him or our spiritual senses can see him. &gt;&gt; I'm kind of getting ahead of myself a little bit there, but he is in the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature. If I could uh place it in these terms, the image and likeness of God. I I'm working on a youth sermon and it has to be in the United States on NIL name, image, and likeness. And and and that's all the rage in college sports anymore. And it's just a cheap knockoff of how that Jesus Christ is in the name, image, and likeness of God. And we all want to participate in that deal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But Christ who is in the image of God came in his father's name. in the likeness of God. It was this image and likeness of God is depicted by Jesus Christ. We have not seen God. But now here is one who is representing him. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; THAT HIS JOB as he said was to declare the father. It's not just to SAY JES OR GOD GOD FATHER BUT ACTUALLY TO UNFOLD AS a narrative. In other words, Jesus's life can be prod seen as a one-man drama &gt;&gt; a as a a LIFE OF TELLING A STORY that presents the heart of God. &gt;&gt; And it is I'm moving very I want to say uh in a linear way today that we're moving we're kind of moving along this path and as he lived this maybe I could just take a step back. God cannot be seen, but his works and manifestations manifestations were. But now when he sends the Messiah, he is saying, "Now you see me. &gt;&gt; I've made known myself through prophets. I've made known myself through prophecy. I've I I've caused HELL TO FALL OUT OF THE sky that destroyed an army. I've I've caused the dead to be raised. I I've declared myself to be the one true God. I've identified myself with Israel. But now I'm in my son. &gt;&gt; And my son is now on earth in flesh. And not just to redeem and vindicate what Jews believed, but to be revealed to all flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To be a savior of the world. &gt;&gt; And now that Christ is on earth living and the disciples are witnesses to it. Therefore, this image was witnessed by the disciples. Luke 1:es 1:4. For as much as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which were most likely surely believed among us. Now we know why the Declaration of Independence is written this way. Those men read the Bible. &gt;&gt; They're sounding much like Luke does here when he says it as much as taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us. These truths we believe to be self-evident &gt;&gt; even as they delivered them unto us which from the beginning were eyewitnesses. Is he saying that we're going to make a declaration of those things which are believed that the things that we believe are to be true. Those things which were delivered by those who witnessed Christ and were ministers of Christ. If I could put it in those terms, eyewitnesses and ministers of the word. It seemed good to me also knowing that there have been other witnesses who've seen it and then portrayed it through verse through writing seemed good to me also having a having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first. Now he's not saying perfect understanding of all things since in the beginning God but from the beginning of the ministry of Jesus Christ to write unto thee in order that thou mightest know. So he says that the most excellent Theophilles, I think someone should name their son most excellent Theophilus Sanchez. Most excellent Theophilles. And he says um that thou mightest know the certainty of those things which thou hast been instructed wherein thou hast been instructed. So there's teachings of Jesus Christ. We are eyewitnesses of his majesty. Peter said, "We've written these things. We've told you these things. WE CANNOT TAKE YOU BACK to see him and witness these events. We cannot we it's not video recorded to where now you would watch it and you would see Jesus multiply bread and fish. We saw it with our own eyes. So now we become the vessel, the artist that's trying to paint this picture accurately of what he did. &gt;&gt; To me, it's amazing that we've come to a place now where we cannot even rely upon &gt;&gt; hope I'm not getting ahead of myself. what we see and what we hear because now all of us always say that's AI. &gt;&gt; Hey &gt;&gt; son, did I just see you do that and when you were told not to do it? AI daddy wouldn't me. And there's so many ways now that people are manipulating understanding and perception anymore. You think you've watched the news, you haven't watched the news. &gt;&gt; It's fake. &gt;&gt; Trump was a prophet. Fake news, right? And now it is literally fake news. Trump was not a prophet. Uh just make that clear. Not in my opinion. But there was a represent Christ is living this out. And now as it was witnessed by the disciples, they had to somehow convey what they saw because we do not have the benefit of being able to go back and see it ourselves. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; So if I could say this and try to do so in a way that kind of summarizes this thought is the portrait of Christ is the impression for us. The portrait of Christ is in part the impression inspired by the four gospels. How else would we know him? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; How else do we know what he said except through the four gospels? How else do we know how he lived what he taught &gt;&gt; except through the word of God? &gt;&gt; So there is a picture painted by the gospels that become this impression upon us. Now let's look at our text again and we'll start with verse 25 and we'll read all the way to verse 30 here. And I think this is a good spot just to recapture this. And at that time Jesus answered and said, "I thank thee, oh Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid this manifestation, these things from the wise and prudent, and have revealed what this manifestation is, the truth of it, the reality of it, unto babes. Even so, Father, for it seemed good in thy sight. It's his will. All things are delivered unto me of my father. And no man knoweth the Son, but the Father, and no man knoweth any man knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and the Son." Now he the individual to whomsoever the son will reveal him. So no man knows these two. But if the son will reveal himself to the individual then the individual will know God. &gt;&gt; That's what Jesus is saying here &gt;&gt; that to whomsoever receives this revelation he will know God. Then immediately this is what he says. Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest. And and and I I I'm going to my intention is to uh try to stop right about where we were right at about an hour when we started. If I think we started at 11:00. Nobody got that joke. I might just might as well just stop now. When you all don't get my jokes, I'm toast. I'm just toast. Have no future whatsoever. Uh we started about about 10:40 and so I I don't want to be much longer than where we are right now. Uh uh much longer now because I I don't want to go very long. Catch this. Christ is saying that when you've seen me, you've seen the father. I become the means by which you will know God. &gt;&gt; Think about everything we know about God. &gt;&gt; And he says, "Come unto me all you that labor and are heavy laden." Now, we we like that thought because we're thinking, "Yes, God, this great God, he'll bear my burdens. He'll he's powerful. He will deliver me of my enemies, and I will give you rest." Verse 29, "Take my yoke upon you and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart." &gt;&gt; All right, hold on here. I thought we were going to be gods, right? Vengeance is mine, saith the next Lord, me, right? Hey, I thought I was going to be I was going to be godly and godlike and I'm going to know God and he's going to be like Zeus or Jupiter. But then Jesus says, "Learn of me." This is on the heels of him saying, "NO MAN KNOWS GOD EXCEPT THE SON who will reveal him." And Jesus is saying, "Learn of me. Learn from me. Take my yoke and learn. I am meek and lowly in heart." &gt;&gt; So let's just say this immediately. I think what we could all accept is that unless we come with some sort of meekness and humility, we will never know and never be taught and know God. &gt;&gt; But a and I'd like to also add to that is God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; IN THE PORTRAIT OF GOD, there is this meekness and loneliness of heart. He says, "And you shall find rest UNTO YOUR SOULS." HE SAYS, "FOR my yoke is easy, easy, and my burden is light." We think all this unbburdening, this unyoking in Christ. Well, we are unbburdened from sin. We are unyoked from death. There's this unyoking that does take place. BUT JESUS CHRIST HIGHLIGHTS THE CHARACTERISTICS of God or these certain manifestations of God. Characteristics, I'd say, of submission, meekness and humility. Submission to the yoke, this meekness and humility, loneliness of heart. And he's saying this, when to know God, you have to know him through the son. So learn of me, take a yoke. But if I could say this, when he says, "Take my yoke," it's an invitation to be joined with Christ in his burden. When he says, "Take my yoke," Christ is not taking off his yoke and placing it on you, but he's implying, "Let's join together." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My burden, my calling, my work. 2 Corinthians chapter 6 verse14 but be ye not unequally yolked together with unbelievers. So he's saying this to believers and he's saying do not join yourself to one another for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness. So think of this joining to take Christ's yoke is to be equally joined with Christ so that you can have fellowship with him and who he is and communion with the light. So it is in that equal joining together that there's going to be this learning and this understanding of the God and the father. So it says be not unequally yolked teaches us that there's this agreement in common labor. When it says be une do not be un uh unequally yolked. He's saying do not be yolked with unbelievers because that would be inequality in burden &gt;&gt; inequality in purpose and calling. Now I want to make this central to where to the the thought today is his yoke. Take my yoke upon you. His yoke was to manifest the father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was his burden. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is why Jesus says, "I do nothing except that the father tells me to do. I say nothing but what the father tells me to say." because he had a burden and a calling to accurately portray God. How would it what would it what would have happened if Jesus just to expedite difficult situations and they bring a woman who CAUGHT COMMITTED ADULTERY BEFORE him and says well what are you going to do about he says adultery who cares anymore that would have that would have represented the heart of God &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; we could then take this whole body of work or take this example from Christ and say adultery doesn't matter why are we making a deal out of it. &gt;&gt; BUT JESUS COULDN'T DO THAT. &gt;&gt; There had to be a particular way THAT HE RESPONDS THAT DECLARES GOD'S ATTITUDE TOWARDS SIN. &gt;&gt; That keeps in IT KEEPS WHOLE THOSE THINGS THAT ARE ABOMINABLE TO GOD. THOSE THINGS THAT GOD DOES NOT LOVE THAT God is not pleased with. He could not though man is confused and there's certain paradoxes and no doubt there all the manifestations of God are not so pristine and perfect to where the picture remains clear for everyone to see. He had a responsibility to in reality portray God. &gt;&gt; Therefore, he was a living picture of the father. He was living God. &gt;&gt; The living word. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is the living word &gt;&gt; that makes God present. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That is why a Jesus could say before Abraham was, I am. &gt;&gt; That is why Paul could say, "Have I not met Jesus Christ our Lord?" &gt;&gt; When Jesus of Nazareth wasn't before Abraham, nor did Paul have the privilege of meeting Jesus of Nazareth on earth. But it was by the revelation of Jesus Christ, which is the word that makes God present, that God was known. &gt;&gt; Amen. And now he says to you, and this is where the transition comes, and hopefully in the next couple services we can address this in great detail or to some detail. Now he invites the elect of God to join in the calling to portray the attributes of God. &gt;&gt; Take my yoke. &gt;&gt; Take my yoke upon you. This means that there is some communion and fellowship that we have to have with Christ and we have to be joined in this calling to be a portrait of a perfect man. &gt;&gt; Now, I don't like that because you may THINK A LOT OF BAD THINGS ABOUT ME, but one of them is not that I think I'm perfect. There is a calling though for you to portray Christ. And in portraying Christ, you portray the father. &gt;&gt; In Galatians chapter 1, I have verses 11 to 17. We'll see just how how far we can get in this. I the timing is is going much quicker than I thought, but we only we have just a short period here, but let's just focus on this now together. I hope that we're being able to kind of follow along in this being very deliberate. Verse 11, Galatians 1:1. But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel, if the gospel be hid, what is the gospel? Jesus Christ. What does he reveal? The father that the gospel which was preached of me, Jesus, Paul said, I preach no other gospel but Christ. this gospel which was preached of me is not after man. What he means by after man, it doesn't mean postman uh or that it would be before man, but that in other words, I have not learned this from man. &gt;&gt; To say he received it of man as he says in verse 12, for neither for I neither received it of man neither was I taught it that means he's saying that I have was not did not learn Christ by observing flesh. I did not know co Christ by uh learning from man flesh. This is he said the gospel which I preach. I'm not just saying what a man said. I'm not just this wasn't just alone what I was taught by man. This is what the rabbis would do about the the scripture. They could only teach what they read. But when Jesus said this day this scripture is fulfilled. If you have a revelation of that, then what you teach and what you can preach is not after man, &gt;&gt; but it's after the fulfillment. &gt;&gt; He says, I didn't just receive it from man, neither was I taught it by man, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ. I will now uh focus on I mentioned it earlier in terms of manifestations and how you could write about what you observe and what you see or art can portray a manifestation of God. It's not just the external manifestation then that when we behold it and we see it that we can then begin to uh paint that picture as we observe it. And some artists can do that. They just trace. Can't tell you how many times uh my daughter has come to me and shown me something and I'm like you trace that like you you cheated. That's AI. And she'll say no. And what she'll do is she'll look at something and she can draw what she sees. And it's it's not realism in the sense that I don't know which one's real. Sometimes you see those in terms of which one's real, faith or cake, right? And all you got to do is test it and you figure it out. So there's a way that you can observe something in its manifestation and describe it. But that's not what Paul is saying. What Paul is saying now is that I've received it by revelation of Jesus Christ. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So then if I could put it in these words to say that revelation uh he says the gospel I received I'm trying to summarize the way he says here by the revelation of Jesus Christ. So revelation from without or from man is a contradiction. Catch this. I received it by revelation of Jesus Christ. So the there's no such thing as external revelation and maybe there's some semantics to this but I am making a dist distinction between manifestation and the revelation of the manifestation &gt;&gt; because no external manifestation alone reveals God. &gt;&gt; Otherwise nature itself would have been sufficient. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. CREATION ITSELF. &gt;&gt; IF IT COULD REVEAL GOD, then God could have just done it through nature. &gt;&gt; And then and and that we I could argue my response to that would be, well, nature doesn't fully reveal God. We say, "All right, that's good. So, who did who fully embodied the father? Jesus Christ did." But that manifestation alone in seeing him, NOT EVERYBODY WHO SAW HIM SAID, "GOD, WHAT'S UP?" &gt;&gt; RIGHT? THAT'S DEITY RIGHT THERE. THAT THAT'S THAT'S my heaven boy, NOT MY HOMEBOY, RIGHT? THAT'S GOD RIGHT THERE. NO, THEY DIDN'T SEE IT LIKE that &gt;&gt; because it took a revelation to see God. &gt;&gt; In Isaiah 64:4, from since the beginning of the world, men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, &gt;&gt; neither hath the eye seen, oh God. &gt;&gt; I love it. You'd almost just say they have not seen you. But he says, "Oh God, beside thee, what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him." Isaiah is drawing from a very clear principle in scripture that God is not known by outward senses. His manifestation can be felt. The effects of his presence can be observed. What was the earthquake, the wind, and the fire to Elijah? The effects of his passing by. &gt;&gt; Or was it Elisha? I'm going I'm losing it. My jokes don't land. Now I can't get Elijah and Elisha together. So there is he's saying that I have not seen that men have not heard with the ear or seen with the eyes things that God has made or prepared the reality that this what it is. If I could put it in these terms, no description of God's glory could illuminate our souls to his brilliant beauty. No, no description. Oh, God is all powerful. God fills all time and space. And we begin to talk about God and his greatness and his glory. TALK ABOUT CREATION AND TALK about the stars. There's no picture that can be painted OR STORY TOLD THAT COULD ILLUMINATE THE SOUL to this truth. &gt;&gt; No explanation of Christ can DECLARE HIS GREATNESS TO OUR SOULS. NOTICE it says in 1 Corinthians chapter 2:es 9 and 10. But as it is written, I hath not seen nor ear heard. This is where the as written was. As written, Isaiah 64. But as it as it is written, I hath not seen nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man. The things which God prepared for them that love him. Why don't they crucify Paul in this instance for completely butchering the words of Isaiah here? Because he said, "Hath prepared for him that waiteth for him." And here he says, "Hath prepared for them that love him." Perhaps faithfulness to the semantics isn't what is is true faith or obedience. But understanding &gt;&gt; that level that that to say him that waitth for him. It's not just merely someone who's patient, but someone who loves, who understands, who's been touched and feels. He says, "Now, now Paul adds verse 10, but God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit. For the spirit searchth all things, yay, the deep things. What we need in addition to throat coat is we need a revelation by the spirit to our soul. &gt;&gt; The the external manifestation can be described but that description is not the revelation. The gospels describe a and I I'll say this as we even piggybacking off of what Paul says here. He's received the revelation of Jesus Christ. Paul essentially writes the New Testament. So what is he writing? What's been revealed to him and how he has manifested God has manifested himself to him. But those that beautiful work of art which this scripture is alone is not what we worship nor is in reading this the that describes the manifestation and and being able to understand WHAT IT SAYS. NOR THAT is not to know God. It takes a revealing of the word, of the scripture, OF THAT PORTRAIT THAT'S PAINTED IN THE GOSPELS THAT HAS TO BE REVEALED TO US TO BE ABLE TO SAY, "I KNOW him &gt;&gt; as my savior." &gt;&gt; 2 Corinthians 4:6 said, "We haven't already read verse four, how the mind was blinded, lest the light shine." Now he says in verse 6, "For God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness hath shined into our hearts." There are some that are blinded, BUT NOW THAT SAME LIGHT SHINES INTO WHERE? Our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. It means that you could be looking at Jesus Christ, looking at it. But unless the light shines into your heart, &gt;&gt; you'll never see the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; The light has to shine. The revelation of the portrait of Christ is what allows us to truly recognize him and know him. &gt;&gt; Someone could say, "Well, what are you looking at? I'm looking at a dark blonde hair, blue-eyed Jesus." You know, "Oh, that's the Christ of 1940 painted by Salman who wanted to make Jesus more recognizable and it almost looks like a head shot for a social media post." No, that's that's not Christ. They'll say, "Well, I'm looking at a man who was born of a virgin. I'm looking at a man who walked on water. I'm looking." It's like, "Okay, that's what the scripture says, &gt;&gt; but how do you know him?" &gt;&gt; Verse 13, for you have heard of my con conversation in time past in the Jews. He's in my prior life, Jews religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God and wasted it. There's a lot of there's a lot of really fascinating things about Paul and his position a as Paul is looking at the gospel that he received as the fulfillment of everything he said or believed as a Jew which is true because the promises that we're to receive in this hour is not necessarily a departure from Christianity. It's the fulfillment of everything Christianity has believed. And yet what Paul is describing is not the elevation of Judaism, &gt;&gt; not the next step or evolution of Judaism. It's almost as if Judaism always foreshadowed this, but now here comes the perfect fulfillment &gt;&gt; of all the hopes of Israel. And now this has become what being a Jew is. That's why you come to Revelation. It says there's those that claim to be Jews, but there are the synagogue of Satan. says, "Those that profess to be Christians, profess to be the real chosen of God, but yet have not yet received his Holy Spirit are not born again." &gt;&gt; So he says, he's speaking of this, "How beyond measure I persecuted the church of God and wasted it and profited in the Jews religion above many my equals in my own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers." [snorts] But when it pleased God, for so it seemed good in thy sight. But when it pleased God, catch this beautiful phrasing, who separated me from my mother's womb. So God's calling in Paul's life was in him from birth. &gt;&gt; That's what he's trying to do. He's trying to bring this distinction. I've lived this entire life believing something and then I wasted the church and but yet this calling was in me from the beginning. He separated from my mother's womb and called me by his grace. to reveal his son in me. &gt;&gt; to reveal his son in me. I was ordained. He's saying from the very beginning. It pleased God. It was good in GOD'S SIGHT TO DETERMINE his calling in me from birth. It's there. It's been there my whole life. To reveal his son in me. Christ was revealed in Paul, &gt;&gt; not to Paul &gt;&gt; or not just to Paul. If I could put it in these terms, can something be revealed to you that has not been revealed in you? Come on, all you philosophy majors, you're like, "Now, let's talk. Why did they not see beauty in Jesus Christ? Why did they not see an attraction in Jesus Christ? Because that beauty wasn't in them. Why did they not see the light of the world, the light of God, the light of the word, because that light was not in them? &gt;&gt; You following me? That's scripture. &gt;&gt; They didn't recognize it. They didn't see it because it wasn't in them. So now we begin to realize what's happening is almost like this inversion. You see Jesus AND YOU'RE LIKE, "OH, THAT'S GOD. THAT'S CHRIST." BUT IT WAS IN HERE FIRST. &gt;&gt; Something was there first. &gt;&gt; It's not just the eye that sees or the ear that hears. This is what the scripture Isaiah 64 and 1 Corinthians are saying, but it's the soul that responds to the spirit, the capital S spirit, the spirit of God. Right? &gt;&gt; You can only appreciate and admire beauty when you have beauty in your heart. &gt;&gt; I mean, how many of us could look at a FOOT AND SAY, "WOW, THAT IS A PERFECT FOOT." Unless you've been trained, right, as a podiatrist TO SAY, "WOW, THAT IS A PERFECT FOOT." Thank you, brother Scott. Wash my feet. That's what we're here for, right? Bible does say beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel. &gt;&gt; Right? I don't care how ugly my feet look right now. I've got this promise that says it's beautiful. I've got band-aids on two of my toes right now as I say that. There there has to be it has to be in you first. You can only admire this has meant so much to me as of late. You can only admire I thank God for this. You can only admire what's in your soul. &gt;&gt; I find myself often admiring believers. Some of the brothers in this church, I admire them because they seem to be so much unlike me. And I realize I only admire that trait in them &gt;&gt; because it's in me to be that also. &gt;&gt; You can only admire what's in your heart. How did you know what love was? Kindness can be appreciated because kindness is in your heart. Diligent, someone who WORKS HARD, YOU ADMIRE THAT, you appreciate it because it's in your heart. &gt;&gt; That's why people can work hard and they can be kind. People don't appreciate it. It's not in them. &gt;&gt; For beauty, for characteristics, for attributes to truly be admired, they must be possessed. Why is it Why is it you cry over at at a painting? Why is it some people are moved to tears? Why is it that even maybe some movies or music causes us to weep? Because it appeals to experience. I remember that my propensity to get emotional was exponential uh once you marry and have children because now there's a greater depth of relationship and empathy and there's feelings you never knew before but we respond TO THINGS BECAUSE THAT THAT what's being depicted is in us. If the feeling is not previously within, if the feeling is not previously within, the manifestation will not put it there. You could be wa watching a a family movie that's been vid angel um and and and you're watching it and all of a sudden a a mom begins to cry and the kids like her baby just died. That's it, man. Like what are you getting all weepy for? Right? Cuz a mom's looking at being like, "Ah, right. There has to be the manifestation. People look at things and the manifestation itself doesn't cause everyone to, oh, Jesus Christ was the perfection of beauty." AND PEOPLE LOOKED AT THAT AND TURNED THEIR EYES. &gt;&gt; The musicians, if you'd please come to your instruments, we'll close here. these things that I I'm I'm stopping on that it's not just with the eye that sees or the ear that hears, but there's got to be a light that strikes the soul. And I say, I've seen the portrait of a perfect man by revelation because look, I read the Bible. I read the Bible and he's painted here, but it's got to be revealed to me by his spirit. And when it's revealed to me by his spirit, it's almost like this discovering myself because Paul said it was a mirror. &gt;&gt; It's in you. And we look at it, we read it. Maybe we've been very religious. We've had life experiences. And just as Paul said, it was always there from the time I was born. But now God did something deeper and he discovered I was allowed to by the spirit discover something that was in me that I never knew was there. And this is the description that's being made. It's not just the eye that sees or the ear that hears. That sound familiar, Eliza? My daughter Eliza sent me this statement this [music] morning. She text this to me in the sermon, the voice of God in the last days. She texted to [music] our family little family chat that I know some of you are triggered by and you submitted a request that I not mention that and uh it got past our filters. It was in [music] our spam folder. I apologize, but I know what it's like to leave family chats. [music] Trust me. He said Moses heard the voice of God. So Moses, he hears the voice of God. [music] Remember, he knew he was well taught. He was well taught in the the religion of Egypt. But then even Moses was told that he was a deliverer. And what did he try to do by that teaching? [music] This understanding, well, I'm to be a deliverer. And what did it produce? One dead Egyptian. But then he heard the voice of God and Moses was never the same. You could be told over and over again, over and over again, service after service, sermon after sermon, scripture after scripture, but then when God speaks to you, you're never the same. And he said, "No man is ever the same. You might hear in your ears the voice speaking, but when you hear in your heart the voice speaking, [music] then you are hearing." We had about a 30-minute conversation yesterday among all six family members on what the difference [music] what hearing means and what listening means. And it was very this is not what inspired the sermon. Uh though I'd like I'd love for you to think that some [music] conversation in the afternoon could produce this. But what I received was not of man. When you hear his voice, then you're hearing. You do not see with your eye. You look with your eye. You see with [music] your heart. Do you see that? Yeah, I see that. Describe it. It's like, uh, do you see with your heart? I see this. I [music] see that. I see this. I see that. I read this. I read that. But do you see with your heart? You see something, say, I just don't see it. What do you mean? I don't understand it. You do not hear with your ears. You hear with your heart. Many times your ears hear the true voice of God and it falls [music] off you like water off a duck's back. But when you really hear, you hear with your heart. It's because Christ is revealed to our heart that we see Christ. And therefore, [music] it's not it's not that we just pass out Bibles and the Bible, all the read the Bible, read the Bible. But we we pray for revelation that God would reveal Christ that the light would strike and be revealed in the heart. And that's when the eye is opened to see God in the manifestation. [music] See, it doesn't work externally. When the word is preached, you hear it. But when supernaturally the light in that [music] word strikes your soul, then you're like, "Oh, wait a minute. That's the truth. That's what God is wanting us to be." If I could just end here, [music] we'll continue in some of these other things because I'll just say it. He said, "He reveals his son in me that I might preach him among the Gentiles." That is you. &gt;&gt; He is wanting to reveal himself in [music] you. This internal, not the external, but this internal transformation in a re revelation of the portrait of a perfect man. And then we could all say, "Oh, we've got it. We've got it. We've got it. But [music] he says, "No, I've revealed him in you so that you could now be an expression, a [music] measure of that perfect man that our light, our manifestation could be the means by which God can supernaturally transmit." And someone sees you and you're like, "I don't know what it is, but I I I'm inquiring. I'm wanting to know." And then what we what [music] we desire is that God would reveal himself to his children. If we could stand to our feet today, [music] let's pray. If you desire prayer, we're always available [music] to pray with you. But I believe that you, if you haven't discovered it, you [music] have faith in you right now to receive it where you are. [snorts] A gracious heavenly father. Lord, I feel a little little uneasy just as a man and maybe just with my knowing what [music] else we had to share today that we could be leaving this in a spot that's incomplete. But Lord, if I have not seen nor ear heard or is even entered into our imagination, our thoughts and what we could conjecture and expect the things which you have prepared for us [music] because we love you. And for those that are the called according to your purpose, perhaps you could just fill the void now by revelation. What we have not heard, what we have not seen, Lord, [music] you could just quicken into our hearts and we could be satisfied today to know that the Bible is a portrait of a perfect man. [music] But it's not until you reveal yourself in us that [music] we can now look into the portrait and see you. And Lord, we will not get this revelation just by merely laying on on a cot and just trying to make our minds go blank. Truly, Lord, there's just this way that you use prayer and you use reading the Bible and you use the preaching of the word of God and listening to the word and reading the word. You use that as a means of kind of just moving our spirits long enough for that channel to open for the true light of your word to enter our hearts because it is radiating. It is shining. And therefore, Lord, your scripture teaches [music] that we all with open face beholding him as in a glass that's a mirror. [snorts] May the obstructions be moved out of the way so that we do see you. But then being seeing you take this yoke. We take this yoke upon us because now we don't just see you but we see ourselves in you. And we realize that we have this revelation of Jesus Christ in our souls. And it's joined us to the same calling to be a manifestation of God in this last days. And so Lord, so much of our lives becomes this [music] balance of being able to keep that mirror unobstructed so that we're seeing you, so that others could see you. And Lord, bless us today as we have many needs in our hearts. We have many needs [music] in our lives physically, spiritually, emotionally, financially. Lord, there's not one need that's not represented by those hearing this today. And I pray that [music] you would break every chain of addiction. you would heal all sorts of fears and anxieties [music] because of afflictions. That you would deliver those that are oppressed. [music] That you would give wisdom to those who are financially laboring. And Lord, above all, we pray we pray and [music] we call upon you for revelation more than anything. more than anything, Lord, because it's transformative. And Jesus [music] Christ is the stature, the measurements, the proportions of a [music] perfect man. And truly, Lord, the word of God as written tells us about that image. the prophets, the disciples, and Paul wrote a great work of art that describes that paints the picture of a perfect man. [music] But Lord, we'll never see it until you reveal it in us. That's [music] our prayer, Lord. We ask this in the name of Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
