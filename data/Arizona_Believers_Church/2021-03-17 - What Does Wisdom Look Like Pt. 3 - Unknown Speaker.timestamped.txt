[0:00] take every heart that's here that's
[0:02] willingly offered to you
[0:03] upon that potter's will and molded as
[0:06] you would see fit
[0:08] lord to those that would tune in and
[0:11] stream the service lord i do not believe
[0:14] they do it because they're going to
[0:15] criticize or because they're trying to
[0:16] find fault
[0:18] they're doing it because they're hungry
[0:20] they're doing it because they want to
[0:22] hear from you and they're seeking
[0:23] something they're searching something
[0:25] so lord i pray you would speak to their
[0:27] hearts just as we've gathered to receive
[0:29] from you may those that would stream
[0:31] and are even follow up in the archive
[0:33] lord may they receive something special
[0:35] from you for
[0:36] lord criticism and pride has not drawn
[0:39] them
[0:40] to stream lord it's a hunger even
[0:43] unbeknownst to them
[0:44] that draws them to do it lord speak to
[0:46] them i pray lord bless us tonight as
[0:48] we've gathered in your presence
[0:49] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[0:51] pray amen
[0:53] amen i'm going to be reading from
[0:54] colossians chapter 4 so if you'd like to
[0:56] grab your bibles while you're standing
[0:58] i'd like to read from colossians chapter
[1:00] 4 and read the first
[1:02] six verses there compliments to brother
[1:06] michael and
[1:06] for the loyal brother micah with the
[1:08] song service just doing a tremendous job
[1:11] and i enjoy their gifts so much and i'm
[1:14] so grateful that god has seen
[1:15] fit to place them amongst us so may god
[1:19] richly bless them and i mean that
[1:20] brothers you're doing a tremendous job
[1:21] and thank you
[1:22] so much i'm sure you're enjoying it too
[1:25] and you can always
[1:26] take the liberty to express it if it's
[1:28] sincere if it's fake
[1:30] you know maybe maybe hold off but it's
[1:32] sincere i'm sure none of these
[1:34] gifts that are present amongst us and
[1:35] those who sing specials and labor in
[1:37] different ways
[1:38] they love love to hear that
[1:40] communication back to them
[1:43] colossians chapter 4 verses 1 to 6.
[1:46] i hope when i come to this later i want
[1:48] to be able to point this out again but
[1:50] if you look in chapter 3
[1:52] it's very much akin to ephesians chapter
[1:54] five where paul is instructing
[1:57] husbands wives parents children so it's
[2:00] directed
[2:01] following his direction to family there
[2:03] in chapter three so he says masters
[2:05] given to your servants that which is
[2:07] just an equal knowing that you also have
[2:09] a
[2:09] master which is teacher ahead in heaven
[2:12] and then that kind of summarizes his uh
[2:15] speaking to these different offices and
[2:17] these different relationships
[2:19] then this is to all of us collectively
[2:21] continue in prayer and watch in the same
[2:23] with thanksgiving
[2:24] with all praying also for us that god
[2:26] would speak open
[2:27] unto us excuse me that god would open
[2:30] unto us a door of utterance to
[2:32] speak the mystery of christ which i am
[2:34] also in bonds we're praying
[2:36] that liberty would be granted to him to
[2:38] speak this mystery that's what he's
[2:39] praying to those at colossia
[2:41] and he says that i may make it manifest
[2:44] as i ought to speak so it's the
[2:45] manifestation of the mystery
[2:47] speaking these great and profound things
[2:48] of christ and then as that would be our
[2:51] prayer this is what he desires for us
[2:52] individually
[2:53] walk in wisdom toward them that are
[2:56] without redeeming the time
[2:58] let your speech be alway with grace
[3:00] seasoned with salt
[3:01] that ye may know how you ought to answer
[3:05] every man walk in wisdom toward them
[3:07] that are outside the body of christ
[3:09] outside the faith
[3:10] redeeming the time let your speech be
[3:12] always always
[3:13] have your speech seasoned with grace
[3:16] seasoned with salt let it be with grace
[3:18] in a graceful way seasoned with salt
[3:20] that you may know how you ought to
[3:21] answer to every man this is a response
[3:24] this is something
[3:25] being given to man wonderful reading you
[3:28] can have your seats this evening
[3:30] and with that as a a context i'd like
[3:33] just to jump right in
[3:34] uh to our subject tonight we're
[3:36] continuing on the question what does
[3:38] wisdom look like
[3:39] we're focusing specifically on meekness
[3:42] that wisdom is meek and it's an
[3:43] essential
[3:44] attribute and characteristic of wisdom
[3:47] and
[3:47] i think one way just to summarize where
[3:49] we've been through the first
[3:51] couple services on this subject matter
[3:53] is that
[3:54] wisdom is the word and humility it is
[3:57] the meekness of christ
[3:58] who is the treasure of all wisdom and
[4:01] the treasure of all
[4:02] knowledge and understanding and i'm
[4:04] wanting to expound upon james chapter 3
[4:07] so you could also turn there
[4:09] and you'll find several verses that we'd
[4:10] like to read beginning in verse
[4:13] and ask this question who is the wise
[4:15] man and a dude with knowledge among you
[4:18] who's this teacher
[4:19] who's the master the teacher amongst you
[4:21] he is going to be
[4:22] supposed to be wise and have knowledge
[4:25] empowered with knowledge
[4:26] he says if there's going to be one who
[4:28] assumes the role of leader or teacher
[4:30] let him show out of a good conversation
[4:33] out of a life
[4:34] lived his work so he must have works
[4:36] that follows his
[4:38] assumption or profession that he's in
[4:40] this position of leadership or this
[4:42] position of being a teacher and all of
[4:44] us
[4:46] we are supposed to grow in grace and to
[4:48] a place where we
[4:49] ourselves are also teachers and we're
[4:50] communicating the faith
[4:52] effectively so we bring ourselves under
[4:54] this same admonishment
[4:56] let him show out of a life a manner of
[4:58] life a good conduct a good conversation
[5:01] his works with this phrase to me is what
[5:03] we're amplifying
[5:05] meekness of wisdom because true wisdom
[5:08] is always accompanied with
[5:10] meekness meekness as it would uh relate
[5:12] to the government of passions and
[5:14] controlling your emotions
[5:16] that wisdom is for is going to exhibit
[5:18] itself
[5:19] in a meekness meekness is something as
[5:22] we looked at these other verses as we'll
[5:23] read through them and you could read in
[5:24] 14 and 15 and 16
[5:26] how it's referring to this how that
[5:28] meekness or wisdom is not loud
[5:31] wisdom is not arrogant wisdom does not
[5:34] need to be accepted or submitted to
[5:36] because it has a higher volume than
[5:38] anything else does not need to be
[5:40] accepted because it seems to be more
[5:42] more forceful or it's branded better you
[5:44] accept wisdom because it's true
[5:46] you accept wisdom because it has a a
[5:49] meekness to it that makes it acceptable
[5:50] and even pleasing so
[5:52] true wisdom is not loud or arrogant and
[5:55] so as we could read some of these other
[5:56] verses
[5:57] and we're kind of just catching up on a
[5:58] couple things that we administered on
[6:00] last time
[6:01] wisdom does luck does not look noisy it
[6:04] is not intimidating
[6:06] and so wisdom then as it relates to the
[6:08] scriptures that james or
[6:09] the scriptures in james it's not
[6:11] self-justifying it's not selfish
[6:13] wisdom does not advise for its own
[6:16] benefit but it does for your benefit
[6:17] it advises it instructs and encourages
[6:20] for your own benefit
[6:21] and in the context that james is
[6:23] referring to wisdom
[6:25] and uh setting it as opposed to wisdom
[6:28] which is from beneath
[6:30] wisdom that is from above is not caustic
[6:32] it does not um bring up a stir up strife
[6:35] or arouse conflict
[6:37] and there's a way that you can give
[6:38] somebody your opinion and you think
[6:40] you're imparting wisdom
[6:41] but you share your opinion and what does
[6:43] it do it kind of provokes a fight
[6:45] why because it didn't the way that it
[6:47] was shared aroused more conflict than it
[6:50] did consideration and thought and
[6:52] and a pondering of it so wisdom which is
[6:55] from below
[6:56] is characterized by jealousy and
[6:58] selfishness
[6:59] which the scripture says in james
[7:00] chapter 3 results in chaos or disorder
[7:03] that's the wisdom which is from beneath
[7:04] it is it is characterized as
[7:06] being jealous and being strifeful or
[7:08] selfish and it results in conflict and
[7:11] and you just you confront something and
[7:14] you're giving you're wanting to help but
[7:15] you confront it you wade into it too
[7:17] forcefully you
[7:18] you're not using wisdom so it stirs
[7:20] things up and it convolutes and it
[7:22] causes disorder or chaos and so
[7:26] this wisdom which is from beneath
[7:28] results in this disputing and fighting
[7:31] and kind of the target that i've been
[7:33] chasing
[7:34] and these things that i've been
[7:35] expressing is how that wisdom brings a
[7:37] rest
[7:38] and i wanted to share more on this rest
[7:40] how what does wisdom look like it looks
[7:42] as if it's at rest it's something
[7:44] that's restful but we're just failed to
[7:46] impress upon more in this sense of
[7:49] meekness but this disputing and fighting
[7:52] and criticism
[7:53] it marks one that isn't as rest at rest
[7:56] so when someone has true wisdom they can
[7:59] rest in the truth of their wisdom when
[8:01] wisdom is on their side
[8:02] and the truth is on their side they
[8:04] don't have to resort to different
[8:05] tactics
[8:06] to produce a particular result they're
[8:07] like this is true
[8:09] if you follow truth it yields something
[8:12] it brings forth something and you rest
[8:13] in that
[8:14] and so if there's fighting and criticism
[8:16] even fear or intimidation and force
[8:19] that there's a mark of somebody who's
[8:20] not at rest because it's not the
[8:22] meekness
[8:23] of christ it's not the meekness that was
[8:25] associated with christ
[8:27] and we were reading the statement how
[8:28] that brother bannon says
[8:30] that christ overcame how did he overcome
[8:33] in his personal life how did he overcome
[8:34] personal temptation
[8:36] all by the word and humility
[8:39] we can say all day long we've got the
[8:41] word we got the word we got the correct
[8:42] interpretation of the bible the correct
[8:44] translation
[8:45] we've got the perfect word uh made
[8:47] perfectly clear the perfect
[8:48] interpretation of the word with divine
[8:50] vindication
[8:51] and you can have all that word on your
[8:53] side by profession but if you don't have
[8:55] humility it's never going to be
[8:56] effective
[8:57] so we overcome in your own personal life
[8:59] if you're going to overcome as a
[9:01] christian
[9:01] it takes the word and humility and
[9:04] brother brahm says oh my
[9:05] there's the real man there's the one to
[9:08] make your example
[9:10] so we make christ our example and our
[9:13] example of
[9:14] successful life our example of
[9:16] overcoming is the word and humility
[9:19] he has laid for us an example he has set
[9:21] for us an example
[9:22] that we are to follow and it's not just
[9:25] merely asking ourselves
[9:26] what would jesus do but it's knowing the
[9:28] word understanding the word
[9:30] and humbling ourselves to it that is how
[9:32] he overcame
[9:33] that is how we overcome and we ended
[9:36] last wednesday night in looking at the
[9:38] example of david and how david
[9:40] we could even point out that god
[9:42] characterized him
[9:43] as being a man after his own heart so
[9:45] there was something about david despite
[9:47] all of his flaws
[9:49] that in the end he got it right in the
[9:51] end there was something about
[9:53] his ability to say i'm sorry and to
[9:55] repent
[9:56] despite all his mistakes and all his
[9:58] sins he could ultimately get it right
[10:00] and if you just compare david's faults
[10:02] to saul's
[10:03] saul just sacrificed when it wasn't
[10:05] convenient saul and paul
[10:06] you know entered in onto the the role of
[10:08] a prophet
[10:09] and he had the kingdom taken away from
[10:11] him david committed adultery and
[10:13] committed murder
[10:14] and yet his consequences he couldn't
[10:16] build the temple yet the kingdom
[10:18] remained with him
[10:19] and it's amazing when you begin to think
[10:20] about the sins of david versus the sins
[10:22] of saul
[10:23] and you find it was the condition of the
[10:25] heart that ultimately condemned saul
[10:27] and kept them from ever walking in a
[10:28] path that was pleasing to god
[10:30] but david despite his mistakes and
[10:32] despite his pride and despite his
[10:34] arrogance
[10:34] he finally overthrew his pride which was
[10:38] represented in those sons of surya he
[10:39] overthrew his pride and his selfish
[10:41] ambition
[10:42] and he found the meekness of wisdom
[10:45] he found it in the face of one who was
[10:47] criticizing him spitting in his face
[10:49] and and ranting against him and mocking
[10:51] him because of his own family turning
[10:53] against him
[10:54] he said you know what perhaps god has
[10:56] caused him to do this
[10:57] and if i handle this well god will bring
[10:59] me a blessing in it
[11:01] he found the meekness of wisdom so we
[11:03] make christ
[11:04] our example this is what wisdom looks
[11:06] like it looks meek
[11:08] in first corinthians chapter 10 verse 1
[11:10] he says now i
[11:11] paul myself beseech you so this is a
[11:13] pleading
[11:14] a teaching an admonishment that paul is
[11:16] doing he said i'm beseech you i'm
[11:18] pleading with you
[11:19] by the meekness and gentleness of christ
[11:23] we could even say that these are
[11:24] characteristics of the word the word is
[11:27] all-powerful
[11:28] nothing has ever over overwhelmed it
[11:30] nothing can overthrow it but yet
[11:32] in all its power there's a meekness and
[11:34] gentleness with it
[11:36] so he's not coming with the power of
[11:38] christ and and the magnitude of christ
[11:40] he's using the words i want to beseech
[11:43] you plead with you implore you
[11:46] by the meekness and gentleness of christ
[11:49] and this is the meekness and gentleness
[11:51] of the word so he is painting a picture
[11:54] of grace and patience as the hallmarks
[11:58] of correction and instruction when he's
[12:01] beseeching someone and he's wanting i
[12:02] want you to get this and i'm wanting you
[12:04] here to the corinthians in this letter
[12:06] he's writing them which is going to
[12:08] carry some very in your face bold
[12:10] correction he said i'm imploring
[12:12] i'm beseeching you by the meekness and
[12:14] gentleness of christ
[12:16] because these the meekness and
[12:17] gentleness of christ are the hallmarks
[12:20] of proper correction
[12:21] and proper instruction hold those two
[12:24] words in your heart and in your mind
[12:25] today
[12:26] as we go forward in this that he is
[12:28] looking at grace and patience this
[12:30] meekness and gentleness
[12:31] as the the characteristics of effective
[12:33] discipline
[12:35] if it's going to be a fact of correction
[12:37] or effective effective instruction
[12:39] is going to have to this have this
[12:40] meekness and gentleness
[12:43] and so this becomes as christ is our
[12:46] example
[12:47] christ having this meekness and
[12:49] gentleness he's our example of
[12:51] leadership
[12:52] not only is he our example of leadership
[12:55] he's our example of submission
[12:57] if we're if we're wanting if we're
[12:59] wanting to be like christ
[13:01] we cannot look at it as the act of us
[13:04] we can't look at it as king of the hill
[13:06] right i'm not referring to
[13:09] a sitcom i think there's a sitcom called
[13:10] king of the hill or something like that
[13:12] i don't know never seen an episode but
[13:14] it's we're talking about when you have a
[13:15] mound of
[13:16] anything and all the boys do what king
[13:18] of the hill king of the mountain
[13:19] and you try to throw the person off so
[13:21] we're not looking at a situation we're
[13:22] trying to
[13:23] send to the highest point we're rising
[13:25] to the highest point we're pushing
[13:26] another person off
[13:27] that's not what it means uh to come to
[13:30] come to this place of
[13:31] to leadership in a place of headship but
[13:33] we can only do it by
[13:34] getting as small as we possibly can the
[13:37] way up is down so it's not only our
[13:39] example of leadership but
[13:40] this example of leadership is found in
[13:43] submission the way that christ
[13:47] lived the way that he act is uh the
[13:49] model behavior for us
[13:51] it's behavior that we should model in
[13:53] learning
[13:54] and in teaching though in those two
[13:57] senses in our learning as we learn but
[13:59] also as we teach as we instruct
[14:01] he's the example of the behavior the
[14:03] character the attributes
[14:04] that we should model that we should
[14:06] emulate be therefore
[14:07] dear followers be therefore followers of
[14:10] god
[14:11] as dear children so this is an example
[14:13] that we model
[14:14] after that we want to be exemplified in
[14:17] our own lives
[14:18] it says in hebrews chapter 5 verse 8 i'm
[14:20] just going to use a couple scriptures
[14:23] to identify how that christ is an
[14:25] example of learning
[14:26] christ is an example of submission
[14:28] though he were his son
[14:30] yet learned he obedience and says
[14:33] obedience by the things which he
[14:34] suffered but let's just focus on this
[14:36] one part
[14:36] he learned christ was a son and as a son
[14:40] he learned this is important for us to
[14:42] take in and let it wash over us
[14:44] christ the son of god learned he learned
[14:46] then you are going to have to
[14:48] learn if he learned you learn he learned
[14:51] obedience we've got to learn
[14:53] obedience there's things that are
[14:54] instructed to us while i'm predestinated
[14:56] i'm elected i'm a son of god
[14:58] i've been born again i'm filled with the
[14:59] holy ghost that's wonderful that means
[15:01] you're in the condition
[15:02] to learn you're in a position to receive
[15:04] instruction you're a position
[15:06] to grow so he learned this is the
[15:08] example this is the
[15:09] meekness and gentleness of christ first
[15:11] that we identify with
[15:12] he learned in luke chapter 2 verses 51
[15:16] to 52
[15:17] as the story is told that they were up
[15:18] in jerusalem and he was left behind
[15:20] by joseph and mary he was found in
[15:24] the temple teaching and and exchanging
[15:27] thoughts with the
[15:28] with the priest and they find him and
[15:30] where were you my
[15:31] your father and i have sought you and he
[15:32] goes i must be about my father's
[15:34] business
[15:35] it says in verse 51 and he went down
[15:38] with him with joseph and mary he went
[15:39] down
[15:40] with him and came to nazareth and was
[15:43] subject unto them he had full
[15:47] understanding that his he was called to
[15:50] do
[15:50] his father's business not not a
[15:52] carpenter in joseph's shop
[15:54] his uh who would be recognized as his
[15:56] earthly dad he
[15:57] was fully cognizant of this relationship
[16:00] he had with his heavenly father
[16:02] and he espoused this is what i must be
[16:04] faithful to i must be about my father's
[16:06] business
[16:06] but it did not keep him from subjecting
[16:09] himself to his earthly parents
[16:11] the ones that god had entrusted him to
[16:13] so he says he was subject unto them but
[16:14] his mother kept all these saints in her
[16:16] heart
[16:17] and jesus increased in wisdom
[16:21] though he were son he learned so here we
[16:23] see once again
[16:24] that jesus subject to his parents
[16:27] increased his wisdom this is the model
[16:29] behavior
[16:29] there's anyone here 12 today and you
[16:31] want to get something out of service
[16:32] this is what you can get out of service
[16:34] make yourself subject to your parents
[16:36] this is how you increase in wisdom
[16:38] and stature and in favor with god and
[16:41] man
[16:42] so we cannot the increase of his wisdom
[16:45] the increase of his understanding and
[16:46] his knowledge is it related
[16:48] to this life of jesus christ we cannot
[16:51] separate it from the fact that he made
[16:53] himself
[16:53] subject to joseph and mary made himself
[16:56] subject to them
[16:57] and the bible says he increased in
[16:58] wisdom and as he increased in wisdom
[17:00] he also increased in favor with god how
[17:03] could he increase in favor with god
[17:05] as it unfolded in his life through
[17:07] submission as he was taught as he
[17:09] learned obedience he increased in favor
[17:11] with god
[17:11] and man so these attributes of christ
[17:15] this
[17:15] meekness and gentleness of christ this
[17:18] attribute of one that learns one that
[17:20] becomes subject one that increases in
[17:21] wisdom
[17:22] cannot be separated from the attributes
[17:25] that we give him
[17:26] as teacher we look at christ as being
[17:29] the master of all circumstance we look
[17:30] at him as the treasure
[17:32] of all wisdom and knowledge he is the
[17:33] master he is the head they called him
[17:35] rabbi teacher
[17:36] you are the master you are the teacher
[17:38] we cannot separate these attributes of
[17:40] being meek and being gentle being
[17:42] able to learn being able to submit
[17:44] himself and being able to increase in
[17:45] wisdom
[17:46] we cannot take that away from the
[17:48] picture of him as a teacher
[17:50] he is the he is considered the good
[17:52] shepherd he is considered the great
[17:54] shepherd so he's the leader he is the
[17:56] one that looks out over the flock he's
[17:57] the one that feeds he's the one that
[17:59] cares for
[18:00] he's the one that provides all these
[18:02] attributes that we look to him and
[18:03] ascribe to him as the powerful one
[18:05] the preeminent one the leader the head
[18:07] the shepherd these
[18:09] other attributes have to be part of the
[18:11] picture to fully understand his nature
[18:13] and character
[18:14] as the head again the head is not just
[18:16] the king of the hill the person who gets
[18:18] up there
[18:18] and overthrows everyone else there's a
[18:20] way to get to the top and the way up is
[18:22] down
[18:23] through submission through teaching
[18:25] through learning
[18:26] and so he was effective and this is
[18:30] this is something that is very very dear
[18:32] to my heart as god is ex
[18:34] is in a very supernatural profound way
[18:37] and press this upon me
[18:38] and i've wanted to preach a whole sermon
[18:41] on it
[18:42] and i just find that i've got to give
[18:45] outlet to it
[18:47] and say this about christ he was
[18:48] effective and he is effective he was
[18:51] effective and
[18:51] is effective as a shepherd because he's
[18:54] always a sheep
[18:58] we call christ the great shepherd he's
[19:00] called the good shepherd
[19:03] there this is how the lord you were
[19:05] raised in the good shepherd fellowship
[19:06] right
[19:07] i remember preaching there many years
[19:08] ago in minnesota and who's that a
[19:10] reference to it's not whoever's name is
[19:12] on the mark he is pastor it's christ
[19:14] this isn't a reference to a man this is
[19:16] jesus christ he is the good shepherd he
[19:19] is
[19:19] the master he's the teacher he's the
[19:21] great shepherd and and what makes him a
[19:23] great shepherd
[19:24] the bible does not characterize him
[19:26] alone as the great shepherd he's
[19:27] characterized as
[19:28] the lamb he's first the lamb before he's
[19:31] the lion
[19:32] what makes him a great shepherd the fact
[19:34] that he's sheep he's always sheep he's
[19:36] always a lamb there's always even a
[19:38] representation of that bleedy
[19:40] that bleeding lamb in heaven and it
[19:43] represents this nature of christ how
[19:45] he is a good shepherd he is the great
[19:47] shepherd but he's effective
[19:49] as the shepherd because he's still and
[19:51] is always a sheep
[19:53] and the most powerful tool that we have
[19:55] as parents the most powerful tool
[19:57] as we have as teachers the most powerful
[19:59] tool we have in leadership
[20:01] is the tool of example
[20:04] it's the most powerful tool in your
[20:06] arsenal as a parent trying to figure out
[20:08] how to do something with your child
[20:09] you're trying to figure out how you're
[20:09] going to make a difference you're trying
[20:10] to figure out how you can change things
[20:12] with your home
[20:12] the most powerful thing you could do is
[20:14] provide model behavior
[20:18] it's the most impactful significant
[20:20] thing you can do
[20:21] the best way to achieve a particular
[20:23] result within your family within your
[20:25] life
[20:26] in somebody else is you're trying to
[20:27] teach somebody else and help somebody
[20:28] else don't just tell them to get up at
[20:30] five o'clock every morning
[20:32] and do something go ahead and get up at
[20:33] five o'clock in the morning yourself
[20:36] and invite them to do it with you and
[20:38] you'll find that the one you're trying
[20:39] to teach to do it will find it would be
[20:41] more
[20:42] easily led and and effective in doing it
[20:47] not that there's anything special about
[20:48] getting up at five o'clock in the
[20:49] morning that just
[20:50] what popped in my mouth at the time so
[20:53] nobody try to get a hold of me at five
[20:54] o'clock in the morning unless you
[20:56] absolutely need to because i'm not
[20:57] making that a habit right now
[21:00] but it's that you want to provide
[21:02] behavior
[21:03] and i find this uh i want to express
[21:07] this in a way
[21:08] that it can be relevant to all of us one
[21:11] of the biggest
[21:13] blind spots for pastors is they forget
[21:16] that they're sheep
[21:19] not that they were sheep but they are
[21:21] sheep
[21:22] and it becomes a blind spot in
[21:23] leadership becomes a blind spot in
[21:25] parents it becomes a blind spot to
[21:27] forget
[21:27] that you were a child at one point what
[21:29] it's like to be a child what it's like
[21:30] to
[21:31] receive instruction and hear instruction
[21:33] and not understand it we forget what
[21:34] it's like so one of the biggest blind
[21:36] spots we can have a leadership one of
[21:38] the biggest blind spots
[21:39] that a pastor could have is they forget
[21:41] that they are
[21:42] sheep and they forget that they ever
[21:44] were a sheep in some cases
[21:46] they never worship they've never been
[21:49] exercised and they don't know what it's
[21:50] like to be
[21:51] to be a member of a congregation they
[21:53] forgot what it's like to be the one
[21:54] sitting in the pew they've lost the
[21:56] feeling for what it's like to be a sheep
[21:58] they've lost the feeling to know what
[21:59] it's like when your job
[22:00] schedule changes and you're not able to
[22:02] make it to church on wednesday night
[22:03] they
[22:03] they forgot what it's like to have these
[22:05] different things taking place
[22:06] and to be in a totally different
[22:07] position listen there's something about
[22:10] being the man of god who
[22:11] who has the responsibility of speaking
[22:14] every service if you don't realize that
[22:16] god speaks to you for the people's
[22:17] benefit
[22:18] and you let that get to your head you
[22:20] lose the feeling of the people he's like
[22:22] well i hear from god all the time i get
[22:23] into the word and i'm inspired and i
[22:25] read my bible and i pray
[22:26] and i'm in the word and i'm studying and
[22:28] you get a little bit of an arrogance
[22:30] towards everybody else because they
[22:32] struggle and they
[22:33] they strive and they're not able to do
[22:34] this and they find that this comes up
[22:36] and that comes up
[22:36] and you lose the feeling for what it's
[22:38] like in the everyday
[22:44] and that's instructive to us that christ
[22:46] himself
[22:47] was effective as master rabbi teacher
[22:50] leader head
[22:51] because he was a follower he was sheep
[22:55] now this subject of wisdom as we're
[22:57] asking the question what does wisdom
[22:58] look like we've looked at it from the
[23:00] standpoint that it's the word we're
[23:01] looking at it now specifically
[23:03] in terms of it being meek the subject of
[23:06] wisdom
[23:06] arose in the context of family
[23:10] and what was in my heart as god dealt
[23:12] with me
[23:13] is that we're addressing a particular
[23:14] style of headship
[23:16] addressing a particular style of
[23:18] leadership that is counterproductive
[23:21] leader implies that people are following
[23:25] you
[23:26] uh to be the head implies that there's a
[23:28] body which is subject or
[23:30] there if you're the head of a family it
[23:31] implies that there's family that have
[23:33] submitted themselves to your authority
[23:35] or leadership if you're a leader then
[23:36] there's people behind you kind of going
[23:38] where you're going
[23:39] and so what we're looking at and we're
[23:41] addressing
[23:42] certain styles and characteristics of
[23:44] ineffective leadership
[23:46] that's actually damaging and not
[23:48] productive to causing people to
[23:50] follow or submit so the subject of
[23:53] wisdom is
[23:53] within the context of family and it's
[23:56] easy to
[23:57] create the wrong kind of environment or
[23:59] the wrong kind of culture
[24:01] within a family it's very easy and
[24:04] and i say this with a lot of uh empathy
[24:07] and i say this with uh with with a lot
[24:10] of um
[24:11] mercy contained in it it's very easy
[24:13] this isn't something we set out to do
[24:15] and we've got to be bullheaded and we've
[24:16] got to really really fight really hard
[24:18] to create the wrong kind of atmosphere
[24:20] it's almost as if it's just our first
[24:22] nature to do it wrong
[24:24] can i get a witness where's my hammond
[24:27] b3 getting on those flats and miners
[24:29] right when you hit that right
[24:32] it's really really really easy for us to
[24:34] do it wrong
[24:36] it just because it's first nature to get
[24:38] it wrong as i mentioned before i
[24:40] lord dealt with my heart and i preached
[24:42] a sermon on the seven bad habits of a
[24:44] highly ineffective father
[24:47] because i couldn't preach on the seven
[24:49] good habits of a highly effective father
[24:51] and i'm riffing on the seven habits of
[24:52] highly effective people
[24:54] and and i just realized hey i can
[24:56] definitely share all the things i've
[24:58] done wrong
[24:59] and maybe someone can learn from my
[25:01] mistakes it's just
[25:03] by nature being human and the nurture
[25:04] that we receive and
[25:06] that we find that it's easy to create
[25:08] the wrong atmosphere it's very easy to
[25:09] create the wrong kind of culture within
[25:11] a family
[25:11] and a church and if we if we promote the
[25:15] wrong kind of dynamics if we discourage
[25:17] the wrong things and encourage the wrong
[25:19] things or discourage the right things
[25:21] and encourage the wrong things
[25:23] we can quickly create a culture which is
[25:25] more fear-based
[25:27] which produces shame and is more
[25:29] characterized as something that's not
[25:31] building faith in grace
[25:34] but more shame and submission uh through
[25:36] fear
[25:38] think about that very deeply now
[25:40] personally let it be applied to your
[25:41] life
[25:42] that we can create a culture a
[25:44] fear-based
[25:45] leadership and instruction that produces
[25:48] conduct because of shame
[25:49] instead of promoting faith that produces
[25:51] conduct out of grace
[25:54] and i don't want to get lost in this but
[25:57] how many of you here have ever heard of
[25:59] cancel culture
[26:03] it's something that's very uh you know
[26:06] it gets a lot of buzz and a lot of
[26:08] headlines
[26:10] and it's it's really interesting because
[26:13] there is definitely a culture now to
[26:15] where things
[26:16] can swell up and if somebody does
[26:18] something wrong or an entity does
[26:19] something wrong
[26:20] something it whether it be an individual
[26:22] or corporation
[26:24] they they end up on the wrong side of an
[26:26] issue through something they've said or
[26:28] done
[26:29] then there can be a public uh up uh
[26:32] upheaval which says then we need to
[26:35] cancel that person they need to lose
[26:36] their job they need to lose their
[26:38] social media account whatever it is and
[26:40] there's a cancer culture
[26:42] that erupts and then there's there's a
[26:44] big huge upswell
[26:45] against cancer cancer culture and while
[26:48] cancer culture is wrong
[26:50] and because you cancelled this we're
[26:51] going to cancel you and everyone just
[26:53] pulls their guns and their swords and
[26:55] everyone's aiming at each other and you
[26:56] realize
[26:56] really nobody here's not wanting to
[26:58] cancel
[27:00] right they're all wanting to cancel they
[27:01] just want the ones they want canceled
[27:03] and the ones they don't want cancel
[27:04] never pick sides
[27:05] and it really has become everyone is
[27:08] part of this canceled culture
[27:11] and it's a culture which is successful
[27:13] if your cancer culture what you want to
[27:15] produce is canceling
[27:17] and the way that they achieve canceling
[27:19] is through fear and intimidation
[27:22] now when i think about this we're
[27:24] talking about
[27:25] wisdom the meekness of wisdom
[27:29] the context of it within family and how
[27:31] the meekness and gentleness of christ
[27:33] exemplifies
[27:35] the kind of nature that we should have
[27:36] in order to learn and the kind of nature
[27:38] that we should have in order to lead in
[27:40] order to teach
[27:41] so if you don't have this kind of nature
[27:43] you really not we will not be learning
[27:45] if you don't have that kind of nature
[27:46] you will not be able to teach
[27:48] so i haven't left that subject we're
[27:50] living in a time in a society now where
[27:52] cancer culture
[27:53] and this culture of fear and
[27:54] intimidation uses force uses threat
[27:56] uses coercion to abuse and dominate
[28:00] and it does it to dominate beliefs and
[28:03] coerce beliefs and
[28:04] and use a force to affect actions and
[28:06] it's actually a
[28:07] method to alter someone's behavior and
[28:10] to alter someone's beliefs
[28:12] if you don't change the way you believe
[28:13] we're going to cancel you if you if you
[28:16] act that way we're gonna we're trying to
[28:17] moderate behavior get you to change your
[28:19] behavior get to you to change your
[28:21] policy
[28:21] through the threat of being canceled and
[28:23] it's effective because people will
[28:25] change their policy
[28:26] change their behavior change their
[28:28] interactions change their beliefs
[28:30] all because of the threat of
[28:31] intimidation and force
[28:34] and so you achieve the result but let me
[28:36] ask you this is that the wisdom that's
[28:38] from above
[28:40] is this is this an up this is this
[28:43] something that's
[28:43] arising from real godly character and
[28:45] wisdom or is this something that really
[28:47] is
[28:48] devilish and sensual and from beneath
[28:51] i was going to take time i've run out of
[28:53] time already tonight to
[28:54] maybe amplify the terms bully and
[28:56] bullying a little bit or the noun and
[28:58] even the verb but i'll just skip past
[29:00] that
[29:00] we can visit it some other time but
[29:02] think about the methods that are used in
[29:04] society today
[29:06] to change someone's conduct
[29:09] and then be very honest with yourself
[29:11] whether or not on some
[29:12] level we're not guilty of the same
[29:15] within families or within other dynamics
[29:18] we may not have the ability to get 35
[29:20] million followers to cancel somebody we
[29:22] may not have the ability to reach
[29:23] through social media and through
[29:25] and through political pressure alter the
[29:27] course of a of an
[29:29] actor or a politician or a corporation
[29:31] but think about your sphere of influence
[29:33] and those within your families and your
[29:35] relationships and the kind of
[29:36] environment
[29:37] that we can create within a church and
[29:38] challenge us do we have in some ways
[29:40] some vintage canceled culture
[29:42] as a part of our mechanisms
[29:46] it's only recently received this name
[29:50] cancel culture but was there a way that
[29:52] we could ostracize belittle
[29:55] and cut out people in a ways of
[29:57] canceling them
[29:59] long before it ever became a buzzword
[30:05] a few years ago i may have not have even
[30:08] been that long but i do think it's a few
[30:09] years ago there was a reckoning as it
[30:11] were i could just use that phrase within
[30:13] the southern baptist
[30:14] convention and even among independent
[30:16] baptist churches
[30:17] where there were numerous if not there
[30:20] was dozens of instances that begin to
[30:22] become
[30:22] become uncovered and complaints that
[30:24] begin to get uh
[30:25] major attention and where i was living
[30:28] at the time in fort worth
[30:30] there was uh it began there was like a
[30:32] uh an expose that was being done in a
[30:35] very large
[30:36] a study that was being conducted and
[30:37] even an article that was being expressed
[30:39] in the newspaper
[30:40] and they were examining how that within
[30:43] the framework of an
[30:44] organization and a denomination the
[30:47] southern baptist and even these
[30:48] independent baptist churches
[30:50] how that there was systemic and over and
[30:52] over again there was abuse manipulation
[30:54] and illegal
[30:55] terrible terrible conduct that was never
[30:58] remedied never addressed
[30:59] never dealt with and it was allowed to
[31:01] repeat from generation to generation and
[31:04] this this
[31:04] uh this journalist was looking into it
[31:08] and i want you to hear the conclusion
[31:09] that they came to
[31:11] that allowed this kind of abusive
[31:13] manipulated destroying degrading
[31:15] perverted behavior
[31:17] to persist within a church and this is
[31:19] the phrase that they use their church
[31:21] has created
[31:22] a culture that uses fear to control
[31:25] and gives men in power the role of
[31:28] unquestioned and ultimate authority
[31:32] how is it that an abuser thrives how is
[31:34] it the wrong kind of leadership
[31:36] is able to perpetuate the wrong kind of
[31:38] leadership how do you have
[31:40] people in these roles in these
[31:41] situations and you produce an
[31:42] environment
[31:43] that is toxic how is it you have the
[31:45] wrong kind of leadership
[31:46] and the wrong kind of headship create a
[31:48] culture that uses fear
[31:51] that gives people in power the role of
[31:54] unquestioned
[31:55] and ultimate authority now we could sit
[31:58] there and go oh my yeah
[32:00] think about all those churches and think
[32:01] about those denominations and think
[32:03] about those organizations
[32:04] the dynamic can exist within your
[32:06] marriage
[32:08] it can exist within your family because
[32:11] you use your position as
[32:12] i'm the head or you use the position
[32:14] that i'm the parent
[32:15] and at no point is there ever an
[32:17] opportunity
[32:19] to reason and to explain and to work
[32:22] through different
[32:22] differences and get out of this
[32:24] mechanism of fear and control
[32:26] that gives all the power into the parent
[32:29] and the parent has this
[32:30] unquestioned ultimate authority and
[32:32] because they have it they can never be
[32:34] held accountable
[32:35] when they do make a mistake
[32:39] and let me say this that healthy
[32:40] relationships promote mutual dependency
[32:44] healthy relationships promote mutual
[32:46] accountability
[32:48] and what this with this expose that
[32:50] identified this abusive culture that was
[32:52] taking place within a religious
[32:53] organization
[32:54] and within this convention was that they
[32:56] did not have mutual dependency they had
[32:58] codependency
[32:59] they did not have mutual accountability
[33:01] they had one-way accountability where
[33:03] the person at the top could tell
[33:04] everybody else what to do
[33:06] but if they made a mistake there was no
[33:07] means by which that person
[33:09] that person at the top could be held
[33:11] accountable for abusive
[33:13] manipulative even illegal behavior
[33:17] hey we're not southern baptists can i
[33:19] get a little bit more amens there
[33:21] come on let's just be honest tonight
[33:24] so without the meekness of wisdom we can
[33:26] create the wrong kind of relationship
[33:28] dynamics
[33:30] to grow to have successful relationships
[33:33] to grow children
[33:34] to grow one another to grow in christ
[33:37] the bible says in galatians chapter six
[33:38] verse one brethren if a man be overtaken
[33:40] in a fault
[33:41] ye which are spiritual restore such a
[33:44] one
[33:44] in the spirit of meekness this is a
[33:47] necessary characteristic
[33:49] in order to teach you cannot just say
[33:51] well the bible says that i'm a teacher
[33:52] therefore i'm going to teach no you have
[33:53] to first
[33:54] have the spirit of meekness you have to
[33:57] first be
[33:57] uh clothed and arraigned in this
[34:00] meekness and this quietness of spirit
[34:02] which in the sight of god is of great
[34:03] price
[34:04] before you can assume the position of
[34:06] counselor before you can take the
[34:07] position of teacher
[34:08] and the one that's going to admonish and
[34:10] correct you must first be the one that
[34:12] takes on this robe and this cloak of the
[34:14] spirit of meekness
[34:15] if you're going to restore and recover
[34:17] somebody who's made a mistake you have
[34:18] to first be meek because you consider
[34:20] yourself this is humility this is you
[34:24] being honestly aware of your own
[34:26] mistakes and your own shortcomings
[34:28] and realizing as you reach out your hand
[34:30] to the one who's fallen thinking you
[34:31] know what this very well could have been
[34:32] me but for the grace of god
[34:35] i'd like to help you i want to help you
[34:37] because i know that if
[34:39] i've been there before i want to help
[34:41] you because i if it wasn't for the grace
[34:42] of god i'd be there right now
[34:44] and so there's this honesty you consider
[34:46] your own self less you
[34:48] should be tempted and when this with the
[34:49] spirit of meekness you can recover
[34:51] someone
[34:52] it identifies that the one who's in the
[34:54] position to lift up the one who's in the
[34:56] position to teach
[34:57] the one who's spiritual in the position
[34:58] to restore can never
[35:00] properly be effective unless they first
[35:02] have a spirit of meekness
[35:04] without meekness what does it produce it
[35:07] creates that culture of fear
[35:10] it creates a culture of silence and if
[35:12] we don't have the meekness of wisdom
[35:15] our good intentions can actually be
[35:17] spoiling
[35:19] the the object of our intentions i i'd
[35:23] like to amplify this more maybe i'll
[35:24] just give it to you food for thought
[35:27] we often admonish our children
[35:30] and i use that gracefully saying we
[35:32] admonish our children about not being
[35:34] tattletails and we do it because what we
[35:37] really want our children to do is work
[35:39] it out
[35:40] right don't come telling me
[35:43] and and to work it out don't come to me
[35:45] you guys work it out and
[35:46] if we're not careful our attitude
[35:49] towards
[35:50] tattletaling can become so caustic and
[35:52] we chide
[35:53] and berate the child for tattling that
[35:56] we do more harm to the tattler
[35:58] than we do correcting the liar
[36:02] and we actually can create a culture
[36:04] with our children to where we're
[36:05] teaching them just to keep quiet and
[36:07] then by the time they become teenagers
[36:08] and we want them to open up
[36:09] we've already fully indoctrinated them
[36:11] in the culture of just keeping your lips
[36:13] shut
[36:15] and so we have to be very careful that
[36:17] in this objective of not
[36:19] your children not always coming to you
[36:20] not always complaining and not working
[36:22] things out themselves
[36:23] that you do it in the right way to where
[36:25] you don't create a bigger problem
[36:27] then you just lose in a few minutes of
[36:29] your time to slow down and figure out
[36:30] what's taking place
[36:32] so just chew on that for a while i'm
[36:33] going to move on
[36:36] so a lot of times this the problems
[36:39] begin with shaming
[36:41] and shining in a harshness
[36:44] in matthew chapter 11 verses 28 to 30
[36:46] jesus says come unto me all ye
[36:48] that labor that means you are growing
[36:50] weary you're exhausted you're tired
[36:53] and are heavy laden you're overwhelmed
[36:55] you're overloaded with the burden
[36:57] now i want you to take this very
[36:59] personal not just one who's laden with
[37:01] sins but anyone who's growing weary and
[37:04] exhausted and
[37:05] feels like you're at your end and you're
[37:06] just overloaded and overwhelmed
[37:08] says if you'll come unto me i will give
[37:10] you rest
[37:12] take my yoke upon you and learn of
[37:15] me you that are over taxed you're
[37:19] growing weary you're overwhelmed you're
[37:21] tired you're
[37:22] exhausted in your calling in your labor
[37:24] as a housewife in your labor as a wife
[37:26] as a mother in your labor as a husband
[37:28] and a provider in your labor
[37:30] wherever you are in the economy of god
[37:32] i'm growing weary i'm going to exhaust
[37:34] them growing tired i feel like i'm
[37:35] headed for a breakdown
[37:36] i'm feeling overwhelmed he says learn of
[37:38] me learn my example for i
[37:40] am meek and lowly in heart
[37:43] here's your invitation i am meek and
[37:44] lonely and you shall find rest
[37:46] unto your souls if you could learn the
[37:48] meekness if you can learn the lowliness
[37:50] then you'll find rest in your souls for
[37:51] my yoke is easy and my burden is light
[37:54] this is an invitation if marriage of
[37:58] child rearing
[37:59] has become full of envy full of strife
[38:01] full of discontent
[38:02] you're becoming overwhelmed you're
[38:04] feeling over text
[38:07] i take that as a as a a just a
[38:11] a wave a hot blast okay all right we're
[38:13] awake now
[38:15] if there's any part in your life where
[38:17] you're feeling overwhelmed feeling weary
[38:19] and well doing
[38:20] you feel like they're strained you feel
[38:21] like they're strife you feel like
[38:22] something is not quite working
[38:24] here's your invitation to rest
[38:27] from that it is to learn of me for i am
[38:30] meek
[38:31] and lowly in heart my meekness and my
[38:34] lowliness is the relief and is the rest
[38:36] from the strife
[38:37] my meekness and my loneliness is your
[38:39] relief from the overwhelming burden that
[38:41] you're experiencing
[38:42] in your calling listen the answer is say
[38:45] well i'm just stressed as a husband i'm
[38:47] just stressed as a father
[38:49] i guess i'm not just cut out for it i
[38:50] guess i'm just not i just should have
[38:52] never done it and i feel like i'm a
[38:54] failure i need to figure out my way out
[38:55] of it no
[38:55] no no you're in it god called you to it
[38:58] you've got the ability to do it but
[38:59] there's just
[39:00] other things that are out front as i was
[39:03] pondering i took i took the scripture
[39:04] references out of my notes
[39:06] because i i i just didn't want to get
[39:08] too caught up in this
[39:09] in this direction but peter's
[39:11] admonishing the women i said
[39:13] don't dress up with all the plaiting all
[39:15] the brai the braiding and the jewelry
[39:17] and all the fancy things
[39:18] he says but let it be the quiet man the
[39:20] inside man of the heart
[39:22] in meekness and quietness with those
[39:24] things before god were of great price
[39:27] and if you think about it what he's
[39:28] dealing with isn't
[39:30] just what's on the outside but it's a
[39:33] problem with
[39:34] the attitude that i'm going to put a lot
[39:36] of stuff out front
[39:38] i want to appear very beautiful and i
[39:40] want to appear very put together and i
[39:41] want to feel
[39:42] appear very well mannered but yet down
[39:44] on the inside
[39:45] if there's no meekness and quietness if
[39:47] there's no real godliness in the real
[39:48] temperament of a daughter of christ
[39:50] then everything that's out front is not
[39:51] going to do you any good
[39:53] and so in this in this uh this point
[39:56] of how christ is actually giving us an
[39:58] invitation
[39:59] for rest and for security and for
[40:02] assurance in our calling
[40:04] all these things that you're frustrated
[40:05] with you're overwhelmed and you're taxed
[40:07] with
[40:07] if you can just let all the strife and
[40:09] the overwhelming burden
[40:11] of fulfilling your duty as a spouse or
[40:13] as a parent
[40:14] or as a brother or sister in christ paul
[40:17] says in first corinthians chapter 4
[40:18] verse 21 what will ye
[40:20] shall i come unto you with a rod or
[40:24] in love and in the spirit of meekness
[40:26] what would you want a parent to do
[40:29] should we have the children vote you
[40:32] wanted to come with the wooden spoon
[40:33] with the switch the belt what would you
[40:35] want them to do come with the rod
[40:36] or come in love and in the spirit of
[40:38] meekness
[40:40] the correction of christ is in love and
[40:42] meekness
[40:45] we could read this what shall i come to
[40:46] you with the rod or in love and in the
[40:48] spirit of meekness this is how we can
[40:50] make the word fight against word well
[40:52] the bible says spare the rod spoil the
[40:54] child but you know it doesn't say use
[40:55] the rod and you
[40:56] you won't spoil them it's just a
[40:59] guarantee if you spare it
[41:01] you'll spoil them but if you use it
[41:03] incorrectly you'll spoil them just the
[41:04] same
[41:06] did you catch that we've justified the
[41:08] use of a rod by saying well if i use it
[41:10] i won't spoil them no but if you use it
[41:12] wrong you're spoiling them just the same
[41:14] in some instances you'd be better off
[41:16] sparing it
[41:17] then using it anger and animosity and a
[41:20] harshness
[41:21] because you create a greater perversion
[41:23] of correction
[41:24] and drive a greater wedge between truth
[41:28] and air and brightness and their hearts
[41:30] than if you just would have spared it
[41:32] you just want to let it go and this is
[41:35] exactly what paul is saying you want me
[41:36] to come with you a rod just a rod only
[41:38] if you spare the rod you spoil the child
[41:40] would you want me to come in correction
[41:42] which is in love and in the spirit of
[41:44] meekness
[41:45] our love even if you say well love is
[41:47] corrective should always manifest itself
[41:49] in grace and patience
[41:52] always manifest itself in grace and
[41:55] patience
[41:57] meekness is necessary for leadership the
[42:00] correction of christ is in love
[42:02] and in the spirit of meekness paul says
[42:04] i beseech you by
[42:06] the meekness and gentleness of christ
[42:08] it's because he told him beforehand
[42:10] do you want me to just come real hard
[42:11] and real angry and real firm and with
[42:12] the word of god this is what the word
[42:14] says
[42:14] this is what the word says have you ever
[42:17] been met with a
[42:18] with a with uh expressed your heart to
[42:21] someone says
[42:21] well did you was that were you talking
[42:24] about me and were you preaching against
[42:25] me and
[42:26] and were you saying that about me well
[42:28] it was the word wasn't it you're like
[42:30] well that wasn't the part that i was
[42:31] really bothered by i was just
[42:33] bothered by the fact that i shared it
[42:35] with you in confidence
[42:36] and now you just embarrassed me and
[42:38] berated me and abused me in front of all
[42:40] the people and
[42:41] i'm just trying to find some way to
[42:42] reason with you and what do they stand
[42:44] behind well it's the truth isn't it
[42:47] but it's not in the spirit of meekness
[42:50] and meekness is necessary for leadership
[42:54] as parents if truth is on our side then
[42:57] let
[42:57] meekness be our method and not force
[43:01] in our relationships meekness is
[43:03] necessary for leadership
[43:06] meekness is necessary for discipling
[43:10] we're real big on disciplining but
[43:13] really our goal is discipline
[43:15] in other words we want we want them to
[43:17] be followers of christ
[43:18] or followers of our good example
[43:21] that's what we're looking for in
[43:22] leadership with our children
[43:25] and if we do not have meekness and it
[43:28] stands in contrast to these different
[43:29] things that paul is talking about
[43:36] then we we impart we impart our
[43:40] instruction with the wrong motive
[43:43] and i want to think of a real succinct
[43:44] way to say this we're at 46 minutes
[43:47] just over 46 minutes already we should
[43:50] never correct and we should never
[43:53] instruct
[43:54] for advantage or for our own reputation
[44:00] this is not our goal our goal is not to
[44:03] produce children that make us look good
[44:05] our goal is to not be
[44:06] sheep in church that make arizona
[44:08] believers church look good no we just
[44:09] want to be pleasing to god
[44:12] we want to live lives that are
[44:13] overcoming we want the lord to be
[44:15] looking down upon us
[44:16] with favor that we're because it's the
[44:17] life lived well by the word
[44:19] and so our goal is not just to look good
[44:21] and remember the no
[44:23] filter concept that we shared with you
[44:25] we should never correct we should never
[44:26] instruct
[44:27] for our own advantage for our own gain
[44:30] or for our own reputation
[44:32] because selfish instruction will never
[44:34] edify
[44:36] and prideful correction is never
[44:38] remedial
[44:40] no it's never for healing it's never to
[44:42] promote correct behavior
[44:43] if you're just teaching somebody and
[44:45] instructing somebody
[44:46] for your own selfish gain then you're
[44:48] not really edifying them
[44:50] you're just manipulating them to do
[44:51] things for your benefit and make you
[44:52] look good
[44:53] now we're going to go into this
[44:54] restaurant you're going to sit still and
[44:56] if until you if you
[44:57] if i just even say one peep and if you
[44:59] act like this and you do this and you do
[45:01] that
[45:02] you know you right
[45:06] and what are we worried about making us
[45:08] look foolish as parents and making us
[45:10] look bad as parents
[45:11] and we're really instructing them in
[45:12] correct behavior but overall
[45:14] you know how bad that makes us look when
[45:16] you do that
[45:18] wrong method
[45:21] your goal shouldn't be to look good as a
[45:22] parent your goal should just to promote
[45:24] the virtues in your child
[45:26] promote the right kind so selfless
[45:27] instruction is not building up and
[45:29] edifying the child
[45:30] prideful correction where you discipline
[45:32] and correct because of a pride
[45:34] is not does not rehabilitate and
[45:37] administer and minister health to the
[45:39] child who's wrong
[45:40] it's actually destructive you're not
[45:42] building you're destroying
[45:45] that's why i would call it maybe
[45:47] discipline as opposed to disciplining
[45:48] you you spare the rod you spoil the
[45:50] child and we discipline we discipline
[45:51] we inflict pain we want them to feel it
[45:53] but really if you discipline out of
[45:54] anger
[45:56] if you if you discipline out of pride it
[45:58] makes the instruction whether you're
[46:00] trying to teach instruct someone or
[46:01] whether you're trying to correct someone
[46:02] it makes the whole goal it makes the
[46:05] result more punishment and punitive
[46:08] it's inflicting pain it's more
[46:10] retribution
[46:13] and so our leadership our efforts to try
[46:15] to work something out in a marriage our
[46:16] efforts
[46:17] in headship our efforts as parents if
[46:18] it's born out of frustration
[46:20] if it's born out of anger even in the
[46:22] moment that we instruct the moment that
[46:24] we discipline
[46:24] if there's hurt if there's anger if
[46:26] there's frustration if there's something
[46:28] bullying over the only thing you're
[46:29] going to impart
[46:31] in this instruction and correction is
[46:33] the same amount of frustration
[46:35] anger and and bitterness in the heart of
[46:37] the child
[46:40] or of the follower it's it's a lesson
[46:44] in ministry that if you're upset and
[46:46] you're frustrated and you're angry when
[46:47] you preach guess what the people are
[46:48] going to be
[46:50] frustrated angry and upset like man why
[46:52] are they so upset why are they so
[46:53] frustrated you sowed it you sowed it
[46:56] right into their spirits
[46:57] your impatience and and your and your
[47:00] lack of temperament and your
[47:02] and your frustration and i i i about had
[47:04] it and whenever you get to that boiling
[47:06] point
[47:06] and it's from that overwhelming sense of
[47:09] i'm weary i'm tired i'm exhausted
[47:11] and you you correct or you discipline
[47:13] out of that hurt you're only provoking
[47:15] that in the child
[47:18] it's sewn into it does that is that
[47:22] making sense
[47:24] to to anyone here brother brown makes
[47:27] this statement those chosen ones born of
[47:29] a spirit
[47:30] will be trained to conform to his image
[47:33] in their walk here's the example of
[47:35] christ the meekness and gentleness of
[47:36] christ
[47:36] the one that were to make our example
[47:38] who overcame by the word and humility
[47:40] who learned obedience who subjected
[47:41] himself to his parents who increased in
[47:43] wisdom
[47:43] the one who had the meekness and
[47:45] gentleness the one by which paul
[47:47] beseeched them with the the meekness of
[47:49] christ
[47:51] and the spirit of meekness and i beseech
[47:52] you it says he
[47:55] will train us he will guide us
[47:58] we will be trained by his spirit born of
[48:00] his spirit will be trained
[48:02] to be conformed will be trained to
[48:03] conform to his image in their walk
[48:05] he reproves he corrects he instructs
[48:07] with all
[48:08] longsuffering and gentleness and mercy
[48:12] this is god's way god's way is grace and
[48:16] patience not law and punishment
[48:20] these are the hallmarks of proper
[48:21] leadership these these are the hallmarks
[48:23] of discipline
[48:23] these are the hallmarks of discipline
[48:25] these are the hallmarks of a parent who
[48:27] has an interest in their child
[48:28] to promote the right kind of virtue and
[48:30] see that it's character
[48:31] uh being developed not complex is god's
[48:34] way
[48:35] hebrew proves with all longsuffering and
[48:37] gentleness and mercy not rigidity not
[48:38] harshness not even consistency
[48:40] god's way is grace and patience not law
[48:44] and punishment
[48:46] that's god's way of training his
[48:48] children to be conformed to his image
[48:50] and their walk
[48:54] it says in psalms 25 verse 9 the meek
[48:56] will he guide in judgment
[48:59] and the meek will he teach his way he is
[49:02] meek
[49:04] so he will teach he will guide and he
[49:06] will teach he is make so he guides and
[49:08] teaches in meekness
[49:09] remember this is the this is the
[49:11] character we the the meekness and
[49:13] gentleness of christ the spirit of
[49:15] meekness the word and humility
[49:16] is an essential attribute to the guide
[49:19] to the teacher to the one who's leading
[49:20] to the great shepherd
[49:22] and who is he also likewise going to
[49:24] lead he's mixed with guides and teaches
[49:26] and meekness
[49:27] and so to learn we must also be meek
[49:30] the meek will he guide in judgment the
[49:32] meek will he teach his way
[49:34] so yes it's instructive to us to where
[49:37] we likewise must
[49:38] have the spirit of meekness in order to
[49:40] receive instruction
[49:41] in order to receive correction but if
[49:43] we're going to cultivate that and the
[49:44] ones that we're teaching
[49:46] our instruction and our correction must
[49:48] also be in the spirit of meekness
[49:51] don't come on real strong in the spirit
[49:52] of harshness and expect an
[49:54] eight-year-old to come back in a spirit
[49:55] of meekness
[49:59] in james chapter 1 verse 21 wherefore
[50:00] lay apart all filthiness this is
[50:02] dishonor vileness
[50:04] he's talking about the state of mind
[50:05] which hinders our subjection to the word
[50:08] lay apart all filthiness and
[50:09] superfluidity of nodding nottingham say
[50:11] that fast five times
[50:12] that fast that fast that fast it's super
[50:15] super fluidity of naughtiness it means
[50:17] the superiority or the preeminence of
[50:19] evil it speaks of allowing malice to
[50:21] have the premise lay aside that and
[50:23] receive with meekness
[50:25] the engrafted word which is able to save
[50:27] your souls
[50:28] this is how we find rest in our souls
[50:30] all by the word and humility receive
[50:32] with meekness
[50:33] not with not being defensive not being
[50:35] self-justified receive with meekness the
[50:37] engrafted word which is able to save
[50:39] your souls
[50:40] this is how we receive the word and if
[50:42] we're going to receive the word and
[50:43] meekness we must know that it must
[50:45] likewise be
[50:46] it's being sowed in meekness
[50:52] receive the word with the humble spirit
[50:55] and it being rooted in your heart it
[50:56] produces
[50:57] it produces the rest to your souls it
[50:59] produces peace it produces the
[51:01] deliverance in your souls
[51:04] in james chapter 3 verses 13 to 18. i'm
[51:08] going to read through it verses 13 to 18
[51:13] and then we'll back up to some of these
[51:14] words who is the wise man and a dude
[51:17] with knowledge among you
[51:18] let him show out of a good conversation
[51:20] his works with maintenance of wisdom
[51:22] but if you have bitter envy and strife
[51:24] in your heart glory not be honest with
[51:26] yourselves don't resist the truth
[51:28] and and lie not against the truth this
[51:30] wisdom descendeth not from above but is
[51:32] earthly
[51:33] sensual devilish this is this is how it
[51:38] is characterized
[51:39] if there's a wise man and dude with
[51:40] knowledge then he's going to exhibit his
[51:42] wisdom with meekness
[51:44] but if there's envy and strife if
[51:45] there's conflict if there's jealousy
[51:47] if there's manipulation or abuse this
[51:49] kind of wisdom is from beneath because
[51:50] it's earthly
[51:51] sensual devilish where envy and strife
[51:54] is there's confusion in every evil work
[51:57] so now he wants to amplify the meekness
[51:59] of wisdom give it some flesh give it
[52:01] some fruit give it to some
[52:02] characteristics so that we can identify
[52:04] but the wisdom that is from above is
[52:06] first pure
[52:08] then peaceable gentle
[52:11] and easy to be entreated full of mercy
[52:14] and good fruits without partiality and
[52:16] without hypocrisy
[52:18] and the fruit of righteousness is sown
[52:20] in peace of them that make peace notice
[52:21] how he describes us the wisdom that is
[52:23] from above is first pure then peaceable
[52:26] gentle and easy to be entreated full of
[52:28] mercy and good fruits
[52:29] without partiality and without hypocrisy
[52:31] we ought to
[52:32] every single one of us try this code on
[52:35] and see if it fits
[52:37] we there there's no one here our
[52:39] challenge is from the youngest to the
[52:40] oldest
[52:41] who's going to say nope i'm exempt from
[52:42] that i can conduct myself however i want
[52:45] contrary to those attributes
[52:47] because i'm not a teacher i'm not this
[52:49] i'm not that no this is the attributes
[52:51] and characteristics of the meekness of
[52:53] christ
[52:53] which as new creatures in christ we're
[52:55] to put on
[52:57] these are attributes and characteristics
[52:59] against which there is no law
[53:01] these are the fruits of the spirit let
[53:03] it be a wisdom that exhibits itself
[53:06] in these things because notice verse 18
[53:08] and the fruit of righteousness
[53:10] is sown in peace of them that make
[53:13] peace this is such a beautiful beautiful
[53:16] statement it's such a vast vast
[53:18] expansive proposition
[53:19] such a beautiful beautiful foundation
[53:21] and itself a great covering and an
[53:23] umbrella of truth and the fruit of
[53:25] righteousness is sown in peace of them
[53:27] that make peace
[53:29] mature fruit since it's the fruit of
[53:30] righteousness the fruit of proper
[53:32] judgment mature fruit
[53:34] if you have the right kind of fruit the
[53:35] fruit of wisdom the fruit of discernment
[53:37] the fruit of righteousness
[53:38] is first planted in peace by those who
[53:42] seek peace
[53:45] if you're going to see ever going to see
[53:48] fruits of wisdom then wisdom is first
[53:51] sown
[53:52] in peace by those who are seeking growth
[53:54] and wanting to promote growth
[53:57] the word is sown in meekness
[54:02] the proper fruit is not the the product
[54:05] of seeking to divide or promoting strife
[54:09] tearing down or causing shame as he's
[54:11] talking about this
[54:12] envy and bitter envy and strife in your
[54:13] hearts this is this is kind of the
[54:15] contrast to it the fruit of
[54:16] righteousness
[54:17] is sown in peace of them that make peace
[54:19] those that sold the word in a particular
[54:22] way those that sow it in wisdom
[54:24] will see the fruits of wisdom but if you
[54:26] have the word seed and you don't sow it
[54:28] in wisdom
[54:29] then don't expect to see the fruits of
[54:31] righteousness
[54:32] the harvest of righteousness read it
[54:34] this way or the harvest of create
[54:36] correct behavior is planted by those who
[54:39] act patiently and act gracefully
[54:43] you can you could just read it exactly
[54:45] that way the fruit of wisdom the fruit
[54:47] of wisdom is going to be song first
[54:48] in peace by them that make peace if you
[54:51] want to see correct behavior
[54:52] then plant the truth by acting patiently
[54:56] and acting gracefully let me try to
[54:59] bring this to a head
[55:00] you want to you want to see change do
[55:03] you want to see change in your personal
[55:04] life you want to see change in your
[55:05] marriages you want to see change in your
[55:06] family
[55:07] if you want to see change then get
[55:08] beneath and live above
[55:13] show grace and patience let those become
[55:15] the dominant characteristics
[55:17] of your personality of your character of
[55:19] the way that you address the situation
[55:21] not confronting it through just clear
[55:24] adherence and strict adherence to the
[55:26] word
[55:26] this is the hierarchy this is the
[55:28] structure this is the way things are
[55:29] supposed to be and you just need to do
[55:31] it this way and you just need to do it
[55:32] the way i say
[55:33] and if everyone could just get in line
[55:34] and get in step then everybody's going
[55:36] to be happy
[55:37] and this is the way that it ought to be
[55:38] but take a moment to take a step back
[55:40] take a deep breath
[55:41] breathe out exhale get some distance
[55:44] take a moment calm down relax and say
[55:46] wait a minute things need to change
[55:50] and it's ever going to change it's not
[55:51] going to change by me becoming more
[55:52] stubborn and more bullhead and more
[55:54] obstinate
[55:56] but it's only going to change if i
[55:57] exhibit grace and patience
[56:00] even consider family relationships this
[56:03] is the context of even what we're
[56:04] speaking about wisdom it's in the
[56:05] context of family
[56:08] what's the secret of success it's not
[56:11] force
[56:14] it never has been for us you have never
[56:17] been successful with your children
[56:19] by force now you may achieve the
[56:21] appearance
[56:22] of of adherence but where's their heart
[56:27] where's the security
[56:30] the secret of success is wisdom
[56:33] wisdom from above not force look at
[56:36] these characteristics we're right almost
[56:38] exactly at an
[56:39] hour wisdom from above the bible says is
[56:42] meek
[56:42] it's the meekness of wisdom and the
[56:45] meekness is with wisdom is known by
[56:46] these characteristics i'll just go
[56:48] through them
[56:49] and try to do it very quickly it's first
[56:51] pure
[56:53] it's clear it inspires reverence we
[56:56] saying i stand in all of you
[56:58] the wisdom from above inspires reverence
[57:04] if we can impart wisdom in the spirit of
[57:07] meekness or in the maintenance of wisdom
[57:09] it's clear
[57:10] and it inspires a reverence for it to
[57:12] say that it's pure it's free from
[57:13] carnality it is not earthly it is not
[57:16] sensual it is not devilish
[57:18] wisdom from above is modest and clean
[57:22] and and you can say in some ways the
[57:23] next seven attributes that are expressed
[57:25] are kind of amplifying what it means to
[57:27] be pure
[57:27] because there's nothing no hidden motive
[57:29] in it
[57:31] it's pure then peaceable it means it
[57:34] promotes peace
[57:36] it desires peace itself it desires
[57:39] accord it desires agreement
[57:41] and because it desires agreement it's
[57:43] personally willing to sacrifice for it
[57:47] it doesn't take these platitudes and
[57:49] these positions and and these
[57:51] unassailable
[57:52] propositions well this is the way that
[57:53] it has to be but it's peaceable so
[57:55] wisdom from above promotes peace
[57:58] it's pure it's peaceable then gentle
[58:00] it's modest
[58:01] it's gentle wisdom from above is gentle
[58:04] it makes
[58:05] a person patient and understanding if
[58:08] you have
[58:08] wisdom from above it makes you gentle
[58:11] it's not rigid it's not harsh it's not
[58:13] unbending
[58:14] if you have wisdom from above it's pure
[58:16] peaceable and modest
[58:17] it makes a person who has it very
[58:19] patient because they know
[58:21] this is what works
[58:24] this one wow is this one heavy easy to
[58:27] be entreated
[58:28] that doesn't mean easy to receive treats
[58:31] but easy to be entreated means they're
[58:33] willing to listen if you're easy to be
[58:36] entreated you're will you're not
[58:38] stubborn
[58:38] and sp if you're easy to be treated you
[58:40] don't sour quickly
[58:42] when someone says well but
[58:45] or i noticed this and i i was wondering
[58:48] that the easy to be entreated means you
[58:50] can ask them a question
[58:53] and they won't fly off the handle and
[58:54] immediately accuse you of unbelief or
[58:56] some sort of
[58:57] accusation or are you questioning my
[59:01] authority as your parent
[59:03] no they're just asking a question wisdom
[59:06] which is from above is willing to listen
[59:07] it's not stubborn nor is it sour
[59:10] wisdom which is from above is a good
[59:12] listener
[59:13] and being able to listen it's responsive
[59:18] he ever had that boss that they had to
[59:21] come to it on their own you could never
[59:23] tell them something was wrong
[59:25] because if you did they would take it
[59:26] the wrong way and you'd be in hot water
[59:29] so you kind of had to just find the most
[59:31] creative way
[59:33] to make sure that the idea was theirs
[59:35] not your own
[59:36] right they had to come to the conclusion
[59:39] themselves that one plus one equals two
[59:40] you couldn't tell them otherwise
[59:42] they would deny to their death at one
[59:44] plus one equals two
[59:46] that's not easy to be entreated someone
[59:49] who's easy to be entreated would listen
[59:50] to someone who tries to explain to them
[59:52] why they see it a certain way
[59:53] they and in listening they can be
[59:55] responsive to that person why
[59:56] because they're not stubborn or easily
[59:58] soured they're full of mercy
[1:00:00] pure peaceable gentle easy to be
[1:00:01] entreated full of mercy quick to forgive
[1:00:05] and they act kindly they exhibit
[1:00:08] compassion to the one that they're
[1:00:10] hearing the one that they're instructing
[1:00:11] the one that they're disciplining
[1:00:12] they're quick to forgive they act kindly
[1:00:15] they're willing to relieve the one who's
[1:00:17] burdened who's wrong who's being taught
[1:00:20] so they're full of mercy to say that
[1:00:22] they're full of fruits could
[1:00:24] imply that they're full of the fruits of
[1:00:25] purity peacefulness gentleness
[1:00:27] easy to be entreated full of mercy each
[1:00:29] of these dispositions is therefore
[1:00:30] manifested and produced in
[1:00:32] action and conduct they're full of good
[1:00:34] fruits
[1:00:36] and this is what they're not without
[1:00:38] partiality it's not self-righteous
[1:00:40] it's not influenced by self-interest and
[1:00:43] it's willing to give what is due
[1:00:46] it's willing to praise it's willing to
[1:00:49] encourage
[1:00:50] it's willing to give credit it's willing
[1:00:51] to say you know what you saw that when i
[1:00:53] didn't
[1:00:54] way to go that's a great job you're
[1:00:56] right
[1:00:57] i i just in a moment of honesty stop the
[1:00:59] tape i'm getting ready to bear my soul
[1:01:02] one thing this is me personally and now
[1:01:03] i can be held accountable this is for
[1:01:04] the first time i don't know if i've ever
[1:01:06] said this in my life
[1:01:07] oh this is gonna get good
[1:01:10] in my nature if i'm like hey i want to
[1:01:13] take out the trash
[1:01:14] i'm going to take out the trash you know
[1:01:16] what absolutely spoils it for me
[1:01:20] to be told to take out the trash oh my
[1:01:23] god
[1:01:24] i was going to do it i was going to take
[1:01:26] out the trash but they're literally you
[1:01:27] asked me to do it that just ruined it
[1:01:30] it's my pride it's absolutely
[1:01:34] 100 totally 1 000 every single bit of it
[1:01:38] don't blame god at all it's 100 aaron
[1:01:42] mcgeary
[1:01:43] it's the irish of me happy saint patty's
[1:01:45] day
[1:01:47] it's a beautiful cake thank you
[1:01:51] it is uh it is all in my flesh and what
[1:01:53] is it
[1:01:54] i don't like the fact that i was asked
[1:01:56] to do it because i was just
[1:01:58] wanting to do it and if anything it's
[1:02:01] kind of the opposite
[1:02:02] of this without partiality that if
[1:02:05] somebody does a good job
[1:02:08] thank him for it praise him for it
[1:02:13] if you're if your kid cleans his room on
[1:02:15] his own don't say about time buddy what
[1:02:17] is it you want huh
[1:02:20] what do you come what do you want this
[1:02:21] time that there's something about being
[1:02:23] able to recognize something
[1:02:25] and give someone their due without
[1:02:26] hypocrisy
[1:02:28] i feel so much lighter now thank you for
[1:02:31] let me bear my soul without hypocrisy
[1:02:36] it's not self-serving it's without guile
[1:02:39] without hypocrisy it seeks nothing but
[1:02:42] god's glory and your benefit
[1:02:47] now if you saw that kind of wisdom
[1:02:50] couldn't you just really lean into that
[1:02:52] and trust that
[1:02:54] couldn't you just say you know what this
[1:02:56] is pure
[1:02:57] this is peaceable the gentleness to it's
[1:03:00] easy to be entreated if i don't
[1:03:01] understand
[1:03:02] it there's a there's a way that a conver
[1:03:04] conversation can unfold there's a way
[1:03:05] that i can express myself they're full
[1:03:07] of mercy good fruits without partiality
[1:03:08] without hypocrisy
[1:03:09] that's something that we can benefit
[1:03:14] from
[1:03:16] in colossians chapter 3
[1:03:19] verses 12 to 17.
[1:03:26] read it when you get home colossians
[1:03:28] chapter 3 verses 12 to 17
[1:03:31] but it tells us as the elect of god holy
[1:03:33] and beloved put on
[1:03:37] bows of mercy kindness humbleness of
[1:03:39] mind meekness and longsuffering
[1:03:42] and let the word of christ verse 16
[1:03:44] dwell in you richly
[1:03:45] in all wisdom teaching
[1:03:48] and admonishing what's the
[1:03:52] as the elect of god we must have these
[1:03:55] at our disposal as the holy and beloved
[1:03:58] we have at our disposal to put on bows
[1:04:00] of mercy kindness humbleness of mind
[1:04:02] meekness and long-suffering
[1:04:04] and that's the result of the word of
[1:04:06] christ dwelling in you richly in all
[1:04:07] wisdom
[1:04:08] and that's what gives you the capacity
[1:04:10] to teach and admonish and it says
[1:04:11] singing with
[1:04:12] grace in your hearts to the lord
[1:04:16] this is the example that christ is to us
[1:04:19] this is the example that we should be to
[1:04:21] others i've run out of time to amplify
[1:04:24] these verses
[1:04:24] so we'll move on from them but this is
[1:04:27] the example that christ
[1:04:28] is to us this is the example that we
[1:04:30] ought to be to others
[1:04:32] this is the behavior modeling we
[1:04:34] referred to
[1:04:35] these are the things in james chapter 3
[1:04:37] verses 17 and 18 in colossians chapter 3
[1:04:39] verses 12 to 17
[1:04:41] if these are the things that we could
[1:04:43] seek and we could have in our own
[1:04:44] personal lives
[1:04:45] this is the wisdom from above that's
[1:04:47] going to be effective in family
[1:04:51] i had an exchange with someone here just
[1:04:54] this week and they expressed something
[1:04:55] to me in a text message
[1:04:56] i'm going to read it to you and i got
[1:04:58] permission to do it they said i have
[1:05:00] never gotten anyone's attention by
[1:05:02] talking about the word
[1:05:03] unless of course they were looking for
[1:05:05] an argument but when i just live the
[1:05:07] word i'm amazed at how the people that
[1:05:10] need it the most
[1:05:11] pick up on it immediately and it struck
[1:05:14] me and i just felt compelled to share it
[1:05:16] here at the end of the service as they
[1:05:18] express it you know i've never really
[1:05:20] been effective or gotten anyone's
[1:05:21] intention in just talking about the word
[1:05:23] unless they're looking for a fight start
[1:05:25] talking about something they want to
[1:05:26] debate they want to argue they want to
[1:05:28] have a different take on something then
[1:05:29] i get their attention
[1:05:30] but when i live the word the one who
[1:05:32] needs it senses it and picks up on it
[1:05:34] and is benefited by it
[1:05:36] now think about that principle for a
[1:05:38] moment then just talking about it
[1:05:41] it's not very effective but when you can
[1:05:43] live it
[1:05:44] those that need it can sense it and
[1:05:47] benefit from it
[1:05:49] and this is especially true when it
[1:05:51] relates to those to whom you have a duty
[1:05:55] if if you would just simply live the
[1:05:57] word in front of somebody else that you
[1:05:58] don't necessarily have a duty to
[1:06:00] you're not just talking to them about
[1:06:01] the word but you're just living and
[1:06:02] somehow that gets their attention
[1:06:04] and it has a benefit or it draws them to
[1:06:06] you or as they said they pick
[1:06:08] up on it and they begin to have
[1:06:09] questions if it has that impact upon
[1:06:12] someone you you don't even owe a duty
[1:06:14] then how much more is it important that
[1:06:16] we live that way towards those
[1:06:18] that we have a duty to how much more
[1:06:21] ought to we just not
[1:06:22] talk to talk but walk the walk when it
[1:06:24] comes to the relationships that really
[1:06:26] matter
[1:06:26] i just don't want to blow away the
[1:06:28] cashier at the grocery store
[1:06:30] when i give back the extra 50 bucks they
[1:06:32] didn't mean to give me when they gave me
[1:06:33] the wrong change
[1:06:34] but i want my wife to notice that i'm
[1:06:36] willing to sacrifice not take advantage
[1:06:38] and that i'm willing to serve even with
[1:06:40] my own children
[1:06:43] especially to those at whom i owe a duty
[1:06:46] so we read in the beginning colossians
[1:06:47] chapter four verses five to six
[1:06:49] yes this is my text and i'm just getting
[1:06:51] to it at a hour and nine minutes and 36
[1:06:53] seconds and
[1:06:54] 38 seconds 39 seconds
[1:06:58] colossians chapter 4 verses 5 to 6 walk
[1:07:01] in wisdom toward them that are without
[1:07:04] redeeming the time taking advantage of
[1:07:08] every moment every second
[1:07:09] and then notice how it says this let
[1:07:10] your speech be always with grace
[1:07:12] seasoned with salt that you may know how
[1:07:14] you ought to answer
[1:07:16] every man he gives us immediately after
[1:07:19] admonishing
[1:07:20] spouses and parents and children and
[1:07:22] servants and
[1:07:24] employees immediately after instructing
[1:07:27] them
[1:07:27] he says walk in wisdom towards them that
[1:07:29] are without
[1:07:30] he says let your speech be alway with
[1:07:32] grace
[1:07:33] seasoned with salt so you may know how
[1:07:36] to answer every man
[1:07:39] now i'm just i'm leaving these with you
[1:07:40] i'm not going to amplify i'm just going
[1:07:41] to leave them with you to ponder and
[1:07:42] really think on deeply
[1:07:44] the bible says in proverbs 15 1 and 2 a
[1:07:46] soft answer turneth away wrath
[1:07:49] but grievous words stir up anger
[1:07:52] now let's not just look at this in the
[1:07:54] sense that somebody says
[1:07:55] what time is it you go well it's 8 35.
[1:08:02] it's it's a it's a it's a life as a
[1:08:04] person expressed in the text message
[1:08:06] when i just live the word those that
[1:08:07] need it pick up on it
[1:08:09] it's not just the way that you answer
[1:08:10] questions but a soft answer a soft
[1:08:13] response
[1:08:15] responding to a need instructing or
[1:08:17] correcting
[1:08:18] turns away wrath as the bible says
[1:08:20] provoke he says in colossians say
[1:08:22] provoke not your children to anger
[1:08:23] so therefore a soft instruction a soft
[1:08:25] response a soft correction
[1:08:27] turns away and gets rid of the wrath and
[1:08:29] the frustration but grievous words stir
[1:08:31] up anger it'll promote strife within a
[1:08:33] person's heart it'll never resolve the
[1:08:35] issue it's only confrontation and
[1:08:37] fighting and conflict
[1:08:39] never addressing in resolution a soft
[1:08:42] answer turneth away wrath
[1:08:43] verse 22 answers to it the tongue of the
[1:08:45] wise useth knowledge
[1:08:47] a right the tongue of the wise uses
[1:08:49] truth correctly
[1:08:51] it knows how to use the message of the
[1:08:53] hour it knows how to use the bible it
[1:08:54] knows how to use the scripture spare the
[1:08:56] rod spoil the child it knows how to use
[1:08:58] the the the scriptures that speak to
[1:09:00] headship and leadership and submission
[1:09:01] it knows how to use knowledge correctly
[1:09:05] but the mouth of
[1:09:06] fools poureth out foolishness can you
[1:09:08] say amen
[1:09:11] the mouths of fools will pour out
[1:09:13] foolishness
[1:09:15] so walk in wisdom towards them that are
[1:09:17] without be christ
[1:09:20] be meek lowly be gentle be peaceable to
[1:09:23] others
[1:09:24] because that's what wisdom looks like
[1:09:27] this is a wisdom that's
[1:09:28] compelling this is the wisdom that's
[1:09:31] salty
[1:09:32] this is the wisdom that gets somebody's
[1:09:34] attention
[1:09:36] and it says walk in wisdom toward them
[1:09:39] that are without
[1:09:41] paul said walk in wisdom towards those
[1:09:42] that are unsaved those that are outside
[1:09:44] the body of christ those who are not of
[1:09:45] the household of faith
[1:09:46] if we ought to walk in wisdom to the
[1:09:48] unsaved how much more are we to walk in
[1:09:51] wisdom towards our family and towards
[1:09:52] those in the faith
[1:09:54] how much more are we to walk in wisdom
[1:09:57] what is that in the spirit of meekness
[1:10:00] in the meekness of wisdom god bless you
[1:10:03] i've kept you lengthy tonight let's
[1:10:05] stand to our feet walk in wisdom towards
[1:10:08] them that are without
[1:10:18] think of how much more effective we can
[1:10:20] be
[1:10:23] if grace and patience are our pillars
[1:10:26] of instruction and correction
[1:10:29] as opposed to law and punishment
[1:10:33] let's just be honest all right since
[1:10:36] the uh the prevailing number of people
[1:10:38] here tonight or
[1:10:40] are married and raising children and
[1:10:41] they would look back upon how they were
[1:10:43] instructed
[1:10:46] even some of us not even we're not even
[1:10:48] raised correctly we're even raised by
[1:10:50] godly parents some of us may be even
[1:10:52] raised by abusive parents and
[1:10:53] in very horrible manipulative situations
[1:10:56] we've been in
[1:10:57] uh uh situations in churches and things
[1:10:59] where there was abuse and manipulation
[1:11:01] and control
[1:11:01] and just think of how the pillars of
[1:11:04] those relationships were often
[1:11:06] my way or the highway and consequences
[1:11:08] and punishments
[1:11:09] [Music]
[1:11:11] it's this way law and punishment law and
[1:11:13] punishment
[1:11:15] and how it was never exhibited that
[1:11:17] truth was upheld through grace and
[1:11:19] patience
[1:11:21] i think how much more effective how much
[1:11:23] more fruitful
[1:11:24] and abounding our relationships can be
[1:11:26] if we'll challenge ourselves as
[1:11:28] individuals tonight to say god i want
[1:11:30] for me
[1:11:31] i want for me i want to be characterized
[1:11:33] more by grace
[1:11:34] and patience i asked elizabeth this
[1:11:39] last week i think it was and say
[1:11:40] wouldn't it be nice if we had twin girls
[1:11:42] and we could name them grace and
[1:11:43] patience
[1:11:45] i don't remember what she said it's
[1:11:48] probably blacked out
[1:11:50] and lord please don't let this be
[1:11:52] prophecy
[1:11:54] but this is what we need we don't need
[1:11:57] more
[1:11:59] we don't need to mischaracterize this
[1:12:02] bulldog
[1:12:02] faith i just think we can just
[1:12:06] grab our children by the neck
[1:12:11] and just go for the jugular and thrash
[1:12:13] them around
[1:12:15] and then step back and be like all right
[1:12:17] you're gonna shape up
[1:12:19] you're gonna be the docile obedient
[1:12:21] humble child that i'm trying to promote
[1:12:23] the right kind of virtues in
[1:12:25] you're gonna have to find a way
[1:12:28] to achieve the right result
[1:12:32] the right way god give me the wisdom
[1:12:36] that is from above
[1:12:38] give me the spirit of meekness though
[1:12:40] this may be very pointed in a way to
[1:12:42] challenge us
[1:12:43] as adults and as parents in our method
[1:12:46] of leadership in our relationship
[1:12:47] that we have with our spouse and the the
[1:12:49] way that we interact with one another it
[1:12:51] could be instructive to me
[1:12:52] as a pastor there's different ways that
[1:12:54] we could take this
[1:12:55] and admonish ourselves and correct
[1:12:57] ourselves but can i just express this
[1:12:59] this way
[1:13:02] that maybe it will help you to
[1:13:05] understand
[1:13:08] the hurts that you've experienced in
[1:13:09] life
[1:13:11] and the complexes that you have as an
[1:13:13] adult
[1:13:15] they maybe give you a little bit of
[1:13:16] grace to realize the reason why
[1:13:18] sometimes
[1:13:19] i do what i do as an adult is because i
[1:13:22] was done the way i was done
[1:13:23] by an adult but now lord i'm going to
[1:13:27] break the cycle
[1:13:29] because i recognize now the way i have
[1:13:31] been led the way i have been fed isn't
[1:13:33] the way that i want to lead the way i
[1:13:34] want to feed
[1:13:35] and lord now i take on the headship and
[1:13:38] i submit myself to the meekness of
[1:13:40] wisdom
[1:13:41] not just knowledge but i use wisdom to
[1:13:44] use it right
[1:13:46] could we all do that tonight at the very
[1:13:49] least
[1:13:49] say lord thank you for showing me why
[1:13:52] there's things in my life and
[1:13:53] instincts and habits that i have as an
[1:13:55] adult as a husband
[1:13:57] and as a parent there's things i reach
[1:14:00] for things i say and things i do
[1:14:02] not because i'm evil not because i'm not
[1:14:05] beloved and i'm not holy not because i'm
[1:14:07] not the elect of god but because
[1:14:09] i've experienced a trauma i've
[1:14:11] experienced a hardship i've experienced
[1:14:13] behavior i'm modeling behavior that
[1:14:15] isn't correct
[1:14:17] i say lord now i know that i can
[1:14:18] likewise
[1:14:20] turn to you and look to you and say
[1:14:21] there's my example
[1:14:23] with head spout if you like to lift your
[1:14:25] hands before the lord and say lord here
[1:14:27] i am
[1:14:28] i'm learning i'm growing
[1:14:33] say lord take my hand lead me lord
[1:14:40] lead me lord
[1:14:44] i will fall
[1:14:49] need me lord i
[1:14:54] will go
[1:14:58] you have called me
[1:15:03] i will
[1:15:21] i will fall
[1:15:26] need me lord i
[1:15:32] will go
[1:15:36] you have
[1:15:38] [Music]
[1:15:51] we're just humbling ourselves to him
[1:15:52] tonight each one of us if i want to be a
[1:15:54] leader i want to be a follower
[1:15:56] i'm going to be a good shepherd i got to
[1:15:58] be a good sheep
[1:16:00] every single one of us now let's just
[1:16:01] humble ourselves become meek like
[1:16:03] lambs our gracious heavenly father
[1:16:05] tonight lord we're surrendering
[1:16:06] ourselves to you we're accepting
[1:16:09] your word i know lord that
[1:16:12] it's very pointed and very direct even
[1:16:16] very specific as it's been expressed
[1:16:19] testimony lord like just
[1:16:21] surgery like precision but lord we do
[1:16:25] not take offense to it
[1:16:28] we recognize the tender hand of jehovah
[1:16:30] that's promoting healing
[1:16:33] that's going into painful areas of our
[1:16:35] lives
[1:16:36] getting very close to that part of our
[1:16:38] pride which has always been easily
[1:16:40] provoked but somehow lord
[1:16:42] you've taken the scalpel of your word
[1:16:44] and with such tenderness got right to
[1:16:46] the very
[1:16:46] softest most vulnerable parts of our
[1:16:49] spirits tonight
[1:16:51] and he managed just to sniff at it in
[1:16:53] such a way
[1:16:55] people are willing just to lean into it
[1:16:57] a little bit more and say yes lord this
[1:16:58] is what i need
[1:17:01] yes lord this is what i need and i won't
[1:17:04] run away from it i won't hide i won't do
[1:17:06] as i did before
[1:17:09] but i'll say lord this is what i need
[1:17:13] therefore father we ask for your
[1:17:14] forgiveness
[1:17:17] if we have parented through pride
[1:17:20] if we have instructed for advantage for
[1:17:23] reputation
[1:17:25] we have led through selfish ambition
[1:17:28] lord forgive us
[1:17:30] if the pillars of our instruction the
[1:17:32] pillars of our headship as husband and
[1:17:34] father
[1:17:34] within the home the pillars of our
[1:17:35] leadership as pastor if the pillars of
[1:17:38] our
[1:17:38] of our formative and instructive
[1:17:40] discipline and our corrective discipline
[1:17:42] to our children has been
[1:17:44] law and punishment the lord may there be
[1:17:46] a spirit of
[1:17:47] samson rise up and topple those pillars
[1:17:50] today
[1:17:51] with the self-sacrificing that you might
[1:17:55] promote the pillars of grace and
[1:17:57] patience in our lives
[1:17:58] [Music]
[1:18:00] this is the meekness and gentleness of
[1:18:01] christ that we must aspire to lord
[1:18:06] to not only be taught but to be teachers
[1:18:10] i pray lord you take this group here
[1:18:12] tonight
[1:18:14] this many that could easily be numbered
[1:18:17] lord
[1:18:18] and may they become the force
[1:18:19] multipliers who so yield themselves to a
[1:18:22] supernatural power that
[1:18:24] suddenly results begin to take place
[1:18:26] within relationships
[1:18:28] within family dynamics that can only be
[1:18:31] attributed to you
[1:18:34] not because we found the secret to
[1:18:37] manipulating and using psychology and
[1:18:39] getting the best out of our children by
[1:18:42] some trick but lord you have come on the
[1:18:44] scene
[1:18:46] and made the difference that we never
[1:18:47] could i pray that you'd grant it for me
[1:18:50] for my
[1:18:51] family for this church
[1:18:54] for the husbands the wives the brothers
[1:18:56] the sisters the aunts the uncles the
[1:18:58] grandparents
[1:18:59] the believers that are represented in
[1:19:01] this church
[1:19:03] we love you we ask this in the name of
[1:19:05] lord jesus christ
[1:19:07] amen
