[0:00] Acts chapter 2 37. Now when they heard
[0:04] this, they were pricricked in their
[0:05] heart and said unto Peter and to the
[0:07] rest of the apostles, men and brethren,
[0:09] what shall we do? And so this is a move
[0:12] in their heart. Something has stirred
[0:13] them. Then Peter said unto them, repent
[0:15] and be baptized every one of you in the
[0:17] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[0:19] of sins, and you shall receive the gift
[0:22] of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is
[0:24] unto you, and to your children, and to
[0:26] all that are a far off, even as many as
[0:28] the Lord our God shall call." And with
[0:30] many other words did he testify and
[0:32] exhort, saying, "Save yourselves from
[0:34] this untored generation." Then they that
[0:37] gladly received his word were baptized,
[0:39] and the same day were added unto them
[0:41] about 3,000 souls. And they continued
[0:44] steadfast in the apostles doctrine, and
[0:46] fellowship, and in breaking of bread,
[0:47] and in prayers. And fear came upon every
[0:50] soul. And many wonders and signs were
[0:52] done by the apostles. And all that
[0:54] believed were together and had all
[0:56] things common, and sold their
[0:57] possessions and goods, and parted them
[0:59] to all men, as every man had need. And
[1:02] they, continuing daily with one accord
[1:03] in the temple, and breaking bread from
[1:05] house to house, did eat their meat with
[1:07] gladness and singleness of heart,
[1:09] praising God, and having favor with all
[1:11] the people. And the Lord added to the
[1:13] church daily such as should be saved.
[1:16] Amen. You can be seated.
[1:20] Brother Joseph Frank, good to see you,
[1:22] too.
[1:25] I'm going to start a new subject in the
[1:27] new year. I've mentioned it um in the
[1:29] past on community, and it may seem to be
[1:32] somewhat cliche as a term, but I have
[1:34] been giving a lot of thought to this in
[1:36] terms of uh what community looks like as
[1:38] even fellowshipping with a brother last
[1:40] year who's facing a deci decision and
[1:42] making a difficult choice in their
[1:44] lives. And uh the subject landed briefly
[1:46] on community and just how we recognize
[1:49] um a need for it. And I would say that
[1:53] uh just maybe sharing this from my heart
[1:56] that
[1:58] where where the word is uh directed,
[2:01] it's going to meet you where you are.
[2:03] It's really easy just to say Christ is
[2:05] over here somewhere and tell you you you
[2:06] got to go find him. But Christ is going
[2:08] to meet you where you are. And so I
[2:10] believe that the word of God addresses
[2:12] us in a terminology and in circumstances
[2:14] and situations that speak to what we're
[2:16] going through. And so if this seems uh
[2:19] if it seems somewhat cliche, I'm not
[2:20] worried about that. But I am wanting to
[2:22] explore this concept of community. And
[2:25] so my title today is Christ Church and
[2:27] the Christian. And this is part one. I
[2:31] went a whole year without a part one or
[2:33] two. And so this is part one. at the
[2:36] beginning of the year a Christ church
[2:38] and a Christian. So there's a lot that
[2:40] comes into view there. Uh in defining
[2:42] community, I'd like to just start off
[2:44] with this as a definition. A unified
[2:46] body of individuals. So a community that
[2:49] I'm looking at is a group of individuals
[2:52] that form a body through their
[2:54] unification. So it's individuals that
[2:56] are unified that make up a body. So it
[2:59] becomes a community. And if you looked
[3:01] at it as a feeling, that would be that
[3:03] feeling of fellowship or camaraderie
[3:04] that others have by sharing something or
[3:08] things in common. So there's a word that
[3:10] we can see that begins to become a theme
[3:12] with community as far as commonness. And
[3:15] if you were to look at this from uh
[3:17] maybe an academic standpoint, humans
[3:19] have been separating themselves into
[3:20] groups from the very beginning that it's
[3:23] something that there is this innate
[3:24] tendency of the human brain to divide
[3:26] the world into us against them. Am I
[3:30] right? It's us versus them, right?
[3:32] That's the way that we always think. And
[3:33] so there's just this innate tendency to
[3:35] begin to think in terms of group
[3:37] thinking. It's us versus them. And this
[3:40] is they this is a a claim that is made
[3:44] quite frequently that our our need for
[3:46] social connection is a fundamental basic
[3:49] need uh just as necessary as food and
[3:52] water. They say that uh belonging to a
[3:55] group or group membership is one of the
[3:56] single greatest factors or predictors of
[3:59] survival in difficult circumstances and
[4:01] historically gave you better access to
[4:03] resources. You had this mutual network
[4:05] of protection. You had this social
[4:08] support system. So uh being a part of a
[4:10] community is not just a sense of
[4:12] belonging and having identity but
[4:14] historically it was necessary for
[4:15] survival that this uh connection that we
[4:19] have in a community is a basic human
[4:21] need. And in Genesis 2 18 says and the
[4:25] Lord God said this is observing Adam and
[4:28] his habitat and his domain singularly as
[4:31] one man. It says it is not good that man
[4:33] should be alone. I will make him a help
[4:36] meat for him. So this scripture to me is
[4:38] very important to see that man was
[4:41] existing in the beginning by himself.
[4:43] And he says it's not good that he would
[4:45] be alone. I'll make him a helpmate. We
[4:47] know this is the woman that came from
[4:49] man. But we see that God created man as
[4:52] a social creature. He didn't look at man
[4:55] and say, "Wow, that's the ideal right
[4:57] there. a man by himself in the woods, in
[5:00] nature, uh uh cooking for himself,
[5:03] living by himself, uh just living free
[5:06] of care. He said, "No, man needs
[5:08] somebody uh to be with him." And the
[5:10] Bible says, "A help me meet." And he
[5:12] begins by bringing forth the woman, and
[5:14] it would not just be a man and a woman,
[5:16] but they would also have children. And
[5:18] so God in the beginning wanted to have
[5:20] become a family. And so God in the
[5:23] beginning created this family that would
[5:24] be a a community in Eden. Right
[5:28] &gt;&gt; now, as we have used the term church in
[5:33] our title, I'd like to give I'd like to
[5:35] spend my time this morning on that
[5:37] particular aspect because this is where
[5:39] the Lord began to deal with me and
[5:40] certain things happen where you realize,
[5:42] wow, there's certain challenges that we
[5:44] face as a church uh that are analogous
[5:47] to challenges we face in families and
[5:50] extended families in the world today.
[5:52] But church is a place that's set aside
[5:54] for Christian worship. So we're they
[5:57] they may have things called a satanic
[5:58] church and and a church of food or
[6:00] something, but church is a place set
[6:03] aside for Christian worship. It's the
[6:04] assembling or gathering together of
[6:07] Christians. And when there's church and
[6:10] all you have to do is kind of look
[6:11] around and begin to think of our own
[6:12] personal experiences that church,
[6:15] Christian churches join together diverse
[6:17] backgrounds for different genres and
[6:20] cultures and personalities and classes
[6:21] and from different economics and
[6:24] different education. uh educational
[6:26] levels, different goals, uh uh different
[6:28] desires, different um uh you know, you
[6:31] have families with one child, you have
[6:32] families that can't have children, you
[6:34] have some families that are broken.
[6:35] There's so many different social
[6:37] economic factors and it's such a a
[6:39] diverse combining of people. I was
[6:43] sharing this recently uh with different
[6:45] ones and it's something that became more
[6:46] real to me uh in just with our young
[6:49] people and our own children is there is
[6:52] uh they say that within families that
[6:56] your children will mistreat each other,
[6:58] the siblings will mistreat each other
[7:00] because they know no matter how bad they
[7:02] treat that person, they're still there
[7:03] the next morning when they wake up.
[7:05] &gt;&gt; Like they have to be together. And so
[7:07] they'll tend to treat the their friends
[7:09] or people they want to be friends with
[7:10] better than they treat their siblings. I
[7:12] know you're all thinking, "Man, Brother
[7:13] Aaron's dealing with stuff." Now, if
[7:15] he's going to get into this this early
[7:17] in the year and this early in the
[7:19] service uh before the chill is not even
[7:21] out of the air, I'm already talking
[7:22] about my children and how they get
[7:24] along. But it's just something psych
[7:27] psychologically they begin to learn that
[7:28] I can abuse this person to no end. And
[7:32] my parents are still going to tell me to
[7:33] share and to play nice and get along
[7:35] because we all live within the same
[7:37] house. And so in educational settings,
[7:39] uh, in social settings, children tend to
[7:42] be nicer to other kids that they want to
[7:44] be friends with and that they want to
[7:46] have they have a connection with or they
[7:47] want to maintain a certain relationship
[7:49] with. And what I found with church is
[7:52] our children, they come, they come to
[7:54] church and they're part of a a church
[7:56] setting and they're in youth groups and
[7:58] they have homeschool co-ops and things
[7:59] like that and they have their group of
[8:02] friends almost picked out for them.
[8:05] Have you ever thought about that? that
[8:07] we tell them to sit at the table and to
[8:09] hang out with these people and they go
[8:10] to church with these people and they
[8:12] play ball with these people and they
[8:13] talk to these people and they hang out
[8:15] and they have no choice whether or not
[8:16] they really even like them, whether or
[8:18] not they have anything in common. Uh and
[8:20] that we can almost replicate a kind of a
[8:23] situation where it's like no matter how
[8:25] we get along or how much we like each
[8:27] other, we're kind of forced to be
[8:28] together because this is where my
[8:30] parents go to church. And so it presents
[8:32] other challenges that you have with
[8:34] young people and people getting along
[8:36] and the way things work together. And so
[8:39] one thing I began to realize is that
[8:42] when you have when you make friends in
[8:43] school, I had some friends in school for
[8:46] anybody who's wondering. And when you
[8:48] had friends, you found you found things
[8:50] in common. You there's something that
[8:52] maybe you shared whether if you played
[8:53] baseball, you hung out with baseball
[8:55] players. If you were into certain
[8:56] things, then you you found things in
[8:58] common. And there was something that you
[9:01] that joined you together. So, as I
[9:03] looked at this, I realized that God's
[9:05] word uh knows that we're social
[9:08] creatures. God made us to be social
[9:10] creatures. He knows uh how we how we
[9:13] think and what our tendencies are. And
[9:15] so, God's word is best suited for
[9:17] equipping uh the individual for personal
[9:20] growth and for good success as the Bible
[9:22] would use that term. And as we have this
[9:26] need for community, I believe God's word
[9:28] establishes that in the best order. And
[9:30] so my burden is to identify God's God's
[9:33] concept of community uh to identif
[9:36] identify its purpose and how it works in
[9:38] our personal lives. And I want to begin
[9:39] with this Christ Church and a Christian.
[9:42] So, if you could turn to Matthew chapter
[9:44] 16 13-19,
[9:51] we'll read through a number of scripture
[9:53] readings today. And a lot of these
[9:56] scriptures we're going to use, we're
[9:57] going to reuse and probably reuse quite
[9:59] frequently. I'm not sure how long we'll
[10:01] be on this subject, but we'll just
[10:03] commit it to the Lord as we have as the
[10:05] need arises, we'll continue in this
[10:07] subject. says when Jesus came into the
[10:09] coast of Cesaria Philippi he asked his
[10:12] disciples saying whom do men say that I
[10:15] the son of man am so now Jesus is
[10:18] identifying himself in this office of
[10:20] the son of man but he's saying what do
[10:22] people think about this uh m ministry
[10:25] and they said some say that thou art
[10:27] John the Baptist some Elias and others
[10:31] Jeremiah or one of the prophets and so
[10:33] you could see just how people would
[10:35] think they thought that this was perhaps
[10:37] the reincarnation of John the Baptist
[10:39] already or he was in the same spirit as
[10:41] John the Baptist or Elijah some other
[10:43] prophet then he says who do you verse 15
[10:46] he saith unto him but whom say ye that I
[10:49] am not what everybody else is saying but
[10:52] what's your own personal um
[10:53] understanding what would you confess
[10:57] &gt;&gt; and Simon Peter answered and said thou
[10:59] art the Christ the son of the living God
[11:03] &gt;&gt; it's quite a statement that he makes and
[11:04] Jesus answered and said and blessed art
[11:06] thou Simon Barjonah For flesh and blood
[11:08] hath not revealed it unto thee. So this
[11:12] understanding which says who whom say ye
[11:14] that I am what he said is a revelation.
[11:17] Thou art the Christ the son of the
[11:19] living God. But flesh and blood hath not
[11:21] revealed it to him. But my father which
[11:23] is in heaven if we could say hath
[11:25] revealed this to you Peter.
[11:28] &gt;&gt; And I say unto thee that thou art Peter.
[11:30] So there's kind of a name this name
[11:31] change here. A stone. Thou art Peter.
[11:34] Upon this rock I will build my church.
[11:38] Now some denominations and organization
[11:40] took that to mean Peter the stone. But
[11:42] the rock that Christ is going to build
[11:44] his church on is the revelation
[11:48] &gt;&gt; upon this rock. This foundation, this
[11:50] beginning of the revelation of Jesus
[11:52] Christ, I will build my church and the
[11:54] gates of hell shall not prevail against
[11:56] it. the revelation
[11:59] or the church.
[12:01] &gt;&gt; And I will give unto thee, notice this
[12:03] language, the keys of the kingdom of
[12:04] heaven. And whosoever shalt bind
[12:06] whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth
[12:08] shall be bound in heaven. And whatsoever
[12:10] thou shalt loose on earth shall be
[12:11] loosed in heaven. So now there's these
[12:13] characteristics he's identifying about
[12:16] uh the stone, the keys, the rock, the
[12:18] church, all these images in one. And
[12:21] Jesus uses this phrase. It's the only
[12:23] place that he uses it. upon this rock I
[12:26] will build my church. It's the only
[12:29] place he says my church. It's the only
[12:30] place he refers to something that would
[12:32] be individually or his. But this is the
[12:34] church of Jesus Christ. This is his
[12:36] church. So when I when I use a phrase
[12:39] today of of his church or if we were to
[12:43] capitalize the C and that church that
[12:45] that's this church that Christ is
[12:47] talking about. Hebrews 12 23 says to the
[12:51] general assembly and church of the
[12:53] firstborn. Paul is saying this is what
[12:54] we've come to this mount Zion this
[12:56] general assembly and church of the
[12:58] firstborn identifies a special assembly
[13:02] a special church if we say that's a
[13:04] something a gathering of Christians this
[13:07] is the church of the firstborn Christ
[13:09] being the firstborn from the dead the
[13:11] only begotten of the father now has many
[13:14] sons that are being brought to glory who
[13:16] who is this general assembly or church
[13:18] which are written in heaven so their
[13:20] names are in the lamb books lamb's book
[13:21] of life and to god the judge of all into
[13:24] the spirits of just men made perfect.
[13:26] This is my church as Jesus said. In
[13:29] Colossians 1 15 to18 it says who is the
[13:33] image of the invisible God speaking of
[13:34] Christ the firstborn of every creature.
[13:37] For by him were all things created that
[13:39] are in heaven and that are in earth
[13:41] visible and invisible whether they be
[13:43] thrones or dominions or principalities
[13:45] or powers. All things were created by
[13:48] him and for him. And he is before all
[13:50] things and by him all things consist.
[13:52] Verse 18, and he is the head of the
[13:56] body, the church. So Christ is the head
[14:00] of a body. So it gives him a very
[14:02] specific description. He is the head.
[14:04] But the body, what is the head without
[14:06] the body? He has a body. And the body
[14:08] here Paul says, is the church who is the
[14:11] beginning? Christ the head, the
[14:13] firstborn from the dead. So this is the
[14:15] church of the firstborn that in all
[14:17] things he might have the preeminence. So
[14:20] he's the head of the body that he might
[14:22] have preeminence in the body in control
[14:26] and leadership of the body. So the
[14:28] church that Christ speaks of upon this
[14:30] rock I will build my church. It's that
[14:32] general assembly the church of the
[14:33] firstborn it is his body that is the
[14:36] church
[14:37] &gt;&gt; in Ephesians chapter 1 22 and 23
[14:41] and c and hath put all things under
[14:43] Christ's feet. God hath put all things
[14:45] under his feet. Notice kind of this
[14:47] repetition of all things. And it says,
[14:50] "And gave him Christ to be the head over
[14:53] all things to the church
[14:56] &gt;&gt; which is his body."
[14:58] &gt;&gt; So again, you see this image of Christ
[15:01] being the head and then the church being
[15:04] the body. And it's not just a body, it's
[15:06] his body.
[15:07] &gt;&gt; Upon this rock, I will build my church,
[15:10] which is his body, the fullness of him
[15:12] that fleth all in all.
[15:14] &gt;&gt; So there is a church of Jesus Christ.
[15:17] there's a church that is uh and just
[15:20] using that phrase and we say well it's a
[15:21] body it it's it's something very real
[15:24] and scriptural in it so it has some
[15:26] reality and we use this term his church
[15:29] or the church of Christ the church of
[15:30] Jesus Christ his church is made up of
[15:33] individuals
[15:35] &gt;&gt; so it's not a building
[15:37] &gt;&gt; it's not an idea it's something that's
[15:39] very real it is a body that is made up
[15:43] of individuals who are baptized into
[15:45] that church by the Holy Spirit.
[15:49] &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 12 12 13 and 14 says for
[15:53] as the body is one and hath many members
[15:56] and all the members of that one body
[15:58] being many are one body so also is
[16:00] Christ. So he's saying just look at your
[16:02] body. You have a head, you have fingers,
[16:03] you have toes, you have all these
[16:04] different body parts. He says, but you
[16:06] you don't look as the the elbow or the
[16:09] forehead as being different from any
[16:10] other a different body, but it is one
[16:13] body and it has many members
[16:17] and and so the body being one having
[16:19] member members, he says, so Christ is
[16:20] the same way. Yeah.
[16:22] &gt;&gt; So Christ as the head with the body,
[16:24] he's wanting us to imagine then that
[16:26] this body has many members and singular
[16:29] parts and different things that move and
[16:31] individuals that make it up. So he says,
[16:33] "For by one spirit,
[16:36] Christ the head of a body that has many
[16:38] members. For by one spirit are we all
[16:40] baptized into one body." And then he
[16:43] breaks this down in a granular or
[16:45] cellular level to say whether we be Jews
[16:47] or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free
[16:51] and have all been made to drink in one
[16:53] spirit. For the body is not one member
[16:55] but many.
[16:56] So there's a saying that what we might
[16:59] say, well I am the church. I am the
[17:01] body. But you are a member of that.
[17:05] &gt;&gt; It would be incredibly narcissistic, I
[17:08] guess, to say that I'm the only one.
[17:10] There's nobody else.
[17:12] And and in that a and maybe if we say,
[17:15] well, if there's only one that's going
[17:16] to make it, it's going to be me. But we
[17:17] recognize scripturally and spiritually
[17:19] that there's more to this body of Christ
[17:21] than just one individual.
[17:23] &gt;&gt; That it says by one spirit we're all
[17:25] baptized as Jew, Gentile, different
[17:28] nationalities and backgrounds, bond or
[17:29] free, different economic classes, but
[17:31] somehow by this one drink in the spirit,
[17:34] we're we're baptized into this body. So
[17:38] individually we retain some uh
[17:40] individuality or personality as maybe uh
[17:44] uh it could be phrased Oswald Chambers
[17:46] might put it in those distinctions but
[17:48] there's this individual that's baptized
[17:50] into this one body
[17:52] &gt;&gt; that is the body of Jesus Christ
[17:57] it is the church
[17:59] &gt;&gt; the true church
[18:02] in Matthew 18 15 to20 we see something
[18:05] else emerge
[18:11] We're revisiting maybe a lot of
[18:12] different principles that we used in the
[18:15] series we did on our family tree which
[18:17] was kind of setting forth the vision of
[18:18] this church as it had recently begun.
[18:21] And I think some of these things are
[18:22] always good to revisit uh in terms of
[18:25] the general principles but we hope to be
[18:26] able to bring this out in greater light
[18:28] more relevant detail today uh in this
[18:31] time this year. Matthew chapter 18 15
[18:35] to20. We're going to read a little bit
[18:36] here so you can get the context.
[18:38] Moreover, if thy brother shall trespass
[18:40] against thee, go and tell his fault
[18:42] between thee in him alone. If he shall
[18:45] hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.
[18:48] So there's even a language of a a
[18:51] relationship that's being used here. But
[18:52] if he will not hear thee, then take with
[18:54] thee one or two more. Then in the mouth
[18:56] of two or three witnesses every word may
[18:59] be established. Yeah,
[19:01] &gt;&gt; this is this process Jesus is laying
[19:03] out. If one has been offended or there's
[19:05] been some sort of trespass, then there's
[19:08] a Jesus is giving good instruction on
[19:11] how to address this. And the as I've
[19:14] been studying for some other services
[19:16] and I have some meetings coming up and
[19:18] been uh burdened on certain subjects,
[19:20] I've been looking at uh certain
[19:22] processes and patterns that we go
[19:24] through as individuals and how that the
[19:26] world has a lot of advice on how to do
[19:28] things. And they found there are certain
[19:30] things that work and I have never failed
[19:32] to find anything that works in some sort
[19:35] of philosophical or social construct
[19:37] that you can't bring back to a biblical
[19:39] principle if it really works. Uh, I'm
[19:41] not just talking about a blind squirrel
[19:43] finding a nut every once in a while or a
[19:45] broken clock being right twice a day.
[19:46] I'm talking something that is sound
[19:49] wisdom that's been passed on and on.
[19:51] You'll find it's in the word of God
[19:52] because God knows the human mind better
[19:54] than anything.
[19:56] &gt;&gt; There's even this this approach to
[19:58] decision-m where they say assume that
[20:00] something has happened that the thing
[20:02] fails spectacularly and you begin to ask
[20:05] yourself what makes what would cause
[20:08] this to fail or not work out right? And
[20:09] so you kind of do this p postmortem and
[20:11] say if this happen what would have to
[20:13] happen in order for that to happen and
[20:15] it activates a different part of your
[20:16] thinking where you slow down. You begin
[20:18] to proc see process things differently
[20:20] than just your gut instinct on
[20:22] something. And and this is just what
[20:24] social economist or behavioral economics
[20:27] would teach you to do maybe to change
[20:28] switch system that you're using the fast
[20:30] or the slow and I found that in the word
[20:32] of God God already shows us what would
[20:34] happen
[20:35] &gt;&gt; in so many ways. He shows us already how
[20:38] this is going to fail and works us back.
[20:40] And the Bible's the best thing equipped
[20:42] to steady our minds and to lead us and
[20:45] to guide us. And so this what Jesus is
[20:48] sharing here to me is good practices. I
[20:51] remember when I was um in law school and
[20:54] I had to there was a particular ethics
[20:56] class I had to take and we had to give
[20:58] uh we had to give a presentation on
[21:00] something and um I chose um can a
[21:03] Christian be a lawyer or can a lawyer be
[21:06] a Christian and maybe inverted because I
[21:07] had that actually asked of me. Can a
[21:10] Christian be a lawyer? And I said no
[21:11] I'll have to renounce Christ on the day
[21:12] of my when I pass the bars. Oh that's a
[21:15] shame brother. I'm really sorry to hear
[21:16] that. But there's and um I've made some
[21:20] people really really angry when they
[21:21] said, "How could you be a lawyer and a
[21:22] Christian?" I said, "Well, I can't think
[21:24] of anything more Christlike than a
[21:26] criminal defense lawyer representing
[21:28] somebody who's guilty."
[21:30] &gt;&gt; And I've had them get up and leave
[21:31] breakfast when I use that example. I
[21:33] said, "Well, I guess that conversation's
[21:35] over."
[21:37] But I one of the things that I had to
[21:39] address in looking at what I would be
[21:41] required to do as a lawyer, there was
[21:42] one thing one thing that I began to get
[21:44] a little hung up on and it's that as a
[21:46] lawyer, if another lawyer does something
[21:48] ethically wrong, I'm obligated to report
[21:51] him.
[21:52] &gt;&gt; Absolutely obligated. And it's not just
[21:55] necessarily a sin of moral turpitude.
[21:56] It's something that if you see them
[21:58] violating the code of ethics, then
[22:00] you're responsible to report them and
[22:02] think, "Wow, that where does where's the
[22:04] the love that hides a multitude of sins
[22:06] and where's the grace from my brother?"
[22:08] And then I saw this scripture that says,
[22:11] "If your brother makes a mistake, go to
[22:13] him." So the very next provision in
[22:15] those ethics is but before you report
[22:17] him, go to him.
[22:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:20] &gt;&gt; And inform him of his transgression and
[22:22] allow him an opportunity to self-report.
[22:26] And so there's you realize that well why
[22:28] is that in our code of ethics? Well man
[22:30] might have stumbled on that himself
[22:32] realizing this is the best practices but
[22:34] there's things that God identifies in
[22:36] the word of God that are good for how we
[22:38] behave how we treat one another and how
[22:40] we operate not only as Christians
[22:43] especially as Christians but also as
[22:45] individuals and human beings. So it says
[22:47] here in verse 17, "And if he shall
[22:49] neglect to hear them," this is the
[22:51] individual, and then the witnesses,
[22:52] "Tell it unto the church.
[22:58] But if he neglect to hear the church,
[23:00] let him be unto thee as a heathen and a
[23:03] a heathen man and a publican." So now
[23:05] there's some sort of separating out from
[23:07] that body,
[23:08] &gt;&gt; right?
[23:09] &gt;&gt; He's he he loses some relationship or
[23:12] affinity or some connection to the group
[23:14] there or to what he says here at the
[23:16] church. And notice this phrase, tell it
[23:18] to the church.
[23:21] I I'll keep reading and then we'll come
[23:22] back to this. Verily, I say unto you,
[23:23] whatsoever you shall bind on earth shall
[23:25] be bound in heaven. Notice how closely
[23:26] this resembles what he had said just
[23:28] earlier to Peter about the keys to the
[23:31] kingdom of heaven. And whatsoever you
[23:32] bind on earth and be bound in heaven.
[23:34] Now, there's some characteristic that's
[23:36] passed down. He's referring to a
[23:38] different church, but a similar
[23:40] identity. Whatsoever you shall bind on
[23:42] earth shall be bound in heaven. And
[23:43] whatsoever you shall loose on earth
[23:44] shall be loosed in heaven. Again, I say
[23:46] unto you, that if two of you shall agree
[23:47] on earth as touching anything that they
[23:50] shall ask, it shall be done for them of
[23:51] my father which is in heaven. For where
[23:53] two or three are gathered together in my
[23:56] my name, there am I in the midst of
[23:58] them.
[24:00] &gt;&gt; So, this is a a gathering. He's
[24:02] referring to some sort of body of people
[24:04] or individuals have some sort of
[24:06] relationship and there some sort of
[24:07] assumption of accountability because
[24:10] I've been trespassed by a brother and I
[24:12] go to him said, "You've offended mean he
[24:14] says, "Well, I'm not going to listen to
[24:15] you." Then you go with witnesses and
[24:16] they sit down with them. He says, "I'm
[24:18] not going to listen to them." And then
[24:19] you bring it to it says, "The church th
[24:22] this church here is different from the
[24:25] Matthew 16 church. Upon this rock, I
[24:28] will build my church." And so there's a
[24:31] church that is Christ's church. And then
[24:34] the the church here, this church exists
[24:37] solely because of his church.
[24:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah. If there wasn't his church, there
[24:41] would be no need for the church.
[24:44] &gt;&gt; His church is his body. That's the
[24:46] that's the dynamics of the spirit
[24:48] baptizing individuals into this larger
[24:50] body called the body of Christ. And then
[24:52] when he says there's a brother that's
[24:53] trespassed against another brother, he's
[24:55] referring to this assembling or
[24:57] gathering together people in his name.
[25:00] &gt;&gt; So there's some sort of Christian
[25:01] character associated with it. He says,
[25:03] "And if they neglect to hear the
[25:05] church," so you're to tell the church,
[25:06] then you let the church speak. And if
[25:09] they don't hear that, that church only
[25:11] exists because of his church.
[25:14] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, this would just be some club
[25:16] that you get initiated into and that you
[25:17] could be kicked out of because you
[25:19] offended somebody. But it exists because
[25:21] there is a greater church.
[25:25] &gt;&gt; So you have a my church, which is Jesus
[25:27] saying, "Upon this rock, I'll build my
[25:29] church." And then you have a church or
[25:31] the church that one attends, if we could
[25:33] say that, or the local body.
[25:35] In Acts chapter 2 47,
[25:40] we're we're jumping right into the
[25:41] middle of this. I realize now that uh we
[25:43] could maybe get a little bit more, but
[25:44] this is how this chapter ends on this
[25:46] great the day of Pentecost. Uh the Holy
[25:49] Spirit's poured out. Peter preaches when
[25:51] they say, you know, these people are
[25:52] drunk and they're speaking in these
[25:54] languages that we can all different ones
[25:56] can understand. And the crowd responds,
[25:57] what must we do? And this is the end.
[25:59] They're praising God, having favor with
[26:01] all the people. and the Lord added to
[26:04] the church daily such as should be
[26:06] saved. So this adding to the church
[26:09] daily, it could be applied to his
[26:12] church, but then it can also be applied
[26:15] to the church,
[26:16] &gt;&gt; a church, because as the Lord added to
[26:19] the church daily. There was those that
[26:20] were being baptized by the Holy Ghost
[26:23] into the body of Christ and those who
[26:25] are be a part of the body of Christ.
[26:27] Now, as they assemble together as two or
[26:29] three gathered together and as they have
[26:31] some sort of fellowship and communion
[26:32] together, that becomes this assembly
[26:36] &gt;&gt; of believers.
[26:37] You'll find a number of scriptures in
[26:39] the Bible that refer to this. I'm not
[26:40] being exhaustive because there's so many
[26:42] that uh we could kind of get lost in
[26:44] these weeds, but in 1 Corinthians
[26:46] chapter 1:2 it says under the church of
[26:48] God which is at Corenth. It's called the
[26:51] church of God. Then in Thessalonians he
[26:53] says under the church of the
[26:55] Thessalonians. Now you realize each one
[26:57] is given a different name, a different
[26:59] character. Uh and they they're in
[27:01] different locations and but yet they're
[27:03] called the church of God or the church
[27:05] of the Thessalonians.
[27:07] And in in doing so, it wasn't to create
[27:10] a nomenclature where it's the first
[27:11] message church of Phoenix or the first
[27:14] Baptist church uh of Glendale. There's
[27:16] not it's not this effort to be the
[27:18] first. I think that's the number one
[27:20] comment on any message board is first.
[27:22] And that's what people want to be. They
[27:24] want to be first. They want to be the
[27:26] one that gets in there first. Well,
[27:27] that's not the idea is not to be the
[27:28] first. It's just the church of the
[27:30] firstborn.
[27:32] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. He's the first. He's the
[27:33] alpha and omega of this church. And so
[27:36] there's a church in Corinth. There's a
[27:39] church in Thessalonica.
[27:41] In Galatians, he says there are the
[27:42] churches of Galatia. Not first, second,
[27:45] third, and fourth church of Galatia, but
[27:46] just the churches of Galatia. In 2
[27:49] Corinthians 8, it refers to the churches
[27:51] of Macedonia.
[27:53] This is just early on in the Christian
[27:55] church. You have all these gatherings
[27:57] all over the place.
[27:59] &gt;&gt; We could say in some sense it's
[28:01] localized. It says in Revelations 1 11
[28:04] saying, "I am Alpha and Omega, the first
[28:06] and the last. And what thou seeest write
[28:08] in a book and send it unto the seven
[28:10] churches which are in Asia."
[28:13] &gt;&gt; So there's he's singling out seven
[28:16] churches and it's because they have a
[28:17] certain character, certain makeup, and
[28:19] they're going to be expressive of future
[28:21] ages. But he says these are se these
[28:23] seven churches which are in Asia. And
[28:25] then he names them unto Ephesus and
[28:27] under Smyrna and under Pergamus and
[28:29] under Thotyra and under Sardis and under
[28:31] Philadelphia and under Leodysia. So now
[28:34] he names these seven churches one uh uh
[28:37] one seven of many and they're kind of
[28:39] regionalized and localized at that time
[28:42] in what we call Asia. Revelations
[28:45] chapter 2 to3
[28:47] excuse me Revelations chapters 2 and
[28:49] three says the church of Ephesus. This
[28:52] is the church in Smyrna. the church in
[28:54] Pergamus, the church in Thotyra, the
[28:56] church in Sardis, the church in
[28:57] Philadelphia Philadelphia, a and the
[28:59] church of Leodysia. There's this
[29:01] distinction now of these individual
[29:03] churches that existed then historically
[29:05] but that have a certain makeup and
[29:07] character that are going to be
[29:08] expressive of future ages.
[29:11] And so the members in the church at
[29:13] Corenth, the church of Thessalonians,
[29:14] the church of Galatia, the churches in
[29:16] Macedonia, the seven churches which are
[29:18] in Asia, the members of these churches
[29:22] made up the members of the body of
[29:24] Christ, his church.
[29:26] &gt;&gt; Th this is what gave them this is what
[29:28] made them Christian churches. This is
[29:30] what made them different than a a
[29:32] Dungeons and Dragons Club or or a Call
[29:35] of Duty War Pod online or whatever
[29:36] they're called. There's it's something
[29:38] different uh than a discord group. This
[29:41] is they had they they were members of a
[29:44] larger more supernatural
[29:47] uh body
[29:49] &gt;&gt; and being members of that they were
[29:50] assembling together around that.
[29:53] &gt;&gt; Ephesians 5:30 says, "For we are members
[29:56] of his body, of his flesh, and of his
[29:58] bones."
[30:00] It's not just poetry. There's a certain
[30:02] reality to this that has to transcend
[30:04] even our physical reality that this is
[30:06] something very real. We are members of
[30:08] his body.
[30:12] &gt;&gt; In 1 Corinthians chapter 6:15,
[30:15] know you not that your bodies are the
[30:17] members of Christ? Shall I then take the
[30:20] members of Christ? Think through this
[30:21] very uh uh maybe more deeply later. And
[30:24] make them members of a harlot, God
[30:26] forbid. So the individuals are members
[30:29] of Christ.
[30:31] And as members of Christ, there there's
[30:33] a sanctity. There's a separation.
[30:35] There's an identity that comes with
[30:37] being a part of that body, that church.
[30:40] He says, "Shall I then make them members
[30:42] of a harlot?" He says, "God forbid I
[30:43] wouldn't do that."
[30:47] There'll be more time maybe spent on
[30:49] this particular concept. But notice how
[30:51] that whenever the members were baptized
[30:53] in his body, the individuals that become
[30:55] hermits and they all just disperse and
[30:57] disappear and they all go into their
[30:58] individual caves. I was thinking about
[31:00] it last week. This this sermon this
[31:02] sermon series might really really bug
[31:03] the the introverts
[31:06] who just really want to be alone and
[31:08] don't want to be a part of anything.
[31:11] But God made us
[31:14] to have a social need. What makes a lot
[31:16] of times in uh introverts is the
[31:19] disappointment in those things.
[31:21] &gt;&gt; True.
[31:22] &gt;&gt; And that it's it's not that they were as
[31:24] a little baby, you know, they like just
[31:25] leave me alone. Just shove a bottle
[31:27] under the door. I'll be fine. you know,
[31:29] and I'll I'll make do. But there's
[31:31] something that happens in life through
[31:33] some sort of scars and complexes and
[31:34] anxiety to where being an introvert
[31:36] sometimes is more of a protection
[31:38] mechanism than it is a thriving
[31:39] mechanism.
[31:41] &gt;&gt; I It's the downside of something. And
[31:44] all the introverts said,
[31:47] &gt;&gt; I got more amens than I thought I would
[31:49] get on that.
[31:51] Introverts identified.
[31:56] In Acts 8:es 1:3,
[32:00] this might be the reason to be an
[32:01] introvert. And Saul was consenting unto
[32:03] his death, the death of Steven. And at
[32:05] that time, there was a great persecution
[32:07] against the church, which was at
[32:09] Jerusalem. Now, notice how he's not
[32:11] saying the only real believers were in
[32:13] Jerusalem. Isn't it amazing how that
[32:15] spirit sometimes still thrives? Like,
[32:17] we're all going to have to move to Salt
[32:18] Lake or Lima,
[32:21] god forbid, or maybe Jeffersonville or
[32:22] something. You know, we're all going to
[32:23] have to end up in Johnson City
[32:24] eventually. There's uh it was just the
[32:27] church which was at Jerusalem. This is
[32:29] just the gathering of believers at
[32:31] Jerusalem, a church of Jerusalem and
[32:33] there's great persecution against that
[32:35] church and they were all scattered
[32:37] abroad throughout the regions of Judea
[32:39] and Samaria except the apostles. So
[32:41] notice as the persecution came against
[32:44] the church, it says they were all
[32:45] scattered. Who was scattered? The
[32:47] church.
[32:48] &gt;&gt; And the church is made up of members. So
[32:50] as one member suffered, they all
[32:52] suffered. As one member scattered,
[32:53] they're all being scattered. and the
[32:54] apostles remain behind. But it's Saul
[32:57] who's persecuting the church. And as
[33:00] their scatters, his devout men carried
[33:02] Steven to his burial and made great
[33:04] lamentation over him. As for Saul, he
[33:06] made havoc of the church. He's still
[33:10] pursuing them with papers, entered into
[33:12] every house and hailing men and women,
[33:14] committed them committed them to prison.
[33:17] This was persecution against the members
[33:19] of the church. But also it specifically
[33:24] targeted a location a certain group
[33:31] and they were the members are scattered
[33:32] from there.
[33:35] I want you to just very very simple this
[33:37] morning. There's the body of Christ and
[33:40] then there's churches that exist because
[33:44] of that church.
[33:46] But they they still have they have some
[33:48] they retain some character
[33:50] identification
[33:51] a a um a submission to that premier
[33:55] body.
[33:57] If you look at our text again, I'd like
[33:59] to walk through this
[34:01] and um and I think we'll there'll be
[34:03] enough enough in here to probably just
[34:05] end in these in these verses around here
[34:08] in Acts chapter 2 with verse 41.
[34:15] As Peter has preached his sermon
[34:18] and he tells them to repent and be
[34:20] baptized,
[34:22] save yourselves.
[34:24] It says in verse 41, then they that
[34:26] gladly received his word were baptized.
[34:30] What were they baptized in? In the name
[34:32] of Jesus Christ for the remission of
[34:34] sins. Going to say, what must we do? And
[34:36] he tells them, he preaches this sermon.
[34:37] It pricks their heart. This is their
[34:38] response to the word. as many as gladly
[34:40] received the word were baptized. And the
[34:42] same day there were added unto them
[34:44] about 3,000 souls. And they, notice this
[34:47] characteristic, they continued
[34:48] steadfastly
[34:50] in the apostles doctrine and fellowship
[34:53] and in breaking of bread and in prayers.
[34:56] This evening, we'll come back this
[34:57] afternoon. We'll come back to partake in
[35:00] this breaking of bread, communion.
[35:03] &gt;&gt; And to those that would argue that
[35:05] communion has ceased would have to argue
[35:06] upon that same basis that prayers have
[35:08] ceased.
[35:09] and maybe why their doctrine has ceased
[35:11] to be right and their fellowship has
[35:13] ceased. But they continued steadfastly
[35:15] in the apostles doctrine and fellowship.
[35:18] That word fellowship could have been
[35:19] translated to community. Actually has
[35:22] that meaning in the Greek that they
[35:24] continued in the apostles doctrine and
[35:26] community.
[35:28] They were united by something that was
[35:30] not uh geographic.
[35:34] It was not economic. It it wasn't
[35:37] social. If you were to say, well, it was
[35:40] it was certainly religious, but it began
[35:42] with the complete turning upside down of
[35:44] their religion.
[35:46] But in in in leaving that, they didn't
[35:48] become anti-Jews, anti-semmites.
[35:51] They didn't all of a sudden hate the
[35:53] temple and hate the priest and hate
[35:54] everything they were a part of. No,
[35:56] recognize this transition that when they
[35:59] received the Messiah, it fulfilled and
[36:02] vindicated everything they ever
[36:03] believed.
[36:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So they they didn't they didn't
[36:06] leave the Christian church in in type
[36:08] today that people become enlightened to
[36:10] Christ and they want to throw out the
[36:12] Bible and throw out everything else. No,
[36:14] it's the fulfillment of
[36:16] &gt;&gt; everything they all hoped for and they
[36:17] ever believed. And so they continued in
[36:19] synagogues. They conceded in fellowship
[36:21] because they their transition change
[36:23] wasn't an anti and against. It was this
[36:26] positive for
[36:30] &gt;&gt; and they what they shared was this. They
[36:33] continued steadfastly in a community
[36:35] because they were united by something
[36:36] greater.
[36:38] This church in Jerusalem, if we could
[36:40] identify this in scripture, was a local
[36:42] gathering of this larger community of
[36:44] Christ.
[36:46] This body of Christ, it begins to
[36:48] operate in a certain way through the
[36:50] book of Acts and these other chapters.
[36:51] You'll see want to just recognize this
[36:54] in other books in the New Testament that
[36:56] there was a connection amongst them. In
[36:59] Acts 14:23, it says, "And they had
[37:01] ordained them elders in every church."
[37:04] So now there's there's this connection.
[37:06] There's a responsibility. They're
[37:08] thinking beyond themselves. I believe as
[37:10] a church, we have a responsibility to
[37:12] support missionary works. A and to see
[37:15] that that that in in these lands that
[37:17] are are less fortunate or don't have as
[37:20] the means and they're undergoing
[37:22] difficult circumstances that we would
[37:23] support them. If they don't have an
[37:25] elder pastor, pray for them. I if
[37:27] there's ways that we could help in
[37:29] providing them resources and tools, we
[37:31] we want to be able to do that. And so
[37:32] they ordained them elders in every
[37:34] church. The next chapter and he went
[37:36] through Syria and Cissia confirming the
[37:39] churches. Notice how there there's this
[37:41] connection amongst all of them that they
[37:45] had. They shared something in common.
[37:48] In Colossians 4:16,
[37:51] this letter that he had written to the
[37:52] believers at Colossia, this church in
[37:54] Colossia says, "And when this epistle is
[37:56] read among you, cause it to be read also
[37:59] in the church of the Leodysans."
[38:03] Could you imagine just
[38:06] the the the woke virus in that day?
[38:09] Like, how dare you read a letter in
[38:10] church, right? And here he's telling
[38:13] them, go ahead and read read read my
[38:15] quotations and read my words in Colossia
[38:18] and then you know what? Make sure it's
[38:19] read in Leodysia church and then make
[38:22] sure that the one I wrote them is read
[38:24] in your church,
[38:25] &gt;&gt; right?
[38:26] &gt;&gt; People get all worked up about quoting
[38:28] things.
[38:30] I guess maybe uh they would have only
[38:32] been able to quote the Old Testament in
[38:34] the New Testament church.
[38:36] So when this epistle is read among you,
[38:38] notice this affinity, this connection.
[38:39] Read my letter. And as you read this
[38:41] letter, share it with this other church
[38:43] that it might be read at the church of
[38:44] the Leodysans. And then likewise read
[38:46] the letter that I wrote to them. Why?
[38:48] Because there's something about this
[38:49] ministry, about Paul's ministry, about
[38:51] what they were fellowshipping around,
[38:52] about what they were identified with
[38:54] where they had something in common.
[38:57] &gt;&gt; Peter writes in 1 Peter 1:1, Peter, an
[38:59] apostle of Jesus Christ, to the
[39:01] strangers scattered throughout Pontis,
[39:03] Galatia, Capidoshia, Asia, Bethnia. the
[39:07] strangers. Who are these ones?
[39:11] They are the believers,
[39:13] &gt;&gt; pilgrims and strangers because they no
[39:15] longer identify with their their most
[39:17] basic identification, their most common
[39:20] ground or the things that's most prec.
[39:21] They don't identify with the soil of
[39:23] Jerusalem. They don't identify with the
[39:25] hills of Judea. They don't identify with
[39:27] the with the world. They're now
[39:28] identified with something heavenly. And
[39:31] so now they're pilgrims and strangers
[39:33] scattered throughout these different
[39:34] regions. Amen.
[39:36] &gt;&gt; But yet they they have they have a
[39:38] connection.
[39:41] In 1 Corinthians chapter 16 19 it says,
[39:43] "The churches of Asia salute you.
[39:48] This is salutations. This is greetings.
[39:51] There's an honor that's being given."
[39:53] And and notice how Paul is able to
[39:55] convey that. The churches of Asia salute
[39:58] you. Aquilla and Priscilla salute you
[40:00] much in the Lord and with the church
[40:02] that is in their house.
[40:04] Churches are sending greetings to other
[40:06] churches. Christians are sending their
[40:07] greetings to one another.
[40:10] I I believe that we're living in a time
[40:12] when things become so political, things
[40:15] can become so toxic and you can be so
[40:17] discouraged and disappointed with so
[40:18] much that and
[40:21] maybe humor me a little bit, but
[40:23] wouldn't it just be nice to all move to
[40:24] Jackson, Wyoming and just start a cult,
[40:28] right? And if we could just maybe
[40:30] handpick those that follow. I don't
[40:31] know. but have a rigorous, you know,
[40:34] vetting process and an expelling process
[40:37] so we could keep the sanctity of our
[40:38] cult because there's so much nonsense
[40:40] that goes on everywhere. You just want
[40:42] to be like, I don't want to have
[40:43] anything to do with it.
[40:46] &gt;&gt; Should I get into all the WhatsApp
[40:48] groups I've had to leave?
[40:50] I don't want to have anything to do with
[40:51] it. This isn't fruitful. This isn't
[40:53] beneficial. This is wild. Now I just
[40:55] live vicariously through my son who's in
[40:57] some real spicy groups now and I'm here
[41:00] for it.
[41:03] Let me know your password. I want to get
[41:05] in them chats. Just want to read. Just
[41:07] want to read.
[41:09] &gt;&gt; But there was these greetings being
[41:10] shared. There was a connection. They
[41:12] they had to resist this urge to say, you
[41:14] know what? I don't we just need to, you
[41:16] know, tighten up, buckle up. Remember
[41:17] the great lie. How can we protect this
[41:19] truth?
[41:21] &gt;&gt; And there was this fear that they built
[41:23] walls and they and and all these
[41:25] barriers and they wanted to hide the
[41:27] truth and keep the truth and protect the
[41:29] truth. And the only thing that would do
[41:30] ultimately is just keep the truth from
[41:31] getting out.
[41:33] &gt;&gt; And then once they created these through
[41:35] these man-made controls, their own
[41:36] laboratory, then they could begin to
[41:38] pick at it without consequence, without
[41:40] accountability. And then you create the
[41:42] wrong kind of dynamic and it does become
[41:44] cultish and it does become uh man-led
[41:47] and man-overed. And then people get 30,
[41:49] 40 years down the road and all of a
[41:50] sudden their pastor declares himself to
[41:52] be Elohim. And they're all like, "You're
[41:55] God." God and they start worshiping him
[41:56] because they don't realize the slow boil
[42:00] &gt;&gt; because they get ostracized. They get
[42:01] separated. They get isolated. They're no
[42:03] longer part of this. They're no longer
[42:05] identified with the broader community.
[42:07] They've made their church the church.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; And here it says they had church in
[42:14] their house. It's not the building, but
[42:16] it's the purpose and the utility of what
[42:18] the gathering was for. In Colossians
[42:20] chapter 4:15,
[42:22] salute the brethren which are in
[42:23] Leodysia
[42:26] and Nephas and the church which is in
[42:28] his house. So there's a greetings to the
[42:30] brothers in Leodysia.
[42:32] Greetings to this brother who has church
[42:35] in his home. Greetings to the brother,
[42:36] salute, greetings, salutations, honor to
[42:39] those other Christians.
[42:41] Isn't it amazing how much uh the these
[42:44] things have been watered down to where
[42:46] many anymore we might not even call
[42:48] ourselves Christians.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; And the reason being maybe is because uh
[42:52] and I've even heard it said before. I
[42:54] was there one time when someone said,
[42:55] "Well, uh you know, you can trust him.
[42:57] He's a Christian." And immediately at
[42:58] that moment was like, "What you mean is
[43:01] I shouldn't trust him."
[43:03] Like I I don't I'm kind of stuck because
[43:06] if anyone in my family says, "Oh, you
[43:08] can trust him. He's a preacher." I'm
[43:09] like, "No, no, no, no, no. I'm sorry.
[43:12] He's a lawyer." No, no, no, no, no, no.
[43:16] &gt;&gt; There's You almost don't want to be
[43:18] identified anymore with these names, but
[43:20] really the the true reality of it.
[43:24] &gt;&gt; Are you a Christian?
[43:26] &gt;&gt; There should be something something that
[43:28] we honor in reverence about them.
[43:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; Salute the brethren which are in
[43:33] Leodysia. These Christian brethren in
[43:35] Fleiman 2, it says to the church in thy
[43:37] house. There's this these are individual
[43:40] churches. When Jesus says in Matthew 18,
[43:42] tell it unto the church. That means a
[43:44] brother in that church in Leodysia or
[43:47] the church in the house of Fiman or
[43:48] Nymphas that they would have been the
[43:50] ones to say in that church tell it to
[43:52] the church. They had their own ways that
[43:54] they would uh work out the relationships
[43:56] one with another. the way that they
[43:57] would uh approach communion and they
[44:00] would have they would have that local
[44:01] dynamic, but there was still this awe
[44:03] and this reverence of the the the
[44:06] fellowship
[44:08] of what Christ brought,
[44:11] &gt;&gt; his church, which is his body.
[44:15] And this these are the verses I've been
[44:16] studying at length. Acts chapter 2 43
[44:21] to 47.
[44:26] Did I Did I skip over that? Let me see
[44:28] if I got it out of order.
[44:31] Yeah, maybe I didn't. All right, you'll
[44:33] just have to do it with Can you handle
[44:35] being slideless, deckless for a moment?
[44:40] Acts 2:es 43-47.
[44:43] and fear came upon every soul.
[44:46] And many wonders and signs are done by
[44:48] the apostles.
[44:50] And all that believed
[44:53] were together
[44:55] and had all things common. So where we
[44:58] get our idea of commune,
[45:02] all things common. All that believed
[45:05] were together. All that believed in
[45:06] what? Christ as the Messiah were
[45:10] together. It means they agreed together.
[45:14] uh introverts breathe. Doesn't mean that
[45:16] they were always there, right?
[45:18] Boundaries, you know, it wasn't just
[45:20] always there, but they were they agreed
[45:22] together. It says, "And had all things
[45:26] common." And then this is the real this
[45:28] is where gets really nice. And sold
[45:32] their possessions and goods, imparted
[45:34] them to all men as every man had need.
[45:37] And and I wouldn't it be only right that
[45:40] if we all sold everything this year that
[45:43] you would want to take all those
[45:44] proceeds and give them to somebody at
[45:47] least one person who maybe is the I
[45:49] don't know maybe the pastor might be the
[45:51] one to oversee all that. Uh you can just
[45:54] deed the properties to me. Um I'll
[45:57] overlook it from there as we have need.
[46:02] This is where people start to get a
[46:03] little anxious.
[46:05] I'm exploring it from every avenue,
[46:06] legally, socially. What would the
[46:08] blowback be if everyone signed their
[46:10] deeds to me?
[46:12] They sold their possessions and goods
[46:14] and parted them to all men as every man
[46:16] had need. I think maybe that's a phrase
[46:18] to where they're like, just sell
[46:19] everything and we'll figure out the
[46:20] needs later. But as every man had need,
[46:22] they sold their possessions and goods
[46:25] and distributed them. So now there's
[46:26] this mutual care over one another. Just
[46:29] kind of catch catch these points. Had
[46:30] all things common. That means it was
[46:32] something all things common. belonging
[46:34] to all, owned or used jointly.
[46:37] Kind of goes against human nature these
[46:40] days with just how uh much society has
[46:43] advanced. Technology has allowed us to
[46:45] become less communal,
[46:47] &gt;&gt; less and less reliant and dependent upon
[46:49] a centralized uh social uh needs and
[46:52] resources. I mean, we can door dash
[46:55] everything. We can Amazon Prime
[46:57] everything.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; And so, we don't even have to leave our
[47:00] house to do anything.
[47:03] And it's true.
[47:05] &gt;&gt; And some have figured that out. Even in
[47:07] the clear prescription to go to church,
[47:10] they figured out that Zoom will suffice.
[47:13] Streaming will suffice. It It doesn't.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; It doesn't. That's why I do I do admire
[47:18] people that make the sacrifice to where
[47:20] if they're in a place where they don't
[47:21] like the church they're going to, they
[47:23] don't just sit around, they'll find a
[47:24] place where they can go to church.
[47:26] &gt;&gt; I admire that.
[47:30] [clears throat] Continuing. Now, if we
[47:32] continue this in verse 46,
[47:35] continuing daily with one accord,
[47:38] a phrase I'd like to come back to maybe
[47:41] Wednesday night or next Sunday, with one
[47:42] mind and one passion.
[47:47] Continue today with one accord in the
[47:49] temple. So, notice how there's not uh
[47:52] they're not establishing a new religion
[47:54] as much as this is the fulfillment of
[47:56] faith.
[47:58] breaking bread from house to house did
[48:00] eat their meat with gladness and
[48:01] singleness of heart, praising God and
[48:02] having favor with all people. And the
[48:04] Lord added to the church daily such as
[48:06] should be saved. Notice these the
[48:10] identified well say it this way. These
[48:13] things identified the character of this
[48:16] community of Christ. The character as he
[48:18] says of they say in the scripture this
[48:20] fellowship.
[48:22] And what I'd like to just leave with you
[48:24] in our remaining moments we have this
[48:26] morning. going to have several more
[48:27] scriptures to use, but they should be
[48:28] able to go very quickly.
[48:31] What produces this?
[48:35] Should we legislate that everyone sell
[48:37] their goods and and possessions and then
[48:40] we'll redistribute them? Anybody have
[48:41] some Bitcoin?
[48:43] You know, let's just divide it among
[48:44] every our church, if you're a member as
[48:46] of July. So, with the church, that's
[48:49] what we do. Let's market this that we
[48:50] have Bitcoin and anybody who's a record
[48:52] holder of church membership of a certain
[48:55] date will get a distribution event.
[48:59] That'll really pack the seats out
[49:03] there.
[49:04] How how could should it be legislated?
[49:08] You you have to have the same mind and
[49:10] the same passion. I like to golf and you
[49:12] should golf.
[49:14] What's the what how is this? How did
[49:17] they produce this? And I know maybe
[49:19] sometimes the instinct would be, well,
[49:21] they kind of are all the same people
[49:22] anyways. They just kind of change from
[49:24] one multi-level marketing program to
[49:26] another. And you know, this this just
[49:28] this is just how religion works. But
[49:29] there's something deeper that's
[49:30] happening.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; Notice in Acts 2:es 4-12.
[49:35] Verse four, it begins with this
[49:37] announcement that they were filled with
[49:38] the Holy Ghost. Those 120 gathered in
[49:40] the upper room and these as they were
[49:42] filled with the host, they began to
[49:44] speak with other tongues as the spirit
[49:46] gave them utterance. Now, there's a
[49:48] doctrine out there that says that the
[49:49] evidence of the Holy Ghost is speaking
[49:51] in tonesues. It's not scriptural because
[49:52] in the very people that teach that when
[49:54] they speak in tongues, they argue that
[49:57] Acts chapter 2 is the basis for it. But
[49:59] ain't nobody understanding what they're
[50:01] saying in their own language.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; But yet, they still use it as their
[50:04] justification as tongues being the
[50:06] evidence of the Holy Ghost. It's not
[50:07] scriptural. It says, "And there were
[50:09] dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men,
[50:12] notice this, out of every nation under
[50:14] heaven."
[50:16] that that has some significance there
[50:19] because now people from every nation in
[50:20] the world under heaven and and I think
[50:22] it gives some identification to say
[50:24] nation doesn't mean every city and every
[50:26] uh suburb. Now when it was noised abroad
[50:29] the multitude came together and were
[50:31] confounded. So as the as this the uh
[50:35] attraction begins to pick up steam and
[50:37] people hear and they come and they
[50:39] witness that every man heard them speak
[50:41] in his own language. the 120 are
[50:44] speaking in tongues, but now men from
[50:46] abroad, every nation under heaven. So,
[50:48] it wants you to begin to think in terms
[50:50] of different classes of people
[50:53] they heard. And so, they're not just uh
[50:56] they're they're not they're not speaking
[50:57] Hebrew. They are Jews in these other
[50:59] nations that would have learned and had
[51:00] a different tongue. There's at least 15
[51:02] different nations that are mentioned
[51:03] here, but they're men from every nation
[51:05] under heaven. They hear them speak in
[51:08] their own native tongue, several
[51:10] different languages. Some have said that
[51:11] maybe seven or eight different uh uh
[51:13] languages that are being spoken here. I
[51:16] had to skip right past the six seven and
[51:17] go seven eight because they heard them
[51:19] speak in their own language and they
[51:20] were all amazed and marveled saying one
[51:22] another behold are not all these which
[51:24] speak Galileans and how here we every
[51:26] man in her own tongue wherein we were
[51:28] born. So now it's not uh somebody who is
[51:32] raised in Jerusalem and they got
[51:34] promoted to a job and they got to go run
[51:35] a branch over here in in in Italy and so
[51:38] they're kind of a an expat who's over
[51:40] here and they're really an American at
[51:42] or Israelite at core and they're just
[51:44] trying to make do. No, they're born in
[51:46] that nation culturally, historically,
[51:48] their tongue, a lot of their different
[51:50] things, but yet they they have this
[51:51] religion and they return to uh Jerusalem
[51:54] for this day of Pentecost. And he says,
[51:56] "Now we begin to hear," and it says,
[51:57] notice these words, the parth
[51:59] Parththeians, the Mes, the Elimmites,
[52:01] the dwellers in Mesopotamia and in Judea
[52:03] and Capidoshia, in Pontis and Asia,
[52:05] Fersia, Panilia, in Egypt, in the parts
[52:08] of Libya about Sirene and strangers of
[52:10] Rome, Jews and procelites, cites and
[52:12] Arabians,
[52:14] all these different ones. We do hear
[52:16] them speak in our tongues the wonderful
[52:19] works of God.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; This is moving upon these people. And
[52:25] they were all amazed and were doubt
[52:26] saying one another, "What meanth this?"
[52:31] And it's all these Parthians and me and
[52:35] Elmites, these at Mesopotamia and Jud
[52:37] Judea, these are the ones that hear it.
[52:40] And it says, "What mean this?" This
[52:41] these are the ones that Paul begins to
[52:43] preach to.
[52:45] These are the ones that hear the sermon.
[52:48] And so how is it they were all brought
[52:50] together into and I know maybe there's a
[52:53] little bit of expansion of this to where
[52:55] they would have then uh uh these from
[52:57] other nations and other kingdoms uh
[52:59] having received this gospel at this
[53:01] time. How is it that they came together
[53:03] in the doctrine and fellowship of
[53:05] Christianity?
[53:08] Verse 41.
[53:14] Then they that gladly received his word
[53:17] were baptized.
[53:20] There's no there's no membership in the
[53:22] sense that if you just give me your name
[53:23] and your email addresses and pay and pay
[53:26] $50, you become a member or give us your
[53:28] phone number and you'll earn rewards for
[53:30] every time you come to church and then
[53:31] you can get 0.5% off on tithes or
[53:34] something like that where they, you
[53:35] know, they come up with some sort of
[53:36] formula just to get you to go. They that
[53:38] gladly received his word were baptized.
[53:41] if they gladly received his word. It
[53:42] says, "And were baptized, they did so in
[53:44] obedience to the word, be baptized in
[53:45] the name of Jesus Christ."
[53:48] &gt;&gt; And the same day there were added unto
[53:49] them about 3,000 souls.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; They that gladly received his word were
[53:55] baptized. This is the foundation of the
[53:57] community.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; This is they that believed on Christ and
[54:02] obeyed his word. Without that, without
[54:05] that there is no fellowship.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[54:09] They they could have had moments. They
[54:12] could have had gatherings. They they
[54:14] would have had to been certain
[54:15] parameters and certain dynamics put in
[54:17] place to where these are the rules that
[54:18] we abide by. This is the way things are
[54:20] done. This is what we expect and this is
[54:22] how we can expel you and kick you out.
[54:23] Listen, the body of Christ once you're
[54:25] baptized in it, nobody can remove you
[54:28] from it.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; And so, as there were members that
[54:31] gladly received his word and were
[54:32] baptized, that gave a sense of
[54:34] permanence to that movement, if we could
[54:37] call that. They weren't going to change.
[54:39] Say, you know, we decided that Jesus
[54:40] isn't the Christ. We believe Paul is the
[54:42] Christ. If they did that, what did they
[54:45] do? They changed their movements. They
[54:46] changed their church. They changed their
[54:48] identity. They changed their direction.
[54:50] And they continued together around
[54:52] carnal things. But the church, his body,
[54:55] was established when they gladly
[54:57] received the word and believed on Christ
[55:00] and obeyed him.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is this foundation in 1
[55:04] Corinthians 3:1. For other foundation
[55:06] can no man lay than that is laid, which
[55:08] is Jesus Christ.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; Matthew 16, upon this rock I will build
[55:13] my church.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; It's the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; His church is built on the revelation of
[55:20] Jesus Christ.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; And if the church is built on the
[55:25] revelation of Jesus Christ, the most
[55:28] necessary element for every member of
[55:30] his church, it's the prerequisite. You
[55:32] cannot be a member of his body unless
[55:35] you've received the personal revelation
[55:37] of Jesus Christ.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ revealed to you. That is
[55:40] the new birth.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; That is what must be preached. Not not
[55:44] to recite a saying, I receive the Lord
[55:46] Jesus Christ as my personal savior.
[55:48] that that's not that that's that's not a
[55:51] it's not just a script that we read, but
[55:53] it's a genuine face-to-face meeting
[55:55] wherein the Holy Spirit gives you a new
[55:57] birth that makes you a member of his
[56:00] body permanently.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; And so to be added to the church, you
[56:06] have to be have the same foundational
[56:08] experience as the church itself had.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:12] 1 Corinthians 12:18 he says but now hath
[56:15] God set the members every one of them in
[56:18] the body as if that ple as it hath
[56:20] pleased him.
[56:22] It's in that chapter that he says by one
[56:25] spirit we're all baptized into one body
[56:28] according to as it hath pleased God.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; It's the individuals that make up his
[56:34] body and individuals with that
[56:36] experience are what ideally makes up a
[56:40] church. Amen.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; You realize what kind of gathering it
[56:43] would be if we just abolished the
[56:45] doctrine of the new birth
[56:47] &gt;&gt; or just changed it ever so slightly and
[56:48] kept people from it.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; It does become a lodge.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; It does become a social club.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; It it it no longer becomes what the
[56:57] scriptures envisioned it to be. We can
[56:59] just rally around intellectual concepts
[57:01] and theology and doctrine and say,
[57:02] "Well, do you believe this? Well, do you
[57:04] believe this? Do you believe this? Oh,
[57:05] you don't believe this? Maybe you should
[57:08] think about joining another club.
[57:11] and we distill it down to where that's
[57:13] it becomes very easily attainable
[57:15] markers.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; Just say that I'm right and you can be a
[57:18] part of this church. We can all just say
[57:20] that he's but the real mark of a
[57:22] Christian is a new birth experience.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; The real foundation of any healthy
[57:27] church is people who have that
[57:28] experience
[57:31] &gt;&gt; because God sets every member in the
[57:34] body as it pleases him. By one spirit
[57:36] we're baptized into the body of Christ.
[57:38] Therefore, it's the individuals who
[57:40] receive the same foundational experience
[57:42] that make up his church and that become
[57:44] members of a church.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; As I close, if I could say it this way,
[57:48] Christ was the beginning.
[57:50] He's the beginning of that body. He's
[57:54] the beginning and basis of the community
[57:55] that I'm talking when I use this phrase
[57:57] if it seems to be maybe a modern phrase
[57:59] and it's kind of like a a buzzword. He's
[58:01] the beginning and the basis of this
[58:04] community, this fellowship, the body of
[58:06] Christ, the church.
[58:08] And Christ,
[58:11] the spirit of Christ, if I can say even
[58:14] this new birth and his church that you
[58:16] become a part of are divinely designed
[58:18] as it have pleased God. He's put you in
[58:20] the body. They're divinely designed to
[58:22] meet the needs of every Christian
[58:25] &gt;&gt; of every Christian. God has designed it
[58:28] such I think this is the attitude that
[58:30] we should take that when God has
[58:31] baptized me into the body and I'm a
[58:33] partaker of that spirit and I'm eating
[58:35] of that bread. This is the supernatural
[58:36] side. This is that that body of Christ
[58:40] which is unassalable that the gates of
[58:41] hell cannot prevail against it. When I'm
[58:43] a part of it, God promises to sustain
[58:45] me, promises to feed me, promises to
[58:47] lead me. He gives me the inside teachers
[58:49] to bring me into truth and bring things
[58:51] to my remembrance. That's the benefits
[58:52] of being in that body. And then there's
[58:54] also this church that God then raises up
[58:57] in all sorts of different locations with
[58:59] different dynamics and different ways
[59:00] that they do things, but it serves the
[59:03] members of that body.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. And through this dynamic, God
[59:07] wants every need you have to be
[59:09] addressed.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; Does that mean we can get Bitcoin this
[59:13] year, Brother Aaron? Well, if it fall,
[59:15] the price falls low enough, might be
[59:18] able to pull that off.
[59:20] But the point is, God has designed it
[59:24] this way.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; People get in trouble when they they
[59:29] stay out of church.
[59:32] That's why I admire people who when they
[59:34] find themselves in a situation where
[59:36] they're out of fellowship, they they
[59:37] find they try to find it somewhere.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's true.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; We've benefited from that.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; They want to be a part of they want to
[59:44] be a part of something where people love
[59:45] the Lord and the spirit of God is moving
[59:47] and the word is being preached and they
[59:48] want to be a part of that. And they may
[59:49] not realize it's a design and a desire
[59:52] within the heart of a believer.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; When David said, "I was glad when they
[59:56] said unto me, let us go into the house
[59:57] of the Lord." He knew there'd be other
[59:58] people there. So, he wasn't trying to go
[1:00:01] to get away.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; I'm going to find my little booth and
[1:00:04] hide in there. No, there was there was
[1:00:06] this anticipation of like-minded people.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; In Ephesians 4 11-13,
[1:00:16] his spirit ascends, he sends down gifts
[1:00:18] and he gave some apostles and some
[1:00:20] prophets and some evangelists and some
[1:00:21] pastors and teachers.
[1:00:24] What What are these gifts? What are some
[1:00:25] these gifts are given for the church?
[1:00:29] Amen.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; Because it says, "And for the perfecting
[1:00:30] of these saints," notice this language,
[1:00:32] Christ, there's no other foundation that
[1:00:34] can be laid except Jesus Christ. And now
[1:00:37] Christ gives gifts. And these gifts are
[1:00:42] identified with individual ministries,
[1:00:44] prophets, apostles, evangelists,
[1:00:46] pastors, teachers. What What are they
[1:00:47] for? What are they for? To lift up
[1:00:49] somebody else for the perfecting of the
[1:00:51] saints,
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; for the work of the ministry, for the
[1:00:53] edifying of the body of Christ. These
[1:00:55] are things that are happening. Christ
[1:00:57] being the foundation of the church. Now
[1:00:58] the body of Christ is being edified till
[1:01:00] we all come individual members come in
[1:01:02] the unity of the faith
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; and of the knowledge of the son of God
[1:01:06] unto a perfect man unto the measure of
[1:01:08] the stature of the fullness of Christ.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; The purpose of this community at large,
[1:01:13] this church, his church, the purpose of
[1:01:16] the h the body of Christ, was that each
[1:01:18] member would edify each other.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; The effectual working as Paul begins to
[1:01:22] talk about gives edification to itself.
[1:01:24] Speaking the truth in love. There's a
[1:01:26] way that we're all growing because the
[1:01:27] purpose of the community is the unity of
[1:01:29] the faith and the knowledge of Christ
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; to aid in the the building and the
[1:01:34] shaping and the growing of the Christian
[1:01:36] into the measure of Jesus Christ, not
[1:01:39] the measure of the ideal church member
[1:01:42] of Arizona Believer's Church.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; Like if I would have you look a certain
[1:01:47] way, I'd want you to dress like my wife.
[1:01:51] And if you want your example of how to
[1:01:52] dress, dress like my wife. Oh, I I mean,
[1:01:57] no, don't do that. I mean, that'd be
[1:01:59] weird.
[1:02:01] You know,
[1:02:05] it's not the that that's not what's
[1:02:06] being lifted up. That the image is
[1:02:08] Christ.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; It's true.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; And I believe this is a critical
[1:02:14] principle that's key to fulfilling
[1:02:18] our need for community.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; You have that need. If that need's not
[1:02:24] being met, you'll try to find it.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; That's true. And
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; so I would say this, even as a church,
[1:02:28] if we fail to recognize that you have a
[1:02:32] a a need, a deep need for social
[1:02:35] connection, well, you just need to be
[1:02:37] born again. Come for the word and the
[1:02:40] word only. We're going to make it as dry
[1:02:42] as we can make it just to make sure
[1:02:44] nobody's here for personality.
[1:02:47] Make sure you're here for all the right
[1:02:48] reasons. We're going to get We're going
[1:02:50] to No more song service.
[1:02:54] that there there's we don't try to we're
[1:02:56] not going to try to make it hard on you
[1:02:57] to come,
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; but we certainly don't want to make it
[1:03:00] easy for you to come for all the wrong
[1:03:01] reasons,
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; Anybody say, "Don't worry, brother
[1:03:04] Aaron. If you got a problem, you may be
[1:03:06] a little bit on the other side.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; But the point is there is a there is a
[1:03:10] need. There's a need that we have. Our
[1:03:12] children have that need. If they begin
[1:03:14] to feel a little left out, they don't
[1:03:15] feel apart, then they're going to have
[1:03:16] they're going to try to find that place
[1:03:18] where say, I I like being around these
[1:03:19] people." And trust me, there's going to
[1:03:21] be groups and identities and platitudes
[1:03:24] and movements and all sort of things
[1:03:26] that are going to try to begin to work
[1:03:27] on them solely from the standpoint of
[1:03:29] trying to create common ground.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; And they may find it, but that will
[1:03:35] never fully satisfy the need you have
[1:03:39] socially because it bypasses the most
[1:03:42] critical principle
[1:03:44] that Christ was the beginning.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; And that's what holds this church
[1:03:48] together.
[1:03:50] That's what we should rally around.
[1:03:51] That's what we must come back to.
[1:03:52] Because when we have a church full of
[1:03:54] different families and different
[1:03:55] backgrounds, different desires,
[1:03:56] different favorite teams, different
[1:03:57] favorite foods, all these different
[1:03:58] things that we like to do, and somehow
[1:04:00] we kind of all show up and how is it we
[1:04:02] get along really at the end of the day,
[1:04:04] the reason why, this is for the the
[1:04:05] young people, the reason why your
[1:04:06] parents get along
[1:04:09] is is not because we enjoy the same
[1:04:11] video games,
[1:04:13] though we do. I'm assuming maybe perhaps
[1:04:17] not because we all eat at Ritos and you
[1:04:19] should
[1:04:22] not because we all drive Teslas or we
[1:04:24] all are Cardinals fans. Woohoo. Right.
[1:04:28] That's not what make that's they may
[1:04:30] have a lot of things that we get along
[1:04:31] in but at the end of the day there's
[1:04:32] this love that we have for the word.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; And what I love about the friendships I
[1:04:37] have in this church is it's never hard
[1:04:39] to come to that.
[1:04:41] We talk about a lot of things,
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; but it's never hard to come back to the
[1:04:45] word
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; because at the end of the day, that is
[1:04:48] what brings us together.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; And recognize this and maybe maybe the
[1:04:52] burden will just be shared in this very
[1:04:54] this very moment. Recognize this that if
[1:04:56] your children don't have that same
[1:04:58] experience,
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; they're not having the same connection
[1:05:01] with each other
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; that we as adults have with one another.
[1:05:06] Therefore, we have to be ever so
[1:05:08] conscious of what kind of things we lift
[1:05:11] up, what kind of things we allow to have
[1:05:12] the preeminence, the kind of things that
[1:05:14] we whether you say support or promote on
[1:05:16] the things that we now begin to focus
[1:05:18] our children on because I don't want to
[1:05:20] force them to be friends with Elliott.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not trying not trying to force
[1:05:26] them to get along with certain people,
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; but to find that heart of Christ which
[1:05:30] would allow you to see the need in
[1:05:32] others, to have a deeper love for
[1:05:34] others, a connection that transcends
[1:05:36] whether or not we all like Minecraft or
[1:05:37] whether or not we all like sports or
[1:05:38] whether or not we all like to do this or
[1:05:40] whether or not we all have the same
[1:05:41] social economic class. Those things
[1:05:43] begin to lose their distinction when the
[1:05:45] love of God begins to have the
[1:05:46] preeminence. Amen.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; I believe that the strength of any
[1:05:50] church is this common experience of
[1:05:52] individuals who have met Jesus Christ
[1:05:53] face to face.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; And that because we'll explore this
[1:05:57] maybe in greater detail that becomes the
[1:05:59] foundation of community.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; Let's stand together. Musicians if you
[1:06:04] could come to your instruments.
[1:06:07] I appreciate you allowing me the
[1:06:08] opportunity today just to begin to
[1:06:09] express my heart on this subject matter
[1:06:15] and trust that the Lord will give us a a
[1:06:16] greater vision as leaders in our home in
[1:06:19] our families as individuals. I want
[1:06:21] there to be more ways that you can feel
[1:06:22] a part of the church recognizing that
[1:06:27] you you do have um a social need and
[1:06:30] maybe we don't we might not have a lot
[1:06:32] of young people or young couples or even
[1:06:35] u older adults that are similarly
[1:06:36] situated but there's ways that I believe
[1:06:39] our church can work together
[1:06:42] to
[1:06:44] build community and then the the more
[1:06:47] that we are able to
[1:06:50] grow in these things, the better
[1:06:53] prepared we are to reach others in a
[1:06:56] different community of Phoenix [music]
[1:06:59] and and other needs that exist in the
[1:07:02] and other common areas. So God God uses
[1:07:04] I I want our church to be an opportunity
[1:07:07] for other young people in the state of
[1:07:08] Arizona [music] to be edified, to be
[1:07:10] encouraged, to be strengthened. No
[1:07:12] designs on trying to grow our church
[1:07:14] membership or uh get ourselves some
[1:07:16] likes on Instagram. No, the desire is
[1:07:18] that this basis Christ could be lifted
[1:07:23] up.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; Lord, help us to do that. If you need
[1:07:25] prayer today, just bow your heads, lift
[1:07:26] your hands. I think the sermon can hit
[1:07:28] home in a many different ways, but we'll
[1:07:30] pray for you. Our gracious heavenly
[1:07:32] father, today, Lord, as we close this
[1:07:34] service, we're desirous that your Holy
[1:07:37] Spirit would turn these things over in
[1:07:39] our hearts. Lord, I would say that such
[1:07:42] an attentive audience today, Lord,
[1:07:44] [music] were listening.
[1:07:47] They weren't falling asleep. They
[1:07:49] weren't daydreaming. They were
[1:07:50] listening.
[1:07:52] So, these words have registered in their
[1:07:54] minds. But now, Lord, may it just begin
[1:07:56] to turn over into their hearts. May
[1:07:58] there be a a quickening, an
[1:08:00] understanding. [music]
[1:08:02] And Lord, I pray that as we have been
[1:08:04] given this precious opportunity to be a
[1:08:07] part of something beyond ourselves,
[1:08:09] beyond our individual family,
[1:08:12] that we could treasure
[1:08:14] your church, your body, that we're not
[1:08:16] alone,
[1:08:18] [music] and better understand this
[1:08:20] dynamic of a support body, a local body.
[1:08:24] Just as there was dozens of church
[1:08:27] churches that existed in the days of the
[1:08:29] New Testament being written, Lord, today
[1:08:31] we exist in a world where we're not the
[1:08:34] only church that's right. We're not the
[1:08:35] only church in Arizona that's got it
[1:08:37] right. Lord, we exist only because there
[1:08:40] are genuine members of the body of
[1:08:42] Christ that live in Arizona. If they
[1:08:45] weren't here, Lord, we wouldn't want to
[1:08:46] be here [music] unless you called us to
[1:08:48] be a a mission or an outreach or an
[1:08:51] evangelist. But Lord, you didn't call
[1:08:52] this church to just be a mission to get
[1:08:54] people off the streets. You've called us
[1:08:57] to lead
[1:08:59] your people in [music] this end time
[1:09:01] according to your word, speaking the
[1:09:02] truth and love, that they would grow up,
[1:09:04] not just be introduced to Jesus of the
[1:09:05] Bible, not just be introduced to the red
[1:09:07] letter, not just accept Christ as their
[1:09:08] savior, but they could grow up into you
[1:09:10] in all things.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; So Lord, we have a responsibility to
[1:09:14] that body.
[1:09:16] And Lord, may we not be so arms length
[1:09:19] and distant that believers are trying to
[1:09:22] find that sense of family and community
[1:09:24] outside [music]
[1:09:25] of the family and community they share
[1:09:27] in the word at this church. And may give
[1:09:28] us a vision. Lord, as [music] pastor, as
[1:09:30] a family in this church, Lord, help me
[1:09:32] to understand better how we could meet
[1:09:33] the needs of the people. Lord, I don't
[1:09:36] believe in a social gospel and I don't
[1:09:38] believe that people should solely come
[1:09:39] for social reasons. But Lord, I do
[1:09:41] realize that as parents come to church
[1:09:43] for the word, there can be teenagers who
[1:09:46] come who have not fully experienced the
[1:09:47] depths of your word. And Lord, they have
[1:09:50] to be met where they are. So Lord, may
[1:09:54] we have a grace and patience in our
[1:09:55] hearts that creates the right [music]
[1:09:56] kind of atmosphere.
[1:09:59] It's able to encourage the right things
[1:10:00] with our young people so that they feel
[1:10:02] heard and seen and loved.
[1:10:05] Lord, if we're to make our homes at a
[1:10:07] certain point a happy place where our
[1:10:09] children want to be there, Lord, then I
[1:10:10] believe church should be that way. Not
[1:10:12] that we would compromise in our home.
[1:10:14] Therefore, Lord, we would never
[1:10:15] compromise in the church, but let us not
[1:10:16] become cold and formal and indifferent
[1:10:18] and legalistic.
[1:10:21] Let us not try to become so wild that we
[1:10:23] just want to attract young people and
[1:10:24] hold them. So, Lord, it's no no holds
[1:10:26] barred and anything goes and so we just
[1:10:28] try to be cool. But Lord, may we just
[1:10:30] find that heart,
[1:10:32] that perfect [music] balance.
[1:10:35] Bless us today, Lord, as we approach the
[1:10:37] feet washing and communion this evening.
[1:10:40] Be with us, Father. [music] So, we'll be
[1:10:42] dismissed so families can go and take
[1:10:44] part in their lunch and the different
[1:10:46] things that they have need of, but Lord,
[1:10:47] may we [music] return this afternoon and
[1:10:49] enjoy your presence with one another. We
[1:10:52] love you and we [music] ask all this in
[1:10:53] the name of Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
