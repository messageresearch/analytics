TRANSCRIPT
========================================
amen just feels so good in the house of the Lord tonight as compliment to the song leaders the musicians and all of you just appreciate it I I'm going to start uh right where we were leaving off actually I'll give a little bit of a review from Sunday but we're going to continue on a mortgaged home this is part two I didn't anticipate a part two on this uh and the thought is as we've been talking about my home is not for sale or selling our homes and the house is the structure but then we could somehow forfeit and give up our rights to the home the feeling such as the woman did in the garden uh and that's a parallel to our lives now where we can still have something or some structure or some appearance or some of the the things that would uh give us shelter and give us a sense of belonging but then we could somehow forfeit all that and sell it so that we lose our home and I'm wanting to look at it from a little bit different side to where we may not be able to we may not completely sell the home but we can just mortgage it in other words it's leaned by somebody we owe or we've done something in our transacting to where it's burdened it's a we've given it up as security um to have something in the world so we're building on the concept of a home mortgage and how the in that typical transaction you're offering up your house as a security uh for a loan so there's a debt owed and that's how most of us are able to afford a home I was looking at just the debt statistics here recently and still a mortgage is the greatest debt that most people carry and we realize that there's uh hopefully some equity in that or there's some um some worth in the thing that is mortgaged or secured but it's still the concept of getting having something leaned and in that transaction but kind of looking at it in terms of spiritually what types of transactions are we entering into as Believers um or in that we mortgaging our home life where we owe the bank we owe the world we owe Satan we owe somebody else something and we've had to give up the security of our home or our home as a security in order to secure what the world wanted to give us uh brother bam writes this and referring to the Le Dean age and this answer of God come by of me um gold tried in the fire and and white rment you'll be clothed in eyes Saab so you can see he says come to me and buy it is evident from this phrase bu of me that the Le Dean church is not at all dealing with Jesus for the spiritual products of the kingdom of God their transactions cannot be spiritual they may think they are spiritual but how can they be now in terms of transactions being spiritual we know that there a a church context there's a church World context there's maybe a religious context to this and I'm not just trying to blow past that or I'm certainly not trying to change the meaning where brother B saying that they build schools and they're missionaries and they have churches and they do a lot of religious things and a lot of great works but yet their hearts are far from them they're not going to Christ and exchanging uh as he says their spiritual products are not dealing with Jesus Christ and if if that's a concept in a religious way I'm wanting just to borrow that same principle and say what about just in daily life and living and and interacting with the world and these other things that aren't so much the religious side but in the living side of things and the practicality how are our transactions not spiritual and a transaction is a negotiated agreement uh it's the management of an affair or it could be a settlement of an affair and kind of in that word to trans to cross something or to go beyond or through a and a gear which is that to set into motion to drive forward so when there's a transaction you accomplish something or you perform or drive or carry through uh you come to a settlement so when he says that their transactions cannot be spiritual their drive is not spiritual their accomplishments aren't spiritual their settlements are not spiritual so their motivation at the end of the day what they're trying to accomplish is not spiritual I think that's a real real key that if their transactions are not spiritual uh what they're settling on what they're agreeing to what they're accomplishing what their Drive is is not spiritual and we could say that character is not valued at the end of the day that they're not looking for character they're not looking for uh those things of character and honesty and integrity or Holiness that those are not the things that are pursued because their transactions not being spiritual they're not pursuing the real spiritual things the things that ought to be valued but they pursue gain riches consumption and when we speak of riches it speaks of wealth or gain might be a word just to accumulate it all together but it's not just merely money but it's whatever a capital or whatever assets or whatever bartering or exchange uh whether you're using uh Karma or clout or whatever it is you're trying to use to gain things from the world it's just those transactions that are trying to bring you gain and let's just say this that if you are dealing with Jesus Christ uh for these products of the kingdom of God those spiritual transactions will never mortgage your home life they'll only enhance it they'll only strengthen it the Bible says in Proverbs 23:23 buy the truth and sell it not so for pursuing anything this is the remedy to the L Deen condition buy of me gold tried in the fire buy of me rment that you might be clothed By Me isav In order to see all those things are found in Christ so if you come to Christ for your spiritual dealings if you come to Christ for the products of the kingdom of God then in doing those transactions it won't be a detriment to your personal life it won't be a detriment to your family life it won't be a detriment to your professional life even if you lose your job even if you don't get a promotion because God's going to be watching out over that and looking out after that to get to take care of you when you stand for the kingdom of God when these things are being added to you in a spiritual way it puts you in the best position to succeed because I'm going to buy the truth and sell it not and this is by wisdom instruction and understanding these are all materials to build up the home life materials to build up the home materials to build your testimony so that you leave the right kind of Legacy and the things that Christ says to come and by Revelation the Holiness the character they're all worth investing in right they're all worth investing in and and I I think of it now it's speaking about Revelation and again I just acknowledge that you all remember this better than me but in 2021 we ministered on Revelation re Revol resolves whatever it was then resolves complication and and Revelation is what's going to resolve all the complications we see in this world now it's not maybe solve the complication but it resolves it for us we can see the complexities we can understand that God's working for our good and so I've touched a lot on this before and I'd venture to say that most of us weren't here when we did it uh but so it's worth and it but yet it's still worth repeating I know sometimes we can be critical of ministers ah they already preached that before oh they already preached that before well brother brandham preached some sermons a dozen times and oftentimes just repeating in the same way now I'm not claiming to be like brother brandham but just be careful with your criticisms because you might you might be creating a template that condemns you or condemns somebody else you don't mean to and if I'm getting old and seen Nile and I just keep repeating myself over and over again that would be one problem but repeating the word as it is necessary I I don't think there's a problem with that so we want to uh we want to buy the truth sell it not wisdom instruction and understanding these are things that we must transact in and these spiritual transactions are sure Investments you're going to get the right kind of return on this there there's no there should be no fear that you're it's going to end out as a negative for you when you invest in these things CU these spiritual transactions are not detriments they're not predition they're not destruction but they're they're they're establishing and strengthening and supporting to invest in these things in 1 Timothy chapter 6 we'll read to verse uh verse 6 to 10 and I I could be pulled right into this to try to break it down like we did last time but I want to reset it to go forward I'm I'm trying to finish Sunday's service first so that um if we can't finish tonight's we can just move it to but godliness with contentment is great gain not just worldly gain not just appearing to be successful because as he's saying these evil sisers uh because they were wealthy or because they Rich because they had big congregations they had a following or they appeared to have things put together they kind of trusted in the appearance of things as being godliness but he's saying no godliness with contentment is actually the gain you don't you can't back into that I'm rich so it must be godliness but rather godliness with contentment is great gain for we brought nothing into this world and it is certain we can carry nothing out and having food and rment let us therewith be content what a a simple summary of what we ought to be content with as we emphasized on Sunday having the Necessities having what you need to be who God's called you to be in your calling we should be content with that and not be restless to move beyond that but they that will be rich who long and desire and covet after the gain of the world fall into temptation and a snare and in many foolish and hurtful lust which drown men in destruction and predition so the the to be greedy for gain to lust after the things of the world to always be interested and procuring or consuming is a snare or a trap that if we fall into it causes hurtful uh um hurtful lust and many foolish lust that drown Us in destruction so this is something that we all should be on guard for is how the world tries to tempt us and get us into these types of transactions so it says For the Love of Money is the root of all evil it's a large phrase that could we could spend a lot of time on and I know there's still maybe greater depths that we could all understand this in and we we pray for that we ask for God to give us revelation we want to understand the word in a better way but we can catch it enough tonight to say the love of money is the root of all evil not just money but it's that inordinate affection towards it the unreasonable emphasis on it the Reliance the trust in it is the root of all evil which are some coveted after now I I want to come to this later in that this is kind of the nature of this gain the nature of riches and wealth that when you have it or when you begin to covet after it it has a pull it has an influence and and it causes you it says to air from the faith and Pierce yourselves through with many Sorrows so we ought not to Value the gain of this world but rather godliness should be valued godlikeness to be in the character of Christ those are the things that we ought to treasure things we ought to pursue uh Christ is the most important thing he is the most important this word is the most important but then on the other side you have the flesh that's pulled to have and to enjoy and to experience and to use the resources we have to enjoy great things and maybe it is to kind of keep up with other people because they go on vacations and they do this and they do that and they have this and they have that and we feel like we're missing out so there's a lot of uh heris in our lives a lot of things that take place in our hearts where we're comparing and we're pulled and we're jealous and we want to experience and let's just acknowledge we live in a world where we're constantly being bombarded with information from friends from Family from social media from the news internet all sorts of Publications that try to pray on our desire to have to enjoy and to be accepted and to belong and experience things and so it pulls on this other side of us where we can be have foolish lust and we can uh not be content with the things that we have and and Pierce ourselves through with many Sorrows so the proverb writes the writer says in Proverbs 15 ver 27 he that is greedy of gain this overe eagerness to be rich this extreme desire for wealth and and material gain troubles his own house so this to me is just perfect language for what we're trying to talk about in the house of the Lord and ourselves being uh identified in that our families and even our church that if you're greedy for gain I mean even as a church if we just want to we want to grow our numbers and we want to get bigger and we want to have better and we want to do this well that that troubles the church because because if we're if we're growing if we're increasing in numbers the wrong way I would say we're swelling not growing amen it's like a dead carcass just bloating right and I don't I wouldn't want to grow that way as a church and say oh my we're bursting at the seams like a dead corpse just bloating just rotting in this Phoenix heat and so it's not we're not just looking for gain and have better this and better that you look at the spiritual needs and I promise you I believe in all with all my heart that if we put Christ first as individual and in our families and we feel that we're together as a church here and we not just focus on church and getting ahead and building a building and all these different things but just put first Christ and all the other things that we should whether it be our giving and whether it be our attendance and all those things that this will take care of itself it God will provide and he won't give us more than we need and he certainly wouldn't hold back those things that are necessary from us so we can just find that pocket and stay in it and know that God will bless us but if we get pulled out it troubles our house when we're greedy for gain but he that hateth gift shall live and all the mothers said don't take it leral that gifts is a bribe he that hates gifts shall live in other words he'll Prosper he'll do well he'll succeed because he will not let worldly gain compromise his discernment he will not engage in a transaction that is meant to cause him to turn his eye or me him to compromise these gifts are bribes that are paid in order to change a person's Jud judgement so greed makes us vulnerable to wrong decisions makes us vulnerable to enticements to traps to oh man all I got to do is just cheat a little bit as a contractor just cheat a little bit I can make a little bit more money and it will make decisions we otherwise would never make but when we get in a position where we feel like we need more money I need this to make it work we start cheating I'm trying to remember uh well I think my brother Manuel it might have been you that said it that when we don't pay our ties because we're in a financial pickle says you're putting more faith in that 10% than you are in God who can take care of the situation if you didn't pay your ties uh uh uh because you had bills to pay or your debt was really really difficult no matter what that amount is you're saying that your tithe holding that back was greater than trusting God to take care of your financial problem just put that on repeat that was powerful you said that right yeah he needs all the credit we'll pay loyalties on that and and so there's a uh that when we make those kind of transactions are are we're not making the right kind of spiritual decisions so it says he that hateth gifts shall live there's it's a it's a mindset that is going to be aware and conscious of transactions we make that exhibit a trust in worldly things and not in God I can't remember where I C came across the saying but it's in response to to these scriptures I'm using it's not the man who has too little but the man who craves more that is poor it's not the man that has too little but the man who craves more that is poor and when you look at it that way there's a lot of rich people who are the poorest people on Earth it's not us if we have little that doesn't that's not what makes us poor but it's wanting more than we have and being dissatisfied what we with what we have That's What Makes a Man Poor we referred to the siren song of the world the Temptation a siren song is a call an urement from the world or really maybe in any situation it's used um in the sense that a siren song is a Temptation that's difficult to resist and it leads to harm it's detrimental use the example of Odysseus who's had to tie himself to the Mast of a ship and his rowers put his soldiers put wax in their ears and covered their ears lest they be tempted by the song of the sirens and how orus played his harp louder than the singing it was a way to drown out the siren song and the world is constantly singing to us a siren song that's trying to provoke the love of money to be greedy for gain the Allure of riches to have to possess to experience and I'm not sure if we used this oh yes we did we used it I think we pretty much closed on this so it's taken me a good 20 minutes just to get to where we want to be tonight Proverbs 11:28 and 29 he that trusteth in his riches shall fall when Paul is talking about they that be rich he's saying charge the them a certain way that they have a certain mindset because he doesn't want them to trust in their richest because the Bible teaches us that he who trusts and has confidence in and feels secure by his riches he shall fall but the righteous shall flourish as a branch it's amazing how it doesn't seem well to to trust in W riches is a characteristic of a wicked person right because notice it doesn't say he that trusteth in riches shall fall but the poor who don't will flourish or he that doesn't trust in riches will flourish he's just saying the one that trust in riches he's going to fall but the righteous the righteous should not trust in W riches because that's what the wicked do the wicked witches of riches almost fell into a lisp there so I just have to get it out or it'll come back the righteous shall flourish as a branch he that troubleth his own house because he that troubles his own house is the one that's greedy for gain who trust in riches shall inherit the wind and the fool shall be servant to the wise of heart that's simple uh this the the fool the the the those that lack Discerning discernment saying then the one that trusts in riches the one who's greedy for gain he's going to get what's coming to him but then it says the wise of heart that it's usually the fool who becomes servant to the wise he that trusteth in riches trust him for What happiness trust in for security for their portion for your possession when we trust in gain and riches and wealth he says that troubles our house that causes us to fall now I hope that we're kind of at a spot where the things I'm about to share will make some sense because we were skipping we skipped a lot of this and it may I hope that it it makes sense in this context Paul is cautioning against greed the Proverbs are cautioning against greed and greed causes us to overvalue things it'll cause us to overvalue Goods or possessions it'll cause us to overvalue Recreation it'll cause us to over value things that we enjoy and though I don't know that I'll touch on this very much but when you overvalue something or you place greater emphasis on it or you get in a spot where you feel like you have to have it it also begins to corrupt to where it leads to shortcuts leads to dishonesty uh we want to get rich quickly because we need to get rich to get the things we want so not willing to be patient and work hard and do it honestly and build yourself to a place where you can enjoy certain things we're always looking for shortcuts and so greed causes us to overvalue to overp pursue and then it can corrupt our character that's the premise but God wants us to have the wisdom of self-control that in our lives it's not that oh man I really want this and I really want that that's not like oh man you must be an evil person but just to recognize man that would be nice but I I I I need this wisdom of self-control control I need the moderation of behavior and this applies in every single instance but I believe the scripture is trying to teach us to not necessarily in every situation have to bind ourselves to the Mast of a ship but to have moderation and behavior on a much higher level and I know that we alluded to this on Sunday because we we mentioned how that it's not just um behavioral self-control in the active sense of restraint in the moment where tonight when we get home from church there's like these cinnamon rolls that are sitting there for our guests that are coming over on Friday and we're like well there's no way we're eating all of those and we can always reposition them on a platter so that once we've eaten one or two it doesn't look like we've already dug into the dessert and you're rationalizing and trying to figure it out and you're and you're so pulled to it that you got to come up with some way I'm going to drink a gallon of water I'm just going to what try to stop yourself it's not that kind of restraint in the moment like adicus or orus where you got to TI me up you got to play music louder I don't want to be tempted not just a moderating a restraining behavior and restraining thoughts and emotions in the moment though we must have that at times in an hour of Temptation in a difficult situation we want something some alarm to go off and to wake us up say man how did I get here how is this happening so it's not just moderating behavior in the moment of temptation but a manner of living that limits being tempted having wives that don't bake so good right no it's a matter of living to where you're not being tempted by it that's a manner of life it's the way of the tree of life not the way of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil the way of tree of knowledge of Good and Evil you better have your uh um your resistance really robust you might your your control mechanisms in the moment those methods of restraint this high level some people operate in a way where they can restrain in those moments but I believe it's a more mature restraint in a more mature manner of living after the tree of life not from the Tree of knowledge of good evil to limit being tempted or distracted from our purpose there a real a critical important thought for me personally to share with you as your pastor is that I I I applaud and I think it's wonderful when we have mechanisms to help us in the moment but there is a manner of living that can keep evil far far further from us there can be areas of Our Lives where Satan has a punch he's always just real close can be um certain jobs we have or certain things that we do where we're going to have to be on guard and people we have to interact with I recognize that so it's not it's not that you're immature because you're tempted or there's something wrong with your spiritual walk with God because you are having to use active restraint but can we clean up our lives and our transactions to where we're limiting those interactions to where you're in the place where God is standing with you and can fight those battles so the greed will pull us into this uh this difficult ous situation where we're exerting self-will and self-control to resist things and listen if it's just you that runs out eventually and you eat eat the sweet rolls like all of them in Proverbs 13:11 wealth gotten by Vanity shall be diminished but he that GTH by labor shall increase speaks to the mindset of that when you're greedy you take shortcuts you're dishonest wealth that's gained hastily dwindles it's kind of like weight that's lost quickly is quickly found lost 15 pounds in two days gain 30 and four right it's just the way that it works wealth gotten by Vanity shall be diminished but he that gathereth by labor shall increase Gathering little by little increases it that you have a greater appreciation for it when we work hard for it and if there's something wrong and if there's a part that's really dangerous in the day and age we're living in is there's so many things sometimes that we can do to immediately make a lot of money you're like man I did this and I made X number of dollars and exponentially more and you think man that was easy and in your mind you're thinking I am going to be so rich I'm going to be so rich and the reality is to sustain that do you realize what it takes to really get rich doing YouTube videos does anybody know please tell us we're we're at a spot where we can monetize our YouTube channel and I'm thinking I don't know what 53 cents a month is going to get us if it's even that at our levels but hit that subscribe button turn on notifications and we'll build we'll build a new church eventually but it's a it's a mindset towards wealth to where I just I want the wealth I don't want the character I don't want to exhibit integrity and do hard work I I'm not even so much interested in the product where I'm wanting to fulfill a purpose and and I have a vision and I I want to do something that speaks well of my testimony I just want a paycheck at the end of the day that's all I'm after I just want a paycheck that kind of attitude just means you're going to get and you're going to give to the world you're just going to spend it you're going to use it it's going to get go away so the Bible says in Proverbs 234 labor not to be rich cease from thine own wisdom with all due respect to Brother David Ramsey we realize that uh your income is your single greatest asset to Building Wealth and so he would say labor and work and get an income to build wealth but I would say labor not to be rich yeah we could recognize there's certain Prudence that we could have in financial matters and towards uh and towards financial habits and practices but really we're not just Rich working to get rich that's why I kind of instinctively reject some Notions about how there's a rich mentality and there's a poor mentality no offense to those that want to read Rich Dad Poor Dad but there's a certain way where that's just in an arena where that's what you want to be as rich and integrity and character and quality of life may not necessarily weigh in on that so it says labor not to be rich cease from thine own wisdom and sure enough some of you probably have autographed copies of that book and we're going to have to talk later and I'm going to say look you know what I got no problem what is it ashimoto or Quasimoto what's his name kobashi I can't remember I've never read it and I've kind of cautioned Elliot against doing it he wants to read it so I'm just dragging our Dirty Laundry to the pulpit I'm dealing with my 16-year-old son in public his uncle is the one that recommended the book did he buy it for you is that what happened it's not even a big deal it's just I'm remembering all this while I'm talking labor not to be rich and he says cease from thine own wisdom let's not exhaust ourselves scheming ways to get money there's things we put so much time and effort in oh man if I could just get rich if I could just close this deal if I could just get this job if I could just get this off the ground I'm GNA be able make a lot of money I'll be able to stay at home more I'll be able to build a church I'll be able to do this I'll be able to do that it's kind of like why don't you just focus on what matters we scheme and put so much time into getting money inventing new things uh forming new projects examining new angles all to try to get ahead and make money and the Bible saying cease from your own wisdom flee from the worldly wisdom that encourages us to use all possible means to get rich right we're all get get rich or die trying mentalities we should treat we shouldn't just Treach Treach treat wealth and gain as blessings when in reality many times they're curses we should not treat riches and wealth as the Apex of wisdom that when you see somebody that has money go oh he must be prudent in his Affairs he must be sharp he must be smart he must be blessed that's not the metric brother Braham teaches us that most of God's children are poor cease from thine own wisdom so if we have God's wisdom we're less likely to be pulled away by the siren song of opportunity sometimes it's just the siren song of novelty cuz some we want new things and we want experience different things and we don't we get dissatisfied where we are because we're just in this upgrade cycle of life where we don't want to just stay doing the same thing and if we get caught in that mindset and behavior the American Psychiatric association to quote them said money continues to be the leading cause of stress for Americans leading cause of stress yielding to the spirit of this age produces the habits of this age giving into it leaning into it and giving into the the yielding to the spirit of this age produces the habits of this age and increases the pressures of this age as brother brandham said the burden of this age is that Lust For riches and uh soft living and nervous tensions it was our former president you're all nervous Theodore Roosevelt who said the things that will destroy America are Prosperity at any price peace at any price Safety First instead of Duty first the love of soft living and the get-rich theory of Life get-rich quick theory of Life brother Teddy nailed it things that will destroy America Prosperity any price peace at any price Safety First instead of Duty first and the love of soft living and the getrich quick theory of life these are the things that are eroding our base and our structure these are the things that we pursue after and we have as platitudes Prosperity at any price peace at any price Safety First instead of Duty first the love of soft living and relaxation and and Leisure and to get rich quick theory of life these are all things that are eroding our love for character our pursuit of Holiness and our calling on God for Revelation more than anything what we call upon God for is not Revelation but a promotion we call upon God for a raise we call upon God oh let me win the lot at least this time please and as we've mentioned before this age this is the age of content consumption it's greed is what the Bible calls it the love of money is destructive I say this just to allude to it I don't need to bring in stats and statistics to prove it but a great burden for Christians money problems Financial pressure and difficulty these are great burdens within to on individual in marriages on family debt and even money management are great curses on individuals and on families these are things that we are very real things and we can feel somewhat alienated sometimes if we just kind of look at it optically and everyone looks like they have it put together but we know our bank accounts and and we know what our uh eat living hand to mouth in our certain situations so we feel kind of backwards everyone can go out to lunch on Sundays we've got to go home because of our financial situation and you may feel backwards because of but listen everyone here knows the pressure of debt Financial struggles and money and and and those of you who and and when we we have to be careful that in trying to keep up we we start to put ourselves in Greater pressure because we don't want to appear to be the non-social or the outcast things that we can just be sensitive to as a congregation ways that we could make others feel uncomfortable I mean that's something to think about right in Ecclesiastes 5: 10-14 I want to read through this rather quickly and and hope that we can come back to it uh in the next half hour or so because it just it just to me it just reads in a way where we can get what he's writing what he's saying he that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver great right I love to fish you I can't fish enough right I mean if you love to do something you're not satisfied because you've done it does that make sense that when you really like to do something oh man I just love to fish I love to fish I love to fish I just want to go fishing so like man let's just get brother Aaron a fishing trip and then I go and I'm like I've done it I want to do it again this is awesome this is amazing you've got to do it you've got to try it right it's not like oh I love fishing so much I did it once I'm done done I love it so much so if you love silver you're not satisfied with silver nor he that loveth abundance with increase that's a challenge to the mindset this is also vanity because the one that loves silver can never have enough silver the one who loves abundance is never satisfied with increase because if he gets increased and he loves then he's like I need more like why because I love increase not what I have I love having more than I have and then once I have it I got to have more it's vanity when Goods increase they are increased that eat them and all the families that are growing said amen in other words as you increase the consumption of it increases and what is there the to the owners thereof saving beholding of them with their eyes right you get more and it's consumed the sleep of a laboring man is sweet whether he eat little or much notice the how it kind of gets into the mindset the the the sleep of a laboring man he that gathereth by labor shall increase wealth gotten by Vanity shall be diminished so it speaks of one that loves silver and is never satisfied with silver he that loves abundance is never satisfied with increase but the man who just working because that's what he does it's what he's called to do is to labor and enjoy the fruits of his labor but his object and goal is not wealth or to be rich that man's sleep is sweet whether he has little or much because he's satisfied with character and integrity and the trusting in the Lord the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep the abundance of the rich does not allow him to sleep it just compounds his fears and his anxieties if you go to bed and you have nothing you're not worried about thieves stealing it you're not worried about when the Stock Market opens tomorrow what's going to happen to my nothing I read a sign just yesterday it says people are always saying nothing's impossible that's not true I do nothing every day but if you have nothing or if you have little you're not worried about what's going to happen to it but if you have a lot it increases your worries and your fears there is a sore evil which I've seen Under the Sun namely riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt he says this is a sore evil and as a rich man writing this I'm sure he could say this is insanity I've done all this he went after music and food and the best he tried to find a way to satisfy himself I've got all the wisdom in the world I've got all this I've got all that surely I can find this secret to happiness and he's realizing riches does not satisfy wealth does not satisfy entertainment does not satisfy he says this is a sore evil that riches kept for the owners to their hurt but those riches perish by evil travail and he Beth a son and there's nothing in his hand in other words you can accumulate a lot of wealth and have a child that you think you're going to leave it to and it not be there when it goes to pass it's about I know maybe we're talk may seem like we're talking about money but we're talking about greed we're talking about how we mortgage our homes do don't take out a home equity loan do a reverse a home equity line of credit in the spiritual sense right that's what we're talking about these transactions we enter into where we're going in debt to the world and the world's given us something but we've got to give them our home in order to get it our home life and I'm maybe I am zeroing in on this idea of money and wealth and possessions and gain and this logy and mindset to you to speak to this concept but it's all through the scripture 16 of Jesus's 38 Parables deal with money or possessions one out of 10 verses there's 288 in total in the Gospels focused directly on the subject of money one out of 10 this this statistic I haven't taken the time to count them all myself but around 500 verses uh in the Bible are on prayer just less than 500 on faith over 2,000 verses dedicated to money and possessions wow around 500 on prayer less than 500 on faith over 2,000 that address money and possessions I think that's remarkable and that's why I remarked on it I want to read you a statement we read this uh before when we were speaking on Revelation resolves complication just imagine where we live today and how this is described in society our enormously productive economy demands that we make consumption our way of life because we have such economy and listen econom is different now we're not actually producing literal products we're producing um unlimited inventory when it comes to games and technology that there's really no way how how does an accountant quantify assets when they're doing an audit on a software company that can produce 800 billion digital widgets and value them at a dollar piece these are the real questions right so it's the economy is so vast it's so huge our enormously productive ecomony demands that we make consumption our way of life that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals like our coffee and candles our bath routines right these are all our we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals we're encouraged to engage in rituals for our mental health right and so we've been we've been told to convert the buying and use of goods into rituals that we seek our spiritual satisfactions our ego satisfactions in consumption the more the measure of social status of social acceptance of prestige is now to be found in our consumptive patterns the very meaning and significance of our lives today expressed in consumptive terms the greater the pressures upon the individual to conform to safe and accepted social standards the more does he tend to express his aspirations and his individuality in terms of what he wears drives eats his home his cars his pattern of food serving his Hobbies these Commodities and services must be offered to the consumer with a special urgency we required not only forced draft consumption but expensive consumption as well we need things consumed burned up worn out replaced and discarded at an ever increasing Pace we need to have people eat drink D dress ride live with ever more complicated and therefore constantly more expensive consumption it Bears repeating but it's really long so I'm not going to repeat it but if anybody wants this quotation I'll provide it to you anybody want to guess when this was written 1955 Victor leau in the Journal of retailing some of you may subscribe this is what he's saying in 1955 it's exactly what brother randam saiding at the very same time how that there is this ever expanding desire to consume and how it becomes part of our our identity where where we get our coffee where we like to eat what we wear what we drive there's such polarization identity found in our consumption habits and so we're looking to the buying and use of goods notice how he says that we have to eat drink dress ride live he's in some ways capturing exactly what Jesus said it would be like as it was in the days of lot and the days of Noah so the Journal of retailing Victor laau is just parting and giving this song out there saying yeah we're there we've arrived in the age of this consumption yes where we're having to conform to these social standards the spirit of the age forces us into social habits the engaging in those social habits just increase the social pressure in 1955 in Ephesians 4: 17 and 19 is telling us to not walk as the Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind we'll skip to verse 19 who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness to work all uncleanness with greediness the phrase is telling us that by walking in the vanity of their minds they are unable to determine what is actually necessary or sufficient so they work all uncleanness with greediness they engage in unclean things they skimp they cut Corners they're dishonest they're greedy for gain because they lack contentment in Simplicity they lack contentment with what they have and they don't have a heart and the wisdom to say this is good this is enough brother bandam says of the Lan age it cries that it has a great amplitude of all things but it keeps burning with desire like an unsatisfied fire this is exactly the where where mankind is today that they cry of this great amplitude of all things but it keeps burning with desire like an unsatisfied fire it it is true that much of the technology that we had 10 years ago could have been maintained and made affordable and we probably could have got by with it forever forever but it's say though we had the amplitude of things at that moment we burn with an unsatisfied unquenchable fire in the desire to improve to get better to to to uh integrate to consume and to get out there it's the it's the laws of economy it's the forces of of capitalism these are the things that are completely binding leod DEA he says they may have an amplitude of all things but when is it enough keeps burning with desire like an unsatisfied fire as Abraham maof says man is a perpetually wanting animal and the spirit of this age holds us back from true contentment we can have an amplitude of many things but but then we are burning with the desire that's unsatisfied we can possess a lot but still want even more because the spirit of a DEA holds us back from contentment for the sake of consumption Benjamin Franklin said money never made a man happy yet nor will it there's nothing in its nature to produce happiness the more man has the more he wants this is why we go back to Ecclesiastes chapter 5 this is just this is going back to the uh wealth gotten by V all these scriptures Benjamin Frankl is just quoting quoting scriptures or he's just summarizing the wisdom of scripture there's nothing in the nature of money to produce happiness the more a man has of money the more he wants instead of it's feeling a vacuum it makes one if you have a hole in your life and you think money is going to fill it up no as soon as you put money in there to fill up the hole it creates another hole if it satisfies one want it doubles and trebles that want another way so if you think money is going to satisfy a desire in your heart it may satisfy it but it has the effect of doubling it and tripling that want in another way because he that loves silver never has enough silver he that loves abundance never has enough increase in Mark chapter 10 vers verses 24 and 25 if I go fast enough we could finish then Jesus beholding him this is the Rich Young Ruler I won't give a lot of the context we'll just jump right into this he's looking at the Rich Young young ruler who said I've kept all thy Commandments from thy youth my my all these he says one thing thou lackest go thy way sell whatsoever thou Hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come take up the cross and follow me quite a statement and he the Rich Young Ruler was sad at that saying and went away Greed for he had great possessions he asked what he could do to have e eternal life Jesus tells him what he can do essentially and he doesn't want to engage in that transaction it was something he wanted in the analysis in the moment he said great possessions uh uh in following CH get rid of the possessions to follow Christ and in the quick analysis it says he walked away sad because he wasn't willing to make the investment he wasn't willing to exchange what he had gained in the world for what Christ was offering him and so Jesus in verse 23 remarks once this happens he looks around and says to his disciples how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God so it's his remark about the situation he's commenting on the circumstances of the Rich Young Ruler and how he's just turned down eternal life just rejected the opportunity to follow Christ he says man how hard it is for those that are rich to enter the kingdom of God and the disciples were astonished at his words but Jesus anth again and saith unto them children how hard is it for them that trusteth in riches to enter into the kingdom of God now he's not asking it as a question he's doubling down on his statement that it's so hard how hardly shall they so it leaves this room oh barely it's going to be difficult they that have riches to enter the kingdom of God how hard it is for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God so now it's the Trust In The Riches that become the focal point it's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God I will acknowledge and for all those whove been following my Ministry over 25 years since I've been preaching preaching I'll acknowledge that I use the analogy of the Gate of the city as being the eye of the needle I admit that I heard somebody else say it but I can't find it anywhere else where that's the truth you know in terms of the Jewish tradition and history but the Jews did have a saying at the time about a camel going through the eye of the needle it's not a play on words like a cable through an eye of a needle or a chem Jesus is exaggerating for the purpose of making a point it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of the needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God he's making a point to point out the near impossibility of a rich man to enter in he's using a phrase a cliche that would have been common at that time time about a camel going through the eye of the needle and they're literally refer figuratively referring to a camel though literally a camel going through the eye of a needle and it's like that doesn't happen right and he's want he's using exaggeration he's using it for the force of the argument because the disciples are still shocked like man he's doubled down on this he's using this phrase that we would use to express that ain't happening why because Christ recognizes something in the character of the Rich Young Ruler Proverbs Paul Ecclesiastes we could just pull from all sorts of scriptures the message of the hour Ephesians all these different places and Christ here recognizes how that riches gain greed negatively impact character it influences the human mind I wrote These down just to be able to share these as a summary from these things riches increased anxiety and care and distract us from the things of God this is what the scriptures tell us that the sleep of a laboring man is sweet but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep riches increase our nervousness our anxiety and they distract us from the things of God riches tend to provoke covetousness that the more the man a man has the more he wants again I'm summing what we've read to you in these terms they tend to provoke jealousy and covetousness it's hard to have them without loving them he that loveth silver is not satisfied with silver why does he love silver when we have it we tend to love it we we tend to have an inor affection towards it and therefore having them we're inclined to trust in them trust in them for our happiness far as security instead of God trust in it where we're afraid to let it go when God asked us to because we trust in that measure of securing us and securing our future and keeping us where we need to be then we do trust in God and having them we think more highly of ourselves because of them and having them is extremely difficult to use them correctly because we tend to view them ourselves as the owner of them instead of a steward of them think about it I know you're all thinking why couldn't he preach this on Sunday morning but I'd rather preach it to those who can really get into it take it to heart not to say that people on Sunday couldn't but i' I'd rather I'd rather it be you who are listening and hanging on every word willing to apply it to themselves it I preach things that are very very hard and people that you would think that that that was not intended for them at all they' be the last people thinking of like man I'm really challenging myself on this I'm really getting serious about this I'm really digging down deep and you're thinking whoa wow this is awesome people taking it to heart really weighing these things out I think it's good for us to think about this Christ is saying how hard it is for them that trust in riches into the kingdom of God why it corrupts character makes it really really hard that when you have wealth you tend to love it when you have wealth it tends to cause you to trust in it when you have wealth it tends to cause you anxiety and pressures when you have wealth it's really hard to use it correctly and so Paul says hopefully this becomes our our turning point where we can head to the finish line so Paul says in the final analysis of or not the final analysis but when he begins to turn it down on Timothy godliness with contentment is great gain and all these people who chased after money chased after this has pierced them through the love of money is the root of all evil he says oh thou man of God 1 Timothy 611 flee these things flee the lust to be rich flee Being Greedy for gain flee laboring to be Rich flee these things and follow after labor for this righteousness godliness Faith love patience meekness have a different goal have a vision different Vision have a different balance sheet that when people are comparing their their bank account balance you think of your spiritual righteousness balance your Trust balance your character balance your faith balance you begin to think of things that matter and someone says man I'm making six figures now or I've got this investment my investment in in in and this altcoin has quadrupled and and and they're really excited about everything and maybe you missed out on an opportunity maybe it didn't happen but you can be satisfied if you're laboring correctly doing a job right you have integrity you have character you have honesty maybe you don't have a lot but you sleep well maybe you don't have a lot but you're pleasing your heavenly Father in Heaven who's promised you the righteous aren't going to be forsaken the righteous are not going to be begging for bread that there is a promise where we're trusting him what are you trusting in I'm not trusting in stock markets I'm not trusting in the next election cycle to fix our economy I'm trusting in God it's a different Vision a different goal completely different set of accounting rules the Bible says in Psalms 37:16 use this when you do your next audit a little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many Wicked you notice what he just did there a little that a single righteous man has is better than the riches of many Wicked right put the one% up there put all the billionaires up there a little that you have as righteous children of God is better than all the riches of the wicked godliness with contentment is true wealth as Paul said it's great gain this is different from worldly success this is different from the the measure of worldly riches it's contrary to the spirit of leot DEA godliness it's reverence and respect for God it's deferring to God it's Devotion to God godliness with contentment putting God first putting Christ first godliness with content contentment is sufficiency I'm this is sufficient it's a happy mind to have contentment with this is to be rest at rest or satisfied that I'm satisfied when iwake in thy likeness I'm satisfied when I put you first I'm satisfied when I do the right thing satisfied when I labor correctly I'm satisfied when I have the right response to my wife I'm satisfied when I feel like I handled a diffic difficult situation that pleases Lord I'm satisfied when I when I uh examine myself I satisfied when I see Holiness I'm satisfi when I crave for righteousness as Paul said in 1 Timothy 65 per perverse disputant of men of corrupt minds and destitute supposing that gain is godliness he says withdraw yourselves from them from the mindset from that momentum they suppose that gain is godliness gain is not godliness godliness is Devotion to God a little that a righteous man has is better than the many The Riches of many Wicked in Proverbs 15:16 better a little with the fear of the Lord than great treasure and trouble therewith it's better to have a little and be righteous it's better have little with the fear of the Lord they have a lot of treasure and All the Troubles that come with it when we speak of a mortgaged home it's not about borrowing money as we said on Sunday it's not even about incurring debt we're not we're not just looking at those things and and put trying to shine a light on those who might have credit balances or borrow money to buy a home that's not it at all but it's about burdening our home spiritually because we lack wisdom the house of the Lord is a home been thinking about this in terms of what makes a house a home in Christ Christ is what makes a house a home the house of the Lord was not home until the presence of God came down inside of it so Christ's character this divine order the presence of God is what makes a house a home I was thinking there's never a place that isn't a home where Christ is because brother R says when Christ leaves your home Trouble Comes right trouble's on its way when Christ leaves your home why because it's Christ is what makes it a home and a mortgage is a death pledge it's the literal meaning of the word a death pledge a mortgage is an incumbrance upon a property that diminishes its value you may own a house that's worth a million dollars but if you have a mortgage that's also a million dollar you don't have a million dollars are you listening I want to I want to end tonight I'm probably going to end up skipping a lot of stuff and we can always just pick up on it Sunday if the Lord terries so think as I want I had to get to the spot where my title is at least makes sense a mortgage diminishes the value of your property yes yes a borrower gives consideration in the form of collateral that's the that's in the an actual transaction the house is offered up as security as collateral you borrow money that's the benefit you get but now I'm saying what do we give up as consideration what are we giving up as collateral our home for gain because you know what happens when you enter into a transaction a mortgage a death pledge if you don't pay in the event of default the one that you issued the mortgage to the one you issued the security to the one that you made a death pledge to can take possession of the collateral it's called a forclosure there's those that argue that if you owe the bank money then it's really really not even your house there's some that look at it that way and I can see the argument they're trying to make maybe there's some semantics or Nuance there but let's just think in a spiritual sense if we've pledged some part of home life as security to the world for what we can get out of it now we are in debt to the world and we've pledged that part it's burdened now it's it's it there's one who's first in line who has a lean on it not the Lord You're not trusting to him you're not trusting him the world has a lean lean on that peace the world has a lean on that satisfaction the world has a lean on that joy and you're trying to catch up oh one day if we get out of debt one day if we do this one day if we do that and you think that one day you're going to be able to go back to the pawn shop and get it back but you've you've you've mortgaged something right you've mortgaged something and if the debts not paid they foreclose on it and you lose possession of it so I just say don't pledge it and I I believe that God is the one who can take that God has made a promise he could take that right out of the Filthy Hands of the world and give it back to you so when he say don't a mortgaged home don't Pledge Your Peaceable habitation don't Pledge Your sure dwelling don't Pledge Your quiet resting place the Bible says the servant is uh the rich rules rules over the poor and the borrower is servant to the lender in other words a servant is that the lender's Mercy it's for you're forced to be subject to it creates a power Dynamic where they can control you and they can demand certain things of you debt brings in the a relationship of dependence I want you to think about these things when it comes to our spiritual transactions or maybe better said our carnal transactions and what kind of relationship and power dynamics being created to where you've given up something of value to receive something from the world and then it creates this negative Dynamic where you have to satisfy certain things you have to fulfill certain things and you feel compelled to do certain things just even borrowing on that thought mind said of those that owe on their house don't truly own it but I'd say a Believer with a mortgaged home is not a true homeowner because that's not what God's called us to do amen God's called us to possess it absolutely and completely I'll close with this statement will the church go before the tribulation Brothers if you could come to your instruments again I I'm realizing just now I'm not getting to what I wanted to get to on Sunday I I'd like to uh look at that other side where flee these things and pursue this other that there's these righteous Pursuits that we can that we can pursue that do fill the vacuum and don't treble things the other way in the days of lot they were eating drinking marrying giving in marriage planting building selling buying oh there never was a day that's so much commercial as today just use car lots and everything so much till you can buy a refrigerate this year and pay about $400 or $500 for oh I wish and next year nobody wants it it's out of style now it doesn't work because they've upgraded the firmware and it doesn't communicate with the networks anymore right like how in the world does a refrigerator you can't even buy a print a coffee maker has to connect to the Smart Hub and if you use a different kind of K cup or whatever it is than the one that communicates with the worldwide web and Al gor over they going no uhuh that's not it you can't use that it's obsolete notice we're where we are today when Victor laau is saying what he did in the 1955 brother Brams 1958 he's saying this is where we are buying and selling so commercial things going out of style don't you see where the commercial world has your nose to the Grind wheel you buy a car this year next year it's probably as good as the one you could buy then but it didn't it it'll depreciate $1,000 because they changed the radiator cap or they done some little silly something to it they said oh no no no no we changed it it goes like this now not like this like I can't see the difference between this model and that model yeah but this model goes like this and that model goes like that like okay it's the radiator cap all right this is what we're caught up in and they done some little some silly thing to it it's only a cell's talk to fulfill the Bible as it was in the days of Noah as it was in the days of lot or here right in the middle middle of it right in the thick of it Le O deia commercialism has our nose to the grindstone capitalism has our nose to the grindstone it's not a debate as to what works best in terms of economies free market or otherwise my point is you belong to a different one that you can be investing in you realize we consider ourselves to be the bride of Christ and would we agree that there's bride members around the world there's bride members that exist completely within socialist economies and socialist governments and communism are they any less bride because they have to operate by socialist rule there's Believers in in Europe who are legally not allowed to homeschool are they any less Christian because legally and by the laws of the land they're not able to homeschool I'm asking a serious question when it comes to manner of life and living and what we pursue and our liberties and our freedoms and all the things that are made available to us there's a lot lot of things that were beginning to be told As Americans that are our god-given rights that in reality has completely H H uh misled and perverts the scripture because we want to stand up to for the right to bear arms the right to do this and the right to do that how about leaving that to the politicians and you serve God which is your right and you Comm completely commit yourself to his economy so I will not sell my home I will not mortgage my home I will not take advantage of all the things that the world wants to sell me I'm not going to be brainwashed into thinking that that makes me more of a Christian because I can pursue capitalism because I can pursue these Liberties what makes you a Christian is when you're subject to other laws and other orders in a completely different economy and we're living in that time the day when the son of man is being revealed and I encourage you to feed on that to feed on that to focus on that the scriptures speaking Us in such a beautiful way that we can begin to store up Treasures in the right places in the right [Music] way God help us God help us I I'm just going to try to finish it very quickly I can do this Jesus said lay up for yourselves Treasures in Heaven where your treasure is there your treasure will be also where your heart is there your treasure will be also where your treasure is your heart will be also heart ambition affection and it's saying home is that that place where you have your deepest affection home is the place where you have your that emotional pull where your treasure it means that place that you store things up a place where precious things are collected and stored through wisdom is a house builded through knowledge shall it be made established and fixed or by understanding it's established and through knowledge it's filled with all precious and pleasant riches this is this is the way this is the way to happiness in a home the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom and the knowledge of the Holy is understanding that reverence and obedience to God if we don't have reverence in obedience to God if we don't have godliness then all other wisdom all other knowledge is vain and so it's by these things the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom this is how a house is built knowledge of the Holy is understanding that's how it's established this is how we fill our homes by Revelation by faith is how we fill our homes with enjoyable things wisdom is the principal thing therefore get wisdom and with all thy getting get understanding this is what the Bible tell us that we ought to value in Jeremiah it says thus sayith the Lord let not wise man glory in his wisdom neither let the Mighty Man glory in his might let not the rich man glory in his riches but let him that glorieth glory in this that he hath he understandeth and knoweth me who what other generation could we say this to but you who sit here right now in 2024 with the word that's been opened up to you who who else could we say this to to say those wisdom is the principal thing get wisdom with all th getting get understanding and let us not joy in Earthly wisdom let neither glory in our physical strength let not the rich man glory in his riches but let us glory in that we understand and know him that I am the Lord which exercises loving kindness judgment and righteousness in the Earth for in these things I Delight Paul said charge them that are rich in this world that they be not high-m minded nor trusted un certain riches but in the Living God who give us richly all things to a joy that they do good that they be rich in Good Works ready to distribute willing to communicate this is a complete change in terms of what we ought to pursue it's g i think it's given us practical things we say well I got a job I got this I got these bills I got that bill I got I got all these things I need to do okay it's there debt s snowballs work certain approaches work there's ways that you can get out of debt there's ways that you can go through your finances but listen what good is all that if this doesn't become first yes sir you know what happened if you get out of debt you'll be like and you don't trust the Lord like man I can do this and you won't be afraid to Rack it up again because you're going to think you can just get out of it listen I'll just use the analogy of losing weight when I was a certain age I could gain 20 pounds and lose it like that and then there comes the point well once you've gained that 20 you ain't ever getting rid of it right because you played with it too much or maybe you just get old and if you think you can just always get yourself out of debt get yourself out of debt listen one day it's going to be too late like oh man I can't get out of this one I'm in a pickle I can't do it and I realized that medical EXP expenses and job loss and inflation and reduced income create fin Financial pressure but then the poor use of credit and the bad money management overspending just increase that pressure I realize these things are real these things are true but I there that's one thing that's one thing that the Lord can do with you that's things that you can be taught from the scripture how to be prudent in finances but I don't want to try to get you how to manage your money thing without saying look the most important thing is put Christ first put him first so he can put a fear in your heart about being irresp responsible with the things he blesses you with and say listen if I get a paycheck it's from him if I get a promotion it's from him if I have anything in this world all good things have come from him and I'll give him glory and I'll have a fear and a reverence of God to manage what he's given me correctly and that's a great place to start living where the son of man is being revealed he said I'll never leave thee nor forsake thee and that's why we can to say let your conversation be without covetousness be content with such things as you have cuz he says I will never leave thee nor forsake thee brother brandham says in the sermon and knoweth it not this is in 196 August 15th 1965 just watch stay close to Christ let me warn you now as a minister of the Gospel of this don't take any foolishness don't imagine anything stay right there until this inside of the inside is anchored to the word that you're right in Christ cuz that's the only thing that's going to he says cuz we're in the most deceiving age that we've ever lived in now if you could enter into this admonishment that how direct he's being the the intensity with which the Holy Spirit would be projecting this to the bride at this moment in his ministry him not necessarily knowing what's coming but him say stay close to Christ let me warn you be anchored on the inside to the word it's the most deceiving age we've ever been it would deceive the very elected if it was possible because they had anointing they could do anything like the rest of them them and he says clean your lives up pay your debts I mean don't we want to get more into a debate about who the defilers of the message are thematically and theologically and he's saying no just clean your lives up and pay your debts brother BR name names tell us who the deceivers are no clean your life up and pay your debts oh and no man Jesus said now I mean like your house rent stuff you got to do that get all your things off your hands get everything right make ready get ready ready so it's this it's just right here in this urgent moment this urgent hour I don't believe it was just he he he was you know just preaching and all of a sudden he grabbed the wrong set of notes and it was his Todo list the next day and Oh wrong one he this is part of the bride's preparation and cleaning our lives up and not becoming indebted to the world all these mortgages we've taken out on our home life he said get rid of them get all things off your hands get everything right Make Ready Get Ready remember in the name of the Lord something's fixing to happen I'm going into the Hills this week not exactly to hunt squirrels of course I like to hunt squirrels but I'm going there for a purpose saying oh God I don't know which way to move I don't want to miss this help me you pray for me will you do it I'll be praying for you I hope by the mercies of God that I meet every one of you when we meet in a better land than this here and what are we coming here for what are we doing are we coming here playing a game are we coming here meeting as a lodge Christ can't come until that church is perfectly right he's waiting on us I believe we're at the end I say this just to give some context and urgency I believe the son of man is revealed himself in this hour I know that there's a way that we could preach that that tickles our ears and it makes us feel really good in terms of what's happened in the Fulfillment of scripture but if it doesn't translate to a life lived by the word if it doesn't translate to better relationships among those that we love if it doesn't translate to cleaning up our lives and paying our debts then we're missing something in the translation yes sir oh God help us what are we coming here for what are we doing are we just playing a game we just meeting at a lodge but are we pursuing righteousness we pursuing the right things oh God help us to do the right thing and if you have a mortgage on your home uh go ahead and hire Christ as your lawyer tonight I say devil it was never yours to begin with I didn't have the I didn't have the right to pledge that Christ was first in line he has priority of lean let him take over tonight let him foreclose and leave the devil out in the cold will you do it let's do it God bless you let's Stand Together
