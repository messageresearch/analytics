[0:00] These are very familiar scriptures. I
[0:02] would almost say that tonight what I'm
[0:03] ministering on might seem to be somewhat
[0:05] cliche. Uh just because it is an often
[0:09] ministered on subject, but just because
[0:10] it's preached often doesn't mean there's
[0:12] nothing better to preach. It just means
[0:14] we need it.
[0:15] &gt;&gt; And I really believe that God often
[0:17] times emphasizes these things because
[0:19] it's at a time that we need it. And we
[0:21] know that all things work together for
[0:23] I'll just start with verse 28. know that
[0:25] all things work together for good to
[0:26] them that love God to them who are the
[0:28] called according to his purpose. For
[0:30] whom he did forno, he also did
[0:32] predestinate to be conformed to the
[0:33] image of his son, that he might be the
[0:36] firstborn among many brethren. Moreover,
[0:38] whom he did predestinate them he also
[0:40] called. And whom he called them, he also
[0:42] justified. And whom he justified, them
[0:44] he also glorified. So now he says, "What
[0:46] shall we then say to these things? If
[0:49] God be for us, who can be against us? He
[0:52] that spared not his own son, but
[0:54] delivered him up for us all. How shall
[0:56] he not with him also freely give us all
[0:59] things? Who shall lay anything to the
[1:01] charge of God's elect? For it is God
[1:02] that justifieth. Who is he that
[1:04] condemnth? It is Christ that died, yay,
[1:06] rather, that is risen again, who is even
[1:08] at the right hand of God, who also
[1:10] maketh intercession for us. Who shall
[1:13] separate us from the love of Christ?
[1:15] Shall tribulation or distress or
[1:17] persecution or famine or nakedness or
[1:19] peril or sword? As it is written, for
[1:21] thy sake we are killed all the day long,
[1:23] for we are counted as sheep for the
[1:25] slaughter. Nay, in all these things we
[1:28] are more than conquerors through him
[1:30] that loved us. For I am persuaded that
[1:32] neither death nor life, nor angels, nor
[1:34] principalities, nor powers, nor things
[1:36] present, nor things to come, nor height,
[1:38] nor depth, nor any other creature shall
[1:40] be able to separate us from the love of
[1:42] God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[1:46] Thank you so much, Lord, for inspiring
[1:49] Paul to write these things with such
[1:51] great specificity. You can be seated.
[1:57] My I'm going to have a title tonight of
[2:00] life by death. And we'll come back to
[2:03] maybe that just here in a moment. But I
[2:04] wanted to go back over life is good. We
[2:07] ministered on that on Sunday. What we're
[2:09] ministering tonight does build from
[2:11] that. I do think it stands on its own.
[2:14] But I wanted just to approach this
[2:15] subject tonight by going back over this
[2:18] quickly that this life is good was used
[2:21] just to kind of emphasize the thought
[2:23] that the good life is eternal life. We
[2:26] know that we're taught in the message of
[2:27] the hour that there is a life that is
[2:29] God's own life. Brother Brandham takes
[2:31] from the scripture thy loving kindness
[2:33] is better than life. And he says, well,
[2:35] it couldn't be better than eternal life.
[2:37] So what he's referring to has to be some
[2:39] other kind of life. And so when we say
[2:41] life is good, that's this eternal life,
[2:44] Zoey life. We could say that it's Christ
[2:46] that is good and Christ who is God's
[2:49] wisdom and God's power. And that's the
[2:52] in there is the good life or life is
[2:55] good or eternal life is that which is
[2:57] good. Uh brother Eli Argast sent me a
[3:00] scripture yesterday and just sent some
[3:02] of his thoughts on it. I thought it was
[3:04] really really good and it just kind of
[3:05] encouraged me in this direction tonight.
[3:07] In Psalm 38:20,
[3:10] David says, "They also that render evil
[3:13] for good are mine adversaries." And so,
[3:15] we know we're taught not to render evil
[3:17] for evil, nor return evil for good, but
[3:20] that we should do good and we should do
[3:22] right. But here he says, "Those that
[3:23] would render good for e or render evil
[3:25] for good are his enemies because I
[3:28] follow the thing that good is." What
[3:31] brother Eli remarked on is you you read
[3:33] it, it almost seems a little bit
[3:34] backwards because you would say, "I
[3:35] follow the thing that is good." But this
[3:38] is the thing that good is. And maybe a
[3:41] lot of different translations might
[3:42] wrestle with this, but when we look in
[3:44] the scripture know that there's a one
[3:45] good, but God, it says the thing that
[3:48] good is good is Christ. Christ the way,
[3:51] the truth, the life. This is the good.
[3:54] He is good. Not in the sense of well, he
[3:57] has these kind of characteristics, but
[3:58] it's inherent in him. this goodness.
[4:01] &gt;&gt; And so in our lives where we have in the
[4:04] human existence as we've been using this
[4:06] kind of music theory and this interplay
[4:08] between consonants which is good and the
[4:10] dissonance which is evil and how those
[4:12] elements work together to form this
[4:14] symphony, this composition and how the
[4:17] evil and those tones and the way that
[4:19] God uses them in our lives. It's
[4:21] necessary for this great symphony that
[4:23] we're living in right now that for the
[4:25] for it to be a masterpiece. There's
[4:27] something that he does to make it a
[4:29] masterpiece. And it's not just monotone.
[4:31] It's not just the consonants, but
[4:33] there's something he does to give it
[4:35] context and make it something great. And
[4:38] so when we say life is good, it's
[4:40] contrasted by death. Like death is bad.
[4:43] Maybe it could have been another title.
[4:45] But I I don't want life just to be
[4:47] defined uh by as an or death to be
[4:51] defined as an opposite to life because
[4:53] life really has no comparison. And it's
[4:56] not that we define life by looking at
[4:58] what the opposite is, but it's this
[5:01] contrasted this life, this eternal life
[5:03] is contrasted by death. And there's a
[5:06] way that we could phrase this to say
[5:08] this life is death. From the moment
[5:10] you're born, you're marching to a grave.
[5:12] And so this life, this human life, this
[5:14] life we now live, we've seen it in a lot
[5:16] of different ways in the scripture. It's
[5:18] full of darkness. It's full of evil.
[5:19] It's full of hurt and pain. And so in
[5:22] third John uh verse uh verse 11 it says
[5:25] beloved follow not that which is evil
[5:27] but that which is good. So there's an
[5:30] evil in life and there's things that I
[5:32] we can almost say this that the things
[5:34] that are evil are those things will have
[5:36] an end. Those things that are evil are
[5:38] things that are temporary and carnal. Oh
[5:40] that's kind of some strong language.
[5:41] Well let's just look at it that way. And
[5:43] there's things that we could pursue and
[5:44] hunger for and lust for. But don't do
[5:46] that. Pursue that which is good. And
[5:50] again, the language suggests something
[5:52] more than just happiness and good times
[5:55] in life. It says, "He that doeth good is
[5:57] of God, but he that doeth evil hath not
[6:00] seen God."
[6:01] &gt;&gt; Good is God.
[6:03] &gt;&gt; And so, when we're to follow that which
[6:05] is good, we're to follow Christ. We're
[6:07] to follow after charity. We're to pursue
[6:09] these good things and to the Bible says
[6:12] assue evil or abandon evil or forsake
[6:14] evil. In order to do that, you have to
[6:16] recognize it.
[6:17] &gt;&gt; Right? This is how our love is without
[6:18] hypocrisy is we cling to the good and we
[6:22] abhore or hate that which is evil. So if
[6:25] we're to follow that which is good, then
[6:28] we're to follow Christ because he is
[6:29] that good and he that doeth good is of
[6:32] God. So there's this this great
[6:34] distinction of the goodly, the godly,
[6:36] the goodness is is of God and then the
[6:39] evil, the carnal and the debase is
[6:41] human.
[6:43] Now my title is life by death. I thought
[6:46] brother Bart Martin may appreciate my
[6:48] use of an X here. I know he's been to
[6:50] South by Southwest a number of times.
[6:52] So, we're just trying to stay up to
[6:53] date. Little trendy here. Uh maybe
[6:56] that's more of a 2000s thing, but life
[6:59] by death. And I hope this isn't too much
[7:01] of a big deal. I got to get this off my
[7:02] chest, but it struck me today. And I may
[7:04] be late to the party, but it's Bob the
[7:08] tomato and Larry the cucumber. Right.
[7:10] &gt;&gt; Right. Aren't those the main guys in
[7:12] Veggie Tales? And aren't those fruits?
[7:16] They are. I I don't know where that came
[7:18] from, but it was I was in the office. I
[7:20] can't get past it. And I just had to lay
[7:22] that out there. Thinking about silly
[7:23] songs in music. But the fact that a
[7:26] tomato and a cucumber are the lead
[7:27] characters on a cartoon about vegetables
[7:30] just I don't know. Speaking about of
[7:33] death, but life by death. What we're
[7:36] want to look at tonight is the necessity
[7:39] of need. A lot of different ways that
[7:41] you could phrase this, a lot of ways
[7:42] that you could explore this. But uh
[7:44] maybe if I could say it this way, and I
[7:46] know I know there's just this tight rope
[7:47] sometimes that you walk in these things,
[7:49] but evil is necessary.
[7:52] &gt;&gt; And and it must be overcome in order to
[7:54] see good.
[7:55] &gt;&gt; If we want to see good in this life,
[7:57] you're not just going to lay around and
[7:58] see it.
[7:59] &gt;&gt; Uh this life, this human life is is
[8:02] sorrow and it's leading to a grave. And
[8:04] so when we use this title life by death,
[8:07] we're looking at how there's this uh we
[8:09] need uh we need necessity uh evil is
[8:13] necessary because it has to be overcome.
[8:16] It has to be suffered or endured or even
[8:17] accepted in order to see good. In
[8:20] Hebrews chapter 2 10 and again I I
[8:22] mentioned cliche in the beginning. It
[8:24] comes from these very familiar
[8:26] scriptures. So there's nothing I'm not
[8:28] I'm not revealing anything this evening.
[8:30] Uh just as at any other service we
[8:32] preach. We don't reveal anything new.
[8:34] For it became him for whom are all
[8:35] things and by whom are all things.
[8:37] Christ the wisdom and power of God. That
[8:40] one in the beginning by whom all things
[8:41] were created. Without him was nothing
[8:43] made but in bringing many sons unto
[8:46] glory. So now we're part of this to make
[8:48] the captain of their salvation perfect
[8:51] through sufferings. And perfect there
[8:53] means ended. It means it means to rest
[8:56] or this culmination. Uh there's a
[8:58] scripture Christ said the things
[8:59] pertaining to me shall have an end. And
[9:01] I heard a minister one time preach that
[9:03] Christ would cease to exist. That he
[9:05] would no longer exist. Absolutely.
[9:07] Whatsoever in heaven, he would no longer
[9:08] exist. Taking the scripture that the
[9:10] things pertaining to me shall have an
[9:11] end. But it doesn't mean they'll have an
[9:13] end. It'll just reach its completion.
[9:15] &gt;&gt; Not end as in being finished. It's gone.
[9:17] It's done away with like the second
[9:18] death. Uh doing away with the hell and
[9:21] devil and his angels. But it means uh in
[9:23] bringing many sons into glory, he was
[9:25] brought to this culmination. He was
[9:26] finished. He was fulfilled. He found his
[9:29] rest through suffering.
[9:31] Therefore, if we are called to glory,
[9:33] then our glory will come by affliction.
[9:35] It comes by enduring.
[9:37] He's bringing many sons unto glory. And
[9:39] the very one, the leader in this is
[9:41] brought to his rest through sufferings.
[9:43] And we're called to share in that glory.
[9:46] That's
[9:46] &gt;&gt; why Paul says in Romans 8 verse 18, for
[9:48] I reckon that the sufferings of this
[9:50] present time are not worthy to be
[9:52] compared with the glory which shall be
[9:53] revealed in us. So there is this measure
[9:56] of suffering now in this life. This life
[9:59] is the hurting. This life is the pain.
[10:02] This life is the striving and and the
[10:03] the attempting to overcome. I remember
[10:06] as a young Christian I heard a brother
[10:08] sing the song uh uh just a few more
[10:12] happy days and then I'll fly away. And I
[10:14] was like I like that positive
[10:15] confession. And I remember I sang it one
[10:17] time leading songs at at I wanted to say
[10:20] Homer Tabernacle but that's not it. It's
[10:22] evening light in uh used to be Homer,
[10:24] Louisiana. And I sang just a few more
[10:26] happy days and then you know I'll fly
[10:28] away and was trying to be all positive
[10:30] and happy and brother Tim got up and
[10:31] said no it's a few more weary days and
[10:34] then our church will never sing it that
[10:35] way again. And maybe as a young man I'm
[10:38] thinking a come on positive confession
[10:39] and you know my old age now I'm thinking
[10:41] probably older than brother Tim was at
[10:43] the time when he corrected that. I like
[10:44] you know what they are weary days. Yeah,
[10:47] &gt;&gt; they are they are weary days. Yes, we
[10:49] have times of happiness and we have
[10:51] times of great joy and victory, but this
[10:53] is a time of warfare. This is a time of
[10:55] fighting.
[10:55] &gt;&gt; We haven't we haven't uh beat our swords
[10:58] into plowshares yet.
[11:01] &gt;&gt; And so, it's a it's a time of suffering,
[11:03] but the sufferings of this present time
[11:05] point to a glory to be revealed in us.
[11:07] Amen.
[11:08] &gt;&gt; In 2 Corinthians 12:es 5-7,
[11:13] he's talking about being caught up into
[11:15] a third heaven and these great
[11:16] revelations that he had and he's going
[11:18] to I could speak of this and he's
[11:19] talking about boasting. He says, "Of
[11:21] such a one will I glory yet of myself I
[11:23] will not glory but in my infirmities."
[11:26] Odd statement. "I'm going to glory in my
[11:30] affirmities, my afflictions, my sorrows,
[11:32] my trials, my sicknesses, my weaknesses.
[11:34] For though I would desire to glory, I
[11:36] shall not be a fool. For I will say the
[11:39] truth, but now I forbear. I love Paul.
[11:42] He just I wish he could podcast today. I
[11:44] would binge it. For though I would
[11:46] desire to glory, I shall not be a fool.
[11:48] For I will say the truth, but now I
[11:50] forbear, lest any man should think of me
[11:51] above that which seemth seemth me to be
[11:55] which he seeth me to be, or that he
[11:57] heareth of me. And lest I should be
[11:59] exalted above measure through the
[12:01] abundance of the revelations, there was
[12:04] given to me a thorn in the flesh, the
[12:07] messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I
[12:10] should be exalted above measure.
[12:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:14] &gt;&gt; Very important scripture I think for all
[12:15] of us, not just for a prophet or to an
[12:17] apostle or messenger here. But he's
[12:19] saying that I receive these revelations
[12:20] and these revelations coming from God
[12:23] and uh and the these things being very
[12:26] special to me. He says, "I I'm not going
[12:27] to glory in that. I'll glory in the one
[12:29] that was revealed to me." But he's
[12:31] saying that the thorn was a necessary
[12:33] evil because the revelation of Christ.
[12:37] &gt;&gt; Because he had received this revelation
[12:38] of Christ, there needed to be some sort
[12:41] of balance in his life. There had to be
[12:44] something that opposed him. I
[12:45] appreciated brother Tim Dodd sharing
[12:47] with me one time that in order for
[12:48] something to have be faith, it has to
[12:50] have something against it. And so what
[12:52] made that revelation so beautiful to him
[12:54] is that it gave him soloulless in the
[12:56] midst of everything that would try to
[12:58] attack that and tear it down. So this
[13:00] thorn was, if I could say, a necessary
[13:02] evil because of the revelation of
[13:04] Christ, but not just because the
[13:06] revelation of Christ, but also because
[13:08] of his own evil.
[13:10] &gt;&gt; He said, lest he should be exalted above
[13:12] measure. So you have this revelation of
[13:15] Christ, which is beautiful. It's what
[13:17] you're receiving today. It's what you're
[13:18] feeding on now is this revelation of
[13:20] Jesus Christ personally to you in this
[13:23] hour where he's making himself known.
[13:25] And as he makes himself known, lest we
[13:27] would be exalted above measure because
[13:29] there's still this human element that's
[13:31] being perfected and a and worked with,
[13:34] we could be exalted, become arrogant,
[13:36] become prideful, become political with
[13:38] it. Then he says there's this messenger
[13:39] of Satan that buffeted him. It's that
[13:42] same measure of suffering that we're
[13:43] left to ourselves. There was something
[13:46] there that acted as
[13:49] a balancer to him. It kept him in check.
[13:53] When we say life by death, I know it's a
[13:56] a peculiar phrase, but I think you kind
[13:58] of understand already. The evil we
[14:00] experience and this the press that we
[14:03] have to endure, the things that press in
[14:04] upon us, they cannot hinder God's
[14:07] purpose for us.
[14:08] &gt;&gt; Christ was going to be the captain of
[14:10] our salvation. And it was all the
[14:11] sufferings did not prevent that. Paul
[14:14] was a prophet to the Gentiles. He was a
[14:16] prophet to that first age and all the
[14:18] thorns in his flesh and the things that
[14:19] buffeted him did not prevent that.
[14:23] We'll see in the scripture that and I
[14:25] think we're all familiar with this that
[14:26] in order for something to live something
[14:27] has to die or there's this process. So
[14:30] it's this principle of life through
[14:32] death
[14:33] in Romans chapter 8 35-37.
[14:37] We've already read uh just a moment ago
[14:39] how we suffer in this present time and
[14:42] through these sufferings there's going
[14:43] to be a glory that is wrought in us and
[14:46] he's already said that all things work
[14:48] together for good. So the evil that we
[14:50] experience cannot prevent the good.
[14:54] And and as predestinated children of
[14:56] God, we've been predestinated to a
[14:58] glory, to a perfection, this glorified
[15:01] state. And he says if he didn't spare
[15:03] his own son,
[15:05] he says, and he delivered him up for us
[15:07] all. How will he not by that deliverance
[15:10] give us all things? But if he did not
[15:13] spare his own son's suffering, how is it
[15:15] that we ourselves could be spared
[15:17] punishment or spared the suffering? And
[15:20] so he doesn't say, "Oh, through his
[15:21] death, we're going to be given all
[15:23] things and we're somehow exempt from
[15:25] suffering." No, he continues to say that
[15:27] we cannot be condemned because Christ is
[15:29] risen.
[15:30] &gt;&gt; So then he asks the question, who shall
[15:32] separate us from the love of Christ?
[15:34] Before you read anything else, you
[15:36] should know the answer. Nothing.
[15:39] &gt;&gt; I remember uh brother
[15:42] Junior one time in in Texas. He preached
[15:44] a sermon and he was main language was
[15:46] Spanish. And brother Scott, I don't even
[15:48] know, you might have been there. And he
[15:49] was preaching and and he spoke Spanish,
[15:51] but he was preaching in English. And he
[15:52] said, "What shall separate us from the
[15:54] love of Christ?" And he said, "Only one
[15:57] thing." And I'm kind of like, "Well,
[16:00] brother, I don't know what it says in
[16:02] your Spanish, but" and he said,
[16:05] "Nothing." I was like, "I appreciate
[16:08] that. I like that. That's good."
[16:10] Nothing. That's the only thing, nothing.
[16:12] What shall separate us from the love of
[16:14] Christ? Shall tribulation or distress or
[16:17] persecution or famine or nakedness or
[16:19] peril or sword? Notice he doesn't say
[16:21] what is it that we will not suffer as
[16:23] his sons? What is it we don't have to go
[16:25] through? It assumes the tribulation,
[16:28] distress, persecution, famine, or
[16:29] nakedness or perilous sword. But he's
[16:30] wanting us to understand that though we
[16:32] may suffer that, it cannot separate us
[16:34] from his love. So then he kind of drills
[16:37] down on or doubles down as it is
[16:38] written, for thy sake we are killed all
[16:40] the day long. We are counted as sheep
[16:42] for the slaughter. So we must suffer
[16:44] this daily death. We have to suffer the
[16:46] persecution. We have to suffer the evil
[16:48] in this life. Nay, in all these things,
[16:50] we are more than conquerors to him that
[16:52] loved us.
[16:54] &gt;&gt; We're not exempt from them, but somehow
[16:56] we emerge from it more than conquerors.
[16:58] not survivors, not even overcomers, but
[17:00] more than conquerors
[17:02] &gt;&gt; through the distress, through this
[17:04] tribulation, through the famine, the
[17:05] nakedness, the peril on the sword. What
[17:07] I'd been studying on uh this week and
[17:09] last week, thinking I'd minister on it
[17:11] tonight, is this thought of nakedness.
[17:12] And there's a lot in the scripture to
[17:14] get your hands around and understand our
[17:16] condition, especially in this leodyian
[17:18] age where we're described in our
[17:20] spiritual condition as naked. But here,
[17:22] this nakedness is included with
[17:23] tribulation and distress and
[17:25] persecution, famine, peril, and sword.
[17:27] So it's all these things that we're to
[17:30] be more than conquerors.
[17:33] In Hebrews chapter 5 6-9 we see Christ
[17:37] here
[17:39] the love of Christ and Christ himself
[17:41] having endured these things
[17:43] says as he he saith also in another
[17:46] place
[17:51] thou art a priest forever after the
[17:53] order of Melzdc
[17:54] who in the days of his flesh when he
[17:57] Christ now had offered up prayers and
[17:59] supplications with strong crying and
[18:01] tears tears unto him that was able to
[18:03] save him from death. Where did we see
[18:05] this? We saw this in the garden where he
[18:07] was in agony. He despared and he even
[18:09] his te his sweat dropped like blood and
[18:12] there's this great agony. What was he
[18:14] wrestling? He was struggling against
[18:15] death
[18:16] &gt;&gt; and in his flesh he offered up prayers
[18:18] and supplications with strong tears and
[18:21] crying unto God who could save him from
[18:24] death and he was heard and that he
[18:26] feared.
[18:28] what you'll see that it I want to point
[18:30] this out that our humanity cries for
[18:33] death,
[18:34] &gt;&gt; right?
[18:35] &gt;&gt; That that's what it it's it's almost
[18:37] hungry for that. It it pursues that it
[18:40] it it's marching to the grave. Our our
[18:43] humanity cries for evil. But here the
[18:45] word was crying for life,
[18:48] &gt;&gt; crying for that good. And though he were
[18:50] a son, yet learned he obedience by the
[18:52] things which he suff suffered. So as he
[18:55] suffered verse 9 and being made perfect
[18:57] he became an author of eternal salvation
[18:58] unto all them that obey him. Brother
[19:01] Brandham in the sermon perfect strength
[19:02] by perfect weaknesses he chose to make
[19:04] Christ the example for us excuse me of
[19:08] us for us and brought him in humility.
[19:11] &gt;&gt; He's using the example of being born in
[19:13] a manger no royal palace and not with
[19:15] all these great fine amenities and great
[19:17] medical attention and a way that you
[19:19] might expect a king to come. But he says
[19:21] he was brought through humility and then
[19:23] he's he achieves this captain of our
[19:27] salvation through suffering through
[19:29] humility
[19:30] and he's an example of us for us.
[19:36] &gt;&gt; This abundance
[19:39] this glory
[19:41] in in in in any part of our lives
[19:43] abundance power blessing all those
[19:44] things that we might desire will come
[19:46] only through need.
[19:49] can only come through weakness,
[19:51] &gt;&gt; right?
[19:52] &gt;&gt; Can only come through pain,
[19:55] &gt;&gt; as much as we would desire that when we
[19:57] become Christians, we unlock some secret
[19:59] uh portal where now everything is just
[20:01] awesome and everything that happens to
[20:04] us, evil's coming at us, we're like
[20:05] wing, we just wave a magic wand and it
[20:08] just changes into something awesome.
[20:10] You're like, "Thanks for the lemonade
[20:11] lemons, right?" And everything's just
[20:14] perfect. No, it doesn't always work. It
[20:16] never works that way. Actually,
[20:17] &gt;&gt; we have no magic wand to turn all the
[20:20] evil that comes our way into a warm
[20:22] fuzzy weighted blanket
[20:25] &gt;&gt; where we just feel, oh, doesn't this
[20:26] feel great? No, we run for the weighted
[20:29] blanket because all the pressures and
[20:30] all the things we experience and all the
[20:32] things we endure. So, this I want to be
[20:34] fruitful. I want to have blessings. I
[20:35] want to have power. It's going to come
[20:37] first by being barren.
[20:39] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[20:40] &gt;&gt; It's going to come through weakness.
[20:41] It's going to come through pain.
[20:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:44] &gt;&gt; John 15:es 1 and two. I am the true
[20:46] vine. My father is the husbandman. Every
[20:49] branch in me that beareth not fruit, he
[20:51] taketh away. So we say, well, there's
[20:53] that burning of a branch. But then he
[20:55] says, in every branch that beareth
[20:57] fruit, he purgeth it that it may bring
[20:59] forth more fruit.
[21:01] &gt;&gt; So we think of the one that's fruitless
[21:03] and that just gets destroyed.
[21:06] But the one that's going to produce
[21:07] fruit, he actually harms.
[21:11] He prunes.
[21:13] &gt;&gt; He purges. He refineses.
[21:16] &gt;&gt; He does something to it. And in doing
[21:18] that, in pruning, in purging, in
[21:20] inflicting some sort of loss or pain on
[21:23] the branch, he's doing it in order to
[21:25] stimulate more growth and more fruit.
[21:28] &gt;&gt; He does it that it may bring forth more
[21:30] fruit.
[21:31] &gt;&gt; In Isaiah 5:6, that which is rejected,
[21:33] it says, "I will lay it waste, and it
[21:35] shall not be pruned nor digged." So
[21:38] these actions of pruning and digging,
[21:40] they may seem to be invasive. It may
[21:43] disturb the soil. it may disturb the
[21:45] branch or the tree. He says, "But there
[21:46] shall come up briars and thorns. I also
[21:49] command the clouds that they rain no
[21:50] more uh that rain no rain upon it."
[21:56] This is God's attitude towards the
[21:58] rejected branch, the rejected vine, the
[22:00] rejected vendor.
[22:03] There's no there's no caring for it
[22:05] anymore. But to that which can bring
[22:08] forth fruit, that which is ordained to
[22:10] bring forth much fruit, he says, "I'm
[22:12] going to purge. I'm going to prune. In
[22:14] Luke 13 6-9, he speaks this parable. A
[22:17] certain man had a fig tree planted in
[22:19] his vineyard. And he came and sought
[22:21] fruit thereon and found none. What was
[22:23] the purpose of the tree? To bring forth
[22:25] fruit. Then said he unto the dresser of
[22:27] his vineyard. Behold, these three years
[22:29] I come seeking fruit on this fig tree
[22:31] and find none. Cut it down. Why
[22:32] cumberereth the ground?
[22:36] I am the vine, and my father is the
[22:37] husbandman. There's the image of a vine
[22:39] which furnishes energy to the branches
[22:41] and the branches are to bear the fruit.
[22:44] But the father is the husband. He's the
[22:46] caretaker of the vine. And here we see
[22:48] this image of one who plants a fig tree
[22:51] and he has one who cares for the tree
[22:53] and he's asking why is there no fruit.
[22:56] So he says just cut it down. But now
[22:58] notice the intercession. And he answered
[22:59] and said unto him Lord let it alone this
[23:01] year also till I shall dig about it and
[23:04] dung it.
[23:04] &gt;&gt; Right?
[23:06] This is an analogy of our lives,
[23:08] &gt;&gt; right? Sometime, don't you feel dug up
[23:10] and dunged, right?
[23:12] &gt;&gt; That's how Mondays are, right? That's
[23:14] how some days feel. This is what life
[23:15] feels like sometimes. Being dug up,
[23:17] uprooted, dug about, pruned, purged,
[23:20] dunged, and it bear fruit well. And if
[23:22] not, then after that, thou shalt cut it
[23:24] down. So when things are getting stinky
[23:26] and things aren't going well, it's a
[23:28] process of God doing something in your
[23:30] life in order to stimulate your ability
[23:32] to be fruitful. Amen.
[23:36] &gt;&gt; Says in Hebrews 12:1, "Now no chastening
[23:38] for the present seemth to be joyous, but
[23:40] grievious. Nevertheless, afterward it
[23:42] yieldeth the peaceable fruit of
[23:44] righteousness unto them which are
[23:46] exercised thereby."
[23:48] &gt;&gt; Right?
[23:49] &gt;&gt; Raise your hand if you don't like
[23:51] exercise,
[23:53] but yet it's necessary. Right?
[23:56] &gt;&gt; Probably shouldn't have laughed that
[23:57] loud, but
[24:00] no correction, chastening, purging, or
[24:02] pruning is happy,
[24:05] but it hurts. It's painful, but it
[24:07] yields fruit.
[24:10] But who does it yield fruit to? Those
[24:12] who are exercised by the pain.
[24:17] This word exercise, it it comes from in
[24:19] the in the Greek being stripped down,
[24:20] laid bare,
[24:22] speaks of nakedness, which is associated
[24:25] with weakness and death.
[24:28] And that what happens when we're
[24:29] corrected, what happens when we suffer,
[24:31] we feel weak, we feel vulnerable, uh
[24:33] we're laid bare, we're stripped down.
[24:36] &gt;&gt; But that's ne it's saying it's that's
[24:38] necessary in order to yield fruit,
[24:42] &gt;&gt; right? Just as a tree which is ordained
[24:44] to bring forth good fruit. It's not just
[24:45] planted and then left alone and it's
[24:47] going to grow and be fruitful. No thorns
[24:49] and briars and all sorts of things will
[24:51] attack it. It'll become malnourished.
[24:52] It'll be crowded out. And so there's a
[24:54] Holy Spirit that goes through your life.
[24:56] It digs about it. It dung it. God uses
[24:58] the word. He uses ministries. He uses
[24:59] all sorts of things and allows things to
[25:02] happen. And instead of looking at as the
[25:03] process of cutting us off and casting us
[25:06] into the furnace, we have to recognize
[25:07] that this is the way that the husbandman
[25:10] ordains us to become fruitful.
[25:13] &gt;&gt; And it cannot happen by leaving us
[25:15] alone.
[25:17] &gt;&gt; We have to be exercised, stripped down,
[25:20] laid bare
[25:22] in the process. I think this is a good
[25:23] analogy. In the process of muscle
[25:25] development,
[25:27] what happens when you're when you do
[25:29] resistance training or lift weights?
[25:30] You're inflicting trauma on your
[25:32] muscles,
[25:33] &gt;&gt; right?
[25:33] &gt;&gt; Some say it's it's micro tears. You're
[25:35] ripping or tearing your muscles, but it
[25:37] is some sort of trauma to a muscle which
[25:41] activates this process of repair and
[25:43] replacement.
[25:44] And that's how obviously you get
[25:46] muscles.
[25:48] That's how you build strength.
[25:51] &gt;&gt; It first has to suffer injury.
[25:54] &gt;&gt; We're just using it in terms because you
[25:57] can you can do it to the point to where
[25:58] it's no longer productive,
[26:00] &gt;&gt; right? And so when God prunes a tree, he
[26:02] doesn't go up there and just hatch it
[26:03] down and cut it down. No, there's
[26:05] there's a there's a science to it, if we
[26:07] could say that. When it comes to uh
[26:10] resistance training and building
[26:11] muscles, you're you're you're causing
[26:13] this uh uh this stimulus, it's a process
[26:16] of these muscles and adapting uh to take
[26:19] on more stimulus leading to growth. And
[26:22] one of the keys to that, I think, is
[26:24] where the analogy works very well, is
[26:26] you you lift maybe to failure. And
[26:28] there's got to be strain. There's got to
[26:29] be stress,
[26:30] &gt;&gt; right?
[26:31] &gt;&gt; That's why I haven't gained weight. No
[26:32] matter how big the sandwich is, I eat,
[26:35] right? I'm lifting. I mean, I'm what? I
[26:38] hunch. I I have the form. Everything's
[26:41] there. I take my plate to the sink,
[26:43] right? I eat to failure,
[26:46] &gt;&gt; but that doesn't that's not going to do
[26:48] it for building muscle. It builds bulk,
[26:51] trust me, but it won't build muscle. And
[26:54] so, there has to be strain. There some
[26:56] ways has to be failure. There has to be
[26:58] an exertion. There has to actually be,
[27:00] and I'm not trying to encourage
[27:01] everybody to go out and rip their
[27:02] muscles up, but there has to be some
[27:04] sort of trauma or it's some people
[27:06] called a threat. The muscles have to
[27:08] feel threatened
[27:10] &gt;&gt; and say, "Woo, we better be ready next
[27:12] time."
[27:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, right.
[27:14] &gt;&gt; We better repair and replace because the
[27:18] next time we feel that stress, we want
[27:20] to break past that.
[27:21] &gt;&gt; You following me?
[27:23] &gt;&gt; This is it. Now, I say this all for the
[27:24] gym rats that are here. uh that that
[27:26] this is that process of building our
[27:29] muscles. But if you really want to build
[27:30] your muscles, you there has to be rest
[27:34] &gt;&gt; because if you don't rest, you can
[27:35] injure yourself.
[27:37] &gt;&gt; The muscles won't have a chance to
[27:38] repair and replace. And so God, that's
[27:40] just an analogy of what God does in our
[27:43] lives where there's times of stress,
[27:44] there's times of trial, there's times of
[27:46] fighting, but God's going to allow the
[27:48] rest so that you can build up faith
[27:51] muscle. So the next time you face that
[27:52] test,
[27:54] &gt;&gt; that stimulus, the provoking, the
[27:55] threat, the trauma, faith says, "Woo,
[27:57] here we go."
[27:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:59] &gt;&gt; And it's a new PR,
[28:02] &gt;&gt; but the rest is needed. In Ecclesiastes
[28:05] chapter 3:10,
[28:08] I've seen the travail which God have
[28:10] given to the sons of men to be exercised
[28:12] in it.
[28:14] There's a lot to be read in the
[28:16] scriptures about exercise.
[28:18] The Bible says, "Bodily exercise
[28:20] profitth little."
[28:22] I know that uh a lot of us could use
[28:24] that as an excuse not to exercise at
[28:26] all, but a little profit is still some
[28:29] profit.
[28:30] &gt;&gt; But it does even speak to how sometimes
[28:32] our theatrics, bodily theatrics, when it
[28:34] comes to church worship,
[28:36] &gt;&gt; doesn't move the needle with God.
[28:40] &gt;&gt; But he's seen the travail which God hath
[28:41] given to the sons of men to be exercised
[28:43] in it. That means afflicted or bowed
[28:45] down, weakened. I've seen the travail
[28:48] that exercises mankind.
[28:51] I've seen how it presses on them and
[28:53] they endure it and they're weakened by
[28:55] it. They're bowed down. They suffer
[28:56] trauma. They're threatened by it. They
[28:59] suffer all these micro tears. This
[29:01] exercising
[29:03] by travail in Hebrews 5:14, "But strong
[29:07] meek belongth to them that are full age,
[29:09] even those who by reason of use have
[29:11] their senses exercised to discern both
[29:14] good and evil."
[29:15] There has to be exercise.
[29:18] There has to be a a laying bare. There
[29:20] has to be an affliction. There has to be
[29:22] a bowing down. There has to be a
[29:23] weakening,
[29:25] a press, a pressure, a trauma, a threat.
[29:29] You don't get strong.
[29:32] You don't grow. You don't develop
[29:36] properly. As brother man might say, in a
[29:38] hot house plant
[29:40] &gt;&gt; in a sterile environment. One of the
[29:42] reasons why we have more sicknesses and
[29:44] diseases now more than ever is we try to
[29:46] create everything so sterile.
[29:48] &gt;&gt; And some of the advice at one time was
[29:50] just go eat some dirt,
[29:51] &gt;&gt; right?
[29:52] &gt;&gt; Get your gut back in balance. We don't
[29:55] eat enough dirt. We don't eat enough
[29:56] bugs anymore as kid little kids. We used
[29:58] to be outside playing and doing certain
[30:00] things. And there used to be a lot of
[30:01] things that we would uh face and we'd be
[30:03] tested with and we build up an endurance
[30:05] to. This is the pattern we see in the
[30:08] scripture that strong meat belongs to
[30:10] the mature who have had to suffer, who
[30:12] have had to exercise, who've had to have
[30:15] been threatened, who have have been in
[30:17] situations where maybe they fell or they
[30:19] got hurt, but they learned from it.
[30:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:21] &gt;&gt; They repaired and replaced and the next
[30:23] time they found themselves in that
[30:24] situation that they were the ones who
[30:26] could handle the strong meat,
[30:28] &gt;&gt; right?
[30:30] &gt;&gt; You've heard the phrase no no pain no
[30:32] gain goes all the way back to ancient
[30:34] Greek poetry. One poet wrote, "But
[30:36] before the road of excellence, the
[30:38] immortal gods have placed sweat."
[30:42] If there's going to be excellence,
[30:43] there's going to be glory. There's
[30:44] travail. There's p uh there's there's
[30:46] testing.
[30:47] &gt;&gt; There's a Hebrew expression, according
[30:49] to the pain is the reward.
[30:52] It's only through exercise that we're
[30:54] rewarded.
[30:57] One poet wrote in the 1600s, "If little
[30:59] labor, little are gains, man's fortune,
[31:03] fortunes is according to his pains."
[31:06] These are just observances.
[31:09] If you want a little, just labor little
[31:12] and you'll get little gains,
[31:14] &gt;&gt; right?
[31:14] &gt;&gt; But your fortunes, your fate, your
[31:16] reward is according to your pains.
[31:19] &gt;&gt; In Hebrews 11:34, on these heroes of
[31:22] faith, it says they quenched the
[31:23] violence of fire. They escaped the edge
[31:24] of the sword. Out of weakness were made
[31:26] strong. Wax valiant and fight. Turned to
[31:29] flight the armies of the aliens.
[31:32] You could read this. They quenched. They
[31:33] escaped. They were valiant and fight.
[31:35] They turned to flight the armies of the
[31:37] aliens. But right in the middle, this
[31:39] seeming to be this hub between these
[31:41] four different great momentous victories
[31:43] is they were made strong through
[31:46] weakness.
[31:47] Before their victory, they had to have
[31:49] affliction.
[31:51] They had to undergo necessity before
[31:54] overcoming,
[31:55] &gt;&gt; right?
[31:56] &gt;&gt; They could not just walk into a battle
[31:59] clean, refreshed, innocent, and pure and
[32:03] go out there and go, "Oh, look at these
[32:04] nice, well-dressed warriors coming to
[32:06] me. Hi, how are you doing?" No, they had
[32:10] to suffer. Did recognize the moment, the
[32:12] call, what was at risk, what was at
[32:14] hand.
[32:16] Brother Brandham says this, even
[32:18] referring to this very scripture here in
[32:19] perfect strength by perfect weakness.
[32:21] Anybody here listen to this or read this
[32:23] within the last month or two? Maybe a
[32:25] couple of you, maybe none of you.
[32:28] Perfect strength by perfect weakness.
[32:30] They had to get weak before they could
[32:31] get strong.
[32:33] &gt;&gt; This is this is his commentary on
[32:34] Hebrews 11:34. They had to get weak
[32:36] before they could get strong. Out of
[32:38] their weakness, they were made strong.
[32:40] How did they quench the violence of
[32:42] fire? They knew what fire was.
[32:45] How did they escape the edge of the
[32:46] sword? They'd felt the edge of it
[32:48] before. They could appreciate it. They
[32:49] knew what it was. How' they wax valiant
[32:51] in the fight? They weren't afraid of
[32:52] fighting because they'd been in it. But
[32:54] they turned to flight the armies of the
[32:55] aliens. These are all the things they
[32:57] had to first though become strong
[32:59] through weakness. And he says, "Here's
[33:01] something to console us. Here's
[33:03] something that encourages.
[33:05] Out of weakness and humility, God
[33:07] chooses the people to build his kingdom
[33:09] out of. If we ever get to heaven, if we
[33:12] ever stand in the presence of God with
[33:13] his church, he'll stand in a we'll stand
[33:16] in a bunch of people that's been weak
[33:18] and rejected and cast out by the world
[33:20] and know it nothings.
[33:23] &gt;&gt; Not know it alls, know it nothings.
[33:26] &gt;&gt; If we make it to heaven, we stand in the
[33:28] presence of God with his bride. We will
[33:30] stand with a bunch of people that are
[33:32] weak, rejected, cast out, and knoweth
[33:34] nothings.
[33:35] &gt;&gt; No doubt that's the vantage point of the
[33:38] world.
[33:39] They look at you as weak,
[33:41] &gt;&gt; brainwashed,
[33:43] &gt;&gt; rejected, cast out by the world to know
[33:45] it nothings. But he says he begins to
[33:47] build a character, begins to take this
[33:49] weakness and make his own self.
[33:54] &gt;&gt; What does it take? It takes that
[33:55] weakness.
[33:57] &gt;&gt; The world looks at it, scoffs at it,
[33:59] laughs at it. They call it weakness.
[34:03] They would say that's not living. In 1
[34:06] Corinthians chapter 1 18-31
[34:10] says for for the preaching of the cross
[34:12] is to them that perish foolishness. So
[34:15] actually to those who die who succumb to
[34:17] death and it's uh it's rotten process
[34:21] it's foolishness. The preach of the
[34:22] cross is foolishness but unto us which
[34:24] are saved it is the power of God
[34:27] &gt;&gt; life and death. For it is written I will
[34:29] destroy the wisdom of the wise and will
[34:31] bring to nothing the understanding of
[34:32] the prudent. What is it that's destroyed
[34:34] and comes to nothing? Those that think
[34:36] they're wise. Those that think they're
[34:38] something. Where is the wise? Where is
[34:40] the scribe? Where's the disputer of this
[34:42] world? Hath not God made foolish the
[34:44] wisdom of this world? Paul has stood in
[34:47] those argument circles.
[34:49] &gt;&gt; He stood before the philosophers? He
[34:51] stood before the poets? He stood in the
[34:52] halls of those that discussed these
[34:54] great matters pertaining to life. Said,
[34:56] "Who's the disputer of this world? Hath
[34:58] not God made foolish the wisdom of this
[35:00] world? For after that in the wisdom of
[35:02] God, the world by wisdom knew not God.
[35:04] It pleased God by foolishness of
[35:06] preaching to save them that believe.
[35:08] Then he gets into the dynamics of all
[35:11] belief systems and what people their
[35:13] worldviews and what they value. The Jews
[35:15] require a sign and the Greeks seek
[35:16] wisdom. But we preach Christ crucified.
[35:20] Unto the Jews a stumbling block because
[35:21] they want signs and the Greeks uh and
[35:24] the Greeks foolishness.
[35:29] But unto them which are called, both
[35:30] Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of
[35:33] God, and the wisdom of God.
[35:36] And then notice verse 25. Because the
[35:38] foolishness of God is wiser than men,
[35:40] and the weakness of God is stronger than
[35:43] men. Not that God is weak, but that
[35:45] which men perceive as weakness.
[35:48] Why? Why use why use dynamics like this
[35:51] on a Wednesday night to strengthen his
[35:53] people?
[35:53] &gt;&gt; Right?
[35:54] &gt;&gt; Why use this? We might say, well, this
[35:56] is what the world calls foolishness.
[35:58] These are antiquated precepts. This is a
[36:00] this is an old way of trying to convey
[36:02] thoughts that we probably shouldn't use
[36:04] it. It's more efficient, costefficient,
[36:06] and you can monetize it a lot better if
[36:08] you just do podcast. If you just do
[36:10] shorts, if you just get on to some of
[36:12] the social media and make sure people
[36:14] mash that like button and click the sub
[36:16] subscribe. There's a lot of other ways
[36:18] people may think this gospel can be
[36:20] packaged. But yet God has ordained what
[36:22] the world calls foolishness
[36:24] &gt;&gt; to bring the power of deliverance.
[36:27] &gt;&gt; That's weakness. They say, but this is
[36:29] stronger than men. For you see your
[36:33] calling, brethren, how that not many
[36:34] wise men after the flesh, not many
[36:36] mighty, not many noble are called. God
[36:38] usually chooses the weak, the debase,
[36:40] the rejected. But God hath chosen the
[36:43] foolish things of the world to confound
[36:45] the wise. And God hath chosen the weak
[36:47] things of the world to confound the
[36:48] things which are mighty, mighty in this
[36:51] world, great in wisdom. God has this
[36:53] inverse to where it's the weak things
[36:57] and base things of the world and things
[36:59] which are despised hath God chosen. Yay,
[37:01] the things which are not to bring bring
[37:03] to not things that are that no flesh
[37:07] should glory in his presence.
[37:09] That's his reason for doing it.
[37:12] If he chose somebody smart, then they
[37:14] may say it's the smarts,
[37:15] &gt;&gt; right?
[37:16] &gt;&gt; If that's all he ever chose was the
[37:18] smart ones,
[37:19] &gt;&gt; right?
[37:19] &gt;&gt; If all if if there was a certain metric
[37:21] that we could distill it down to, so it
[37:23] was everybody that was born in this
[37:25] local at this age and does this and does
[37:27] that and acts this way and does that
[37:28] way, then we would put it all into those
[37:30] physical attributes, those intellectual
[37:32] prowess or whatever it might be. And God
[37:33] says, "I I'm going to use the fullness
[37:35] of the preaching through so many
[37:37] different ways and means and
[37:39] personalities that you can't ascribe it
[37:41] to any particular human or fleshly
[37:44] attribute because no flesh will glory in
[37:46] his presence. But of him are ye in
[37:48] Christ whom God has made unto us wisdom
[37:50] and righteousness and sanctification and
[37:52] redemption that according as it is
[37:53] written, he that glorifi glorif
[37:55] glorieth, let him glory in the Lord."
[38:00] What God calls strong, the world calls
[38:02] weak.
[38:03] &gt;&gt; And what the world says strong, God
[38:04] looks at it and says that's weak.
[38:07] &gt;&gt; In the sermon, perfect strength by
[38:09] perfect weakness, brother said it's the
[38:10] simplicity of the gospel that staggers
[38:12] the people. They want something great.
[38:16] Let's be careful. Even as message
[38:18] believers, we see just how extraordinary
[38:22] prophecy is fulfilled. We see the great
[38:24] signs and wonders performed. uh uh we
[38:26] read of and we've seen great signs and
[38:27] wonders and there's ways that the
[38:29] ministry was so vindicated in brother
[38:30] Bon's ministry. There's a lot that we
[38:32] get focused on. We think, "Oh, this is
[38:34] so great. This ought to be this should
[38:35] go to the Vatican. This should be
[38:37] published this way. Everyone should be
[38:38] able to believe that this this should be
[38:40] presented in such a way where the all
[38:42] the critics and all the skeptics have to
[38:44] accept it. But that's not how God
[38:46] works."
[38:49] &gt;&gt; It's the simplicity of it that staggers
[38:51] the people. They try to make it a great
[38:52] intellectual something another when it's
[38:55] the simpleness.
[38:58] But God, this is so amazing. But God
[39:01] takes the very tool of humility and
[39:03] weakness and simplicity to work his
[39:04] works with you. That's only a tool in
[39:07] God's hand. Humiliation is a tool being
[39:11] exercise suffering and affliction. Tools
[39:13] of humility and weakness and simplicity.
[39:16] These are tools that God can work with.
[39:20] In 2 Corinthians chapter 6:es 1-10, if
[39:23] we just look at it from the standpoint
[39:24] of what staggers people, what stumbles
[39:25] people, he says, 'We then as workers
[39:27] together with him, beseech you also that
[39:30] ye receive not the grace of God in vain.
[39:32] For he saith, I have heard thee, in a
[39:34] time accepted, and the day of salvation
[39:35] have I helped thee, secured thee.
[39:37] Behold, now is the accepted time.
[39:39] Behold, now is the day of salvation.
[39:41] Verse three, giving no offense in
[39:43] anything. Does this mean that ministers
[39:46] of God live perfect lives and are so
[39:50] blessed to where everyone know you know
[39:51] that's a minister because you could tell
[39:53] their car doesn't have a ding in it. No
[39:55] scratch, right? They they they wear the
[39:58] nicest clothes. They have the softest of
[40:00] leathers, right? Everything's just
[40:02] perfect. And you just kind of walk by
[40:04] and you just feel like, "Oh my goodness,
[40:06] the presence of God is so great." And
[40:07] that's how we know because they get
[40:09] there's no offense in anything. Everyone
[40:10] just loves them, right? Eat for free
[40:12] everywhere.
[40:15] giving no offense in anything that the
[40:16] ministry be not blamed. But now notice
[40:18] what he begins to say because this this
[40:21] blame on the ministry isn't that they're
[40:22] without suffering, without persecution.
[40:24] He says, "But in all things approving
[40:26] ourselves as the ministers of God,
[40:29] acting above, conducting ourselves in
[40:31] much patience, in afflictions, in
[40:33] necessities, in distresses, in stripes,
[40:36] and imprisonments, and tumults, and
[40:37] labors, and watchings, and fastings."
[40:40] Okay. Uh all right. I had only first
[40:43] read up to verse three and maybe a
[40:45] little bit there and approving all
[40:47] things and being good and we're all
[40:48] good, right? And give honor or double
[40:50] honor to the preachers, right? Never
[40:52] live any higher than your pastor
[40:53] teaches, right? Yes. I'm going to at
[40:55] least establish the ceiling here. This
[40:58] says in all things such as afflictions,
[41:01] necessities, distresses, stripes,
[41:03] imprisonments, tomos, labors, watchings,
[41:04] fastings. But then there's this other
[41:06] sides. By puress, by knowledge, by
[41:08] longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy
[41:10] Ghost, by love unfeigned, by the word of
[41:11] truth, by the power of God, by the armor
[41:14] of righteousness on the right hand and
[41:15] on the left, by honor and dishonor, by
[41:18] evil report and good report, as
[41:19] deceivers and yet true, as unknown and
[41:22] yet well-known, as dying and behold, we
[41:24] live. As chastened and not killed. Quite
[41:26] the life.
[41:28] Quite the life of those who are called
[41:30] to truth.
[41:31] &gt;&gt; Right?
[41:31] &gt;&gt; This is not just a calling for
[41:33] ministers. This is not just those who
[41:34] are called to be fellow laborers as he's
[41:36] saying we working together are to give
[41:38] no offense in anything as the ministry
[41:40] uh uh is to not be blamed but this blame
[41:43] has nothing to do with what you suffer.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; This blame does not have to do with the
[41:47] fact that oh well look there's
[41:48] afflictions, there's necessities,
[41:50] there's death. There's people that keep
[41:52] a running roll of the the people who've
[41:55] lost spouses and children a a and
[41:58] suffered sicknesses and cancer and they
[42:00] use it as a mark against their ministry.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; Wow. Well, that's exactly the reason why
[42:04] people rejected Jesus.
[42:06] &gt;&gt; Fact that he died.
[42:08] &gt;&gt; It's one of the biggest marks they put
[42:10] on brother Brandham is the manner in
[42:11] which he died
[42:13] &gt;&gt; by puress though by knowledge by
[42:15] longsuffering by kindness by the Holy
[42:17] Ghost by love and fame. In the midst of
[42:19] afflictions, necessities, distresses,
[42:22] stripes, imprisonments, tumults, labors,
[42:23] watchings, fastings,
[42:26] dying, and behold, we live as chastened
[42:28] and not killed. As sorrowful yet always
[42:29] rejoicing, as poor yet making many rich,
[42:33] as having nothing and yet possessing all
[42:35] things. What a paradox.
[42:38] Could it be that these afflictions,
[42:41] necessities, distresses, stripes,
[42:42] imprisonments, tols, labors, watchings
[42:45] is what brings the puress, the
[42:47] knowledge, the kindness, the
[42:48] longsuffering, the love unfeigned, the
[42:51] power of God. The armor of righteousness
[42:55] is what brings honor through dishonor,
[42:58] good report through evil report.
[43:01] Though accused of being a deceiver, yet
[43:02] true, unknown, yet well-known, dying,
[43:04] and behold, we live as chastened and not
[43:05] killed.
[43:07] sorrowful yet rejoice and is poor yet
[43:09] making many rich though not maybe
[43:11] themselves and has nothing I have
[43:12] nothing but it's in that nothing that I
[43:16] actually possess all things
[43:19] &gt;&gt; that's life by death
[43:22] in 1 Corinthians 12 18 to 24
[43:27] says but now God hath set the members
[43:29] every one of them in the body by one
[43:31] spirit we're all baptized into one body
[43:33] this analogy of the human body is used
[43:35] to describe the body of Christ but then
[43:37] You are also that body individually
[43:40] &gt;&gt; as a human body as a human. These same
[43:42] things apply to your existence. So
[43:44] there's a lot of levels that you can
[43:45] apply this on. But God has tempered the
[43:47] body together. He's made you a certain
[43:49] way with certain parts and functions
[43:51] within your body. There's this high
[43:53] level view of the body of Christ in the
[43:54] same way. And if they were all one
[43:56] member, where were the body? But now are
[43:59] they many members yet one body? And the
[44:01] eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no
[44:03] need of thee. Nor again the head to the
[44:05] feet, I have no need of you. Okay. Much
[44:07] more those members of the body which
[44:09] seem to be more weak, more feeble, more
[44:12] inferior.
[44:14] &gt;&gt; Less useful
[44:16] are necessary.
[44:18] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of things in our lives.
[44:19] I'm great. I'm strong. I can do this. I
[44:21] can do that. And why can't I enjoy this?
[44:24] Why can't I have that? Why am I not used
[44:25] for this? Why why can't I always be on
[44:27] the mountain top? Says, well, there's
[44:28] times in our lives, there's parts of
[44:29] your character. There's parts in your
[44:31] personality, your experience that we
[44:33] think, oh, well, what about the great
[44:34] things? What about the grandeur? What
[44:35] about these these these lofty parts of
[44:38] the head and the eye? But he says
[44:40] there's these things that are weaker.
[44:43] &gt;&gt; They seem to be uh unnecessary, but they
[44:46] are necessary. They're needed.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; And those members of the body which we
[44:50] think to be less honorable upon these we
[44:52] bestow more abundant honor.
[44:55] And our uncumbly parts have more
[44:57] abundant comeliness. Notice how he's
[44:59] saying this. The parts that are ugly is
[45:01] what brings forth the greatest beauty.
[45:04] I have a place in this local church
[45:08] for our coming parts have no need. But
[45:09] God hath tempered the body together
[45:11] having given more abundant honor to the
[45:13] part which lacked.
[45:16] This weakness is necessary for power.
[45:19] This feebleness is necessary. We need
[45:21] weaknesses. It's this way in the body.
[45:23] It's this way in the body of Christ. And
[45:25] he's saying that this more abundant
[45:27] beauty comes from that necessity.
[45:30] We say every part beautiful, every part
[45:32] strong. Well, what what kind of monster
[45:34] would that create?
[45:36] You realize God, this master, this
[45:38] creator knows beauty and symmetry.
[45:42] And he said here that these parts that
[45:43] seem to be weak were necessary.
[45:46] The parts that seem to be ugly are the
[45:48] ones that bring forth the great beauty.
[45:52] Brother Brandman's sermon, Perfect
[45:53] Strength by Perfect Weakness, says get
[45:55] weak. What's that phrase? Get wrecked or
[45:58] something that people tell you, you
[45:59] know, stay humble, stay low. But he
[46:01] says, "Get weak. Find out you're human."
[46:04] &gt;&gt; Hello. Okay. Need to remember that one,
[46:08] &gt;&gt; right? For myself. Get weak. Find out
[46:12] you're human. This is what we've got to
[46:13] do.
[46:15] We've got to get weak. Find out we're
[46:16] human. Find out these human weaknesses.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; And there's none of your intellectuals
[46:22] can do. Human weakness will never be
[46:24] used of God.
[46:26] Human weaknesses will never be used of
[46:28] God. I know that may seem if you know
[46:29] the sermon that's quite an eye-catching
[46:31] statement. God by the human weaknesses
[46:33] pours himself into you.
[46:36] So it's not that we can say well I am so
[46:38] glad that I am so flawed that God has a
[46:41] full arsenal
[46:43] to use but rather he God by the weakness
[46:48] wants to pour himself into you. So you
[46:51] have to make use of
[46:54] you have to make use of the weakness to
[46:56] yield
[46:58] &gt;&gt; not defend.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; I I read an analogy one time that it it
[47:02] helped me to understand this point that
[47:03] was trying to be made because really
[47:05] when we think about God making himself
[47:06] known and even I mentioned it on Sunday
[47:09] how that the evil in this world is the
[47:11] absence of God but it's that which is
[47:13] declaring his presence. It's how that we
[47:15] know him is because of that great
[47:17] contrast. And and I read one time this
[47:19] analogy of two people being locked in
[47:22] prison and there being a prison wall
[47:25] that separated them and they
[47:27] communicated by knocking on that wall.
[47:30] And the very thing that separate them
[47:32] separated them was the very means
[47:34] through which they communicated.
[47:37] &gt;&gt; And so when we look at our lives, we
[47:38] think of the separation. We think of the
[47:40] pain. We think of all these things we go
[47:41] through and this suffering and these
[47:43] weaknesses. though the weakness has to
[47:45] be there. And it's not the it's not that
[47:48] the weakness is what God wants to use,
[47:50] but it's necessary in order for God to
[47:52] use us.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:54] &gt;&gt; Because then he pours himself into you.
[47:56] Then he uses himself. He says, you just
[47:58] become an instrument. I know we've all
[48:00] been called a tool once or twice, but
[48:02] here he says you're an instrument.
[48:03] Certainly, you've got to get yourself
[48:05] out of the way.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; We've always said that about the
[48:08] preacher, but it's about you.
[48:11] &gt;&gt; You've got to get yourself out of the
[48:12] way.
[48:15] 2 Corinthians chapter 13:es 1 to10.
[48:18] Since you seek proof of Christ speaking
[48:19] in me, which to you word is not weak,
[48:22] but is mighty in you.
[48:24] Ju um if you could just stay stay
[48:27] focused with me. We're not going to be
[48:28] too much longer here. This scripture
[48:30] here has got a lot a lot to wrestle
[48:33] with, but I hope I can just use it
[48:34] through this theme that brother Brandon
[48:36] preaches in perfect strength to see
[48:38] this. You want proof of Christ speaking
[48:40] in me, which to you is not weak, but
[48:41] it's powerful in you. The gospel, the
[48:44] preaching of the cross, but yet he
[48:46] suffers. He talks about all his
[48:47] sufferings and what he's endured.
[48:49] Chapter six, he talks about his
[48:50] distresses and necessities and
[48:51] afflictions. I don't know that he had a
[48:53] complex, but he was certainly conscious
[48:55] of all the things he's going through.
[48:58] He says, "For though he," speaking of
[49:00] Christ, he was crucified through
[49:03] weakness.
[49:05] Now really wrap
[49:08] like like focus on that. Ponder that for
[49:10] a little bit. He was crucified through
[49:12] weakness. Yet he liveth by the power of
[49:14] God. Brought low, laid in a grave,
[49:17] crucified on the cross through weakness,
[49:20] but yet then lives by the power of God.
[49:22] For we also are weak in him,
[49:25] &gt;&gt; but we shall live with him by the power
[49:27] of God toward you.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; So there's this. He was made an example
[49:31] of us for us.
[49:34] crucified through weakness that the
[49:36] power of God can live through him. But
[49:37] now we are weak in him. We have to
[49:39] become weak in him that we can live with
[49:42] him by the power of God towards us. So
[49:44] he says, "Examine yourselves whether you
[49:45] be in the faith. Prove your own selves.
[49:47] Know you not your own selves how that
[49:49] Christ is in you except you be
[49:50] reprobates.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; But I trust ye shall know that we are
[49:54] not reprobates." Now I pray to God that
[49:56] you do no evil. I want you to see this
[49:59] alternating theme of good and evil
[50:00] through these. Not that we should appear
[50:03] approved, but that you should do that
[50:05] which is honest, though we be as
[50:07] reprobates. This is the just man who
[50:10] wants to be good, not just appear good.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; This is the one that wants to be right,
[50:16] wants to know truth, not just appear so.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; You should do that which is honest,
[50:23] though we be as reprobates, though we
[50:24] may seem to suffer, though we not have
[50:26] these best places and opportunities. He
[50:28] says, "For we could do nothing against
[50:29] the truth, but for the truth.
[50:32] For we are glad when we are weak and
[50:35] you're strong." This is how Paul is
[50:38] making the gospel beneficial to them.
[50:40] This also we wish even your perfection.
[50:44] Therefore, I write these things being
[50:45] absent lest present I should be I should
[50:48] use sharpness according to the power
[50:50] which the Lord hath given me to
[50:52] edification and not to destruction.
[50:56] God makes strength out of weakness.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; Christ was crucified through weakness.
[51:05] The Corinthian church is receiving
[51:07] strength through weakness.
[51:10] Jacob received power of God. Received
[51:12] power to be called a prince with God
[51:14] after he had wrestled and was afflicted.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; He had to wrestle it out all night. He
[51:19] had to suffer. Paul's education,
[51:21] theology were stripped away from him in
[51:22] order for him to become a prophet to the
[51:24] Gentiles. He didn't emerge from the
[51:26] schools of the Pharisees. He didn't
[51:28] emerge blameless in the law. He didn't
[51:30] emerge from that and just one day uh
[51:32] step forward as this one who was killing
[51:33] and crucifying a and putting us under
[51:36] the children of God and all of a sudden
[51:38] said, "Well, you know what? I just kind
[51:39] of changed my mind.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; This is right." And how many people have
[51:43] tried to take that p just do a full 180
[51:45] and say, "You know what? I know I did it
[51:46] for decades, said this was true, but now
[51:48] it's not true. And let's just kind of
[51:50] keep this good thing going if we could."
[51:51] Sure.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; But he had to suffer
[51:56] in order to become that apostle.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; If you look into the scripture, whether
[52:00] it be in Hebrews 11, and I can
[52:03] especially say this here where he says,
[52:04] "Christ was crucified through weakness.
[52:06] In every instance, if I could put it
[52:07] this way, the thing that ought have sunk
[52:09] the ship kept it afloat."
[52:13] In every instance, the means by which it
[52:15] was to be destroyed brought it life.
[52:19] Kill them, bury them, put them in the
[52:20] ground. What did he do? He just
[52:22] multiplied.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; Christ was crucified through weakness,
[52:25] but it was necessary to bring God's
[52:27] power.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; In Acts 4:es 23-31, I use this scripture
[52:32] just to point out
[52:34] this remarkable uh interruption
[52:38] in the flow of this narrative. The
[52:41] church is gathered together and they
[52:42] hear about the the the persecutions and
[52:45] the and the threatenings that are coming
[52:47] to the early church there at Jerusalem.
[52:48] And being let go, they went to their own
[52:50] company and reported all that the chief
[52:52] priests and elders had said under the
[52:54] threat the punishment could come to
[52:55] them. And they when they heard that,
[52:56] they lifted up their voice to God with
[52:58] one accord and said, Lord, thou art God
[53:00] which hath made heaven and earth and the
[53:02] sea and all that in them is who by the
[53:04] mouth of thy servant David has said, why
[53:06] did the heathen rage and the people
[53:08] imagine vain things?
[53:10] &gt;&gt; Why are they breathing out these
[53:11] threatenings? Why are they threatening
[53:13] to put it kill us? Why are they telling
[53:14] us to no longer preach in the name of
[53:16] Christ? The kings of the earth stood up,
[53:18] and the rulers were gathered together
[53:20] against the Lord and against his Christ.
[53:22] For of a truth against the holy child
[53:24] Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both
[53:26] Herod and Pontius Pilate with the
[53:28] Gentiles, and the people of Israel were
[53:30] gathered together. It's quite a um a
[53:33] league,
[53:34] &gt;&gt; right?
[53:36] &gt;&gt; Herod, Pilate, Gentiles, Israel, they're
[53:39] all gathered against Christ.
[53:42] So, here they are. They're all
[53:43] gathering. And what do they have? They
[53:45] have one purpose to destroy Christ.
[53:48] Verse 28 says, "For to do whatsoever thy
[53:50] hand and thy counsel determined before
[53:52] to be done." That interrupts it.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; They all gathered against Christ and
[53:59] they stood up against him to kill
[54:01] Christ, to put him in a grave. And you
[54:04] stopped it. He says, "No. Uh-uh. To do
[54:06] whatever you had determined beforehand."
[54:11] God did not deprive Christ of this
[54:14] suffering or this affliction. God does
[54:15] not deprive us from adversity or
[54:17] affliction, but he uses it to fulfill
[54:20] his purpose.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; When they had gathered together, we
[54:23] would expect it to say that he stopped
[54:25] their hands. But they did whatever God
[54:27] had ordained. And now, Lord, behold
[54:29] their threatenings.
[54:31] They succeeded in crucifying Christ. And
[54:34] now, this is the example that they now
[54:36] use is now we're being threatened. And
[54:38] he says, "Grant unto thy servants that
[54:39] with all boldness they may speak the
[54:41] word. Do they're not praying. Let them
[54:44] no longer threaten us, but in the face
[54:46] of the threats, in the face of the
[54:47] affliction, in the face of the threat of
[54:50] crucifixion, just like Christ, let me
[54:52] stand firm even as he did."
[54:55] &gt;&gt; You don't have to give me a vision that
[54:57] I will not face temptation. You don't
[54:59] have to give me a vision that I will not
[55:00] be persecuted. You don't have to give me
[55:01] a vision that I will not suffer trial or
[55:04] trauma or afflict injury. But Lord, give
[55:06] me boldness to declare thy word
[55:09] &gt;&gt; by stretching forth thine hand to heal
[55:11] and that signs and wonders may be done
[55:12] by the name of the holy child Jesus.
[55:15] When they had prayed, the place was
[55:16] shaken where they were assembled
[55:17] together and they were filled with the
[55:19] Holy Ghost and they spake the word of
[55:21] God with boldness.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; Because they were willing to brave it.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; They were willing to face it. Christ was
[55:27] an example of us for us.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; So in the face of it, they said we have
[55:32] to be faithful unto death.
[55:34] In the face of this, God's not going to
[55:37] deprive us. He's not going to take
[55:39] adversity and cast it down. It's going
[55:41] to hit us.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; It's going to come.
[55:45] So they prayed, "Lord, give us
[55:46] boldness." And when they were willing to
[55:48] accept the weakness,
[55:50] &gt;&gt; the power of God fell.
[55:53] Brother Abram said, "Get empty, friends.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; Get weak."
[55:59] He says, "Get weak. Find out you're
[56:00] human." Now he says, "Get empty,
[56:01] friends. Get weak. Deny your own
[56:03] ability.
[56:04] Empty yourselves out.
[56:07] Pour out upon God's altar. Pour
[56:09] yourselves out upon God's altar as a
[56:10] sacrifice. Let the angel come with the
[56:12] cold of fire. Fill that vessel with the
[56:14] power of the almighty God. And then
[56:15] he'll make you strong. And listen, he
[56:18] will give you grace to stand.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; I I hope I could say I want to be able
[56:28] to say this.
[56:30] I think there's sometimes it's just so
[56:32] difficult to articulate.
[56:34] If God asked us stand to asked us to
[56:37] stand in line to receive a blessing and
[56:41] we knew we just had to wait in line,
[56:44] we would do it,
[56:47] right?
[56:48] &gt;&gt; I mean, come on. All of you who've
[56:49] waited in line for what? The iPhone two,
[56:55] the popup taco stand, right?
[56:58] Joe's Farm Grill in Gilbert. We've
[57:02] waited in line a long time for things,
[57:04] but we do it because we're going to have
[57:05] the honor and the privilege of checking
[57:07] in on Yelp and saying that we visited
[57:09] this place. We're going to be able to
[57:11] get Instagrammable pictures.
[57:13] And there's a lot that we'll endure for
[57:15] the clout.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; There's a lot we'll endure for the
[57:17] blessing, for the strength, and for the
[57:19] power. And if it was merely this
[57:21] glorious offering of ourselves to be
[57:24] commended in the eyes of the brethren to
[57:26] be welcomed into heaven and received as
[57:27] this great triumphant acceptor of
[57:29] Christ,
[57:31] you'd flood to it. But he doesn't ask
[57:34] you to just stand in line. He says take
[57:36] up the cross,
[57:38] &gt;&gt; deny yourself.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; And it's in the denying of self that
[57:42] becomes the rub. As a matter of fact, I
[57:45] believe that if he just asked you to
[57:46] simply be a martyr and that's all you
[57:48] had to do is be a martyr, you'd do it.
[57:49] But there's some denying yourself in the
[57:51] process.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; There's this process of of being
[57:55] stripped, laid bare,
[57:58] he says, get weak, get empty, find out
[58:02] you're human. And when you can empty
[58:05] yourself out all your vanity, all your
[58:07] pride, when you can be willing to feel
[58:08] that own debasement and recognize human
[58:11] weakness and that there's nothing in you
[58:12] that is good that you can offer to him
[58:14] by way of saying, you know what, I think
[58:16] you've done figured this out by now. He
[58:17] says, then he'll give you grace to
[58:19] stand.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; It's not standing in line. We could do
[58:23] that of our own accord, but when we're
[58:24] willing to just lay ourselves down
[58:26] completely useless and spent that his
[58:29] grace steps in and lifts us up.
[58:33] So Paul, he's using this used the
[58:35] scripture in the beginning in 2
[58:36] Corinthians chapter 12.
[58:38] He said because of these great
[58:40] revelations I've had, he said he
[58:43] received a thorn in the flesh.
[58:55] Just want to make sure I'm not missing
[58:56] anything here.
[59:14] He has a thorn in the flesh because of
[59:16] the revelations
[59:20] is a necessary evil.
[59:22] And this is how we know it was
[59:24] necessary. He says, "For this thing," 2
[59:25] Corinthians 12:8, "For this thing I
[59:27] besought the Lord three times that it
[59:30] might depart from me." You know, this is
[59:33] human, this is human nature.
[59:35] It doesn't come to us and we're like,
[59:37] "Oh, welcome, buddy, brother Thorne."
[59:40] You know, just kind of side up to me
[59:43] here,
[59:44] right?
[59:46] It there there's this offense. It hurts.
[59:49] He asks God to get it get it away from I
[59:51] did this three times.
[59:53] I sought the Lord, this thorn, this
[59:55] pain, this messenger of Satan, this evil
[59:57] that visited me. And he said unto me, my
[1:00:00] grace is sufficient for thee. For my
[1:00:03] strength is made perfect in weakness.
[1:00:07] Most gladly, therefore, will I rather
[1:00:09] glory in my infirmities, that the power
[1:00:10] of Christ may rest upon me. This is why
[1:00:13] Paul could say that that heaven is worth
[1:00:15] the hurting. What's waiting for us, the
[1:00:18] glory that's coming, it's worth the pain
[1:00:19] you're suffering. If we try to exempt,
[1:00:22] listen, if you try and you want and you
[1:00:24] beg and you plead to be exempt
[1:00:25] completely from it, you're only robbing
[1:00:27] yourselves of levels of glory.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; You're asking for a temporary reprieve
[1:00:32] from something now in the hopes that
[1:00:34] it'll feel better now. But listen, all
[1:00:36] that God will allow to happen to you. I
[1:00:38] know it's as if it's empty when you're
[1:00:40] really going through it. And I say this
[1:00:42] with everything that's in me. As much as
[1:00:44] you hear about the glory and the power
[1:00:45] and the wisdom of Christ and the bride
[1:00:47] is overcoming and every devil's under
[1:00:49] our feet and there the bride is rising
[1:00:51] up and she's a marching army and she's
[1:00:53] undefeated and yet you feel the pains of
[1:00:55] loss and defeat on a daily basis. Don't
[1:00:58] ask for God to take away the trial.
[1:01:00] Don't ask him to take away the trauma
[1:01:02] and the injury, but God build my faith
[1:01:04] through it
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; because it's worth it.
[1:01:10] My grace is sufficient for thee. My
[1:01:13] strength is made perfect in weakness.
[1:01:15] It'll come to finishing. Most gladly,
[1:01:17] this is now. Paul says,"Most gladly,
[1:01:19] therefore, I rather glory in my
[1:01:20] infirmities that the power of Christ may
[1:01:23] rest upon me." How could he say that?
[1:01:26] The one necessitated the other. It was
[1:01:29] power by weakness, life by death,
[1:01:33] abundance through suffering,
[1:01:36] possessing through lacking. Therefore, I
[1:01:38] take pleasure in infirmities. in the
[1:01:40] reproaches, in necessities, and
[1:01:41] persecutions, and distresses for
[1:01:43] Christ's sake. For when I am weak, then
[1:01:46] am I strong.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; Listen for ourselves. How can we escape
[1:01:51] this force of evil?
[1:01:54] It's a weight. It's a pressure. It's in
[1:01:56] the atmosphere.
[1:01:58] How can I bear these wounds? How can I
[1:02:00] suffer this nakedness? How can I feel
[1:02:02] this emptiness?
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; How can I handle the hurting?
[1:02:08] How how am I how am I going to navigate
[1:02:10] loss? How do I navigate death? How how
[1:02:13] do I navigate divorce? How do I navigate
[1:02:16] baroness? How do I navigate rejection?
[1:02:19] How how do I navigate all these things
[1:02:23] that make me feel vexed, anxious,
[1:02:27] hurting, rejected,
[1:02:30] all these reproaches and necessities and
[1:02:32] distresses.
[1:02:36] I saw it put one time that every sin
[1:02:40] is an attempt to avoid emptiness.
[1:02:44] Every sin is an attempt to avoid feeling
[1:02:46] vulnerable.
[1:02:48] Every sin is an attempt to try to
[1:02:50] satisfy some ego, some pride of eye.
[1:02:55] But in love, this I'm just coming to my
[1:02:58] final emphasis here. In love, we must
[1:03:00] consent to this suffering.
[1:03:03] As brother Brandham is teaching, in
[1:03:05] perfect strength by perfect weakness, we
[1:03:06] must consent to cease to be anything.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; So that God may become everything to us.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; There must be this unconditional
[1:03:16] surrender to be nothing in our flesh.
[1:03:19] It's a mastering the thought of human
[1:03:21] ability.
[1:03:23] It's getting ourselves out of the way.
[1:03:27] I'll come to that statement here in a
[1:03:29] moment, brother John.
[1:03:31] Without
[1:03:34] brother Bam says that Christ began in
[1:03:36] this humility
[1:03:39] without this utter humility all our
[1:03:41] works all our acts all our strengths
[1:03:42] these are things that brother Bram's
[1:03:43] teaching us are subject to the law of
[1:03:45] sin and death
[1:03:47] he says we have to master the thought of
[1:03:49] human ability well why would I need to
[1:03:52] do that
[1:03:54] we can offer nothing short of ourselves
[1:04:02] But it has to be we have to come empty
[1:04:11] and to die I'll say it this way to die
[1:04:13] to ourselves
[1:04:15] to master the thought of human ability
[1:04:18] to be exposed uh uh naked and
[1:04:21] defenseless
[1:04:23] we must be willing to endure life's
[1:04:26] wounds.
[1:04:28] We have to be willing to face the fangs
[1:04:31] of life's bites.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; We have to be willing to endure the
[1:04:35] pains of life, exposed, defenseless,
[1:04:39] ready to endure all the wounds of life.
[1:04:43] You have to be willing to accept, as
[1:04:45] Paul says, necessities, reproaches,
[1:04:46] persecutions, distresses. We must accept
[1:04:49] all those things in Romans 8, the
[1:04:50] emptiness, the ine inequalities, the the
[1:04:53] unequal balances.
[1:04:55] We must not be bent on revenge or
[1:04:58] recompense. We shouldn't be living for
[1:05:00] compensation. We must be willing to
[1:05:02] suffer it. And brother says, "Above all,
[1:05:04] we must master the thought of human
[1:05:05] ability."
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; Listen, in your brokenness, in your
[1:05:09] weakness, in your vulnerability, in your
[1:05:10] emptiness, he says, "By by strength is
[1:05:13] made perfect in weakness." I hope I can
[1:05:15] convey this in my in in summarizing
[1:05:17] this. How life by death,
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; right? We look around and we see the
[1:05:21] evil. Let's if you could just I just
[1:05:24] say, "God, help me now to be able to
[1:05:25] deliver this because it's it'll be
[1:05:27] liberating for someone.
[1:05:29] It
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; it'll get the foot of the devil off your
[1:05:31] back, off your neck.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; Give me the courage to stand up in the
[1:05:35] face of great oppression, in the face of
[1:05:37] great loss. It'll give you courage to
[1:05:39] know that the very reason why this age
[1:05:41] is as nasty and as dark and as evil as
[1:05:44] it is, is because there's got to be the
[1:05:46] greatest light that's ever shined
[1:05:48] before. Amen.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; It's the law of the negative and the
[1:05:50] positive. It's the very light the
[1:05:52] contrast.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; And it's the very evil that's going to
[1:05:55] bring out the greatest good in you.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; And when we're empty, when we're
[1:06:00] vulnerable, when we're weak, we got to
[1:06:01] master the thought of humility. And as
[1:06:03] we empty out, it's your human nature
[1:06:04] that wants to fill that back in.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; You don't want to feel empty.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; You don't want to feel lost. You want to
[1:06:09] feel rejected.
[1:06:11] And when you have to master the thought
[1:06:12] of human ability, if God if God values
[1:06:16] brokenness,
[1:06:18] if it's through weakness he's made
[1:06:19] strong, then there has to be that
[1:06:20] nakedness.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; But we try to clothe ourselves with fig
[1:06:24] leaves,
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; he can't cover us.
[1:06:26] When we're emptied out, when our
[1:06:27] weakness, when we yield to that
[1:06:29] weakness, when we accept when we're the
[1:06:30] the buffets of life, and we we accept
[1:06:33] all these things that we have to endure,
[1:06:35] and we've mastered the thought of human
[1:06:37] ability to cover, to fill,
[1:06:40] then his strength is made perfect.
[1:06:43] But it's your human ability that
[1:06:45] perpetually fills the cracks in your
[1:06:48] life,
[1:06:50] the voids, the emptiness,
[1:06:54] and all those fissures in your life
[1:06:56] through which God's grace wants to flow.
[1:07:00] Because he says, "My grace is
[1:07:03] sufficient."
[1:07:05] But the only way that grace can get to
[1:07:07] you is if you let that part be
[1:07:10] vulnerable.
[1:07:13] The only the only way grace can fill up
[1:07:14] is when you acknowledge you're empty.
[1:07:17] The only way it can heal is when you
[1:07:18] know you're broken.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; And we master the thought of human
[1:07:22] ability. Why? Because human ability is
[1:07:23] so good at uh spiritual ninjutsu,
[1:07:26] right? You'll never let it get in. You
[1:07:29] never make yourself vulnerable. It's one
[1:07:31] of those things where even when we're
[1:07:33] faced in certain situations, we want to
[1:07:35] appear to be in control. We want to have
[1:07:37] everything uh just right and and impress
[1:07:39] and do all sorts of posturing. But when
[1:07:41] you're just willing to be laid bare,
[1:07:43] it's then that grace can make you stand.
[1:07:47] He says that's it's then that grace
[1:07:50] makes you stand.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says, "Get weak, get
[1:07:58] empty." This is that statement, Brother
[1:08:00] John, Brother Micah, you, Brother
[1:08:01] Elliot, you guys can come to the
[1:08:02] instruments. Get weak, get empty. Notice
[1:08:06] how many times he says that. Especially
[1:08:07] the one where he says, "Uh, you
[1:08:10] recognize that you're human.
[1:08:14] Get weak, find out you're human." Why
[1:08:16] would he say that to us?
[1:08:20] Why Why would he ask us to find out
[1:08:21] we're human? Isn't that obvious that
[1:08:24] we're human? But there's something about
[1:08:26] being human that we could even turn
[1:08:28] around, well, I I'm this and I'm that
[1:08:30] and I've got these qualities. I got this
[1:08:31] redemptive ability.
[1:08:33] Find out you're human. Get weak. Get
[1:08:34] empty. Empty all up. And from then on,
[1:08:37] it'll keep dropping
[1:08:40] and God will do the rest of the
[1:08:41] dropping. You just do that. I I say this
[1:08:44] to you tonight. I I read these words to
[1:08:46] you as from the prophet to our moment
[1:08:48] right now. You just drop to your knees
[1:08:49] and receive that with all your heart.
[1:08:51] Drop in your heart right now and say,
[1:08:52] "God, I believe it with all my heart."
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; God will take care of the rest of the
[1:08:57] drops.
[1:08:59] He said, "It'll be filled up. You shall
[1:09:02] be refilled." refilled with the Holy
[1:09:05] Ghost.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Why has grace only flowed so far in our
[1:09:09] lives? Because we we damned up the
[1:09:12] cracks
[1:09:13] through which grace wants to flow.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; We we we've we've built up the bull
[1:09:18] works of our brokenness through which
[1:09:20] grace wanted to seep through.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; We postured and we pretensed. We've
[1:09:24] prided and we populared ourselves all to
[1:09:27] this this way of I want to appear good.
[1:09:29] But Paul says, "Does it matter if you
[1:09:31] appear as a reprobate? Does it matter if
[1:09:33] you appear broken? Does it matter if you
[1:09:34] appear wasted and distressed?
[1:09:37] If God's grace can flow to you in that
[1:09:39] moment and through whatever it is that
[1:09:41] you're enduring, whatever it is you're
[1:09:43] going through, the very means by which
[1:09:44] God impressed upon me as I was there in
[1:09:46] Michigan to speak on these very things
[1:09:48] was the reality that if it may may not
[1:09:50] be all of us, but maybe one of us and
[1:09:52] one person is worth every effort in the
[1:09:54] ministry of the word of God that in the
[1:09:56] the the darkness and the evil and the
[1:09:58] hurt and the loss that we experience
[1:10:01] that in that brokenness and
[1:10:03] vulnerability and emptiness, if you'll
[1:10:04] just yield to him,
[1:10:08] and just empty yourself out.
[1:10:11] Own up. I'm nothing, Lord. I can't get
[1:10:14] myself out of this. I'm broken.
[1:10:16] Recognize where you get things wrong.
[1:10:19] It's the grace of God when he punishes
[1:10:21] us for our disobedience.
[1:10:23] God will take care of the rest. It'll be
[1:10:25] filled up. But when we fill it up
[1:10:28] through our own ability, that's the
[1:10:30] that's the worship of I. All right.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; If we're if we don't offer out of that
[1:10:36] brokenness, that unconditional
[1:10:37] surrender,
[1:10:39] that mastering, that conquering self,
[1:10:41] that dying daily, then whatever we offer
[1:10:44] is just a it it it's a label that we
[1:10:47] attached to me.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; It's a label I've attached to I.
[1:10:53] But the only way that you can have life
[1:10:54] is by death. And that's what it means to
[1:10:57] die daily.
[1:10:59] So therefore, we can as children of God
[1:11:01] embrace our brokenness because God loves
[1:11:03] it. Contrite spirit he'll not despise.
[1:11:06] With all the preaching of perfection and
[1:11:08] all the ambitions that we have to be
[1:11:10] without sin, all the ambitions we have
[1:11:12] to defeat death and triumph over death,
[1:11:14] your way to that is going to be through
[1:11:16] perpetual death.
[1:11:18] And not through a perpetual filling up
[1:11:20] of the void by your own means, but to be
[1:11:23] completely emptied out. to experience so
[1:11:26] much debaseness and depravity and
[1:11:29] emptying out to where it's in that void
[1:11:32] that you come to know God as he truly
[1:11:35] is. Not through religion, but as he
[1:11:37] truly is. It's life by death. If we
[1:11:39] could stand together,
[1:11:42] what are you playing for my
[1:11:50] Let's pray. Our gracious heavenly
[1:11:52] father,
[1:11:54] Lord, tonight as we close this service
[1:11:56] in prayer and we bring to an end this
[1:12:00] service
[1:12:01] through its
[1:12:04] breadth, Lord, and
[1:12:06] maybe it was a lot,
[1:12:10] but I pray that you would encourage us
[1:12:12] as brother Bram emphasized in that
[1:12:13] sermon. Let this be an encouragement to
[1:12:15] us.
[1:12:17] And I know these are things that are
[1:12:19] maybe uh it's not uncommon to hear
[1:12:23] preach.
[1:12:26] We've heard it through the years many
[1:12:28] times, but I I believe it just bore
[1:12:29] repeating tonight, Lord.
[1:12:31] [Music]
[1:12:33] That the way up is down.
[1:12:36] And then when it feels as if we're being
[1:12:37] beaten, torn, purged,
[1:12:41] dug up, and dunged, may we not forget
[1:12:44] that that this is your way of bringing
[1:12:48] life.
[1:12:50] Lord, I want to face these trials of
[1:12:52] life bravely.
[1:12:54] When things aren't going well, I I want
[1:12:56] to be able to say, "It's well with my
[1:12:58] soul."
[1:13:00] When when relationships go sideways,
[1:13:02] when pressure gets turned up, I I want
[1:13:04] to I don't want to panic,
[1:13:08] I want to say, Lord, I I know you'll see
[1:13:10] me through to the end.
[1:13:13] I know I'll be cast I may be cast down,
[1:13:14] but not forsaken.
[1:13:17] I know I may endure a lot, but I know I
[1:13:19] have this excellency in earth and
[1:13:21] vessels that this glory, this treasure
[1:13:23] is heavenly
[1:13:25] and nothing can take it away.
[1:13:28] Lord, may we realize that it's our
[1:13:31] trying to use human weakness
[1:13:35] in ourselves or
[1:13:41] ignore the brokenness and the
[1:13:42] vulnerabilities,
[1:13:45] rationalize the pain
[1:13:49] through our numbness that we're unable
[1:13:51] to experience the grace that you so
[1:13:52] desire to be sufficient in our lives.
[1:13:56] So today, Lord, I acknowledge my
[1:13:58] weakness
[1:14:00] and I confess that your grace is enough.
[1:14:04] That where I could just yield in my
[1:14:06] brokenness and my Lord, I I accept to
[1:14:09] endure all of life's difficulties to be
[1:14:11] exposed naked to the trials of this life
[1:14:16] that your power may rest upon me that
[1:14:18] your grace may be sufficient.
[1:14:22] not as a martyr, not as one that would
[1:14:24] use it as an excuse to be vanquished and
[1:14:26] to be defeated, but as one who trusts
[1:14:28] you and believes that your power can
[1:14:30] rest upon me. Bless everyone that was
[1:14:33] here tonight who had need of these
[1:14:35] things. If we find ourselves in a place
[1:14:38] of great comfort, we're in a season of
[1:14:41] rest. Lord, may we store up these things
[1:14:43] for the moment when we need it.
[1:14:46] But Lord, maybe we be that voice there
[1:14:48] even in Acts four where the pe children,
[1:14:50] your children just cried out and said,
[1:14:52] "Lord, give us boldness to speak." Lord,
[1:14:53] in our time of rest, may we be
[1:14:55] instruments that you can use now, now
[1:14:58] that we've had our trauma, we've had the
[1:14:59] injury, we've rested it, our muscles are
[1:15:01] being repaired and restored, and we have
[1:15:03] these bigger faith muscles. May we use
[1:15:05] that as Paul did to strengthen others,
[1:15:10] to be a light and a witness, and a
[1:15:11] testament to those who are hurting, who
[1:15:13] need it.
[1:15:15] And we ask all this in the name of Lord
[1:15:16] Jesus Christ.
