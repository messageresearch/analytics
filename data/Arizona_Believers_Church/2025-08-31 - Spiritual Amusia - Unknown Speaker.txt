TRANSCRIPT
========================================
We'll be going through these verses, I believe, just verse by verse once we get started. I thought it would be good maybe to tee it up here at the outset. Matthew chapter 15 verses 10 to 20. And he called the multitude and said unto them, "Hear and understand, not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man, but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man." That's a such a comp complex statement. Then came his disciples and said unto him, "Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended after they heard this saying?" But he answered and said, "Every plant which my heavenly Father hath not planted shall be rooted up. Let them alone, they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch." Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable. And Jesus said, "Are you also without yet without understanding? Do not ye yet understand that whatsoever enterth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and it cast out, and is cast out into the drought. But those things which proceed out of the mouth come from the heart, and they defile the man. For out of the heart proceedth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, theft, false witness, blasphemies. These are the things which defile a man. But to eat with unwashing hands defileth not a man. Amen. You can be seated. There's a lot of weight in these scriptures, a lot of things to uh wrestle with and kind of grab a hold of. And I want to do it in with this title, spiritual amuseia. And when I've said this to a few people this morning, they all thought I was stuttering or had a list, but it's spiritual amusia. Uh I know what I'm talking about. Just stay with me. That's my title. But let's just jump right here. Matthew 15 10 I'll read verse 11 but we are going to work through hopefully to verse 20 says and he called the multitude and said unto them hear and understand we've been looking at this concept of hearing been looking at the theme of music and the subject I'm looking at this morning uh began at the very outset in looking at how God's Bible is song God's symphony it's music uh and it has a musical connotation or music can be used as a type of this great truth of God's word. And so it was in this hearing and understanding. Uh I was originally looking at how there's consonants in songs, things that are good, but then there's the dissonant chords that add to it and maybe they're the foroding, the melancholy, the sad parts, but yet they play together with the overall composition to create a masterpiece, something beautiful. And and so this is still kind of in that theme today. And it says, "Hear and understand." So, it's not just hearing, but there's something that you catch. Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man, but that which cometh out of the mouth. This defileth a man. What Jesus is referring to, and especially as we see in the later verses, you could see this is what he's hitting at. It means to make unclean or to render unholy or unhallowed or to make profane, common, just common. And it's Levitical, Levitically unclean under the law. under the Levitical law as you could read in many different places in Leviticus, some in numbers and other places, how that there was something that would be defiled. So there was a difference in meats and different forms of washing were to be observed. And this was legislated because it would say if you do this, you are unclean or defiled or a man that does this. And some of it stronger than others to where you realize, man, any man that would uh uh commit that type of perversion, that's polluted, that's unclean. But then others seem to be very common things such as the meats that you would eat and the different forms of washing. In the Old Testament, if something was defiled, it was to be profained, polluted, to be unclean or impure. And if we took it on its face when he says that which goes into the mouth doesn't defile a man. And this is in response to they accused him of, you know, eating with uh sinners and his disciples ate with unwashed hands. And so this was just such an offense to them given the clarity in the Old Testament on these things. And so not that I'm playing devil's advocate, but Christ appears to controvert the law that they're saying they they observe these things, very particular about it, wanted things to be observed a particular way. And so now Christ says something that seems to be in contradiction with what Moses delivered. But he starts all of it with saying, "Hear and understand." almost acknowledging at the outset that I'm about to say something that on its face you might just be willing want to reject outright as being contradictory but listen to me hear me out understand what I'm trying to say. So he prompts the hearer to go beyond the phrasing in order to catch the truth. So immediately after he has said this, no surprise, then the disciples, verse 12, then came his disciples and said to him, "Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended after they after they heard this saying? No kidding." Right? This went to the very heart of those who are maybe if there's some pretense when you knock away their false props, right? I can hide behind the fact that I wash my hands before I eat. I can hide behind the fact that I don't mix my cotton with my linens. As soon as you start knocking out these props, immediately they're stumbled. They're tripped up. They're irritated. Triggered. &gt;&gt; But why were they triggered? Not because of what they heard, but what they didn't understand. &gt;&gt; They weren't triggered so much by what they heard. Because he said, "Here," and they heard. And when they heard, they were they were upset and irritated. But what did they fail to do? They failed to understand. &gt;&gt; Very plainly, we could say the Messiah spoke truth. And just to use a phrase that we've been using, their hearts weren't tuned to understand what he was saying. &gt;&gt; Hear and understand. Not just, he wasn't just playing a melody and you could just choose to like it or not like it because they chose not to like it. But can you appreciate it? &gt;&gt; Can you understand it? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; In Mark chapter 7 in this in this reciting of the same thing, he said, "If if men have ears to hear, let them hear." So again, it's that ability to understand. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And really when you think about the Pharisees, as we've identified them quite often in scripture, they're identified as one thing most frequently as hypocrites. And no one is more susceptible to take offense than a hypocrite when questioned. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; No one is more susceptible than to really respond uh angrily as the one who's guilty. &gt;&gt; Did you lie? How dare you accuse me of lying? &gt;&gt; Right? It's kind of like the answer I think should have just been no. Why did I say something that misled you? And so the Pharisees are feel somewhat called out by this. Verse 13. But he answered and said, this is his response to Jesus. Did you know that you offended the Pharisees? Every plant which my heavenly father hath not planted shall be rooted up. So there's this reference to this predestinated planting. And that predestinated planting is going to be uh natured or elected, if I could say it that way, receptive to the water and light under the right kind of conditions that he gives his nurturing and his nature. They're they're going to be fruitful. So not every planting, and this is important because he said Israel was that vine that God planted. &gt;&gt; And so though Israel was planted as a noble vine, now they are a degenerate, strange vine as the scripture teaches us. And what their religion had become was not what God planted, not what God desired. Even though we could say he did envision this, he prophesied it. And I think it bears noting that we should be sensitive to offending, but we cannot fear uh we cannot for fear of offending neglect truth. &gt;&gt; I think we should be sensitive to offense and we should be woe unto them that brings offense. So we should be sensitive to offending but we cannot fear of offending and in doing so neglect truth. Truth must must be owned. &gt;&gt; Our our duty must be uh done. And then we could say if truth is owned and our duty done then if there is offense it's on their part. It's their fault. In the sermon why I'm against organized religion. I think that's one of the things that we miss the most about the message of the hour. It was a rebuke to organized religion. And sometimes what when we make the mistake of organizing around being against organized religion, we become another organized religion &gt;&gt; and we've missed the truth of Christ and all of it. So for a lot of people, their paradigm of the message has been organized religion is wrong. So let's organize a religion that's against organized religion. And then that's the only platform you have &gt;&gt; is you're against the status quo. You're against organization. You're against denomination. And really, you're just another organized religion. He says, "Lord, I'm sure of this." And he's praying, "My heart would break if this scripture wasn't read real to me." When you said, "All that the father has given me will come. My sheep hear my voice." I'm using this statement, too, just to show where the heart of a servant would be. And even Christ knew my sheep hear my voice that when I speak to the Pharisees and some of them are offended, I I'm not don't I can't be blamed if I spoke what I was supposed to speak and I'm not even going to be very necessarily critical of them. It's not up to me. The Lord, I guess the kingdom is truly as you said. I know it. It's like a unto a man that took a net and went to the lake and cast in the net and pulled every kind. There was no doubt scavenger fish. There were turtles, waters, spiders, serpents, everything that the gospel net caught. But finally, by and by, the crawfish backed into the water again. The turtle pulled away. The serpent hissed and took back to the mud hole like a dog to its vomit or a hog to its swallow. But there was real fish there, Lord. And I have this consolation of knowing that even before the net went over them, they were fish then. &gt;&gt; Preaching the gospel is not a magic trick. It's not that you could come to church long enough and do your part to where all of a sudden you're going to be changed into an elected seed of God. No, the election's there or it's not. &gt;&gt; And not only should that be a comfort to you, uh it should help you with understanding how God works. &gt;&gt; They were born predestinated fish. And so this gospel net catches out into the revivals. You know your own. The only thing I'm responsible, Father, as far as I know, is stay true to this word. That's what we must do. Duty must be owned. Truth must be owned. He says, "You are the one who decides which is which." And I know that no more than the turtle could come become a trout. So could a man or person that has deaf ears to the gospel ever understand the truth. For the father has foresaw this and you have promised that all that he give you would come. I know I'm reading it from the message of the hour but these are very clear scriptural principles that you that it's up to God. &gt;&gt; You know can the can the clay say to God in Romans it says can the clay say unto the potter why have you made me thus as if to say I I I should be my own and I should make my own decisions. There's something to the uh sovereignty of God. So he says,"Not every plant which is planted has my heavenly father planted." Because he's saying, "Every plant that he has not planted will be uprooted or perish." So he says in verse 14, "Let them alone. Do not be troubled or concerned with their being offended. Let them alone. They be blind leaders of the blind." Maybe so much for being politically correct. Uh uh and and being soft and sensitive in the moment. He says, "They be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch." Isn't that right, brother? Right. The blind lead the blind, they're all going to fall &gt;&gt; into the ditch. So, he's saying, "Do not be afraid of those upon whom my word has not been positively received." I know for as human beings, we we often want to we look for consensus and that's why we kind of check, you know, what's the number one fast food restaurant and we all find out it's Del Taco or something like so that's where I go to get my Mexican food now. What's number two? Okay, Chick-fil-A. That's where we're going to go to get our chicken sandwich. We want to we want to fit in and and numbers mean a lot to us and the crowd uh it does something that you know if a lot of people are doing sometimes that's what we need uh to pat ourselves on the back and feel like we belong. So anytime that there's people who are offended, the disciples are they have that human instinct like, "Oh no, this is an important group of people. These are powerful people." But he's saying, "Don't fear if my word isn't positively received. &gt;&gt; Don't don't desire their favor. &gt;&gt; Don't fear their displeasure. &gt;&gt; Don't court their acceptance. &gt;&gt; Do not labor to please those that do not please God." I &gt;&gt; think this is one of the biggest traps we can fall into as Christians is when we strive to please those that do not please God. &gt;&gt; You I don't think that we should be overly aggressive and offensive and we just go out and call sin out for what it is and we we're just brutish and we're now protesting in front of abortion clinics and we're doing this because I don't want to strive to please people who don't please God. No, he says he's saying let them alone. &gt;&gt; Amen. A and so it doesn't mean we have to change our sensibilities to cater to them say oh well I understand this and understand that &gt;&gt; we're not obligated here even he says to respond or have anything to do with them let them alone don't mind their anger really think about what he's saying I know let them alone seems like such a brief phrase but he's saying don't don't mind their resentment &gt;&gt; uh their reproaches and even their uh uh the reflections they have for he says they are blind &gt;&gt; and not physically blind or legally blind. As I as I get older, I'm realizing that there's there's a legal blindness. Uh that you don't have to be completely without sight to feel like you're losing your eyesight, but spiritually blind yet trying to spiritually lead. They be the blind leading the blind. Now what is by using the phrase blind he's using a sense that we all have or that we have it normally or that we ought to have one of those five senses to where there's sensory input and then there's this subsequent interpretation and what he's saying is in there something's deformed in there somewhere that there's either something if we use blindness there's either something wrong optically with the nerve or the cornea some light's not being filtered correctly it's not happening physically or there's something wrong mentally &gt;&gt; where the brain isn't able to translate the data into a clear image. They be blind leaders of the blind. He said if the blind lead the blind both shall fall into the ditch. So what would that evoke more? Sympathy, right? Instead of the it's sympathy because you realize they're blind. In &gt;&gt; verse 15, then answered Peter and said unto him, declare unto us this parable. When when you read it, you might think, well, he's wanting to know more about the blind leading the blind. And Jesus said, are ye also yet without understanding? So understanding is at the heart of it. &gt;&gt; When the Pharisees heard and were offended, it's because they lacked an understanding of what he said. Maybe they wanted to pigeon hole it as well. This is in direct contradiction to to what the mo Moses's law said instead of really taking a step back and thinking you know what he has a point there that really what he's saying really makes a lot of sense he says and Jesus said are you without understanding so this contradictions may be evident on its face so understanding was critical to know the truth of it &gt;&gt; so such that you don't try to paint the Messiah as being in contradiction to the very prophet Moses Moes who said he was coming wouldn't be a very good platform, right, to build is to say that I am he that Moses spoke of and Moses, by the way, gave the most ridiculous commandments and and was leading you astray. That wouldn't make a lot of sense. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; In Matthew 11:es 2-6, "And now when John had heard in prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples and said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another?" Jesus answered and said unto them, "Go and show John again those things which you do hear and see." Now, if you if you were to track this back, it's not just a matter of signs and wonders being performed, but what we look for is scripture being fulfilled. When Jesus says, "Go and show John again those things which you do see it here." He begins to quote very specifically a prophecy in Isaiah that said these things would happen and that would be the sign. &gt;&gt; So it it's it's not uh you know that we just take this and say all right this is the way that we can always do this and such and such. But uh uh in other words like now the blind have to be receiving their sight in those things. Don't try to make it more than what it is here. This is a very sign of God. This is what God does. So, I'm not trying to take that away, but more or less I want you to see that Jesus is pointing to scriptural prophecy here. The blind receive their sight and the lame walk. The lepers are cleansed. The deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them. This is what the Messiah was to do. This is the very signs of Christ. This is the power of God. He says, "Blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me." &gt;&gt; Why does he say that? because John was offended. &gt;&gt; Maybe there's another way that he thought this was supposed to be transpiring. Didn't like the way that it was happening. So he says, John saying, "Well, go ask if he's even the Messiah. Go ask if this is even what we thought it was." And he says, "Go show him what is being done." And I believe that it's scriptural because that's the scripture is what would have anchored John as a prophet back to the truth that yes, this is what the Messiah was to do. or it would hearken the prophet back to the word to realize, you know what? This is what God promised in Isaiah. This is the fulfillment of those things. Blessed is he who is not offended in me. So offenses are easy to come by, &gt;&gt; especially with the way that Christ chose to preach the gospel, chose to go about it. He went about it in such a way to where the the the ones who were steeped in Messiah prophecy, the ones who were steeped in the religion, it was their identity, it was their culture, it was their ethnicity, everything, the very ones that were the most would have been the most receptive to the Messiah were the most rehended by the Messiah. And just seems to me it would have been nice if we could have all just got along and and the Jews accepted him and then all the Muslims accepted him and then all of us accepted him and we were all just one big happy family because Jesus just did everything so perfectly and so plain that everybody's like, "Yeah, that has to be has to be the son of God." I mean, he's 2,000 years old, man. Look at this guy. Perfectly. Have you seen his skin? How come he doesn't get do a get ready with me video? I want to know what his routine is. He says, "Blessed is he who is not offended in me." Verse 17, then Matthew chapter 15, "Do ye yet un do not ye yet understand?" So this is uh him kind of following up on that. Are you without understanding? that whatsoever enterth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the drought. Does anybody need an interpretation of this? Anybody? I I I didn't I'm not using a demonstrative slide. Now, do you know what he's saying? The things you eat go through a process. Food enters in the belly is processed. The nutrients are absorbed and the waste is discarded. Jesus said this is what happens when you eat something. But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart and they defile the man. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, so it's not what you eat that defiles and makes someone impure, unholy, uh unacceptable, unclean, but it's those things that are proceeding from the heart that defile the man. For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies. These are the things which defile a man. But to eat with unwashing hands defileth not a man. Now, in his explanation of it, I think it's still difficult for the Pharisees to get over the fact that eating with clean hands uh uh is not what or unclean hand is what makes a man ceremony impure. But certainly they could look at this and say, you know what, that's true. It's the heart being corrupted that makes a man corrupt. &gt;&gt; It's the products of a heart that defile a man. Therefore, what I believe Jesus is emphasizing is that which enters the heart be a and pollutes the heart &gt;&gt; is the source of pollution. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I think the perfect example here is the Pharisees in this instance when they heard the word it didn't resonate in their heart. So the very thing that went into their heart by through their ear and went into their heart as it began to bounce around within their hearts what came out was offense. Right? &gt;&gt; They weren't even able to process it even to say, "Well, we'll just let that go. Don't understand it. We'll just let it go." They could not process what they heard in a bit in a meaningful way to gain the benefit of Christ's words, the nutrients, the strength. And this is where I want to introduce spiritual amuseia. They were unable to process God's voice, recognize the truth, or even recall the promises. Maybe so fixated on one thing or a certain paradigm that whenever something else is sounding that they they can't recognize it or process it. Has anyone here ever heard of amuseia? Not someone who's pronounced amnesia wrong, but amuseia. Anybody? But this God I you don't realize how much I appreciate you. I would have thought maybe some other doctors here could have had the same, you know, understanding. Nobody else. Amuseia. Come on. Anyone? This is awesome. Breaking new breaking new ground. That is my man right there. See, I'm getting some support here. You guys are going to have to help me out. Amuseia is a musical disorder presenting as a defect in processing pitch, musical recognition, and musical memory. It's a severe def desit deficit in saying desit. It's a defect in properly handling music. Just get deficit out of your vocabulary and you won't stumble over it. French horn. It's a severe deficit in properly handling music. Now, it presents in a lot of different ways. I know a lot of you right now are saying, "Ah, I knew it. That's what I have. That's what brother Aaron has." Or you might be thinking, "You're you're diagnosing right now." Very very few people have this. Very few people have this. When people have this, they can't tell when someone is talking going up. It doesn't sound like that or someone is going down. They wouldn't even recognize when pitch is going up or down. They find would find music unpleasant. Even refer to it as noise. And sometimes people with amusia will find music annoying. Someone with amuseia doesn't display sensitivity to dissonant chords in that melodic uh uh uh context. So they have a hard time handling dissonance. They can't appreciate consonants. And here the Pharisees, they could not hear. Or I could say, let me say it this way. They could hear just fine, but it made them uncomfortable. Jesus said, "Why is it you don't know my understand my speech?" And I was, they were just there's this tonedeafness to where when he's talking, it just was nothing changed. I saw a video that the Savannah School of Arts and Design did on it. Savannah College of Art and Design, SCADA, I think is what they call it. and and they did a video on it or someone who went to the college did one on and his buddy was going to show him a new speaker and he goes here I want to hear this new speaker it sounds awesome and and he starts playing it goes tone tone tone tone tone and then a lyric and he's like oh yeah you know and it's that's how music will sound nothing to it they couldn't handle didn't when they don't know his voice there's no speech that resonates with him. &gt;&gt; The Pharisees, they couldn't handle the dissonance even created by his words. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's not what it's not washing hands that's going to make you unclean. It's what's in your heart. No, they couldn't get over the they couldn't even see that the two were different in a way and that one is making a really good point and the other one kind of flies in the face of their traditional logic or knowledge. But yet, maybe if the Messiah these things being taught, maybe there's something to lean into, wrestle with and figure out. In Mark 8 14 to 21 says, "Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf. And he charged them, saying, Take heed. Beware of the leavenven of the Pharisees and the leavenven of Herod." And they reasoned among themselves, saying, "Is it because we have no bread?" To me, this is one of those comedic moments in the scripture that Jesus makes a reference about the leaven and the Pharisees and the leavenven of Herod. And just humanly they start thinking about the fact that they got into the ship with only one loaf. And he makes this very very poignant statement like, "Wow, that's that's beware of the leaven of the Pharisees." And maybe they're going, "Did the Pharisees bake this? Is this a Trojan loaf? Did Herod slip this into our bag?" And they're thinking about natural bread. And he goes, "Jesus says in verse 15, why reason you because you have no bread?" What? How is it that when I made a statement like that, you immediately just wanted to go to natural things, which is quite interesting considering the fact that those that followed Jesus for the miracles were really digging the bread and then when Jesus went into showing staying to the word and saying things that would make made them stumble, they really just wanted bread. And since they weren't getting the bread they wanted, they said one by one, they just walked away. &gt;&gt; And so this is even maybe an instinct in the heart of the disciples. And so as I say here, there was a a a sensory defect or a harden of heart. This is where I get this from. He says, "Why reason ye because you have no bread? Perceive you not, neither understand? Have your ye your heart yet been hardened? Having eyes see you not? Having ears, hear you not? And do you not remember?" Now, there's all sorts of things he just referred to. perception, understanding, ears to hear, eyes to see, remembrance or memory, a hardened heart. These are all conditions of the heart. When I break the five loaves among 5,000, how many baskets full of fragments took you up? They said unto him, 12. And when the seven among 4,000, how many baskets full of fragments took you up? And they said, seven. And he still has to ask the question, verse 21. And he said unto them, "How is it that you do not understand? Why would I be complaining about natural bread at this moment if I've been able to provide to this extent so far?" So, it's about understanding. Again, it's not just seeing miracles, seeing events and happenings. It's not just being able to record them and and dig into the logistics of it in terms of this is how many of this, this is, how many of that, but he said, "Hear and understand. Can you recognize not just my voice but that what is behind that voice maybe beyond what we might say are signs and understanding the voice of the sign where is in the understanding. So he talked about seeing and hearing and understanding and even remembering and now he says is there even a maybe a hardening of the heart. Do you have the heart in the ability to receive what I'm saying? Amen. &gt;&gt; Ezekiel 12:2, "Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house which have eyes to see and see not. They have ears to hear and hear not." We're not just talking about physical ability where there's eyes in the socket but something severed where they can't process it in their brains. Talking about a spiritual eye and a spiritual heart. Ears to hear and hear not. For they are a rebellious house. No understanding. Jeremiah 5:21. Hear now this, oh foolish people. So rebellious and foolish and without understanding. It comes to this understanding, which have eyes and see not, which have ears and hear not, being foolish and rebellious. These are two of the strongest rebukes you could have in scripture. They lack the spiritual reasoning. In Psalms 115:6, they have ears, but they hear not. Noses have they, but they smell not. A twist. A COVID twist, so to speak. They had long co. It existed in Psalms 115. COVID 115. They have ears but they hear not. Noses have they but they smell not. What is a sensory input &gt;&gt; interpretation? &gt;&gt; Psalms 135:17. They have ears but they hear not. Neither is there any breath in their mouths. Now that escalated quickly because now he's saying they don't even have life. &gt;&gt; It's one thing to have a nose and not be able to smell. It's one thing to have have a lack of taste. It's one thing to uh to not be able to see or to hear. But now he's just saying, you know what? They're dead. For all intents and purposes, if someone cannot spiritually see, someone cannot spiritually hear, someone cannot spiritually taste, neither can someone spiritually smell, then they might as well be spiritually dead. &gt;&gt; Cuz what would you be if you lost all sensory input? &gt;&gt; You'd be living artificially. &gt;&gt; There's no breath in their mouths. Now, in amuseia, there's two different kinds of ammuzia. And I know you knew this. You're either born with it or you can acquire it later in life. In acquired amuseia, it's a musical disability that shares the same characteristics we'll come to in a moment. It has it's something that has happened rather than being inherited. It's the result of brain damage. which is the way they summarize it. And it's going to share the same characteristics of this other part, the congenital musia, which is by birth. The tonedeafness is another word we use. And I know we can maybe use that in harshly. And I think there's even a a phrase that's used uh socially now where someone is tonedeaf. Uh maybe they can't read the room or they're tonedeaf or somebody says something and it's it's not it kind of is not reading what's happening. This is a the to be congenal to be born congenital amusia is a musical disability that cannot be explained by prior injury, hearing loss, cognitive defects, or lack of environmental stimulation. So, they're diagnosed with amusia, they're born with it because you can't rule it out by injury or some impairment in hearing or cognitive defect or they're not it's not being they're not being stimulated in the environment. There's not another explanation. So, they say you can be born with it or it can happen by injury. I want us to think about this. I'm using this as a type. In other words, it's not like where is this unlocking? This truth hasn't been revealed to me. This is my liberty. No, this is just a type of the truth that have been preached to you for decades. Just using it to help us to understand better how uh uh understand the scripture better. So, you can be born with amuseia that inability to recognize to process and even recall music. Can't handle music. You can't don't recognize tones. You can't tell something's going up or down. music makes you uncomfortable or you find it annoying. Look at the spiritual type to this. In Psalms 58:es 3-5, the wicked are estranged from the womb. They go astray as soon as they are born, speaking lies. This is this is man born of a woman. Their poison is like the poison of a serpent. This this this these two scriptures here to me are there's a lot there. I've tried to just, you know, understand the full picture. Their poison is like the poison of a serpent. They are like the deaf adder that stopth her ear which will not hearken to the voice of the charmers charming never so wisely having they say about the deaf adder is there's no visible uh ear there's no ear ear canal there's nothing when you look at the deaf adder there's nothing say well this right here is their ear looking at scripture here in Psalm 58 that has no ear but even their senses are dulled whereas an adder without ears could still be charmed by sound &gt;&gt; could be. And that's where the the plane of the right and you get the sound and all a sudden the the snake starts dancing. And so there's a way that that would happen. But now they're saying this one that would typically respond to some stimulus, some sound, some wave that would catch its attention. You could charm it and they could demonstrate this charming by way of music. It says now it has no ability to be affected by that intentional sound. And what the psalmist is saying this is the condition of the unsaved. &gt;&gt; The unsaved are like deaf adders that no matter no matter and something charming never so wisely. God declaring himself never so wisely. The word preached never so clearly. Signs and wonders demonstrated never so plainly. And yet they're have their deaf adders to where they're not even responding to that. &gt;&gt; That's right. no stimulus &gt;&gt; because they says they've stopped their ear. &gt;&gt; And the the point I'm wanting to make to all of us who are here today for ourselves examining ourselves is we can be spiritually tonedeaf by birth. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Because we haven't received a new birth. &gt;&gt; So you're you're spiritually tonedeaf deaf by birth. And it's only by the new birth that this this greater sensitivity if you have faith and doubt that reside inside the person just by way of explanation and as long as there's doubt there uh uh you can be animated and moved by other things. But it's when that dove nature begins to live out from inside the soul that's when you have an ear really &gt;&gt; an ear to hear. &gt;&gt; So there I cannot emphasize enough the necessity of a birth. Yes, &gt;&gt; I I know that maybe for myself I may emphasize a lot of understanding and knowing and a and increasing in revelation and knowledge and wisdom, but don't pursue it outside of birth. &gt;&gt; If you don't understand something, don't try with everything that's in you to understand it. Come to the foot of the cross. Lay bare and naked before him. If you believe there's a savior, if you believe blood has been shed for you, lay yourself bare before Christ and say, "I'm a sinner. I'm worthless. I'm deceived. I know nothing. And lay yourself there and ask God to give you the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Don't beat yourself your head up against an ecclesiastical door trying to break in to understand things &gt;&gt; that you may not even need to understand. &gt;&gt; You just need to know Christ. &gt;&gt; So, oh, but brother, what about the message? What about this? Don't you need to know the message? Well, you better know Christ. That's right. &gt;&gt; You got to know Christ. Otherwise, what we call the message could be something you don't want to know. &gt;&gt; Right? There's a lot of uh uh paradigms of the message that you don't want to know. &gt;&gt; You'll run into somebody one day and you'll say, "Are you a believer?" And they'll say, "Yeah, I'm a believer. Oh my goodness, I can't believe it. I just knew by the way your dress is so awesome." You start talking like, "Whoa, hold on. Wait a minute. What? Huh? &gt;&gt; You mean the eighth messengers in Puerto Rico? You have a church of 8,000?" And all a sudden you realize the message means something completely different to them. Though they believe William Brandon was a prophet, it's a completely different paradigm. &gt;&gt; Better know Christ. &gt;&gt; That's not what you've gotten out of the message. Well, revisit it. &gt;&gt; So it could be a lack of a birth. So the wicked are born spiritually death, spiritual death. But we can also have spiritual amuseia through trauma, &gt;&gt; damage to our hearts and minds. &gt;&gt; You're living your life and things make sense and everything's wonderful and life's just moving on and you just feel like this there's just another plateau after plateau and there's no there's no uh it's not that there's not dissonance and it's not that there's things don't happen. You go up and down and all of a sudden something traumatic happens. There's some injury to your heart. There's some buffeting. There's something that happens and it damages your mind and now the you become by injury you have amuseia where what you once enjoyed you can't enjoy anymore. &gt;&gt; Once you once could hear and discern you can't discern it anymore. Everything's changed becomes dull or lifeless or annoying uncomfortable. In Luke 6:es 39-42, Jesus says he spake a parable unto them. You see the tie into what we've been reading. Can the blind lead the blind? Shall they not both fall into the ditch? And the answer is yes. The blind cannot lead the blind. &gt;&gt; The disciple is not above his master, but everyone that is perfect shall be as his master. So it applies to those who've made the blind their adviserss that they will also become as blind as their adviser. But then it also is if you make Christ your master then you will become as your master. And why beholdest thou the moat that is in thy brother's eye but perceivest not the beam that is in thy own? So now this has a this is about perception. You are seeing through a beam-filled eye and recognize that your brother has a sliver and you desire to remove it. Because he says, either how thou say to thy brother, brother, let me pull out the moat that is in thine eye when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thy own eye. there's some lack of nakedness, self-awareness, v, you know, realizing, oh, I've got my own issues and I our own problems. I know a lot of times the devil may want to use that to keep us from speaking truth, keep us from living the way that we ought to live as, well, I've got my own problems, so I don't really want to say anything. Well, if you've got your own problems, it's good enough to look at those and question whether or not you would be the hypocrite by turning around saying, "Brother, that little splinter you got in your eye, man, you really need to do something about it. Meanwhile, you've got this 2x4. I was like, "Well, I got that splinter because the way you just turned around a moment ago and bumped up against that saw blade and a little splinter came out and got in my eye." Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then thou shalt thou shalt see clearly to pull out the moat that is in thy brother's eye. You maybe are not seeing clearly. Maybe things aren't as they appear. You see your brother, he's in a fault. He's doing something wrong. He's doing something he shouldn't do. I I don't like the I don't like what they did. I don't like the way this looks. And there's a lot of uh working up on your part. And it's like, well, you know what? I've got maybe I have something impairing my vision. Maybe I have something in the way. This is actually a response to the Pharisees who maybe were looking at these splinters or what they saw as flaws in Jesus Christ and were really nitpicky about him not washing his hands. But he's saying maybe you should think about the own bones within your heart, your dead heart, your deadness, your real lack of sincerity and all the pretense you engage in that you probably deep down know you're doing it. But you use all these felactories and use all these broadenings and use all this religious pretense as a guise for what's really in your heart. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So he's saying why don't you examine the beam in your own eye first. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; And so here you could see that even in this way where one could be born as a snake is born without the physical ear. Let's say it's born without these ability to sound. It's a it's a congenital amuseia. there's an acquired amuseia where maybe something has lodged, there's been some injury, something has gotten in the way. And regardless of the cause, you say, "Well, does the person who gets the acquired amuseia, does that mean that they had it at one time?" Well, you may have been more sensitive at one time. You may have been more responsive. The seed in your heart may have been pulsating it a little bit more. That election might have been closer to you, more valuable to you. It might have been something that resonated with you and you liked the sound of it and you wanted to serve and you wanted to do these and it was there. It was pulsating. It was very very real. You couldn't deny it. But through the process of time that's dead now. &gt;&gt; And so what happened? &gt;&gt; It's the damage to the garden. &gt;&gt; It's the tears. It's the world. &gt;&gt; It really is honestly worldliness sewn into the spirit that eventually starts deadening the real spiritual gene. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Why? Because it starts choking out the hunger. starts choking out &gt;&gt; uh the desire. &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so even in that case, you say, "Well, you you need to be born again. You still need to be born again." And there's some even being born again, they suffer trauma and damage and they find themselves struggling and the word's not resonating. There's things that they have to go through. But regardless, if you have received or born with this amusia and you've just been uh and it's never resonated, you don't know it, you still need to know Christ by birth. Or if there's something that you've acquired along the way, &gt;&gt; there's healing for amusia. &gt;&gt; The Bible talks about ears and eyes and nose. &gt;&gt; These are all and even the breath and the mouth. Maybe there's a way that you could tie it to taste, but all reference domains of human cognitive ability, &gt;&gt; some cognition that processes sensory input &gt;&gt; physically. When you touch something and you say, "Is that as smooth or rough?" Because you have the ability not only to to feel it here, but then to know by processing input, hot, cold, rough, smooth, &gt;&gt; ears, eyes, sensory input. And as some of you might have thought, you might have thought that I was meaning to say amnesia, but in this way amuseia is a lot like amnesia. Amnesia can happen is many different ways we could look at this, but it's a loss of memory from trauma or shock, physical or emotional trauma, where one cannot remember certain things. They they they've lost their reasoning. they've lost their identity. It can be very very vast where they don't even know who they are. They have the inability to form new memories. There might be just very few memories that they hold on to. But this amnesia is damage to the the mind. And so amusia and amnesia. Now I think I'm in familiar territory, but maybe this way you'll be able to catch where I've been trying to work from this whole time. They're both a disruption in the brain's ability to process, store, or recall or retrieve information. Amen. &gt;&gt; Processing, storing, and retrieving. When you have amnesia, you you're not processing, storing, and retrieving. Somewhere in that, it's broken down. When you have amusia, you're not able to process the uh the the the information stored or retrieve it accurately. &gt;&gt; Amusia impairs perception, reproduction of musical pitch or melody. A song registers as a flat sequence or sounds without emotional or structural coherence. It means nothing. You hear, "Oh, solia." And you're just like, "Whose phone is going off? There's this droning in the background. It's annoying me. It's like fingernails on a chalkboard." Or maybe that didn't even bother him. I don't know. This is what it is. When you have amusia, then amnesia involves a loss or or the inability to form certain memories. A familiar face or even an event uh is devoid of personal context. you see someone's face, nothing doesn't trigger anything. There there's there's something that takes place where there's no meaning associated with what you're seeing. And each one of these the the cognitive or or the sensory and the cognitive system is still intact structurally. But yet those specialized neural pathways in your brain that are supposed to fire off and recognize a a and and begin to integrate these interpret integrate information, they're compromised. One time you could interpret this. Oh, that's the face of my dad. I could interpret that's the voice of my mom. There's things that could happen and things fired off. But then something gets compromised and what at one time was familiar now is disfamiliar. &gt;&gt; One thing that was pleasing at one time is now no longer pleasing. And so both conditions, I I want you to recognize this. Both conditions as we think you're you're reversed in what spiritual amnesia is. Both of these conditions are less about the absence of sensory input or information, but it's about the interpretation. &gt;&gt; It's not that new information is being presented. It's not that there's now uh things that you'd never heard or seen before, but now they don't hear the same. &gt;&gt; Now you don't see them the same. &gt;&gt; It's a breakdown of the mind and translating that input into a meaningful experience or something that makes sense. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And both if you have amuseia, you could be listening to something that others find rich with significance and sound and meaning and color. Even when it comes to amnesia, looking at something that to others it has a lot of context, a lot of meaning is very powerful. All the same cues, all the same evidence, but those cues fail to connect &gt;&gt; to these internal frameworks. Yeah, &gt;&gt; that make them resonate. &gt;&gt; Some people have experienced this with loved ones who begin to develop dementia. &gt;&gt; They they they can see just as good as they've ever seen. They can hear just as good as they've ever heard before. But the voice isn't familiar. The face isn't familiar. The signal is present, but somehow in the reception, the meaning is lost. the spiritual amnesia, spiritual amusia. It's either a birth defect or a heart injury. It's either something you've never had or something that's been impaired. In Isaiah chapter 42 16 to 20, "And I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not. I will lead them in paths that they have not known. and I will make darkness light before them and crooked things straight. These things will I do unto them and not forsake them. He's talking to you. If there was a people that was considered blind and reprobate and heathen, it was the the Israel or excuse me, it was the Gentiles to Israel. And then it says, they shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed that trust in graven images that say to the molten images, ye are our God. So there must be a change in paradigm. To the heathen, he cannot continue to worship a false god. and God lead him in the way that is true. So they that are turned back and go back to false uh these false images, they will uh they will not they will be greatly ashamed. So he says, "Hear ye deaf." Now that seems to be quite a a rough statement. If you're deaf, he's telling you to hear. Blind, look that you may see. Who is blind but my servant? Or deaf is my messenger that I sent. He's talking about Israel. This is about Israel, the Jews, the religious system. Who who is blind is he that is perfect and blind is the Lord's servant servant seeing many things but thou observest not opening the ears but he heareth not. There's your prophecy of a blind people without light of people without God being called in and the eyes of Israel being blinded for the Gentiles sake. &gt;&gt; The noble vine, the true vine. But notice he says they shall be turned back that trust engraven images that say to the multi- images ye are gods. What is this? It's the sin of imagination where they're perceiving life or truth and things that are false, not real. Therefore, it's imagined. The images, the molten images, the graven images, they're they're they're not gods. They've been fashioned by their own hands. But what do they tell themselves? They see it and they claim it is a god. It's a sin of imagination. &gt;&gt; But he says, "I will bring the blind by the way that they didn't know. I will lead them in paths they have not yet known before. I will make darkness light before them and crooked things straight. These things will I do unto them and not forsake them. God's promised healing &gt;&gt; for amnesia, &gt;&gt; amusia, &gt;&gt; sin, blindness, deafness, &gt;&gt; in Exodus 4:1, when Moses is choosing desiring not to speak, God says, the Lord said to him, "Who hath made man's mouth? Who h who maketh the dumb or deaf or the seen or the blind? Have not I the Lord? Who ultimately has responsibility over this? Who has power over blindness? Who has power over deafness? Who has power over the dumb? &gt;&gt; God does. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The ministry of Christ is healing of the heart to see and to hear. In Matthew chapter 13 14-16 and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which sayeth by hearing you shall hear and shall not understand and you shall see and shall not perceive for the people's heart is waxed gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes they have closed lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted and I should heal them. Where is it? It's necessary for conversion, for new life, to come to know Christ, there must be a hearing of the word. &gt;&gt; So those ears that are stopped, those eyes that are blind, those that have a heart that is waxed gross, and the eyes that are closed and ears that won't hear, they're the ones who cannot understand and be saved. And I could read that and I could say that's an unfair God that would do that. Because if hearing is the only way that I can have understanding and God's got to do that, &gt;&gt; then then it's really doesn't seem fair if I remain in my ignorance and in my blindness. &gt;&gt; I guess if I was in that position, I'd want to fall on the mercy of God. &gt;&gt; They say, "Lord, don't let me be blind. Don't let me be deaf." Amen. &gt;&gt; So then he says verse 16, "But blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear." &gt;&gt; Blessed are your eyes &gt;&gt; for they see and your ears for they hear. Who does that? That's God. &gt;&gt; If you can't hear, if you don't think you can hear, if you can't see, don't think you can see, who should you ask for for understanding? &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; In the sermon, hear his voice. Brother says, "So many things to dole the senses of the people today. Oh, but in the midst of all that, in spite of every doulling in every voice that's in the world today, some of them pleasure voices, some of them are sinful voices to lure the people. But in spite of every bit of that, the truth of God still remains. &gt;&gt; There are voices there in the world today at work, at school, on the job, in entertainment, music, all sorts of places. There's voices that are trying to damage your sensory input, trying to damage your processing of information. There's all sorts of voices that are trying to dull spiritual sense. &gt;&gt; Listen, spiritual amnesia is real. Spiritual amnesia is real. &gt;&gt; And you know the grace in spiritual amnesia, the grace in spiritual amnesia is just you've forgotten who you really are. &gt;&gt; It's not saying that you can never be who you never were. It's saying you've forgotten who you really are. That if you're acting disconcorted, if you're acting in a way that's not true, if you're acting in a way that's contrary to the word of God, it's not because you're serpent seed. It's not because you're a reprobate heathen that's not elect to a new birth. You've just forgotten the power of God's word to deliver you and raise you above all these base things that you can't seem to overcome. &gt;&gt; The truth of God still remains. He that will hear my voice and come after him. Men and women will hear the voice of God. God still waits to speak to every individual that'll open their ears to hear God's voice. So now we understand when that deaf adder stops her ear, they refuse to listen. But anyone that'll open their ears to hear God's voice, if you will seek me, he said with your whole heart, &gt;&gt; you'll find me. &gt;&gt; I believe that to be the truth. Yeah. &gt;&gt; For anyone, &gt;&gt; anyone. Brother Aaron, you really think someone in Islam and in Iran right now could truly seek the Lord with their whole heart and find him? Yes, I do because the Bible tells me that. &gt;&gt; I believe that. &gt;&gt; In Hebrews 12:es 1-2, we're just bringing this to our our close here. Wherefore, seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us. &gt;&gt; Let us lay aside. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Let them alone." Every weight, every sin, the sin of pride and pretense, the sin of sin of popularity, the sin of of money and women. There's a lot of things that draw on us. Got to recognize things. Just scripturally recognize these things. These things that war against the soul, the things that war against the spiritual conscience, the things that war against the spiritual mind to cause spiritual amusia, the things that are trying to deaden our senses to cause spiritual amnesia. Lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set for us, looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith. He must be the one that begins it. And therefore, we must be reliant upon him to finish it and perfect it. For who for the joy which was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God. &gt;&gt; Says looking away, looking unto Jesus means to look away from a one thing to another. &gt;&gt; Doesn't do us good enough just to take our eyes off of what's distracting us and take our eyes off of those things that are dark and those things we don't understand. We're just going to take our eyes off these things. Jesus wouldn't tell them, uh, look not upon them. Let them alone about the Pharisees and then just begin to let your eyes wonder because you'll find another Pharisee. That's right. &gt;&gt; But look unto me. &gt;&gt; Look unto Jesus &gt;&gt; and laying aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us. This is a call to guard your heart from all the inputs of the world that force us and push us. &gt;&gt; We must turn our attention away from the world to the word. Truly the source of any righteousness, the any any circumspectness, anything that we would have in our flesh, any testimony or any life, the source of that comes from this internal beholding Christ. Think we read it by Awtoer here recently how that as much as we could say all these things, the scripture, my goodness, the New Testament, most of it deals with things external. All of Jesus's parables, these things are all relating to things external, &gt;&gt; things natural. Paul's teaching every all this all these outward things. Even Paul Peter when he's addressing modesty he says it's he even speaks to a modesty not just a spirit but not in the the way that you dress a and calls out certain things. There's ways that there's it has to be with this internal beholding though first the purity of heart manifest in purity of life. Now this is the this is maybe the the little bit of the inversion here at the end. Then if we have spiritual amuseia to where Christ speaks and he says you know it's better you know really it's more of what's in your heart that's going to that it comes out of your heart that speaks as to whether or not a man is defiled such as murder and lying and blasphemy as opposed to whether or not he ate with unclean hands. If you hear that and you're tonedeaf to it, you're like, "Oh, that offends me." And the very word of God is offensive, makes you uncomfortable. If that can be so to the word, well, then you know what? I want it to be that way with the world. &gt;&gt; I want to be tonedeaf. &gt;&gt; Just follow me though. &gt;&gt; To the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To sin. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; To the flesh. Come on. &gt;&gt; To the world. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; I want that whenever I hear like, "Oh, I that doesn't sit well with me. I I don't know. I don't know if that's coming or going." &gt;&gt; Right? Because that's exactly how the world is, right? &gt;&gt; They look at you and say, "Man, I love you so much. Come give me a hug." Right? And it's like, "Oh, man. Can you scratch my back?" And they're like, "Yeah, I'd love to." Right? The world You can't trust the world. &gt;&gt; So, I'm not and I'm not talking about a lack of spiritual discernment, but a a a deafness. I'm so in I want to be in tune to righteousness. I want to be in tune to heaven. I want to be in tune to the word. I want to be in tune to Christ. I want that tuning to be the contrast to the world. &gt;&gt; I I don't want to start building categories and pick up a rock and go, "Oh, well, this one's the world." And pick up another rock and look at say, "Well, this one's of God." I I when we I go on hikes out there in Arizona and everywhere I'm looking like that's got to be a valuable rock. That's got to be a valuable rock. That's oh my goodness, this looks so amazing. See all the greens in that? See the pink in this? And everywhere I'm looking I go I live right next to a gold mine. I'm like how come people aren't in here just taking this and polishing them and storing them? I don't have any ability to know what's really valuable or not. And somebody who knows what's real, invaluable, can walk through a bunch of impostors and a bunch of shiny things and they're not saying that's fake, that's fake, that's fake. They just recognize something genuine. Say, "Come here. I want to show you something. Look at this. &gt;&gt; I want to be so in tune to the richness of the rock. I want to be so in tune to the richness of the blood. I want to be so in tune with the richness of Christ that I'm not in the habit of trying to call out everybody who's a Revelations 3:17. I want to hear the voice of Christ who's knocking at the door. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to be in tune to righteousness, heaven, the word, and Christ. Not just, oh, that's sin. That's the world. That's the flesh of the devil. Give me more of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So in tune to him that I become tonedeaf to the rest of the world. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; And the sermon, show us the father and it'll satisfy us. There's the heart's desire. Philip, show if I could just see the father, that'll that'll that'll be everything. Amen. &gt;&gt; You realize just how many perplexities life has? &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm asking you, do you realize, and some of you saying you don't even know the half of it, Brother Aaron, &gt;&gt; life is perplexing, paradoxical, &gt;&gt; and all the other P-words we can come up with. It's rough. &gt;&gt; The things that we have to endure and go through, it's it's it's a complex life is now even more complicated than it's ever been before. The only thing that's going to resolve that's Christ." &gt;&gt; Amen. Life's full of paradoxes. Some will be resolved to be false and some will be resolved to be true. But the only resolution you'll ever find is in Christ. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says, "Oh my, that's what we want to do." Rise above it. Pull away from them people that says there's no such a thing as divine healing. God doesn't keep his word. Jesus Christ is not the same yesterday, today, and forever. Just set your wings in the power of God and move away. &gt;&gt; Just that talking about that chatter of the chipmunk. Get out of sight. Leave them alone. Leave them set alone. Just be so deaf. You don't even hear them at all. &gt;&gt; That's a miracle. &gt;&gt; Could you imagine the miracle? Someone says, "Oh, did you did you hear the Pharisees? The Pharisees were offended." And like, "Oh, God did a miracle. I'm deaf. He made me deaf." I remember when Sister Elizabeth and I were we had been courting and then she broke up with me and uh I wrote her a letter just pining for her affection and she wrote back and said, "God did the greatest thing he's ever done for me ever. She got a new puppy." I'm like, "Okay, all right. Well, appreciate it." Another time I she said, "Oh, brother Aaron, one of this may be the first time this happened when she broke up with me." The first time she said, "God did the greatest thing for she's testifying. It was on a Wednesday night. I can tell you right where I was, where I was in my car driving. God just did the greatest thing for me. So wonderful. I just don't know how much I could thank him, but God took all my feelings for you away. What are the greatest miracles? It's in her miracle book. Number one, it just goes to prove, you know, sometimes you can lose your healing. You don't stay focused on Christ. Next thing you know, you're in love with him again. But this is the miracle of it. Sometimes that's the paradox. The very things that are, you know, it's like, you know, heartbreaking to the guy driving home from church that night, uh, is liberating to somebody else. But here's the miracle. Just be so deaf. You don't even hear them at all. Just move away from it. He says, "God is in his universe. God moves amongst his creatures. &gt;&gt; God is real. There's a true God. He's real. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. He's the God that wrote this Bible. You can believe it. &gt;&gt; This Bible is our absolute. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; You can't you can't follow the message &gt;&gt; and this Bible not be your absolute. &gt;&gt; You're cherrypicking at that point. &gt;&gt; So God is real. And so he says just become deaf to all the outside noise. Right? &gt;&gt; This deafness to the things of God, this inability to to to feel it, it can happen because we're not even giving ourselves a chance. &gt;&gt; You can avail yourself so much. We're talking about this in uh the sympathetic resonance and resonance to where if you're not tuned correctly, you can avail yourself to the elements, to the heat, to the moisture, to the humidity. You can be so uh wore down by the world that whenever the word starts sounding, it doesn't do anything to you. &gt;&gt; Why? Because you're not praying and reading your Bible. You're not listening to the message of the hour. So, it's going to sound foreign to you. &gt;&gt; You're not tuned to it. &gt;&gt; Amen. But I say this morning, I go through all this this morning because I believe in a God who is the same yesterday, today, and forever. And still heals of amnesia, still heals of amuseia, still heal heals those who can't hear, and can heal those who can't see. &gt;&gt; Praise God. In Mark chapter 9:2, when Jesus saw that that the people came running together, he rebuked the foul spirit, saying him, "Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I charge thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him." What is it? It's a spirit. &gt;&gt; Doctors can identify a part of the brain that's been injured. They can identify a certain hindrance to the tongue. They could see a certain damage to the ear and to the eye. There's a lot of things they can diagnose, but at the end of the day, the spirit of God is greater than that spirit that resides in the injury. &gt;&gt; And God, the word is greater than any dumb and deaf spirit. &gt;&gt; Spiritual amuseia. Do you understand what I'm referring to now? &gt;&gt; As we invite our musicians to come, I'd like to read this last statement from Perfect Faith. And so when a man lives by faith and walks by faith, Lord willing, on Wednesday night, I want to preach on like the key to escape in using that type of a key, a cleft, something uh that is the guiding guiding track. And so when a man lives by faith and walks by faith, there's your it's that substance faith. &gt;&gt; It's a key. He is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in Christ. Now you're getting into bride material. You're getting into rapturing condition. That means for each one of us, not just the pastor, deacons and trustees. That means for the leoty, every individual walks in a world with God alone. &gt;&gt; This is the opposite of DEI. This is DIIE. Right? We're we're not striving for striving for diversity, equity, and inclusion so that we can just be more of us. But this is dying to self. I need to die. &gt;&gt; So that I can walk with God. &gt;&gt; You are baptized in this kingdom. There's nobody in there but you and God. He gives the orders. You pack them out. Whatever he says, there's not a shadow of doubt nowhere. You walk right on. If the Lord says this, there's nobody in the world can talk you out of it. You go right on just the same. Now you're coming into perfect faith. &gt;&gt; Perfect perfection that cannot fail. That faith never fails. And speaking of Christ, he was a mystic to them with his perfect faith. And so it is now with those who have perfect faith are a mystic to others. May be offensive. May not be able to understand. You may see you may appear to be tonedeaf to them. We're taught to resist the devil and he will flee. To resist is to simply turn him down. just resist him. Just walk away from it. Now, I know that this is different. And I sure wish that resistance training was the same as resisting the devil cuz I it's not hard for me to walk away from weights at all. It's like I'm just I'm going to walk away from those dumbbells. You're just going to stay there and get dusty and somehow get the strength and overcome it. No. If you're going to get any benefit from those weights, you have to lift them. But here, the success of resisting the devil is not just how many times you can rep him. &gt;&gt; You know what's your personal best in hoisting Satan? No. Walk away. &gt;&gt; Just walk away. God said a certain thing. No matter what he's trying to tell you, you don't listen to him. Your ears are deaf to anything else but what the spirit says. &gt;&gt; To he that has an ear that listens, see what the spirit saith unto the churches. And the one thing that's got the list that the one that's got the listening post that catches what the spirit says to the churches. The listening post. The one that can receive what the spirit is saying. I think that there should be some tuning out to the things of this world. Tuning out to the base things. Now, I think that this works in perfect complement to what we've been ministering on. staring into the void, into the darkness and the difficult things. Because I'm not we're not talking about things that uh the darkness and the nakedness and saying, "Well, I'm just going to walk away." No. Uh-uh. We're talking about the world, sin, the flesh, the devil. There's a lot of things that look like darkness that that's the thing you're going to have to stare into to find God. But you're not going to find him in the world. You're &gt;&gt; not going to find them in the thoughts of this flesh. You're not going to find him in the devil. You're not going to find him as sin, but you'll find him as looking into your own void, your own weakness, your own heart, your own questions, your own vulnerabilities, your own nakedness &gt;&gt; at the foot of the cross. One of the ugliest scenes in the Bible. May God help us to walk with perfect faith.
