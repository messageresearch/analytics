[0:00] James chapter 4 verse 6 says, "But he
[0:04] giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith,
[0:07] God resisteth the proud, but giveth
[0:10] grace unto the humble." He giveth more
[0:14] grace. Wherefore he saith God resisteth
[0:17] the proud, but giveth grace unto the
[0:19] humble. Amen. You can be seated.
[0:24] I'm going to present my title today
[0:26] maybe a little bit differently. We could
[0:27] say grace over shame. Looking at the
[0:31] subject of grace and shame. And here we
[0:33] could put it as grace over shame. Maybe
[0:35] another way to put it is grace covers
[0:37] shame. So want to look at those two
[0:39] things together. We are for myself um
[0:42] and just in my studies and as this Lord
[0:44] has led me and as your prayers have
[0:46] directed that leading uh still looking
[0:48] at the concept of music and what stood
[0:50] out to me is how that in our lives we
[0:53] experience difficulties and troubles and
[0:55] these things being ordained of God and
[0:57] we can wrestle with it and try to figure
[0:59] it out and I saw a type in music how
[1:01] that in music those dissonant chords or
[1:04] those things that might seem to be off
[1:06] the bad or the forboding actually work
[1:09] together to create a beautiful symphony,
[1:12] a great orchestral arrangement that is
[1:14] engaging and very beautiful. And so
[1:16] we're still looking at the bad in our
[1:17] lives, the evil as we put it, and how
[1:20] that God uses that and how we have
[1:21] confidence that God will resolve it for
[1:23] good. And in looking at grace and shame,
[1:26] or this idea of grace over shame,
[1:29] there's a strong correlation between
[1:31] shame and humiliation. And we can see
[1:34] some overlap and some how those two
[1:36] things work together. So there's shame,
[1:38] there's humiliation. Uh but then there
[1:41] is a humility which is which comes in
[1:44] accepting both that we can be
[1:46] humiliated, we could be shamed, but then
[1:48] humility has something to do with shame
[1:51] and humiliation, but it's kind of this
[1:53] acceptance of it. And that's where I'd
[1:56] like to uh build from on this thought of
[1:58] grace and shame. On Wednesday night, we
[2:00] ministered life by death. I think it's a
[2:02] very uh common theme for us and we
[2:05] understand it in the scripture uh how
[2:08] that in order to have life something had
[2:09] to die and so there is this necessity of
[2:12] weakness drawing a lot from perfect
[2:14] strength by perfect weakness we saw that
[2:16] in order to be filled you have to have a
[2:18] need so a need equals feeling that if
[2:21] you're weak it equals strength and so if
[2:23] there's death there's life and we can
[2:25] see where that negative condition or
[2:27] that void creates an opportunity for God
[2:30] to come and fill that need. As he says,
[2:32] he'll be a father to the fatherless. And
[2:35] so there's a there's a comforter to the
[2:37] afflicted. And absent those conditions,
[2:40] this characteristic of God can't rush in
[2:43] and fill that void. And so we could call
[2:45] these things that we experience in life
[2:47] evils. But I'd like to also call them
[2:50] necessary evils. That's kind of the
[2:52] point that Paul even brings it through.
[2:54] Another way of looking at this is the
[2:56] way up is down. that in order to be
[2:58] exalted, in order to be glorified, there
[2:59] has to be a debasing, there has to be
[3:02] that humiliation. And so it's not just
[3:05] humiliation or defeat, uh that is the
[3:08] end, but it's this way up is down is
[3:11] recognizing the source, the source of
[3:14] our strength through that debasement or
[3:17] by that debasement. That when I'm weak,
[3:20] he's strong. That when I think I'm
[3:22] strong, I'm not relying on his weakness.
[3:23] When I think I've got it all figured
[3:24] out, I'm not looking to his wisdom. And
[3:27] so there's this access to the love of
[3:29] God when we fe when we recognize our own
[3:32] smallalness. And I'd like to use this
[3:36] phrase shame because or this term shame
[3:39] because in a lot of these things that
[3:40] we've mentioned over the last few weeks
[3:42] uh there is a shame that can be
[3:44] associated even with death that if
[3:46] someone suffers the loss of a loved one
[3:48] or they're facing death or some
[3:50] debilitating condition, there can be
[3:52] this great shame that's associated with
[3:54] it. And so shame is a great burden and a
[3:58] driving influence in a lot of people's
[4:00] lives. I'd probably just say all of our
[4:01] lives to some extent on some basis. Some
[4:03] of us daily experience shame or we feel
[4:06] shamed. Uh shame might be a buzzword in
[4:09] the the woke community, but there's a
[4:11] realness to it that I can feel shamed. I
[4:13] can feel uh made to belittled or I can
[4:16] feel this sense of because uh I don't
[4:20] want to be shamed for I don't want to be
[4:21] shamed. Then I'm going to try to do
[4:23] things. I'm going to be driven to avoid
[4:25] shame. And so it's a it's a driving
[4:27] factor and influence on many people's
[4:29] lives. In Romans chapter 8 35 and 36,
[4:33] this tremendous chapter, he is dealing
[4:36] with all these things that are not
[4:38] worthy to be compared to the glory that
[4:41] they're actually working in our lives.
[4:42] And he says, who shall separate us from
[4:44] the love of Christ? Nothing. Shall
[4:46] tribulation or distress or persecution
[4:49] or famine or nakedness or peril or
[4:51] sword? A lot of my studies were uh on
[4:53] the subject of nakedness leading me to
[4:55] through some of these themes. And so
[4:57] this scripture stands out. Tribulation,
[4:59] distress, persecution, famine,
[5:00] nakedness, perilous sword. Can these
[5:02] things do it? And he's not he's not
[5:05] referring to things uncommon. He's
[5:07] referring to common things. He said, "As
[5:09] it is written, for thy sake we are
[5:11] killed all the day long. We are counted
[5:13] as sheep for the slaughter." That may
[5:15] seem to be poetic. It may seem to be a
[5:18] kind of exaggerated language, but there
[5:21] is this dying daily as Paul talks about
[5:23] it. There is this suffering of the
[5:25] believer and it's phrased in this way.
[5:27] For the sake of the gospel, for the sake
[5:29] of Christ, we are we are killed. We are
[5:32] under the threat of death all the day
[5:34] long counted as sheep for the slaughter.
[5:37] And these things, tribulation and
[5:39] distress, all these things as it refers
[5:40] to them, uh they they cause shame.
[5:45] These are things that would cause us to
[5:46] feel some sense uh uh belittlement or
[5:49] loss or lacking. There's a lot of
[5:50] phrases I've been using in looking at
[5:52] this. Some of the things the Lord dealt
[5:54] with my heart that in these causes of
[5:56] shame could be death. It could be defor
[5:57] divorce. It could be infertility. It
[6:00] could be some uh uh uh poverty. It could
[6:02] be sickness. Uh it could be um some
[6:04] deformity or some h you know some
[6:07] physical condition that the c it's a
[6:09] cause of shame like that makes me
[6:11] embarrassed or I I I feel different. I
[6:14] feel ashamed. And all of these things, I
[6:17] would say, instinctively cause this
[6:20] sense of embarrassment or shame that
[6:22] there's a there's something threatening
[6:24] or unsettling or disgraceful about
[6:26] tribulation, distress, persecution,
[6:28] famine, nakedness, peril, or sword. We
[6:30] might read that and it may seem to be
[6:32] some antiquated language, but it's
[6:34] speaking of some of the words that could
[6:35] have been used as distress and anguish,
[6:37] to be rejected or driven away to
[6:39] poverty, uh the lacking something,
[6:42] danger, imminent threat or of death or
[6:46] violence. These are some of the things
[6:47] that we could say just distress
[6:50] and agony or anguish um rejection being
[6:52] an outcast or being dis uh disinvited or
[6:55] not included in something uh unfollowed
[6:58] blocked. These are things that um he's
[7:01] meaning by this or poverty just a lack
[7:03] of things where certain people may enjoy
[7:06] things. They get to go out of out of the
[7:08] state on family vacation or they drive
[7:10] new cars and we have this sense of well
[7:12] I I lack I don't have these same things.
[7:14] we can't do these same things and
[7:16] there's this sense of shame associated
[7:18] with it. It's very human instinct. Maybe
[7:21] you all don't agree but I'm saying for
[7:23] everyone else there's shame associated
[7:25] with these distressing conditions. But
[7:28] he says in verse 7 37 rather nay in all
[7:33] these things we are more than conquerors
[7:35] through him that loved us. Now notice
[7:37] how he places this. He's he's saying in
[7:40] all these things.
[7:42] If if we weren't in these things, if I I
[7:45] want to be very careful how I say this.
[7:48] If you weren't in those things, you
[7:50] couldn't be more than a conqueror
[7:51] through Christ.
[7:53] &gt;&gt; You catching this? Nay, in all these
[7:55] things, we are more than conquerors
[7:57] through him that loved us.
[8:01] It is in all of these things that we're
[8:04] transformed made into more
[8:08] &gt;&gt; than conquerors.
[8:10] &gt;&gt; Then it could be said absent those
[8:11] things we we might be conquerors. We we
[8:13] might be uh victorious. We might seem to
[8:16] be well or healthy. But it's actually in
[8:19] these things and because of these things
[8:22] that we see this transitioning into more
[8:25] than a conqueror. Not just uh uh not
[8:29] just a survivor, but somebody that
[8:30] stands more than a conqueror.
[8:34] &gt;&gt; In all these things, we're more than
[8:35] conquerors through him that loved us. So
[8:37] it's through this great love of Christ
[8:39] that we are able to be made into this.
[8:41] So it's not absent his love. So we must
[8:44] overcome this human instinct
[8:48] to use strength instead of God's grace
[8:51] to cover our weaknesses.
[8:54] &gt;&gt; We must overcome this thought that
[8:57] through my ability I can make up the
[8:59] difference.
[9:01] &gt;&gt; Mastering the thought of human ability
[9:03] say well I have this problem and I have
[9:05] this but I can compensate this way or I
[9:07] can cover it that way or I could train.
[9:09] I can exercise. I can take speech
[9:12] therapy or I could do this. And there's
[9:13] all these things that we might think
[9:14] that I can refine this weakness as Moses
[9:17] may say, well, I can't I can't really
[9:19] speak well, but I'll just I'll u become
[9:22] I'll take some speech therapy. I will
[9:24] actually go to school and I'll learn to
[9:25] become a great orator and then I can
[9:27] speak for God. And God's saying, well,
[9:28] let me just use it.
[9:30] &gt;&gt; Let me just use your weakness.
[9:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we must overcome this idea that
[9:36] we can use our human strength and rather
[9:39] we should use God's grace
[9:42] &gt;&gt; for that need. It says in 2 Corinthians
[9:44] 12:es 9 and 10 and he said unto me my
[9:47] grace is sufficient for thee
[9:49] &gt;&gt; for my strength is made perfect in
[9:51] weakness.
[9:53] &gt;&gt; We all know this. We have it memorized.
[9:56] My grace is enough.
[9:58] It is sufficient. It will supply
[10:01] in light of this necessary evil, in
[10:03] light of this thorn in the flesh, in
[10:04] light of this suffering, in light of the
[10:06] lacking or the disability, the distress,
[10:08] all these things, my grace is enough.
[10:11] &gt;&gt; So that's present. And he doesn't do
[10:14] away with it. But he says, "My grace is
[10:16] sufficient in it."
[10:18] And then Paul catching the revelation
[10:20] says, "Well, then I'll I'll glory in my
[10:22] infirmities.
[10:24] I I won't be shamed by them,
[10:26] &gt;&gt; but his grace is going to cover it such
[10:28] that the power of Christ now is going to
[10:30] rest upon me. Therefore, I take pleasure
[10:32] in infirmities, not in the infirmities
[10:34] themselves. I I I take pleasure in the
[10:37] reproaches, in necessities, in
[10:38] persecutions, in distresses for Christ's
[10:41] sake. Now, he's not saying that we just,
[10:43] oh my goodness, did you hear? I've got
[10:45] stage four coming up. This is going to
[10:48] be awesome.
[10:50] It's not that, but it's this recognizing
[10:52] that it's in this that God can make
[10:54] himself known.
[10:56] &gt;&gt; I I'm not going to let these things
[10:58] shame me. I'm not going to let the
[11:00] infirmities, reproaches, necessities,
[11:02] persecutions, distresses, or the
[11:04] tribulation, the famine, the nakedness,
[11:06] the peril, or sword. I'm not going to
[11:08] let those things tear me down. But
[11:10] rather, I'm going to recognize that when
[11:11] I am in those things, when I am weak, he
[11:14] says, then am I strong.
[11:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:17] &gt;&gt; Through what? His grace.
[11:20] is grace that somehow attaches itself to
[11:22] that distress
[11:25] &gt;&gt; and changes it to strength.
[11:28] &gt;&gt; Now shame is synonymous in the scripture
[11:31] with nakedness. There's some parts in
[11:33] the scripture where nakedness is used
[11:34] and the the the Hebrew word that is
[11:37] intend not intended but the Hebrew word
[11:39] that it's uh could have been translated
[11:41] to represent shame. And so there is this
[11:45] uh it's an analogous shame is synonymous
[11:47] with nakedness. But then there's also
[11:49] this connection. Uh so and both are
[11:52] connected with sin and death. So you
[11:53] have shame and nakedness. And I want you
[11:55] to see that parallel to sin and death.
[11:57] Shame in the Hebrew is disgrace,
[11:59] reproach, confusion or dishonor. It's
[12:03] something humiliating or insulting. We
[12:05] can see then it already connects to
[12:07] Romans 8 and 2 Corinthians 12. through
[12:09] this disgrace, this reproach, this
[12:11] insult, this humiliation.
[12:13] Now, I'd like to uh use our obligatory
[12:16] scriptures in Genesis chapter 2, our
[12:19] customary
[12:20] uh scriptures here in Genesis chapter 2,
[12:23] 25, speaking of the man and the woman at
[12:25] the end of the finality and totality of
[12:28] creation. It says they were both naked,
[12:30] the man and his wife, and were not
[12:32] ashamed. We visited this theme quite
[12:34] often. So these things are very
[12:36] familiar, but I'm I'm aiming at
[12:38] something and I I just believe that
[12:40] viewing what we already know next to
[12:42] what we're leading to is very helpful.
[12:45] So to be naked here, they're it it
[12:47] speaks to be bare physically. So they
[12:49] were physically there was a nakedness to
[12:51] them, but it also speaks and maybe more
[12:54] particularly it speaks to their minds
[12:56] and their spirits and their emotions as
[12:58] being pure and innocent. So this
[13:01] nakedness in Genesis chapter 2, it
[13:03] represents this innocence of birth where
[13:05] they're clean, they're new, they're
[13:07] springing forth um from innocence into
[13:10] innocence and there's no deformity.
[13:12] There's no lacking. This is to be naked
[13:16] and not ashamed, which is not
[13:19] disappointed. There's no confusion.
[13:20] There's no distress. There's no anxiety
[13:22] from lacking or neediness. Uh they
[13:26] didn't step forth to these fully mature,
[13:28] beautiful man and a woman immediately
[13:29] say, "What are we eating tonight? Go
[13:32] check the pantry. Go look in the
[13:33] fridge." There was no anxiety as to
[13:35] need. There was no concern as we are
[13:38] today. What shall we eat? How will we be
[13:39] clothed? Where are we going to sleep?
[13:41] There there was no nothing forboding or
[13:44] anxious. We could say that they were
[13:46] clothed with glory. Glory is the
[13:49] opposite of shame. and glory is that uh
[13:51] honor the the riches the splendor uh
[13:54] this uh they had this reverence uh for
[13:57] God this fear for God but even in them
[13:59] all creation feared them and revered
[14:01] them so there's some dignity and
[14:02] reputation they were clothed with glory
[14:05] riches abundance splendor honor
[14:09] and they are yet described as naked
[14:13] and not ashamed
[14:15] but there is this paradox of nakedness
[14:17] because nakedness not only represents
[14:19] innocence before sin where there was no
[14:22] cause for shame but it also represents
[14:24] death. In Job 1 21 it says naked came I
[14:28] out of my mother's womb and naked shall
[14:30] I return thither. He says the Lord
[14:33] giveth and the Lord taketh away. So
[14:35] death he says he's born naked. We say
[14:38] that innocent newborn baby. Uh we you
[14:42] can't it's I don't know if anybody wants
[14:44] to confess at this moment but you don't
[14:46] see a newborn and just instinctively
[14:47] hate it. Well, I mean, at least you
[14:48] shouldn't if you do.
[14:51] Speaking of evil, right, there's
[14:52] something about a baby that's innocent
[14:54] and and and they're they're helpless.
[14:57] There's this meekness, this humility.
[14:58] The Bible says, "Except you become as
[15:00] little children." So, there's something
[15:01] in it that even pleases the Lord, this
[15:03] helplessness. So, there's a nakedness at
[15:06] birth. This is kind of looking at
[15:08] Genesis chapter 2, this innocence. But
[15:11] then it says, "And then naked, you're
[15:12] going to return not to the womb, but to
[15:15] the earth from which you came. the dust
[15:18] from which you came. And when we die,
[15:20] death strips us of
[15:24] of everything, if I could just put it
[15:26] that way, of all things. Strips us of
[15:29] distress in this life. Famine,
[15:31] nakedness, peril, sore. But it also
[15:32] strips us of any clothing or any uh uh
[15:35] uh possessions because they do nothing
[15:38] for a dead body. Contrary to what the
[15:40] tombs teach us or what they do teach us
[15:43] is that you could leave all sorts of
[15:44] things in a tomb and a dead body is not
[15:46] going to be to able to enjoy riches.
[15:49] &gt;&gt; It's one of the vexations that Solomon
[15:50] had in in Ecclesiastes like man you
[15:52] could accumulate so much wealth have so
[15:54] much clothing have so many wives and all
[15:56] these things but then when you die they
[15:57] do nothing for you. So death strips us
[16:01] as Job 30:23 says for I know that thou
[16:03] wil bring me to death and it phrases
[16:06] this way very poetic and to the house
[16:08] appointed for all living.
[16:11] We come as it were from the earth we
[16:15] step forth from our mother's womb though
[16:17] conceived in iniquity and though there
[16:18] is sin that has shaped us there's this
[16:21] nakedness at birth that's associated
[16:23] with life. But then he says, "We're
[16:24] going to go right back to the dust
[16:26] again, to this house from which we came,
[16:30] which is death."
[16:33] Solomon observed this in Ecclesiastes
[16:34] chapter 5:1 15. As he came forth of his
[16:37] mother's womb, naked shall he return as
[16:40] he came. Shall take nothing of his labor
[16:43] which he may carry away in his hand.
[16:45] There's the nakedness. Nothing goes with
[16:47] you. The clothes, the possessions.
[16:52] Reminds me of the story one time where
[16:54] somebody had died and uh come to find
[16:57] out that some some people felt really
[16:59] bad because they owed him some money and
[17:01] and the they got to talking about it
[17:03] later on and how this person said they
[17:05] left him a $50 bill in there and another
[17:06] person said they left him a $100 bill
[17:08] and the third person said I left him a
[17:09] check
[17:11] in the in the coffin. And so that was
[17:14] somebody who uh I guess well played but
[17:17] there's none of the money and all those
[17:19] things going to do nothing for the dead
[17:20] body. It's for the remain that do those
[17:22] things and make those offerings because
[17:25] we come into the world innocent but then
[17:27] we die naked stripped. So the book ends
[17:30] of natural life are nakedness.
[17:33] From dust thou cometh to dust thou shalt
[17:35] return is what the scripture says. In
[17:38] this life then we're born naked. But
[17:41] then life is this process of adorning
[17:45] and covering.
[17:47] And in this life, if if we could look at
[17:49] it this way, in this life, you hide
[17:50] behind your flesh.
[17:53] In death is going to strip that veneer.
[17:57] &gt;&gt; When when the body dies, you're going to
[17:58] be laid bare and you're going to be
[18:01] exposed for the deeds that were done in
[18:03] the body. Now, we kind of hide behind
[18:06] this, but death then ushers us into the
[18:08] next stage. As it says in Hebrews 9:27,
[18:10] as it is appointed unto men once to die,
[18:12] but after this judgment, this house
[18:15] appointed to all living, we're going to
[18:16] have to stand there, not clothed, but
[18:19] exposed.
[18:22] &gt;&gt; And so, this nakedness at death is a
[18:24] pointing to and a reference to kind of a
[18:26] nod to this nakedness, this exposure to
[18:30] judgment.
[18:31] &gt;&gt; Yes. In this life, not only do we hide
[18:33] behind our flesh, but we can dress it.
[18:35] We could uh we can have the pretense,
[18:38] right? We can have the the politics or
[18:41] the polish and we can have those things
[18:44] that where we present ourselves as
[18:47] strong.
[18:48] We can dress as if we have we can appear
[18:52] good, but when you die, you're going to
[18:55] be tried as to whether or not you are
[18:57] good.
[18:59] &gt;&gt; What goodness is there? the wood, hay,
[19:02] stubble, and all those things will be
[19:03] burned up. What will remain? You'll be
[19:05] stripped naked, laid bare before
[19:06] judgment.
[19:09] In a few scriptures in the Old
[19:11] Testament, I think I'm just going to try
[19:12] to skip over these very quickly. In
[19:14] Isaiah chapter 47,
[19:16] it's speaking of Babylon and how that
[19:19] thou shalt no more be called tender and
[19:21] delicate, but it says, "Thy nakedness
[19:23] shall be uncovered and thy shame shall
[19:25] be seen." Jeremiah 13:26 it says that
[19:29] therefore while I discover thy skirts
[19:31] upon thy face and so there's this uh it
[19:34] says at Nahim and discover thy skirts
[19:35] upon thy face this is a public shaming
[19:38] that thy shame may appear I'll show the
[19:41] nations thy nakedness and thy kingdoms
[19:43] thy shame so he said I'm going to expose
[19:46] you to shame and contempt
[19:48] it's believed historically that uh
[19:50] public shaming and even this uh
[19:52] punishment for lwdness was this
[19:54] stripping and you could just see even in
[19:56] the describing putting the skirts over
[19:58] their head. This is a way of exposing
[20:00] bad behavior, lwdness or evil.
[20:04] &gt;&gt; And when he says, "I'll discover the
[20:05] skirts upon thy face and I'll show your
[20:07] nakedness and your shame." This
[20:08] nakedness implies even being exposed not
[20:11] just to the ridicule of the people, but
[20:13] God's wrath.
[20:14] &gt;&gt; Right?
[20:15] &gt;&gt; That in being naked, you're now subject
[20:17] to punishment. There is this
[20:18] defenselessness.
[20:20] There's no pleading. There's no appeal.
[20:22] &gt;&gt; You're naked. You have nothing to defend
[20:24] yourself with. And that's nakedness is a
[20:26] disarmament. There's no excuse.
[20:29] &gt;&gt; I can't hide behind anything.
[20:33] In Exodus 32:2,
[20:35] as Moses is coming down uh from the
[20:38] mountain with these tablets of stone, I
[20:40] had some scriptures in here uh been
[20:43] there's a connection between the wrong
[20:46] kind of music and nakedness
[20:49] and the wrong kind of worship and
[20:51] nakedness where people worship and their
[20:53] worship and their exuberance covers the
[20:55] fact that they are naked before God and
[20:58] exposed that it's a it's a bloodless
[21:00] worship. It's a false worship. And but
[21:02] yet they hide behind the tambourine.
[21:04] They hide behind the joy and the
[21:05] emotions and the outpouring and the
[21:07] flesh side. And when Joshua heard it, he
[21:10] said, "It sounds like war."
[21:12] &gt;&gt; And Moses knew, "No, that it's not war.
[21:16] Something though is wrong
[21:18] &gt;&gt; by the manner in which they worshiped."
[21:20] And it says, "When Moses saw that the
[21:22] people were naked
[21:24] for Aaron, Aaron, come on. For Aaron had
[21:27] made them naked unto their shame among
[21:29] their enemies.
[21:31] It's a lot that's meant in these
[21:32] phrases. Aaron had made them naked unto
[21:35] their shame among their enemies. They
[21:37] would have no doubt been defenseless in
[21:39] that moment.
[21:40] Not sober, not ready, not vigilant, not
[21:42] watching. So they had kind of laid down
[21:44] their discernment and their sensitivity
[21:47] to certain harms.
[21:49] And so there is a a sense of disarmament
[21:53] there and laying down their weapons. But
[21:55] there's this nakedness could have very
[21:58] well been literal nakedness
[22:01] that they in their celebration and their
[22:03] worship they may have uh tore off their
[22:06] clothes and they may begin to dance uh
[22:08] without their garments on anymore.
[22:12] In the Bible when Saleom danced before
[22:15] Herod
[22:16] in the in this telling of the dancing
[22:19] there's nothing that would imply lwdness
[22:21] or vulgarity but the artists who have
[22:23] taken taken that and read into the scene
[22:25] it's often depicted now that there was a
[22:28] lwdness to it there was a seduction
[22:31] intended in it through the wrong kind of
[22:34] worship the wrong kind of dance or
[22:36] praise or or just this release or this
[22:39] expression here this is very real false
[22:42] worship of a golden calf which wasn't
[22:44] brought to them out of Lucas the traitor
[22:48] of bringing out uh gold or whatever it
[22:50] might be and building the golden calf
[22:52] but it was something that was within
[22:55] their own movement that in the absence
[22:58] of the prophet he had be been gone long
[23:01] enough to where now they begin to
[23:02] pervert what he said
[23:05] &gt;&gt; to make their own worship that made them
[23:07] feel good. Wow.
[23:10] &gt;&gt; But in this nakedness, there was no
[23:12] awareness of their sin. I think this
[23:14] might be uh something that's very, very
[23:16] important to catch on to is in their
[23:19] nakedness. There was no awareness of
[23:22] their spiritual fornication.
[23:24] There's no guilt in the moment. They're
[23:26] not sitting there, you know, doing the
[23:28] Trump or whatever. Or maybe he does.
[23:30] Which one? I don't know how he does it.
[23:33] Uh but there's there's no in the moment
[23:35] they think this doesn't feel right.
[23:37] They're kind of like going, "Yeah, hey,
[23:39] hey, hey." And they all just start
[23:42] really enjoying it. They had laid aside
[23:44] their trust in God initially. What are
[23:46] we doing out here? We need a God. We
[23:48] need a God with skin. We need to see
[23:49] something. And then they laid aside
[23:52] their trust and their faith through this
[23:55] worship of a false god. And now they're
[23:57] dancing around naked. And this he saw
[23:59] that they were naked. Naked it means
[24:01] uncovered or exposed. It implies
[24:04] immodesty.
[24:05] It implies disorder. It's this pagan
[24:08] revery.
[24:10] Moses recognized in that moment. He saw
[24:12] that their manner of worship was
[24:14] disgraceful. He's saying, "This isn't
[24:15] the way we worship Yahweh.
[24:18] This isn't how God has commanded to be
[24:19] worshiped.
[24:22] There was this religious chaos."
[24:25] And the prophet looked at it and
[24:26] immediately knew something's wrong. This
[24:28] isn't right.
[24:30] Yet, the people did not recognize their
[24:32] shame. But the prophet called it out as
[24:35] nakedness.
[24:37] So nakedness is associated with sin,
[24:40] death, judgment.
[24:43] In the beginning, the man and the woman
[24:45] were naked and not ashamed. But in
[24:47] Genesis chapter 3, again, these are
[24:48] obligatory scriptures. Verse 10, after
[24:51] the fall, after he has ran and hid from
[24:54] God, he says, "And I heard thy voice in
[24:56] the garden, and I was afraid because I
[25:00] was naked, and I hid myself."
[25:05] Notice these phrasings that he uses
[25:07] here. I was afraid
[25:10] because I was naked.
[25:12] Nakedness causes us fear. And then this
[25:15] shame, being shamed, he hides himself.
[25:20] Now he goes from being naked and not
[25:22] ashamed to naked and ashamed. Very
[25:25] interesting that he was already naked.
[25:29] &gt;&gt; So it's not just the nakedness. There's
[25:31] something else that's happening. This
[25:32] nakedness represents guilt, shame. It
[25:36] evokes fear.
[25:39] It's just paralyzing vulnerability. Now
[25:40] we can begin to relate to Adam in
[25:42] Genesis 2:25. There's no relating to
[25:44] him. But this nakedness and shame
[25:47] represents this being stripped of
[25:49] innocence.
[25:51] Now before naked and not ashamed, now
[25:54] that they're naked and afraid and hiding
[25:55] themselves, their consciousness of
[25:57] guilt. They're conscious of guilt.
[26:01] This nakedness signifies a spiritual
[26:03] death.
[26:07] Not only a spiritual death because we
[26:08] know death enters that very moment, but
[26:09] also a fear of future death.
[26:13] And it's under this influence because
[26:15] when you read it, you're recognizing
[26:16] that there's there's time that passes.
[26:18] The woman lust and as she lust, she she
[26:22] comes, she brings to her husband. They
[26:24] all act. But in those moments
[26:27] under the influence of lust, they're not
[26:29] initially conscious of losing their
[26:31] covering.
[26:33] The woman initially isn't like, "Oh,
[26:35] no." There's this power over them.
[26:41] It's afterwards they become conscious
[26:44] that the veil of God's glory has been
[26:46] laid aside.
[26:48] Not in the moment. They don't catch
[26:50] themselves in the moment. It's
[26:51] afterwards he realizes I I'm naked and
[26:54] there's shame. So shame enters with sin.
[26:59] When shame enters into the human
[27:01] experience because of shem, because of
[27:04] sin and shm, Ham and Japheth, there's
[27:09] this changing of the proper relationship
[27:11] between the spirit and the body. They
[27:12] were harmonized. They were one. No
[27:14] sickness in the body, no sickness in the
[27:16] spirit. But now this change between the
[27:18] body and the spirit means now there's
[27:20] fleshly lust which war against the soul.
[27:24] &gt;&gt; There's a complete changing. This
[27:26] nakedness is an emptiness. This
[27:28] nakedness is a lacking. It's a
[27:30] vulnerability. He's exposed. He's
[27:32] uncovered. He's without protection. He's
[27:34] naked and ashamed. But yet, it's not in
[27:37] the same sense now where he says, "I was
[27:38] afraid because I was naked." Notice in
[27:41] Genesis 3:7, "And their eyes of them
[27:43] both were opened and they knew that they
[27:45] were naked."
[27:47] They were naked before,
[27:49] &gt;&gt; but now this nakedness causes them to
[27:51] sew together fig leaves and made
[27:53] themselves aprons. That bouch, that
[27:55] covering.
[27:57] So now shame
[28:00] replaces nakedness.
[28:03] That a Roman the Hebrew they were naked
[28:04] and not ashamed. Now shame replaces
[28:07] that.
[28:08] It is and I hope you can really
[28:12] open up your heart and the Lord can just
[28:14] put the right words into this and help
[28:15] you with this. But when that this shame
[28:18] replaced this nakedness, this innocence,
[28:22] there was a sense of self-awareness. Now
[28:25] before it there was nothing abnormal,
[28:28] nothing wrong, nothing lacking.
[28:31] But now there's this sense of
[28:34] self-awareness. Therefore, a need to
[28:36] protect
[28:38] because he says, "I was afraid because I
[28:40] was naked. Now he's afraid because of
[28:42] his nakedness."
[28:44] The Eden that had existed
[28:47] around and centered around God's word.
[28:50] Think of how this has just changed. It's
[28:51] just been turned around. Originally, it
[28:53] was centered around God's word. God's
[28:55] word is the ultimate. It's all about
[28:57] God. And they're naked in God's
[28:59] presence. And there's no shame. But now,
[29:03] his nakedness causes him to be afraid.
[29:06] It causes him shame.
[29:08] &gt;&gt; Now his Eden has become self-centered.
[29:12] &gt;&gt; It's become all about himself.
[29:15] And uh in philosophy
[29:19] uh there is a phrase quite common but I
[29:22] think oftentimes it's attributed to
[29:23] Aristotle that nature abhores abhores a
[29:26] vacuum that in other words in nature if
[29:30] there's a space something's going to
[29:31] fill it and so Aristotle conjectured
[29:34] that there's no such thing as
[29:35] nothingness because if there was uh
[29:39] there something would feel that it's the
[29:42] idea that no true vacuum exists in
[29:43] nature because The difference in
[29:45] pressure results in an immediate force
[29:46] that acts to correct the equilibrium.
[29:48] And now you all get it.
[29:51] There cannot be a void. It's like if
[29:53] there's something empty, then the forces
[29:55] of nature want to fill it up.
[29:57] &gt;&gt; And we're like that way ourselves
[29:59] psychologically.
[30:01] How why is it that in a song service,
[30:02] the most awkward part is when
[30:04] everybody's waiting for the special to
[30:05] start,
[30:07] right? Silence, pause. It's that nature
[30:10] abhores a vacuum. They don't they don't
[30:13] like things when when things are
[30:15] uncovered or when things are naked and
[30:17] things are bare.
[30:19] &gt;&gt; And this is exactly when you say nature
[30:21] despises and doesn't like a vacuum.
[30:24] That's immediately how Adam acts. When
[30:25] he sees his nakedness, he instinctively
[30:28] acts to cover
[30:30] and he tries to hide his shame. They
[30:32] both try to hide their shame. Having
[30:35] lost their innocence, they're now trying
[30:36] to reconcile their nakedness. They once
[30:39] were naked and not ashamed. Now they're
[30:40] naked and afraid. They're naked and
[30:42] shamed and they wanted to cover that
[30:45] nakedness.
[30:47] Listen, there is a strong instinct in
[30:50] all of us
[30:52] to recoil from shame.
[30:55] And in recoiling, we retreat.
[30:59] We self-preserve. We want to soothe.
[31:02] We want to plate. We want to find our
[31:05] happy place and our safe place.
[31:08] In doing so, it's not that the nakedness
[31:11] is gone. We're trying to resolve the
[31:14] fear.
[31:16] We're trying to take care of the shame.
[31:19] And we're doing it in a way that is
[31:21] self-centered because when he says, "Ah,
[31:22] I'm naked." He went and made himself
[31:24] garments. And he hid from God. Eden at
[31:26] one time revolved around the presence of
[31:28] God. Now it revolves around Adam and his
[31:30] flesh. Right.
[31:32] &gt;&gt; And so he runs from the presence of God
[31:34] and he's acting to cover, to preserve,
[31:36] to save face as it were.
[31:40] &gt;&gt; Now there's my there's my foundation.
[31:43] And then from here,
[31:46] this could move pretty quickly.
[31:48] But now I want to make this relevant to
[31:50] us
[31:52] because the shame is real. And again,
[31:54] there's things that you all have
[31:55] experienced and maybe you deal with
[31:56] right now. Things in your life that you
[31:58] that gives you a sense of shame.
[32:00] things of your own doing, things of the
[32:02] doing doing of others.
[32:04] &gt;&gt; There's things that you might have to
[32:05] live with. You said, "I never did this."
[32:07] But you live with it. There may be
[32:09] things that you've done that you've
[32:10] repented of, but yet you still live
[32:12] under that.
[32:14] &gt;&gt; And the and there's nothing you could do
[32:16] to change it.
[32:18] &gt;&gt; Maybe you've looked for ways to make
[32:20] excuses. Maybe you've looked for ways to
[32:22] to figure it out. Even if you could if
[32:24] if you committed a crime and you've been
[32:26] accused of some felony and convicted,
[32:28] you might be able to have the record
[32:29] expuned and it may be completely done
[32:31] away with, but you'll never be able to
[32:32] convince yourself you didn't commit the
[32:34] crime.
[32:36] &gt;&gt; There's something there yet that will
[32:37] haunt.
[32:39] And so as we look at this shame that is
[32:42] on all of us in us around us, the evil
[32:45] that surrounds us in the atmosphere
[32:48] and the human instinct to try to deal
[32:50] with that, address it, or even our own
[32:52] shame is self-preservation.
[32:54] Uh it's self-centered.
[32:57] And there's this self-awareness to where
[33:00] the sense of shame moves us and guides
[33:01] us, but it guides us further away from
[33:03] God.
[33:05] &gt;&gt; Now, we're going to read this statement
[33:06] again. We read it on Wednesday night.
[33:09] Imperfect strength by perfect weakness.
[33:10] He chose to make Christ the example of
[33:12] us. For us. I don't think he misspoke.
[33:17] He chose to make Christ the example of
[33:20] us for us.
[33:23] So he's an example of you
[33:25] for you.
[33:28] &gt;&gt; And he brought him in humility.
[33:33] &gt;&gt; He is an example of us for us. And he
[33:37] came in humility. He's talking about his
[33:38] beginnings. His beginnings naked in a
[33:40] manger, but
[33:43] surrounded by manure and animals. And
[33:45] he's trying to show this is the way the
[33:47] innocent one came. The one that would
[33:48] know no sin.
[33:50] 1 Peter chapter 2 17 to 24. Honor all
[33:53] men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God.
[33:56] Honor the king. Servants. Be subject to
[33:58] your masters with all fear. Not only to
[34:00] the good and gentle, but also to the
[34:01] fword.
[34:03] For this is thank worthy. If a man for
[34:05] conscience toward God endure grief,
[34:07] suffering wrongfully,
[34:09] for what glory is it, if when you be
[34:11] buffeted for your faults, you shall take
[34:14] it patiently? But if and when you do
[34:16] well and suffer for it, you take it
[34:18] patiently. This is acceptable with God.
[34:20] So faults, suffering, grief,
[34:24] buffeted for your own wrongdoing, doing
[34:27] well yet suffering. Think of all these
[34:28] things that we could say are true of us.
[34:30] We're to still to take it patiently. If
[34:32] you've done something wrong and you're
[34:33] getting corrected, take it patiently. If
[34:35] you did nothing wrong and you're getting
[34:36] corrected, take it patiently. Right?
[34:38] Right? Even if it wasn't you that did it
[34:40] and it was one of your siblings, just
[34:41] take it patiently because that's
[34:43] acceptable with God.
[34:46] For even here unto ye called,
[34:49] because Christ also suffered for us,
[34:51] leaving us an example, an example of us
[34:54] for us, that ye should follow in his
[34:56] steps, the steps of suffering,
[34:59] the steps of rejection.
[35:02] who do who did no sin, neither was g
[35:04] found in his mouth. So Christ having
[35:06] done no sin suffered and took it
[35:08] patiently, how much more should we who
[35:10] are stubborn, rebellious,
[35:12] &gt;&gt; who when he was reviled, reviled not
[35:14] again. When he suffered, he threatened
[35:16] not. Key key scripture here, but
[35:18] committed himself to him that judgeth
[35:20] righteously.
[35:22] &gt;&gt; In other words, he accepted God's
[35:25] judgments on him.
[35:28] A God that discerns, a God that allows,
[35:30] a God that stops or allows. He He judged
[35:33] that if God would allow this suffering,
[35:34] he took it patiently. He committed
[35:36] himself to a God that would not allow
[35:38] anything that would destroy him, but in
[35:40] the end would use it for his benefit and
[35:43] God's glory.
[35:46] &gt;&gt; So when he was reviled, he didn't revile
[35:47] back. When he suffered, he didn't
[35:48] threaten. He didn't resort to these
[35:51] self-centered
[35:52] uh uh mechanisms of self-awareness, but
[35:55] he committed himself to a God who he
[35:57] believed did all things well and that if
[36:00] I'm going through it, if I trust God,
[36:02] he'll get me through it.
[36:08] &gt;&gt; Who his own self bear our sins in his
[36:11] own body on the tree? Who sins?
[36:15] your sins
[36:17] &gt;&gt; on a tree that we being dead to sins
[36:20] should live under righteousness by whose
[36:22] stripes ye were healed.
[36:25] &gt;&gt; This calling back to Isaiah, bruised,
[36:28] rejected, no beauty in him that we would
[36:29] desire him. brokenness
[36:32] was a question I was asked when I
[36:33] ministered on the subject of beauty and
[36:37] and it was if if beauty being so
[36:39] desirable to God, how do we how do we
[36:42] reconcile Christ who had no beauty? How
[36:46] do we reconcile the scars? Think about
[36:48] those things.
[36:50] Brother Random said writes in the church
[36:52] age book, he said, "I'll give you a
[36:54] sign."
[36:56] God said, "Not the sign of a white
[36:59] collared priesthood, not the sign of
[37:02] wealth and power." Please listen to
[37:04] this. There's nothing in this sign that
[37:06] you will want or think suitable.
[37:09] &gt;&gt; Nothing in the sign that you would
[37:11] desire. Nothing in the example that
[37:14] you're going to say, "Sign me up."
[37:17] But it is an everlasting sign.
[37:19] &gt;&gt; It is the greatest sign of all. Jehovah
[37:22] standing in the courtyard, bruised and
[37:24] bleeding with thorns on his brow and
[37:25] spit on his face, mocked and said it
[37:27] not. Jehovah despised and rejected,
[37:30] hanging naked upon the cross, while the
[37:32] hypocrites jered and dared him to come
[37:34] off the cross.
[37:36] What did they say? He's not able to save
[37:38] himself.
[37:40] Ah, he helped others when he was alive.
[37:42] Now he's not able to save himself.
[37:44] Brother Bram said that was the greatest
[37:45] compliment they could have given him.
[37:47] But yet to them that was the mic drop.
[37:49] Jehovah dying. Jehovah praying and
[37:51] nothing happening. Then Jehovah died.
[37:53] That is a sign for all men now. There
[37:56] isn't another like it. It is the great
[37:58] one, the everlasting sign. Think of how
[38:02] much we love signs these days, right?
[38:04] I'll give you a sign. Well, the I'm
[38:07] going say this very clearly. The bride
[38:08] has already received her last sign.
[38:10] Amen.
[38:11] &gt;&gt; So other miracles, signs, discernments,
[38:14] prophecies, gifts that manifest, that's
[38:16] just all things that have been in the
[38:18] church since the beginning.
[38:20] &gt;&gt; But as far as bride age, bride revival,
[38:24] rapture, what we need rapture, the signs
[38:26] been given to point us to that.
[38:28] &gt;&gt; But we still love signs, right? If
[38:31] somebody can stand up and tell us
[38:32] something about ourselves or tell us
[38:34] that you uh you've this happened to you
[38:38] and you're going to be able to do this,
[38:39] you're going to be able to do that and
[38:40] they told you you'd never be able to do
[38:41] it again. You know what we think?
[38:42] Awesome. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.
[38:45] Yes. There's a lot of people that live
[38:48] today under the shame of an unfulfilled
[38:50] prophecy because someone told them they
[38:52] were going to have a baby and they were
[38:53] going to name him such and such. And now
[38:54] with their hyerectomy, they're believing
[38:56] in a greater deliverance and a greater
[38:58] miracle. And I'm not saying God can't do
[39:00] it, but they didn't put their faith in
[39:01] God. They put it in the man who
[39:03] prophesied over them. Why? Because they
[39:06] loved what he was saying and it gave
[39:08] them hope.
[39:11] &gt;&gt; And notice how that can clothe you.
[39:13] Gives you an imagination.
[39:15] &gt;&gt; Imagination is a nasty thing because now
[39:17] they can imagine themselves
[39:19] instead of the brokenness of God. I'm
[39:21] broken.
[39:23] &gt;&gt; We love signs, but here's the
[39:25] everlasting sign, not the sign of wealth
[39:26] and power. There's nothing in this sign
[39:28] you'll want or think suitable, but it
[39:29] was that brokenness, the nakedness, the
[39:31] mocking, the jeering. And Isaiah
[39:33] 53:10-12, yet it pleased the Lord to
[39:35] bruise him. This is how he committed
[39:38] himself to him that judgeth righteously,
[39:40] because God was pleased to bruise him.
[39:42] He hath put him to grief.
[39:45] When thou shalt make his soul an
[39:46] offering for sin, he shall see his seed,
[39:48] he shall prolong his days, and the
[39:49] pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in
[39:50] his hand. There had to be death before
[39:52] life. There'd be bruising and grief, and
[39:54] he had to become a lamb, a sacrifice,
[39:57] that his seed may be prolonged. He shall
[39:59] see of the travail of his soul, and
[40:01] shall be satisfied. By his knowledge
[40:03] shall my righteous servant justify many.
[40:05] For he shall bear their iniquities.
[40:07] Beautiful prophecy. Therefore will I
[40:09] divide his portion with the great, and
[40:10] he shall divide the spoil with the
[40:12] strong. There's a lot we're reading here
[40:13] about prospering, prolonging, greatness,
[40:17] satisfaction. But he says because he
[40:20] hath poured out his soul unto death.
[40:23] There could never be strength. There can
[40:26] never be inheritance. There can never be
[40:28] prolonging. There can never be pleasure
[40:30] without the bruising, the grief, the
[40:31] offering.
[40:32] &gt;&gt; Pouring out his soul into unto death, he
[40:34] was numbered with the transgressors. And
[40:35] he bare the sin of many and made
[40:36] intercession of the transgressors.
[40:39] &gt;&gt; This is not a pleasant thing.
[40:42] There's a lot of people that get a
[40:43] messiah complex,
[40:46] but rarely
[40:48] is it in this vein that they'd be
[40:49] willing to give their lives. They want
[40:50] everyone else to do it. Give me all your
[40:52] money. Give me all your wives. Give me
[40:54] all this. Give me all that. And they're
[40:55] messiahs and their gurus and everyone
[40:57] follows them. But it's all for the
[40:58] benefit of them. It's nothing but the
[41:00] first Adam,
[41:01] &gt;&gt; not the second Adam or the last Adam.
[41:04] It's self-pres preservation. It's
[41:06] egotistical.
[41:08] It's religious covering.
[41:10] But here's the real heart of the
[41:12] Messiah. Grief, bruising, offering, pour
[41:16] it out unto death.
[41:18] Brother Brandham, in perfect strength,
[41:19] by perfect weakness, they stripped him
[41:21] stark naked and hung him up up there on
[41:23] a cross. This is how he came. When he's
[41:27] on the cross, you read the scripture and
[41:29] it talks about how they parted his
[41:30] garments after he was passed and they
[41:32] divided it and everything and say,
[41:33] "Well, we can maybe gather from that
[41:35] that he's naked." And some scholars uh
[41:38] suggest that perhaps he he wasn't naked.
[41:40] But the real reality almost every
[41:43] everyone would agree when you look at
[41:44] the the the the intent of crucifixion,
[41:47] brother. So they crucified him in the
[41:49] shame of hanging him up there naked
[41:51] before those people.
[41:54] Notice exactly what's happened in this
[41:55] moment where Christ is laid bare on the
[41:58] cross, lifted up before everyone to see
[42:00] him in his shame after everything he
[42:02] taught, all the miracles he performed.
[42:04] Now this is the end of this great
[42:05] teacher. This is the end of the Messiah.
[42:07] And Jesus exposes himself to the shame
[42:09] of the garden.
[42:11] &gt;&gt; What was it that Adam felt in that
[42:13] moment? Uh when he saw his nakedness, he
[42:15] was ashamed and covered himself. But now
[42:17] Christ exposes himself to nakedness. And
[42:20] he does not hide. He does not run. He
[42:22] does not cover himself.
[42:24] &gt;&gt; The Roman crucifixion was intended to
[42:26] maximize shame and embarrassment.
[42:30] He stripped him naked and embarrassed
[42:32] him.
[42:33] In Philippians chapter 2:es 5 to8, let
[42:36] this mind be in you which was also in
[42:37] Christ Jesus who being in the form of
[42:40] God thought it not robbery to be equal
[42:41] with God. In other words, it's not easy.
[42:45] But made himself of no reputation, took
[42:48] upon him the form of a servant, and was
[42:51] made in the likeness of men.
[42:53] There's this condescension with each one
[42:55] of those phrases.
[42:57] You could have just a regular man who
[42:59] has no reputation, but then you have the
[43:00] servant and being made in the likeness
[43:03] of men, being found in fashion as a man,
[43:05] he humbled himself.
[43:08] We look at we look at being humble as
[43:10] this great attribute, that funny thing
[43:12] that as soon as you think you have it,
[43:14] you've lost it.
[43:16] &gt;&gt; He humbled himself and became obedient
[43:18] unto death. Even the death of the cross,
[43:21] that's not a pleasant death.
[43:24] That's not uh assisted suicide or
[43:27] euthanasia. That's not just being able
[43:29] to go on your own terms. It was
[43:31] horrible. It was excruciating.
[43:34] In Hebrews 12:es 1:2, just see how he's
[43:36] an example of us for us. Wherefore,
[43:38] seeing we also are compassed about with
[43:40] so great a cloud of witnesses, let us
[43:42] lay aside every weight, and the sin
[43:43] which does so easily beset us, and let
[43:46] us run with the with patience the race
[43:48] that is set before us, looking unto
[43:50] Jesus, the author and finisher of our
[43:52] faith, who for the joy that was set
[43:55] before him endured the cross, despising
[43:59] the shame, and is sat down at the right
[44:02] hand of the throne of God.
[44:05] &gt;&gt; He accepted the shame.
[44:08] He didn't he didn't want it. He wasn't
[44:11] gleeful. He wasn't an exhibitionist and
[44:13] he wasn't a satist. He wasn't wanting
[44:15] just to be killed and and all that. I
[44:17] can't think of a better way to go than
[44:18] just to be tortured. No, he endured the
[44:20] cross, despised the shame. He is
[44:23] actually bearing the nakedness of the
[44:25] garden
[44:27] &gt;&gt; and living, dying, buried, rising,
[44:29] coming. He says there he hung there on
[44:31] Calvar's cross, not as you see him on a
[44:34] crucifix with a little rag wrapped
[44:35] around his loins. They stripped him
[44:37] naked. They embarrassed him to
[44:39] everything that they could embarrass him
[44:41] to and hung him there on the Calvary.
[44:43] And he was disgraced and despised and
[44:45] rejected and spit on. They're wanting to
[44:48] humiliate him.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; Says he became sin for us. That's the
[44:51] reason he had to be punished the way he
[44:53] was because all of our sins were placed
[44:55] upon him.
[44:57] &gt;&gt; And there he had to bear them away in
[44:59] his own body to Calvary. A reproach, a
[45:00] disgrace. Sinfully hanging there naked,
[45:02] stripped, bleeding, bleeding.
[45:05] What a picture.
[45:08] Christ, the sinless one, is disgraced.
[45:12] The one who prayed, "Father, glorify me
[45:15] with the glory that we had in the
[45:16] beginning,
[45:18] &gt;&gt; the perfect man, the just man, the right
[45:20] man, the sinless man,
[45:24] &gt;&gt; but now he's tempted in all points and
[45:26] like manner we are."
[45:28] He suffers.
[45:30] He's pressed. He's tempted. And now he
[45:33] faces death and he's made a reproach, a
[45:35] disgrace. He's naked and embarrassed.
[45:41] Cries out in the words of the psalmist,
[45:43] "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken
[45:46] me?"
[45:47] &gt;&gt; He felt forsaken.
[45:51] Redemption by power. Brother says, "How
[45:52] people paint his picture sometime with a
[45:54] robe around them or something other on
[45:55] the cross?" That is not so. They
[45:57] disposed that man of every foul, vulgar
[45:59] thing that they could.
[46:02] They were trying. They wanted to
[46:03] absolutely humiliate him. They swapped
[46:05] him out for a murderer.
[46:08] I mean, that
[46:10] &gt;&gt; that's like getting traded for future
[46:11] considerations.
[46:13] If you're an athlete,
[46:15] they're just dumping him. No value in
[46:17] him whatsoever.
[46:20] But he had to be. He had to be.
[46:25] I know. We might want to think, wow,
[46:27] remember where we read Christ suffered
[46:30] suffered as an example to us.
[46:33] So, oh, he did it for us. He took all
[46:36] the suffering for your sin.
[46:38] For your sin, he took it. He paid the
[46:40] price. So now, for a joy which is set
[46:42] before you, you can endure the shame.
[46:44] You can endure the suffering. He had to
[46:47] do it.
[46:49] We might think, well, if it was so, if
[46:51] that's what was necessary, why didn't
[46:52] God just do what Abel did? Just go find
[46:54] the innocent lamb, take him, kill him.
[46:56] Boom. We're done, right? We're done.
[46:57] It's over. There he was, the highest and
[47:00] loyalist of all the world that ever was
[47:02] or will be. And then exposed, naked on
[47:04] the cross, wounded, smitten, bleeding,
[47:06] gobs of mockery, spit hanging from his
[47:08] face, a mocking crown of thorns on his
[47:11] head.
[47:14] I know this picture may be hard to
[47:16] imagine.
[47:18] The artistic renderings and the
[47:20] dramatizations
[47:22] do their part to try to get us to
[47:24] mentally and maybe in our carnal minds
[47:26] grasp this horrible scene.
[47:30] But in this crucifixion,
[47:34] he had committed himself to him that
[47:35] judge judgeth righteously
[47:39] and it pleased the Lord to do it.
[47:43] So this humiliation of Christ was
[47:46] supernatural justice.
[47:50] Christ stripped of all ability.
[47:55] Christ stripped of all honor. Despised
[47:57] and rejected of man. Stripped naked.
[48:00] Embarrassed. But now not even just to
[48:02] man, but even in the sense of God's love
[48:04] for him that he now feels as if the
[48:06] father has turned his back on him.
[48:09] &gt;&gt; My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken
[48:11] me? There's rejection.
[48:14] There's eternal separation from God. He
[48:16] felt death now in his spirit before the
[48:19] body succumbed to it.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; Therefore, he could say it is finished.
[48:26] This humiliation,
[48:29] shaming of Christ
[48:32] is justice.
[48:36] In 2 Corinthians chapter 12:es 9 to10,
[48:39] Christ is an example of us for us. He
[48:41] says said unto Paul in light of his
[48:43] thorns,
[48:46] what thorns do you have? What scars do
[48:49] you bear? What reproach do you have?
[48:52] Whether it be in your family, your own
[48:53] decisions, your own circumstances,
[48:56] what measuring sticks do you feel that
[48:59] you don't measure up to the blessings of
[49:00] God in other people's lives, or or you
[49:03] don't uh measure up to God's love?
[49:07] He says, "My grace is sufficient for
[49:09] thee.
[49:11] For my strength is made perfect in
[49:13] weakness.
[49:15] My grace is enough.
[49:19] I have I have a void. I have an
[49:22] emptiness. I have a hurt. I have a pain.
[49:25] I have shame." He's saying, "My grace is
[49:27] enough.
[49:29] &gt;&gt; Lord, take it away." Well,
[49:32] my grace is enough.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; Lord, change the record. changed the
[49:36] story. My grace is enough,
[49:39] &gt;&gt; Lord. Make it go away. My grace is
[49:41] enough
[49:44] &gt;&gt; for my strength is made perfect in
[49:46] weakness.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; Now, we're being challenged to think
[49:48] differently than Adam did. Adam in his
[49:50] moment of self-awareness went straight
[49:52] to self-preservation. But now he's
[49:54] saying, "Most gladly, therefore, I glory
[49:55] in my infirmities that the power of
[49:57] Christ may rest upon me." Something that
[49:59] stands out when you look at the
[50:00] narrative of Adam. Adam, when he
[50:01] recognized he was naked, didn't run to
[50:03] God and ask for forgiveness. Yes.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; He didn't run to him and plead on behalf
[50:07] of himself and his wife saying, "Forgive
[50:09] us. I've made a huge mistake." But he
[50:11] hides himself. And then he's like,
[50:12] "Adam, what have you done?" He goes,
[50:14] "It's the woman. It's always the woman,
[50:16] right?
[50:18] That she did it. My wife." Adam not only
[50:22] did not have the instinct to repent
[50:24] initially, his instinct was to preserve
[50:26] himself. And now when the the the focus
[50:28] is squarely on him, he wants to deflect
[50:30] a little. Blame the woman and that
[50:32] serpent over there.
[50:39] And Paul doesn't do as Adam does, but he
[50:42] now will avail himself in his weakness
[50:45] that the power of Christ may rest upon
[50:47] me. I'm not going to run from the
[50:48] presence of God.
[50:49] &gt;&gt; We make bad mistakes. We do things we
[50:52] shouldn't do. We get in the grips of
[50:53] fears and anxieties. Sometimes we act
[50:56] completely out of character. It might be
[50:57] medication. It might be stress. There
[50:59] might be a lot of ways that we find
[51:00] ourselves doing things that a son or
[51:02] daughter of God cannot do. And we can't
[51:04] just try to wipe that away and pretend
[51:06] it never happened. We confess our faults
[51:07] and the blood of Jesus Christ will cover
[51:10] us, but we can't run from his presence.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; And we ask that the power of God would
[51:15] rest upon us.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; To change us.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; In James 4:6, very simply, he says, "He
[51:22] giveth more grace in the light of all
[51:25] these things." He's talking about the
[51:26] lust of the flesh. He's talking about
[51:27] being driven to do things you shouldn't
[51:28] do. He's talking about this evil that
[51:29] works within our members, these things
[51:31] that hinder our perfection. He says he
[51:32] giveth more grace. What do we need in
[51:35] light of the way that we're moved and a
[51:37] man is caused to sin? What do we need
[51:40] when we have battles and wrestlings?
[51:42] What do we need when we have evil? What
[51:43] do we need when we have poverty and we
[51:45] have suffering? We need grace.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; He gives more grace. But how are we
[51:51] going to receive it? He resists the
[51:53] proud but gives grace unto the humble.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; If in our weaknesses we get prideful. If
[52:00] in our weakness we act like Adam. If in
[52:02] our losses, in our deficiencies, in our
[52:04] poverties, in our lackings, in our needs
[52:06] and our distresses, in our famine, in
[52:08] our persecution, in our peril, in our
[52:10] nakedness and sorrow, if we use pride,
[52:13] we can't receive grace
[52:16] &gt;&gt; because he gives grace to the humble.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; I have it phrased here that God clothees
[52:22] the humbled in grace.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; And the message of grace, he says, he's
[52:27] talking about a situation in Hollywood.
[52:29] He said, "A boy not here long ago in
[52:31] Hollywood, some actor, I suppose,
[52:33] wouldn't kiss a girl because it was
[52:34] against his religion." Against his
[52:36] religion and make rock and roll pictures
[52:39] and things that's disgraceful and things
[52:41] like that.
[52:43] Calling out a hypocrite, isn't he? Like,
[52:44] you won't kiss a girl in a film because
[52:46] it's against your religion.
[52:48] Do you think that you could take your 30
[52:50] pieces of silver and merit something in
[52:52] God's grace? Judas
[52:54] won't buy nothing but a place in hell
[52:56] for you. This is the phrase,
[53:00] God's grace cannot be bargained for.
[53:04] God's grace cannot be bargained for. In
[53:08] other words, you have no purchase power
[53:10] to get it.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; You're jingling the change in your
[53:14] pocket and you're coming before the Lord
[53:15] and you're hoping you've got enough to
[53:17] get grace. Can't do it.
[53:21] For neither can it be talented into
[53:25] your gifts, your miracles, your signs
[53:27] and wonders, your worship, your praise,
[53:28] all these things. That doesn't get you
[53:30] grace. Grace cannot be bought. It cannot
[53:32] be bargained for. It can't be talented
[53:34] into. It's sovereign grace. Then he
[53:35] quotes him. Nothing in my arms I bring.
[53:37] Simply to thy cross I cling. And then he
[53:41] says, naked, wounded, I just come as I
[53:44] am.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; Who's the naked and wounded now? Who's
[53:49] the bruised? Who's the vulnerable? Who's
[53:51] the stripped bear? You are.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; Just as I am without one plea, but that
[53:56] thy blood was shed for me.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; And that thou bids me come to thee, oh
[54:01] lamb of God, I come. He said, that's
[54:03] all. It's grace that brought me.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; Grace did it.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; It's grace that brought you.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; It's grace that bought you.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; As brother Bart says, it's grace that
[54:15] bought you. It it's grace that purchased
[54:18] you.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; You You didn't pay for his grace.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; You didn't go searching through your
[54:23] house trying to find something worthy.
[54:25] You didn't finally find, oh, I did it. I
[54:27] merited it. I could do it. I could go to
[54:28] the altar. I could accept him as my
[54:29] savior. I've got something to show him.
[54:31] Nothing.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; Think of it. The only way that you can
[54:35] receive it is when you absolutely have
[54:39] nothing.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; Because if you have anything you hold on
[54:43] to to present, it just blocks it. Yeah,
[54:46] &gt;&gt; if you're holding anything in your mind
[54:47] as some redemptive value or quality, it
[54:49] just blocks it.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; Transaction nulled.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; In 1 Peter 5 to 11, likewise, you
[54:58] younger submit yourselves unto the
[54:59] elder. I'm expanding some of these
[55:01] readings so you can see it in context.
[55:02] Yay, all of you be subject one to
[55:04] another and be clothed with humility.
[55:08] The humility we all love is the false
[55:11] humility.
[55:12] We all love to appear humble. We love
[55:15] it. There's even a a mechanism where and
[55:19] I noticed that I did it. Oh, it's it's
[55:22] going to feel so good
[55:25] of when you want to appear humble,
[55:28] you'll you'll change the way you walk
[55:32] because you you want you want people to
[55:33] think, "Oh, he has a limp.
[55:37] He he he bows over a little bit." Right?
[55:41] You notice how sometimes some people try
[55:42] to get, you know, they're doing that,
[55:44] they just want your money, right?
[55:45] They're trying to see how big your
[55:47] wallet is. They're trying to just get
[55:49] their cash app close enough to yours to
[55:51] hopefully a transaction will go through.
[55:55] It's a false humility.
[56:01] God resist the proud
[56:04] and give a grace to the humble.
[56:08] So it says to be clothed with humility.
[56:10] It means that God has accepted you and
[56:14] clothed you with grace.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; Clothed with humility. Quite what a
[56:19] phrase. Humility is nakedness.
[56:23] Humility is nothingness.
[56:26] But when we are clothed,
[56:29] when we are when we are humbled, he
[56:31] gives grace to clothe us. He says,
[56:33] "Humble yourselves therefore under the
[56:34] mighty hand of God. Then he exalts you
[56:36] in due time." There's your debasement.
[56:38] There's your getting low. Casting all
[56:39] your care upon him, for he carth for
[56:41] you.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; Be sober. Be vigilant. Because your
[56:44] adversary to the devil, as a roaring
[56:45] lion, walketh about seeking whom he may
[56:46] devour.
[56:48] Whom resists steadfast in the faith.
[56:52] There's our how is our resistance is
[56:54] successful.
[56:56] Resistance without submission is futile.
[56:58] We must submit ourselves therefore to
[56:59] the Lord. There's the brokenness.
[57:00] There's humility.
[57:02] Unless we humble ourselves before the
[57:04] mighty hand of God and we get naked
[57:06] before him, then we are exposed and we
[57:09] cannot defend against the enemy.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; But when we submit to God, he clothe us
[57:15] with humility. He clothe us with grace
[57:18] and that's our defense against the
[57:20] enemy.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; Resisting the faith faith knowing whom
[57:24] resists steadfast in the faith this
[57:27] adversary knowing that the same
[57:28] afflictions are accomplished in your
[57:30] brethren that are in the world. the same
[57:32] affliction. Do you feel shamed? You feel
[57:33] outcast? You feel despised? You feel
[57:35] belittled? You feel different because of
[57:36] whatever it might be. Sickness, poverty,
[57:38] relationships, death, divorce,
[57:40] infertility, you name it, whatever it
[57:41] might be, you might feel shamed because
[57:44] of that. But these afflictions are
[57:46] accomplished in believers all over the
[57:47] world.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; But the God of all grace who have called
[57:52] us unto his eternal glory by Jesus
[57:54] Christ, think how it connects back to
[57:56] second Corinthians. Think how it
[57:57] connects to Romans. Think about all
[57:59] these places that it connects into.
[58:01] Called us into his eternal glory by
[58:03] Christ. What can separate us from the
[58:04] love of God? Uh uh through in all these
[58:07] things we are more than conquerors.
[58:08] Through him that loved us. Eternal glory
[58:10] by Christ Jesus. After you have suffered
[58:12] a while, make you perfect, establish,
[58:15] strengthen, settle you. To him be glory
[58:18] and dominion forever and ever.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; Paul had the revelation. Peter had the
[58:22] revelation. What is it that in my
[58:24] weaknesses, in my debasement, in my
[58:26] disgracefulness, in my nakedness,
[58:29] his power can rest upon me.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; There's a there's a lot of suffering we
[58:36] all go through. I try to try to wrap
[58:39] these things up here. There's a lot of
[58:40] suffering that we all go through, but
[58:42] there was this on the cross, it was even
[58:45] in the garden of Gethsemane. And on the
[58:47] cross, that was redemptive suffering.
[58:48] Amen.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; And what redemptive suffering does,
[58:53] there is. So, there's a Adam sinned and
[58:56] then covered himself. There's suffering
[58:58] in that.
[59:00] There's suffering in the world. There's
[59:02] suffering through our problems and all
[59:03] of our disabilities. There's suffering
[59:04] through our evil. But then there's
[59:06] suffering. And what redemptive suffering
[59:08] does is it strips all of that suffering
[59:10] of its religious covering.
[59:13] strips of all its excuses, all its
[59:16] self-preservation, all its
[59:17] interpretations.
[59:19] Some people want to have control over
[59:20] things that when things get out of their
[59:22] control, they just define it the way
[59:24] they want to.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; They just interpret the outcome to you.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; They still want to be in control of the
[59:30] process.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; They still want to be able to interpret
[59:33] the outcome even if they had nothing to
[59:35] do with it. That's right.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; But what redemptive suffering does and
[59:39] when we enter into and accept redemptive
[59:42] suffering, we take our suffering,
[59:44] whether it be of our own disobedience
[59:45] and rebellion or hardness or mistakes,
[59:47] or whether it be for the sake of the
[59:49] cross, we take that and remove it from
[59:51] any self-preservation, any ego, any eye,
[59:56] &gt;&gt; any me,
[1:00:00] and we strip it naked.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:04] Redemptive suffering strips suffering
[1:00:05] naked.
[1:00:07] Jesus says in Mark 4:es 34 and 35, but
[1:00:10] when he had called the people unto him
[1:00:11] with his disciples, he said unto them,
[1:00:13] whosoever will come after me, let him
[1:00:15] deny himself and take up his cross and
[1:00:18] follow me. He says the first part
[1:00:20] because it's the hardest part,
[1:00:23] self-denial.
[1:00:25] There's been many martyrs for a cause,
[1:00:29] but in doing so, they didn't deny self.
[1:00:32] Think about this.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; There's been a lot of maybe religious
[1:00:36] kamicazis that took their own lives for
[1:00:39] a cause, but they didn't deny self.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; For who so shall will save his life
[1:00:44] shall lose it, but whosoever shall lose
[1:00:46] his life for my sake and the gospels.
[1:00:49] The losing can't be for your sake.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; The losing can't be for your reputation.
[1:00:54] It can't be for your honor. It can't be
[1:00:55] for your glory. It must be for Christ
[1:00:57] and for the gospels. That one shall be
[1:01:00] saved.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:02] In other words, there's a necessity
[1:01:05] in the emptiness.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; There's a necessity in in the
[1:01:09] brokenness,
[1:01:11] the vulnerability, the losing of your
[1:01:13] life. It must be lost in order to find
[1:01:15] it.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; But you can't do it for pretense sake.
[1:01:19] You must deny yourself then lose your
[1:01:22] life to find eternal life.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; To live
[1:01:27] to say the life that I now live,
[1:01:31] I live by the faith of God, the faith of
[1:01:33] Christ. To say that I live by his faith
[1:01:35] is to accept that he died for your sins.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; Is to accept that the life you had
[1:01:40] before was debased. To live by faith and
[1:01:43] be covered by grace, we must first die
[1:01:46] to ourselves.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; And become naked. Amen.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; The necessity of nakedness.
[1:01:54] When I preached life by death, I was
[1:01:56] thinking of the necessity of death, the
[1:01:58] necessity of evil, the necessity of
[1:02:00] nakedness.
[1:02:06] Grace cannot enter in
[1:02:10] if our covering protects us from shame.
[1:02:15] He gives grace to the humbled. He wants
[1:02:18] to clothe you in humility.
[1:02:20] But as long as we have anything that
[1:02:23] we're using to hide behind.
[1:02:26] When God clothed Adam and the woman, he
[1:02:29] stripped them and they had to re be
[1:02:31] recovered.
[1:02:35] And being naked makes us uncomfortable.
[1:02:37] What's that rec? I didn't look it up. I
[1:02:39] was meant last week maybe to look up
[1:02:40] what Freud had to say about those dreams
[1:02:42] where you show up to school with just
[1:02:44] your underwear on, right? or you're
[1:02:47] standing up before a crowd, you still
[1:02:48] have your pajamas on, whatever it might
[1:02:49] be, and it's that sense of shame and
[1:02:51] that awkwardness and that nakedness. We
[1:02:54] don't like it.
[1:02:56] Therefore, in this spiritual sense, we
[1:02:57] got to reject our instinct to deny our
[1:02:59] nakedness,
[1:03:01] accept our nakedness
[1:03:04] and let God's grace cover our shame.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; We must repent of our sins.
[1:03:11] A and all sin must be repented of all
[1:03:13] your disbelief. But that if I could just
[1:03:16] take it in another angle, there's things
[1:03:17] that you can say, "Well, that's I'm I
[1:03:19] haven't sinned when I did that." So, we
[1:03:22] repent of our sins, but we cannot hide
[1:03:24] our imperfections.
[1:03:26] We cannot hide our sufferings. We cannot
[1:03:28] try to hide our shame.
[1:03:30] Brother Bradam in the sermon, the
[1:03:32] reaction to an action. There may be
[1:03:34] Christians here who did wrong and say,
[1:03:35] "I feel ashamed to rise up and go to
[1:03:37] that altar." But may they look at the
[1:03:40] cross and see the shame that he bore,
[1:03:43] stripped his clothes, naked, beat him,
[1:03:45] hung on a cross, and lifted up between
[1:03:47] the heavens and earth.
[1:03:50] May we take a note from his humiliation,
[1:03:53] the sinless one. What was his injustice?
[1:03:57] He never did anything wrong,
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; but yet he suffered and took it
[1:04:00] patiently and committed himself to a
[1:04:02] righteous judge. He took upon himself
[1:04:05] supernatural justice, not injustice,
[1:04:07] justice, redemptive suffering. When you
[1:04:11] suffer for your own mistakes and your
[1:04:13] own rebellion or stubbornness, repent,
[1:04:15] make it right with God. Ask for the
[1:04:16] blood of Jesus Christ to cover you. And
[1:04:18] that's what you must do. Accepting his
[1:04:20] perpetuation, the innocence blood for
[1:04:23] your own sins. But now, what about the
[1:04:25] evil that's visited upon us when we feel
[1:04:27] that we have not done anything wrong?
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; We must take it patiently.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; We must accept that as he hung on the
[1:04:35] cross naked, there may be things that we
[1:04:36] are stripped of, things that we wouldn't
[1:04:39] talk about, things we wouldn't
[1:04:40] broadcast, things we don't want other
[1:04:41] people to know, but we have to say,
[1:04:42] "Lord, I have to accept this emptiness."
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; Revelations 3:14 to18
[1:04:52] in this message to the church of the
[1:04:53] Leodysans,
[1:04:57] he says that you they they claim that
[1:04:58] they are rich, increased with goods, and
[1:05:00] have need of nothing. This is our
[1:05:01] obligatory companion scripture to
[1:05:04] Genesis 2 and 3.
[1:05:06] And you don't know that you're wretched,
[1:05:07] miserable, poor, blind, and naked,
[1:05:11] rich, increased with goods, and have
[1:05:13] need of nothing. So there's there's
[1:05:16] they're full,
[1:05:19] but they're actually naked.
[1:05:22] So what they've done, they've filled
[1:05:24] their void with something else, just
[1:05:27] like Adam did in the beginning.
[1:05:29] where the garden ended is where Leodysia
[1:05:31] ends
[1:05:33] because here they are completely
[1:05:37] uh naked and they cover themselves. Now
[1:05:39] the church has kicked Christ out of the
[1:05:41] church and they're naked but they claim
[1:05:43] to be rich. They don't even have any
[1:05:45] goods because they're poor.
[1:05:49] Uh they they they have things to make
[1:05:51] them comfortable. They're miserable.
[1:05:54] They have needed nothing but they're
[1:05:55] blind and naked. Where's the blindness?
[1:05:57] They're not aware of their own
[1:05:59] nakedness. So he counsels them to buy
[1:06:01] gold that they may be rich and white
[1:06:04] raignment that they may be clothed and
[1:06:06] anoint their eyes with is that they may
[1:06:07] see. And this phrase is hitting a little
[1:06:11] bit different these days because he says
[1:06:12] that thou mayest be clothed
[1:06:15] that the shame of thy nakedness do not
[1:06:17] appear.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; What has he done away with?
[1:06:23] The shame of it.
[1:06:26] that the shame of thy nakedness does not
[1:06:28] appear.
[1:06:30] Christ has made it possible through
[1:06:34] Christ, through his love, through the
[1:06:35] cross, through Christ, he has made it
[1:06:37] possible that we could be naked and not
[1:06:39] ashamed.
[1:06:41] What in the world? Not through our own
[1:06:44] sinlessness, not through our innocence
[1:06:47] or perfection. Whereas Adam was naked
[1:06:50] and ashamed, he tried to cover it with
[1:06:52] his own religion. Christ has made made
[1:06:54] it possible that we could be naked and
[1:06:55] not ashamed. Not through innocence but
[1:06:58] through grace.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; There it is. It's through his grace
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; that we can still be naked
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; but not ashamed.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; We say, "Lord, I'm naked. I'm naked. I'm
[1:07:10] vulnerable. I'm naked. Lord, God, help
[1:07:12] me. I feel so lost. I feel so paralyzed.
[1:07:15] I feel naked. My grace is enough.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; But Lord, I want wealth. I want
[1:07:19] prosperity. I want health. I want
[1:07:21] happiness. My grace is enough, Lord. I'm
[1:07:23] naked. I don't want to be shamed. My
[1:07:25] grace is enough.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; He doesn't take away the nakedness.
[1:07:29] He'll take away the shame of it.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; Where you could stand like Paul say,
[1:07:34] "Yeah, I've got a lot of thorns, but
[1:07:35] God's going to use them for his glory."
[1:07:37] Yeah, I've got a lot of loss, but in
[1:07:38] there, God's going to give me what I
[1:07:39] need.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; In the preview of the bride, this theme
[1:07:44] just reoccurs.
[1:07:46] How does Leodysia end? dancing to the
[1:07:49] wrong kind of music, absolutely naked,
[1:07:54] just like Israel in Exodus 32.
[1:08:00] Disgraceful is a term that's used.
[1:08:03] vulgar, filthy,
[1:08:05] but then onward Christian soldiers
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; and they're described as marching
[1:08:11] perfectly in harmony with God's word,
[1:08:15] clothed in glory, in righteousness.
[1:08:21] And it's still grace that's covering
[1:08:23] them because even when they got out of
[1:08:25] step,
[1:08:26] grace
[1:08:28] was present.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; Grace was sufficient.
[1:08:34] I hope today that you hear the voice of
[1:08:36] God speaking to your heart.
[1:08:39] We have a lot of things in our lives
[1:08:41] that make us feel naked,
[1:08:44] ashamed,
[1:08:45] and Satan uses shame over you.
[1:08:49] I heard a song some years ago that used
[1:08:52] personified shame as a woman that he was
[1:08:55] married to and how it ruled him,
[1:08:59] controlled him. But he said that Christ
[1:09:02] showed up one day with divorce papers
[1:09:05] and exposed shame and shame had to leave
[1:09:08] because he said he talked about shame
[1:09:10] washes over me and I can't believe in
[1:09:13] the power of God and shame makes me be
[1:09:15] afraid of God's holy fire. And then the
[1:09:18] song resolves grace washes over me.
[1:09:22] Not shame anymore but grace. But you're
[1:09:25] still naked but grace covers. You're
[1:09:28] still weak, but grace covers. You're
[1:09:31] still barren, but grace covers. They
[1:09:33] still died, but grace covers. You're
[1:09:35] still poor, but grace covers.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; You'll never get it back again, but
[1:09:40] grace covers.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; Grace covers.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Brothers, if you could come to your
[1:09:47] instrument. Brother says in Hebrews
[1:09:49] chapter 7:2, "If you want something from
[1:09:50] the Lord, just put your heart out before
[1:09:52] him now." He said, "The Nazarines, you
[1:09:54] have you can't wear a ring. You can't
[1:09:56] wear a watch. You have to have certain
[1:09:58] things. Your arms have to be your arms
[1:09:59] have to be this long. You're like,
[1:10:01] "Wait, what?" He says, "The sleeves,
[1:10:04] your skirt has to be that long." And men
[1:10:06] can't belong to the lodge.
[1:10:09] And they don't baptize you if you don't.
[1:10:11] Here comes the Catholics in. They have
[1:10:13] theirs. And here comes the Methodists in
[1:10:15] they have theirs. What is it? Everyone
[1:10:17] has their covering.
[1:10:20] Everyone has their uh requirements
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; for membership.
[1:10:25] Let me have let me see your financial
[1:10:27] statements. There's all sorts of
[1:10:29] requirements. What are you going to
[1:10:30] bring? What can what can you bring to
[1:10:31] the table? They all have their capital
[1:10:33] calls, right? This is what you've got to
[1:10:35] do to be a part of the club. Every one
[1:10:37] of them has a yard stick to measure up
[1:10:39] to. These are his words.
[1:10:42] You don't make it. All right. That's
[1:10:44] all. And then, but the real thing is
[1:10:47] this. Nothing in my arms I bring. Simply
[1:10:50] to the cross I cling. Oh, God. naked,
[1:10:54] wounded,
[1:10:56] need secure. He says, "Need help."
[1:10:59] Now, you're the naked and the wounded.
[1:11:01] Can we just admit that?
[1:11:03] That we are the naked and the wounded.
[1:11:08] [Music]
[1:11:18] I most humbly come Christ confessing
[1:11:20] that I'm nothing and there's nothing
[1:11:22] within me. What is humility? To accept
[1:11:25] your humiliation.
[1:11:30] Then God receives you. Now you might not
[1:11:32] even know your ABCs. You might not know
[1:11:34] coffee from split peas. You might know
[1:11:37] not know he from hall, right hand from
[1:11:39] left hand. It don't make any difference
[1:11:41] what you don't know. Coffee from split
[1:11:43] peas. He from hall. It doesn't matter.
[1:11:48] There's one thing you must know
[1:11:51] that Jesus Christ took your place as a
[1:11:52] sinner and you take your place to stand
[1:11:56] in his righteousness. Confessing every
[1:11:58] day that you're wrong and love him with
[1:12:00] all your heart and your whole motives be
[1:12:03] set towards him, you'll make heaven.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; He said that's all there is to it. For
[1:12:07] the life that was in Christ has to be in
[1:12:08] you or you're lost.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; So you have to be lost to be found,
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:12:15] And so where is salvation? In
[1:12:17] recognizing that you're lost, helpless,
[1:12:21] hopeless, pitiful.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; And your humility is in accepting your
[1:12:28] nakedness.
[1:12:30] Accepting the shame of your nakedness
[1:12:34] in coming to God and saying, "This is
[1:12:37] nothing I can resolve,
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; but I'm not going to run from it. I'm
[1:12:40] not going to hide from it. I'm going to
[1:12:43] come wounded and broken to you.
[1:12:46] I'm going to expose myself to your
[1:12:48] opinions, to your judgment. I stand
[1:12:49] before you now exposed.
[1:12:52] And I and I plead nothing but the blood
[1:12:55] of Jesus.
[1:12:57] And grace,
[1:12:59] what does grace do? Washes over you.
[1:13:04] And he says, let me just especially
[1:13:06] think of it because I had some
[1:13:08] scriptures in here about how we don't
[1:13:09] want to be naked when we die, right? We
[1:13:12] want to be clothed upon that there's a
[1:13:13] nakedness of the soul.
[1:13:16] And so what does God do that in this
[1:13:19] flesh, in this stinking rotting corpse
[1:13:23] that's going to make mistakes for the
[1:13:25] rest of your life, he says, I'm just
[1:13:28] going to dress you in my grace.
[1:13:31] I'll just cover you in my grace. That
[1:13:33] way when you when you see that you're
[1:13:35] naked, don't be ashamed. My grace is
[1:13:38] sufficient.
[1:13:39] Let's stand together today. Just receive
[1:13:42] his grace. I ask you right now, I
[1:13:44] implore you right now in the name of the
[1:13:45] Lord. His grace is enough. Can you just
[1:13:48] receive his grace right now? His grace
[1:13:51] for all your nakedness, all your shame,
[1:13:53] all your mistakes,
[1:13:55] all the things you've suffered, not of
[1:13:57] your own hands, that someone else is
[1:13:58] doing, family history,
[1:14:01] lack of spousal support, whatever it
[1:14:03] might be. So Lord, it shames me, but I
[1:14:06] accept your grace. I don't want to hide
[1:14:08] anymore.
[1:14:11] Lord, I accept your grace. Just bow your
[1:14:13] heads.
[1:14:14] Think upon these things for a moment.
[1:14:25] Let's pray together.
[1:14:28] Our gracious heavenly father, there is a
[1:14:30] tremendous
[1:14:32] uh pulling and dealing with hearts in
[1:14:34] this moment.
[1:14:36] And Lord, as I could pour out my own
[1:14:38] heart and confess my own faults and
[1:14:40] explore my own weaknesses,
[1:14:44] Lord, there's even a way that we can so
[1:14:46] manipulatively look at our mistakes as
[1:14:48] saying, "Well, God must have allowed it
[1:14:49] or God does this, but Lord, I want to
[1:14:52] just accept our own shortcomings, our
[1:14:55] own failures."
[1:14:58] We put a lot of blame on the devil.
[1:15:02] But Lord, for my own
[1:15:05] coverings, I repent.
[1:15:08] My own excuses, my own
[1:15:09] self-preservation.
[1:15:12] Truly, Lord, Adam could have said in the
[1:15:14] moment that he realized he was naked, he
[1:15:16] could have ran to the Lord and said, "I
[1:15:17] I made a mistake. The serpent beguiled
[1:15:20] us, or the serpent beguiled the woman,
[1:15:22] and I I ptook. I knew I was doing wrong,
[1:15:24] but Lord, forgive me. Forgive And
[1:15:26] certainly the blame would have been put
[1:15:28] on the devil. Adam would have accepted
[1:15:30] his part.
[1:15:33] And so Lord, there is a blame we can put
[1:15:35] on the the world, the sin, the devil,
[1:15:38] but ourselves, this flesh.
[1:15:41] It's therein that we deny ourselves and
[1:15:43] we expose it.
[1:15:46] Lord, may we
[1:15:48] may we rat on our flesh now, Lord.
[1:15:54] Lord, I want to snitch on myself.
[1:15:57] I make mistakes. I do things that I
[1:15:59] shouldn't do. I'm naked. I'm vulnerable.
[1:16:03] I ask it, Lord, in this weakness, this
[1:16:07] unbearable weakness.
[1:16:11] Your grace is enough.
[1:16:15] I believe it is enough.
[1:16:18] May we receive it today. And Lord, we
[1:16:21] can never be dressed and clothed in this
[1:16:24] grace until we are humbled. And our
[1:16:25] humility is in accepting our
[1:16:27] humiliation.
[1:16:28] You cannot dress us. Grace cannot cover
[1:16:31] our shame until we first recognize our
[1:16:34] nakedness.
[1:16:36] Isn't it amazing, Lord, how that our
[1:16:37] human minds will turn our shame into our
[1:16:40] covering of our nakedness? Therefore, we
[1:16:43] remain naked and ashamed. We're just
[1:16:45] blind to it.
[1:16:48] Lord, we cast aside our shame and we
[1:16:51] acknowledge our nakedness and we say
[1:16:53] your grace is enough. In the name of
[1:16:56] Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen.
