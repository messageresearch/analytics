TRANSCRIPT
========================================
galatians chapter six we'll start with verse one we'll read to verse ten and i these are um verses i i found that i was just as i was finishing studying yesterday i was pondering on just the number of scriptures we were using today and how a lot of them seem to be very familiar and so it seems that maybe even as a church a young church we revisit a lot of similar themes over the last year almost year and a half and i trust that the the repetition is beneficial and in each repetition there's more that would come out and more that would stand out to us more to be revealed if god is going to continue to unfold himself through eternity then we should be having the experience in church that the word continues to unfold itself and we're not just rallying around a personal doctrine that we gravitated to 30 years ago but the word keeps getting richer and unfolding around us galatians chapter 6 verse 1 brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault ye which are spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of meekness considering thyself lest thou also be tempted bear ye one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of christ for if a man think himself to be something when he is nothing he deceiveth himself but let every man prove his own work and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone and not in another for every man shall bear his own burden let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things be not deceived god is not mocked for whatsoever man soweth that shall he also reap for he that sowed to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that soweth to the spirit shall have the spirit reap life everlasting and let us not be weary in well doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men especially unto them who are of the household of faith amen you can be seated going to continue on the subject of barriers and boundaries and i will take a little bit of time this morning to recap some of the principles of the last two services just so that we're all the same page as we take a step forward in this and uh i have a title it's kind of a subject i want to approach the pride paradox i think i mentioned it uh that on perfect pride and i'm gonna call the pride paradox and i believe if you can follow me and just be patient and try to listen very diligently to the things we're expressing you'll be able to catch something very personal for yourself i've been getting some feedback from the different services it's been very very encouraging and what i've realized as i'm ministering is i feel that i'm doing i'm approaching it in a sense that's just very surface but yet there's a very very deep layers to the things we're expressing and i don't feel that i'm doing it justice at all and as i minister on this subject i can see the principle running on many different tracks so that if whatever situation you are in your life you may be applying it more to some spiritual things and the unfolding of the word there might be other ways where you're applying it to personal relationships but there's just so many different ways these things are applicable and so i trust that you could just really believe today that god's going to speak to you in a way that's particular to what you're going through and what you need and maybe you could even have the kind of faith to believe that lord you even know better than myself what i need therefore you can open my eyes and even as maybe we could say surprise me with something that really anchors in my heart for what i have need of so we'll want to continue on barriers and boundaries and the pride paradox wednesday night we were talking about how god is boundless as a god that fills all time in space he's a god who can do whatever he wants brother braham taught us in the absolute that he is unlimited in his power and being the absolute he is free from restraint he cannot be contained he is a god that is all-powerful all-knowing uh all omnipresent through his omniscience and this is a god who cannot be restrained he cannot stop but yet what makes him so great is that he will he's willing to confine himself he's willing to restrain himself he's willing to hold himself to his own word i can make a promise to you and say i promise i'll do this and then tomorrow break it and he said well why did you break it because i can i can break it i can break it if i wanna you don't you can't force me to do that you can't you can't make me make me do something and uh and in that way a god is willing to be bound by his word he's different he's better he's better than us his ways are higher than ours his thoughts higher than ours so he's willing to be bound in revelations chapter 3 verse 20 and hopefully i could just um enter right back in where we were revelations chapter 3 verse 20 says behold i here's christ a fugitive in his own church and kicked out of his own church i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come into him and will sup with him and he with me as we pondered this picture is the all-knowing all-powerful god pushed out of his own church and as he stands at the door god is powerful enough to enter god could even in the absence of a latchet in the absence of a handle god could push his way in but he chose to knock brother bam told us that in this way as he stood there he was waiting for us to let him in waiting for you to open up so we must permit god we must allow god we must give him permission because he will not force himself he's there he wants to sup with you he wants to fellowship with you but he's not going to force himself upon you he's not going to kick the door open he's not going to barge himself in it's in that way that he is a gentleman he's respecting the fact that the door is closed he's respecting the fact that you're inside and that's your place but he's wanting you to come out of that place of safety or that place of comfort or what you've always known he's wanting you to open up the door so he could come into you and change your situation change your circumstance and he's demonstrating how that he has respect for boundaries and so the door is in that way a part of a boundary and here you're in a place you're closed off christ is on the outside he's been put over some line he's on the outside of the church and the door represents this appropriate place to request an entrance he's not peeking in the window he's not crawling through some other way he's at the door and he's there at that place i'm knocking because that's where he wants to come in and so that kind of teaches us about boundaries that a boundary sets up certain parameters the door is the place to enter and so god will not force himself past a boundary because god we've demonstrated in scripture that god sets boundaries but then god also respects boundaries and a boundary if there is a boundary it doesn't always mean that you cannot pass or you cannot enter in a boundary as this scripture shows us we'll have points of entry gate or a door some sort of entry point we're not uh we may have uh we may be in a situation where we're traveling internationally or there's a border well just because there's a border or there's a wall doesn't mean everyone is barred from entering but you have to come to the appropriate place to enter the port of entry and to provide documentation and then you can be allowed in it just it's an example of how there's boundaries there's border lines there can be walls there can be hedges these things that are set up but there's a place where you can enter and christ is the entry point into the boundless word of god christ is the only way in it's through christ that we have access to the father god may hide himself and god may limit himself and god may place himself into his word and hide himself in his word and hide himself in simplicity but there's a way that we can find him there's a way that we can see him there's a way that we can fellowship with him and it's through christ so god sets boundaries god respects boundaries but god gives us also a point of access and entry but satan on the other hand he sets barriers he cannot establish limits satan cannot create he can only pervert and so god having created the earth satan does not have the ability to establish the parameters of the earth in the breadth of the earth and the breadth of creation of the limits of creation what satan tries to do is pervert the expression of god's creation so he places barriers and obstacles and hindrances in the way a barrier is something that obstructs an entrance a boundary is something that marks the limits of something so they're two different things and so satan sets barriers to the word of god and he disrespects the boundaries of the word of god it says this those are the characteristics of satan to disrespect boundaries and to cast barriers in front of the the entrances and the accesses to the full limits of god's word i believe it was last sunday we were using genesis chapter 2 verses 16 to 17 where god told a man that he was not to eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil and this prohibition of eating the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil was not meant to limit adam's power he's given dominion the whole earth is his he's to rule he's to reign he's to have dominion he's to subdue he's to eat of all the fruits of the field and the herbs he's to have all the creation at his disposal but then god identifies the fruit of this particular tree in the midst of the garden and in doing so god wasn't scaling back adam's power but it was a boundary for god's protection or for adam's protection it was a boundary of protection of for god's creation he says this is what i want you to do these are all your powers but don't partake of this not because he was taking that out of away from his powers but he was saying this will limit your power i've given you everything but this is one way that you can lose it i've given you everything but this is one way that you can diminish it and so it was something to be respected it was something to be honored not to restrain adam but so that he would remain completely free and in genesis chapter 3 we see that satan through the the body of the serpent enticed the woman and enticed her beyond the boundary of god's protection in order to get to her in order to throw a barrier in the way of mankind fulfilling genesis 1 26 and a way of trying to limit the expression of god's creation and as we looked at that as god prohibited adam from partaking of the fruit that was a boundary of protection for the man and the woman but on the other side to satan that became a barrier to his agenda it became a barrier to him being able to pervert and him to have influence in him to have control so god's boundaries of protection for you are barriers to satan and what may be a boundary to you can be a barrier to somebody else and so that's it they can say we've been using the word paradox a lot but that may be one way that what god sets for you as a boundary to somebody else's well that's just a barrier i want to be who i want to be i want to do what i want but satan made the woman to see what was god's boundary of protection she saw it as a barrier and so when you see a barrier you try to get around it try to get over it try to figure out why it's there this is trying to keep me from something the barrier is placed there is trying to impede my progress so i'm going to push through it i'm going to jump over i'm a tunnel under it and so the woman saw something as a barrier so she went past it but what it was was actually a boundary and where we were ending on sunday i believe it was on sunday last sunday is satan wants us to see god's word as a barrier not that we would say oh that's god's word it's a barrier but to see something that is the word of god but yet begin to pervert it to where you say it no this is a barrier this is bondage this is limiting this is controlling so he wants to see the word of god and he wants to make it to look like bondage something that's limiting something that's a binding or restraining and we acknowledge that god's word has been perverted by man has been unrighteously used to bind people it has been used to abuse and has been used in ungodly ways that usually happens on a wednesday not a sunday so we're making progress the devils aren't stirred up early in the week but we know that the word has been used in ungodly ways if i need to i can switch it's fine i'll just switch to a handheld that'll restrain me this will be binding this will be limiting but i won't let it be a barrier to the word coming forward i'm not nervous if you are you need to relax this is not bothering me one bit uh it was the worst things that can happen when you're standing in front of a group of people and so we again we know that the word of god has been unrighteously used it has been used uh there's been bully pulpits there's been clubs that have been used quotes that are used uh the message of the hour used to restrain to bind and to marginalize people and to hinder and to limit but that is a misrepresentation of truth that's man taking truth and using it to bind people to himself for his own personality his own gain and there's a lot of cults of personalities that have risen up in the message but the true message is liberating the truth is freedom the truth that sets a person free or really brings them to themselves and so when we look at the word of god and we and i say this because there's this idea of living free and having rights and exercising uh who you are and just following what's in your heart and the freedoms and liberties that are espoused these days and how we want everyone to have rights and equal access to certain things and that's wonderful in a political sphere that may be wonderful in a social sphere but when it comes to the word of god we begin to look at it and say well the word of god says this that's a boundary it says this that's a boundary men ought to be this way that's a boundary marriage is this way that's a boundary women are this way that's a boundary but not in the sense of limiting you or restraining you boundaries are not for the purpose of being restrained or bound or limited but it's for the purpose of putting you in position to lose all the power that is within you it is it is important to recognize that if there's a boundary that's set by god it's not there to handcuff you it's there to take the handcuffs off it's there to put you in a position to thrive and so we have power over barriers by recognizing and respecting the boundaries of god's word we're going to have power over satan's barriers not by needling and meddling with his his barriers but by recognizing and respecting the boundaries of god's word and if i could put it this way that's finding your place that's where you're going to be able to overcome every barrier every obstacle every limiting thing is when you just find your place in the word of god and find your satisfaction being within the boundaries that he's established for you and we looked at matthew chapter 13 and how the those in the the country of jesus he said a prophet is not honor without honor saving his own home his own country and he was there in nazareth and the bible says he was unable to do many mighty work because of their unbelief and the nazarenes missed out on those midi mighty works because of the barrier of the flesh of christ the barriers of his family his family history the details about his birth and all those things hindered them and it was called a barrier of unbelief or because of their unbelief and so this is a this is a barrier to them experiencing the supernatural not because jesus all of a sudden walked into a situation he says well my hands are tight i can't do this it was respecting a boundary of god's word that he operates according to faith in the presence of unbelief it wasn't that he the unbelief is greater than god but it's something that god only operates by he operates by faith therefore he limited himself he he respects this boundary and so god had purposely hid himself in the simplicity of christ and here he is standing before him able to do many mighty works but they turned him away they turned away from him as the scripture says because of the flesh that was in front of him but then in john chapter one nathaniel believed christ just through a simple display of discernment through a simple display a small simple act of recognizing something in his life giving him some detail that was very personal and and he believed that you're the messiah and and in that in that moment jesus said because i said i saw you under the fig tree you believe and he says you'll see my greater works why because having this true faith ignited being able to get past the veil to believe this was the messiah he said you're going to see greater things next and the manifestation of god is not always in the fantastic way that we would like it to be as humans it's not always in the extravagant way that we think that it should be since it's divine it's god so the way god manifests himself is not always great in the way that our humans minds imagine it to be it happened in the first coming of christ when they were expecting a warrior king to liberate them from the oppression of the romans but yet it came in the simple carpenter the son of joseph the son of mary one that we know your brothers your sisters are yet with us but yet this is the messiah standing before him and in first kings chapter 19 is as elijah has fled from jezebel and he's hiding in a cave god said go hide yourself i'm going to pass by him and when the lord passed by there was a wind and he and there was an earthquake and there was a fire but god wasn't in any of them he was in the still small voice that gaunt weak he used the hebrew the gaunt weak whisper is where god was and that's what readied elijah that's what got him ready it was the glory of his voice word as brother branham said this is this is where his abiding presence was as something small something weak but that's what caught the prophet's attention that's what motivated him so i'm using that in this kind of throwing these things out there again for us to put him in our view this morning of how the human wants to see something great in order to see god but god hides himself in something simple but that becomes the access to god and if we're always looking for something big and flashy and something to sensitize the flesh then that's going to be a barrier to you entering within the boundaries where god is and to find the blessings that you need and the experience the grace that you need for the time that you're in and so a barrier to missing god's power is not recognizing the boundaries of his promise well i want this and i want that well where is he where's his promise what's his promise for today if you're praying and calling out for god to manifest himself in justification well he's already done that if you're praying and asking god to restore the gifts he's already done that and so there's a way that we could try to worship him by glares of past days and try to worship him in the shadows of other revivals and he but that's not going to bring you into his presence you've got to recognize where god is in his word the boundaries of his promise for the day that you're living in because that's where you're going to find them and so a barrier to not receiving blessings and receiving the benefits and recognizing christ is failing to recognize where god is hiding himself where he's manifesting self where and where his promises are and if i could say this true power is going to be found in the simplicity of the present truth that's where you're going to find true power you're going to find true power by just simply doing the part that he's called you to do it's not in the great big things it's not in the things that we would like it to be there's ways that we want god to vindicate us and to avenge us and wouldn't it be nice if god could just come down as a 900-foot jesus and start wrapping on the heads of all the people that have criticized us and and burning people's homes who who've done bad things to us and we could sit there and taunt them and laugh and and feel avenged but really when you think about it god's going to avenge you just by making you disappear and they're going to think oh yeah those cultist people finally got lost in the white mountains and they ran off and did this and they're just going to think you just disappeared or you were a victim of covet and that's how god's going to choose to avenge you and so sometimes the avenging and the the vindication and the vengeance that they were going to experience isn't always in the way that we would like it to be in the message humble thyself brother brahm says and god can only operate as we let him operate there's the permission there's the boundary you mean god can't just do whatever he wants to whenever he wants well he can but he won't because he's waiting he's waiting for us to let him to give him permission to allow him as paul said this will we do if god will permit that means god has to allow god has to grant something we can't just do it unless god allows it but then also on the other hand there's things that god is waiting for us to do for us to do our part he says you know people want power and really they don't know what power is they don't really know what goes with it the way up is down always there's your paradox if you want power see how humble you can get just get away from your worldly thinking and humble yourself before god and then you've got more power than the man that runs all over the building and makes a big lot of noise let's be honest with ourselves that's contrary to our our immediate way of thinking that what makes a powerful preacher is how loud his voice is and and the anointing is based upon the amount of sweat that's dripping off the end of his tie and a lot of times it's volume and it's charisma and it's it's the it's the exercising of the body he says but get yourself humble before god humble your thinking then you have more power than a man that can run all over the building and make a lot of noise this is changing our view of things changing the way we think about what makes something dynamic what makes something powerful because you've been able to conquer yourself and commit yourself to christ you see to humble yourself before him that's really power he says you show me a church that's humble real humble not an arrogancy a church just a sweet humble church i'll show you a church that has the favor and power of god in it not an arrogant church not a boastful church not a a boisterous church but a church that's just humble he says real humble sweet humble church that's a church that has favor and power the power of god in it so there might be a way that we want to see an expression of god that kind of gets in our face and is real bold and real brash and maybe obvious to us but it says god is dwelling in the sweetness this meekness and this humility and that's a church that god favors and that's where you'll find the power of god i don't want to have a church for myself personally i wouldn't want to go to a church that just makes me tired after i've been in service because i've exercised so much i want to have a church that even though it might seem to be very even and everyone very reserved and just sweet and humble but it gives me power to overcome on tuesday gives me power to wake up on a monday morning and despite melancholy and a cloud of depression around me you say you know what god is with me we can do this we can handle this and not be like oh well i wish i was in church again i want something that i can feed on that's going to strengthen me he says that's where a church that is humble not arrogant humble sweet that's the church that has the favor and power of god and he said that's right that's the thing that takes humility humbling ourselves before god letting god just work through us so here's again a letting allowing giving god permission letting god just work through us don't have to make a lot of noise and all the quiet people said oh you said amen you're supposed to nod your head all the introverts are like we like that that's good but now you're coming out see the power of god is already working you don't have to make a lot of noise and don't we measure ourselves sometimes by the person always praises and the one that always worships the one that always seems to be so unrestrained and we start comparing ourselves i wish i could shout like that sister well you don't have to what you really want is to be humble and you want to have the power not just the letting out of the steam that's one of the things brother bam identified where there's always this outburst and the the church is just blowing off its steam and it's not channeling it to really get themselves down the tracks now if you'll turn in your bibles to romans chapter 12 verses 1 to 6. in romans chapter 12 verses 1 to 6 i want to read through this and hopefully be able to identify some things as we read through it but i'm wanting just to introduce it into the record because there's such a such powerful things contained in this and this has been real part of my inspiration on this subject says i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that ye present your bodies this is something you're presenting this is consent you're presenting it this is something that you god is acknowledging that you it is in your power and your control now to offer yourself to be willing to give yourself present your body is a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world the world wants to conform us and mold us into a temporary image it wants to force us into something and restrict us into what if i could say boundaries of the word or the world and it wants to bind us and control us what we're doing is we're allowing barriers to force us into a particular expression it's good for us to take a step back and realize that through the availability of data and information and being connected to people and hearing their anecdotal stories and this information and that experience that more and more things are becoming a problem in people's lives not because it's part of their nature and not because it's part of who they are but they're being informed by other things and it's influencing them to want to be things and to express themselves in certain ways and these things would not be so had the information not been spread and when we recognize that there is a conforming of the world but yet there is also a transforming by the word but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove now think about that that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god so you're going to prove this this is something that you are a part of for i say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you this is what he says not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think so you're to present your bodies as a living sacrifice holy and acceptable under god it's your reasonable service you're to be transformed not conformed your minds to be renewed you're going to prove what is the perfect will of god but don't think of yourself more highly than you ought to think but to think soberly according as god hath dealt to every man the measure of faith now do you catch what he just said don't think of yourself more than you ought to but think of yourself up to the measure that you ought to think soberly according as god hath dealt to every man the measure of faith for as we have many members in one body and all members have not the same office so we being many are one body in christ and everyone remembers one of another and then this is what we used in talking about practice having then gifts different according to the grace that is given to us what does he say use them be exercising wait on them in other words be active in them be using them and therefore we have gifts differing according to the grace according to what the the great the measure that god had dealt to every man so i want you again just to look at these verses don't think of yourself more than you ought to but think of yourself according to the measure of faith that god has dealt you because we're all part of the body and not all of us have the same measure not all of us have the same office not all of us have the same gifts therefore we all should not think of more than we ought to but we ought to think of ourselves according to the measure of faith given us now this is where i want to talk about the pride paradox and start emphasizing this a little bit more we must lose our pride in order to take our place in the body because paul says don't think of yourself more than you ought to so he's addressing this carnal humanistic pride want to put yourself forward you want to be the one that gets the the uh the credit or there's just something about the the self that's wanting to be served so he's saying that we must lose don't think more highly of yourself than you ought to think in order to be a proper member within the body of christ but at the same time we must take pride in the place we hold within the body he says don't don't think of yourself more than you ought to but we ought to take pride in what we are in this way pride is a boundary pride is a barrier it's getting very quiet i can tell that paradox was the appropriate word to use this morning for the subject that i'm speaking on paul's teaching something very striking again this might be where you really need to if you could just focus with me and if i'm not conveying it right i take the blame for it but paul is teaching something very very striking and what he's teaching because there's certain principles that we often look at oh we're all members one of another and and god's given us all a different measure and we're to be transformed not conformed and our bodies are reasonable sacrifice there's some parts of this that are very easy to overlook because what paul is doing is he's bringing a very delicate balance when it comes to pride let me look at it this way there's two types of pride there's a pride that we're all very familiar with that we find is most often preached against or preached about and that would be a pride that is a weakness so that's the one pride we're very familiar with it's a weakness but there's another pride that is a strength i ref mentioned it here recently called it a perfect pride and that seems like a paradox how could you have a perfect pride but in psalms 139 verses 21 and 22 i think i just noticed a typo there it's not verse 22 to 22. it's 21-22 and i type these up by hand sometimes so that's where the mistakes come in it says do not i hate them o lord that hate thee and am not i grieved with those that rise up against thee so he this is he's justifying himself right hey i hate those that hate you we're good right he says i'm not am i not greed by those who are offensive and don't believe in your word he says i hate them with perfect hatred i count them mine enemies and so this phrase perfect hatred seems to be um i realize it's maybe in itself a paradox to have a perfect hatred because we would think that hatred is not of god and hatred is bad and hatred is an evil thing but this uh this one is expressing that i hate him with the complete full perfect hatred and why do i hate them because they're against your word and he continues in the next few couple verses to say well search my heart lord examine me and see if there be any wicked way in me so i appreciate the humility of david to express it i believe it's david expressing this to say i hate those that hate you and it's a perfect hatred but lord if that's not correct if that's not right examine me if there be any wicked way in me lord purge it and cleanse it out so in the same way i want to say that there is a a a nasty pride but there could be a perfect pride or a perfect pride or just a bad pride good pride bad pride are the words maybe i'm using or if i could say it this way a godly pride versus a sinful pride the man called it the pride of sin or there's a if there's a sin that's a pride a pride is a sin there's something the bible talks about proverbs the things that god hates and over and over again we see the word of god identifying the nastiness the evilness the corruptness of pride but i want to look at a godly pride sister lorraine shepherd used to always ask me to preach a sermon on godly pride you should preach on godly pride well sister lorraine i'm preaching ungodly praying in second corinthians chapter 11 verse 2 this might help you a little bit if you're stumbling with the idea that there can be a good pride for i am jealous over you with godly jealousy for i have espoused you to one husband that i may present you as a chaste virgin to christ we recognize in the scripture that jealousy is often placed in the context that it's negative it's defiled and it's corrupting it's something that we ought to uh abandon from and be cleansed from and not to have within ourselves but paul uses this idea in a way to say that it is there is a godly jealousy there can be a perfect hatred there can be a godly jealousy there's a way that you could desire something and be zealous for it and want it and crave it and yet it aligns with something godly it aligns with something that's pure and that's what i want you to begin to think about there's a bad pride there is a good pride there's a pride that is excessive baseless without foundation self-view you view yourself baselessly you see yourself in an inflated way it's called conceit it's called arrogance it's the hubristic way there's just it's hubris it's empty it's boasting it's it it's self-serving this is the way that i want you to think about the bad pride we all know that one right but then there's also a pride that is reasonable there's a pride that is a justifiable self-respect there's a there's a pride which is akin to a self-esteem and in this way it's a pride that's very authentic you have the hubris but this is an authentic um idea of oneself and this this idea of pride is always coupled with humility as i've used the example before someone who's dirt poor and has nothing is not necessarily humble they're just broke right and you say well he lives very humbly yeah he's poor trust me if he had the money he would he would let you know and that's that's the difference some people are live humble lives because of poverty and because of their own arrogance and pride and if you gave them a lot of money they're going to be the first ones to let you know see what i got see i'm doing this i'm seeing i'm doing that but somebody who has the goods and has the money or has the power but it isn't always flaunting it and flashing it and showing it off those are the ones that have they have the power they have something to be proud of but it's coupled with humility and those are the ones it's the one who's always you know sticking his chest out and boasting and saying he's going to beat you up he's probably the one that can't but someone says hey man i don't want trouble and he's going to walk away let that guy walk away don't chase him down he can probably whip you because he's got power and he knows he can use it but he's got humility so it's not weakness that caused him to do it it's there's a certain pride in ability and so as paul says that one should not think of themselves more highly than he ought to think so we see we shouldn't think more of ourselves than we ought to but by the same token we should never think less of ourselves if you think well i can't think highly of myself so i'm just gonna think lowly of myself i'm gonna think poor of myself i'm just gonna think i'm a bad person i just think i'm i'm worthless i'm no good that's not what paul is advocating he's saying that we ought not to think of ourselves more highly than we ought to think more highly but by the same token we shouldn't think less than ourselves because he says that we ought to think soberly according to so think according to the measure of faith that he's dealt you so there's something that we think ourselves about is paul is talking about an arrogance or the wrong kind of pride you shouldn't be prideful and both have this empty v boast this vanity thinking of yourself to be more than you actually are he's saying but rather on the other hand think of yourself to the measure that god has blessed you or gifted you or the measure that god thinks of you we ought to think of ourselves and see ourselves as god sees us and that could be a consistent constant prayer lord i want to see myself as you see me i want to think of myself as you think of me and one thing that i pray is god help me to see your people as you see them help me to see this brother and that sister as you see him not as i'm seeing him not as i'm processing it not through my paradigms or through my uh my filter and my offenses or whatever i'm going through and my experiences lord i want to see them as you see them and so this is what we ought to do we ought to see ourselves according to the measure of faith that god has dealt us and any measure of faith should be valued whatever measure it's at it ought to be valued we should any measure of faith should never be devalued or diminished or cast aside but it should be appreciated it should be respected it should be promoted so god's given you a measure of faith and you ought to you ought to if i could put it as i take pride in it in galatians chapter 6 verses 1 to 10 follow me as we read through this brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault you which are spiritual restore such a one and the spirit of meekness considering thyself lest thou also be tempted i know a lot of us have been in situations before where we were we were accused of false or maybe we were overtaken in a fault but no one ever restored us why because they have to be spiritual and they have to do it in the spirit of meekness so here's one that would recognize one is fallen they're overtaken in a fault deem themselves to be spiritual but yet do it in a spirit of weakness with this humility to realize i could be subject to the same thing but for the grace of god so there's something very interesting about the paul the one that paul's trying to provoke provoke into this restoration you have to be spiritual but you got to do it with meekness thinking of yourselves that you could also be tempted so he says in verse two bear ye one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of christ i'm just gonna keep reading through this and then back up a little bit once we get to verse five for if a man thinks himself to be something when he is nothing he deceiveth himself the phrase could be for if a man thinks himself to be something when he is not that thing uh so he's not saying that uh you have to be you think yourself to be something but you're actually nothing because that means you're nothing and you think yourself to be something then we would i can't we'd put ourselves in position well i can't think myself to be something because we're all nothing so i'm just gonna think i'm all nothing it's not what he's saying when you think yourself to be something but you're not that thing he says he deceives himself that that's the bad pride that's the arrogance that's the empty boast if a man thinks himself to be one thing or something when he is not that thing he deceives himself but let every man prove his own work then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone and not another for every man shall bear his own burden if i can say this barriers and boundaries are about recognizing another's burden according to verse two and your own burden according to verse 5. and that interesting bear ye one another's burdens but then we're told every man shall bear his own burden we might think well that doesn't make sense if every man bears his own then i won't have to bear somebody else's but we've dealt with this before uh it might have been about just about a year ago i think it might have been who is my neighbor where we talked about this when it says bear ye one another's burdens it's a different word that's used in verse five that's used in verse five and it speaks of a heaviness a weight or trouble it conveys the idea of someone's being brought down they're sinking so it says bear ye one another's burdens bear somebody help somebody with a thing that's hindering them help somebody with their barriers help somebody with their obstacle help somebody that's bringing somebody down but when it says barrier every man shall bear his own burden it's in the sense of loading something up placing something on somebody but it speaks of their own obligation like a ship carrying its own weight you fill it up and when you fill up the ship with the weight that it's intended to carry well guess what happens it floats right because it's laiding down that's what it's made for it's a vessel to do it it's speaking about fulfilling your own responsibility what does that talk about boundaries so on one hand you have the barriers that someone is trying to navigate and dealing with or it's a barrier that's bringing somebody down it's just burying one another's burden something that's bringing something down but you've got to carry your own weight you've got to bear your own so paul in verse 2 says bear you one another's burdens conveying a different image and also let every man bear his own burden and paul ties these two together by addressing a bad pride and a good pride he's like how convenient that those are the the what he's doing well that's what i'm preaching about i wanna preach on a good pride this is a good place to use this and examine this he ties these two verses together by looking at this a bad pride and a good pride because he says let every man prove his own work let every man prove his own work let him test his own work examine his own work scrutinize his own work to ultimately approve of his own work let every man prove his own work in other words let him approve of it let him demon worthy so you look at your job and says i'm doing a good job i'm doing a worthy job this is a benefit this is worthy this is awesome this is great this is good let every man test and examine his own work and be like you're doing a good job aaron you're doing a good job that's exactly what he's saying i'm talking to myself you could say it to yourself you're doing a good job brother sir you'll pat yourself on the back look in the mirror i'm doing a good job right that's what he's saying let every man prove his own work so that he can have rejoicing in himself you know the word rejoicing is translated to boast so he can bolsten himself so he can glory in himself do do he says deem your work worthy to boast in its fruits do you approve your own work bring forth good fruits be proud of your job and when you bring forth things that are productive and fruitful you should have rejoice in it and boast in it what is he talking about a good pride he's someone looking at what you're called to do doing what you're supposed to do doing it well and when you're done take a step back and say that's a good job it's a worthy job i've done a good job so you enjoy in doing your part rejoice in doing your job and it's using a word to say boast or glory in yourself this is a good pride all right you're still not quite willing to a man good pride or perfect pride i get some real real energetic amens when i say bad pride i want there to be some real light and free amen to good pride a good pride is when you glory in the right things you trust in the right things you're taking pride in the right things hey hey i'm proud of this message i'm not ashamed of it i'm not ashamed of christ i will boast in christ i will glory in the word of god so there is a there's a good praise there's a good glory there's a good as a good thing good way to think positively and think good of yourself there's a phrase that uh i think it was in um the sister elizabeth's parents home in her home that said uh positive people don't put others down and and i modified it to say uh positive people don't put themselves down either because you can be positive by everybody else and tear yourself down and that's that's not that's not necessarily true humility but when it comes to bad pride because i want you to recognize what paul is saying he's talking about working and bear your own bear your own burden prove your own work so that as you work and you bury your burden by the fruits of your labor you can boast in what you've done and you can be proud of what you've accomplished but on the other hand he says if a man thinks himself to be something when he's nothing he deceiveth himself because a bad pride values immediate pleasure the the sense of self the entitlement those things that it's looking to immediate gratification whereas good pride values the future outcomes it's taking pride in hardware it's taking pride in certain things it values the future outcome and it's a certain sense of worth and value that gives you the ability to delay gratification again think very i'm just want to throw certain things out there and i'm wanting to catch a hold of your spirit because these are very deep principles and i need you to i'm hoping that you're concentrating that when you when you need to be immediately gratified it's pride that's needed to be told pride this need to be lifted up it's the self that's need to be sensitized to made to be feel better about yourself and it's the bad pride that's going to get you in trouble to immediately gratify yourself but when you have the right respect for yourself and pride in yourself and your callings your ability and what god's made you then you're willing to delay gratification for a future benefit and it's related to something within character maybe you'll touch on it here in a moment about this tenacity and resilience so paul continues in verse six let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things uh you could say that relates to saying a man's in service but it's actually saying to communities to give back to give of your resource to to to so too communicate to him that is teaching if there's one that's teaching the word of god you could even use this in the context of tithes and offerings then you want to give back to him you ought to give it's a very beautiful scripture if you're being faithfully taught you're being taught in good things you ought to communicate back and give back so he says continue on that principle be not deceived god is not mocked for whatsoever a man soweth thou shall he also reap principles of labor what you sow what you reap the fruits coming forth he that sowed to his flesh of the flesh reaped corruption but he that sowed to the spirit of the spirit reap life everlasting and let us not be weary in well-doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men regardless of political spectrum right regardless of any spectrum ideology let us do good unto all men you're not going to find a scripture that says if you hate them with the perfect hatred you can do bad things to them let us do good unto all men especially unto them who are of the household of faith such beautiful scriptures i hate to really move beyond uh several of these verses but i want to focus on verse 9 be not weary and faint not don't get exhausted or don't relax don't be discouraged he he's speaking to a characteristic some sort of mindset where i'm willing to endure i i want to keep going on in this don't get exhausted don't relax don't be discouraged paul if i can put this kind of lifting up grit a determination he's somewhat being resilient somebody's gonna say i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm just gonna stick this out because i know it's worth it i'm gonna do good because i know it's the right thing i'm gonna continue in this he's saying don't give up don't quit that's exactly what paul is saying whatever you do don't quit when you're doing good keep doing good because it's worth doing good keep doing good because it's right to do good don't ever get exhausted relax or be weary in doing well because you're going to reap because if you're doing good you're sowing the right things and you're going to reap the right things so you're go you'll finally ultimately get the benefit and the blessing from all the positive labor as long as you don't stop if you don't quit and so this is the this is the uh that's the principle paul's lifting up and he's lifting up perseverance to persevere it means to persist in what one has to undertake and to pursue steadily of course to be persistent which means to continue despite opposition i'm going to keep doing this regardless of the barriers i'm going to keep doing this because i know it's right it's a determination why are you doing it because it's the right thing how do you know it's the right thing it produces the right results well there's all these obstacles it's very very hard but i got to do it this is coming against me one of the best things i'm starting to realize with my own children is i want them to be resilient i want to raise them in a bubble where they always win and everything always goes their way and i'm always intervening for them and always bail them out of trouble i don't mind if they experience pain experience hurt and experience difficulties and things don't go their way i want to be able to teach them that when things don't go their way that they still have to persevere they still have to do the right thing that they become resilient and they don't always quit they don't always give up right boys even if your brother's cheating even if the score is getting out of control you're playing you persevere you stay in it you don't accuse other people of cheating you don't have a bad attitude what that's resilience that's grit it's sticking something out it's getting the job done if you started it's completing it paul is using the very same principle here he's saying hey if you're doing the right thing keep doing it if you're doing the wrong thing stop i said no brilliant you told me to be determined do you tell me to not quit i'm just going to use grit and keep doing the wrong thing no in the right thing so brother banh talks about it and this is where my inspiration was and i mentioned it before i don't know if i mentioned it but god just supernaturally brought the thought humble thyself and perseverance together and such a beautiful picture when we were studying on practice i'm so profound to me i've been studying on these things now for well over a month but in perseverance brother brown says the word perseverance means to be persistent webster says that it's persistent in making a goal trying to do something and being persistent about it you become perseverant trying to do something i says men of all ages who have faith in what they're trying to achieve have been persist perseverant you must have faith in what you were doing so men throughout all history who had faith in what they were trying to achieve were perseverant now think about that trying to accomplish something believing they can do it wanting to do it and then persevering to achieve it so he says you must have faith in what you're doing and the message perseverance that was perseverant this is perseverance and every person on earth or that's ever been on earth that's ever achieved anything though amounted to anything so you're talking about good positive this is good this is great this is something worth bragging about or putting on your resume or writing home about had to be perseverant you've got to be sure first what you got your faith anchored in so this persistence this perseverance to be perseverant or to persevere or to persist he's talking about the confidence any man who's ever accomplished anything if we're going to accomplish anything to achieve anything he says you've got to set a goal say this i believe in other words i want to climb mount everest i believe i can climb out everest if you set a goal to climb a mountain but you don't believe you're gonna climb it you're probably what not gonna climb it right it's just not gonna happen so to persevere to persist requires some level of confidence you see where i'm going with this if you're going to set a goal and you're going to achieve it if you're going to persevere if you're going to persist if there's a mark of perfection whatever it might be that you feel that you ought to be doing or something you're called to do something you desire to do in this mind he says let us not be weary and well-doing and to persevere and to persist in order to do that there has to be some self-esteem in some belief even if it's audacity to do it that you can do it anybody who's ever done something he's saying had to believe that they could do it even despite all the pieces you're going to fall flat on your face you can't do that why are you even trying that's impossible that'll never be restored that'll never work out you could never get that job you can never do this you could never i remember people tell me you're going to start a church in the middle of a pandemic and i'm like yeah i didn't think about that yeah i'm starting a church in the middle of pandemic it's easier to spread seven people out than it is 70. and so that there's all these people saying you can't do it you can't do it you can't do it and there's always these ideas and people but when somebody is if they're ever going to do it they have to believe they despite everyone else's opinion believe that they can do it and guess what some of us might call that he's being arrogant but it's just belief it's confidence it's some self-esteem and what happens when we quit or we give up we lose heart when we despair of the outcome people quit when they think they can't make up the difference in a score right well we can't i can't come back and win anyways but who is it that keeps playing it's the one that says well if they got up by 30 of us in the first half can't we do the same thing to them in the second half like they did it in the first quarter can't we do in the second quarter and that's someone who believes it's always within reach this is something that i can do we lose heart when we think well we can't do it so what there is a doggedness there is a determination there is a tenacity when it comes to faith there's a persistence there's a perseverance if someone's going to persevere and keep doing something on some in some way they actually have to have pride or belief enough that they're going to do it otherwise you're not going to keep doing it why do you keep hitting up against that barrier why do you keep hitting up against that barrier because i can believe i can get through it oh wow you really think you can i believe i can i believe i can get through this and so there has to be some kind of belief it's a good pride it's a healthy way of thinking and there's a there's so many things i'd love to just begin to expound upon in this area because this is something that even you don't even have to go to the word of god to find it the word of god is the first that establishes it and it spawns upon it and blesses it makes it fruitful but then the academics are looking at certain things and identifying human nature and they're realizing that there has to be some level of good pride joined with humility in order for a person to be to accomplish something and they're finding this and i think even the word of god speaks to it that the right kind of praise will encourage the right kind of pride that's why you'll find the word of god encouraging us in certain things in certain ways and admonishing us and lifting us up and it's the whole new testament is you're all a bunch of sinners that need grace right it's not just always saying that remember you're a dirty foul person that christ loves we're not always reminded of that and remember that when you listen to some of the modern christian music today that is solely focused on just how nasty and bad people are feeling at 2 am after they vaped all night right i just feel so broken and i messed up again and but jesus you love behold be tired again and it's this all real dark lyrics and we want to be very we want to come to the point in our lives was like you know what i don't relate to that anymore i i've been rescued from that yeah there was a time in my life when that was the cycle but what are they there's a certain way that they're promoting certain things that kind of fits this paradigm of christ's love that isn't true because christ love can redeem you from that cycle and so there's a way that the word of god encourages us and admonishes us to not always be the broken sinner that jesus like ah again come here who needs a hug no there's a point where he's wanting you to come out of that cycle and lift you up and encourage you and bring to a place of confidence say i'm standing on my own two feet by the grace of god and so there's a right kind of praise that's going to encourage the right kind of pride and this extends even to human relationships to where when you're raising your children praise them for their effort praise them for their hard work praise them for not giving up praising them for persisting in difficult situations when they do something and they said wow that's beautiful you really tried hard you really did you worked on that for a long time they they accomplished a very difficult problem don't say you're smart it's the wrong kind of praise to speak to the wrong kind the wrong pride when you praise the right way good pride is instigated but the wrong praise encourages the wrong pride i found that if you constantly tell your children that they're smart what happens i'll put it in the terminology i'm using today it instigates the bad pride and bad pride is all about self-preservation it's all about self so actually the more you tell a child that they're smart the less they're going to take risk being proved that they're not and a bad pride is always going to feed a fear of failure you think you're being humble because you're afraid you're going to fail no that's the pride that does that you realize it's pride that keeps you from letting somebody else do something for you you think you're just being humble oh no no no no it's your pride you don't want to humble yourself let somebody do something for you you never let anybody ever do anything for you and you think you're being humble it's your own pride think about it somebody i don't know who i'm talking to anybody don't raise a hand you might need to go home today and think about it you it's you we're here today for you the soups are ready come to the oh sometimes we need to take today think about it am i always saying no to someone's willingness to help not because i'm the humble one but because my pride won't let somebody else help me i'm open for help anybody want to help me i'm available it'll induce the wrong kind of instincts and it'll cause people to be reluctant to try they're not going to be gritty they're not going to be resilient they're not saying oh let me try that why because they don't want to do it and fail and be called a klutz or you're no good you're not athletic and you're horrible at this or why why did you fail and listen they've replicated this in studies and it's very very very profound where they're if you praise someone for their intelligence and then ask them if they want to try something harder they'll always say no they say no no no why because they don't want to do it harder and prove that they're not smart they just want to live in that that spot yes i'm smart but you take your kid and they try a very very difficult problem and they get it right you say wow it's amazing how hard you try like you really persevered and you took your time and you put in a lot of effort you want to try something harder you've praised them and now they take pride in their effort and you know what they're willing to try again and you don't induce this well i don't want to look ignorant i don't want to look uh i don't want to look foolish and so there's a way that someone is afraid to act because they don't want to look like they have faith think about it we're talking about spiritual we're not talking about how to raise your kids alone we're talking about things that have a spiritual application all these different ways that we have been pumped up and patted on the back and lifted ourselves up in a negative way have caused us to be more afraid of achieving things in the word of god and have become obstacles to spiritual growth and it's not true humility but god wants to break us out of some of these negative ways of thinking in these negative cycles and to take on the mantle of his righteousness and start to have a positive pride a perfect pride and a good pride that will let us see an obstacle say i can overcome that by the grace of god in mark chapter 10 verse 27 and jesus looking upon them saith with men it is impossible but not with god for with him with god all things are possible this is christ boasting about the boundless god recognizing the limits of man man cannot do the impossible but with god all things are possible why all things are possible with god who is unlimited in this power who is the absolute he's balls and about a boundless god so with god all things are possible because god can do all things but paul says in philippians 4 12 to 13 i know both how to be a based it's very interesting it sounds like a really big boast to brag the humble brag of paul i know how to both to be based and i know how to abound and how to be humble and know how to be fruitful everywhere in all things i'm instructed both to be full and to be hungry both to abound and to suffer need i can do all things through christ with strength as me how many times has anybody here ever quoted this scripture this past week right we're always reminders i can do all things through christ that's strengthening i can do all things to christ that strength which strengthens me we should remind ourselves of that so with man there's limits there's limitations but with god there are none with god all things are possible then paul says i can do all things through christ which strengthens me and he says in the way of touching on paradoxes i know how to be a beast and how to abound and jesus said for whatsoever whosoever exalteth himself shall be a base luke 14 11 and he that humbleth themselves shall be exalted but yet there's this paradox of one who exalts himself and abounds himself and lifts himself up and glorifies himself he's going to be a base but he that humbles himself shall be exalted again it's touching on this self exaltation this empty boast this brag with no basis talk about the person who's always trying to prove something from a place of insecurity trying to make everyone think they've got a lot of money when they're broke trying to make everybody think that they've got a girlfriend when they don't try to make everybody think that they've got a gift when they don't try to make everybody think that they're they're happy and they're secure and they're strong and they're powerful when they're really not the one that's always trying to put themselves forward see me see what i can do see what i can accomplish he's talking about and challenging this notion of the bad kind of pride but then paul says i know how to abound because i can do all things through christ with strengthen me that's a confession that relates to a perfect pride we don't need to just be this impoverished dejected broken uh unable completely uh a mess basket case christians with no self-worth with no value whatsoever there's a there's there are spirits that thrive on the attention it gets when you're sick the attention you get when you're going through something the attention you get when things aren't going your way so some people like that right so oh this is horrible oh this is bad that's why sometimes you can some people i already told them yesterday my life was a part so how are you doing i'm doing great so you got to find somebody else to boohoo on come on eeyore well i really want to finish this where are we i'm running out of time so let's go back to romans chapter 12 in our minds not to think more highly than you ought to of yourself but to think soberly according to the measure of faith that god has dealt to every man don't think more highly or inappropriately of yourself but think of yourself within your measure and when paul's using the phrase measure in here the measure of faith and the different gifts met the different measures he's referred to it literally means the determined extent or portion the determined limit what is he defining a boundary think of yourself within your boundaries think of yourself within your abilities any thought that puts you outside of those boundaries is a barrier to meeting the potential that god wants you to have within it when you think of yourself to be more than you are or more something when you're not that something you deceive yourself be careful the one who thinks he standeth lest he fall there's this this self-deception oh i'm this i'm bad and it's this bulls this is emptiness but he's saying there is a measure if you think beyond that measure you're going to fail but if you think within that measure that's where you're going to reap positive things second corinthians chapter 10 i'm going to read verses 12 to 18. i've got to go fast now and we'll record it in like the half speed for we dare not make ourselves of the number or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves but they measuring themselves by themselves and comparing themselves among themselves are not wise they're using somebody else as their measuring line they're using somebody else's extent or limit to recognize their own as kind of like in a negotiation where you don't ever want to counter offer until the other person kind of gives their offer or you kind of wait you want to see where they're at well i can do that job for what's your budget right you want them to kind of set the limit to find out where your limits are going to be he said we ought to not measure ourselves by others but we will not boast of things without our measure but we will boast according to the measure of the rule which god has distributed to us a measure to reach even unto you now i know i inserted that in there but that's exactly what paul is saying but we will not bolster things without our measure but according to the measure of the rule which god has distributed us a measure to reach even unto you do you realize he's saying i won't boast beyond measure but i'll boast within my measure for we stretch out ourselves beyond our measure as though we reach not unto you for we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure as though we reached not unto you for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of christ not bolster things without our measure that is of another man's labors but having hope this is a confidence when your faith is increased that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly this is this is a brag too to preach the gospel in the regions beyond you and not to boast in another man's line of things made ready to our hand but he that glorieth lent him glory in the lord so you can glory but glory in the lord for not he that commendeth himself is approved but whom the lord commendeth the word commanded there means placed together combined is to establish it speaks of a composition or combination so you realize there's some godly combination that i'm boasting in i'm not commending myself i'm not approved because i'm commending myself but the lord has done this the lord has combined this the lord has arranged this and paul talks about rule you're talking about measure rule uses the rule and the line this word rule and line are the same word it means a defined boundary or fixed space within the limits of one's power or influence to which it's confined paul's saying i'm given boundaries i'm giving borders i have a fixed space within which are within the limits in which my power is confined and i will boast and glory in this measure that god has given me and i won't go beyond that he says i won't go beyond another man's line of things it speaks of a place where one is a one sphere of activity the province assigned to a person he says i've been given a job you've been given a job i'll respect the boundaries between our job i won't boast in glory in your work i will boast in glory in mind and i won't cross into another man's boundary paul has respect for another man's boundary that's humility to respect another man's boundary to respect another man's work and to even commend him for that work but he also took pride in his own and wasn't going to devalue his work based upon the work that somebody else was doing said oh my isn't there is wonderful i really wish i could have that work no he says i've got mine to do and i'll glory in my work you've got yours to do you glory and yours and i won't interfere with yours because what he said those that measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves among themselves are not wise i was studying the phrase i've studied it before it was brought back to my remembrance this measuring themselves by themselves you have to know who you are by knowing your boundaries and what god's called you to be and your boundaries are your own they're not set by others we're not establishing what we're comfortable with by first finding out what you're comfortable with well how far can i push it how far will you let me go or how far are you going to push me when will you stop and then once the stop they stop pushing you set your boundary no you don't measure who you are by somebody else's measure you don't do it you measure yourself according to the line or the rule that god has given you paul had respect for these boundaries and then he's recognizing that other people measure themselves by themselves they're comparing themselves they're using what limit this person goes to to set their limits or how far this person will go to withdraw their boundary and if you're always comparing your work and worst of all your worth by another man's worth or another man's work you're always going to fail even if you're finding the person who's worth the least and does the worst job if you're always comparing yourself by somebody else's work or worth you're always worse off even if you chose someone you compared yourself with to make yourself feel better well you see how that person raises their kids makes me feel better about mine you see how much that person goes to church makes me feel good about how much i go you say you remember you see how much that person ties or how much person that person gives and what this person does and that person does even if you come out on top in that competition you always fail all right you might as well just admit it we we are losing whenever we do that and so it's not by you can't you cannot gain the confidence that christ wants you to have by comparison by looking at what other people are doing and whether or not they do it well because if we do that maybe we we have the kind of heart where we're not comparing ourselves to people who do worse than us we're always comparing ourselves to people who do better than us and again you do that and you will fail not because they are better but you're using the wrong measuring stick you're going beyond the measure you're not even recognizing what your boundaries are and what god's called you to do your value your worth who you are is measured by the boundaries that god has placed in your life and you it's a matter of respecting who god made you and not trying to be somebody else and then also respecting what god has made others do you realize you might be diligent in certain things gifted in certain things and have certain be thoughtful in certain things and you're always trying to pull other people into your way of seeing things and well they don't do this and they don't do that do what you're supposed to do and stop judging them by what you're supposed to do they may not be called to that they may not be gifted that way that's the pride paradox pride's both the boundary and the barrier pride is only destructive when it goes beyond its proper boundaries the bad pride that we're talking about exist only outside the borders of truth if you're a good cook and you think you're a good cook that's not a bad pride if you are a good cook right it exists within the boundaries of truth and justification bad pride is impulsive it's self-protective it only seeks to promote the self pride in the sense of self-exaltation in the sense of self-sufficiency is wrong right but think about a pride in the sense of our sufficiency in christ i can do all things through christ that's not wrong but that kind of pride is necessary bad pride will ignore another person's boundaries or disrespect another person's boundaries and maybe worst of all ignore your own it's a lack of good pride that keeps us from setting boundaries it's a lack of good pride that keeps us from enforcing our proper boundaries are you thinking about that i think maybe i'm ending on a lot for you to ponder and think about but if you have the wrong kind of pride you won't respect other people's boundaries because you have some sense of entitlement you feel like you have the right the audacity sometimes for people to ask the questions they ask right like well i'm just thinking about myself i'm going back think about the things i thought i had a right to know in the way i treated people what was it pride they don't owe you that information they're not accountable to you so then why do you make it your concern it's pride that does it a sense of entitlement you owe this to me and so it's that bad pride that'll cause us to disrespect another person's boundaries but then there's this negative side to that bad pride to where also you if you could be burdened in such a way where the wrong kind of pride keeps you from establishing and recognizing your own or ignores your own but if we can have the right kind of pride we'll know to set the boundary and we'll know how to respect them we know how to overcome barriers because with the bad pride you'll push beyond boundaries i wanted to use it as an example i guess i will now try maybe trying to hold whether or not we'll pick this up on wednesday night but when the king wanted to offer burn incense he was met with the word of god and the men of god established a boundary and his pride caused him to push right past it musicians if he could come we'll close i still want to read a couple of quotations that i had i'd like to end with in the message makaya the prophet and this might seem to be a step out of our subject matter but to me it just fits right on top of this so perfectly it says you know the other night i said that christ is a glow not a glare we will never be able to convert the world by trying to shine up our churches and make them bigger and polish up our ministers with better education they already got all that stuff they got all kinds of psychology and ball games and everything the world's got that but we got something they haven't got that's christ i like that boast i like that we got something they ain't got he says it's christ that's right just stay in your own territory that's the part that spoke to me stay in your own territory a territory is marked by borders territory has defined boundaries the territory's something that's identifiable by certain structures and certain things that kind of place you within these parameters that's your territory that's your spot that's your lane just stay in your own territory it's yours it's only yours it's nobody else's take pride in it use it enjoy it get out of it what is meant for you in that he says we got christ they don't have christ they got all the psychology don't try to match with wits you can't do it they can outmatch you you go to a catholic priest one time and try to outmatch him with wits he's got 600 books just as sacred as this bible he's got to learn so brother don't ev don't never try to match him with wits i will tell you that but if you'll just stay with the holy spirit he will do the rest of it if you stay with that but we're not supposed to match wits we're supposed to have christ that's what we have we've got something that they haven't got now that puts it maybe in a real boastful place to say well the denominations the organizations these people they have their pump they have their big churches they have their ball games they have their programs they have their their coffee bars or whatever it might be to to draw the crowds uh even brother john was telling me that this one church they they have the screens on in the foyer to the football games so the fathers don't miss anything and you know i guess our church is no different we got the football game on in the restaurant that this church has some people enjoyed our rooms last night we appreciate you staying here at the church but they do it to get the fathers involved they get it to get people to come now listen we will i said if we even tried to compete with that in order to grow the church you'll never grow you'll just swell you're just bloat but if we stay in the word of god and and stay in our territory and not try to compete with what other churches have and what other churches are doing and even if we're making personal decisions about where god wants us to be and about what matters and we make a decision based upon what the word of god says and not the amenities and the attractions of the world then that's where we'll be blessed and he says the holy spirit will do the rest if you just stay with the word and the holy spirit and he says because even though it may look like it you've got something the rest of them don't have that means we can take pride in the fact that we have the word of god it is ours and with that kind of pride coupled with humility that's what i want the world to find is the christ that i have not the coffee bar not the not the music not the youth group not the singing not the amenities but i want them to know christ [Music] but you got to stay in your own territory and then in thinking about comparison brother man i'm in the sermon doors and door this is february 6 1965 preached in flagstaff he says when mrs amy simple mcpherson when she was here on earth in her ministry they say that pretty near every woman preacher wore those wings like you know or gowns like that impact the bible comparison emulation impersonation wanting to be like that sets the standard that's what i want to be like just look at billy graham that the billy grahams is in the land today and even all the other ones he talked about the other ones that try to mimic him personally says billy graham could never take your place i couldn't take billy his place he couldn't take mine i can't take yours you can't take mine shame on all those people that try to take his place but shame on all those people trying to make him take mine right he can't take your place i can't take yours and you can't take mine you're an individual in god god made you the way you are for some purpose why am i this way for some purpose if we would just find our place then abide there if we try to do something different than see we're in somebody else's territory which we just gum up the picture of god you see the point he's trying to make you've got to stay in your place you've got to be in your lane what's going to cause us to veer out of where our place is when we begin to compare ourselves to somebody else's place if you're the middle toe don't start looking at the big toe i want to be a big toe no you can that's going to that's going to cause problems you got to stay where you are and be proud of who you are every member in the body of christ has been dealt a measure a boundary a limit of faith and there is a value and a purpose in it that cannot be described as even greater or more necessary than any other part and so you have to take pride in the measure that god has given you have to value it and once you realize that i have been made this way for a purpose then it begins to cultivate inside of you the right kind of attitude and mindset to where you'll be willing to what persevere willing to be determined because you have some level of confidence you have the audacity of hope you have this belief that you can do it i can do all things through christ jesus which gives me strength you've changed your mindset from being this downtrodden broken not where you need to be not sure you're even called don't have the same gifts as everyone else just saying i am what i am by the grace of god and no one can take my place and i'm going to take pride in who god has made me to be the world is trying to make people be proud and what they're not [Music] we ought to take pride in who we are otherwise he says you get into somebody else's territory the wrong kind of pride causes us to go right beyond [Music] right beyond where we ought to be into someone else's lane he says you gum it up the whole program of god the whole plan of god the whole picture of god starts getting murky and muddled up because now you're imposing into someone else's area and you're moving over into this area and everyone's just bouncing off of each other and no one's just staying in their place that's what that bad pride will do but you know it's the lack of good pride that's going to keep you from standing up taking your place and all the barriers and obstacles that try to hinder you and hold you back he says we take like billy graham in the denominational world today we could call it maybe the football player he's got the ball now if you try to take the ball away from your own man you're just messing up your team right right take the ball away from somebody else you're just messing up your own team guard your man all right you've got a blocking assignment keep guarding him keep the rest of them so he can make the run he says and we'll have a touchdown after a while okay there you go there's some of you there's some of your husbands go and we'll have a touchdown after a while and jesus will come and it'll all be over how as long as the person who's got the balls running and the people are supposed to block are blocking everyone has to do their part even if you have to run a route every single time knowing that the ball's not going to be thrown your way you've got to do your part even if you know you're alignment and they're never going to call your number and you're never going to be an eligible receiver and you're never going to score a touchdown and your name is never going to get called just keep doing what you're supposed to do and do it right your number will never get called right be no flag on the play and it's an image that maybe we relate to i'm glad brother branham uses it i didn't just pick it out because we're in the football playoffs but it's perfect when he says you've got to stay in your territory he says we keep getting into someone else's territory and the whole thing falls apart take pride in what god has made you to be the paradox the pride paradox i think i just need to continue on it more later let's stand [Music] thank you so much for how attentive you've been how patient you've been i trust that what you've received and heard has encouraged you and spoke to you let's bow our heads [Music] our gracious heavenly father [Music] lord i'm laying out a lot of material today a lot of principles a lot of different thoughts a lot of different tracks that my heart is running on [Music] and lord if i could just summarize in prayer to you as my voice is going out over your people that are here today [Music] we never want to be arrogant lord we never want to have a vanity or an empty boast we never want to brag from a place of insecurity we never want to put on a front from a place of emptiness but lord we would never want to have a testimony that profaned your name we would never want to have a confession that speaks contrary to your word and lord as we're admonished in the bible that when a man thinks himself to be something when he's not that thing he deceives himself so lord we do not want to be deceived and as the same writer tells us that we ought not to think of ourselves more highly than we should lord we don't want to do that but the same writer says that we ought to think of ourselves in light of the measure of faith that you've given us lord help us all to see that measure as priceless help us all today to see that that measure of faith though it may not be the full measure it takes my measure to achieve a full measure though it may not be the fullness of the godhead in my person yet in the measure is all of god all that you are all your potential and all your ability so lord the same writer the same inspiration the one you were inspired to place these boundaries of pride that we ought not to follow these barriers of pride that we not ought to fall into lord he also tried to raise us up to possess the the extent and the range of the gifts that you've placed inside of us and he says i will not boast in another man's rule but i will boast in my own i will not boast in in the measure of somebody else's work but i will boast in my own i will not go beyond into another man's labor but i will stay faithful in my own and we're taught that we ought to have some sort of determination and confidence that we're doing the right thing and some belief in conviction that in doing the right thing will receive the right kind of benefit and lord if we use pride in a negative sense i pray you've given me a grace today to use it in a positive sense that there must be some pride in what we're doing what we're trying to achieve in order to be determined in it if i'm going to keep practicing and keep practicing and keep practicing it's because i believe that practice makes perfect i believe that practice makes permanent i believe that doing practicing the right way is going to produce the right results and therefore i'm not practicing because i can't i'm not practicing because i'm weak i'm not practicing until i'm trying to make myself a christian i'm doing it because i am a christian and i do believe that through me you will be expressed and you will be made manifest and lord i pray that you tear down and wash away from us and break any of these negative cycles that have existed in our thinking lord as brother ernie used to always say get away from my stinking thinking to where we stop thinking negatively we stop thinking of ourselves less than we ought to but oh lord value the gift you've placed in a heart value the eternal life value the predestinated seed lord i you've stripped away family pride you've stripped away state pride you've stripped away national pride i trust that is what you're doing in our lives we have no more pride in our last name we have no more pride in the state of our birth we have no more pride in this great country of america but we start taking our pride from the word of god i'm proud to be a christian i'm proud to be a message believer i'm proud to be a holy spirit-filled son of god i'm proud to be an elect daughter of god i'll take my place stay in my territory be who he wants me to be and help us all to be loose from all the barriers that bind us and push us down and tell us we're nothing and try to marginalize us and try to strip us of our power and access to jesus christ and lord lord may we rise up as a mighty army and possess our territory come back to our territory be what you've called us to be in the name of the lord jesus christ we ask these things amen amen
