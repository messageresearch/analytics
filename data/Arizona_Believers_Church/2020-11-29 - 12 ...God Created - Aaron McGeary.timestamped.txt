[0:00] Romans chapter 8. I'd like to read
[0:02] Romans chapter 8 verses 17-2.
[0:06] Romans chapter 8
[0:09] and then verse 17
[0:13] to verse 25.
[0:18] And if children then hes of God and
[0:21] joint hes with Christ, if so be that we
[0:24] suffer with him, that we may al be also
[0:27] glorified together. For I reckon that
[0:30] the sufferings of this present time are
[0:32] not worthy to be compared with the glory
[0:34] which shall be revealed in us. For the
[0:37] earnest expectation of the creature
[0:39] waiteth for the manifestation of the
[0:42] sons of God. For the creature was made
[0:44] subject to vanity, not willingly, but by
[0:47] reason of him who hath subjected the
[0:49] same in hope. because the creature
[0:52] itself also shall be delivered from the
[0:54] bondage of corruption into the glorious
[0:57] liberty of the children of God. For we
[1:00] know that the whole creation groanth and
[1:02] travaleth in pain together until now.
[1:05] And not only they, but ourselves also,
[1:06] which have the first fruits of the
[1:08] spirit, even we ourselves grown within
[1:11] ourselves, waiting for the adoption to
[1:13] the redemption of our body. For we are
[1:16] saved by hope, but hope that is seen is
[1:19] not hope. For what doth For what a man
[1:22] seeth, why do he yet hope for? But if we
[1:25] hope for that we see not, then do we
[1:28] with patience wait for it. Amen. You may
[1:31] be seated.
[1:39] As I mentioned, we're continuing on the
[1:41] same subject of God created, which is
[1:44] just a further step in the subject we've
[1:47] been looking at on in the beginning. and
[1:50] taking it from Genesis chapter 1. And
[1:53] over the last few services, we've been
[1:54] trying to take together the first few
[1:57] chapters of the Bible and looking at how
[1:59] they form the basis for understanding
[2:02] God's relationship to man and the plan
[2:04] or the purpose or the program of what he
[2:07] had for creation. So in Genesis chapter
[2:10] 1 2 and 3 and you could even see it in
[2:12] chapter 4 how that God is establishing
[2:14] his relationship to man and then also
[2:17] unfolding what his plan is and he's God
[2:20] is showing patterns and and
[2:21] foreshadowing certain things. And so in
[2:24] the beginning of creation as God created
[2:27] he's foreshadowing what he desires. It's
[2:29] something that he wants to achieve
[2:31] something that he wants to bring to pass
[2:33] through creation. And we we're not just
[2:36] reading it historically. We're not just
[2:37] reading it to understand what God has
[2:39] done, but rather we're wanting to read
[2:41] it to understand the purpose of why God
[2:44] is doing it and what he's trying to
[2:45] accomplish through it. And we looked at
[2:48] last time in Genesis chapter 1 and
[2:50] verses 26 and 27 how go the Bible says,
[2:53] "And God made man in his own image." And
[2:56] so this was the we looked at as the
[2:58] original description of man. He is in
[3:00] the image of God. So his composition is
[3:03] something like unto God. And then it
[3:06] says, "And I'm going to give him
[3:07] dominion." So his dominion over creation
[3:10] and the government over creation was
[3:13] essential to that image that God gave
[3:15] him. I'm going to create man in my image
[3:17] and I'm going to give him dominion. To
[3:19] merely be in some kind of form that God
[3:22] was. If we say, well, God had two arms
[3:24] and he had legs and then you put a man
[3:26] in that form would not express the image
[3:28] of God. He had to give him dominion to
[3:31] bring him to this place of godlikeness.
[3:33] And we know also that he was a spirit
[3:35] first, which God is a spirit. And so man
[3:37] is first a supernatural being. He's a
[3:39] spiritual being. And he's given dominion
[3:41] over all the earth. And that's essential
[3:44] to the image of God. And then in Genesis
[3:47] 1 28, we need to look at this scripture
[3:50] as the blessing. This was a blessing
[3:53] upon Adam. And God blessed them upon
[3:56] Adam and the woman and said unto them.
[3:58] So the blessing is what he says. And
[4:01] when he says this, he's conferring or
[4:04] granting Adam power. He's empowering
[4:06] him. And he said unto them, "Be fruitful
[4:09] and multiply and replenish the earth and
[4:12] subdue it." So this is God giving Adam a
[4:15] divine covenant.
[4:18] And we know according to the message
[4:21] that the the spoken word is the original
[4:24] seed.
[4:24] So this is the original spoken word seed
[4:28] as it relates to man. And he says, "I'm
[4:30] going to create man in my image." And
[4:31] the Bible says, "And in the image of God
[4:33] created he them." Uh, in his likeness he
[4:35] created them. Male and female created he
[4:37] them. And then it's given dominion. And
[4:39] then this is the blessing that is upon
[4:41] them. This is the original spoken word
[4:44] seed as it pertains to humankind,
[4:46] mankind or God's creation of man. He
[4:49] says, "Let the be fruitful, multiply,
[4:53] and replenish the earth and subdue it."
[4:54] This is the original spoken word seed.
[4:58] And this replenish and subdue. Now we
[5:01] see be fruitful and multiply. We see
[5:02] that would relate to the man and also
[5:05] this commission that the woman would
[5:06] have to be fruitful um to have to have
[5:09] seed uh to multiply to become many. But
[5:12] then to replenish the earth and subdue
[5:15] it. This is prophecy. And it being a
[5:17] promise as we know brother Ben Brandom
[5:19] called it an oncoming thing. A promise.
[5:21] This replenish and subdue. And I'm
[5:23] wanting to ponder this more deeply over
[5:25] the next couple services at least.
[5:26] replenish and subdue the earth. This is
[5:29] prophecy which is full of power. This is
[5:32] prophecy which is full of potential.
[5:34] It's a prophecy which is full of promise
[5:36] that once the revelation comes and once
[5:38] it's quickened to them, there's certain
[5:40] things that would come to pass. There's
[5:42] certain things that would take place and
[5:43] it relates to the earth. So whatever is
[5:46] in the earth, whatever is from the
[5:48] earth, whatever relates to the earth,
[5:50] Adam is now given power uh by by the
[5:53] spoken word of God to replenish the
[5:55] earth and subdue the earth. And we look
[5:58] at these things in total to be fruitful
[6:00] and multiply. This was power to
[6:02] reproduce the image of God. The the very
[6:06] saying the blessing upon creation, upon
[6:08] man and woman was the power to produce
[6:11] other sons and daughters of God who had
[6:13] godlikeness.
[6:15] And so some of this is reviewed from
[6:17] last time that it's just kind of
[6:18] necessary to take the next next step.
[6:21] And so this divine power laid within
[6:24] man. It's there by the blessing. It's
[6:26] there inside of him. He has power to
[6:28] impart life. He has he has power uh um
[6:31] to grant things. He has power to do
[6:33] things. He's going to impart life with
[6:35] power by this very saying that's
[6:37] pronounced over him. So this this divine
[6:40] power, this great power existed deep
[6:42] within Adam, but in a way it's dormant.
[6:45] In a way, it's hidden from him or that
[6:47] it's not something he's just out every
[6:48] day exercising these things, but there's
[6:50] a time, there's a season, there's a way
[6:52] that it must be made manifest. And so
[6:54] this these powers that are given to
[6:56] Adam, they had not been fully expressed
[6:59] or they had not been fully developed
[7:01] yet. So on day one, when man is is
[7:05] created and even when he's put into
[7:07] flesh, we don't see man operating fully
[7:09] everything he's commanded to do, there's
[7:11] yet to be a manifestation of it yet
[7:13] because it's in seed form by the spoken
[7:16] word, but it lays deep within him by a
[7:19] promise, by a blessing. Now, to see how
[7:22] that there's a further unfolding to man,
[7:24] we look at the the taking of the woman
[7:26] out of man, and we see here's man who's
[7:28] perfect in his creation. He's in the
[7:30] image of God. He has a godlikeness. But
[7:32] then there's another stage in Genesis
[7:34] chapter 2 where God will actually take
[7:36] the woman from the body and from the
[7:38] spirit and he'll form her out of man. So
[7:42] though man was perfect and it it evolved
[7:44] to this perfect expression, there was
[7:46] things that were in him that needed to
[7:48] be made manifest. So it doesn't take
[7:50] away from its perfection. It just shows
[7:52] that there's something that could be
[7:53] more excellent or more perfect, another
[7:55] unfolding of something. And then we saw
[7:58] how in Genesis chapter 3 that when Adam
[8:02] and the woman had partaken of the tree
[8:05] of life and committed the original sin,
[8:07] God says, "The man has become as one of
[8:10] us." Now, we go back to Genesis 1 and we
[8:14] think, well, he made man in his image
[8:16] and in the likeness of God made he him.
[8:19] Male and female created he them. think,
[8:21] well, he was already in the image of
[8:22] God, but now man developed to something
[8:25] more godlike.
[8:27] Though he was in his image and in his
[8:29] likeness, now there's a closer
[8:30] expression of that image or a
[8:33] manifestation of that image. Adam has it
[8:35] potentially. Adam has these powers deep
[8:37] within him. And now when he acts, it's
[8:40] another expression of that image. And in
[8:43] response to this, he says, 'Oh my man
[8:45] has become more like us or man has
[8:47] become as one of us to know good and
[8:50] evil. He says,"Now lest he" and he says
[8:52] that he just put forth his hand. And
[8:55] notice the ease with which God implies
[8:58] that Adam could just eat of the tree of
[9:00] life. He says, "Lest now he now lest he
[9:02] take also of the tree of life and what?
[9:04] Live forever."
[9:06] He hides him from that tree of life and
[9:08] he drives him from the garden in Eden.
[9:11] So by him by God saying this we're just
[9:14] taking these things not taking them out
[9:16] of context to lose their meaning but
[9:18] looking at them in this way that man is
[9:20] made perfect and then God himself says
[9:23] when man acts he says he's more like us
[9:26] and then he says let's keep him from the
[9:28] tree of life lest he put forth his hand
[9:31] and partake of it and live forever and
[9:33] become even more like us because God
[9:36] cannot die. So there was more
[9:38] development to unfold. There was another
[9:40] expression that wherein he could live
[9:42] forever. He would have a body that would
[9:44] never die. And so we started last week
[9:47] looking at how that all man has sinned
[9:49] and fallen short of the glory of God.
[9:51] And how sometimes when we read that we
[9:53] really can water down the plan of
[9:55] salvation and we look at it from the
[9:56] standpoint that every man's a sinner and
[9:58] and and they don't have praise of God,
[10:00] but rather there's something that speaks
[10:02] even to Adam that Adam fell short of a
[10:04] glory. And there was a glory that he did
[10:07] not attain to. there was a a great power
[10:10] these potentials that laid within him
[10:11] that he he could not yet manifest or
[10:14] that he did not manifest in his life and
[10:17] we could agree to that, right?
[10:19] And so, brother Brandham even says in
[10:23] this driving man out from the garden, he
[10:25] says, "Then man could not get to that
[10:27] tree of life in the garden." He says,
[10:29] "Certainly not. It wasn't time."
[10:33] So taking the Bible and the message
[10:35] together, which is the word of God, we
[10:36] could see that God blocked Adam's way to
[10:40] get to the tree of life, but it wasn't
[10:42] time for him to come to the tree of
[10:44] life. So it's it's somewhat of a paradox
[10:46] sometimes to read how this unfolds and
[10:48] we think, "Oh man, man messed up. Man
[10:50] made a big mistake and God has these
[10:51] contingencies or God knew he would make
[10:53] a big mistake, so he'd have to do this
[10:55] and he would have to do that." But
[10:57] nobody's forcing God's hand and making
[10:59] him do anything.
[11:01] There's things that he wants to express.
[11:02] There's things that he wants to do. So,
[11:04] Adam had divine powers. Adam had things
[11:06] that laid within him. There was things
[11:08] that he had the potential to do, but yet
[11:11] he could not express it or manifest it
[11:13] yet because it wasn't time for it to be
[11:15] manifested.
[11:17] And so, the message fundamental
[11:18] foundation for faith, brother Bam says,
[11:21] Adam was given these great powers. He
[11:23] was a secondary god on earth. He could
[11:24] control nature. He could speak to the
[11:26] the storms. He could do all sorts of
[11:27] things. He was given these great powers
[11:29] and then he had a power to what?
[11:31] Reproduce the image of God. Be fruitful,
[11:34] multiply. This is a power to to
[11:36] reproduce the image of God. And brother
[11:38] R says, but then the power that he was
[11:40] given to make himself is where he fell.
[11:44] That's a very awaity statement.
[11:49] The power that he had to make himself is
[11:52] where he fell. So Adam had a power to
[11:54] reproduce the image of God. And in using
[11:57] that power out of season, using that
[12:00] power in a way that was not in harmony
[12:03] with the word of God, he he did not uh
[12:06] he fell by using that power that way. So
[12:10] because he didn't use it God's way and
[12:12] because he didn't use it in God's time,
[12:14] the potential of that power or what that
[12:16] power stood for to reproduce the image
[12:19] or to make himself, it was never fully
[12:21] reached. He never fully manifested. We
[12:24] say, "Oh, well, he had a son named Abel,
[12:26] but that doesn't fulfill the promise."
[12:28] That did not fulfill the original spoken
[12:30] word seed. Now, we asked this question
[12:33] last time. Let's just consider this
[12:34] again today. Could have God been fully
[12:38] expressed if Adam only knew the Garden
[12:40] of Eden?
[12:42] If all Adam ever knew was the Garden of
[12:44] Eden, everything is perfect,
[12:46] everything's working wonderful, would
[12:47] have Adam been able to fully know and
[12:50] fully comprehend God, even though he was
[12:53] father God and he never had a fear and
[12:54] he never had to die and he never had to
[12:56] worry, he never had to doubt. All he had
[12:58] to do is crawl into the arms of Papa
[13:00] God. And it's a beautiful expression and
[13:02] it's something that we think, "Oh my,
[13:03] that would be wonderful. That'd be
[13:04] wonderful." But there's something
[13:06] there's more to God than just being this
[13:09] fatherly figure over a young child.
[13:11] There are things that were part of God.
[13:12] And so God could have never been fully
[13:14] known. Nor could have God been fully
[13:16] expressed if Adam had always stayed
[13:19] within the perfection of the garden.
[13:21] Now you say, "Well, brother, you're just
[13:22] maybe kind of being cute with this and
[13:24] and you're taking some liberty." It
[13:26] really is just scripturally. So
[13:29] it is the way that God intended it. So
[13:33] now that was that's just one one
[13:35] building block again. Now looking at
[13:38] Genesis chapter 2:7,
[13:40] he says, "And the Lord God formed man
[13:45] of the dust of the earth."
[13:49] Now this is different than the creation
[13:53] of the supernatural spirit being. But he
[13:55] says, "And the Lord God formed man of
[13:57] the dust of the ground, that would be
[13:59] the earth, the elements of the earth,
[14:01] and breathed into his nostrils the
[14:03] breath of life, and man became a living
[14:06] soul." Now, he's a little world. He's
[14:08] earth. But then you have a soul from God
[14:10] and a spirit from God. He's earthly and
[14:12] heavenly now in one body. He's a
[14:14] three-fold being, a triune being. God
[14:17] forms man of the dust of the ground,
[14:19] breathes into his nostrils the breath of
[14:21] life, and man becomes a living soul.
[14:24] This is a living creature, something
[14:26] that has breath. So what happens here is
[14:29] God takes the image that he creates in
[14:31] Genesis chapter 1 which is his own image
[14:34] or in his own likeness and he places it
[14:36] in a fleshly body from the earth
[14:38] phrasing as from the dust. And so now
[14:42] once this happens I want to just take a
[14:44] step back and we see a man who is now
[14:46] made from the earth. And if we look
[14:50] backwards at the scripture we see that
[14:51] before Adam was made flesh God had
[14:54] created the substance for sustaining
[14:56] Adam's flesh. said, 'I give you the
[14:58] herbs and I give you the fruit and I
[15:00] give you these these vegetables and
[15:01] things that are going to grow from the
[15:02] earth. He had already given Adam these
[15:04] things before he made the body that
[15:06] would rely upon it. The spiritual being,
[15:09] the supernatural being couldn't even eat
[15:10] it.
[15:11] That's what we understand in in Genesis
[15:13] when God create for creates a body and
[15:16] he steps into it so that he could have
[15:17] that that lamb sandwich a and some goats
[15:20] milk. He he had to have a body to do
[15:22] that.
[15:23] Supernatural being could not have done
[15:24] that. A spiritual being could not have
[15:26] done that. So even before the flesh
[15:28] comes, God in the in the in these days
[15:30] prior to creating Adam in the fifth day,
[15:32] he's creating the things that he would
[15:34] eat from
[15:35] or before that rather. So from the so
[15:38] for man, we see that God's providing for
[15:41] the flesh. God's providing for man. And
[15:44] then also we realize that for man to
[15:46] fulfill the prophecy of Genesis 1:28, he
[15:49] had to take on a body. He could not
[15:53] fulfill the the the commandment of be
[15:56] fruitful, multiply, and replenish the
[15:59] earth and subdue the earth as long as he
[16:01] was just a spiritual being or a a
[16:04] supernatural being. So God had to give
[16:07] him a body. Now once he gives him a body
[16:10] and he breathes breathes the breath of
[16:12] life into him and he becomes a living
[16:13] creature or a living soul, he now has an
[16:16] affinity to living creatures.
[16:20] He has an affinity to the animal life
[16:21] that he's going to rule over as a king,
[16:23] as a governor. And he also has an
[16:25] affinity to the earth that he's to kill.
[16:28] Now, this is beautiful when you think of
[16:30] it this way, and it might just it might
[16:31] click now, and it might click more
[16:33] later. Uh if it really clicks now, you
[16:35] can really just pull me through this a
[16:36] lot faster. But now, he's become kin to
[16:39] the earth
[16:41] as a supernatural being. There's no real
[16:44] relationship to the earth other than he
[16:46] has more relationship to heaven than he
[16:48] does earth. But now when he gives him a
[16:50] body from the earth and breathes the
[16:51] breath of life into him. Now he's a near
[16:54] kinsman. He's akin now to earth.
[16:57] His body came from the earth. He has a
[16:59] relationship to the earth. He has breath
[17:01] just like the animals do. So now there's
[17:02] an affinity and a connection to the
[17:04] creation that he's the god over or that
[17:07] he's the ruler over.
[17:09] And brother Brandham identified this
[17:11] many many many times that when he gave
[17:13] him the body, this earthly body was
[17:15] given to him with senses so that he
[17:17] could contact his earthly home. What
[17:20] were those five senses for? Not to
[17:22] contact God, but to contact his earthly
[17:25] home. These five senses were given to
[17:26] him to fully enjoy and appreciate the
[17:29] garden of perfection. They were given to
[17:31] him so that he could till the ground.
[17:33] They were given to him so that he could
[17:35] uh he could partake of the herbs and
[17:37] partake of the fruit. It was given to
[17:38] him that he might rule over the animal
[17:40] life and have a connection and affinity
[17:42] with them. So the earthly body was given
[17:44] to him to interact with and to govern
[17:46] and to control and fully live within
[17:49] creation
[17:50] to fully live within this garden of Eden
[17:53] or Eden in general.
[17:55] So one of the things that we looked at
[17:57] and that's just you say well that just
[17:58] kind of laying that out there again just
[18:00] refreshing our memory and one of the
[18:02] keys that we wanted to take from that
[18:04] was that God was not just providing for
[18:07] Adam in the garden though it was a
[18:09] perfect Eden. He was giving him these
[18:11] senses to contact his earthly home and
[18:13] it was going to be a strength to him and
[18:14] it was going to help him to govern all
[18:16] creation. God was not just providing for
[18:18] the life in the garden but he equipped
[18:20] him for toil.
[18:22] He equipped him actually for the
[18:24] struggles that were to come. He gave him
[18:26] the the the the title and the gifts and
[18:28] the character to till the ground before
[18:31] he cursed him and said, "For all the
[18:33] days of your life, you're going to have
[18:34] to work from the ground to get your
[18:35] bread." And he'd already given him that
[18:37] ab that ability. He had already put the
[18:40] things in the earth that he would rely
[18:41] on. You can say as a supernatural being
[18:44] he had certain gifts and certain
[18:46] qualities, but once he put them into the
[18:47] flesh that there had to be things that
[18:49] were provided for that flesh.
[18:52] And so God had actually made preparation
[18:55] for the fallen condition by placing
[18:58] everything in the earth already and
[19:01] everything within Adam, these great
[19:03] powers or these great abilities, these
[19:04] great characteristics. Everything was
[19:06] already in the earth and it was already
[19:07] within Adam before he fell. God didn't
[19:10] create something new after the fall. He
[19:12] had already put it in him. And what was
[19:14] one of the points we we we made that if
[19:17] God would do that for Adam, how much
[19:19] more has he done it for us? that he made
[19:22] him that and though it may be hard to
[19:23] say this, he wasn't made to die. He
[19:24] wasn't made to fend for himself. And we
[19:26] see that in one sense, but then in
[19:27] another sense, he was made, he was given
[19:30] the things he would need after the fall.
[19:33] God almost telling him, I made you for
[19:35] this.
[19:36] I made you a tiller of the ground. Now,
[19:37] I'm cursing the earth for your sake. I'm
[19:39] not cursing you. So, you still have the
[19:41] gift and ability to till the ground.
[19:42] It's going to be hard and you're going
[19:44] to sweat and it's going to be sorrowful,
[19:45] but you're going to be able to get bread
[19:46] and it's going to sustain you and your
[19:48] family and you're going to be able to
[19:49] live off the land. And Adam lived a very
[19:51] long life.
[19:54] So though Adam's flesh made way for the
[19:56] fall, we know through the woman, it was
[19:58] his flesh because she came from that
[19:59] flesh. Though it made way for the fall,
[20:02] God carefully thought out Adam's nature.
[20:06] Thought it carefully thought it out. God
[20:08] carefully designed him, carefully
[20:09] constructed him. And so we we we're
[20:13] leaving it at the place
[20:16] where despite what Adam lost, the title
[20:18] deed and the powers that he had, God
[20:22] made Adam knowing the trouble that was
[20:25] to come.
[20:27] He didn't make Adam where he could only
[20:29] exist within a perfect atmosphere and a
[20:31] perfect climate and he could only live
[20:33] as long as everything was perfect and
[20:35] everything obeyed him. But he made him
[20:37] in a way knowing that trouble was coming
[20:39] so that he could exist in that trouble
[20:43] so that God's plan of redemption could
[20:45] unfold. And it was in that that we we we
[20:48] we said that we we ought to rethink
[20:50] God's judgment because we look at
[20:52] Genesis chapter 3 and we say, "Oh my,
[20:53] there's so much judgment. It's so harsh
[20:55] and there's a curse and there's curse
[20:57] and there's curse." And so we look at
[20:58] Genesis 3, we get so focused on the sin
[21:00] and the debate around what the sin was.
[21:02] We get so focused on the curse or the
[21:05] judgments that are contained. The
[21:06] judgment against the woman, the judgment
[21:08] against the serpent, the judgment
[21:09] against the earth, and all the the the
[21:11] banishment that takes place in it. We go
[21:13] so we get so focused on the judgment
[21:15] that we miss God's plan of redemption
[21:17] for creation.
[21:19] Genesis 3:15 is God's plan of redemption
[21:22] for creation. So God is letting his
[21:25] story be told. God wants to tell his
[21:28] story. And my, he's the best storyteller
[21:30] there is. And it's all true.
[21:33] No fable to it, no lie, no
[21:35] embellishment. God is telling his story
[21:37] and he's wanting divine love to be
[21:39] expressed. So he begins in the
[21:41] beginning, God created the heavens and
[21:43] the earth. And he begins to tell his
[21:45] story. And he's wanting you to
[21:47] understand parts of his nature, his
[21:48] desires, the way he responds to the
[21:51] things, the way he acts. And so as this
[21:53] these things we read chapter 1, chapter
[21:55] 2, chapter 3, even chapter 4, what we're
[21:58] reading is not the accident of sin.
[22:02] Boy, Genesis chapter 1, everything's
[22:04] beautiful. Oh, Genesis chapter 2, it
[22:06] ends in this beautiful phrasing. Oh,
[22:08] it's just wonderful. Isn't this great?
[22:09] And then all a sudden, chapter 3
[22:12] and the music changes and it becomes
[22:14] very eerie and foreboating and you're
[22:16] like, uhoh, the scene has changed. And
[22:19] we think now everything that happens
[22:20] from that moment on is the accident of
[22:22] sin. It's not the accident of sin,
[22:25] but it was necessary.
[22:27] As brother Brandham says in Ephesians
[22:29] the church age in chapter 3 of the
[22:31] church age book, thus what God worked
[22:34] out here in the garden. And you know
[22:35] what scripture he's referring to?
[22:37] Genesis chapter 3. Not chapter 1, not
[22:40] chapter 2, chapter 3. And who worked it
[22:43] out? God did. Amen.
[22:45] What God worked out here in the garden
[22:48] was his predestinated plan.
[22:52] So then he says, "And now who who lay
[22:54] who does the blame lay on?" When Satan
[22:56] had brought about that which was
[22:58] necessary to the purpose of God.
[23:01] So what Satan had did in the garden,
[23:04] Satan's over there going, "Yeah, he's
[23:06] dabbing. He's chest bumping. I mean,
[23:09] he's got it. He's got he's doing the
[23:10] championship belt, all his TD
[23:12] celebrations." And what is he doing?
[23:14] He's bragging. But what did he do? All
[23:17] what he did is he he brought that which
[23:19] of was necessary for God's purpose.
[23:23] His dog he's over there celebrating and
[23:25] doesn't realize he's been tricked.
[23:29] Then man could not get to the tree of
[23:31] life in the garden. Certainly not. It
[23:33] wasn't time.
[23:36] It wasn't yet time. So then we see then
[23:39] what God allowed to happen in Genesis
[23:42] chapter 3 is part of his predestinated
[23:45] plan. A plan that he had before creation
[23:47] before Genesis 1:1. Then Satan is used
[23:50] to bring about the plan and and allow
[23:53] things to happen in chapter 3 which was
[23:55] necessary. It had to happen for God's
[23:58] purpose. Then once it happens, brother
[24:00] Ramon says man could not get to the tree
[24:02] of life because it's not time for him to
[24:05] get to the tree of life. So, man may
[24:07] have wanted to get to the tree of life,
[24:09] but God said, "It's not time. There's
[24:10] got to be something happen. There's a I
[24:12] have a plan before man can get there."
[24:14] So, Satan does this in Acts and we
[24:16] think, "Oh, no. This is all an accident
[24:18] until we get back to this." God says,
[24:19] "No, there's got it's got to come a
[24:21] certain way. It has to happen at a
[24:24] certain time." So, Satan just worked out
[24:26] what was necessary for the purpose of
[24:28] God to work with God's timing.
[24:32] Had Adam remained in the Garden of Eden,
[24:35] he could have never known the full
[24:36] mystery of God.
[24:39] And we can say that for all mankind.
[24:41] Had Adam remained in the garden and we
[24:43] all came just the same way Adam, we
[24:45] would have never fully known the mystery
[24:46] of God. We would have known him as God,
[24:48] right? And in a lot of ways, we'd have a
[24:50] lot in common with angels, right? Who
[24:52] just worship him because he is God,
[24:55] because he created them. But we realize
[24:58] there's a difference between us and
[24:59] angels.
[25:02] And I won't even go there. You know what
[25:03] it is. And it's what makes your
[25:05] relationship greater to God than that of
[25:07] the angels.
[25:09] And so God had a plan.
[25:12] Had Adam remained in the garden. Had we
[25:14] all come direct from God as Adam had,
[25:16] the full manifestation of God would have
[25:18] been lost forever.
[25:20] Just imagine God sitting there thinking,
[25:22] "Man, they don't even really know who I
[25:25] am."
[25:27] And yeah, there would have been a
[25:28] perfection and it would have been
[25:29] beautiful and they would have known the
[25:30] love of God, that would have had a an
[25:32] understanding love of God, but there was
[25:33] things about God that would have laid
[25:35] dormant in the image.
[25:39] So, where we stopped last time, you
[25:41] think, "Oh my goodness, 30 minutes and
[25:42] you finally got to where we stopped last
[25:44] time." You're right.
[25:48] God's purpose could not be revealed
[25:50] without redemption.
[25:53] Satan had brought about that which is
[25:54] necessary to the purpose of God. God's
[25:56] purpose could not be revealed without
[25:58] redemption. So his full character could
[26:00] not be expressed unless there was an act
[26:02] of redemption. It's the very essence of
[26:04] his name to be a savior to be a
[26:06] deliverer. There has to be trouble to be
[26:08] delivered from. There has to be
[26:09] something to be rescued out of for him
[26:11] to his full character and for a full
[26:14] revelation of his name and all his
[26:15] redemptive names and all his he had to
[26:18] have scenarios and situations for him to
[26:20] be able to manifest himself so that you
[26:22] could know his character.
[26:24] Yes. And so we phrased it this way. His
[26:26] need to be a redeemer is at the center
[26:29] of God's character.
[26:31] God has a desire. He desires to be a
[26:33] redeemer. We say, "Oh, the heart purpose
[26:35] of God was to have a bride of his own
[26:37] choosing." This is something that was
[26:39] essential to his character. But it was a
[26:42] bride of his own choosing. And in that
[26:44] very phrasing, the very heart and the
[26:46] very center of it was his desire to be a
[26:48] redeemer of that bride.
[26:51] That he wanted to redeem her. and in
[26:52] redeeming her and doing something for
[26:54] her and expressing all those attributes
[26:56] to her. She would love him.
[26:59] If we were all angels, you know, we'd be
[27:01] in this situation. I was programmed this
[27:03] way. I was made this way and I'm just
[27:04] going to serve him and and we don't have
[27:06] any other rel relationship to him other
[27:07] than he's the master. He's the Lord.
[27:09] He's the one that's in power. A and
[27:11] there's this particular dynamic and
[27:13] relationship there. That's not what God
[27:14] wanted. Otherwise, he could have done
[27:16] that in the beginning. Yes,
[27:19] that's not the way that God had unfolded
[27:21] it.
[27:22] So, but it was absolutely necessary to
[27:25] God that this bride of his choosing was
[27:28] the product of redemption.
[27:30] So, not only did he forno
[27:33] of Adam's fall or the fall of mankind,
[27:36] but he arranged all things, God arranged
[27:39] all things according to the plan of
[27:41] redemption.
[27:43] He took took it all and arranged it. And
[27:47] then he seals it up. He seals the
[27:49] understanding of it because God now
[27:52] gives he empowers Adam with certain
[27:54] things. The blessing of Genesis 1:28,
[27:56] it's given to him. And so these
[27:58] blessings are there potentially, but
[27:59] they're hidden. They're dormant. They're
[28:01] sealed from him. And there's this wow at
[28:04] the right time or there's an unfolding.
[28:06] There's a there's a things that'll take
[28:07] place. There's next steps that can
[28:08] unfold. And so these things are there
[28:11] potentially. And we know now it's not
[28:14] just the book, but it was the whole plan
[28:17] of redemption
[28:19] because this was his plan in the
[28:20] beginning.
[28:22] Again, it's not an accident and God had
[28:24] to write another chapter. It's all part
[28:26] of it. So he arranged everything
[28:28] according to the plan of redemption. So
[28:30] when we say that Adam lost the title
[28:33] deed or Adam lost something, what did he
[28:34] lose? He lost the book of redemption.
[28:39] Brother man makes this statement from
[28:40] Genesis to Revelations. A complete plan
[28:42] of redemption is revealed in these seven
[28:44] seals.
[28:46] Now, if you could just take this as kind
[28:48] of surface as stone kind of skipping the
[28:50] surface. We're not going to go very deep
[28:52] on these things. We're just going kind
[28:53] of want to sew these things out there to
[28:55] come back later and pick up.
[28:57] He says that the entire book of the
[29:00] Bible is a complete plan of redemption
[29:02] that's revealed in the seven seals. In
[29:05] the sixth seal, he's talking about the
[29:06] seven seals, talking about them being
[29:08] wound together and scrolled together.
[29:10] says, "And unwinds the whole book of
[29:12] redemption." That's how the whole earth
[29:15] was redeemed. That's the reason John
[29:17] wept because if no one could get that
[29:20] book, all creation, everything was gone.
[29:23] So, there's something that's holding
[29:25] creation together.
[29:27] And it's the book of redemption.
[29:30] The title deed holds the book, holds the
[29:33] earth together. The whole earth is
[29:34] redeemed in that book. John weeps
[29:36] because if no one would get to that
[29:37] book, all creation, everything was gone.
[29:39] He said, "She just simply turned back to
[29:41] atoms and molecules and so forth and
[29:43] cosmic light and not even be creation
[29:45] person, nothing else. Could Adam because
[29:47] Adam lost the rights of that book." So
[29:51] when God creates Adam, if we could just
[29:53] imagine it and we do it in a literal
[29:56] sense and sometimes we take symbolic
[29:57] language in the Bible and we think that
[29:59] Adam literally had a book like on loan
[30:02] from God's library and he lost it so was
[30:04] a late fee and he's being charged every
[30:06] day. But there's just something that had
[30:08] been given, a blessing that had been
[30:09] given to Adam. And whenever he whenever
[30:12] he steps outside of God's order, and the
[30:15] divine order is interrupted, he can no
[30:17] longer use it.
[30:20] And he's symbolically sealed off from it
[30:23] whenever God drives him out of the
[30:25] garden of Eden and he blocks his way to
[30:26] the tree of life. And brother says he
[30:28] lost that. He lost that book and his
[30:31] rights to that book. And if this book is
[30:33] never redeemed, it's as if something has
[30:35] been bound into creation that unless
[30:37] that book comes back to its comes back
[30:40] to a particular place into a particular
[30:42] ownership, then eventually earth just
[30:44] unwinds itself.
[30:46] And you think about it, my goodness,
[30:48] look what man is going to ultimately do
[30:49] to the earth.
[30:53] And it just go back to molecules. maybe
[30:56] send shock waves throughout universes
[30:58] that cause things to collide and move
[31:00] and shift and all everything's breaking
[31:02] up and as it all came together one time
[31:05] by the spoken word once this book is
[31:07] lost brother described it in a very
[31:09] vivid way she would just turn back to
[31:11] atoms and molecules and there wouldn't
[31:12] even be a creation no people because
[31:14] Adam lost the rights of that book and
[31:16] unless that book comes back into a
[31:18] position
[31:20] creation is in a state awaiting judgment
[31:23] and the question will it all be unwound
[31:25] Will it lose its form? Will it lose its
[31:27] purpose? Brother Brown says, "And souls
[31:30] that are in prison now, and if it had
[31:31] been lost, excuse me, and it had been
[31:34] lost by the human race, Adam, the book
[31:36] now, and it went back where?" Satan
[31:38] couldn't take it. He just caused him to
[31:41] lose it. But where did the book go then?
[31:44] Didn't belong to the human race. And
[31:46] notice he says the blessings didn't
[31:48] belong here. So in it are the blessings.
[31:53] In it is Genesis 1:28.
[31:55] In it is is man's empowerment. In it is
[31:58] man's commission, isn't it? In it is
[32:00] adam and mankind's ability to fully
[32:02] express the image of God and all the
[32:04] power and potential of it. He says the
[32:05] blessings didn't belong here. Here the
[32:07] human race had lost it. So it went right
[32:10] on back to its original owner. That was
[32:12] God. So using a symbolism, we say Adam
[32:16] had it. Adam had it. He walked in the
[32:17] garden. He's using this power. He's
[32:19] using certain powers. He's naming
[32:21] creation. He's naming the animals and
[32:23] beautiful things are happening. He's and
[32:24] they're existing. Every seed bringing
[32:26] forth of its kind. But then Adam steps
[32:28] outside of the divine order in that book
[32:30] that he had is now taken away from him.
[32:33] Now Adam can't operate it. He can't use
[32:36] it that way. There's certain powers that
[32:37] he still has. There's certain gifts that
[32:39] he still has. But he cannot operate and
[32:41] utilize that power. But where does the
[32:43] book go? Satan doesn't take it. Satan
[32:45] wanted it.
[32:47] But when man lost it, what a what what
[32:50] Satan got in the in the hybriding, that
[32:53] power that he received was not the power
[32:55] of Genesis 1:28. The power that he
[32:57] received was it was a hybrid. It was a
[32:59] perverting. He didn't receive the power
[33:02] to create. He only received the power to
[33:04] pervert. And so, um, Cain, excuse me,
[33:06] Satan thought he could get it because it
[33:09] would still be in man, but now he'd have
[33:11] access to it, uh, through the fall, but
[33:13] it went back to God.
[33:15] So now the book of redemption is in the
[33:17] hands of God. And we see this in
[33:18] Revelations 5:1.
[33:20] And I saw on the right hand of him that
[33:22] sat on a throne a book written within
[33:23] and on the backside sealed with seven
[33:25] seals. Now, Brother Brandham even likens
[33:28] this to the Bible. He says the whole
[33:29] Bible speaks of redemption. He he talks
[33:32] about how it speaks of redemption. Maybe
[33:34] those are my words, but it speaks of
[33:35] redemption. It pertains to redemption
[33:38] and creation expresses it. We see it
[33:42] even in seasons and cycles and even the
[33:44] day when and when when God even in the
[33:45] beginning speaks of the the evening and
[33:47] the morning were the first day he's
[33:48] showing redemption showing the cycle. So
[33:51] Genesis chapter 1 uh and two all these
[33:53] things from the very beginning this is
[33:55] God expressing redemption even the first
[33:57] two verses of the Bible in the beginning
[33:59] God created the heaven and the earth and
[34:00] the earth was without form and void and
[34:02] then what the spirit of God moves upon
[34:04] it and brings order it all speaks of
[34:06] redemption
[34:08] and so heth this book that is in his
[34:10] hands it goes back to God and it's
[34:11] sealed with seven seals and brother
[34:13] Brandham in the breach referring to this
[34:15] sealed book in Revelations 5 he said
[34:17] here is the book of redemption here is
[34:19] the plan of redemption ion. Now, it
[34:22] wasn't renamed when Adam lost it. And
[34:25] I'll be honest with you, this is the
[34:27] revelation I just recently had because I
[34:29] found myself even while I was preaching
[34:31] here recently, I called it the book of
[34:32] redemption. I said, "Well, it when it
[34:34] was before the fall, we would have
[34:35] called it the book." But I realize now
[34:37] maybe that was the mysterious name of
[34:39] it, but it was always called the book of
[34:41] redemption. And as if if there was a
[34:43] literal book, Adam would look at and
[34:45] say, "Book of redemption? Redemption?
[34:48] What does redemption even mean? What
[34:50] does he even mean redemption? Because it
[34:52] was always the book of redemption. God
[34:54] didn't change the title that that man
[34:56] has the book. And after the fall, God
[34:58] says, "Okay,
[34:59] of" and he scratches it of redemption,
[35:02] you know, and kind of puts it in there
[35:03] and like tries to make it look just the
[35:05] same as the other. What font did I use?
[35:06] I can't figure this out. Is he It was
[35:09] already written. It was already called
[35:10] the book of redemption.
[35:12] So he says, "Here's the book of
[35:14] redemption. Here's the plan of
[35:15] redemption. Here's the only way you'll
[35:17] ever be redeemed. For here is the title
[35:20] deed to redemption of the whole heavens
[35:23] and earth.
[35:25] So God had already for the heavens and
[35:27] earth and everything that would come out
[35:28] of it. Everything that would be
[35:30] represented by it, everything that would
[35:31] have this affinity and likeness of it.
[35:33] He says this all written in this book,
[35:35] the redemption of it is written in this
[35:37] book.
[35:38] And the message why it had to be
[35:40] shepherds.
[35:44] He says, "Now here, now there he
[35:46] stands." Revelations 5:1 holding his
[35:49] right hand over his heart
[35:52] and and it is even referring to
[35:55] Revelations 10 I believe here he stands
[35:57] holding his right hand over his heart
[35:58] standing like this where the hidden
[36:00] secrets of redemption had been hid since
[36:03] the foundation of the world he goes
[36:04] here's why shepherds
[36:06] I believe the image is Revelations 5 but
[36:08] he described as holding his right hand
[36:10] over his heart
[36:12] why because it's sealed within himself
[36:15] here's the hidden secrets of redemption
[36:16] that have been hid since the foundation
[36:18] of the world. So there was a secret to
[36:20] creation and it was redemption.
[36:22] They wouldn't have even understood it.
[36:24] Just like angels, redemption. What does
[36:28] that even mean? We can't sing a song of
[36:30] redemption.
[36:32] Holy, holy, holy. There's certain things
[36:33] they could sing, but they couldn't sing
[36:34] redemption. And here's creation that man
[36:37] did couldn't sing that. He didn't know
[36:38] that. There was no way it could be
[36:39] expressed. But here he is standing with
[36:41] the hidden secrets of redemption that
[36:42] were in his heart before the foundation
[36:44] of the world. And he says this is why it
[36:46] had to be shepherds. Why? Because it's a
[36:47] lamb
[36:49] that is going to reveal the secrets.
[36:51] It's the lamb that holds the secret.
[36:53] That's why it had to be shepherds. Why?
[36:56] Because here in the beginning that man
[36:58] was given commandment. He was to
[36:59] shepherd animal life. It was man who
[37:01] received the revelation to take that
[37:03] lamb.
[37:04] And could you imagine I I was maybe
[37:06] going to save this for when we go verse
[37:08] by verse through Genesis chapter 2 and
[37:10] three that when Adam received this
[37:12] revelation to take the lamb Adam would
[37:14] have named that lamb
[37:17] wasn't just kind of some stranger some
[37:19] foreigner to him Adam saw these
[37:21] expressions and these images and he
[37:22] would have given a name to it and and
[37:24] maybe the mystery even of the name it
[37:26] unfolds and Adam realizes now I know why
[37:29] I named you
[37:31] I know why you're you were suited a
[37:33] certain way you were characterized a
[37:34] certain way because you had to be a
[37:35] sacrifice. But says here's why it was
[37:37] shepherds. So this book is sealed. It's
[37:40] the book of redemption. It's the plan of
[37:42] redemption for all of creation, for man.
[37:44] And in verse three says, no man in
[37:46] heaven nor in earth, neither under the
[37:47] sun was able to open the book, neither
[37:49] to look thereon.
[37:51] No living soul could do it.
[37:55] What is what is the expression? No man
[37:57] was found worthy.
[38:00] So there was something that had to take
[38:03] place or something had to transpire to
[38:05] give worth in order to be able to take
[38:09] the book. No living soul could do it. No
[38:12] living creature could do it. No man in
[38:14] earth or under the earth was able to
[38:15] take the book. Neither to look thereon.
[38:17] None was found worthy.
[38:20] Now we understand that it's the the lion
[38:22] of the tribe of Judah hath prevailed to
[38:24] take the book and loose the seals
[38:25] thereof. And John turns look and sees a
[38:27] lamb as it as it had been slain. So we
[38:30] know there was one the lamb Christ who
[38:32] was worthy to take the book and loose
[38:34] the seals thereof. So now I want to
[38:36] begin to look at this plan of
[38:38] redemption. Brother Bam takes his plan
[38:39] of redemption. It's what man lost in
[38:41] Genesis. He goes back to the rightful
[38:43] owner in Revelations 5. We see this book
[38:45] of redemption or this plan of redemption
[38:48] coming into the hands of Christ. And I
[38:50] want to look at this now for the
[38:52] remainder of the service that the plan
[38:55] of redemption held a great mystery. If
[38:58] Adam had even understood that what he
[39:00] had was the book of redemption, the
[39:03] mystery of redemption was that there's
[39:04] always a greater glory to come when God
[39:07] redeems.
[39:09] There's something greater with with God.
[39:12] So if there was a plan of redemption, it
[39:15] wasn't it wasn't just going to work it
[39:17] back to what it was.
[39:19] And I'm not just trying to be logical
[39:20] here. I'm just being uh rooted in the
[39:23] scripture. Had God redeemed man back to
[39:27] what he was in the garden, the potential
[39:29] for a fall would always be there, right?
[39:32] Amen.
[39:33] He just merely set him back on the same
[39:35] basis every time.
[39:36] Then it could be it could just be like,
[39:38] man, every time I make a covenant with
[39:40] man, he breaks it.
[39:42] So then, and this will maybe make more
[39:44] sense as we get more looking at the
[39:46] seed. So what kind of covenant does he
[39:47] make with Abraham?
[39:49] unconditional.
[39:51] In what language does he talk about? The
[39:53] stars of the sky, the dust of the earth.
[39:57] In blessing, I will bless thee. Multiply
[40:00] and I'll multiply.
[40:02] What is he speaking of? It's Genesis
[40:05] 1:28.
[40:06] But not to seeds as to many, but the
[40:08] seed which is Christ. And what was he
[40:11] given? He says, I am going to make a
[40:14] covenant with you, Abram. It's an
[40:16] unconditional covenant. I will.
[40:20] Not if you will, I will. I will.
[40:27] If I was a better preacher.
[40:30] So, the mystery of redemption is there's
[40:32] always a greater glory to come. Look at
[40:35] as it unfolds in Revelations 5:es 9 and
[40:38] 10. And they sung a new song. It's not a
[40:41] song that ever been sung before. So
[40:43] redemption wasn't, "Oh, remember
[40:44] remember that song." No, they sing a new
[40:46] song. Thou art worthy to take the book
[40:48] and to open the seals thereof. For thou
[40:50] was slain and hast redeemed us to God by
[40:54] the blood by thy blood out of every
[40:56] kindred, tongue, and people and nation
[40:59] in the earth.
[41:01] And he says, "And hast made us," now
[41:04] there's a making that takes place under
[41:06] our guard, kings and priests.
[41:11] And now they could say, "And we shall
[41:13] reign on the earth." So the very
[41:16] language of these redeemed ones in
[41:18] Revelations 5 connects it to creation
[41:20] out of every kindred, tongue, people,
[41:22] and nation. And it made us under our God
[41:24] and made us kings and priests, and we
[41:25] shall reign upon the earth. It's
[41:27] connected with Genesis chapter 1 and
[41:29] chapter 2. It is redemption of what God
[41:31] was laying out in the first few books of
[41:33] the Bible.
[41:36] He says they sing a new song and then he
[41:39] hath made us. It's another making. God,
[41:42] who had authored the faith finishes it
[41:44] in perfection. What is it? It's
[41:46] something greater. We're not just kings
[41:48] like Adam to govern the earth, but we've
[41:50] been made priests.
[41:54] And Hagi chapter 2:es 3-9.
[41:57] I I want to use this scripture to
[42:00] express
[42:01] how redemption carries with it a promise
[42:04] of something greater.
[42:07] And I'll try to read this quickly and
[42:09] not get slowed down on it too much.
[42:11] Haggi chapter 2:es 3-9. Who is left
[42:14] among you that saw this house in her
[42:16] first glory? Talking about the temple,
[42:18] the tabernacle. Who remembers what it
[42:19] looked like in her first glory? She had
[42:22] a glory. This this house. And how do you
[42:24] see it now? Is it not in your eyes in
[42:26] comparison of it as nothing? Think about
[42:28] creation in its original glory in
[42:31] Genesis 1 and2. Think about it now. He
[42:34] says, ' And how do ye see it now? He
[42:37] says, but verse four, yet now be strong,
[42:38] O Zerubbable, sayith the Lord. And be
[42:40] strong, oh Joshua, son of Jessedc, the
[42:42] high priest. And be strong, all ye
[42:44] people of the land, sayith the Lord, and
[42:46] work, for I am with you, sayeth the Lord
[42:48] of hosts, according to the word that I
[42:51] covenanted with you when you came out of
[42:53] Egypt. The Exodus represents redemption.
[42:57] He's talking about a covenant of
[42:58] redemption, a promise he made of
[43:00] redemption. So my spirit remainth on
[43:02] you, among you. It's a spirit of
[43:04] redemption. Now, as this pertains to
[43:06] Israel in the natural, there's a
[43:07] spiritual type for us. I made a promise
[43:09] with you in the Exodus to come out of.
[43:12] Remember, redemption is two parts. So,
[43:15] my spirit remainth among you. Fear not,
[43:17] for thus sayeth the Lord of hosts, yet
[43:19] once it is a little while, and I will
[43:21] shake the heavens. Paul even brings this
[43:23] into the New Testament. I will shake the
[43:25] heavens and the earth and the sea and
[43:26] the dry land. So now all creation and
[43:29] all the elements that were expressed in
[43:30] in these days of creation are brought
[43:32] before our eyes. And I will shake all
[43:34] nations and the desire of all nations
[43:37] shall come and I will fill this house
[43:39] with glory. Sayeth the Lord of hosts.
[43:42] The silver is mine and the gold is mine.
[43:44] All the elements of the earth, all the
[43:46] precious minerals and metals, sayeth the
[43:48] Lord of hosts. Now the glory of this
[43:50] latter house shall be greater than of
[43:52] the former, sayeth the Lord of hosts.
[43:54] And in this place will I give peace
[43:56] sayaith the Lord of hosts.
[43:59] Now I I need to go quickly in this. So
[44:01] as it says that the who remembers this
[44:05] house in her first glory. The first
[44:07] glory of the temple or house was great
[44:10] but it had been torn down.
[44:12] It left in rubble and ruins and and
[44:14] people mocked her dust and they made fun
[44:16] of her stones. Its glory had been
[44:18] diminished as he says as nothing.
[44:21] And what being what's being expressed in
[44:23] this we could see that this is a figure
[44:25] of our redemption even by bringing in
[44:28] the Exodus and all nations which speaks
[44:30] of the heathen and the Gentiles and
[44:31] they're going to come says and I will
[44:33] fill this house. This speaks of our
[44:35] redemption. It speaks of the very plan
[44:37] of God that was hidden in the beginning.
[44:40] These verses in Hagi though we may not
[44:42] have the time just to walk through it
[44:43] piece by piece. I'm wanting you just to
[44:45] kind of catch on the on the surface that
[44:47] there's a type and there's an image of
[44:49] the very redemption of heavens and
[44:50] earth. I'll shake the heavens and the
[44:52] earth and the sea and the dry land. It
[44:54] brings Revelations 10 into view. It
[44:55] brings that third day into view. It
[44:57] brings everything God created into view.
[44:59] It brings the book of redemption into
[45:01] view. So, it holds an image of even our
[45:03] redemption
[45:05] because God had a hidden purpose in his
[45:06] creation.
[45:08] Something that Adam did not walk into,
[45:10] right?
[45:12] Something that he did not walk into. And
[45:15] I I I say it this way and I hope it's
[45:17] the right way to say it, but by design
[45:20] because it wasn't time. So now this
[45:23] might seem like a little bit of a shift,
[45:24] but we're doing is just taking this and
[45:26] we're just zeroing in. We're just going
[45:27] to focus real tight now for a while.
[45:30] Our bodies are referred to as a house,
[45:34] as a tabernacle or a temple. Even the
[45:38] layout of the tabernacle is like our
[45:40] bodies, an outer court,
[45:44] right?
[45:45] A holy place, holy. And then, but
[45:48] there's still something greater, the
[45:50] holiest of holies.
[45:52] Amen.
[45:53] And we have for us triune being an outer
[45:56] court. We have the body, spirit, and
[45:58] soul. So even the tabernacle is
[45:59] expressed in a way to be representative
[46:01] of man. And even the lights that filled
[46:04] the the tabernacle speaks of lights that
[46:06] men walk in. And there are certain
[46:08] things that we can see a parallel
[46:09] between the houses. Haggi is saying,
[46:11] "Who remembers this house, the temple,
[46:12] the tabernacle in her first glory?" The
[46:14] temple of the tabernacle of the Lord.
[46:16] Who remembers it in the first glory?
[46:17] Now, our bodies are referred to as
[46:19] temples.
[46:22] As tabernacles in 1 Corinthians 69 19,
[46:27] what know ye not that your body is the
[46:29] temple of the Holy Ghost, which is in
[46:30] you, which you have of God? and ye are
[46:32] not your own. So our body is the temple
[46:35] of the Holy Ghost.
[46:37] 2 Corinthians chapter 5:es 1:5. Now
[46:40] really if you could just focus now a and
[46:43] I and I realize that these things are
[46:45] that I can I have a really complicated
[46:47] way of laying it out there. That's why
[46:49] you can you you know it's God when you
[46:51] understand it.
[46:55] So it's by design.
[46:57] And but I believe a minister should make
[46:59] things simple, not make it cloudy.
[47:01] Someone told me one time a a teacher or
[47:03] preacher had preached on the godhead and
[47:05] someone walked out of the service and
[47:07] said, "Well, I don't know if there's
[47:08] three, four or five now, but that was
[47:10] deep."
[47:12] Like, you're swimming in the wrong pool,
[47:14] sister. Should never come out like that.
[47:17] Where when you don't, oh wow, that must
[47:18] have been deep. It was so confusing.
[47:20] Must have been deep. Listen, if I ever
[47:21] confuse you, don't accuse me of being
[47:23] deep.
[47:25] Just say, "Brother Aaron, you just need
[47:26] to pray harder. Get yourself out of the
[47:28] way. There's something there. Keep
[47:29] trying, brother Aaron. We're with you.
[47:30] We're praying for you. Pat me on the
[47:31] back. Encourage me.
[47:33] Rub what little hair I have left. Say,
[47:35] "You can do it, son. You can do it.
[47:36] You're doing a good job." So if I if
[47:38] it's complicated, it's my fault. But now
[47:41] notice how beautiful this is. This
[47:43] symmetry now. And the point we're trying
[47:45] to drive home is the mystery of
[47:46] redemption is that when God redeems, he
[47:49] reveals something greater.
[47:51] And so now he does, he's showing the
[47:53] temple that the glory of the first house
[47:56] was beautiful. It was wonderful. But
[47:57] verse 9, the glory of this latter house
[47:59] shall be greater than of the former.
[48:00] It's the same temple, but the glory of
[48:03] it is greater than the original. Now our
[48:05] body is a temple. So notice how Paul
[48:08] writes this in 2 Corinthians 5:es 1:5.
[48:11] For we know that if our earthly house of
[48:13] this tabernacle were dissolved. So we
[48:16] have an earthly tabernacle. We have a
[48:18] house.
[48:20] If it was dissolved, we have a building
[48:22] of God and a house not made with hands,
[48:25] eternal in the heavens.
[48:28] This is this is hard to swallow. It's
[48:30] always there.
[48:33] Hey, I've I've I've sat with ministers
[48:35] and talked for hours about could have it
[48:37] always been there, where was it? Maybe
[48:39] it doesn't mean what it's supposed to
[48:40] mean, and now it wasn't there. It's
[48:42] coming later. Otherwise, you'd be a four
[48:44] part B. And there's a lot of arguments.
[48:45] I'm thinking, you know what? It's just
[48:46] best to say what the Bible says, say
[48:50] what the message says. And brother
[48:52] Brandham takes this time and time again
[48:53] and says it's already there.
[48:58] So now if you could think about this,
[49:00] here you are in this body
[49:03] and God already had one coming
[49:08] that if this earthly tabernacle be
[49:09] dissolved.
[49:11] Now he says to be clothed. Now
[49:15] verse two, for in this we grown
[49:17] earnestly desiring, notice the language,
[49:19] to be clothed upon with our house which
[49:21] is from heaven.
[49:23] If so be that being clothed, we shall
[49:26] not be found naked. Now Paul is
[49:28] intentional in his language and being a
[49:31] student of the scripture just as he
[49:33] would later quote from Haggi and talk
[49:36] about once more I shake heavens and
[49:37] earth. And he's quoting from Haggi about
[49:39] Mount Zion. we've come to Mount Zion.
[49:41] And he brings a prophecy of the of the
[49:43] Old Testament into the New as one that
[49:45] it's going to happen in this Mount Zion.
[49:47] This bride, her showdown's coming and
[49:49] it's going to come in this last days
[49:51] that we're experiencing now. He's using
[49:53] purposeful language. We desire to be
[49:55] clothed upon with our house which is
[49:57] from heaven. If so, that being clothed
[50:00] we shall not be found naked. For we that
[50:03] are in this tabernacle, this body, do
[50:06] grown, be burdened. So though we are
[50:09] clothed with this body, we grown being
[50:11] burdened not that we would be unclothed
[50:13] but clothed upon that mortality might be
[50:16] swallowed up of life
[50:18] that we would never die but live
[50:20] forever.
[50:21] Amen.
[50:22] So I see something in Adam in the
[50:24] beginning and God says hey lest he reach
[50:26] forth his hand and take of the tree of
[50:27] life and live forever. Now Paul is going
[50:29] to be using a language of Genesis
[50:31] chapter 2 and he's saying look we in
[50:33] these bodies do grown desiring that we
[50:35] would not be found naked but be clothed
[50:38] upon with a house which is from heaven
[50:41] that mortality be swallow up in life.
[50:43] Now he that hath brought us the selfsame
[50:45] thing is God who also hath given us unto
[50:50] us the earnest of the spirit. God who
[50:53] has brought this to pass. God who has
[50:55] made it this way. God who hath taken
[50:57] this self-same thing. who has laid this
[50:59] out, made it part of his plan. It is
[51:01] God. And what has God done? He's given
[51:03] us the earnest of the spirit.
[51:06] Why? Because we grown not to be naked,
[51:08] to be clothed upon. We don't want this
[51:10] body to die only to end up in a in a in
[51:13] a condition that's naked,
[51:16] right?
[51:17] We don't want to just shed this body and
[51:19] go back to being a spirit being.
[51:20] What did Brother Brandon say? It was
[51:21] horror. It was spooky.
[51:23] I'm just going to be an apparition
[51:25] floating by brother Neville and I want
[51:27] to shake his hand and I can't do it. He
[51:28] there there was something to it that was
[51:30] forboding. It was a disconnect. There
[51:32] was something that lacked in the
[51:33] expression of man if that's what he
[51:35] would end up. Paul's saying no God who
[51:36] hath wrought this planned this is the
[51:39] one that's given us the earnest of the
[51:40] spirit. Now, what is the spirit and
[51:43] earnest of? Ephesians 1:14,
[51:46] the seal of God, which is the baptism of
[51:48] the Holy Ghost, which is the new birth,
[51:50] which seals you into the body of Christ,
[51:52] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[51:55] until the redemption of the purchased
[51:57] possession unto the praise of his glory.
[52:00] So, he gives us the spirit as an earnest
[52:02] of what? Full redemption. Redemption of
[52:05] the purchased possession. So, redemption
[52:08] purchased something. He paid the price
[52:10] for something, but then there's got to
[52:11] be a full apprehension and enjoyment of
[52:14] what it's purchased. So, he gives you
[52:16] the earnest, the spirit as an earnest,
[52:18] and it stands for something.
[52:20] It's a down payment that the whole
[52:22] property is coming.
[52:24] It's yours. You can bank on it.
[52:27] The spirit is an earnest of redemption.
[52:29] So, he's saying we that are in this body
[52:31] do groan to be clothed upon that we
[52:34] would not be found naked. And the spirit
[52:36] within us groans and hungers for what?
[52:38] to be clothed that we not be found naked
[52:41] because the spirit is the earnest of
[52:43] full redemption. Redemption of the
[52:45] purchased possession because the God who
[52:47] planned the plan of redemption gives us
[52:49] the earnest of redemption.
[52:51] And it comforts us.
[52:54] So our body is a temple. It's an earthly
[52:56] house. It is a tabernacle. So Haggi 2
[52:59] speaks in symmetry to that. Then in John
[53:02] 2 19 to 21,
[53:05] Jesus answered and said unto them,
[53:07] "Destroy this temple and in three days
[53:09] I'll raise it up."
[53:13] And what did they think?
[53:15] Then said the Jews, 40 and six years was
[53:19] this temple and building, and wilt thou
[53:22] rear it up in three days?
[53:24] Think about Haggi. Now, first glory is
[53:27] diminished,
[53:29] but the second glory is going to be
[53:30] greater than that of the former. Going
[53:32] to be a greater glory. Here's Jesus
[53:34] there here at the temple says, "Destroy
[53:36] this temple and I'll raise it up in
[53:38] three days." And he said, "It's taking
[53:39] us 46 years to get it to this point and
[53:41] you're going to do it in three days."
[53:43] But he spake of the temple of his body
[53:47] because they're always looking at the
[53:49] natural part of things. So, Haggi
[53:51] actually prophesies of Christ
[53:54] who held a greater glory that man had
[53:56] never fully realized.
[53:59] The glory of the first man is
[54:01] diminished, but now comes another man
[54:05] and in him it exceeds all other
[54:08] righteousness. In him, it excels beyond
[54:10] any other glory. In him comes the
[54:12] fullness of the potential and the
[54:14] promise that man had never fully
[54:16] realized. And so the Haggi chapter 2 is
[54:19] actually contains a prophecy of Christ.
[54:20] Remember the former glory. Well, when
[54:22] this house is rebuilt, when this one is
[54:25] raised, when this one comes forth, the
[54:26] glory of the latter house shall be
[54:28] greater than the former.
[54:30] It could even be said of Christ that
[54:32] he'll walk through these very steps,
[54:33] destroy this body, but in three days
[54:36] it's going to be raised up, and that
[54:37] body will be greater.
[54:39] Amen.
[54:41] And so, this story of redemption begins
[54:43] in Genesis. And I I I want to I want to
[54:47] really really go f fast. You can just
[54:48] play it later at a slower speed to get
[54:51] it all. The story of redemption begins
[54:53] in Genesis and the mysteries held within
[54:56] the story as God is telling it.
[55:00] And and I realized just trying to preach
[55:02] about it, how wise God was to not just
[55:05] stop and explain it all as he was going.
[55:07] He's like, it's just gonna it's just
[55:08] going to take me thousands of years
[55:11] because all these details just explode
[55:13] and amplify. And so now as I go through
[55:16] this, I'm just going to lay seeds
[55:17] because I want to go back over these
[55:18] scriptures later. So now watch this
[55:20] story of redemption as we've just read
[55:22] about the first house and the glory of
[55:24] it and the second house being greater
[55:26] and how we are typed as a house, a
[55:28] temple, and that Paul writes how that we
[55:30] desire to be clothed upon that we not be
[55:32] found naked. Genesis chapter 2 25 it
[55:36] says they were both naked. This is how
[55:37] Genesis 2 ends. This is how God's
[55:40] perfect description of of creation ends
[55:43] before the fall in chapter 3. And they
[55:45] were both naked, the man and his wife,
[55:48] and were not ashamed.
[55:51] Now, to be naked, it implies that they
[55:54] lacked something.
[55:56] They were aware. To be naked, it means
[55:58] they were conscious and aware of the
[56:00] fact that there was something that
[56:01] lacked. So, they were aware of a lack of
[56:03] a covering, but they were not
[56:04] disappointed.
[56:06] There was a consciousness that they were
[56:08] uh that they were uh they were both
[56:10] naked, the man and his wife, and were
[56:12] not ashamed. To say naked, it means they
[56:13] were conscious. They were aware. And so
[56:14] when and I I I want to maybe say this
[56:17] now. I thought maybe I could just hold
[56:18] it off, but I'm just sensing that in
[56:20] Genesis chapter 3 when their eyes are
[56:22] open and they recognize they're naked
[56:23] and maybe I'll just come to it here in a
[56:25] moment that this is a different feeling
[56:27] towards their nakedness because it said
[56:29] they're both naked, the man's wife, and
[56:31] we're not ashamed. There was no fear.
[56:33] There's no worry. They were trusting in
[56:35] God's promises. If there's something
[56:36] that needs to be done about this, God's
[56:38] going to do it. We're not going to worry
[56:39] about it. So, they both were naked, but
[56:42] not ashamed. So, in Genesis 3:7, it says
[56:45] this, "And the eyes of them were both
[56:47] opened, and they knew that they were
[56:49] naked."
[56:51] Now, we can see there's a different
[56:53] awareness and a different feeling and a
[56:54] different understanding. This naked,
[56:56] they were both naked, and they sewed fig
[56:58] leaves together and made themselves
[57:00] aprons.
[57:02] So now when they know if there's a
[57:04] greater awareness or understanding of
[57:05] their nakedness, now they have to
[57:07] respond to it. So it says they were both
[57:10] naked and not ashamed. Now they could
[57:12] either we could either say they didn't
[57:13] know they were naked, so there's no
[57:15] shame.
[57:17] But now that they have shame associated
[57:19] with their nakedness because perhaps
[57:21] before they knew they were naked, but
[57:23] there's no fear. There's no shame in it.
[57:25] There's no reproach. They're trusting
[57:26] God. They're trusting God. But now
[57:28] through the fall, their minds now get
[57:30] the seed of fears creeps in. And now
[57:33] they look at their nakedness totally
[57:34] different. There's a shame there. And so
[57:37] immediately and their eyes are open and
[57:38] they knew they were naked. They sewed
[57:40] fig leaves together and they made
[57:42] themselves aprons. You know what that
[57:43] Hebrew word for apron means? Loin cloth.
[57:46] Now why in the world would they want to
[57:47] cover that up? I don't know.
[57:52] I mean after all maybe there was
[57:53] something in the apricot, right?
[57:57] speaks directly to now they're conscious
[57:59] of this and so they make aprons and what
[58:02] is it just a religious covering
[58:05] man's first response to what lacks
[58:09] man in fear says okay how do I remedy
[58:11] this situation how do I take care of
[58:13] this they're no longer trusting in God
[58:15] now they want to do their own thing but
[58:16] in verse 21 unto Adam also and to his
[58:19] wife did the Lord God make coats of skin
[58:22] and clothe them so and this they made
[58:25] aprons
[58:26] which is just a like a belt that just it
[58:28] girds them like a loin cloth which is
[58:31] how brother Brandham saw the leodysene
[58:33] church age going out in the end but then
[58:35] when the bride came in view she's what
[58:38] arrayed
[58:39] she's dressed so now he says and Adam
[58:43] also and his wife did the Lord make
[58:45] coats of skin and clothe them which
[58:47] means arrayed or dressed so when God
[58:50] does this man immediately just gets a
[58:52] loin cloth to cover his flesh but now
[58:54] God is speaking speaking something. He's
[58:56] hiding a mystery in this image.
[58:59] Very beautiful picture, though it would
[59:00] have been a very kind of grotesque
[59:02] picture, especially the way Brother Bram
[59:03] describes it. Here's a dead body draped
[59:06] around a living body.
[59:08] But somehow in that, it represents life.
[59:12] Somehow in this image of a dead body
[59:15] around a living body, God is expressing
[59:17] redemption.
[59:20] And now this man who was naked tried to
[59:22] remedy his nakedness, but it wasn't
[59:24] enough. So then God takes lamb skkins
[59:27] and he drapes his whole body and dresses
[59:30] him so that he would be arrayed.
[59:34] And then in verse chapter same chapter
[59:37] verse 22
[59:40] he says and now lest he put forth his
[59:42] hand and take also of the tree of life
[59:44] and eat and live forever.
[59:49] So man had to be stopped from eating
[59:53] something that would allow him to always
[59:55] live.
[59:57] His body would have always lived. He
[1:00:00] just put forth his hand, eat, and live
[1:00:03] forever. Again, it's symbolism, right?
[1:00:07] It's it's an analogy.
[1:00:10] It would have been too easy.
[1:00:14] It wasn't God's plan.
[1:00:18] to share his glory without sacrifice.
[1:00:23] This is the just the real thrust I want
[1:00:26] you to catch. Now, it wasn't his plan to
[1:00:28] share his glory without sacrifice. So,
[1:00:30] notice what it says now in 1 Corinthians
[1:00:32] chapter 15
[1:00:34] 36-4.
[1:00:39] Paul talking about this body being
[1:00:41] clothed upon. When is it clothed upon?
[1:00:43] That mortality might be swallowed up of
[1:00:45] life.
[1:00:49] They were both naked in Genesis 2:25.
[1:00:52] They're eroded in Genesis 3, but held
[1:00:55] back from eating the tree of life, lest
[1:00:57] they live forever. Now, notice what Paul
[1:00:59] says, because I'm making I'm contending
[1:01:01] that God's plan was he couldn't share
[1:01:04] his glory without sacrifice.
[1:01:07] And notice what Paul says in very pretty
[1:01:09] heavy language. Thou fool, that which
[1:01:12] thou seest does not quicken except it
[1:01:14] die.
[1:01:16] And that which thou seest, thou seest
[1:01:18] not that body that shall be, but bear
[1:01:21] grain, it may chance of wheat or some
[1:01:23] other grain. But God giveth giveth it a
[1:01:26] body as it hath pleased him, and to
[1:01:29] every seed his own body. All flesh is
[1:01:32] not the same flesh, but there's one kind
[1:01:34] of flesh of men, another flesh of beast,
[1:01:36] another of fishes, and another of birds.
[1:01:38] There are also celestial bodies and
[1:01:40] bodies terrestrial. But the glory of the
[1:01:43] celestial one and the glory of the
[1:01:44] terrestrial is another.
[1:01:47] There is one glory of the sun, another
[1:01:49] glory of the moon, and another glory of
[1:01:50] the stars. For one star different from
[1:01:52] another star in glory. So also is the
[1:01:55] resurrection of the dead.
[1:01:58] It is sown in corruption, it is raised
[1:02:00] in incorruption. It is sown in dishonor,
[1:02:03] it is raised in glory.
[1:02:05] It is sown in weakness, it is raised in
[1:02:07] power. It is sown a natural body. It is
[1:02:10] raised a spiritual body. There is a
[1:02:11] natural body and there is a spiritual
[1:02:14] body.
[1:02:15] I'm running out of time, but let me just
[1:02:17] say this as I take this in total. Thou
[1:02:19] fool do you not know that that which is
[1:02:20] sws is not quickened except it die? And
[1:02:24] he says there's certain bodies, but God
[1:02:25] has given a seed. Every seed its own
[1:02:27] body and there's different glories to
[1:02:30] that. And so there may be one body that
[1:02:32] dies, but now when it quickens, he says
[1:02:34] in the resurrection, it's not raised in
[1:02:37] the same dishonor. It's not raised in
[1:02:39] the same corruption, but it's raised in
[1:02:41] glory. It's raised in power.
[1:02:45] And so God's plan of redemption required
[1:02:47] certain things that the garden alone
[1:02:50] could not have produced.
[1:02:52] And I know it's a paradox, but God's
[1:02:54] plan of redemption required in order for
[1:02:57] there to be a quickening, there had to
[1:02:59] be a death. In order for there to be the
[1:03:01] greater glory, there had to be a
[1:03:02] suffering. So God's plan of redemption
[1:03:04] required things that could not have
[1:03:06] happened in the Garden of Eden.
[1:03:08] I admit it's a paradox, but it's true.
[1:03:12] And so, Brother Brandham writes this in
[1:03:14] church age book chapter 3. Now, the word
[1:03:16] most definitely sets forth, and I have
[1:03:18] to just ask you to focus very diligently
[1:03:21] and purposefully with me now. Now, the
[1:03:23] word most definitely sets forth that
[1:03:24] from the before the foundation of the
[1:03:27] earth, the purpose of God was to share
[1:03:29] his eternal life with man. This was
[1:03:31] God's purpose. So then why did he stop
[1:03:33] Adam from doing it?
[1:03:36] So then he quotes Ephesians 1:4-11,
[1:03:38] Revelations 13:8. And now notice what he
[1:03:40] says.
[1:03:42] But that life could not and would not be
[1:03:44] shared in any other way than through the
[1:03:47] way of God manifest in the flesh. This
[1:03:51] was part of his eternal and
[1:03:52] predestinated purpose. This plan was to
[1:03:55] be to the praise of the glory of his
[1:03:57] grace. It was the plan of redemption. It
[1:04:01] was the plan of salvation. Now listen
[1:04:03] closely. God being a savior, it was
[1:04:07] necessary that he predestinate a man who
[1:04:09] would require salvation in order to give
[1:04:12] himself reason and purpose of being.
[1:04:16] Read it to you before. You've read it
[1:04:17] before. We've heard this before. But oh,
[1:04:19] may God make it fit, make it connect
[1:04:21] more perfectly with scripture. God
[1:04:23] wanted to share eternal life with man.
[1:04:26] But it had to come a certain way. So he
[1:04:28] had a plan, a predestinated plan and
[1:04:30] purpose for this to happen. He says God
[1:04:33] being a savior, it was necessary,
[1:04:35] absolutely required that he
[1:04:37] predestinated a man, let me just say,
[1:04:39] Adam, that would require salvation in
[1:04:42] order to give himself reason and purpose
[1:04:45] of being.
[1:04:46] Unless man needed redemption, God did
[1:04:49] not have purpose. Unless man needed
[1:04:52] saving, God would not have reason to
[1:04:54] exist. He said, "This is 100% correct,
[1:04:56] and multitudes of scriptures bear it
[1:04:58] out. I'm going to skip some of them as I
[1:05:00] have it represented here. Man could not
[1:05:02] directly come and partake of the tree of
[1:05:05] life in the midst of the garden."
[1:05:08] That eternal life of the tree had to
[1:05:10] become flesh first. But before God could
[1:05:14] raise and save a sinner, he had to have
[1:05:16] a sinner to raise and save. Man had to
[1:05:20] fall.
[1:05:22] The fall which would be caused by Satan
[1:05:23] had to have flesh to make fall. Satan
[1:05:26] had to come through flesh also. But
[1:05:28] Satan could not come through human flesh
[1:05:30] to make the fall as would Christ come in
[1:05:33] human flesh to restore the fallen. Amen.
[1:05:39] So the the the tree of your life had to
[1:05:42] become flesh first.
[1:05:44] There was a way that God had ordained
[1:05:46] it. Romans 5:14, "Nevertheless, death
[1:05:48] reigned from Adam to Moses, even over
[1:05:50] them that had not sinned after the
[1:05:51] similitude of Adam's transgression, who
[1:05:53] is the figure of him that was to come."
[1:05:56] So Adam, the man that needed saving, was
[1:05:59] a figure of him that was to come, the
[1:06:01] Savior.
[1:06:03] He is a figure. He is a form of Christ,
[1:06:09] but he's the man that would needed
[1:06:11] salvation
[1:06:12] in order to give God purpose and reason
[1:06:14] of being.
[1:06:16] Man could not just directly come and
[1:06:18] partake of the tree of life. The tree of
[1:06:20] life had to become flesh first and man
[1:06:23] had to fall.
[1:06:25] That seems like a paradox before he
[1:06:27] would have a right to it. So Adam is the
[1:06:30] figure of him that is to come. So think
[1:06:32] about this and we read it before in
[1:06:34] Romans chapter 5. Death came by Adam.
[1:06:38] He's the figure. He's the form. But
[1:06:39] death comes by him. His fallen image
[1:06:42] then holds the mystery that life would
[1:06:46] come by death.
[1:06:49] This is being bore out in Adam. It's
[1:06:51] being borne out when the lamb is slain
[1:06:53] and put over him. It it's it's it's
[1:06:56] being Adam is living it. He's a figure
[1:06:58] of him that is to come. In Adam, God was
[1:06:59] showing that the fullness of life cannot
[1:07:01] come without suffering.
[1:07:03] He's showing that the fullness of joy
[1:07:05] cannot come without sorrow.
[1:07:07] If you never knew sorrow, you wouldn't
[1:07:08] know what this was.
[1:07:11] Man, I feel so whatever this is.
[1:07:15] You wouldn't know what happy was if you
[1:07:17] didn't know what sad was.
[1:07:20] So, Adam had to leave the garden and be
[1:07:22] driven into the wilderness for God's
[1:07:24] love to be expressed. In order for there
[1:07:26] to be fullness of life, there had to be
[1:07:28] death. In order for there to be fullness
[1:07:29] of joy, there had to be sorrow.
[1:07:32] Brother Brandham says this now, and I'm
[1:07:35] reading three different places where he
[1:07:36] refers to this, and I I I want to do
[1:07:38] this to substantiate it over and over
[1:07:39] and over again so that you get this.
[1:07:41] Brother says, "I believe the Bible is
[1:07:42] the word and the whole truth. And Jesus
[1:07:45] is the word made manifest. And he is the
[1:07:48] one and the same." What was he? Now
[1:07:50] look, he was that seed. I got to hold
[1:07:54] back in order to get in there this
[1:07:55] evening. You see, it's hard. He was that
[1:07:58] seed that Eve should have produced.
[1:08:02] Do you get it? He was the seed that Eve
[1:08:04] was produced. But she hybridated by
[1:08:07] disbelieving God's word. He was that
[1:08:09] seed. And the only way that life could
[1:08:12] be in the reproduction of life, life had
[1:08:15] to come through that seed. And that seed
[1:08:19] had to die in order to spread out the
[1:08:22] life. Oh, can't you see it? That's why
[1:08:25] the water was given to water the seed.
[1:08:27] The Holy Spirit that was in the Garden
[1:08:28] of Eden was to water the seed. Man
[1:08:30] wasn't made to die. He was made to live,
[1:08:33] but hybriding brought death there. She
[1:08:35] hybrided. But what did it do? Satan
[1:08:38] worked out what was necessary to bring
[1:08:40] to pass Satan's plan or God's plan.
[1:08:43] Amen.
[1:08:43] Because God had to have a man who
[1:08:45] required saving in order for God to have
[1:08:47] a reason to exist.
[1:08:49] God had to ordain it that way. So he's
[1:08:51] saying that Eve should have produced
[1:08:53] that seed. But then he makes this
[1:08:55] curious statement. That seed had to die.
[1:08:59] Paragraph 161. To be born of the water
[1:09:01] and the spirit, what does it do? Then it
[1:09:03] brings you right back again unto the
[1:09:04] place where you should have been at the
[1:09:06] beginning. That's the reason of Christ's
[1:09:08] death brings us right back again to sons
[1:09:10] of God. If Eve would have brought forth
[1:09:13] that child, she would have finally done
[1:09:15] it. Did God not tell her multiply and
[1:09:17] replenish the earth? But she had to walk
[1:09:19] over here and play the part of a
[1:09:22] I know that's just kind of a real gut
[1:09:24] punch kind of language, but brother
[1:09:26] Badam said that man had to fall. Now she
[1:09:30] says she had to walk over here and
[1:09:31] played that part. But he's saying that
[1:09:33] Eve should have produced it. Eve would
[1:09:37] have brought forth that child.
[1:09:40] But had the woman brought it forth,
[1:09:42] where's the mystery of God then?
[1:09:45] Had there only been one Eden, who would
[1:09:47] God be to us?
[1:09:52] The woman could have, he even says
[1:09:54] should have, she would have brought
[1:09:55] forth this seed, but that would not have
[1:09:57] s served God's purpose.
[1:10:00] He said the eternal life of the tree had
[1:10:02] to become flesh first.
[1:10:06] But first, man had to fall and he had to
[1:10:10] drop God's image.
[1:10:12] Brother Bram says in oneness when Adam
[1:10:13] and Eve listened to the lie of the devil
[1:10:15] the holy image of God left them their
[1:10:17] fellowship was broken with God. So
[1:10:20] there's something that leaves we can say
[1:10:23] that tital deed of redemption this
[1:10:24] awareness this understand all this great
[1:10:26] continuity and harmony he had with God
[1:10:28] these channels become clogged in the
[1:10:30] holy image of God leaves him and their
[1:10:31] fellowship with God is broken and God
[1:10:33] seals away the power of life.
[1:10:36] Now Adam then was still in the same
[1:10:39] body. God didn't take the body that he
[1:10:41] had. where he says in the image of God
[1:10:43] left them. It wasn't that this natural
[1:10:44] body went it and was sucked away from
[1:10:46] him and then God gave him another body
[1:10:48] that could die. Adam remained in a body
[1:10:50] that obviously was made with the
[1:10:52] potential of death because now that he
[1:10:54] took of the tree of life in a
[1:10:56] conditional covenant because he took of
[1:10:57] the tree of knowledge of good and evil
[1:10:58] under a conditional covenant. He says
[1:11:00] the day you eat, the day you die. That
[1:11:01] means he had a body that could die.
[1:11:06] So now when the blessing is taken away
[1:11:08] from him, he's subject to death.
[1:11:11] And so now he had this body that could
[1:11:13] die. But that was part of God's
[1:11:16] predestinated plan called redemption. It
[1:11:19] was necessary in God's purpose. 2
[1:11:21] Corinthians 5:21, "For he hath made him
[1:11:23] to be sin for us, who knew no sin, that
[1:11:26] we might be made the righteousness of
[1:11:28] God in him." He made him to be sin that
[1:11:31] we might be made the righteousness of
[1:11:33] God in him.
[1:11:34] And brother B said, "The only way that
[1:11:36] you could spread out life is for the
[1:11:38] seed to die." So there could have been a
[1:11:42] replication, but there was something
[1:11:43] that would have been lacking in this
[1:11:45] replication. And so God knew there's a
[1:11:47] way that for me to be fully understood
[1:11:50] and a way for you to be fully expressed,
[1:11:52] it has to come a particular way. So I'm
[1:11:53] going to take him who knew no sin and
[1:11:56] make him sin that we might be made the
[1:11:58] very righteousness of God in him.
[1:12:03] Brother Brandham says and spoke the
[1:12:04] words of the original seed again he says
[1:12:06] it is the germ that come from the seed.
[1:12:08] He is he is the word of God made
[1:12:10] perfectly manifest. He is correctly the
[1:12:12] son from the first Adam was the son that
[1:12:15] was promised through Adam to continue on
[1:12:17] the human race. He's the seed to Abraham
[1:12:20] too. Right? And Eve hybrid to the
[1:12:22] serpent and brought forth a generation
[1:12:24] of bastard children born to death
[1:12:26] without life. And Jesus coming was that
[1:12:30] seed. He proved it. Brother, I said it
[1:12:32] was Genesis 1:28. Everything that Adam
[1:12:35] lost, Jesus was.
[1:12:38] Ponder this. He touches on it so often
[1:12:39] in his ministry. Everything that Adam
[1:12:41] lost in the fall, Jesus proved he
[1:12:43] restored back. He is the correct. He's
[1:12:46] talking about the correct son. Eve would
[1:12:48] have finally brought that child forth,
[1:12:51] but she hybrid it through the serpent,
[1:12:53] enlisting for wisdom, understanding, and
[1:12:55] knowledge.
[1:12:57] So there's a way that God arranged it to
[1:12:59] where this son would have come.
[1:13:02] But had he come, God would not have been
[1:13:05] satisfied and fulfilled in his purpose
[1:13:07] had he come that way.
[1:13:10] It do you I know it's kind of again I'm
[1:13:13] making it might be making it seem kind
[1:13:15] of complicated, but brother said
[1:13:16] everything was arranged to where this
[1:13:18] son could come forth,
[1:13:21] but God says stop there. It's not time.
[1:13:25] Stop there. That's not the way that I
[1:13:26] want this to happen. This is not the way
[1:13:28] that it should be. So the blessing of
[1:13:31] Genesis 1:28 was taken from mankind,
[1:13:33] sealed away from him. The great power
[1:13:35] then of that lays dormant.
[1:13:38] And Adam never fully walked in the glory
[1:13:41] of Genesis 1:28. The woman never
[1:13:43] fulfilled it. Mankind had never
[1:13:45] fulfilled it. But now Adam, who is a
[1:13:47] figure of him that is to come, he
[1:13:49] consciously and purposely misuses the
[1:13:52] power that been given to him.
[1:13:54] Right?
[1:13:55] So even though Adam may be acting out of
[1:13:59] order, out of God's time, but when he
[1:14:01] still acts, he's a figure of him that's
[1:14:03] to come. Because it's an act of saving.
[1:14:08] It's an act to save the woman. As the
[1:14:10] Bible says in 1 Timothy 2:13-14, first
[1:14:13] Adam is formed, then Eve, and Adam was
[1:14:16] not deceived, but the woman being
[1:14:17] deceived was in the transgression. The
[1:14:19] woman's deceived. Adam's not deceived.
[1:14:22] But he consciously acts in a way to join
[1:14:24] himself to the woman that could have
[1:14:26] been condemned.
[1:14:27] The woman that could have died. He
[1:14:29] becomes sin,
[1:14:30] who knew no sin that he might preserve
[1:14:33] her.
[1:14:36] So Adam of his own will used his power
[1:14:39] to save the woman. What is he
[1:14:40] foreshadowing? Redemption.
[1:14:43] It's just a small little glimpse. It's
[1:14:45] just a small little figure. Adam is
[1:14:46] acting, showing a foreshadowing of
[1:14:48] redemption. Adam was the prefigure. Adam
[1:14:51] was the shadow. Adam was the first
[1:14:53] glimpse.
[1:14:54] And so his pattern, his form held the
[1:14:56] mystery or the potential of what was
[1:14:58] there. But it would take death to
[1:15:00] develop it.
[1:15:02] It could not be fully expressed unless
[1:15:04] death would come to develop it. So Adam
[1:15:07] became sin.
[1:15:09] And in becoming sin, he couldn't make
[1:15:12] the woman righteous.
[1:15:15] something limited in his power now
[1:15:17] because of the timing of this. But he
[1:15:19] had power to preserve her.
[1:15:24] And so he doesn't use the power to make
[1:15:27] righteous.
[1:15:29] That is reserved in the seed.
[1:15:33] Brother Brandham, he says it this way.
[1:15:35] God wanted to share eternal life with
[1:15:37] man. But the only way that life could be
[1:15:39] in the reproduction of life, it had to
[1:15:41] come through that seed. And that seed
[1:15:43] had to die in order to spread out life.
[1:15:47] It's the way that God made it. The death
[1:15:50] of Christ was not the accident of sin.
[1:15:53] Redemption is not an accident.
[1:15:56] So in Adam, we see that Adam
[1:15:59] took life and turned it to death. He
[1:16:01] took innocence. Brother Ram says these
[1:16:02] things in the church book. Took innocent
[1:16:04] and turned it to guilt. Took the garden
[1:16:06] of Eden and turned Eden into a
[1:16:08] wilderness. Is that what he did? That's
[1:16:11] the first Adam.
[1:16:12] That's the first man.
[1:16:15] Him who is a living creature. Him who
[1:16:17] had the breath of life and an affinity
[1:16:19] to the earth. Him that came in this body
[1:16:20] that came from the earth. This is his
[1:16:22] testimony. This is his witness. But
[1:16:24] there's going to come another Adam.
[1:16:27] And notice what it says here in verse 45
[1:16:29] of 1 Corinthians chapter 15.
[1:16:32] Now I want to point this out.
[1:16:37] In 1 Corinthians chapter 15, we read
[1:16:40] verses 36 to 44 where he says, "Thou
[1:16:43] fool, don't you know that that which is
[1:16:44] sowed is not quickened except it die."
[1:16:46] And he starts talking about celestial
[1:16:48] bodies and terrestrial bodies. And
[1:16:49] there's another glory of the sun, the
[1:16:50] moon, and the stars. And then this body,
[1:16:52] then there's a glory of the first body,
[1:16:54] but then there's a glory of the second
[1:16:56] body. And that's it ends in verse 44
[1:16:59] saying it's raised. There's a spiritual
[1:17:01] body. He says, "And so it is written, go
[1:17:03] back and read it all together. The first
[1:17:05] man Adam was made a living soul. The
[1:17:08] last Adam was made a quickening
[1:17:12] a quickening spirit. Why quickening
[1:17:15] spirit? Thou full. That which thou seest
[1:17:17] is not quickened except it die. So the
[1:17:19] first man was made a living soul. That's
[1:17:21] glorious. That's wonderful. But the last
[1:17:23] Adam is different than the first. He is
[1:17:26] made a quickening spirit. He is made a
[1:17:29] lifegiver. He is made a redeemer. He's
[1:17:31] the one that holds the power of eternal
[1:17:33] life. Adam did not have it to give. God
[1:17:36] withheld that from Adam and waited to
[1:17:38] give it to Christ. And now Christ is the
[1:17:41] quickening spirit, not Adam. So in the
[1:17:43] redemption of Genesis 1:28, in the seed
[1:17:46] of Genesis 3:15, in the seed of Abraham,
[1:17:48] it is Christ who holds the mystery of
[1:17:50] redemption. It is something greater.
[1:17:53] Adam was not just Adam's creation
[1:17:55] patched up. It is a another creation. It
[1:17:58] is a new creation. That is why we sing a
[1:18:01] new song.
[1:18:01] Amen. Amen.
[1:18:03] He's made a lifegiver. Now,
[1:18:07] this is the glory that Adam stopped
[1:18:08] short of. This is the glory of the
[1:18:11] covenant of Genesis 1:28. This is what
[1:18:13] Adam lost.
[1:18:16] All these great powers. All right.
[1:18:18] Brother Brandham said that the seed had
[1:18:20] to become flesh first
[1:18:22] and it had to die. John 1:14. And the
[1:18:25] word was made flesh and dwelt among us.
[1:18:28] And we beheld his glory, the glory is of
[1:18:30] the only begotten of the father, full of
[1:18:33] grace and truth. Adam was not the
[1:18:35] begotten of the father. He was a created
[1:18:37] son.
[1:18:39] But now Christ is born of a woman just
[1:18:43] like everyone else in earth today
[1:18:48] creating this affinity becoming the near
[1:18:49] kinsman. He the word was made flesh and
[1:18:52] we beheld his glory. The glory is the
[1:18:53] only begotten of the father. There's a
[1:18:55] difference between Adam and Christ.
[1:18:58] He didn't just create another Adam and
[1:18:59] put him on the same basis of Adam.
[1:19:02] This is the mystery of redemption.
[1:19:04] Christ our redeemer brought forth a
[1:19:06] greater glory. This is not an accident.
[1:19:10] Everything God formed and everything God
[1:19:13] created had was fashioned with
[1:19:15] redemption in mind.
[1:19:19] Have you thought of it this way? that as
[1:19:22] Christ hung upon the cross in creation,
[1:19:26] God made the iron ore that one day would
[1:19:30] be beaten into the nails that would hang
[1:19:32] his son upon a cross. That in the
[1:19:34] beginning, God created the trees and
[1:19:36] allowed them to come forth with the law
[1:19:38] written in them. That one day all the
[1:19:40] elements that purchased your redemption
[1:19:43] laid within the earth. God couldn't just
[1:19:45] take a man and slay him supernaturally.
[1:19:48] There's a way, a process that had to
[1:19:49] come. And in Christ, he brings forth our
[1:19:52] redemption. And everything God that he
[1:19:54] created, he formed and fashioned with
[1:19:56] redemption in mind. The iron ore, the
[1:19:59] tree, all the elements for sacrifice
[1:20:01] laid within the earth to redeem earth.
[1:20:06] And the principles of redemption, the
[1:20:08] very principles, the meaning of it, the
[1:20:10] mystery of it would not allow Genesis
[1:20:12] 1:28 to be fulfilled without suffering.
[1:20:15] Would not allow Genesis 1:28 to come
[1:20:17] with ease. It says in Romans chapter 8
[1:20:21] 17 to23 and if children then heirs heirs
[1:20:23] of God and joint hes with Christ if so
[1:20:26] be that we suffer with him that we may
[1:20:28] also be glorified together for I reckon
[1:20:31] that the sufferings of this present time
[1:20:33] are not worthy to be compared with the
[1:20:36] glory which shall be revealed in us.
[1:20:39] What are we taught? This is an absolute.
[1:20:40] It was true then. It's true now. It was
[1:20:42] true before the foundation of the world.
[1:20:44] Character simply is never made without
[1:20:46] suffering. And the garden lacked the
[1:20:49] suffering that was necessary so it
[1:20:51] couldn't produce the glory that was to
[1:20:53] come.
[1:20:54] Adam was created here. He's created. He
[1:20:57] knows perfect love. All these things are
[1:20:58] perfect. But yet there's something that
[1:21:00] lacks in Adam that because he lacked
[1:21:02] there couldn't be a full expression of
[1:21:04] all that God was. So he stops Adam at
[1:21:06] just the right place so that time could
[1:21:09] unfold. so that God could express
[1:21:11] himself and the seed could come and that
[1:21:14] through his suffering we likewise could
[1:21:16] also be brought to the same glory.
[1:21:19] He says we're joint hes if we suffer.
[1:21:22] And he says, I reckon that the
[1:21:23] sufferings of this present time are not
[1:21:25] worthy to be compared to the glory which
[1:21:27] shall be revealed in us.
[1:21:30] There's something to be revealed in you.
[1:21:33] And this was always God's plan. Life
[1:21:36] comes from death. Glory comes from
[1:21:39] suffering. It's not without a price.
[1:21:42] This is the mystery of the fall. This is
[1:21:44] the mystery. They were in the garden.
[1:21:46] They were naked and were not ashamed.
[1:21:47] And all of a sudden, Satan is in the
[1:21:49] garden and he's working these things
[1:21:50] out. But it's working out God's plan
[1:21:53] which was necessary for his purpose
[1:21:54] because he says if we suffer, we shall
[1:21:57] also reign with him.
[1:21:59] It's
[1:22:00] the only way to the throne.
[1:22:03] Says it about Christ. them. Philippians
[1:22:06] 2:6, who being in the form of God,
[1:22:07] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[1:22:09] God. This scripture, as brother Brandham
[1:22:11] interprets it, and I believe it's a
[1:22:12] proper interpretation, I take that back.
[1:22:14] He interpreted it. So, it's proper
[1:22:17] that he thought it not robbery that it
[1:22:20] wasn't a crime. It wasn't illegal. It
[1:22:22] was his right.
[1:22:24] But it also has with it the meaning just
[1:22:26] because he knew it was his privilege, it
[1:22:29] was not just something easily grasped.
[1:22:32] thought it not robbery, godlikeness, god
[1:22:35] equality. For the image of God to be
[1:22:37] perfectly expressed, you can't just take
[1:22:39] it.
[1:22:41] It's not something easily grasp. That's
[1:22:43] why God stopped Adam lest he put his
[1:22:44] hand forth and take of the tree of life.
[1:22:46] Says it's not something the image is not
[1:22:48] something that can speak that can be
[1:22:50] expressed unless there's depth of
[1:22:52] suffering.
[1:22:54] It cannot really come forth through
[1:22:56] ease. It can't come forth through
[1:22:58] through through no trial or no
[1:22:59] suffering. Do we have to suffer to
[1:23:01] reign? He hath made us kings and priests
[1:23:04] and we shall reign on the earth unlike
[1:23:06] Adam was able to
[1:23:09] Christ who being in the form of God
[1:23:10] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[1:23:11] God. And notice what it says in Matthew
[1:23:14] chapter 4:1. Then after the spirit
[1:23:16] descends upon Jesus, heaven and earth
[1:23:18] unite. Then was Jesus led up of the
[1:23:21] spirit into the wilderness to be tempted
[1:23:22] of the devil.
[1:23:25] The spirit of God drove Adam
[1:23:29] out of the garden into the wilderness.
[1:23:32] Why? Because Adam's a prefigure.
[1:23:35] And now Jesus is led of the spirit into
[1:23:37] the wilderness just like Adam was.
[1:23:40] And in the description in Mark, he says
[1:23:42] there he was in the presence. He was
[1:23:44] there tempted of Satan and in the
[1:23:45] presence of the animals or the beasts.
[1:23:48] It's just like it would have been in the
[1:23:49] beginning. Here he is in the wilderness
[1:23:51] in creation. They're all around and
[1:23:53] they're looking at Christ and they're
[1:23:56] sensing something, something just deeply
[1:23:59] ingrained in creation wondering.
[1:24:02] There's some some nature inside of them
[1:24:04] that's intrigued by what's taking place.
[1:24:06] Why? Creation would have witnessed
[1:24:07] something thousands and thousands of
[1:24:09] years ago in the garden. And now Christ
[1:24:13] is unfolding the very same thing that
[1:24:15] creation witnessed in the beginning. Now
[1:24:17] Christ is led of the spirit into the
[1:24:18] wilderness to be tempted. And again, the
[1:24:20] devil offers to Christ what he offered
[1:24:23] to man and woman in the beginning. Verse
[1:24:25] eight, again the devil taketh him up
[1:24:27] into an exceeding high mountain, and
[1:24:29] showeth him all the kingdoms of the
[1:24:30] world, and the glory of them, and say
[1:24:34] them, all these things will I give thee,
[1:24:36] if thou wilt fall down and worship me.
[1:24:39] Then saith Jesus unto them, Get thee,
[1:24:41] hence, Satan, for it is written, Thou
[1:24:43] shalt not worship the Lord thy thou
[1:24:44] shalt worship the Lord thy God. In him
[1:24:46] only shalt thou serve. Then the devil
[1:24:48] leaveth him and behold angels came and
[1:24:51] ministered unto him. What was the beauty
[1:24:55] of this? Resisted the temptation. All
[1:24:57] those kingdoms were going to be his. All
[1:25:00] those kingdoms and the glory of it were
[1:25:01] rightfully his. As him being the correct
[1:25:04] son, him being the seed of Abraham. They
[1:25:06] were his. The whole world was his. It
[1:25:08] was all being given to him. It was his
[1:25:10] to rule. But what was the heir of the
[1:25:12] offering? He wanted him to take it
[1:25:15] without suffering. Amen.
[1:25:17] He wanted to bypass God's way and he
[1:25:20] could have bowed himself to worship and
[1:25:22] become what he was going to be. But it
[1:25:24] would have been contrary to the divine
[1:25:26] order because he couldn't rule without
[1:25:28] suffering.
[1:25:31] He couldn't bypass God's way. Hebrews
[1:25:33] chapter 2 verse 10. For it became him is
[1:25:37] speaking of God. It became him. In other
[1:25:39] words, this is an act fitting of his
[1:25:40] divine plan. This is becoming of God's
[1:25:42] nature. This is becoming of God's
[1:25:44] intent. It was becoming to God's plan.
[1:25:47] It was in line with his divine purpose.
[1:25:49] This was an act fitting of his divine
[1:25:51] plan. For whom are all things and by
[1:25:54] whom are all things? In bringing many
[1:25:56] sons to glory.
[1:25:58] Because you have to bring many sons to
[1:26:00] glory, not just one.
[1:26:02] To make the captain of their salvation
[1:26:04] perfect.
[1:26:07] You want to put a period there?
[1:26:09] Through suffering.
[1:26:12] The glory that Adam fell short of could
[1:26:15] only come through suffering. The next
[1:26:18] step could only unfold after their
[1:26:21] struggle, toil, trial. Even Christ the
[1:26:24] son of God. For it became him to make
[1:26:26] Christ our captain of salvation.
[1:26:29] Perfect. How? Through suffering. Hebrews
[1:26:32] 5:8-9. Though he were a son, yet learned
[1:26:34] he obedience by the things which he
[1:26:36] suffered.
[1:26:38] and being made perfect through what
[1:26:40] sufferings. He became the author of
[1:26:43] eternal salvation unto all them that
[1:26:45] obey him. This was God's plan. It became
[1:26:48] the only way for the glory to be
[1:26:50] expressed. The seed had to come. It had
[1:26:53] to be born of a woman. It had to suffer.
[1:26:55] It had to die. But he had given him
[1:26:58] power to raise it up again. And then
[1:27:01] being raised up, he could share that
[1:27:03] life with you who had also only known
[1:27:06] sin. And now you too could become
[1:27:08] partakers of his righteousness. That's
[1:27:10] the only way that it could happen.
[1:27:14] We should not want to go back to the
[1:27:16] beginning. If we could somehow create a
[1:27:18] time machine and go back to the
[1:27:20] beginning and keep the woman from
[1:27:21] falling, that would not complement God's
[1:27:24] purpose. But living according to his
[1:27:27] plan and submitting ourselves to his
[1:27:29] will, that pleases him.
[1:27:33] Oh, have Christ was made perfect through
[1:27:35] suffering. If suffering things he was
[1:27:37] made perfect, then I understand for me
[1:27:39] then the glory that's to be revealed in
[1:27:42] me is going to come by suffering.
[1:27:46] Verse 19, for the earnest expectation of
[1:27:48] the creature waiteth.
[1:27:53] I I just going to attribute that to a
[1:27:55] supernatural act. I have a clock up here
[1:27:58] and it just paused for the last 11
[1:28:00] minutes. I was like, it has been 10
[1:28:03] 11:43 forever. They're like, "This is
[1:28:06] really supernatural."
[1:28:08] And they're like, "Wait a minute. This
[1:28:10] is supernatural, but my my clock
[1:28:13] stopped.
[1:28:15] I'll have less time I thought I did.
[1:28:24] The sufferings of this present time are
[1:28:26] not worthy compared to the glory
[1:28:28] which you shall reveal."
[1:28:31] So verse 19, notice how beautiful this
[1:28:32] is. I'd like to amplify it more, but I'm
[1:28:34] just going to read through it and then
[1:28:36] get to verse 23.
[1:28:38] For the earnest expectation of the
[1:28:40] creature, the creation,
[1:28:43] creation now waits for the manifestation
[1:28:47] of the sons of God. All of creation, all
[1:28:50] of earth, its nature, its life, its
[1:28:54] purpose, its being, is longing for the
[1:28:57] manifestation of sons. For the creature
[1:28:59] was made subject to vanity, not willing,
[1:29:01] not by its own will. When man fell, all
[1:29:05] of a sudden earth is cursed.
[1:29:08] What did I do? What what did the earth
[1:29:09] what did the lamb do? Not willingly, but
[1:29:12] by reason of him who hath subjected the
[1:29:15] same by reason. God's purpose was to do
[1:29:18] it. who did it, subjected it to vanity
[1:29:23] in hope,
[1:29:26] not uh not for no reason.
[1:29:31] Because the creature itself also shall
[1:29:34] be delivered from the bondage of
[1:29:35] corruption into
[1:29:38] the glorious liberty of the children of
[1:29:42] God.
[1:29:43] is under bondage now and it longs to be
[1:29:47] under subjection
[1:29:49] to the glorious liberty of the children
[1:29:51] of God. That even though they're subject
[1:29:54] its liberty and it longs to be delivered
[1:29:56] to the glorious liberty of the children
[1:29:59] of God. For we know the whole creation
[1:30:02] groanth and travaleth like a woman in
[1:30:05] labor. It's pregnant. It's groaning and
[1:30:07] travailing in pain together until now.
[1:30:10] Yes.
[1:30:11] Oh, can you just God grant us the
[1:30:13] revelation that all creation travails
[1:30:16] not because man sinned, but because
[1:30:18] redemption is what all creation was made
[1:30:22] for.
[1:30:24] It was made for redemption. It expresses
[1:30:26] redemption. It says, "For 6,000 years,
[1:30:29] we've been telling the story of
[1:30:32] redemption. We were made for this. You
[1:30:34] were made for this all. One day, we're
[1:30:37] going to be loosed into the sons." the
[1:30:40] manifestation of sons
[1:30:43] and all creation is grown and in
[1:30:44] travailing not because of sin but
[1:30:46] because that's what all creation was
[1:30:48] made for. It was made for redemption
[1:30:55] and not only they but ourselves also
[1:30:59] which have the first fruits of the
[1:31:01] spirit which is the earnest of
[1:31:04] redemption. Even we grown within
[1:31:06] ourselves waiting for the adoption to it
[1:31:09] the redemption
[1:31:11] of our body.
[1:31:14] What does it say in Corinthians? The
[1:31:15] second the first man is earth earthy.
[1:31:19] The second man is the Lord of heaven.
[1:31:22] We've come in this earthly tabernacle.
[1:31:25] So we're earthy.
[1:31:27] As it is 1 Corinthians 15, as it is the
[1:31:30] heavenly and such are they also that are
[1:31:32] heavenly. And as we have borne the image
[1:31:34] of the earthly, we shall also bear the
[1:31:37] image of the heavenly.
[1:31:41] It's a promise. Why? Because the first
[1:31:44] Adam was made a living soul. The last
[1:31:46] Adam is made a quickening spirit. This
[1:31:50] is the promise of Genesis 1:28.
[1:31:53] I'm going to close with this here. Just
[1:31:55] two two more statements. one we're very
[1:31:56] quick to read
[1:31:59] and and we'll
[1:32:02] it's 11:59.
[1:32:06] This is the promise of Genesis 1:28.
[1:32:10] Please don't fail to miss this part. I
[1:32:12] I've been last service. This is where
[1:32:14] even now I wanted to come to this place
[1:32:16] just to provoke our thinking. Don't fail
[1:32:18] to miss this purpose of God. From the
[1:32:20] beginning, Adam and the woman were
[1:32:23] granted power to replenish and subdue
[1:32:26] the earth. Replenish, satisfy the earth.
[1:32:30] And here it says, all creation is
[1:32:32] growing in travailing together in pain
[1:32:34] until now. What are they waiting for?
[1:32:36] They're waiting. Creation is waiting for
[1:32:38] the manifestation of the sons of God.
[1:32:41] Christ proved that what Adam lost in the
[1:32:43] fall could be restored back to mankind.
[1:32:47] So Christ represents something. But he's
[1:32:49] not just a living soul. He's a
[1:32:51] quickening spirit. And so what Adam and
[1:32:54] the woman lost, the power to multiply,
[1:32:57] to be fruitful, and then to replenish
[1:32:59] and subdue the earth, that's brought
[1:33:01] back to man through Christ because he
[1:33:03] laid down his life and he was granted
[1:33:05] power to raise it up again. So the very
[1:33:08] body that died and it laid in a grave
[1:33:11] came up again.
[1:33:13] But now I want you to think so
[1:33:15] beautifully. Now it's there there's
[1:33:17] power in the seed to subdue the earth
[1:33:22] and our bodies come from the earth
[1:33:24] and all our bodies were laid out in the
[1:33:26] earth. So brother Brandham says in power
[1:33:28] of transformation there was Adam and Eve
[1:33:31] walking in the garden every seed
[1:33:33] bringing forth. He says there is where
[1:33:35] we're facing yet the completion of that
[1:33:37] word. We are not just to be fruitful,
[1:33:40] multiply, and replenish the earth, which
[1:33:42] is to satisfy the earth's purpose and
[1:33:44] get a bride out of it. But there must
[1:33:46] come a people that subdue the earth.
[1:33:49] Amen.
[1:33:50] There's a there's there's something
[1:33:52] you're taking under subjection. There
[1:33:54] must be a subduing of the flesh, a
[1:33:56] subduing of the dust. There's power then
[1:33:58] granted to the bride to subdue the
[1:34:01] flesh.
[1:34:04] Power for redemption, power for
[1:34:06] resurrection. Because brother Bam says
[1:34:08] there'll come a time when you'll not
[1:34:09] only have to have power to heal your
[1:34:11] body, but you will have to have power to
[1:34:14] what? Change it.
[1:34:17] Christ was given power to raise it up
[1:34:18] again, but then you have been given
[1:34:21] power to change it.
[1:34:24] It's subduing the earth. And this was
[1:34:27] always part of God's plan.
[1:34:30] Sister Elizabeth, if you'd come. Always
[1:34:32] part of God's plan.
[1:34:35] In the message, conflict between God and
[1:34:36] Satan.
[1:34:38] Now, try to just follow me. Don't get
[1:34:39] ahead of me because you'll steal my
[1:34:40] thunder. But God at the beginning gave
[1:34:43] his children the atomic weapon because
[1:34:45] he's the infinite God. Now, seeing there
[1:34:49] was going to be a conflict and there's
[1:34:51] going to be a battle,
[1:34:53] God equipped his children with the right
[1:34:55] kind of ammunition, the right kind of
[1:34:58] attack, the right kind of everything
[1:35:00] that they had need of. And notice his
[1:35:02] language that would sweep them all the
[1:35:05] way from Eden to the rapture.
[1:35:09] What was it? The word. So when God gave
[1:35:12] the man and the woman the word, he knew
[1:35:15] one day there would be a rapture, be
[1:35:18] fruitful, multiply, replenish the earth.
[1:35:21] But there's also power to subdue it,
[1:35:25] to subdue the earth. It was prophecy of
[1:35:28] an end time bride that would take a new
[1:35:30] body to it to be clothed upon
[1:35:34] a union of a theophony and a glorified
[1:35:37] body that we would have a body liken
[1:35:39] unto his own glorious body. The
[1:35:41] sufferings of this present time are not
[1:35:43] worthy to be compared to the glory which
[1:35:46] shall be revealed in us.
[1:35:49] He gave Adam power
[1:35:53] that would sweep him
[1:35:56] all the way from Eden
[1:35:58] to a rapture.
[1:36:01] The prophecy of Genesis 1:28
[1:36:04] prophesied the rapture. So, is this the
[1:36:07] accident of sin?
[1:36:09] Is this the accident of the Antichrist
[1:36:11] church working against the church,
[1:36:12] making it lukewarm and powerless? Is
[1:36:14] this the accident? This is always an
[1:36:16] accident. Man, God had a great church in
[1:36:17] the day of Pentecost. What happened?
[1:36:18] Another accident. Oh, man. It went into
[1:36:21] the ground. Oh, what? It's always an
[1:36:23] accident. No, it's always his plan.
[1:36:27] So that there be a bride on the earth in
[1:36:29] the last day. That could put a period on
[1:36:31] Genesis 1:28.
[1:36:34] This body has been fruitful. It's
[1:36:36] multiplying. We're in the season of full
[1:36:38] replenishment and subduing the earth.
[1:36:42] It's the purpose that he's raised us up
[1:36:44] for in this last day. This is what we
[1:36:46] see in the beginning when God created
[1:36:48] our very purpose.
[1:36:50] Let's stand to our feet.
[1:36:55] [Music]
[1:37:16] Let's bow our heads in a word of prayer.
[1:37:18] [Music]
[1:37:22] Our
[1:37:25] [Music]
[1:37:27] gracious heavenly father,
[1:37:30] we bow our hearts before you today
[1:37:34] and we express love and thanksgiving to
[1:37:36] you for your goodness and your kindness
[1:37:41] and your mercy.
[1:37:44] And Lord, as we have looked into your
[1:37:46] word, we see a beautiful theme
[1:37:47] unfolding.
[1:37:51] And Lord, I would not, it is not my
[1:37:53] purpose to be cute with scripture,
[1:37:59] to get fancy with quotations of brother
[1:38:01] Brandham,
[1:38:02] [Music]
[1:38:03] but I desire that your people be
[1:38:05] blessed, that they be edified and
[1:38:08] encouraged.
[1:38:10] And Lord, the opening of the seven seals
[1:38:12] is not some great pie in the sky mystery
[1:38:17] that produces something outside of
[1:38:19] scripture, but it brings us back to your
[1:38:23] original intent in the beginning.
[1:38:26] Let it become relevant to us in our
[1:38:28] everyday life.
[1:38:30] Let it have purpose and meaning to us as
[1:38:33] redeemed sinners. Let it have purpose
[1:38:36] and meaning to us as parents, as
[1:38:38] spouses, as loved ones, as laborers.
[1:38:42] Lord, may this word have meaning in
[1:38:44] every area of our life. And Lord, may it
[1:38:47] all be within this per this view that is
[1:38:50] this is the hour in which mortality
[1:38:53] shall be swallowed up of life.
[1:38:56] That there's a clothed upon that you
[1:38:58] foresaw in the beginning. that there's a
[1:39:01] body that was waiting and that we are
[1:39:04] granted in this hour power to subdue to
[1:39:07] take a body that has death in it and by
[1:39:10] the word of God transform it to where
[1:39:12] it'll never die.
[1:39:15] We're in partaking of this word we're
[1:39:17] feeding on the word and a new body is
[1:39:19] taking shape and forming us around the
[1:39:21] word that's inside of us. Lord, what a
[1:39:23] privilege in this hour. Lord, may we
[1:39:26] then by the word take your weapon that
[1:39:28] you gave us, this atomic bomb, which is
[1:39:31] the word that was to sweep Adam all the
[1:39:33] way from Eden to the rapture. May we now
[1:39:36] in this end time, take a hold of the
[1:39:38] original spoken word seed. And may we
[1:39:41] allow it to sweep us to a change.
[1:39:45] May we not fall short of any promise.
[1:39:49] Take you at your word and believe you
[1:39:50] with all of our hearts. I pray Lord that
[1:39:53] you bless your people through their
[1:39:54] diligence, their faithfulness to listen
[1:39:56] to lengthy sermons like this, Lord, and
[1:39:59] desire to catch your pulse, your
[1:40:01] heartbeat, not just the phrasings of
[1:40:03] man. And as they've been intent and been
[1:40:06] purposeful and diligent to listen, may
[1:40:08] you now, Father, reward them with
[1:40:10] revelation.
[1:40:12] Strengthen them, I pray, in the in man
[1:40:14] inner man, Lord. And may this be
[1:40:16] relevant to us this evening, tomorrow.
[1:40:20] We grant we just commit the people to
[1:40:23] you Lord and may you bless us father in
[1:40:27] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:40:30] [Music]
