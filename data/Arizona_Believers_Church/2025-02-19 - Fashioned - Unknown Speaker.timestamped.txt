[0:00] 1 Corinthians chapter 7 verse 29 but
[0:03] this I say Brethren the time is short it
[0:07] remaineth that both they that have wives
[0:09] be as though they had none very peculiar
[0:12] statement and so it's kind of these
[0:14] opposites those that have wives should
[0:16] have a be as though they didn't have
[0:19] wives and you'll see in a moment why but
[0:20] then he says and they that weep as
[0:22] though they wept not and they that
[0:23] rejoice as though they Rejoice not and
[0:25] they that buy as though they possessed
[0:27] not and they that use this world as not
[0:31] abusing it for the fashion of this world
[0:34] passeth away but I would have you
[0:36] without carefulness he that is unmarried
[0:38] carth for the things that belong to the
[0:39] Lord how he may please the Lord but he
[0:43] that is married carry for careth for the
[0:45] things that are of the world how he may
[0:47] please his wife there is difference also
[0:51] between a wife and a virgin the
[0:52] unmarried woman carth for the things of
[0:54] the Lord that she may be holy both in
[0:56] body and in spirit but she that is
[0:59] married carth for the things of the
[1:00] world how she may please her husband and
[1:02] this I speak for your own profit not
[1:04] that I may cast a snare upon you but for
[1:06] that which is comely and that you may
[1:08] attend upon the Lord without
[1:11] distraction amen you can have your
[1:14] seats my title is fashioned and just
[1:18] that one word fashioned I'm drawing it
[1:20] from the scripture here where it says
[1:21] that the fashion of this world passes
[1:24] away and I was going to maybe pose the
[1:26] question fashioned is it the word or is
[1:29] it the word world that is fashioning us
[1:31] I just want to take this idea of not
[1:33] just fashion but being fashioned or
[1:36] fashioned or formed or shaped on Sunday
[1:39] we took the title of deceptive form and
[1:43] used maybe the thesis that there shapes
[1:45] and forms that leading us away from true
[1:48] beauty and it does so through deception
[1:50] like kind of catching our eye and
[1:52] drawing us away of our own lust and so
[1:55] there's things that meet the eye and
[1:56] certain images that would cause us to be
[1:59] led as stray and we were looking in
[2:01] particular at
[2:03] Deuteronomy
[2:04] 22:5 I think this is a um a welln
[2:08] scripture in the Bible and this is God
[2:10] giving them various laws he said the
[2:12] woman shall not wear that which
[2:14] pertaineth unto a man neither shall a
[2:16] man put on a woman's garment for all
[2:19] that do so are Abomination unto the Lord
[2:22] thy God it's not making a distinction
[2:25] that the Garment itself is abomination
[2:27] but rather one that would wear in dress
[2:30] in a way that a man would dress in a way
[2:32] that looks like a woman that displeases
[2:34] the Lord or a woman dressing in a way to
[2:37] appear as a man that would be
[2:39] displeasing that's what Abomination
[2:40] maybe in its most simple way is it does
[2:43] not please God it has carries kind of a
[2:45] sense of something disgusting uh but
[2:47] even that repulsion or that hatred that
[2:50] God would have for something is a
[2:52] consequence of what God loves God's just
[2:54] not hating something uh out of uh
[2:57] preference but rather it's a consequence
[3:00] of him loving something loving Purity
[3:02] and loving wholeness and so if something
[3:04] is not whole or something is perverse
[3:07] God is displeased by it and as the
[3:10] scripture is saying that a woman should
[3:12] dress as a woman a man should dress as a
[3:14] man and one ought not to dress in a way
[3:16] that would confuse that we know that the
[3:18] natures of a man and a woman are
[3:21] different by God's design God designed
[3:24] it that way and in that their Natures
[3:27] are different there's something to be
[3:28] honored in how one would dress and even
[3:31] how one would act we find that the
[3:32] scripture does a lot of arranging man to
[3:35] one another husbands to wives wives to
[3:37] husband and the word addresses a lot of
[3:40] arrangement how we all fit together and
[3:42] how we respect authority and things to
[3:44] that extent so that's uh that's kind of
[3:47] the quick catch up from Sunday now if
[3:50] you look at 1 Corinthians chapter 7 I'd
[3:52] like to start with verse 29 and we'll
[3:54] just read to uh verse 31 but this I say
[3:58] Brethren the time is short it remaineth
[4:00] that both they that have wives be as
[4:02] though they had none and they that weep
[4:04] as though they wept not and they that
[4:06] rejoice as though they rejoiced not and
[4:09] they that buy as though they possessed
[4:11] not and reading that it kind of does beg
[4:13] this what do you mean by that and maybe
[4:15] getting into that would be uh would be
[4:17] worth it for some but we're going to
[4:18] focus on verse 31 and they that use this
[4:22] world as not abusing it a lot of
[4:25] contrast in those that have wives though
[4:28] you don't have wives you that cry
[4:30] don't be as you're not weeping and
[4:32] rejoicing as though you aren't rejoicing
[4:33] and but then it says those that use the
[4:36] world be as don't abuse the world it
[4:39] says this for the fashion of this world
[4:41] passeth away I'm going to try to be very
[4:45] deliberate in how we go through this
[4:46] with uh the intent that we would wrap up
[4:48] at a decent time so that we could
[4:50] baptize brother Edward but he says they
[4:53] that use this world that use is to
[4:57] actually means to receive a loan or
[4:58] borrow from it says here the world to
[5:01] make use of the world so it's be by some
[5:03] help or agency of the world or by the
[5:05] means of the world uh you're getting
[5:07] something out of the world I think his
[5:10] brother Ernie Villa used to always say
[5:12] when he would go do his job and he would
[5:14] go speak at seminars he do he sell
[5:16] seminars he'd say I'm going to get a
[5:17] little gold out of Babylon and he knew
[5:20] that's where he was getting it but he
[5:21] was going to use that gold to further
[5:22] the kingdom and I was thinking of how
[5:25] that in the Exodus in Numbers Chapter 20
[5:28] and then even in chapter 21 one how that
[5:30] when Israel was on their way to the
[5:32] promised land and they needed to pass
[5:34] through Edom and they needed to pass
[5:35] through the amorites that they said we
[5:37] will you let us pass through and we're
[5:39] going to stay on the road and we're not
[5:42] going to venture off the path because we
[5:44] want to get to the promised land and
[5:46] we're not going to take of your crops
[5:47] and your fields and then they went so
[5:48] far as to say but if we did drink your
[5:51] water if we did take from your Vineyards
[5:52] we'll pay for it uh and but they were
[5:55] not going to get off the King's Highway
[5:58] they were not going to get off the path
[5:59] and so I kind of had that in mind when I
[6:01] thought well here those that are making
[6:03] their way through the world and they
[6:05] need jobs and need this and they need
[6:07] that we're making our way through the
[6:08] world we're using it uh but it says but
[6:11] don't abuse it now World here the word
[6:15] the Greek is Cosmos means the adorning
[6:18] or ornament a decoration or adornment
[6:20] it's kind of the harmonious Arrangement
[6:22] or condition of something now when might
[6:24] be I think we understand that word or
[6:26] we've gone through it before but they
[6:28] that use the this Cosmos this the world
[6:31] order and it's translated to adorning in
[6:35] 1 Peter 3:3 who adorning so that's the
[6:38] world whose World speaking to the women
[6:41] or to the to to Christian ladies whose
[6:43] world or who adorning who ornament or
[6:46] decoration let it not be that outward
[6:48] adorning of platting the hair and of
[6:50] wearing of gold or on putting on of
[6:53] apparel let's just be some real strict
[6:55] legalist if we took this and tried to
[6:57] translate it to mean let not your
[6:59] adorning be on the putting on of
[7:02] clothes where would we be as a church as
[7:06] Christians so there's something more to
[7:08] it than just saying wow if you braid
[7:10] your hair you're a sinner and if you
[7:11] wear gold you're you're you're a sinner
[7:13] no it say don't let your world uh
[7:17] be you trying to look attractive don't
[7:21] let your world be I'm trying to signal
[7:22] I'm trying to express uh and when I say
[7:25] signal I'm trying to express that I'm
[7:27] I'm beautiful and I've got this uh
[7:29] quality or I got this kind of hair I can
[7:30] do these certain things it's don't let
[7:32] your adorning or your world be all about
[7:36] those things so they that use or borrow
[7:39] from or make use of or use the agency of
[7:42] the world and all that it would have its
[7:43] order its Arrangement it's adoring as
[7:46] not abusing it the word there abusing
[7:49] means to use fully and so it's to use
[7:51] excessively it would even imply that you
[7:53] would not just use it but you would use
[7:55] all of it that if it's there I want to
[7:58] take all of it if I if it's an
[7:59] opportunity I want to take full
[8:00] advantage of it or I would use it to
[8:02] where I'm not just making use of it but
[8:04] I'm getting I'm getting everything out
[8:07] of it to the point to where it's a
[8:08] detriment now becomes harmful harmful
[8:11] it's no longer in its moderation so it
[8:13] has some sort of negative impact in The
[8:15] Exodus as the children of Israel were
[8:17] passing through Edom and they were not
[8:19] granted passage and then when they asked
[8:21] of the amorites if they should pass
[8:22] through uh not only did they say no but
[8:24] they gathered themselves against Israel
[8:26] to try to stop them but if they had they
[8:28] been granted passage uh they could have
[8:31] began to take so much of the world to
[8:33] where they would have owed more to Edom
[8:36] they would have owed more to the
[8:37] amorites or they say well you know this
[8:39] is a pretty nice uh plot of land here
[8:41] this is good ground let us stay here
[8:43] there was a point at which they would
[8:44] have made use of what was available to
[8:47] their
[8:48] detriment so it says they that use and I
[8:52] would say we all use this world how many
[8:55] here tonight got here by agency of
[8:57] traveling like a thought by Supernatural
[9:00] power my eyes I'm I'm watching here I
[9:02] want to see where we're at as a church
[9:04] well we've got a ways to go here and so
[9:06] we use the world on some level and I
[9:09] promise you if if someone from a couple
[9:11] hundred years ago saw what you drove to
[9:13] church tonight and how you made it to
[9:14] church they would say
[9:16] witchcraft sorcery we would have the
[9:19] Phoenix Witch Trials once again uh
[9:21] because there would be some kind of what
[9:22] kind of black magic is this uh but yet
[9:25] we use the world we made our way here
[9:27] tonight using things of the world but it
[9:29] says those that use the world and I
[9:31] would say all of us do don't make full
[9:34] use of it don't make your world about
[9:36] worldly things and it gives this reason
[9:39] for or because this is why it's the only
[9:41] one he really gives he does with respect
[9:44] to marriage this is the first one where
[9:46] he gives some sort of clarification
[9:48] because the fashion of this world passes
[9:51] away that word passes away actually
[9:53] means misleads or leads astray or leads
[9:56] aside and so you do get the sense that
[9:58] it departs or changes or it's uncertain
[10:01] world the world's fashion the fashion of
[10:04] this world misleads or leads aside it'll
[10:07] lead you on and the word fashion here is
[10:10] a Greek word schema and it's comprising
[10:13] everything in a person that strikes the
[10:15] senses so the schema the form of
[10:17] something the figure the bearing the the
[10:20] actual uh actions and the manner of Life
[10:23] The Habit and in particular the
[10:25] appearance of a person how a person
[10:27] appears is their fashion or their schema
[10:30] comes from the Latin word habitus did I
[10:32] get that right brother doctor did I get
[10:34] okay good that's the condition or the
[10:36] appearance or the dress of a person both
[10:39] in the Greek schema even in the Latin
[10:41] habitus it comes back to to have or to
[10:44] hold to Echo to to wear to be situated
[10:46] to think about something considerate to
[10:48] have in mind to manage or to keep how
[10:51] many of you use the term schema and your
[10:54] job or maybe your uh whatever field you
[10:56] might be in there's some sort of
[10:57] structured framework or a plan that's
[10:59] the schema that form the appearance it
[11:02] means the external condition and it's
[11:05] saying that the world schema its fashion
[11:08] its habitus its manner of life and its
[11:10] habits is always
[11:13] changing it's always Meandering it's
[11:16] always leading on it's not real stable
[11:18] and consistent it it its Fashions and
[11:20] its forms its passions and its Norms all
[11:22] those different things are always
[11:25] changing in Jeremiah CH 23:10 speak of
[11:29] the land of Israel it says in Judah for
[11:32] the land is full of adulterers for
[11:34] because of swearing the land mourneth
[11:36] and these false uh vows the pleasant
[11:39] places of the Wilderness are dried up
[11:41] and their course is evil and their force
[11:44] is not
[11:45] right the course is evil the force is
[11:48] not right this mode this style of
[11:50] running uh or course of life people just
[11:53] rushing into wickedness the force that
[11:56] might the influence the leadership the
[11:58] power the things that are driving things
[12:00] that are moving things are contrary to
[12:02] God's nature they're contrary to God's
[12:04] way so there's a force in that this time
[12:07] it says there's a course in the land
[12:09] there's a force in the land that is evil
[12:12] that is not right and Paul is saying
[12:14] that the world uh is always changing the
[12:17] Fashions of this world are passing away
[12:20] why because there's a force there's a
[12:22] course in this world that is not right
[12:25] courses and forces and things of this
[12:27] world that are shaping and forming
[12:29] what's normal what's acceptable what's
[12:32] ordinary would you agree that there's
[12:35] there's there's a influence and
[12:37] sometimes we can say it's societal
[12:38] pressure or it's economics but there's
[12:40] forces there's powers in the world that
[12:43] come to bear on things and make certain
[12:44] things acceptable or normal in Ephesians
[12:48] chap 2 veres 1 2 and 3 it says you hath
[12:51] he quickened who were dead in trespasses
[12:54] and sins so we rejoice in this verse
[12:56] that we have been made alive in Christ
[12:58] Jesus Jesus and now he does something
[13:00] which can be very sobering is he points
[13:02] back to what life was like before you
[13:04] were quickened where in time passed ye
[13:06] walked you lived you conducted yourself
[13:09] according to the course of this world
[13:12] the Bible told us the course is evil and
[13:15] according to the prince of the power of
[13:17] the air this is the force that is not
[13:19] right Paul says in Ephesians chapter 6
[13:22] that these are the things that we're
[13:23] fighting against the God of this age
[13:25] these principalities these powers of
[13:27] Darkness these rulers in high places
[13:29] says the prince of the power of the
[13:30] Earth the spirit that now worketh in the
[13:33] children of
[13:35] Disobedience so when we were in the
[13:37] world we did the things of the world by
[13:40] the force the course and the power of
[13:43] the world he calls it a spirit that
[13:46] works in Children of
[13:47] Disobedience among whom also those
[13:49] children we all had our lives our
[13:51] conversations in times past in the lust
[13:53] of our flesh fulfilling the desires of
[13:56] the Flesh and of the mind and were by
[13:58] Nature the children of Wrath even as
[14:01] others by this uh course of this world
[14:05] the prince of the power of the air
[14:07] appearance is always
[14:08] changing uh but the influence is always
[14:11] the same the Bible says the the the
[14:14] fashion of this world passeth away you
[14:17] say well it looks this way one time and
[14:18] it looks this way the next time but it's
[14:20] always the same influence it's an evil
[14:22] course it's a a a it's an incorrect
[14:25] Force here we see it's the course of
[14:26] this world the prince of the power of
[14:28] the air a spirit
[14:29] causing us to fulfill the lust of the
[14:31] Flesh and of our mind and it's the wrong
[14:34] kind of nature it may look different at
[14:37] different times but it's the same
[14:39] evil the Amplified Bible writes it this
[14:42] way in which at one time you walked
[14:44] habitually you were following the course
[14:46] and fashion of this world you were under
[14:47] the sway and tendency of the present age
[14:51] following the prince of the power of the
[14:52] air you were obedient to and under the
[14:54] control of the demon spirit that still
[14:57] constantly Works in sons of Disobedience
[15:00] the careless the rebellious the
[15:01] unbelieving who go against the purposes
[15:04] of God Amen now I'm taking time to cover
[15:07] this and again our service will be brief
[15:09] this evening just to show that there's
[15:11] powers that cause us to live even
[15:14] habitually in wickedness or sin being
[15:18] born in sin and by Nature being a fallen
[15:20] creature there's powers of Nature and
[15:22] nurture of the world that drive us to do
[15:24] things that are against God's nature and
[15:28] against the purposes of of God 1 John
[15:30] 2:16 tells us all that is in the world
[15:32] is the lust of the flesh the lust of the
[15:34] eyes and the pride of life which none of
[15:37] those things are of God but is of the
[15:40] world not the Natural Earth but of the
[15:43] world the cosmos its order it's it's
[15:46] shape its
[15:47] force
[15:52] and in in Romans 12: 2 I just I am
[15:56] grateful for your attentiveness tonight
[15:58] and your concentration it's it's very
[16:00] helpful he says and be not conformed to
[16:03] this world but be transformed by the
[16:06] renewing of your mind that you may prove
[16:09] what is that good and acceptable and
[16:11] perfect will of God so there's kind of
[16:13] two different things uh that we're being
[16:16] informed of to be conformed to this
[16:18] world or transformed into the perfect
[16:21] will of God the representation of what
[16:23] is good and acceptable and the perfect
[16:25] will of God a confirmation to the world
[16:27] or a transformation by the renewing of
[16:29] your mind to God's word and this word
[16:32] conformed it means to Fashion yourself
[16:35] according to to shape yourself to
[16:38] another's pattern uh one of my children
[16:41] shared with me something that uh their
[16:43] aunt aunt Anne shared with them and it
[16:45] was kind of funny because it said the
[16:47] the Press shape is putting in put into a
[16:50] shape press to be pressed into a press
[16:53] shape and it was just one of the it just
[16:55] keeps repeating itself over and over
[16:56] again a and so that if if you're going
[16:59] to be conformed you are going to be
[17:00] pressed into the shape of another shape
[17:03] you're going to be conformed it's to
[17:05] shape one thing like
[17:07] another now when that happens though
[17:09] this word that's being used it's used to
[17:12] describe what
[17:13] changes what easily changes and what is
[17:16] unstable so it's transitory so when
[17:18] you're conformed to this world it's not
[17:20] something permanent you're just kind of
[17:23] you ever taken a piece of paper and bald
[17:25] it up and throw it in the trash can and
[17:26] didn't think about about it again till
[17:28] about 1:00 in the morning and it sounds
[17:29] like there's just a whole pot of roaches
[17:30] in your trash can what's happening that
[17:33] shape you press that piece of paper into
[17:35] it was temporary now it begins to open
[17:37] up and it sounds
[17:39] like right and it sounds like
[17:41] something's moving in your trash can
[17:43] well this is the kind of conforming you
[17:45] you can be molded one way right you can
[17:47] be a total skater one day and then a
[17:48] punk the next and you can be a Roper the
[17:50] next and now you're going to be an
[17:51] athlete why you just kind of go with the
[17:53] flow and you change and your desires and
[17:55] taste will change because you conform to
[17:57] this world
[17:59] and it tells us that there is a pattern
[18:01] or form or a habit a look maybe even a
[18:04] style a way of life that is shaped and
[18:07] is overtly
[18:09] worldly I think we should all we should
[18:11] be able to accept that now we might have
[18:13] different definitions of what
[18:14] worldliness is but I believe as
[18:16] Christians who read the Bible we should
[18:18] know that there is a lifestyle there is
[18:20] a way of looking and dressing and acting
[18:23] that is overtly worldly because it's
[18:25] that which the world has shaped you into
[18:29] and it's only the renewing of our minds
[18:31] that will change us from the form of the
[18:32] world into a fashion approved by God
[18:37] it's only by the renewing of our minds
[18:39] that we can be changed from that one
[18:41] image or that that temporary unstable
[18:44] fashion into an approved image of
[18:48] God now I'm going to make some
[18:50] statements here that are just kind of
[18:52] summarizing a lot of things and if I
[18:54] could put it this way the bride's Cosmos
[18:57] the bride's Cosmos her order her world
[19:00] is the order and the arrangement and the
[19:02] fashion of the word we can have a world
[19:05] which is created by the word of God in
[19:07] the beginning God created the heavens
[19:09] and the Earth by his word so there is a
[19:11] world that is ordered by the word of God
[19:15] but then there is a world that has been
[19:17] perverted from the word of God and it's
[19:19] a different order it's a different
[19:20] Arrangement so we say in the beginning
[19:22] was the word that created all perfect
[19:24] things and in John 1 we find that in the
[19:28] beginning was the the word and that the
[19:29] word was made flesh in Jesus Christ amen
[19:33] I want I want you to think about those
[19:35] things that there is the word which
[19:36] creates all things that even when the
[19:38] world was in this mass of chaos God's
[19:41] spirit and the word worked upon that to
[19:44] bring forth order it was an
[19:46] indiscernible chaos and darkness was
[19:48] upon the face of the deep and so there
[19:50] is God loves order he loves simmetry he
[19:53] loves Beauty according to his word that
[19:55] word was made flesh in Jesus Christ and
[19:59] this is the world that's the world that
[20:01] God loves it's that original adornment
[20:05] that original Harmony it's the harmony
[20:07] of God with his
[20:09] creation and brother John was even
[20:12] fellowshipping with me on this at the
[20:13] very beginning of the year Cosmos in the
[20:15] Greek means good order in proper
[20:17] arrangement in the beginning God looked
[20:19] at his creation and said this is good
[20:21] this is very good that was his Cosmos
[20:24] and it's the same word and the same root
[20:26] that we get Cosmetics from or
[20:29] cosmetology cosmetology is the art of of
[20:33] beauty culture if something is cosmetic
[20:35] we realize that affects you say well
[20:37] that's just a cosmetic thing it's
[20:39] something that affects only the
[20:40] appearance of something so there's a lot
[20:42] of things maybe a lot of rabbit Trails
[20:44] we could go down with respect to
[20:45] cosmetology I would argue that maybe God
[20:47] was the first
[20:49] cosmetologist and that God uh was uh God
[20:52] was using cosmetics and different things
[20:55] and and I'll say it this way because to
[20:57] say that God looks upon the heart and
[21:00] that God is looking for substance and
[21:02] God looks for character is not to say
[21:04] that God disregards our
[21:06] appearance absolutely God doesn't see
[21:09] things as man sees it as uh uh Samuel
[21:11] said to about David say well we're
[21:13] looking at all the sons of uh Jesse and
[21:15] saying that the strong the tall the more
[21:17] accomplished the ones that to the eye
[21:19] look like a saw said those are the ones
[21:21] that we would make king and Samuel says
[21:24] God doesn't look upon the outward
[21:27] appearance he looks on the heart
[21:29] that that's what God is looking at is
[21:30] the substance and the character of
[21:32] somebody and so God is concerned about
[21:34] your heart he's concerned about what's
[21:36] on the inside God wants to see faith and
[21:39] that's what pleases him but that truth
[21:41] does not stand for another truth or does
[21:45] not stand for the proposition that God
[21:47] only cares about the heart and
[21:49] completely disregards our appearance
[21:51] that's right you can't that that that
[21:53] truth does not could not be used to
[21:55] argue that oh well it doesn't matter how
[21:56] we look that you could not take the
[21:58] Bible and construe it that way God's
[22:01] original Cosmetics were the word of God
[22:04] or was the word of God that was his
[22:06] adornment his arrangement his Harmony
[22:09] that harmonious
[22:10] Arrangement and this is I will say this
[22:14] is maybe a mouthful in saying this God
[22:17] wants even our physical appearance to
[22:20] portray a spiritual
[22:22] message that's what the Bible was
[22:24] concerned about even in the law that's
[22:27] why the New Testament is as has as much
[22:29] breath as it does is that God wants even
[22:31] our physical appearance to portray a
[22:35] spiritual message the word is the word
[22:38] is spirit and it's life and the word
[22:40] itself is uh seems to be something
[22:43] that's intangible spirituality is
[22:45] something that's intangible it's hard to
[22:47] uh you can't just get your fingers on it
[22:49] and it can be certainly mimicked and
[22:50] portrayed the wrong way and since the
[22:52] things that we believe in is a god that
[22:54] is unseen a world that is in another
[22:57] realm or a a word that is that is
[22:59] thought that is principle God wants your
[23:02] life and even your physical appearance
[23:04] to portray a message and to portray a
[23:07] truth and a reality that sometimes can
[23:09] be very Elusive and cannot be grasped
[23:12] God wants even the way that you appear
[23:15] to convey a spiritual message because
[23:17] it's necessary to convey
[23:20] Christ there's uh
[23:24] in none of us have I don't think any of
[23:26] us have ever stood in a lineup of
[23:29] suspects and number five police step
[23:32] forward right and they put everybody
[23:34] together and they're supposed to look a
[23:35] certain way and and they're going to say
[23:37] I'm going to look at all these people
[23:38] I'm try to figure out which one is the
[23:41] Christian and so God would want us if we
[23:44] were in a lineup he would want someone
[23:46] who would have enough knowledge of the
[23:48] word of God to look at a lineup go oh
[23:50] well I mean they're the ones that appear
[23:52] to be a Christian now it doesn't mean
[23:54] they absolutely are but there's some
[23:56] word basis for living holy and righteous
[24:00] and living above the things of the world
[24:02] where God wants our lives our our
[24:04] conduct our response to things our
[24:06] language and even the way that we dress
[24:08] to to portray his word and his
[24:11] character as we've used this quite often
[24:14] Titus 2: 11 and 12 for the grace of God
[24:17] that bringeth salvation hath appeared to
[24:19] all men teaching us that denying
[24:23] ungodliness and worldly lust we should
[24:26] live soberly righteously and godly
[24:28] in this present
[24:32] World righteousness godliness the
[24:36] spiritual sobriety never changes when it
[24:40] comes to God's word or God's Cosmos or
[24:42] God's world this is never out of fashion
[24:45] to live righteously and soberly and
[24:47] godly and and to Titus he's saying in
[24:50] this present world in the time that
[24:52] we're living now Grace is teaching us
[24:54] how to do
[24:55] so not under the law and under this
[24:58] thing that was maybe uh too much
[25:00] Cosmetics to where there's nothing
[25:02] changed in the heart but those of us
[25:04] who've experienced this regeneration by
[25:06] the baptism of the Holy Ghost you who
[25:08] have now been quickened who have been
[25:09] made alive in Christ Jesus who are to
[25:12] put on the new man who is renewed in
[25:13] Holiness and righteousness that we are
[25:15] to live Godly deny ungodliness deny
[25:19] worldly lust and live above the world
[25:23] but yet in this present
[25:25] world if there's something that God
[25:28] hates hates if something God hates
[25:30] becomes socially acceptable God doesn't
[25:32] change his
[25:34] mind God doesn't say I hate this sin a a
[25:38] and everyone's like we hate it too God
[25:40] we hate it this is horrible and then
[25:42] some time passes and all of a sudden
[25:43] everybody's like well we don't know if
[25:45] it's as bad as we thought it was and God
[25:46] says well you the people have
[25:50] spoken I guess I I'll take it you know
[25:53] we'll just we'll forget about it and
[25:55] Malachi says just because I haven't
[25:57] punished you for your evil Deeds doesn't
[26:00] mean my attitude towards evil Deeds have
[26:05] changed now I want to use an example of
[26:08] this because what we've hopefully led up
[26:10] to this point is this idea that there is
[26:12] a fashion of this world it's even a look
[26:16] it's a portrayal it's a cosmetic it's
[26:17] something this order of this Arrangement
[26:19] and it's always changing and yet there's
[26:21] a God who is
[26:23] unchanging and who wants even by our
[26:26] physical appearance to not be passioned
[26:28] after the world he even wants us to have
[26:30] a godliness in the way that we would
[26:32] look and it's closely connected with the
[26:35] word of God now as I've been looking at
[26:38] these things there is a gentleman from
[26:40] uh Great Britain whose name was James
[26:42] lver and he was uh actually a curator at
[26:45] a
[26:46] museum and I wanted he came up with
[26:49] these laws of fashion was first
[26:51] published in 1937 so I updated some of
[26:53] the language he said like the current
[26:56] Trend or the current fashion which would
[26:58] be smart you know what would be in today
[27:00] in the now right now would be smart we
[27:02] would say it's Swag or drip and that's
[27:04] what we'll use for all the adults here
[27:06] so we can all be on the same page right
[27:08] now presently whatever is
[27:11] fashionable uh people like well that
[27:13] that that looks sweet or that's spiffy
[27:15] that's sharp that's smart that's elegant
[27:17] whatever the words might be uh to
[27:20] describe what looks really good that's a
[27:22] fire fit or a lit fit whatever it might
[27:24] be now the his law I'm going to do it
[27:27] maybe a little bit backwards but his law
[27:28] says that in one year if you were
[27:31] dressed the right now a year from today
[27:33] in 2026 if you were dressed in the style
[27:37] that was drip a year ago now you're
[27:39] basic right right adults that's what we
[27:42] would say if somebody was wearing
[27:43] something or you would it would be dowy
[27:46] right that that's that's not cool that's
[27:49] basic it's so last minute 10 years after
[27:54] the present fashion was dri 10 years
[27:57] later the laws of pass say that it would
[27:59] be cringe to dress that
[28:01] way and then if you go 20 years it would
[28:03] be
[28:04] ridiculous and if you went 30 years it
[28:06] would be kind of amusing at that point
[28:08] right it be more costume and then but 50
[28:11] years it's there's a quaintness to it
[28:14] you go 70 years it's charming and then
[28:16] finally after 100 years it's romantic
[28:18] and then 150 years it's
[28:20] beautiful why because through the
[28:22] passage of time at one time that's hot
[28:25] that's what we like right there that
[28:27] that's that's what is uh that's what all
[28:30] the fashionable people are doing and
[28:32] then a year later it's like you're still
[28:34] wearing that that's so basic and then if
[28:37] you keep wearing it you get to be cringe
[28:39] it gets ridiculous amusing but then
[28:41] it'll work its way back to where it's
[28:42] not necessarily drip again but it's it's
[28:45] romantic it's beautiful there there's
[28:47] some sort of nostalgia to it now this is
[28:50] the part I really wanted I wanted you to
[28:52] see in these laws of fashion five years
[28:55] earlier it was Shameless
[28:59] one I guess I got my order mixed up here
[29:01] let's just put them all up there one
[29:03] year earlier to have dressed a certain
[29:05] way would have been
[29:06] daring 5 years earlier it would have
[29:09] been Shameless 10 years earlier
[29:12] indecent so one thing that at one time
[29:15] now notice how the laws of fashion work
[29:18] that in 2015 there could have been
[29:19] something that if you dress that way and
[29:21] I think we have to go further back to
[29:22] the 1930s to really get our heads around
[29:24] this that in 1915 if you were dressed a
[29:27] certain way it would have been illegal
[29:28] it would have been scandalous it would
[29:30] have been
[29:31] indecent and then in 5 years it's not so
[29:34] much illegal and indecent but you don't
[29:37] have any shame you don't have any
[29:39] respect and then a few years later ooh
[29:42] that's pushing the envelope that's
[29:44] that's daring but then what was indecent
[29:47] which became Shameless but then just
[29:49] became a little edgy then becomes drip
[29:52] becomes acceptable becomes fashionable
[29:54] and the very thing that was
[29:57] indecent because something that's
[29:58] embraced is fashionable and then once it
[30:01] runs its course it becomes basic it
[30:02] becomes cringe but then even look it
[30:04] back it could be beautiful and what we
[30:06] might call beautiful today 150 years ago
[30:08] could have been indecent and vulgar
[30:11] then and these are the laws of
[30:15] fashion this is exactly what Paul is
[30:17] pointing out when it comes to the things
[30:19] of this world and the Fashions of this
[30:21] world passing away is it one time the
[30:24] world could be up in arms and literally
[30:26] Pearl clutching because some is vulgar
[30:29] and indecent but give it some time and
[30:31] it might become Shameless then it
[30:32] becomes daring and oh that's really
[30:34] Progressive you're on the edge then it
[30:36] becomes socially acceptable it becomes
[30:38] fashionable and then the rest is more
[30:40] fashion turning against itself instead
[30:43] of society itself gaining a moral
[30:45] compass and having some right attitude
[30:48] toward sin this is how the world
[30:51] works and what I want you to think about
[30:54] tonight is the fact that if something
[30:56] was in fact indecent Abomination or
[30:58] disgusting or displeasing to God God's
[31:01] law does not change the present fashion
[31:04] and how that you ought to live soberly
[31:06] righteously and godly in this present
[31:07] world if God had a drip it wouldn't
[31:10] change wouldn't become basic wouldn't
[31:12] become romantic it would have never been
[31:14] indecent or Shameless though to the
[31:16] world it might seem to be cringe or it
[31:18] might seem to be quaint or homely but to
[31:20] God those things are always in fashion
[31:23] because God never
[31:26] changes brother bradam and the sermon
[31:28] does God ever change his mind about his
[31:30] word he says see the politics and things
[31:33] how they're trying to join the church
[31:35] together by a politics in the church
[31:37] we're not joined to Christ by politics
[31:40] we're joined the church to Christ by the
[31:42] baptism of the Holy Ghost and the way
[31:44] you know the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[31:46] is because that Spirit In You identifies
[31:48] every word of God to be the truth for
[31:51] whosoever shall take one word out of it
[31:53] or add one word to it his part will be
[31:55] taken from The Book of Life
[31:58] yet he prospers you say you can't
[32:01] believe that by Prosperity you can't
[32:04] judge God by Prosperity the world
[32:06] prospers balam prospered by it brother
[32:09] you judge God by his word he keeps his
[32:12] word and identifies it the truth so
[32:15] remember friend as long as you live
[32:18] don't you ever forget this God does not
[32:21] change his mind yet he will bless he
[32:24] will let you go his permissive will but
[32:26] he won't change his mind he won't change
[32:30] his plan he won't change his word for
[32:33] you no sir you have got to change you
[32:37] can't have God's word to match your
[32:39] experience you've got to have your
[32:40] experience to match God's word there's
[32:44] no way that we could take the church
[32:45] ages or the Bible or the history of
[32:47] Israel and and take it and come up with
[32:50] God's law of fashion and find that God
[32:53] 10 years ago considered something
[32:55] indecent and 5 years later just
[32:57] considered it Shameless and then a year
[32:58] later considered it daring and then
[33:00] God's like I like this this is good
[33:02] God's like that's fire stick with it a
[33:04] little bit and then a year later go well
[33:06] that's kind of basic Christians and but
[33:07] we need to find the latest and greatest
[33:10] the next thing that has the people
[33:11] moving why the fashion of this world is
[33:14] always
[33:15] changing something that was indecent
[33:18] years ago now people don't even think
[33:20] twice about because that's how the world
[33:23] the world
[33:25] works now in Philippians chapter 2 verse
[33:30] 8 so we read earlier and I maybe I'll
[33:32] just read it again quickly here we we're
[33:34] doing really good on time I just have uh
[33:36] three more scriptures and we'll wrap it
[33:39] up and it says and they that use this
[33:42] world is not abusing it for the fashion
[33:45] of this world passeth away that Cosmos
[33:48] that adorning that decoration that
[33:52] Arrangement or
[33:53] Constitution speaking of Jesus Christ it
[33:56] says and he Christ being found
[33:58] in
[33:59] fashion as a
[34:01] man this
[34:03] fashion of the world the world Cosmos
[34:06] the fashion of this world
[34:09] schema he was found in fashion the
[34:11] schema as a man he humbled himself and
[34:15] became obedient unto death even the
[34:17] death of the
[34:19] Cross so there is the fashion of this
[34:21] world there's a cosmos uh that has a
[34:24] scheme or fashion and the Bible says
[34:26] that Jesus Christ was found in the form
[34:29] the appearance or the fashion the
[34:31] external condition of a man but he still
[34:34] humbled himself to God they didn't view
[34:37] Jesus as some an alien life form they
[34:40] didn't view him a a as an outlier as a
[34:43] matter of fact that's what made him so
[34:45] mad is it's like you are a common
[34:47] ordinary 50-year-old looking man born of
[34:51] a c Carpenter you got some rumors about
[34:53] maybe where you come from and he was so
[34:55] common that it enraged them there was
[34:58] nothing about him that distinguished him
[35:01] and his form or his Constitution or his
[35:04] appearance Jesus Christ was found in the
[35:07] schema and the fashion as a
[35:11] man he would we could I could even say
[35:14] that he would use this world but he
[35:15] didn't abuse
[35:17] it and although the fashion of this
[35:20] world is always changing God's word
[35:23] remains
[35:25] unchanged Christ was found in fashion
[35:28] the schema the habitus in the habit and
[35:31] manner of Life as a
[35:34] man he would eat he would sleep he wore
[35:38] clothes like they wore he wept as they
[35:42] wept in every way he was tempted like as
[35:45] any other man would have been
[35:47] tempted and so Christ in the form of a
[35:50] man remained obedient to God he humbled
[35:53] himself and was obedient to God's
[35:55] purpose it's the same to today Christ in
[35:58] the form of human beings never
[36:00] changes now
[36:02] the Christ was found in the fashion as a
[36:06] man in the condition then that first
[36:08] century Christ looked like a man of the
[36:11] first century and Christ today as we've
[36:13] used the phrase the 21st century Christ
[36:15] may look just like a man in the 21st
[36:17] century but there's going to be
[36:19] something unchanging about his nature
[36:21] and his ways right the Bible says be not
[36:25] conformed to this world as it says in
[36:27] Romans 8:29 for whom he did Forno he
[36:30] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[36:33] the image of his son that he might be
[36:35] the first born among many Brethren
[36:37] Christ Jesus Christ was found in the
[36:39] schema the appearance as a man but yet
[36:43] he was without sin there was a
[36:45] righteousness there was a rectitude
[36:47] there was Integrity there was something
[36:49] in the way that he could live in that
[36:50] world in that present world and live
[36:52] above the
[36:53] world it wasn't some overt over-the-top
[36:57] uh ttoo or something he carried around a
[36:59] sign it's only the 21st century
[37:01] Antichrist that carry a sign saying I'm
[37:03] Jesus right and and identify themselves
[37:06] in that way Christ allowed his Works to
[37:08] speak he allowed he he he he
[37:10] demonstrated a character in the way that
[37:12] he lived his
[37:14] life and so now those who are forn or
[37:17] predestinated to be I I believe I'm
[37:20] speaking to those tonight to be
[37:22] conformed to the image of
[37:24] Christ the Bible says be not conformed
[37:27] to this world but be transformed and now
[37:29] it says that we're to be conformed to
[37:31] the image of his son though the word is
[37:33] the same in the English conformed to the
[37:36] world or conformed to the sun two
[37:39] different words in the
[37:41] Greek in Romans chapter 12 it's
[37:43] conformed to this world is that which is
[37:45] temporary changeable and unstable here
[37:48] it speaks of that which is the essence
[37:51] in
[37:52] character that which is complete end
[37:55] durable not just merely a form or an
[37:58] outline so we're to be conformed to the
[38:01] image of his son that means there is
[38:04] some expression and listen your duty is
[38:07] to express Christ I like how it's even
[38:09] sometimes used in uh in the telling of
[38:12] the book of Acts that to go and uh heal
[38:15] the sick and save the lost and and to
[38:17] rescue this and to do that and then
[38:19] after all these things it says and use
[38:20] words if
[38:21] necessary why because there's a way that
[38:24] you can live your life that is
[38:25] expressing that is declaring and it is
[38:28] your duty to express Christ not so much
[38:31] in just our words though our words must
[38:33] carry some weight and be used as a a
[38:35] Christian currency to win others and our
[38:38] speech to be seasoned with salt so it's
[38:39] certainly a component of that but we
[38:41] cannot just blend in completely with the
[38:44] world and expect that through some sort
[38:46] of Osmosis or nearness that the point is
[38:48] going to get across God wants us to
[38:50] dress and act like Christian men to
[38:53] dress and act like Christian
[38:55] women so that his message can be heard
[38:58] and to be conformed to the image of his
[38:59] son it speaks to something is durable in
[39:02] its nature so that what is expressed is
[39:05] not
[39:06] temporary it's not just a form or an
[39:09] outline though the form is there its
[39:12] heart its core is
[39:14] durable the essence in
[39:17] character he reading where in these
[39:20] different places
[39:21] about uh God not changing his mind I
[39:25] can't remember now if this was invisible
[39:26] Union but God praying he says God mold
[39:29] me and make me different do something
[39:32] God make me in your fashion I know
[39:35] that's a heart work something that takes
[39:37] place here but what works here works
[39:40] out that's right it it's going to
[39:43] broadcast it's going to share it's going
[39:46] to express do you realize that it's been
[39:48] our lives that have in has
[39:50] inappropriately framed the gospel at
[39:53] times I I I would not want to take your
[39:56] experience of away from you and as much
[39:58] as you've all known me I wouldn't want
[40:00] you to take it away from me but we know
[40:01] one another's weaknesses and we've made
[40:03] mistakes but yet we realize that inside
[40:05] of each one of you there's a genuine
[40:06] experience with Christ there's a love
[40:08] for the word of God there's a passion
[40:10] for the things go there's a desire to
[40:12] serve God but we realize sometimes our
[40:14] attitudes our responses the way that
[40:15] we've handled situations maybe even the
[40:17] way that we dress and the things that
[40:19] we've done has inappropriately framed
[40:21] the gospel and caused it to look in a
[40:23] way that's not attractive to God and
[40:25] worse yet unattractive to the world or
[40:29] to those that are thirsty a lot of the
[40:31] ugliness that we see today in
[40:33] Christianity so-called Christianity is
[40:35] not the nature and spirit of
[40:38] Christ let's I I was fellowshipping with
[40:40] a brother about this even today how a
[40:42] lot of the initiatives on diversity and
[40:45] equity and inclusion we would have never
[40:47] needed it if CH if America had remained
[40:49] a Christian
[40:50] Nation that's because we would just
[40:52] would have you know beat up all the
[40:54] Sinners no Christians are not spiteful
[40:57] and
[40:58] hateful Christians are not concerned
[41:00] with uh with Brute Force tactics and and
[41:03] shaming people no they would you know
[41:05] the Bible actually tells us to shame the
[41:07] ones who pre say they're Christians and
[41:09] do things ungodly not the ungodly who
[41:12] are all about it right it's the one
[41:13] who's claiming to be a brother who's
[41:15] doing things that are ungodly he says
[41:16] that's the person you put to an open
[41:19] shame that's what the Bible says and the
[41:22] our nature our character disposition it
[41:25] ought to be in such a way I know I'm a
[41:27] broken record I keep repeating myself
[41:29] over and over again please forgive me if
[41:31] it is becomes worrisome but even down to
[41:34] the way that we're dressing we need to
[41:36] convey the humility of
[41:40] Christ John chapter
[41:42] 17 verses 14 to
[41:50] 18 consider this maybe for uh one of the
[41:53] upcoming services on this particular
[41:56] subject the Bible says that friendship
[41:59] of the world is enity with
[42:01] God some sort of where you say well I've
[42:04] Got Friends in the world no that's not
[42:05] what it's saying I really like my boss
[42:08] that's not what it's saying there's some
[42:10] Affinity some connection and
[42:12] relationship to the world that puts you
[42:14] in opposition to
[42:17] God there's a way that we can be spoiled
[42:19] after the rudiments of this world that
[42:21] put us in competition against the
[42:25] purpose of God
[42:27] the spirit which we have received is not
[42:29] the spirit of the world but the spirit
[42:31] of
[42:32] God we've been chosen he says in John 15
[42:35] out of the
[42:37] world but notice how he prays in John 17
[42:40] I have given them Thy word and the world
[42:45] hath hated
[42:47] them because they you to whom the word
[42:50] of the Lord is come they are not of the
[42:52] world even as I am not of the world
[42:57] that's remarkable he said I come from
[42:59] God I go to God and just as much as
[43:02] Christ was not of the world he was found
[43:04] in fashion as a man in his schema in his
[43:07] appearance in his manner of life he he
[43:10] looked like a man who is living in the
[43:12] world but yet he was not fashioned after
[43:16] the
[43:17] world so he prays I pray not that thou
[43:20] should us take them out of the world but
[43:22] thou should us keep them from
[43:26] evil here we are and we may pray daily
[43:28] and I certainly wouldn't object to a
[43:30] constant cry Lord take me take us from
[43:33] here let us go meet you in the air let
[43:34] this Rapture be finished let's go uh be
[43:37] changed in a moment there may be this
[43:38] crying out I we want to go to that place
[43:40] and we want this life uh to to move into
[43:43] that cycle of fullness of redemption but
[43:46] yet he says I don't pray to take them
[43:47] out of the world I just want while
[43:49] they're in the world that they be kept
[43:50] from Evil kept from the force that is
[43:53] not right to be kept from the course
[43:55] that is evil so he repeats it they are
[43:58] not of the world even as I am not of the
[44:02] world he's repeating himself so that
[44:04] you'll get it so he says sanctify them
[44:07] through thy truth Thy word is
[44:09] truth as thou Hast sent me into the
[44:11] world even so have I also sent them into
[44:16] the world you're in this world but not
[44:19] of this world you have been called out
[44:21] of the church you've been called out of
[44:23] the world but then sent back into
[44:25] it in a way he says behold I I be
[44:29] harmless a a as doves and wise as a
[44:31] serpent because I send you out into the
[44:33] midst of
[44:35] wolves and that is exactly what he has
[44:37] done there's a way that we ought to be
[44:38] in our discernment there's a way that we
[44:40] ought to be in our character because
[44:41] we've been sent into the world not to
[44:44] become like the world not to become
[44:45] friends with the world not to be
[44:47] confused with the world and not to draw
[44:49] our swords against the world but to make
[44:52] our way through the world through this
[44:54] wisdom and through this humility that it
[44:56] could find others who themselves also
[44:59] are not of this
[45:01] world who've been doing their best to
[45:03] try to fit into it doing their best to
[45:05] try to get uh um some identity out of
[45:09] it I'll have our brothers come to their
[45:12] instruments if they could and I want to
[45:16] end with this statement from the sermon
[45:17] God's power to
[45:19] transform you'll find that this sermon
[45:21] is just replete these two different ways
[45:23] that he preaches this subject are just
[45:24] full of these statements even does God
[45:26] ever change his mind about his word God
[45:28] does not
[45:31] change if we love the world and the
[45:33] things of the world the love of God
[45:34] cannot be in us it's got to it's
[45:37] referring to some world it's that world
[45:41] that's always
[45:42] changing if you love the things of the
[45:45] world and you say oh I just I just love
[45:48] the drip of the world now I just just
[45:50] love it I just love it's just
[45:52] percolating all those things that I
[45:54] enjoy and I love well
[45:57] just know that in give it a year you're
[45:59] going to be basic to the
[46:00] world so what does your love have to do
[46:02] has to change your likes your wants your
[46:05] wishes all the that's just what the
[46:06] world does it changes but God never
[46:09] changes and A Love For The World
[46:12] displeases God because where's the
[46:13] where's the stability everything's
[46:16] transitory just look at what's happening
[46:18] in America right now at one point it
[46:20] just looks like eventually we're all
[46:22] going to have to declare some other
[46:24] gender as a backup right and it's the
[46:26] way that it's going we're thinking man
[46:28] this thing is going full hardcore to the
[46:31] left and then all of a sudden the very
[46:33] people who were propagating forcing
[46:35] everyone to wear certain t-shirts and to
[46:37] put things on there uh to declare pride
[46:39] in certain things now they're like
[46:40] reversing course right it's all going
[46:43] the other
[46:44] way and what is it that's not a
[46:47] Christian Resurrection that's not an
[46:49] upswell of morality what was cool now is
[46:52] basic or then is basic now and one day
[46:55] it's just it's going to be qu it's going
[46:57] to be quaint to have been queer he
[46:59] there's going to be some Nostalgia to it
[47:01] oh you remember when we were all
[47:02] changing our genders all the
[47:05] time that that's that's a that's not
[47:08] that's not a moral movement that's the
[47:11] way the world works so where's the word
[47:14] where's the Christ today who never
[47:17] changes even though there may be some
[47:19] appearance as a man looks like a woman
[47:22] who lives in in in America looks like an
[47:24] Arizona teenager looks like this but yet
[47:26] we real the stain in the smell of the
[47:28] world is not on them they look human
[47:31] they act human they have all these
[47:33] different qualities and characteristics
[47:35] as a man but they they're of a different
[47:38] order he says now the word here is not
[47:43] Earth it's talking about world it's a
[47:45] Greek word Cosmos which means the
[47:48] world's order if we love Fashions of the
[47:51] Earth the world if we love the trend of
[47:53] this day if we think this is a wonderful
[47:56] time oh have all these things if you
[47:59] think that it's because your thinking is
[48:02] wrong it's perverted by the
[48:06] devil now I realize the the debate is
[48:10] well what exactly is he referring to to
[48:14] to uh Church of Christ they might think
[48:17] these windows and this piano is of the
[48:19] devil
[48:21] right
[48:22] right that that a paradigm oh well
[48:25] that's that's worldly uh to some
[48:27] communities if you have
[48:29] electricity you know that's just a
[48:31] pipeline of
[48:33] evil and we're not debating the morality
[48:36] or which is which is better I'm just
[48:37] acknowledging that there is sometimes
[48:39] this idea that these things are overtly
[48:42] evil and I believe that there is a line
[48:44] there is a there is a path there is a
[48:45] way of life there are things that are
[48:46] overtly
[48:49] worldly we need to challenge ourselves
[48:51] with the Fashions of this world if we
[48:53] love the trend of the day oh it's Wonder
[48:55] we have these things that's enjoyable
[48:56] let get everything we can out of him he
[48:58] says but it's the wrong kind of thinking
[48:59] it's perverted for if you love The
[49:01] World's order and the things of this
[49:02] present world it's because the love of
[49:04] God is not even in
[49:06] you because the love of God is not even
[49:08] in you wow that just has a way of
[49:10] hitting really hard so I really like
[49:12] this and I really like this and I enjoy
[49:14] this and I enjoy that check
[49:16] up check up and ask yourself have I
[49:19] become so
[49:20] consumed with the world as he says let
[49:22] not your adorning be of these things
[49:24] maybe we could put ourselves in that as
[49:26] men let not your adorning be these
[49:28] things so that when someone thinks of
[49:29] you oh brother so and so this is what he
[49:32] is and you're identified with a male
[49:35] equivalent of plating of
[49:36] hair a male equivalent of Recreations
[49:39] and desires and things that might have
[49:41] to do with things that are of the man
[49:44] and that's what you're identified with
[49:45] camouflage and buck urine or whatever it
[49:48] might be there's a way that there well
[49:49] that he's a hunter somebody the other
[49:51] day was telling me about somebody and
[49:52] said oh do you know so and so yeah that
[49:54] guy's a a gun guy and then I asked
[49:57] somebody else about the same guy it's
[49:59] like do you know him he says yeah he's a
[50:00] gun guy and complet two different people
[50:03] whose arcs don't cross and they both
[50:05] know this other guy he's a gun guy well
[50:08] okay maybe we could be known for
[50:10] something but wouldn't it be nice if
[50:11] somebody said oh yeah he's a
[50:14] Christian oh yeah he's a good guy he's
[50:16] honest he's got decency he's got
[50:18] Integrity no judgment on the gun guy
[50:21] just used him as a to make a point gun
[50:24] guy forgive me especially if you got
[50:25] guns
[50:27] [Music]
[50:33] Lord help us to be amen fashioned by his
[50:37] word you're going to be
[50:39] fashioned and if I'm going to be
[50:41] fashioned I want to be in that Timeless
[50:42] way that God loves I'll be in this
[50:45] present
[50:46] world but I won't be of this world I
[50:48] won't be formed and shaped by this world
[50:51] yes I can I can dress with a modern suit
[50:54] I can wear a a modern thin tie I can I
[50:56] can wear wing tips I can wear leather
[50:59] belts I can I can have I can wear in a
[51:01] dress in a way that any lawyer on Wall
[51:03] Street might dress or how this person
[51:05] might dress but in doing so I would
[51:07] still want to portray a spiritual
[51:09] message of
[51:11] Christ praise the Lord if we could just
[51:13] stand to our feet this
[51:14] [Music]
[51:17] evening we'll pray together with you all
[51:21] and what I'd like to do is at once once
[51:24] we've prayed just as the song we're
[51:26] singing and just be dismissed uh uh to
[51:29] our
[51:30] baptism uh brother Edward as a church we
[51:33] consider a great privilege to be able to
[51:35] baptize you in the name of the Lord
[51:36] Jesus Christ and so as we gather around
[51:39] the baptismal he'll share uh if there's
[51:41] a short testimony or just whatever
[51:42] testimony he might want to share we give
[51:43] him that opportunity to do so but as we
[51:46] bow our heads tonight I just ask if you
[51:48] have a a prayer in your heart just lift
[51:50] it up before the Lord our gracious
[51:53] Heavenly Father tonight as we close our
[51:55] service as we've taken maybe 45 minutes
[51:59] or so to walk through a very simple
[52:01] principle of being
[52:03] fashioned I trust that the believer has
[52:05] been able to pick up on that
[52:08] theme in the
[52:10] word maybe even for our young people or
[52:13] anyone that might be struggling just to
[52:14] recognize there there is a current in
[52:17] this world that tries to P push us
[52:19] towards certain
[52:22] things Lord I I know it for myself
[52:24] there's things I see sometimes like oh
[52:26] man I I'd like to have
[52:27] that and then you realize that in doing
[52:31] so it is signaling a certain fashion or
[52:33] a certain style or certain
[52:36] look that could inappropriately identify
[52:40] ourselves with
[52:42] something that displeases
[52:45] [Music]
[52:54] you Lord May the
[52:57] be a reckoning in our own lives just an
[53:00] a spiritual
[53:02] audit a continual searching Lord I want
[53:05] my life to please you and this word
[53:08] which can be so elusive in your nature
[53:10] your spirit which man is not privileged
[53:13] to handle
[53:17] physically Lord even as it were Thomas
[53:20] was of the mind he had to see it he had
[53:22] to be uh proven by evidence but what
[53:24] about those who have not seen and yet
[53:25] believed
[53:27] Lord that's us so Lord I pray that that
[53:30] spirituality of the word of God that you
[53:32] desire to be portrayed in flesh that I
[53:34] could do so I want to do that Lord for
[53:36] the sake of the gospel for the sake of
[53:38] the expediency and I pray that you bless
[53:41] all that are here tonight that you be
[53:42] merciful to them in this subject matter
[53:45] Lord I know there's maybe a lot of lines
[53:46] that we could cross or a lot of lines
[53:48] that we can make very Stark and nail it
[53:50] down really tight but Lord I pray that
[53:51] at the appropriate time we could get
[53:52] into it so that we're approaching it
[53:55] from the right angle
[53:57] Lord I pray that you bless our baptismal
[53:59] service brother Edward Munos Lord you've
[54:01] been working in his life now for some
[54:02] time brought him to this place tonight
[54:04] to desire to be baptized on his birthday
[54:07] I pray that this would just be uh such a
[54:09] special time in your word and in your
[54:11] presence may he never forget this
[54:14] time this moment this day Lord we ask
[54:17] your blessing upon our visitors and
[54:19] those that were with us this evening as
[54:21] we're dismissed may your presence go
[54:22] with us we ask all this in the name of
[54:24] the Lord Jesus Christ am amen
