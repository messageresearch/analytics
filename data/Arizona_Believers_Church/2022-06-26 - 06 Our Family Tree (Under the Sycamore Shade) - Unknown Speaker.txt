TRANSCRIPT
========================================
continuing on the subject of our family tree today's title is under the sycamore shade under the sycamore shade kind of our goal in these services i believe this is the sixth part uh is really establishing our expectations for church for this church in particular looking at this church as being a family tree something that we gather around something that we feel like we're family and we enjoy all the benefits that come with being family and then there's this extension also to how we ought to operate our own families so there's a lot of applicability on a number of levels and uh it may come back to this emphasis here in the in the beginning but i'm i'm wanting to lay the right kind of foundation for this church is still young not quite two years old yet it's been growing and so there's still new members being added all the time and i'm trusting that god will do that by conversions and by souls being saved and so kind of wanting to revisit the foundation and if i could put it this way enter certain things into the record of our church history so that if any time even i as a pastor begin to wonder you could say you remember when you preached our family tree and you said this is the way it should be done and you can remind me and hopefully i'd be the type of person who could say oh you're right how did i begin to vary from that and so i like being able to enter things into the record that i can be held accountable to because i am willing to be accountable i voluntarily and willingly hold myself accountable to you and so these things are part of building the right kind of foundation so if you ask what's the reason for going into these things and even saying some of the things that i will about church and about our approach to church you might think maybe i'm preaching beyond you but i'm not it's just right here within these walls i'm ministering to you now in genesis chapter 21 verse 33 this has been the inspiration for this series it says and abraham planted a grove in beersheba and called there in the grove on the name of the lord the everlasting god grove there is translated a tamarisk in some places or abraham planted a tree the grove started with the tree we're calling it a family tree and it's very rich in symbolism and application and we've done that through a few services and i want to continue to take the thought of a tree and and use its symbolism and application this tamrix of fila we looked at it how it was the nature of this particular tree that abraham planted uh was symbolic of the grove that then began to develop around uh what abraham around abraham's planting and what his vision was and planting it it wasn't just a arbor day so he just planted a tree he wasn't trying to meet a quota to get some carbon credits but he had a vision in doing it and this tree is long-lived has deep roots and so to draw water from arid regions and it provides a lot of shade it's adapted for desert conditions it's uh of its structure it's used as a break from the wind shade from the sun and so there's a lot of uses we talked about how it secretes salt during the day and as it secretes salt it dries up and then at night that water or it begins to it absorbs water and then as it evaporates it cools the air under the trees so it's like it had natural air conditioning it was a place to put a tent it was a place to fellowship it was a place to gather and we saw a lot of those examples in the scripture and these things happened because the nature and character of the tree i've even been pondering how god when he created all things and put the seeds in the earth he knew what those seeds would become and how they would be used do you even think the very elements of iron and ore were put into the earth the very seedlings of trees were put into the earth and god knew one day that man would take that iron and fashion nails to to nail his son to a cross from the trees that the seeds that were planted in genesis 1 and so god had a vision to these things we'd be looking at the characteristics of trees and in abraham planting a grove it's the a shell who by means of the grove by means of these trees or this tree god invoked abraham invoked invoked the name of god by the hospitality of the grove by the ministry of the grove god became known and we use that as an application for this church and for our own families now i want to reference this very quick and it kind of it may give you some indication of some other sermons that we've been preparing for to perhaps minister on i have no particular um personal agenda in terms of getting through so many parts or touching on different subjects just as long as god would lead these are some of the you might catch on some similarities here but there's different trees in the bible that stand out and we may begin to think about a lot of different ones that stand out to us and they they stand out because of their use let's just write it out we we've surmised that it eventually goes away so we can just see how long how long it lasts and we time it take notes because we want to know does this happen at a particular time is it a sunburst is it somebody's cell phone that's on 6g um you know what's what's happening it's not bothering me is it bothering you guys i know it'd be annoying if we did this for two hours but thank you brother if i need to grab a mic i can i can preach with one hand i feel more preacherous doing this anyway so this might help me to really get a get into the anointing today so we're acknowledging that there's different trees um in the bible and you may be able to think about different trees uh that that come to your mind when you think about uh just the actual tree and what it might mean there's different uh trees that stand out because of the way that they were used in the bible or their symbolism and just to run through a list i jotted down a few yesterday we think of the gopher tree as it was used to build the ark the juniper tree where elijah sat underneath it the fig tree comes up a lot in the old testament new testament it's a a symbol of israel then even the olive tree and its symbolism in scripture and in particular with noah as a sign than the cedar tree and how it was used to build the tabernacle and different elements of the tabernacle and we see these different trees are used in different parables they have different types and different symbolisms and so i wanted to focus on one particular tree today and that's the sycamore tree and again my title is under the sycamore shade and there's really interesting things that i've been diving into about the sycamore tree but this is this is my thesis on under the sycamore shade i'm talking about our church by extension could even think about the the way that we're running our families but church is a place to hear god and to see god it's a place to meet him and but it can also be a place that keeps us from him and so i'm wanting to use this image of under the sycamore shade and and and i'm just going to jump into the subject matter i'm going to start in luke chapter 19 it's going to jump into the subject matter and i want you to follow me because i'm just going to lay a lot of things out there a lot of pieces to the puzzle i'm going to get i'm going to flip them over we're going to get the border going i'm going to start putting things into categories but what i want you to be able to do once it starts coming together i want you to be able to grab some of those pieces and put them into place yourself but dale we'll have fun today right we're going to put this puzzle together and and i enjoy putting together puzzles and so what we're going to be doing today is not trying to puzzle you put a lot of pieces out on the table stick with me and follow me remember the purpose of this sermon today is to lay the right kind of foundation and then as i speak in a general sense what i encourage you to do is make application for yourself if i don't take the next step and make it applicable that's that's on your part to do that and i forgot to welcome the mcgeary's back not these mcgeary's but the other miguri's brother judas good to have you back i kept telling myself welcome back welcome back welcome back from bulgaria and and sister damaris was in canada god bless you and your family it's good to have you back looking forward to hearing about what the lord did and while you were there in europe we were all praying for you so now luke chapter 19 verse 4 and this is speaking of zacchaeus and it says and he ran before and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him for he was to pass that way this sycamore tree is what we're going to focus on begin to develop some of its characteristics these will be some of the pieces to the puzzle that maybe you can put in later it's a sycamine or a sycamore as it's called here in the scripture and it comes from sikhi which is means fig and then mora which is mulberry so it's a combination of fig and mulberry it's a mulberry fig tree it's a sycamore fig in the new testament ficus sycamores or often called the fig mulberry or sycamore fig so that's the tree if you want to look it up it may not be like the sycamores we see here in north america but it's a fig mulberry or a sycamore fig it's a very unique tree in emma's chapter 7 verse 14 it says then answered amos and said to amaziah i was no prophet neither was i a prophet son but i was a herdman and a gatherer of sycamore fruit and so it says a gather sycamore fruit i don't have a slide there of the of the trees it may be a little bit difficult to see this but the one there on your left the large panel that's a sycamore tree and then those two other pictures show the branches of a sycamore tree and the fruit goes directly from the trunk and it's little sprigs that come in like little clusters of grapes um on the actual branch itself and so when it says i when amos says i was a gatherer of sycamore fruit he was a dresser or cultivator of these sycamore figs and in the harvesting or the use of the sycamore fig it has to be punctured at a specific point before you harvest it or before you pluck it in order for it to be edible so one thing that he would do is a cultivator or a dresser of sycamore figs as he would go and he would puncture them and cut them open so many days before he'd want to eat them because it was necessary to dress them or cultivate them in order for them to be edible to the one who was wanting to eat them so he was a gatherer of sycamore fruit this is what it looks like and we could keep that up there for you to ponder it for just a moment and in first kings chapter 10 verse 27 and the king made silver to be in jerusalem as stones think about that and cedars made he to be as the sycamore trees that are in the veil for abundance and so this kind of gives you an idea of how uh common the sycamore tree was that he make the king made silver to be a stones so this is how rich the kingdom is getting and cedars to be just as common and in abundance as sycamore trees that are in the veil in the low lands in this low-lying area and the sycamores and they grew in abundance in the lowland that's what the scriptures tell us and it's telling us about how important this tree was and how it was common and it was always green and it bore this fruit many times a year several times a year wasn't just one time a year but it would have this fruit many times a year so it was kind of a useful a useful tree and in a lot of ways it was associated with common people and the poor people because it was readily available and it fruited many times of the year and it says in first chronicles chapter 27 verse 28 and over the olive trees and the sycamore trees that are in the low plains was behnan the gatorite and so it must have been a pretty significant resource if you're going to have an overseer over it right you would you don't ask anybody to watch a scrub brush or anything like that but here it is an overseer placed over olive trees and sycamore trees so it's a significant resource this is one who is responsible for the cultivating it over the keeping of it and it's associated with sycamore trees and in a lot of ways the trunk of the sycamore tree is like an olive tree and i found even where brother branham speaking about luke chapter 19 says it was actually it was an olive tree that zacchaeus climbed i thought that was interesting but in this region in israel middle east the sycamore tree was widespread it was used very extensively and it became very important this scripture in psalm 7847 it kind of speaks to how important this tree was he's speaking about egypt he destroyed their vines with hail and their sycamore trees with frost so for to be one of uh the catastrophes of egypt then it meant it must have been a vital resource to say that the the um the the vines are destroyed with hell and the sycamore trees are destroyed with frost it speaks to just how important this resource was or how significant this tree was in isaiah chapter 9 verse 10 it says the bricks are falling down but we build with hume stones the sycamores are cut down but we will change them into cedars speaking about when the assyrians uh besieged the the city and they had cut down all this all the sycamore trees during the siege and so it grew in the fields and around the city it was a common tree and it was used to build i was readily available but it wasn't necessarily the best wood to build with it was um not ideal because it wasn't durable it really wasn't a tree you'd use to build but if it was for the poor and common people you used what you had and so it says here that the sycamores are cut down but will use cedars to build so the cedar is strong and long-lasting and beautiful but they're sycamore tree was very common and it had a strong widespread branches uh underneath it many lateral branches that are easy to climb and so when it says in luke chapter 19 verse four and speaking of zacchaeus and he ran before and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him and this is one that's actually in africa but this is just how big and wide these trees can get and so this is a thought and i'm kind of what i'm saying here i'm going to come right back to in the end or whenever this battery goes out uh but there's i'm going to come back to it and this is one of these pieces to the puzzle i want you to hold and kind of put in that category like this is unique it's going to have a place to fit but zacchaeus we know he climbed up into this tree to see christ but you look at this tree and you see it not only was it a place where he could see christ but it was also a place he could hide and so i want you to ponder the meaning of the sycamore we kind of just took a moment to lay some foundation of this the rich symbolism of the sycamore it's placed in the scripture and it's these trees and its branches it's at the intersection of the sycamore branches brother branham says here two ways meet yours in god he says that's a good place to set where two ways meet looking at these branches you can see again in these in the sycamore there uh to your left just how the branches would be and maybe some of us look and said now that would be a great place to climb it'd be a good a good perch to be in and so brother i'm looking at those branches and using these the way these things intertwine and intersect and a good place to sit would be where two branches meet he says it's a to where it's a place where you meet with god you and god and he said that's a good place to set where two ways meet that your ideas and that's your ideas and god's word a lot of times that's what happens when we come to church we come with our ideas and the word of god meets them and that's a good place to ponder for a little while he says where your ideas and his meat that's a good place to rest just for a few minutes so notice how he's characterizing this place in the sycamore tree so that's where two two ideas meet your ways in god's way his thoughts and your thoughts and we think oh battlefield or or this is a this is a demolition derby or this is a head-on collision it's not it should never be viewed that way as a son or daughter of god then i'm going to meet god head on and we're going to clash on the battlefield my ideas and his ideas no you meet on the uh and the crux and the branch of a sycamore tree and you ponder a little while and you think about it out of my ways compared to his ways lord let my thoughts be your thoughts he says it's a good place to rest and so these wide spread branches you could see them were used for creating shade and and it made this good shade was a good place to rest a good place to rest under i didn't get a picture of it but they the leaves are heart-shaped and even on the other the on the underside it's kind of a uh it's soft and kind of downy they say and it's even very fragrant so it's a pleasant place to rest it has ample shade for putting up a tent or for resting and you can even see here maybe underneath the the quote that i have pasted there that there's benches and this one broadway here in israel these trees that are lining up this in tel aviv these are sycamore trees and there's benches placed underneath them and it shades this walkway because that's how this tree was used for generations and for centuries and because of the nature of the sycamore tree and it being easy to plant and maybe easy to find it was frequently planted by the wayside or by highways to the common passage areas and as it says in luke chapter 18 verse 35 as we read in our text that this blind man says he sat by the wayside and so as we read it in luke chapter 18 and then went into chapter 19 and we find zacchaeus in a sycamore tree on the wayside it was probably under sycamore tree that this blind man sat so mark chapter 10 verses 46 to 52 says and they came to jericho this is a different uh recording of the same event and they came to jericho and as he went out of jericho with his disciples and a great number of people blind bartimaeus the son of timaeus sat by the highway side begging if he was sitting by the highway side begging it's most likely that he's sitting under a tree sitting under a quiet place he's sent under a restful place he's sitting in one of these shaded ways as it was frequently planted by the wayside or a highway side begging this is probably where blind bartimaeus sat and when he heard that it was jesus of nazareth he began to cry out and say jesus thou son of david have mercy on me and notice this in many charges he should hold his peace but he cried the more a great deal thou son of david have mercy on me and jesus stood still and commanded him to be called and they called the blind man saying to him be of good comfort rise he calleth thee and he casting away his garment rose and came to jesus and jesus answered and said unto him what wilt thou that i should do unto thee the blind man said unto him lord that i may receive my sight and jesus said unto them go thy way thy faith hath made thee whole and immediately he received the sight and followed jesus in the way and so it is at the sycamore tree this is what brought all this into focus and i had been um drawn by the scripture thou son of david have mercy on me and then i'm drawing a lot of inspiration from a particular sermon that brother bannon preached called thou son of david have mercy on me and it is at the sycamore tree that the stories of bartimaeus and zacchaeus intertwine or meet we could see some other similarities but that's where i want to bring those two stories together and i'm going to just start looking at scriptures to compare them and contrast them because there's similarities and there's differences in luke chapter 18 verse 35 it says it came to pass that he christ was come nigh into jerusalem it may sound like he's drawing near to it but when you look at the original uh you kind of look at the language that's used it's speaking that he was near to it he could have been leaving the old city coming to the new there's really no contradiction as it says he enters into and passes through or when he draws nigh and then as it says in mark chapter 10 as they were come to jerusalem and went out of jericho the meaning is we shouldn't get hung up on those words because he was just near jericho he's on the same passageway and says a certain blind man who is this certain blind man it's bartimaeus and it says he sat by the wayside begging so jesus is near jericho there's a certain blind man who sits by the wayside begging now catch this bartimaeus it means son of timaeus and tomas means unclean defiled or impure and then in luke chapter 19 the very next story that we read about and again we have it broke up into chapters but i believe the positioning is for a reason i think this this story only being told by luke in conjunction with this story it's for a reason it brings things into focus and it says and jesus entered and passed through jericho so it's on the same trip the same line during the same period and behold there was a man named zacchaeus which was the chief among the publicans and he was rich you can already see a contrast between the two but not only does bartimaeus mean a son of unclean or son of the defiled zacchaeus means comes from a hebrew word meaning to be pure to be clean and bright what a difference in in their their backgrounds and their their past one was a blind beggar sitting by the wayside begging the other one is noted as chief among the publicans and he was rich he was rich he was a social elite they say he was a superintendent of the customs and tributes in the jericho district and around that area brother branham said he was prosperous he stood in in good with the rabbi he stood in good with all the societies so he thought if he got in trouble he'd get backed up and the sanhedrin was right for him there's a man who had a lot of fallback plans a lot of political backing he was very social had a lot of people that would have his back brother branham said he was a businessman of jericho very rich man it says let's say he owned a restaurant well things have changed he says let's say you owned a restaurant and i i heard a long time ago do you want to know how to make a small fortune start with a large fortune and open a restaurant and she'll end up with a small fortune but here at this time it was a restaurant owner and brother branham at one point in this one of the sermons he's preaching he mentions a rabbi ravinsky and everyone starts laughing he goes i'm just dramatizing here i hope there's no ravinski here and but who knows brother brandon may have known that one of these full gospel businessmen who's got a lot of money was a restaurant owner but he's talking about this very rich man a businessman let's say you owned a restaurant he says and so one is poor begging name means unclean and impure and then immediately contrasted by a rich man whose name means pure and clean bright how we could begin we could spend a lot of time on their differences we could go into the the life of bartimaeus we could go in the life of zacchaeus brother bram does a great job i believe he preaches sermons that are uh in which bartimaeus is the main subject 16 different times in his ministry all over the place in in germany san juan puerto rico and canada all over north america he preached blind bartimaeus and a few other sermons that have the same subject matter so it's very uh very unique and then a few times it maybe several times he's using zacchaeus but he preaches on zacchaeus the businessman and they're joined right together in this story from luke chapter 18 to luke chapter 19. focusing around jesus's trip around jericho or through jericho and but i want you to think of it this way despite there's differences there's something that brings them together because we're not we're not telling the story where the the um kind of the arc of it is you have the antagonist and you have the hero and here's here's one who's going to come out on top the beggar the poor man he succeeds whereas the rich man fails no there's something that brings them together they even have certain things in common as we look at the scripture because both of them get hated by the crowds in matthew chapter 20 verse 31 and the multitude rebuked them and it because in matthew chapter 20 it says there's two blind men and he says the multitude rebuke them because they should hold their peace but they cried the more saying have mercy on us o lord thou son of david they charged him that he should hold this peace and these places that we've read they they said oh be quiet they rebuked him that he should hold his peace but he cried the much more saying oh lord thou son of david have mercy on us and the crowd is rebuking him and then when uh and this is the poor man the beggar the the son of the unclean and the defiled but then zacchaeus doesn't have any better luck when jesus goes over to his house it says in luke 19 verse 7 and when they saw it they all murmured saying that he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner so they both find they draw kind of the the ire and the hatred or the animosity of the crown and i want you to recognize this similarity and i know you might be saying well brother aaron you're kind of assuming that that bartimaeus was under a sycamore i know i know i'm doing that but let's say that from their location under the crown of the sycamore jesus speak jesus calls to them both one may have been rich one may be perched in the tree the other one may be a poor broken at the bottom of the tree they had different positions and relationships to the tree but both of them were called by christ in mark chapter 10 verse 49 it says and jesus stood still i believe it's brother branham that says it what would be greater joshua causing the sun to stand still or blind bartimaeus causing the sun of god to stand still and jesus stood still and commanded him to be called and they call the blind man saying unto him be of good comfort rise he calleth thee sorry if i didn't provide that slide for you and jesus stood still and commanded him to be called and they called the blind man saying him give good comfort rise he coffee catch that i want to come back to it that they recognize he's called for you brother branham when he's talking about he says christ was probably a hundred yards away there was a throng around him it was very crowded zacchaeus had to get up in a tree to see him but yet somehow what he's saying catches the attention of christ and he stood still then in luke chapter 19 verse 5 it says and when jesus came to the place he looked up and saw him and said unto him zacchaeus make haste and come down for today i must abide at thy house. notice in both instances there under this shade of this sycamore tree christ stops and calls to the blind man but he also stops and looks up and calls to zacchaeus and says make hays come down and take me into your home brother brown makes this comparison and presence of god unrecognized i want you to kind of catch this application he says in the sermon blind bartimaeus blind bartimaeus touched his garment when he cried thou son of david have mercy on me didn't literally touch it but spiritually he touched it standing 200 yards from where he passed by by his faith it passed by his faith stopped the son of god in the road and turned him around and said bring him here they said be of good comfort bartimaeus jesus of nazareth is actually calling for you calling for the blind man and he comes forward and he says little zacchaeus up in the tree hid himself and said so he didn't believe he was a prophet either and jesus come right stood under the tree and looked up and said zacchaeus come down and called him his name now catch what's happening brother brown is bringing these two stories together and they're posit they're not positioned together in luke as bartimaeus and zacchaeus but we know from the other readings in matthew and mark that this is blind bartimaeus in particular mark but now notice how programs bringing them together as similar circumstances where god knows bartimaeus and his need he knows where he's at he knows where zacchaeus is at so if you ponder uh why bartimaeus would have been in the tree or near the tree or under the tree even why zacchaeus is in the tree the sycamore tree was a place of rest it provided shade it could even provide fruit but most importantly as we could even say about church we talked about the grove it's a place of rest come in relax rest it's a place to be fed a place to be nourished a place of hospitality and though all those things are wonderful place of fellowship a place of belonging a place of friendship but more than that it's more than just a shady place it's more than just a place that has fruit to feed you but more than that it's a place where christ calls to you it's a place where christ should be speaking to you brother braham says in the message scriptural signs of the time he says we see the blind bartimaeus we see little zacchaeus in a tree hid he's drawing these similarities how christ caught them where they were and spoke to him jesus said he'll never hid he said jesus he'll never see me up here and jesus stood right under the tree looked up and said zacchaeus come on down he was the word and the word discerns the thoughts the thought that's in the heart that's what this sycamore tree is to represent that's what this aspect i'm trying to bring out this is the kind of experience we ought to be having in church is it's a place where the word is still discerning your thoughts it's a place where the word preached is still calling your name where it may not have to be i don't need to be up here every service calling out names and calling out people's problems and because i know and saying different things when the bible speaks of the gift of knowledge i think a lot of people use it in the sense that i know it so i'm going to talk about it and they and they share certain things and it's not always wrong to necessarily do that but the word should be calling your name it shouldn't it shouldn't be where where the the you come to church and it's as if you're perched up in the tree and you're zacchaeus up in the tree and jesus is over here saying hey hey somebody whoever you are over there in the ditch you know do you need some help i'm like well here i am up in the tree he must not be talking to me you want things to become personal you want things to be relatable it's a place where the word meets you where you are you may not need to be living in the tree you may not be living at the base of the tree so the word has to come and find you where you are and speak to you so it's under the sycamore in my dramatization today it's where christ meets the needs of both bartimaeus and zacchaeus i want to focus on this for a little bit in luke chapter 18 verses 41 and 42. it's a very beautiful passage if you could read through them again maybe in your own time and just ponder these things and zacchaeus makes haste to come to him and he says he asked him what wilt thou that i shall do unto thee now what kind of what would we say today if we were asked if christ said what can i do for you reminds me even of the question of how do you write ask what you want to be given to you he says what well then i should do unto thee and he said lord that i may receive my sight and jesus said unto him receive thy sight thy faith hath saved thee there's a tremendous lesson being expressed here christ comes to blind bartimaeus and he asks him he calls for him to come and he comes and it's not bartimaeus asking the question a lot of places we see that christ is the one that's being asked the question but here bartimaeus is the one asked and he has the response i want to receive my sight and i think of the humility of bartimaeus here that he was a beggar he's leaving his position of begging this is where he made a living this is where he got his money so he's sitting there on the wayside begging hopefully that the people will pass by and have mercy on him and give him money but as a beggar he recognized what the real need was i want you to catch this because this has so many practical applications where sometimes we have a root problem that causes certain symptoms and when we're asked what can we do for you says well we just need a little bit of money to get through the month we just need a little bit of help here we just need a little bit of that this and we need more fellowship we need more of this and you're asking for things that are ancillary or tangential to the real problem and so at least bartimaeus recognizes hey i could ask for money and that'll get me so far but if he can heal my eyes i can make a living myself so he recognized the real need it wasn't money but it was his blindness and says by faith he received his sight now i want to touch on this i've been studying for well over a year now on a subject called christ my healer and and i'm really wanting to do more than just a service on it just waiting for the right time for god to anoint it but it's been it's relating to the subject of divine healing and i want to touch on this for a moment because this is what's expressed in this as it says that he received his sight so this was a miracle of him receiving his actual sight so we could certainly make application to spiritualize sight but this is the literal healing of his optics or his uh his eye and brother brown says divine healing is a great drawing card to get the people to look to the lord jesus so think of that divine healing is a great drawing card i'm wanting to just to kind of uh recognize these things and have the right attitude towards them brother man says if he calls you to preach the gospel divine healing is included in it so you can't preach the gospel without actually preaching divine healing i'll say it this way if you preach the gospel any part of the gospel to a people that believes the gospel just bear with me divine healing could be an unintended consequence right you could just be teaching as christ was in the synagogue and he says there was power there to heal them all he's just teaching but then the power of god is present why because where the word is there's power there's christ there there it's his supremacy and so if you're listening to the word of god and receiving the word of god you could receive healing just according to your attitude towards the word of god why because where the gospel is there's divine healing in it and so you can't preach the gospel and preach against divine healing brother braham says in another place divine healing is one of the great masterpieces of the bible the masterpieces of god that were given to the christian church that's been long forgotten long ago but it's something that belongs to us it's something that's your personal property do you catch that i don't believe he was speaking this at a minister's convention and he wasn't just saying it to the headliners right he's saying it to the believer divine healing is your personal property that's the attitude we ought to take to our own physical healing our divine healing is that it belongs to me it's my personal property i believe the gospel so divine healing is included in it i never have this attitude or idea that i'm going to mature far enough into the word of god where divine healing is fades away and left off it's always in the atonement it's always in the word brother branham says in the message thou son of david have mercy on me and this is just comes up right in this subject of bartimaeus and even zacchaeus included they had to fight for every inch of ground they took coming out of egypt and israel that's right fighting and take it fight every inch but he said everywhere the souls of your foot land that's possession footsteps is possession that's the same thing it is today divine healing belongs to us why don't you say divine healing belongs to me that throw you off there say it belongs to me because i don't want that i don't want there to be some sort of vicarious possession through somebody else and say well i guess brother aaron has it so i guess technically i have it too no you have it you can believe it for yourself he says the holy spirit belongs to us it's our property but you'll have to fight every inch of it yes sir but brother footsteps is possession just keep fighting take it the devil says the days of miracles has passed say you're a liar right that's what fear wants to say it's not for you it's for somebody else or that's that's only in this and only in that and that's a glare of another age no divine healing is in the atonement it's our possession say devil you're a liar god said he's the same yesterday today and forever take it over everywhere your footsteps that's possession and this is expressed in this interaction at the sycamore tree divine healing for the physical need that bartimaeus had now taken a step further and looking at zacchaeus in luke chapter 19 verses 8 to 10 it says and zacchaeus stood and said unto the lord behold lord the half of my goods i give to the poor and have taken anything from any man by false accusation i restore him fourfold and jesus said unto him now notice what he says because of the attitude the repentance of zacchaeus the acknowledgement of where he was lacking his shame even how his reputation amongst the people uh brother branham in one place says that he was a businessman and tried to be honest but yet something is a little askew here because the people look at jesus going in his house like look at this great here he goes what kind of person would hang out with zacchaeus and he says and he recognizes this meeting this chance what seems to be a chance meeting he he expresses this repentance to the master to christ and jesus in him this day is salvation so tyria deliverance it's derived from so terror savior so the savior is giving him salvation this day is salvation come to this house for so much as he also is a son of abraham what a tremendous application the son of abraham for the son of man has come to seek and to save that's from sozo to save the lost so in both places thy faith has saved thee that's sozo and here that i've come to seek and save and salvation has come to this house your salvation it's a reference both to divine healing and salvation of the person from sin and unbelief brother adam and the sermon blind bartimaeus and he preaches that title several times the word in the greek is sozo the word save or salvation is sozo same one for healing sozo notice how he's putting that here means they were physically saved or spiritually saved saved in relation to healing the saved in relationship to salvation they're the same sal the same word they were they were means they were physically saved or spiritually saved so i want you to catch this divine healing is in the atonement and brother branham treats it in certain places where it's quite remarkable when you look at it this way he's saying that and maybe i'll just say it this way our salvation had to be purchased and so in the purchases of our salvation and the blood being shed that's the atonement the goal was your soul and by virtue of that powerful redemption from death and the powerful redemption of your soul it has this consequence that reverberates through both spirit and body and the price for your soul was so great it included the healing of your body so it's not that well we have a price for healing and we have a price for this it's not like the catholic church where it's all the cart you can just pay for what you need but no it was one prize for your salvation and when he paid for your salvation it's like well my soul is saved it's washed in the blood of jesus christ and that price was so great it actually included the healing of the body it's included in the prices our salvation and so when brother man makes a statement like this divine healing is not all the message and and he talks about how you can't major on a minor it's because the the the price was for your soul it would it would be like well and i'm kind of cringing at the thought of it i don't really like buffets but it'd be like going to a buffet and paying the price for the whole thing and just just getting all you could drink refills on water hey why did you why did you pay 39.99 for this buffet well i i was thirsty and uh you know i that's why i i need i need to hydrate and uh it's dry it's a dry heat i thank goodness it's there's not tremendous humidity here you know whatever your logic might be but you know what when you paid the 40 bucks it's all included as many trips as you want and so there's some well i i just want to eat the dessert bar just want to eat the dessert bar that's all i want to use the dessert that's fine but it's all included divine healing is not all the message he says so the healing now even in this in this aspect i want you to catch this when christ heals bartimaeus of this of his blindness there's a spiritual application right to be spiritually blind there's this type but when christ heals bartimaeus the first time and when he heals him there's some symbolic representation in even healing the body because divine healing isn't possible unless there had been a price for the soul so when he when he heals him it speaks of salvation because brother man said divine healing is the earnest of the resurrection i want you to catch that divine healing is the earnest of the resurrection so in the sermon thou son of david have mercy on me he this is at the very beginning he says this now i've been for a few nights preaching and just the gospel because i think if a person is healed if they live very long they'll probably get sick again and the people said amen to that you live long enough you're going to get sick again he says but if you're saved that's eternal and you have eternal life he says and it's getting so late in the evening lights that i feel that one great thing is needed most of all that's salvation and divine healing is merely age just like brother bosworth used to say divine healing is the bait that you put on a hook the fish doesn't see the hook it just takes the bait and gets the hook so that's the way it is people see the supernatural catch how this all works together people see the supernatural the phenomena of supernatural god healing the sick and they reach out for that and first thing you know they're right in the arms of the lord jesus with great faith to believe and then they become a christian and have eternal life so it's obeyed on the hook so there's that in the sense that it's something to draw as he said it's a great masterpiece but he says it's a drawing card to get people to look to the lord jesus so he's wanting us to recognize divine healing is part of the purchase price for our salvation and so god will actually use the phenomena of the supernatural to get somebody's attention and then that getting their attention they're not just satisfied being healed but it brings them into a relationship with christ they become a christian have eternal life he says a great percent of our lord's ministry about 80 of it or better i think it was estimated about 80 percent of his ministry was divine healing so he did that catch this he did that to catch the eyes of the multitude and also to show that he was their messiah so divine healing is to catch the eye but to unfold unto redemption you couldn't you couldn't major on divine healing to say that he shed his blood and he paid the price so that we could all be healed and then just stop there and it's all about the the healing of the body no it catches the eye and if we can have the experience of being healed in our bodies then it increases our faith and it catches our attention to know he's present with us he's his word is real he keeps his promises and correctly placed and understood we continue to walk watch redemption unfold from that experience brother brahm says in the sermon 10 virgins and i do believe in divine healing it's one of the great doctrines of the bible but divine healing has more to it than just divine healing that'll get your attention divine healing has more to it than just divine healing in other words divine healing isn't just for the healing itself it speaks of something as he said it's an earnest of the resurrection here he says divine healing has more to it than just divine healing divine healing only says there's a god who's coming again so divine healing should put us under expectation to see more of god what divine healing is there's a god that's coming again even if you wanted to kind of extend that a little bit to say oh i'm healed in my body then there's a god who can do this there's a god who can do that it's an expectation that god will continue to fill his promised word so you got to keep advancing forward to where god is it's not something you keep hearkening back to but you use the momentum of because it testified there's a god who's coming again what does divine healing speak of it's the earnest of our resurrection that's what it speaks of it says if there's no divine healing then there's no resurrection so what is it it's an earnest of the resurrection it's a sign of the resurrection it speaks of the resurrection whenever there's divine healing it should remind us that there's a new body coming because if there was no divine healing he's saying that if there had been no divine healing there wouldn't be a resurrection and you might say well how do how do we make that to work well if there had been no price for your soul there'd be no resurrection and without the price for your soul there'd be no divine healing and i'm not doing complicated trigonometry here but i'm telling you it's all connected together and these are the things these are the two things that we see transpiring at the intersection of this sycamore tree i think it was hallelujah avenue and glory drive or something like that in one place brother ben talked about where zacchaeus went but it's in this image of the sycamore tree i'm not saying it was the exact same one but the sycamore was a place where bartimaeus came to his healing when zacchaeus came to salvation and this sycamore tree or a sycamore tree the church must be a place where salvation and divine healing are available it should be something that's taught should be something that's believed but the brain says in the sermon thou son of david have mercy on me says jehovah doesn't heal the people anymore he's quoting the people jehovah don't heal the people anymore you know he said that never that never did die out oh jehovah don't do those things no more we're just supposed to live good pay our tithes go to church at every meeting and then that's all we're supposed to do but jehovah doesn't heal he was jehovah back there but today he's not concerned about it oh what a mistake he's always concerned what a mistake he's always concerned if he ever was concerned he's still concerned yes sir he cannot change his motives he cannot change his attitude he's still jehovah i don't care how many says that he's changed its people's changed but he hasn't changed it's the people that change listen if there's any kind of shortcoming where something's not happening something's not working don't blame the word of god because the word hasn't changed the power is still the same but he says it's the people that change he says he hasn't changed the reason that we don't see him doing those things is because we won't let him do it he's willing and so you don't want to throw up a barrier a roadblock to divine healing you don't want to cast it in the wrong light you don't want to put a scarlet letter on it you don't want to say anything to diminish it we could say we shouldn't major on a minor but you shouldn't diminish the minor unless you're playing the piano maybe can you diminish a minor where's my musical scholars here no you can't yes okay good you can diminish a minor over a seventh but it's not something that ought to be diminished he says it ought to be uh he's willing so we have to let him the grove or the sycamore should never make us reluctant i think i've said this before brother bam said about pastors he says pastors are very suspicious of the most suspicious people and it's true he says they ought to be that way and it kind of gives some validation and still of approval for pastors who are very very suspicious but he didn't say that we ought to sow suspicion into the sheep right we're you spend every service bashing every preacher and you're thinking i don't want to hear another preacher in my life right and make suspicious of every other preacher and every other church and every other thing no you should never the grove or the sycamore shouldn't make us reluctant to want to be healed shouldn't make us reluctant to want to know him shouldn't make us reluctant uh in certain areas that's not the purpose of church brother brahman the message stands still he says tomorrow afternoon is a gospel message not a healing service praying for the sick so it's not going to be a service to pray for the sick he says i think a whole lot of our healing services have turned too much to healing instead of trying to catch the precious souls that's to be saved so you notice how how this is applicable divine healing speaks that there's a god that's coming it's the earnest of our resurrection so divine healing points forward to full redemption it's to catch the eye to see redemption unfold he says i think our healing services have turned too much into healing and look that's all we're chasing is the healing so we start the cycle of healing to healing to healing he's saying the danger is that we lose the perspective that divine healing is to cause us to look to something greater and he uses in this context i think our healing services have become only about healing and it's not to catch the attention of the people that need deliverance and salvation it's not been used to take people further so i want you to catch that how he's recognizing there's a danger in this and so this is where kind of taking my my next step to advance in this and i mentioned it in the beginning but the benefits of the sikkim or tree or the function of the sycamore tree is wonderful it's tremendous but it can also have a downside it was a point to where the very things that the tree offers become a detriment and there seems to be if i could just say this there's so many voices going on right now in the world so many political voices so many movements uh even with and i don't say this again i'm not selling suspicion now just wanting you to ponder this but in one sense we might think wow what a tremendous victory the supreme court overturned roe v v wade but then you realize the catholic influence behind it right and you realize you realize some of the details and the platitudes and and the the basis that they have for defending this and you realize wow i don't really find much support in the word of god for this and it has a cat these catholic overtones and you find well i i mean i'm kind of wanting to say yay but then you see that and then you look at the other side you go well i don't want to go over there either right i mean why why are why are people weeping and wailing and lamenting it's like how many abortions have you had are we ruining your gig right and it's like what's the percentage of people that actually do this i don't want to know but there's it's something we're like man i don't want to get caught up in it that's in the political realm in the legal realm in the economic realm and there's people that are saying yep this is going to be worse than any any crash we've ever seen before and there's other people ah it's no big deal and you see one headline that says the phoenix housing market is skyrocketing how home value is going to be over a thousand percent in in phoenix and certain parts of tucson within six months and then you read another article says it's all going to zero in a matter of days and you've got one side of the church saying all right you got another side of the church saying oh no just so many voices and then i'll just be honest with you and i want to be very careful what i say but those of you who know my testimony i'm absolutely convinced of god's call in my life to come here and start a church and and one of the beautiful aspects is i could draw away from all the tennis messages that are taking place all over the world where brother so-and-so is preaching against brother so-and-so and everyone's drawing their swords and tearing down everybody else and i can have the opportunity to just put the emphasis on the word of god put the emphasis on the word different brothers are reaching out to me different ministers or even over the past week differ speaking of different pastors and different ministers and i'm just telling all of them now's not the time to fight now's the time not to stand toe-to-toe but to stand shoulder shoulder and draw our sword against the enemy because that's the only place the word is effective i can't try to use the sword of the word to cut and tear down the body of jesus christ it's only going to be effective against unbelief and sin and against the the the conspiracies of the devil so i want to stand shoulder to shoulder with the fellow brothers labored in the gospel even if we don't see eye to eye i don't want to go toe-to-toe i want to stand shoulder to shoulder and draw my sword against the devil because now's not the time to be fighting one another and so this tree can have a downside for bartimaeus is a place to hear christ had he not been under that tree that day and again and if you're saying where there was it saves under tree i'm just saying it i'm dramatizing it under that tree that day begging then he would have missed that chance to hear christ to call out to christ and hear the stories and the testimonies and call unto him for zacchaeus it was a place to see him you hear brother branham dramatizing that and how he climbed up on a garbage can and jumped up into the trees all dressed up real nice he talks about how his wife had been praying for him and praying for him and then he's tossed and turned all night long and she's like i think it's working i think it's getting to him and it just had so much he was like i know he's going to be passing through town i'm going to get up get dressed put on his stately robes and everything and got ready and ran out to try to find a place and he's too short so he's digging around trying to find a place has to use a trash can to hop up into the tree and so it's a place to hear him to call on him a place to see him as zacchaeus was wanting to see him but it can also be a place where we choose to stay or stop in other words that that's that's the goal at the end of the day just to be there at the tree and a place to hide george brother random is saying that with bartimaeus the divine healing pointed to something greater then it's a place where there's no salvation there's no progress it does become what a tree is it's just a gathering place it's a place where social needs are met it's a place where culture is created it's a place where we can get some things to kind of feed us a little bit it's a place where we can satisfy our urges for belonging and it just becomes something social so our allegiances are social our reasons for sticking around have more to do with the things that pertain to the flesh and not the things that pertain to the soul that's the danger of the sycamore but in mark chapter 10 verse 50 as we were reading earlier about bartimaeus son of the unpure impure the son of the unclean the defiled sat by the highway side begging perhaps under a sycamore tree being blind begging for alms and desiring that he would receive money to support his family when he had called thou son of david had mercy on me and jesus stood still and standing still said go get the blind man he might have said go get bartimaeus i'm like oh how do you know him well he's got quite the reputation and they run and they get himself good comfort be of good comfort the master christ calls for thee and it says and he casting away his garment rose and came to jesus here he was under the tree in the shade with his garment it says he cast it away he was throwing off his blankets some of the translations thrown off his blanket catch this throwing off the thing that covered him i don't know if they had weighted blankets in those days maybe he was feeling a little bit anxious but he cast off the thing that would give him comfort right it was his little blankie and covered him it was his covering it was something that kept him uh from being unclothed it might have been something that kept him warm it was something that uh even might have been psychological they even talk about how certain people in order to appear humble will will limp a little bit or kind of you know uh cower down a little and there's certain ways you try to signal to somebody you're humble and it might have been something where he felt even through his his complexes that this is humbling to me and i'm covering up i'm a little bit shy maybe he's an introvert i don't know but this is some in some tellings of the story they liken this blanket to be the last thing he possessed it was his identity you knew bartimaeus by his blanket you know by the cloak that he had the way that he covered himself maybe if he was laying down and resting you could tell oh that's bartimaeus by the blanket that's covered but whenever christ calls him he throws away his identity he throws away his comforts he throws away the very last thing that he has why because something greater has called him and all of a sudden the value of the blanket the value of the shade the value of the figs the value of even the begging he left maybe even behind the alms that he had gathered and he ran to christ he says christ says what can i do if he says i want my sight i want to be healed have any of you read the book the prince of the house of david brother branham read it or it's one of the books that we know that he studied and we believe that he read because brother branham dramatizes when he dramatizes blind bartimaeus and he tells a story he refers to it i think at least four different places i could say almost definitely three where he says i don't know if the story is true but i read some time and he begins to talk about the drama of bartimaeus and the prince of the house of david and the narrative of this story it dramatizes bartimaeus having a lamb a pigeon and some turtle doves and brother brown refers to how the turtle doves did tricks and he got money in the book it says the turtle doves were taught in cunning and pleasant tricks to please children and so it was not it was something that could bring joy it was something that he was known for it was something that maybe he did for his own children or something that he did to make a living his brother venom refers to but he his dad was sick and the narrative says that he offered the turtle doves if his dad would get well and his dad got well so he offered the turtle doves and then his wife got sick and his took his pigeon and he said if my wife gets well i'm gonna offer the pigeon and then his daughter got sick and all he had left was the lamb but this just wasn't a regular lamb and in the prince of the house of david and what brother branham points out is he when his daughter got sick and and and brother branham may have used uh kind of alternated between wife i don't know if he used his daughter but when his wife got sick says he pledged the lamb that's what the story says that he took that lamb and he said if my daughter will get well i'll offer this lamb sure enough his daughter got well and so he went to the temple to offer the lamb and when he went to offer the lamb the priest objected he said no i can't take your lamb and he said thy lamb leadeth thee everywhere it is thy eyes to thee so what it says in the prince of the house of david the the priest is saying wait hold on you're blind this is your seeing eye lamb instead of having a a a a dog a scene-eyed dogger uh to to guide him and and to lead him in the way he had a lamb that he would follow that would lead him and he says it's your eyes it leads you everywhere this is your only way to make it through the town this is your way to make it to the market this is the only way you can make it to the sycamore to beg this is your this is your livelihood it's your eyes to thee but he has it in his heart no i told the lord that if he would heal my daughter if you could just catch the beautiful analogy in this that if he would heal my daughter i would give a lamb and this is my lamb the priest says well let me buy it for give you money i'll give you money and you can go buy a lamb and offer it and bartemae says no then it wouldn't be my lamb it wouldn't be the one i pledge i pledge this lamb this lamb that's precious to me brother brad i'm in the sermon blind bartimaeus says he said thank you kindly priest of god but i never promised god a lamb i promised god this lamb he said there's a lesson in that he said you can't give that lamb bartimaeus the lamb is your eyes he said but old priest of god if i'll keep my promise to god god will provide a lamb for bartimaeus's eyes and that day when he heard that jesus of nazareth pass by watch faith go into action he grabs his robe and throws it sideways for god had provided a lamb for blind bartimaeus's eyes god provided lamb it tells me that when he was willing to give up things precious willing to give up his identity even in that moment he left the elements of his beggary he left the cloak that identified him he let nobody's gonna know who you are you're leaving your prime spot this is where you can collect a lot of money but he was going to the one the lamb that he said would be provided if he gave this one up and god the lamb gave him his eyesight back why god provided a lamb for him to see that's what we see in the response of bartimaeus but he could have just stayed there under that tree he could have thought well wait he's not going to come to me i'm blind this guy says come to me no i'm i'm fine where i'm at i've got enough shade where i am i'm getting enough support to get by i can eat the figs people looking out after me i i found somebody to help get me here and there i know i lost the land but if i beg enough i can get enough money to get another one he wasn't comfortable where he was he didn't stay in those comforts maybe he was comfortable but he wasn't willing just to be comfortable he wanted he wanted the right thing he wanted to progress he wanted to grow and he cast off the covering he cast off the cloak he could have stayed there but he didn't and he ran to meet him in the way now zacchaeus he used the tree to get up to see christ to have that vantage point he was little in stature he otherwise wouldn't be able to see him because of the throng but when you read the story that as you read how brother branham dramatized it that case wasn't exactly pure in his motives his initial reason for wanting to get up in that tree because he didn't really believe in jesus and so he was going to use it as a perch to judge from and brother brahman said he used this quote always been kind of a critic and so the sycamore tree if we can if we're not at the base begging we could kind of climb up it a little bit higher it becomes a place of pride and judgment we're not the beggar at the foot of the tree we become the critic in the branches of the tree bloodman called him a critic of the lord jesus is what zacchaeus was and i want to warn us it's very it can be very subtle but we can very quickly climb a branch in a sycamore tree and start looking down from it you could come to church and you're the you're the at the base you're at the bottom you're the beggar but be careful if god ever lifts you up to another rung to see a little bit better if you ever climb up don't make it a seat of judgment there should be no sniper's nest in the sycamore tree and so i want you to recognize i don't want to belabor it too much it can be a place where we get critical a place where we look down on everybody else hey because we're a little bit higher have you seen our sycamore you talk about figs figs or days right talk about shade we got shade and you get a little bit prideful about the tree and you look down on everybody else just hold that in your mind but it can also be this is the part i really wanted to emphasize it can also be a place where we hide i i'm just going to say this personally at some you know at one point while i'm preaching i feel like man i'm going to be done with this in 45 minutes and i start thinking these people are gonna think i don't have anything to preach anymore and people drive two hours and they could have i could have fit two sermons in that time or four hours round trip and i'm thinking do i need to preach four or eight what do i need to do and then i keep going i realize yeah i'm probably going to be longer than 45 minutes so bear with me i'm almost done but the other part is the tree can become a place to hide so zach he has climbed up in the tree we could look at the judgment part the critical part the pride part but one thing brother branham emphasized over and over again that he climbed up in there so he can observe christ his goal wasn't to meet him it was just to observe him brother makes some real interesting statements in many many different places but in one place he says he climbed up in a sycamore tree and put all the leaves around him so think about this he's up in the tree and now he wants to hide he doesn't want to be visible and the sycamore tree has these large leathery-like leaves that were perfect to hide behind and the more that i thought about it in a way originally struck me a month or so ago when i was looking into this is how that the way that brother brahm describes zacchaeus and the way that the tree is used and even some of the other symbolism in scripture is it's like this can become the worst of religion that when we get to a place where it's not only prideful and it's judgmental but we hide right behind it so we're taking cheap shots right we're sniping we're judgmental and we're critical but yeah we're hiding behind you can't see me i'm taking shots but you can't see me i'm judging you from above but you can't see me i'm above you you're beneath me and there's this kind of uh condescending attitude but you hide behind it brother bam says and i'm just thinking that's just the worst of religion brother man says he pulled them all around him and camouflaged himself the sycamore place sycamore tree can be a place where not only you rest but you get so restful you just go ahead and take a nap and you get lulled to sleep and then it just becomes a hideout i'm happy to say this church don't sleep 300 anymore you come to the place you hide in genesis genesis chapter 3 verse 7 in the fall when the man and the woman sinned and in the and the immediate aftermath of sin they're fearful and the bible says in their eyes were both opened and the eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked and they sowed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons what does brother man teach us that was a covering it was their own man-made religion in one place he called it the fig leaf church i'm glad that when we were doing logos we didn't do the fiddly fig besides that's out of out of fashion anyways now check with magnolia we'll find out what the right one is now but it's it's the enduring symbol of the saguaro but uh brother mike called it a fig leaf church and in the and the image of them sitting they go and find leaves big enough you know leaves that have enough substitute them big enough to them that they can hide themselves and make themselves a covering it's religion it's their way to deal with sin it's their way to cover their nakedness that's what church can become that's what religion's become that's what christianity as a whole has become is just a big covering and it's possible that the fig tree in genesis is that sycamore fig because it's very abundant in the middle east and it's the only fig tree that has leaves large enough really that could be sewn together to create some sort of covering and i know that there's a lot of speculation in that a lot of assumptions but i'm just wanting to recognize that at least in language it was a fig tree that they sewed together to hide themselves and zacchaeus climbs up in a sycamore fig and tries to hide himself from christ camouflage himself listen i got just a little bit more to go and i really hope that you could enter into this brother adam and the sermon zacchaeus the businessman he says zacchaeus oh zacchaeus maybe it isn't rebecca at home praying may not be your wife at home praying maybe a mother that's done pass beyond the veil her prayers are still still ain't laying on the altar of god he dramatized how that wife was a believer she was a christian she was longing for her husband to see it he says well maybe it's not your wife maybe it's somebody else he says if that sows that kiss come out from behind those sycamore leaves tonight what is he saying that we can become zacchaeuses who hide behind the sycamore leaves he says come out from behind them tonight he says that crown that's an arborist term he's not talking about the crown you would wear but the crown of a tree that crown of that denominational creed that you're holding on to without the new birth that's something that you're holding on to and you've never had any evidence that god was in it he knows right where you're sitting why don't you do it where abraham has identified how it's very easy for us to hide behind creed and doctrine and and the elements of the church to to take comfort in its bark that produces the figs to take comforts in its leaves that provide shade and it's very fragrant and there you are in the in the tree but you're being lulled to sleep hiding behind the sycamore tree leaves so it's a place to hide as a church member you can you have church cover right and brother brown and i've been looking into the restoration of the bride tree whether or not lord would inspire some elements on that in our family tree and what does he talk about those leaves it's leaves of worship rejoicing and the praising god and those things and the gifts and someone could hide right behind all that use it as their justification use it as their cover but there's no life in them brother abraham says people said it in the churches die in the pew without knowing god without receiving the holy ghost because they think they'll have to give up some of the things of the world they'd never belong to church that's gotta they'd rather belong to a church that's got a higher name or what they think a little more prestige i want you to ponder this again i'm entering this in the into the record i'm i'm wanting to consider this from your standpoint to make application but don't die in the very place that's offering you healing and salvation as you look at this here here's someone who he says there's no life they'd rather die in the pew behind the the sycamore leaves listen don't commit spiritual suicide for your church someone should you ought never to do that a place you're just gonna die brother bam said judas hung himself on a sycamore tree says in several places talking about judas that judas when he hung himself hung himself on a sycamore tree he says just as much as a cross as the rest of them were on so christ hung on a cross an ordained cross a cross that he willingly gave his life up at the hands of the romans at the will of the jews and he became the sacrifice to purchase our salvation he said judas died on the cross but he was suiciding he hung on a cross of his own shoes and he could hung himself on a sycamore tree and i'm saying to you let's not be in a place where we're willing to commit spiritual suicide on a sycamore tree but be desperate to know christ so as i kind of try to wind this down just make an effort the sycamore tree can be a place of healing or it can be a place of hindrance it can be a place that can help you or it can hang you it should be a place where you can climb higher to see him should be a place where you can rest underneath to hear him but i would ask does he pass by your tree if when he does if he does do you leave your perch to respond to him in luke chapter 19 verses 5 and 6 when jesus came to the place he looked up and saw him and said to him zacchaeus make haste and come down for today i must abide at the house and he made a haste and came down and received him joyfully do you hear his invitation are you responding are you receiving him joyfully because you've got to receive i thought about this sitting in the church pews dying camouflaging behind sycamore leaves and this whole image of zacchaeus being up in that tree and he could have continued to hide behind that tree and been satisfied well i saw him i saw him do this i saw this i saw that i was there with the throng i did what you wanted me to do i went to church i observed i paid my tithes i did everything i was supposed to do but did you respond to him did you receive him when he called when he said to come down and make haste did you receive him joyfully did you did you follow his instructions and let him abide at that house and you could be right around where all that's taking place and have this so very near you and see it and know it but not enter into it and i thought about the sermon when brother man preached how can i overcome and he says i was crossing an old log the other day down a wash or what it was called a hauler and i jumped upon this log on the outside it looked good looked like a big old beach log but when i jumped on it a great big chunk fell off of it it was real rotten and doty i said that's the way the christians are becoming they've been dead and sin and trespasses so long till they become doty they can hold no weight at all they don't know what the overcoming means and i begin to think of this text then overcome keep life in you when life went out that's what brought that log to that condition and it made it worse than ever when it laid in the branch where the water was and there you take a christian that's supposed to be a christian let the life of god go from him and the experience the joy of serving christ and living in a church where such is going on what the word being preached or the just look at this the joy in the things of god right there where the water is he rottens twice as quick right living right under this is the danger you can say oh i'm in a great church it's a wonderful church this is a great sycamore tree i love this sycamore tree are you just hiding out are you just enjoying the the the frappuccinos and the snipers nest what are you doing up there are are you just happy begging at the foot of the tree and living as a beggar are you happy to live as a critic what is it you're doing in that tree because if you aren't experiencing the joy of serving christ if you're not if you're not entering in where the word is being preached and the water is flowing he says you're rotten twice as quick oh you mean that i'm worse off and rotting faster being in a by not doing my part as someone who leaves yes absolutely so if we're trying to follow the message of the hour at least this part of the message we should live constantly in the life of christ and if it don't you lay around and know that these things that you're supposed to do and don't do it so it's not just about your church experience it's not just about your sycamore experience the bible said here that note to do good and don't and doeth it not to him and it's sin then you become dody and rotten when you're separated from the life of god so strive with all that's in you to stay in the life of christ that you be fruit-bearing stay with all that is in you to be fruit barrier as i close bartimaeus sat he sat under that tree it was a comfortable place for him a place to make a living though he did it by begging but one day christ passed by and he heard the buzz he's blind he he recognizes the commotion here's different people talking and brother branham dramatizes it and he begins to dramatize how bartimaeus begin to hear testimonies and it's remarkable this really stood out to me how when brother branham tells the story whether he's using zacchaeus or bartimaeus but he tells the story and he reverses the order he does it several times instead of bartimaeus being healed first he tells the story how that blind bartimaeus is setting under this tree or he's sitting there by the wayside begging and he starts asking what's going on what's all the commotion jesus of nazareth is coming by and he starts hearing testimonies and one of the people that testifies is rebecca zacchaeus's wife says you remember zacchaeus little shopkeeper the old restaurant owner you remember how he was yeah yeah what what about well he he got to christ stopped right at the base of the tree looked up called him by name he invited him to ask to come into his home he invited himself and he's a changed man he actually said if i've done any thing wrong i will restore it i will restore anything that i've taken and he showed this great humility in responding whatever has been taken from me i'll restore if i've done anything by false accusation i'll restore him fourfold and now he's a saved person he's following christ and he's like oh wow really and it really struck me that brother brahm does it so often i even paused and thought well is there is there a meaning to this is there reason as you look into the scripture you'll find that there really is no absolute barrier to there being some difference in the order and the chronology of it but what struck me as i pondered this yesterday is how that in the scripture the divine healing leads to salvation and then when brother branham tells it in the end time the salvation leads to divine healing which is an earnest of the resurrection which is a type of our body change and it puts that sequence perfectly in order it almost inverts it to where we can begin to see there can be a bait on the hook to get us to salvation then salvation isn't to isn't just to bring us back back back back back but forward to the change of our bodies so it's unique that brother bannon changed the order but upon the basis of these testimonies and this crying out uh these things around verse 36 of chapter 18 he says jesus thou son of david have mercy on me he was destitute he was a beggar but not only that he was desperate and under that tree that they began to cry jesus have mercy on me and the thought of how he might have been there think of how hopeless he was i'll never make it to him through the crowd i i even if i even if i tried to use a lamb to get to him there's no way i won't know who he is i don't know his voice and i began to get desperate i i i want this i want this healing and he calls him and he's referring to him more in this desperate plea jesus thou son of david have mercy on me and it must have startled everyone nearby because they're like hey man be quiet you need to relax a little bit take a chill pill there's this is no time for that he can't hear you you're just making a ruckus there's no reason to get fanatical why don't you just tone it down a little bit and the more he was told to be quiet the more desperate he got and began to cry out jesus have mercy on me perhaps knowing that there's no way that he could actually hear him but if he could just somehow through desperation and effort be like hannah was that damn the temple with a painful desire with her lips just moving and the high priest thinking she was crazy and said have your desire that maybe perhaps he could stop the son of god and he stops him somehow supernaturally he touches the hem of his garment and christ stops and he beckons to him and under this sycamore tree you must be crying out you must be desperate you must want something from him and when he cries when he responds you must respond when he bids you come when you sense that pool you give in to it you got to leave behind your covering right leave behind whatever's precious come to him so he can say what what what do you want me to do for you now i've run out of time to really give this appropriate um time but the story that immediately precedes jesus healing bartimaeus is the rich young ruler he does prophesy of his death but just before this this interaction and in the story the rich young ruler the rich young ruler runs up to him and says good master this is polite right call him teacher good master what shall i do to inherit eternal life still still wanted to know what he could do raised well kept the commandments very wealthy he's a contrast to bartimaeus what can i do to inherit eternal life what was it that bartimaeus did he just ran into him and just responded and jesus this is what can i do for you if you'll just come to him with the right attitude you won't have to ask anything he's going to ask you what do you want and he says i kept all these commandments from my youth and everything and jesus says you lack one thing sell all thou hast distribute to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come follow me i think how remarkable that is because just in the next story as he's passing through jericho the story of zacchaeus he's like hey i'm going to bestow half my goods to the poor if i've done anything wrong by false accusation i'll restore him fourfold in other words i'm willing to get rid of everything i'm willing to make it right there's a reason why these stories are kind of clumped together in such beautiful comparison but now jesus is saying hey sell everything you have follow me and when he heard this the rich was very sorrowful for he was very rich i know some of us would like to be very rich but it'll lead to great sorrow as if jesus even says it's harder for a rich man to to have salvation exist for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle this is a this is a snare this is a danger this is a a part that we got to be very careful of and it's even symbolic in the sycamore tree but with zacchaeus excuse me with bartimaeus it says in verse 43 he says what what can i do for you he says i want my sight it says immediately he received his sight and followed him glorifying god and notice what a witness he became and all the people when they saw it gave praise unto god look at how willing and ready he was contrary to the rich young ruler to embrace christ and to follow him immediately he received his sight and followed him glorifying god and it became a great witness to the people i'll invite the musicians to come again this is my final statement in the sermon blind bartimaeus i think this is the different one that i've quoted from earlier i think there's 14 of these or so he said while the holy spirit is here we'll call the prayer line and pray for the sick he said everybody get your faith now and in your heart and notice how beautiful this is you don't have to say it in your mouth you remember your thoughts are louder than heaven than your voice is on earth you should say this o jesus thou son of david have mercy on me could it be possible that bartimaeus that day had been sitting there begging and not one person paid attention to him pleading for help i've just recently sacrificed my lamb i don't have a lamb anymore i need money to buy a lamb and as he cries of course people just ignore him just passing them by we started on the subject last week of empathy and and being ignored the pain of being ignored he's thinking about bartimaeus how often he might have been ignored how often he might have been cast down how often he might have been looked down upon but he says to us oh jesus we should be saying this thou son of david have mercy on me see if he'll do the same thing he did and then he says zacchaeus just pull out your fig leaf one time and look down he brings them both into view again right there and he says zacchaeus bartimaeus cry out thou son of david have mercy on me zacchaeus just pull your fig leaf one time and look down see if he isn't the same yesterday today and forever see if he doesn't do the same thing if you will pull out he excuse me he will pull you out speak to you and the good thing he'll go home with you tonight isn't that beautiful [Music] i don't want to just come to the church and speak to me through the fig leaves and just be happy okay all right yep that's good i really like that that's good and just stay in the in the cover of the fig leaves but he says you got to get pulled out and the same god that meets you here has got to be the god that goes home with you he says he'll go home with you tonight and have a talk with him before you go to bed you and your wife home will be changed it won't be like it used to be then when he goes home with you not just enjoying a gathering around a sycamore tree or underneath the shade of the tree or seeing something from the perch of its branches but you meet them and you go home with them that's the goal of the shade of the sycamore that's the reason why god has churches scattered throughout the valley churches all over the world why it becomes that place where he can call to you and not the place that well i guess i'm going to church to hear from god know a place where you've met him and you've known him and now he comes home with you it's a place of rest it's a place of feeding but it's a place where something starts and begins and he says home will be changed it won't be like it used to be when he goes home with you that's my prayer for us as a church as that whatever it is that we hear here whatever it is we're feeding on if we could stay true to the message if we could just let the word have preeminence if we could lift up the right things and you're feeding on that if you're taking these things home and you're making them applicable and you're letting christ have preeminence in your home life we're going to be creating the kind of atmosphere where zacchaeuses and bartimaeuses can hear christ it'll be a place where christ is happy to come to it'll be a place of healing to be a place of salvation it'll be a place to where people experience divine healing and come to their salvation and then begin to look to their translation [Music] oh let it be for us that it's not just a place we get comfortable [Music] but god i want to be available to you i want to i want to follow you i want to serve you i want to do what's right by you lord maybe you could just put that in your heart today [Music] help us lord just bow your heads i just sense a real sovereignty now [Music] you know i mentioned it a little while ago on in this series how that brother branham when he preached the seals [Music] at the end of every service he's saying i love him and he talked about how he purchased salvation on calvary's tree [Music] there was never a moment where he stopped offering salvation to the believer and i don't want us to ever get to a place as a church where salvation isn't available did you know there's churches that preach that the day of mercy's past there's no more salvation there's no more access to christ for deliverance i believe that the word is the same today as it's ever been and that salvation is available i've had different parents talk to me about how their children are desiring to be baptized i would that they would understand that it's not a church act it's not just something we do because it's what the bible says but it's done in recognition that jesus paid it all he purchased my salvation he shed his blood on calvary let us be conscious of those things in our family my wife even fellowshipping with me this past week is just desirous that we could have more conversations with our children around the things of god [Music] i think that would be wonderful [Music] if our children could be conscious that there's a place that you could walk in christ place of freedom it's bower heads in prayer if you need something from the lord just lift your hand to him [Music] lord jesus in your presence today we ask that you would hear our humble cry lord is very quiet over the building but may you hear their heart cry jesus thou son of david have mercy on me there be any soul that needs salvation [Music] may they run to you lord may they hear your voice beckoning whether we use the healing of bartimaeus's eyes as a type of salvation or whether we use the salvation of zacchaeus as a type of our salvation may they come to you because you bid or may we recognize you look up to us in our perch and say come down and i want to come home with you today maybe it's different for someone today maybe today they'll just yield to you and say lord i accept you i i don't know what it means but i'm going to cast off my covering lord and run to you [Music] but come down out of my tree and take you home with me today not be so worried about what we have to give up but be more focused on what we have to gain and lord i pray that this church would always be a place where salvation and divine healing are believed and we're willing to receive not a place where we're constantly in a state of questioning our salvation and constantly in the cycle of re-baptisms and constantly revisiting the altar and constantly trying to get prayed for for the same things but lord just have real genuine experiences where we meet you in your word and so we can believe for others as a church we're believing for sister marguerite lord because we've seen you touch our sister sandy so we can pray lord on her behalf sister yolini testified how you just kept her centered during a difficult week lord we hear that testimony and so it gives us courage to believe for ourselves today that you can help us this week lord i pray that you have mercy on us oh son of david have mercy on us commit all things to you in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen [Music] praise the lord thank you for your patience today
