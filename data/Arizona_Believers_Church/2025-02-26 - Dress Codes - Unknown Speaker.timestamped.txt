[0:00] but John chapter 19:
[0:03] 19-23 and I really wrestled with just
[0:06] what text to take and I'm not sure how
[0:08] far I'll get I was going to read the
[0:09] story of the Hebrew children in being
[0:12] thrown into the fiery furnace and uh it
[0:15] uh if I don't get that if I get that far
[0:17] we'll just recapture that story since
[0:19] we're dealing with u former knowledge
[0:21] for most of you anyways John chapter 19
[0:24] verse 19 and pilate wrote a title and
[0:27] put it on the cross and the writing was
[0:29] Jesus of Nazareth the king of the Jews
[0:32] this title then read many of the Jews
[0:34] for the place where Jesus was crucified
[0:36] was nigh to the city and it was written
[0:38] in Hebrew and Greek and Latin then said
[0:41] the chief priest of the Jews to pilate
[0:42] write not the king of the Jews but that
[0:45] he said I am King of the Jews pilate
[0:47] answered what I have written I have
[0:49] written very interesting signpost or
[0:52] display then the soldiers when they had
[0:55] crucified Jesus took his garments and
[0:57] made four parts to every Soldier a part
[0:59] and also his coat now the coat was
[1:02] without seam woven from the top
[1:04] throughout they said therefore among
[1:06] themselves let us not Rend it but cast
[1:08] lots for it whose it shall be that the
[1:10] scripture might be fulfilled which saith
[1:12] they parted my reignment among them and
[1:14] for my vesture did they cast lots these
[1:16] things therefore the soldiers did and I
[1:19] just read a little bit further in there
[1:21] but we just we desire God to take this
[1:23] word and give us some understanding so
[1:25] you can be
[1:28] seated I'll give you my title it here
[1:30] just in a moment so if you like to write
[1:32] down the text there's the text if You'
[1:33] like to write the title it'll come
[1:35] shortly but I want to start with First
[1:37] Corinthians chapter 7 verse 31 for this
[1:41] is this is where we were last Wednesday
[1:43] and Paul in addressing the shortness of
[1:46] time and the attitudes of people he said
[1:48] those that weep be as though You Weep
[1:50] not and those that rejoice as though you
[1:52] rejoice not and those that have wives be
[1:54] as though you had none and it was kind
[1:56] of relating to attitude and what you
[1:58] commit yourself to
[2:00] and what takes preeminence and his kind
[2:02] of conclusion is that you can attend
[2:04] unto the Lord without distraction and he
[2:06] makes this statement and they that use
[2:08] this world those that get something out
[2:10] of it and and leverage it and have use
[2:13] of it uh and taking something from it as
[2:16] not abusing it for the fashion of this
[2:18] world passeth away there's this uh
[2:21] acknowledgment that being in the world
[2:23] though we're not of the world being in
[2:25] the world we will have to make use of
[2:27] the world and that's from everything to
[2:29] drive your car wearing the clothes you
[2:31] have on tonight uh if we say it's either
[2:33] of God or of the world there's a lot of
[2:35] things in our lives that we know are of
[2:37] the world but he says those that use it
[2:39] don't abuse it that means if it's
[2:41] available to you don't fully use it
[2:43] because in using the world we can use it
[2:45] to such an extreme that it becomes our
[2:48] it is to our detriment it's this excess
[2:50] or lack of moderation that causes this
[2:53] Tipping Point where you can use the
[2:55] world and we use the world uh for income
[2:57] we use the world for certain needs and
[2:59] certain things but there's a point at
[3:01] which it that it can tip to become a
[3:03] detriment to us and that's what we used
[3:05] last Wednesday when we preached on the
[3:06] subject fashion that the Fashions of
[3:09] this world pass away and that word world
[3:12] is a cosmos which is adorning or
[3:14] decoration it's kind of like that
[3:16] orderly or harmonious Arrangement or the
[3:18] constitution of something and the way
[3:21] it's phrased in the Fashions of this
[3:23] world and if the world has fashioned
[3:25] something we saw that it's temporary
[3:27] that it doesn't really speak to someone
[3:29] the the Integrity of it it's not strong
[3:31] it's just temporary and the world's
[3:33] Fashions of these outward adorning and
[3:36] what you see by the eye it misleads that
[3:39] word passeth away means to lead aside it
[3:41] departs from the path that's on it
[3:43] quickly changes Direction and we all run
[3:45] out and we buy something because we want
[3:46] to be the cool kid and by the time we
[3:48] finally get home with it it's not cool
[3:50] anymore and that's how the Fashions of
[3:52] the world work it departs it changes
[3:54] it's uncertain and the word fashion is
[3:57] that uh word schema means the figure and
[4:00] so not only does it uh relate to the
[4:02] appearance of something but it's also uh
[4:05] the habitus the condition the appearance
[4:07] the way that they dress but it also
[4:08] speaks of actions and manner of life so
[4:11] worldly uh Fashions things of this world
[4:14] as far as Pursuits and habits all these
[4:16] forms are always shifting and always
[4:18] changing so Paul is saying those that
[4:20] use the world don't get comfortable with
[4:22] it don't sell yourself out to it because
[4:23] it's going to pull the rug out from
[4:24] underneath you it's not what we live by
[4:26] it's not what we live for that should
[4:28] not be our world so in 1 Peter 3:3 it
[4:32] says who's adorning speaking to a sister
[4:35] a believing uh lady who's adorning let
[4:38] it not be that outward adorning of
[4:40] platting the hair and of wearing of gold
[4:42] or of putting on of apparel and saying
[4:45] who's Cosmos it's the same word there
[4:47] that's used for the fashion which is the
[4:50] schema of this world is the cosmos whose
[4:53] World whose Arrangement let it not just
[4:56] be about the adorning of the hair and
[4:58] wearing of gold and putting on of a
[5:00] we could say this to all of us uh men or
[5:02] women or brother or sister that our your
[5:05] Cosmos or your world is not dressing to
[5:09] excite attract attraction our dressing
[5:12] isn't platting the hair so that it can
[5:13] turn heads our our dressing isn't
[5:15] wearing of gold or putting on a apparel
[5:17] that can signal something flashy or
[5:20] attractive but he says it's a meekness
[5:22] of spirit that ought to be our world so
[5:24] it's a humility and I could say this the
[5:27] bride's world is ordered it is arranged
[5:30] it is fashioned by the word amen God
[5:33] made the world in the beginning by his
[5:35] word the bride's reality her world her
[5:37] Cosmos is not just this outward uh
[5:40] making ourselves look good to fit in
[5:42] with the world but it is fashioned by
[5:44] the word and this is a point I'm
[5:46] carrying over to tonight and we said it
[5:48] last Wednesday to say that God looks in
[5:50] the heart and that a looking in the
[5:52] heart he knows the character of a man
[5:53] and God looks at you in your faith and
[5:55] you're justified by faith that truth
[5:58] that truth that God looks on the heart
[6:00] of a man and that in the eyes of God if
[6:02] you've been baptized uh sealed by the
[6:04] Holy Ghost and you're born again then
[6:07] God looking at your soul sees it as
[6:08] perfect and complete that's what God
[6:11] looks at but that truth does not stand
[6:13] for another truth that God doesn't care
[6:15] about or disregards your appearance we
[6:19] say well the soul is sealed and God
[6:20] looks on the heart it doesn't matter the
[6:22] way you look that's not true that truth
[6:24] that the God looks at the heart does not
[6:26] create a subsequent truth that God
[6:28] doesn't care about the
[6:30] outside God wants even your physical
[6:33] appearance to portray a spiritual
[6:35] message God wants the way that you act
[6:37] the way that you talk the way that you
[6:39] do your hair the way that you dress he
[6:40] wants there it to convey uh um what has
[6:44] happened even in your soul in
[6:46] Philippians chapter 2:8 and being found
[6:49] speaking of Jesus Christ being found in
[6:51] fashion as a man that's the schema of a
[6:54] man he humbled himself and became
[6:56] obedient unto death even the death of
[6:58] the cross I know I'm going over a lot
[7:00] more review from last time than maybe
[7:02] normal but I think this is good so that
[7:04] my dear friend doesn't think I'm crazy
[7:06] if this Foundation was necessary in
[7:08] preaching it but he say really I have
[7:11] more motive than just that but uh at
[7:14] least we got it out there that I'm
[7:16] nervous that Brother Paul's here but
[7:17] being found in the image of the fashion
[7:19] the habitus of a man in other words
[7:22] Jesus looked just like a man he dressed
[7:23] just like a man he ate just like a man
[7:25] he slept just like a man he did things
[7:27] that all men do even to the point to
[7:29] where uh the Pharisees took issue with
[7:31] how he lived his life as a man and but
[7:34] yet in that he humbled himself and
[7:36] became obedient to God's word so though
[7:39] you are in the fashion of a human being
[7:41] a man or a woman that we can find
[7:45] ourselves through humility being
[7:46] obedient to the word of God because
[7:49] Christ in flesh the word in flesh never
[7:52] changes God's nature or God's ways
[7:55] there's going to be humility and
[7:57] obedience and so our fashion must fit
[8:00] his form we can we're human we're going
[8:03] to dress we're going to wear human
[8:04] clothes and there's a certain way that
[8:06] we're going to conduct ourselves and do
[8:08] worldly things so to speak but yet even
[8:10] in doing it in our dressing in our
[8:12] activity and our Recreations and those
[8:13] things even to the point of the things
[8:15] that we would ingest and the way that we
[8:17] talk the things that we laugh at must
[8:19] still be in the his nature and his
[8:22] character Galatians 3: 27 for as many of
[8:26] you have have been baptized into Christ
[8:29] by one Spirit we're baptized into Christ
[8:32] so this is the new birth which is the
[8:33] Seal of God the baptism of the Holy
[8:35] Ghost by that spiritual baptism we are
[8:38] in the body of Christ so he says those
[8:40] who have been baptized into Christ have
[8:43] put on Christ This is a language of
[8:46] dressing this is a language of clothing
[8:49] this is a language of putting on
[8:51] something to give an appearance in
[8:53] Colossians 3: 12 and 13 it says put on
[8:57] therefore as the elect of God you who
[9:00] are the elect of God You Are Holy and
[9:02] beloved put on wear uh as I'm putting a
[9:06] garment on your flesh vowels of mercies
[9:09] kindness humbleness of Mind meekness
[9:11] longsuffering these are all very
[9:13] spiritual Concepts he says forbearing
[9:15] one another and forgiving one another If
[9:17] any man have a quarrel against any these
[9:18] are things we need to put
[9:20] on and so this is telling you if you're
[9:23] not wearing this wear it even as Christ
[9:26] forgave you so also do ye does not take
[9:28] away your ction does not take away your
[9:30] Holiness or your belovedness but he says
[9:32] as one who's been baptized into Christ
[9:34] we are to continue to put on Christ
[9:38] we're getting dressed so to speak so put
[9:41] on here in both instances as a term of
[9:43] dressing or clothing it would signify
[9:46] what someone is wearing and I realize
[9:49] that in many of these scriptures we're
[9:50] going to use tonight we would most often
[9:52] look at it in a spiritual sense but I
[9:56] want to make a point and this is where
[9:58] I'm going to give you my title my title
[9:59] tonight is dress
[10:01] codes and I had a lot of different
[10:03] titles I was working on um AI suggested
[10:06] holy drip I really liked it uh but I I I
[10:10] I decided not to but dress codes and I
[10:14] want to identify clearly in the
[10:16] scripture that how we dress is important
[10:18] to God I believe that there's a certain
[10:20] point at which we can without getting
[10:22] into the specifics of what kind of dress
[10:25] God desires specifically who says well
[10:27] he wants Holiness he wants righteousness
[10:28] he wants modesty well then we could
[10:30] argue about modesty one of my other
[10:32] titles is going to be between the burka
[10:33] and the
[10:35] bikini somewhere in the middle right is
[10:38] the modesty that God's looking for and
[10:40] so regard whether we get into the
[10:42] specifics or the extremes of it we must
[10:45] recognize and believe and come to this
[10:47] satisfaction that God does care about
[10:49] how you dress it matters to God how you
[10:52] look and add dress codes as we just keep
[10:55] this here for a moment a dress code
[10:57] would be a set of rules that kind of
[10:59] outline or specify what's required in
[11:01] terms of dress uh in a particular
[11:04] situation so it's a set of rules spec uh
[11:07] specifying the required manner of dress
[11:09] some sort of customary style of dress or
[11:11] for a specified group or a certain
[11:14] activity I think there's a meme out
[11:16] there that sometimes they take a picture
[11:17] of somebody and it says it's when you
[11:18] have class at noon and a boxing match at
[11:21] 1 and so they're dressed in a way where
[11:22] it looks like uh you know they got
[11:24] something that comes up later on or has
[11:26] a dual purpose and a code is a system of
[11:29] words or letters or figures or even
[11:31] symbols that convey meaning or signal
[11:34] something so I'm kind of using more than
[11:36] just one meaning here a jurass code is a
[11:38] set of rules but in it being a code we
[11:41] think oh it's rules but codes convey
[11:44] meaning codes convey a a something of
[11:48] substance a code could be some assigned
[11:50] series of letters or or numbers or
[11:52] symbols for the purpose of identifying
[11:55] something and the way that a person
[11:57] dresses forms a code that signifies
[12:00] their identity that conveys a certain
[12:03] meaning dress code is a language exactly
[12:08] dress codes or they have a dress code
[12:10] for certain things and like even
[12:11] Saturday night we had a a coup's dinner
[12:14] and it was for married couples and the
[12:15] widows and widowers in our in our
[12:17] assembly and and the dress code was
[12:19] business casual well there's a lot of
[12:22] people and and it's kind of given as a
[12:24] guideline and so people would dress and
[12:26] it didn't necessarily in our instance
[12:28] here we're just so laidback it didn't
[12:30] necessarily signify that um brother Paul
[12:32] thinks business casual is a tuxedo but
[12:35] there's just different ways of
[12:37] interpreting that to some people but
[12:38] that's what a dress Cod is for Black Tie
[12:41] formal different things are to signify
[12:44] the nature of the event and to also
[12:46] create an atmosphere around
[12:48] it it's one of the reasons for the Pomp
[12:51] and Circumstance with all the award
[12:52] shows and the way people dress it's to
[12:54] kind of create a certain culture a
[12:55] certain feeling to cultivate a certain
[12:58] atmosphere and certain signifying
[13:00] certain things through these dress codes
[13:03] there's certain award ceremonies that
[13:05] require women to wear high heels for men
[13:08] to wear tuxedos and and bold ties and
[13:10] they do this to create a particular
[13:12] image it's a language that conveys
[13:15] meaning in Matthew chap 23:5 I'd like
[13:18] for us to revisit some of these things
[13:20] to just see how that this applies uh as
[13:24] a language to signify the way you dress
[13:27] speaking to the Pharisees but all their
[13:28] works they do for to be seen of men
[13:30] notice the motive behind it is to
[13:33] attract the wrong
[13:34] attention it says they make broad their
[13:37] felies and enlarg the borders of their
[13:40] garments so they to bind the word upon
[13:42] them they it wasn't good enough just to
[13:45] meet the mark they wanted it to be
[13:46] extravagant so that it couldn't be
[13:48] missed and they weren't doing it to
[13:50] honor the Lord with their dedication to
[13:52] the word they were doing it to excess to
[13:55] signify I'm more spiritual than you it
[13:58] it's it's like sometimes they say the
[14:00] joke is the bigger the Bible the better
[14:02] the Christian right and some people are
[14:04] bringing their family bible to church
[14:05] and you're like there's just no way I
[14:07] can compete with this guy but it is
[14:09] something to signify and it says and
[14:11] they large the borders of their garments
[14:14] why they want to they want to be seen in
[14:17] what was doing it what they would carry
[14:19] what they would wear upon them their
[14:21] felies and the borders of their garments
[14:23] was a to socially amongst the people
[14:25] signify it became a dress code that they
[14:28] used to signal and to speak a language
[14:32] about who they were and Esther 8:15
[14:36] another example of how dress is used
[14:38] after morai had been recognized as one
[14:42] who saved the king from a
[14:44] conspiracy and it reminds me of one of
[14:47] my favorite Veggie
[14:48] Tales is the one on
[14:51] Esther and there's a point there where
[14:54] the one that I hope I didn't offend
[14:55] anybody but uh the hmon
[15:00] I don't come here if he's played by Mr
[15:01] Lunt or who he's played by but he is
[15:04] conspiring right and so those who
[15:07] disobey the word of God get banished to
[15:09] the aisle of Perpetual
[15:12] tickling and so more hmon thinks he's
[15:16] really set it up in morai is going to
[15:20] really going to have it and and he and
[15:23] they've gone out and they've done
[15:24] something a and is Mori is all happy and
[15:28] Mr hmon says you won't be laughing
[15:31] tomorrow or yes you will never mind
[15:34] right because he was going to be
[15:35] banished to the aisle of P Perpetual
[15:38] tickling I just needed to say something
[15:39] to Draw Rowan into the service this
[15:42] evening and and so here Mori goes out
[15:47] from the presence of the king and the
[15:48] King has declared I want him to be
[15:50] recognized for his great service and he
[15:52] doesn't just put them in Uber black and
[15:54] send them around the city he wants it to
[15:56] be conspicuous he wants to signal to the
[15:59] people some honor so it says in Royal
[16:01] apparel of the blue and white and with
[16:03] the great crown of gold and with a
[16:05] garment of fine linen and purple and the
[16:07] City of shashan rejoiced and was glad so
[16:11] he used Royal apparel certain colors a
[16:14] great crown of gold and Garment of fine
[16:16] linen and purple he didn't want to be
[16:18] mistaken for a valet driver no one
[16:21] wanted to think that the Royal Chariot
[16:22] had been stolen but he wanted to signify
[16:25] this is somebody who's being honored by
[16:28] allowing him to wear Royal garments so
[16:31] there was a way that he dressed there
[16:33] was a certain expectation or code for
[16:35] Kings how they dressed and now as he's
[16:37] wearing it the way he looks conveys
[16:39] something just going to reference uh
[16:41] American goth it very quickly I'm sure
[16:44] some of you are familiar with this it's
[16:46] by Grant Wood the 1930 and I'm just
[16:49] curious do anybody know who these people
[16:51] are not personally but what they might
[16:53] do anybody want to guess farmer now what
[16:57] made you think that yeah well the
[16:59] Pitchfork is one thing they're dressed
[17:02] humble people working people and there's
[17:04] a certain sense of conveying through the
[17:07] way they dress a and the way that they
[17:09] present themselves they they have this
[17:11] very austere look and so these are
[17:12] hardworking humble people from the earth
[17:15] so to speak and I'm going to maybe use
[17:17] more images later on in this at a future
[17:20] service but I'm wanting you just to
[17:22] consider how that the way someone
[17:24] dresses and especially if you're
[17:25] portraying something through a medium
[17:27] such as painting that you're going to
[17:29] deduce by what they wear and what's
[17:31] around them who they are and what their
[17:33] status is if all you have is a glimpse
[17:35] if all you have is a moment we can say
[17:37] well I'm Christians come and visit me
[17:39] spend some time at my home go to church
[17:41] with me and if you've spent enough time
[17:43] with me maybe there's a way that you
[17:44] would know that I'm a Christian but if
[17:46] someone only has a glimpse it really
[17:49] says a lot about that moment where they
[17:51] see you where you don't want to look so
[17:53] much like the world that you just blend
[17:56] in right good in Luke chap 16: 19 it
[18:00] says there was a certain rich man Devas
[18:02] Dives however you want to say it which
[18:03] was clothed in purple and fine linen and
[18:06] fared sumptuously every day the way that
[18:08] he dressed signified that he was rich
[18:11] separated him from The Peasants or the
[18:13] the the Beggars at his door and if I
[18:16] could say this there is a Biblical dress
[18:19] code it is developed using God's
[18:21] language that's right and that God has
[18:24] written things in his word a certain
[18:26] code that if we will engage in it and
[18:28] let run its course in our lives that
[18:30] there's something that it wants to
[18:32] feature something that it wants to
[18:33] display and that there is a Biblical
[18:36] dress code that's right in Matthew chap
[18:39] 22: 1 11 and 12 says and when the king
[18:42] came in to see the guest and I'm just
[18:44] jumping right into the middle of this
[18:45] Parable he says so there's this wedding
[18:47] Feast this wedding supper the king comes
[18:50] in and he sees all these guests and he
[18:51] saw there a man which had not a wedding
[18:54] garment and he saith unto him friend how
[18:57] camest thou in hither not having a
[18:59] wedding garment and he was
[19:02] speechless this is alluding to brother
[19:04] banam goes to Great Links to explain
[19:06] some of these things and it's commonly
[19:08] accepted in the through for Bible
[19:10] students that there was this custom
[19:11] where in these type of Feasts that a
[19:13] host would provide the appropriate
[19:15] garments for those who attended the
[19:17] feast and you would be properly you
[19:20] would be properly dressed and everyone
[19:22] would dress that way so that in the
[19:24] party or at the feast there would be no
[19:27] everyone would be dressed the same
[19:28] regardless of their social class
[19:31] regardless of how much money they had or
[19:32] how far they traveled or what their
[19:34] circumstance might be the host would do
[19:36] that and in doing it the evening would
[19:38] be cohesive and I I'm not so much sure
[19:41] that a lot of it had to do with
[19:42] Instagram at the time where they wanted
[19:44] everything just to look just right for
[19:45] the pictures there's this painter over
[19:47] there in the corner feverishly painting
[19:49] everyone dressed in white and but yet
[19:51] there's this uh image that they want to
[19:53] portray and notice that the king walks
[19:56] into the room in a immediately know that
[20:00] the man was not wearing the provided
[20:01] wedding garment he immediately knew
[20:04] there wasn't this spectrum of all well
[20:05] it can go through this way and it can go
[20:07] that way he immediately knew because it
[20:09] stood outer clashed with how everyone
[20:11] else was dressed the king had provided
[20:14] garments to wear for the wedding supper
[20:16] this one did not get the Garment did not
[20:18] follow the instructions was not dressed
[20:20] in a way that declared and showed what
[20:23] was right and what was proper that's
[20:26] right that's good and so I believe that
[20:28] what we ought to realize is that our
[20:30] clothing or our appearance is not
[20:32] without consequence or
[20:34] meaning EXC there are it's and we
[20:40] wouldn't want to necessarily come up
[20:41] with a set of rules and say you can only
[20:42] order these clothes with these skew
[20:44] numbers from these websites but it's a
[20:47] challenge to those of us who are
[20:48] dressing ourselves or dressing our
[20:51] children are working together in a way
[20:53] to please the Lord as a family that we
[20:55] have this mindset that not just anything
[20:58] goes
[20:59] as long as it's
[21:02] closed in Revelations 19: 7 to8 just
[21:06] carrying on with this subject of not
[21:08] having a wedding garment and how it was
[21:11] something appropriate for the occasion
[21:13] there was a dress code for this wedding
[21:15] Feast it says in Revelations 19: 78 let
[21:19] us be glad and rejoice and give honor to
[21:21] him for the marriage of the Lamb is come
[21:24] and his wife hath made herself
[21:27] ready and to her was granted that she
[21:30] should be arrayed in fine linen clean
[21:32] and white for the fine linen is the
[21:34] righteousness of
[21:36] saints the Bible just does not uh
[21:40] comment that she dressed herself for a
[21:42] wedding it says she made herself ready
[21:45] and they begin to speak about the things
[21:47] that she was
[21:48] granted and she should be because she
[21:51] was to be arrayed in fine linen clean
[21:53] and white and it signified the Holiness
[21:56] and the righteousness and the correct n
[21:59] of the Saints and it says it was given
[22:02] it was given to her so it was not it was
[22:05] given if I can say it was given because
[22:07] it was required if it didn't matter well
[22:10] you know come as you are remain as you
[22:12] are but it was required so it was
[22:14] commissioned therefore it was supplied
[22:17] that's right when it says it was given
[22:18] to her it was furnished he furnished the
[22:20] Necessities for the wife to make herself
[22:24] ready God wasn't even necessarily
[22:27] stressing about it and ringing his hand
[22:28] hands and say here let me put this on
[22:29] here let me put that on he provides the
[22:31] word he provided the Necessities he
[22:33] provided that which we're to dress
[22:35] ourselves in and we dress ourselves in
[22:38] that just as Esther went before the king
[22:41] in those things that the servant had
[22:42] made available to her she didn't try to
[22:45] dress herself she didn't try to impress
[22:47] the king she went with the instructions
[22:49] that the the servant knew the servant of
[22:52] the king knew would catch the king's eye
[22:55] in Revelations 21:2 it says John saw the
[22:57] holy city knew Jerusalem coming down
[22:59] from God out of Heaven prepared as a
[23:02] bride adorned for her husband that word
[23:05] adorned means made ready she dressed
[23:07] herself she was dressed appropriately
[23:09] for the occasion why because there's
[23:11] dress codes for the occasion of a
[23:14] marriage this is a rule that's maybe
[23:17] quite often violated maybe not amongst
[23:19] our circles but on the wedding day the
[23:21] bride wears the white dress and dare
[23:24] anybody else do
[23:26] that because it would it would violate
[23:29] decorum it would violate these certain
[23:30] boundaries there's a dress code I know
[23:32] we're all familiar with the concept of a
[23:34] dress code here the bride has adorned
[23:36] and made herself ready who for her
[23:39] husband there's something that she has
[23:42] in mind when she's making herself
[23:44] ready we see this at the end of the book
[23:48] The Bible in Revelations 21 it's given
[23:51] to her to be array in a certain clothing
[23:54] we know in the Book of Genesis as we
[23:56] looked at it here recently how that when
[23:57] man fell when he first became conscious
[24:00] of his nakedness it was his instinct to
[24:02] cover it up uh immodesty nakedness uh is
[24:08] the is the human instinct to cover up if
[24:12] they don't have that instinct it's
[24:14] because through the particular culture
[24:17] and the process of time they've just
[24:18] gone numb to it right uh or it's in some
[24:22] sort of setting where they have it's
[24:24] never been shamed or scandalized as we
[24:26] see some people they're still Native and
[24:28] they dress a certain way and it doesn't
[24:29] maybe hold the same attraction to other
[24:31] people but here we could think of in
[24:34] Genesis as soon as they sinned they
[24:36] covered
[24:37] themselves because they were ashamed
[24:40] once they saw the power of these things
[24:42] and how it could be used they they
[24:44] covered that but that wasn't enough for
[24:46] God man's instinct to only do so much
[24:49] wasn't enough but it says in Genesis
[24:51] 3:21 and unto Adam also and to his wife
[24:54] did the Lord God make coats of skins and
[24:57] clothe them
[24:59] God institutes clothing you say well the
[25:02] original way is this no God institutes
[25:05] clothing in the end of the book we're
[25:06] not back in the original form of being
[25:09] naked and not being ashamed God clothes
[25:12] the bride clothes herself there are
[25:14] garments there are ways to dress that
[25:16] are represented in the scripture amen it
[25:18] was a covering for the body what did he
[25:20] use the innocence of a
[25:22] lamb it signifies humility and
[25:25] modesty was not just a loin cloth that
[25:28] man put on but it was a full
[25:31] garment as we looked at this scripture
[25:33] in the past we saw how that it's most
[25:36] likely that God did not literally slay
[25:39] the lamb and Stitch the
[25:41] Garment but he provided for it as he did
[25:43] in Revelations 198 he gave them the
[25:46] Revelation this is what you ought to do
[25:49] and Adam went and slew the lamb and he
[25:50] and his wife made clo why because God
[25:54] gave it to them gave them the revelation
[25:58] that they ought to dress themselves more
[26:01] than just with their fig
[26:03] leaves so I Believe by Revelation God's
[26:06] bride has by Revelation the bride has
[26:10] God's dress
[26:11] code Brother B said it's his own word
[26:14] it's his righteousness that we're
[26:15] dressed in and Isaiah 61:3 again we're
[26:19] just wanting to clearly identify in
[26:20] Scripture that what you wear your
[26:22] garments are important to God they have
[26:24] meaning and significance if I could say
[26:27] this a lot of the script we're going to
[26:28] use are going to refer to maybe a
[26:30] spiritual principle but it's going to
[26:32] use a language that speaks of how we
[26:33] dress and we shouldn't dismiss in this
[26:36] process that oh he's just using as a
[26:38] type it means how you dress is so
[26:40] significant and important and conveys
[26:42] such Rich meaning that God can use it as
[26:45] a
[26:46] type it's like God does with the love
[26:48] his own love he has to compare it to a
[26:50] love of a mother so that we can begin to
[26:52] understand and we don't just dismiss the
[26:54] love of a mother and just say well God's
[26:55] different we say no that's the way a
[26:57] mother should love
[26:58] because God wants to use it to compare
[27:00] himself to in Isaiah 61:3 to appoint
[27:03] unto them that mourn in Zion I know
[27:05] there's a lot of scriptures here we're
[27:07] leaving out but to give unto them Beauty
[27:09] for Ashes this would signify an
[27:12] appearance where one is trying to show
[27:14] themselves in mourning the oil of joy
[27:16] for mourning the Garment of Praise for
[27:19] the spirit of heaviness that they might
[27:21] be called the Trees of Righteousness the
[27:23] plain in the Lord that he might be
[27:24] glorified God wants to change your
[27:27] appearance with Beauty for ashes oil of
[27:29] joy for mourning and swap out the spirit
[27:31] of heaviness with the Garment of Praise
[27:33] so that you can be identified as
[27:35] righteous trees that God has planted
[27:38] you're not wishy-washy you're not
[27:39] spineless that you that he might be
[27:41] glorified the Lord this Garment of
[27:45] Praise it's a dressing or clothing that
[27:48] signifies
[27:50] joy and though most might just say well
[27:53] this it's meant to refer to a joyful
[27:55] Spirit but a Garment of Praise In this
[27:58] context contrast the sackcloth that
[28:01] someone who's mourning would wear and
[28:04] you wouldn't try to figure out say I
[28:05] can't tell if they're laughing or crying
[28:07] you could tell by the sackcloth that
[28:09] they probably are wanting you to think
[28:11] they're crying you could tell by the
[28:12] ashes that they're trying to portray
[28:15] that they're grieving and they're
[28:16] mourning and God says I don't want you
[28:18] to be looked down on anymore I want you
[28:20] to dress and act and wear a character
[28:23] about you that shows that you know who
[28:25] you are that you know your position I
[28:27] like that brother yes sir amen
[28:29] Ecclesiastes 9:8 it says let thy
[28:31] garments be always white and let thy
[28:34] head lack no ointment white is a token
[28:37] of
[28:38] Joy this spotlessness this white garment
[28:41] it symbolizes the righteousness of
[28:43] Christ he wants to swap out a spirit of
[28:46] heaviness for garments of praise the
[28:48] Bible says let your garments always be
[28:51] white it's a dress code for the occasion
[28:55] think about it a dress code for the
[28:57] occasion a dress code for the
[28:59] season I I don't know if I've used it
[29:01] here necessarily but when you pack for a
[29:04] vacation and where you're going
[29:05] somewhere you don't you don't pack for
[29:07] where you are you pack for where you're
[29:10] going and when we know that we're going
[29:12] to an eternal righteous holy city then
[29:15] we prepare accordingly so that we we
[29:19] ought to be those kind of people that
[29:20] find ourselves at the point of dep
[29:22] departure and everyone else is dressed
[29:23] for the winter and they look over at us
[29:25] and be like he must be going to
[29:27] somewhere warm well in the opposite we
[29:29] got a lot of people around here who
[29:31] dress for a place that's going to be
[29:32] really really hot and we should be
[29:33] dressed for a place that's going to be
[29:35] holy a place that's going to be
[29:39] righteous there there ought to be an
[29:41] outward adorning that signifies that
[29:44] we're ready to meet the challenge of the
[29:46] moment there ought to be some sort of
[29:48] outward adorning that says I've got work
[29:50] to do and I'm dressed for that
[29:54] work and Isaiah 59:17 the scripture
[29:57] speaks to that Prin principle for he put
[29:59] on righteousness as a breastplate and a
[30:02] helmet of salvation upon his head and he
[30:04] put on the garments of Vengeance for
[30:06] clothing and was clad with Zeal as a
[30:08] cloak it uses the breastplate the helmet
[30:11] the robe a a a and the clothing and a
[30:15] cloak all to convey an attitude a
[30:19] disposition and to signify what he's
[30:21] about to
[30:23] do knows if you were going to dig a
[30:25] ditch you might have boots on and a
[30:26] shovel in your hand
[30:28] and you're you're prepared you're
[30:30] adorned for the occasion for the moment
[30:32] there's a dress code that's required for
[30:34] work that needs to be done and they
[30:36] figured enough out I don't know if we've
[30:37] baned disbanded OSHA yet maybe that's on
[30:40] the table coming up but there's uh
[30:42] there's certain requirements in certain
[30:44] workplaces like wear steel toed shoes
[30:46] because you never know when a piece of
[30:47] metal might fall and hit you on your
[30:49] foot and there goes your toesies right
[30:51] there's a way that you dress wear a
[30:52] helmet wear this do that wear goggles
[30:54] there's things it's dress code because
[30:56] of what you're doing and you want to be
[30:58] prepared for the activity in Isaiah
[31:02] 61:10 notice now he that had a
[31:04] breastplate and a helmet and garments
[31:06] says I will greatly rejoice in the Lord
[31:08] my soul shall be joyful in my God for he
[31:10] hath clothed me with the garments of
[31:12] Salvation he hath covered me with the
[31:15] robe of righteousness as a bridegroom
[31:18] dethorn and as a bride adorne herself
[31:20] with her
[31:22] Jewels it it it's it's of those Customs
[31:24] there's some uh religions and some
[31:27] cultures where there's a very specific
[31:30] way that a bridegroom would dress and
[31:31] there's certain things he's going to
[31:32] Adorn himself with and it would signify
[31:34] to everybody else he's getting
[31:37] married and I know that in our culture
[31:40] that there's been a lot of changes in
[31:41] how weddings are conducted where you can
[31:44] wear whatever you want maybe or dress
[31:46] however you want and that's certainly
[31:47] fine there's no scriptural prescription
[31:49] for it but the point is there's usually
[31:51] some identifying
[31:53] Factor if we were all going to wear
[31:55] overalls for brother loy's wedding uh uh
[31:58] we would all have overalls in a white
[32:00] press shirt and and but brother loy's
[32:03] overalls might be a different color I
[32:05] have no idea if he's engaged I don't
[32:07] know if he's in a relationship uh I know
[32:09] he's out of town for work so it just
[32:10] makes a very convenient uh punching bag
[32:13] but he would wear something to
[32:15] distinguish him from all the other
[32:17] bridegroom or the groomsmen right
[32:19] something and and same with the bride
[32:21] could you imagine a whole bridal party
[32:23] men and women all showing up in wedding
[32:25] dresses like whoa who's getting married
[32:29] right you can't even tell by a beard
[32:32] anymore and Isaiah 51 52:1 it says
[32:36] notice this awake awake put on thy
[32:38] strength o Zion where is her strength
[32:41] put on thy beautiful garments oh
[32:43] Jerusalem the holy city for henceforth
[32:45] there shall no more come into Thee the
[32:47] uncircumcised and the unclean your
[32:50] strength is identified by your
[32:52] dress your character your integrity your
[32:55] strength your your confidence is
[32:57] indicated by what you wear yes now
[33:00] please just bear with me I don't want to
[33:02] go lengthy tonight that's not my desire
[33:04] at all but I do have a lot that I want
[33:06] to continue to
[33:08] express when we read these things
[33:11] especially if we say a spirit of
[33:13] heaviness and a Garment of Praise
[33:15] there's something abstract about that
[33:18] there may be something intangible about
[33:21] well what is a spirit of heaviness and
[33:23] what is a Garment of Praise And there's
[33:25] certain things we might say well let
[33:26] your garments be always we might say
[33:28] well some have taken that to create a
[33:31] cult that only wears white right there's
[33:34] certain things that people take and they
[33:35] really construe it as a literal
[33:37] prescription to dress a certain way
[33:39] we're only going to wear fine linen and
[33:40] it's only going to be white so there is
[33:43] something uh that we don't take as a
[33:47] literal mandate to wear only white but
[33:50] there's something symbolized by that
[33:52] white which is the Bible says the
[33:53] righteousness of the Saints this fine
[33:55] linen and I could go I'll go further to
[33:58] say that there is something intangible
[34:00] and uh abstract about a personal
[34:04] revelation of Jesus Christ a personal
[34:07] revelation of Jesus Christ is exactly
[34:09] that it's personal when you get a
[34:11] revelation of Jesus Christ I don't share
[34:13] in that Revelation the moment that you
[34:15] received the Holy Ghost and you knew
[34:17] that you were born again I wasn't
[34:18] somewhere else going oh my goodness
[34:21] Elliot just got the Holy Ghost it's not
[34:24] how it happens it's very personal I I
[34:27] and there may be those that would uh
[34:29] brother Brandon may be working sometimes
[34:31] in a prophetic realm and he'd be able to
[34:33] see the the pillar fire fall on somebody
[34:35] and he may identify a spiritual
[34:36] experience but speaking in general the
[34:38] personal revelation of Jesus Christ is
[34:40] to the
[34:42] individual it's inward it's
[34:44] deep and so the scriptures constantly as
[34:48] we've already referenced these things
[34:49] that are intangible or abstract God's
[34:52] word demonstrates that there is a
[34:54] physical portrayal of our spiritual
[34:56] revelation
[34:58] James says that God sees your faith and
[35:00] you're Justified but your faith has
[35:03] works and it's by those works that it
[35:05] declares and portrays a spiritual
[35:09] Revelation in second Peter chap 3:14
[35:11] wherefore beloved see that you look for
[35:13] such see and that you look for such
[35:15] things be diligent that you may be found
[35:18] of him in peace without spot and
[35:22] blameless this without spot and
[35:24] blameless yes we are uh innocent before
[35:27] God our souls having been Justified but
[35:30] there's still this pursuit of this
[35:31] Perfection cannot be sinless Perfection
[35:34] because you're born in sin you we all
[35:36] have a past but there is a desire to be
[35:39] without spot and without blemish is as
[35:42] the scriptures teach that these things
[35:44] that are happening in your your your uh
[35:46] communion services are spots in your
[35:48] Feast of Charity and there should be
[35:50] this desire to cleanse and to check
[35:52] ourselves up and to be sure that we're
[35:54] operating not with the excuse that we
[35:56] all have spots
[35:58] but the desire that we would be without
[36:01] spot and blameless we've already covered
[36:03] that a lot in in looking at
[36:06] Holiness this this goes to this extends
[36:09] to our outward appearance not just that
[36:12] our conscience would be pure but having
[36:15] a heart that's purged from
[36:16] unrighteousness a soul that's sealed and
[36:18] a spirit that's being renewed by the
[36:20] word of God uh I think it would be good
[36:22] if it kind of seeped out a bit in your
[36:25] words seeped out in your actions in the
[36:28] way that you dress 1 Peter chap 2: 9 and
[36:32] 10 in like manner also that women Adorn
[36:35] themselves in modest apparel this is
[36:38] very specific you cannot construe this
[36:41] to say oh it's just referring to this
[36:43] cute little knit sweater around the
[36:46] heart just a little Chicken Soup for the
[36:48] Soul no this is literal it's saying that
[36:51] a woman a sister in the body of Christ
[36:54] ought to dress and cover herself with
[36:57] modest apparel rate me debate debate me
[36:59] on what modest apparel is but at least
[37:01] we're debating that the apparel must be
[37:03] modest right that it's a requirement
[37:06] scripture requirement now it's not just
[37:08] the modest apparel but there's a
[37:10] shamefacedness and sobriety that goes
[37:12] with it so we cannot just everyone wear
[37:15] white and somehow achieve this holy
[37:17] status it's with shamefacedness and
[37:19] sobriety not with broided hair or gold
[37:22] or pearls or costly array but which
[37:25] becometh women professing godliness with
[37:28] good works I know that we could really
[37:30] stir up a debate on braided hair gold or
[37:33] pearls or costly array but notice that
[37:35] Paul is hitting at this desire to
[37:38] present yourself in a way that attracts
[37:40] the attention of the world for the wrong
[37:42] reasons it's not something that makes
[37:44] somebody thirsty because you're being
[37:45] salty but it makes somebody competitive
[37:47] because you're being
[37:49] salty right you're dressing in a way to
[37:51] provoke and to instigate that's right
[37:54] I'm laying in this Foundation because I
[37:56] want us to see and Lord will we'll get
[37:57] to it on Sunday how that there is a
[37:59] consequence for dressing provocatively
[38:02] in a way that is designed for sexual
[38:06] attraction and when God in Deuteronomy
[38:08] 22:5 says that a woman shouldn't wear a
[38:10] man's garment and a man shouldn't wear a
[38:12] woman's garment at the heart of it is
[38:14] that model of dressing for sexual
[38:16] attraction or to express or to to
[38:19] declare in some way your sex beyond that
[38:22] which is normal or god-given
[38:28] a woman ought to dress in modest apparel
[38:30] in a way that is becoming of a woman
[38:32] that professes to be Godly and she must
[38:35] also be sober and
[38:36] shamefaced Ephesians chap 5: 27 speaking
[38:39] of Christ that he might present it to
[38:41] himself a glorious church not having
[38:44] spot or wrinkle what does that refer to
[38:47] the spot or wrinkle is your FL your
[38:48] garments the spot or wrinkle is using
[38:51] the image of a a robe or a gown uh some
[38:55] sort of uh clothing or garment not
[38:57] having spot or wrinkle or any such thing
[38:59] but that it should be holy and without
[39:01] blemish it's not just the flesh it's not
[39:04] just the spirit as we looked at the
[39:06] requirements of the sacrifice and those
[39:08] things that were Abomination to God will
[39:10] always remain Abomination and the rules
[39:12] of the sacrifice is pointed to a perfect
[39:14] sacrifice which is Christ and we found
[39:16] that the same requirements for Christ
[39:18] are the same requirements for us as he
[39:20] was without blemish and without spot as
[39:22] an innocent sacrifice we too are to also
[39:24] be without spot and blemish and it uses
[39:27] a language that refers to our
[39:29] clothing I think sometimes that's why we
[39:31] like to wear linen because it can look
[39:33] better wrinkled no which one is it it's
[39:36] corduroy remember my brother one time
[39:37] was wearing a sear sucker suit and a
[39:40] brother showed up and said man where do
[39:41] you plug that thing
[39:44] in in Revelations 3:4 thou Hast a few
[39:47] names in Sardis which have not defiled
[39:50] their
[39:51] garments this is speaking literally of
[39:53] their clothing and they shall walk with
[39:56] me in white for they are them there's
[39:58] some illusion to even the prescriptions
[40:00] in the law where one would handle
[40:02] something with their garment and it
[40:04] would be kept a certain way and that
[40:06] garment would be considered unclean or
[40:07] defiled and a priest or someone else
[40:09] wouldn't be able to perform a certain
[40:11] function or enter a certain place but he
[40:13] says there's people who have not defiled
[40:15] their garments he talking about clothing
[40:18] that is in some way perverted or defiled
[40:20] or
[40:21] spotted they shall walk with me in white
[40:24] for they are
[40:25] worthy Revelations chap 16:15 behold I
[40:29] come as a thief blessed is he that WTH
[40:31] and keepeth his garments lest he walk
[40:33] naked and they see his
[40:35] shame it's the one that watches needs to
[40:38] be dressed for watching right there's
[40:41] this illusion to the the priest who
[40:43] would walk about the temple in the
[40:44] mountain and at a certain time there
[40:46] were certain Le Levites that would need
[40:47] to be on guard and he would go and he
[40:50] would try to find those who were uh
[40:52] awake if they were awake and they were
[40:54] sleeping he would Rous them up but if
[40:55] someone had taken off their clothes and
[40:57] fall asleep he would this is just the
[40:58] story that's used traditionally he would
[41:00] burn their clothes so that when they
[41:02] woke from their watch they would be
[41:03] shamed in walking back home
[41:06] naked and there there's this requirement
[41:09] then that speaks of if you're on guard
[41:11] if you're watching then dress
[41:13] appropriately we're not dressed for
[41:15] sleep it's high time that we awake out
[41:17] of sleep that we dress a certain way we
[41:20] act a certain way cuz as Paul says in
[41:22] Romans that this is a time where we got
[41:24] to awake to righteousness we got to
[41:26] dress ourselves in clothes ourselves not
[41:28] just in our thought process but in a
[41:29] thought process and a way of discerning
[41:32] that has implications in the way that we
[41:34] treat one another talk to each other
[41:36] dress raise our children it covers
[41:39] everything brother Paul you shared this
[41:41] with me decades ago on the phone but we
[41:43] were talking about the third pool in the
[41:44] open of the word and you said that your
[41:46] desire was to take those things a and
[41:49] where rubber met the road and made make
[41:52] the seventh seal
[41:54] practical that's what God's wanting us
[41:56] to do is not have Gatherings like this
[41:59] where it's just magic the Gathering and
[42:00] we're all just playing cards and we can
[42:01] go home and be something else but we
[42:03] want to find where this word that is so
[42:06] elusive can become concrete and lived
[42:09] out in
[42:10] lives yes sir blessed is he that watches
[42:14] who's on Watch Who's to be looking and
[42:16] is dressed that way so that he doesn't
[42:19] find himself not dressed appropriately
[42:21] and he's
[42:22] ashamed in Exodus 12 when they're in
[42:25] their Exodus not did he tell them how to
[42:27] prepare the lamb how to eat the lamb but
[42:29] he told him how to dress and thus shall
[42:31] you eat it with your loins gted and your
[42:34] shoes on your feet and your staff in
[42:37] your hand and you shall eat it in haste
[42:39] it is the Lord's
[42:40] Passover someone could say I've already
[42:43] done all this with a one-year-old lamb
[42:45] and I did it this way and I prepared it
[42:47] and I may eat all of it and now I've got
[42:49] to have shoes on my feet and I've got to
[42:52] have my loins guarded yeah and a staff
[42:54] in your hand is this enough
[42:57] and God says there's a reason for it God
[43:00] had a dress code for the Passover
[43:02] meal and what did what did the dress
[43:04] signify they're ready to
[43:06] leave what would it say about somebody
[43:09] if they believe this is the last meal
[43:10] before the death angel passes over and
[43:12] on the tomorrow we're going to leave
[43:13] Egypt and they haven't bothered packing
[43:16] it all they didn't bother dressing they
[43:18] didn't bother uh looking the part they
[43:19] didn't bother doing anything that would
[43:21] signify I believe I'm leaving in the
[43:23] morning I believe that I'm reflecting a
[43:25] holy place I believe I'm a bride that's
[43:27] prepared for her husband but nothing
[43:29] changes in the outward nothing changes
[43:31] in the tongue nothing changes in the
[43:33] relationships to signify that they
[43:34] really believe
[43:36] it their loins were girded it was a way
[43:38] that showed that they were they could
[43:40] quickly move shoes on their feet they
[43:42] didn't have to go running and looking
[43:43] around for their slips they were ready
[43:46] staff in
[43:48] hand and I say God has an ordained dress
[43:51] code amen there are dress codes the
[43:53] world has them all sorts of situation
[43:55] has them but God has an or dress code to
[43:58] express his character it's his nature
[44:00] and his
[44:02] way doing fantastic on time I'm just
[44:04] encouraging myself in the Lord we're
[44:05] doing fantastic on time tonight so I'll
[44:08] just make reference to the sermon we
[44:10] preached on deceptive form recently
[44:12] where there's shapes and forms that
[44:14] signify something that's not there right
[44:18] it's done to deceive that's what
[44:19] Deuteronomy 225 is all about is a woman
[44:23] in any way relinquishing her glory as a
[44:26] woman in mixing signals as a man to look
[44:29] like a man same with the man it's a
[44:31] deceptive form so this God's dress code
[44:35] is not an external
[44:37] thing alone it's got to be this internal
[44:40] work of God that works its way to the
[44:43] out in 2 Timothy 3:5 speaking of the end
[44:47] time they have a form of godliness but
[44:50] denying the power thereof the power of
[44:52] Revelation brother BR says from such
[44:53] turn away they can have the appearance
[44:56] of good but Evil Within they can have a
[44:59] form of godliness but be
[45:02] Godless and so our Holiness is not
[45:06] hypocritical we're not just trying to
[45:08] achieve a form of
[45:11] godliness I this is I think sometimes
[45:14] and I wasn't maybe planning on saying
[45:15] this here but sometimes there's this
[45:17] attitude uh uh that we can get where if
[45:19] a brother wears something that's pink
[45:21] well he's just a pervert like well I can
[45:24] just guess where you were born right
[45:26] because they just think any kind of pink
[45:28] you're you're a pervert right and it's
[45:29] just all they get really worked up and
[45:31] they're just judging on color alone well
[45:34] if if we're not careful by by this uh by
[45:39] taking away certain things that we can't
[45:41] wear we're subconsciously signaling that
[45:44] we can be virtuous by only what we
[45:47] wear if we say well we're not allowed to
[45:49] wear pink if we're brothers we we can't
[45:51] wear pink well you've just bought into
[45:53] some 19 20th century uh modality that
[45:57] they came up with because it it wasn't
[45:59] always that way there wasn't always
[46:02] these color schemes where this is for
[46:04] the girls and this is for the boys that
[46:07] was probably just a commercialization
[46:09] thing like we need to sell more blue
[46:10] well make blue for
[46:12] men oh it worked let's make a color for
[46:15] the girls pink boom right or maybe it
[46:18] was just a matter of trying to tell the
[46:19] difference of babies in the nurseries
[46:21] cuz we're no longer having home birth
[46:23] right we got 40 babies in a nursery War
[46:25] it's like who's a girl who's a boy right
[46:26] right there's ways you want to tell them
[46:28] apart by quickly
[46:31] glancing and so there's this idea that
[46:34] we can have this construct in our minds
[46:36] that well if we avoid this and avoid
[46:37] that but it's not that
[46:40] alone we can have the appearance of
[46:43] godliness the form of it but lack the
[46:47] Revelation that drives behind it so I'm
[46:50] not advocating for us sitting down and
[46:52] figuring out the dress code and just
[46:53] checking the
[46:55] Box Zechariah 13:
[46:58] 4-6 says and it shall come to pass in
[47:01] that day that the prophet shall be
[47:02] ashamed every one of his vision when he
[47:04] prophesy these are very weighty words
[47:06] neither shall they wear a rough garment
[47:08] to
[47:09] deceive but he shall say I am no Prophet
[47:12] I am a husbandman for man taught me to
[47:14] keep cattle from my youth notice why
[47:17] don't you catch what's happening here
[47:19] that they had dressed in a way at a time
[47:21] there was a dress code for a prophet and
[47:24] you dress a certain way and you did that
[47:26] to signify that you're not a herdsman
[47:28] you're not just a Shepherd you're not
[47:29] just a a dresser of the vineyard you are
[47:31] a prophet you're this humble man of the
[47:33] Wilderness who speaks on God's behalf so
[47:35] there was a dress code for prophets that
[47:37] were given as a sign and here they're
[47:40] admitting that they weren't actually
[47:41] prophets but they were trying to look
[47:43] the part and they come to their position
[47:45] I want you to think very closely about
[47:47] this there's still men today that want
[47:49] to give you the impression that they're
[47:52] prophets and they instead of just being
[47:54] pastors instead of just being husbandmen
[47:56] instead of just staying in their place
[47:57] they want you to think by their
[47:59] appearance that they're prophets and by
[48:02] God's grace there will be those who will
[48:03] recognize the heir their ways and repent
[48:06] and be ashamed of their false prophecies
[48:08] and say I will no longer try to wear the
[48:10] mantle of a prophet I am but a
[48:12] husbandman and I've been taught to keep
[48:14] the Sheep so that's what I'll
[48:18] do in second Kings chapter 1:8 and they
[48:21] answered him about who is it that did
[48:23] this and they said he was a hairy man it
[48:25] was speaking of the Garment he was
[48:27] wearing cuz they wear the garments of
[48:28] the animal with the hair turned out it
[48:30] was a rough garment they wear rough
[48:31] garment to deceive and a girt with a
[48:33] girdle of leather about his loins and he
[48:35] said it is Elijah the tishbite just had
[48:37] to describe the way he dressed it's kind
[48:39] of like we say well who was it that did
[48:41] that it's like what sister was it it's
[48:42] like well she had long hair and we're
[48:43] like yep immediately we know who it was
[48:46] no but this was so particular Elijah
[48:50] dressed in a way to where was like
[48:51] Elijah the tis bite that's who it is
[48:54] Matthew chap 3:4 and same John and the
[48:56] same John had his rment of camel's hair
[48:58] and a leathern girdle about his loins
[49:00] and his meat was Locust and wild honey
[49:03] so Zechariah it's talking about false
[49:05] prophets who imitated true prophets to
[49:08] deceive the people and they were using
[49:10] the way that they would
[49:12] dress they'd put on these rough hairy
[49:14] garments as if they were humble men
[49:17] self-denying
[49:19] men even without thinking about it many
[49:22] people today will try to impersonate
[49:24] brother brandham through a a a forced
[49:27] humility yes that is just a
[49:30] impersonation of the nature that we're
[49:32] familiar with on tape to where they want
[49:34] to talk a certain way dress a certain
[49:36] way act a certain way Force themselves
[49:38] to
[49:39] hunt and do all sorts of things to try
[49:41] to come off as this uh uh this consumate
[49:44] message
[49:45] believer and it's no different than
[49:47] putting on rough and hairy garments to
[49:49] show that we're humble we're hbling
[49:51] ourselves to the message and we're
[49:52] forcing ourselves to do these certain
[49:54] things but it cannot be this kind of
[49:57] forced image of a carnal person it must
[50:02] be God on the inside Amen in Ephesians
[50:05] CH 4:14 and that you put on the new man
[50:09] which after God like God is created in
[50:12] righteousness and true Holiness we are
[50:15] to be putting on the new man that this
[50:18] new man that we put on is like God who
[50:21] now dwells in our souls Colossians 3:10
[50:24] talks about taking off the old man's
[50:26] fashion taking off putting off the old
[50:27] man and putting on the new man that if
[50:30] we have been gener re born again in our
[50:32] souls that we now have this different
[50:34] metric we now have a different dress
[50:36] code we now can by the renewing of our
[50:38] mind be transformed and be conformed to
[50:41] the image of Christ who though he was in
[50:43] the fashion of a man he humbled himself
[50:45] obediently to God's
[50:47] [Music]
[50:48] code there isn't a personation that we
[50:51] can do but that's not what I'm
[50:53] advocating we're to put on the new man
[50:56] yes in Luke 5 vers verse 36 he spake
[50:59] also a parable unto them no man putteth
[51:02] a piece of a new garment upon an old if
[51:05] otherwise then both the new maketh a
[51:08] rent and the peace was taken out of the
[51:10] new agree Earth not with the old I know
[51:13] there's so much Rich principles we can
[51:14] share here but he's just sharing common
[51:16] sense about clothing and apparel you
[51:19] don't cut up a perfectly good new
[51:21] garment to repair an old
[51:23] one now I want you to follow me in this
[51:25] vein that once we are being once we are
[51:28] renewed inwardly by the holy ghost that
[51:31] even the way the lives that we live is
[51:33] not to be
[51:36] Patchwork it it's not a situation where
[51:38] we just want to keep this and get rid of
[51:40] that we want a complete
[51:42] transformation Hall here it doesn't say
[51:45] that what's being presented is that you
[51:47] have a you have a shirt and it's a
[51:49] certain type of shirt and and it's
[51:52] basically saying that if you had
[51:53] something that was broken or torn you
[51:55] use a perfectly good shirt
[51:57] to repair the old one so it's not saying
[51:59] we don't wear shirts anymore but saying
[52:02] wear wear the new
[52:04] one tailor in other words a tailor won't
[52:06] damage something new and whole and
[52:09] complete to repair the old it's not
[52:11] common sense you've got a new garment
[52:14] here why use the new garment to patch up
[52:17] an old one because if you do that both
[52:19] are now
[52:20] damaged in doing so they're misaligned
[52:23] and mismatched a new piece even if it's
[52:25] the same you learned this if you're if
[52:27] you're ever wanting to replace the tile
[52:29] one tile in your house you better go
[52:31] find the right lot on the right day from
[52:34] the right Kil at the very moment all the
[52:36] other ones were done we built a house in
[52:38] Texas and after we' already moved in I'm
[52:41] going this tile doesn't match we had
[52:44] like four different color tile in our
[52:46] bathroom it's like well we're eclectic
[52:48] right we we meant to do this no tile guy
[52:51] just didn't buy
[52:52] enough and he bought others and it's the
[52:55] same brand right same color but it
[52:57] doesn't match so things could be
[52:59] misaligned and mismatched the new piece
[53:01] will not match the color the texture or
[53:03] even the wearin it'll be
[53:06] unappealing just using these practical
[53:08] principles as the foundation of a much
[53:10] deeper spiritual truth I recognize that
[53:13] if I could say this what does it tell us
[53:15] let's not take our old theology that's
[53:17] got a hole in it and just cut out
[53:19] something from the message and patch up
[53:21] the hole in our theology let's just get
[53:23] rid of the whole
[53:24] Theology and people have become very
[53:26] very good false seamstresses and tailor
[53:29] with the message they don't ever want to
[53:30] relinquish their prior ideas they don't
[53:32] ever want to start over with the
[53:33] theology they just keep plugging holes
[53:35] and what is it when you take a step back
[53:37] that's
[53:38] mismatched that's not the Garment of
[53:40] righteousness that's not the word that
[53:43] brother brand hoped to dress the bride
[53:44] in that's your Patchwork of your prior
[53:47] Pentecostalism with a few Badges of the
[53:49] message when he said don't let any smut
[53:52] come on this message he gave you a clean
[53:54] garment and it ought not to be spotted
[53:57] with
[53:58] humanism truth yes
[54:01] sir this applies not just to that
[54:04] spiritual truth but also to our outward
[54:07] appearance I'm saying this forcefully to
[54:09] you tonight this w a Wednesday night
[54:11] crowd that I believe can form this
[54:13] fabric of faith for advancement in these
[54:16] things that if if you if we're on the
[54:18] same page together tonight as a family
[54:20] that the outward appearance matters it's
[54:23] something to deeply consider yes sir
[54:25] then we can begin to more uh uh
[54:27] effectively teach our children and our
[54:30] young ladies and our men how to dress
[54:32] and how to
[54:33] act go listen in terms of a new garment
[54:36] old garment there's a lot there I'm
[54:37] leaving on the table for this but you
[54:38] don't take an old garment with a hole
[54:40] and use a perfectly good garment to
[54:42] patch up the whole you get rid of the
[54:43] old and you put on the
[54:45] new we're re-evaluating we're rethinking
[54:47] these things because God does not want
[54:49] us code
[54:51] switching from one language to
[54:55] another so so we can fit into the
[54:58] world just so that we can somehow signal
[55:01] with a
[55:02] patch I I I really do feel like there's
[55:05] certain things we can see one time
[55:06] sometimes and we've gotten to the place
[55:07] anymore where you can see the way
[55:09] someone's dressed like that's a message
[55:11] believer you say well how do you know
[55:13] because they're just right at the edge a
[55:16] girl in the world's not going to go to
[55:17] Great Links to look like that why
[55:20] contrive so much
[55:23] right they're they're going to say I
[55:25] don't have this isn't fashionable this
[55:27] isn't but there's a way that we can be
[55:29] tempted and I'm saying this very humbly
[55:30] to our young sisters and to all of us
[55:32] there's a way even as brothers there's a
[55:34] way that we want to get just code switch
[55:36] a little bit right with our holy
[55:40] drip I thought about preaching
[55:42] CrossFit he not the workout cult but
[55:46] having a fit for the fit for the cross
[55:48] right and you know anymore we got to the
[55:50] point where we got home in away
[55:52] jerseys hey and you want your city
[55:55] connect so you can be identified with
[55:56] your homies right we cannot be caught in
[56:00] that
[56:02] pattern I'm going to keep pushing on
[56:04] thank you for your patience Zechariah 3:
[56:09] 1-5 Joshua the high priest standing is
[56:11] this great image and symbol of one that
[56:13] would come the high priest he showed me
[56:15] Joshua the high priest standing before
[56:17] the angel of the Lord and Satan standing
[56:18] at his right hand to resist
[56:21] him now notice through this resistance
[56:23] and the Lord said unto Satan the Lord
[56:25] rebuke thee Oh s even the Lord that hath
[56:27] chosen Jerusalem rebuked thee is not
[56:30] this a brand plucked out of the
[56:32] fire now Joshua was clothed with filthy
[56:36] garments and stood before the
[56:39] angel now I want you to catch this image
[56:42] he has these filthy
[56:45] garments what we see just before this is
[56:47] Satan has been resisting him and his
[56:50] garments are filthy God rebukes him and
[56:52] he answered and spake unto those that
[56:54] stood before him saying take away weigh
[56:56] the filthy garments from him this isn't
[56:59] Spot
[57:01] Treatment let's just try some Tide on
[57:03] this he says take away the filthy
[57:05] garments from them and unto him he said
[57:07] behold I've caused thine iniquity to
[57:09] pass from thee and I will clothe thee
[57:11] with change of
[57:14] reignment thank God that in the the
[57:16] things that even sometimes our spiritual
[57:19] our physical dresss is a type of as
[57:21] Divine Healing is a type of a new body
[57:23] and our spiritual dress to be spotless
[57:25] and without blemishes testifying that
[57:26] one day even this spotted flesh is going
[57:28] to be changed into its glorious image
[57:30] I'm glad that he's not going to take
[57:32] this 5' 10 and a half no to take this
[57:35] Frame that I am now that's balding and
[57:37] getting weaker by the day and he's not
[57:39] just going to say you get to live
[57:40] forever I'm going to look like this yeah
[57:43] you're going to live forever you know
[57:45] what a lying vanity it's the mirror I
[57:46] look at right I don't I don't like to
[57:49] see myself that way it's a vanity right
[57:52] and and so there's something in my heart
[57:54] that rejoices that I'm going to get a
[57:57] new
[57:58] body and here the the high priest wasn't
[58:01] just stripped down and they did a wash
[58:03] cycle on his Remnant it was a change of
[58:06] clothing right and I said let them set a
[58:08] fire Fair miter upon his head so they
[58:11] set a fair miter upon his head and
[58:13] clothed him with garments new garments
[58:16] clean and the angel of the Lord stood
[58:19] by this is what God's wanting to do not
[58:21] just
[58:22] spiritually but he's wanting us to take
[58:24] some sort of approach to this
[58:29] naturally I realize that with any
[58:31] principle of God there's a way that we
[58:32] can take it so literal to where in our
[58:35] enthusiasm we just all donate our
[58:37] clothes to Goodwill tomorrow and make
[58:39] them a lot of money and we find those
[58:42] who can sew and we all sew ourselves
[58:45] uniforms right maze in blue
[58:49] uniforms and we all dress the part right
[58:52] or Pure White that maybe that'd be
[58:54] neutral white and we all going to we and
[58:56] we're all going to have a uniform that
[58:58] way we don't have to worry about
[58:59] anything we don't have to try to figure
[59:00] out the mind of God we don't have to
[59:01] figure out what's holy what's not holy
[59:03] we come with some sort of forced
[59:05] structure that we operate within and
[59:07] maybe in a more realistic thing is like
[59:08] well anything I own before I begin to
[59:10] serve the Lord I got to throw out and
[59:11] burn oh maybe that's not the case but
[59:14] maybe it is with our entertainments with
[59:17] the way that we treat one another with
[59:19] the way that we dress the way that we
[59:20] act some of the things that we indulged
[59:21] in God is still doing a work of
[59:23] sanctification amen we constantly
[59:26] stopping and re-evaluating as a family
[59:28] there's things that we didn't allow for
[59:30] a long time then there's things that we
[59:31] allow our children to participate in it
[59:33] could be Sports it could be video games
[59:35] it could be certain entertainments but
[59:36] we always have Liberty as Christians to
[59:38] stop and re-evaluate and say Lord am I
[59:41] still navigating this with Integrity for
[59:43] the best for my family in a way that
[59:45] pleases
[59:47] you and sometimes what we need is not a
[59:49] wash
[59:50] cycle we need new
[59:54] clothes in the spirit spiritual
[59:56] principle also stands for the very
[59:58] literal truth that God cares about the
[1:00:00] way you look and the way you
[1:00:04] dress I won't be able to get to uh
[1:00:07] Daniel chapter 3
[1:00:10] tonight but I do want to finish with my
[1:00:13] text at
[1:00:15] least John chapter 19 we'll just start
[1:00:17] with verse 20 we'll just go to verse
[1:00:21] 23 then the soldiers when they had
[1:00:23] crucified Jesus I read in the beginning
[1:00:25] where they wanted to place this sign
[1:00:27] where it says the king of the Jews in
[1:00:29] every language
[1:00:31] signpost here he is hanging between two
[1:00:34] malactor and they strip him naked so
[1:00:37] there's no way to identify him as
[1:00:39] royalty there's no way anybody would be
[1:00:42] confused that the literal King of the
[1:00:43] Jews is hanging on the cross but guess
[1:00:45] what he was the literal and spiritual
[1:00:47] King of the Jews he had the lineage of
[1:00:50] Jo all the way back to David on both
[1:00:52] sides he had the Royal right he had the
[1:00:54] uh the legal right he was the king of
[1:00:56] the
[1:00:57] Jews and they took his garments they
[1:00:59] wanted to convey that he had been
[1:01:00] stripped of what he had worn they took
[1:01:02] His Garment and made four parts to every
[1:01:05] Soldier apart and also his coat now
[1:01:08] please just focus with me let tell you
[1:01:10] right now so you don't have to look it's
[1:01:11] 8:24 I got started around there and so I
[1:01:14] think we could just hold together for
[1:01:15] just a little bit
[1:01:17] longer they took four parts and gave to
[1:01:20] each Soldier and also his coat now the
[1:01:23] coat was without seam woven from the top
[1:01:30] throughout that's a real
[1:01:33] peculiar I mean you're kind
[1:01:36] of thanks John you know I really
[1:01:39] wondered you know just exactly how the
[1:01:42] his robe was
[1:01:44] made but it means
[1:01:46] something the fact that it's telling us
[1:01:48] that it was a coat without seam woven
[1:01:50] from the top throughout is signaling
[1:01:51] something to us that the Garment that
[1:01:53] Christ wore had some meaning to it that
[1:01:57] even in the way that it would have fit
[1:01:59] him and the way that it was without seam
[1:02:01] from the top throughout signified
[1:02:04] something and it's literal construction
[1:02:06] what it was made out of and how did he
[1:02:08] wore it stood for
[1:02:10] something says in Luke Chapter 8:3
[1:02:13] speaking of these different ones that
[1:02:14] were with them Joanna the wife of chuah
[1:02:16] Herod Stewart and Susanna and many
[1:02:19] others which ministered unto him of
[1:02:21] their substance they would they they
[1:02:24] labored they gave him things they
[1:02:25] provided for him he who had no home or
[1:02:28] Earthly place to lay his head was
[1:02:29] relying upon these ministries of other
[1:02:32] people and perhaps one of these women
[1:02:34] had swed him a a a nice
[1:02:37] coat and it wasn't just anything put
[1:02:40] together and patched together in Exodus
[1:02:43] 28: 32 uh maybe we could go to 34 and
[1:02:46] there shall be a hole in the top of the
[1:02:48] priest's garment his
[1:02:49] robe you read in verses the prior verses
[1:02:52] just how this would have fit upon him in
[1:02:54] the midst thereof it shall have a a
[1:02:55] binding of woven work round about the ho
[1:02:57] of it as if it were the hole of a harbon
[1:03:00] that it be not
[1:03:01] rent this Garment of the high priest
[1:03:03] this gar of priest was not to be torn
[1:03:05] not to be easily torn so they didn't
[1:03:07] piece it together the whole thing needed
[1:03:08] to be
[1:03:09] woven that's why when the high priest
[1:03:12] rent his garments he was so mad at
[1:03:13] Christ he defiled his Priestly garments
[1:03:16] he did something he's so worried about
[1:03:18] the law being observed by Christ that he
[1:03:20] defames and blasphemes the priesthood by
[1:03:23] renting his own garments
[1:03:26] that it be not written beneath upon the
[1:03:27] him Thou shalt make pomegranates of blue
[1:03:29] and of purple and of scarlet roundout
[1:03:31] the hymn thereof and bells of gold
[1:03:32] between them round about and a golden
[1:03:34] Bell and pomegranate and a golden Bell
[1:03:36] on a pomegranate upon the Hemm of the
[1:03:38] robe
[1:03:40] roundabout such intricate
[1:03:42] detail about the high priest notice
[1:03:45] again just how much detail God gave to
[1:03:48] certain things in the temple in the
[1:03:50] house of Lord the way people were to
[1:03:51] dress how that God is expressing
[1:03:54] something spiritual about all these
[1:03:55] things Something That Matters to him so
[1:03:57] he just didn't say uh high priest just
[1:03:59] make sure it's white as white as you can
[1:04:01] get it it doesn't matter cream off-white
[1:04:03] doesn't matter just something along
[1:04:04] those lines just get
[1:04:06] close God's like this isn't Horseshoes
[1:04:08] and Hand Grenades close isn't good right
[1:04:12] right this isn't a cornhole we just want
[1:04:13] to be on the board he's like you got to
[1:04:15] hit the
[1:04:15] mark th this is this is something you
[1:04:18] want need to be precise so he gives very
[1:04:19] precise uh descriptions and Christ now
[1:04:23] is wearing a coat that's in the very IM
[1:04:25] image of that of a high priest without
[1:04:28] seam he is now fulfilling even in what
[1:04:31] he's wearing something that would
[1:04:32] signify and show that he's wearing this
[1:04:35] garment this coat without seam that
[1:04:37] couldn't be easily
[1:04:38] rent and I want you to catch this and
[1:04:41] I'm going to I'm going to say it if I
[1:04:42] could say it this way that Christ was
[1:04:44] wearing this robe which was in the image
[1:04:46] and to the specifications of that which
[1:04:48] the high priest would
[1:04:50] wear and because he wore this robe that
[1:04:54] would reach down to have these hymns God
[1:04:56] could use it in a particular way Mark
[1:04:59] 6:56 and withersoever he entered into
[1:05:01] Villages or cities or or country they
[1:05:04] laid the sick in the streets and
[1:05:05] besought him that they might touch if it
[1:05:07] were but the border of His Garment and
[1:05:10] as many as touched him were made
[1:05:13] whole could you imagine if Jesus was
[1:05:15] wearing wind shorts that
[1:05:17] day I know that's funny to think that
[1:05:20] I'm making a point by it
[1:05:22] though words God gives this requirement
[1:05:25] that a high priest would have this
[1:05:26] garment that would reach down to this
[1:05:29] hymn and because he wore what would been
[1:05:32] this common garment something maybe
[1:05:34] everyone would have a coat but because
[1:05:36] this coat me certain specifications
[1:05:38] because this coat was at the length that
[1:05:40] it was there was people who could Reach
[1:05:42] Out And Touch the Hem of His Garment and
[1:05:44] be made whole and what he was wearing
[1:05:47] became a point of contact the fact that
[1:05:50] they identified even themselves with
[1:05:52] just the Hem of His Garment what he wore
[1:05:55] became a point point of contact in a
[1:05:57] Dynamo the Dynamo that could use Faith
[1:06:00] could it not be the same today that by
[1:06:03] the way that you dress sisters your
[1:06:04] dress can become a point of contact for
[1:06:07] somebody else's
[1:06:08] Faith men dressing in a way that's
[1:06:12] becoming of Godly men men professing
[1:06:14] godliness that it could be a point of
[1:06:18] contact in Matthew 9: 20 and 21 Behold a
[1:06:21] woman which was diseased with an issue
[1:06:23] of blood 12 years came behind him and
[1:06:25] Touch the Hem of His Garment for she
[1:06:27] said within herself if I may but touch
[1:06:29] His Garment I shall be
[1:06:33] whole Brothers you could come to your
[1:06:35] instruments we'll end
[1:06:37] here and in Luke it says and she came
[1:06:39] behind him and touched the border of His
[1:06:41] Garment and immediately her issue of
[1:06:44] blood
[1:06:48] staunched from touching his
[1:06:54] clothing clothing
[1:06:56] that the Bible wants us to know is
[1:06:58] without seam woven from the top
[1:07:01] throughout he was our high priest who
[1:07:03] could be
[1:07:06] touched he wore those in a way to where
[1:07:09] though there was some uh difference in
[1:07:11] humility and there wasn't just this
[1:07:14] outright taking a hold of him but he was
[1:07:16] made he dressed way that was
[1:07:19] accessible for these Meek and these sick
[1:07:21] and these broken to reach out and touch
[1:07:25] and by faith be
[1:07:29] healed and when we're counseled in Leo
[1:07:33] DEA to buy gold tried in the fire that
[1:07:36] we may be rich and to buy from him white
[1:07:40] rment that we may be clothed and that
[1:07:43] the shame of our nakedness not
[1:07:45] appear there's a very literal physical
[1:07:49] application of this in our
[1:07:52] lives I allude to this quite often in
[1:07:54] speaking on these things that we could
[1:07:56] sit down and try to figure this out as a
[1:07:57] church what we're allowed to wear and
[1:07:58] what we're not allowed to
[1:08:00] wear but I believe saying that there is
[1:08:03] a dress code that God has a dress code
[1:08:06] hopefully will remove the stigma that's
[1:08:08] often said well that's just a Clos line
[1:08:10] religion these aren't clothes on a line
[1:08:13] these are clothes on a
[1:08:15] bride this isn't a clothline religion
[1:08:18] this is a this is a word which is a
[1:08:20] which is a language and there's a way
[1:08:22] that we are to dress ourselves in the
[1:08:24] word and we can't F our elves into
[1:08:25] thinking that the very bride who's
[1:08:27] sitting still long enough to be dressed
[1:08:29] in the garments of his righteous
[1:08:31] spiritually has no time to get it right
[1:08:33] in the flesh has no time to dress holy
[1:08:36] has no time to abstain from the things
[1:08:39] of the world listen we don't have the
[1:08:42] time to mess around we better slow down
[1:08:44] and get it right cuz we don't have time
[1:08:47] to make a
[1:08:49] mistake sir to buy from him reignment
[1:08:55] that we might be
[1:08:58] clothed and if God could
[1:09:01] [Music]
[1:09:02] take brother Paul what's a brother is it
[1:09:05] brother George from greater Vision the
[1:09:06] one that writes all the those songs he
[1:09:09] wrote If God could take just this
[1:09:10] uncommon
[1:09:13] garment if he could take if God could
[1:09:15] just use a
[1:09:17] coat a literal
[1:09:19] coat is God wanting to use us
[1:09:23] literally is God want to use the way we
[1:09:27] dress the way that we act and I'm being
[1:09:28] very specific a dress code sit down as
[1:09:32] fathers of your family sit down as
[1:09:33] husband and wife sit down as Mom sit
[1:09:35] down as individuals and whatever and say
[1:09:36] Lord I want to dress according to your
[1:09:39] word I want to I want to through the
[1:09:41] what I actually wear I want it to be a
[1:09:43] language that speaks Holiness and the
[1:09:45] world may not understand it but maybe
[1:09:46] there's somebody that says wait a minute
[1:09:48] wait a minute wait a
[1:09:49] minute what there there's a language
[1:09:52] being conveyed here that's right that's
[1:09:53] right and maybe they'll hear it in their
[1:09:55] own language maybe God will speak to
[1:09:57] them it might be tongues to a lot of
[1:09:59] people but God maybe the way God's
[1:10:01] wanting us to dress is for a great
[1:10:03] purpose like it was with
[1:10:06] Christ the Bible says that we ought to
[1:10:08] pull people out of the fire hating even
[1:10:11] the Garment spotted by the
[1:10:14] flesh the Garment hating even the
[1:10:17] Garment spotted by the
[1:10:19] flesh God help
[1:10:22] us to even desire that our garments and
[1:10:24] what we wear would please the Lord let's
[1:10:27] stand to our feet this evening I want to
[1:10:30] thank you for your
[1:10:32] patience so patient to hear these things
[1:10:35] left left a lot out but we'll get to it
[1:10:37] another time and it will be timely them
[1:10:40] then and thank you I know that there's a
[1:10:43] lot of force behind what I'm saying I'm
[1:10:44] very very under great conviction that
[1:10:47] these things are necessary for us to uh
[1:10:50] reaffirm I know this isn't anything new
[1:10:52] for us but just to reaffirm that
[1:10:54] Holiness counts it matters amen and that
[1:10:57] when we come to a Sunday morning service
[1:10:59] and all the seats are full that we begin
[1:11:01] to deal with things there's going to be
[1:11:02] people that need to hear truth sometimes
[1:11:04] for the first
[1:11:07] time sometimes it's for the first time
[1:11:09] they're hearing it well they've heard
[1:11:10] that preach now they're finally hearing
[1:11:12] it for the first time if we could bow
[1:11:15] our heads in a word of prayer our
[1:11:17] gracious Heavenly Father lord it's a
[1:11:19] great privilege to be gathered into your
[1:11:21] presence once again this evening and
[1:11:23] Lord I do count it a privilege to
[1:11:24] minister to such wonderful
[1:11:27] people with this appetite for the word
[1:11:31] and Lord
[1:11:33] I I I know that maybe all of us were
[1:11:36] hoping to hear somebody else preach
[1:11:38] tonight and but I trust that through
[1:11:41] everything they heard from the same God
[1:11:44] that could use any other
[1:11:46] vessel and that what was shared is
[1:11:48] pertinent it could be made clear to them
[1:11:51] that they could understand just just how
[1:11:54] your heart is for
[1:11:56] them that these requirements that the
[1:11:58] world might look at as merely forced
[1:12:00] modesty and a dress code of of man but
[1:12:05] that the the origin of this language the
[1:12:07] origin of these signs the origin of this
[1:12:10] is a deep work that you're doing within
[1:12:11] our
[1:12:13] souls and that this is experience that
[1:12:15] is so elusive that we can't quite
[1:12:18] explain that we can't
[1:12:20] describe cuz somehow be made flesh in
[1:12:22] the way that we live
[1:12:25] and that there could be a swapping out
[1:12:27] of
[1:12:28] dress swapping out of
[1:12:31] habits to be more like you that though
[1:12:35] we are found and fashion as a man we can
[1:12:38] display a humility and obedience to
[1:12:41] you and the whole world isn't going to
[1:12:44] see it but Lord there's those that need
[1:12:46] to hear these voices of lived lives
[1:12:49] thundering out by conduct and dress
[1:12:54] code and I'm praying for the people
[1:12:56] tonight this Wednesday night crowd the
[1:12:58] ones that are built to handle this kind
[1:13:00] of teaching and I pray that they'll be
