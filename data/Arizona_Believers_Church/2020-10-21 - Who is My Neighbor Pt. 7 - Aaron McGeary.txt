TRANSCRIPT
========================================
ephesians chapter four read from verse 17 to verse 32. we'll read it here at the outset and perchance that we might not have time to get through um some of these particulars that paul is mentioning here but ephesians chapter 4 verses 17 to 32 this i say therefore and testify in the lord that ye henceforth walk not as other gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind having the understanding darkened being alienated from the life of god through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart who being past feeling have given themselves over into lasciviousness to work all uncleanness with greediness now he gives the contrast but ye have not so learned christ so it's their mindset their mentality that causes them to live and to act the way that they have it's what they've been taught it's what they've been nurtured in but now he shifts the picture but we have we haven't learned that way you have not so learned christ if so be that you have heard him and have been taught by him as the truth is in jesus that you put off concerning the former conversation the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lust and be renewed in the spirit of your mind and that you put on the new man which after god has created in righteousness and true holiness wherefore putting away line speak every man truth with his neighbor for we are members one of another be angry and sin not let not the sun go down upon your wrath that may comfort some that we can be angry but it says be angry and sin not we can be provoked to anger but we need to know how to process that process it bring it subject to the fruits of the spirit be angry and sin not let not the sun go down on your wrath neither give place to the devil let him that stole steel no more but rather let him labor working with his hands the thing which is good that he may have to give to him that needeth let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may minister grace into the hearers and grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby you are sealed into the day of redemption let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice and be a kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as god for christ's sake hath forgiven you you may be seated we've are we've been ministering on the uh the subject of the of who is my neighbor and in looking at that we're examining the parable of the good samaritan it's how we most often would think about it in luke chapter 10 and the the question is asked by the lawyer who comes to jesus and what can i do to inherit eternal life and it prompts jesus to ask him well what is what do you read in the law and he reads that to love the lord thy god with all your heart soul and mind and to love your neighbor as yourself and jesus says that's good you've said well do that and you'll be well but then this convicted the lawyer and the lawyer says well then who is my neighbor and so it's in response to that question of who is my neighbor that jesus gives the parable of the good samaritan and we've been looking at these different actors and these different characters that are in this parable and so i'm just going to jump right into the middle of it knowing that we're all very familiar uh with this with this parable but we've been looking at it this way that jesus is challenging the lawyer to actually put himself in the shoes of the thieves of the priest of the levite and even the good samaritan maybe we could even say put yourself in the shoes of the one who's befallen on his way from jerusalem down to jericho but he's wanting to use these characters in a way to challenge this lawyer in his thinking how he narrowed his view of what a neighbor was how he narrowed his obligation to humanity and there's a lot of different ways that this parable is approached some look at it as an allegory of man being in sin others look at it very strictly as jesus correcting his attitude towards others and that it just speaks to being a good human being and being a humanitarian to everyone and not being driven by prejudice or bigotry but as we were looking at it last time we were looking how that whether we looked at the thieves uh the priest or the lord or the levite each were part of a social structure that behaved according to a certain expected norms there was a normative behavior a way that you acted and so we were looking at how they were part of a culture and being part of a culture there were certain things that were expected of them there were certain attitudes that they demonstrated because the group it kind of characterized the group and we were examining how all of them acted under the influence of a group dynamic they all they acted according to the culture whether they were in the group of thieves and so the group kind of caused them to do a certain thing or they were part of the group and even though absent from the group as a priest and a levite they still were susceptible to the culture of the group and we were pointing out that we're susceptible to those same kind of dynamics today that if we're not careful we behave under a group attitude or we act with the crowd and we looked at proverbs chapter 19 verse 21 now it says there are many devices in a man's heart nevertheless the counsel of the lord that shall stand and we were looking at these devices that we all have on our hearts and i'm not talking about the device in your pocket or your purse or the device you left in the car or the device that you got grounded from earlier this week we're talking about the device that's actually in our thinking a device that's in our heart it means in invention or perception or thoughts it's actually calculations and instincts that we all have within our hearts so every man every woman every boy every girl has a device many devices in their hearts and he contrasts it with the counsel of the lord so the council lord that sure that's firm but there's many devices in a man's heart and you can't trust them you can't just give yourself over to your perceptions your thoughts and and the way the instincts and how you feel because we looked at how these devices in our hearts actually allow us to make judgments very quickly these calculations that we have in our hearts actually allow us to make decisions uh efficiently but there's a problem that comes with them because we can have what is called a cognitive bias and that's an error in your thinking you if you see this you run if you see that you hide if you see this that's good to eat whatever you have these certain processes and things you go through your mind but these things that help you make quick decisions sometimes can mislead us and so we were looking at these different errors in our thought process and how these these devices put us into groups because we want to belong we want to have a sense of belonging because we want to uh we don't want to be the oddball we want to we want to fit in with the crowd we're looking at all those different things and because because of these devices it allows the group to influence us these thoughts in our hearts these calculations these perceptions these devices allow uh motivate us and inspire us and move us and cause us to think and cause us to act and we are specifically looking at the power of the crowd the sway of the group and how we desire to conform and it's just in the nature of man we would rather mimic the group than appear to be odd or different we'd rather just kind of go along with what everyone else is doing instead of being the one who says it says otherwise and so it's easy to act then because of the group and we looked at that as the as jesus saying uh the thieves it was a group of thieves that preyed upon this man going down from jerusalem to jericho so that's this may be very very easy and very convenient for me uh wanting to minister on that subject of how the group thinks and how we act as a church and the kind of culture that we established in the beginning of something but it was a band of thieves it was a group of robbers that fell upon this man and robbed him and beat him beat him and took his clothing and took his goods but then it's also the same thing about the priest and the levites the scripture says that the priests have acted as a company of robbers and the very old testament was characterizing the priest as having that same kind of mindset so we looked at romans chapter 12 verse 2 and it says be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god so paul says be not conformed to this world it implies a pressure that means there's a weight there's a heaviness there's a force in the world that would want you to conform to a particular image so as christians we are to never be conformed we don't even want to be conformed to the image of a christian we don't want to just be conformed to the image of a church member we don't want to be conformed to somebody who's simple and someone who's sweet but if we're going to be in the an image we want to be transformed so it says be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind so paul is causing these two uh processes and i want to say compete but he wants to contrast them that be not conformed to this world in its judgment in its spirit in its attitude in its behavior but be transformed by the renewing of your mind so don't think like the world don't act like the world don't do what the world does by conforming to the world but rather be transformed by the renewing of your mind and we're and so what we're kind of just saying a few things here at the outset to review these many devices that we have on our hearts the world pressures us through those channels and because we have these instincts and because we have these shortcuts and because we have this learned behavior and this nature and even nurture in our minds the world can pressure us to sway our thinking and if it can sway our thoughts it sways our acting and that we were just looking at many different examples of that last time and i felt empty afterwards because we did labor a lot on just these different biases or these heuristics as we call them i i say we i'm kind of lumping myself in with the behavioral economics uh professors but um there's a word that there's a it's identifying these weaknesses and these biases and these behaviors we even looked at that robbers cave experiment where you just took 22 11 year old boys separated them into two different groups gave them names and without any prompting they immediately hated everybody else in the other group and it was simply the function of ide identity group identity and we're against them and we oppose them and we're just looking at kind of maybe the academics of it i felt a little bit empty because it was really just setting it up to show that we're all susceptible to that and how do we get out of it you really can't humanly we used an example a couple weeks ago that even when you tell somebody that you have this bias and it's very very difficult to overcome and a lot of people don't see it and they're not quick to recognize it and that's so with everybody and then you ask the person do you have it like oh no no i'm not like that at all because even being conscious of it you can't necessarily overcome it we looked at the conformity bias bandwagoning group think echo chambers the in-group bias these many different things that just relate to our natural lives and our natural way of thinking and where we use it to show that how we could all begin to act as a group and even acting as a group come off pretty good but that's not what god wants god wants individuals to have a personal experience with the word and then by that join us together in a family because we all have our own individual experiences and not create such a vibrant social a social community where we can just substitute a new birth experience you can't do that you can be very successful with group dynamics but that's not what church is all about it's not about just creating a vibrant group and so if we have all these tendencies a desire to conform or there's echo chamber and group think and in group biases how do we guard against these tendencies how is it that we can overcome these mechanisms it's right there in romans chapter 12 verse 2 be transformed amen be literally means be changed into another form and though one day we know our bodies are going to be changed right now our spirits are being changed and being molded into the right kind of character and so we want to be transformed changed into another form by having our mind the renewing of our minds that means the complete changing the renewing of our minds that's how we're going to overcome these devices in our hearts you're not going to be able to do it by human think if there's a problem with your thinking your thinking isn't going to fix your problematic thinking right just that's why we will say this often that the the scientific discipline that has uncovered these things within the human thought process and with respect to social behavior and all these weaknesses and the psychology the same discipline that diagnoses the sickness is not qualified to heal it only god is qualified to heal it and in the message god's power to transform brother brennan makes this statement and i'm wanting to emphasize what power is the scripture says be transformed by the renewing of your mind there has to be a factor that influences that and he says it's he sent his transforming power god sent his transforming power to bring you out of this deformity of religion that you're in in this deformity of chaos that we're in god has sent his transforming power his word vindicated proven to bring you out of this religious deformity of ignorance that you're walking in naked blind miserable and don't know it so the condition of laodicea is oh we're rich we're increased with goods we have need of nothing but yet is un does not know that they're poor miserable blind wretched naked that they're oblivious to it they are in fact poor they are in fact miserable and blind and naked but yet they're in their thinking they're rich they're increased with goods they have need of nothing well what's going to get somebody out of that condition the word of god that's why in revelations 3 it says come it speaks and says buy of me you take this ice savage and clothe yourself wash yourself repent because that's the only way that you could come out is if the word would draw you out in a minute being responsive to the word experience the transforming power of god so it's this transforming power that brings you out of chaos it's this transforming power that brings you out of mere religion because we realize that even if you go back to the beginning when adam and the woman fell and they clothed themselves and fig leaves it represented a religion just to cover themselves and religion is just a covering we don't just want religion we want a genuine experience with the word and a relationship with christ where i know i've been baptized into his body i know i'm communic communion with him and then the dynamics of a local fellowship and the preacher nurtures that experience i'm not just merely walking away from one idea to join another idea that's just religion and it takes god's transforming power to bring us out of the deformity of chaos of sin the deformity of religion into fellowship with him that's right the bible says in hebrews chapter 4 verse 12 for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even the to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and moral and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart so the word of god is quick powerful sharper than any two-edged sword and that's what that's the transforming power transforming power of god is quick you think your thought processes are quick you think your your computation power is really really good i i don't know how many gigs of ram you think you might have or what your process is running at and uh i mean the human mind is really is incredible when you think about it because your mind is acting as a computer and computers exist because of human minds they just don't they're not just burped out of a volcano i mean it's people that program these things and think about these processes and put these things together because it's a it's a function of the human mind this human mind is amazing but the word of god is quicker the word of god is more powerful it is sharper than a two-edged sword and it says it can actually divide among soul spirit and the body that's what the word of god can do and in doing so i i you read this we could take other scriptures into this the word of god can minister to the body it ministers to the spirit it ministers to the soul it's quick it's powerful it can divide even among these parts of the human and this is the part i want to focus on it's a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart we have unconscious bias we have unconscious thought processes we have things that influences us and we don't even know why to the point to where there's some scientists that believe that you actually do are not a free moral agent that everything you prefer in life you can bring it back to some event or circumstance that influenced that way you that way and i thought so i really don't like doc or like dr pepper i really don't somebody else did or it was given to me and that's just the reason why i like it because i was five years old at a restaurant in san diego and and i had which it could have been san diego back then you couldn't get dr pepper in the west uh back then but just something happened in your life and now you like something and you think you chose it but it's just some other influence and so the word of god is actually a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart the very things that were unconscious to the word of god can enlighten us to them the word of god is a discerner of her own thoughts we can we place this scripture sometimes in the dynamics of the word independently discerning someone else's thoughts and so you maybe uh two different ways like the preaching of the word discerns your thoughts and preaching the word discerns your circumstances or a gifted discernment that could uncover something in your life you say well that would have to be the word but the word works within yourself the the word of god within yourself by the spirit of god is a discerner of your thoughts and the intents of your heart so that you can judge your own behavior you can judge your thought process so when we say well we have these biases we have these weaknesses we have these tendencies in our flesh how can we overcome these mechanisms we need the word to examine our instincts we need the word to examine our judgments we need the word to inspect our devices is that knee-jerk reaction completion to the holy spirit is that ideas that bias is that judgment is that prejudice is that pleasing to the lord and that's your only protection we i listen and i don't mean this is any disrespect at all but we can't we cannot just kind of go with the flow of the awakening of social justice and being awoke church and we're all aware of all the injustices and we're all aware of how people are sensitive you don't want to offend anyone that kind of awareness eventually just leads to hypocrisy within itself because you've got to have an absolute you've got to have some basis to judge things by and this is our only hope this is our only protection is the word of god not culture not science not society and it's the only way you can guard against getting caught up in and some of the polarization that takes place and and so i i want to say this just kind of set up our next step the thieves the priest and the levite i was pondering this this week they all represent a specific temptation for the lawyer that then in some way the lawyer ought to be able to identify with the challenge that each one faced whether it be the thieves whether it be the priest or whether it be the levite he was being challenged with very specific roles or attitudes or behavior or temptations that he realized i wrestle with these things i fight these things he's being challenged in the end well which one do you think was neighbor to the one who fell among thieves and he answered correctly but you notice in answering this is really interesting to think about this he didn't say the samaritan he had to say oh well the one that the one that showed mercy almost as if the bias was still so strong in his heart he couldn't say the samaritan he had to say well it's the one that showed mercy boy is the word not a discerner does the word not know how just to get right into someone's face and challenge him to where this lawyer was so had he still wrestled with overcoming the bigotry overcoming the prejudice overcoming the idea that the samaritan's not my neighbor i don't have to be kind to him i don't have to be good to where he couldn't even say the samaritan he had to say the one that showed mercy so these in the scenario that we're reading in this parable each player is significant each fact is important as jesus frames it and i believe this lawyer was being uh shown at a very specific example of a temptation that he faced and our minds it's a mass of complex cognitive circuitry it just if we want to think about wires and circuits and nodes and all sorts of hardware and and software whatever it's just a mass of this complex circuitry in our heads that's been programmed over thousands of years and you say well brother aaron i'm only i'm only 50 years old no i'm talking about humanity has been programmed for over for thousands of years it's been under the weight and the influence of the world the mind the human mind is the product of the nature and nurture of fallen humanity and a world that's under the influence of satan and so there's ways that we behave now ways that we act now that the remnants of our ancestors of hundreds of years ago that this is the way that they lived this is the way that they acted they had to be quick to recognize certain kind of threats and they had to uh they had to respond to certain things and they had to endure certain things and you say well is this this is some kind of evolution well it is some kind of evolution we are the product of hundreds of years of development of our bodies and our psychology and and our thinking as humans and i wanted to emphasize this that's the product of a fallen nature in the nurture of a fallen world in ephesians chapter 2 verses 2 and 3 paul paul expresses those things in these terms he's talking about those that have been quickened but now he says in ephesians chapter 2 verses 2 and 3 wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world so there was a chorus that you walked in before you were quickened and that course was determined by the world in in times past before you were born again before you were quickened by the baptism of the holy ghost you walked according to the course the way the flow the influence of the world according to the prince of the power of the air so there was an unseen power the prince of the power of the air this the hidden springs that were shown even in the book of daniel where we see demonic forces that rule governments that opposed michael and these and these things that take place in hidden realms the prince of the power of the air is moving the course of this world he says the spirit that now worketh and the children of disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and we're by nature the children of wrath even as others so by virtue of your first birth which all of us here tonight we can guarantee you had a first birth and so we we all be in here we have a way that we should look at this and identify with it by virtue of our human experience being born of a woman we have in our flesh and in our mind lust and desires instincts and wants and particular needs ways that we are influenced and paul is just telling us what we already know he's just using very uh a very thoughtful thought-provoking language to say that when we were born we all had our lives and times past fulfilling the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of our flesh following the the course of our mind what we wanted and by virtue of our first birth we were by nature we had in ourselves the same kind of lust the same kind of desires as someone who would forever be lost the children of rap people who are ordained ordained to wrath don't think that when you were born the first time that there was something in your first nature that made you different than those who who cannot receive christ or those who cannot serve christ it has nothing to do with your first birth so we are by nature by our first birth subject to lust in the flesh and because we have this in our nature then the nurture of the world can just move us where it wants us to go that's why marketing is successful that's why i feel fairly confident that some of you this week already even though it's wednesday succumbed to some sort of advertising and bought the product or signed up for the service you're like wow is it really that good is it really that amazing sign me up it's because they know how to market things they know how to share things they know how to spend things they know how to get you craving something because it's just the way that the world works and so it says the course of this world the prince of the power of the air the spirit that works within the people for praying on the lust of your flesh the desires of the flesh and of the mind because of your nature now it says this in first john chapter 2 verses 16 and 17. first john chapter 2 verses 16 and 17. now notice how succinctly he play defy just uh summarizes this for all that is in the world he's telling us love not the world nor the things of the world because if you love the world the love of the father is not in you for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world so we can summarize everything that is in the world that paul is even talking about the course of this world the course of this world the force of this world the pressure of this world the conformity of this world is lust of the flesh left of the eyes pride of life if you're going to be tempted it's going to fall into one of these categories if you're going to be swayed or moved to sin or to doubt god or have a weakness in your flesh it's going to be some element working upon the lust of the flesh to the lust of the eyes and the pride of life it is the these three lust and this pride that the woman was tempted with in the garden of eden it is these very same uh lust the lust of the eye the lust of the flesh and the prayer life the very same things that temp tempted christ in the wilderness it's the very same things that tempt all of us on a daily basis because we are by nature subject to the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life doesn't even have to be evil oh i'm craving to do drugs and oh i'm lusting after this it doesn't even have to be that it's just the normal appetites that we have that the world and that uses to cause us to conform to motivate us to push us to protest to make us do things that we otherwise wouldn't normally do and do things that are displeasing to god and it says all that in the world is the lust of the flesh lust of the eyes and the pride of life and those things are not of the father but of the world so he says in verse 17 and the world passeth away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of god abideth forever there's your answer if all that is in the world is the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh and the pride of life you say well then what do i do if all that is in the world are these three things how in the world am i going to live beyond those get behind them live above them not be subject to them how am i going to do it we'll do the will of god but that's like the let's they escape all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes the pride of life how am i gonna do it how many do it the bible says he will with the temptation paul said no man is tempted above that which he is able but god will with the temptation hath with the temptation made a way of escape that you're able to bear it so there's there's no pride of life there's no lust of the flesh or lust of the eyes that god has not somewhere tangential to it somewhere in the temptation somewhere in the lust somewhere in the pride god has not set a door before you that you can walk through in obedience to him and escape these tendencies all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life stand opposed to the will of god you cannot fulfill the will of god and the lust of the flesh at the same time you cannot fulfill the will of god and be operated according to the pride of life at the same time now in the church age book when brother branham writes the church age book in chapter 9 he's looking at how to him that overcometh will i grant and these different scriptures he says now what are we to overcome and he says that is the normal question to ask here but that is not the actual thought of this verse for it is not so much what we are to overcome but how we are to overcome now if i could uh is maybe even say this as a as a way of subjecting myself uh opening the door for criticism last wednesday was probably a lot of what we were to overcome the the cognitive biases and weaknesses and tendencies that all exist within the human mind and all related to the power of the group the power of the crowd and that would be what we're to overcome but now it's being distilled down to this it's not so much what but how he says now this is logical for does it matter it for does it matter much what we're to overcome as long as we know how we can overcome if we know how to overcome in every situation it's not necessarily that you know what i just need to know how if i know how to in every situation i don't need to know what i'm going to face i just need to know how i'm going to overcome it when i face it a quick look at the scriptures which involve the lord jesus overcoming will bring out the truth of this proposition in matthew 4 wherein jesus is tempted of the devil he overcame the personal temptations of satan by the word and the word only that's what he used even when the word was quoted back to him he used the word back and you realize that there's a way that he approached him to pray on the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh and the pride of life oh does that the scripture say this about you to maybe force him into into doing something to where the angels would bear him up prove to me that you're the son of god and and and the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh and the pride life all in a way look at these kingdoms i can give them all to trying to prey on these things and what did he use to combat it not logic he didn't rationalize he used the word the word and the word only and each of the three major trials that corresponded exactly and each of the three major trials that corresponded exactly to the temptation of the garden of eden the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life jesus overcame by the word he fell to the personal temptation of satan by failing to use the word adam fell in direct disobedience to the word but jesus overcame by the word that's how he overcame and we'll we won't have the time to get into it tonight but maybe i'll just lay a little bit of a seed in there when brother branham preaches how can i overcome you overcome by the word and humility and so he said he overcame by the word he says and right now this is instructive to us i'm not the woman in the garden i'm not jesus in the wilderness but right now and right now let me say that this is the only way to be an overcomer also it is the only way that you can know if you are overcoming because that word can't fail what a what a better metric to come up with to measure ourselves by the world has all its all its balance sheets and all its signatures and everything that it looks for to determine whether or not you're successful and you can identify success merely by the fact that you're overcoming that's what makes a successful christian not your balance sheet not what kind of model car you're driving not how fancy things look or how blessed you may be in the natural but am i overcoming am i am i growing in the lord is there a trajectory where the spirit of god has lifted me higher in into greater realms of fellowship and deeper in the word of god we can we are successful when we're overcoming and he says the only way you can know if you're overcoming is by the word not if your neighbor tells you wow i've just noticed you really know how to cut your grass and i really noticed that everything's just perfect you must be a perfectionist nothing is out of order my goodness your garage is absolutely amazing i'm astounded by how neat and clean everything is i'm amazed at how much money you make and i've never even seen a car that nice before those are just all things that speak of someone being disciplined and taking good pride in their things which we all should but success real success real christian character is measured by overcoming the only way that you can be an overcomer is by the word and it's the only way you can know if you're overcoming is by the word my that's uh that's instructive so let's apply this example to the parable of the good samaritan that you can over only overcome by the word and you can only know if you're overcoming by the word so you use the word to overcome and it's the word that lets you know whether or not you are overcoming and i want to i want to think of it in an obvious way um and you might you might cringe a little bit because it's going to seem super obvious but if you think about the thieves they they rob a man and they nearly kill him so and i guess i shouldn't i shouldn't uh suggest that you'll cringe because i'm not making this up in exodus chapter 20 verses 13 and 15 it says thou shalt not kill thou shalt not steal now wouldn't you think those two might just be assumed i mean we're a group of people we know how to act we know how to behave we know how to treat one another but no they needed to be told that you shall thou shalt not kill thou shalt not steal and ponder that for a moment that even though you think this is decent people and we we function within a society where everyone should be able to respect one another and we should be able to be governed without certain moralities and certain rules or certain legislation but here man had to be told that this is a commandment you're not to skill and you're not to steal and this is this is something that might seem to be obvious these are things that might seem to be obvious but the word directly addresses these things within our hearts in order to i want to say binders but in order to con to constrain bad behavior there had to be a commandment that came from god it says thou shalt not kill so that there would be an authority that a person could yield themselves to in a moment of anger and a moment of jealousy and a moment of rationalizing while they did this i ought to do this back they had to constrain themselves and they could be governed by a commandment by a law that says don't do it and these thieves had a law that they should have subjected themselves to this is thou shalt not kill thou shalt not steal so if you're in a band of thieves and you're all thieves and you're wanting to go rob somebody someone should say well you know what the bible says we're not to steal and we're like huh what are you doing you're ruining our fun you know you wait time but it says we shouldn't steal that should have been what controlled their behavior even though we could think well man wouldn't a decent person just think not to do it well perhaps but it shows the word addresses the issue identifies the weakness but there's a word there to to constrain us to keep us in line in harmony with the right thing exodus chapter 23 this is maybe even more to the point of what we were speaking on last time exodus chapter 23 verse 2 thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil there it is right there in your bible there's a tendency for man to get caught up in the mob and do something they shouldn't do so there's a word there that says don't follow the crowd to do something wrong why you won't be justified just because everyone else is doing it you cannot just say well thousands of others were doing it everybody else cheats on their taxes everybody else does this everybody else does it there's no excuse the bible says do not follow a multitude of a crowd a throng of people to do evil it's written in the word why because human nature is just to kind of follow the crowd it says don't do it this is a word that we have that can become a part of our our database as it were that uh motivates us that enlightens us that instinct that's there whenever some the crowd is rising up something's happened a group's going one way there's something that rises up in your heart as a discernment says wait a minute the word of the lord says don't follow a multitude to do evil and your discernment kicks in and you stop and say hey whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa wait a minute i don't want to partake in that then it says neither shalt thou speak in a cause to decline after many to rest judgment now that's a uh i could keep reading that to you and it won't get any clearer neither shalt thou speak in a cause to decline after many to rest judgment in other words don't change your conviction or your testimony just because the crowd is i've read it in a number of different places and translations to try to understand what it means don't change your conviction don't give a testimony in order to side with the majority because it says after many when many are perverting justice don't speak in a way to join your voice with theirs when they're speaking perversely just because everyone else is declaring something just because everyone else is espousing something just because everyone else is saying something don't add your voice to theirs if it's injustice don't add your voice to theirs if it's unrighteousness again it's showing that there's a tendency for some that if they see the crowd doing something they want to join with the crowd they want to say what everyone else is saying they don't want to be the one that's not saying something in the society we live in now it's a it's a bully of a society if you don't say something they want to bully you and bully and bully you till you do say something and the bible says don't if it's an injustice if it's not right if it's a perversion of righteousness do not add your voice to it why does the bible even speak like that because it's human nature to do it and what i'm wanting you to understand is that if there's any weakness of the flesh if there's any tendency whether it be group dynamics or just human behavior or own individual behavior there is a word there is a counsel of the lord there is a power a transforming power in the word of god to change our thinking from natural thinking worldly thinking to thinking like christ and the priest and the levite jesus is clearly suggesting by this parable that the commandment to love thy neighbor as yourself obligated the priest and the levite to render aid to the man who fell among thieves he's directly i i maybe i use i use the word suggesting but he's directly connecting love thy neighbor as thyself as enjoining and obligating the priest and the levite to reach out and render aid that's the very thrust of what jesus is saying he said well there's a man who went down from jerusalem to jericho and he fell among thieves well the thieves are thieves they're going to act like thieves so now you have a man that's beaten and robbed he's half dead laying on the side of the road and a priest walked by jesus is saying very directly the priest ought to have stopped because the bible says love thy neighbor as thyself jesus is clearly saying that the levite ought to have stopped because the bible says love thy neighbor as thyself in other words leviticus 19 verse 18 thou shalt not avenge nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people but thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself i am the lord and there's other places we've read already that address this love thy neighbor as thyself that would have been a commandment to the jew a commandment to the priest a commandment to the levite those of the the house of aaron that they would have looked upon someone even if they weren't a jew they would have been obligated to help them and so jesus is using them as an example to show that you had a responsibility in the word what should have caused the priest not to pass by on to the side but to go and to help this one the word should have caused him to do it the levite and then by using the levite it puts it into a different category whereas you could say well the priest he had to actually touch the sacrifices he was more functional in ceremony he would have had to give greater caution to approaching someone who was dead but the levite um he he would be more inclined to have greater liberty but listen jesus is actually exposing an air in the human heart to where they he he's identified this way this commandment to love thy neighbor as thyself ought to been given priority over all these other ordinances and this is where i i could even think of how they were legalists well i'm a priest i'm not supposed to touch any dead thing right and uses that as an excuse to not obey another part of the word or rationalize with it well you know he looks dead and i'm i can't touch something that's dead and and just the rationalizing that would have gone just think i was thinking of it this way last week just the mental gymnastics the mental wrestling all the devices in the heart of the levite and the priest that they're going through as they're walking down this road and they see a man beat up and maybe like oh i should probably help him no i probably shouldn't you know well he looks dead anyways and i kind of doesn't look like a jew and just everything he had to go through instead of just having a nature that's subject to the word of god and then acts according to the word of god even have a discerning spirit that says you know what this this your desire to move past this to not reach out to not do the right thing you're rationalizing a way to uh to remove yourself from the spiritual obligation you rationalize it with conviction in order to get yourself from off the hot seat because something is convicting you to do the right thing so you start thinking about all these scriptures and all these statements and all these quotes as a way to rationalize why you shouldn't do it we've all done that the lord's put in your heart to do something it might even be just to humble yourself to somebody who did you wrong but maybe you didn't respond just right but they did wrong first and the lord's really working on you just to humble yourself and say you're sorry you're like but you know what i didn't start that i'm not the one that started and you know what what i did wasn't even half as bad as what they did and if i say i'm sorry then they're not going to realize that they were wrong and you know what this is righteous indignation and they need to know that they're wrong because if they don't know that they're wrong they're going to stay wrong and if they stay wrong they can't get right and then they can't get saved so if i apologize i'm going to send them no you've just went to this whole paradigm like this trying to figure out a way to not just do what the holy spirit was convicting you to do let's just say hey you know what i'm sorry i shouldn't have done that so the scripture says in numbers chapter 19 verse 11 it says this about the priest he that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days so the priest now i know immediately we start thinking well see uh-huh he had a good reason because we won't identify with the priest right righteous pious offering worship one of the special people that get to go in and offer the sacrifice but i want you to notice something here there's no prohibition on touching a dead body it's just there was a consequence and not even a real bad one but they just had to quarantine for seven days right that's what they had to do hey if you've touched some of a dead body then you're unclean for seven days and they had to go through a process of cleansing it didn't invalidate temple worship didn't keep them from ultimately offering sacrifices it was just you know what if you touch a dead body then you're out of service for seven days you have to step back and ceremonially wash yourself and cleanse yourself and praise yourself as a priest so it's not that to touch a dead body is an abomination to the lord or that it was prohibited to priests it was just that if you had to touch someone who was who was dead then you there was a process that you went through for seven days to to remedy that and it speaks to a lot of other things a lot of other types but i'm pointing this out because the priest could have used that as an excuse as to why he didn't help well if i if i helped him then i i then i wouldn't be able to offer sacrifice i'd have been unclean for seven days and he realized just the thought process the rationalizing what would it been an inconvenience to you would it would have been too much to say i'll i'll gladly go through the process of sanctifying myself for seven days if that's what it takes to make sure that this man is not half dead and could be revived because all it would have meant is for seven days you're going to have to purge yourself you're going to be in clean for seven days he wouldn't be forfeiting the ministry he wouldn't be forfeiting his position as a priest but it was to him an inconvenience it's to him he used numbers 19 he that touches a dead body he used it as actually an excuse to keep himself for fulfilling leviticus 19 love thy neighbor as thyself and when you start doing that you've perverted the word because you can't take one prescription or obligation or something in the word of god that you're required to do and make it compete with another requirement in the word and then wade them and say well i'll do this but not that because if i do this then i won't be able to do that notice what it says in exodus chapter 23 verses 4 and 5. i'm sharing this just to to show the weakness of the rationalizing that the priests would have been going through because it says if thou meet thine enemy's ox or his ass going astray thou shalt surely bring it back to him again if your enemy's donkey gets loose you're to bring his donkey back if thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden and would has forbeared to help him thou shalt surely help with him are you picking up what this scripture is laying down if the one who hates you if his donkey is laden with his burden has fallen you are obligated to help the man who hates you to help his donkey up the one who is your enemy if his donkey gets loose you were to bring it back to him in other words there is no reason to justify bad behavior because someone is your enemy or because they hate you well there goes his donkey gonna lose that one hey why am your donkey no it says take them and bring them back is it you wouldn't want it you don't take the donkey and push it in a ditch or hide it or steal it or whatever you do donkey jack or whatever you do back then you you'd help them out to the man that hates you to the one that is your enemy and if you were to do that to your enemies donkey how much more were you to do that to a man who's laying in the road naked beaten in half dead the bible would actually ask you to care for the livestock of your enemy care for the livestock of a man who hates you how much more would it ask you to render aid to that man if he was laying on the side of the road beaten and broken and half dead you couldn't say oh well you know i offer worship and i offer sacrifices and if i touch that i won't be able to do it for seven days but you've got it all wrong you've built this legalism and self-justification it's the rationale that the the lawyer used when he said well who is my neighbor notice how jesus addresses this head-on in matthew chapter 23 verse 23 woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you pay tithe of mint and anise and cumin so you're going to tie on on the fractions of spice you're going to tie it to where well here's the mint and i need the 10 they're gonna get so particular and so legalistic on the tithing of these things and have omitted the weightier matters of the law judgment mercy and faith he's calling him out you're really super strict in some areas how did he say we may have read it already before you can swallow a camel but you choke on a net yeah there's things that you're so you get so bogged down on strain on you strain on a gnat and you swallow camel you're so specific about tithing on the men and the anus and the cumin but you leave out the bigger things the more weightier things of judgment mercy and faith you're all worried about whether you're going to be able to offer a sacrifice i'm speaking to the priest now i think the levite comes under this umbrella as well but you're so worried about numbers 19 that you forsake leviticus leviticus 19. exodus 23 you're so worried about one spot and one thing and you're so particular oh make sure you don't touch the sepulcher make sure you don't touch this make sure you don't wash the pots and do all those and you're so careful about all this other stuff but then the things that really matter the weightier matters this is you you forsake judgment and mercy you laid in obligations on people and you watch them wrestle and fight and try to figure out their way out from underneath all your bondage and your legalism and you don't even lift one finger to help them out and he says this these all you have to have done and to not leave the other undone isn't that beautiful surely that they would have just been all up and arms what do you mean you're not going to make they got a tithe on their mint they need to be precise with their tithe jesus does not walk away from that he says you ought to have done the tithing and the mercy judgment and faith yes you you should do the other part but you also should do the other don't do the one and leave the other undone what good has it done you in the end it says in second corinthians chapter 3 verse 6 he says who also hath made us christ god hath made us able ministers of the new testament let's make ourselves all included in that we're able ministers of the new testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life all right maybe just to shock some of you who haven't figured it out yet or don't know yet i'm a lawyer it's what i do during the day it's what pays the bills i practice law to make a living but i preach to make a leaving and we're all getting we're all going to leave together so the uh the the practical law pays the bills the word is going to make me escape them all one day and and so in the in the practical law this particular area that i practice is in securities it's actually written in one of the major areas that i that i focus on and the and the preamble to it an introduction to the rule it basically says look technical compliance with the following doesn't matter if whatever you're doing is a scheme to avoid registration or to avoid breaking the rule in other words the spirit of the rule has to be honored not just the letter of it if you do everything in order to meet the requirements as a scheme to avoid the consequences of not meeting the requirements you haven't really met the requirements because the spirit of the law matters and that's exactly what jesus is saying he's saying paul is saying look we've been made ministers of the new testament but not just the letter of it did you do this did you just do this and just the legalistic the black and white of it but the spirit of it because the letter kills but the spirit giveth life legalism kills legislation kills revelation gives life revelation liberates you you would desire for someone to do by revelation not by education we don't educate people anything it's education legislation and legalism that creates uh horrible group dynamics where everyone's just doing it because when we read last time i'd better go to church or i'll be considered a backslider horrible horrible dynamics do you want people to willingly give willingly participate willingly uh act and it has to be done by revelation he says the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life you realize if we make this application to jesus christ those that knew the letter the best are the ones that put them to death and they crucified them by the letter they they said he was guilty according to the letter but they missed the spirit of the letter that said this is the one who brings you life search the scripture they are the ones that testify of me so the pharisee or the priest and the levite although technically in compliance violated the spirit of the law the spirit of the word i use these things to express to you that the word is our answer yes as we read already from the church age book page 360 now paragraph five it says in his own personal life speaking of jesus contending with himself that's not the bible teach us that as a son learned he obedies by the things which he suffered we recognize this process that the son went through he learned obedience by the things which he suffered in his own personal life this is a very you know try to lift this sentence up this is a heavy sentence in his own personal life he had a personal life contending with himself he said content with himself what do you think was happening in the garden of gethsemane he says let this cup pass from me that he expresses his will his desire agonizing with it he says nevertheless thy will be done there was a wrestling that he engaged in in his life there was there was things that he that things that he wrestled with and content and with contending with himself and his own personal life he overcame by obedience to the word how is it then we can overcome in our own personal lives contending with ourselves continuing with our own worst enemy we do it by obedience to the word of god turn with me to back to our text in ephesians chapter 4 verses 17 to 32 i just want to read it again just as we did in the beginning because notice how paul now is instructing us this is giving us very simple tools that we can use that combat the weaknesses of our flesh that oppose these tendencies the devices these mechanics in our minds that cause us to do things incorrectly this i say therefore and testify in the lord that ye henceforth walk not as other gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind so we ought not to be walking as gentiles walk who only have their human mind their human um the nature they received by parents the nurture they received within their society they walk in the vanity of their mind it says having the understanding darkened being alienated from the life of god through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart who being past feeling have given themselves over to lasciviousness to work all uncleanness with greediness this this has fallen humanity their understanding is dark and darkened because they're alienated from the life of god their ignorance is alien their hearts are blinded they're past feeling they don't have discernment they don't have sensitivity to the spirit and because they have this and they've given themselves over to live unrighteously to follow the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life he said this is how you live when you're carnal this is how you live when you follow your base instincts he's saying don't live that way don't walk that way this prejudice you have in your heart these these ideas you have of others the this parent this view that you have this very narrow view you have of church and relationships he said get rid of all the vanity get rid of all the pride get rid of all the strife he says because you have not so learned christ verse 20. he says you have learned him differently if you've heard him and have been taught him as the truth isn't jesus taught what learned what verse 22 that you put off concerning the former conversation the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lust you know what your job is put off the old man be careful how you say it they think you may be talking bad about your dad but your job all of us our job is put off the old man i'm taking off the old man every day lord i want to put him off every day i want to push him away every day put off the old man the former conversation the former life which was corrupt according to the deceitfulness the lust that laid within your members the mindset the attitudes the tendencies and be renewed in the spirit of your mind transforming power quickening power renewing my thought process renewing my thinking my attitude my perceptions my judgments my discernments and that you put on the new man that's our that's our instructions every day put off the old man put on the new man if you want to put on a new body then keep putting off the old man now if you want this body to be changed in a moment and twinkle of an eye then we have a goal we have an objective put on the new character of christ put on the new man which after god is created in righteousness and true wholeness wherefore this is putting away the old man put away lying speak every man truth with his neighbor that's putting on the new man showing us put away the old man put on the new man speak every man truth with his neighbor if we are members one of another be angry and sin not put away the old man put on the new man let not the sun go down upon your wrath neither give place to the devil it's when we hold on to our anger not just being angry but when we hold on to it and we let it fester it gives the devil place to begin to work within that anger to cause division and hardship let him that stole still no more there you are for the thieves but rather let him labor working with his hands the thing which is good that he may have to give to him that needeth putting off the old man put it on the new man let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth put off the old man but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may minister grace unto the hears put on the new man and grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby you are sealed unto the day of redemption these instructions are not to a group of people that signed up for a seminar on how to better traverse the social climate this is these are not instructions to people who just wanted to know how to be better social justice warriors or know how to get along with their enemies or you know this is an mlm by the time that paul was done everyone was standing on their seat saying fake it till you make it fake it till you make it that's not what it was all about this was to the the born again why because they're the only ones that could take the old man and put them off and take the new man and put them on everybody else would just be putting makeup on a pig right it's all they'd be doing prettying up the old man putting on a wolf in sheep's uh sheep's clothing this would have been something just to put on something fake he says grieve not the holy spirit of god wherever you're sealed into the day of redemption your soul is sealed but you can still grieve the holy spirit so we we don't want to grieve him he says let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice this is putting away the old man and be kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as god for christ's sake hath forgiven you putting on the new man you want to know how to overcome these devices in our hearts ephesians 4 put away the old man put away his thinking ask god to make you more sensitive to these reflexes and instincts that we have on our heart where something happens and immediately just be honest with yourselves for a moment how how often it creeps in when all of a sudden and i try to think of maybe a benign scenario to where nobody's like oh well that was really rude but where something you're planning something you're wanting to do something and then all of a sudden you find out that somebody said something or something happened and your instinct is well i'm just going to disinvite them they're not they're not welcome to come over and what is it the old man you immediately you immediately begin to think how can i take control over this situation again how can i manipulate it how can i maneuver it how can i uh put them to shame how can i navigate this situation where my my pride isn't offended where i can reassert my dominance and immediately you're thinking like the old man and what you need to realize is wait a minute that's old stinking thinking no that's that's the way that's the way i used to think no uh-uh i don't think that way anymore i'm putting on the new man i'm gonna think differently lord give me wisdom how to traverse this situation with this person because i don't know the right thing to do lord in the times past what i would have done is i would have stiff-armed him i would have given him the cold shoulder i would have alienated him i would have withdrawn myself i would have ostracized him i would have ignored him lord show me show me how to navigate this give me wisdom i want to put off the old man i want to put on the new man sister elizabeth if you'd come i'd like to end with this statement it's a prayer brother branham prays at the end of god's power to transform actions it's a towards the very end there he says god he's praying god transform us today by your power by the renewing of our mind to turn from the meager elements of this world now and to the word of god if you could just realize whatever whatever you have in the world that is not subject to god is meager regardless of how big the talent is or how wonderful the skill if it's not subject to the word it's meager what's the song we sing little as much if god is in it it's the it's the little if god's in it that's greater than all the big meager things that we have in our lives turn from the meagre elements of this world under the word of god that's how we're transformed and may we be renewed by the transforming power of god upon the seed that's in our hearts that we believe unto creatures called sons and daughters of god this is my prayer to you father for the people in jesus name he says amen this this is our prayer this is your prayer this is my prayer yes this is your prayer this is your heart's cry this is why you hunger this is why you thirst this is why you're not satisfied with just play in church this is why you're not satisfied with religion you want to be transformed you know there's more and the the more is the seed of god inside if he hasn't been born again by the baptism of the holy ghost it's always going to be crying out to be quickened crying out for expression the seed cries out for expression and that's the desire to see a seed surrendered to god through the baptism almost be quick and delight and then we're transformed into the image of sons and daughters of god turning away from the meagre elements of this world to the word of god i want to be renewed by the transforming power that should desire lord could keep renewing my mind keep renewing my mind lord keep renewing my mind that's our only hope that's our only defense that's the only way to overcome let's stand to our feet say lord renew my mind let me make that your prayer lord renew my mind it's the only way that we can break the conforming power of this world is when our minds are renewed because that's what transforms us say lord just take this vessel take this clay with our heads bowed and say lord renew renew my mind the head's bowed we want to pray for anyone that would desire prayer and you could just lift your hand to the lord and your knee and say lord help me help me tonight lord our gracious heavenly father lord people standing on their feet [Music] heads bowed hearts lifted to heaven hands raised with a heart cry that says transform me oh god i'm tired of religion i'm tired of playing church i'm tired of the the same old same old lord i pray that you would meet them where they are right now father lord it might even be that we're so long been trapped into this attitude in this mindset that we're like that bird that was chained to a post that walked the same circle for so long that once the cord was broke he didn't know he was free may there be a soul that hears the cry today that they're free they're free and they can go free from the circle treading upon the same thing time and time again may they go free lord i pray tonight for those that are here the those that would be streaming lord there's just a tremendous sense of need right now father and i pray that we would look to you and to you alone and take this into our bosom that obedience to the word of god is the answer that where you have spoken we must say amen where you have asked us to step we must step what you have called us to do we must do and we cannot rationalize we cannot make excuses we cannot self-justify let us act now lord according to your word to do that which you have told us to do stand up upon a promise that if we're in your will you will keep us so father i pray for the hands that were raised the hearts behind it the need that's represented by it that you'd help them strengthen them encourage them and take this service lord as we've ministered from the word take it and edify your people and may you be glorified we ask it in the name of the lord jesus christ amen bless the lord
