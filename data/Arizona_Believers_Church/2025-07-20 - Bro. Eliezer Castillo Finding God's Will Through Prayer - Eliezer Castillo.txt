TRANSCRIPT
========================================
And this is um of course the scene where Jesus goes to the garden of Gethsemane. He knows what's going to take place. Um of course his disciples, I'm sure they're very nervous and they know what that there's some kind of impending doom going going on. And um brother Brandham says that this was the greatest decision that Jesus had to make. And it says, "And he went a little further and fell on his face and prayed, saying, Oh my father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me. Nevertheless, not as I will, but thou wilt." You may be seated. What a um beautiful surrender that Jesus gave to to God. Um there there's a there's a lot of quotes that brother Bham speaks on this and and he gives a good illustration and paints a picture of of what was going on and not only just physically that or the things that we have read but he said that spiritually there was things going on around him here in in communion in in 1957. He says that Jesus was confronting the greatest test that he ever had. Gethsemane laid before him and where at once all uh final and all sufficient test must come when the burdens of the entire world laid upon his blessed shoulder. There was no one in heaven in all of heavens or in earth could ever uh stood it but him. So I I I honestly believe that there's things that we go through that no one can ever stand but us. There's decisions that we have to make in our lives that only we can make that decision. &gt;&gt; So God laid this burden on him. No one could ever stand it but him. And to know all of the sins of past sins and present sins and future sins rested upon this decision. So he had a decision to make. First of all, you want you have to understand that God gave him the free will to make a decision. God didn't arrest him to the burden of the cross. God didn't make him do it. He had the same exact decision that we make today. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It was one of the most uh greatest victories that Christ ever won or proved his messiahship. And when he said to God, "Not my will, thine be done." That was the greatest victory he had ever won. all demons of torment uh was around him to tempt him and to try him. So here he says that every single demon and devil was there because this was the opening. This was the time where where a sh a shift was going to happen &gt;&gt; and and every single devil was there to triumph. But in another uh scripture or another quote, brother Benham says in conferences where he says even Michael and Gabriel were there sitting there while he was there on that rock. Every angel stood and every single thing was just looking at him waiting to see what decision he was going to make. &gt;&gt; Now whenever he made his decision didn't say okay I'm going to go or but what he did was Lord not my will. That was the greatest thing that Jesus could ever do. &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't say, "You know what? I'm going to make my own decision. I'm going to take my free will and do what I can." But he said, "Lord, not my will." &gt;&gt; And honestly, Jesus didn't have to pray. &gt;&gt; He didn't. He just could have just went to it. But he went and brother Brandham says it was a conference between the dove and the lamb. and he went and he began to to commune with God and say, "I'm having an issue here. I'm having an issue with my flesh, but Lord, whether my flesh wants to go or whether it doesn't, it's not my will. I submit it to you. &gt;&gt; I that's the greatest thing that a Christian can do is is finding the will of God." &gt;&gt; Amen. in prayer that that everywhere we go, we are in prayer. Lord, not my will but yours. &gt;&gt; Because the greatest gift or one of the greatest gifts that God ever gave to man and and woman was free will. That's that's the thing that has made contentions throughout the whole world all through time &gt;&gt; because we see evil here and evil there and things going on and and we want to point to blame but God gave us the ball. God gave us the authority to say Lord what am I going to do? &gt;&gt; And so he gave us that authority to make whatever life we want to do. Whatever life you want, it's up to you. &gt;&gt; Whether you want to be a Christian or you don't want to be a Christian, that's up to you. &gt;&gt; Whe you know, of course, young young people whenever they have to go to church, they're dragged to church. Yes. But one day you're going to make that decision. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But when you realize that there is a reality that there is a God that is is waiting on your decision, you submit it to God and then he takes over the rest. Amen. &gt;&gt; Um I I think that's the greatest thing and and you know I um found a lot of inspiration on the last time I spoke. I spoke on from the heart to the home and and speaking on uh I I drew from this uh scripture in John 17:20 where Jesus was praying his prayer and and he says that I pray for thee not these alone but for them also which believe on me that and then he begins to expound how he want them and them in him and and him in God and and he wanted something that that is a heartfelt religion. He wanted something from the heart. He wanted a communion with the people and not just, you know, we could go to church the all of our lives, but if there is not a a I and you and you and me, there is no connection with God. &gt;&gt; There there has to be a spiritual connection with God. And so I I was thinking about that how how everything flowed out of God, you know, everything that was created, everything that was good, it came out of his heart. And it's it's a great example of how we are known by our own fruits. So everything that we live, everything that we do, whether it's home life or where whether we're we're at school or work, we are projecting what's already in our heart. &gt;&gt; We are creating atmospheres and we are doing those things whatever is in our heart right now. Yes. &gt;&gt; And and I I I think as a Christian, what needs to happen is this communion with God. This communion. And a lot of times when we think about prayer, we think about it as a duty. And you know what? Let's pray for our food and let's pray to when we wake up and we go to sleep and and it becomes this monotonous duty. But it is a constant communication with God. I think um if you start thinking about Jesus's life now this is a very simple um topic but I I think is a very needful one even for my life but um even going into Jesus's life see that that the first time he appears on the scene he's praying before getting baptized while he's getting baptized the last time he leaves the scene on the cross of course physically as a a mortal he's praying to the Father, uh, Aba, Father, why have you forsaken me? So, so he's he's crying out to the Lord every step of the way. Even even to uh in every single uh great event, he prayed when he went to the Mount Transfiguration. He prayed before whenever the uh he began to feed the 5,000 people. He prayed whenever he walked on the water. He went out to the mountain and he prayed first. So there is this pattern of Jesus Christ always praying, always in constant prayer. In Luke 11:1, um here the disciples ask him a question. It says, "And it came to pass that as he was praying in a certain place and when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray." And John also taught his disciples. So they asked him this question. And if you would like to turn with me to Matthew uh 6:es 5-13 here, they both uh are in correlation with one another. But here in Matthew, um, we see the background of why these people wanted to ask Jesus, "Lord, how how do we pray? Teach me how to pray." You know, I I just had a a buddy at at at work ask like, "Well, what do I do? How do I pray?" And it reminded me of Brother Brandon whenever he had to write on a piece of paper because he didn't know how to talk to God. I think what he told me was he started looking at YouTube channels to see how to pray. But it's just like talking to a friend. &gt;&gt; It it it's when you begin to understand that there is an ear listening to your prayer, &gt;&gt; watching you, waiting for you to say something to him, then it begins to be real easy to begin to commune with the Lord. &gt;&gt; So Matthew 6 5-13 it says, "And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrite are." hypocrites are. For they love to pray standing in synagogues and in corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily, I say unto you, they have their reward. But when thou uh but thou when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou has shut the door, pray to thy father which is in secret. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And thy father which seen thee in secret shall reward thee openly. Amen. &gt;&gt; But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions as the heathen do, for they think that they shall be heard um for their much speaking. Be uh be not therefore like unto them, for your father knoweth what things ye have need of before ye ask them. &gt;&gt; So this is not a thing where God's like, well, if there's no communication, how do I know? No, God already knows. But God has a formula. &gt;&gt; God God has agents on earth. &gt;&gt; God works through agents and that's us. &gt;&gt; He needs men on the ground, women on the ground. &gt;&gt; So it says and and then verse n he says after this manner therefore you pray. Now um I've heard this many times. I don't know if brother Brandham said it but he said but I I like how he says he didn't say pray this prayer pray like this. &gt;&gt; So you know that's how Catholicism they want to pray prayers and chant prayers but Jesus is saying pray like this not pray this prayer. &gt;&gt; He's saying pray therefore um or after this manner therefore pray ye. Our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen. I think that's one of the greatest things that Jesus ever taught us was how to commune with God himself. Now, to think that that Jesus is the greatest human being to touch the earth, that everything everything he did was a miracle, &gt;&gt; that that he walked on water, he raised the dead, he he spoke life, and he spoke death. &gt;&gt; He he was he was the greatest person. And and I don't know if you know a natural person that would be walking around with him as they were following him, they could ask the Lord, "How do you do that? Teach us how to do that. &gt;&gt; Teach us how to be like you. Teach us how to walk on water. Teach us how to how to uh cast out devils. Maybe somebody could have done it." And and it kind of reminds me of when Brother Brandham came on the scene, many people began to ask him the wrong question. They didn't ask him, "L how do we you become consecrated with the Lord? How do you get this connection? Teach us how to do that." No. Just like Tommy Osborne and all these people. Brother Brandham once said that he was running around the car all nervous and says, "Do you think I've got a gift of healing?" &gt;&gt; What? He saw Brother Brandham face that maniac in front of him. He was there and he saw whenever he just spoke the word in love and and how the devil crumbled. &gt;&gt; And and and when people saw that, they wanted that same thing. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, he says that that um he says, "Look, Tommy, after this revival starting like this, there'll be so many divine healers in the land." I said, "It'll be pitiful. It'll be so um the people won't even won't even have a meeting unless they've got divine healing. &gt;&gt; What do they do? They they begin to major on a minor. &gt;&gt; They begin to see all the miracles and that's what they wanted to copy. That's what they wanted. The disciples, they they were wise. They asked Jesus the important question. Lord, teach us how to pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm sure they've asked him a lot. They there was a lot of questions about a lot of things but explicitly they asked him Lord teach us how to pray. They they saw him. They saw him pray. In the Bible, the the Bible says in two scriptures where it says that in the morning before everybody was would wake up in the dawn, Jesus would schedule a time to go out and pray. Before the morning even started, before people were going up, Jesus was there praying. Many times you see in the Bible where he went in a solitary place. He went out in the wilderness. He went by himself and he prayed. &gt;&gt; When the sun came up, he would tell his disciples, "Let's go down to town. Let's go downtown." Now, after his prayer, see, he wouldn't go and do his thing. He after his prayer, then he was ready. &gt;&gt; He said, "Let's go downtown." And there, that's when miracles would happen. That's when he would speak and things would happen. The blind would see and and and everything would happen. Why? because he was a man connected to God. &gt;&gt; And I'm sure the disciples, they they understood something from that. I I once heard a preacher say that that when you spend hours with God in prayer, you'll spend seconds with men. When you say spend hours in prayer with God, then that issue that we have, it should not be a big issue. But a lot of times we're screaming and yelling at at at this issue to go away, but we never have a connection with our Lord and Savior. &gt;&gt; There there has to be a connection with God. There has to be a Lord, what's your will? &gt;&gt; What's your will in my life? And a lot of times, I think the one of the biggest problems today is people don't want to let go of their own will. It's it's a I I've got it. I've got it all under control kind of world today. Everybody wants the control. Everybody wants a control of their lives. And whenever the hardest thing to do is to surrender to the Lord &gt;&gt; or in in general to surrender to anybody, &gt;&gt; a lot of times it's built on pride. a man, you know, a man's got it. A man, you know, I'm the man of the house. I I've got this. And and we begin to create this thing where it's like, no, nobody needs to help me. And it sometimes is hard just to ask for help. &gt;&gt; And now we see it in in the other way where where women want the control in in the nation and all of these things. Everybody wants control. &gt;&gt; They not only want to control their lives, but they want to control others. and to be a sheep, to be meek, to lose the control. Man, you don't want that. That's not the American way. That's not that's not how we're we're built and taught. Jesus says, "Not my will." &gt;&gt; Jesus go. &gt;&gt; Jesus let go of all of his thoughts, all of his ideas. Maybe he had really good ideas. Maybe he had really good thoughts, but he had to let them go &gt;&gt; in order for God's will to take place. &gt;&gt; That's where we have to be. &gt;&gt; Lord, let it be your will. &gt;&gt; And the only way God's will can work in our lives is when we get down in prayer and we begin to commune with the Lord. Not to get ahead of my message, but but that's where God's sovereignty lies, &gt;&gt; people um unbelievers in the world. That's a big problem for people. How somebody can say, "Man, God's will was in my life." You know, you know, us Americans when we say, "God was with us and he blessed us." And yet people in Syria and Africa, they're they're starving. They're dying. People Christians are are getting killed. and and a person can sit there and say, "How can God bless you here, but he can't touch those people over there?" And and and many believe or unbelievers, they have quarrel against those things. &gt;&gt; Well, how can God's sovereignty be on of one person and not the other? I think a lot God's sovereignty lies in the prayers of saints. Amen. &gt;&gt; God's sovereignty lies with his children because God, he licensed licensed us to be his hands and feet. &gt;&gt; God, he can't move until we speak. God, he can't do something in your life until you begin to cry out to him. &gt;&gt; And when we begin to cry out, we'll see the move of God in our lives. whether people might see it on another uh perspective and say, "Man, that doesn't look good." But you can say, "All things work for good &gt;&gt; cuz I love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Cuz I've been called." But what is it? It's that connection. Jesus, he gave that definition of being prayed up. You know, every time he encountered something, every time he went through something, he was prayed up. He prayed in a in in a solitary place. He prayed in the morning. He prayed. And whenever he was encountered by those things, he was ready. &gt;&gt; A lot of times when we're encountered by those things, we're we're praying right then and there. &gt;&gt; We're trying to catch up on our &gt;&gt; prayer that we forgot last week. &gt;&gt; But remember, prayer is our lifeline. &gt;&gt; It's not a duty. It's not a ritual. It's not something that we're supposed to do amongst men and all of those things. It's a connection, a lifeline between us and God. &gt;&gt; It's a communion. Communication is key in any relationship. &gt;&gt; How much more God &gt;&gt; whenever we go and we pray and we get to know who this God is, &gt;&gt; how good he is, how how something can change from from death unto life. I'm sure many of us, we can testify how how death was in a body and prayer changed the situation. &gt;&gt; How somebody was was destined for hell and prayer changed the situation. &gt;&gt; It's not us. It's God saying, "All right, you made the connection. &gt;&gt; You've you've made it through your faith. &gt;&gt; This is a learned activity. This is not something that comes whenever we become Christians &gt;&gt; and saying, "Oh yeah, you know what? This is part of the package." No, this is a learned activity. &gt;&gt; Just like I said, brother Brandham, he had to write to the Lord first and he realized, "Okay, this is not working." And it got to the point where he got so desperate where he said, "Lord, I need you so much there in that old shack." He began to cry out to the Lord until he saw him physically and he received what he needed. I think um it's more than just uh just small talk. I I think it's a consecration. &gt;&gt; I think that's the key to to uh fruitful life as a Christian is a consecrated life. I I honestly I I can say I need more of that. Because because the thing is it's so easy to live in this flesh. &gt;&gt; It's so easy to get caught up in work. It's so easy to just get busy with everything &gt;&gt; and forget that the reality is a connection with the unseen God. &gt;&gt; That that's where that's the reason why you're blessed in the first place. &gt;&gt; That's the reason why uh God has has kept you in the first place because there has been a connection. Sometimes we just forget. Brother Bandham, he says in in the message perseverance, he says you must find the will. You must first find the will of God before you can do um you can do the will of God. You must first know what his will in the matter. Then don't turn turn it loose. As the lady said today, she was trying to get beyond the sound barrier. Then the plane just um picks up speed and goes on un unlimited when it passes the sound barrier. Well, when you when you pray until you pass the doubt barrier, &gt;&gt; then you're running free. &gt;&gt; You go you go on and then you're there's nothing that can bother you then &gt;&gt; because you're running free past unbelief. It's done. It's been settled. It's all over. And when you get the insurance in your heart, that's it. Um, it's going to be that way. You're just as happy as it if it had already happened. There's there's this finding the will of God, finding what he wants in our lives. Lord, what do you want? Sometimes we want, there's so many things we want, we need, but Lord, what do you want in my life? Every big decision that we have, put it to the Lord and see &gt;&gt; see the Lord do something. &gt;&gt; And sometimes it doesn't look like the right decision. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it looks like he's leading you right to a ledge, but just keep going. &gt;&gt; If you trust in the Lord, you'll see him provide a way every single time. You know, one of my favorite stories, and it kind of reminds me of of uh my life, me and my wife's life, of when brother Brandham, he uh went hunting with his wife, and he went out there and and his conception was, I'm the best hunter in the world. I'm a great hunter. I've been doing this since I was a child. I know how to do all of this. and and and whenever he he um found himself lost, he be to run those things in his mind. Those conceptions that used to work, you know, we have conceptions of who we are and they they work when everything's running fine. &gt;&gt; But whenever things begin to get shaky, we begin to realize, man, I'm not who I thought I was. &gt;&gt; I'm not as strong. I I don't have control. I I don't have what what I thought I had. That's what brother Brandon began to think. &gt;&gt; He said, "You know what? When he realized, he had to realize that it wasn't in his his hands anymore. And when he realized that, then he got down to his feet and he prayed and he said, "Lord, I'm lost. Lord, I'm lost. I'm not a great hunter. I'm not what I thought I was." &gt;&gt; And whenever after he prayed, he didn't go up and still think those things. He didn't go up and and and begin to try to reason with himself. He just got up. He said, "Everything is going to be in his hands now." And he looked at one way and he said, "Okay, I'm going to go that way." &gt;&gt; That's the best thing to do. You don't know where you're going to go. You don't know what what's going to happen. But you you after the prayer, after giving your your will and seeking his will, then you've got to go &gt;&gt; and say, "Lord, now I'm going to go this way." &gt;&gt; And he began to walk that way. And then a hand touched him on his shoulder and he turned and then he saw an opening there. &gt;&gt; What was it? It's when you seek God, you take your own will out, begin to walk because you know it's in his hands. Now he's got to do something. He's got to touch you on the shoulder. &gt;&gt; If he's got to show you through a whirlwind, if he's got to show you through a dream, or if he's got to show you in your heart, &gt;&gt; you begin to walk and God will guide you. &gt;&gt; What you're seeking his will. &gt;&gt; You're not the greatest hunter in the world anymore. You're not the big bad man. You're not the smart woman. You're not this. You're just a child of God that is seeking his will. Amen. &gt;&gt; Saying, "Lord, it is your will." &gt;&gt; That's what God wants from us. &gt;&gt; In Genesis 1:26, he says, "Let us make man in our image." Now, he's talking to himself. He says, "In our likeness, and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the fowl of the air, over the cattle, over the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth." I've heard a brother say that every source of every the source of every creation is its sustainer. So the wa the fish needs the water the the beasts need the the the dirt because that's how they came out of the the dirt. The beast came. &gt;&gt; But when God created man, he said, "Let us make man in our image." &gt;&gt; Ma man came out of God. &gt;&gt; So our sole sustainer and provider is God. Whenever we need something, whenever there's a need, whenever there's a lack, it's God that we're asking for. &gt;&gt; Without God's uh extension, man cannot uh have dominion over this earth. He can can't exercise it without the power and the influence of God. Um, it reminds me of Matthew 6:10 where it says, "Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven." There there has to be God's perfect will. And you have to say, Lord, your perfect will that has already been laid out in the heavens that has already been there before the foundation of the earth. Let it be in me. that phrase it what it's doing it's linking those two requests of thy kingdom come thy will be done on on earth as it is in heaven &gt;&gt; your kingdom your will let it be done how it is up there how it is in you let it be done in me &gt;&gt; and what happens it it begins to to harmonize earth begins to harmonize with heaven Why? Because you begin to walk in his will. &gt;&gt; You begin to reflect what's in the heavenlies. &gt;&gt; You begin to to uh portray his image because man was created in the image of God. And of course, it's not a physical image. It was his character. &gt;&gt; It is his will. It is his word. And when we say, Lord, let thy kingdom come. Let thy will. Let your word work in me. Then this earth, this this piece of dirt begins to reflect God himself. So we need God to be a Christian, to be the best Christian. &gt;&gt; How can we be a Christian without a connection with God, &gt;&gt; without a reflection of God? &gt;&gt; That's that's where we see the churches today. That's where we see religion today where there's this image being portrayed of Christianity without the connection of the father. So it begins to be just this this fake this copyright as brother Aaron says this this this thing that is has been copied and it's not being portrayed the way it should be. &gt;&gt; And I truly believe it's because that connection has been lost. There has to be that connection. So, Matthew 6:10, it's it's a call for God's reign to shape our world as a fully uh as as it is fully in heaven. And and what it does, it reflects both a hope of the millennial reign and a present desire for God's manifestation in our lives. &gt;&gt; So, it's com combining the longing, the submission, and the action of God's kingdom. So God God he has he has subjects today. God's kingdom is here today and that's through you. That's what I like about when you read the gospels, you know, we we've been so uh people have been so groomed to think that that Christianity is a religion &gt;&gt; that it's churches and it's all these things and it's it's all all this churchianity. But when Jesus came, &gt;&gt; the desire of the people were a change in the kingdom. &gt;&gt; They they were being they were under the rule of the Roman Empire. &gt;&gt; And they needed a change in the kingdom. They need they didn't need a church. They didn't need any of that. They needed a king &gt;&gt; to change the kingdom. And whenever Jesus came, of course, he wasn't in the image or the the likeness of what they wanted it because they thought he was going to come down. He was going to overthrow their kingdom and and and the rule of the the Israelites was going to be there. &gt;&gt; But he said, "My kingdom is in here." &gt;&gt; That's where the kingdom is. &gt;&gt; So when my kingdom come, it starts from the heart. And there's people like brother Brandham says are little messiahs. Yes. &gt;&gt; Walking around projecting his kingdom that is coming and is and is here already. &gt;&gt; There'll be a f fulfillment and a fullness of his kingdom. But right now we are establishing his kingdom. Now &gt;&gt; that's what church is. If you look at that word church whenever he says uh uh my church shall be built upon this revelation that's what he means. this establishment or this kingdom. &gt;&gt; That's what Jesus wanted. So when when a person he doesn't communicate with God when when he begins to be separated, what happens is we begin to be governed by dirt. We begin to be governed by our our flesh &gt;&gt; once that connection is done &gt;&gt; because we are made by a sustainer which is God. So, so we need that to survive. &gt;&gt; You take water from a fish, he ain't going to survive. &gt;&gt; You take those things from from those animals, they ain't going to survive. You take God from a man and he will wither and perish. He could be the greatest man in the land, but there that the soul that sinnth shall surely die. &gt;&gt; There has to be a connection with God or then we begin to be governed by this dirt. &gt;&gt; Which is um one of the things that the devil wants us to do. &gt;&gt; We're not supposed to make our own way, our own decisions concerning good and evil. &gt;&gt; We shouldn't be describing or making a definition of what's good and what's evil. &gt;&gt; That's not up to us. We're our sole duty is to say, "Lord, what is your will?" I honestly believe that's what Lucifer did. That's what Eve did. She She wanted to take a bite from the tree of the of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. &gt;&gt; She wanted the knowledge of what good and evil is. &gt;&gt; And then people now they want to weigh out what's good and what's evil in their own lives. And now you you see society and and maybe way back when uh George Washington was there. Maybe they there's things that they did that they thought was good. And many things were probably more good than it is now. But there was still slavery there. &gt;&gt; There was still evil there. But they weighed out what was good and what wasn't. Now you see people changing their genders, their identities, their whatever they wanted to. And they're saying they're calling this good. &gt;&gt; What it was the tree of knowledge of good and evil. &gt;&gt; They they they'd rather pick their own good, pick their own evil and say, "Okay, well, let's see what's this." And that's where all this fuss is about. &gt;&gt; That's why I'm sure the automobile, like brother Brandham says, that was a good thing. But brother Brandham, he said in a quote, "Umobiles kill more than than gunpowder does. &gt;&gt; It's out of good. It's out of good intentions." But every time we bite out of that tree, that's what happens. &gt;&gt; Every time we're governed by our own selves, maybe it looks good. Maybe we think it's all right. Maybe we think it's our own our own way and it's good. It's always going to lead to evil. always going the other way will always lead to evil. &gt;&gt; I realized that even with Satan, he uh I truly believe that he thought he had a better way. &gt;&gt; It was not so much like Cain where he had uh a wealth of evil that he wanted to kill his brother. But think about Cain. In the beginning, he thought his sacrifice was a better one. &gt;&gt; That was good intentions. &gt;&gt; Lucifer, he probably had a better way. It wasn't so much that he wanted to take over and he he's like, "No, I want a I have a better way." &gt;&gt; And he says once he went out of the way, he went out of the word. And every time we leave the word, evil there is present. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Darkness is there. Amen. &gt;&gt; And those were the seeds of it. And now we see the fruit of it. &gt;&gt; Every time we make our own way, maybe it looks innocent. Maybe it looks all right. Look at the fruit. &gt;&gt; Look at the end product. And we'll see. Wow. Because I made my own way. Because I took control of my own will. Jeremiah 10:23 it says 10:23 and 24 it says, "Oh Lord, I know that the way of man is not in himself. It is not in man that walketh to direct his steps. Oh Lord, correct me but with judgment and not thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing." That's my prayer today. Lord, it's not my my job to go my own way or do those things because every time we do it, we're going to find ourselves in the mud. We're going to find ourselves in trouble. But Lord, correct me with your judgment, not in your anger. Brother Brandham, he says in the message, "Believest um thou this." He says how beautiful um that his uh that is of the Holy Spirit our sustaining strength to carry the church on. If they failed to eat mana they died. If we fail to eat on the Holy Ghost we die. If we failed to pray through daily all the time keep under the blood you will wither up and die in your Christian experience. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Prayer is important. Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we have the form and we have the scaffold work of a Christian, but whenever we leave that source, man, we're withering up. We need it. We need it. And you know what? We're I'm not going to point any fingers. I'm just going to tell me I need it. &gt;&gt; How many times do do I forget to pray? Why Why should it be a um a duty? Why should it be something? It should be a very desire &gt;&gt; to in every matter in everything in every every desire that you have every person that you love they you put them in prayer &gt;&gt; and so say Lord I'm putting this person up &gt;&gt; I'm putting this person in your will &gt;&gt; man there's a partnership in prayer it's not a duty it's not this it's a partnership that's why a child of God he can reason with God. Abraham, he pleaded with God. Lord, if if there's 50, please don't burn down Sodom and Gomorrah. &gt;&gt; What was it? It wasn't just a casual conversation. It was a desperate prayer &gt;&gt; for his his uh family member Lot. &gt;&gt; Lord, if there's only there's 50, Lord, all right, there's 40. If there's 30, if there's 20, if there's 10, and God reasoned with him the whole time. The amazing thing is God was working through him. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we think we're praying our own desires, but it's God's will in you &gt;&gt; already. &gt;&gt; Brother Baram he says in presuming he says all right so Israel called out Moses. So Israel God called out Moses uh and said I am going to destroy the whole nation. Just step aside. Moses interceded, throwed himself in the breach. It was Christ and Moses. You see, God would have killed the whole world one time of um one time for sin. Christ throwed himself in the breach for the whole human race. Moses throwed himself in the breach for Israel. He said, "You made a promise, God. You made a promise that you would take them into the land." Now, you think he was a wise man. You think he had a better thought than God? &gt;&gt; He was projecting God's very heart. &gt;&gt; He says, "You made a pro uh" He says, "That's right. What did Moses do to God?" When it looked like God was going to do something contrary, he throwed the word in his way. Amen. Oh, I love that. How now I feel like shouting just just talking about it. See, put the word in the way. God can't walk over his own word. Said you promised to do it. You You said you would take them to a good land that was flowing with milk and honey. &gt;&gt; I told them what you said and here we are. We are in your hands. &gt;&gt; You know, it sounds disrespectful, but God wants us to make them feel obligated. Say, "Lord, you're obligated to heal me. &gt;&gt; Lord, you you said it in your word. &gt;&gt; It's not my own thoughts that I'm giving you, Lord. It's your word." &gt;&gt; What is it? It's It's God communing with himself. Again, &gt;&gt; just as he said, "Let us create man in our own image." Now, he's reasoning with himself, allowing the flesh to project his very heart &gt;&gt; and said, "Lord, we're in your hands." Yes, &gt;&gt; I'm in your hands, Lord. &gt;&gt; You said it in your word. &gt;&gt; Don't bring your own ideas. Don't bring your own will. Don't bring your own wisdom. Bring him his own word. &gt;&gt; That's man, that's the greatest thing. The greatest people I've ever met is men of the word. &gt;&gt; Imagine God. &gt;&gt; That's what that's what makes me a Christian because God is a God of his own word. And and if you stand on his word, do not deviate from one side. He has to. He's obligated &gt;&gt; to take you over. &gt;&gt; He's obligated to heal you. He's obligated to restore you. &gt;&gt; Well, it hasn't happened yet. Well, keep on waiting. &gt;&gt; Well, man, I'm I'm worse than I was yesterday. Well, keep on trusting &gt;&gt; because God, he does not forsake his people. If there's a doubt, if there's a barrier, break that barrier away. &gt;&gt; Break those things that that are contrary to God's word and put his word in his way &gt;&gt; and say, "Lord, this is your word. &gt;&gt; I have nothing else. I don't have my thoughts anymore. I failed three, four, five times already because I thought I had a better way. But now I'm putting your own word &gt;&gt; and I'm here on my knees with the thing that I need, Lord. How can my prayers affect the predetermined will of God? Do we change his mind? No. Our prayer is inspired by the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; It becomes the very decrees of God. Our prayer. That's why when we profess with our mouths when we confess the Bible I think it's homoglo homologio it means to say the same thing it homo means the same and logos means the word &gt;&gt; it says to say the same word &gt;&gt; so when we're confessing it's not only sins that we're confessing we're confessing his own word back to him &gt;&gt; and saying Lord Lord, you said it. I believe it. Lord, you have to do it. &gt;&gt; This is not a a petition of selfish and personal gains. Hey, who's guilty of that? Lord, I need another car, Lord. I need a raise. I need this. &gt;&gt; That's human nature. But whenever we can get into his will, &gt;&gt; when we can get into his spirit, you'll see him move. I I I believe he will give us what we want. I believe sometimes whenever there's a leak, whenever there's this, we can ask the Lord, "Lord, help me, Lord." &gt;&gt; And he'll do it. But when we're in his will, the Bible says in James 4:3, it says, "Ye ask and receive not because ye asked amiss &gt;&gt; in vain you for selfish reasons that ye may consume it upon your lusts." Brother Brandham, he says in the Godhead explain, he says, "You must test your motive and your objective first. First find the will of God and then you find your objective and then test your motive and see if your motive is right. Then as Jesus said in in in Mark 11:23, if you say to this mountain, "Be moved and you don't doubt in your heart." But as long as you've got doubt in your heart, whether it's the will of God or your motive or objective is wrong, how is it going to move? Man, he said a mouthful there. He says everything has to align. Your motives, your objectives, your faith, you everything has to align. If there's doubt, even though the motive is right, it ain't going to work. &gt;&gt; If the objective isn't right, it ain't going to work. If you still got faith, &gt;&gt; if if the motive isn't right, but you have everything else, it ain't going to work. It has to be, Lord, I'm here in faith. I'm in your word mountain me be moved and watch it move. Watch the things that you need happen. God's faithful to his word. When you begin to plead his own promises, then your will is his will. You begin to be so in Christ when you begin to pray, "Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven." It's God's legal right to work and to act through you. You begin to be an agent. &gt;&gt; You begin to see the sovereignty of God where it's not in other places. You begin to see things where people might not see God at all, but you see him every step of the way. &gt;&gt; Whether it's in the simple things or the big things. You know, I like whenever a person begins to see God in the simple things, you know, even if it's this it's traffic, it's just good. Say, Lord, it's praise God. You know, &gt;&gt; when you see God in everything. Brother Brandham says when somebody receives the Holy Ghost, they begin to see God in the birds. &gt;&gt; They begin to see God in the sky. I'd rather see God everywhere I go and everything I do and blame it on God &gt;&gt; than to be a pessimist &gt;&gt; than to be negative thinking &gt;&gt; to kick the kick the dog and kick everything and be be angry about everything &gt;&gt; because nothing is working. I'm always late. I'm this. I'm that. Say, "Lord, thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. I was probably late because there was a crash. &gt;&gt; Lord, thank you for this and thank you for that." and you begin to give everything with thanksgiving and prayer. &gt;&gt; And you say, "Thank you, Lord, for the life you've given me." &gt;&gt; Well, you're in this condition. Thank you, Lord, that I'm still alive. &gt;&gt; Well, look at what's happening to this and that. Well, thank you, Lord, because he's going to find a way. &gt;&gt; That's God. &gt;&gt; God is in every single thing. God does not he's he's more attention to detail than the devil &gt;&gt; because what is it um the devil's in the details God beat him way more &gt;&gt; God is a prem premeditated God &gt;&gt; everything that has happened everything that is happening is it's Christ in there &gt;&gt; that's what brother Brandham said in Christ is the mystery of God it revealed he said every single dot every single iota every single cross He in the word is Christ. &gt;&gt; And he says, "How about us?" &gt;&gt; And everything we do, everything that's around us, we see Christ in it. &gt;&gt; And we say, "Lord, it's your will. &gt;&gt; Lord, it's your will." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Divine intervention. It starts with your prayer. Just like Daniel, think about it. That was God's will to give that prophecy. That's if you ever dissect that prophecy, it's one of the greatest to to somebody is unbelieving, if somebody is struggling, you look at that prophecy of the 70 70 weeks of Daniel and people will say, "Oh, no, that must have been written way after." Because it literally to the dot it says what's going to happen. &gt;&gt; It says what kingdoms were going to take place before they were even there. They say, "No, that must have been written after." &gt;&gt; Why? Because that prophecy was so rich &gt;&gt; to the very day, to the very minute for the Jews. And yet, it was Daniel's desire to know those things. It was Daniel's desire to pray those what 21 days. And as he was praying, he thought that was his desire. It was God's will in him &gt;&gt; saying through you and and honestly I've already listened to you but there's things that have to happen &gt;&gt; and the amazing thing is while he was praying maybe while he was thinking that nobody was answering maybe in the mid mid two weeks he was like wow this fasting this praying woo yet there was there was a war happening in on another dimension There was there was devils trying to stop the answer. &gt;&gt; There was angels there fighting for him. Sometimes your prayer maybe it hasn't been hasn't been answered yet, but yet hearts are changing. &gt;&gt; People's thoughts begin to change. Maybe that person that continues to be a rude person at work or his heart is changing &gt;&gt; because of a prayer. &gt;&gt; There's many puzzles that begin to work into place while you're there in prayer saying, "Lord, I believe in you. &gt;&gt; Lord, I know this is going to happen." And maybe you don't see it. Maybe you think everything is dead and everything just, oh, there's no movement. There's no movement in my life. There's no movement in the church. There's &gt;&gt; there's pieces being moved. &gt;&gt; There's things happening, spiritual things. Sometimes it gets worse. But God is obligated to his word. &gt;&gt; God is so good. &gt;&gt; Let us stand to our feet. &gt;&gt; You know the prayer it changes everything. It even brother Brandham says that prayer it sweetens tempers. It says sometimes you know people step on your toes. What do I do to overcome that? Brother Brandham, he says, "Sweeten your temper with prayer." You want to change things, even change your life? Prayer. There was one person that asked, "Lord, how do I get closer to the Lord? How do I get a deeper relationship?" I'm sure they were waiting for this great mystery. He said, "Read your Bible and pray." &gt;&gt; It's as simple as that. It maybe seems like a duty. Maybe it seems like work, but when you realize that there's a lifeline, that there is somebody waiting on that line, &gt;&gt; there's somebody listening, somebody waiting to work. Let us bow our heads. Heavenly Father, &gt;&gt; Lord, it's your will, it's your will that we're here, Father. &gt;&gt; It's your will that we're going through what we're going through. &gt;&gt; It's your will that you've called us, Lord. &gt;&gt; It's your will in all things. And Father, it's even your will in the things that I don't want to let go. Sometimes, Father, we don't want to let go of that thing because we don't feel like anybody's got it. Nobody will take care of it. Only me. But Lord, allow that that spirit of control just to get away. &gt;&gt; And Lord, take control in each and every person's life. Father, &gt;&gt; let your will be done, Lord, on earth as it is with you, Father. Touch each and every person that needs more of you, Father. But Lord, sometimes our will is too strong, Lord. Show them, Father, that you've been knocking. Show them that, Lord, you have so much more to give. We thank you, Jesus. We thank you for your will. We thank you for allowing us to let you in in our lives and that we can understand your word and be here in the last days. Father, what a pleasure. Father, we thank you, Jesus. We ask that you bless each and every person here. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. Amen.
