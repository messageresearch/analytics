[0:00] psalms chapter 25
[0:02] and verse 1.
[0:05] unto thee o lord do i lift up my soul
[0:09] o my god i trust in thee let me not be
[0:12] ashamed
[0:14] let not mine enemies triumph over me
[0:18] yea
[0:19] let none that wait on thee be ashamed
[0:22] let them be ashamed which transgress
[0:26] without cause and just to save time i'm
[0:28] going to jump down to the verse 20.
[0:31] o keep my soul and deliver me
[0:34] let me not be ashamed
[0:36] for i put my trust in thee
[0:39] let integrity and uprightness preserve
[0:42] me
[0:43] for i wait on thee amen the lord had his
[0:47] blessing to the word you may be seated
[0:53] now i know that brother aaron is a good
[0:55] teacher
[0:56] and that you're well-taught people and
[0:58] that uh
[1:00] well-grounded in the word
[1:02] i think he's been now in arizona in
[1:04] phoenix now for 20 months or so and uh
[1:08] so uh but yet as i as i begin this
[1:11] morning i don't want to
[1:13] assume that you know something or assume
[1:15] that you've been taught something and so
[1:16] you forgive me if i repeat things that
[1:19] maybe you've heard
[1:20] or things that that are maybe
[1:24] well established in your heart
[1:27] you know we know that in that when we go
[1:29] to the beginning of the bible we really
[1:32] go to john 1
[1:34] because john 1 was before creation
[1:37] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:40] word was with god and the word was god
[1:43] it says
[1:44] and then then in verse 10 of that
[1:46] chapter it says he was in the world and
[1:48] the world was made by him and the world
[1:51] knew him not
[1:52] he came unto his own and his own
[1:54] received him not speaking about israel
[1:57] but as many as received him
[2:01] can you say amen to that
[2:03] as many as received him to them
[2:06] gave he power to become the sons of god
[2:11] even to them that believe on his name
[2:14] which were born
[2:16] not of blood nor of the will of flesh
[2:20] nor of the will of man but of god and so
[2:23] we realize that if we are sons and
[2:25] daughters of god we always were sons and
[2:28] daughters of god all right but we needed
[2:30] to be empowered to become what we were
[2:33] meant to be
[2:35] you know that we god had us in his
[2:37] thoughts before the foundation of the
[2:38] world brother branham describing john 1
[2:41] he says the logos he says that's where
[2:43] melchizedek comes into view he says
[2:45] that's where the lamb's book of life
[2:47] comes into view he says that's the son
[2:49] that came out from the from elohim the
[2:52] self-existing one and the first
[2:54] expression of god and then we know that
[2:57] word became flesh and dwelt among us
[3:00] the fullness of the godhead dwelling
[3:02] bodily in jesus christ but in him was
[3:05] attributes
[3:07] in him was thoughts and brother branham
[3:09] explains that those thoughts are eternal
[3:12] it's not like our thoughts
[3:14] we think
[3:15] you know i think today i don't know what
[3:17] time i'll get to church or you know i
[3:19] don't know what the traffic's going to
[3:20] be like i don't know how many cars are
[3:22] going to be on the road will i run into
[3:24] construction on the way to church these
[3:26] are all new thoughts to us but to god he
[3:29] knows how many cars there is
[3:31] he knows how much traffic there is he
[3:33] knows how much construction is going on
[3:35] he knows exactly who would be here
[3:38] amen he knew that i would be here he
[3:41] knew that you would be here he knows all
[3:42] things his thoughts are eternal and
[3:45] because we were in his thoughts that's
[3:48] the eternal part that that he wants to
[3:51] quicken us to the thoughts that he had
[3:54] of us before the foundation of the world
[3:58] god held alone with his thoughts he said
[4:01] to job he says the morning stars sang
[4:04] together and the sons of god shouted for
[4:07] joy
[4:07] that was in god's thoughts when he saw
[4:10] you the sons of god the attributes of
[4:12] god you were shouting for joy
[4:16] so that's where he's taking us
[4:20] some of you have a further journey than
[4:21] others
[4:24] amen
[4:26] some of you are very quiet some of you
[4:28] come to church and and you know you're
[4:30] wrestling with a lot of things but if
[4:32] you really knew what god thought of you
[4:34] and you really knew what the apostle
[4:36] paul was writing in romans 8 and he said
[4:38] those who he foreknew in other words
[4:41] those that were in his thoughts before
[4:43] he did predestinate to be conformed to
[4:46] the image of his son moreover whom he
[4:49] did predestinate them he called
[4:52] are you called yes how many have you
[4:54] called all right all right he called you
[4:57] then if he as many as he called them he
[4:59] justified
[5:01] which is as though you never sinned in
[5:03] the first place how are you justified by
[5:05] believing the call abraham believed god
[5:08] and it was accounted to him for
[5:10] righteousness so paul picks it up and
[5:12] says how was abraham justified was it by
[5:15] works or was it by faith
[5:17] it was by faith god spoke the word and
[5:20] he believed god spoke the word and you
[5:23] believed
[5:24] amen you received his word he justified
[5:27] you and those whom he justified he has
[5:30] already glorified
[5:32] he already sees you as a finished
[5:35] product and everything that's happening
[5:37] in our lives was already in the mind of
[5:39] god to take us to the finished product
[5:42] amen and so paul says what shall we then
[5:44] say to these things
[5:46] if god before us
[5:48] who can be against us
[5:50] that was the revelation that joshua had
[5:53] when the 10th five says we're not able
[5:55] they said but if god before us we are
[5:58] more than able
[5:59] amen and so paul says then i'm persuaded
[6:02] that neither height nor depth nor
[6:04] principality nor power nor tribulation
[6:06] or persecution not things present not
[6:08] things to come
[6:11] nor anything
[6:12] shall be able to separate us from the
[6:15] love of god that's in christ jesus now i
[6:18] wonder in the mind of god that the sons
[6:20] of god were shouting for joy
[6:22] amen he sees us there
[6:24] amen and the more that god reveals
[6:27] himself to us the more that becomes a
[6:30] reality within our lives
[6:37] so we are
[6:39] one of his thoughts
[6:41] that has become manifest in our day
[6:45] we were in his mind
[6:47] waiting for our time to come
[6:50] and our time came
[6:51] and we materialized that's not brother
[6:54] tim's ideas that's right out of the
[6:56] message of the hour
[6:59] now we gather here in church for many
[7:01] reasons
[7:03] you've come this morning
[7:08] i could list many reasons
[7:12] many of you are in need
[7:15] maybe some of you are physically in need
[7:18] some of you are emotionally in in need
[7:22] sister lori you've been on our hearts
[7:24] you know you've you've lost your mother
[7:27] and uh
[7:28] you know the different ones go through
[7:30] different experiences
[7:32] of different things in their lives god
[7:34] knows those things
[7:36] all right and so we we come
[7:39] to worship
[7:42] we come to lift up the name of jesus
[7:47] abide
[7:49] and when we use the word edified means
[7:50] to be built up paul even said about his
[7:52] own ministry if there are ministers here
[7:54] he said about his own ministry i will
[7:57] not use
[7:58] my gift for destruction only for
[8:01] edification
[8:03] we don't come to to tear down we come to
[8:06] build up
[8:07] it's it's god's purpose in our lives and
[8:10] in our ministry and even together to
[8:13] edify one another
[8:15] we have needs
[8:17] of different types
[8:19] as i've already mentioned
[8:21] you know in first john 5 it says this is
[8:24] the confidence that we have in him
[8:27] that
[8:28] if we ask anything
[8:30] according to his will
[8:33] he heareth us
[8:34] amen so it's not just if we ask anything
[8:37] but if we ask according to his will
[8:40] and so we we must find the channel of
[8:43] god's purpose in our lives and if we
[8:44] know that he hear us whatsoever we ask
[8:47] we know that we have the petitions that
[8:50] we desired of him if any man see his
[8:53] brother sin of sin unto death and so on
[8:55] and so forth and and so uh but the
[8:59] purpose as we gather together is that we
[9:02] know that if we're asking according to
[9:04] his will we have a confidence that he
[9:06] hears us and be that he answers us but
[9:09] then james picks up the thought of of
[9:11] the church and he says why are there
[9:13] wars and fightings among you
[9:16] he says
[9:18] is this okay
[9:20] why are there wars and fightings among
[9:22] you he says
[9:24] you come they not hence even of your
[9:27] lusts that war in your members
[9:30] now i'm building to something here and
[9:32] so i want you to listen to this closely
[9:34] he says you lust and have not now that
[9:37] word lust is not just unclean lust to
[9:40] to
[9:41] uh uh the opposite sex or something like
[9:44] that that's not just all that is
[9:45] speaking about is speaking about natural
[9:47] desires
[9:48] okay
[9:49] and we all have natural desires that we
[9:52] have to be care careful of as paul says
[9:55] you know we crucify the flesh we die
[9:57] daily and so but james writes here you
[10:00] lust and have not you kill and desire to
[10:04] have and cannot obtain you fight in war
[10:07] yet you have not because you ask not
[10:11] and you ask and receive not because you
[10:14] ask a miss
[10:16] that you may consume it upon your lusts
[10:20] or your natural desires
[10:22] okay so john writes he says if we ask
[10:25] anything according to his will he hears
[10:28] us james
[10:29] when you ask be careful that you're not
[10:31] just asking according to natural desires
[10:34] okay so god is not interested in our
[10:37] lust
[10:38] he's not interested in our natural
[10:40] desires just hang with me for a minute
[10:42] i'm going to go here and he's not
[10:44] interested just in the desires of our
[10:46] flesh or of our mind
[10:49] which the book of ephesians chapter 2
[10:51] says we all walked according to
[10:53] okay
[10:54] it's we it says you hath he quickened
[10:58] who were dead in trespasses and sins
[11:00] wherein time past you walked according
[11:03] to the course of this world according to
[11:05] the prince of the power of the heir the
[11:07] spirit that now worketh in the children
[11:08] of disobedience among whom also
[11:12] we all
[11:15] that's all of us
[11:16] we all had our conversation in times
[11:19] past in the lust of the flesh
[11:22] fulfilling the desires of the flesh and
[11:25] of the mind and there's no greater time
[11:28] than laodicea this
[11:30] this uh age of commerce and capitalism
[11:34] and money and buying and selling then
[11:37] then there's no greater age than this to
[11:39] fulfill the desires of the flesh and of
[11:42] the mind
[11:43] anything anybody wants is available out
[11:45] there it's it just seems like there's no
[11:47] limit to it he says and we were by
[11:50] nature the children of wrath even as
[11:52] others
[11:54] but god
[11:57] that's not just
[11:59] english translation that's in the
[12:00] original but god yes
[12:03] amen who is rich in mercy
[12:06] for his great love wherewith he loved us
[12:11] even when we were dead in sins has
[12:14] quickened us together with christ by
[12:17] grace are you saved and hath raised us
[12:19] up together and made us sit in heavenly
[12:23] places in christ
[12:25] that he might in the ages to come show
[12:28] the exceeding riches of his grace in
[12:31] kindness to in his kindness towards us
[12:33] through christ jesus all right now i've
[12:35] already thrown a lot of scripture at you
[12:37] and you might refer to them later later
[12:39] and maybe go through them again
[12:41] but god is not interested god is not
[12:44] maybe interested in the wrong word i'll
[12:46] say god is not moved
[12:48] simply by the desire of your flesh and
[12:51] of your mind
[12:52] now we know he is the high priest that
[12:55] is touched
[12:56] by the feelings of our infirmities so
[12:59] it's not that he doesn't care
[13:01] about how we feel
[13:03] he cares about how you feel this morning
[13:06] but there has to be a higher purpose in
[13:09] our healing than just feeling good
[13:13] all right there's got to be a greater
[13:15] purpose in something that you want
[13:18] deliverance from in your mind
[13:20] than just having peace
[13:22] and just being able to to be at rest in
[13:25] your thoughts there is a greater purpose
[13:28] of god in the individual as hebrews 4
[13:32] says for we have not a high priest which
[13:34] cannot be touched with the feelings of
[13:36] our infirmities i love that double
[13:39] negative there
[13:41] paul doesn't just say we have a high
[13:43] priest that is touched
[13:45] but he says we haven't it's it's he's
[13:47] very specific he says you don't have a
[13:49] high priest who cannot be touched so
[13:51] what he's saying is
[13:53] he's not necessarily touched
[13:57] but he can be touched
[13:59] by the feelings of your infirmity it's
[14:02] not just because you're infirm that he's
[14:05] touched
[14:06] but it's because he's your high priest
[14:09] yes that you're touched he's your high
[14:12] priest
[14:14] medical science is not our high priest
[14:18] we thank god for everything medical
[14:19] science can do but medical science is
[14:21] not our high priest
[14:23] psychology is not our high priest
[14:27] if it can help anybody that's wonderful
[14:29] even brother brown says you know
[14:30] whatever somebody can help somebody with
[14:32] that's great you know we thank god and
[14:34] make somebody else's life easier i'm not
[14:36] into psychology i'm not i don't have
[14:39] psychology background or anything like
[14:41] that but there is a word that became
[14:43] flesh that can be touched
[14:46] because he is your high priest
[14:50] amen and he is a faithful high priest
[14:53] having suffered and been tempted
[14:57] bible says was in all points tempted
[15:00] like we are yet without sin or without
[15:03] unbelief so while god is touched by the
[15:06] feelings of our infirmity it takes more
[15:08] than the feelings to touch god it takes
[15:11] revelation to touch god
[15:14] all right me so far
[15:21] one day jesus
[15:23] walking along the bible says in matthew
[15:25] 21 he says
[15:27] he
[15:28] went to a fig tree to have a fig anybody
[15:31] like figs
[15:32] i like figs i eat them all the time
[15:37] and
[15:38] it says jesus
[15:41] saw there was no fruit on it and
[15:44] and cursed the tree
[15:46] i get my fakes from costco
[15:51] if they don't have
[15:54] no i don't curse costco
[16:00] but jesus cursed the fig tree
[16:03] and the disciples might have thought
[16:05] well that's an overreaction
[16:07] because the time of figs was not yet
[16:10] man you know this is jesus he does
[16:12] everything right
[16:14] and now he gets mad at the fig tree
[16:16] because there's no fig and it's not even
[16:18] the time of figs yet
[16:20] and so
[16:21] that maybe stumbled them a little bit
[16:23] then they come back walking by the tree
[16:26] and it's withered away
[16:28] it's dying there's no life left in it
[16:29] jesus cast the life out of it
[16:32] i believe partly so that a prophet in
[16:34] this day can say see there's a life in
[16:37] it that needs to be cast out
[16:39] it says it's like cancer
[16:41] he says cancer has a life in it if you
[16:43] cast out the life the cancer will die
[16:47] and show us the principle of healing and
[16:50] the principle of cursing the thing and
[16:52] so and and jesus but then jesus said to
[16:55] them as they marveled at it
[16:57] and jesus answered and said verily i
[16:59] said to you if you have faith
[17:02] if you have faith
[17:03] and doubt not you shall not only do this
[17:06] which is done to the fig tree but also
[17:08] if you shall say unto this mountain be
[17:11] thou removed and be thou cast into the
[17:13] sea it shall be done
[17:16] and all things whatsoever you shall ask
[17:20] in prayer believing
[17:22] you shall receive
[17:25] let me say that again but and all things
[17:28] whatsoever you shall ask in prayer
[17:32] believing you
[17:34] shall
[17:35] receive
[17:37] hallelujah what a gospel
[17:39] what a wonderful wonderful promise
[17:42] brother adam says in the message speak
[17:43] to the mountain
[17:45] he says if you could only see the
[17:46] simplicity of god's eternal purpose
[17:49] and the sovereignty of his grace
[17:52] could you imagine him using that great
[17:54] power to put a curse on a tree
[17:57] because it didn't have any fruit on it
[18:00] and leaving thousands lay unhealed
[18:04] see brother brown says if you could see
[18:06] the simplicity of god's eternal purpose
[18:11] he says he cursed the tree and left
[18:13] people lay unhealed
[18:15] he says the tree is part of god's
[18:17] creation as the same as man is part of
[18:19] god's creation but to show that he is
[18:22] concerned about trees about insects if
[18:24] he's concerned about those how much more
[18:27] is he concerned about you
[18:30] amen so he's concerned about all things
[18:33] brother branham says in the breach
[18:35] message and i'm going to
[18:36] change into second gear here
[18:39] he talks about the promise in the breach
[18:42] and the and the title deed
[18:44] and we realize that
[18:46] that
[18:47] this is important to this age because
[18:49] the lamb stepped forth in this age to
[18:51] loose the seals
[18:53] which is not just the revealing of
[18:54] mysteries but in first peter 1 it talks
[18:57] about an inheritance reserved in heaven
[19:00] for us
[19:01] and that's the inheritance that was in
[19:02] the right hand of the father and that it
[19:05] was waiting to be to be claimed and it
[19:08] was redeemed at calvary all that adam
[19:10] lost was paid for at calvary but it has
[19:13] been claimed in our day to the purpose
[19:16] that god would finish his redemptive
[19:19] plan and really what i want to do today
[19:21] is i want to view more
[19:23] of your own uh part of god's great
[19:26] redemptive plan because a lot of times
[19:29] we just look at individual promises
[19:32] and say you know oh this is a promise
[19:33] and i'm trying to see it and i'm trying
[19:35] to hold to it but if we can really see
[19:37] the redemptive purpose of god and our
[19:40] par
[19:41] to purpose then it will raise our faith
[19:44] up and make us realize that we cannot be
[19:47] defeated
[19:49] and if you cannot if you can see that
[19:51] you could not be defeated then you can
[19:53] go through life knowing that anything
[19:55] that you battle is you are you are more
[19:58] than able to overcome it because christ
[20:01] has already paid the price of our
[20:03] overcoming
[20:05] and may god pour in faith this morning
[20:07] to each and every one of us
[20:09] so brother brown talking about it he
[20:10] says
[20:11] the bible told us in matthew
[20:13] that the meat shall inherit the earth
[20:15] now the meek is not humble that's a
[20:17] whole surface in itself me is i'll just
[20:20] drop it in
[20:22] humility is your own attitude towards
[20:24] yourself but meekness is how you treat
[20:26] others
[20:27] all right and so i'll leave that there
[20:29] but he says the title deed to eternal
[20:31] life abstract title deed to eternal life
[20:34] when adam forfeited it for wisdom
[20:36] instead of faith it went back to the
[20:39] hands of the owner almighty god
[20:41] then he says what does abstract mean
[20:44] and i'm on page 86 of this
[20:48] look at it when you go home what does
[20:50] abstract mean it means it's searched all
[20:52] the way back to the beginning
[20:54] all right and so we and and when brother
[20:57] brown's preaching on abstract title d
[20:59] he's actually taken an american concept
[21:01] of law we don't even have this in canada
[21:03] or the different parts of the world they
[21:05] don't have it but he's taken an american
[21:08] term of an abstract which is a title
[21:10] search that searches the the claims upon
[21:14] the title it's not the title itself but
[21:17] you've got to have the abstract and the
[21:19] title deed and that's why he calls it
[21:22] abstract title d not only is it your
[21:24] inheritance but the abstract has
[21:26] searched all the way back by the holy
[21:28] ghost and the fact that you have the
[21:30] holy ghost shows that there's no claims
[21:32] against you all the way back to the
[21:34] beginning and you have a right to your
[21:36] inheritance okay and he says its
[21:38] redemption means all legal possession to
[21:41] all that was lost by adam and eve
[21:48] the sons of god ought to shout for joy
[21:52] it's redemption what redemption the
[21:55] price of calvary and the lamb taking the
[21:57] book in our day
[22:00] the lamb taking the book the redemption
[22:02] means all legal possession to all
[22:08] adam and eve
[22:11] what's the hindrance the hindrance is
[22:14] the the flesh and the spirit
[22:17] because in your soul if you're born
[22:19] again you're sealed to the day of your
[22:20] redemption your nature has been changed
[22:23] there's nothing the devil can do about
[22:24] that you can go fishing every day of
[22:26] your life not that i recommend that but
[22:28] you can go fishing every day of your
[22:30] life you're still going to make it if
[22:31] you're sealed you're sealed
[22:33] that's the work of god that that totally
[22:35] changes the individual on the inside and
[22:37] brings you into line as the son or
[22:39] daughter of god but because you've been
[22:41] changed you've been empowered to
[22:43] manifest the life of a son of god in
[22:46] your day
[22:48] to as many as received him to them gave
[22:50] he power to become the sons of god all
[22:53] right so he says it's legal possession
[22:55] to the abstract deed title deed of
[22:57] eternal life means you possess
[23:00] everything that adam and eve lost whoo
[23:03] what of it brethren the possession of
[23:05] that deed so if we know who we are
[23:09] why are we hindered from having anything
[23:12] that we have need of
[23:14] i i have to drop this in i want to go
[23:16] here tonight but i have to drop this in
[23:17] tonight
[23:18] this morning rather
[23:20] and that is brother branham said if
[23:21] you're born again by the spirit of god
[23:22] you have enough power in you to speak
[23:24] worlds into existence and go and live on
[23:26] them
[23:27] is that right
[23:29] holy ghost filled
[23:30] you have enough power to speak anything
[23:32] into existence but he says it's governed
[23:34] by a law
[23:36] and the law is not a laws of do's and
[23:38] don'ts it's not how much how you live or
[23:41] how sincere you are even it's
[23:44] the law is
[23:46] which is revelation
[23:48] because i'll tell you now this morning
[23:50] if it wasn't governed by a law
[23:53] no holy spirit
[24:00] because you have enough power in you to
[24:02] heal every disease
[24:05] you have the power of the resurrection
[24:07] is in you
[24:09] see the resurrected saints went into the
[24:11] grave
[24:12] with that power why haven't they come
[24:14] out of the grave yet because it's not
[24:16] the hour of that revelation
[24:18] we're now in the season
[24:21] but we don't know the day or the hour
[24:24] and so even the raptured saints you have
[24:26] enough power by the new birth for the
[24:29] rapture see when you're sealed by the
[24:31] holy ghost you already got enough power
[24:33] to fulfill every scripture
[24:36] it's not the power that's lacking the
[24:37] power has been in the church brother
[24:39] branham said down through the seven
[24:40] church ages but what has been lacking is
[24:43] revelation and revelation is faith and
[24:46] how does faith come faith comes by
[24:48] hearing hearing by the word of god
[24:51] that's why the word is so important to
[24:53] being revealed when the title deed was
[24:56] was redeemed and the seals were broken
[25:00] what was it doing it was revealing
[25:02] mysteries that were previously hidden
[25:05] from the church mystery truths that will
[25:08] loose the power of the rapture within
[25:11] the church
[25:12] you see it so it's those seven thunders
[25:15] brother branham said those mysteries
[25:16] contained under those seven thunders
[25:18] which were the mysteries contained in
[25:20] the seals that that those revelations is
[25:23] what is empowering us to live more than
[25:27] any other church age has ever lived
[25:30] because this age will take a rapture
[25:34] paul says there will be a people we
[25:35] shall not all sleep but we shall all be
[25:38] changed
[25:39] hallelujah with this mortal will put on
[25:42] immortality this corruption one day will
[25:44] put on incorruption even even abraham
[25:48] saw that but we'll go beyond what
[25:50] abraham saw
[25:52] we won't just be turned young again
[25:54] we'll be made immortal
[25:56] we'll never die again there'll be a
[25:58] people that step across the curtain of
[26:00] time there'll be people that one day are
[26:03] living in an unredeemed body and the
[26:05] next day will come to the fullness of
[26:07] adoption to with redemption of their
[26:09] mortal bodies and they will they will
[26:12] have the ability to step across the
[26:14] curtain because they will no longer be
[26:16] bound by sin
[26:19] hallelujah
[26:20] our understanding will be
[26:22] loosed we'll never make another mistake
[26:27] aren't you glad for that
[26:30] we'll never make another mistake because
[26:32] we we sure hate making them now don't we
[26:36] because of the nature that's in our soul
[26:38] but one day the nature that's in our
[26:40] soul will also be in our spirit and will
[26:42] also be in our flesh
[26:45] hallelujah
[26:52] so we know that adam and eve lost this
[26:54] inheritance
[26:56] but that did not change the inheritance
[27:00] its bible says it was reserved
[27:02] incorruptible in heaven
[27:05] and so
[27:07] the revelation of the word
[27:10] is the revelation
[27:12] of what was always in god
[27:15] for the manifestation
[27:18] of himself
[27:20] in you
[27:23] the revelation of the word is not
[27:24] intellectual understanding
[27:27] the revelation of the word is something
[27:29] the gates of hell cannot prevail against
[27:32] when god and i'll say god is the only
[27:34] giver of revelation
[27:36] i can preach brother aaron can preach
[27:38] others can preach you can read the bible
[27:41] you can listen to a message and that and
[27:44] that's all good but you can't give
[27:45] yourself a revelation
[27:47] no preacher can give you a revelation
[27:50] but we can lay the word out and the holy
[27:52] spirit can anoint that word to you
[27:54] personally you can hear something today
[27:56] maybe something that you've heard before
[27:58] and the holy spirit come on that and the
[28:00] gates of hell will never prevail against
[28:02] that
[28:03] it's a revelation that's anchored in
[28:05] your soul throughout and if the gates of
[28:07] hell will not prevail against it it's
[28:09] eternal
[28:10] amen
[28:13] and so whatever we have need of is
[28:14] already paid for in calvary
[28:22] one day jesus
[28:23] went by a village called the it was
[28:25] called the village of the samaritans
[28:28] and
[28:29] he sent messengers there to go and make
[28:32] ready for him
[28:33] and the bible says they wouldn't receive
[28:35] him
[28:37] but it was the last week two weeks of
[28:39] his ministry
[28:41] and the reason they wouldn't receive him
[28:44] because the bible says his face was as
[28:47] though he would go to jerusalem
[28:50] it's an interesting statement
[28:53] he was in the last two weeks of his
[28:55] earthly journey
[28:57] there was a purpose
[28:59] to fulfill
[29:01] his his thoughts in other words his mind
[29:05] was entirely on that purpose i'm sure
[29:07] there was sick in this town that needed
[29:09] healing
[29:11] i'm sure there was people that wanted to
[29:12] hear the word of god
[29:14] there was many needs there in that
[29:16] samaritan village no doubt
[29:18] but
[29:19] the bible says they wouldn't receive him
[29:21] because
[29:23] probably he wouldn't have meetings the
[29:24] way they wanted meetings
[29:27] they probably wanted prayer lines and he
[29:29] wasn't interested in prayer lines
[29:31] you know they probably maybe wanted
[29:33] altar calls he wasn't interested in
[29:34] altar calls
[29:36] he had a purpose to fulfill
[29:38] and his purpose was to be the lamb of
[29:40] god
[29:41] to take away the sins of the world and
[29:44] he knew what his life was all about and
[29:46] so that eternal purpose was unfolding
[29:49] itself there in that we'll call it that
[29:51] first easter weekend
[29:53] as as jesus began to move towards all
[29:56] that was necessary of the crucifixion
[29:58] and then the going down to hell and
[30:01] preaching to souls in prison and then
[30:03] the resurrection and the and the cl and
[30:06] and the
[30:07] the vindication of the price that was
[30:09] paid all of those things
[30:11] the presence of god was moving him
[30:14] to his purpose
[30:19] david says in psalms 25
[30:22] he says unto thee o lord do i lift up my
[30:25] soul
[30:27] forgive me for taking so long of a
[30:28] foundation this morning
[30:31] but
[30:32] he's lifting up his soul
[30:35] not unto the o god do i lift up my mind
[30:37] or unto thee oh god do i lift up my
[30:39] feelings
[30:43] i'll i'll just tell you one of brother
[30:45] tim's pet peeves sometimes we sing songs
[30:49] that it's like unto thee o lord do i
[30:51] lift up my feelings
[30:56] i've been through this and i've been
[30:57] through that and
[31:00] i just love it when my two-year-old
[31:02] daughter
[31:03] sings all my life you have been faithful
[31:11] not much of a testimony there
[31:16] i love that song though because it's
[31:18] real to me
[31:19] but you know when you get the little
[31:20] children singing some of those songs you
[31:22] know i've been through a great trial and
[31:24] he was there and it's like you're five
[31:27] years old
[31:29] what have you been through
[31:32] that's just me that's just brother tim
[31:35] we all enjoy music the way we enjoy
[31:37] music and there are times like david
[31:39] that we lift up our soul unto the lord
[31:42] and the scripture speaks about the soul
[31:44] in different ways and sometimes the soul
[31:47] just describes existence adam became a
[31:49] living soul
[31:51] sometimes it describes the whole being
[31:53] as as being how many souls there were in
[31:56] the city or so on and so forth and and
[31:58] but sometimes it describes just the
[32:01] innermost part and in the light of the
[32:03] message brother
[32:05] we're a three-part being
[32:07] we have a soul we have a spirit we have
[32:09] a body
[32:10] and that soul comes from god and is
[32:13] purposed in life
[32:15] and of necessity there is a deep calling
[32:19] the scripture says there is a uh a
[32:21] desire deep within the inside and and
[32:25] that soul is the real you
[32:29] and and that's really who you are your
[32:31] your outer man is not you it's you know
[32:34] you're you're looking at a certain
[32:35] stature and a certain individual i had a
[32:37] i was telling the brothers yesterday
[32:39] there was a man in ethiopia that had a
[32:41] vision
[32:42] of uh he was stan he was in church one
[32:45] morning and and uh not a believer he was
[32:48] just in a church local church and he was
[32:50] sitting there all of a sudden he was
[32:52] caught away into a vision and he saw
[32:55] himself standing there looking up at a
[32:57] big white man with glasses
[32:59] and dressed a certain way
[33:02] and he thought that was strange he
[33:03] thought well maybe there'll be a white
[33:04] man in the church today and there wasn't
[33:06] and so he didn't know what it was long
[33:08] story short he ends up driving down a
[33:10] street that i happen to be standing on
[33:13] after the last service
[33:15] of in the last place in ethiopia and i
[33:18] was just just had kind of moved out of
[33:20] the church and was standing by myself on
[33:22] the street and he's driving down the
[33:23] road hadn't actually missed his turn he
[33:25] told me and ended up on this street that
[33:27] he doesn't usually go down but it was
[33:29] sunday morning ethiopia is very
[33:30] religious place most people are in
[33:32] church so there wasn't a lot of traffic
[33:34] it wasn't a lot of people he's driving
[33:35] down the road and he looks over
[33:37] and he sees the big white man with
[33:39] glasses that he saw in the vision
[33:41] dressed exactly like he saw him in the
[33:43] vision
[33:44] and he pulls over and he sends his son
[33:46] man doesn't speak english he sends his
[33:48] son over to me who speaks broken english
[33:50] he says you need to talk to the driver
[33:52] of this car and i was telling the
[33:53] brothers you don't just do anything in a
[33:55] third world country
[33:57] just you know anything well you need to
[33:59] come over here with us you know you just
[34:00] don't do that
[34:02] and
[34:03] you know you so i was very suspicious
[34:05] and finally over the course of time i
[34:08] i had one of the local brothers
[34:10] talk to the young man who spoke broken
[34:12] english and found out the story that the
[34:15] driver was his father and and uh and and
[34:18] god had obviously spoken to him so i
[34:20] spent about 15 minutes preaching this
[34:22] message to him there on the sidewalk but
[34:25] my point was
[34:27] god won't lose one
[34:30] he was going to make sure that that man
[34:34] heard this message
[34:36] god knows every soul that he had in his
[34:38] mind before the foundation of the world
[34:42] and we look at each other but really we
[34:45] don't always see the the eternal purpose
[34:48] of god that's in the soul of the
[34:50] individual that's yearning to be
[34:52] expressed and the soul might not feel
[34:56] in the sense that the body feels
[34:59] or it or maybe it might not have emotion
[35:02] in the sense that the spirit has emotion
[35:05] because the soul has faith or unbelief
[35:08] but but there is a yearning in the depth
[35:10] of that because of the predestinated
[35:12] purpose
[35:13] and the devil will attack you in your
[35:16] flesh
[35:17] and the devil will attack you in your
[35:19] spirit in your mind to try and get you
[35:23] to deny your soul purpose
[35:26] he'll try and overwhelm you like the
[35:28] lunatic of the gadarenes
[35:31] thousands of demons there within that
[35:33] man but it doesn't matter how many
[35:35] demons were in him that soul desire was
[35:40] greater
[35:41] than anything the devil could put on him
[35:44] and when the word came by his way that
[35:48] predestinated soul
[35:50] moved him beyond the power of demons the
[35:53] power of demons had power to empower his
[35:55] flesh to break chains
[35:57] to to be unable to be captured to be
[36:00] unable to be a captive just lived
[36:02] amongst the tombs and and did all kinds
[36:05] of strange powerful acts but in the
[36:08] midst of all that that predestinated
[36:10] purpose on the inside brought that soul
[36:13] into a reality
[36:15] i was in a meeting in uganda a couple
[36:18] years back just before covet actually
[36:20] and uh and and it was a meeting of about
[36:23] 1500 people a large portion of
[36:25] unbelievers in the meeting and it was
[36:26] kind of in a in an area where a man with
[36:30] 800 people in his church a pentecostal
[36:32] man had come into the message actually i
[36:34] think he had a thousand but but the
[36:37] church had diminished down to about 400
[36:39] you know when the message comes in it
[36:40] drives away all the unbelievers right
[36:43] and so now he had a church about 400 and
[36:45] he wanted to have a meeting we had a
[36:46] meeting and it was kind of a strange
[36:48] meeting brother aaron it was it was just
[36:52] different in the i had to actually
[36:54] change translators because the first
[36:56] translator was a young man and it's the
[36:58] first time he translated for me and
[37:00] something wasn't going right and i i
[37:02] told brother fred chingy i said you know
[37:05] uh i need someone else to translate he's
[37:06] not doing it right and i can tell he's
[37:08] not doing it right
[37:10] and so he he so brother fred actually i
[37:13] think began to translate for by himself
[37:15] for me and so so we just began to
[37:18] minister and and and it just wasn't
[37:20] going exactly the way that i would
[37:22] normally preach and finally i just
[37:24] thought okay here we go and i just close
[37:26] my notes
[37:27] and i just begin to preach
[37:29] and i just begin to to just lay the word
[37:32] in as the holy spirit just begin to give
[37:34] utterance i didn't know it but there was
[37:37] a witch doctor in that service
[37:39] all right and he
[37:41] during that service
[37:42] he tried to conjure up his demon spirits
[37:46] this wasn't just a witch doctor this was
[37:48] a teacher of witch doctors
[37:50] so this guy was a guy who knew his stuff
[37:53] and and he was trying to conjure up the
[37:56] the power of the enemy and he was amazed
[37:59] because it wasn't working
[38:02] and he was like you know i've never had
[38:04] that happen before this is his testimony
[38:06] afterwards and he never had it happen
[38:08] before and and he just thought that was
[38:11] amazing so so that sir you know many
[38:13] souls came to christ there and and uh
[38:15] i'm not an evangelist you understand i'm
[38:17] i'm more of a teacher but god used the
[38:19] service in a mighty way and that and
[38:22] that man went from there and he was kind
[38:24] of confused about what had went on and
[38:26] he goes home and he finds out his
[38:28] witchcraft stops working
[38:31] it just stops working
[38:33] and he's amazed and the demons that he
[38:35] calls on will no longer answer him
[38:39] and he just won what is going on but his
[38:42] sister is a believer
[38:44] and so so finally through his sister he
[38:47] arranges to talk to brother fred and the
[38:50] man gets gloriously saved
[38:54] hallelujah you talk about a
[38:55] predestinated seed
[38:58] god knows what he's doing
[39:00] and that man got gloriously now it's not
[39:02] without a battle because those demons
[39:04] left him and went to his daughter
[39:08] young girl they had to cast the demons
[39:10] out of the daughter
[39:11] but god gave them strength to cast those
[39:13] demons out and the daughter was also
[39:15] delivered and saved but nevertheless in
[39:18] the midst of it all
[39:20] god came down and there was a seed
[39:22] laying there and it didn't matter about
[39:24] witchcraft
[39:26] it didn't matter about demon powers
[39:28] it didn't even matter that i knew what
[39:30] was going on
[39:32] it's just a matter of surrendering
[39:33] yourself to god and god through the
[39:36] power of the word broke and bound those
[39:39] demons and that man got delivered
[39:42] they even took him out and i've got the
[39:44] video of it they took him back to his
[39:46] village and dug up the amulets or
[39:48] whatever you call it of his witchcraft
[39:50] the different instruments of his
[39:51] witchcraft the different things that he
[39:53] uses doug he bat him buried in the
[39:55] ground they dug him up they burned them
[39:56] all
[39:57] he was done praise be to god
[40:01] we thank god for his delivering power
[40:02] he's still the same yesterday yesterday
[40:04] today and forever
[40:10] but the devil will put all kinds of
[40:12] things on you to try and get you to deny
[40:15] what he saw in you before the foundation
[40:18] of the world
[40:22] but it's that purpose that drives us
[40:25] and we may not even realize it
[40:29] you have a purpose in you
[40:31] and you can't get away from it
[40:34] do you realize that
[40:35] you just cannot get away from it if
[40:37] you're a son or daughter of god it's
[40:40] laying there and you will never escape
[40:42] it
[40:44] you might go this direction in your
[40:46] flesh you might go that direction in
[40:47] your mind but that purpose will never
[40:50] escape you god doesn't have plan b
[40:55] if he did moses would have never been
[40:57] the deliverer
[40:59] moses went out into the wilderness run
[41:01] away from his purpose in life the
[41:03] purpose for which he was called and
[41:04] anointed and especially
[41:06] all of that 40 years forgot everything
[41:08] he knew comes in total weakness to the
[41:10] pillar of fire in the burning bush and
[41:13] says i'm not able
[41:15] no you got the wrong guy
[41:16] like i can't talk i can't lead i forgot
[41:19] all my learning everything like that and
[41:21] god's brother abraham says god liked to
[41:23] have kicked him around a little bit
[41:25] he said but god says no i the cry of my
[41:27] people i've come down to deliver them
[41:30] and i'm sending you
[41:32] amen
[41:33] i hope this is speaking to somebody this
[41:35] morning
[41:37] brother braham says in the future homie
[41:39] says if you got eternal life there's
[41:40] only one form and that's god
[41:43] and you are an expressed attribute
[41:46] the holy ghost is eternal
[41:48] and then you are in eternity where you
[41:51] was all the time
[41:56] only there you were a thought
[41:58] now you're materialized
[42:00] all right he says but you just recognize
[42:03] what happened
[42:04] see you were made for an eternal purpose
[42:07] because you
[42:08] manifestation of an attribute that was
[42:11] in god
[42:17] you out of and to make you a human being
[42:21] and sin come along and perverted his way
[42:25] you come anyhow
[42:27] but you was lost with the world so he
[42:30] come and redeemed you
[42:32] the expressed attribute and he also
[42:35] redeems the earth by the same way
[42:39] then his purpose rolls on
[42:43] see it's his purpose he came to you
[42:46] i'd love to just stop right here i got a
[42:48] lot a lot of things on my plate today
[42:50] but i'd love just to stop right here
[42:53] he came by your way
[42:57] you might say i was raised in the
[42:58] message i i heard this message all my
[43:00] life that doesn't make any difference
[43:02] you can hear it all your life and still
[43:03] miss it
[43:05] but one day god comes to you
[43:08] and he makes it real to you
[43:10] individually
[43:12] and making it real to you then it's you
[43:14] and him
[43:15] and you can never get away from it and
[43:17] who is this melchizedek brother branham
[43:19] says
[43:22] i'll re-title it for you
[43:23] who is this logos
[43:28] who is this melchizedek
[43:30] right
[43:31] that's what the that's what the logos
[43:33] became materialized in abraham's day
[43:36] and the logos coming materialized 2000
[43:38] years ago was jesus christ
[43:40] all right he says being eternal with him
[43:43] at the beginning the eternal life that
[43:45] you had his thought of what you was he
[43:48] wanted me to stand in the pulpit now
[43:50] he's bringing it right down to the
[43:51] service
[43:52] he wanted you to sit in the seat tonight
[43:55] then we are serving his eternal purpose
[43:58] and the one
[44:00] i just feel something telling me he
[44:02] wanted you to sit in the seat tonight
[44:04] see the lord wants you to be back
[44:05] tonight
[44:06] all right it says then we are serving
[44:09] his eternal purpose
[44:10] and the one that left home only come to
[44:13] the earth to serve his purpose
[44:17] is that right all right then after it's
[44:19] finished it's brought back to a
[44:22] glorified state
[44:24] it's matured and brought back again
[44:28] all right now now we finally got to the
[44:30] place we need to be
[44:32] praise the lord
[44:34] it's your purpose that god responds to
[44:41] it's the eternal purpose that god is
[44:44] working out
[44:45] it's not your feelings
[44:47] it's not your complexes
[44:50] it's not your culture
[44:52] all right it's not your education
[44:55] these are all things in your mind in
[44:57] your spirit realm it's not the family
[45:00] you were raised in it's not the church
[45:02] you were raised in it's your purpose
[45:05] that he responds to
[45:08] and when you find the channel of your
[45:10] purpose
[45:11] that brings a response from god to you
[45:15] individually
[45:16] all right now i'll show you here this
[45:18] here because there was a woman by the
[45:19] name of hannah in the bible we know who
[45:22] hannah was she was the mother of samuel
[45:25] all right but hannah didn't have an easy
[45:28] life because she was barren
[45:30] and she desired to have
[45:33] a child
[45:34] but in a woman having a child how many
[45:36] women here have a child
[45:39] right now in a woman having a child
[45:41] there's three levels of desire there
[45:43] all right number one is the flesh desire
[45:46] there's the natural hormonal desire of a
[45:50] woman to be a mother
[45:52] it's as these little girls here grow up
[45:55] they'll begin to feel it and not maybe
[45:57] understand what their bodies are going
[45:59] through and different things and and not
[46:01] understand why they feel the way they
[46:03] feel it's a natural preparation for
[46:06] motherhood
[46:07] right and so here was hannah she was
[46:10] married there was a natural desire to
[46:12] have a have a child she had a husband
[46:14] she wanted the natural things of life
[46:16] she wanted her own children maybe maybe
[46:18] a flesh desire to hold a baby any any of
[46:21] you
[46:22] are there any babies here
[46:24] i think there was one over here
[46:26] all right and uh you know that the baby
[46:30] started
[46:31] fussing just as i was sitting standing
[46:33] behind you just before the service and
[46:35] just started i think he started coughing
[46:37] a little bit
[46:38] now
[46:39] now
[46:40] there was nothing in me
[46:42] that said i got to hold that baby
[46:48] sorry
[46:50] it just wasn't in me
[46:52] it's i'm thinking
[46:54] take care of your baby mother
[46:57] that's a man
[46:58] i'm not being
[46:59] ignorant about it i'm just saying that's
[47:01] a man
[47:02] but
[47:04] maybe sister
[47:05] melissa back there who hasn't even had
[47:07] children yet
[47:09] amen
[47:10] maybe sister lori back there stan
[47:12] standing back there watching the child
[47:14] fuss a little bit maybe there's
[47:15] something in the motherhood there just
[47:17] saying oh i should just hold that child
[47:21] right maybe i'll just comfort that child
[47:23] a little bit that's the difference right
[47:25] that there's a natural makeup of a woman
[47:27] to hold a child
[47:29] and you sisters know that you see a
[47:31] little baby maybe in a in a little
[47:33] carriage or one of the sisters in the
[47:35] church have a new baby and all the
[47:37] sisters want to hold the baby
[47:39] is that right
[47:40] now none of you brothers are going up
[47:42] saying let me hold the baby
[47:46] hope not anyway
[47:48] maybe maybe some of you aren't being but
[47:50] you know that's all right to hold the
[47:52] baby if you're a man i'm not saying that
[47:53] but i just say there's something in the
[47:55] sisters
[47:56] it's a natural reaction to a child but
[47:59] it it goes beyond that now for a woman
[48:02] and i'll just say
[48:04] hannah had not just the natural desire
[48:06] but now she also had
[48:08] something arranged by god called a trial
[48:12] and the trial was called panina
[48:15] which was the second wife of her husband
[48:18] and banana had no problem having
[48:21] children
[48:22] she had several of them
[48:25] and her husband hannah's husband loved
[48:28] her what was his name elkanah or
[48:29] something like that
[48:30] uh i can't remember his name i probably
[48:32] got it here somewhere but anyway yeah
[48:34] okay
[48:35] and and he couldn't understand what was
[48:37] going on between the two women but every
[48:39] time panina
[48:41] said to hannah you know how god has
[48:44] blessed me with children
[48:47] just aided hannah
[48:49] not in her flesh now but in her mind
[48:53] i'm inferior
[48:55] because i can't have a child
[48:57] i'm less than what a woman ought to be
[49:00] ah you know sometimes it happens in
[49:03] young women
[49:05] before they're married
[49:08] i'll never get married
[49:11] there's a little few snakes i have
[49:13] daughters
[49:15] i know what that term is
[49:17] and they they feel like i'm less than
[49:20] really i ought to be because nobody's
[49:22] interested in me
[49:24] i'm sorry this is a sensitive area
[49:27] but that's only in the spirit realm
[49:30] that's the mind that's the complexes
[49:32] that's the culture that's the that's the
[49:34] different things that work on us and the
[49:36] devil likes to anoint those things
[49:38] because those things are real but that's
[49:40] not what god responds to
[49:43] and you sisters i don't even know who's
[49:45] single here i'm sorry i'm sorry sister
[49:47] melissa i know you're single but i'm not
[49:49] preaching at you
[49:51] all right
[49:52] but uh to to the sisters that are single
[49:55] i assume these ones are single i mean
[49:57] you know
[49:58] but uh
[50:00] you know there's there's
[50:01] you've got to go beyond that
[50:04] you've got to get beyond the complex of
[50:07] singlehood
[50:08] you've got to get beyond the idea of woe
[50:11] is me or i'm less than what ought to be
[50:13] no you're not less than what you ought
[50:15] to be you have an eternal purpose in the
[50:17] thoughts of god
[50:19] and that eternal purpose does not rest
[50:21] in your mind or your spirit it does not
[50:24] rest in your flesh
[50:25] and this world will try and tell a woman
[50:27] it does rest in her flesh it does not
[50:30] rest in your flesh the purpose of god
[50:32] lays within the soul
[50:34] all right and so you know el elkanah was
[50:37] like a typical husband excuse me for
[50:39] belaboring the point here but he was
[50:41] like a typical husband say says to
[50:43] hannah why are you crying
[50:45] he says what the bible says why weepest
[50:47] thou
[50:49] why don't you eat he says why eat as
[50:51] thou not
[50:52] why is your heart grieved he see he's
[50:55] the typical man he's trying to fix the
[50:57] problem
[50:59] he says am i not better than you than to
[51:01] you than ten sons
[51:04] right he's trying to get her mind off of
[51:06] that and onto something else
[51:08] i love you
[51:10] you're my favorite wife
[51:12] you're my favorite one i love you so
[51:14] much you mean all the world to me and no
[51:16] matter what he could say he could never
[51:18] stop her yearning because the yearning
[51:20] wasn't just in her flesh
[51:22] it wasn't just in her spirit there was
[51:24] something in her soul that god was
[51:26] working on
[51:28] and that yearning would not stop it was
[51:30] a deep calling that had to have a deep
[51:32] to respond
[51:34] hallelujah and so there's many times
[51:37] that that we maybe say something to
[51:39] comfort somebody that maybe we don't
[51:41] even have the answer and maybe they
[51:43] don't know the answer she just knew it
[51:45] as i need a child but that wasn't all
[51:47] the story because there was something in
[51:49] the mind of god before the foundation of
[51:51] the world there was a man called a
[51:53] samuel
[51:55] and that man was going to be a prophet
[51:57] to that age a word prophet that was
[52:00] going to establish the law in israel
[52:02] that moses had preached and he was going
[52:04] to lay the word out but god had chosen a
[52:07] particular vessel and that particular
[52:10] vessel had to come to the place in her
[52:12] life where she got a revelation lord if
[52:15] you give me a son i'll give him back to
[52:18] you
[52:20] that's what god was waiting for
[52:22] you see she had to get the revelation of
[52:26] why she was yearning she didn't know it
[52:28] was the answer she just finally came in
[52:30] exasperation and desperation and said
[52:33] lord if you give me a son i'll give him
[52:35] back to you i'll wean him and then he's
[52:37] all yours just give me a son and god
[52:39] said you said the right thing
[52:42] see it's the principle of the spoken
[52:44] word you said the right thing
[52:46] it's a predestinated seed laying within
[52:49] there where there was a hatty right that
[52:51] was in a room with a prophet of god that
[52:53] heard the word she'd been through many
[52:55] things but she had a soul desire
[52:59] hallelujah she had a soul desire and one
[53:02] day the word came and she said that's
[53:04] nothing but the truth
[53:06] i believe those squirrels were spoken
[53:08] that's nothing but the truth
[53:10] and that presence of god came down and
[53:12] says give her whatever she wants
[53:14] because he knew she was in the channel
[53:17] of her sole desire
[53:20] and she said
[53:22] i don't know what to ask for
[53:24] that's always what it comes down to
[53:25] we'll deal with that tonight
[53:27] i i i don't know what to say
[53:30] and so he finally
[53:32] says well your your sister's was it her
[53:34] sister or her niece or
[53:36] your is sick here in the wheelchair
[53:39] sister ask for her
[53:41] says you're poor ask for a million
[53:43] dollars see if it doesn't appear on the
[53:44] table right now
[53:46] soul desire
[53:50] she says i i want my two boys to be
[53:52] saved
[53:54] hallelujah and the presence of god came
[53:56] down and smote those boys
[53:59] i'll tell you what
[54:01] a soul desire
[54:03] the answer to your soul desire only lays
[54:07] in the word of god
[54:11] brother brown says in leading of the
[54:12] spirit he says have faith in god believe
[54:14] him with all your heart and you can
[54:17] receive what you asked for
[54:18] it's your faith that does it not me
[54:21] it's the lovely one who's here tonight
[54:23] the one that i spoke of that set with
[54:25] unwashed feet he loves you so much don't
[54:28] turn him away
[54:29] accept him in your heart
[54:32] and he says oh what a sin it would be
[54:34] for you to go away from here tonight
[54:36] disbelieving after he's come from glory
[54:39] to do these things
[54:42] amen
[54:43] before
[54:45] hannah could receive the answer
[54:47] she had to know what the question was
[54:52] the question wasn't just let me hold the
[54:53] baby
[54:55] the question was give me a son i'll give
[54:57] him back to you
[54:58] and god came down and and met that
[55:01] request
[55:02] the word becomes flesh
[55:05] the word became flesh
[55:07] to hannah the word
[55:10] christ became flesh 2 000 years ago the
[55:13] word
[55:14] christ the logos is revealed in our day
[55:19] the message is not something
[55:21] supplemental to god's plan the message
[55:25] is god's plan
[55:28] it's it's instrumental in what god is
[55:31] doing
[55:32] it's not peripheral
[55:34] on the extremities
[55:36] it's the center of it
[55:38] it's the mystery of god the part that's
[55:40] reserved for those that he loves you'll
[55:43] notice that about hannah it was written
[55:45] that she was in bitterness of soul
[55:48] that was the reality of the situation
[55:50] sometimes we think it's our mind
[55:52] sometimes we think it's our flag but she
[55:53] was in bitterness of soul and it was
[55:56] then that she wept and asked god if you
[55:58] give me a son i'll give him back to you
[56:01] and she was satisfied in her soul you
[56:03] see when david says lord unto thee do i
[56:06] lift up my soul
[56:08] he's speaking of something he says i'm
[56:10] not lifting up my flesh i'm not lifting
[56:12] up my spirit but lord i lift up my soul
[56:14] and then he says let me not be ashamed
[56:17] he's speaking about something because
[56:19] it's actually in the very same chapter
[56:20] and i think it's verse 7 where he says
[56:22] lord remember not the sins of my youth
[56:26] he's not talking about that kind of
[56:28] shame
[56:29] you see that we make mistakes in our
[56:31] flesh we are ashamed
[56:33] we make mistakes in our spirit our minds
[56:35] or because of our minds and we look at
[56:37] things the wrong way and we're ashamed
[56:40] but that's not what david says david
[56:42] says i'm lifting up my soul
[56:44] let the purpose of my life not be
[56:47] ashamed
[56:49] let not mine enemies triumph over me in
[56:52] other words let my soul come to the
[56:55] purpose that you called me too
[56:58] that's why the grace of god is here
[57:00] because we do things in the flesh we're
[57:02] ashamed of
[57:04] come on
[57:05] we've all done it david said remember
[57:07] not the sins of my youth we do things we
[57:09] think things we think things about one
[57:11] another we ought not to
[57:14] i'll i'll turn this direction while i'm
[57:16] preaching this part
[57:17] we we say things about each other we
[57:20] ought not to think those things we we
[57:22] ought not to think about that about
[57:24] somebody else you know that's one of the
[57:25] reasons that i hate social media
[57:28] is because it shows people in a state
[57:33] that is there
[57:34] they ought not to be in that kind of
[57:36] condition
[57:38] it shows sons and daughters of god even
[57:40] sons and daughters of believers that
[57:43] maybe go out into the world and live a
[57:45] life that they ought not to live but
[57:47] they're going to be there
[57:50] but right now they're in a condition of
[57:52] unbelief or they're in a condition of
[57:54] running from the lord and because of
[57:56] that they blasted all over facebook and
[57:59] i don't want to look at somebody that's
[58:01] where they where they ought not to be
[58:04] i'd rather think the thoughts of god
[58:06] that's a son or a daughter of god and
[58:09] they're predestinated before the
[58:10] foundation of the world and i don't care
[58:12] where they are today they're going to be
[58:16] if you knew where i came from you
[58:18] wouldn't believe that i would be here
[58:21] if they had facebook in my day when i
[58:24] was a teenager you'd say there's no hope
[58:26] for him
[58:28] but god didn't say that facebook is not
[58:31] the thoughts of god
[58:34] instagram is not the thoughts of god
[58:37] is there anyone else i gotta hit
[58:40] yeah i don't know the names of them all
[58:42] again
[58:42] i don't have them so you know it's like
[58:44] those are the two big i don't know
[58:46] twitter or whatever
[58:49] the point is that that that's not what's
[58:51] real
[58:52] what's real is what's in the thoughts of
[58:53] god
[58:55] amen there was a woman that came into a
[58:56] feast where jesus was at right and she
[58:59] saw that jesus was sitting there with
[59:01] unwashed feet
[59:03] and brother branham dwells on that jesus
[59:05] with dirty feet
[59:06] they ought to have washed his feet
[59:09] but jesus was unconcerned
[59:12] because he knew there was someone there
[59:14] that was going to wash his feet
[59:17] someone there whose purpose it was
[59:19] to wash his feet
[59:22] because jesus knew all things
[59:25] whatever the father showed him he knew
[59:26] it and he's sitting there with unwashed
[59:28] feet no doubt god had revealed to him
[59:31] the god in him revealed to him
[59:34] that you know
[59:36] just sit still
[59:37] she come by she snuck in a woman of ill
[59:40] fame
[59:41] that they all looked at her on face i
[59:43] mean sorry all looked at her
[59:47] and said if he knew who she really was
[59:50] but he knew who she really was
[59:54] and they didn't know what she really was
[59:57] because the flesh and the spirit were in
[1:00:00] bad condition
[1:00:01] but inside of the inside there was a
[1:00:04] predestinated purpose
[1:00:06] hallelujah and god had arranged the
[1:00:09] circumstances just for her
[1:00:13] and now there's the word
[1:00:15] and she said
[1:00:16] you know what i've had it with life
[1:00:19] i don't care what anybody thinks of me
[1:00:21] anymore
[1:00:22] i'm gonna go
[1:00:23] and i'm gonna wash his feet
[1:00:26] and she begins to wash his feet with her
[1:00:28] tears and begin to wipe them with the
[1:00:30] hairs of her head and jesus
[1:00:34] brother brown said he didn't even twitch
[1:00:36] he didn't move a muscle lest he scare
[1:00:38] her
[1:00:40] if he move her foot if he move his foot
[1:00:42] she might think he's trying to pull back
[1:00:44] and and you know
[1:00:45] my might be or sir but he was so careful
[1:00:49] yeah he was so careful for her listen
[1:00:55] aren't you glad god's careful of your
[1:00:57] complexes
[1:00:59] aren't you glad that he's careful about
[1:01:01] your feelings
[1:01:03] sometimes as ministers we fail
[1:01:06] we're not careful enough about people's
[1:01:08] feelings
[1:01:10] we're not careful enough i'll tell you
[1:01:11] what when i when i get up and preach
[1:01:14] i think i have it here you know i'm
[1:01:16] always careful to know who i'm preaching
[1:01:18] to
[1:01:21] i'll maybe move to that
[1:01:24] am i preaching
[1:01:27] am i one of the angels going down to
[1:01:29] sodom and preaching
[1:01:31] or i am am i part of the one that
[1:01:33] preached to abraham
[1:01:37] those two different types of sermons
[1:01:41] am i am i jonah that's crying out in the
[1:01:44] streets of nineveh repent or perish
[1:01:48] or am i
[1:01:49] moving on beyond that
[1:01:51] you know jonah
[1:01:55] let me let me read it to you the way
[1:01:56] brother brown is this okay so far
[1:01:58] all right can i take a little while
[1:01:59] longer
[1:02:01] all right 10 more minutes we'll say 10
[1:02:02] more minutes all right
[1:02:04] give me your hand for 10 more minutes
[1:02:05] all right
[1:02:09] okay about 300 minutes okay
[1:02:12] all right
[1:02:18] now even as preachers i know what it is
[1:02:21] to preach to pentecostals
[1:02:24] done it a lot in uganda because there's
[1:02:26] a lot of them coming into the message
[1:02:28] it's a different kind of preaching
[1:02:31] and i know
[1:02:32] and i realized that
[1:02:34] in the service this morning and many
[1:02:36] times
[1:02:38] when i preach i'm preaching to the bride
[1:02:41] of jesus christ
[1:02:43] the beloved of the lord
[1:02:46] you are the ones that he loves
[1:02:49] and i try as a minister maybe sometimes
[1:02:52] i fail but i try
[1:02:54] to be very
[1:02:56] very respectful
[1:02:58] of who you are in his sight amen
[1:03:03] i'm not here to tell you you're nothing
[1:03:05] i'm here to tell you your everything
[1:03:08] amen
[1:03:09] to him your everything
[1:03:12] he gave everything he had for you
[1:03:15] he laid it all down
[1:03:18] yes then you might have life
[1:03:22] he laid it all down
[1:03:24] that i could live eternally
[1:03:27] i was lost
[1:03:28] and he laid it down for me he shed his
[1:03:31] own blood for me he paid the price that
[1:03:33] nobody else could pay and by paying that
[1:03:36] price he could open the seals he was the
[1:03:38] one that's worthy and because of him i
[1:03:41] stand here tonight and because of him
[1:03:42] you're here tonight and he loves you
[1:03:44] more than anything that's why paul said
[1:03:47] i'm persuaded nothing can separate us
[1:03:48] from that love but god for his great
[1:03:51] love wherewith he loved us all of those
[1:03:53] stories brother branham says
[1:03:57] you know
[1:03:59] as it
[1:04:02] he says in one place no matter how much
[1:04:04] i would pray for you being a sinner
[1:04:07] my prayers might not help or my prayers
[1:04:10] might help you i'm sorry and my
[1:04:12] persuasion might help you
[1:04:15] but i couldn't forgive one sin of yours
[1:04:18] god's already done that
[1:04:21] you have to accept it in christ
[1:04:23] when jesus died he saved everybody as
[1:04:26] far as god was concerned for he paid the
[1:04:28] full price of human redemption
[1:04:31] now don't think that i'm a universalist
[1:04:32] that believes everybody will be saved
[1:04:35] everybody's saved and will be i do not
[1:04:37] sir i believe that everybody was saved
[1:04:39] as far as god was concerned for jesus
[1:04:41] paid the full penalty of sin when he
[1:04:43] died now it will never do you no good
[1:04:46] until you accept it
[1:04:48] see you have to accept it and it's not
[1:04:50] how hard you cry how much you beg how
[1:04:52] much you persuade it's a surrendered
[1:04:54] heart to god with faith believing he's
[1:04:57] done it
[1:04:58] it says even our altar calls that we
[1:05:00] have in bringing people up around the
[1:05:01] altar they didn't do that in the bible
[1:05:03] time that's a tradition of our people
[1:05:06] formerly in the methodist church but
[1:05:08] look it's a good thing i don't like this
[1:05:10] dry eyed repentance i like to see
[1:05:12] somebody get up and really be sorry for
[1:05:13] what they've done and really mean it but
[1:05:17] be forgiven until you believe you're
[1:05:19] forgiven
[1:05:22] then you confess that you are and then
[1:05:24] you live like you are
[1:05:26] he says no one will still know no matter
[1:05:29] how much you cry how much you pray how
[1:05:30] much you shout how many times you speak
[1:05:32] in tongues whatever you do you're still
[1:05:34] not until the fruits of the spirit bear
[1:05:37] record in you in other words the life
[1:05:40] has to come into you to live a life out
[1:05:42] of you
[1:05:43] and god sends his spirit upon you when
[1:05:47] he recognizes your faith your faith that
[1:05:50] you were already saved at calvary
[1:05:54] so it's a justification
[1:05:56] by faith and now we realize that brother
[1:05:58] branham said in some places
[1:06:01] he says
[1:06:02] the the message is always repent or
[1:06:04] perish
[1:06:05] he takes it from jonah
[1:06:07] jonah crying out in the streets of
[1:06:08] nineveh he says always repent or perish
[1:06:11] but you know paul takes repentance and
[1:06:13] he says in ephesians or in hebrews
[1:06:15] rather chapter six therefore leaving the
[1:06:17] principles of the doctrine of christ
[1:06:19] what's the principles baptism repentance
[1:06:23] surrender faith justification by faith
[1:06:25] believing in the atonement all of those
[1:06:26] things therefore leaving the principles
[1:06:28] of the doctrine of christ let us go on
[1:06:31] unto perfection
[1:06:33] not laying again the foundation of
[1:06:35] repentance from dead works and of faith
[1:06:37] towards god of the doctrine of baptism
[1:06:39] laying on hands resurrection of the dead
[1:06:41] and of eternal judgment so he's saying
[1:06:43] now let us go on unto perfection
[1:06:48] what is that
[1:06:51] that actually is the word integrity in
[1:06:54] the old testament
[1:06:56] so when david cries out
[1:06:58] let integrity and uprightness preserve
[1:07:02] me
[1:07:03] he's actually making a statement that
[1:07:04] most people don't understand because
[1:07:07] the english word integrity has taken on
[1:07:10] a different meaning
[1:07:12] and integrity as we view it now is
[1:07:15] largely a facet of character
[1:07:18] you know that's that person has good
[1:07:20] integrity
[1:07:21] you know it's like faithful or or you
[1:07:24] know they're they're a good person or
[1:07:26] something like that but that's not what
[1:07:28] the word meant when david used it
[1:07:30] the word integrity actually means
[1:07:34] the fundamental idea of it is an idea of
[1:07:37] completeness
[1:07:39] and so that's the word that paul is
[1:07:40] using in hebrews there's two words for
[1:07:43] perfection one means without error and
[1:07:45] one we one means
[1:07:47] uh
[1:07:48] complete or whole
[1:07:50] and that's the word paul is using here
[1:07:52] in hebrews 6 when he says let us go on
[1:07:53] into perfection or let us go on unto the
[1:07:56] whole matter
[1:07:57] or the whole life or the life of
[1:08:00] completion or maturity
[1:08:03] and so all of those words are
[1:08:05] instructive as we look at this now as we
[1:08:07] bring this to a close this morning
[1:08:09] and and the word integrity
[1:08:12] actually you is used by samuel of jesse
[1:08:16] just to give you an idea of what i'm
[1:08:17] talking about
[1:08:18] when samuel is instructed of god to go
[1:08:20] into jesse's house all right and he sees
[1:08:23] like here this morning six boys one two
[1:08:26] three four five six
[1:08:28] he comes to the first one
[1:08:29] says oh this is surely the king he's the
[1:08:32] great stature go ahead stand up
[1:08:35] and he's great stature and he's a mighty
[1:08:37] man of valor and oh you know he's got to
[1:08:40] be the king and god says don't anoint
[1:08:42] him he's not the one sit down
[1:08:47] and he goes to the next one go ahead
[1:08:49] stand up he says oh
[1:08:50] look at this guy he's really got it
[1:08:52] together and he's got a surely he's the
[1:08:55] king no that's not him sorry sit down
[1:08:58] this one skipped out
[1:09:00] stand up
[1:09:02] number four
[1:09:03] wow this guy's head and shoulders above
[1:09:05] the rest he's surely the guy you know
[1:09:07] he's the one don't feel bad i'm head and
[1:09:08] shoulders above the rest too
[1:09:10] and so he's the one no don't sit down
[1:09:12] yet see you're already thinking of
[1:09:13] yourself too little
[1:09:16] and and and
[1:09:17] he's thinking well the first three got
[1:09:19] rejected the odds are i'm the one
[1:09:23] no sorry
[1:09:24] have a seat
[1:09:25] number six number five
[1:09:28] is this the one no sorry
[1:09:30] number six this is the last one that's
[1:09:32] here this has got to be the one let's
[1:09:34] get the cruise of oil and let's anoint
[1:09:36] them with the blackberry all right
[1:09:40] he's not the one i know you don't
[1:09:41] understand
[1:09:43] have a seat
[1:09:44] here comes number three now
[1:09:48] and he's thinking
[1:09:50] i know god said to come here he's here
[1:09:52] present
[1:09:53] speaking to me
[1:09:55] he didn't choose any of these six
[1:09:58] and he says to jesse he says
[1:10:01] is this your whole family
[1:10:04] is this the in other words is this the
[1:10:06] completeness of it
[1:10:07] is everybody present
[1:10:10] and so and and jesse says no
[1:10:13] he says there's one more
[1:10:17] hallelujah
[1:10:21] the first stage was good
[1:10:23] the second age was good
[1:10:26] the third age was good the fourth age
[1:10:28] luther raising up that was good
[1:10:31] what a mighty man of valor
[1:10:35] the fifth age i guess was luther the six
[1:10:37] h was wesley what a mighty man of god
[1:10:41] what's your name
[1:10:42] ian but wesley age was the six age
[1:10:46] and then it's like is that everybody
[1:10:48] no there's still more to come
[1:10:51] that's not the whole of it without us
[1:10:53] they cannot be made
[1:10:55] perfect
[1:10:57] or complete
[1:10:59] and without david jesse's family was not
[1:11:02] complete
[1:11:04] as far as jesse was concerned
[1:11:07] you might even say he was an
[1:11:08] afterthought
[1:11:10] you might even say david was one of
[1:11:12] those unexpected babies
[1:11:15] see what i'm saying but that's not in
[1:11:17] god's thoughts
[1:11:18] in god's thoughts he was the one
[1:11:21] you see in other words god's thoughts
[1:11:24] were not complete without david
[1:11:29] all right now let's go a little bit
[1:11:30] further in this thought before we close
[1:11:32] here we're coming down to the close
[1:11:35] the word
[1:11:36] uh integrity also means is also the word
[1:11:39] used for without blemish
[1:11:43] and that it it
[1:11:45] and and the word without blemish is not
[1:11:47] always what we think it is
[1:11:49] and i'm sorry i just have to stir your
[1:11:51] minds up a little bit because you're all
[1:11:52] thinking where is he going this morning
[1:11:55] but
[1:11:55] it's it's something the with the lamb
[1:11:58] without blemish didn't just mean it
[1:12:01] didn't have any scars
[1:12:03] it also meant it was whole
[1:12:07] it wasn't missing anything
[1:12:10] that everything required to make it a
[1:12:13] perfect lamb was there
[1:12:16] and that speaks of the sacrifice of
[1:12:18] jesus christ you can read about it in
[1:12:20] leviticus 22 in first peter chapter one
[1:12:22] as he says but the pr first peter
[1:12:24] chapter one says but the precious blood
[1:12:26] of christ as of a lamb without blemish
[1:12:29] and without spot
[1:12:31] sometimes we think the word without
[1:12:33] blemish means without spot without
[1:12:35] blemish means the completeness of it the
[1:12:37] entirety of it in other words jesus was
[1:12:40] not just without mistake or without sin
[1:12:44] but he was also everything that was
[1:12:47] required in the sacrifice he fulfilled
[1:12:51] the entirety of it
[1:12:53] he was the fullness of the measure of a
[1:12:56] sacrifice that had to be made for you
[1:12:59] and i as the songwriter said living he
[1:13:01] loved me dying he saved me
[1:13:04] buried he carried my sins far away but
[1:13:07] there's one more step rising he
[1:13:10] justified in other words jesus rising
[1:13:13] from the dead showed that the sacrifice
[1:13:16] was accepted
[1:13:18] because many men died on the cross
[1:13:20] many men gave their blood many men went
[1:13:23] to hell but one man rose from the dead
[1:13:26] that was our lord jesus christ showing
[1:13:28] that he was the sacrifice without
[1:13:31] blemish he was the entirety of it as
[1:13:33] paul says one sacrifice for all
[1:13:35] everything that you ever did in the past
[1:13:38] every mistake you make today and
[1:13:40] everything that you will do in the
[1:13:41] future he's the entirety of it do you
[1:13:44] believe that this morning then if he's
[1:13:46] the entirety of it this morning then no
[1:13:48] matter what you do in your life the
[1:13:50] price is already paid
[1:13:54] it's not the sacrifice and your
[1:13:56] repentance
[1:13:58] it's not the sacrifice and your good
[1:14:00] works it's not the sacrifice and your
[1:14:03] efforts it's not the sacrifice and your
[1:14:06] revelation or and your understanding or
[1:14:08] anything like that no jesus paid the
[1:14:10] price for all if you can understand that
[1:14:13] that's why he was slain in the mind of
[1:14:15] god before the foundation of the world
[1:14:17] the price was already paid there's
[1:14:19] nothing that you can do in addition to
[1:14:21] that that will pay any iota of price all
[1:14:24] you have to believe is in the finished
[1:14:26] sacrifice
[1:14:28] hallelujah
[1:14:30] it's not of you it's not of me it's
[1:14:32] entirely of him
[1:14:34] yes it brings us to repentance yes it
[1:14:37] causes us to feel grief because of the
[1:14:39] mistakes that we make every day even as
[1:14:41] believers
[1:14:44] amen
[1:14:46] but here's the entire sacrifice he knew
[1:14:49] the mistakes and sins i made yesterday
[1:14:52] and he knows
[1:14:53] i'll say it the way brother braham says
[1:14:55] it he knows you're just a man or a woman
[1:14:58] and you're going to make mistakes
[1:15:01] but you mustn't look at your mistakes
[1:15:04] it's your heart towards him
[1:15:09] i'm sorry it just takes all of the fear
[1:15:11] out of the gospel
[1:15:13] because i don't believe that his bride
[1:15:14] is to live by fear
[1:15:16] i believe his bride is to walk by the
[1:15:19] revelation of the love that he has for
[1:15:21] her
[1:15:22] and that's what this message is it's a
[1:15:24] love letter it's the final love union
[1:15:27] between the heavenly bridegroom and the
[1:15:29] earthly bride
[1:15:30] it's it's not just a message of
[1:15:32] repentance yes when we believe we repent
[1:15:34] i believe repent baptize in the name of
[1:15:36] jesus christ you shall receive the gift
[1:15:38] of the holy ghost i believe in all of
[1:15:40] that and that's the foundation but then
[1:15:41] paul says let us go unto perfection
[1:15:44] let's let us go on unto the entirety of
[1:15:47] it
[1:15:48] let's go on into the fullness of what
[1:15:51] god has for us
[1:15:54] god is faithful
[1:15:55] to the integrity
[1:15:57] of his word
[1:16:02] heavens and earth will pass away
[1:16:05] but this word will never pass away
[1:16:08] god is faithful to it
[1:16:11] if you believe this word if you hang on
[1:16:13] to this word he'll be faithful to you
[1:16:20] but to be made whole
[1:16:22] is the word integrity
[1:16:24] many times in the scripture it's about
[1:16:25] healing i know we're about done here but
[1:16:27] excuse me if i just got to take another
[1:16:29] step
[1:16:32] to be made whole in the body the woman
[1:16:34] with the blood issue was made whole
[1:16:37] all right
[1:16:38] that's the same word to be made whole
[1:16:40] but though you're made whole in your
[1:16:42] body
[1:16:43] that integrity will fail
[1:16:47] you'll get sick again
[1:16:49] all right that's just the reality of the
[1:16:51] body divine healing is not permanent
[1:16:54] it's not like salvation
[1:16:57] all right
[1:16:59] there's there are things in our minds
[1:17:02] when actually when you're born again you
[1:17:04] receive a new mind or will say a renewed
[1:17:06] mind
[1:17:08] it looses you from your complexes it
[1:17:10] looses you from your fear but don't
[1:17:12] think the devil will never try and put a
[1:17:13] calm another complex on you i i i
[1:17:17] appreciate i have a good friend in
[1:17:18] uganda brother steven o'bally
[1:17:20] wonderful brother and and uh been a real
[1:17:23] friend over the years known him since
[1:17:25] the 80s and the lord's really using him
[1:17:28] there but he said something to me
[1:17:29] someday that just actually broke a
[1:17:31] complex that i had he said you know i
[1:17:34] decided one day
[1:17:36] that it was a waste of time to be
[1:17:38] nervous
[1:17:42] i was like why didn't i think of that
[1:17:48] but you know since that time every time
[1:17:50] i get nervous i'm thinking what good is
[1:17:52] this going to do me
[1:17:54] i'm nervous when i get to the pulpit i'm
[1:17:56] nervous when i'm preaching in a new
[1:17:57] place i'm nervous about all those things
[1:17:58] and then it's like well i'm going to do
[1:18:00] it anyway
[1:18:02] so no sense of being nervous about it
[1:18:04] it's just going to hit me amen brother
[1:18:06] aaron yeah
[1:18:07] i guess i'm preaching brother aaron this
[1:18:09] morning you know we all get nervous in
[1:18:11] different things in life but
[1:18:13] if god's in it if god be for us who can
[1:18:15] be against us
[1:18:17] there's things in our minds that you
[1:18:18] know god will deliver us one time and it
[1:18:21] tries to come back on us again that's
[1:18:23] just the battle of the mind that's where
[1:18:24] the battleground is
[1:18:27] how many are in a battle
[1:18:29] we're all in a battle how many know the
[1:18:31] battle is in your mind
[1:18:33] all right that's where the battleground
[1:18:35] is it's god versus satan we thank god i
[1:18:37] think brother aaron said right at the
[1:18:38] beginning of the service there's
[1:18:39] something within the soul that comes on
[1:18:41] the scene to conquer all things the
[1:18:44] power of the word that lays within the
[1:18:45] believer
[1:18:46] but god has and this is what i'm coming
[1:18:48] to now before we close
[1:18:52] god's most important things almost
[1:18:54] said that three times
[1:19:00] god
[1:19:01] values and will maintain
[1:19:03] the integrity of the
[1:19:06] word you see and it's actually the word
[1:19:09] purpose in your soul
[1:19:11] that cannot be broken
[1:19:13] and when david says i lift up my soul
[1:19:16] and let integrity preserve me
[1:19:19] he's actually saying
[1:19:21] lord let the purpose that you put in my
[1:19:24] life never be broken
[1:19:26] i may fail you
[1:19:28] and i'm sorry for it and david did fail
[1:19:30] god many times
[1:19:32] you know i may fall short i may not
[1:19:34] understand how it all works but lord i
[1:19:36] lift unto you my soul i give you my soul
[1:19:39] i give you who i am
[1:19:42] let it be what you want it to be
[1:19:44] i didn't select myself when my brothers
[1:19:47] were all sitting there and the seventh i
[1:19:50] came in as the seventh and i got
[1:19:52] anointed with oil i didn't ask to be
[1:19:54] anointed above shama i didn't ask to be
[1:19:56] anointed above the other ones all i know
[1:19:59] is i just came in from the field because
[1:20:00] the prophet was there and lo and behold
[1:20:02] he anointed me to be king lord you chose
[1:20:04] me i didn't choose you
[1:20:06] lord you sent this message by my way i
[1:20:08] didn't find the message lord you sent a
[1:20:11] prophet i wasn't asking for a prophet
[1:20:14] lord you revealed the word to me i
[1:20:15] didn't go to a theological school to
[1:20:17] understand this word you revealed it to
[1:20:20] me so lord let integrity preserve me let
[1:20:23] the integrity or the eternal purpose of
[1:20:26] the word of god keep me day by day
[1:20:29] because revelation 10 is the integrity
[1:20:33] of the redemptive purpose of god the
[1:20:35] lamb must come forth to claim those that
[1:20:38] are predestinated to eternal life he's
[1:20:42] maintaining the integrity of the purpose
[1:20:44] of god and the integrity of the message
[1:20:47] will preserve you it's the completeness
[1:20:50] of it of the progressive revelation of
[1:20:52] the word of god that has come down to
[1:20:54] this last days and it must keep every
[1:20:57] son and daughter of god that's why god
[1:20:59] attaches you to the revelation of the
[1:21:01] word in this hour
[1:21:03] matches you to it because that sin is
[1:21:05] his wholeness that's his integrity
[1:21:08] that's his entire purpose being revealed
[1:21:11] and you're a part of it because you're
[1:21:13] predestinated a part of it to this day
[1:21:16] and see god will is always faithful to
[1:21:19] the integrity of his word
[1:21:21] and those who fail that
[1:21:23] god will deal with
[1:21:26] remember god said how shall i get the
[1:21:28] words of elijah to be fulfilled
[1:21:31] in the days of ahab
[1:21:33] elijah's gone
[1:21:35] but now micaiah is on the scene
[1:21:37] how will i get the words to be fulfilled
[1:21:39] god even used a lying spirit to go down
[1:21:41] into the mouths of prophet to send ahab
[1:21:43] out to the battle
[1:21:45] that the prophecy of elijah would be
[1:21:47] fulfilled
[1:21:48] why god was maintaining the integrity of
[1:21:51] the word
[1:21:53] see there's times when those that did
[1:21:55] not maintain the integrity they paid the
[1:21:58] price moses smote the rock the second
[1:22:01] time
[1:22:02] instead of speaking to the rock he broke
[1:22:04] the integrity of the word
[1:22:07] and god said all right moses because
[1:22:08] you've done that now you won't go into
[1:22:11] the promised land you'll see it but you
[1:22:13] won't go in brother branham had to pay
[1:22:15] the price a couple times in his own life
[1:22:17] one time in south africa when he
[1:22:18] disobeyed the vision and he got
[1:22:20] extremely sick the other time was the
[1:22:22] brown bear vision
[1:22:24] you understand that you listen to
[1:22:25] brother biscuit's testimony about the
[1:22:26] brown bear vision the brown bear was
[1:22:28] there
[1:22:29] everything was in place but brother
[1:22:32] branham didn't go where he was supposed
[1:22:33] to go to and he stead instead went with
[1:22:36] bud southwick instead of going with
[1:22:38] brother biscuit and the other brother i
[1:22:40] forget who it was billy paul or somebody
[1:22:42] and
[1:22:43] in that direction because if he had gone
[1:22:45] that direction they saw the bear
[1:22:48] and he would have shot the bear and
[1:22:50] because of that then they had miserable
[1:22:52] weather and they had to cancel their
[1:22:54] trip
[1:22:55] everything turned see you can't break
[1:22:57] the integrity of god's word no matter
[1:22:58] who you are
[1:23:00] because god protects the integrity of
[1:23:03] his word
[1:23:07] but the ramp says in perfect faith the
[1:23:08] only thing you have to do then is have
[1:23:10] faith in what you are
[1:23:12] have faith in what the word says you are
[1:23:14] jesus had faith in the word of god that
[1:23:17] said what he was it's written of me
[1:23:18] didn't david in the psalms and the
[1:23:20] prophets and all of them speak of me i'm
[1:23:21] the bread of life that comes down from
[1:23:22] heaven i'm the tree of life in the
[1:23:24] garden of eden i am all these things i
[1:23:26] am that i am before abraham as i am
[1:23:30] with that
[1:23:31] a perfect faith that he was the anointed
[1:23:33] messiah and the spirit of god was upon
[1:23:35] him jesus had perfect faith he had it
[1:23:37] and it come because he was the word
[1:23:40] and you become the word
[1:23:42] as you receive the word
[1:23:46] and when you pray believe that you
[1:23:49] receive what you ask for and you shall
[1:23:51] have it it'll be given you
[1:23:53] time
[1:23:54] space
[1:23:55] nothing else will ever change it you
[1:23:59] know it's done
[1:24:00] and it's already over with
[1:24:04] let integrity
[1:24:06] preserve me
[1:24:07] in the midst of a crumbling world the
[1:24:10] integrity of god's purpose will preserve
[1:24:12] you in this age
[1:24:14] he's anointed the word for this hour we
[1:24:16] speak from wholeness a restored word
[1:24:20] we speak from a a maturity of the word
[1:24:23] in this age this message is not
[1:24:25] something that that's undermines or or
[1:24:28] that is uh
[1:24:29] this message is the culmination of all
[1:24:32] that god purpose this is the fulfillment
[1:24:35] of his integrity
[1:24:37] because if you understand that that
[1:24:39] means
[1:24:40] god will protect this message
[1:24:44] we don't have to protect it
[1:24:46] god will take this message to its final
[1:24:48] purpose because it's part of the
[1:24:51] integrity of the word of god with the
[1:24:54] musicians come
[1:24:58] we're living in a crumbling age aren't
[1:25:00] we
[1:25:03] it's a it's a terrible age
[1:25:05] that
[1:25:07] america is called the greatest nation in
[1:25:10] the world i know you all believe that
[1:25:13] and it may very well be
[1:25:15] but it's falling apart
[1:25:17] why is it falling apart because it
[1:25:19] rejected
[1:25:21] the integrity of god's word
[1:25:25] and and nebuchadnezzar saw it in a dream
[1:25:28] and daniel interpreted the dream to
[1:25:30] nebuchadnezzar
[1:25:32] and said you know there was a head of
[1:25:33] gold and sil shoulders and of and arms
[1:25:37] of silver and breastplate of brass and
[1:25:39] loins of iron and legs of iron and clay
[1:25:42] on down to the feet and all of that and
[1:25:44] it says then
[1:25:46] a rock was hewed out of the mountain
[1:25:48] without hands
[1:25:50] what is a rock it's a revelation
[1:25:53] and it smote the image in the field
[1:25:56] do you understand that this message is
[1:25:58] that rock
[1:26:02] it was shown to brother branham in a
[1:26:04] dream one of the dreams
[1:26:06] that was described i think it was junior
[1:26:08] jackson's dream
[1:26:10] in the
[1:26:11] uh
[1:26:12] in the message sirs is this the sign of
[1:26:14] the end
[1:26:15] and he said brother ram you took like a
[1:26:17] wrecking bar and ripped the top off the
[1:26:18] mountain
[1:26:20] an exposed rock that light had never
[1:26:22] shone on before revelation
[1:26:26] well that rock that was hewed out of
[1:26:28] that mountain
[1:26:29] has struck this age
[1:26:31] the reason america is falling apart is
[1:26:34] because of this message
[1:26:38] if this message had not come
[1:26:41] america would not have fallen apart
[1:26:45] but now the message is here
[1:26:47] and the elector here
[1:26:49] and the and the
[1:26:52] the governments and the rulers of this
[1:26:55] world
[1:26:56] don't know how to stop the collapse of
[1:26:58] our civilization
[1:27:00] they can't
[1:27:02] because the rock of revelation has
[1:27:05] struck the image
[1:27:07] and brother and brother daniel daniel
[1:27:10] says the whole image become dust
[1:27:13] but the rock raised up into a great
[1:27:16] kingdom
[1:27:17] that could never be moved
[1:27:20] that's what we're on the verge of
[1:27:22] you're seeing the image become dust
[1:27:25] you can't stop it
[1:27:27] but we're looking for every
[1:27:28] predestinated seed
[1:27:30] that are a part of that kingdom
[1:27:32] that'll never pass away
[1:27:34] are you one of them
[1:27:36] let's stand together
