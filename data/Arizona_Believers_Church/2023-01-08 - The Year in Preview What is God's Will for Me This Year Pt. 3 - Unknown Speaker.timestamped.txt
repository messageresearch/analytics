[0:00] try to jump right into this
[0:02] here at the outset
[0:04] and emphasize a few things at the
[0:06] beginning
[0:07] and hope that uh you can take a step
[0:11] further in this question this year of
[0:12] what is God's will for me
[0:14] and I want to at the beginning Express
[0:19] uh just how it's a preview and it's
[0:22] because God has laid certain things out
[0:24] for us and he's laid out a path and if
[0:27] God told you the path that you should
[0:29] take this year if you take it then you
[0:32] have the year in preview you know what
[0:34] it holds for you know things that are
[0:35] coming up and last Sunday we dealt a lot
[0:38] of with the concept of free moral agency
[0:41] or agency and making a choice and
[0:43] looking at how that we have an
[0:44] opportunity of choice with respect to
[0:46] many things in our lives that God has
[0:48] Sovereign and God has ordained certain
[0:50] things and God has said certain things
[0:52] will be and there's nothing we can do to
[0:54] upset that but in the obtaining to that
[0:58] and even the benefit we get from that
[1:00] God gives us a lot of different choices
[1:01] and Wednesday night we touched on how
[1:04] that our spiritual growth and maturity
[1:06] is demonstrated in the the specific
[1:09] choices we make or the deliberate
[1:10] choices we make and we can claim to be
[1:13] spiritual we can think that we're mature
[1:15] but just look at the choices you're
[1:16] making and that's going to tell you
[1:18] whether or not there's real spiritual
[1:19] growth or even emotional maturity and
[1:22] whether or not there's been this
[1:23] development
[1:24] and we touched on how that true success
[1:28] if we're going to have true success it's
[1:30] contingent upon following God's will for
[1:33] our lives and that we should not have
[1:35] any other measure of success other than
[1:38] whether or not we're in his word if we
[1:40] want to know whether or not we're being
[1:41] successful we look to his word we want
[1:42] to know whether or not we are in his
[1:44] will we look to his word and that's the
[1:46] measure of success and our success will
[1:48] come from fulfilling his purpose in our
[1:51] lives now if you turn to Romans chapter
[1:53] 9 I'd like to read verses 19 20 and 21
[1:57] and in reading this I would like to uh
[2:02] add another layer to the concept of will
[2:06] are having our own will God's will God's
[2:10] sovereignty even our agency and this is
[2:13] just touching on this very quickly
[2:14] before we move on
[2:16] and Paul is talking about how God
[2:18] chooses and how Jacob I've Loved
[2:21] um and he that's the one that he's
[2:23] Chosen and even before anyone had acted
[2:26] or done anything right or wrong he has
[2:27] already made this choice and so he kind
[2:30] of anticipates the objection when
[2:33] somebody realizes that God's the one
[2:35] that determines things and God's the one
[2:36] that chooses and so what is somebody
[2:38] going to say if God's got it all planned
[2:40] they say he says then we'll say thou
[2:43] Wilt say then unto me why doth he yet
[2:46] find fault why does he judge us why does
[2:48] he condemn us for who hath resisted his
[2:51] will that's his his purpose desire his
[2:54] determination and it is a good it is a
[2:58] good observance that oh who has resisted
[3:01] his will if God has determined to do
[3:03] something who is it that's going to keep
[3:05] God from stopping it and if this is what
[3:07] is Dawning upon the person that God is
[3:11] uh when he makes a determination he has
[3:13] a will who can resist it it's it's kind
[3:15] of put this way in light of God's
[3:17] sovereignty why would he still hold us
[3:18] accountable as free agents
[3:21] if he's the one that determines what
[3:23] happens and he's the one that says what
[3:24] I'll become and he makes me this way for
[3:27] his purpose and he hardens hearts for
[3:28] his purpose why would he still hold us
[3:31] accountable so it's actually a very
[3:33] intriguing question but Paul doesn't
[3:35] even answer the objection
[3:37] it doesn't try to fall into it and try
[3:39] to unpack this and describe that but he
[3:42] just points right back to God's
[3:43] sovereignty and he says nay but o man
[3:45] who art thou that replyest against God
[3:47] it may seem like a good question but he
[3:50] says who are you to even question God
[3:52] so it's a shall the thing forms say to
[3:54] him that formed it why hast Thou made me
[3:56] thus hath not the Potter power over the
[3:59] clay of the same lump to make one vessel
[4:01] into honor and another under this
[4:03] another under dishonor in other words we
[4:05] have no right to strive against God's
[4:07] Providence we have no right to fight
[4:09] against his desire and so my takeaway
[4:12] from this is if God has determined it to
[4:14] be so and it's fruitless to fight
[4:17] against it then the best thing we can do
[4:18] is yield to it the best thing we could
[4:21] do is choose it and accept it and say
[4:23] Lord if this is what you want instead of
[4:25] just constantly question it trying to
[4:27] figure it out trying to make sense of it
[4:29] what I can do and what would be best for
[4:31] me to do is to accept your will and
[4:33] humble myself to it in a way choose it
[4:36] identify it choose it then embrace it to
[4:38] say Lord this is what I want this is I I
[4:41] want to follow in your perfect will
[4:44] and as we touched on to the last two
[4:46] services and I'm going to bring them up
[4:48] again because we're still our goal is
[4:50] kind of to expand expound more upon
[4:52] these things is there are measurable
[4:55] things
[4:56] that we can outline as God's perfect
[4:58] will for us and we've been using kind of
[5:00] the start of the New Year everyone's
[5:01] saying well what's what am I going to do
[5:03] this year what's my bucket list what
[5:04] what are my resolutions what did I want
[5:06] to accomplish last year and what did I
[5:09] accomplish this year I remember one time
[5:11] a couple years ago we bought a state
[5:13] pass to attend go to an Arizona State
[5:15] Park and we said to ourselves we're
[5:17] going to go to as many state parks as we
[5:19] can this year and you want to know how
[5:21] many we ended up going to
[5:24] right you buy the one and you we're
[5:26] gonna do it we're gonna buy we're gonna
[5:28] buy a map that has all the state parks
[5:30] on it with a nice sticker that you could
[5:31] put in over it when you visit it and you
[5:33] don't ever put one sticker on it why
[5:35] because you have a plan we're going to
[5:37] do this this is what we want to do this
[5:38] year this is what we want to accomplish
[5:39] and we don't quite get it done but the
[5:41] new year affords is a chance to reset
[5:43] and say this year we're going to visit
[5:45] all the state parks
[5:46] and what I want to say though is what we
[5:49] can do is say I want to be in God's will
[5:51] I want to know what this year holds I
[5:53] want to know what I should do this year
[5:54] and his word tells us very obvious
[5:57] simple things that are his will that we
[6:00] can choose and we can do and know we're
[6:02] fulfilling his purpose
[6:04] Wednesday night we touched on the fact
[6:06] that we spend less than five percent of
[6:09] our times in church and as little as
[6:11] zero percent or twenty percent in giving
[6:13] to the work of the Lord and and so those
[6:16] things that we talked about on the first
[6:18] Sunday are a real small percentage of
[6:21] the of our lives so if he said well
[6:22] these you only want to do these things
[6:24] and they relate to church then there's
[6:26] still a large percentage of our time
[6:28] that we should account for and so
[6:30] Wednesday night we touched on these
[6:31] three things
[6:32] sanctify your home gather around the
[6:35] word and live for others these this is
[6:38] the God's will for our homes this year
[6:39] this is God's will for our life These
[6:41] are three things that we can do and in
[6:43] doing it know that we're fulfilling
[6:45] God's purpose for our lives we can
[6:47] sanctify our home keep our home
[6:49] Sanctified gather around the word and
[6:51] live for others those are things that we
[6:53] can do outside of church that are God's
[6:57] Will and these are things that church
[6:58] ought to support you in give you the
[7:00] resources for him but last Sunday I want
[7:03] to bring these three back up to us
[7:05] and then I'm going to move on from it
[7:07] but this is my target are these things
[7:09] that these are the this is the will of
[7:11] God for you I can say this just without
[7:12] any hesitation this is the will of God
[7:14] for you this year assemble yourselves
[7:16] together which attend church contribute
[7:18] your tithes and offerings and support
[7:19] missions these are things I think we
[7:21] should be reminded of constantly this is
[7:24] God's will for you these are the things
[7:26] that you can do to be fulfilling God's
[7:28] purpose for you
[7:29] and there's essentially six things that
[7:31] we've been able to lay out here that we
[7:34] could say you could do these and you
[7:36] know you're in God's will
[7:37] do these and we know that you're
[7:38] fulfilling God's purpose for your life
[7:40] and the Beautiful part of this is these
[7:42] things are constant
[7:44] these are things that we you can
[7:46] identify as the plain path that God has
[7:48] put before you and a world with so many
[7:51] choices and with so many decisions that
[7:53] we're having to make and a lot of things
[7:55] that we're still trying to figure out
[7:56] whether or not it's God's will right
[7:58] there's a lot of decisions we have to
[8:00] make well maybe I'm the only one that's
[8:01] got a lot of things that I pray about
[8:02] and I'm not sure what God's will is but
[8:04] I would think that all of us have
[8:06] several things at any given time we're
[8:08] praying about whether it's not whether
[8:10] it's God's will to do something and it's
[8:12] not like we can just turn to the book of
[8:14] jobs and it tell us what job to take
[8:16] right it's just not in it it's just not
[8:19] there to tell us sometimes explicitly
[8:21] what we can do so there's a lot of
[8:23] things we're praying for uh that don't
[8:25] relate that cannot be specifically
[8:27] identified explicitly in the word of God
[8:29] but there are some things that are
[8:31] explicit in the word of God that are our
[8:34] constants that we can identify that are
[8:36] that we can be certain are his will
[8:39] and these are things that we're looking
[8:41] at
[8:42] as being his will
[8:43] now if you look turn to the book of
[8:45] haggai
[8:46] I'm going to start with verse 3 and
[8:48] we're going to walk through these verses
[8:49] that we just read
[8:52] and I want to use what is taking place
[8:55] here as a type of
[8:58] these three things or these six things
[9:01] if I could put it that way
[9:03] and the number of things that we could
[9:05] clearly lay out in the word of God as
[9:06] being his will
[9:08] but the focus in this book is God's
[9:10] Temple and if you look at it
[9:12] historically the foundation had been
[9:14] laid uh 14 years before and a little bit
[9:17] of progress had been made in
[9:18] establishing the temple and rebuilding
[9:20] the temple but it had been laid laid
[9:23] wasting and in an unfinished state so
[9:25] they go there with much enthusiasm they
[9:27] laid the foundation uh maybe a little
[9:29] bit of progress made but basically
[9:31] almost 15 years has gone by and nothing
[9:33] more has been done but they could say oh
[9:36] we laid a foundation oh we've made it
[9:37] back we're no longer an exile and
[9:39] they're back in in Jerusalem and so the
[9:42] word of the Lord comes to kind of shape
[9:44] the people who in laid a foundation and
[9:46] there's a lot here to think about the
[9:48] foundation had been laid but there had
[9:50] never been anything added to
[9:52] there had never The Next Step had not
[9:54] been taken and in verse 3 it says then
[9:56] came the word of the Lord by haggai the
[9:58] prophet saying
[9:59] is it time for you oh ye to dwell in
[10:03] your sealed houses
[10:04] in this house lie waist now that phrase
[10:07] there
[10:08] the sealed houses is it speaks of
[10:11] wainscoting and paneling and so it's
[10:14] it's it's furnished it's got crown
[10:17] molding and a nice plaster and it's not
[10:21] just it's not just a place to live it's
[10:23] not just a shelter from the elements
[10:25] they've actually gone in and made it not
[10:27] just comfortable but filled with
[10:29] conveniences
[10:31] uh not just something to get them out of
[10:33] the the elements or a place where they
[10:34] could lay their head but where they
[10:36] could do it luxuriously and so the Bible
[10:38] and use in this phrase the sealed houses
[10:40] is wanting them to identifying that they
[10:43] had time for leisure they had time for
[10:46] Comfort they had time for conveniences
[10:47] and they were able to fill up their
[10:50] house with a lot of nice amenities uh is
[10:53] even as it says you dwell in sealed
[10:55] houses they had time to wainscoat their
[10:58] kitchen they had time to put bead board
[11:00] up in their master bathroom they lined
[11:03] them with Boards of Cedars what some say
[11:05] they would have used and despite the
[11:06] hard times despite the conditions of
[11:09] them coming back from Exile and the
[11:11] things that they face they figured out a
[11:13] way to make sure that they had all the
[11:14] latest and greatest in terms of
[11:16] amenities and Technologies and
[11:17] enjoyments and Recreations in their home
[11:21] and then it says but this house lie
[11:23] wasted
[11:24] they dwelled in these houses indulging
[11:26] themselves in luxury and ease and
[11:28] idleness but then the house of God laid
[11:31] neglected the foundation had been laid
[11:33] but nothing else was done to build it up
[11:35] so here God is recognizing that they're
[11:38] enjoying a lot of things in this life
[11:40] and had a lot of things that they could
[11:41] say hey we didn't have this in Babylon
[11:43] and didn't this great and God's blessing
[11:45] us but there was something that was
[11:47] God's will that was being left alone and
[11:49] not being attended to and that's what
[11:51] God wanted him to think about
[11:53] so he says this in verse 5.
[11:56] now therefore thus saith the Lord of
[11:58] hosts consider your ways the phrase is
[12:02] literally set your heart upon your ways
[12:04] start thinking about your ways and I
[12:06] think it's plural there because it wants
[12:08] you to consider what you have done what
[12:10] you are doing to think about not just
[12:12] your actions but even your sufferings to
[12:15] say set your heart upon your ways is
[12:17] wanting you to kind of take a big big
[12:19] look at everything
[12:21] and the path that has led you to where
[12:23] you are now what you are doing now and
[12:25] Ponder earnestly whether or not you've
[12:27] sought selfish things at the expense of
[12:30] God's will
[12:31] I brought you out of Babylon I bring you
[12:34] back to this place and my desire was
[12:36] that this Temple would be rebuilt and so
[12:37] much of their lives would have centered
[12:39] around the establishment of that house
[12:41] in the house of God and this is what God
[12:43] wanted him to do this is why they're
[12:45] coming back is to do this and when he
[12:47] says consider your ways think about your
[12:49] manner of life and how you're living and
[12:51] whether or not you're just merely
[12:52] indulging yourself and not doing what I
[12:55] want you to do
[12:57] consider whether you're prospering and
[13:01] even as we read in verse 6 whether or
[13:03] not there's any evidence
[13:05] that you are
[13:09] that God is not pleased with what you're
[13:11] doing
[13:12] he said whether or not there's any
[13:13] evidence of God's displeasure
[13:16] and the question consider your ways let
[13:20] me just back up for a moment it would be
[13:22] asking the question of examine your
[13:25] manner of life
[13:26] the common ways of life your what you
[13:29] labor in what your Recreations are what
[13:32] you consistently and constantly engage
[13:34] in and now I I do not want for a moment
[13:38] for us to start settling into the
[13:41] thought that I'm going to begin I'm just
[13:43] giving you a history lesson
[13:45] I'm wanting you to examine Yourself by
[13:48] these words so that that's obviously
[13:49] where I'm going to get so he's
[13:51] challenging them in that time what are
[13:53] you doing why are you doing it uh what's
[13:56] the purpose in doing it and and if
[13:58] there's any
[13:59] look at your what you do consistently
[14:02] look what has the preeminence look what
[14:03] it is you're laboring to achieve and and
[14:05] how you're Furnishing your home and how
[14:07] you're dressing yourselves and and how
[14:09] things are laying out what you
[14:10] consistently engage in and ask yourself
[14:13] whether or not is this really the
[14:14] evidence of prospering and being in
[14:16] God's will or are there other signs that
[14:19] God is displeased because it comes to
[14:22] this in verse six you have sown much and
[14:24] bring in little
[14:26] you eat but you have not enough you
[14:29] drink but you're not filled with drink
[14:31] you clothe you but there is none warm
[14:34] I I want you to think of it in this way
[14:37] that no matter what you get you're still
[14:39] a little you're wanting a little bit
[14:40] more
[14:42] you so much and you bring in little
[14:43] because you're not getting out of it
[14:45] what you want you eat but you don't have
[14:47] enough what is it it's this insatiable
[14:48] appetite to acquire to have you drink
[14:52] but you're not filled and you clothe but
[14:54] there's you're not warm you're always
[14:56] pursuing it's something that never quite
[14:58] satisfies and tells you this is good and
[15:00] this is right and and I'm happy with how
[15:03] I feel he says and then I think this
[15:05] phrase is just perfect and he that
[15:07] earneth wages earneth wages to put them
[15:09] into a bag with holes
[15:12] and and it's not it's not implying that
[15:15] someone literally has a bag with holes
[15:17] in it or a wallet with a hole or a bank
[15:18] account that's been hacked but rather
[15:20] it's saying that you labor and labor and
[15:22] labor but you're never able to store up
[15:24] it's what you earn you get it departs
[15:26] from you rather quickly and you're not
[15:28] able to really enjoy and you're not
[15:31] using that wage in a way that prospers
[15:34] you because it's just fleeting and goes
[15:36] away
[15:37] and these are very profound statements
[15:39] and he's doing it to ask the question
[15:41] are your difficulties and your struggles
[15:43] and these things that are happening due
[15:46] to your neglect of the house of God
[15:49] are you not satisfied with your drink
[15:52] are you not warm with your clothing are
[15:54] you not happy with what you're reaping
[15:56] and is it because not because you're not
[15:59] sowing enough not because your clothes
[16:00] aren't warm enough not because you don't
[16:02] have a high enough salary but is it
[16:04] because you have not done what God
[16:06] wanted you to do with respect to his
[16:08] house
[16:09] so it comes right back to it in verse 7
[16:11] thus saith the Lord of hosts consider
[16:13] your ways
[16:15] Ponder for yourself
[16:18] and I would say for ourselves also
[16:21] consider your ways he revises it think
[16:23] about your ways why is it you live in
[16:25] and be boarded Wayne's coded finally uh
[16:28] uh amenities in your home and live
[16:30] luxuriously live comfortably and live at
[16:32] ease but yet my house is forsaken he
[16:34] says consider your ways and then he
[16:36] gives them some more things to think
[16:37] about and revisit and says consider your
[16:39] ways and I'm thinking for ourselves this
[16:41] is what we ought to be doing today
[16:43] and then he continues in verses 8 to 11
[16:45] and we'll just finish up this reading
[16:47] and we'll come right back to it once we
[16:48] start making it applicable to ourselves
[16:50] go up to the mountain and bring wood and
[16:52] build the house that would be a that
[16:54] would be labor
[16:56] and I will take pleasure in it and I
[16:58] will be glorified saith the Lord
[17:00] you you look for much and lo it came to
[17:03] little
[17:04] and when you brought it home I did blow
[17:06] upon it there's labor there's things
[17:07] coming in there's a harvest but it's not
[17:09] quite satisfying not quite meeting the
[17:12] needs not quite what we want why saith
[17:14] the Lord of hosts because a mine house
[17:16] that is waste and you run every man into
[17:18] his own house
[17:20] this isn't a Prohibition to going back
[17:22] home after your work this isn't a
[17:23] Prohibition against having houses it
[17:25] speaks to the mindset that that was most
[17:27] what was most important were just the
[17:29] natural things and the house of God
[17:31] which was important to them and God's
[17:34] will for them and a purpose of their
[17:35] dwelling there in Jerusalem they laid it
[17:38] let it be and delay in waste and had not
[17:40] attended to it
[17:42] therefore the heaven over you stayed
[17:44] from doing the Earth the state from her
[17:46] fruit this is why there's not as much
[17:48] blessing this is why there's not as much
[17:50] enjoyment and I called for a drought
[17:52] upon the land and upon the mountains and
[17:53] upon the corn and upon the new wine and
[17:55] upon the oil and upon that which the
[17:56] ground bringeth forth and upon men and
[17:58] upon cattle and upon all the labor of
[18:00] the hands why because they had neglected
[18:04] the house of God
[18:06] God had told them to build up the house
[18:09] of God to put their resources now to God
[18:11] bring this Dwelling Place of God back to
[18:13] what was fit for God and what he desired
[18:15] and not that they would leave all those
[18:18] other things undone as Jesus would have
[18:20] said to the priest and the high priest
[18:22] and the Pharisees all these things you
[18:24] ought to have done and not left the
[18:26] other undone right so we ought to do
[18:29] them all not just kind of create well
[18:31] I'll do this and I'll do that I'll do
[18:32] this and I'll do that but he's saying
[18:33] that if I could put it this way it
[18:36] wasn't it wasn't to God he wasn't upset
[18:39] that they had nice wains coated in their
[18:41] house
[18:42] wood paneling if that makes it easier
[18:44] for some people to think about what that
[18:45] is
[18:46] I'm thinking Wayne has a coating now
[18:49] it's not that there's uh God wasn't
[18:52] displeased with that but it was what was
[18:54] missing
[18:55] that was the source of God's pleasure
[18:57] displeasure is they had left off the the
[19:00] building of the house of God and so
[19:02] these are the things God is saying
[19:04] because you've left off this the heaven
[19:06] has stayed from do the Earth estate from
[19:07] a fruit I hope you can just get that
[19:08] image in your mind that God is
[19:10] withholding blessings
[19:12] because they weren't doing all that they
[19:13] could according to his will and what
[19:15] they knew was his will
[19:17] now I'm going to transition to make it
[19:19] relevant today and I'll say this I'm
[19:21] wanting to draw make a direct
[19:24] application of these scriptures to our
[19:26] lives
[19:27] but I do not believe I can make an exact
[19:29] comparison of God's house to this church
[19:31] and this building
[19:33] and I'm not going to pretend that I can
[19:35] use haggai chapter 1 to tell all of you
[19:37] to start selling all these nice things
[19:40] you have in your home and put it into
[19:41] the building fund so that we can
[19:43] actually build our own church and we can
[19:45] have a church big enough for everybody
[19:46] and things like that I don't I think
[19:47] that would be misusing this scripture to
[19:51] use it strictly just about this church
[19:53] and this building but there is some
[19:56] application and type that can be made to
[19:58] our lives that would relate to church
[20:00] and relate to other things in our
[20:01] personal life
[20:03] and I would say that what we can glean
[20:05] from this the fundamental I could say
[20:07] the first principles in this is they
[20:09] were forsaking God's will
[20:12] so instead of turning this into a fiery
[20:15] sermon on upping our donations to the
[20:18] building fund I want to use it in this
[20:20] way to challenge us that in their
[20:23] particular situation their home their
[20:25] their lives were full of things to keep
[20:28] them busy to rest make them restful to
[20:31] live luxuriously to live comfortably and
[20:33] yet they were laboring they were getting
[20:35] increase and they were harvesting
[20:36] there's a lot of things taking place in
[20:38] your life that you can glean from these
[20:40] few scriptures but what wasn't being
[20:42] done was God's will
[20:44] right specifically for them it was
[20:46] getting the lumber and the materials
[20:48] together and rebuilding the temple so
[20:49] now what we can do for us is instead of
[20:51] saying oh does this mean we need to
[20:52] build a church do we need to build a
[20:54] church no what we need to do is do God's
[20:56] will
[20:57] that's what we need to do we need to do
[20:59] God's will it would make no sense to not
[21:01] know God's Will and not have have any of
[21:04] these six things that we've mentioned
[21:05] before down and down pat and then just
[21:07] put all our efforts in Building a Church
[21:09] it would be fruitless it would be vanity
[21:10] we would just be doing what a lot of
[21:12] people do
[21:14] we might as well just redenominate
[21:16] become the fifth Baptist Church of
[21:18] Glendale or something and try to get in
[21:20] line for some financing they'll buy us
[21:22] the land and they'll build us a church
[21:23] If all we're interested is having a nice
[21:25] building
[21:26] but our interest is in the things of God
[21:29] our interest is in a man's relationship
[21:30] with the things of God and his
[21:32] relationship to God and so if we could
[21:34] distill it down to the most basic
[21:36] element they were forsaking God's will
[21:38] God had promised him Prosperity God had
[21:41] promised them rest God had promised them
[21:42] some of the very things they were trying
[21:44] to enjoy but they were not doing what he
[21:47] wanted
[21:49] they were not following in the path that
[21:51] God had had for him so the book of
[21:53] haggai we could put it this way as the
[21:55] word of the Lord comes and rebukes
[21:56] Israel for living in nice houses while
[21:59] God's house is wasted
[22:01] and so I believe that this is an
[22:04] admonition and an instruction
[22:06] that become can become a practical
[22:09] principle for our personal lives
[22:12] so let's begin with the thought of
[22:13] consider your ways
[22:15] Ponder your path is what it's saying
[22:17] think about the direction you're going
[22:19] if you Ponder your path you look at how
[22:21] where you've come kind of the Meandering
[22:23] of your path which way you're taking so
[22:24] it's good kind of to look back a little
[22:26] bit look at where you're at look what
[22:27] direction it's sending you what manner
[22:29] of life do I have with my what are my
[22:31] habits what is the way that I'm living
[22:33] we can say what path am I pursuing if I
[22:35] continue down this course what does it
[22:37] look like
[22:38] a lot of times you're just living kind
[22:39] of in the moment and we say well he's a
[22:41] present tense God I just want to live in
[22:43] the moment that's great but God is also
[22:45] the god of the future
[22:47] right he is yesterday today and forever
[22:49] so God just cannot be the future cannot
[22:52] be abandoned so we look at ourselves and
[22:54] if what path am I pursuing if I continue
[22:57] to do what I'm doing now what is it
[22:58] going to look like
[23:00] and that's what the ant does right is it
[23:03] thinks about what the future is holding
[23:05] so it gets to work and it does things
[23:06] and the scripture talks about the
[23:08] sluggard just a little folding of the
[23:10] hands just a little bit of rest and
[23:11] thinks oh for the moment what I really
[23:13] need is a nap but it doesn't think about
[23:14] what the tomorrow's holds and what the
[23:17] demands are going to be and therefore it
[23:20] finds itself in ruin
[23:23] so we're looking at consider your ways
[23:25] there I would have saved that it
[23:27] challenges us to think about what our
[23:29] priorities are challenges to think about
[23:31] what our goals are what where what
[23:33] conduct have I been engaging in that's
[23:35] led me to where I am right now
[23:37] because what God was doing and I I
[23:39] wanted to maybe amplify this to Greater
[23:41] detail but I'm just going to narrow it
[23:43] down
[23:44] to this and just touch on Vision just a
[23:46] little bit God was correcting their
[23:48] vision
[23:50] he was challenging them about their
[23:52] foresight he was questioning their
[23:54] Prudence he's saying you've done a lot
[23:56] and you've and you've established a lot
[23:58] of things but you're not taking a step
[23:59] back and looking at the bigger picture
[24:02] you're not looking at things uh the
[24:04] right way you're living with the wrong
[24:05] priorities you're living with the wrong
[24:07] goals and he says it this way to me in
[24:08] verse six hang out chapter 1 verse six
[24:11] let's look at it again you have sown
[24:13] much in bringing little
[24:15] you eat but you have not enough
[24:17] you drink but you're not filled with
[24:19] drink
[24:20] you clothe yourselves you clothe you but
[24:22] there's none warm
[24:24] and he that earneth wages earneth wages
[24:26] to put into a bag with holes these are
[24:29] all consequences
[24:31] of not pursuing God's will
[24:33] they're making efforts I would say that
[24:36] there's they're sowing uh there's
[24:38] there's something to drink there's
[24:39] something to eat there's something to
[24:40] close themselves with there's those that
[24:42] are earning wages so it's not that they
[24:44] didn't have anything
[24:46] but their efforts were not being blessed
[24:48] and God is at the at a minimum
[24:50] identifying that you're living way below
[24:53] your privileges
[24:55] that you may be happy with this life but
[24:57] I'm telling you it's not the full life
[24:59] you could be leading you're living way
[25:00] below your privileges and he's saying in
[25:03] order to be truly blessed in order to
[25:05] truly prosper and be happy you have to
[25:07] get your priorities right and you have
[25:10] to start putting your mind and your
[25:12] energies and your efforts into towards
[25:14] God towards God's Will and he's saying
[25:16] these things are fine but your emphasis
[25:18] ought not to be on these things because
[25:20] by emphasizing them you're actually
[25:22] minimizing them no matter how much you
[25:25] think in your mind you're getting
[25:26] something out of it by emphasizing it
[25:28] you're minimizing it but if you'll just
[25:30] emphasize me I can maximize the very
[25:34] things you no longer emphasize
[25:37] I don't know if I need an organ behind
[25:39] that or not
[25:41] but there's things that we are choosing
[25:43] we're failing to give priority to and by
[25:47] giving priority to the wrong things the
[25:49] very things that seem to be the greatest
[25:50] necessity are becoming the greatest
[25:52] curses and are failing even to meet the
[25:55] needs because you're not putting God
[25:57] first
[25:59] and this is the lesson that we take from
[26:00] haggai this is exactly what God is
[26:02] telling Israel in haggai and I think
[26:05] that as they were kind of living
[26:06] lasciviously and living according to
[26:08] excess and and having their own little
[26:10] laodicean moment we need to think about
[26:13] our lives in the way that we're living
[26:15] and we need to shake ourselves and we
[26:17] need to live deliberately
[26:19] that we ought to live deliberate
[26:21] Christian lives we ought to live lives
[26:23] that are that are captivated by the
[26:26] things of God and that when we have a
[26:29] vision of what we think uh God's will is
[26:31] for our lives we have a vision of what
[26:32] God wants you to be as a Christian then
[26:34] we live deliberately according to that
[26:36] vision and if we have that listen to
[26:38] this way if we have the idea that if we
[26:41] want to be healed we set a body before
[26:43] us and we by faith walk into that body
[26:46] then I think we could think about the
[26:48] kind of Christians that God wants us to
[26:50] be the kind of homes that God wants us
[26:52] to have the kind of character that God
[26:55] thinks we should have or that we want to
[26:56] have and we should have a vision of that
[26:58] and by eyes of Faith begin to make steps
[27:01] into it
[27:05] the Bible says in Proverbs 29 18 where
[27:07] there is no vision
[27:10] that vision is divine Oracle where there
[27:12] is no divine revelation
[27:15] the people perish
[27:17] now I know we like to think that that
[27:18] means they just die and they disappear
[27:20] but it means they live scattered lives
[27:23] they live unrestrained there's no
[27:24] discipline where there's no divine
[27:27] revelation people just do whatever they
[27:28] want and this is why we are where we are
[27:31] today in America this is why we where
[27:33] are we we are today in the world is
[27:35] there is no absolute truth there is no
[27:37] Divine Oracle there's no agreed upon
[27:39] Revelation and every man could just live
[27:42] to themselves so everybody just scatters
[27:44] they live unrestrained they live
[27:45] undisciplined and so where there is no
[27:47] divine revelation that people perish
[27:50] but he that keepeth the law
[27:52] happy is he
[27:54] what is what is the proverb done it's
[27:56] tied together divine revelation and the
[27:58] word
[27:59] he that keepeth the law happy is he
[28:02] consider your ways it's saying what's
[28:04] the path for your life what's the path
[28:06] for your family what's the path for your
[28:08] home what is it you're doing where there
[28:10] is no vision where there is no divine
[28:12] revelation and we know that faith is a
[28:15] revelation of God's will
[28:17] and so that we we if we want to live by
[28:20] faith we have to live by a revelation of
[28:24] the Divine will of God it's not just
[28:26] living with believe and you can have
[28:27] whatever you want and we say oh that's a
[28:29] life of Faith just name it claim it
[28:31] whatever I want it's just going to have
[28:32] the power of Attraction the power of
[28:34] Desire the power of expectation living
[28:36] by faith is living with a supernatural
[28:39] revelation of the Divine will of God for
[28:41] my life and that's how I can live by
[28:44] faith
[28:46] where there is no vision where there's
[28:48] no revelation of God's purpose that's
[28:51] when we live undisciplined inconsistent
[28:53] lives
[28:55] but happy is he that keepeth the law
[28:57] true contentment satisfaction and
[28:58] security comes from being in God's will
[29:02] and I would say the lesson in haggai is
[29:04] don't prefer convenience and triple
[29:07] enjoyment over the will of God
[29:09] it's like your homes may be nice and you
[29:11] may be running back to your house
[29:12] because it's a fun place to be and all
[29:14] you got to do is walk in the door and
[29:15] say okay Google turn on the lights okay
[29:17] Google play my favorite playlist okay
[29:19] Google turn on the stove okay Google get
[29:21] a waffle out of the microwave into the
[29:23] microwave and you just all of a sudden
[29:25] everything's just doing whatever you
[29:26] want you can just set the mood right
[29:28] some of us have it towards voice
[29:30] activated moods when we walk into our
[29:32] bedroom and everything's just right and
[29:34] we lounge and we sit down and
[29:36] everything's great and we don't even
[29:37] have lights in the house of God
[29:39] [Applause]
[29:41] but that's how we how we live everything
[29:43] is just custom ordered is that we ought
[29:46] to think more about God's will than all
[29:48] the convenience and Temple enjoyments of
[29:51] this life
[29:53] because if we're going to have real
[29:54] comfort and continual temporal temporal
[29:57] enjoyments
[29:58] we need to put God first
[30:00] think about that this is where the devil
[30:03] tries to get us oh if you serve God you
[30:05] can't have any of that or if you put God
[30:06] first you can't have it if you pay your
[30:07] tithes you're not going to be able to
[30:08] pay your rent pay your rent
[30:10] you pay your tithes you're going to have
[30:11] a mortgage
[30:13] hey
[30:14] you keep paying your tires the mortgage
[30:16] can be gone
[30:17] I'm so worried that if I pay tithes I
[30:20] have to turn in my leased car you're
[30:21] gonna own your car you pay your ties
[30:23] these are the things that God promises
[30:25] these are things that God has said so
[30:26] sometimes the devil puts in our mind
[30:28] it's an either or proposition either
[30:29] choose God and be poor or just keep
[30:32] living comfortably and just write out
[30:33] the recession and when things get a
[30:35] little bit better and you're making a
[30:36] little bit more you can put more time
[30:37] into things of God you don't have to do
[30:39] that the devil's lying to you because
[30:41] listen real enjoyment real comfort and
[30:44] even the things that are temporal will
[30:46] last longer when you put God first
[30:54] I really and the way it said in haggai
[30:57] really if we don't put God first
[30:59] anything with joy enjoys just going to a
[31:01] bag with holes
[31:03] anything we gain or achieve we do
[31:05] something and we're not quite as warm as
[31:07] we want to be
[31:08] I mean listen we all we've all been
[31:10] there and done that we've ordered
[31:11] something we bought something we were
[31:13] really really excited about it we
[31:15] planned a vacation we went to eat some
[31:17] whatever it is and then when you do it
[31:18] you're kind of like
[31:21] I mean
[31:22] it's nice
[31:23] but it didn't change my life like I
[31:26] thought it would
[31:27] like some of you who went to Rito's
[31:29] you're like I mean it's good but come on
[31:30] every service mentioning it right
[31:33] there's just something that lets you
[31:34] down a little bit it just doesn't that
[31:36] just didn't do for you like you thought
[31:38] it would now is a sense of
[31:40] dissatisfaction
[31:42] and you're just not quite satisfied if
[31:45] you can look back in your life and see a
[31:47] series of moments and events like that
[31:49] instead of keep chasing the dragon and
[31:51] trying to find that high that satisfies
[31:54] I would think Lord you're the only one
[31:56] that can give me that type of enjoyment
[31:59] you're the only one that can give me
[32:01] that type of satisfaction and I promise
[32:04] you if you put him first you'll enjoy
[32:07] things in this life much more
[32:09] [Applause]
[32:13] you keep wondering why you come up empty
[32:15] why this doesn't hit you know why
[32:17] because God wants you to recognize
[32:18] something's out of place
[32:21] proverbs 4 25 and 26 says let thine eyes
[32:24] look right on and let nine eyelids look
[32:26] straight before thee this is what we
[32:28] ought to do we have a vision we have a
[32:29] goal
[32:30] this is about having purpose about being
[32:32] deliberate Ponder the path of thy feet
[32:35] and let all thy ways be established
[32:38] think about where you want to be
[32:40] recognize the path it's going to take to
[32:43] get you there and fix your heart on that
[32:45] course
[32:52] Ponder the path of thy feet and let all
[32:54] thy ways be established plain firm it's
[32:57] exactly what he's saying in haggai
[32:59] consider your ways this is an imitation
[33:02] to review cause and effect
[33:04] he's saying all right think about it
[33:06] think about where you are think about
[33:07] what's happening and what you're doing
[33:09] and what you're getting out of it what
[33:11] you're not doing and the impact it's
[33:13] causing is ask them to consider sowing
[33:14] and reaping
[33:15] and I wanted to get into a little bit of
[33:18] being proactive
[33:20] and maybe that concept of being
[33:22] proactive in our lives to where we're
[33:24] willing to put in the hard work now to
[33:26] reap a benefit in the future
[33:28] and I just think that that may be a sub
[33:31] thought that's worthy of more time but
[33:33] let me say it to you this way we should
[33:35] be forward-looking
[33:36] we're living in the now but with the now
[33:38] we think about what this is going to
[33:40] result in in the future and we're
[33:42] thinking about what we're doing now but
[33:44] how we're conducting ourselves how we're
[33:46] conducting ourselves presently what that
[33:48] looks like in the future if I project
[33:49] this forward
[33:51] in Galatians chapter 6 verses 7 to 9 we
[33:54] read verse 9 last time last Sunday let
[33:56] us not be weary and well doing for in
[33:58] due season we'll reap we shall reap if
[34:00] we faint not
[34:01] but says be not deceived this is the
[34:03] principle that it's built upon be not
[34:04] deceived God is Not mocked
[34:07] for whatsoever a man soweth that shall
[34:09] he also reap
[34:11] for he that soweth to his flesh shall
[34:13] reap of the flesh shall of the flesh
[34:15] reap corruption
[34:17] but he that saw it to the spirit shall
[34:19] of the spirit reap life Everlasting
[34:22] and let us not be wearing while doing
[34:24] for in due season we shall reap if we
[34:26] faint not
[34:28] whatever you reap whatever you sow
[34:30] you'll reap this God is Not mocked
[34:32] it's the law of the Harvest it's the law
[34:34] of sowing seed it's the every seed
[34:36] bringing forth of its kind whatever
[34:37] you're sowing is what you're going to be
[34:39] reaping if you sow to the flesh you will
[34:41] reap of the flesh if you sow to the
[34:43] spirit you shall reap abundant things
[34:45] from the spirit this is the law this is
[34:47] what God is wanting to think about when
[34:49] they're earning a wage and putting a bag
[34:51] and it so quickly Falls away he said
[34:53] look at the consequence of Your Action
[34:55] you cannot continue to sow to the Flesh
[34:58] and think that you're not going to reap
[35:00] corruption you cannot think you can
[35:01] continue to sell to carnal things and
[35:03] that that's going to last forever those
[35:06] things will come to an end
[35:08] there's a lot of things we've put our
[35:09] faith in a lot of things we put our
[35:11] confidence in and we were just we were
[35:13] just getting lucky
[35:15] and we ride it out as long as it can and
[35:17] it all falls apart we think where did I
[35:18] go wrong where did I go wrong we go
[35:20] wrong when we leave out God's will
[35:23] I mean I hate to put it this way but
[35:25] your Luck's gonna run out
[35:29] listen how again this is the the
[35:32] consider your ways of just amplifying
[35:34] consider your ways
[35:36] First Corinthians chapter 15 verse 32.
[35:40] if after the manner of men I have fought
[35:42] with beast at Ephesus what advantage it
[35:44] to me what advantage it me
[35:47] what advantage is it to me if I'm just
[35:50] fighting with Beast after the manner of
[35:53] men if this is just a carnal fight
[35:55] it's quite a statement I fought with
[35:56] beast at Ephesus what good is it for me
[35:59] if the dead rise not
[36:03] you notice how immediately Paul puts
[36:05] things in perspective
[36:07] this chapter 15 is the Body Change
[36:08] chapter
[36:10] and he said there is no advantage to my
[36:14] labor
[36:15] if I'm not pursuing the proper goal
[36:18] if I'm not thinking about the future if
[36:20] I'm not thinking about God's promise if
[36:22] I'm not thinking about the resurrection
[36:23] if I'm not thinking about the Rapture if
[36:25] I'm not thinking about God's will for my
[36:26] life then it's no advantage to me to do
[36:29] all the things that men should do why
[36:32] should I fight if there's no
[36:33] resurrection and this is his conclusion
[36:35] if the dead rise not let us eat and
[36:37] drink for tomorrow we die
[36:40] they say well I'm not actually I haven't
[36:42] quite thought about that but when God
[36:45] loses his place we immediately and
[36:48] instinctively fall into just feed the
[36:50] flesh
[36:51] eat drink sleep repeat we're just doing
[36:54] the things make sure I have money to buy
[36:55] what I want to eat make sure I have
[36:57] money to buy what I want to wear make
[36:59] sure I have money to pay for the car to
[37:01] get me to the place to make sure I have
[37:02] money
[37:03] right so I can go home and sleep so I'm
[37:05] good enough to go back to the place
[37:06] where I can make this money and we just
[37:08] get back in that same cycle right the
[37:10] same cycle of just living shampoo lives
[37:13] lather rinse repeat we've read the
[37:15] bottle if you follow it explicitly you
[37:17] run out of shampoo in the first setting
[37:19] because you allow the rinse repeat
[37:21] lather rinse repeat it never tells you
[37:22] when to stop and that's kind of the
[37:24] lives that we live we live shampoo lives
[37:26] we're just always waking up doing the
[37:28] same thing and Paul's saying hey if this
[37:30] is all this life has got for us if
[37:31] there's not a Hereafter we're not
[37:33] looking for a city if there's not
[37:35] something that means more than natural
[37:37] things if there's not a supernatural God
[37:39] present that has called me to serve him
[37:42] and do things for his kingdom then I
[37:44] might as well just eat drink and be
[37:46] merry for tomorrow I die this is a
[37:48] recalibration of our vision
[37:52] this is thinking differently about God's
[37:55] will for our lives
[37:57] and if I could say this as Paul places
[37:59] it if we don't have
[38:02] a appreciation of the future
[38:07] then we live aimlessly
[38:09] where there is no vision divine
[38:11] revelation Divine Oracle if there's not
[38:13] some understanding of what God's will is
[38:14] for our lives we live unrestrained we
[38:16] live undisciplined
[38:18] if we don't understand the future
[38:19] consequences of our present actions then
[38:22] it doesn't give real weight to our
[38:24] present actions if you knew you could do
[38:27] something and he would only hurt for
[38:28] just a second and immediately afterwards
[38:30] there's no scar there's no permanent
[38:32] injury there's a lot of things unions be
[38:34] doing
[38:35] trust me if you knew that you could jump
[38:38] off a cliff and it would only sting for
[38:39] a moment when you hit the water even if
[38:41] it's 150 feet some of you would just do
[38:44] it and I know that because some of you
[38:45] do do it
[38:48] and so the the lower the pain threshold
[38:50] and let lower the consequences are I'm
[38:53] kind of a scaredy cat I mean I I
[38:54] wouldn't jump off a cliff into the water
[38:56] if it was just 12 feet like I don't know
[38:59] that just doesn't seem like a fun idea
[39:00] I've never got the idea of a haunted
[39:02] house
[39:03] or scary movies
[39:05] why would I want to be scared
[39:07] hey I just don't get it
[39:09] so if you think about the idea of
[39:12] lessening the consequences that what I
[39:14] go through now that has no future impact
[39:16] now what I'm trying to say is the less
[39:19] we are aware of the potential
[39:21] consequences the more risky we live the
[39:24] more unrestrained we live and we don't
[39:26] give any consideration oh if we oh my
[39:29] landlord will never kick me out or
[39:30] they'll never come and repossess my car
[39:33] if you're not worried about consequences
[39:35] you'll live financially undisciplined
[39:37] you'll live nutritionally undisciplined
[39:39] whenever we lose sight of the future we
[39:42] lose the weight of the moment is lost
[39:45] and the importance of what we say and
[39:47] what we do is lost that's why sometimes
[39:49] we say whatever we want to people treat
[39:52] them however we want and do whatever we
[39:54] want because we've completely lost
[39:56] awareness of the consequences of our
[39:58] behavior and what it looks like when
[40:00] it's projected into the future
[40:03] and so we ought to we know God is a
[40:05] present tense God we live today but God
[40:07] is the god of the future he's the god of
[40:09] tomorrow and we've got to think about
[40:10] the present tense
[40:12] I know this statement has it makes a
[40:14] different point in terms of the emphasis
[40:18] but in the sermon come follow me I I
[40:21] what I mean is it's making the point
[40:23] about how much we ought to pour into our
[40:25] children and train them
[40:27] but think of how he's saying this youth
[40:29] men and women for tomorrow if there is a
[40:31] tomorrow he says we must train them Lord
[40:35] so the this is these are the people for
[40:37] tomorrow so you can say oh well we look
[40:39] out on the congregation we see uh all
[40:41] these young people and all these young
[40:42] children oh this is their church it's
[40:44] going to be their church one day but he
[40:46] says we feel that burden to train them
[40:48] like there will be a tomorrow
[40:51] so could you imagine that if we
[40:53] acknowledge that the in the future the
[40:55] young people today these are the future
[40:57] deacons there's a future Pastor there's
[40:59] future trustees this is the Church of
[41:01] the future but we give no thought to how
[41:03] that we're training them right now for
[41:06] that future so he says we must train
[41:08] them today not tomorrow
[41:10] we don't wait till they're in that
[41:12] position we don't wait till it's more
[41:14] imminent we begin to do things now so
[41:16] that it would make it easier for them to
[41:18] fulfill God's purpose of their lives
[41:19] later
[41:24] I think it's just too easy to undervalue
[41:26] the present
[41:28] especially in terms of what the future
[41:30] holds
[41:31] and and when brother Brandon says well
[41:33] we need to train them we must train them
[41:35] when we feel the burden to train them
[41:36] why because their success tomorrow is
[41:38] dependent upon what we do today
[41:41] their success tomorrow is built upon the
[41:44] foundation we're laying today
[41:49] consider your ways Ponder the path of
[41:51] thy feet so that your ways will be
[41:53] established look your eyes right on the
[41:54] eyelids look straight before thee
[41:57] I want to bring this in just very
[41:59] quickly
[42:00] in Psalm chapter 40 verse 2.
[42:04] he brought me up also out of a horrible
[42:06] pit out of the myri clay
[42:09] and set my feet upon a rock
[42:12] there's so much that you can identify in
[42:15] the book of haggai even of how that
[42:18] their
[42:18] of a Salvation a foundation being laid
[42:21] an anchor point
[42:23] and I I read I wanted to read this
[42:25] because I believe that many of us can
[42:27] testify he's brought me out of a
[42:29] horrible pit he brought me out of a
[42:31] miracle he set my feet upon a rock he's
[42:33] established a foundation but then
[42:35] there's an and
[42:38] established my Goings
[42:41] there has been something steady there
[42:43] has been something persistent there's
[42:44] been something there's been progress met
[42:46] and established my goings remember in
[42:49] the sermon power of transformation as we
[42:51] have been filled with the Holy Ghost as
[42:52] we have then now we want our minds to
[42:55] the mind of Christ to have that
[42:56] preeminence in us I'm just paraphrasing
[42:58] and the transformation of our mind to do
[43:01] the will of God into the perfect will of
[43:04] gods and eyes this is what we can say
[43:05] I've been saved I've been set free I've
[43:08] been delivered I have salvation oh God
[43:11] did this for me 15 years ago God did
[43:13] this for me and we have that Blessed
[43:15] Assurance we have that anchor but God
[43:18] wants to establish every footstep
[43:22] oh then he establishes our goings if he
[43:25] wanted to distill these things down to
[43:27] six things let's just make it a seventh
[43:28] the first one is be sure that you're
[43:31] born again in other words know that you
[43:34] have received that blessed seal of God
[43:36] and you have that anchor down inside
[43:38] your soul and you've been sealed with
[43:40] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and if we
[43:42] have been sealed as we have then we know
[43:45] what God's will is for our lives because
[43:47] we look into the word of God and we see
[43:49] it plainly laid out before us
[43:53] and we want we're taking this moment
[43:55] here at the onset of this year this
[43:58] first week of the year to think about
[44:00] the path that we're on
[44:03] and when it says you've established my
[44:05] goings I I think I want to touch on this
[44:07] in Greater detail but it was it kind of
[44:10] caught me this way of what what kind of
[44:12] Rhythm are we in
[44:13] I was a Cadence to our lives right
[44:15] there's a routine some people are very
[44:17] habitual and their their coffee maker is
[44:20] set to make coffee at a certain time
[44:21] because they're going to be up and it's
[44:23] going to be hot perfectly made from a
[44:25] certain time and you can always predict
[44:26] where they are any given moment because
[44:28] their creatures of habit
[44:30] and they and their discipline and so
[44:32] there's a rhythm to people who are very
[44:34] disciplined but there's also a rhythm to
[44:35] people who aren't disciplined and you'll
[44:37] find that there's certain things that
[44:38] they make sure they always do and enjoy
[44:40] and reach for and grab and do and
[44:42] accomplish and succeed in even if they
[44:45] don't have other areas that are more
[44:47] fruitful beneficial you'll find there's
[44:48] a particular Rhythm to their lives and
[44:50] I'm asking us to think about what is
[44:52] constant in our life
[44:55] and and I'll just kind of throw this in
[44:57] here
[44:58] for the sake of the neighbors that live
[45:00] in the apartment next door
[45:01] foreign
[45:02] how The Addictive nature of so many
[45:04] things that are in our lives
[45:06] and by virtue of being able to place a
[45:08] device within our within our presence
[45:10] that is so easily accessible and
[45:13] portable I remember years ago
[45:16] I mean I I guess I could just share a
[45:18] little bit of a testimony when I was in
[45:19] law school all I did was I got up early
[45:21] and went to class and studied all day
[45:23] and I went and always ate like a 3 000
[45:25] calorie lunch at a place called Bubba's
[45:27] that had like fried chicken and mashed
[45:28] potatoes and gravy right there in Dallas
[45:30] right by the law school I am just
[45:32] putting in a plug for them a pretty good
[45:34] I don't know if they're still there and
[45:35] then I wouldn't eat again so I think I
[45:37] ended up like going into diabetic Comas
[45:39] after that and I'm going to drag myself
[45:41] out of the car to go study or go to my
[45:43] afternoon class and I got so unhealthy
[45:45] and I prayed and asked God I said God
[45:46] you I need your help and so to make a
[45:49] long story short I walked into a
[45:51] nutritional place and I mentioned I
[45:52] asked him about something and he said
[45:53] well what do you want it for I said I
[45:54] need to lose weight instead sit down he
[45:55] preached me a sermon
[45:57] and uh and he talked he's talking about
[45:59] uh he said there's three things you look
[46:01] for in a meal taste accessibility and
[46:03] calories
[46:04] and you like that maybe we could maybe
[46:06] we hit on that
[46:07] because if you're going to stay
[46:08] disciplined it needs to taste good but
[46:10] it needs to be accessible and it needs
[46:11] to meet your calorie threshold and I
[46:13] caught a revelation and I did it and it
[46:15] works and but the thing was The Taste
[46:18] accessibility and calories the
[46:21] accessibility of things and if you don't
[46:23] think the world has caught on to how the
[46:26] human mind works and it's got just the
[46:28] right taste for it it's just accessible
[46:30] and it's got just knows just how to feed
[46:33] you to keep your energy for it going and
[46:35] somebody think what in the world is
[46:37] brother Aaron talking about I mean is it
[46:39] the games I play on my phone
[46:42] foreign
[46:45] is it the dick of nature some of these
[46:47] dramatic series that are released all
[46:48] the time and you just keep hanging on
[46:49] the Cliffhanger you got to see it
[46:51] through binge watch when the season's
[46:53] over you re-watch the season before come
[46:55] on somebody
[46:57] right
[46:58] I think it should be said
[47:00] I think it should be mentioned because a
[47:02] lot of us are really good at making sure
[47:04] we always and you know what you know how
[47:06] I know this because you let your kids
[47:08] play one game at night you know at three
[47:09] o'clock they gotta they gotta get on the
[47:11] iPad because they got to open the crate
[47:14] right they're releasing some new
[47:16] character right come on and some of you
[47:19] people think you're laughing at your kid
[47:20] you're laughing at yourself
[47:22] because adults are addicted to it too
[47:25] it wouldn't surprise me if some bathroom
[47:27] breaks haven't been because of zuba or
[47:29] whatever it is
[47:32] or fantasy football
[47:37] I can say it because it's week 18.
[47:41] congratulations to Preston he won the
[47:44] league of some brothers in this church
[47:45] he won the Super Bowl congratulations to
[47:47] pressure
[47:49] these are things we ought to think about
[47:52] we're thinking about
[47:53] how that we can always make room in
[47:55] priority for certain things
[47:58] and maybe because I thought well
[47:59] Brethren you can't equate it it's so
[48:01] easy well I wonder why it's so easy
[48:04] I wonder why it's so easy to do all
[48:06] these other things and why it's just a
[48:07] little bit harder to do these other six
[48:09] things
[48:10] who do you think's made it that way
[48:12] in what reward do you get in these other
[48:15] things right you're the queen bee in the
[48:18] New York Times spelling bee
[48:19] congratulations you solved Wordle for
[48:22] the first time in two weeks right what
[48:24] is it that you get out of it
[48:26] what what kind of enjoyment it's a bag
[48:28] with holes in it but these other six
[48:31] things that are really really hard to
[48:32] keep up with you haven't stopped to
[48:35] think about the Eternal benefit and
[48:38] reward that comes from it and the
[48:40] cascading effect it has within families
[48:42] within homes within lives there's things
[48:45] that ought to have a greater priority in
[48:47] our lives
[48:49] so the Bible says in haggai chapter 1
[48:51] verse 8 I want to make this applicable
[48:53] for us I think I'm just going to hit my
[48:55] my way home here on this it says go up
[48:58] to the mountains and bring wood and
[49:00] build the house
[49:02] make the choice do the hard work he
[49:05] didn't say go to go online and order two
[49:07] hours Amazon Prime Lumber he's saying go
[49:10] up a mountain cut down trees trim those
[49:13] trees drag them down the hill trim them
[49:15] up and lay them the way you want to this
[49:18] is a quick sentence to say do the hard
[49:20] work labor for the house of God labor to
[49:23] do the will of God I know it's not going
[49:25] to be easy you're going to have to climb
[49:26] up a mountain chop down a tree carry it
[49:29] down shape it and fit it but do my will
[49:33] built the house that's what I'm telling
[49:35] you to do today build the house
[49:38] whether it be your spiritual home
[49:39] whether it be the atmosphere in your
[49:41] home whatever it might be in these six
[49:43] things I say build your house in other
[49:45] words do the will of God
[49:48] and he says and I will take pleasure in
[49:50] it and I will be glorified
[49:52] labor for the right things make the
[49:54] sacrifices because it's worth it
[49:57] this isn't an investment in a church
[49:59] this is doing God's will
[50:05] this is letting the word have
[50:06] preeminence
[50:08] brother Branham in the sermon looking
[50:09] for Jesus he said he's the center of our
[50:11] worship
[50:12] the center of our attraction
[50:15] the center of our life
[50:17] all that we have and want and are will
[50:19] be
[50:20] is based upon him
[50:23] all that we have and want are and will
[50:25] be is based upon him
[50:28] this is the way that ought to be
[50:31] where Christ is our aim
[50:33] where our first priority is doing the
[50:35] will of God
[50:37] we could spend time just outlining what
[50:39] priorities are
[50:40] and I say that there's in some maybe
[50:42] it's a corporate corporate culture a
[50:44] certain um processes they have something
[50:46] that's a governing priority this might
[50:48] be it might be this way in coding where
[50:50] there's something that takes priority
[50:52] and I'm looking at my coders you know
[50:53] like okay all right we're good and it's
[50:56] something that this if this then that
[50:58] type stuff right but there's something
[51:00] that is the main it's the governing
[51:02] priority that's going to rule this
[51:04] sequence it's the governing priority
[51:06] that you measure everything else by it's
[51:08] a priority that governs your conduct and
[51:10] determines one's actions you'll find
[51:12] this in certain settings where say at
[51:14] the end of the day this is our goal and
[51:16] whatever you do whatever you uh uh say
[51:19] or do or however you treat a situation
[51:20] it's got to meet this
[51:23] and if it doesn't you need to consider
[51:25] it and reevaluate it until you
[51:26] understand how that it does and I
[51:28] believe that in our lives we ought to
[51:30] have a governing priority in that
[51:32] governing priorities Christ
[51:34] he's the chief Captain he's the Supreme
[51:36] he's the one that we're considering and
[51:39] so we evaluate all our choices all our
[51:41] decisions all our Ambitions everything
[51:43] by whether or not it meets this
[51:45] governing priority think about how easy
[51:48] it is for other things to gain the
[51:49] preeminence for other things to have the
[51:51] impetus for the squeaky will to get all
[51:53] of our attention in the Greece and then
[51:54] we leave Christ alone and we're not
[51:56] doing his will oh I'm just asking you to
[51:58] consider your ways I'm just asking to
[52:01] think about what God's will is for your
[52:03] life I can be absolutely certain about
[52:05] things that are God's will for your life
[52:07] and I'm just saying consider your ways
[52:08] does everything fit that governing
[52:10] priority
[52:12] what is God's will for me this year
[52:18] I'm a attend church contribute times and
[52:22] offerings support missions
[52:24] you say when are you going to stop
[52:25] mentioning I may never stop mentioning
[52:26] these three things because these are
[52:28] three things this is what churches these
[52:29] are things that relate to what we do we
[52:31] should never lose sight of them
[52:33] I'll always keep our minds we must
[52:34] assemble ourselves together we must be
[52:35] contributing our ties and offers we must
[52:37] be supporting missions
[52:39] it wouldn't do us any good for all of us
[52:41] to stay home and say well if I'll just
[52:42] use my gas money towards missions and we
[52:44] just all stayed at home right
[52:46] and supported missions no it's we got to
[52:48] do everything
[52:51] let me run through three statements very
[52:52] quickly just to show this is God's Will
[52:54] and the sermon possessing all things he
[52:56] says our heavenly father thou has chosen
[52:58] that we should gather together
[53:00] that we should gather together
[53:02] it's the will of God that we should
[53:04] assemble ourselves together as we see
[53:06] the day approaching and that regularly
[53:09] sometimes we think that church is for
[53:11] the preach and the word and it is and so
[53:13] we think that as long as I'm hearing the
[53:14] word I check the box about church but if
[53:16] the assembling together
[53:19] it's the will of God that we should
[53:21] assemble ourselves together as you see
[53:22] the day approaching and that regularly
[53:24] Lord to bring ourselves closer to you
[53:26] and closer to each other
[53:29] I ain't ever felt close over a zoom call
[53:32] and closer to each other in a bond of
[53:34] Fellowship through the shed blood of
[53:36] Jesus which makes it possible
[53:38] it is the will of God that we should
[53:41] assemble ourselves together and the
[53:43] sermon Israel and the church part four
[53:44] brother if you paid your tithes and done
[53:46] what God said for you to do you wouldn't
[53:48] have these old suppers and things like
[53:50] that it says amen even the anointing oil
[53:52] jumped off on that
[53:59] I wanted to go back and listen to it I
[54:01] think maybe the anointing oil fell over
[54:03] and jumped off he says he said I hit
[54:04] something even the anointing oil saying
[54:06] amen
[54:08] if you paid your tithes and done what
[54:10] God said for you to do and doTERRA said
[54:13] amen
[54:15] you wouldn't have these old soup suppers
[54:17] mlms pyramid schemes hus side hustles
[54:20] and things like that
[54:21] he said even the anointed all jumped off
[54:23] what I said let me tell you something
[54:24] brother God wants a church that moves at
[54:26] a Divine will of God based upon thus
[54:28] saith the Lord amen that's what God
[54:31] wants is a church that moves in the
[54:33] Divine will of God based upon thus saith
[54:35] the Lord and a part of that is if you
[54:37] paid your tithes and done what God said
[54:39] for you to do why because that's God's
[54:41] will
[54:42] and then the end time sign he says
[54:45] you're doing God's will when you give to
[54:46] missions
[54:49] you're doing God's will when you give to
[54:50] missions these are just three quick
[54:52] statements I can throw out you say these
[54:53] things are God's will
[54:56] doing these things demonstrates that you
[54:57] have an understanding of God's will
[55:00] and not that you just haven't understand
[55:01] God's way you have an understanding of
[55:03] This Promise that's contained within
[55:05] these things
[55:07] and that God has a process that he
[55:09] unfolds for the people who do his will
[55:12] if you could think about it this way as
[55:14] I tried to use vision
[55:16] as a part of this
[55:19] when you attend church on a Sunday
[55:20] morning
[55:22] it's not for Sunday morning
[55:24] right
[55:25] it's for Monday morning
[55:28] right
[55:31] you don't just come to church for them
[55:33] for the morning it's for tomorrow
[55:36] when you contribute it's not for
[55:38] something passed
[55:39] churches in a debt snowball we're trying
[55:41] to catch up and pay off something no
[55:43] this is making this is something for the
[55:45] future
[55:47] the same thing in supporting missions if
[55:50] you support missions and you really do
[55:51] it with an understanding you're
[55:53] visionary
[55:55] because you realize that we that when
[55:57] that last that sheep that comes in that
[55:59] there's a work that God needs to do in
[56:01] every individual member of the body of
[56:02] Christ's life and when we support
[56:04] missions we value that last Soul that's
[56:06] coming in we value the minister that's
[56:09] going out on a maybe a motorcycle and
[56:10] driving for hours to go out into some
[56:12] remote place to establish the message in
[56:14] an area that's never been and
[56:16] established the word in places it's
[56:17] never been why not because we just want
[56:19] to use it for uh fundraising and not
[56:22] just thinking we do it because it's just
[56:24] some sort of tradition or habit do it
[56:26] because something anchors in your heart
[56:27] to realize there's something valuable in
[56:29] that there's something precious in that
[56:32] there's something wonderful that God is
[56:34] doing there's something God has
[56:35] accompanied anyways that if I can make
[56:37] an investment in missions if I can
[56:39] support missions then it can have an
[56:41] eternal
[56:42] Eternal impact listen if we pray for
[56:44] missionaries if we can find the
[56:46] financial ways to support missionaries
[56:48] to build churches and to support
[56:50] missions we may never shake the hand of
[56:53] the Evangelist we may never shake the
[56:55] hand of the missionary we never
[56:58] baptize a convert we may never visit
[57:00] another country but one day in eternity
[57:04] oh Hallelujah to see the reward that you
[57:08] people will have because you had a
[57:10] vision that it matters and it counts
[57:15] if we can say these things are the will
[57:17] of God
[57:18] brother Brown says when you find the
[57:20] will of God don't let nobody talk you
[57:22] out of it
[57:25] when you find the will of God don't let
[57:27] anybody talk you out of it
[57:29] I'm I think I'm making this pretty easy
[57:32] for you
[57:34] I've given you at least six things you
[57:36] shouldn't let the devil talk you out of
[57:39] is another place that's what we do
[57:42] you must first find the will of God
[57:44] before you can do the will of God
[57:47] you must first know what his will is in
[57:49] the matter
[57:49] and then don't turn it loose
[57:53] there's things that we can grab a hold
[57:55] of
[57:56] Maybe re-grip
[57:58] and take a hold of and say Lord I know
[58:00] this is your will and I'm going to fight
[58:02] for it
[58:03] I'm going to go up this mountain I'm
[58:04] going to cut down a tree and I'm going
[58:06] to bring this log back and I'm going to
[58:07] put it in the house I'm going to go up
[58:08] this mountain I'm going to cut down a
[58:09] tree and I'll bring it down and put it
[58:11] in this house I'm going to build the
[58:12] house I'm going to build the house I'm
[58:14] going to keep laboring I'm going to keep
[58:15] working I'm going to keep gutting it up
[58:16] I'm going to keep trying
[58:19] amazing
[58:20] there's a saying I can't remember now
[58:22] just who it is it said I kind of use it
[58:24] in a different way but it's uh and I
[58:26] wish I could remember the person that's
[58:27] one of the old-time Believers God's will
[58:30] and his time will never lack for
[58:31] provision God's will done right God's
[58:34] will done in his way will never lack for
[58:35] resources
[58:37] you know we can't say we can't say that
[58:39] for us right
[58:42] I I like last night I tried to play a
[58:44] game of 21 with my boys I thought I was
[58:46] going to pass out
[58:48] right no matter how much I want to I get
[58:51] winded there's a limit right here
[58:52] but there's something about doing God's
[58:54] will
[58:56] that when when you're just about to run
[58:58] out he always provides when you're just
[59:00] about to run out God always provides
[59:02] when you're not sure if you can make it
[59:03] God always provides but you got to set
[59:05] your face towards it
[59:07] if you're going to make the conscious
[59:09] decision to not do his will you're never
[59:11] going to tap into the resource that can
[59:13] be available to you when you purpose as
[59:14] a family I'm going to do God's will I'm
[59:17] going to do this
[59:19] I'm going to do it because I know this
[59:20] is God's will I'm going to do it because
[59:21] I know it's right I'm going to do it
[59:22] because I know this is what God wants
[59:23] for me and despite all the opposition
[59:26] knowing that it might hurt knowing that
[59:28] It Might Sting knowing it's going to be
[59:29] hard I'm going to look at that mountain
[59:31] and say God this is what you want me to
[59:33] do you want me to go up this mountain
[59:34] I'm going to go up this mountain I'm
[59:36] going to cut down a tree and I'm going
[59:37] to bring it back and I'm going to put in
[59:38] the House of God I promise you that when
[59:41] you make that determination we're
[59:43] talking about you consciously choosing
[59:45] the will of God embracing it and sending
[59:48] yourself to do it God will give you
[59:50] God will give you the Instinct God will
[59:53] give you the ambition sometimes what it
[59:55] takes is just for us to make the
[59:57] decision and mean it and not turn loose
[1:00:00] of it
[1:00:00] [Applause]
[1:00:03] I want to close with the story
[1:00:06] of the Widow of Zarephath
[1:00:09] God dealt with me uniquely on this
[1:00:10] yesterday
[1:00:12] and I just feel to close with this story
[1:00:14] in First Kings chapter 17.
[1:00:17] verses 10 to 16.
[1:00:21] and so
[1:00:26] Elijah
[1:00:29] has now he had been sustained By Ravens
[1:00:34] and brother Branham even says in one
[1:00:36] place that's the the ministry
[1:00:39] but there came a time when Elijah
[1:00:42] had to go to a widow
[1:00:45] of Zarephath a place of purging
[1:00:48] this woman represents the bride
[1:00:50] we could use such a spiritual type of
[1:00:52] the Bride so he arose and went to
[1:00:54] Zarephath why because God told him that
[1:00:57] there he had ordained a woman there was
[1:01:00] a bride there's a bride you say well how
[1:01:02] in the world is this message continued
[1:01:04] because God raised up a bride to sustain
[1:01:06] it
[1:01:07] that's why we're here she arose he arose
[1:01:10] and went to Zarephath
[1:01:12] and when he came to the gate of the city
[1:01:14] behold the widow woman was there the
[1:01:17] widow woman not just a winner woman the
[1:01:19] widow woman was there Gathering sticks
[1:01:22] and he called to her and said fetch me I
[1:01:25] pray thee a little water in a vessel
[1:01:27] that I may drink
[1:01:29] now I know your most of you if not all
[1:01:32] of you are familiar with the story there
[1:01:33] was a drought
[1:01:35] this was a very significant drought it
[1:01:36] was a drought that was leading people
[1:01:37] and people were dying as a result of
[1:01:39] this drought it's because of the drought
[1:01:41] that the Brook Terrace dried up and God
[1:01:43] had to take Elijah and move him to
[1:01:46] seraphat because there's no water
[1:01:48] so there was one resource that was
[1:01:50] probably the most precious at this time
[1:01:53] and it was water
[1:01:54] and it's the first thing God asked for
[1:01:57] right he says go and get me a little
[1:01:59] water and what I think what's so
[1:02:02] beautiful is verse 11.
[1:02:04] in verse 11.
[1:02:06] and as she's going to fetch it
[1:02:08] no objection
[1:02:10] water
[1:02:12] you want water you could ask for
[1:02:13] anything but water
[1:02:15] why would you ask for the thing that's
[1:02:17] the most precious why would you ask for
[1:02:18] the thing that ain't coming a long time
[1:02:20] why would you ask for water it's the one
[1:02:22] thing that we're praying for but she's
[1:02:24] almost instinctively without even
[1:02:26] thinking twice about it she goes to get
[1:02:28] the water
[1:02:30] and as she's going to get it he said
[1:02:32] bring me I pray thee a morsel of bread
[1:02:35] in thine hand
[1:02:37] so now he's really getting not only does
[1:02:39] he want water but he wants bread these
[1:02:41] are the things that would be the most
[1:02:42] scarce without water there's no grain
[1:02:45] without grain there's no bread the
[1:02:46] cascading events of a drought the
[1:02:48] cascading events of this dire situation
[1:02:50] that had come upon him and she said as
[1:02:52] the Lord thy God liveth I have not a
[1:02:54] cake
[1:02:55] but a handful of mill in a barrel and a
[1:02:57] little oil in a cruise and now here's
[1:02:59] just her honesty and behold I am
[1:03:01] Gathering two sticks that I may go in
[1:03:03] and dress it for me and my son that we
[1:03:06] may eat it and die Now you kind of get
[1:03:08] the full weight of just how bad the
[1:03:09] circumstances were that it was such a
[1:03:11] terrible drought that there had not been
[1:03:13] any way to grow grain or crops that
[1:03:15] she'd come down to where she had the
[1:03:17] last little bit of meal and the last
[1:03:19] little bit of oil enough to bake a cake
[1:03:21] and feed it to her son and she knew this
[1:03:23] would be their last meal
[1:03:26] she knew they would be drinking their
[1:03:27] last little bit of water usually the
[1:03:29] last little bit of oil last little bit
[1:03:30] of meal and that this is I don't even
[1:03:32] know if we really can fully appreciate
[1:03:34] just how she must have felt in this
[1:03:36] situation I know that my son and I are
[1:03:39] going to die
[1:03:40] now parents can put themselves in
[1:03:42] desperation
[1:03:43] this is the reality of her situation and
[1:03:47] she's doing what a mother ought to you
[1:03:49] know she's going out Gathering the
[1:03:50] sticks
[1:03:51] and she's going to uh
[1:03:54] make the little fire she could heat up
[1:03:55] the oil and take the meal make it into a
[1:03:58] cake and bake the cake and then eat it
[1:04:00] and it'd be their last meal and then
[1:04:02] wait for death to come
[1:04:06] and Elijah said unto her fear not it's
[1:04:08] the first thing he wants to do
[1:04:10] it's called my fears go and do as thou
[1:04:12] has said
[1:04:13] but make me thereof a little cake first
[1:04:17] and bring it unto me and after make for
[1:04:20] thee and for thy son
[1:04:22] for thus saith the Lord God of Israel
[1:04:25] the barrel of meal shall not waste
[1:04:27] neither shall The Crucible fail until
[1:04:28] the day that the Lord senteth Reign upon
[1:04:30] the Earth
[1:04:31] that's quite a promise
[1:04:33] but notice the the position of things
[1:04:37] that watch was necessary for her
[1:04:39] survival but now there's a message that
[1:04:42] comes and says listen do do that but
[1:04:46] first give me
[1:04:49] do this first and then do this
[1:04:52] and if you will do that you'll be able
[1:04:55] to do this in perpetuity you'll be able
[1:04:57] to keep doing this you're doing this as
[1:04:59] your last meal but if you do this first
[1:05:01] the oil will never run out the meal will
[1:05:04] never run out if you do this first I
[1:05:06] will provide all the oil all the grain I
[1:05:09] will provide everything you need but if
[1:05:11] you'll just do this and some of us just
[1:05:13] keep scraping we keep scraping we keep
[1:05:15] scraping just do this first
[1:05:19] just keep God first
[1:05:20] [Music]
[1:05:23] it says and she went and did according
[1:05:25] to the saint of Elijah she went and did
[1:05:27] what did she do she put the prophet
[1:05:29] first she did what he said first put
[1:05:31] that word first she and he she and he
[1:05:34] and her house did eat many days and the
[1:05:36] phrase is so beautiful and the barrel of
[1:05:38] milk wasted not neither did the
[1:05:39] crucified oil fail according to the Lord
[1:05:42] which he spake by Elijah
[1:05:46] what a challenge to our priorities
[1:05:49] what are what a challenge about the
[1:05:51] necessities
[1:05:52] and what's more important
[1:05:54] does not the Bible say I've esteemed
[1:05:56] your word more necessary than meat
[1:06:01] I believe that if we just go about
[1:06:02] accumulating resources and using them
[1:06:04] they'll run out
[1:06:08] but if you put God first he can bring an
[1:06:10] unmeasurable benefit in him
[1:06:12] unmeasurable
[1:06:16] whatever our labors are
[1:06:19] whatever our
[1:06:22] your salary your wage what you're
[1:06:24] earning what you what you give your
[1:06:26] children the shoes you buy realize when
[1:06:28] the children of Israel were March into
[1:06:30] the promised land The Souls of their
[1:06:31] shoes never wore out
[1:06:37] I know there's an extreme that people
[1:06:39] can put this to
[1:06:42] I know that there's a way that
[1:06:46] maybe maybe it's termed Prosperity
[1:06:49] preaching
[1:06:50] and I know that maybe even the way that
[1:06:52] I'm phrasing it could be uh maybe a
[1:06:54] little I could be a little bit more
[1:06:55] careful in the way I'm saying it you say
[1:06:56] well brother and I do everything I know
[1:06:58] I'm supposed to do and I still struggle
[1:06:59] keep doing what you know what you're
[1:07:01] supposed to do
[1:07:02] it don't change because you're trusting
[1:07:04] God in all of it
[1:07:06] and the way that God dealt with my heart
[1:07:07] I'm just going to read a statement to
[1:07:08] close
[1:07:10] how I just want to close with this and
[1:07:12] then read a quotation from Hebrews
[1:07:14] chapter 2 part 2.
[1:07:18] we ask God to speak
[1:07:21] we're desperate to hear his voice
[1:07:24] some of you have prayed Lord if you if I
[1:07:26] just could hear you speak on a situation
[1:07:29] if I could just know your will know your
[1:07:31] mind
[1:07:32] if you'll just tell me what to do
[1:07:36] we've purposed in our hearts that this
[1:07:38] year is going to be the year that
[1:07:42] and we speak very particularly with God
[1:07:45] and we express to him how you know I
[1:07:47] don't I don't like the way things have
[1:07:49] been
[1:07:50] and in in this expression of wanting God
[1:07:53] to speak and for God to come on the
[1:07:54] scene and do something we want things to
[1:07:56] change
[1:07:57] something needs to be different can't
[1:07:59] keep going like this
[1:08:01] and we're asking God to speak and what
[1:08:03] I'm telling you this morning he already
[1:08:04] has
[1:08:07] I know this may be very particular to
[1:08:09] somebody a particular very specific and
[1:08:10] I'm not saying that by prior knowledge
[1:08:12] I'm saying it as the Lord speaks to my
[1:08:13] heart somebody if you're if you're we
[1:08:16] want God to speak we want God to speak
[1:08:17] but I'm reminding you he already has
[1:08:21] if you want His blessings if you want
[1:08:22] his leadership if you want things to
[1:08:24] change I want this to be the last year
[1:08:25] that this happens I want I don't like
[1:08:27] this I don't like there's all these
[1:08:28] things that maybe we're considering if
[1:08:30] we want things to change he's already
[1:08:32] told us what his will is
[1:08:36] in the year in preview if you put God
[1:08:37] first to talk about a preview
[1:08:39] if you put God first he'll make
[1:08:41] provision for the year's demands
[1:08:43] this is what Elijah was doing for this
[1:08:45] woman he was given her year in preview
[1:08:46] if you just make me a cake first your
[1:08:49] oil will never run out and the the the
[1:08:51] meal will never run out that was a
[1:08:52] preview
[1:08:54] and brother Branham picks it up in
[1:08:56] Hebrews chapter 2 verse part two
[1:08:59] let's remember that it's Jesus Christ
[1:09:01] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:09:02] confirming his word
[1:09:04] we must do it
[1:09:06] oh please do it take heed let every
[1:09:10] other thing be secondary
[1:09:13] even your home your husband your wife
[1:09:16] your children
[1:09:17] whatever it may be put it second place
[1:09:21] God first
[1:09:24] you say brother Branham over my children
[1:09:26] over anything
[1:09:29] and this to me is really challenging
[1:09:32] because there's a lot of decisions we
[1:09:33] make in light of our children or because
[1:09:35] of our children or for the sake of our
[1:09:37] children and we're not thinking that
[1:09:39] it's it's not even what's best for our
[1:09:41] children because it's at the expense of
[1:09:43] putting God first
[1:09:46] over anything Place God first let him be
[1:09:49] first Elijah come off the mountain one
[1:09:52] day he was an angel a messenger God's
[1:09:53] messenger anointed and he found a widow
[1:09:55] woman picking up two sticks he said go
[1:09:57] back and bake a little cake and fetch me
[1:09:58] a little water and she said as your soul
[1:10:00] liveth I have not just enough cakes or
[1:10:01] enough wheat dough to make one little
[1:10:03] pancake and I just have enough oil to go
[1:10:05] in to mix it up for shortening and I'm
[1:10:07] picking up two sticks
[1:10:09] think about this dire situation
[1:10:12] and then Elijah says and she said I'm
[1:10:14] going to cook a little cake for me and
[1:10:15] my boy and my baby and we're going to
[1:10:17] eat it and die there had been a drought
[1:10:19] for three years and six months no water
[1:10:21] anywhere that Stern old Prophet looked
[1:10:23] that woman in the face and said go bake
[1:10:25] me a cake first what a command for a man
[1:10:28] to tell a widow woman starve into death
[1:10:30] to feed him first what did he say for
[1:10:33] thus saith the Lord the barrel will
[1:10:34] never go empty nor The Cruise dry until
[1:10:37] God sends rain upon the Earth
[1:10:40] this was not I guess there's a way to
[1:10:43] look at this and maybe try to take play
[1:10:44] Deadpool's Advocate with this well how
[1:10:46] demanding that is of this prophet and
[1:10:48] how crude this is of God to do this but
[1:10:51] God wants himself to be made known in
[1:10:53] circumstances so he orchestrates things
[1:10:55] that may puzzle the the the mind of
[1:10:58] somebody who wants equality in the mind
[1:10:59] of the person who thinks what's fair but
[1:11:01] he does it to make himself known and we
[1:11:04] may think that Elijah was the object in
[1:11:06] this particular situation but really the
[1:11:08] Widow of Zarephath was because God had
[1:11:11] ordained the woman and she was to make
[1:11:14] him a cake it only says to make him one
[1:11:17] cake and if she made him a cake first it
[1:11:20] would never run out and so God provided
[1:11:23] a means to bless her
[1:11:25] [Music]
[1:11:26] it was really for her
[1:11:29] I think so much just forgive me I just
[1:11:31] feel to say this we can put so much
[1:11:34] emphasis in trying to lift up the voice
[1:11:36] of God and lift up the messenger lift up
[1:11:39] brother Branham and keep his message
[1:11:41] alive it ain't for brother Branham it
[1:11:44] ain't to lift up a man it's for the
[1:11:46] bride the reason why we make this Bible
[1:11:49] available the reason why we want the
[1:11:51] word to be available is not to lift up a
[1:11:54] man but it's for the person that the
[1:11:56] word is sin to it's for the recipient
[1:12:01] he says first God
[1:12:04] she went in and baked that little cake
[1:12:06] and come and give it to the prophet went
[1:12:08] right back and baked another one and
[1:12:09] another one and another and another
[1:12:11] and the barrel never went empty and the
[1:12:13] or the crews dry until God sent rain on
[1:12:15] the Earth
[1:12:17] listen now she put God before her
[1:12:20] children
[1:12:22] she put God before anything else
[1:12:25] she taken the kingdom of God first
[1:12:28] that's what she's demonstrating by this
[1:12:31] and you wonder well will there be enough
[1:12:33] resources there always will be
[1:12:37] it's God's will
[1:12:39] and he's obligated to look after it
[1:12:42] if it's your will to go climb Mount
[1:12:43] Humphrey and that's what you want to do
[1:12:45] Humphrey's Peak whatever it is that's
[1:12:47] what you want to do train train all you
[1:12:49] can prepare prepare prepare right put
[1:12:52] all the hard work and and you better
[1:12:54] make sure you take care of all the
[1:12:55] resources but if God wants you to do
[1:12:58] something he will equip you and he will
[1:12:59] make a way
[1:13:02] God must he says God must have first
[1:13:05] place in your heart first place in your
[1:13:06] life first place in everything that you
[1:13:08] do or what you are God must be first I
[1:13:10] know it seems really simple but this is
[1:13:12] the truth
[1:13:13] he doesn't want the second place he
[1:13:16] doesn't deserve the second place he
[1:13:19] deserves the best and the first and all
[1:13:21] that we got he deserves it Blessed Be
[1:13:24] His holy name
[1:13:27] this is the will of God for us this year
[1:13:30] he says not what men say what the church
[1:13:33] said but what God's will was
[1:13:35] all we need to seek the will of God
[1:13:39] not the favor of your neighbor not the
[1:13:41] favor of your children not the favor of
[1:13:43] your husband or your wife but seek the
[1:13:44] will of God do that first and here's the
[1:13:48] great lesson then everything else the
[1:13:51] will of the wife and the will of the
[1:13:52] children will fall right in with it but
[1:13:55] Place God first
[1:13:57] I love this challenge if there's been
[1:13:59] any reason why we haven't fully done
[1:14:01] what God wants us to do in these six
[1:14:03] areas if we haven't been embracing them
[1:14:05] and doing them and putting God first and
[1:14:08] fulfilling God's word in our lives and
[1:14:09] if we've been worried about what will
[1:14:11] happen to the kids worried about what
[1:14:12] will happen with the wife worried about
[1:14:13] what the spouse will think it says it
[1:14:15] right here that if you will put God's
[1:14:17] first the will of the wife and the will
[1:14:19] of the children will fall right in line
[1:14:21] with it sometimes the very things that
[1:14:24] you think will be the most resistant and
[1:14:26] be your opposition will become your
[1:14:28] greatest benefit and support when you
[1:14:30] begin to do what God wants you to do
[1:14:34] I don't know why I'm reminded it but
[1:14:35] brother Chris remember when he came back
[1:14:37] from that men's meeting that one year
[1:14:38] and remember he told she said I'm going
[1:14:40] home and I'm going to have to talk to my
[1:14:41] family we're going back over a decade
[1:14:43] ago and we're thinking wow he's going
[1:14:45] home God had got to hold him he said I'm
[1:14:46] gonna go back and make changes and I
[1:14:48] began to think in my mind oh my goodness
[1:14:49] this is going to ruffle some feathers
[1:14:51] this is going to be real interesting a
[1:14:52] few hours later I get a sister Elizabeth
[1:14:54] gets a text message from Sister Valerie
[1:14:56] she said you won't believe it the most
[1:14:58] wonderful things are happening God is
[1:14:59] doing the things amazing and all the
[1:15:01] boys are on board with it too and
[1:15:02] everybody was excited and everybody was
[1:15:04] ready to take that next step why because
[1:15:06] somebody stepped into their place
[1:15:08] somebody got in their position somebody
[1:15:10] said I gotta do what God wants me to do
[1:15:13] God first for my life everything else
[1:15:16] second even if it means my kids and my
[1:15:18] wife
[1:15:19] they say wow this is a misogynistic God
[1:15:22] no God knows that's what's best for your
[1:15:26] kids and your wife
[1:15:29] please
[1:15:30] God
[1:15:31] first
[1:15:33] let's stand
