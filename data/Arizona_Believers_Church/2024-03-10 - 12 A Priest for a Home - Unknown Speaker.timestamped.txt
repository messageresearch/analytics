[0:00] reading there in Exodus chapter 12 it's
[0:02] really a remarkable occurrence and then
[0:05] as you continue to read it says that it
[0:07] came to pass at midnight that the Lord
[0:09] did Smite the firstborn the land of
[0:11] Egypt and in the house of pharaoh and so
[0:14] these very things that were spoken of
[0:16] are coming to pass and transpiring just
[0:19] exactly as the Lord said it would and I
[0:21] want to draw from that and you'll catch
[0:24] this just earlier in the chapter I want
[0:25] to draw from that a title a priest for a
[0:28] home a PRI for a home as we're been
[0:31] speaking on the house of the Lord and
[0:34] talking about the man of the home for a
[0:36] couple services and building up uh the
[0:38] man's role in the house of the Lord
[0:40] which your home should be a home that's
[0:41] dedicated to the Lord and if you look at
[0:43] Ephesians chapter 5 I just want to
[0:45] review just a few things from last
[0:47] Sunday uh Paul identifies the man's
[0:50] headship within the family as that which
[0:52] is like Christ to his body so that's a
[0:55] the most extraordinary um example that
[0:57] he could give us it's the highest
[0:59] example and so that kind of should catch
[1:01] our attentions that if the man is to be
[1:03] the head he's to be the head as Christ
[1:05] is to the church and Paul says it this
[1:07] way for the husband is the head of the
[1:09] wife even as Christ is the head of the
[1:12] church and he is the savior of the body
[1:16] that savior the deliverer the preserver
[1:18] he's the one who keeps safe and sound
[1:20] and he's the one that makes well so it's
[1:22] a real active role to be the head to be
[1:24] the head is doesn't mean the body
[1:26] supports you and the body lifts you up
[1:28] and the body serves the head rather the
[1:30] head is the lifegiver it is the one that
[1:32] makes well and keeps safe and sound and
[1:35] he says as Christ even as Christ it's a
[1:38] phrase that he uses a few times it gives
[1:40] that man a place in the family which is
[1:42] like the role of Jesus to the church a
[1:45] and that that should get our attentions
[1:47] as I'm wanting to emphasize over and
[1:49] over should cause us to think wow this
[1:51] this role as a head this role as a man
[1:53] as a husband as a father is very uh uh
[1:56] very sobering very serious and we've
[1:59] seen how brother random teaches us that
[2:00] scripturally the head of the wife and
[2:03] the head of the family is not a dictator
[2:05] but he is a servant and he's one he's a
[2:07] giver the scripture says he's a
[2:09] sanctifier he's a nourisher these are
[2:11] the things he's a washer he's a cleanser
[2:13] this is what the head does and we saw
[2:16] this example in Jesus in John Chapter 13
[2:19] veres 4 and 5 there in this communion
[2:21] Scene It says he riseth from supper and
[2:23] laid aside his garments and took a towel
[2:26] and girded himself that he pth water
[2:29] into a base and begin to wash the
[2:31] disciples feet and to wipe them with the
[2:33] towel wherewith he was GED and when he
[2:36] has accomplished this he instructs the
[2:38] disciples to do this to one to another
[2:40] and happy are you if he do these things
[2:42] and he's teaching them that you say that
[2:44] I your lord and I'm your master and I'm
[2:46] your teacher and he says you say well
[2:47] cuz I am but as I have kneeled before
[2:50] you and washed your feet and Peter even
[2:52] instinctively said whoa what would you
[2:54] be doing washing my feet I I should be
[2:56] washing your feet uh he instructs them
[2:59] to do the same thing and he and he
[3:01] teaches him to be servants and to be
[3:03] minded uh just as the son of man came to
[3:05] serve not to be served we should have
[3:07] the same kind of mind to give service
[3:09] and to serve and to give of ourselves
[3:12] and and this is that roll of a head
[3:14] within a family he knelt to wash the
[3:16] disciples feet and to wipe them he
[3:18] humbled himself to those that he was uh
[3:21] teaching and those he was leading and
[3:23] those he was guiding and that's an
[3:25] important characteristic for any husband
[3:27] and father for any man is the ability to
[3:28] get beneath somebody else uh to Humble
[3:31] themselves and be willing to be a
[3:32] servant uh we've seen even it's
[3:34] emphasized in some of the ministers that
[3:36] come through and ministered how that uh
[3:38] uh brother brandham uh took upon that
[3:40] role even within his own home to put on
[3:42] the apron and start to do dishes and
[3:44] just approach the atmosphere differently
[3:46] approach the scene differently than just
[3:48] saying well bless God I'm going to take
[3:50] control here and so it's important just
[3:52] to recognize those attributes of a real
[3:55] a servant a real head and we were
[3:57] reading I think this might have been
[3:58] some of the last things we read in John
[4:00] chap
[4:01] 17: 171 18 and 19 Jesus praying says
[4:05] sanctify them through thy truth now
[4:07] these disciples whose feet he washed and
[4:10] who he served and taught and led he says
[4:12] sanctify them through thy truth Thy word
[4:15] is truth then he says as thou Hast sent
[4:17] me into the world even so have I also
[4:20] sent them into the world now it's
[4:22] important to kind of connect those two
[4:23] verses together because in John chapter
[4:25] 10 believe it's verse 36 he says say ye
[4:28] of the one whom the father hath
[4:30] Sanctified and sent into the world so
[4:33] he's saying of his own self that the
[4:35] father Sanctified him before he sent him
[4:37] into the world and that's the role of a
[4:40] father you have an opportunity with your
[4:41] children you have an opportunity before
[4:43] they leave the home to sanctify them
[4:45] before they're sent out so now he's
[4:48] doing the same thing with his disciples
[4:49] he's saying sanctify them just as you've
[4:52] Sanctified me and sent me into the world
[4:54] sanctify them and he says and for their
[4:57] sakes I sanctify myself that they also
[5:01] might be Sanctified through the truth
[5:04] this is that example of a real a real
[5:07] head who is a giver and a sanctifier of
[5:09] the body uh the sanctifier of a wife and
[5:12] family this is a perfect example of that
[5:15] he says I sanctify myself that they
[5:17] might be Sanctified through the truth
[5:20] very clearly he's saiding he could say
[5:22] you sanctify them Lord and and have them
[5:24] to be Sanctified and and have this image
[5:26] and this idea that those that you're
[5:28] leading and teaching and he need to be
[5:30] Sanctified but he recognized that if I'm
[5:32] not Sanctified myself they can't be
[5:34] Sanctified so he's willing to kind of
[5:36] own it himself and brother Bram says he
[5:38] was training 12 men that were going to
[5:41] take the gospel to all the world so he
[5:43] Sanctified himself for their sake I
[5:46] sanctify myself for their sake a gift of
[5:48] God keeping himself Sanctified and and
[5:51] just keying in on that language he was
[5:53] training 12 men that were going to take
[5:55] the gospel to the world and so because
[5:58] he was training someone else to do more
[6:01] to do greater to go out into all the
[6:02] world and to preach the gospel because
[6:04] they were to take the message and
[6:06] further it he Sanctified himself so that
[6:09] they could be Sanctified because he was
[6:11] training them and brother Bram says
[6:13] youth men and women for tomorrow if
[6:15] there is a tomorrow we must train them
[6:18] Lord he says we feel that burden to
[6:20] train them like there will be a tomorrow
[6:23] and so we we ought to be forward looking
[6:24] thinking that that uh there will be a
[6:26] tomorrow and if there is a tomorrow we
[6:28] want to have leaders and we want to have
[6:29] husbands and wives and we want to have
[6:31] those that can step into these
[6:32] scriptural roles and Lead appropriately
[6:35] so we feel a burden to train as if there
[6:37] will be a tomorrow and if we're going to
[6:40] be training we ourselves need to be
[6:42] Sanctified for the sake of those that
[6:44] were
[6:45] training and so as we see some of these
[6:48] things the the Father the husband takes
[6:49] the place of Christ in the home and what
[6:52] I'm wanting to look at today is he
[6:54] serves the role as priest in his home to
[6:57] make it a house of the Lord right you
[6:59] should have this mindset and and some of
[7:01] these uh types of the priest in the
[7:04] house of God he serves the same function
[7:06] within his own home the husband is the
[7:08] spiritual head and pastor of the home
[7:10] and of the family it's what brother
[7:12] Brown teaches us I'm I'm not the pastor
[7:15] of your home I'm a pastor of a church
[7:17] but the husbands those heads in their
[7:18] homes they are to be the the spiritual
[7:20] head and pastor of their home their wife
[7:22] and their family and so today I'm just
[7:25] want to emphasize along this theme the
[7:27] father is the priest of the home the
[7:29] husband is the priest of the home and as
[7:32] that he has to be Sanctified first as
[7:35] the head and Leviticus chapter 10: 8 to
[7:38] 11 and the Lord spake unto Aaron saying
[7:41] do not drink wine nor strong drink thou
[7:43] nor thy Sons with thee when you go into
[7:46] the Tabernacle of the congregation lest
[7:47] you die shall be a statute forever
[7:50] throughout your generation so this is a
[7:52] requirement upon the priesthood that
[7:54] they not take strong drink and there's a
[7:56] tremendous consequence for doing it they
[7:58] would die with which let's just look at
[8:00] it this way it means they wouldn't be
[8:01] able to do what they're supposed to do
[8:03] and he says and that ye may put
[8:04] difference between holy and Unholy and
[8:07] between unclean and clean so they
[8:10] themselves needed to be Sanctified a a
[8:13] and to be holy because they're going to
[8:15] be putting a difference between holy and
[8:17] Unholy they're going to be determining
[8:19] clean and unclean so they had to First
[8:22] be the first partakers of that in their
[8:25] own lives verse 11 and that ye may teach
[8:27] the children of Israel all the statutes
[8:29] with the Lord which the Lord hath spoken
[8:32] unto them by the hand of Moses so we
[8:35] could take away from this that a priest
[8:37] is to go into the Tabernacle of the
[8:39] congregation he is to put a difference
[8:41] between holy and Unholy clean and
[8:43] unclean and he's to teach the children
[8:45] of Israel all the statutes this
[8:47] scripture tells us some of the roles of
[8:49] the priesthood a and the functions that
[8:52] they might take within the house of the
[8:54] Lord but then we realize because they
[8:56] have that responsibility these verses
[8:58] are telling us that they are to
[9:00] themselves be Sanctified in Leviticus
[9:03] 21:6 and you can go back to these
[9:05] chapters and find uh much broader
[9:08] descriptions and requirements it says
[9:10] this of the priest they shall be holy
[9:12] unto their God in not profane the name
[9:15] of their God for the offerings of the
[9:17] Lord made by fire and the bread of their
[9:19] God they do offer therefore they shall
[9:21] be
[9:22] holy think of that it's clean hands
[9:25] holding a clean sacrifice uh Clean Hands
[9:28] uh holding and cleansing and purifying
[9:30] clean utensils and the instruments
[9:33] within the Tabernacle they shall be holy
[9:35] they shall not profane the name of the
[9:36] Lord because the offerings that they
[9:38] make and the bread that they give they
[9:40] they are also holy they're to be offered
[9:43] and to be Sanctified and their these
[9:46] offerings being made for Israel and all
[9:47] the different ceremony that's attached
[9:49] with these offerings and these
[9:50] sacrifices they were to themselves be
[9:53] Sanctified because they were going to be
[9:55] presenting sacrifices clean before the
[9:58] Lord to be accepted by God and that
[10:00] that's required of priest in the Old
[10:02] Testament and so I'm I'm saying to you
[10:05] today what I'm using as a type is that
[10:07] if we are going to be priests within our
[10:08] homes we too have the same requirements
[10:11] that we sanctify ourselves first in
[10:13] order to do the service that we ought to
[10:15] do properly in our marriages and our
[10:17] families in Romans 12:1 he says I
[10:20] beseech you therefore Brethren by the
[10:22] mercies of God that you present your
[10:24] bodies a Living Sacrifice holy
[10:27] acceptable unto God which is your
[10:29] reasonable service he's actually using a
[10:32] language that the Jews would have used
[10:33] of a priest and said wow they are to
[10:35] present sacrifices and they're to be
[10:37] holy and God's to accept them and that's
[10:39] their service their their reasonable
[10:41] service it's what they're called to do
[10:43] but now he brings us into the priesthood
[10:45] ourselves but not just to offer up
[10:48] sacrifices but to actually offer up
[10:50] ourselves and that's where it's so
[10:52] amazing as Christ is entered in behind
[10:55] the veil himself the high priest himself
[10:58] the sacrifice
[10:59] and and he entered into the holy of
[11:01] holies once uh there pred in heaven with
[11:03] the blood of the sacrifice and forever
[11:06] consecrated in a way that we too in the
[11:08] same way could present ourselves covered
[11:10] in the blood as a sacrifice uh but also
[11:13] as a
[11:14] priest and so we are to present our
[11:17] bodies as a Living Sacrifice holy
[11:19] acceptable unto God which is your
[11:20] reasonable service so this would go for
[11:22] these young men who aren't even uh
[11:24] parents yet they're not even priests in
[11:26] their own home but they're priest in
[11:27] training and they're to present their
[11:30] bodies as a Living Sacrifice which is
[11:32] their reasonable
[11:33] Service as we'll be calling to Exodus 12
[11:38] as we read in there and it speaks of how
[11:41] that Moses told the children of Israel
[11:43] to draw out a lamb a and to take that
[11:46] lamb and to bleed it out and and they're
[11:48] going to slay it and the blood is going
[11:50] to be put into a basin then they're to
[11:51] take the hisp and use that to apply the
[11:55] blood to the doorpost and the lentil
[11:56] brother B talks about how it creates
[11:58] that a
[11:59] cross and even how that blood would be
[12:02] dripping down even upon the threshold
[12:03] and so if you left you'd be stepping
[12:05] over the blood there's a lot of a lot
[12:07] there in that imagery and so even
[12:09] drawing from this place in the scripture
[12:13] brother bam says in the sermon Israel
[12:15] and the church part three the father was
[12:17] the priest of the house in the old time
[12:20] now before uh they had the Tabernacle in
[12:23] the wilderness before they had
[12:24] established the priesthood the man the
[12:27] father is the priest in the house house
[12:29] so which came first the man in the home
[12:32] not the priest in the Temple and so the
[12:34] priest in the temple moded after the
[12:36] modeled after the original the man in
[12:38] the home the priest was the the father
[12:40] was the priest in the old time the
[12:42] father always was the priest and he had
[12:45] to watch over his household what a
[12:48] change today the kids watch over the dad
[12:51] in the modern world but the father was
[12:54] to watch over his house he killed the
[12:56] lamb he took the hisp and put it on the
[12:58] doors and on the the lentil and that was
[13:00] their
[13:02] protection it was the father's
[13:04] responsibility to apply the token and
[13:07] implying the token to the house it was
[13:10] for their protection and one of the one
[13:13] of the things that stands out to me so
[13:15] remarkably when brother Brandon preaches
[13:16] the token is in the scripture applying
[13:19] the token was literally the blood to the
[13:21] doorpost in the lintle but brother
[13:23] brandham identifies that there was a
[13:25] greater sanctification taking place on
[13:28] the inside then just the sign on the
[13:30] outside and he always tied the getting
[13:32] rid of all the leav out of the house to
[13:34] applying the token today kick the trash
[13:37] out get all the leaven out and it was
[13:39] all done for the family's protection if
[13:43] the blood wasn't on the doorpost in the
[13:44] lento then that that that Death Angel
[13:47] would visit that home and take the life
[13:50] of their child so the the dad was
[13:53] responsible for hearing what the prophet
[13:55] said doing exactly what the prophet said
[13:58] not only for his own protection but for
[14:00] the protection of the family and he was
[14:02] doing this exercising the role of a
[14:05] priest within his
[14:07] home for the family's protection in
[14:10] Exodus 12:3 it says Speak ye unto all
[14:13] the congregation of Israel now this is
[14:14] God giving the original instructions
[14:16] saying in the 10th day of this month
[14:18] they shall take to them every man a lamb
[14:22] according to the house of their fathers
[14:24] a lamb for a house so every house had to
[14:28] have a lamb and they speak if a house
[14:30] isn't large enough or they you know they
[14:32] you could take one and households could
[14:34] come together and assemble together but
[14:36] it says a house each man according to
[14:39] the house of their fathers and this is
[14:40] the way that Israel would have been
[14:41] arranged uh literally according to their
[14:43] household their family name but it says
[14:45] a lamb for a house and if every house
[14:49] had to have a lamb then it required a
[14:51] priest in every
[14:53] home a lamb for a house and a priest in
[14:56] every house that's where I came with the
[14:57] title a priest priest for a home a lamb
[14:59] for a house requires a priest in the
[15:01] home to sanctify to pull out to prepare
[15:05] and to offer that sacrifice to cook it
[15:08] properly to apply the blood that's the
[15:11] role of the priest in the home today in
[15:14] First Peter chapter 2:5 it says ye also
[15:17] as Lively stones are built up a
[15:19] spiritual house now I know maybe the
[15:21] emphasis is uh more on the man and the
[15:23] husband and the father but I hope you
[15:25] all realize that in Romans chapter 12 1
[15:27] Peter 2 he's not just speaking to the
[15:28] man he's speaking to all of us to
[15:30] Children men and women brothers and
[15:32] sisters uh uh ladies and gentlemen each
[15:34] one alike your Lively stones are built
[15:37] up a spiritual house so we are his house
[15:40] and a holy priesthood you are the Temple
[15:43] of the Holy Ghost you're the priest in
[15:45] the temple a priesthood to offer up
[15:47] spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
[15:50] by Jesus Christ so just as in the days
[15:53] of the Exodus uh there was a a lamb for
[15:56] a house and a priest in each house who
[15:58] would administer that sacrifice and be
[16:00] sure that all the instructions are
[16:01] followed we should realize today as the
[16:04] body of Jesus Christ we are called to be
[16:06] a holy priesthood God said that Israel
[16:09] would be a kingdom of priests not just
[16:11] Levites set apart within the whole
[16:13] nation of Israel but to think they all
[16:15] were to be Kingdom a a kingdom of priest
[16:19] a holy priesthood it says in the this is
[16:21] maybe just a phrase for you to chew on a
[16:23] little bit this week a royal priesthood
[16:26] what a combination of titles and offices
[16:29] a royal priesthood strict division
[16:31] between the king the throne and the
[16:33] temple and the priest but now you have a
[16:35] royal priesthood the Bible having made
[16:38] us Kings and Priests to offer up
[16:41] spiritual sacrifices to present our
[16:43] bodies a Living Sacrifice that's our
[16:45] reasonable service it's what we are due
[16:47] to give
[16:48] God so as in The Exodus they were to
[16:51] gather every man to his house and to
[16:52] take out a lamb a lamb for a house if
[16:55] there's going to be a lamb in the house
[16:56] there has to be a priest in that house
[16:59] and that lamb even for us today there
[17:01] should be Christ should be at the center
[17:02] of our house there should be those that
[17:04] are leading in that home to point to
[17:06] Christ and give an
[17:07] example says in Exodus 12:1 15 and we
[17:12] could make the we could take time to
[17:14] establish the type that we're in the
[17:15] Third Exodus and in this Exodus that we
[17:18] want to have Christ at the center to
[17:20] have the preeminence in Exodus 12:15 it
[17:24] says seven days shall you eat unleavened
[17:26] bread even the first day shall put away
[17:29] leaven out of your houses for whosoever
[17:31] eateth leavened bread from the first day
[17:34] until the until the seventh day that
[17:36] Soul shall be cut off from
[17:39] Israel if you eat leaven bread your
[17:42] Soul's going to be cut off so God's
[17:45] solution this is the wisdom of a real
[17:46] father God's solution was not to have uh
[17:50] countertops full of wonderfully leaven
[17:53] bread with icing on it and raisins and
[17:55] dates and everything else and no don't
[17:57] touch you you got to wait a few days
[17:59] amen don't touch it but it was to get
[18:01] all the leaven out to to ensure their
[18:05] protection and so the responsibility was
[18:07] on the heads of the house to guard
[18:09] against potential failure go and since
[18:12] you can't eat leaven bread God instructs
[18:14] the heads of the home as brother mam
[18:15] says to apply the token and get all the
[18:17] leaven out for the protection of anyone
[18:20] who would make the mistake of eating
[18:22] leaven bread even if they didn't do it
[18:24] willfully even if they didn't do it
[18:26] knowingly it's if they ate leaven bread
[18:28] during that time period that Soul would
[18:29] be cut off from from from God and so God
[18:33] said be proactive in this I'm kind of
[18:35] maybe seing some things that we'll get
[18:36] to next Sunday and because of the
[18:39] consequences do things now upfront to
[18:42] guard against potential destruction and
[18:45] failure and Corruption by getting all
[18:47] the leaven out and brother man it
[18:50] teaches us that that's part of applying
[18:52] the token get all the trash out apply
[18:54] the token to your home so there's the
[18:56] witness of Christ on the outside the
[18:58] blood's been applied the doorpost and
[18:59] lentil displaying Christ on the outside
[19:02] but inside the home your the feet were
[19:03] shawed they were dressed they were
[19:05] prepared the lamb was boiled that was
[19:07] prepared exactly or the the lamb was
[19:09] prepared exactly the way it was supposed
[19:11] to be not this way not that be they were
[19:13] going to eat all of
[19:14] it this is a way that they were to uh uh
[19:17] uh they were preparing themselves on the
[19:19] inside and there had to be those that
[19:21] were diligent to look after the way the
[19:23] home was to be ordered to see that it
[19:25] would be fulfilled because the
[19:26] consequences were pretty high
[19:29] that Soul would be cut off from Israel
[19:31] brother brandom says in God's provided
[19:33] way in December 53 every father that day
[19:36] was a priest of his own family and it
[19:39] was up to each individual family to kill
[19:41] a lamb notice how brother Bram is
[19:43] identifying in that day the husband the
[19:46] father was the priest in the home there
[19:48] was a lamb for a home there was a priest
[19:50] for a home to kill that lamb and to
[19:53] dress it and to serve it and to eat it
[19:55] and to put the blood upon the doorpost
[19:57] of little and to get all the leav out of
[19:59] the home that was the responsibility of
[20:01] the father in that day he says it again
[20:04] in June of that year I can look he's
[20:07] describing how this Death Angel would be
[20:08] passing through coming back through
[20:10] yonder I can see two big black wings
[20:12] spread out Across the Nation here it
[20:14] comes I can hear the priest of the
[20:16] family the father say there's the death
[20:19] angel sweeping the land now too late now
[20:22] so there's the priest in the home making
[20:24] this declaration and directly I can see
[20:27] him go dip down into the valley and hear
[20:29] a scream come up from out of that house
[20:31] the son was dead he's talking about this
[20:33] Death Angel swooping through and he went
[20:35] directly here he comes right down to
[20:36] another house again goes in the big
[20:38] black wings close in around the house
[20:40] the screen comes up the sun is dead and
[20:43] he says I can hear the little boy say
[20:45] daddy take another look be sure the
[20:48] blood's on there oh could you imagine I
[20:52] maybe you can enter into this scene
[20:54] because it's real we believe our Bibles
[20:56] and maybe because it's been dramatized
[20:57] by CE will be de Mills or something but
[21:00] I want you to think about this how real
[21:02] it would have been for the first born of
[21:03] that house to hear the screams going up
[21:06] all over Egypt and all over and as
[21:08] brother B's describing you can maybe see
[21:10] a a a a the black wings shroud itself
[21:13] over a house and the cries go up and the
[21:15] Sun dies and then it got real for that
[21:18] sun for that whole family all of a
[21:20] sudden like whoa that escalated quickly
[21:23] we kind of like well I mean these are
[21:24] just spiritual types and we'll just have
[21:26] a spiritual dry spell and you know we'll
[21:28] get out of this and we'll get back into
[21:30] gear and we'll start doing the things we
[21:31] know we ought to do and we'll make it by
[21:33] God's grace all of a sudden it got real
[21:35] whenever people are dying and people are
[21:36] screaming you can see the death angel
[21:38] passing through and the father who would
[21:41] have had to have applied the blood the
[21:42] boy looks at his dad and says Dad take
[21:44] another look are you sure it's
[21:48] there please dad tell me and he says son
[21:51] you would hope that he'd be able to say
[21:53] son don't worry the blood's there amen I
[21:56] I I applied it I I I made sure I
[21:58] understood what God told Moses I made
[21:59] sure that I knew exactly what we were
[22:01] supposed to do it it it's applied Daddy
[22:04] can I go out and check no son you can't
[22:05] go
[22:06] out you can't go out if you cross out
[22:09] you got to wait till the morning the
[22:10] blood's applied but it was very serious
[22:12] in that moment the priest was then
[22:14] responsible for the the life of his
[22:19] son daddy take another look and be sure
[22:21] the blood's there my what a what a
[22:25] startling
[22:26] dramatization he says a father was the
[22:29] priest of the family he says that's the
[22:32] way it was in Old Time the father was
[22:34] always the priest and had watch over his
[22:36] family and he says what a change today
[22:38] and he's not uh recommending it and he's
[22:42] not saying there this is a needful
[22:44] change he's saying it's the wrong kind
[22:46] of
[22:47] change where the fathers aren't as
[22:49] diligent as they should
[22:51] be there's even a time maybe where
[22:54] that's what's portrayed and there was a
[22:55] season maybe where the father was aloof
[22:57] he was a bread wi or he was out working
[22:59] all day and came home and he just wanted
[23:00] to have his cigar read the paper and eat
[23:02] dinner and go to bed uh and it was the
[23:04] mother who is domesticated working with
[23:06] the children and a and always there
[23:09] present with them and and just because
[23:11] that's the way it was when in America's
[23:12] good old days and maybe there was
[23:14] something that was glorified on TV
[23:15] doesn't mean that's the way that the the
[23:17] message teaches it or that's the way
[23:19] that we ought to do it ourselves because
[23:21] the way that we as uh fathers and heads
[23:23] of homes ought to be present ought to be
[23:25] mindful ought to be engaged h and take
[23:28] responsibility
[23:30] amen here is he said that to get all the
[23:33] leaven out of the house to be sure the
[23:35] blood is applied and Romans chapter 13:
[23:38] 13 and
[23:40] 14 and I'm with just what I have here
[23:44] kind of maybe Veer just a little bit uh
[23:46] into a particular area but I want this
[23:49] to hold for a little bit because it's
[23:51] it's points to something that's very
[23:53] very
[23:54] important he says let us walk honestly
[23:57] as in the day not in rioting and
[23:59] drunkenness not in chambering and
[24:00] wanness not in strife and envy and
[24:02] there's your instructions for this week
[24:04] avoid rioting drunkenness chambering
[24:06] wanness strife and envy and if you could
[24:08] avoid those and all their applications
[24:10] you you got a pretty good head start but
[24:12] these are things that were to be honest
[24:14] not uh rioting drunken chambering
[24:16] wanting Strife envy and I found myself
[24:18] maybe potentially getting losted what do
[24:20] those those things mean and how they
[24:22] present he says but put ye on the Lord
[24:24] Jesus Christ and there's the there's the
[24:26] real kicker put him on on and make not
[24:30] provision for the flesh to fulfill the
[24:32] lust thereof now what a statement put on
[24:36] Christ and do not make provision for the
[24:39] flesh because if you provide for the
[24:41] flesh you will fulfill the lust of the
[24:44] flesh so there's a lot to this to put on
[24:47] Christ and having put on Christ who is
[24:50] that high priest now we're in the image
[24:51] of the priest we're in the image of
[24:53] Christ and in that we're not going to
[24:56] provide for the flesh because if we
[24:58] provide for the flesh the flesh will
[25:00] take advantage of the provision and
[25:02] fulfill its lust when it says make not
[25:06] provision for the flesh the word
[25:07] provision there means forethought that
[25:08] providential care uh where you perceive
[25:11] beforehand you force beforehand it Lally
[25:14] means to Pro to see a need and provide
[25:16] or prepare
[25:19] beforehand if you catch
[25:21] that be it it don't provide beforehand
[25:26] things for the flesh
[25:28] but foresee and be proactive about the
[25:31] things that the flesh wants about the
[25:33] things that the flesh gravitates towards
[25:35] put on Christ make not provision have
[25:38] forethought have providential care not
[25:41] to provide these things for the flesh
[25:42] not to be so concerned about the Flesh
[25:45] and and to and to be aware of those
[25:46] things that we provide beforehand to
[25:48] allow the lust of the flesh to be
[25:50] fulfilled in other words make it harder
[25:52] for sin the World the Flesh the devil to
[25:54] have access to your heart and the hearts
[25:57] of your children children make it harder
[26:00] put on Christ and make not provision for
[26:03] the flesh this is what God was
[26:05] instructing the families to do in Exodus
[26:07] chap 12 get all the leaven out have no
[26:09] provision for the
[26:12] Flesh and if I could say this this is I
[26:14] just want to point to this
[26:16] aspect and and use just one example but
[26:20] just know that there's so much more here
[26:21] in this area that you can mine out
[26:23] yourselves within your own family
[26:25] devotions and things but priest had a
[26:27] duty in the old test they had a duty to
[26:29] prepare themselves to prepare the temple
[26:32] and to be proactive they were to protect
[26:35] protect they were to Pro provide as we
[26:37] read already in Leviticus chapter 10 and
[26:39] chapter 21 they were to they were to
[26:42] prepare the people to be holy vessels
[26:44] themselves and because they were
[26:46] preparing the people they were to teach
[26:47] them to know right and wrong they had to
[26:50] administer the sacrifices and the rights
[26:52] of the atonement and all these things
[26:54] required preparation not just in the
[26:56] temple but for for themselves if you
[26:59] could just go and read in some of these
[27:01] places in Leviticus and all the things
[27:02] that were necessary for them to do
[27:04] within the temple you'd find that this
[27:06] is a lot of work there was a lot of
[27:09] things that they had to be mindful of a
[27:10] lot of things that needed to be cleaned
[27:11] a lot of things that needed to be killed
[27:12] a lot of things that had to be prepared
[27:14] and there was a lot of other elements
[27:16] that went with it just beyond the high
[27:17] priest once a year going behind those
[27:19] veils into the most holy Place uh they
[27:22] had tremendous responsibilities so they
[27:25] had to always be prepared they had to be
[27:27] f looking they had to be thinking about
[27:29] what was
[27:30] required brother bam says of of Jesus
[27:34] Christ see him walking up in down in the
[27:35] midst of the church this is him writing
[27:37] in Smyrna chapter 4 the church age book
[27:40] like a father he's looking down upon his
[27:42] family he is the head of his
[27:45] household he is the provider he is the
[27:48] protector so this is the role that we
[27:50] are even as Christ is the head of the
[27:52] church then we we must be as a father uh
[27:55] in our families we've got to be looking
[27:57] after our family as the head of the
[27:58] household we have to be a provider and a
[28:01] protector and that means that we have to
[28:03] have this uh ability in our hearts to
[28:07] foresee things and anticipate things so
[28:11] that we can make not provision for the
[28:13] Flesh in Job chapter 1 verse5 it says
[28:16] and it was so verse four talks about how
[28:19] his children were feasting and drinking
[28:21] says it was so in the days of their
[28:22] feasting were gone about that job sent
[28:25] and Sanctified them we drew a lot from
[28:27] job on Wednesday night I think there's
[28:29] just a lot of beautiful things that you
[28:31] could add into this he says job sent and
[28:33] Sanctified them and Rose up early in the
[28:37] morning he's he's not waiting till the
[28:40] afternoon he's raising up early in the
[28:42] morning and offered burnt offerings
[28:44] according to the number of them all for
[28:46] job said it may be that my sons have
[28:48] sinned and cursed God in their hearts
[28:51] thus did job continually amen job was
[28:55] making preparation brother bradam said
[28:57] this is job rising up early in the
[28:59] morning what what caused him to get up
[29:01] in the early ear early morning it wasn't
[29:03] just because he was an early riser but
[29:05] it says that he knew that his children
[29:06] were feasting and he sent and Sanctified
[29:09] them by rising up early in the morning a
[29:12] and being proactive offering these burnt
[29:14] offerings he said because maybe they've
[29:17] sinned so I want to offer a sacrifice in
[29:21] case something has happened and it said
[29:23] job just didn't do it one time and this
[29:25] is instructive to all of us he didn't
[29:27] just do it once he did it
[29:29] continually this was a proactive
[29:32] sacrifice this is him as a as a dad
[29:34] knowing his children and knowing his
[29:35] family and thinking ahead he was
[29:37] proactive and and he said I want to rise
[29:40] up early I want to put in the hard work
[29:42] I want to do things that are necessary
[29:43] at the beginning just by chance my
[29:45] children may be doing these things may
[29:47] be tempted in this way might be facing
[29:49] things at school might be having
[29:50] difficulties that I don't see I want to
[29:52] send and sanctify them I want to rise up
[29:55] early and offer up the right kind of
[29:56] offerings and I don't want to just do it
[29:58] one time I think it's amazing some
[30:01] people have reduced to applying the
[30:02] token to the family as if it's some sort
[30:04] of
[30:05] seance I applied the token to my famine
[30:08] they just go on and live whatever life
[30:09] they want say whatever they want do
[30:11] whatever they want and never do anything
[30:13] that they ought to be doing for
[30:14] themselves in order to be a a a a beacon
[30:18] of what the token is to their family
[30:23] am because it's more than
[30:26] just applying the token is not just
[30:28] crossing your arms and
[30:31] blinking and somehow placing over them
[30:33] some sort of protection but to apply the
[30:35] tokens
[30:36] active brother B tells us in conflict
[30:39] between God and Satan that Parenthood
[30:40] originated in God and says that God was
[30:43] the first parent and as the first parent
[30:46] he says don't you think he gave his
[30:47] children and provided for them the best
[30:49] thing that could be provided for them he
[30:52] says that God equipped his children this
[30:55] is the role and responsibility of
[30:56] parents Ood to provide the best for your
[30:59] children to equip your children now what
[31:02] did he give give his children in the
[31:03] beginning the word now I don't think you
[31:06] can find anything better as parents
[31:08] today as the Equippers as the ones that
[31:10] guide I don't think you can find
[31:12] anything better today than the word so
[31:14] it's the responsibility of the priest of
[31:16] the home to guide to give to equip to
[31:19] look out over the family to be watching
[31:21] out over their needs to think down the
[31:22] road what is this going to look like in
[31:24] a few years there's some things you
[31:26] could be doing now by rising up early
[31:28] and doing things early on things that
[31:30] you can do now to save yourself some
[31:32] trouble down the
[31:34] road might be getting into a little bit
[31:36] of some of the things I'd like to deal
[31:37] with on being
[31:39] proactive but there's we see this
[31:42] example in
[31:44] job it's the responsibility of a priest
[31:47] of a home to do as Christ did to do as
[31:51] God did to his children the garden to do
[31:52] as Christ did to uh to the church the
[31:55] head the provider The Protector
[31:59] being one that prepares makes
[32:00] preparation for themselves for their
[32:02] families proactive says in Matthew
[32:04] chapter 24: 43 and 44 are you feeling
[32:08] good this morning everybody good
[32:11] wonderful pray for me I I need a little
[32:13] bit extra help this morning had a had a
[32:15] rough week last week he says but Matthew
[32:17] chapter 24: 43 and 44 he says but know
[32:20] this that if the good man of the house
[32:22] had known in what watch the thief would
[32:25] come he would have watched and would not
[32:27] have suffered his house to be broken up
[32:29] now there's a lot that's uh expressed in
[32:32] the good man of the house and brother
[32:34] Bram a lot of places takes that to speak
[32:36] of the Holy Ghost that when a man is
[32:38] delivered of devils that you want to get
[32:41] the good man Faith you want to have the
[32:42] Holy Spirit there to watch out and to
[32:44] keep that one from coming back so
[32:46] there's a lot of things that um very
[32:48] beautiful in this thought of the good
[32:49] man of the house but says the good man
[32:51] of the house if he knew the time the
[32:53] thief was coming he would have been
[32:55] there and met him at the door and said
[32:56] uh uh uh
[32:57] right no no no no no no no you're not
[32:59] coming in here he says therefore be ye
[33:02] also ready but then he says for in such
[33:04] hours you think not the son of man
[33:06] cometh so it's not that we we say well
[33:09] you know what I'm going to wait till
[33:10] they're 13 and then I'm going to be
[33:13] ready or I'm going to wait till they're
[33:14] just about ready to drive and I'm going
[33:15] be ready it it's not telling us as if in
[33:18] this story that if you knew the exact
[33:20] moment the thief was coming you'd be
[33:21] ready he says well it'd be like yeah
[33:24] right we would know so then always be
[33:26] ready
[33:28] that that's what he's saying be be ready
[33:31] it says he would if he would have
[33:32] watched it means give strict attention
[33:34] to it speaks of being cautious to ha to
[33:36] take heed lest through any kind of
[33:39] omission or indolence the house is
[33:41] stripped of its Comforts and its
[33:43] strength in other words give heed to
[33:46] watch out over your house Les because
[33:48] you got lazy and weren't on guard and
[33:51] weren't watching and weren't preparing
[33:53] and weren't forward looking the things
[33:55] that make your house a home the very
[33:57] things that have turned it into a
[33:59] sanctuary the very things that make it
[34:00] happy for your children are the very
[34:02] things that start to be taken
[34:04] away we might think that it's the it's
[34:07] uh the PlayStation and this uh college
[34:09] football game that's coming out this
[34:10] year later by EA Sports and we might
[34:12] think that it's uh uh movie nights and
[34:14] all sorts of entertainments and a lot of
[34:16] things that we do there might be a lot
[34:17] of those things that we're thinking
[34:18] makes the home happy for our children
[34:20] but do you realize it's the atmosphere
[34:22] and the home that our children will like
[34:25] not all the game and all the movies and
[34:26] all the rivality and everything it's the
[34:28] it's the harmony between mother and
[34:30] father it's the connection between
[34:32] parents and their children and it
[34:33] doesn't have to include a lot of the
[34:35] accoutrements of the world and
[34:36] worldliness and entertainment in order
[34:38] for it to be a place that children feel
[34:40] like this is home yeah my friends may do
[34:43] this and they may have have this in
[34:44] their home and they may have that in
[34:45] their home but there's one thing that we
[34:47] have in ours that I can't feel anywhere
[34:49] else and that's a real connection with
[34:50] my parents a real love a real care over
[34:52] my soul a real watching out over my
[34:55] spirit and that's something that we can
[34:56] can cultivate and something we can
[34:58] provide and we don't need to lean on
[35:00] Disney we don't need to lean on EA
[35:02] Sports we don't need to lean on a lot of
[35:03] these other things we can have the most
[35:05] important thing right there in the
[35:07] family where we're looking out after
[35:09] them by keeping the right watch over
[35:11] them and making them feel safe and
[35:14] secure we need to be good men and women
[35:16] of the
[35:17] house brother Bram in the the way to
[35:20] have Fellowship he's talking about job
[35:23] and he's he's speaking very specifically
[35:24] about Job offering up these sacrifices
[35:27] and he says teaching the teaching that I
[35:29] can give he's speaking of his children
[35:30] the teaching that I can give them around
[35:32] the home yet they go out with the
[35:34] worldly
[35:35] crowd he talks about in one place he
[35:38] says uh we have them at home just a
[35:40] couple hours and the school has them the
[35:42] rest of the day and then we just try to
[35:43] get two hours an hour into them on
[35:45] Sunday school on Sunday morning he's
[35:46] like well no wonder the children are a
[35:48] mess the world has them all week long
[35:51] and we only give him 30 minutes in
[35:52] Sunday school and the knee-jerk reaction
[35:55] as parents isn't be like we need longer
[35:57] Sunday
[36:00] school right that's not the answer the
[36:03] answer is wow what are we doing in the
[36:05] evenings how am I sending them off to
[36:07] school what kind of example and
[36:08] atmosphere is being set in the rest of
[36:10] the time so this is a very important
[36:12] thought he says I can teach them in the
[36:14] home but then they get out around the
[36:16] worldly crowd he says the Devil is a
[36:17] shrewd fellow and he pushes that into
[36:20] them that's right very shrewd pushing
[36:22] things into them and then this statement
[36:24] to me write it down I didn't provide a
[36:27] lot of the quotes on slides today I
[36:28] don't normally do that please forgive me
[36:30] I guess don't give me a star for today
[36:32] whatever it is you do keep track of
[36:33] these things he says if you keep them
[36:35] under the spirit until they get old
[36:37] enough to receive the Holy Ghost and
[36:39] know what it's all about then God will
[36:41] take care of the rest of it thank you
[36:43] Lord I'm going to read it if you want me
[36:45] to go slow enough so you can see this if
[36:47] you could keep them under the spirit
[36:50] until they get old enough to receive the
[36:52] Holy Ghost and know what it's all about
[36:54] so now they have the Holy Ghost to
[36:56] discern right WR they have the Holy
[36:57] Ghost to lead them in a situation where
[36:58] the devil's being shrewd then God will
[37:00] take care of the rest of it then what I
[37:03] want to do is I want to keep them under
[37:05] the Holy Ghost we say that we want to be
[37:07] the Holy Ghost to them until they get it
[37:10] keep them under the Holy Ghost until
[37:12] they get the Holy Ghost and if I can
[37:14] keep them under that Holy Ghost at home
[37:17] teaching them at home when they go out
[37:19] into the world and that shrewd fellow
[37:20] tries to push things into them God will
[37:22] take care of
[37:24] that Hallelujah if I could just keep
[37:26] them under the Holy Ghost God help me to
[37:28] keep them under the token keep them
[37:30] under the right kind of atmosphere keep
[37:32] them under the right kind of example
[37:33] keep them under the right kind of
[37:35] priesthood in my home then God will take
[37:37] care of the rest I don't need to be
[37:39] micromanager I don't need to be a
[37:40] helicopter parent I don't need to be at
[37:42] school I don't need to be checking
[37:43] everything my goodness with the things
[37:45] kids could do
[37:46] today and you could say well I need to
[37:48] lock the Wi-Fi down I want to be sure
[37:50] they don't have any devices I want to be
[37:51] sure about this and sure about that man
[37:53] as soon as you get one uh portal blocked
[37:55] there's a new one opening up
[37:58] the other day um we asked Elliot about
[37:59] something and we asked him what he was
[38:01] uh what he was doing he said he was I
[38:03] hope you don't mind Elliot this is
[38:04] really really embarrassing I'm just
[38:06] kidding he said asked him what are you
[38:08] doing he said I'm chatting on Reese's
[38:10] and I'm like what is Reese's I didn't
[38:12] even know there was an application
[38:13] called Reese's they're get these things
[38:15] how how can you control all this stuff
[38:18] now he's chatting on a little chocolate
[38:19] peanut butter
[38:22] snack it just happened to be the name of
[38:24] the the the chat channel on teams or
[38:26] whatever ever so I was like whoa you
[38:29] know if I was to start checking for
[38:30] Skittles and Three Musketeers what have
[38:31] you been doing on Snickers
[38:35] lately but there's just so much out
[38:37] there that I realize as a parent I could
[38:39] become a neurotic just worrying about
[38:41] how shrewd the devil
[38:43] is but I have a promise if I keep them
[38:47] under the Holy Ghost if I can look out
[38:49] over my temple if I could look out over
[38:52] my home myself in my home if I could do
[38:54] that God will take care of the rest and
[38:56] and I won't let go of that promise I'll
[38:58] hold God to his word and say Lord I want
[39:00] to do the best I can to prepare myself
[39:02] and to keep my family under the Holy
[39:04] Ghost and you promised you take care of
[39:06] the rest of
[39:10] it that's the role and responsibility as
[39:13] parents and the sermon Watchman what of
[39:15] the night is drawing from
[39:18] this I know berc is thinking this is an
[39:20] opportunity for a
[39:22] song but it's it says if the good man
[39:25] would have walked
[39:28] brother bam takes this in Watchman one
[39:29] of the night he says the Watchman was
[39:31] that man who went up to a tower on the
[39:33] city way high he was higher than all the
[39:35] footmen because it was his position
[39:38] brother baham uses the Watchmen to
[39:40] relate to even his office as a prophet
[39:43] and that role that he might have to the
[39:44] church age and to the bride but now in
[39:47] application we could see ourselves in a
[39:49] different position within the family as
[39:51] the head as the parents father and
[39:53] mother together he he was higher than
[39:55] the footman because it was his position
[39:58] now in order for this man to get up
[39:59] there he must have a good clear
[40:01] understanding and he must have good eyes
[40:04] these are things you can pray
[40:06] for I want to have good clear
[40:08] understanding I want to have good eyes
[40:09] he must be alert he must know the stars
[40:12] and many qualifications had he to be
[40:15] before he could be a correct
[40:17] Watchman there's a requirement for the
[40:19] priesthood there's a requirement for the
[40:20] Watchmen I'm I'm kind of eliciting to
[40:23] you today or from the word of God these
[40:25] things these requirements of us as
[40:27] Watchmen because of our position we're
[40:29] higher he says and I'm afraid today that
[40:31] we put some Watchman in that couldn't
[40:32] see very far oh couldn't see all this
[40:35] disaster that's coming to warn the
[40:37] people then unqualified a Watchman would
[40:40] soon have the city destroyed because the
[40:42] entire city depended on the
[40:44] Watchman thank God this bride will not
[40:46] be destroyed because she had a Watchman
[40:48] one that was higher than the rest one
[40:50] with an Eagle Eye who's warned us ahead
[40:51] of time the invasion of the United
[40:53] States and these different things that
[40:54] were preached to warn us about Hol wood
[40:56] War us about entertainment war war us
[40:58] about Pentecostalism we've we've heard
[41:00] those warnings from the Watchman brother
[41:02] brandham but now in the same image you
[41:05] within your home have the benefit of
[41:07] what the Watchman has said and we have
[41:09] the benefit of what the word of God says
[41:11] you have the benefit of the Holy Ghost
[41:13] that gives you a clear understanding
[41:15] therefore we have the responsibility to
[41:17] our homes as Watchmen that they not be
[41:22] destroyed our homes depend upon parents
[41:24] as Watchmen
[41:26] I know if the the home burned to the
[41:28] ground spiritually you probably want to
[41:29] blame it on your
[41:30] teenagers and they might be the ones
[41:32] that put the match to the
[41:35] gasoline but why' you fill it up with so
[41:37] much gasoline and
[41:39] matches just a matter of time before
[41:41] they would light a
[41:45] match now I'm going
[41:49] to I'm just I want to take I going to
[41:52] close I have just a um one more thing to
[41:55] share with you before we close and it's
[41:57] just from Proverbs Proverbs chap 1:8 I
[42:00] want to piggyback on this this is kind
[42:02] of where I'm veering just a little bit
[42:04] but it says my son hear the instruction
[42:06] of thy father and forsake not the law of
[42:08] thy mother amen oh that reminds
[42:13] me whose birthday was it
[42:18] Wednesday okay I won't do
[42:21] it now we might use this to instruct Ian
[42:24] we might just say Ian says to hear the
[42:27] instruction of thy father and forsake
[42:28] not the law of thy mother and we could
[42:31] do that and we often do that because
[42:33] this scripture says my son so we feel
[42:35] it's directed to the son and and if I
[42:38] was saying Ian here are the instruction
[42:41] of thy father and forsake not the law of
[42:43] thy mother mother and father be over
[42:45] there
[42:46] going right I mean they like that's
[42:48] that's good stuff that's good but you
[42:49] know what this speaks to the parents
[42:52] first because what it should say to a
[42:54] father is what are my instructions
[42:56] right right to the mother what is my law
[43:00] and if it hasn't been articulated what
[43:02] are my children deducing from my
[43:05] actions because they're going to do what
[43:07] you do right and so the the instructions
[43:11] of a father and the law of a mother in
[43:13] other words fathers must have
[43:14] instructions they must have discipline
[43:16] they must have correction not just in
[43:18] what they say but even in what they
[43:19] demonstrate and what they do hear the
[43:22] instruction of thy father and forsake
[43:24] not the law of thy mother fathers must
[43:26] have instructions mothers must have laws
[43:29] is that good that's why we always say go
[43:32] ask
[43:33] mom she's the one with all the
[43:35] laws I'd let you eat that son but I'm
[43:39] not the one that's responsible for the
[43:41] menu right she has the laws and it's
[43:45] scriptural so hear the instruction of
[43:47] thy father go ask thy mom and the law of
[43:50] thy mother brother Brown takes this in
[43:52] the sermon of the invasion of the United
[43:54] States he says to you little mothers
[43:55] here this morning it's kind of it's neat
[43:57] how he adds this to it cuz I know maybe
[43:59] some of you thinking yeah the dad's are
[44:00] really getting it right brother aon's
[44:01] giving them the business but this we're
[44:03] all in this together he says to you
[44:06] little mo mothers here this morning
[44:08] that's been real mothers I know there's
[44:10] many of you I think every one of you let
[44:12] me tell you something God bless you you
[44:13] are the Fifth
[44:15] Gospel that's what you are the Fifth
[44:17] Gospel and it begins to tell the story
[44:19] of Moses remember when Moses was a
[44:21] little boy it was a mother who give him
[44:23] his instruction it was a Godly mother
[44:26] who took little Moses on her knees and
[44:28] said Moses he says taught him now this
[44:31] catch this part she was his teacher
[44:34] under pharaoh and you want to talk about
[44:36] Leo de sea and you want to talk about
[44:38] Joe Biden did this Joe Biden did that
[44:40] and we're still suffering from Obama's
[44:42] eight years and you want to blame
[44:44] everything on a liberal agenda okay fine
[44:47] she was his teacher under pharaoh and
[44:49] said these things said Moses someday
[44:51] you're going to deliver the children of
[44:52] Israel You're the boy that's called keep
[44:54] yourself pure and unspotted from the
[44:56] world you're the one you're the one says
[44:59] no other place do we know where he ever
[45:01] went to any Seminary any teaching at all
[45:03] he ever got he stayed right in Pharaoh's
[45:06] Palace which was a heathen but his
[45:08] mother taught him just keep him under
[45:11] the Holy Ghost and God will take care of
[45:12] the rest that even though we may be in
[45:15] Egypt and we may feel that we're in the
[45:16] house of pharaoh we have opportunities
[45:19] as parents and right here it's just
[45:20] emphasizing this glorious role of the
[45:22] woman within the home even though it
[45:24] might be a heathen nation and the Heath
[45:26] is Raging his mother taught him he said
[45:28] that's a real mother she taught him the
[45:31] precepts of the Lord she told him how he
[45:32] must be holy she told him how and what
[45:35] he must live and how what God must do
[45:37] would do for him and it stuck with Moses
[45:39] all the days of his
[45:41] life taught him precepts taught him to
[45:43] be holy what he told him what he must do
[45:45] how to live he says and any good true
[45:48] loyal mother that'll take her little
[45:49] babies instead of send them to picture
[45:52] shows and dances and so forth like that
[45:54] she'll put them on her la and teach them
[45:57] about the Lord Jesus
[45:59] Christ now I think you ought to use some
[46:02] wisdom there if they're 16 years old
[46:03] maybe don't need to use the
[46:06] lap but was it tell us what what is
[46:08] loyal Parenthood it's
[46:11] equipping
[46:12] teaching instead of just sending them
[46:14] off to picture shows and dances and some
[46:16] of you like what are even
[46:19] those but you put them you set them down
[46:21] and teach them about the Lord Jesus
[46:24] Christ the Easter still brother Brown
[46:26] speaking of children he says they Little
[46:27] Treasures that God gives you the
[46:29] responsibility of raising and I've
[46:32] always said and made this kind of a
[46:33] saying to mothers we know written of
[46:34] four gospels Matthew Mark Luke and John
[46:36] but there's a Fifth Gospel Unwritten
[46:38] that's mother she gets them before
[46:41] Matthew Mark Luke and John's teachings
[46:43] get
[46:44] them the the the parents the mother gets
[46:47] them before the Bible even gets them so
[46:50] the responsibility is placed upon you
[46:52] mothers and you fathers to raise these
[46:55] children for the kingdom of God he said
[46:56] I'm sure that's your heart's
[46:58] desire this is our responsibility it's
[47:01] placed on us as fathers and mothers to
[47:03] raise the children for the kingdom of
[47:05] God that Fifth Gospel within the home
[47:08] the father's a priest in the home the
[47:09] mother's working together with this as
[47:11] the gospel as the word they're priests
[47:13] in the home the Bible says they're to
[47:15] offer up their bodies as a Living
[47:17] Sacrifice they are called to be a holy
[47:19] priesthood he hath made us all Kings and
[47:21] Priests so this is a role that we take
[47:24] within the home
[47:26] in Proverbs Chapter 6:20 my son keep thy
[47:28] father's commandment and forsake the law
[47:31] not the law of thy mother again the
[47:33] mothers have laws father's got
[47:35] instructions and Commandments amen the
[47:38] Commandments the fathers must have a
[47:39] code of
[47:41] wisdom now I've been working on a sermon
[47:43] but maybe I'll just preach it all right
[47:46] here it could be quick promise no series
[47:49] here I I'll get rid Parts 1 through 12
[47:52] right here there's things in life that
[47:55] that we learn and we begin to implement
[47:58] when we call them life hacks it's like
[48:01] hey did you know you could do this like
[48:02] the right way to peel a banana things
[48:04] like that but as you learn those things
[48:06] as a parent by the time they get to your
[48:08] children they shouldn't be called
[48:10] hacks you listening I think I need to do
[48:13] a series on
[48:15] this they shouldn't be called hacks the
[48:17] the children should be like this is just
[48:19] the way that it
[48:20] is and for a lot of people who came into
[48:23] the world came into the message out of
[48:25] the world and out of Pentecostalism and
[48:27] out of sin and all these things there's
[48:29] things about the messes that were new
[48:30] and these were like spiritual hacks and
[48:32] oh my goodness this is amazing this is
[48:33] amazing and a lot of things that you
[48:35] begin to implement and it's
[48:36] revolutionary a and it's lifechanging
[48:39] but there should be things that we
[48:40] Implement in our homes that we don't
[48:42] even call them
[48:43] hacks we say this is just the way you do
[48:46] it this isn't a shortcut this isn't the
[48:49] neat way this isn't the better way this
[48:50] is the
[48:53] way series or no series
[48:56] series okay well well we we'll set up a
[48:59] GoFundMe I mean a poll a
[49:02] poll but it says my my son keep thy
[49:05] father's Commandments it says it's a
[49:06] code of wisdom the father has to have a
[49:09] code of wisdom now if I could just be
[49:12] transparent I don't like to do this uh
[49:15] as the one that's speaking because I
[49:16] think the most important thing for me to
[49:17] do is get out of the way in what better
[49:18] way than to be
[49:21] transparent but the more I studied this
[49:24] the more I feel like man kind of I'm
[49:26] kind of lost in this what's your code of
[49:27] wisdom what I'm still learning on the
[49:29] job you know what would be the tenants
[49:31] you would put down what would be your
[49:32] standard operating procedure what would
[49:34] be your words of wisdom if you only had
[49:36] 10 minutes to tell your sons everything
[49:37] you felt like they needed to know for
[49:38] the rest of your lives where would you
[49:40] start brother Reggie did a um one of the
[49:43] youth meetings where he's kind of asking
[49:45] that question like what would be the
[49:46] most important thing and if you could
[49:47] say one thing this is the most important
[49:49] thing get it and if we had to do that
[49:51] what would it be so I I say that just to
[49:54] recognize that this is It's challenging
[49:56] to think that wow what are my
[49:58] instructions and it's not just make your
[49:59] bed and do this and do that what's my
[50:01] code of
[50:02] wisdom am I able to uh demonstrate not
[50:06] just articulate that when I'm in a
[50:07] situation there's a way that I respond
[50:09] to it there's a way that that when
[50:12] something happens like you just go oh my
[50:14] goodness not
[50:16] again right or or is there Panic or do
[50:19] you start is there a way that you
[50:20] respond to things because as you respond
[50:22] brother B toss there's someone watching
[50:24] you and as you demonstrate your wisdom
[50:27] as you live out your wisdom it's being
[50:29] instructive to others because the Bible
[50:31] said keep the father's commandment keep
[50:33] the father's code of wisdom and it tells
[50:35] us I've got to have
[50:37] one so I say father give me wisdom
[50:40] because they're looking at my wisdom
[50:42] father lead me because H H uh because
[50:45] I'm leading them brother bradam says in
[50:48] the message leadership the first is the
[50:49] mother's kindness he's talking about
[50:50] lead you're going to have somebody lead
[50:52] you he speaking for every individual
[50:55] first first it's the mother's kindness
[50:56] that leads you and then the father's
[50:59] word so mothers are to be kind fathers
[51:01] to have the word and the mother gives
[51:04] you your first step then you look to
[51:06] your daddy all of us for wisdom that's
[51:08] scriptural keep thy father's commandment
[51:10] he says because he is the head of the
[51:12] house and now young people you can all
[51:14] amen here not that he's any
[51:17] smarter right right
[51:21] knucklehead but he's just made a leader
[51:23] of his family so he does have to be
[51:25] smart but because he's the leader he
[51:28] says so we follow what our daddy says do
[51:31] that should have been the title what
[51:33] daddy says
[51:34] do when he says now son I'd like for you
[51:37] to do a certain thing then we listen to
[51:38] him because it's wisdom but listen he
[51:42] has learned a whole lot and we've got to
[51:44] ask him to see what he learned and then
[51:46] we can profit by his what he's
[51:49] learned you're starting to asking us
[51:51] what what have I learned what kind of
[51:54] questions am I going to get later
[51:55] it's I I'm preaching this not to our
[51:57] young people I we could preach this to
[51:59] the young people go home and ask
[52:00] questions and do what your daddy says
[52:02] and we could we could take that angle
[52:03] with and I think that would certainly be
[52:04] appropriate and brother bradam is saying
[52:06] that you should listen to your daddy
[52:08] whatever he says to do you've got to do
[52:10] it because he's learned a lot and we
[52:12] want to learn profit from what he's
[52:13] learned that tells me I need to stop for
[52:17] a moment and think what am I learning
[52:19] what have I learned have I learned from
[52:21] my mistakes have I learned from my
[52:23] successes God give me wisdom Lord help
[52:25] me this is an important position am he
[52:29] tells us now don't go and do this
[52:31] because I did that my father father told
[52:33] me not to do it but I did it and it
[52:35] caused this to happen to me something
[52:37] bad well good so then we can learn from
[52:39] our mistakes to teach ours he says then
[52:41] he daddy tells us how to do it and what
[52:43] to do
[52:47] right when your kids go out and you say
[52:50] don't do anything I wouldn't do you want
[52:52] to be sure that that's a safe
[52:53] instruction right
[52:56] yeah I'll just I I'll close musicians go
[52:59] please if you could just come to your
[53:02] instruments I just want to close with
[53:04] this image at 1 Chronicles chapter 6 in
[53:08] verses 48 and
[53:09] 49 it says it says
[53:13] this and I'll come to verse 32 here in a
[53:16] moment it says their Brethren also the
[53:17] Levites were appointed un all manner of
[53:19] service of the Tabernacle of the house
[53:22] of God and this is Levites that are all
[53:23] being included there's different
[53:25] divisions according to talents and
[53:27] responsibilities and gifts so at this
[53:30] point and if you read Leviticus excuse
[53:32] me 1 Chronicles 6 there's a lot of names
[53:34] and Sons and different ones but there's
[53:35] these little things that are
[53:36] interspersed in there that give context
[53:38] to these lineages and the fathers and
[53:40] their sons and the fathers and their
[53:42] sons so it says their Brethren also the
[53:44] Levites were appointed under all manner
[53:46] of service of the Tabernacle of the
[53:47] house of God so all manner of service
[53:50] some were Porters at the gates others
[53:52] had the responsibility to carry uh carry
[53:55] care for certain vessels others had to
[53:57] slay the the sacrificial beast and to uh
[54:00] fet them and cut them open and discard
[54:02] certain things and they had to bring the
[54:04] pieces to the altar to be
[54:06] burned uh for the priest to offer so
[54:08] there's all sorts of different roles not
[54:10] all of them did the same
[54:11] thing it says but Aaron and his sons
[54:14] offered upon the altar of the burnt
[54:16] offering and on the altar of incense and
[54:18] were appointed for all the work of the
[54:20] place most holy and to make an atonement
[54:23] for Israel according to all that Moses
[54:25] the servant of God had
[54:28] commanded so in these two
[54:31] verses Chronicles chapter 6 and if you
[54:33] read more you just see there's all these
[54:35] men that had these responsibility in
[54:37] these roles and it related to Levites
[54:40] not all Levites entered into the
[54:42] priesthood but all of them would serve
[54:44] in the
[54:46] temple and if we got real strict about
[54:49] you know who is the priest in the home
[54:50] and can the wife really be a a priest
[54:53] and is she is she a pastor Pastor in the
[54:55] home and then if she's the pastor in the
[54:56] home then what does that make the dad
[54:58] the prophet or it's just there might be
[54:59] a whole way you try it's it's not about
[55:01] trying to figure out the types let's
[55:03] just look at the
[55:04] reality we're we're called to lead we're
[55:07] called to serve in the home as as
[55:10] Levites as Kings and
[55:12] Priests as a royal
[55:15] priesthood as Servants of the most high
[55:18] some may have different gifts and
[55:20] strengths hopefully in your marriage
[55:22] what God has done is he's brought you
[55:24] someone who compatible with you who who
[55:27] is that help meet who is that mirror
[55:29] image of you equal but opposite to look
[55:31] out after your weaknesses you find in
[55:34] some situations where both the husband
[55:35] and a wife are think the exact same way
[55:37] and do everything the exact same way
[55:39] sometimes they're that's really good but
[55:41] has a really bigh uh downside because
[55:43] they don't help one another in their
[55:44] weaknesses so in our differences in our
[55:46] strengths and our weaknesses we all have
[55:48] different things we do but we're all
[55:49] called to
[55:51] service employed as they we can look in
[55:54] the scriptures they were all employed in
[55:56] these various departments and these
[55:57] different administrations and Temple
[55:59] service and then we could look within
[56:01] our homes and say I'm called to be a
[56:03] husband called to be a
[56:05] wife by God's grace called to be a
[56:07] father called to be a mother and we
[56:10] could even say called to be Sons called
[56:11] to be daughters all together arranged as
[56:13] one beautiful picture of God's desire
[56:16] am it says in 1 Chronicles chapter 6:32
[56:20] it says they ministered before the
[56:21] dwelling place of the Tabernacle of the
[56:22] congregation with singing until Solomon
[56:25] had built the house of the Lord in
[56:26] Jerusalem and then they waited this is
[56:29] that particular group of people that
[56:30] were singers said then they waited on
[56:31] their office according to their
[56:34] order and this could be said of each one
[56:37] each one of these Levites that served in
[56:39] their different capacities appointed
[56:41] under all manner of service employed in
[56:43] all these different administrations and
[56:45] departments Aaron and his sons this uh
[56:47] Levites this Levites and all the Levites
[56:49] that were appointed all could could be
[56:51] said that they performed their duties
[56:53] according to the responsibilities given
[56:55] to them and they did what they were
[56:57] supposed to do and that's what allowed
[56:59] the entire house of the Lord to function
[57:02] wasn't all just on Moses the
[57:04] prophet Moses is not even enter
[57:06] mentioned in a lot of these things it
[57:08] was all according to what he commanded
[57:09] but then Aaron's the one who's who's
[57:11] arranging the priest and his sons and
[57:13] then you have this father with his sons
[57:15] and this father with his sons these are
[57:16] gifted and singing These gifted and that
[57:18] and they all found their place and they
[57:20] all did what they were supposed to do
[57:22] according to their office
[57:26] and according to their
[57:28] order I think this these sermons I've
[57:30] been preaching on this ought to be
[57:33] reemphasizing to you that already know
[57:35] it that you are called as men to a high
[57:38] office a priest for a
[57:40] home and then if you have the blessing
[57:42] of being married God's called you to
[57:44] serve with another priestess as it were
[57:47] a Fifth Gospel if that helps you a help
[57:51] meet to perform the duties of priests in
[57:55] a
[57:56] home brother brand is preaching the Seal
[57:58] of the Antichrist and he comes down and
[58:01] he's and he made this state I just was
[58:03] reading it last week and it just kept it
[58:06] just kept nudging me and I I'll say this
[58:10] I'll say it as he says it
[58:13] to the
[58:15] congregation and you just you just ask
[58:17] yourself Lord does does something speak
[58:20] to me in this he says you ought to go
[58:22] home everybody get down around the B
[58:25] tonight or else bring the mother and
[58:27] kitties all of them get around the bed
[58:30] and say mother let's pray right here
[58:33] till God really makes things different
[58:35] around
[58:36] here who ought to do that hopefully it's
[58:39] the
[58:40] husband hopeit the husband who's in a
[58:42] place where he could say honey let's
[58:44] gather together and let's pray that God
[58:47] things will God will make things
[58:49] different around here that tells me that
[58:52] it's not too late I remember when I was
[58:55] ministering on a particular subject on
[58:57] family order a number of years ago and
[58:59] the more that I studied on it the more I
[59:01] began to get discouraged thinking man
[59:03] just in these first dozen years or so
[59:05] there's a lot of things I wasn't doing
[59:06] that I should and there's a lot of
[59:07] things you let go and sometimes you're
[59:09] just so busy
[59:11] surviving you're doing everything you
[59:13] can just to get through and to make it
[59:14] and deal with certain things and and
[59:16] because of that your children suffer and
[59:18] finances may suffer and certain things
[59:20] may suffer as a result of it and you
[59:22] look up and maybe the preacher just
[59:23] keeps preaching on the man the home over
[59:25] and over again he's start okay enough
[59:26] already I didn't know all this until now
[59:28] and now and you think is it too late is
[59:30] it too late and I was fellowshiping
[59:32] brother Jason Watkins and I just said
[59:34] man as I look at these things I just
[59:36] think man is it too late and he said
[59:39] brother Aaron it's never too late to
[59:41] change the family Dynamics and I said
[59:42] I'm claiming it it's not too late it's
[59:46] not too late wherever you may be today
[59:48] if you're the grandparents if you're the
[59:50] parents if you've been married for
[59:51] decades if you've only been married for
[59:53] a couple years whatever it might be it's
[59:54] not too too late to change the
[59:57] Dynamics and have the grace not to put
[1:00:00] your foot down and put the woman in her
[1:00:03] place but the grace as it said to men
[1:00:05] brother said to take to place just to
[1:00:08] place your foot where it
[1:00:09] belongs so that your wife can find her
[1:00:12] place and the whole family can line up
[1:00:13] and be in order and let's challenge
[1:00:16] ourselves as a priest of a home if you
[1:00:20] could all just stand together with me
[1:00:21] today we'll pray together
