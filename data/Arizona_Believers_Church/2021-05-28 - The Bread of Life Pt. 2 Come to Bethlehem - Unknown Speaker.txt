TRANSCRIPT
========================================
ruth chapter one i'd like to start with uh verse one and read to verse five i've been studying the book of ruth and like to if god would lead just maybe do a study in it for a few services maybe several services it would be it would be a book that you could go through verse by verse and uh wouldn't necessarily spend a few years on it even though maybe you could but it's just a short story that would be very easy to read even tonight if we just took time to read it together as a congregation you very easily could go through it in just a several minutes and uh but it's something i'd encourage you to read on your own but i'd like to just take some time and study it because that's just a real beautiful book that holds a lot of meaning for us as message believers and we'll kind of lay a little bit of a foundation for it tonight and so we're continuing on the subject of the bread of life and um the subject of being hungry and being fed and those those things and we'll make a few comments at the beginning to kind of reset that um but our thought right now was this coming to bethlehem is what we're looking at and god has done that for us in this hour brought us an invitation to come to bethlehem and so ruth chapter one verse 1 now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled that there was a famine in the land and a certain man of bethlehem judah went to sojourn in the country of moab he and his wife and his two sons and that'll be the verse that we'll study tonight and the name of the man was elimelech and the name of his wife was naomi and the name of his two sons were muhan and kilian efrates of bethlehem judah and they came into the country of moab and continued there and elimelech naomi's husband died and she was left and her two sons and they took them wives of the women of moab the name of one of the one was orpah and the name of the other was ruth and they dwelled there about 10 years and michonne and kilian died as both of them died also both of them and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband amen let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer our heavenly father tonight as we're standing in your divine presence we sent something supernatural and we've enjoyed the praise we've enjoyed the atmosphere we've enjoyed the gifts of our brothers who played the music and led the worship and we've benefited by it tonight lord it's washed our spirits and it's it's reading us to hear from you so now lord i pray that you'd come into this humble gathering and speak to us through your word and in doing so may it energize us and strengthen us as we take time as family just around your word reading scripture and and pondering uh what it means and gathering inspiration from it may it be a special time and lord i realize that for myself in maybe the last two decades of ministry that there's as you travel and minister and you preach special meetings and you come to a place and you preach one service and then you go that there's a maybe a tendency to just view every service is so intense and so important and climactic and special and lord i would hope that we wouldn't look at things in the way of a special service or the climax climatic service in a convention but lord realize that every service we have is a special opportunity and as i would take it seriously as a speaker lord may we still yet realize that in simple gatherings where the word is lifted up and and truth is expounded upon that in there there's power and in those simple times together there's a power present to heal us set us free deliver us save souls and lord we want to give you the liberty to move however you would want and we believe that where as believers you can manifest yourself amongst us in power and demonstration and all glory would go to you so now father take control this service for your glories we commit these things into your hands in the name of the lord jesus christ amen you can be seated again we're this is the second part of the bread of life and looking at the same subject come to bethlehem and last time let's just if you'd like to turn in your bibles to revelations chapter 3 verse 20 just want to quickly point to this scripture kind of tie back in uh to where we ended up on ruth last time but jesus speaking to um the this instruction to the laodicean church age after they have been uh chastised and admonished and no compliment given and told to come and to buy things necessary to remedy their deficiencies it says behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come into him and will sup with him and he with me and we saw how that this is christ on the outside of the church and so this is an invitation to come together with christ and those who are on the wrong side of this door as it were could not remain in that condition but christ on the outside is calling to this person to come out and come into communion with him and we're looking at who christ is the bread of life this fountain of life and how this invitation to those in laodicea uh to come out from amongst her and at the at his voice hearing this voice opening the door it's an invitation to partake of the bread of life it's an invitation to drink from the fountain of life and that if any man hear my voice it's that greek phoneme it looks like it's spelled phone or it's spelled p-h-o-n-e pronounced phonet it's the sound of uttered words it's it means it comes from the sense of bringing forth into light so there's a voice that leads us into light there's a voice that leads us into truth and here it says if any man hear my voice and can enter into this fellowship i will manifest myself to him i will sup with him and he will sup with me this sup is refers to a meal that served at the end of the day and so we're living in a time where the gentile ages are ceasing and just before this bride has translated god once again prepares a meal and a feast for his bride so it's the bride's last feast before the translation so we're going to go to what i would like to call a literal marriage supper in that we know that there is a wedding supper in the sky and it's not going to be like the banquets that we're used to here on earth i believe there's going to be there are symbolisms that are meant to it but there is going to be some kind of banquet or feasting or supper that is prepared in the sky and and when i say it's not like the feast we have here whatever disappointments if you don't like buffets don't dread the wedding supper it's not going to be like old country buffet or you know the great wall of china buffet it's going to be different it's going to be something that we can look forward to and so there's going to be a wedding supper in the sky we look to god interpret that by bringing it to pass but before we go to that meeting in the air there's a spiritual feast now for his bride there's something that we're feeding on there's something that's given us life and it's in that feast that the bride receives everything that she has need of to be translated so you've got to be partaking of that bread and partaking in that feast and in the rapture message brother branham referring to first thessalonians chapter 4 verse 16 the shout the voice and the trump he says jesus does all three when he's descending a shout and he says what is the shout it's the message going forth first have we heard that message it's the messenger it's the message it's a it's a prophet of god with the message it's the message going forth first so that should tell us something about first thessalonians 4 16 that should tell us something about the season that we're living in now it's the message and what is the message the living bread of life bringing forth the bride so as this living bread of life is made manifest it has it has this effect upon the elect to bring them forth it's going to call them forth it's going to stir them up and they're going to be ready to go out to meet him and so it's the living bread of life bringing forth the brine and so when we use this phrase come to bethlehem bethlehem is the house of god's bread and it being the house of god's bread today we have a bethlehem and and using this come to bethlehem as an invitation or a draw there is uh we want to recognize our spiritual feast today know exactly what feet table you're feeding from uh know where you're going to get the nutrients you need for this diet in the end time and and not and so that we're not without hope oh well where can i be fed and where can i get the things that i need and and maybe just to get serious about what you're feeding on because you better have a spiritual diet that's leading you to a body change uh if you just want a diet that'll keep you going to church you can find a lot of those right i mean this is no offense to uh to the chefs out there who are serving up food that keeps you going to church but that's not enough we need a message we need to be feeding on something that's going to take us to a body change and be serious about that be serious about the things we're feeding on the things that we're listening to and our spiritual feasts so this we have been invited come to bethlehem there's been a fountain opened up there's been a doorway opened up to a spiritual feast in this end time and as brother of adam refers to it as the living bread of life if you could look at ruth chapter 1 verse 6 i want to just pick up right after our text and just read the next verse because as it tells us these first five verses are just full of sadness and darkness and then so naomi being the only one left of her family and that she left with her husband and two sons her husband and two sons die it says in verse six then she arose with her daughters-in-law that she might return from the country of moab now notice what is what draws her to leave moab for she had heard in the country of moab how that the lord had visited his people in giving them bread and so as we read in ruth chapter one and we read the first several verses those first five verses we see that immediately famine is what sets the scene so as the painter is trying to paint a picture as a storyteller is trying to set the mood and the tone it begins that there is a famine in the land and there's a famine there in bethlehem judah and we'll look at that in specific detail tonight so it's this famine that sets the scene but this is the part i want us to catch as we're being forward looking and why we're even using this story it may be darkness and death that opens the story famine that introduces us to to naomi and then ultimately to ruth but it's the lord's visitation with bread that brings ruth to bethlehem it's not well it's not working out in moab and my family's dead let's go try somewhere else but there was a message and something had reached naomi where she was and she was drawn back to bethlehem with this announcement that the lord had visited her people in this time with bread so think of this this revelation and this type how it's not just a story that well god brought you out of egypt and there's a promised land it wasn't just something rehearsed in their ears of well there's this judge and there's this person and there's that person it wasn't even that a prophet was in the land but it was actually a message that the lord had visited the promised people had visited her people and he did so in giving them bread so this is exactly what the lord himself does in this end time it's not just it's just not a one-man ministry where it's just well god sent another gift to the church like one of the five-fold but it's a revelation that jesus christ has visited his bride and is giving them bread and that is what it's that visitation it's the lord's visitation that brings naomi and ultimately really what the focus of the story is ruth to back to bethlehem and so it says in verse 22 so naomi returned and ruth the moabitus her daughter-in-law with her which returned out of the country of moab and they came to bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest this is another important detail about this story and i'm using these these these readings as my thought has been on the bread of life which satisfies the bride's hunger that's what we need to be feeding on in order to be fed in order to be satisfied in order to be grown and maturing and we see then in ruth chapter 1 that the lord had visited giving them the bread of life and when naomi and ruth return back to bethlehem they come in the beginning of the barley harvest so as naomi returns and ruth with her she doesn't come during a time of famine she's not coming back and the story is naomi's saying hey look we're going back to this place and it's dry and it's going to be difficult and it's going to be tough and it's going to be worse than it was in moab no i believe that naomi would have had the testimony there's bread there there's substance there i can come back even though i'm coming back a left full and i'm coming back empty i'm coming back to a place where i know that god has given provision there's going to be something there to sustain me and she would have had a positive report to give ruth as they were traveling on they come during not during a time of famine but they could come let's use this phrase they come during harvest time they come here at the beginning of barley harvest and the barley was what matured first and and coming at this time she's actually arriving at the time of the feast of unleavened bread arriving at a time of the passover feast and the passover celebration so this is the time that ruth comes to bethlehem this is we see naomi returning but since the story is about ruth this moabitess this gentile woman think about how she is such a type of those of us who've come for such a time as this we're not coming in a time where it's just going to be another planting and growing and this but we've come for harvest time we haven't come in at the time of another cycle but we've come at the end where there's going to be a rapture so this is a type of our personal spiritual feast of the word in the rapture season and this is what sets us up uh this is what draws me to these things and on the subject of being hungry in the bread of life is ruth comes because the living bread of life had been brought to israel the lord had visited his people and giving them bread and as ruth comes she's just following naomi she comes she comes right at the beginning of harvest time right in the barley harvest and so with that kind of connecting us to where we've been and and some of the services here i want to just begin by looking at the book of ruth and and slowing down and going through some of these verses in this in this uh wonderful story the book is uh it's a remarkable story a very remarkable story which as we've read tonight begins with famine and death as you read it's the first things you read in the first five verses there's three people that are dead there's a famine um there's three widows it's a very very dark story it's a story that begins with famine and death but the story ends in redemption in life it may open with what would be three funerals in a famine but it ends with the marriage and the bringing forth of a son so when you look at this it opens up very darkly but it ends very gloriously and there's a lot of different pieces where this sets within the context of scripture which is instructive to us to catch the revelation that's contained in this book to encourage us and to settle us and and to give us a greater inspiration for the word of god the book of ruth is set between judges and samuel and so you have even the book of joshua which is the book of ephesians to the old testament then you have the book of judges and then you have the book of samuel and and and we may get into this in more detail later but the book of samuel is what is placing anointing david to be king and setting him in his position so you can see that this would even relate to the reign of the son of david which is is not the son of man but the son of david in the millennium and you have this time of the judges where we'll touch on this tonight this lawlessness but in comes ruth and so then ruth then speaks of the bride's position in christ just before the millennium even after the lawlessness of the church ages or even laodicea and so this book ruth sets between judges and samuel and in it being set here and placed here divinely by god it relates to your positional placing speaks to how god places you and as you read it you can think oh it's a beautiful love story about ruth and boaz and it does it does ring in a lot of ways of some romanticism and and a wonderful love story and i'll say this about this love story is it's true so if you want to read a love story and get real faith this is the one you want to read some of these uh christian fiction that tells love stories let me just be honest with you if you just want to say that's just brother aaron's opinion that's fine but if it's made up and it's fiction you can't really get faith out of that how are you going to derive faith from a man-made narrative that this happened and that happened and that's why these two people fell in love and so that gives me faith to believe i can find love not in that that's a man-made story there's no faith that you can you anchor on a fiction to get more faith to believe that god's going to provide for you and listen god has provided us not fables but truth provided us something that we can read provided us the word of the hour testimonies of the saints other people that can testify well i was praying he granted me this and i kept myself true and it took a while but i got married at this age and that's where you can draw real inspiration and faith is from the truth and so this is a love story that can maybe give different ones confidence and faith to believe but it's more than just a love story but it foreshadows the greatest love story and that way it's more than just a love story but it's a foreshadowing of the greatest love story and it speaks of the romance between christ and his bride such a beautiful beautiful story and there's a truth for us to catch in this tremendous truth there's a lot of types that we can bring out in this but there's a way that the believer can see himself in these stages of ruth there's a way that we can see the church in the stages of ruth there's uh the the gentile bride is brought into view and there's a representation of israel a representation of the gentile church and so there's a truth for us to catch and i'm wanting to use this emphasis that there's a revelation of god's provision and care for his elect there was something wherein ruth represents the believer represents the gentile believer and this this book speaks of god's elective love for her think of that it speaks of his elective love for her that in the in the outcome and i feel like i'm just getting so inspired on you as well to it's just kind of pulling me pulling me raby to the climax or to the real end of the story but think about it it opens with famine this is a terrible famine then there's a death and then there's two more deaths there's a famine there's three deaths there's three widows and what is god doing it for it's his elective love for ruth that allows all these things to happen because he wants to bring another gentile right into the lineage of jesus christ to do what to give us hope to give us courage to see that how god deals with his elect and he does it through election and that's what we trust in that's what we rest in is god's elective love my it's so beautiful i want to read a few statements here just before we transition to ruth chapter one verse one and start going through phrase by phrase tonight notice how brother branham in just a few places speaking about the book of ruth uh he in revelations chapter five part two and this is when he preaches the revelation of jesus christ which is where the church age book is derived from or a lot of the the writings uh of the church age book are taken from the series called the revelation of jesus christ that he preached in 1961. so this is revelations chapter five part two and he refers to the book of ruth and he's talking about ruth being a wonderful book more than a love story and then he says this oh if anybody says that the bible wasn't inspired there's something wrong with them every word of it is inspired every word of it fits right together just like a dovetail on a plank it goes perfectly together like the cogs on a mighty wheel turning just time to the millionth of a second just exactly right that's beautiful mechanics that that's a wonderful craftsmanship for him to say that it fits wonderfully to get dovetail like on a plank and there's you see some of the carpentry even ancient carpentry where joints were done where things would feather together and you'd look at it and it's squared off but you can't even tell where the joint is and they're not using glue they're not using screws they're not even using mechanical equipment but a craftsman can do things in such a way where they join and feather together and it's perfectly joint he says like a plank he's and that's how our bible is it's exactly how he says it goes perfectly together like cogs on a mighty will turning just time to the millionth of a second and his inspiration for the statement is looking at the book of ruth so he sees something in this story in the book of ruth that dovetails with the story of redemption that doves tells with the with the picture that god is painting through the entire bible then in the sermon redeemer redemption he says redemption beautiful story of redemption i believe for the next few moments let's view something a beautiful little story comes into my mind a book that's short in the bible and gives out the very lines of redemption and that's the book of ruth there's a book in the bible that gives out the very lines of redemption the lines of redemption i don't know maybe how that would strike you but you could say it's the lines it's the it's the script it's the screenplay it's something that was written the very lines that are going to be played out the very rehearsing uh the very plot the very story lines of redemption are given out in the book of ruth the whole thing is foreshadowed the whole thing is spoken beforehand the very lines are the boundaries of the foundation or the breadth and the height and the depth that is redemption are spelled out and portrayed here in the book of ruth it's just a short story but he calls it a beautiful little story that comes to mind that's short in the bible it gives out the very lines of redemption and that's the book of ruth many people just pass over that book people are reading and they say oh joshua judges ruth oh isn't that funny it sounds like a sentence and they just kind of pass right over what we got to get from the judges to the book of samuel and there's a lot of people that look at this and say well it's a very uh and it does stand for this i found this to be very remarkable that you read through the book of judges and you're covering a lot of years and a lot of different instances and a lot of different overlap and it's a lot of terrible things that are recited and you really hear about the battles and the disobedience but then with this book all of a sudden you kind of get a picture of daily life as a matter of fact there's certain instances that are unfolding where it's as if you're getting this an hour-by-hour account of something that begins to happen in the evening and overnight and the next day and so it's kind of a peak into the domestic life of the israelites at that time but it's so much more than that he says a lot of people just pass over that book but it's the most beautiful story of the lord jesus almost of the old testament the most beautiful story of the old the of the lord jesus almost of the old testament so this is what this book stands for it's inspired it fits together it dovetails with the story of redemption it gives out the very lines of redemption many people may just pass over it but it's the most beautiful story of the lord jesus almost of the old testament and the sermon god is god has a provided way he says in the book of ruth many of you run over the top of that book not thinking what it is oh it's just a historical record it's just a kind of peak into the daily life of of the israelites at the time of the judges but it says many of you run over the top of that not thinking of what it is that's one of the most greatest stories in there of a type of christ in all the old testament now there's not brother branham is not alone in speaking of this there's a lot of commentators that pointed this out there's a lot a lot of people that saw these parallels and speaking of redemption but i want you to consider now for a moment that what brother brahms trying to point out isn't just what would be common he's not one to say oh well we can look back in retrospect and see that christ is our near kinsman and he's a kinsmen redeemer and boaz in playing this part of redeeming ruth was playing the part of christ there's something in this that can be go there this this type let me say this way this can become a revelation to you and it's more than just the the connecting the dots of a type like if it can become a revelation to you it's more than just saying oh well there's god is perfected in threes or seven is the number of completion and there's three of this and there's seven of that and you see these different types lining up and all this happened and that happened and things seem to kind of fit on a theological theological realm but when it becomes a revelation to you it's not even the type anymore that gets you excited it's the truth that does and remember as believers we find truth first and then the types stand out to us we don't look at something and say how can i get a type out of this oh this is neat this there's got to be a type here you read about a technology you read about an invention you read about a biological process you read about some sickness or you read about some study and go oh there's a perfect type here no you want to see truth and then once you see truth types can just start lining up so first have a solid grasp of truth and once you have a solid grasp of truth you can begin to see the types and so what this is what we'll do is not look at the book of ruth so that we can just mine out types hoping to find truth but with the revelation that you've received begin to begin to see these types begin to line up and it get more rich and more rich to you and more inspiring and more thrilling to see that god has been foreshadowing your calling since even the time when this book was written now ruth chapter 1 verse 1. and so it's 7 47 time to take off ruth chapter 1 verse 1. we're just going to take it phrase by phrase uh and um just to look at the first verse here to get set the scene for the book of roots so remember it's a it gives the very lines of redemption it's the most beautiful story of jesus christ almost one of the most greatest stories there is of the type of christ and so as in ruth chapter one verse 1 now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled i want to focus on this statement here in this time period here it's the days when the judges ruled as if you read the book of judges you'll find that it was a time of anarchy for the children of israel at times it was a time of oppression and it was a specific time period when israel was not ruled by kings and so not being ruled by kings they were ruled by judges and one of the one phrase i want to share with you that speaks about this particular time is in judges chapter 17 verse 6. and it's mentioned in a few places in the book of judges but i think just one uh one scripture will suffice it says in those days there was no king in israel so this characterizes the time of judges is there's no king in israel and this is what's interesting about the use of elimelech because elimelech means my god my king and so here is one element like it would stand for the proposition that although there is no earthly monarchy to israel israel should have been looking to god as their king my god my king and so it's during a time wherein there is no king in israel but every man and this is not a compliment every man did that which was right in his own eyes so this is this is a judgment of israel that there had been a prophet there had been a law and there was responsibilities given out to each tribe there was boundaries that they were to possess there was a way that they were to regard those that possessed that lived within these borders in this promised land and they were to keep god the one true god he was to be their king and it says every man did that which was right in his own eyes it means he was merely doing what he wanted on the terms that he felt was right and if you read the book of judges judges describes israel's wavering faithfulness where they would be hot for jehovah they'd be called for jehovah and actually just kind of shows they're swinging from jehovah to baal and they go from serving him to fallen away serving him to fallen away and this is kind of the story of judges it tells the story of israel's fallen away from god and failing to keep his commandments they were given a word keep the commandments do these things and israel fell away from them as they every man did that which was right in his own eyes and they began to fall away god would send them not prophets necessarily but god would send them delivers that would be raised up and in doing so it caused the nation to seek him again and they would get a little bit of relief in their bondage and that's the story of judges they fall away a judge comes and kind of stirs them up to faithfulness or relieves them of their oppressors delivers them from these other nations and the nation kind of turns for a moment back to god we're going to serve you we're going to do these things right but it was up and down and up and down and this is the time period that the book of ruth is portraying it's written after the time the judges but the story that's portrayed here takes place during the time when judges ruled and the next phrase it says in now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled that there was a famine in the land so there's two things that immediately the writer wants you to begin to ponder and to kind of frame the story of ruth is that it was a time when judges ruled and in particular a time when there was a famine in the land so as we begin to think about famine we've looked into the scripture and found that there come a time so we could see a type here how that there would be famine but not for water for bread but for hearing the word of god so there's a spiritual application and spiritual type where we see a famine in the natural that came upon israel there's a way that this could relate in a time of a spiritual famine and as there's a famine we should immediately think of hunger and that famine hunger that rises to a level of famine where one is famished or a famine that is in the land we have to think how that there's an instinct for survival that kicks in where the bible talks about times of famine and siege where mothers were actually eating their children and that has to be a terrible desperation that would bring someone to a place where they would begin to do that and commit those atrocities we see how that there was a famine in the time of uh uh israel where a widow woman was going to bake the last cake and the last piece of meal and that was going to be it before she died and here comes elijah long to say she he is sustained by this widow woman this widow of zeraphath and the woman believe when i bake this for me and my son we're going to die because that's what famine does so we're thinking about hunger we're thinking about uh a a a desperate hunger that would be setting in and now if you could just i realize that i just i have some your your pull tonight is is especially strong so i kind of have this energy just to preach and and i'm really just wanting just to point some scriptures out more in in a way of doing a teaching but ponder this as it says there was a famine in the land god promised a fruitful land to israel if they were obedient right i mean this was there was a way that canaan was described and there was evidence that was brought back by the spies that went in and here's this here's the evidence of the land it's a good land it's full of abundance and and wealth and riches and so god had promised that the land would be fruitful if they were obedient so if there's a famine in israel what does that tell us that israel had disobeyed and when israel disobeyed god would allow israel's enemies to oppress them and in oppressing them they would take of their harvest and take it to their harvest they would destroy the land and it wouldn't be because their enemies were greater and it wouldn't be because israel wasn't worthy and it wouldn't be because uh god didn't love them but it would be directly connected to their fidelity to the promise that god had given them and he'd made this covenant with israel if you'll do this i'll look out after you if you'll do this i'll drive your enemy out so god had made the promise that israel would be fruitful and that their land would be rich and abundant and if there's a time of famine it tells us that israel had fallen in their part not god on his part it says in the in judges chapter 6 and there's some that believe that this might have been the exact time period that uh the book of ruth transpires is in the time of gideon and knowing that boaz was born of rahab you would there have to be some proximity um in terms of these years that would kind of connect some of these events together and and i'm not necessarily using this to make the claim that this is the exact time and the time of gideon is when roof uh came to no boaz but rather just as an example in the time of ruth how that disobedience brought famine and i think this is instructive to us to remember this judges chapter 6 verses 1 to 4 and the children of israel did evil in the sight of the lord and the lord delivered them unto the hand of the midian seven years now what's the order of this they weren't delivered into the hand of the midians and then begin to do evil so it's not that the enemy overcame them and overwhelmed them and they fell and then they were fell away from their faithfulness but rather they did evil in the sight of the lord and in doing so god's protection was taken away from them for the point of dealing with them getting their attention and so they're delivered in the hand of the media in seven years and the hand of the media prevailed against israel and because of the midianites the children of israel made them that made them the dens which are in the mountains in caves and strongholds and so it was when israel had sown that the midians came up in the amalekites and the children of the east and even they came up against them and they had camped against them and destroyed the increase of the earth till thou come and come into gaza and left no substance sustenance for israel neither sheep nor ox nor ass so how does this begin israel does evil on the side of the lord they're delivered to the hand of the midians and for these seven years the midianites the amalekites the children of the east they come and after israel has planted and after israel has watered and and worked with and tilled and brought their their crops to a harvest then came down all of these and they destroyed the increase of the earth so they they were farming for their enemies they were planting they were sowing they were hoeing they were doing everything they needed to do to have fruit and have increased but at the harvest time they the their increase was destroyed and there was no sustenance left for israel not even uh animal not even sheep uh not even ox nor ass there all these things were taken from them and all of israel's labored was stripped away why because israel had failed god's promises and famine was one of the four judgments that god declared decreed that he would punish israel with if they sinned says it this way in ezekiel chapter 14 verse 13 god god speaks to the son of man and he says son of man when the land sinneth against me by trespassing grievously then will i stretch out my hand upon it it will break the staff of the bread thereof and will send famine upon it and will cut off man and beast from it so this is what god says he will do whenever the land sins grievously against him when they sin grievously he'll break the staff of bread that means their their labor will not produce a fruitful harvest it'll be taken from they'll break the increase of their labor break the staff of bread i will send famine upon it i will cut off man and beast from it and this is exactly what happens in the book of judges they destroyed the increase of the earth till there was no sustenance left for israel neither sheep nor ox nor ass this is exactly what happened so just part of this this is something instructive that we can take from the word of god tonight that famine indicates a disobedience that famine is a red flag famine is a signal famine is something that god would want to use to get your attention that there's more for you to be enjoying or there's some way that he's trying to get your attention that something lacks or there's sin or there's air and so it's something that we can take a step back and take personal ownership of our lives and where we are where we're feeding what we're doing what we're listening to what we're watching what we're joined with what we're supporting and ask ourselves whether or not i am actually in the right lane in the right place in the right field doing what i ought to do because god uses famine to get his people where they need to be he says i'll do it where they sin where they trespass and think about this canaan what was it known as the land flowing with milk and honey this is how it's described i mean this is this is what the pictures on a trip advisor would be this is what the pictures would be on airbnb or verbo like this place is flowing with milk and honey and everywhere milk everywhere honey everywhere grape clusters they're sized where men have to carry them over their shoulders and this would kind of be your image of what the promised land would be and could you imagine if these are all the stories you told and then you showed up at a time like this you say well i think i was uh i think i've been lied to and i was told that it was going to be beautiful and there would be a ah what an infinity pool and the weather would be perfectly 78 degrees every day and and they would have this and it would have that it was going to be awesome and glorious and be perfectly instagramable vacation but man this is horrible this is awful this isn't good this is and who would be at fault not the photographer not the one that not the one that gave the listing not the one that had the original reviews that came by the spies that went in and checked out the land it would be israel's fault they let it fall into disrepair they let it become something that it was really wasn't or less than what its potential was through their own disobedience the land which was flowing with milk and honey had become a wasteland and it was israel's responsibility you say well god's the one that caused it yes but why because israel failed he said in leviticus leviticus chapter 26 verses 18 to 20. again this is prior to them entering into the promised land or before they enter in i was taught in law school to not say prior to if you could say before because prior two is two words and if you could say something in one word you want to say it in one word for prior two is just trying to be fancy right it's what you would expect a lawyer to say but i was taught in law school to simplify simplify simplify so before this is before uh we come to the book of ruth this is instructions as they're entering in before they enter in it says and if you will not yet for all and if you will not yet for all if this hearken unto me if you will not listen to him and do what he ask then i will punish you seven times more for your sins okay all right you talk about things being unjust and not fair well you're punishing me seven times worth that because this is this is what god will do notice what he says i will break the pride of your power i will make your heaven as iron in your earth as brass and your strength shall be spent in vain this is speaking directly about their labor the earth being as brass is what they can get out of it and they're cultivating for your land shall not yield her increase neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits i hope this paints a picture for you when you read now it came to pass in in the days when the judges ruled that there was a famine in the land that that should not just be oh there was a downturn in the market or there was a market correction there's some consolidation happening and and and it became a a bear market and the bull market was over and all the interest rates were going up and all that's not though it was happening this is a famine brought by god as a result of israel's disobedience so time of disobedience in a time of betraying the things of god and turning their back on the things of god there was a suffering that took place there was a uh there was a judgment that was being met out and if you take the time of gideon to be instructive in this time it was then that god raised up gideon and gideon then went out and destroyed and chased away and relieved israel of this burden by turning them back to god and delivering them of their oppressors and their enemies and so god has their way of bringing these things back but as we read about it now came to pass in the days when the judges ruled that there was a famine in the land this is why there was a famine in the land the very next phrase in a certain man of bethlehem judah the certain man is elimelech he is the husband of naomi his name meaning my god my king he came from bethlehem judah bethlehem judah is used to distinguish from bethlehem of zebulon but this phrase means the house of bread and praise here's a man who's living in a place called the house of bread and praise the house of god's praise the house of god's bread and in a time of famine there's a certain man of bethlehem judah now we know we know that what begins to take place so we can make this comment now that the impact on bethlehem is what makes this famine so striking why was it called bethlehem as a very fertile place it was bethlehem because it was rich and it had good soil and it produced abundant crops and it was kind of like a bread basket it'd be like when we think about uh the midwest or different places in america he said this is america's bread basket and this is where agriculture reigns and this is where farming takes place and this is where we grow our crops and our grains and our corns and all these different things and this is this is what feeds america and this is what puts food on the table bethlehem was a place that would have been known for being very fertile and very rich and producing a lot of crops and then to know that here is one that lives in a place called the house of bread and a famine comes so he has to leave i'd be like leaving a buffet when you're hungry well that doesn't make sense shouldn't there be enough food there shouldn't there be something to eat and what's so striking about bethlehem christ it's not yet known in the in the scripture where he will come but we know in matthew chapter 2 verse 1 that it says now when jesus was born in bethlehem of judea in other words christ was born in bethlehem judah and now here's the story of one who is in bethlehem judah but there comes a famine and he leaves the very place that is ordained to bring forth the messiah that should be a that should be a red flag that should be a signal and there's a way that you could plead on an elimelech's case to say well a man who does not provide for his family is worse than an infidel and if there was needs that were coming up and there was famine and and these things need to be taken care of then this is why he leaves and this is why he travels but notice where he's leaving he's leaving a place that god had permanently fixed it's not like abraham's soul journey and the famine comes and he goes down into egypt but this is a place that god had permanently fixed and established and so now there's a certain man of bethlehem judah a place which is a place of god's praise a place of god's bread a place that christ is going to come from and a certain man of bethlehem judah went to sojourn in the country of moab it could have been translated the field of moab or the fields of moab and i found that to be very informative to me because it's not so much a foreign country but it was the fields you're going from a place called the house of god's bread that would have acres and acres and hills of of crops and grains and a place that was very uh bring forth abundant life and grains that could be harvested and used to make bread to where it's known as the house of bread but now they leave that field and eliminate leaves that field with his wife and two sons and comes to the fields of moab the fields of a stranger and what was it that drove him there famine we know why the famine was there but what was moving him famine hunger was driving him but i want you to realize he's going the wrong way he's right there in bethlehem judah he's in the place that god had fixed israel a place that was called their promised land a place that they should put their feet a place that they should not remove themselves and it says that a certain man of bethlehem judah during this time of famine in the days when the judge's rule went to sojourn in the country or the fields of moab now the phrase souljarn should tell us to sojourn it suggests that they left with every intention of returning that this would be the idea well there's a famine right now so i'm just going to leave to go find work over here and then whenever a job opens back up there we'll get back in church right kind of put it in modern parlance right i'm just going to do this for a while until another opportunity comes up what usually happens let me use one that maybe doesn't offend all of us how many people have dropped out of college and said i'm just going to work for a while and save up some money then go back again any of you ever done that did you ever go back i know you did she ended up going back sister ruth and go away those are how appropriate but there's a lot of people who do that and get used to what the money and they never go back why something breaks that discipline something breaks that vision they intend to just work for a while and save up their money and go back but a lot of times they don't go back and a lot of people say oh well i'm just going to do it for a little bit i know what i should be doing i know what i ought to do but i'm just going to do this for a little bit and they think well i can just swing this way kind of catch up a little bit maybe save a little bit of money go into babylon and get a little bit of gold then swing right back again and be right back where i'm supposed to be and there's a danger in doing that the danger that is expressed even here in the story of ruth for elimelech and his two sons but to say that he was going to soldier and it it it stands for the proposition that in their minds we're just going to leave for a little bit but we're going to come back but i want you to see this image and i hope you can see this i had made it larger and i realized now that i've let you down tremendously so we all come up to the front and sit cross-legged here at the front and you see the whole the whole picture here it's very difficult to see but for them to leave bethlehem hope you can see this can you see a little bit of a can you make out a red line kind of in the middle there there's bethlehem just above judah to leave bethlehem and make it all the way down to moab to come up here on your left at about 10 o'clock and to get to where you're about four o'clock over here to do that they'd have to pass right by where jerusalem ultimately was past the ruins of jericho past the red sea across the jordan river back on the wrong side of jordan i think they're going back the opposite way as they travel this way past all these things into the wilderness that god ultimately had to lead them out of the wilderness of judea the wilderness there on the wrong side of jordan this is where they they went around time and time again and they were there in the wilderness that god had delivered out of they have to cross the jordan river and go all the way down to the land of moab they're reversing the exodus it's like they're going right back this is what god called them out of as they cross over and this is the route that they took in the exits and they crossed over the jordan river coming from your right to your left into jericho and conquered jericho but now it's almost as if they pushed rewind and they're going right back out go right back to what god called them out of go right back to a wilderness that they were only sustained in because god would give them manna from heaven every day and that god gave them quail to eat and that god sustained them during that time he says whenever you enter into the promised land these things will cease and from that point on you're going to have a new diet when you enter into the promised land so there was a promise of clean proven there was a promise of substance there was a promise that god would keep them but in order for them to leave bethlehem they had to go backwards and enter back into the wilderness that god had already called them out of now what i want you to catch and looking at that map and seeing the path that they went this was a clear departure from the promised land this wasn't them just trying to find another place in israel that was more verdant and more fertile and something that would uh give them a a better chance of surviving they leave the promised land and go into the wilderness they signed up for that they did that there's no there's no a pro there's no instruction in the word of god that says that when things get rough in israel you can go ahead and go into the wilderness that if you find that you're not being fed in the promised land then you can go back to moab and figure out a way to get by for a few years and then and then return back there's no prescription like that in the word of god god does not tell his children hey you know what if things get a little tough why don't you just abandon truth for a while and see if you can't get a little bit of emotional stimulus in the world and get a little bit of money and save up here and do this and pad your resume and do a bunch of things and then when whenever it seems like it gets a better opportunity to come back around he does not ask us to do that but let me just say in his grace when we have he makes a way for us to come back and that's what the story of ruth can speak to us and show us that even when there has been a wonder and even when there has been a going back to the wilderness there's still a promised land in a way back across the jordan river that door forever remains open for his elect i have no fear in preaching to god's elect that the door of grace remains open that the way of salvation always remains and it's not too late since the famine then was god's discipline for them to flee israel into moab was resisting god i want you to catch this even brother branagh makes the statement about naomi being backslid and so that to me was very instructive that really helped me to understand because at first you reading think well was elimelech doing the right thing and was this what he ought to have done but you realize that he's characterized now though we see a beautiful story unfold right this may be the paradox sometimes of the way that god does things but we see here one's disobedience god is going to use to tell a beautiful story of redemption and so there's there's going to be a great redemption that comes out there's going to be a bringing in just as israel's blinded and now i find myself kind of getting into where i wanted to touch on next time there's a blinding of israel so that the gentiles are brought in there's a hardening of elimelech's heart so he's brought into moab but he's going to bring ruth out of it but catch how that in doing this this is a this is a rejection of god that's what elimelech did when he did this he stopped trusting in god he was rejecting god by leaving israel and going into moab and it's a it's a caution to us it's a real warning to us let this be a warning to us let's just take this first as some teaching from the scripture it exposes now even now our tendencies as believers to seek worldly resources when things get difficult or to seek to be buffet uh to kind of be buffered by or supported by or increased by worldly things when we have transgressed against god so when we find that things are not working out and maybe we're fully aware of this is because my own disobedience elimelech should have looked around and said you know what the reason why things are the way they are is we have forsaken god and therefore elimelech should have called upon god tore down his grove sought the lord sought repentance sought him who made a promise to israel but instead of doing the repentance and doing the works of restoring yourself to god it seems so easier to seek solace in the things of the world we get into a spot emotionally where we just we're feeling uh pent-up pressure we feel like we kind of let the lord down we're feeling a little bit of strange from the lord instead of seeking restoration with god we can seek solace and entertainments and reliefs and i just want to go on a vacation i just want to go find a beach and lay down on it for a while and i just want to go do this and do that and there's a way that we want to catch this release and release this pressure and it exposes a limb like move into moab exposes this tendency to seek worldly resources instead of seeking restoration with god and i think it's just something that we need to remember and remind ourselves even if we do it by way of discipline and just instructing ourselves when i find myself unsettled when my when i find myself on edge let me not reach for worldly resource but let me seek solace in christ say lord is there is there something that needs to be restored is there something that's missing is there something you're teaching me and seek that first instead of going to moab and hoping that in moab you'll find what you need in deuteronomy chapter 11 verses 13 to 17 i wanted to read this so you can kind of see the whole a whole passage where god deals with both sides of this and why there was a famine in the land in the days when the judges ruled and this certain man elimelech from bethlehem judah went to soldier in the country of moab it says in deuteronomy chapter 11 verses 13 to 17 and it shall come to pass if ye if you shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which i command you this day to love the lord your god and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul notice what he'll do that i will give you the reign of your land in his due season god's not a liar he said if you do this you'll get rain the first rain and the latter rain so here's the the rain at the time of planting the rain at the time of harvesting that thou mayest gather in thy corn and thy wine and thine oil if you serve me you're going to get your reign and for israel this is very literal for israel there's a spiritual type for us as believers and and though there's even a natural type i believe that god will give you provision that you need even nationally promotions and better jobs and checks in the mail when you weren't expecting one and refunds when you didn't know you had one and all sorts of things if you obey him and serve him but for israel this was very literal serve me spiritually dedicate yourself to me with your whole heart and your whole mind and do my commandments and you're going to get rain when you plant and rain when you harvest and you're going to have wine and oil and corn you're going to have everything you need to live he says and i will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle that thou mayest eat and be full you're gonna have cattle that are fat you're gonna eat beef you're gonna be able to eat the lamb you're gonna have milk you're gonna have all the corn you're gonna have all the wheat you can have everything you need you have everything for your table if you serve me he says take heed yourselves verse 16 that your heart be not deceived and you turn aside and serve other gods and worship them could this be a warning to not get too comfortable wow isn't this great all our cows are fat and we got a lot of wine and we got a lot of oil and everything's going really really good and then what happens you get a little comfortable and getting a little comfortable you forget i only have this because god's blessing me the only reason why we have any of this is because we're serving him not because you're good enough not because you're smart enough not because you're dynamic enough what a reminder to all of us as christians if you're if there's blessings in your life acknowledge from whom they come if you're doing well on your job if you're making good decisions with your clients if you're if you're building a good product if you're supervising well if things are just clicking along and humming along and everything's going well stop and say thank you lord this is not because of my talent this is not because of my charisma this isn't because of my good business sense this is because of you lord you've blessed the works of my hand you've given me things and how we ought to do that as a church that if we see god blessing us it's not because of dynamic ministry it's not because of a dynamic personality it's not because one man was faithful it's because god is faithful he's the one that gives the increase he's the one that blesses he's the one that nourishes what a reminder to us that if things are going well and things are being blessed and things are abundant to stop and say oh god i'm humbled by your greatness because these things are your blessing so he says take heed to yourself because he says if you do that verse 17 and then the lord's wrath be kindled against you and all of a sudden oh what happened i thought i was really smart i thought i figured out cycles and i thought i knew how to plant and rotate crops and i had all the i had the farmer's almanac that told me this year was going to be a bumper crop and i had everything figured out but the lord's wrath was kindled against you and he shut up the heavens that there be no rain and that the land yield not her fruit unless you perish quickly from off the good land which the lord giveth you that's what happened in the days when the judges ruled and there was a famine in the land and a certain man of bethlehem judah went to sojourn in the land of moab who it says he and his wife and his two sons here they are they're living out scripture exactly the things that god had warned and judges the things he had worn in leviticus and the things he expounded upon in ezekiel the very things that were said beforehand in deuteronomy 11 these very things are being lived out by this man his wife and his two sons we read the next few verses in our text the next few verses tell the story of the misery that awaited this family in moab it doesn't tell us what they were looking for when they went to moab but we could suspect that they hoped that they would find something better than what they had in bethlehem judah grain or wheat corn or something to live by it's really remarkable that you consider this move when all their rights and privileges and all these laws and redemption and provision were prophesied in the promised land remarkable that they would leave it but when we get to verse 5 the scripture writes it this way i believe for impact that only the wife remains of those that left it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled that there was a famine in the land and a certain man of bethlehem judah went to soldier in the country of moab he and his wife and his two sons but yet when the story gets to verse 5 only the wife remains she's the only one left of those that went out i say the book of ruth begins very dark doesn't it but remember what brother branham said about it he said every word of it's inspired every word of it fits together just like a dovetail on a plank he says it give this book gives out the very lines of redemption it's a beautiful little story well seems kind of foreboding right you read this you're just kind of in the bookstore and you you open up you start reading what section am i in horror what happened this is this is dark this is depressing i i wanted a kind of a it's a pick-me-up i wanted a good love story well it doesn't start out that way more like a tragedy but he says man he pass over that book many of you run over the top of that not thinking what it is but it's one of the greatest stories in there of the type of christ the most beautiful story the lord jesus almost in all of the old testament so though it starts out this way and though there's something to be gained by pondering what was taking place when the judges ruled why was there a famine in the land and why the danger was an element like leaving bethlehem judah to go even if it was just for a short period of time in the country of moab there's still a beautiful story that's shaping up and taking place brother brahma says in the message kinsman redeemer and maybe this would be a sermon for you all it'd be nice to me if all the church is reading the book of ruth and listening to some of these messages together in our own personal devotion it brings a little bit of continuity to us as a body when we gather for the word but kinsman redeemer would be a wonderful sermon to listen to he says this book of ruth was one of the outstanding books that they accepted in other words it was brought into the canon of scripture it was preserved within the old testament why if it's just a love story why would the writers and ancient sages accept this book as inspired it was just trying to tell you oh oh this is a neat story this is the q so you got to hear this if it's kind of like a paul harvey the rest of the story good day then i mean why would you put it in the bible right why would you leave it in there that paul harvey is a shout out to those of us in the congregation who know who paul harvey is god bless you good day he said why would the writers and ancient sages accept this book as inspired you follow this look what it says because there's a hidden revelation in it oh i like that because there's a hidden revelation in it and in this hidden revelation you catch the real meaning and it'll bring you real close to god that should start to get you a little bit excited about it right to think about in this book that some just pass right over that some recognizes a love story others may say well yeah i kind of see this type of christ as the kinsmen redeemer but there's a hidden revelation and in this hidden revelation you can catch the real meaning and in catching the real meaning it will bring you real close to god i want to be brought real close to god and i want to bring i want to be brought as close to god as i possibly can i want to be brought so close together with god where there's no difference i i want my entire identity to be lost in him i want there to be such a union where it's indivisible i want there to be a complete losing of my personality a complete losing of my indented identity i want to be so lost in him towards christ that lives within me so then i want this revelation i want to catch a real meaning not not so that i can wow my co-workers and i can spin somebody's head with types and and shadows but i want to be brought close to god because there's a revelation in this that when you catch it it'll bring you close to god he says i pray my whole soul this morning this is the prayer of the prophet my whole soul that god will catch every heart so spellbound there's a story in here and there's a there's a line the very lines of redemption this is the hidden revelation in the lines of redemption that if you can catch a revelation of it it it begins to hold you spellbound your affection your attraction is drawn to these lines of redemption you're so you're so drawn to it where this is i'm spellbound and the world tries to distract you the world tries to get you caught up in other things the world tries to get your attention over here about this get your attention over here about that oh did you hear about this vaccine did you hear about this political move did you hear about this anniversary did you hear about this and you're like i'm too spellbound ain't nobody got time for that i'm too spellbound i'm focused on something there's something happening i'm seeing the very lines of redemption are being drawn out before me and i want to be held spellbound by the word of god catch every heart so spellbound until he'll reveal himself just what he is in this story what he is to you and how to accept him don't you want to catch what he is to you don't you want to be held spellbound by what he is just what he is in the word of god what he is in the message of the hour just what he is and what he is to you and how to accept him he says and when once you see it it's so simple you wonder how you ever went over the top of it it says but it can only be revealed by the holy spirit not just study not discipline but it's revealed by the holy spirit a hidden revelation i want to pick up in this statement if god will let us maybe more in some of the future services but that speaks to what we've received in this end time it's what you're feasting on saints let's stand together tonight there's a hidden revelation in this book not adding to but hidden revelations and unfolding and revealing that as it's revealed to you it brings you closer to god amen i want to draw i want to draw closer to him and to do so he needs to reveal himself to me and that's what i desire let's bow our heads in prayer tonight with our heads bowed our hearts open our gracious heavenly father it's been good to have been in your house tonight i admit as a brother it's nice to see so many seats full and and to see friends and family to see the faithfulness of the people that pull away from the demands of laodicea and come to church [Music] some who i know have pulled away by way of streaming or we'll find that time a moment in the near future to to maybe pick up a message in the archive those things are thrilling or to see that personal side of it and the human side of it but when you consider that what we're gathered around is not a meeting location when you see a group like this wait we didn't we're not coming to this church because this is where our family's always gone we're not coming to this church because this is where we were raised [Music] in some ways lord we've come like ruth something deep within a stronghold we know not what it is but just a profession your god will be my god your people will be my people we find ourselves here tonight enjoying gatherings like this again not because we see the seats full and we see the faces of the people but knowing that it's something supernatural taking place we sense it in your word as it's coming forth that you're speaking to us for the moment that we're living in lord we look back through time and i i testify as as a son of god who's been raised in this glorious message that we have had the best of preaching the best of sermons the types expressed and the truth revealed and men of god who've gone gone before myself through the 70s and 80s and 90s and 2000s lord for decades they've been preaching these things and establishing these things so i said lord it's not that we have something new to speak [Music] but i'm so thrilled to hear the word the same word preached and though we could even know that these things have been shared and these quotes have been used and these scriptures have been expounded upon it's fresh to us today and it resonates within our souls as living manna as inspired word for the moment that we're living in right now that though we have been fed well and though we have been led well and though we have been sustained [Music] you have once again come and done something special to take us further to take us higher by opening up your word to us freshly inspiring us newly not some new revelation lord not some secret messenger that's gonna pop up and do this but it's the word that you've given for ruth it was a new
