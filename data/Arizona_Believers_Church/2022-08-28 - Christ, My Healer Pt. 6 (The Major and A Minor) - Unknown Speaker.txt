TRANSCRIPT
========================================
it is in a Church age book in the pergamian church age brother Branham takes these scriptures here in Hebrews chapter 6 and since we're on the subject of Divine Healing and um and some of the different things that kind of relate to that and we might think of in terms of what leads up to that and what accomplishes the physical healing or what steps we need to go through in order to receive our healing we've been um kind of a lane a foundation and I think I've got maybe a couple more services on the foundation before we come to some particular subjects and it may very well be that there's several parts on a foundation and just one part on the the actual Divine Healing but it's very a necessary foundation and build up when brother Brown looks at this he mentions how that in these very verses there's an evident manifestation of spiritual gifts that Paul is saying uh there's a demonstration there's a manifestation he says he refers to the same wonderful blessings and the same wonderful manifestations of the spirits or things that brother Branham is looking at and he takes it from the standpoint of these wonderful blessings and these wonderful manifestations of the spirit are no Vindication that the individual is an elect seed it's no Vindication that even the individual is filled or sealed with the Holy Ghost he says but he will admit that anytime you see these kind of wonderful manifestations that it is the Holy Spirit but you can't take it to vindicate alone it's not the sole Vindication of something so he really brings out a lot of depth to it and I'm not going to come back to some of those verses uh verses four through eight today maybe in another time but when he's looking at that he makes the statement that Jesus did not emphasize Works uh stress the importance of works as much as he did the word so you could have wonderful Works wonderful manifestations but that's not the emphasis and so last time we ministered on this subject it was in we were in John chapter six so if you want to turn there to verse 25 and I'm realizing now that we had ministered on faith the last time and so I think these things all tie in together but we'll go through John chapter 6 verses 25 to 31 a little bit to kind of catch us all up together because I think it was on a Wednesday night that we had preached part five it says and this is after the miracle of uh the multiplication of the bread and the fish and a tremendous Miracle fed five thousand and there were leftovers and there was people that were just stunned at this great ministry and so he's creating quite a following and it says and he was gone he was not at the place anymore where these this miracle transpired so they start seeking them and they cross the they cross the the lake to find them to see and when they'd found him on the other side of the sea they sent him Rabbi when cameth thou hither maybe they're wanting to know more is there another miracle what happened how did you do this Jesus answered them and said verily verily I say unto you ye seek me not because you saw the Miracles but because you did eat the Loaves and were filled very blunt statement that you are seeking me and you want to find me but you're not finding me because the Miracles have had this deep impact on your soul or it's awakened you to prophetic scriptures or you see the Messiah standing before you but you're more interested in eating the bread and being filled so it's only something that satisfies the flesh that's what's drawing you to me right now so he says labor not for the meat which perisheth but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life so there's something that you can labor for that you can seek after that you could desire to have you could desire to feed on an experience versus just this things that satisfy the flesh he says which the son of man shall give unto you so this is something that the son of man feeds you with for him hath God the Father sealed then said they unto him almost as if it just can wait completely over their head what shall we do that we might work the works of God Jesus answered and said to them this is the work of God bringing him back to this Center this base this is the work of God that you believe on him whom he hath sent so when the word when the Miracles have been manifested you know that there's been a genuine work of God in your life when you believe the word you know there's been a genuine impact of the signs and wonders when it brings you to deeper relationship with God and you become more familiar with his word and his person as opposed to all the different blessings he can pour out on you I think there's a way that Christianity has kind of evolved towards it's just this superficial uh enjoyment of the spirit and the blessings and the riches and all the things he could do for you in this natural life and it's kind of become untethered from the from where God is wanting to lead us as just doing some reading on while we are away and and many times I try to find things that I could read that could just help me to better understand the mind of God and the things that he's trying to do and sometimes I just try to take a look at certain subjects and things and I was reading one particular book and it was kind of on a spiritual awakening in America kind of the a modern day Christian writer and he said that one of the worst things about Christianity is there is there preaching on the rapture and I thought that was interesting and maybe I could just leave that right there but it's there is a there's a way that the whole idea of the Rapture is so ridiculous that it's of no benefit whatsoever at all but you can't take the the afterlife the life to come and The Eternity and remove that from the picture of Christianity because Paul says if we don't have that then we of all people are most miserable and so it has to be in view and he says that this is the work of God that you believe on him whom he hath sent that there's something that goes beyond the Flesh and you're looking to a supernatural you're looking to a time when everything will be consummated in its fullness and you'll forever be with the Lord and they said therefore unto him and maybe this is the part I was thinking that where it's almost as if either they're wanting to troll him or they're just uh not picking it up at all they said what signs show us thou then that we may see and believe thee what does thou work as if what he had done was not enough and and I even think that there's some speculation that they think that he crossed the sea miraculously because they said how did you get here we saw the boats leave we know that you didn't go with them we kind of just tell us a little bit more about how you got here and there's a um there's there's something that's missing they're just not the dots aren't connecting for them and they make the same and our fathers did eat man in the desert as written he gave them bread from Heaven to eat and Jesus continues to say well I am the bread from Heaven I am the true bread of life I am the way the truth of life I eat my flesh and drink my blood that way you can have everlasting life and it just kind of aggravates them more but what I want you to take from this scene is there's Christ The Living Word of God that makes God present The Living Word that's making God present to the people here's the Messiah and we're getting this glimpse of human behavior and we none of us can excuse ourselves from it really because this is just how the carnal mind works to where they're looking more to the Natural seeking the signs Desiring the Miracles and and wanting to receive a benefit In the Flesh fill up their bellies and and have a friend who can always get a food for all of us as long as there's one piece of bread and they're looking to only the things that could benefit the flesh cash and they're missing the point that there has to be a deeper penetration it has to be something that's developing uh saving the soul developing character there's something that they're missing and it says in verse 2 and the great multitude followed him because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased so here is the actual they're following him because of the Miracles they are following because of the signs and it's still not enough what other sign are you gonna do what other Miracle are you going to do and brother Matthew Watkins touched on some of the very scriptures that I want to bring into our view and we'll hold them for another time this is a wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign he says but I'll give you a sign and so there is something uh amiss about seeking signs and always looking for signs there's a signs that we ought to be aware of they're signs that God gives and we want to catch those but there's there's kind of like this Tipping Point as I use that phrase where now all you do is seek signs all you want it gets to a place where now you go wild with it and all you're wanting is The Sensational from a physical standpoint not a supernatural one and so they followed him because of the Miracles and the Miracles were brother Brown says to attract their attention but it's to get their attention it's a sign as brother Brown says I and I as I was with Moses he says it's the sign not the destination when you see the sign you haven't necessarily arrived but it's pointing you to the destiny and so the sign is not the ultimate the manifestation In the Flesh of those works are not the ultimate or the absolute and I'll just read this very quickly I don't have it on the slide he says oh yes they solve the Miracles they saw the word anointed they eat the manna that come from Heaven they enjoyed the blessings of the atonement and this is this is why when they say our father is eight men in the desert brother Adams now amplifying that and it's also applicable to those who stood there in John's sick because they ate bread from the very hand of Christ he says they saw this smitten Rock give us water they drank from it they were personally acquainted with it but when it come to Breaking that word and this is this is what happens in John chapter six and we we use this in John chapter six this is the third pull of the opening of the word and he's showing that when it came to Loaves and fish and those different things they were happy signs wonders wonders Miracles manifestations but then when the word begins to be broken and that begins to be shared then that's where they lock up and they walk away and it's in the sermon go awake Jesus that I think we use this um on that Wednesday night he said he give them some strong Doctrine his healing days were just about over he didn't care wasn't going to heal too much more he was going to tell them about something that was better now healing is good right we can all agree that healing is good and some of us need it and our bodies even right now we're desires of it it's not a bad thing to want to be healed and it's a great thing when God heals you so let's not take Divine Healing in any way and cast it as a bad thing put in a negative light make it that it's not desirable and take the message and twist it to where now we're all believers saying oh healing who cares about that right that's a that would be a perverting of the word but he said he's going to tell them about something that was better this is the breaking of the word something that was better he began to tell him that he he's there he there revealed to them who he actually was so there can be manifestations of his presence and brother Branham talks about Elijah and there he was and there was the earthquake and there was the wind and there was the fire and those were the effects of God passing by but that wasn't the ultimate he wasn't in that he was in The Voice and so he's going to tell him who he actually was so there's things that he could be doing giving you signs but then once the signs get your attention he wants to reveal himself who he actually is in the day that he's living in the day that he's manifesting himself so in this uh another foundational service on Christ my healer and the subject Divine Healing my subtitle is the major and the minor because we want to look more how brother Ram talks about the major and a minor so the major and a minor and Hebrews chapter 6 verses 1 to 3. it says therefore leaving the principles of the doctrines of Christ let us go on into Perfection and it's such a remarkable phrase not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of Faith toward God and of the doctrine of baptisms and on the lane on of hands and of the resurrection of the dead and of Eternal judgment these are all things we believe these are principles of the faith they are part of our faith and our conviction and he says and this will we do if God permit what will we do leave the principles of the doctrine of Christ and go on into Perfection not laying foundations again and it's so it's a very very heavy statement we'll do it if God permits and there's some that take this these very verses where Paul says let's leave the principles of the doctrine of Christ and it it can have a little bit of since we're Believers and we know the scripture maybe it doesn't strike us this way but it could sound as if Paul is saying hey Christ was partial he was incomplete he wasn't perfect so let's leave that and let's go on to something better it's not in that but that's not what he's saying he's saying that there's and we'll maybe try to amplify it here he said let's go first let's go higher let's build on this and so therefore leaving the principles that's the the beginning the commencement of something and he says not laying against the foundation again that's the beginning so the first principles of faith so he's asking thus and he's admonishing the Hebrews and we could have gone into chapter five how he wanted to teach them other things and he felt that he couldn't because they were become they needed milk and not they couldn't handle strong meat so we're talking about the meat of the word of God and opening up he's he's wanting to bring them further into who is this Melchizedek and he can't because they haven't really grown in the things that they've been given they haven't been established they haven't really utilized what they've received and put to put themselves in the position for more and so he's saying let's leave that which is the beginning of the source that which is inherent those things exactly the language he's using to say foundation and principles the first principles as he's wanting to it's something that they were permanently United with but he's asking them to leave so how could you do that because the leaving is not abandoning believing as well we've done that let's move on ah Divine Healing we've done that let's move on the manifestation of this we've done that let's move on but he's he's admonishing the believer in this great these great passages I think four five and six all tied together very well and then chapter seven definitely it's telling the whole story but he said let's not just remain where we begin these are the principles of Faith but he's pointing to the Perfection of faith that we believe in Repentance and we believe in faith towards God and we have the doctrine of baptisms and the laying on of hands and and we understand that there's going to be a resurrection and that there's going to be there's going to be a final judgment and and we understand all these principles and these Basics fundamentals of Christianity but there's more there's something better or greater that these things are all the foundation of and he said let's go on to that and so we cannot ever make the mistake of trying to uproot the foundation dig it up tear it up throw it away and make it as if it's nothing or try to move Beyond it as if we're not built on top of it but we can't just always be laying in it we can't always be working on the foundation laying the foundation laying the foundation but we got to advance higher and Paul's talking about that maturity talking about a perfect faith in the sermon perfect faith brother Branham is this is at the end of the sermon and he says this is coming into that third pool this is after the prayer line uh and he says this is coming out of the third pool and he says I'm working out something he's taking this charge of faith and going right back to begin and come in see to kind of raise faith in the bracket where you've never noticed it that way before and I think it's a very beautiful picture that he he he's preaching on perfect faith and he has a prayer line he's laying hands on the sick and he's and he's letting God manifest himself in a way that they were familiar with at that time but then he kind of is nudging them a little bit and trying to encourage them I want to raise Faith to a place that maybe you've never noticed it that way before not a faith but a perfect Faith built up in here he says and watch a perfect god with the perfect heart keep a perfect Promise by his perfect word we do have today that which is perfect right such a beautiful statement which is sharper than a two-edged sword and a discerner of the thoughts of the heart we're coming now to the perfection God's permitting right when that which is perfect this come he says we do have that today let us go on into Perfection teliotes the perfect one the Perfecter and will do it if God permits and here brother I'm saying we're coming to it now God is finally allowing it to come to the climax of Mount Zion we're coming down to the Perfection because the people have to comment to this in order for the rapture says I want to build you up maybe in a way that you've never been before a bracket that raised to another bracket that we haven't been to before he says this is where we've got to come for the Rapture that's what's holding it away right now is waiting for that church to come into that perfect raptured faith so that's what we need is a perfect raptured faith and there's a great picture that he builds in this entire sermon and so I'm not trying to just to sum it all up but I want you to catch that principle of perfect faith for rapture and what he's wanting to build us to and the things he's using to kind of get us to a position to receive and to believe so that we could take steps further now if you go back to the beginning of the sermon this is a statement he makes it towards the very very beginning he says that's what I'm talking on tonight getting to perfect faith it is not an imagination now there's people have come and say oh I've got all Faith oh sure I have well what are you standing here for then I think there's just some of the most like shocking statements especially considering the prayer line he has an hour later you're very your very actions prove that you haven't got what you're talking about so a lot of it's built upon a person's confession and maybe he's uh implying that the person said well I have perfect Faith I've got all the faith to move mountains and and I can do I can do all these great exploits and I've got faith and here I am standing in prayer line says well maybe you don't have as much Faith as you think you have he says if you had Faith then what you stand in a prayer line for what do you do these things for now it's uh it begs the question begs the question of what is what is he what does he mean because we could read that says well what are you doing in a prayer line but it's not it's not dismissive but it's actually self-examination you have faith in your prayer line what are you in the prayer line for right obviously for more faith right you're doing it because there's a scriptural principle you realize your faith is in a certain level so I've gotta I'm coming through this way and and I'm not I think I have the statement maybe it's in my notes for the next service where brother Branham says I'm getting I want to get you to the place where you can receive your healing without hands being laid on you at all but if that's what you need come forward now for prayer what Grace he's not saying well we've shut the door on laying on the hands that's so old-fashioned and Hokey Pokey and everything no but he's saying I'd like for your faith to get to this place but if it's not there yet God will meet you right here in this and so he's saying if you what do you why are you standing in a prayer line what do you do these things for great question it's not to kind of intimidate us into never doing it but to ask ourselves what's the reason in doing it what am I trying to accomplish so that it can not only be effective in that instance but put me further in my faith once it's happened that I'm approaching this prayer line with the reason in my heart and a belief and a conviction and when I come through that prayer line and God meets my need I'm I'm a step further in my faith and I haven't put my locked myself into a habit to where every time I need something from God I've got to Circle back this time of year this time of the day to come back to the same preachers in a prayer line in order to get what I need but my faith is advanced took us to that hierarchy if I'm not here have your pastor pray for you if your pastor can't pray for you have your neighbor pray for you if your neighbor can't do it have your husband pray for if your spouse can't do it pray your fair yourself so it's like there's this growing and maturing to the place where finally one day you stand there and say I am healed I can petition my father I can come boldly before the throne of grace so he says if you had perfect Faith you'd look right straight to God and believe it and walk away you would have no need of coming into prayer line you'd have no need of these things because your faith has done made it so and if the church is waiting for rapturing faith I I'm realizing now there's just a hole there's a mouthful here if the church is needing to come to rapturing Faith then all these things have to be placed right and used to promote it to promote rapturing faith not to promote itself not this feedback loop where it's always it's just an echo chamber of doing we're doing this and this is what we do we're doing this and this is what we do but it's to build perfect faith you have no need to come in a prayer line once you come to perfect your faith because you wouldn't even have need of these things your faith has made it so now in the sermon sir we would see Jesus says now Divine Healing is not all the message that's a key statement just to hold on to Jesus put I think they claimed about 80 percent of his ministry on Divine Healing but as the late brother Bosworth many of you know brother FF Bosworth The Godly saintly man he used to say that Divine Healing is just like the bait on the hook you never show the fish the hook you show him the bait and So Divine Healing is a minor and you can never major on a minor but it leads to the major that was our title for last time our subtitles the minor leads to the major the minor leading to a major it's something that you recognize then that a Divine Healing is a minor then it's not uh who cares about that but when people are getting divinely healed whether it be through the preaching of the word anointing with oil or laying on of hands or the prayer of faith then that should that be leads people to well who why is there Divine Healing what is it for what does it represent and so that he says the minor where you see these minor things it's for the purpose of leading you to the major and so today what I'm wanting to do with this title even the major and a minor is kind of unpack a little bit what the major is and what what does a major even mean what is the major and what is a minor what does it mean because there are numerous statements and I'm sure you can attest to this numerous statements for brother banham says to this extent you can't major on a minor and he does it in reference to most often to Divine Healing and he says you can't here's Divine Healing he says it's a minor it's a minor it's a minor but you can't major on a minor and he goes to that emphasis so often that it's not just this one statement where he's quoting FF Bosworth and we're kind of like well it's a little bit of an outlier not sure what to do with it but it's just over and over again you can't major on a minor you can't major on a minor so what is a major what do you major on what is a what is what are these other minors maybe you could even ask but he says here very directly and he says it many times Divine Healing is a minor what does that mean it's under the age of 21. no it means that it's not the main thing anyway it says Divine Healing is a minor it's the it's not the it isn't the most important it's not the sole objective Divine Healing isn't the the thrust what we're trying to achieve alone it's not the ultimate that we have church and we have meetings and we preach the gospel and we do all these things so that we can just have a um a mechanism of healing our bodies and so that's what brother Bradham is I believe his emphasis is when he says Divine Healing is a minor he said it's not the main thing but although it's not the main thing or it's not the absolute or the ultimate it complements and supports the main thing so you have you have a you have the major there or there's something that you're to Major on and we'll get into some of these statements here in a moment that this is what I want to Major on and Divine Healing is a minor so I'm going to Major on this and I'm I'm going to minor on this but the minor he says leads to the major so if if he goes into this area of well why would you even spend any time in the minor that's because you've got to meet people in a certain way to get their attention and build them up build them up to a place where now they can be they can come to and be led to the main thing and so you have to start where people are you have to start with the center you have to start with them and the fact that they're a sinner and that you have to start in certain ways to build attention and to build a maybe a poor choice of words but to build their rapport with Christ and with the word and so it's not it may not be the main thing but it complements the main thing it supports the main thing the sermon sir we would see Jesus this is not the same sermon we just quoted from a different instance a few years prior he says last meeting kindly speaking to you on salvation on us on salvation plan and I want this to be clearly known that Divine Healing is not a major plan of God that's a it doesn't make this statement I I don't know that he makes this exact statement anywhere else but he says it's not a major plan of God Divine Hill is not a major plan of God and we can never major on a minor So Divine Healing is not the major plan of God it's not God's sole emphasis it's not what God is present trying to do alone he says because it's not his major plan I can't major on something that is his minor plan he says but Divine Healing is included in the Plan of Salvation for God and from that statement alone you could gather that he is identifying the major plan of God relates to Salvation and he's saying is that Divine Healing though then is included in the Plan of Salvation but the main thing is salvation Divine Healing is not a major plan and so if Divine Healing is a minor then what is the major and in many contexts as we've just read here salvation was the major in Matthew chapter 10 verse 28 it says fear not them which kill the body but are not able to kill the soul but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and Body in hell so man can make the body sick man can hurt the body man can harm the body man can do it he is able to do to try to repair or promote healing and address certain infections or breaks or whatever it might be in the body and so man can do things to the body but God is able to destroy the soul he's able to save the soul he's able to make a body sick he's also able to heal the body and he says you should fear God who's able to destroy the soul and Body in hell so there's something about the flesh that we all like the flesh we love the flesh we're only here because we are flesh but he says we ought not to only be enamored with the things that relate to the flesh or fear the things that can harm the flesh or be all worried about what's taking place in the flesh but fear God who's able to destroy the soul and the body along with it in hell and so it's the soul that is the most important thing it's the main thing the salvation of the Soul Brother Batman and sir we would see Jesus again this is a different one than the other two that we've already quoted quoted from 63 and 60 now 61 and the main part of my service is based of course upon salvation Divine Healing is a minor and no one can never major with a minor no one can never and no one can never major with a minor though some try I guess they just can't do it but he's saying that there's the main part of a service is based upon salvation he says of course and then because the expectations of the people he's saying now Divine Healing is a minor and we can't major on that the main part is salvation in the sermon Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he says now we talk about Divine Healing mostly in my meetings but Divine Healing is not what we try to Major with you can never major on a minor Divine Healing is just a gift to present Christ now that no way belittles it Divine Healing is a gift that presents Christ it's a precious thing it's a wonderful thing it's a supernatural thing it's called Divine Healing right not mediocre healing not Humane healing Divine Healing some God does it's a miracle let's not ever put it in a negative light never take any promise of God making fun of anointing with oil making fun of speaking with tongues never make fun of anything you shouldn't just make fun of anybody but why would we take things in the word of God and ridicule it and be so careful the attitudes we can take sometimes towards things Divine Healing is a gift to present Christ Divine Healing to catch the people's attention to let them know that Jesus loves them and the main thing that we are after is the healing of the human soul that men that are born again have eternal life and shall never perish but be raised up again at the last day that's the objective is to be born again which is to seal your soul with the Holy Ghost guaranteeing you a resurrection guaranteeing you that if you alive and remain at the time of the translation you will be changed that's the emphasis the main thing that we're after is the the salvation of the human soul the healing he says of the human soul the sermon hear ye him he says tonight was an Evangelistic call friends Divine Healing is just a minor you can never major on a minor as I said salvation of the soul is much greater than Divine Healing salvation of the soul is much greater it says in one place salvation is the main thing to the soul Divine Healing is just a minor thing this is an emphasis you find quite often where brother Branham refers to the major and the minor and he's saying that in my meetings and you have to realize I didn't write down the locations but this is from 61 and 56 and 58 and 60 and all these different places 63 just through his entire Ministry spanning decades where he's saying oh this is a mate minor this uh you know the the maybe not decades but in the years that we cover he's saying this is the main emphasis in his meetings and he's saying that here in Phoenix he's saying it in Maine he's saying it overseas he's saying it all over and he's saying it in many different places because he's coming presenting Christ preaching Christ in these Evangelistic services in these healing campaigns and in these Services where people are coming and being drawn to his ministry in the same way that they were to Christ and so when brother man makes these statements over and over and over again about the major and the minor he is in these Evangelistic settings and then from the uh if I could say an Evangelistic service and even from these special meeting standpoints he's saying I don't major on healing but I major on salvation I'm here and I'm only here for the weekend and I don't want to just emphasize healing I want to emphasize salvation because you could be healed and that'll be temporary but if your soul can be saved that would be permanent so as he comes through and he holds multiple night meetings and he preaches the sermon he says if I can this is me just kind of putting in my own words if I can lead you to Christ to have the soul sealed by the new birth then you are now sealed and baptized in the body of Christ a permanent member of something Eternal and if you died with cancer you're coming up in the resurrection yeah and that's the was the main thing in that setting and that from that standpoint he wasn't majoring on healing but Salvation he says this is this was in the when he has an evangelist at College he's coming through as an evangelist now in second Timothy Chapter 4 verses three to five I'm using this scripture because we realize brother Branham this scripture is very precious to him he mentions how that when the day that he built the Tabernacle and he laid the Cornerstone he wrote he wrote this dude the work of an evangelist make full proof of your ministry the things that were contained therein something very precious to brother Branham and this is the where this the that what he was told to write down and put in that Cornerstone it comes from the second Timothy chapter four verses three to five it says for the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine that's what happened when they could endure all the bread and all the fish right but now when it came to the opening of the word breaking that word they couldn't endure it he says but after their own lust shall they sheep Heap to themselves teachers having itching ears and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto Fables what an indictment but watch thou and all things endure afflictions this is Paul to Timothy do the work and evangelist make full proof of your ministry now we mentioned a moment ago brother says now Divine Healing is not all the message evangelism was not all brother brahm's Ministry that wasn't his calling brother branham's calling he was ordained a prophet he's he's Anointed with the spirit of Elijah according to Malachi 4 5. there's other scriptures we could bring into that view and but that's the basis that's the Fulfillment of Malachi 4 is behold I send you Elijah the prophet this is his ministry it wasn't just an evangelist he wasn't just a Healer he wasn't just a good man but he's actually called he's a fulfilling prophecy he's a prophet sent in the last days and so he was doing the work of an evangelist out there on the field emphasizing salvation lifting up these certain things and presenting to them Divine Healing is a minor to let them recognize that Christ loves them but that's not his ministry that wasn't all he was called to do is to heal the sick and preach the gospel he just as every Minister had is called and we are all called to go into all the world and preach the gospel we all come under that ordination we all come under that commission he had that commission plus the commission of a prophet a scriptural commission revealing the son of man in the church-aged messenger and a uh an angel voice these things are tied to his ministry so what I want you to catch now is he had an emphasis out in the Evangelistic field but what about as a prophet I spoke words the original seat he says when I built this Tabernacle the day I laid the Cornerstone out here I remember that Vision that morning got it wrote there in the Cornerstone said this is not your Tabernacle do the work of evangelists make full proof of your ministry he says I love it I love God's children everywhere I don't know where he's going to lead me I don't know I'm waiting this is 1962 through 60 um two in March exactly one year later he's going to preach the first seal exactly one year later he says I love God's children everywhere I don't know where he's going to lead me I don't know I'm waiting I've been waiting for a year may wait for two years I may wait for three I don't know I don't know the next move but I'm waiting for it could he even feel like a Paul I want to do this if God will permit there's got to be something to take a step further but I think according to scripture the word has been sowed the next thing is the coming forth of the spirit so he's looking at something to come to bring something to life I've been laying in these Evangelistic Services I've been preaching these things I mean even in a way at this time as a church age messenger he's calling people back to repentance calling them back to the message of the Pentecost and the restoration of the gifts demonstrating signs wonders and miracles and and sending millions or thousands to the Pentecostal church and he's out there he says but something needs to come forth recognize that to be a language that he uses quite often later on in the year and then at the time the seals are opened he says Billy Graham May preach everywhere Oral Roberts them Godly men may preach everywhere and those names become prominent in a certain vein of quotes I was Finding here recently and it just kept standing out as this theme he refers to Billy Graham Oral Roberts they may preach everywhere the Lord may send me to sow seed somewhere else some field he says they they may continue in these great big campaigns but I've got a specific calling and I may be called to do something very specific now in 1965 modern events made clear by prophecy this is at the very end of his ministry he says remember this message started first with Divine Healing performing miracles now if God let that go through an ordinary church just like we already had then it wasn't God don't have to show off you don't have to do these things to entertain us like we Americans are used to entertainment but he does it to attract the attention of the people that he's fixing to do something this is the anticipation he was under in the spoken words the original seed that something's going to happen I've been told to do the work in evangelist I've done it all these years for 15 years I've been doing it or for longer we could say almost 30 years I've been doing this work on evangelist I've been doing this but I know there's something more this isn't my full call and this isn't all I've been commissioned to do and he says here as he comes back to this the mess the message started out with Divine Healing and Performing miracles but that was only to attract the attention because he was fixing to do something stand in the Gap you remember on the tape sirs what time it is is it I'll quote it over and this is his quote remember something is fixing to take place major something is fixing to take place major I don't believe he says major it and serves is this the time but as he goes back and he says let me just quote it for you sirs what time is it this was the question or this is the statement something major is about to happen something major we've had Divine healings we've had signs wonders Miracles there has been the manifestation of the spirit give signs wonders healings and miracles through the entire church age it was always in the church it's always in the lives of the Believers but something major is about to happen he says now it's made the whole nation testify to it he's talking about the picture every newspaper in this on the Associated Press and one of our leading magazines in life he's referring to in everything else testifying about him not like this and it ain't all over yet because here we are right testifying about him it ain't all over yet there's a sermon title something major is about to happen is what he's saying and here we are he's leading to this now in the sermon the Rapture but kind of catch the theme Here the message started with Divine Healing performing Miracles but something Major's got to happen Divine Healing minor Miracles all these things are minor but something major has to happen in the Rapture when I went forth into the meetings with you praying for the sick it was fine but when I come with the message and there's there's a a sharp rebuke here in Yuma there he's he's being very honest and very open about the fact that they loved him when he was performing Miracles but when he began to preach that's when they begin to turn away from but when I come with the message it says if any message Goes Forth it's a true message if it's the true genuine miracles of god if it's the true genuine miracles of god and hangs right into that organization you know it's not of God because that thing is already declared something like that if something signs wonders and manifestations and miracles that's only God can do the Miracles but if that person is trying to lead you in an organization hold back to a former light trying to drag you back into a former life he says then that's not God God's not manifesting those things to get your attention God's not manifesting that as a way of a signpost that's just the rain from Hebrews 6 fallen on the just and the unjust that's the rain blessing all the seeds he says Jesus went forth and healed the sick in order to catch their eyes the people then his message this isn't the pattern of John 6. that's right it has to have something that God is going to introduce Divine so that there's the God wants to introduce something after the tongues there's an interpretation after the Divine Healing there's an introduction Divine Healing his miracles like that just catch the eyes of the people the main heart of it is the message that's where what comes from here he's trying to get the favor of the people so they'll sit and listen to him for there's some in there that's ordained alive some of the grain remember he said I may go out and and sow seeds somewhere else in the field he says some of the grain wheat fell on the ground Birds picked it up others fell among thorns and some was went on prepared ground pre-prepared ground improp forth what's the pattern signs wonders and miracles when I was praying for the sick do you all love me but then when I went into that message to catch the elect you all didn't like that but he says the main that's a minor but the main thing is the message catch this emphasis now when he's out there in the Evangelistic field the main thing was salvation and the the signs and wonders were to catch the people's attention to receive Christ and be saved this is according to the commission this is what we all would our lives would come under that commission and all Ministry operates in that but now we're looking at a prophetic office recognizing that in my minis I prayed for the sick I went out performing these things the message started with performing Miracles and Divine Healing Jesus went forth and healed the sick what to catch the people's attention because there was a message to follow we read this statement recently in the sermon leadership and so now we've quoted from uh uh the um December 4th December 6th now even December 7th leadership in that time period he's summing all these things up for the people when a Divine Healing went forth not long ago did you notice how the impersonation impersonators follow it followed it and every one of them went right into them organizations staying there so there's a impersonation Tommy Osborne I can do that there's certain things that people can uh people can activate Faith they can preach the gospel to activate people's faith for that healing for that instant for that moment brother bam talks about Divine Healing and I've had the quote to share with you I'm just not sure what context it may fit in but brother Ram's talk refers to Divine says and here the Beatles are doing it he says every one of them went into organization stand right there does anyone know that there had to be a message follow that why God don't entertain us he attracts our attention with something and when he attracts our attention then he's got his message there's a message that follows the Vindication there's a message that follows the signs and wonders and he's kind of given us these keys that if there's something if there's a move of God a manifestation of the spirit if you want to know if there's a message to follow listen for it and if it lines up with the word of God then you can say this is this is how God worked to catch that seed to go out in this field and begin to sow things in this field to get my attention but he's saying that God just doesn't do these miracles to entertain us he's got a message so he wants to get our attention and the sermon God doesn't call man unto judgment without first warning him and I want to hurry I don't want to be lengthy today but I still have a lot I want to get to this is a very important lengthy statement please Focus now and then God confirms that message that Billy Graham preaches I had to cut some of this out but remember what he said earlier when he's talking about well I I feel that I'm the something's gonna happen he says oh Robert we'll preach everywhere Billy Graham will preach everywhere but the Lord may call me to do something specific and listen to how he says this now and then God confirms that message that Billy Graham preaches God heals the Sick by Oral Robert's prayers God's doing it and God produces the things that Jesus proves that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and it's calling those things that it's messages of the hour I think of that we call the message of yeah the message of the hour but there's messages of the hour and each one of those messages is calling repent or perish that's right repent or perish there's no hopes it's all gone world's warned of his coming each one of the messages speaks and warns of the coming of Lord Jesus both to the church denominal those messages speak in warns of the coming of the Lord are you saying Oral Roberts Billy Graham follow him into his language I think that's very easy to follow but please Focus but he says remember God is always in threes he talked about Oral Roberts and Billy Graham and their message warning about the coming Lord like Father Son and Holy Ghost justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost so forth he's in threes now God is that message of repentance to the church nominal this is good listen that was me you're if you're streaming the podcast God's in that message of Divine Healing to the church Pentecostal God's in it God in the message to the bride God's in the message of repentance God's in the message Divine Healing but God's in the message to the bride so let's not belittle anything speak out against anything just recognize your message in your day walk fully in it God's in the message to the bride so we find out that all them calling one to this this to that that to that God calling the church out of the world calling the church in the denominal church into Pentecost and call on the bride out of Pentecost these there's a gathering together Binding Together the the the the the the election to these different parts but God is calling the bride out of Pentecost you have repentance you have Divine Healing while we walk through that even in our own calling but we want to come to the message for me as the elect of God the bride Luther Wesley and now it's just all perfectly typed up and there's no mistake about it catch this verbage he uses I've hit all around the ends of it and sides of it and inside and outside of it and showed it by the scripture the chronology of it till we know that it's absolutely the truth there's no mistake July 24 1963 saying this Sunday I hope Sunday I hope that God sinks it so deep not some day but Sunday I hope that God sinks it so deep that you'll never be able to get away from it I like that that's wonderful here he is preaching on Wednesday July 24th 1963 it's a Wednesday night and he's kind of getting him ready for Sunday and this profound statement that there's a message of repentance to a nominal Church there's a message of Divine Healing to the Pentecostals that's their emphasis they major on that minor that's their thrust that's what it's all about he says but then there's a message to the bride he says I've hit on the outside I've done everything I possibly can to show you that it's absolutely the truth but summon Sunday this coming Sunday in just a few days I hope that God sinks it so deep you'll never get away from it anybody know what he preached Sunday morning July 28 1963 Christ is the mystery of God revealed that profound sermon that is the opener that the silence is even being lifted now of that seventh seal and he's bringing it and how he labors in that and you're going to open up the thoughts of God's mind and bring into view Christ and his bride to bring them together and he's saying I've we've looked at Billy Robert uh Billy Graham and Oral Roberts for time's sake I'll just start calling him Bobby Bob and Rob or Billy and Rob or whatever bobert's whatever I was going to say they're out there preaching repentance and Divine Healing repentance and Divine Healing repent repairs warning people about the coming of the Lord but brother Ram says this is two years earlier maybe God is calling me to do something else I'm probably going to pull away from all that and I've got to come to something very very specific and what I want you to begin to recognize is now from a prophetic standpoint he is not majoring on salvation alone as an evangelist out in the field he used the minor to get people's attention to come to salvation but that's the general commission we're all under as Ministers of God and as Believers but as a prophet he had a different commission he had a commission to be out now out west he had a commission for these seals to be opened up he has a commission to reveal the son of man and so from a prophetic standpoint Christ is the major he's the major prophet he says Christ is the major the major is the word that's what he wanted to sink so deep that you'll never be able to get away from it and preaches Christ the mystery God revealed and bringing it all down beautiful sermon to emphasize Christ is the main thing let him have preeminence it's all about Christ that's what the new birth is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you that's what this whole thing is building up to Christ God revealed in those three different aspects the fullness of God in Christ to reveal himself to his son then have preeminence in his bride to take bride and bridegroom back to the beginning again that's the emphasis that's the goal that's what you major on you don't can't major on a minor it's not all about prayer lines it's not all about healings it's not even all about the altar but let's use all these things that bring Salvation that bring healing let it all accumulate together in our hearts so that Christ can be the major [Applause] is the word now in Hebrews chapter 6 verses 1 to 3 and then I'll read verse 9 but I'm just going to cherry pick therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on to perfection telio takes the perfect one Christ not Perfection necessary as a state but a perfect ore not just the author but the finisher not a foundation but a Capstone come on somebody and this will do of God permit the holding back but there will come a time when the delay is over time is no more the delay God is permitted and so then Paul when he goes through this manifestations brother man talks about these manifestations of spiritual gifts wonderful blessings wonderful manifestations through these rain fallen on the the just and the unjust and the Briars and thorns and everyone rejoicing and the power of God pouring on everyone then he says but beloved and these very ones who had the spirit of God move in their hearts and do many wonderful works and lay hands on the sick and they recover and cast out demons and then stand before Christ he says I never knew you you were ultimately you worked iniquity there was no election there was no destination there was no it hadn't it hadn't been effective in them like it should be in the elect because Paul says I'm persuaded beloved we're persuaded better things of you better more as Jesus was saying I want to show you and begin to tell them about something that was better I'm not just I'm persuaded better things of you than just the doctrines of baptism delaying on of hands and all the things that be the first principles of our foundation he says I'm persuaded better things of you that you wouldn't just have the spirit of God pray on your flesh and then you would just be condemned ultimate and judgment and things that accompany salvation though we thus speak there's a mouthful in that things that accompany salvation think of the Perfection the maturity the strengthening of the Inner Man Paul with all the manifestations that he had he was still striving to attain to apprehend it's a perfect faith things that accompany salvation remember the two parts to Redemption out of and in two there's got to be a climax there's got to be a finality there's got to be a summation of things and the sermon of paradox this is in Tampa this is a brother a minister Full Gospel businessman's breakfast he says the church has become just growing up he says just like I was going to speak tonight upon the unveiling of the one true God but I think it take a little too long this is what's in his heart though the unveiling of God and preach the Mighty God unveiled the unveiling God he preaches in Philadelphia that summer he preached it in Jeffersonville this was on his heart but he's thinking in this these meetings I think maybe it'll just be too long I noticed the people after about nine o'clock they get Restless I thought I would just wait till sometime at the Tabernacle I got something else on my mind maybe for tonight to bring a message of salvation that's what we're trying to do here you Minister Brothers he says now you Minister Brothers we missed Divine Healing I just was really pressing to catch what he meant by that but then when he goes to immediately this is where my this is where my heart is being pulled he says we missed Divine Healing not that we didn't have it you sought me not because you saw the Miracles but because you ate bread and were filled and he says we missed Divine Healing no we had it we saw it but did we get it as old Dr Bosworth who just went home to Glory down here recently he said he used to say Divine Healing is a bait that you put on the hook you never show the fish the hook you show him the bait he hits the bait and gets the hook so that's the way it is Divine Healing just draws the attention and then salvation is what we are after and I believe these are the words of the Prophet we are after the strength of the body of Christ but not as an evangelist when he says this in 1964 this April 18 1964. he's not saying it as an evangelist but he's saying it as a prophet he was after the strength of the body of Christ and he makes a statement just prior to this and just after this he says now Christ coming to his body Christ coming to his body this was what was in his mind when he's preaching the unveiling of the one true God God behind your skins when God gets in your flesh Christ is the mystery of God revealed and when Christ is revealed in you and he's saying Christ coming to his body this is not an evangelist this is not a teacher this is not an apostle or a pastor this is the prophet of the age as John introduced Christ and he's the only one that knew Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world he's saying Christ come into his body Christ come into his body what I am after is the strength of the body of Christ who is our strength the Lord is my life and my salvation the Lord is the strength of my life Who Shall I Fear he was already laying in that Rapture message where after the strength of the body the light and the life the strength so as a prophet he's pointing us to the major and then there's if I could just use this series of sermons as an example so you could kind of catch the context sometimes to what brother Brandon's saying on April 15th he preached Christ is identified the same in all generations the next day and when their eyes were opened they knew him the next day then Jesus came and called that morning he's preaching the Paradox he says I want to preach tonight the unveilment of the one true God but I think it's going to be too long but what I'm after is the strength of the body of Christ so that evening preached Jesus keeps all his appointments and the next night the trial now that's quite a set list that's that think about what he's trying to get at Christ the same in all generations when they opened their eyes they knew him then Jesus came and called Jesus keeps all his appointments and then the trial is if to say put me on trial what is my Ministry to do what was my commission on the Ohio River all right another Bannerman writes in the church age book he says I recognize that Dr Luther did not believe only and preach only justification but that was his major theme as indeed it had to be for that is the basic doctrine of the truth of the word Luther had a major theme obviously these are my words Wesley had a major theme the restoration the gifts and the baptism of the Holy Ghost there's another major theme to laodicea but what was brother branham's major theme if Luther had one did Brother Brenham have a major theme when he was wrestling with this when he was looking at do the work of an evangelist and identifying that time in his ministry whether it be around the time of spoken words of the Original Seed he preaches um my new ministry and he's wrestling with these visions and things and he preaches present stage of my Ministry he's talking about a transition something's going to change we're coming am I building a platform what's going to happen something great is going to happen even comes down to the very end of 62 and he knows he knows he's just on the door step of something great but this is what he says in present stage of my Ministry I hope that he'll Crown my Ministry of this of letting me take the clothes of the word and dress his bride and the clothe of the word for his righteousness his ministry was different than that of an evangelist he it was on a higher order he preached the commission we see the commission being manifested signs and wonder wonders being performed Miracles laying hands on the stick casting out Devils raising the dead we see those things along the lines of the regular commission but there was a special sign in demonstration as minister to get our attention because there's a message to follow there's a voice that follows and he says I'm after the strength of the body of Christ I'm at that I'm at a critical Junction in Isaiah 37 verse 3 says they said unto him this is an uh Israel's at a Breaking Point they're being besieged and Hezekiah wants to go uh see he wants to send a message to Isaiah and this is what they say to Isaiah the words of Hezekiah this day is a day of trouble and of rebuke and blasphemy words that fit perfectly with the end times for in a time of trouble he shall hide me and in in the last days there's gonna be scoffers and mockers rebukes and blasphemies and he says for the children or come to the birth and there's not strength to bring forth the exact words are used in second Kings chapter 19. but when Hezekiah wants to describe what a day of trouble in a time of trouble on this day of rebuke can blasphemy he describes them as a woman in labor and she's come to the point to where she has to deliver but she's got no strength anymore no power for deliverance she's she's come through this full term to where now the body in its natural way is going into labor pains but it's such a terrible labor maybe it's such a travail that now at the time when the baby should come forth she's she's lost all her strength and there's no power for deliverance now this is this is Hezekiah describing them in their natural state in the time of The Siege and the war for they're engaged and he said there's just no hope now if you look in the natural when a woman comes to that place in those days it was death because if you don't have that strength to push that final that the final part to deliver the baby then that's whether you're just all spent and there's where nowadays science just can intervene and do certain things but there's a natural and I've watched it in our own labors with oh my those were so tough with our four children of what it takes the toll it takes on the body and you've got to come to that place I remember one time with I think it was with Elliot we had tremendous doctor in Scottsdale it's just a one of the best doctors I'd ever ever know best doctor I've ever had in delivery and it came to the point to where that I think you labor over 36 hours and uh with no no medicines not nothing you know nothing going no interventions at all this is all natural and the no sleep in weary and come to the very end and now Elliot's just at it's at the point of Deliverance and she's so tired there's no strength and I remember the duck says she said Elizabeth you got to give it that tiger mama you got to find that strength you've got to push you got to get past this you got to bring it bring it forth and hezekiah's describe it says there's no strength it's not there we can't be delivered it's death and when it says the children who come to the birth this has a prophetic description now the time that we're living in it literally means to come to a place of a breach come to a place of opening but there's no strength and no power and think about the church world and the history of the church up to 1963 with everything God had done and whatever dead dead as a door now though they might have been standing on their feet look it might have been things that come together and that had can these Dry Bones live and there's no strength to come to a place of a breach and there's no strength so what happens in March of 1963 on March 17th in the evening 1963 what is brother Brennan preach the breach why because we've come to the place of the opening and he preaches the breach before the open of the Seven Seals were there at this moment something has to come forth where are we going to get it quick any power has to come there's no strength but here stands a sentiment who can prophesy to the dry bones and strength comes to us at the opening of the word when you have need of it it's revealed something greater something who he is he says at the open of the Seven Seals the full word is to be born into manifestation again and Vindicated by the spirit of God in the full strength that's your major and the sermon go awake Jesus brother Brown says now we have we've given tonight for healing service now I guess many of you wonder usually in coming across the country I announce I'm going to have a meeting the first thought is Divine Healing but there's more to the ministry than Divine Healing more to the ministry than Divine Healing think to let these things just kind of add up now it's a little there's more to this ministry more to brother Brandon's Ministry more to the third pool more to the only seals more to this bright age than Divine Healing the sickest body I know of tonight is the so-called body of Jesus Christ I could say Amen in 1963. but he was what was he doing he was bringing us a word to change that prognosis he says the sickest body I know it needs spiritual healing there's only one bomb that I know that will heal that's the word and that's the sick body that we want to stand up in the strength and the Vitamin Power of the gospel and that's why I use much of the time now in trying to strengthen the church by the word that was his ministry he could continue in evangelism he could have prayer lines he could have campaigns he got manifestations but he had been given a sign to demonstrate to the people that the time was at hand and God was permitting something greater to come the sign was given the attention had been caught now what it's the message it's the word that he wants to lay in to give strength for our deliverance that's who I want to I want the bride to stand up what I'm after is the strength of the body of Christ in time evangelism is the shaping of our character by the word I want to stand up that's why I use my time now I may not spend a lot of time in healings and all these other things I want to spend my time in the word to strengthen the church by the word because there's more to this ministry than Divine Healing he says it says tonight we're giving it to a healing service I guess usually when everybody hears my name and here's it's announced they they just think the first thing they think of oh the message they think oh brother Brown I'm Divine Healing says no no there's more to this than that if he's the prophet of Malachi 4 5 Malachi 4 2 says but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arrives it is the rising of the sun with healing in his wings and ye shall go forth and grow up as calves of the star that means you're feeding clean profit or clean word of God that's why I'm trying to lay stand up when the strength and vitamin power of the Gospel strengthen the church by the word why because the son of righteousness Rises with healing in his wings and you're gonna cut burst forth to life you're gonna grow up to maturity by feeding on the word of God brother Brown says and when the son of righteousness Rises with healing in his wings there'll be a church to go up to meet him in the air I want to get touch on it here in the next couple services on the countdown principles I think we're getting a really good foundation on that with brother Chris and think about it the airplane what that represents but then the astronaut what's manifested what's demonstrated in the airplane and what is it same power power but more of it more of it so if you if you if you looked at the airplane and what's manifest in the airplane age and if I could put in these terms if you denied that science and that technology and said oh there's nothing to it it's hogwash you can never be an astronaut because it's the same science the same technology it's the same it's the same progression of thought and the same mechanics and Dynamics in the sense of we just have no more of it now greater propulsion aerodynamics and they're building it all together so remember that in your mind as we think about this he says the son of righteousness will arise with healing his wings to bring the church to a meeting in the air in the message Shalom this is the way he puts it his spoken word will be Vindicated when the son of righteousness shall rise with healing in his wings Shalom is um one of the sermons that I've been studying where he's talking about a symphony Symphony great conductor and he's shown us the tunes and The rhythms and the Beats he says and the healing part there will not be a physical healing as you think as some saying somebody's got a sickness and it'll be taken away from him that's what he's doing now in type but the whole creature will be changed this Mortal will take on immortality this old age will jump into youth amen this whole age will jump into youth that's what's embodied in the son of righteousness will arise with healing in his wings is that not what healing represents is the change of our body it's not what the these things are all guarantee of Eternity not a healing where this body gets sick it needs healing gets healed gets sick again healed sick again healed sick again over and over and over again but that points to the fact that there's a new body there's a party waiting for me without spot without blemish that'll never die and never age I says that whole creature it's not the healing physical hymn that you think the son of Rights is rising with healing his wings he's not doing a healing of the body like you think but that is a type of the healing he's doing no it's just how much this develops and the God of this evil age he says pray he says dear Jesus don't let one of them be lost as your servant that stands between the living and the Dead pointing them with the finger to the word of God I cannot save them Lord but they want to be saved and father as I've said many times the sun rises in the morning and it comes up across the Earth it's sent by God to ripen the grain to make natural food for natural living but oh God you said to them that fear his name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings now remember it's not physical healing like you think that's just a type of what he's wanting to do and now he's put in present tense let the son of righteousness the word of God rise in the hearts of the people and the healing rays of faith and that word cure every disobedient to the word and bring them to the fullness of the Sons and Daughters of God it's the message that's the message that's the thrust that's the main thing that's the major let the son of righteousness arise it is the rise of sun and let it rise in our hearts Let The Healing raise the faith in that word cure anything that doesn't harmonize with the word anything that's not in line with the word it let it bring me to the fullness of the stature of the Son of God let me go from Faith to perfect faith let it let this word be fully poured in me let it be burst forth to life oh Hallelujah now I just if I could try to figure out a way just to say this in my closing remarks and don't assume any particular time limit on that but if uh in in going through this just this morning with the right emphasis in the right order in the right understanding that we recognize our day and its message we recognize that Malachi 4 5 we recognize the son of righteousness the rise in our hearts and the Rays of Faith breaking away every doubt breaking away unbelief if we recognize we have power to bind it the greatest to the least if we recognize where we are in the time of God if we recognize the word of God why wouldn't healing be in this how could it not be in this if this is where we are today if this is the time that we're living how can healing not be a part of this word the major and a minor if I could summarize that it's having the right emphasis so that the word is effective because the message is in all Divine Healing there's more to this ministry he says than Divine Healing but if you get in the wrong the wrong vein and the wrong slant then that's all you all you return back to that's all that becomes it becomes about that and there's got to be a way to kind of build keep building that up and build that up building up this expectation where oh my just any moment any moment it's it's going to happen any moment it's gonna be this great climactic moment where spontaneously everyone is healed and we just you look at it in that vein and it's not that anything in that pattern isn't in the word it's just the emphasis isn't right and so Prophet has to come and after they've had the Revival Elijah comes to the Altar and the evening time what does he do he repairs the altar and all the stones and all the elements of the altar he has to build it back up again build it in the right way that they've all their fanaticism tore it down and at the evening time he takes the wood and he rightly divides the word of God divides the Bullock upon the Altar and then the fire falls because it had to be in a particular order for the word to be effective so let's catch we say the major and the minor you can't major on a minor so when you catch the prophetic emphasis not in just healing versus salvation but this order the Prophet The Prophet's order where Christ is the major the word so mentioned a moment ago and you can just keep that up there for a moment Brother John mentioned a moment ago her brother bear says I hope I can say this on Sunday and say it to the point to where it just sinks in and you'll never be able to get away with from it and he's talking about the message coming the message coming forth then he preaches Christ is the mystery of God revealed and we realize what a significant sermon that is at the very end the sermon's ending and he's laid in all these tremendous tremendous standpoints at the very end he's singing Take the name of Jesus with you and he's singing it in the key of G and he's he's take the name of Jesus with you and then as he sings it through he says he he's saying the first pull is uh first pull is manifested the second pull has ended and then he starts singing and when he does he changes the key and he says did you notice the spirit take the same song and picking it up an octave higher like that the next pull is at hand and so brother Branham changed he's singing in the key of G and he changes it and he changes it to the key of C now if we were wanting to be technical he was in G major and then when he changes now he wants to change from G he changes to C major and when I first began to look at this the major on a minor subject last month it's been over a period of a couple months now I've really just been exploring it in the message of the hour because I wanted to understand I didn't just want to make the mistake of saying well the miners Divine healer and I wanted to know what does it even mean how can I understand this better for myself that a Divine Healing is a minor I don't want it to make it so minor and so minuscule that I leave the scale I don't want to I don't want to take the major in major on something else I don't want to think there's a bunch of Majors there's a bunch of minors how does this all work and so as I was upon it what's the difference between the major and the minor and something was quickened to me the major key and a minor key that and and I thought well there's there must be something to this that there's a major key and there's a minor and I'm not very good at music and so there's certain things I did know as far as keys and things but I so I asked brother Micah I certainly appreciate the gift that God's placed in our body through Micah and I asked brother Mike I said so can you explain to me the major scale major to the minor and how does it how does the minor work within the scale and as wanting just to understand a little bit of the music theory to it and and so he the language he used is that every major key has a relative minor or a related minor right and so I I he gave me a tremendous lesson I took notes and I it clicked and the inspiration just locked so you could have a major and then it's going to there's going to be a minor that's in a relative relationship right so they're related but they're different and in the sermon are greater than Psalm is here brother man said so about 86 percent of Jesus ministry was on Divine Healing it attracts the attention of something supernatural being done and the people then believe in in the Mighty God that does it So Divine Healing is a minor and you can never major on a minor that's right Mrs biscoll isn't that isn't it that's right you can never major on a minor sister biscoll she's the validator all of a sudden Divine heal is a minor if I could say it this way I want to dramatize it this way brother Micah if you want to go ahead and come just so you can be here as a very good looking prop so he's preaching it attracts the attention something supernatural being done he doesn't need to be on camera he's good work just sitting right there being beautiful So Divine Healing is a minor you can never major on a minor any turns that's right Mrs biscoll isn't it that's right you can never major on a minor and I'd emailed brother Biscoe recently and and just sharing just saying hello to him and expressing some things in a very brief email and I said I was just reading uh in uh the greater than psalmist here's preached in Port Alberni when brother Adam turns to sister visco and says isn't that isn't that right Mrs biscoll and I thought there has to be a story to this and so when he wrote back sister biscal wrote also and she says I was playing the piano for the meetings and remember well brother Branham turning to me and making the comment about not being able to Major on a minor because she's at the piano that has major scales and minor scales that has a certain way things have to work in a certain order that's why I can go up there and start banging on keys and you know you ever see people get on there like this sounds good doesn't it's like no it doesn't sound good at all You're Breaking All the Rules and not in a way that that creates the kind of tension that music you create this is not a good this is not a good sound and there she is on the piano and when she wrote that back it was after I had the conversation with brother Micah and then she emails this back I'm like yes this is one way that we can see this and recognize this the major and the minor because you can't major on a minor think of it you can't major on a minor when brother bear says you can't major on a minor now from a profit standpoint why because the key has changed and when brother I'm singing Take the name of Jesus with you it's it's in the key of G but when he changes what key do you think he went to C major says Christ that's the major and the minor to see to C major is a minor so once you put it in its place the miner Finds Its place just think of this picture the relative minor to C major is a minor you have C major and a minor they all have the same seven notes what you want to run through those real quick the same seven notes same seven notes in C major it's called a key signature the only difference between the c major scale and the a minor scale is the order now to me a minor seems pretty major because they get the order right right A B C D E F G right that sounds very logical that makes sense but it's the minor the major C major is in a different order and so the c major scope that's what we call the key of C and I'm doing this for all of our song leaders here to know what keys are and if you want the key of A minor these are the the notes that would be in a my a minor and there's different words that are used as I was studying this the tonality the tonic but it's the key so when you're in the key of C there's a certain arrangement of notes and chords and when you have the tonal Center you have the tonic the key of C it's the center or Central note and so it becomes the name of the key so what I'm like when brotherbraham changed it to C it was Christ becomes the major that that's the scale now Christ is the center Christ is the focal point but if you're in a minor scale Divine Healing is a minor now Divine Healing becomes the focal point that becomes the focus and so once you once you're in this key the major key or the tonic or the tonal centers the target toward which all the other I'm having to read this right I didn't go to Juilliard I didn't you know the the course I took on YouTube didn't implanted my brain it's a Target towards toward which all other notes lead so all the notes are leading to C when you're in the c major scale all all notes all gifts all of it leads to Christ we're near the right key but it but so that becomes the key it becomes the name of the scale it's the very it's a very focal point the center it's the first note it's the center note and it's the last note the same yesterday today and forever it's the first and the beginning it's the middle it's the last that kids see and then it's the it's the central note but then it's the final resolution he's the author and the finisher he's at the front of the book The Middle of the book is at the end of the book and then the tone when you're that scene and it becomes the tone that note that complete comes with a complete relaxation and the stability of the sound even to where in in music really good music um builds tension that's what gets our minds oh we like this we like that's why some of us really like the bridge right it's a certain way it's a rock trick it kind of gets in your minds and then whenever and whenever the octave changes I like those artists that can sing that low range and then when they really want to ramp it up right and it just brings you out of your seat you're like yes that's it it's because the mind has a way that it works and certain expectations this is the natural part it's waiting to hear something something that fits in that Rhythm it's building anticipation it's building expectation but it's got to come back to the sea in that major scale C and it's what relieves the tension and brings a sense of completion when it comes back to that it's resolved everything's completed am I getting it right okay and then when they when they're looking at this in these major scales all other notes are defined in terms of their relation to the main key when you find the right key all other notes are defined by the relationship to that key to that centered that Focus so an A Minor what's the center what's the focus a that's the focus Divine Healing when you make a minor the major when you make a minor the key when you make that the focal point then divide the center and the focus is a but in C major the center and the focus is C it's all chords and all melodies return and rest on C wherever they go whatever they do they're all leading back to bring you big carry you as music does back to the sense of completion in these seven notes coming back together and resting on C my brother Brown says you can't major on a minor it's because it's always going to lead you back to a minor if you made your if you're if you're trying to make something minor major you got the keys wrong that's why maybe one of the big debates I came across this and looking at this is how do you know when you're in the minor how do you know when you're in the major scale how you know when your miners go because it's all the same notes and so it leads when you're in the right when you're in the right key it leads back to the major Christ and we've got to be in the right key we believe in Divine Healing we believe in the fruits of the spirit we believe in the five gifts within the the church we must be in the right key healing is in the c major scale right preaching is in the c major scale science wonders Miracles gifts they get fruits of the spirit they're all in the c major scale all the Miracles signed wonders are all in the c major scale but we needed the message to reveal to us the mystery of Christ go listen or read the sermon Shalom but I was talking about a symphony and a sympathy and he's talking about a symphony and he's talking about we got to get on the same kind of sheet music you got to be in harmony with the director has to be in harmony with the composer and you have to catch the Rhythm and the beat and whenever it changes and it builds he said you all have to be you have to be in the right line the right Harmony and we can say this and this time in this hour something major has happened we went from a minor we've left we've now moved and now he's changed keys we're in the major we're not we're not in something minor we're now in the major Christ and we must be in harmony with the word to recognize the right keys to knowing something that's the right note but it's not you've just you've changed things a little bit I was going to invite the rest of the musicians to come but you're it whatever's on your heart you can play by the Micah something major has happened when brother bam was singing Take the name of Jesus with you and change his keys he said the next pull is at hand the third pull to bring us into Rapture and faith and I don't think it's a coincidence that he put it in that scale where see Christ is the center because that's what he said in the ABCs always believed the sea is Christ and only the prophet we look at and says well isn't it a b c d e f g isn't isn't that the wouldn't that be the orderly sevens isn't that where they place the seventh but he knew just how to place it so that no matter what in that scale it all began with c and all ends with C and all the other notes work together coming right back to the completion of the resolution of C the major is Christ a minor is the compliment is it related the key of A if that Divine Healing it's part of it but it's not all of it and in the sermon I wanted to read this just as a prayer I want us to be very prayerful now as we close you remember how he wanted to preach the unveilment of the one true God he says I really want to preach on this but I think it'll take too long he preaches it June 14th in the morning 1964 he comes to it a couple months later and he's praying he says bless Thy word to our heart we know that there's no man in heaven or an earth is worthy to take this book to loose the seals or to look upon it even but there was one appeared the slain land a slain lamb bloody that came and took the book and was Worthy and able to open it that's our third pull that's when that key changed and it was you know when those other Keys is Sharps and flats but in the key of C major there's no sharps or flats and he's in the key of G and there's an F sharp but then when he goes to C major no Flats no sharps they're not all it's all it's all being crystallized the simple Christ has been revealed that's that's what this open of the word is he says o Lamb of God open Thy word to our hearts today he says for comfort we are your servants forgive our sins Lord and this is the part I want you to did I not provide this brother John in there okay must have done it for a reason but hear this he says in anything that would keep the word from going forth with great power and influence to down our lives take it away Lord anything that would keep the word from going forth with great power and influence in our lives take it away anything that would keep the word from influence to life takeaway says any hindrance that we might have full access to all the blessings promised to us through Thy Word any blessing the blessing of praise the blessing of Joy the fruits of the spirit Divine Healing you name it if there's any hindrance take it away he says anything that would keep us from Catching from the word going forth with great power and influence on our lives any hindrance that might keep us from full access to the blessings and promise that are promised to us Thy word take it away anything that's hinders anything that's keeping us from getting to perfect take it away anything that's keeping me from only believe take it away anything that's kept me from walking fully in the promise of my time in my hour oh God take it away and what struck me is I read this yesterday I began to think oh God whatever it takes whatever it takes for us to come to that place of a deep settled peace a stability in Christ and and a trajectory that's headed to that meat in the air whatever it takes Lord Do It if what we need if what we need is healing Lord bring the healing if what we need is the manifestation of the spirit Lord bring the manifestation but God let this word have its full influence on me I don't want to get caught in a pattern that's all I'm chasing is the sign all I'm chases the manifestation but the word is not going forth with great power and influence on my life so Lord take the key put me in the right key Lord put me in tune let me recognize that tonal Center Christ and let every note of my life lead to that let everything in your word we believe it we don't look down on any of it but Lord put it in the right key if I'm just in the key of altar calls I'll keep returning back to the altar call if I'm just in the key of prayer lines I just keep returning back to the prayer line but if I'm in the sea of Christ if I'm in the key of Christ if I'm in that major scale all the same notes are in it but now now it all returns back does it help you understand the major and the minor a little bit better let's stand
