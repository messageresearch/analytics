[0:00] I was thinking back brother Aaron had
[0:03] asked me to minister this morning on
[0:05] Father's Day and I
[0:07] thought didn't I Minister on Mother's
[0:10] Day and I thought no I didn't Minister
[0:12] on Mother's Day I I'd come up and I
[0:14] think I prayed I I think I opened the
[0:16] service in prayer on Mother's Day I just
[0:18] remember looking out and saying happy
[0:21] Mother's Day to the mothers on Mother's
[0:23] Day but I didn't I didn't Minister on
[0:25] Mother's Day in fact there was a target
[0:28] audience on Mother's Day
[0:31] if you all remember that target audience
[0:33] on Mother's day was the
[0:38] father's and I think that the
[0:41] Fathers as they got their scathing
[0:43] rebuke on on Mother's Day and and so
[0:47] many had written in complaints to the
[0:50] complaint
[0:51] department here at the church and they
[0:53] said we just can't
[0:55] wait for Mother's Day or for Father's
[0:58] Day we can't wait for Father's
[1:01] Day and I think brother Aaron thought
[1:04] and everybody was asking what's brother
[1:06] Aaron going to preach on Father's
[1:09] Day and brother Aaron had something real
[1:13] special in
[1:14] planned he said I'm not going to do it
[1:18] I'm going have brother rege do
[1:22] it and so as I went through each of your
[1:25] homes and I was looking on your
[1:27] calendars in your kitchens and I saw
[1:29] where all the money mothers had marked
[1:30] Father's Day and each one was holding
[1:33] their breath for this
[1:41] day this is Father's
[1:46] day
[1:48] and I didn't plan anything to for a
[1:51] scathing rebuke to all the
[1:53] mothers um instead this morning I'm
[1:56] going to be preaching on Full House
[2:00] cooking with
[2:01] Paul Corinthian home
[2:05] show it's a it's a mouthful it's a long
[2:07] title I I tried to condense it but this
[2:10] is the this is the most I had so many
[2:12] other so many other things to add to the
[2:14] title but I thought let's just stop
[2:16] there full house cooking with Paul
[2:20] Corinthian home
[2:22] show
[2:24] so I want to read you something for your
[2:27] homework for each of you that like to
[2:30] study the Bible and study the message of
[2:32] the hour for each of you your homework
[2:34] today or not today but whenever you'd
[2:37] like to to tackle this uh is the message
[2:42] Corinthians book of Correction so that's
[2:44] where I drew the inspiration for this
[2:47] sermon um was listening I'd listen to
[2:49] that to that tape Corinthians book of
[2:52] Correction
[2:54] and um been studying in Corinthians the
[2:57] book of Corinthians and just going
[2:58] through and and and um just examining my
[3:02] life just listening to Paul reading Paul
[3:05] listening to Paul well reading Paul and
[3:07] imagining I'm listening to them and so
[3:12] if you go home and you have time during
[3:14] the week those of you that go to work
[3:16] and you put your airpods in and you
[3:18] listen to these sermons uh Corinthians
[3:20] book of Corrections is a f fabulous
[3:22] sermon I would really highly recommend
[3:24] it I think it's very beautiful I think
[3:26] when it's all said and done and you
[3:28] listen to it and you take it in all of
[3:30] its light you'll be very blessed in it
[3:34] but in that sermon brother brandham
[3:36] starts off pretty early on and he says
[3:37] it's the only church talking about
[3:39] Corinthians the Corinthian Church it's
[3:42] the only church in all of the New
[3:44] Testament that seemingly that the
[3:46] leaders had such trouble
[3:49] with but Corinthians was always in
[3:52] trouble Paul when he come among them one
[3:54] had a tongue and one had a Psalm one had
[3:57] the feeling and a sensation and he was
[3:59] always having trouble with these
[4:01] Corinthians keeping them
[4:04] straight and I remember hearing this and
[4:07] I I I've heard this sermon many times
[4:09] and I remember hearing that and and and
[4:11] that sticking with me that brother
[4:13] brandom had said that the Corinthians
[4:15] they always were in trouble they they
[4:18] and and you can read it you can you can
[4:20] catch it when you're reading in in in
[4:22] the book of Corinthians you can catch it
[4:24] when you're reading
[4:28] it and
[4:30] I
[4:31] thought you know yeah and brother
[4:34] Brandon would would say you know we're
[4:35] we're living in a in a day of an another
[4:38] book of
[4:39] Ephesians and that Ephesians is the
[4:42] Joshua of the New Testament that
[4:44] Joshua's was just like Ephesians in the
[4:47] Old Testament Ephesians is that Josh
[4:50] Book of Joshua for the New Testament
[4:52] Church it's it's coming into the
[4:54] promised land and it's it's going
[4:56] through the promised land and looking at
[4:58] all of the uh of of the blessings that
[5:01] God has given the church so brother
[5:03] Brandon himself in this sermon right
[5:06] after that statement there he says you
[5:08] know they couldn't go deep the book of
[5:10] uh the Church of Corinthians they
[5:12] couldn't go into deep things like like
[5:14] the Ephesians or the Romans like the
[5:18] Ephesian or the Roman Church and so in
[5:20] my mind when you hear a statement like
[5:22] that you're always thinking well I want
[5:25] to
[5:27] be likened to the Ephesian Church church
[5:30] or I want to be likened unto the Roman
[5:32] Church I want to be known as being able
[5:35] to go into the deep
[5:37] things and and if somebody was to stop
[5:39] by our church and say y'all are just
[5:42] like the Church of
[5:47] Corinthians you you you may you maybe
[5:50] wouldn't invite him
[5:53] back and and if that picture comes
[5:55] across today y'all don't have to invite
[5:58] me back but I'm coming
[6:09] back now my title Full House cooking
[6:13] with Paul Corinthian home show
[6:17] uh for
[6:19] years when we were
[6:23] Landscaping uh and even doing the
[6:26] artificial
[6:27] grass how many here has ever been to
[6:30] um a home and garden show does everybody
[6:32] know what a home and garden show
[6:35] is so these home shows we we just call
[6:38] them home shows um but they're home and
[6:40] garden shows and we would always
[6:43] purchase a booth or multiple booths and
[6:45] they they you they sell you a space
[6:48] within a an arena and you as a company
[6:51] will set up a place within this Arena
[6:55] and there's many businesses represented
[6:57] in a home and garden show and theide
[6:59] idea is to improve their home or improve
[7:02] their Garden or improve their
[7:04] Landscaping of some sort the idea is
[7:07] that they can come to this show and
[7:09] there may be a a a company there that
[7:12] could help them they're they're looking
[7:14] for somebody to help them with something
[7:16] in their home um or or or their property
[7:20] or perhaps they can get some ideas they
[7:23] can draw some ideas from this home and
[7:25] garden show some draw some sort of
[7:27] inspiration for their
[7:30] homes and then uh many people are just
[7:33] looking for something to do on a weekend
[7:36] and so they'll go to a home and garden
[7:37] show cuz they're just wanting to kill
[7:39] time and so oh there's a home and garden
[7:42] show and so they'll stop into the Home
[7:44] and Garden Show and they'll Walk Through
[7:46] This Home and Garden Show and usually
[7:47] you come into this Arena and there's
[7:49] just a buzz there's there's people
[7:51] there's just this noise of people and
[7:53] and the the gates open and everybody
[7:55] begins to walk through the Home and
[7:57] Garden Show and there's booths on either
[7:59] either side as you're walking down and
[8:01] you you alternate aisles and you're
[8:03] walking down looking at each one and all
[8:06] the parents are looking for something
[8:08] for their home or for but they got to
[8:11] bring the children they got to bring the
[8:12] kids the kids got to come too um because
[8:15] it's just hey this is what we're going
[8:16] to do on this Saturday we're going to
[8:18] kill a
[8:19] Saturday and you're coming well the kids
[8:22] love it because they're looking for the
[8:24] booths that have the free candy they're
[8:27] looking for the booths that have got the
[8:29] miniature footballs or the miniature
[8:30] basketballs they're looking for the
[8:31] booth that's got the stress squeezers um
[8:35] that they can just fill the bag with
[8:37] just stuff they so they're just running
[8:38] to the booths and and and all the
[8:40] business professionals that are have
[8:42] paid money to set their Booth up they're
[8:45] trying to chase the children off as
[8:46] quick as they can so they don't eat all
[8:48] their candy before the weekend is up so
[8:50] they can offer it to the homeowners so
[8:52] that they'll hire
[8:53] them for years we signed up for Home and
[8:57] Garden shows as landscapers
[9:01] and the day or two days before the Home
[9:04] and Garden Show would start we would
[9:06] come in and then we would get a a slot
[9:08] that we could come and set our booth up
[9:10] now in our booth we would take
[9:13] meticulous time I mean uh the days
[9:17] hours just drawing off of payroll to set
[9:21] up a home show that you don't even know
[9:23] if you're going to make money on but
[9:25] it's worth the
[9:26] investment and so we would take
[9:29] landscape block that and and and we
[9:32] would take a and and drill a boulder and
[9:35] and and and create a water feature
[9:37] within our booth and we would design H A
[9:40] flower bed and we would fill it with
[9:42] flowers and Mulch and and we would put
[9:44] some artificial grass on the floor or a
[9:46] putting green so that all the men could
[9:48] could stop by our booth and they would
[9:50] putt on our green and hopefully they
[9:52] would order some artificial grass from
[9:54] us and and we would take all this time
[9:57] and we would we would look at our booth
[9:59] at the it's just beautiful this is just
[10:00] beautiful this this looks like something
[10:03] everybody would want in their yard and
[10:06] and and we're going to we're going to
[10:07] try to pull everybody into our booth and
[10:10] we want everybody signing up for a free
[10:12] estimate from us so that we can go and
[10:14] get work from them and for years we
[10:16] would do
[10:21] this and all these home shows that we
[10:24] would go
[10:26] to there'd be this one booth and it
[10:29] would just be lined with chairs like as
[10:32] like almost as many chairs are within
[10:35] this church just full of chairs and
[10:39] there'd be a a big portable uh like a a
[10:43] countertop on this and that there would
[10:45] be these loud speakers on the corners of
[10:48] that and I thought what is going on in
[10:50] that booth and and and and and while I'd
[10:54] be uh you know explaining to customers
[10:57] how it is that we do what we do and what
[10:59] we could do for them and for their yard
[11:02] and I'm thinking you know yes come to
[11:04] our booth for the Landscaping portion of
[11:06] this we want you in our booth we want to
[11:08] get you in our booth I can hear over the
[11:10] loudspeakers I can hear and I'm thinking
[11:13] why didn't I get a
[11:16] loudspeaker but I can hear the
[11:18] loudspeaker and I would look at all
[11:19] these empty chairs and then there'd be a
[11:21] signup sheet and then there wouldd be a
[11:23] a a booth that would say our first
[11:25] showing is at this time and then a
[11:27] couple hours later we're going to have
[11:28] another showing and then a couple hours
[11:30] later another showing and what was in
[11:32] that Booth but there was a man in a
[11:35] chef's hat and an apron and he would
[11:39] have himself this booth and he would and
[11:41] and the chairs would begin to fill up
[11:44] with people and and you had to you had
[11:46] to sign up early just so you could get a
[11:48] seat in this booth otherwise you're
[11:50] standing off to the side and watching or
[11:53] or move along you know you're going to
[11:55] get rushed along with the crowd and so
[11:57] you're wanting to seat at this Bo I'm
[11:59] think man why is it that people aren't
[12:00] lining up to come get a seat in my
[12:03] booth and I would see these people and
[12:06] they would fill this place up these
[12:07] chairs would just be full of
[12:11] people and there'd be a man in there and
[12:14] he' and he'd have this open bar and he
[12:16] would begin pulling out pots and pans
[12:18] and he and and he and he's talking in a
[12:20] microphone
[12:22] like ladies and gentlemen this is what
[12:26] it what sound like it's just muffled and
[12:29] I'm thinking it's a he has a terrible
[12:32] sound system and yet he's drawing a
[12:35] crowd and he begin and you'd
[12:38] say now for all of you that stick around
[12:41] today for all of you for all of you that
[12:44] don't fall asleep within this sermon
[12:46] essentially I mean essentially it's a a
[12:49] home show sermon for all of you that
[12:51] will stick around for the entire sermon
[12:53] at the end of this each of you is going
[12:55] to get yourself a free pairing knife
[12:58] that that's right a free pairing knife
[13:01] this knife is so sharp I'm going to show
[13:02] you it can cut Tomatoes like you've
[13:05] never seen tomatoes cut and this knife
[13:07] here it can just peel potatoes like
[13:09] you've never seen potatoes peeled and I
[13:12] don't know if you are each seeing this
[13:13] but if you'll stick around each of you
[13:15] we'll leave this place with a free
[13:17] pairing knife today if you'll just go
[13:20] ahead and stick around for the entire
[13:23] show I'm thinking pairing knives is what
[13:26] we're doing
[13:28] now and he'd say
[13:30] now you know I'm going to show you
[13:33] something and and and and while I'm
[13:35] pairing up this what we're going to do
[13:36] is you see this pan here this pan is a
[13:39] non-stick pan you've never seen a pan
[13:41] like this before in your life this pan
[13:43] here I'm going to get some butter in
[13:44] that pan I'm going to get that going and
[13:46] that pan there is going to be is going
[13:48] to be a lifechanger for all of you that
[13:50] like to cook this pan here is going to
[13:52] change your life nothing sticks to it
[13:54] cleaning is going to be so much easier
[13:55] but while I've got this pan going and
[13:57] it's simmering here and if y can smell
[13:59] that butter cooking and the potatoes
[14:01] that I've just shelv in that I'm going
[14:02] to get this pot this is a pot here this
[14:05] is not a pan this is a pot and in a pot
[14:07] we do something else and we're going to
[14:09] cook something else and I don't know I'm
[14:10] not a cook so you know if y'all are
[14:13] waiting for me to break something out
[14:15] I'm not going
[14:16] to but he's got these pots and these
[14:18] pans and and and really truly that's
[14:21] what he's
[14:22] selling he's selling he's selling pots
[14:24] and he's selling pans and or selling
[14:27] knives
[14:29] utensils that's what he's
[14:35] selling and I'm thinking there's no way
[14:39] people are coming here to buy pots and
[14:42] pans and and and knives I mean you can
[14:45] go you can go just about anywhere and
[14:47] get some pots and some pans and some
[14:49] paring not you can go online you get pot
[14:50] pan but it was it never failed just
[14:53] filled up with people every showing
[15:02] I'm thinking I've got a water
[15:10] feature like the thing the flowers the
[15:14] the fragrance
[15:18] the and they're just piling into this
[15:23] place and the thing that got to me was
[15:27] not the people that were going into the
[15:29] booth or coming out because only a few
[15:31] of them would leave with boxes of full
[15:33] of pans and
[15:36] pots but I would see people going into
[15:39] this
[15:40] booth with
[15:43] notepads with Note with notepads and and
[15:47] and and pin and I'm watching them as
[15:51] this presentation is going and I'm
[15:52] watching them scratch something down I'm
[15:55] watching them write something down and
[15:58] I'm thinking
[15:59] what what what are they watching what
[16:03] these this these are some of these are
[16:06] middle-aged people I'm seeing some
[16:09] middle-aged and and and maybe some older
[16:12] maybe our young people don't know what
[16:13] middle-aged is middle-aged is older than
[16:19] me by a long
[16:23] shot that I'm always chasing middle-aged
[16:31] and I'm thinking what are they writing
[16:32] in this
[16:34] notebook and they're leaving and they
[16:36] don't have pots and they don't have pans
[16:38] and they don't have knives but they've
[16:40] got a notebook with something written in
[16:42] this notebook and what I discovered
[16:45] after years of doing these home
[16:48] shows is that some of these people are
[16:52] signing up to come learn how to cook
[16:59] they're just looking for please give us
[17:02] a recipe to teach me how to cook a meal
[17:07] because you're going to find out at some
[17:10] point in life there are some people who
[17:14] cannot
[17:16] cook that never learned how to cook they
[17:20] never learned that there was somebody
[17:22] else who did that they didn't learn that
[17:25] and now they're at a place in their life
[17:28] where they're like I would like to learn
[17:31] how to cook a
[17:33] recipe and so they stop by this show and
[17:37] say just let me take the notes as to how
[17:40] to cook this recipe and then I've got
[17:43] one meal in my
[17:46] stash something that I can take home
[18:05] and
[18:07] so in my title as it's a full house
[18:11] cooking with
[18:15] Paul you get the Corinthian Home Show
[18:18] part of it but the cooking with Paul is
[18:24] because as Believers
[18:27] as as as as we read in this Bible and
[18:32] you'll read it in Corinthians you'll
[18:34] find
[18:35] Paul
[18:37] saying some of you think you're
[18:40] spiritual some claim to be prophets but
[18:43] he that thinks he's spiritual or or a
[18:45] prophet let him acknowledge the things
[18:49] that I write unto you are the things of
[18:52] God so Paul asserts a certain Authority
[18:57] right away
[19:00] that God speaks to
[19:04] Paul in a specific
[19:07] manner that Paul's not
[19:10] just
[19:12] uh Paul's not just anybody but that
[19:17] God speaks to Paul and has called Paul
[19:21] to
[19:23] something that is specific for Paul amen
[19:29] and and and and and the other disciples
[19:32] and apostles they they recognize that
[19:34] and they even Peter himself you'll find
[19:37] Peter saying hey you
[19:42] know you know Saul says some hard
[19:46] things but nevertheless they are the
[19:50] word of God the things that Paul says
[19:53] they're from
[19:56] God and so
[20:00] the reason that I say cooking with Paul
[20:02] is
[20:05] because as we imagine ourselves at a
[20:08] home show we're coming before
[20:11] God and we can't cook we're
[20:15] acknowledging I can't
[20:19] cook I'm helpless God
[20:25] I I want I want I want in
[20:29] but I need help and
[20:32] so as we are reading through our Bibles
[20:36] as we as Christians as we as some as
[20:39] people who who who are
[20:41] acknowledging that this is the Divine
[20:45] word of God that that men were inspired
[20:48] by the spirit of God to to write these
[20:52] things and that these aren't just words
[20:55] of encouragement that these are not just
[20:58] uh motiv good for a motivational speech
[21:01] that this is indeed God's
[21:04] thoughts pinned
[21:07] down and and and and and
[21:10] flavored
[21:12] with a a a a certain man's
[21:15] temperament and the inspiration that God
[21:18] can give
[21:20] men the way they're born the way they're
[21:22] made up God used certain men and he let
[21:25] them in their words it be his word but
[21:29] through their through their view he
[21:32] would let them pin these things or he
[21:35] would not let them but he would instruct
[21:37] them to write these things for
[21:40] us and for all
[21:44] believers and so we're recognizing
[21:48] that that we need guidance we need
[21:52] help that we're like showing up at a
[21:54] home show and we're saying we need help
[21:56] we need inspiration
[21:58] and who do we follow and we we are
[22:00] recognizing that that Paul who has
[22:04] written 2third of the New Testament is a
[22:07] key figure in helping us direct us
[22:11] toward Jesus
[22:15] Christ that we can we can read our New
[22:17] Testament and go wow Paul's got some
[22:20] some instructions in here that we need
[22:23] to follow that Paul is helping us and
[22:27] and and and no matter where you come
[22:29] from if you're a Greek if you're a Roman
[22:31] if you're a Jew if you're whatever your
[22:34] background is it seems that God is using
[22:38] Paul as an instrument to help each of us
[22:41] some of us like to lean towards the law
[22:43] some of us like Law and Order and we
[22:46] this is how we like it and Paul's going
[22:48] okay you need a balance and I'm going to
[22:51] help
[22:55] you if if you want that you go read
[22:58] Romans and Ro Romans I love Romans
[23:01] because Paul starts Romans with you know
[23:05] there's men who have have have left
[23:08] their affections for women for other men
[23:10] and women for women and and these are
[23:13] called Gentiles and they're Pagan
[23:16] they're awful and and the and the and
[23:19] the the converted Jew is going yeah
[23:22] Paul give it to him Paul he's like I've
[23:26] never even heard of such f is this and
[23:30] that's right Paul you tell those people
[23:32] those pagans yeah what do they know and
[23:35] Paul's like yeah and then and then you
[23:37] go that you go over to chapter two and
[23:39] he goes now now you that came out of the
[23:42] law you had the law and you couldn't
[23:45] keep that so you're as bad off or worse
[23:50] and the Gentiles are
[23:53] going
[23:55] ooh and then Chapter 3 of Romans you go
[23:59] chapter 3 and Paul's going so then we're
[24:01] all in the same
[24:04] boat so let's all start at Ground Zero
[24:07] here some of us like law and some of us
[24:09] like no law just hey I just hey I do as
[24:13] I feel and it's like yeah you need some
[24:15] balance and so either way Paul's going
[24:17] you need some balance and so we're we're
[24:19] acknowledging when we're reading uh
[24:21] Romans and Corinthians and Ephesians and
[24:24] that we're like okay hold just Buckle in
[24:28] buckle in okay so we're showing up now
[24:30] today at the Corinthian home show okay
[24:33] we're not in the Ephesian home show
[24:35] today we're at the Corinthian home show
[24:38] okay everybody on board all right we all
[24:42] showed up Corinthian home show here we
[24:45] go we need
[24:49] help we need help okay now in the church
[24:53] age book The sman Church age brother
[24:54] brandham says only one messenger for
[24:57] each age
[24:59] receives what the spirit has to say to
[25:01] that age and that one messenger is the
[25:05] messenger to the true
[25:07] church he speaks for God by Revelation
[25:11] to the churches both true and
[25:17] false we know that to be true yes so
[25:20] when he's speaking to the true church
[25:23] we're all saying amen and then when he's
[25:24] speaking to the false Church he's saying
[25:26] hey y'all want to be part of the true
[25:29] y'all better get in y'all better but he
[25:31] knows not all will so he's saying hey
[25:36] you know here's what what's going to
[25:38] happen but he speaks to both the message
[25:41] is then broadcast to all but though it
[25:43] is broadcast for all who come within
[25:45] range of the
[25:46] message everybody who can hear everybody
[25:49] that can can play a tape everybody that
[25:51] can hear the preaching of the Gospel
[25:53] they can all hear it but that message is
[25:56] received individually
[25:58] by only a certain qualified group in a
[26:01] certain
[26:02] way each individual of that group is one
[26:07] who has the ability to hear what the
[26:10] spirit is saying by way of the
[26:15] messenger amen so we read Paul and we're
[26:18] going that's the me that's God's
[26:22] messenger
[26:24] amen now there's times where we're
[26:26] saying it like amen
[26:29] like oh that hurt that hit me that got
[26:32] me you got me on that but we're saying
[26:35] amen so be it we're still saying so be
[26:37] it that God it hurts but God you know
[26:40] thy will be done not my will be done thy
[26:43] will be
[26:44] done those who here are not getting
[26:47] their own private Revelation that's
[26:50] right we're like but please I I pray God
[26:53] that I'm not nor is a group getting
[26:56] their Collective revelation
[26:59] right we're not all the you know
[27:03] right like you better everybody better
[27:06] say right on it's like come
[27:08] on this isn't a collective thing this is
[27:11] an individual walk with you and
[27:13] God but each person is
[27:17] hearing not just with their ear hearing
[27:20] and receiving what the messenger has
[27:22] already received from
[27:25] God woo praise God for that
[27:30] Paul alone had the full Revelation for
[27:34] his
[27:36] day as evidenced by his confrontation of
[27:39] the other apostles who admitted that
[27:42] Paul was the prophet Messenger to the
[27:44] Gentiles for that
[27:51] day in every age we have exactly the
[27:54] same pattern every Church age we see
[27:56] this
[27:58] we see this whether that's Paul
[28:01] irenius whether that's Martin
[28:05] Columba Luther Wesley we see God sent a
[28:10] messenger he stood out and and those
[28:13] that received that message they walked
[28:14] in that light called The Bride for that
[28:20] age in every age we have exactly the
[28:22] same pattern that is why the light comes
[28:25] through some god-given messenger in a
[28:27] certain area and then then from that
[28:29] messenger there spreads the light
[28:32] through the ministry of others who have
[28:34] been Faithfully taught oh praise God for
[28:39] that praise God that there are still men
[28:42] who are Faithfully taught by the way of
[28:46] that
[28:50] messenger but of course all those who go
[28:53] out don't always learn how necessary it
[28:56] is to speak only what the messenger has
[28:59] spoken we know that's just
[29:04] nature
[29:06] sorry we're not in the Sweet By and By
[29:09] yet we're still in the nasty now and
[29:15] now so in 1 Corinthians chapter 4 okay
[29:19] we're really emphasizing 1 Corinthians
[29:21] here today 1 Corinthians 4: 16 and 17
[29:25] wherefore I beseech you be ye followers
[29:28] of me Paul says these exact words in
[29:31] chap 11 verse one Paul once again he he
[29:35] he he he repeats this be ye followers of
[29:38] me as I follow Christ so here he starts
[29:41] it in chapter 4 I beseech you be ye
[29:44] followers of me for this cause as your
[29:47] followers of me for this cause I've sent
[29:50] unto you Timothy timotheus who is my
[29:53] beloved Son and faithful in the Lord who
[29:57] shall bring you to a new revelation no
[30:00] shall bring you into remembrance of my
[30:04] ways which be in Christ as I teach
[30:06] everywhere in every church this is
[30:09] exactly what brother bandam just got
[30:11] finished saying that there is a
[30:12] messenger but from that messenger there
[30:14] are faithful men who are taught who have
[30:18] a call to say and spread the same
[30:24] message and that's how we hear of that's
[30:27] how we hear it a lot of times
[30:28] times you know you didn't go down to
[30:30] your local tape store and get yourself a
[30:34] tape and take it home sometimes it was
[30:37] somebody on a job site sometimes it was
[30:39] somebody at a coffee shop somewhere it
[30:41] was somebody so a friend of a friend you
[30:44] visited their home and then you heard
[30:47] about the word of God and you saw there
[30:49] was something different in their life
[30:51] and it drew your attention and you said
[30:53] what have they got I want that
[30:58] and then it all goes back to a source
[31:00] well let's go back to the
[31:02] source okay and and so here we all are
[31:05] and it's like why are you telling us
[31:06] we're all
[31:11] here now as we go through this
[31:15] cooking cooking slch Christian Life
[31:21] drama I want to real quickly go through
[31:24] the book of First Corinthians I wish
[31:26] that I could just grab a t ton of
[31:28] scriptures and we could just sit here
[31:30] and do this but in your own time go
[31:32] through the book of Corinthians if you
[31:34] download Alexander scorby on your
[31:37] audible it will take you an hour to
[31:41] listen to the whole book of First
[31:47] Corinthians so little subtitle here you
[31:50] are
[31:51] Christians now act like
[31:55] it or in cooking home show cooking terms
[32:00] you want to
[32:01] cook that's why you showed up with your
[32:04] notebook was not for the pots and the
[32:06] pans it was not for the night maybe
[32:08] you'll grab those maybe you'll buy
[32:10] them if they really impress you maybe
[32:13] you'll buy a box of pans and pots but
[32:17] really we've come here to learn how to
[32:21] cook and you've said in your heart I
[32:23] want to sign up because I want to cook
[32:26] and the reason that we've come into a
[32:29] building like this today is because
[32:32] something in our heart says I want to be
[32:35] a
[32:40] Christian the reason you you say Lord
[32:43] Jesus I Surrender my heart to you is
[32:46] because you want to be a
[32:52] Christian
[32:54] now just a little synopsis of this I
[32:57] just grabbed
[32:58] there's so much but in 1 Corinthians
[33:01] chapter 2 and: 12 it says now we have
[33:04] received not the spirit of the world but
[33:07] the spirit which is of god that we might
[33:10] know the things that are freely given to
[33:13] us of
[33:16] God
[33:18] so remember in the beginning we said we
[33:21] read that quote brother brandom said the
[33:24] Corinthian Church was always having
[33:25] trouble Paul was always having trouble
[33:27] couldn't it was hard to keep them
[33:29] straight and we all said oh I'm not a
[33:32] Corinth I'm not like
[33:33] them I'm not like that that's not
[33:37] me I say I'm a young person and I'm
[33:40] going to be the greatest Christian that
[33:41] this world has ever
[33:43] seen I'm GNA change the world I'm GNA
[33:46] change the world when it comes to
[33:47] Christians ain't nobody's seen a
[33:48] Christian like I I'm a Christian and
[33:50] praise and and and and I'm not I'm not
[33:52] making light at

[34:18] lifting the grill and everything in the
[34:21] groceries right like you're like I want
[34:23] my children to be better than I ever
[34:26] was okay but but but before you have
[34:28] children when you're young and you're
[34:29] single you're like you know you don't
[34:32] know anything about that you just know
[34:33] it's me it's it's me I'm going to be and
[34:36] it's like praise God I hope you
[34:41] are okay but Paul you know when we're
[34:44] when we're like really like all those
[34:46] Corinthians then you become then you
[34:50] live and once in a while you are looking
[34:55] at the stature of a perfect man and
[34:57] you're going Faith yes Faith got faith I
[35:00] you know got that one Faith virtue yeah
[35:03] knowledge
[35:04] Temperance
[35:06] godliness ah yeah brotherly kindness I
[35:10] think I got it I think I'm I'm right
[35:12] there I mean I'm right there at the
[35:13] Capstone and then all of a sudden
[35:15] somebody cuts you off in traffic and
[35:17] boop boop boop like you roll right down
[35:21] that
[35:22] pyramid and then and and by the time
[35:25] you're done with your screaming fit and
[35:27] traffic
[35:29] you're asking God do I even have
[35:37] faith like sure brotherly kindness is
[35:40] gone that one that one went right away
[35:44] but godliness oh that
[35:48] really okay virtue virtue being that
[35:51] that power to draw from that somebody
[35:53] can draw from you as that woman who
[35:55] touched the Garment of Jesus and it
[35:58] pulled virtue from him is having that
[36:00] kind of virtue and where is that where

[40:47] want a sick
[40:50] body you're learning how to cook here
[40:53] you don't want you don't want to be sick
[40:56] and you don't want to make anybody else
[40:58] sick who comes to visit you
[41:01] right you want them to enjoy your meal

[41:05] home show and learn to cook a second
[41:07] meal from that Chef selling whatever
[41:10] he's selling right is everybody getting
[41:12] starting to get this picture we've got
[41:14] to keep this clean so let's let's let's
[41:16] go over in 1 Corinthians chapter 6 I'm
[41:18] just again I just grabbed one verse but
[41:20] it should give you a good idea chapter 6
[41:23] and verse 11 it says and okay I'm going
[41:27] to start back at verse 9 know ye not
[41:29] that the unrighteous shall not inherit
[41:32] the kingdom of God be not deceived
[41:35] neither fornicators nor idolators nor
[41:38] adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of
[41:41] themselves with mankind nor thieves nor
[41:45] Covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor
[41:49] extortioners shall inherit the kingdom
[41:51] of God and we're like yeah that's right
[41:54] go get them and Paul says and such were
[41:57] some of
[42:10] you
[42:12] but you are
[42:15] washed but you are
[42:17] Sanctified but you are justified in the
[42:20] name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit
[42:23] of our God
[42:27] he's still in the washing
[42:29] business he's still in the I don't care
[42:32] how long you've been cooking I don't
[42:34] care how long you've been doing it he's
[42:36] still in the cleaning business he can
[42:39] still wash you even though you've been
[42:41] walking this way a long way you say God
[42:44] I still I I messed up I feel filthy I
[42:47] accidentally let the raw chicken touch
[42:49] this that's okay God can purify he's got
[42:53] he's got meal uh that he can put in the
[42:56] to get the poison out of the pot he's
[42:58] got that meal and that meal is Christ
[43:00] and if you put that meal in that pot
[43:02] it'll pull the poison out and you could
[43:04] be clean and keep right on
[43:09] walking so Paul through this chapters 5
[43:12] through 11 Paul is saying okay
[43:15] Corinthian Church you've decided you
[43:17] want to be Christians but y'all be
[43:22] dirty cooking nasty like what are you
[43:25] doing he says I I hear that there's
[43:27] somebody in your church who's living
[43:30] with his stepdad's wife or his dad's
[43:34] step you know your
[43:36] stepmom
[43:38] what and and it's it's like yeah we get
[43:41] it the world does those things but
[43:43] you're all calling yourselves Christians
[43:45] and you're doing that that's not what
[43:49] Christians
[43:50] do if you were to say well I'm not a
[43:53] Christian okay well then we wouldn't
[43:55] expect anything different from you
[43:58] I mean the world does some Wild Things
[44:01] awful sick disgusting things but as CHR
[44:05] as a somebody who says I claim the name
[44:08] of Christ over me I'm no longer my own
[44:11] I'm
[44:12] his and you're still doing that no no no
[44:16] no no no no Paul says I'm not even with
[44:19] you and I've already judged this
[44:21] situation so here's how we're going to
[44:23] clean that up here's how we're going to
[44:26] clean it Paul doesn't just say oh y'all
[44:28] are filthy I'm out of here figure out
[44:31] this I'm leaving this home
[44:33] show it's like no you no Paul
[44:38] says let's go through
[44:40] this why to keep the body
[44:45] clean okay so he he uh in in in chapter
[44:49] 6 when you get to verse 18 He says flee
[44:52] fornication every sin that a man doeth
[44:55] is without the body but he that
[44:57] committeth fornication sinth against his
[44:58] own body there's all kinds of things
[45:00] that you can do they don't affect you it
[45:02] affects somebody else but fornication
[45:05] Paul's saying you're it affects you
[45:10] you're heavily
[45:13] involved
[45:15] and not only just literally but the it
[45:19] affects the body of Christ when you are
[45:23] claiming not to be a part of Arizona
[45:25] Believers Church but the body of
[45:31] Christ and so Paul's saying let's keep
[45:33] it clean when you get over to chapter
[45:35] chapter nine at the end Paul says but I
[45:38] keep under my body and bring it into
[45:41] subjection lest that by any means when I
[45:44] have preached to others I myself should
[45:47] be a Castaway now that Castaway in my
[45:50] scull field is
[45:52] is which is disapproved but in
[45:55] another translation is also
[45:58] disqualified so Paul's saying there are
[46:00] things that within the ministry within
[46:03] being able to preach that you will
[46:05] disqualify a man from being able to do
[46:09] that and and so Paul's saying I have to
[46:12] keep myself under
[46:14] subjection so that I'm not dis not that
[46:16] I would lose my
[46:18] salvation but I'd be dis I'd be
[46:21] disqualified so Paul is walking us
[46:24] through in these chapters 5 through 11
[46:26] Paul is walking us through Corinthian
[46:29] Church you can be clean keep this
[46:32] because it's not about you and it's not
[46:34] about your local church it's about the
[46:36] body of
[46:39] Christ it's about being part of that big
[46:42] body and we want to keep it
[46:46] clean so then we move on to the next
[46:48] section of cooking better than being
[46:52] gifted or in cooking terms because I
[46:55] love him
[46:57] now in 1 Corinthians chapter 12 I the
[46:59] reason I I put these verses 12
[47:02] 31-13 is because I don't know who split
[47:06] up the chapters when they split up the
[47:08] chapters in The Bible I'm not sure who
[47:10] did that but it I never like to just
[47:14] when I'm reading through uh 1
[47:16] Corinthians chapter 12 I don't like to
[47:18] stop at
[47:19] 12:31 because it just seems to blend
[47:22] right into 13 it so perfectly and I'll
[47:25] and I'll show you what I mean cuz I'm
[47:27] going to read it for you it
[47:29] says uh in in in in chapter 31 a little
[47:32] bit higher um you know Paul's saying um
[47:37] there there's gifts tongues
[47:38] interpretations prophecy healing all
[47:41] these things that are within the body
[47:42] there's gifts that God has put within
[47:45] this big body of Christ he says but are
[47:48] all prophets do all speak with tongues
[47:50] do all interpret no no not all do and so
[47:53] Paul ends here and he says but covet
[47:56] earnestly the best gifts and yet show I
[47:59] you a more excellent way though I speak
[48:03] with the tongues of men and angels and
[48:05] have not charity I'm become a sounding
[48:07] brass or tinkling symbol and though I
[48:09] have the gift of Prophecy and understand
[48:11] all Mysteries and all knowledge and
[48:14] though I have all Faith so that I could
[48:15] remove mountains and have not charity
[48:17] I'm nothing and though I bestow all my
[48:20] goods to feed the poor and though I give
[48:22] my body to be burned and have not
[48:24] charity it profiteth me nothing so Paul
[48:27] when you take those two chapters and you
[48:29] put them together rather than just
[48:30] cutting off 12 and then new subject it's
[48:32] not it's not a new subject it's Paul's
[48:35] just continuing that subject that listen
[48:37] having being gifted is is great you know
[48:42] some of you then that would be like the
[48:44] guy at the show saying I don't even know
[48:46] why some of you all are here at here you
[48:49] know like you've got a gift of cooking
[48:51] you know you could do it but we're all
[48:53] acknowledging and saying
[48:56] I can't
[48:58] cook I tried it like can I mix things
[49:06] yeah and sometimes that's
[49:08] awful you know like you know I'm put
[49:11] some I'm put some chicken liers in my
[49:14] you know in my Frosted Flakes this
[49:16] morning you're
[49:18] like you're like I'm good at mixing food
[49:21] it's like no yeah you can mix but you
[49:24] don't
[49:27] okay so you're like but I'm really
[49:29] gifted at being able to mix it's like
[49:44] look as
[49:52] Christians we come into this body and we
[49:54] say God
[49:57] I don't know what I have to offer
[50:01] you but just take take it and use it how
[50:06] you would
[50:09] like I mean this is the life of Jesus
[50:12] right is is look I don't do anything
[50:14] until my father shows me you know and
[50:17] and and and then we see him in the
[50:19] garden overcoming saying not my will
[50:21] Lord thine be done and though he could
[50:25] have called 10,000 angels to pull him
[50:27] from that cross he didn't he didn't do
[50:30] it he subjected himself and so then we
[50:34] take that example we look into that
[50:36] example and we say you know but but
[50:39] suddenly somebody enters into this body
[50:42] of Christ and we go wow you can sing or
[50:46] wow like you you're sure good at
[50:49] organizing events or you're sure good at
[50:53] what whatever it is I'm I'm I'm simply
[50:55] throwing things out there
[50:57] and it's not like I sure it's like
[51:02] well God if that's what you would so
[51:05] desire to use so be it but if you never
[51:08] used it one thing's for sure I want to
[51:12] love
[51:14] you I want to be pleasing to you whether
[51:17] I use a gift or never use the gift I've
[51:21] never you know offered that opportunity
[51:24] God I love you and so the idea behind
[51:28] this I want to learn how to cook so that
[51:30] everybody can see my pairing knife
[51:32] skills that everybody is going to
[51:34] receive at the end of this sermon if
[51:36] you'll just stay
[51:37] awake it's not to so that you can show
[51:40] off your knife skills that you learned
[51:41] at the home show why did you come to
[51:44] learn how to cook because probably
[51:46] there's somebody in your
[51:51] mind
[51:53] perhaps that person is going home to
[51:56] somebody who said I'm tired of microwave
[52:00] dinners every night I'm tired of
[52:03] spending so much money going to the
[52:05] restaurant every
[52:07] meal and the person said you know what I
[52:11] love
[52:12] you and I want to learn how to cook so
[52:17] that I can be pleasing to
[52:24] you because there's somebody you
[52:30] love I want to learn how to do this
[52:32] because there's somebody that I'd love
[52:35] to help and in our case you know Paul
[52:38] here whether he's saying uh you know if
[52:42] I don't have charity for others or
[52:44] whether it's go charity toward God the
[52:48] idea is that having love it starts with
[52:52] God our love for God for sure but then
[52:55] it goes out
[53:00] so this chapters 12- 14 we see Paul
[53:04] really going over when you do something
[53:07] let the motive be for
[53:13] love let's let that be our
[53:17] motive finally in chapter
[53:24] 15 why what
[53:27] for the idea is forever
[53:30] full but in chapter 15 and verse 14 it
[53:34] says this and if Christ be not risen
[53:37] then is our preaching in vain and your
[53:39] faith is also
[53:43] vain Paul takes chapter 15 of 1
[53:47] Corinthians and he says
[53:59] if if Jesus came to
[54:04] Earth and was was just a
[54:08] man it was not deity it was a
[54:13] man and he duped everybody he he fooled
[54:18] everyone and we're all following a
[54:24] lie then we're in trouble
[54:38] but Paul is saying Christ was not just a
[54:41] man not just a teacher this was God in
[54:44] flesh and not only did he die to fulfill
[54:48] that atonement for the the the for for
[54:52] our sins for our sickness but he rose
[54:54] again
[54:56] he rose again he's alive he didn't
[55:00] remain Dead He's Alive and he sent back
[55:04] that life within us within us so that
[55:07] the very life that was in Christ that
[55:09] very example of Christ will come right
[55:12] out of you it's not a oh I hope I can I
[55:15] hope I can I hope I can no no no no if
[55:18] that life is within you it manifest
[55:21] that's what brother brandom says a sheep
[55:22] does not manufacture wool it Bears wool
[55:26] and so when that life comes within you
[55:28] all of a sudden you start bearing fruit
[55:32] that you did on your own you could never
[55:34] bear that before you didn't know how to
[55:36] do so the the Paul is saying there is
[55:41] that not only did he die not only did he
[55:43] resurrect but he's coming
[55:47] back he you he's coming back for
[55:51] believers and that there's a place that
[55:54] he's prepared and that there 's a place
[55:56] we're all going to go to and that when
[55:58] this world is over there is a place
[56:01] where no more Sorrows no no more of this
[56:05] that's the thing that we're looking
[56:06] forward to that's the thing that drives
[56:09] a Believer forward is because we're
[56:11] we're we're not looking back and saying
[56:13] well that was nice and that was awesome
[56:16] and oh if I could have lived in the days
[56:18] it's no no no no no he's still alive now
[56:22] and there's something awaiting for us
[56:26] there's something that presses us
[56:28] forward cuz we know this thing ain't
[56:30] finished yet it's not over that one day
[56:35] that we're going to those that are alive
[56:37] and remain are going to be changed those
[56:39] that have died in Christ are going to be
[56:41] resurrected we're going to be together
[56:43] for all the rest of Eternity and that
[56:46] we're going to be in a place to where
[56:48] there's no more suffering there's no
[56:49] more sorrow there's no more hungering
[56:51] that will be forever full that forever
[56:56] we will be full of the of of peace and
[57:00] love and joy there'll be no more sin to
[57:02] tempt there'll be no more of that that
[57:05] day we're looking forward to
[57:09] that that you're not doing these things
[57:11] in vains Corinthians that I'm not asking
[57:14] you to Walk This Way that we're not
[57:16] talking about this is how to cook just
[57:19] because that there's a purpose for it
[57:23] there's a purpose for living this there
[57:26] is something that that that that that
[57:28] counts right now that it it matters in
[57:31] your life but yet it's going to matter
[57:34] for for not only for you for your
[57:36] children for your friends for your
[57:38] colleagues for those you come in contact
[57:41] with until we get out of here
[57:57] now as I'm listening
[57:59] to Corinthians book of
[58:03] Correction comes right down to the
[58:09] end and brother
[58:12] brandom he's he's saying now we're about
[58:15] to have some Revival
[58:16] meetings and so that's why I'm preaching
[58:19] this
[58:21] service and you'll hear him say this in
[58:23] many when when he's starting out a
[58:26] weekend of
[58:27] meetings because and he's asking you
[58:30] know how many would like a prayer line
[58:31] and you can just tell there must be just
[58:34] to all hands and he's going okay all
[58:37] right we're going to make sure then that
[58:39] we pray for the sick that we're going to
[58:41] make
[58:42] sure that there's a healing that there's
[58:45] a line and if God would would come and
[58:47] heal then we're going to believe that
[58:50] and and and of course people were very
[58:52] much drawn for the healing there I mean
[58:55] there's people that are pulling people
[58:57] right out of hospitals they don't know
[58:59] no nothing about the message they don't
[59:01] know nothing about brother Brandon they
[59:02] don't know about the Bible necessarily
[59:04] they're just in a bed that they may die
[59:07] but their family knows about this
[59:10] healing Revival and so they're bringing
[59:11] them to the meetings whether they know
[59:14] about it or not and so brother brandom
[59:16] many of times you'll hear him start
[59:18] these meetings and he says okay but
[59:20] before before I do uh preach for a a
[59:25] healing service
[59:28] let's start with the soul and make sure
[59:31] the soul is right first because if you
[59:34] get healed in this
[59:36] meeting you're going to get sick again
[59:39] if you live long enough you'll probably
[59:41] get sick again in your
[59:44] life good chance
[59:46] right so so then you're going to look
[59:51] back at these meetings and go well I was
[59:53] healed there and that's the Pinnacle
[59:56] it's like no no no no no but I'm saying
[59:58] let you're getting the cart before the
[1:00:00] horse let's deal with the soul first if
[1:00:04] the soul is taken care of whether you're
[1:00:07] healed or you're sick every day of the
[1:00:10] rest of your life it won't matter you've
[1:00:12] got eternity
[1:00:15] waiting
[1:00:20] right and so brother B says now we're
[1:00:22] going to have some re re that's why he's
[1:00:24] preaching this Corinthians book of
[1:00:26] Corrections cuz he's starting with okay
[1:00:30] let's start let's get this part right
[1:00:35] first and he gets to this part and it
[1:00:38] just hit me just a real oh right in the
[1:00:44] bullseye brother bam says and now just
[1:00:46] think of yourself fooling with the world
[1:00:50] and tangling with the world and get down
[1:00:52] on your knees say oh Lord Jesus I love
[1:00:55] you
[1:00:56] you it's a burning Judas hypocrite
[1:01:00] kiss that's right think of these things
[1:01:03] there's a Revival coming up now see oh
[1:01:07] you might have the wedding ring on
[1:01:09] that's right but you're not a wife oh
[1:01:13] you might be a woman you might be the
[1:01:16] lady of the house but you're not a wife
[1:01:18] if you act like
[1:01:22] that so I stopped there because brother
[1:01:24] brandom had juste previously said men
[1:01:27] imagine if you get home from work and
[1:01:30] your wife wraps her arm around you and
[1:01:32] says oh darling but you knew you somehow
[1:01:35] knew that she was unfaithful and with
[1:01:39] another man and then you got home and
[1:01:41] she came home and she said that to you
[1:01:44] how would you really feel about that and
[1:01:50] obviously the idea is for not not how
[1:01:55] would you how would the wife feel if the
[1:01:56] husband did the same thing the idea is
[1:01:59] as
[1:02:02] Believers if if we're if we say I'm a
[1:02:05] Christian and we're still fooling with
[1:02:08] the things of the world it's a burn and
[1:02:11] then we tell Jesus I love you Lord It's
[1:02:15] a burning Judas hypocrite
[1:02:20] kiss this is where the rubber meets the
[1:02:23] road
[1:02:27] and I think oh
[1:02:37] God I I want to be likened unto the
[1:02:40] Ephesians Romans
[1:02:44] but if I can't apply
[1:02:48] this what good would it do
[1:02:51] me to go into the deep things and all of
[1:02:54] that
[1:02:59] brother Bram goes right on he
[1:03:01] says without this this is just right
[1:03:04] paragraph right up paragraph So I didn't
[1:03:06] I didn't skip anything here I don't care
[1:03:08] if my wife couldn't never comb her hair
[1:03:10] or if she didn't wear a pretty dress or
[1:03:13] never there she'd be my sweetheart I
[1:03:17] admire her because her loyalty her
[1:03:20] virtue what she is that's what she is
[1:03:27] and by a Christian men and women that's
[1:03:30] what we are in the sight of God it's not
[1:03:34] because that we can go to the best
[1:03:36] church or we can dress best or we can
[1:03:39] get in this neighborhood or we can do
[1:03:42] this or we can ride in this or we can do
[1:03:44] this that that doesn't have one thing to
[1:03:47] do with it it's the virtue of our
[1:03:51] loyalty and our love to Christ and
[1:03:54] that's the birth
[1:03:57] that's the thing that
[1:04:07] comes and I just it's like I heard that
[1:04:11] on tape when I heard him say you may
[1:04:13] have the wedding ring on but that don't
[1:04:15] mean you're a
[1:04:16] wife and and and all it could think was
[1:04:20] me you know this I believe I believe I'm
[1:04:25] a part brother BR said if you if there's
[1:04:28] one that's going to make it you believe
[1:04:29] you're that one right so I I say oh God
[1:04:33] I I want to believe I'm that one that I
[1:04:36] that if there's if you've got a little
[1:04:38] bride I'm a part of that I'm a part of
[1:04:40] that bride but don't let me just go
[1:04:43] around flaunting I got the ring on I got
[1:04:46] the ring
[1:04:47] on if I'm acting in a
[1:04:50] way that's displeasing to him
[1:04:55] the whole reason that I want that name
[1:05:00] Christian and not
[1:05:04] PL because I want to be identified with
[1:05:08] Christ because I love
[1:05:11] him it's him that I
[1:05:15] love we can get us together we can like
[1:05:19] each other and we can even say I really
[1:05:21] love you but there could be some things
[1:05:23] where like yeah but that gets under my
[1:05:25] skin a little bit that's
[1:05:30] fine but I want to be a
[1:05:35] Christian if I get under your skin I
[1:05:38] still would want you to say you're my
[1:05:42] brother I I don't love you
[1:05:47] because because of your red hair I don't
[1:05:50] love you brother regge because of that
[1:05:52] it's it's because of you're a Christian
[1:05:55] yes I seek
[1:05:58] Christ and as Believers as as human
[1:06:01] beings that's that's what we want for
[1:06:04] everybody is is be a Christian I want
[1:06:08] you to be a
[1:06:11] Christian you the
[1:06:15] benefits I mean why even talk about the
[1:06:17] benefits but there are benefits and and
[1:06:20] this this being able to cook with Paul
[1:06:24] that that that we're not just like well
[1:06:25] Paul could well Paul could no it's to be
[1:06:27] able to cook with
[1:06:29] Paul it's like when Paul's going through
[1:06:32] this we're like amen yes yes amen that's
[1:06:37] true and and and I'm closing with this
[1:06:40] and that was that was the last of my
[1:06:42] notes so you know we're about to get out
[1:06:44] of here within an
[1:06:49] hour I said Corinthian homes show but
[1:06:53] not a home show Corinthian homes
[1:07:00] show they
[1:07:03] show the the talk all the you know well
[1:07:06] I've got G yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[1:07:08] that's great that's great but but your
[1:07:11] homes they show your home life it
[1:07:16] shows I mean put the suit on all you
[1:07:19] want put the whatever you want on Sunday
[1:07:21] you come here but your home life shows
[1:07:26] it will come
[1:07:35] out I heard a
[1:07:37] man I don't know if he claims to be a
[1:07:40] Christian or not he's a doctor he's
[1:07:42] psychologist and he's always talking
[1:07:45] about the Bible and he's always sharing
[1:07:47] things about the Bible and so everybody
[1:07:50] asks
[1:07:51] him are you a Christian or do you
[1:07:54] believe in God that's the question do
[1:07:55] you believe in God and he said you know
[1:07:58] I don't like that question I don't like
[1:08:00] being asked that
[1:08:02] question and they're like
[1:08:04] well please proceed explain because
[1:08:08] you're sure talking about the Bible a
[1:08:10] lot and and and a man ought to follow
[1:08:13] the the example of Christ and so on and
[1:08:15] so forth so do you believe in God he
[1:08:16] said I don't like the question I don't
[1:08:18] like to be asked that question they said
[1:08:19] why not he said because if a person
[1:08:23] really believed in God
[1:08:26] then their life would live out the
[1:08:29] expression that they believed it and he
[1:08:32] said I don't know if my life bears that
[1:08:35] out and I thought oh my so close right I
[1:08:40] mean just woo just like coming right to
[1:08:44] it and if if we all took this idea that
[1:08:48] you
[1:08:49] know are you a
[1:08:52] Christian say hey we're Christians in
[1:08:54] this church I say are you a
[1:08:57] Christian and you're like
[1:09:02] well
[1:09:04] yeah and I thought about that so much
[1:09:07] because I thought that's true that man
[1:09:10] who who who Who's who knows nothing
