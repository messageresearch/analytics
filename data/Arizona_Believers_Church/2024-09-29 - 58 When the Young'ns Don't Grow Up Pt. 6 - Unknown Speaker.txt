TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we're using the phrase grow up for a very specific purpose and the title has been when the youngans grow up and we're using grow up to reference to the process of maturing and even the reference of youngans to think about babies in Christ and those who've been birthed by the word and the Holy Spirit has sealed them into the body of Christ and so the phrase grow up uh is intentional and I'm wanting to use it to not only indicate the process of maturing but this maturing unto ult fulfilling your ultimate purpose and maturing unto adoption and we've looked at the subject of adoption a number of times I'll just maybe give the warning and some may say this would be appropriate for every um service but there's going to be a lot of repetition I look back in the last four years and it was four years ago this month that we had our first regular service on a Sunday and we haven't stopped since then and so there's kind of an anniversary month of sorts though we don't really look too much to those things uh but in these four years I realized there's been a lot of repetition on a number of different subjects and maybe we could reduce them down to just a few uh but it's just the way the Lord has led us and also as the church has grown maybe there's some that uh the Lord addresses and we kind of so that we're all kind of in the same place and we're harmonized and we have a same vision and goal not only as a local body but as the body of Christ and I would acknowledge I acknowledge that the subject of adoption is uh easily misunderstood OD and not intentionally misunderstood but it can be easily misunderstood I still can remember the time in my life when God begin to open up to me the subject of adoption the impact that it had on me uh personally and individually and yet the kind of the extreme nature with which I responded to that and I can still remember brother Bill Ivy uh making a couple comments behind the pulpit uh he was there it was in hom Homer Louisiana he was preaching and at the very end of the service he made a couple statements about adoption that just oriented me a little bit better and made me realize wow there's a way that you could look at this that makes it something that it's not and so I believe that God is always uh wanting to bring us deeper into a greater understanding of even those things we believe we already understand and so as this process unfolds I trust that God could deal with you in your own personal way to understand better what he's wanting you to know so I'm not trying to force a particular agenda on this subject but rather uh be fa faithful to how brother brandham taught the subject so that we could understand what God wants us to know in this end time in Ephesians chapter 1 verse5 I'm taking a little piece from chapter 4 as it's laid out in our scofi Bibles but it says in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will brother Brandon points to the scripture quite a bit on the subject of adoption and he points out that election looks for and all election looks back to fornal that God forew you therefore he elected you but then predestination looks forward to Destiny you might actually find that in your scoffield that it's written just exactly that way and so this and in the margin notes there the footnotes so this predestination isn't looking to where you even are now but the process that God wants to ultimately bring you to and that is the adoption of children by Jesus Christ it is according to the good pleasure of his will so this is God's perfect will this is his desire this is what he wants for you and the word adoption that is used here speaks of establishing something or fixing something and and a making of something so there is in some ways uh an application or way that we could view it and someone say we've been adopted as children into the body of Christ and to use that language wouldn't be wrong if we're using it in a familiar sense in terms of what happens now I'm a sinner now I'm in the body of Christ God has brought me into his family and there's a way that we use that brother random at times used that word to actually speak of that transition of coming out of the world and out of sin into the body of Christ and so when by one Spirit he's baptized all of us into the body of Christ we've entered into that then brother brandom opens up another dimension to it that now that we are in the promised land of the Holy Ghost there's an establishing and a fixing and a making a more permanent uh Dwelling Place in that promised land so brother M used the phrase the placing of children not the birth of children but the placing of children which I believe we could say is maturing if maturity I think sometimes just helps us because there's some words sometimes that we could be used brother BMA even thinks he says the word predestination has become a a a gaggy thing or a hair in a Biscuit or it's become a term that's uh uncomfortable for some people in Pentecost and so he might use a different phrase just to appease them brother bam called it coming of age he said in another place seasoned out so there's this process it's not this moment in time but it's this process as a matter of fact brother brandham says that um though I think in some ways as Believers we've established stations of justification sanctification baptism and the Holy Ghost and say well when I was 13 and2 at 12:00 in the morning I got Justified and then six years later I got Sanctified and we have these stations in life but in reality God can do all three at once and in a moment of confession and repentance and a move of the power of God a person could be brought into the baptism of the Holy Ghost brother ramam said there's no more tering meetings for the Holy Ghost because when that day of Pentecost was fully come the time at which God had appointed for the Holy Spirit to come it's at that moment the Holy Spirit was poured out in the church and from that moment on it's been the age of the Holy Ghost for every True Believer and so you're no longer pining for it and yelling for it or begging for it God's promised it to the believer and he says if you've been seeking the Holy Ghost for years he says and you don't have it you either mistaught you don't understand or something's wrong somewhere so there is a ability there's God can come on the scene and change a person's life in a moment but then the seasoning out and this as brother says coming of age is something that takes place to one who has been born again brother uses this phrase when they mature and show what they are we could see somebody worshiping the Lord and praising God and they could be shouting or speaking in tongues you may look over at them and notice maybe their hair is a different way or they're dressed a different way you can begin to immediately judge them not knowing that that is a child of God and you've judged them externally and I would say they haven't shown who they are yet you haven't seen who they are because the life is just now begun and I would say that the goal of the word we've been saying the goal of the baptism of the Holy Ghost is that we remain no we not remain children we see that in Ephesians chapter 4 we don't want to always be children but as Paul said I travail until Christ be formed in you that we grow into Christ's image that's the goal of the word birth is to bring us into Christ's image in Romans 8:1 17 this speaks to this is some review picking up some review and it speaks to the very purpose of the Holy Ghost uh and this process of maturity if children then HS as children as babes in Christ we should desire and seek for the milk of the word of God that we may grow thereby because as children we stand to receive an inheritance not just the earnest of that inheritance not just the earnest of the adoption which is the Holy Ghost but rather we stand as children we stand to receive uh more the wece to receive the inheritance and so if children then heirs Heirs of God and join heirs with Christ so this as children we're heirs and be because we are heirs God wants to deal with us a particular way and he says if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together the phrase glorified together is intentional Jesus in praying uh asked that the father would glorify him with the glory that he had and God speaks back and he says I've glorified you once I'll glorify you again and there was a glorification at is baptism there was another glorification to come and then he says I want my children to be glorified also that we may also be glorified together and to participate in this Glory we must suffer and this suffering is the process of character development why do we have to go through the process of character development because of our destiny because of our calling because of our inheritance do I need to go through the process of character development in order to be saved no do I need to go through the process of character development in order to be worthy of the baptism goes no but it's just an understanding that scripturally there is a process that God takes his children through and it's for the reason of you inheriting all that God would have for you in 2 Corinthians 12:14 uh I I feel I just feel a real intense burden this morning so um I apologize if my pacing is a little bit too quick but I'll say here we could just pause for a moment now we want to begin to just break this down in great detail so with that as a foundation recognize this principle in scripture 2 Corinthians chapter 12:14 behold the third time I'm ready to come to you and will not be burdensome to you for I seek not yours but you and Paul is even prior writing about how you know he he doesn't want to be a burden to the church and them having to support his ministry and look out after him and so he says I don't want to be a burden I'm not looking for what you have I don't want your resources or your time but I I worried about you I I'm convinced of your calling and I'm concerned about you and he says for the children ought not to lay up for the parents but the parents for the children Paul considered himself to be a father in The Gospel to the Corinthian Church and he's saying you as my spiritual children you don't have to lay up for me you shouldn't be laying up for me or providing for me but rather as a spiritual father I want to provide for you and he's drawing he makes this statement to make his point and if you look on both sides of this later you'll find that uh Paul is using a natural type to reinforce what he's been using in a spiritual sense but he's identifying that parents have a duty I would say an obligation but maybe even better a burden to care for their children that there is a a responsibility that they gladly take on there's something unique that's birthed with inside a parent where they have not just this Duty and obligation and even a legal responsibility in some cases but there's a love that drives them to do this and therefore they're concerned about how they're brought up they want to rear them they want to provide for them they want to look out after them and in doing this as he says the Parents Ought To Lay up for the children they should be forward-looking and they should be thinking about their children's future not just their own present that when we raise children sometimes we're in the moment and and we're more worried about the way things look in that moment uh and we're maybe worried about the immediate future but par parenting kind of has a long range vision and it's forward-looking and as much as we would love for them to stay a certain age or a certain size or a certain way how we have to understand that one day we hope that they would move on in life and experience the same things that we have been able to experience marriage and Parenthood and the cycle begin again that should be a parents long-term longr Vision that they're providing not just in the moment what they will eat what they wear and while they live but resources so for their future and we say Paul as a father in The Gospel was laying up for them spiritual Treasures laying up for them not things that would just get them through a church service and not just doing things that would get them through the meeting whenever he came and put on the dog for me I'm coming let's make that weekend really great but he was wanting to lay up for them so that they would have resources to come he was storing spiritual food he was giving them principles and directives that they could live by not just through that moment but for the rest of their lives as it says in Proverbs 13:22 this is a scripture I know that we've used quite often a good man leaveth an inheritance to his children's children it's a direct reference to grandchildren there's not a lot of places in the Bible where maybe Grand uh a grandparent is mentioned in that phrasing uh but here it speaks to a good man is one that leaves or a good man leaves an inheritance for his grandchildren and this is one that is there's a lot of depth to this but there's a he takes care and how that he leaves and what he leaves and what he lays up as a parent should lay up for his children so if he take that image this good man is laying up things for his children but he does so in a way to where his grandchildren can also benefit from it so he T his is uh can take care of his inheritance in such a way to where it's not only preserved for his children but it's expanded and I I'm going to leave to my children uh uh this this hund F this hund and then I've preserved it I've taken care of it but I've done so in a way to where my own child can take that and he can make that a h hundredfold he can double it he can triple it and so that's the the image behind this is a good man leaves an inheritance not only to his son but his son's son and he's done so in such a way toward the integrity and the honesty and the character that he's done it in and what he's imparted to his own son preserves that inheritance for the grandson so the Bible says in Proverbs 2 26 train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it mean to train up means to dedicate or inaugurate therefore there is this idea of when you train up a child you bring him to a place to where he is being he's beginning and he's introduced train up a child in the way bring him to the way that he ought to live I remember I believe his brother Tom Ray one time ministered on this subject he shared it with me I didn't have the privilege of hearing the service because you're sharing with me uh this this phrasing of train up and when it says to begin or inaugurate to train up a child in the way so you want him to begin in the way that he ought to be so the way that we deal with our Toddlers and our adolescen and our pre-teens and our teenagers is all to prepare them for that time when they begin in adulthood when they come to that place where I've been inaugurated in my position I've been inaugurated I I've come to my place where I can begin to now fulfill my destiny as a person so train him up in the way that he should go so that when he is old he has not departed as from what he ought to be he is able to remain and to develop and to flourish in his calling in Luke 6: 40 it says the disciple is not above his master but everyone that is perfect shall be as his master perfect it means to be it's to put into order it's the same word that speaks of maturity to be complete to be perfect it's arranged placed as one ought to be this is what you come to the completion or fulfillment if there's a possibility if there's a range of 1 to 10 if you could have if we ask somebody right now do you want uh 10 $100 bills uh or five and say well how many are there well there's 10 how many do you want they I want I want 10 I want it all and so if you got all of it that'd be perfect maybe not if you got all it'd be complete cuz there's no more to give you want it all like in Monopoly that's what you you want to get it all you want to take it all and so this is it says uh to be perfect as his master filled up to his master his master's teaching him not to make uh servants and to make him subject a and this uh and to make him underlings and minions but rather I want you to become like me that's the goal of the master to the one the disciple is not above his master but he becomes like his master scripture saying after he's been completely trained he will be like his teacher co-equal that's that's the that's the goal of discipleship the goal of discipleship is not to create uh people who do your bidding right and people who can do what you ask them to do but people who can do what you do completely who can come into that same image as the master ma in Matthew chapter 10: 24- 25 the disciple is not above his master nor the servant above his Lord it is enough for the disciple that he be as his master catch that and there another angle of this it is is enough for the disciple that he be as his master and the servant as his Lord if they have called The Master of the House beels above how much more shall they call them of his household so he's making the point that if they hated me before they hate you and be not surprised if the world hates you because you're not of this world and if they call me be elub then how much more are they going to call those in my family and those of the house of the Lord be elub but he's pointing out once again it is enough it is perfect for the disciple to be as his master not be greater than his master but it is the goal of discipleship to make the disciple co-equal and as or perfect as his master be therefore followers of God as deal children that you may be therefore perfect as your father which is in heaven is perfect so it is the goal of discipleship that you that the disciple or the servant become as the master or Lord and Paul writes to the Galatians in Galatians 4: 1 and 2 I say that The Heir as long as he is a child as long as he's a young and as long as he's immature as long as he has not fully grown or developed he differs nothing from a servant though he be Heir or Lord or have the right to inherit all and as long as he is a child and during this time of life where he's being seasoned out and he's growing and he's learning he's placed under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father and that time is not when he becomes Heir but when he receives his inherit inheritance he's granted full right and title to what he stood to receive all along so though a disciple is being trained to be as his master he has a role that differs than the master until the time that he comes into the very image of the master and therefore can inherit All rights responsibilities and even the image of the one that is the master or the ruler but as long as you're immature as long as you're a child there's going to be certain rights and privileges withheld from that child not that he isn't able to and not that he won't but there's a certain there's a different a time of life a different age for him until the time appointed of the father now if you'll take your Bibles and turn to 1 Timothy 5:4 it's speaking of uh he's addressing various roles within the church and within the family and he's talking about the honor that ought to be given to a widow and if I I I'll say this before we begin to read the scripture what I'm hoping that we have in our Consciousness right now is a little bit of a review of Where we've been in terms of what it means about the young 's grow up and and all those things that have been implied in that most recently in this process of growing and this orientation of the parent to the child this responsibility for a parent to raise his child with the future in mind and part of that is as a parent I have a legacy or I have I have property I have certain things that I'm going to leave to my child and so I want to prepare him for that time when it's all his and and that this is what the Bible is speaking of as long as he's a child though it's all his ultimately he can't just use it as he wants to that's why that in the parable of the prodigal son he had to ask for his inheritance at that time it had to be something that the father would Grant and what happened he gives it to him and what does he do squanders it why he's prod he's wasteful he's immature he couldn't handle it and so there is this responsibility for parents it's a responsibility of a household to train up their child so that they can inherit what is rightfully theirs it's yours now but you leave it to them and they'll be able to preserve it for their own children hand something down that you gave them to their own children and then this to me adds just another dimension to it though it's reinforcing what we've already looked at but if any widow have children or NE ref let them learn first to show piety at home and to requite their parents for that is good and acceptable before God it's interesting if any have children or nephews and you think well what about the nieces but it is a reference to you would say maybe the that primary responsibility of providing and caregiving as far as uh financial support or Aid would maybe fall on the man and it's also just the way that the Bible is written and translated but the word nephew could have just as easily been translated to grandchildren so if a widow have children or grandchildren if this widow's husband had been a good man and he had left an inheritance for her and that inheritance was also for her children and for her children's children says this is God's perfect will this is the way that it ought to operate if any widow have children or nephews let them learn first to show piety at home so there is and to requite their parents for that is good and acceptable before God that phrase good and acceptable before God according to the good pleasure of his will this is something that pleases the Lord so taking this phrasing children and grandchildren have a scriptural duty to regard or to act kindly towards their parents or grandparents if you have a a mom or dad and it's saying that you ought to show piety to them you should be act kindly towards them you should reverence them and as it's dealing with the Widow it's one whose husband is is no longer with them they have needs they have maybe they lack resources or opportunity it says let them let them first learn to show let the grandchildren and the nephews or let the children and the grandchildren learn to show respect to show honor and give reverence at home over their own household over their own parents or grandparents and to requite their parents you know what that means reparations recompense to requite their parents means to compensate them or not to say payback because that might not sound right but to return the favor that as our ch our parents for years lay up for the children and they sacrifice and they have a long range vision and they're providing they're supporting their children through great Labor and through great pains and looking out after their children that there comes a time when Lord willing the child is then able to return the favor as Peter as Jesus even told Peter when you were young you did this and you did that he says but when you're old a man another will carry you and it's this idea that there comes a point when parents aren't able maybe to continue to parent their children or look out after their children or always being the ones doing the handout but the chance the the charents the the the parents look to the children and the children become charents right where they're they're caring for their parents they're looking out after them so this is something for both parents and children to consider that when they're young and I'm looking out after them and I'm clothing them and I'm feeding them and I'm and I'm raising them up and I'm paying for this and I'm paying for that that I I might want to do it in a way where I'm not so toxic and I'm not so wasteful and I'm not so lacking in character integrity that when I get older and I really need them to show piety and I I need to lean upon them that I have a relationship and they have the resources to show kindness to me this is something for parents to consider and then also for children to consider as Paul is saying that it's better that a widow and I want to say this correctly because I do believe that we have a responsibility as Christian Chans to look out after widows we have a a responsibility to look out for things and to live for others and look upon the needs of others but Paul is saying that the it's not the church's responsibility to do that but it's the family in the church it's their responsibility to look out after the the Widow if that is in fact their mom or if it's their grandmother there's a responsibility of those who are relatives in the family of God uh to look after that one in their family so that that that those needs don't be become a burden on the church does that make sense well it doesn't sound I hope it doesn't sound dismissive of the poor or needy or the Widow as far as a church responsibility but I would say the primary responsibility for a church is to Res resource the children and nephews to properly encourage and resource and instruct the family so that given that opportunity they can show that piety and they can requite to their families so there there is a duty for these children to regard that kindly and to requite their parents this is something for children and parents to consider and so parents should care for their elderly parent children should care for grandchildren should care for their elderly parents or grandparents looking out after that and having a responsibility to that and so parents need to train them up to do that and so growing up is necessary to fulfill scriptural Duty and this adoption that we're looking at this maturity is related to these obligations and this the it's relates to the inheritance and the care for it these obligations of inheritance and these obligations of care that this process of maturing for you as an individual means I stand to receive an inheritance so therefore I have a responsibility to grow up to so I can fit in that place I can fit into that inheritance I can receive all that Christ has for me receive a full reward I need to grow up because I'm an heir I need to grow up and suffer with him and to be glorified together with him and so my inheritance means I've got to go through this process and then also I have a duty and of care over that inheritance as we look at this image of children and grandchildren providing back and showing Piet to the parents but then also preserving for their own so there's a duty of care that goes with it and what we want to focus on and we've completely run out of time ready to do this today probably but I really want to focus on how Jesus follows this pattern Jesus is an example of God's desire for young on in Hebrews chapter 2:10 for it became him for whom were all things and by whom are all things in bringing many sons under Glory this is partner with Romans chapter 8 and bringing many sons under Glory it says that if we suffer him we have to to be glorified together with him we must suffer with him so it became him this is God's will this is God's desire desire this is his will to in bringing many sons into Glory it was God's will to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings Jesus Christ is the captain of our Salvation when he was born he was born in the world as a babe laying in the mangor and that does not speak to the Perfection that the scripture is speaking of here he was made perfect through sufferings brother Bram says in in plain language the very character of Jesus was perfected by suffering so wasn't physical development it wasn't his looks it wasn't his limp it was his character that's perfected by suffering and according to Paul he has left his church a measure of suffering that they too by their faith in God while suffering for him would come to a place of perfection not a place of Salvation not a place in terms of your relationship to God but Perfection and it is it is a dynamic that exist by for one who is in relationship I believe that when we get married that we ought to have a faith that we're doing the right thing that we believe you say have a revelation of God's will know that this choice is pleasing to God and that when one uh professes their love for someone and brother jiah I'm not doing this just for you but maybe this is a I'm practicing for Friday there is this obligation that one would have to their spouse and it's not a difficult one they're in love right it's love it's like man I can't wait for this to start I can't wait for this to begin but you know one of the most outstanding characteristics of of real love is how it Seasons out and matures and sometimes when you'll notice with some couples when they have a real mature Love sometimes they giggle at the immature love and I go isn't isn't that cute all those things because sometimes you'll look at a love that's immature and it's more pining and it's more uh toxic than and and there's competition between two people than two people that really love one another and it's not always a competition to prove who loves the other person most and it's not not always questioning and always doubting but with love comes confidence and faith and the stability it's a real growing and maturing and so this place of perfection is not relationship alone but it's the dynamic of that relationship and this relationship between God and Christ is an example how that God looking at his son saw fit to make him perfect through sufferings in Hebrews chap 1: 2 and now I want you to see this pattern God has his son Jesus Christ and so as we said before this process of maturity has to do with inheritance and care it says hath in these last days spoken to us by his son God used had in past spoke by prophets today in this time as this letter is being written he has spoken to us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of All Things by whom also he made the world Christ was appointed heir of all and this inheritance catch this I put it this way this inheritance was rece received or granted not that he was made Heir in other words he stood to receive it he was appointed heir of all things but then it's granted he takes possession after he suffered after he obeyed in Psalms 1:1 it says the Lord said unto my Lord the Lord said unto my Lord this is God speaking to the son sit thou at my right hand until I make thine enemies thy foot stool we understand that this position to sit sit down my right hand he's ascended up on high at the right hand of the father this takes place after his death burial and Resurrection this takes place after his suffering and we know according to Revelations 3:21 that he has overcome it's granted because he overcame and so the father tells the son sit thou at my right hand you have overcome sit thou at my right hand and he says I'll Grant to you to sit with me in my Throne I'm going to Grant something to you not the promise of it but you're actually going to do it in full reality full realization of the promise when you overcome amen and so this is something that he is destined to then he suffers he obeys he lives it out and then he receives it in Isaiah 53: 10 to12 my there was some really beautiful things in Ezekiel and different places I was reading about and I realized I'm probably going to get in the Weeds on that so I want to stay very very focused so that this is um as sometimes it said you know that I covered a lot of ground and what they mean is I just stayed stayed in the same spot just drilled straight down so that's probably what we're doing today Isaiah 5310 to12 yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him he's the son he's the Messiah but yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him Heath put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand now Quite A Prophecy of the Messiah that all the RAB beins missed all the teachers all the Masters missed Peter even rebuffed the idea that the Messiah Christ would have to suffer and die but because he'll make his soul an offering for sin he's going to see his seed those destined predestinated he going to prolong his days that it would not even end and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper his hand he shall see of the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied God will be satisfied to see the travail of his soul by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities now that to me just summarizes the sacrificial aspect of Christ's first mission Christ call the reason why the son came to Earth he comes as a babe wrapped in swallowing clothes born in a manger increase in wisdom and knowledge and stature with go and favor with God and man he comes to a place as we'll uh uh reference here in just a little bit where he is called to be he's destined to be a sacrifice but he's also destined to be the heir of all things and the law required Perfection for both he had to be a perfect sacrifice so there was a process he had to go through in order to be though he could be without blemish even if you looked at the hepher and the different SS they could be perfect but there had to be a way the washing and the ceremony that went with it it's all testifying what God wants to do in the house of the Lord what he wants to do for you and so this these scriptures are prophesying how that Christ would come the Messiah the one who is going to hand is going to be prospered he's going to be uh the the heir of all things he's going to also be a sacrifice and in suffering and travailing and becoming a sacrifice it's going to please the Lord and God is going to be sa satisfied so verse 12 says therefore will I divide him a portion with the great and he shall divide the spoil with the strong because Heath poured out his soul unto death this is showing us that it's in this process of him suffering and dying that God says therefore I'm going to Grant and to give him his inheritance the phrase I will divide him a portion with the speaks directly to giving the inheritance to the son and then he also divides the spoil with the strong there is your joint HS of go with Christ and that Christ is going to then share and divide the spoil with those who also overcome I have overcome I have prevailed and sat down in my father's throne and according to Isaiah 53:12 I will therefore divide the throne with you also you will be able to sit with me in my Throne also because I have been obedient because I poured out my soul into death says in Matthew 28: 161 17 and 18 then the 11 disciples went away into Galilee this is after his uh death burial and Resurrection before his Ascension into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them and when they saw him they worshiped him but some doubted and Jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in Earth amen he could say this with this absolute assurance before he ascends up as we see it in Luke and in Acts chapter 1 before he ascends up we can see very plainly that Christ is saying I have conquered all all power is given unto me in heaven and earth in Revelations 11:15 and the seventh angel sounded and there were great voices in heaven saying the kingdoms of this world to become the kingdoms of our God and of his Christ and he shall reign forever and ever not just a thousand year reign it's not just a a moment of time but the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ and he shall reign forever and ever this is something I want to emphasize this this is something that Christ obtained through obedience being a son he was made perfect it says in bringing many sons to share in the spoil and being able to receive the inheritance of that Throne he was made perfect through sufferings his character was perfected through suffering therefore God wants to bring the strong through suffering so that they too can also come to the same place of perfection because Christ has been appointed heir of all things he's going to be granted to sit at the right hand and he wants to also share in that power with you so he's left a process so that you too can enjoy the spoils am of the son where in all power is get unto me in heaven and earth and the world and kingdoms of this world have become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ and he shall reign forever and ever and he's going to share that power with you am this is something he obtained in Hebrews 1:4 it's already said he has been appointed air of all things in verse two being made so much better than the angels as Heath by inheritance obtained a more excellent Name than they how did do it by inheritance he obtained it even Hebrews goes to Great Links to say that the testator can make all sorts of promises but it requires a death in order for it to be conveyed and Christ was promised many things but there was this Covenant that he had to fulfill in order for it to come to pass and be realized Jesus Christ as God's only begotten son had to grow up I know that's self- serving but had to grow up to the throne he had to go from a Manger Throne to a throne it was something he had to suffer it wasn't just given to him he didn't just say well bless God I'm the Son of God this is mine I have a right to it because he had the right image of God Satan thought it was something he could take right he thought he could steal it Jesus knew it wasn't something you could steal Satan thought he could take it maybe by right because he was co-equal Matthew 4: 8-9 if you recall there was great time spent on this already this year in these things I think I can just make reference to this temptation in the wilderness again the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them amen what amazing symmetry with Matthew chapter 28 when he takes his disciples into a mountain where he's appointed them and there on the top of that mountain he says all power is given unto me in heaven and Earth but there a few years before the devil had Tak him to an exceeding high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in the glory of them he had only shown him a half all the kingdoms of the world and all the glory of them he said unto him all these things will I give thee if that will fall down and worship me I'd like to put it this way Satan offered him a shortcut right Satan offered him a shortcut to by bypass God's requirement of perfection and it wasn't that Satan was making a bluff or an empty offer he said I will give it all to you cuz I got it just by telling a lie right I got it by deceit I got it by trickery I got it by provoking lust and and sensation and I can give it to you if you will just merely worship me the smallest task the smallest ask and what he was offering to Jesus Jesus was all the kingdoms of this world through a shortcut I'll give it all to you and the glory of them if you'll just worship me and he thought what he had so easily taken he could also Grant but Jesus in that moment rebukes him and stays with the word what was he doing he was proving to be the right kind of a son in Hebrews chap 5: 8 and9 though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect this it's this increase he learned he increased in knowledge he learned by practice he was being informed and here he is in in in Matthew chapter 4 coming to this place of Temptation and he's suffering and he's rejecting and being made perfect he became the author of Eternal salvation unto all them that obey him Christ was offered kingdoms of this world through Satan's plan Satan's plan is always a shortcut it's kind of that nature to follow the path of least resistance when the believer is typically going the opposite way in Philippians chapter 2: 5-1 11 so you could see this on this uh this scale let this mind be in you which was also in Christ who been in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God there's some form there's some image there's some likeness uh that we have there's something we possess inherently by a birth but the equality to God Jesus did not regard as being something easily grasped he did not regard it as something he could just take when he was offered all the kingdoms of this world Satan had an image of what God could be and how that he can now Grant to Christ the very things that God had promised to give Christ he's trying to operate in this image in Christ recognizes immediately this isn't how a father treats a son I know I tell my children all the time do what I say and you can have whatever you want hasn't worked but I feel that way and maybe if I was a a better father a more perfect father what I'm asking them to do would be more instinctively right for them to respond to but it's kind of that principle that where where there's H uh that you want to give your children something and here Satan's got this lack of character just worship me just cater to my ego just make me look good kind of what Saul was saying hey go worship with me let's make a lot of pretense in the meeting so that everybody thinks that I'm still cool with you uh Samuel and and Satan says worship me and act that without any real literal consequence it's not going to make Satan anything else other than what he is Satan and he said and I'll give you all the kingdoms of this world and Jesus recognizes in the moment that's not the real heart of a father that's not that's not character that's that's not the way God works that's not the way the father operates am because he had to learn he had to grow he knew thought it not rob to be equal with God but yet Satan being co-equal except the fact that he could create tried to rob from God what he had but made himself of no reputation took upon him the form of a servant and made and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself notice and became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross look at that at the very end of verse eight this is what Christ does he comes a as the Son of God and he becomes Obed obedient unto death he humbles himself he's in the form of a servant he's in the form of a son he's in the form of a young he's in the form in relationship to the father as a master what does he do he's now been made subject and he obeys he obeys he becomes obedient unto death even the death of the Cross it's Isaiah 53 he yielded himself to the father's will he yielded himself to what is calling was he yielded himself to be what God wanted him to be in that moment in that time even unto death and then what does verse 9 say wherefore therefore and because of that thus as a result or consequently God also hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow and of things in heaven and things in Earth and things under Earth and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father this equality with God was not something easily grasped it was not something something stolen it was not just something he could just take or something he could demand a right to of some sort of entitlement but he became obedient as a servant not only to man but ultimately to God and being in that fashion in that form he became obedient unto death and God the scripture saying because he did that he was exalted above everything else and given a name above everything that the name of Jesus every name should bow until that time until Christ had done that the name Joshua the name Jehovah savior the name Jesus would not have invoked this type of worship but now that he has obeyed it is necessary that we give him honor and praise that is why there's stones and rocks will cry out and every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the father now we've covered this just on a small scale through a number of statements before bringing it directly from Brother bram's teaching that this law of adoption makes a son of equal with the father here he he thought it not robbery to be equal with God it means that once a child is once a child is trained brought up tested proved then he can have all the father's power doesn't mean the son doesn't have authority sometimes there's this conflation of well uh if I if I'm not an adopted son then I I I can't do anything I I can't overcome I can't pray for the sick no there that's just a a misre in a police officer doesn't have power what does he have authority so what do you have power in the name of Jesus Christ well as one who has been commissioned as one who's been sent as one that has been told and the one who has been given the commission from Christ from God you've been commissioned so you can operate in the power that he has given you as a son and daughter of God brother bam said he's written he signed the check you just need to cash it is that not true so there's rights and privileges and powers and responsibilities that we all have as children the devil can't take those away from us but this Coe equality makes the son's name on the check just as good as his daddy's and Jesus Christ demonstrates this pattern of how babes grow to mature Believers and in Matthew chap 3: 13-1 17 then cometh Jesus From Galilee to Jordan under John to be baptized of him notice just how early in the reading of the New Testament we find is last time we've seen him is at the age of 12 after he's increased in wisdom and favor with God he's coming at this age of 30 years old to be baptized by John why it has to happen but John forbade him saying I have need to be baptized to thee and comest thou to me and Jesus answered suffer it to be so now for it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness I know you may it's not that you're wrong that you have need to be baptized of me because I I'm going to baptize with fire I'm going to do something that's going to revolutionize the relationship of mankind to God but before that can happen we have to fulfill all we have to fulfill all righteousness as the sacrificial lamb I need to be washed then he suffered him and Jesus when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water and lo the heavens were opened up open unto him and he saw the spirit of God descending like a dove enlightning upon him what was happening Heaven and Earth kissed the father comes now in a special uh outpouring a special Union and low of voice from Heaven saying this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased and how did Brother bam over and over and over again open up that scripture in whom I'm well pleased too dwell that there was there was this now this identification of the father with him this glorification I have glorified it he says and I will glorify it again and in this very moment of his baptism God identifies him self with his son as the Spirit came to dwell in Jesus Christ and that Holy Spirit comes that Dove lighting down upon him as a dove and in that moment maybe for some brother said that's when the word was made flesh and said oh then Jesus wasn't Jesus wasn't Divine before well whose son was he he was always a son he always the child of God he was always deity it wasn't Mary's blood it wasn't Joseph's blood it wasn't a mix of either of those Bloods it wasn't human blood it was the blood of God so he has a relationship to God as a son even before this momentous and even in some ways paradoxical occasion on the Jordan River where this great uh Supernatural event happens and there's this union now in a supernatural way between the Flesh of Jesus Christ and him as a son and him as a person and the Very power and logos and the word of God there's this unifying moment that takes place Jesus was always the Son of God he was always the seed of God he was always deity but it's then at that moment that the father come to dwell in him and we follow the same pattern in Galatians 4:6 he says and because you are Sons God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying ABA father and those you were always a seed that's you always were a seed but you needed quickening and immediately it says in Matthew 4:1 then was Jesus led up of the spirit Into the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil so now having this experience of being glorified by the father this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased notice this phrasing this speaking I'm pleased to dwell in him this is my beloved Son this is after the good pleasure of my will that I would dwell in him for this time for this season for this moment this is my good pleasure and immediately he's LED of the spirit Into the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil without having to go back over all these scriptures not only could we start with this point in Matthew 4 but we could continue throughout his entire Ministry and see that that he always stayed faithful to the father's word not his own will not my will be done but thy will be done not to his flesh but he was faithful to the kingdom and I say one of the greatest indicators In the Flesh of of maturing and growing up is obedience it's one of those single most outstanding characteristics of somebody who's grown up is when they obey one of the single the I said single And I was going to give two but the two most outstanding characteristics of one who's immature is stubbornness and Rebellion it's those trademarks that don't say that well he's stubborn he's rebellious he's not my son like we think that's the that's the original 23 in me well you know Jack's not doing what I asked him to do he he can't be my son right that ain't it which means he's he'd be stubborn Jack's like you you know he takes care of me every morning comes opens the blinds for me makees sure I have my drink in the morning carries my bag and my coat after every single service and I always say man you make me feel like a a very important person so he always takes it and says don't say you're a very important person so this isn't about Jack this is about Rowan now honestly think about it stubbornness Rebellion mistakes failures doesn't change your sunship but it it's indicative of one's character one's maturity and so it's greatest indicator that you see one growing up and maturing is obedience and you one of the marks not so one as one obeys that's a mark of them growing up you want to know what the mark of a one who is mature is precision when you ask it when they they know that they must do something they don't just do it halfway they don't just address it they just don't it's just not quick but they're precise words they know how it needs to be done so the other day and I don't know if I mentioned this before but Jack was want needing to do something I I and I said well I said yeah just use this just set it up that way and and I said you can you can do it and he said Dad how do I know how to do it if you never showed me how to do it yes son in other words and then if you show them how to do it then they will try to do it they say okay could you do this for me and they go and do it and then once they when they're mature it's when they do it exactly the way it's supposed to be done the Precision of it to know how to do something to know how it should be done to know the will to know the image to know the purpose these are the marks of maturity the Bible says in Romans 8:14 for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God so Jesus Christ now as the father comes to dwell the the dove the spirit of God descending like a dove lights upon him the voice says this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased to dwell he the Son of God Jesus Christ receiving this great baptism in indwelling of the father because you are Sons God sends forth the spirit into your hearts immediately Jesus has led of the spirit Into the Wilderness to be tempted and as many as are the sons of God they are led by the spirit of God and brother brandham said and hear ye him which is his consistent adoption teaching but God made you a son to give you a trial we think okay to see how you're going to act with it character conduct Behavior why did God allow Jesus to be immediately tempted of the devil it's showing us this pattern brother B said as soon as you get the Holy Ghost you set yourself up as a Target to be tempted of the devil this is exactly what happens for every True Believer that there's going to be this time H uh where the Devil Comes yes a great experience in the Lord a great outpouring a great move of God but there's going to come a season where the spirit of God is going to lead you into the Wilderness and you're going to be tested you're going to be tempted you're going to be tried you're going to be given a trial cuz God wants to bring out who you really are he going to see how you're going to act with it in John 8: 26- 29 Jesus says this this is to get the character of the son I have many things to say and to judge of you but he that sent me is true and I speak to the world those things which I've heard of him I'm just saying what he told me to say that's the mark of a a maturing son and I'm going to be very precise that's the mark of maturity they understood not that he spake to them of of the father then said Jesus unto them when you have lifted up the son of man then shall you know that I am he and that I do nothing of myself but as my father hath taught me I speak these things he says in one place I have power to lay down my life I have power to raise it up again he says this have I received of my father he claimed no power of his own until he had been resurrected and had went and entered into heaven and presented himself as a the sacrifice and come back down to earth to reinforce the commission to the disciples he says now oh power in Heaven and Earth is given unto me and I do nothing of myself but my father taught me I speak these things and he that sent me is with me the father hath not left me alone for I do always those things that please him this is this relationship and dynamic that existed between the father and the son Jesus did only that which pleased God he kept his word he manifested his word he says in John chapter 5 then answered Jesus and said to them verily verily I say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do for what things soever he doeth those also doeth the son likewise this is harmony this is obedience this is maturity this is what pleases the father this is the template that brother bram's even pointing to that the character of Jesus was perfected by suffering and so God has left us a measure a process of character development that we too by our faith in God and suffering according to his will would come to the same place of establishment the same place of maturity the same place of Perfection you don't have to suffer to be bride but the bride suffers to be the Masterpiece she suffers to become into his Perfect Image so Jesus comes to his Transfiguration he prayed I've glorified it I'll glorify it again this is what the Lord speaks we read about it Matthew chapter uh 17 I want to read it in Mark chapter 9 it just brings it together in one chapter uh I may be questioning my reasons for doing it right now uh just in that the main difference I wanted to bring out is how in Matthew chapter 17 he says this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased so remember that and notice how that fits perfectly with mat Matthew 3 this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased so it's pronounced then you're my son and he pronounces it again and watch what he says and I say unto them verily I say unto you that there be some them some of them that stand here which shall not taste of death till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power brother has a lot of great things to say about this and after six days Jesus taketh him him with him Peter and James and John and leadth them up into a high mountain apart by themselves and he was transfigured before them this this glorification this Transfiguration and his reignment became shining exceeding white as snow so as no Fuller on Earth can white them and there appeared unto them Elijah with Moses and they were talking with Jesus and Peter answered and said to Jesus now there's so much symbolism representing in these first few verses so many types so many Shadows so many connections to Revelations 10 so many different connections to his the revealer of the son of man the manifestation of the god in this last time and great symmetry with the high mountain all these different beautiful things are in there but now Peter sees this and and he says unto Jesus Master it is good for us to be here let us make three Tabernacles one for the and one for Moses and one for Elias and there was something though sincere but clearly misguided by this and so it's it seems to me that I think if Peter was writing this this wouldn't be on the record but others were happy to make sure Peter's little faux paw here it was recorded in the record because the god immediately answers to the Moses and Elijah and Jesus and this setting forth of these three as if this would be complete and this would be perfect he says for he wish not what to say for they were so afraid so there kind of Matthew shown a little bit Grace for Peter he didn't know what to say he got nervous right you know how sometimes you're just nervous and you say things this is what happened to pet let's build three churches and verse 7 and there was a cloud that overshadowed them and a voice out of the cloud saying this is my beloved Son but what does he say now hear him this is my beloved Son hear ye him says in Matthew 17 this is my beloved Son and whom I'm well pleased hear ye him Moses Elijah Christ and he says now in this moment let us build three Tabernacles let us do this let us do that he says no no there's only one at this Transfiguration at this foreshadowing after this preview he takes him to this place and he says this is my beloved Son in times past I spake by the prophets in times past I spake through other vessels but now my brother man said this is my son he speaks for me what he says is as good as my word he had he had obeyed the father in Everything Jesus said something he said I'm only saying what the father told me to say this happened I'm only doing what the father told me to do there was this operation this harmony that existed between the father and son where God knew whatever he revealed to him that's what Jesus would do whatever God told Jesus to do that's exactly what Jesus would do and now God got to the point to where he is me he's one we got this harmony we got this Unity there's this full submission hit what he says is exactly what I would have said what he does is exactly what I would have done and God commits all judgment power and authority to his son brother brandham teaches very he never waffles on this he never Ventures from this this Mount Transfiguration was the adoption of Jesus Christ after after Matthew chapter 3 it's not two baptisms of the Holy Ghost and I I'm not trying to get caught up in numerology it's just what happened brother brandham said what watch what God did when his son was born he let him go 30 years testing him trying him then he gave him three years of hard trial and then at the end of the hard trial when he was seen that his son was about the father's business brother man says Mount Transfiguration he took Peter James and John three Witnesses and went up on a top mountain and there God performed the laws of adoption this is what God did watch what God did to his son he's born he goes 30 years he's tested he's tried and he gives him three years of hard trial and then at the end of that trial he says God performed the laws of adoption what was it that brought him there suffering process of of character development growth and maturity is what brought Christ to this place brother BR makes a a remarkable statement about what God witnessed on Mount Sunset said he witnessed the same thing on Mount Transfiguration but what brought brother Brown to mount Sunset we're all thinking afford and then in a hike right loss hard trial God tells him to go to the Pentecostals what he do he listens to his mother-in-law what did he do he lost a lot he God shows him a vision because he's afraid to hurt a man's feelings what did he do he didn't follow in it suffered he suffered because there was going to come a time when God was going to show him a vision and he was going to have to do it and he couldn't run from it he had to be there brother Bram said Jesus had proved to God that he had been the right kind of son brother says in another place God was doing here just exactly what he asked man to do his son had been obedient he had minded the father he hadn't been gten about in place and say you see who I am my campaign's the biggest there is in the country yes sir he'd been obedient he'd been obedient to the father he hadn't been gathering around the things of the world associate with him he'd been obedient he hits at the religious attitude and the sinful rebellious attitude the stubbornness and the Rebellion he hits it both of them he said he hadn't been out there trying to make a name for himself out there in the in the meetings the biggest name in the country and he hadn't been gting out with the world in associal with he says he had been obedient Jesus had been obedient and it's through his obedience that he had been brought to this place of perfection and God performed the laws of adoption brother brandham says a family when a son is born into it it's a son then but that son had tutors to raise it and if that son never did come to be the right kind of a son he never became heir quite a statement still a son when he says he doesn't become an heir it implies the receipt of the property The Possession to have full power and authority over it says but if he was the right son and the son that would obey his father then that son was adopted or placed positionally he became heir of what the father had and that's what God was doing on Mount Transfiguration when he took his own son after he had been proven to be the right son and had stood all Temptations He took him up on amount Transfiguration and overshadowed him it says in another place but once adopted positionally placed in the body of Christ you're an heir of all things notice that's what God did to his son God didn't ask us to do anything that he would not do he took his own son who had been obedient and a voice said this is my beloved Son hear ye him whatever he says is just as good as my word he was adopted Jesus said all powers in Heaven and Earth is given into my hands there's the adoption of God adopting his son that's why we have Matthew 28:18 it's at that time he says all power is given un me in heaven and Earth but he says during his days on Earth and during his ministry I don't judge any man right I I I I I just come to save I'm not judging I I didn't come even he he even doesn't even read he opens up and he's going to read a verse that applies to him but not at that moment he stops reading it why CU he didn't want to get he didn't want there to be any confusion I I'm not going to give any pretense here I I I I'm going to stay right faithful to my calling brother brandham said in the position of the believer in Christ said this is my beloved Son hear ye him this is on Mount Transfiguration this is the climax this is at the peak this is a high mountain depart brother says fulfilling every law that the Old Testament required the law of inheritance required this character in the Sun and and God there and and this is I I think Lord will maybe we'll get to this on Sunday where is this law of adoption in the Old Testament anybody ever tried to find it anybody ever found it but it fulfilled every law in the Old Testament maybe I'll just uh create some anticipation for Wednesday we'll find it in the Old Testament Jesus Christ expressed the plan of perfection for all of God's children closing musicians you can come to your instruments this is God's perfect will to bring you from seed to Perfection we can look at scriptures where Christ is the root we can look at scriptures say we've begun in the spirit we can see that he's the author he's the beginner he's the foundation and this placing in the body of Christ this beginning in the spirit Christ being the foundation this is so for the body of Christ this is so through the church ages this is so in the history of the collective Body of Christ and it's also so for the individual as the Holy Spirit has built up his church and brother it's growed from the toes and the feet all the way up now to the intelligence the individual has done the same thing when you were born you were not born when you were born when you were figure that one out here's a riddle when you were born again I was going to say you weren't born a fully grown mature child of God the Bible says you're a babe but said you're not born men you're born babies you grow to adulthood you grow to manhood that's the seasoning out that's the maturing that's this process of character development this is how youngans are to grow up just as we are born in the natural when you're born in the natural you were not born a fully grown fully developed far as physical emotional and intellectual it's not fully developed but all the power and potentials there and just as one by seed by Nature they have potential and it is the nurturing of that seed that makes it come in the natural that makes it come to whatever it can be we know even the natural the kind of nurture that you give the seed can change the expression brother I'm talking about the corn stock something leans up against it it grows the wrong way still a corn still grew it just didn't grow up the right way and as we see those things in nature and we see that in our own lives as humans God that's all pattern what God is going to do for us as believers wants us to grow and Paul writes to the Galatians before he gets more into detail in Galatians chapter 4 he's setting up this this principle in chapter 3: 1 to4 oh foolish Galatians who have Bewitched you that you should not obey the truth before whose eyes Jesus Christ had been evidently set forth crucified among you there's a foolishness there's an immaturity right this isn't this isn't what I would expect from you he says it to the Hebrews he says it to the Corinthians this only would I learn of you this is what I want you to answer received ye the Spirit by The Works of the law or by the hearing of Faith what was it by hearing the word by faith are you so foolish having begun in the spirit are you now made perfect by the flesh now there's no way we take away from this to say oh so I don't need to be made perfectly said no having begun in the spirit and having begun in the spirit is the spirit that will perfect you don't go back to bondage again don't go back to the weak and beggarly elements of the flesh don't go back to religious tradition don't go back to the world don't go back to thinking whatever you do is going to make you perfect but the holy spirit that God gave you and you receive the Spirit by the hearing of the word then it's going to be by that that you are made perfect and then he says have you suffered so many things in vain if it be yet in vain now why does he mention the vanity of their suffering what is suffering for what is suffering the process of character development the holy spirit in you is to tutor you to teach you to guide you to cause you to grow up now I'll say this to us as individuals why is it so important to me as would it be important to you as a young man so that you can you can learn Integrity you can make the right decisions you can begin to be responsible because God wants you to bring a a a a woman a spouse into this relationship and then you begin to grow together and love together then you're going to have children if the Lord will T there's a process that he wants to unfold in your life so he's in you right now through teaching and and testing and and preserving and all sorts of and it's happening for all of us as Sons and Daughters of God in what we experience and what we go through he's saying would you are you going to suffer but then not inherit right Paul said I keep under my body less when I have benefited others and preached the gospel I would be a cast away I wouldn't receive my reward our conduct will keep us from a reward and just as you couldn't work your way into Faith could work your way into salvation I know I'm going to maybe someone might throw a tomato at me but you can't work your way out of it either I just say that's just how much he loves you that's just how much he loves you that's just how much he bought you that's just it's like he paid the price and the devil thinks oh I'll just make him do this and God says wait a minute read the fine print that was included that was included right all it's all included amen and so God then is committed to this process what he began he will finish and God is building up his Dwelling Place he's building up the house of the Lord which you are and there are no shortcuts there are no deals with the devil there is no Perfection by flesh it is by his word by the proper emphasis by the proper objective we should be prayed in our lives as Believers wherever we are that I want to be more obedient and that's a mark of growing up being obedient what was it Saul said oh sacrifice wasn't that great and Sam's like well God wants obedience that's what he's looking for as children we can become as youngans right we can become enamored with the flashy the Optics and and certain things and those things are fine but God wants obedience and if this is done at the expense of obedience God's saying no that's not it sorry that's not it so sometimes he ask us to do a hard thing just to see how you're going to act no shortcuts in this no deals with the devil no perfecting by flesh brother Bram says not theology run overs and overnights but God will place in the church as God has chosen as the Holy Ghost has tuted his church and raised it up and in there God will adopt into the position his sons they're already his sons but whether they're worthy of the position that he has for them if you'll notice in perfect type God did his own son the same way God spake out this is my beloved Son hear ye him God adopted his own child into the family hear me no longer but this is my son who takes over from here on he says the adoption is near the time in parable of the church it's time for that in Parable these things were done as an example he says in Parable we can look back and see by analogy or by allegory what God's done in the church ages what's God done in the Old Testament go what God did literally in Christ and he says now we can't say specifically that God's going to do to the church exactly specifically what he did to Jesus because that's one man it's one Lord that's the son that's Jesus Christ but he saying what God did to his son it's in Parable in type it's time for the church to come to the same place the time to fulfill all righteousness the time to fulfill the time of the consummation the kind time to satisfy the purpose amen that's the time that we're living in that's why Paul when he says about adoption he says to it the Redemption of the body because they realize in this process and in this unfolding there's more to it there's more to be enjoyed there's more to partake in and so this great example of Jesus Christ what we wanted you to see today is that Jesus Christ gives the pattern of God's desire for all his children and when we say to be like Jesus and I want to live like Jesus I Want to Love Like Jesus you got to realize that it's it's a it's a mouthful but I believe that Sons and Daughters of God are led by the spirit of God and if I can say this I know I've said it here before the worst thing you could take away from a son or daughter of God is the leadership of the holy spirit for God to lead them in all Truth for God to lead them into all righteousness for God to speak to them his will and they obey but when we try to come up with the rules and regulations and how it ought to be done and this is the way that it ought to look like and this is what you ought to do and listen to me and you take that away then you make them to feel like bastards CU you've alienated from the very thing that reminds them and bears witness with them that they are children of God God help us to be more in tune to the Holy Spirit let's stand together let's pray together this morning brother Michael if you could be ready
