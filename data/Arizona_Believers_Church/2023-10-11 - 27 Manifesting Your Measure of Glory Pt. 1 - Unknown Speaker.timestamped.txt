[0:00] my title tonight is manifesting your
[0:03] measure of Glory I wrestled with just
[0:05] exactly how to title this because
[0:07] there's different channels I could take
[0:09] different directions I'm wanting to go u
[0:11] a lot that sets before me that I'm
[0:12] hoping I'm able to get to and as long as
[0:15] the Lord can kind of Quicken it it can
[0:16] be edifying to us I certainly desire
[0:18] that in ministering that whatever is
[0:20] ministered it would bring to you some
[0:21] knowledge and understanding of the word
[0:22] of God I feel that whether it be
[0:24] teaching or if it be uh preaching and
[0:26] inspired if it comes from the word of
[0:28] God it's applicable it's appropriate it
[0:30] may fit one person one way fit another
[0:32] person another but as long as it's
[0:34] coming from the word of God if it
[0:36] teaches us a principle in the scripture
[0:38] if it strikes something in our lives to
[0:40] wash us or to cleanse us it's beneficial
[0:42] and so we want to Avail ourselves to the
[0:44] word and I desire above all that in
[0:46] knowledge and understanding and teaching
[0:48] or preaching however it be that it could
[0:50] become practical that we can find where
[0:52] we can make make sense of it in our
[0:54] everyday lives and I thought just this
[0:56] title kind of quickened me later in the
[0:58] afternoon manifesting your your measure
[1:00] of Glory I was going to say my measure
[1:02] of Glory but if anybody just took that
[1:04] as meaning me um I wouldn't want that to
[1:07] take place so I'm speaking to you
[1:08] tonight about manifesting your measure
[1:11] of Glory now I'm just going to jump
[1:14] right into where we were on Sunday in
[1:15] Revelations CH
[1:17] 21:22 we were looking at how that John
[1:20] noticed certain things that were no more
[1:22] and we use the example of there being no
[1:24] more sea to show that there was some
[1:26] type that the sea represented and its
[1:28] absence would speak of Eternal peace and
[1:30] tranquility and Harmony and we began to
[1:33] take note of other things that were no
[1:35] more and one of those things is he said
[1:37] I saw no Temple therein this is in that
[1:40] new city in the New Jerusalem for the
[1:42] Lord God Almighty and the lamb are the
[1:45] Temple of it now what we could say
[1:48] drawing on what we were speaking about
[1:49] in no more Shadows is that the city had
[1:52] no need of the temple because the temple
[1:54] had served its purpose that the temple
[1:57] was kind of a signpost the temple was
[1:59] structured in such a way or it was a
[2:00] pattern of something and being patterned
[2:02] after something once what it was
[2:04] patterned after came then you say well
[2:06] that's that's the real deal if there was
[2:09] a beta or a prototype I got to speak a
[2:11] language that some of us understand I we
[2:13] say well that's great that's wonderful
[2:15] this is a great sandbox but once you
[2:16] roll out the real thing you want the
[2:18] real thing you don't want to go back to
[2:20] the things that are buggy and the things
[2:21] that aren't complete and the thing that
[2:23] was just kind of a prototype showing you
[2:25] what was to come uh you want what it was
[2:27] foreshadowing of what it was
[2:29] representing and so the temple is no
[2:31] longer because the Lord God Almighty and
[2:33] the lamb are the Temple of it showing
[2:36] that the temple was only forecasting or
[2:39] foreshadowing this
[2:41] Arrangement now in Colossians chapter
[2:43] 2:17 and we're picking up a lot that
[2:45] Paul has already said about these things
[2:47] he says which are shadow of things to
[2:49] come the feast the sacrifices the
[2:52] priesthood the temple I'm bringing a lot
[2:53] into that view he said they are a shadow
[2:56] of things to come it's the silhouette
[3:00] the light shining upon an object cast a
[3:02] shadow it's two-dimensional it's not the
[3:04] object itself but it's some sketch of it
[3:07] it's some outline of it you could kind
[3:09] of gather something from the fact uh
[3:11] that there is an outline being presented
[3:13] say well that's not the thing but this
[3:17] tells us a little bit about the thing
[3:19] and then he says which are a shadow of
[3:21] things to come but the body is of Christ
[3:25] and when he says the body it's not so
[3:27] much the body of Christ but he's saying
[3:29] that the shadow of the temple and the
[3:31] sacrifices and and the priesthood it the
[3:35] the embodiment of it is Christ so this
[3:37] was the light was shining on Christ I
[3:39] think this is just a beautiful picture
[3:41] the light is shining on Christ and
[3:42] through the Old Testament it produces
[3:44] the shadow of the Tabernacle the temple
[3:47] the sacrifices the priesthood uh um all
[3:50] all the orders of the what we would see
[3:52] the types of justification
[3:54] sanctification the holy of holies now in
[3:56] crisis it was only there in the Old
[3:58] Testament CU light from the kind of
[4:00] Glory was shining on Christ and it was
[4:03] broadcasting this on the earth not full
[4:05] dimensional not full realization but in
[4:07] Christ the body is Christ so the old
[4:11] Temple was a historical reality that God
[4:14] had ordained to foreshadow Christ it's
[4:17] pointing to Christ we see this in the
[4:18] scripture pointing to Christ pointing to
[4:20] Christ so that that was part of that
[4:21] thought of no more shadows and so the
[4:24] original Temple was a shadow of things
[4:26] to come it was a shadow on the earth and
[4:29] that Shadow was created by the scripture
[4:31] says the body and catch this part this
[4:34] part really is a lot because I'm wanting
[4:36] to use that theme of the body this the
[4:40] the the temple was the shadow but it was
[4:42] the shadow was created by the body and
[4:44] when he says here which are Shadow
[4:46] things that come but the body is of
[4:47] Christ the body is that which cast a
[4:50] shadow as distinguished from the shadow
[4:53] itself that shouldn't be hard I think
[4:55] for all of us to grasp the body cast a
[4:58] shadow so when he says but the bodies of
[5:00] Christ he's just using normal human
[5:02] languages for us to understand oh I know
[5:04] what it's like to see my shadow I know
[5:06] what it's like to see the shadow of a
[5:08] body but now the body the thing very
[5:11] thing that was caused in the shadow is
[5:13] Christ so the body is that which it not
[5:15] that which cast The Shadow or is the
[5:18] shadow but that which cast The Shadow
[5:21] amen so we can see the shadow of
[5:22] something but I want what's cast in The
[5:25] Shadow and if this got a little bit
[5:27] confusing on Sunday I've said that we
[5:29] want to know what's cast in The Shadow
[5:32] right because we want to know whether or
[5:34] not the what the light is shining on is
[5:36] what we want what we are what is the
[5:39] real or it's exposing the false that's
[5:42] causing all the
[5:43] Spooks so there's a lot there that we
[5:45] could use in different ways and we
[5:47] touched on this and I think this is our
[5:49] we're kind of backing up to take this
[5:51] exit a little bit in First Kings chapter
[5:53] 8: 10 and 11 speaking now of the actual
[5:58] Temple and and it came to pass when the
[6:00] priests were come out of the Holy place
[6:02] that the cloud filled the house of the
[6:03] Lord so that the priest could not stand
[6:06] to minister because of the cloud for the
[6:08] glory of the Lord had filled the house
[6:11] of the Lord when it speaks of the house
[6:13] of the Lord we do not find that any
[6:16] there is no Tabernacle in heaven that is
[6:18] called the house of the Lord but God was
[6:20] always working his way towards flesh and
[6:23] this house that would be built for him
[6:25] this body that would be prepared for him
[6:26] would not be in heaven but would be on
[6:29] earth
[6:30] and so whether it be the Tabernacle in
[6:31] the wilderness or now the very Temple
[6:33] that Solomon built it's called the house
[6:35] of the Lord so it's speaking of some
[6:36] sort of habitation you want to come find
[6:38] God you want to pray to God this is a
[6:39] place you could direct your attention
[6:41] you know that God dwelt there and it
[6:43] says a cloud filled the house and the
[6:45] priests were not able to minister
[6:47] because the glory of the Lord had filled
[6:49] the house of the Lord I'm wanting you to
[6:51] see this aspect this was
[6:53] foreshadowing the glory of God that
[6:56] would be in Christ it was kind of
[6:58] forecast it was the shadow of what God
[7:01] would do in his Temple that body which
[7:03] was prepared and God that Christ was
[7:05] that ordained body for God to Tabernacle
[7:08] himself in
[7:10] and I I I I'll go ahead and use this
[7:13] scripture in Matthew chapter 16 on into
[7:15] chapter 17 you can also find this in
[7:17] Mark chapter 9 this really uh scratches
[7:22] my theological itch to use the the the
[7:26] Transfiguration so there's a part of me
[7:28] that would just uh want to cabbage down
[7:30] on this for a while because brother bam
[7:31] called this the rehearsal of the Rapture
[7:33] of the coming of the Lord and as it says
[7:36] in Mark chapter 9 that these would see
[7:39] the kingdom of God come in power so I
[7:42] want you to and I'm scratching my
[7:44] theological itch now I want you to
[7:46] really focus on what is manifested when
[7:49] the kingdom comes in power there's a lot
[7:51] of things we think are power right
[7:52] what's powerful how the word of God's
[7:54] going to manifest itself in the last
[7:56] days and what it's going to look like
[7:57] and how it's going to feel and what it's
[7:58] going to sound like but here we see a
[8:00] rehearsal of what the kingdom real power
[8:04] of the kingdom is when it's
[8:06] manifested woo I like that Matthew
[8:09] chapter 16: 27 it says for the son of
[8:11] man shall come in the glory of his
[8:14] father with his angels and then shall he
[8:17] then he shall reward every man according
[8:19] to his Works verily I say unto you now
[8:22] this is the statement that causes a lot
[8:24] of stumbling there be some standing here
[8:26] which shall not taste of death till they
[8:28] see the son of man coming in his kingdom
[8:31] so as we're preaching on the kingdom
[8:33] this is some representation or rehearsal
[8:37] of an aspect of the son of man coming in
[8:40] his kingdom and that that should bring
[8:42] up a lot of things in our minds we think
[8:43] about what this message reveals and the
[8:45] son of man comes after Son of God
[8:48] dispensation before son of David
[8:49] dispensation there's a dispensation of
[8:52] the son of man and that's no small thing
[8:54] that covers a
[8:55] lot and now he as he speaks this brother
[8:58] bam says there some there they are
[8:59] stumbled they're tripped up oh these
[9:01] guys are never going to die until the
[9:02] kingdom is ushered in but he's speaking
[9:05] of how that they would see a rehearsal
[9:08] of this son of man's Kingdom and in as
[9:11] you keep reading in this next chapter
[9:14] and uh Mark chapter 9 doesn't break this
[9:16] up but Matthew does it says and after
[9:18] six days Jesus taketh Peter James and
[9:20] John his brother and bringeth them up
[9:22] into a high mountain apart and there's a
[9:23] lot lot of types there after these six
[9:25] days and going up to this High part of
[9:28] this mountain and he was transfigured
[9:30] before them and his face did shine as
[9:33] the sun and his reignment as was white
[9:35] as the light now this is some reflection
[9:39] of Glory this is some manifestation of
[9:41] Glory it's it's literally happening
[9:43] before them at the time but we know
[9:45] according to the message of the hour and
[9:46] even what Jesus says here it's some
[9:49] representation of what's going to be and
[9:52] as we see these elements and behold
[9:53] there appeared unto them Moses and
[9:55] Elijah or Elias talking with them and
[9:57] this represents the sleeping Saints and
[9:59] the resurrected Saints so these uh
[10:02] individuals that are there literally in
[10:05] that moment in time are standing their
[10:07] signpost and as Shadows of what will be
[10:10] in the end time and this has some
[10:13] representation of the the son of man
[10:15] come in his kingdom and the glory of God
[10:19] he says and then answered Peter and this
[10:20] is so peterlik this is so on brand for
[10:23] Peter and said unto Jesus Lord it is
[10:26] good for us to be here if thou Wilt let
[10:28] us make three Tabernacles one for thee
[10:30] and one for Moses and one for Elias and
[10:33] this is this is just his sincere
[10:36] response and the this is
[10:39] recorded and um I'm sure maybe if Peter
[10:41] was writing this we would have never
[10:42] known it uh but these other writers are
[10:45] sure to mention it and Peter's like oh
[10:47] this would be great let's build a church
[10:49] to this let's build a church to that
[10:50] let's build a church to this and let's
[10:52] build a
[10:53] tabernacle and and in here we would have
[10:55] one for Moses a dwelling place for Moses
[10:57] a dwelling place for Elijah uh we would
[10:59] have these a place for you these uh
[11:02] places of worship or dwelling some
[11:06] signification some representation and
[11:08] Peter is being sincere in this and we
[11:10] don't know if what happens next is God's
[11:14] response to that if it would have been
[11:16] said anyways but it certainly does rebut
[11:18] what Peter said and while he yet spake
[11:22] Behold a bright Cloud overshadowed them
[11:25] and behold a voice out of the cloud
[11:28] which said this is my beloved Son and
[11:31] whom I am well pleased hear ye
[11:36] him this is Christ saying we don't need
[11:39] an Elijah Tabernacle we don't need a an
[11:41] altar to a prophet we don't need a a
[11:43] gravestone to a Propet we need to rub
[11:45] every year and and wish ourselves luck
[11:48] uh this is not uh someone the other day
[11:50] was asking me if I had my burial plot in
[11:52] the same graveyard and I just told them
[11:53] I'd already bought it up you're you're a
[11:55] little late uh and I hadn't and they
[11:58] knew I would was joking I think but it's
[12:00] not that there's no place like that that
[12:02] we need to kind of gather ourselves in
[12:04] and a and be associated with because now
[12:07] he's saying there's only one place that
[12:09] he puts his name and he's saying it's
[12:12] not Moses it's not Elijah it's
[12:14] Christ this is my son in this phrase in
[12:17] whom I'm well pleased has to have more
[12:20] than just God projecting his pleasure
[12:22] towards him but we recognize that it
[12:25] speaks of him being in him I'm pleased
[12:28] in him and he says so hear ye
[12:31] him listen to him that's who you'll
[12:34] listen to and just recognize and we're
[12:37] looking at him at his Transfiguration
[12:39] we'll come back to him at his
[12:41] baptism that in this God Christ being
[12:45] the dwelling place of God that a Bright
[12:48] Cloud overshadows them and this voice
[12:50] speaks and says I'm in this Tabernacle
[12:53] I'm in this Temple you want to build
[12:55] Tabernacles here here here it is you
[12:57] want to build a temple to to Elijah to
[12:59] Moses one to Jesus I don't need another
[13:02] church Christ is the one Dwelling Place
[13:05] Christ is the Gathering Place Christ is
[13:07] where I put my name this is the provided
[13:10] place of worship and him I'm well
[13:12] pleased hear ye him and notice how
[13:15] similar that is to what happens whether
[13:18] it be in the Tabernacle which the cloud
[13:20] overshadowed them and the they couldn't
[13:21] Minister because the glory of the Lord
[13:23] filled I think we read that in numbers
[13:25] or in Exodus and now here in Kings with
[13:27] the building of the temple the the cloud
[13:29] fills the house of the Lord the glory of
[13:31] the Lord fills the house of the Lord and
[13:32] once again a cloud overshadows and the
[13:34] voice says this is my beloved Son in
[13:37] whom I'm well
[13:39] pleased now in Colossians chapter
[13:43] 1 we're going to pick up on that phrase
[13:46] this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well
[13:49] pleased hear ye
[13:52] him Colossians 1:
[13:55] 19 for it pleased the father that that
[13:58] in him should all the fullness dwell and
[14:02] and I'm drawing from before and after
[14:04] this and I'll kind of move around and if
[14:08] that's if you feel that that's um that I
[14:11] should take it all together I I could
[14:13] appreciate that but instead of just
[14:15] reading the scripture I want to start
[14:16] with this verse we'll back up to another
[14:18] part of it and we'll kind of work our
[14:20] way around this but we could take this
[14:21] statement as solid fact it pleased the
[14:24] father that in him in Christ all
[14:27] fullness dwell amen fullness is a key
[14:30] phrase to this as we'll want to maybe
[14:32] focus on this next week on Wednesday
[14:34] night more about the
[14:36] fullness and at his baptism we know in
[14:38] Matthew chapter 3 verse 17 when Christ
[14:41] comes to the Jordan and John sees
[14:44] witness of a dove descending upon him
[14:46] and a voice from Heaven saying this is
[14:48] my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased
[14:51] that this signified Heaven and Earth
[14:53] kissing Heaven and Earth embracing the
[14:56] word becoming flesh and when when this
[14:59] transpires this is a significant event
[15:01] and this is my beloved Son in whom I'm
[15:03] well pleased to dwell Jesus comes later
[15:06] in John 14:10 and says it's the father
[15:08] that dwelleth in me he doeth the works
[15:11] so here's a witness of Christ saying he
[15:13] dwells in me I'm his Temple I'm his
[15:15] Tabernacle now it's easy for us just to
[15:18] kind of gloss over that looking at it
[15:20] from our Christian values or Christian
[15:22] Perspective when he says the father
[15:24] dwells in me we're like yeah you got
[15:25] that right the Holy Ghost dwells in me
[15:27] and we understand understand that part
[15:29] but think of a a Jew who's thinking God
[15:32] dwells behind that Veil that holy of
[15:34] holies and that's where God manifests
[15:36] his presence and now here's a man
[15:38] standing there and saying the father
[15:40] dwells in me and they're saying wait a
[15:42] minute he dwells in a temple he dwells
[15:45] behind skin he dwells in a place that
[15:47] only the high priest can enter into and
[15:49] Jesus is like you got that right and
[15:52] here it is amen and and it's an
[15:54] expression now how that the father he
[15:56] dwells in me he does the works says when
[15:59] John says that the word was made flesh
[16:01] and dwelt among us and we beheld his
[16:03] glory the glory as the only begotten of
[16:06] the father so this was the glory of God
[16:10] tabernacled this was the glory of God in
[16:12] flesh yeah for it pleased the father
[16:15] that in him all fullness dwell now he
[16:18] picks it up the next chapter Colossians
[16:20] chapter
[16:21] 2:9 for in him dwelleth all the fullness
[16:25] of the godhead bodily there's that
[16:26] phrase again fullness fullness full
[16:30] and this fullness and I want to bring
[16:33] this down to maybe a level that everyone
[16:36] can understand this fullness is not when
[16:38] after you've eaten dinner and speaking
[16:40] to the young people when you say Philip
[16:41] you say I'm full right you say I'm full
[16:43] I can't eat anymore can I have
[16:46] dessert and and it indicates no you're
[16:49] not full you're just fed up right you're
[16:50] tired of eating the the greens and the
[16:52] beef or whatever it might be that's
[16:53] being served and you want something
[16:55] sweet you want something tasty that's
[16:56] not full that's just just finished or
[16:59] done and there's still room I want
[17:01] something else so when it speaks of
[17:02] fullness it's not that kind of full this
[17:04] is like all of
[17:06] it as much as you can quantify the
[17:09] scriptures are wanting us to tell us
[17:11] that everything God is everything God
[17:13] was everything God would ever be somehow
[17:15] someway right is in
[17:18] there and I know that's hard for us to
[17:20] conceptualize because we're we're
[17:23] creatures of time and space and language
[17:25] and so we're just kind of confined uh by
[17:27] these different El
[17:29] so just the fact that God is eternal is
[17:31] right way over our heads you can't you
[17:33] can't get your head around that so if
[17:35] you can't get your head around eternity
[17:36] I understand if you can't get your head
[17:38] around all things being Eternal somehow
[17:40] sandwiched in within this body but the
[17:42] scripture is trying to convey something
[17:43] to us about all of it is in him whatever
[17:46] that might be the fullness of
[17:49] it and he's saying for in him dwelleth
[17:52] all the fullness of the godhead bodily
[17:54] Jesus Christ was the perfect and
[17:57] complete expression of divine divine
[17:58] nature I know we've covered a lot of
[18:00] this already in this Kingdom series the
[18:02] entire fullness of deity dwell in
[18:05] him the fullness of God's character was
[18:09] in Jesus Christ he says it's the father
[18:12] that dwelleth in me he does the works
[18:15] brother BR said he was the fullness of
[18:17] God God dwelt in Christ without measure
[18:21] it's quite a statement if if you can
[18:24] take something that has no beginning and
[18:25] no
[18:27] end and and and somehow measure him all
[18:31] that could be measured was in
[18:34] Christ so he says God dwelt in him
[18:36] without measure words that it was
[18:39] nothing was cut off it was complete it
[18:41] was
[18:42] full he said when God was in Christ he
[18:44] had the spirit
[18:46] fully now I recognize and I'll come to
[18:49] it my whole sermon was gear is uh at
[18:53] some point tonight maybe hijacked to go
[18:55] a par to a particular angle to kind of
[18:57] help us with this thought we say Christ
[19:00] had it fully he had it completely we had
[19:01] it without measure and I know some of
[19:03] you are already thinking about how God
[19:04] is brother brand is quantifying that or
[19:06] in a way removing any quantification or
[19:09] qualification so Christ fully he has it
[19:13] all and and that's the fullness of the
[19:15] glory of God in Jesus
[19:18] Christ all right now that's a big huge
[19:21] block there now I'm going to take a I'm
[19:23] going to lay another block here hope I'm
[19:26] not laying eggs but building blocks
[19:29] in numbers chap 14: 211 and we use this
[19:32] on
[19:36] Sunday I guess if there's one positive
[19:38] benefit from what I've been going
[19:39] through I'm having to go a lot slower
[19:41] and be more deliberate in my speech just
[19:43] to talk so maybe maybe I'm going at a
[19:45] pace that's a little bit more palpable
[19:47] and maybe it's your prayers that have
[19:49] caused this because you wanted me to
[19:51] slow down well here we are in numbers
[19:54] 14:21 he says but as truly as I live God
[19:57] speaking and this is an answered to
[19:59] Moses and his concern I think even
[20:01] brother Matthew Watkins was touching
[20:03] along these these um principles in
[20:06] Moses's prayer a a and and Moses's
[20:10] concern and God swears but as truly as I
[20:12] live so God swears in oath and he's
[20:14] swearing and he's swearing by himself
[20:16] because he can swear by none greater as
[20:18] surely as I live as truly as I live all
[20:22] the Earth shall be filled with the glory
[20:25] of the
[20:26] Lord God SW this this is a promise all
[20:30] the Earth will be filled with the glory
[20:32] of the Lord now some look at the
[20:34] scripture and they surmise that what he
[20:36] means is this as God did great exploits
[20:38] in Egypt and manifested his great power
[20:41] um then all the land such as Palestine
[20:44] is going to see the hands of God or
[20:46] they're in the wilderness and it's kind
[20:47] of localized or generalized that well it
[20:49] speaks of what's relevant to Israel and
[20:51] that all those in Israel and in the
[20:54] promised land are going to see the glory
[20:55] of the Lord but this speaks Beyond just
[20:57] is
[20:58] Israel this speaks Beyond just those
[21:01] borders it's not just saying well what I
[21:02] did in Egypt even though he's saying
[21:04] that 10 times I did this and you guys
[21:05] disregard him me you've hardened your
[21:07] heart but it speaks to it's prophetic
[21:10] God's going to do great exploits God is
[21:11] going to manifest himself in Israel but
[21:13] God is going to do more than that
[21:15] because one day Christ comes on the
[21:17] scene and now God's glory is dwelt in
[21:19] this temp uh Temple not the Tabernacle
[21:22] not the temple in Jerusalem but in Jesus
[21:24] Christ but even this is not fulfilled In
[21:27] the Flesh of Jesus Christ but it
[21:29] foreshadows the future
[21:31] Kingdom when Christ was on earth the
[21:33] earth uh saw the glory of God and in
[21:36] Earth the glory of God was manifested no
[21:39] question this was being done uh to some
[21:42] extent in the days of Christ but there
[21:44] will come a day and I just want to point
[21:46] to it real quick there is coming a day
[21:47] when all kingdoms of this world will
[21:49] become
[21:50] christs and it'll be a kingdom that
[21:53] envelops the entire Earth won't just be
[21:55] to the Sea and to the river to the South
[21:57] to the North but it'll be from sea to
[21:59] Sea it'll be the entire Earth all the
[22:02] Earth all kingdoms will be surrendered
[22:04] to Christ it'll be that perfect Kingdom
[22:06] be the perfect
[22:08] realization so there is
[22:10] prophecy of this Kingdom that is to
[22:14] come and I would like to kind of insert
[22:17] here that the millennial Kingdom and the
[22:19] reign of the son of David is a very
[22:21] remarkable Kingdom because it still
[22:23] exists within time when there's still
[22:26] sin and opposition and still yet a
[22:28] judgment to come and an eradication of
[22:30] all evil death hell in the grave and all
[22:31] those whose names are not written in the
[22:32] Lamb's Book of Life will be cast in the
[22:33] Lake of Fire and the millennial Reign
[22:36] exists during that time and if you could
[22:38] think a lot about what that Millennial
[22:40] Reign represents even before total
[22:43] renovation and annihilation of the earth
[22:45] and a changing of the Earth's nature and
[22:46] structure and the whole surface of the
[22:49] Earth has changed I want you to
[22:51] recognize that because it holds some
[22:53] beautiful truths for us that if there
[22:55] can be come on now I'm I'm talking to
[22:59] myself if there can be a rain like that
[23:03] even before the Earth is physically
[23:05] changed to a baptism of fire if you can
[23:08] have that before the complete renovation
[23:10] of the Earth's physical structure then
[23:13] can there not be a rain now in this
[23:17] earth before the
[23:19] change Hallelujah before the change can
[23:22] there be a millennium that begins to
[23:24] break down within my soul the reign of a
[23:27] king begins to rise up Amen Let Him rise
[23:30] up inside of us to say this Earth this
[23:34] Earth is mine and all the glory therein
[23:39] Hallelujah and the Bible begins to speak
[23:41] in Isaiah 6:3 and notice the language
[23:45] how this is phrased he says I swear the
[23:47] Earth will be filled with the glory of
[23:49] the Lord and now it says in Isaiah 6:3
[23:50] and one Cried unto another these angels
[23:53] this worship said holy holy holy is the
[23:56] Lord of hosts the whole earth is is full
[24:00] of his glory amen so here's one saying
[24:03] it will be filled with the glory of the
[24:05] Lord and now there's this utterance that
[24:08] the whole earth is full of his glory
[24:11] amen in Psalm 72:19 and blessed be his
[24:13] glorious name forever and now the prayer
[24:16] we could say here God swore it here God
[24:19] does it and here comes the Cry of the
[24:21] psalmus and blessed be his glorious name
[24:23] forever and let the whole earth be
[24:24] filled with his glory amen and amen am
[24:28] notice he said he would do it we see
[24:30] that he does and there's the cry there's
[24:32] the prayer there's The Plea let the
[24:35] whole earth be filled with his
[24:37] glory here's a large thought the glory
[24:41] of God is his is an ultimate the
[24:43] expression of God's glory is really at
[24:45] the heart of what he's
[24:47] doing the glory of God is the ultimate
[24:49] purpose of
[24:50] creation it's your ultimate
[24:53] goal what what Glory do you want to
[24:55] declare your own the glor glory of the
[24:58] earth Glory of a church the glory of an
[25:00] ideal there's a lot of glories that man
[25:02] May seek after and man kind of at his
[25:04] core and his Bas nature seeking after
[25:07] Glory some popularity Prestige or power
[25:10] he he's looking to be revered by others
[25:12] to be looked to as powerful uh where
[25:14] where man at his nature his base nature
[25:17] even his Fallen nature is in the pursuit
[25:19] of some sort of glory and that's a
[25:22] perversion really of God the unknown God
[25:24] the invisible God the hidden nobody
[25:27] knows him
[25:28] think of this here he is the allmighty
[25:31] one the self-existing one the strong one
[25:35] and nobody knows anything about him he's
[25:37] all alone and so God's objective from
[25:40] the beginning is to declare his glory
[25:44] and if you could think of that
[25:45] everything that God has done from the
[25:46] beginning he wants his glory to be known
[25:48] he wants his glory to be known what do
[25:49] the heavens declare his glory what does
[25:52] the creation declare his glory the Bible
[25:54] says in Revelations 4:11 Thou Art Worthy
[25:56] oh Lord to receive Glory glory and honor
[25:58] and
[25:59] power for thou Hast created all things
[26:02] and for thy pleasure they are and were
[26:05] created if I could say this creation was
[26:07] for the express purpose of declaring
[26:09] God's glory even to the point that if
[26:12] you don't declare him the gcks will cry
[26:16] out and praise him because there go
[26:18] there has to be one that declares his
[26:20] glory there is it's his glory that needs
[26:23] to be declared this is something at the
[26:25] heart of God's objective and purpose and
[26:27] I don't want this phrase just to be lost
[26:29] but the glory of God is an
[26:33] ultimate he says in Isaiah 4321 the PE
[26:36] this people have I formed for
[26:40] myself is now it's going Beyond just
[26:42] like the creation of the earth and all
[26:44] creatures in creation but now the people
[26:47] that he has formed for his
[26:48] purpose the bride the
[26:51] elect I formed them for myself they
[26:53] shall show forth my praise that's his so
[26:58] forth yes they they will they will
[27:01] manifest they will
[27:03] declare so just as God dwelt fully in
[27:06] his
[27:08] son and dwelt fully in Christ and and
[27:11] that flesh was M it was created by God
[27:15] but it was kin kinship to man want you
[27:19] see that H he was uh human he was man a
[27:24] God man so there's the Affinity to the
[27:27] Earth and God dwelt fully in Christ and
[27:30] just as God dwelt fully in his son he
[27:32] wants his glory to fill the whole
[27:35] earth tie into this those of you who are
[27:40] really have an appetite for the message
[27:41] and as you've been taught very well in
[27:44] your experience with God I know you have
[27:46] knowing the churches you're from and the
[27:48] Ministries that have ministered to you
[27:50] connect this right back to Christ is the
[27:52] mystery God revealed and the three-fold
[27:54] purpose that you have to manifest him F
[27:57] self fully through the Sun and then have
[28:00] preeminence in his
[28:01] bride to bring back what what he calls a
[28:04] Garden of Eden back to our original
[28:07] position so this is now Colossians 1:18
[28:11] now this is the verse we read we said
[28:14] for it pleased the father that in him
[28:15] should all fullness dwell but this is
[28:17] the verse that precedes it I trust I'm
[28:19] doing okay on time tonight says and he
[28:21] is speaking of Christ he is the head of
[28:23] the body this is the one that it pleased
[28:25] God that in him all fullness full Ness
[28:27] would dwell says and he is the head of
[28:29] the body and notice he says the church
[28:32] so now this is a different kind of
[28:33] language Christ is the head and he's the
[28:36] head of the body which is the church who
[28:38] is the beginning the firstborn from the
[28:40] dead speaking of Christ that in all
[28:42] things he might have the preeminence now
[28:45] to me this speaks he's the chief he's
[28:47] the Lord of all he's the head so there's
[28:50] some sort of sovereignty there's some
[28:52] sort of complete Reign that he has if
[28:54] he's going to be the preeminent one he's
[28:57] going to to be the Eminence in all
[28:59] things so this this this is uh I had to
[29:03] pull back the curtain a little bit cuz
[29:04] in my mind I'm thinking well how is the
[29:07] how is the glory of God going to fill
[29:08] the whole earth there's got to be some
[29:10] means that it does that and now Christ
[29:12] is to have preeminence in all
[29:15] things and he wants the go God wants his
[29:18] glory to fill the whole earth and
[29:20] there's some I see some
[29:23] uh companion image to Christ having pre
[29:27] in all things and now the image to me
[29:30] becomes a little bit more
[29:32] distinct or clear because now Christ is
[29:35] described as the head of the body and
[29:37] the body is the church or if I could say
[29:39] bride just to be a little bit more
[29:41] particular so Christ we know is the
[29:45] temple but now it's depicted as a body
[29:48] of which Jesus Christ is the
[29:51] head and this is
[29:55] uh it's not a construct
[29:57] that we would use to make the go word of
[29:59] God seem less clear but it's a way of
[30:03] describing it so you could understand
[30:05] really what it is the temple was not the
[30:08] ultimate it foreshadowed the ultimate so
[30:11] we wouldn't never want the temple
[30:14] itself to confuse what the ultimate is
[30:17] like wow but the temple was so many feet
[30:19] long and it had these rings and it had
[30:21] these colors and and you try to figure
[30:23] out you know longitude and latitude and
[30:25] add everything up and see if you can
[30:26] make it's like well it was just there
[30:28] pointing to Christ really what you want
[30:29] to know is Christ and we're not trying
[30:31] to figure out how tall he was are we
[30:34] well just just how full was his beard
[30:36] I'm just curious right we're not bogged
[30:38] down in all the minutia of the physical
[30:40] manifestation like no he is the word the
[30:42] fullness dwell therein and that's kind
[30:44] of the that's what leads us into this
[30:46] beginning of a relationship to know him
[30:48] and who he really is through his word
[30:50] and so Christ is the temple but now it's
[30:52] depicted as him being the head of a body
[30:56] amen
[30:57] and Ephesians 1: 22 and 23 as it says
[31:01] that in all things he might have the
[31:02] preeminence now writing in a very
[31:04] similar language he says
[31:07] this that God had put all things under
[31:09] the feet of Christ and gave him Christ
[31:12] to be the head over all things to the
[31:16] church so he has preeminence in all
[31:19] things but this preeminence is for the
[31:21] sake of the church that he's the head of
[31:24] all things to the church this is the one
[31:26] that has the
[31:28] preeminence and it says the church now
[31:30] don't let that 23 get in the way of
[31:33] understanding what he's talking
[31:35] about which is his body right the
[31:39] fullness of him that filth all in all
[31:42] amen
[31:45] I I I I just feel impressed to say this
[31:49] and I'll get into more detail in a later
[31:51] service that Paul to the
[31:54] Ephesians prays that they might be
[31:56] filled with all the fullness of
[31:58] God and that the purpose of the ministry
[32:00] speaking the truth in love is that we
[32:02] might come to the measure of the stature
[32:05] of the fullness of Christ so this
[32:07] fullness as it related to Christ now
[32:09] there's a language being used of
[32:11] us it pleased him that all the fullness
[32:14] of God would dwell in Jesus but now we
[32:16] saying that the church which is his body
[32:19] is the fullness of him that filth all in
[32:21] all we read that the church with which
[32:23] is his body the fullness of him that
[32:25] filth all in all so the body which is
[32:29] the church the body is the fullness of
[32:32] him that body is the living body it's
[32:34] used of a family so the church is that
[32:37] living
[32:38] body the bride is the fullness of him
[32:42] it's quite a
[32:44] statement the body is that which cast a
[32:46] shadow as distinguished from the shadow
[32:49] itself yes sir so listen in this context
[32:53] we're not talking about a moon that's
[32:56] reflecting the light of the sun we're
[32:58] talking about the body
[33:00] itself we're talking that the body is
[33:03] the very thing that would cast a
[33:07] shadow let's think about this this is
[33:09] this is not just a a a shadow or a
[33:13] semblance but the body is the object it
[33:16] is the substance it is the fullness of
[33:18] him that filth all in all filth means to
[33:22] fill to full
[33:23] measure to make complete in every way to
[33:26] render perfect
[33:27] there's a lot of ways to look at this so
[33:29] that it kind of anchors in our hearts
[33:30] and makes more sense but if Christ had
[33:32] an objective to redeem all the elect
[33:35] then there's a certain filling up that
[33:36] has to transpire in order to satisfy
[33:38] that and make it complete so it's not
[33:41] maybe as mysterious as we try to make it
[33:43] out to be sometimes because just even in
[33:45] that aspect alone that when the full
[33:47] body is made up then it completes and
[33:50] satisfies Christ his manifestation his
[33:55] objective his very purpose and so the
[33:58] body is that which fills up and
[34:00] completes and renders perfect Christ and
[34:03] the sacrifice and what he was trying to
[34:05] achieve I I one translation kind of
[34:08] rendered it this way for in that body
[34:10] lives the full measure of him who makes
[34:12] everything complete and who fills
[34:14] everything everywhere with
[34:16] himself amen this is the position now of
[34:20] the of the Bride As a body it is the
[34:25] fullness of him that filth all in all
[34:28] Amen in Colossians 2:9 we read for in
[34:30] him dwelleth all the fullness of the
[34:32] godhead
[34:33] bodily right we caught that in him dwell
[34:36] all the fullness of the godhead bodily
[34:38] and you ye are complete in
[34:41] [Music]
[34:42] him talk about a
[34:44] woo in him dwell the fullness of the
[34:47] godhead bodily and now you are complete
[34:50] in him which is the head of all
[34:52] principality and Power in him you're
[34:55] complete in him you're made made perfect
[34:57] in him you're made whole so the fullness
[35:00] of God was in
[35:02] Christ and now the Believers are given
[35:05] fullness in
[35:07] Christ and and I want you to see it on
[35:09] maybe a broader scale that the body the
[35:12] bride in totality is the fullness of him
[35:16] that filth on on John 1:16 and of his
[35:20] fullness have we all received in Grace
[35:22] of for Grace this is our participation
[35:25] that if all fullness of God was in
[35:27] Christ now we are participating in the
[35:29] fullness in him dwelt all the fullness
[35:31] of the godhead bodily and we are
[35:33] complete in him we are in him therefore
[35:36] we're part of this
[35:38] completeness in 2 Peter 1:4 whereby are
[35:40] given unto us exceeding great and
[35:42] precious promises that by these promises
[35:45] by the word ye might be partakers of the
[35:47] divine nature having escaped the
[35:49] corruption that is in the world through
[35:51] lust we are to be partakers of the
[35:53] divine nature think and think of that as
[35:56] Christ
[35:57] in him dwell all deity so we said the
[36:00] full the fullness of deity dwell in him
[36:04] that's deity is the divine nature but
[36:06] now we're to be partakers of deity
[36:09] partakers of divine nature give some uh
[36:12] give some prayer and consideration to to
[36:15] even what Pentecost
[36:18] represents there a lot of things related
[36:21] to it a lot of ancillary things and a
[36:23] lot of manifestations of the spirit that
[36:24] are related to it but if I could just
[36:26] the Thunder of a whole series I've been
[36:28] preparing Pentecost is deity indwelling
[36:31] the individual that's
[36:34] it that's what that's the objective is
[36:36] to come to that place where God would
[36:38] indwell in US brother Bram says I've
[36:41] seen people at ball games get so happy
[36:43] they'd stammer their lips and everything
[36:44] else I know this is how the it's usually
[36:47] used is that well if you can shout at a
[36:49] ball game and act all crazy I can do it
[36:51] in church but brother Bram in different
[36:53] places is saying you know what to shout
[36:54] in church is no different than what you
[36:56] do at a ball game
[36:57] game come on somebody it's exactly what
[37:00] he's saying he said they get excited at
[37:02] a ball game and you get excited at
[37:04] church no difference he says don't tell
[37:07] me we're in need of a Revival of
[37:08] Salvation and the Pentecostals come
[37:11] around get the people worked up and tell
[37:12] them they speak in tongues they got the
[37:13] Holy Ghost and some of them live all
[37:15] kind of lives afterwards says listen
[37:17] brother the day of Pentecost it wasn't
[37:19] so they never relied upon any tongues or
[37:22] anything while they were standing in one
[37:24] place in one Accord God came down
[37:26] literally among them they saw in each
[37:28] one of them licks of fire about like
[37:29] that hanging above their head God was
[37:31] there I love this it was no accepted by
[37:35] faith or some emotion they were filled
[37:38] with the Holy Ghost and they went out
[37:40] and began to speak with tongues but
[37:42] first they met God and he said that's
[37:44] what the matter today people get worked
[37:46] up and excited emotion and it's not the
[37:49] Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is
[37:52] tabernacling
[37:54] deity your word is his word he says I
[37:57] tell you what we need today is a call
[38:00] what we need today is a call not to some
[38:02] emotion not to some non-emotion not to
[38:05] some dry confession not to formalism but
[38:08] a call to Tabernacle deity a call to
[38:11] come back to the New Birth the Holy
[38:13] Ghost is tabernacling
[38:16] [Music]
[38:18] deity so we have been made partakers of
[38:20] the divine
[38:21] nature and if we are tabernacling deity
[38:25] in 1 Corinthians 3 16-1 17 says know you
[38:29] not that ye are the temple of God and
[38:31] now we're intersecting with kind of
[38:32] where we a place we were on Sunday and
[38:35] that the spirit of God dwelleth in you
[38:37] it's this qu this is a question do you
[38:38] not know that you are a temple of God
[38:41] and that the if the and the spirit of
[38:42] God dwells in you if the spirit of God
[38:44] dwells in you your temple just like
[38:46] Christ was If any man defile the temple
[38:49] of God him shall God destroy for the
[38:52] temple of God is Holy which Temple ye
[38:55] are
[38:58] could I just speak soberly to
[39:00] us that you're a temple of the Holy
[39:02] Ghost yes and if you're defiling it
[39:05] God's going to let you be
[39:06] destroyed there's corruption setting in
[39:09] there's things that's going to come
[39:09] against you there's things you're going
[39:10] to bow with things that are going to
[39:11] come up we've got to stay Sanctified I
[39:15] can't emphasize it enough to us as a
[39:18] church the things that brother brandham
[39:20] taught whether it be from television all
[39:22] the way to Fashion to music you name it
[39:25] were principles of Holiness and
[39:27] sanctification so that Christ could have
[39:29] the preeminence not
[39:32] legalism am and once we get detached
[39:34] from the why and the purpose of of the
[39:36] things that God taught us we're going to
[39:38] find ourselves kind of just a drift and
[39:40] we uh untethered from purpose and
[39:42] meaning and and feel unsatisfied because
[39:45] we're not even recognizing the basic
[39:47] purpose of Holiness in our lives and
[39:49] staying Sanctified how can you find
[39:51] satisfaction in the extracurricular if
[39:53] we can't even kind of get our foundation
[39:55] real deep on the principles of clean
[39:58] living
[40:00] sir we are a temple of the Holy Ghost
[40:03] brother said Man was created for God man
[40:07] was to be the temple of God the place of
[40:10] God's rest the Holy Spirit was man the
[40:12] temple this is important to understand
[40:15] that we now are a temple Christ is a
[40:18] temple but now somehow in that Christ
[40:21] himself don't want to say he's a shadow
[40:24] but he was the first born he's the first
[40:27] fruits he is an image of what all of us
[40:30] are to
[40:31] be know you not that your body is the
[40:34] Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you
[40:36] he says in 1 Corinthians 6:19 which you
[40:38] have of God you don't have it on your
[40:40] own and you are not your
[40:42] own good now for the sake of Expediting
[40:47] if the old
[40:49] Temple as a
[40:51] shadow was full of his
[40:54] glory if the Tabernacle of witness which
[40:57] was
[40:58] temporary and pointed to the temple that
[41:00] would be built by Solomon was full of
[41:02] his
[41:03] glory if the temple itself was full of
[41:05] his glory and then Christ himself we can
[41:08] say well let me just say there if that
[41:10] Temple
[41:11] himself the old historical reality was
[41:14] full of his glory then ought not the
[41:16] body be full of his
[41:19] glory if the Earth is going to be full
[41:21] of the glory of God if one day the Earth
[41:23] is going to be full of the glory of God
[41:25] then would not we as a Ty
[41:26] be full of his glory I'll pick up on
[41:29] some of that maybe on Sunday morning on
[41:31] what God does to the Earth he does the
[41:32] individual I hope you're seeing that
[41:33] parallel there if the Earth is going to
[41:35] be full of his glory and one day the
[41:36] Earth is going to be full of his glory I
[41:38] believe that there's a place for us
[41:40] today as Believers to be the means by
[41:43] which the Earth is full of his
[41:45] glory and as individuals We should
[41:48] strive I wa I say strive but we should
[41:50] first desire and then pursue that desire
[41:53] to manifest the full measure that we
[41:56] have
[41:58] received brother bradam said the
[42:00] complete body of Christ is revealed in
[42:03] the form of a bride that was taken out
[42:05] of his side like Adam's was at the
[42:08] beginning that's this end time
[42:12] prophecy the complete body of
[42:16] Christ uh I want to I want to say this
[42:18] because it it'll help with your
[42:20] understanding through the church ages as
[42:22] it moved from the East to the West there
[42:26] were
[42:27] certain you could see it even moved
[42:30] geographically right and you could see
[42:32] the progression of it now in the end
[42:35] this word goes around the world and
[42:39] there's efforts being made to translate
[42:40] in every tongue and every language not
[42:42] so that it would be printed and then in
[42:45] print we say wow it's been manifested in
[42:47] every tongue but that the Believers
[42:49] would read it and become that word they
[42:51] would hear it and become that word and
[42:53] so then you see the whole Earth the
[42:56] whole earth is going to be full of the
[42:58] glory of God as the word is received
[43:00] into people's hearts and lived out
[43:03] around the globe that ought to put a
[43:04] fire in our hearts for Missions to see
[43:06] that this message is getting out and God
[43:08] bless you those of you who give
[43:09] Faithfully time and time again to
[43:11] missions and supporting these Works
[43:13] around the world it's part of God's
[43:16] glory filling up the Earth
[43:19] amen the complete body of Christ is
[43:21] revealed in the form of a bride the
[43:23] complete the full the fullness of him
[43:25] which filth all and all is going to be
[43:27] in the form of a bride that was taken
[43:29] out of his side like Adams was at the
[43:31] beginning a hidden
[43:33] Mystery now becoming manifested Glory
[43:36] because the woman is the glory of the
[43:37] man there was a hidden glory in Adam
[43:40] that wasn't known till the woman
[43:41] expressed it and there's a hidden glory
[43:43] in Christ Heaven's mystery that's not
[43:45] revealed until we reveal it in
[43:50] Earth now that's a lot of foundation for
[43:54] this and I felt just a come to this spot
[43:56] and hopefully we can end on this tonight
[43:58] I've got a few more pages here set out
[44:00] before me but I hope we can just end on
[44:02] this Christ was the
[44:04] fullness now his bride gathered a lot of
[44:08] teaching from the message the bride is
[44:09] the fullness of the word so she is in
[44:12] this end time manifesting God's
[44:15] glory Christ was the fullness now the
[44:18] bride will be the
[44:20] fullness the complete body of Christ the
[44:22] fullness is revealed in the form of a
[44:23] bride now the B brother brand teaches us
[44:26] as he said he was the fullness of God
[44:28] God dwelt in Christ without measure God
[44:30] was in Christ he had the spirit fully
[44:32] brother Bram says and this is take it
[44:34] from many many different places he had
[44:36] the spirit without
[44:37] measure like all the water out there in
[44:40] the sea that was what was in
[44:44] him so you think there was no more
[44:47] sea because all the fullness that's in
[44:50] the waters brother BR saying as a type
[44:52] this just a little type here said all
[44:54] the water that's in the ocean all the
[44:56] water that was in the sea by type is
[44:59] what was in Christ such that if you took
[45:01] if all the waters in all the world
[45:04] represented God's glory once it was all
[45:06] in Christ there's no more sea because
[45:08] it's all in
[45:10] Christ now if all the glory of God dwelt
[45:13] in Christ and he had it
[45:16] fully and now the bride is the fullness
[45:18] of the word manifest in his glory
[45:20] individually tonight at 8:17 on
[45:23] Wednesday night what does it mean to us
[45:25] for us spiritually individually what
[45:27] does that mean for you brother Adam what
[45:29] would that mean for you brother Rowan
[45:30] that all the fullness was in God now the
[45:32] bride's going to have the fullness but
[45:34] what does that practically mean for
[45:36] me and this isn't a detour this is a
[45:39] necessary stop in the sermon Paradox
[45:42] brother bam says we have the spirit by
[45:45] portion he had it without
[45:48] measure he was the fullness of the
[45:50] godhead bodily God but we have it by
[45:53] measure now I don't have these in there
[45:56] but John there's a I'm not going to get
[45:57] to everything that's in there tonight
[45:59] and I thought i' just try to work
[46:00] through these quickly but I might have
[46:01] to slow down a little bit so we have the
[46:03] spirit by portion when he says we he
[46:06] means you and I individually we all have
[46:08] it by Portion by measure he had it
[46:11] without measure he was the fullness we
[46:14] have it by measure the uh the sermon
[46:16] show us the father he says it this way
[46:18] we have the spirit with measure he had
[46:21] it without measure we are Sons and
[46:23] Daughters of God by measure now familiar
[46:26] with that you each one are familiar with
[46:27] the fact that Christ had it fully but
[46:29] then brother bam kind of brings this
[46:30] distinction says in Christ was the
[46:33] fullness of God but now when you break
[46:36] it down individually none of us have the
[46:38] fullness but we have some
[46:40] measure now to say that we have the
[46:43] spirit by measure this is the real
[46:45] thrust of what I want to come to now is
[46:48] to say that we have it by measure is not
[46:51] in any way a limitation for those who
[46:54] are filled with the Holy Ghost
[46:56] to say that Christ had it fully without
[46:59] measure and that you have it by measure
[47:01] in no way is a limiting
[47:05] factor in how the power of God ought to
[47:08] operate in us though we have it by
[47:11] measure if I can say this there no
[47:13] excuse on there's no excuse to say well
[47:16] I mean he was born of a virgin and he
[47:18] had it without measure and you know and
[47:21] I'm I'm I was born in sin and my
[47:25] question would be have you been born
[47:27] again okay so then you're born again by
[47:29] Incorruptible seed you have now had a
[47:32] birth which is liken unto his and that
[47:35] now the spirit of God dwells in you I
[47:38] want you to think of this I'm going to
[47:39] save some of this for the next time that
[47:41] if the spirit the spirit that raised
[47:43] Christ from the dead dwell in you this
[47:46] is saying now think about what's in you
[47:48] the fact that it's in you makes you a
[47:50] temple so if you are a temple then think
[47:52] about what this represents and the power
[47:53] of God that's embodied in this
[47:55] representation not as a shadow anymore
[47:57] but as the
[47:58] body what ought this to represent what
[48:01] ought this to portray what ought this to
[48:02] do so the fact that we would have the
[48:05] spirit by measure individually is no
[48:08] excuse and no limiting factor on the
[48:11] spirit that is in Us by
[48:13] measure because in the message Paradox
[48:16] says we have the spirit by portion but
[48:18] now he says in the same seron now that's
[48:20] like taking a spoonful of water out of
[48:23] the
[48:23] ocean Jesus was the whole
[48:26] ocean but this is just a
[48:31] spoonful right so Christ is the whole
[48:35] ocean over there there'll be no more sea
[48:38] why because it's filled up in another
[48:41] vessels by type just by using an example
[48:44] but it's like a spoonful Jesus had the
[48:46] whole ocean you have a spoonful he says
[48:49] but remember the same chemicals that's
[48:52] in the whole ocean is in this spoonful
[48:55] yes he said only it's more of it out
[48:58] there so that's taking a spoonful of the
[49:02] ocean think of how vast these seas are
[49:05] and we oh the whole entire ocean was in
[49:07] Christ can't get my head around that but
[49:09] now A Spoonful is in me and brother B
[49:13] says now that's just to understand how
[49:14] the fullness was him and how you as an
[49:16] individual member now somehow have just
[49:18] a measure but he he he kind of pauses
[49:21] and say well let me clarify that measure
[49:23] that's in you has all the same chemicals
[49:27] that's in the entire ocean there's just
[49:29] more of those chemicals in the ocean so
[49:32] in the same sermon show us the father he
[49:34] revisits again as he says we have the
[49:36] spirit by measure he has it without he
[49:38] says like taking a spoonful of water out
[49:39] of the ocean and he's the whole ocean
[49:43] but the same chemicals that's in the
[49:44] spoon is in the whole ocean it's
[49:48] quantity but the same quality amen the
[49:53] same
[49:54] quality he say well there's in Christ
[49:57] was all of
[49:58] it but in me is a measure of it and even
[50:02] though it may not be as much it's the
[50:04] same
[50:06] quality it's the same quality because
[50:08] we're talking about
[50:10] fullness and I want you to think about
[50:14] your place individually
[50:18] now that the bride is the
[50:21] fullness so there's some the part that
[50:24] filth up so if I could say that God's
[50:26] got
[50:27] spoonfuls he's got spoonfuls he's got to
[50:30] measure out he's got to
[50:36] give and these
[50:38] spoonfuls have a
[50:40] measure and it's a
[50:42] designation but as he gives out a
[50:44] spoonful it's like well I'm going to
[50:46] give you Hunter a spoonful I'm going
[50:48] give you one but your your quality is
[50:49] better than
[50:50] his there's no check brand
[50:54] right the there there's no one's better
[50:56] than the other typee thing we don't need
[50:58] AI to generate the reviews for us if
[51:00] you've got the Holy Ghost it's the same
[51:02] quality as the Holy Ghost I've got
[51:04] you've got same
[51:05] quality and as these spoonfuls are being
[51:08] distributed brother's using this example
[51:10] so that we could understand ourselves
[51:13] without limitation right amen we have it
[51:16] by
[51:17] measure but I think I've mentioned this
[51:19] before but I want to say it with some
[51:20] Force
[51:21] now there are more molecules
[51:26] in a teaspoon of
[51:28] water than there are teaspoons of water
[51:31] in the Pacific
[51:33] Ocean so if you were to somehow be able
[51:35] to determine how many teaspoons of water
[51:39] are in the Pacific
[51:41] Ocean and you'd have a
[51:43] number of teaspoons it's saying the
[51:46] chemicals right in the water there's
[51:49] more chemicals in one teaspoon right
[51:52] than there are teaspoons that's good
[51:54] amen so tell me that the measure is a
[51:57] limiting
[51:59] factor we know there might be a billion
[52:03] teaspoons in your teaspoon are more
[52:07] chemicals than there are teaspoons siren
[52:11] that in you is the all the quality the
[52:14] endless Eternal all powerful quality if
[52:18] you could somehow come up with a measure
[52:20] of God the quality of Eternity is in the
[52:24] Spoonful of deity that is in you
[52:27] therefore if Christ was the whole ocean
[52:30] that was eternal power that was a
[52:32] certain kind of quality and the Spoonful
[52:35] has not limited that quality because in
[52:38] you are all the same chemicals that are
[52:41] in the
[52:42] ocean that's why we could say yeah I
[52:44] might have it by measure but without
[52:47] limitation amen come on the only limit
[52:51] is by the faith which we live the only
[52:54] thing that limits it is the faith that
[52:56] we choose to live
[52:57] by it's in
[53:00] there by measure Without Limits because
[53:04] the same quality it's
[53:06] God Amen a lot that can tack onto
[53:11] that but in Romans 12:
[53:14] 3-5 the end of verse three there it says
[53:17] as God hath dealt to every man The
[53:19] Measure of
[53:21] Faith there's been some dealing out some
[53:24] dispens
[53:25] dispensing to every man a Measure of
[53:28] Faith now again that might seem to be
[53:32] limiting but if Faith the size of a
[53:35] mustard
[53:37] seed then whatever measure you have of
[53:42] faith that faith unhindered is
[53:45] measureless am I making any sense maybe
[53:49] not but that's the Paradox whatever
[53:52] Measure of Faith you've been given if
[53:54] it's unhindered by unbelief unbelief is
[53:58] taken away from the equation whatever's
[54:00] in it is powerful enough to operate the
[54:03] Eternal Word of
[54:05] God and he says for as we have many
[54:07] members in one body and all members have
[54:10] not the same office so we being many
[54:15] here's all the measures all the
[54:17] spoonfuls all the members we being many
[54:20] are one body in Christ and everyone
[54:23] members one of another
[54:25] right how is it then we could have
[54:30] fullness it's because each
[54:33] spoonful each measure is measuring it
[54:36] all
[54:38] up brother brand says this in
[54:40] everpresent water from the
[54:42] rock ah man I've run out of
[54:47] time I really I mean do you want me to
[54:51] okay are you sure okay all right
[54:55] please don't throw me in the Brier
[54:58] patch he says what we need today is not
[55:02] pray for more
[55:04] power you got enough power to make a new
[55:07] Earth w Wait a new Heaven new Earth
[55:11] you've got enough power to make a new
[55:13] Earth we don't need to pray for more
[55:15] power he says what you need is Faith to
[55:17] use that power amen right what you need
[55:21] is Faith to use that power that's what I
[55:25] need is Faith there's only one building
[55:27] block for Faith Saints what we need is
[55:30] Faith and he says what you need is to
[55:31] control that life in our family
[55:34] devotions we've been looking at
[55:35] self-control it's been very very
[55:37] edifying he says what you need is to
[55:39] control that life what you need is more
[55:42] power I need more power I need more
[55:43] power bless God I need to cast The Devil
[55:44] out woohoo yeah shout right that's what
[55:48] I need no you need power to control that
[55:51] life you need to control that life live
[55:53] such a Godly life life that when you ask
[55:56] God anything you know we have confidence
[55:59] in God of that we know if we keep his
[56:02] Commandments he'll withhold no good
[56:03] thing from us if we walk with him God
[56:06] walking with us what a beautiful theme I
[56:08] want to walk with him I want to walk
[56:10] with him walking with him makes things
[56:12] clear walking with him unfolds things
[56:14] before me walking with him will give me
[56:16] or more understanding the scripture
[56:18] walking with him will give me this
[56:19] knowledge of him and the glory of God
[56:21] and what I need is not more power I've
[56:23] got enough power in me
[56:25] how by the measure I've got because the
[56:28] measure I have has this endless quantity
[56:31] of God I may have the spirit by measure
[56:34] but I've got a limitless God that's
[56:36] represented in that measure and in that
[56:38] is Limitless power so what I need is not
[56:41] more power I need more faith God give me
[56:44] more
[56:46] faith more faith to use that power
[56:49] because that power operates according to
[56:51] the law of Faith the law of character
[56:55] therefore we need to allow the word to
[56:57] give us more wisdom and knowledge and
[56:58] Revelation that positions us
[57:01] amen and I wouldn't want to I I don't I
[57:06] think there's ways that we can describe
[57:07] it that can sometimes make it seem like
[57:09] we're being
[57:10] combative with and it's just the
[57:11] terminology that's combative if you say
[57:14] that you are a fully placed son right
[57:18] now and that's your Paradigm and that's
[57:21] what you believe you're fully adopted
[57:22] and positionally placed son right now
[57:25] then the language I would use is you
[57:26] need a revelation of what that
[57:29] means you need if you're firmly planted
[57:32] positionally plac fully adopted son of
[57:34] God you need to grow in wisdom
[57:36] Revelation knowledge and understanding
[57:38] of what that place means and that's one
[57:41] way of describing it another way of
[57:43] saying is I need wisdom Revelation and
[57:44] knowledge to place me positionally in
[57:47] the body of Christ what I am what we
[57:49] need today is a call a call to our place
[57:53] a call to our position and the word of
[57:56] God to the place where whatever wherever
[57:59] I am and wherever he puts me whatever
[58:01] zip code it might be as long as I know
[58:04] my place in Christ as long as I'm kind
[58:06] to coming to a greater understanding of
[58:08] my relationship to him I'm going to be a
[58:11] Powerhouse of God on two feet I'm going
[58:13] to have the power of God with me
[58:14] wherever I go whatever situation I find
[58:17] myself in individually as a husband as a
[58:20] wife as a family I will not fear what
[58:22] man can do un me cuz in my position and
[58:25] in my place I know though all hell be
[58:27] against me nothing can Prevail against
[58:30] [Music]
[58:31] me we are to
[58:34] manifest our measure of Glory in the
[58:37] place and the office and the manner that
[58:41] God has called us to
[58:44] am Brothers if you could come to your
[58:47] instruments I want to close with this
[58:53] statement in the sermon and
[58:56] absolute I think this will do a good job
[58:58] of tying some of these things together
[59:00] does it click a little for you what I
[59:02] mean by manifesting your measure of
[59:06] Glory if I've got a
[59:09] spoonful that's got a quality to
[59:12] it I want to manifest the
[59:15] quality I want to manifest the
[59:19] quality and that's my part if I can
[59:22] manifest my measure you manifest your
[59:25] measure it's filling
[59:28] up the sermon and absolute take note of
[59:31] when it was
[59:32] preached he says GE he says Jesus when
[59:35] he was on Earth Anointed with that they
[59:40] saw notice he said I come from God the
[59:45] spirit the light the pillar of fire and
[59:46] I returned to God and he was made flesh
[59:49] in order to die for our sins then after
[59:52] his death burial resurrection and
[59:54] Ascension
[59:55] after he ascended up on the 40 days he
[59:57] ascended up and on the 50th day he
[59:59] returned back notice he returns back
[1:00:02] there on the day of Pentecost in the
[1:00:04] form of a pillar of fire among the
[1:00:06] people and separated himself like
[1:00:09] tongues of fire and set upon each of
[1:00:13] them and then they were all filled with
[1:00:16] the Holy Ghost Holy Ghost is Tabernacle
[1:00:19] and deity this is
[1:00:23] Pentecost when the Holy Ghost indwells
[1:00:25] them this is that most reverent special
[1:00:29] designation on the day of Pentecost amen
[1:00:32] this if if there's one thing that we
[1:00:34] could distinguish from all time in
[1:00:35] history that represents Pentecost it's
[1:00:41] this and they were all filled with the
[1:00:43] Holy Ghost and began to speak in other
[1:00:45] tongues as the spirit gave them
[1:00:47] utterance God separated himself God
[1:00:50] first in a great Pillar of Fire God
[1:00:53] manifested in the human body
[1:00:55] now God separated himself among his
[1:00:57] people the pillar of fire breaking up
[1:00:59] and setting upon each of them like Fork
[1:01:01] lick of blazes cloven tongues set upon
[1:01:04] them Forks of fire clo tongues like fire
[1:01:06] set upon each of them and they were all
[1:01:08] filled with that and begin to speak with
[1:01:11] tongues as the spirit gave them
[1:01:13] utterance now this next statement to me
[1:01:15] is so powerful now you
[1:01:18] see we are not a divided
[1:01:22] people we've got to be in unity am
[1:01:26] because each of us is holding a part of
[1:01:29] God Amen now he is not saying this to
[1:01:32] Arizona Believers Church he's saying
[1:01:34] this to the body of
[1:01:35] Christ and I believe that we as members
[1:01:38] of this assembly we hold that dear to
[1:01:40] our hearts and thank God for a church
[1:01:41] that we could attend that we feel to be
[1:01:43] a part of and can call it home but we
[1:01:45] got to recognize that this church serves
[1:01:47] the true church and your place in this
[1:01:49] church really only has power and weight
[1:01:51] because you have place in the body of
[1:01:53] Christ and so so that's what he's
[1:01:55] speaking to we are not a divided people
[1:01:57] we've got to be in unity because each
[1:01:59] one of us is holding a part of God this
[1:02:01] is bigger than the local assembly this
[1:02:03] is the fullness of him the
[1:02:06] bride and we must come
[1:02:09] together now I know there's a way that
[1:02:11] when we read this I I I think that even
[1:02:13] when we first kind of read through this
[1:02:14] and I'm not trying to condition you
[1:02:16] against seeing it this way but I know
[1:02:17] that when we read this we typically make
[1:02:20] comment that when we come to church each
[1:02:22] one of us brings our lick of fire and as
[1:02:24] we bring our licks of fire the kind of
[1:02:26] the phrase is we recreate the pillar of
[1:02:28] fire again and and and just let's just
[1:02:30] kind of tap the brakes a little bit
[1:02:33] right because in a in a sense if there
[1:02:36] is a measure that makes up the whole
[1:02:39] Pillar of Fire that's not just
[1:02:41] represented in a couple thousand people
[1:02:42] that we could somehow scramble together
[1:02:44] for a meeting in the United States right
[1:02:47] that still would just be part because
[1:02:50] it's represented globally and every
[1:02:52] bride member that is baptized in the
[1:02:55] body of Christ and that will be baptized
[1:02:58] in the body of Christ so the coming
[1:03:00] together is not just simply in a
[1:03:01] convention or meeting but it has
[1:03:03] something to do with coming into the
[1:03:05] unity of the faith amen hallelujah and
[1:03:09] we must come together and then the
[1:03:12] pillar of fire is manifested in the
[1:03:14] wholeness in the fullness of it when his
[1:03:18] church sets together in Heavenly places
[1:03:21] I I believe that brother Brenham when I
[1:03:23] read all these different places
[1:03:24] it has a representation in nights like
[1:03:28] this it means something in a shadow you
[1:03:32] brought your lick of fire you brought
[1:03:33] your lick of fire you brought your lick
[1:03:35] of fire here it's being G then what a
[1:03:38] representation what a power that's
[1:03:40] available to us seated together in
[1:03:42] Heavenly places letting them have
[1:03:43] preeminence all of us being brought into
[1:03:45] one mind and one Accord through a church
[1:03:46] service but now I think of his fullness
[1:03:50] come on Amen that when we can come
[1:03:52] together the pillar fires manifested in
[1:03:55] the wholeness and the fullness of it
[1:03:57] when the church sets together in
[1:03:58] Heavenly places then the fullness of the
[1:04:00] power of God is in his
[1:04:02] church each one of us holding spiritual
[1:04:05] gifts and spiritual offices coming
[1:04:07] together brings that pillar fire back
[1:04:13] again so even though this might not be
[1:04:15] the whole it's a measure that makes up
[1:04:18] the
[1:04:19] whole even though I may not have the
[1:04:21] fullness I'm a measure that makes up the
[1:04:23] fullness
[1:04:24] so I've got to manifest my measure of
[1:04:28] Glory I have to manifest the glory
[1:04:31] whatever that pillar fire represents in
[1:04:33] type now you represent it yes you
[1:04:37] represent it amen just to think of the
[1:04:41] the the pillar of fire declared the
[1:04:44] presence of
[1:04:46] God on
[1:04:49] Earth whether it be a column of fire as
[1:04:52] it would lead the children of Israel by
[1:04:54] night night but then he's also a cloud
[1:04:58] did what it declared the presence of God
[1:05:00] on
[1:05:01] Earth we find that in 1952 he's
[1:05:04] photographed I believe it was as a
[1:05:06] pillar of fire right there in the
[1:05:08] deadness of
[1:05:10] night but at the rising of the Sun in
[1:05:12] the opening of this word he declares
[1:05:14] himself in a cloud why because it's
[1:05:17] daylight it's daytime a new day is Dawn
[1:05:20] and what is the cloud in the heavens
[1:05:22] declaring his presence on Earth H it's
[1:05:26] no more night time this is daytime this
[1:05:29] is no more Shadows this is time for
[1:05:31] fullness I want to manifest my measure
[1:05:34] of
[1:05:35] Glory Let Your Light Shine Let It Shine
[1:05:40] Let It Shine Let It
[1:05:42] Shine Let It Shine in its Simplicity in
[1:05:47] me that we might do our part as a church
[1:05:50] to come together we do not draw our
[1:05:53] swords
[1:05:54] in any way in some sort of carnality we
[1:05:57] got our minds on one goal that he would
[1:05:58] have the preeminence we got our minds
[1:06:00] set on one goal that the word what it
[1:06:02] would have its have its fullness in the
[1:06:04] body of Christ and I I just want to be
[1:06:06] so selfish as to think it'll never be in
[1:06:09] its fullness in the body if I can't let
[1:06:11] him have his preeminence in me so I say
[1:06:13] Lord let your glory be filled fill all
[1:06:18] this Earth if the Earth can be full of
[1:06:20] his glory before that Eighth Day then
[1:06:23] cannot this body in its weakness and its
[1:06:26] pain this body still gets sick because
[1:06:28] it was born of a woman this mind still
[1:06:30] battles because it's part of that
[1:06:32] original birth but I've got the glory of
[1:06:34] God by New Birth on inside of me and I
[1:06:37] want to believe that it can radiate and
[1:06:39] radiate and radiating the
[1:06:42] Earth and manifest our measure of Glory
[1:06:47] stand tonight
