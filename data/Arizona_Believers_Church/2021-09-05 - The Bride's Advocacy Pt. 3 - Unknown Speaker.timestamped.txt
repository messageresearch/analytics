[0:01] it was here in first corinthians chapter
[0:03] nine
[0:04] that we
[0:05] left off wednesday night so we want to
[0:07] jump right back into some of these
[0:09] things
[0:10] and i don't think that there'll be any
[0:12] anything lost in not being able if you
[0:15] didn't hear wednesday night service
[0:17] but we're speaking on the subject of the
[0:18] bride's advocacy and this is continuing
[0:21] on how we identified that we have an
[0:23] advocate with the father
[0:25] this advocate is connected with the
[0:27] mercy seat and then we begin to realize
[0:29] that this advocate is not only before
[0:32] the father but it's within us and it's
[0:34] an advocate that we have as an inner
[0:35] strength and an inner teacher and it
[0:38] that kind of turns around now that with
[0:40] that on our side we have a ministry
[0:42] and we have an advocacy and we're
[0:44] wanting to go slowly through this
[0:47] first corinthians chapter 9 verse 19 for
[0:49] though i be free from all men
[0:51] yet have i made myself servant unto all
[0:54] that i might gain the more
[0:56] he's actually talking about gaining
[0:59] souls and gaining salvation and of the
[1:01] jews i became as a jew that i might gain
[1:04] the jews to them that are under the law
[1:07] gentiles that would still observe
[1:09] judaic tradition and observe the law as
[1:11] under the law that i might gain them
[1:13] that are under the law to them that are
[1:15] without law as without law being not
[1:18] without law to god but under the law to
[1:20] christ that i might gain them that are
[1:23] without law to the weak i became his
[1:25] weak that i might gain the weak and i
[1:28] made all things to all men that i might
[1:30] by all means save some
[1:33] all means to save some all means is not
[1:36] worth it if we save all right but if we
[1:38] just save some all means is worth it and
[1:42] says and this i do notice the reason why
[1:45] it is done for the gospel sake that i
[1:47] might be partaker thereof with you he
[1:49] does it for the gospel sake
[1:51] and then even
[1:52] though the next few verses though we
[1:55] don't have them as part of our text he's
[1:56] talking about how that
[1:58] not everyone runs who runs in a race
[2:00] receives a prize but he says run that
[2:01] you may obtain
[2:02] if you're going to strive
[2:04] for the master you have to be temperate
[2:06] and he's actually talking about when he
[2:07] keeps under his body and he brings it
[2:09] under subjection
[2:10] uh he's talking about being effective as
[2:12] a witness not questioning his salvation
[2:14] but being an effective representation of
[2:16] the gospel because then he continues in
[2:19] chapter 10 where we'll get to today
[2:21] about doing all to the glory of god and
[2:23] then calls back to these very verses
[2:24] about being all things to all men let's
[2:27] bow our heads in a word of prayer our
[2:28] heavenly father we're so happy this
[2:30] morning
[2:31] we feel such a
[2:33] an appropriate and spiritual lightness
[2:35] in us where we're not burdened or
[2:37] anxious we're not nervous we're not
[2:39] moved by fearful signs in the world
[2:41] today we're not moved by economics not
[2:44] even troubled by a heat wave lord we're
[2:46] just happy in our spirits and we know
[2:48] there's a lot of challenges that we face
[2:50] as families as young men and young
[2:51] ladies that their circumstances that lay
[2:54] before us that we're not quite sure how
[2:55] we're going to make it we're not even
[2:57] sure what it'll look like on the other
[2:58] side but can we father today is my
[3:01] prayer just accept your leadership and
[3:04] your guidance know that you're working
[3:05] all things for our good but most of all
[3:08] for your glory so i pray today that as
[3:10] we are in your presence that you'll
[3:12] speak to us plainly by your word
[3:14] and it being plain and being articulated
[3:17] in a manner that is pleasing to your
[3:19] spirit and in line in harmony with your
[3:21] character may souls be lifted up
[3:24] there be anyone who's lost today may
[3:26] they be found if there be anyone sick
[3:27] may they be healed there'd be those who
[3:30] are wondering lord i'm gonna give this
[3:31] one last try speak to me or somebody
[3:33] seeking a vision from you lord and just
[3:36] i say pour out your spirit upon us speak
[3:38] to our hearts move in our midst we have
[3:41] no no other idea lord except to lift you
[3:44] up and we know that if you are lifted up
[3:46] you'll draw men unto you so we pray that
[3:48] you bless the reading of the word bless
[3:50] your people as we minister we ask in the
[3:52] name of the lord jesus christ amen
[3:55] god bless you you can be seated
[4:00] if you could turn your bibles to
[4:02] revelations chapter 22 verse 17 this was
[4:05] our text on wednesday night i'd like to
[4:07] start here
[4:08] it has um
[4:10] some principles that we'd like to keep
[4:12] before you as we go forward in the
[4:14] bride's advocacy or you could say our
[4:17] advocacy we don't use the terminology
[4:19] bride in any way to
[4:22] become exclusive but the bride is the
[4:24] body of christ it's a terminology bride
[4:26] is used in revelation
[4:28] and the body of christ used in the new
[4:31] testament paul identifying that the
[4:33] church of god or the church of christ
[4:35] is the body of christ and so that's what
[4:38] we're talking about the body of christ
[4:39] has an advocacy
[4:41] the bride's advocacy but i think
[4:44] and i kind of kept it as the bride's
[4:45] advocacy and the naming convention
[4:47] because we had called it the bride's
[4:48] advocate and i realized it might have
[4:50] been better to say our advocate and our
[4:51] advocacy so that's our little secret for
[4:54] those who don't go anywhere further than
[4:55] just looking at the titles online this
[4:57] is our advocacy it says in revelations
[5:00] chapter 22 verse 17 and the spirit and
[5:03] the bride say come so this is a ministry
[5:07] that the bride has not apart from the
[5:09] spirit but together with the spirit
[5:11] they've harmonized so much so to where
[5:12] they're saying the same thing she has
[5:14] the mind of christ she has thus saith
[5:17] the lord she's speaking what the holy
[5:19] spirit is speaking and this is really uh
[5:22] the final message the spirit and the
[5:24] bride this is the final message this is
[5:25] the final bidding invitation here in the
[5:28] the book of the bible this was just
[5:29] sealing off the entire bible it says if
[5:31] you add to not just the revel the what's
[5:34] in the book of revelation but if you add
[5:36] to or take away from the entire book of
[5:37] the bible
[5:39] so this is kind of the summation this is
[5:40] the climax the spirit and the bride say
[5:42] come
[5:43] and it has struck me how that it says in
[5:45] him let him that heareth
[5:48] say come and who is who is him that
[5:49] heareth who does he hear the spirit and
[5:52] the bride or the spirit in the bride
[5:55] saying come so the bride is saying come
[5:57] and now here's one who's been captured
[6:00] by that voice and now becomes part of
[6:02] the voice as well so they were there
[6:04] lost and they weren't where they needed
[6:06] to be but they hear a voice saying come
[6:08] and then he who's heard is now in
[6:11] harmony with the holy spirit likewise
[6:12] saying come and then it says let him
[6:15] that is a thirst come these are those
[6:18] that we call out to those who are
[6:19] thirsty and whosoever will as this
[6:21] bidding is going forth let him take the
[6:24] water of life freely so this is what the
[6:27] bride has invitation to the water of
[6:29] life and it's done it the invitation is
[6:32] coming to take of it freely so as we
[6:34] read this verse the spirit and the bride
[6:36] say come this is our end time advocacy
[6:40] there is there is a responsibility that
[6:42] we have in the end time we have a
[6:44] commission there's been a delegated
[6:45] authority to us we are still fulfilling
[6:47] the great commission we have a calling
[6:50] and here we are together in harmony with
[6:52] the spirit saying come
[6:54] and so this word these are just going to
[6:55] be some review points
[6:57] this word advocacy means public support
[7:00] for or publicly recommending a
[7:02] particular cause or recommending a
[7:04] particular policy there can be a policy
[7:06] that says we believe that we should pass
[7:08] a rule a law or have a policy um that
[7:10] states such and such and then you say
[7:13] i'm all for this proposition and i'm all
[7:15] for this ruler this law and you advocate
[7:18] for it and you you announce your support
[7:20] or you could advocate against it and it
[7:22] would be this public support for a
[7:24] particular cause or policy
[7:26] and so our public words what we say
[7:28] publicly what we post publicly what we
[7:31] what we write what we broadcast in
[7:33] whatever form you may do it in in
[7:35] whatever manner that you may do it but
[7:37] our words and our actions form our voice
[7:40] we have a voice we have a life that is
[7:42] thundering out it's announcing something
[7:44] it's declaring something and that's
[7:45] really we've been taught that's what
[7:47] this world needs is thousands of lived
[7:48] voices
[7:50] thundering out against the devil so this
[7:51] is what we do in the end time we are we
[7:53] are thundering out the voice of god and
[7:56] so it's a public ministry from us should
[7:58] echo out sound out the ministry of jesus
[8:01] christ we are living epistles not
[8:03] written in paper but something that was
[8:05] written within the bosom of the heart of
[8:07] the prophet is now being lived out and
[8:09] expressed in flesh of the believer
[8:12] and we looked at how that advocate the
[8:15] very word advocate means to add a voice
[8:18] um ad which is two and vocacy is vox
[8:22] comes from vox or voice so your ad to
[8:24] advocate is to add the voice of support
[8:27] to a cause to add a voice of support to
[8:29] a person or policy as we're looking at
[8:31] and then we also saw and i realize this
[8:32] is some review so
[8:34] maybe you're kind of
[8:36] waiting for me just to kind of prime it
[8:37] before we get started but help me
[8:39] you just help me do this
[8:41] it comes from advocare which means the
[8:43] very advocare means to summon or to
[8:46] invite so advocacy is active support
[8:49] and to advocate for something you're if
[8:51] we just looked at it in pure public
[8:53] policy standpoint that if there's an
[8:55] issue that comes up and vote vote yes
[8:58] for prop one or vote no for prop one
[9:00] right so then people say we should vote
[9:02] for prop one and their idea is that
[9:04] they're looking out at a mass of people
[9:06] who may have not yet formed their
[9:08] opinion on prop 1 and so when you
[9:11] publicly support prop 1 you want to get
[9:13] people who are on the fence or maybe
[9:15] people who are opposed to it you want to
[9:17] get them to change their mind or sway
[9:19] their minds to accept prop one
[9:22] and so you publicly you don't just stay
[9:24] at home and go boy i sure hope everyone
[9:25] votes the right way it would be nice if
[9:27] that's what they did in elections right
[9:29] put the names on the ballot just like
[9:30] everybody figured out in their heads and
[9:32] we didn't have political ads and we
[9:33] didn't have debates but that's not how
[9:35] it works there's a public support
[9:36] there's vocalizing and what it becomes
[9:39] is one standing on a particular issue
[9:41] and inviting someone saying hey we want
[9:43] you to come join us in this come and
[9:46] it's a summons to support something
[9:48] and so our advocacy is is a voice
[9:52] it is an invitation and one thing that
[9:54] i'm that is very heavy on my heart to
[9:57] identify is our advocacy is not our
[9:59] opinion
[10:01] it's a lot of different things that we
[10:02] can have an opinion on and that could be
[10:03] our our personality even to some extent
[10:05] our individuality and we have these
[10:07] different parts of us that some prefer
[10:09] this and something like that some can
[10:11] even take sides in a political issue or
[10:13] some decision or policy
[10:15] and and we might think that this is good
[10:17] or that's good but these are things that
[10:18] would be indifferent things that aren't
[10:20] pertaining to the word of god matters
[10:22] that do not pertain to salvation or your
[10:24] perfection and we can have variances on
[10:26] that and we have different ways of
[10:28] seeing it
[10:29] and we so we have to be careful that we
[10:31] identify
[10:32] what we ought to be advocating what our
[10:34] testimony ought to be those things that
[10:36] we express that are part of the word of
[10:38] god are
[10:40] reflective of what we believe believe in
[10:42] our core as christians and be able to
[10:44] separate them from all the other ideas
[10:45] and voices and things in the world today
[10:47] that try to polarize us
[10:50] and it was at a minister's meeting last
[10:52] year that
[10:54] and the
[10:55] the question
[10:56] that was presented to the ministers was
[10:59] you know how can you be an effective
[11:01] witness without crossed in the line
[11:03] of being ecumenical
[11:05] or compromising that's a very very
[11:07] challenging question
[11:08] and brother jason demars spoke um in the
[11:11] process and
[11:12] they don't record these meetings because
[11:14] they they want it to remain private
[11:15] amongst the brothers but uh
[11:17] pause the tape uh he made the point i
[11:20] think this would he wouldn't mind me
[11:21] sharing this because it's very very
[11:23] valid
[11:24] he said that oftentimes we're dogmatic
[11:26] where god allows differences
[11:29] and then we allow differences where god
[11:30] is dogmatic
[11:32] and that's what ought to guide us when
[11:34] it comes to how we we think about what
[11:36] we advocate for and what we're publicly
[11:38] supporting and what we get very very
[11:40] adamant about and sometimes we can be
[11:42] very very dogmatic on an issue but the
[11:44] word of god doesn't speak to it and
[11:45] actually allows differences
[11:47] and then in our hypocrisy
[11:49] we get just allow all sorts of
[11:51] differences in some areas oh it doesn't
[11:52] really matter it doesn't really matter
[11:53] but yet god is very clear and dogmatic
[11:55] on it
[11:56] and so that's a principle i think it's a
[11:58] very very good principle that's not just
[12:00] um does it not just speak to ministers
[12:02] but it speaks to all of us who have a
[12:04] public ministry
[12:06] we have we're not we're not in a secret
[12:08] society
[12:09] we're we are not a better rendition of
[12:11] the illuminati
[12:13] right
[12:14] we we are with this is something that we
[12:16] bel what we believe we we i we we don't
[12:19] mind being identified with and we wear
[12:20] it we broadcast it we live it
[12:23] and so our the challenge that i have
[12:25] been expressing is we ought to be
[12:27] careful
[12:29] uh what we are advocating for
[12:32] and even ask ourselves what what are we
[12:34] advocating for what is my voice lending
[12:36] support to what am i inviting people to
[12:38] join in i don't mean to say this um
[12:42] uh in any way of disrespect they have a
[12:44] saying you know you know how you can
[12:45] tell someone is a vegan
[12:48] do you know
[12:50] don't worry they'll tell you you don't
[12:52] have to worry about they're going to
[12:53] tell you now that's no slight on a vegan
[12:54] because maybe we should be a little bit
[12:56] more outspoken about being christians
[12:58] and i realize that christians have
[13:00] actually christians have made it really
[13:02] difficult on true christians to be
[13:04] christians
[13:05] but let's not let their false example
[13:07] and their and their bad example dim our
[13:10] lights
[13:11] don't let their testimony become the
[13:13] bushel that we place over our
[13:14] candlestick but in other words let's
[13:16] let's live the right way as a contrast
[13:18] amounts to those professing to be
[13:20] christians so we can we can ask
[13:22] ourselves what am i advocating for what
[13:24] am i giving voice to so my life is a
[13:26] voice what i say is voicing something
[13:28] overall if someone looked into my life
[13:30] is there enough evidence to convict me
[13:31] of being a christian there's enough
[13:34] evidence to convict me of if i was
[13:36] charged with believing certain
[13:38] principles in the word of god if i was
[13:39] charged with believing certain things
[13:41] about the message is there enough
[13:42] evidence in my life to convict me
[13:46] could i have enough is there enough
[13:47] testimony in my life to be on to
[13:49] reasonable doubt a jury say yeah they
[13:51] believe the message
[13:53] and challenge ourselves with that notion
[13:55] with that with those questions
[13:57] so i want to just quickly uh
[14:00] summarize the uh the foundation for when
[14:04] brother branham writes in the church age
[14:05] book in chapter 9 of the church age book
[14:07] he makes the statement about there's a
[14:09] people who are the final voice to the
[14:10] final age and so i want to just back up
[14:13] for a moment and summarize what his
[14:15] foundation was
[14:16] and kind of his thought process where he
[14:18] arrives at
[14:20] this declaration that there'll be a
[14:22] people we can say the bride is the final
[14:24] voice to the final age and just review
[14:26] it very quickly so in the in those
[14:29] paragraphs preceding that declaration he
[14:31] says that the baptists have their creeds
[14:33] and dogmas and says based on the word
[14:38] and you can't shake them so they become
[14:39] very dogmatic about their creeds um that
[14:42] are based on the word but yet he's
[14:44] making this distinction they are in
[14:46] reality pure word
[14:48] is some sort of interpretation based
[14:50] upon the word and they've come up with
[14:52] their own creeds and dogmas and you
[14:53] can't shake them from it even if the
[14:54] word says well that's not all there is
[14:57] you can't shake them from him says the
[14:58] methodists say based on the word
[15:02] so they the methodists base it on the
[15:04] word he goes so far as to say that the
[15:06] pentecostals also uh claim he says they
[15:09] claim the
[15:10] methods claim that their doctrine the
[15:12] christian scientist
[15:13] and these different ones they claim
[15:14] their doctrine is word based
[15:17] now notice kind of where the temptation
[15:19] is where the trap is
[15:21] is to hold a crete or a dogma
[15:23] that is not truly reflective of jesus
[15:25] christ
[15:26] but yet we justify our adherence to it
[15:29] our vocalization of it or advocacy for
[15:32] it because we believe it to be based on
[15:34] the word so it's based on the bible it's
[15:37] based on the scriptures based on the
[15:38] message and we get very very um adamant
[15:41] about it or dogmatic about it but he's
[15:42] saying he's identifying this is the real
[15:45] trap for it to be word based but not be
[15:47] the word
[15:49] he says go right down the line and come
[15:51] to the pentecostals do they have the
[15:52] word give them the word testancy
[15:54] and he answers this they will sell out
[15:56] the word for a sensation just about
[15:58] every time
[16:00] and those sensations they would say are
[16:02] based on the word they'll even take you
[16:05] to the scripture and if you sat down
[16:07] with the pentecostal who believed that
[16:08] speaking in tongues is the evidence of
[16:09] the holy ghost they'll take you right to
[16:11] the book of acts and very effectively be
[16:13] able to show you that every time the
[16:14] spirit is falling there's unknown
[16:16] tongues being spoken
[16:18] and they take that and they base on
[16:20] their decision based on the word of god
[16:23] that this is the evidence of the holy
[16:24] ghost look at the hundreds of millions
[16:27] of people that would be baptized in the
[16:28] name of the father in the name of the
[16:30] son and of the holy ghost and what do
[16:32] they base it on they base it on the word
[16:35] but yet we realize it's not in harmony
[16:37] with the word it's not actually the word
[16:39] it's a dogma or creed associated with it
[16:42] so you can have dogmas creeds let me
[16:44] just say even ideas that are based on
[16:48] the word and maybe just to come a little
[16:50] bit closer to home because we might i
[16:53] hardly realize i don't think many of us
[16:54] ever when we're sitting around talking
[16:56] say well my dogma is is i really believe
[16:59] that alabama's going to win it all again
[17:01] this year
[17:03] you don't express it that way right you
[17:04] don't you don't express it as dogmas and
[17:06] say well in our house we have a creed
[17:08] uh those aren't terminologies that use
[17:10] so let's just say personal opinions
[17:13] personal beliefs
[17:15] um different ways of viewing the message
[17:17] and the interpretation thereof that we
[17:19] hold very ardently to and very
[17:21] passionate about and if we were given
[17:23] the word test maybe we're selling out
[17:25] for personal opinion every time
[17:27] maybe we're trying to make the
[17:29] make the message fit our paradigm or
[17:32] make the message fit our opinions
[17:34] instead of just laying our paradigm and
[17:36] opinions in this aside and just taking
[17:38] the word for what it is
[17:40] so it's that it's that language that he
[17:42] uses to build to the place where he says
[17:44] there is again another people in the
[17:46] land who under their messenger will be
[17:49] the final voice to the final age he says
[17:51] yes sir i love it in his formal writing
[17:54] in his book he has a yes sir
[17:56] he's validating this there's again
[17:58] another people in the land who under
[17:59] their messenger will be the the final
[18:02] voice to the final age what is the very
[18:04] clear message that's being sent it's the
[18:07] people who are the final voice to the
[18:08] final age not even the messenger
[18:13] don't throw anything at me
[18:15] but what are they sounding out
[18:17] they're under their messengers so they
[18:19] have to be a spiritual amphitheater of
[18:21] the voice
[18:22] that they're sounding out the same thing
[18:24] they're harmonizing it's not the spirit
[18:26] and the messenger say come and the bride
[18:28] is over here stay at home stay at home
[18:30] no they're saying the same thing they're
[18:32] harmonizing together so he says there
[18:34] will be a people there is again i love
[18:37] how it's present tense then i believe
[18:38] they were there
[18:40] the time that this was written a people
[18:41] in the land who under their messenger
[18:42] will be the final voice to the final age
[18:45] yes sir and then he says this drawing
[18:46] back to the baptist methodist
[18:48] pentecostals different ones the church
[18:50] is no longer the mouthpiece of god
[18:53] that is one who speaks up on the behalf
[18:55] of someone else
[18:57] so if you are a mouthpiece you don't
[18:58] speak of your own behalf
[19:01] you speak on another's behalf
[19:03] that's advocacy
[19:05] if you're not
[19:06] you're not you can't you're not can't
[19:07] necessarily advocate for yourself you
[19:10] have one that does that for you in the
[19:11] true sense of the word so he says the
[19:12] church is no longer
[19:14] the mouthpiece of god he says it is its
[19:16] own mouthpiece
[19:18] it's just trumpeting its own ideas it's
[19:20] just trumpeting
[19:21] its own opinions its own beliefs it
[19:23] wants to grow
[19:24] as bigger organizations and as a bigger
[19:26] church and you can become very
[19:27] protective of their doctrines very
[19:29] protective of their assembly very
[19:31] protective of the people why because at
[19:33] the end of the day they are their own
[19:35] mouthpiece
[19:36] not not speaking on behalf of the body
[19:38] of christ
[19:40] but they're their own mouthpiece and
[19:42] notice it says that it is a people
[19:44] another people in the land who under
[19:46] their messenger now this is a
[19:49] very important part of
[19:53] the uh
[19:55] very important part of this statement
[19:57] because there is there can be this idea
[20:00] that somehow we just evolve beyond the
[20:02] message or we we're further than what
[20:04] brother branham was or we've advanced
[20:06] beyond this and you have to be very
[20:08] careful because even when the
[20:11] we saw the trend we see the transition
[20:13] in the exodus that moses brought a
[20:15] message
[20:16] and brought him to the door of entering
[20:18] in so there was a message to bring him
[20:19] out of and into and you notice that when
[20:22] god spoke to moses he says i'm sending
[20:24] you to call them out of egypt but he
[20:26] never says he's called he's ordained him
[20:28] to bring them into
[20:30] and it's very very plain in the
[20:32] scripture i'm sending you to call them
[20:34] out he leaves this part off of moses
[20:36] himself leading them into
[20:38] but the promise is out of and in two and
[20:41] this is the message we brought you out
[20:42] to bring you into we brought you out to
[20:44] bring you in too and when it comes time
[20:46] for them to enter into the promised land
[20:49] moses now has to transition and he has
[20:51] to he's not going to go cross he knows
[20:53] he's not going to cross so he actually
[20:55] asked that god would put a man that he
[20:58] could set a man before the people that
[21:00] the people could have confidence in so
[21:03] that he could lead them into the
[21:04] promised land and we know that person
[21:06] was joshua and god identified himself
[21:08] with joshua but then you go into the
[21:09] book of joshua when they take over the
[21:11] promised land over 50 times it
[21:13] references as i said unto my servant
[21:15] moses or as you said unto moses and as
[21:17] they're taking possession of the
[21:19] promised land they're not deviating at
[21:21] all from the mess the messenger's
[21:23] message from the prophet's message
[21:25] they're now fulfilling it because they
[21:26] say as it was spoken by moses as it was
[21:28] prophesied by moses just like moses said
[21:31] here we are fulfilling the message of
[21:33] the hour fulfilling the commission so
[21:36] moses message was not surpassed when
[21:38] joshua took him into the promised land
[21:40] it was it was reaching its full
[21:42] vindication it was coming to its full
[21:44] climax or its full outcome that it was
[21:47] intended to produce
[21:48] and so in this
[21:50] this process and my you all are just
[21:52] pulling
[21:54] tremendously this morning and i feel
[21:55] that
[21:56] um
[21:57] even though i cut my notes very short
[21:59] last night i'll probably have to cut it
[22:01] even more so
[22:02] more so today before we go so long we
[22:04] have more baby dedications
[22:09] but in this broad in this passage here
[22:11] in the church age book and he's going
[22:13] through this they have their crease
[22:14] their dogmas and he says oh he's going
[22:16] to speak all right
[22:17] the church is its own mouthpiece but
[22:19] he's going to speak and references
[22:20] revelations 10 7.
[22:22] and it is in the days of the voice of
[22:24] the seventh angel so this is the this is
[22:26] the first voice this is the voice in the
[22:28] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[22:30] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[22:32] of god should be finished as he had
[22:34] declared to his servants the prophet so
[22:35] it's a very big very big scripture it's
[22:38] got a lot of different principles that
[22:39] are being brought into this and so this
[22:41] seventh angel this he has a voice and
[22:44] now john as he's walking through this in
[22:47] chapter 10
[22:48] there's going to be the seventh angel
[22:50] which we identify as brother branham and
[22:52] he is that voice in the days of the
[22:53] voice of the seventh angel when he comes
[22:55] to his ministry he begins to sound
[22:57] things out the mystery of god is
[22:59] finished now john
[23:01] then is hearing he's heard this mystery
[23:04] and then he's told as in verse 8. now go
[23:07] to him
[23:08] who has the book
[23:10] and and ask for the book
[23:12] then john goes to him who has the book
[23:15] and he says give me the book now what is
[23:18] this one who has the book uh what does
[23:20] he say take it
[23:22] and eat it up so there's actually a
[23:24] further revelation that unfolds to john
[23:26] when he has this audience take it and
[23:28] eat it up and he talks to him how that
[23:30] it's gonna when you take eat it's gonna
[23:31] be sweet in your mouth and bitter in
[23:33] your belly so when you take this this
[23:35] food and you eat it this is something
[23:36] that goes in your mouth and it's bitter
[23:38] in your belly that's a processing in
[23:40] something that takes place on the inside
[23:43] this is not observable
[23:45] we can look at food like wow that looks
[23:47] good and someone's like oh then taste it
[23:50] right immediately like why
[23:51] i mean
[23:52] i think we've all gone through this
[23:53] before where someone grabs this is my
[23:55] excuse to take a drink of water
[23:57] and they go oh that's nasty here taste
[24:00] this
[24:04] our answer every time should be no
[24:06] why would i do that i now know the
[24:08] mystery of that cup that it tastes foul
[24:10] but looking at it at first it might seem
[24:12] refreshing or appetizing but notice how
[24:14] this is something internalized as he
[24:16] takes the book and eats it but then
[24:18] verse 11 revelations chapter 10 verse 11
[24:20] i hope that i and it included that says
[24:22] and he said unto me
[24:24] thou must prophesy
[24:27] again
[24:28] you john thou must prophesy again why is
[24:31] it again because in the days of the
[24:32] voice of the seventh angel he sounded
[24:35] but thou must prophesy again in this
[24:37] word before
[24:39] in front of two thou must prophesy again
[24:42] before many peoples and nations and
[24:45] tongues and kings
[24:47] so notice how striking this is in verse
[24:49] 11. take the book eat it up and when you
[24:52] do it in your mouth it'll be sweet as
[24:53] honey in your belly it'll be bitter but
[24:55] this eating the book is very personal
[24:57] it's in your mouth very personal it's in
[25:00] your belly these are things you're
[25:01] experiencing that nobody else can
[25:03] experience the taste in your mouth is
[25:05] personal the bitterness in your belly is
[25:07] personal but it isn't ultimately just a
[25:09] private affair because now once the book
[25:11] is being processed and there's this
[25:14] individual experience of sweet word and
[25:16] the bitter after effects of it and
[25:17] taking of this book there's now a
[25:19] ministry that goes forth that thou must
[25:22] prophesy again before many peoples
[25:24] nations tongues and kings
[25:26] notice the taking of the book is very
[25:28] personal the eating of the book is very
[25:30] personal what the process that takes
[25:31] place in our hearts as we receive
[25:33] revelation of the word of god is very
[25:35] personal but it's through that personal
[25:37] communion between these cherubim in this
[25:39] last days that causes us to be the voice
[25:42] and in voicing it we do it before people
[25:45] tongues and kings and nations it's
[25:47] something that we do publicly
[25:52] prophesy
[25:53] thou must prophesy again it means speak
[25:55] forth by divine inspiration
[25:58] means to declare what is only known by
[26:00] revelation
[26:02] there's things that we know by
[26:03] revelation and we declare it not in the
[26:05] sense that we would try to explain it
[26:07] but we can declare
[26:09] the the word which has been revealed to
[26:11] us
[26:12] and leave it to god to reveal the rest
[26:15] so there is a speaking forth by divine
[26:17] inspiration to declare what is only
[26:19] known by revelation to prophesy also
[26:21] means to teach admonish to comfort
[26:23] others
[26:25] there's a teaching there's a refuting
[26:26] there's a reproven there's admonishment
[26:28] there's a comfort to others this is what
[26:30] is this is what this phrase prophesy
[26:32] means
[26:33] we shouldn't look at it narrowly in the
[26:35] sense of to predict the future and we
[26:38] ought not to look at it narrowly in the
[26:39] sense that this is something that only a
[26:41] prophet would do but rather those who
[26:44] have the mind of christ who have thus
[26:46] saith the lord the bride has thus saith
[26:48] the lord
[26:49] and we have been given the word of god
[26:51] it's been revealed to us we've taken the
[26:52] open book and we've eaten it now we are
[26:55] not saying our own words our own
[26:57] interpretation but we're expressing what
[26:59] has been revealed to us
[27:02] and in doing so we're declaring what has
[27:04] been divinely respired to us inspired us
[27:06] we're declaring what has been made known
[27:07] to us by revelation
[27:09] and the greek word for prophesy the
[27:11] greek root that it is taken from speaks
[27:14] of people who are filled with the holy
[27:15] ghost
[27:16] who by god's authority and his command
[27:24] plead the cause of god
[27:26] and urge the salvation of man
[27:30] this is what the word prophesy comes
[27:31] from the this word of maybe of one that
[27:33] would be a prophet brother brown even
[27:34] says in the new testament prophet means
[27:36] preacher
[27:37] and so we have those who are people who
[27:39] are filled with the holy ghost who by
[27:40] god's authority and command
[27:42] in words
[27:44] plead the cause of god and urge men to
[27:46] salvation
[27:48] plead the cause of god
[27:51] thou must prophesy again
[27:54] you must plead the cause of god and urge
[27:57] men to salvation do you notice even
[27:59] after this when the seals are being
[28:01] opened and at the end of the seals being
[28:02] preached there's still an invitation to
[28:04] salvation
[28:06] why because that
[28:07] it didn't it didn't change it didn't
[28:09] change uh the fact that souls were still
[28:12] being saved
[28:13] didn't change the fact there's still a
[28:15] need to come that there had to be a
[28:16] decision made a conviction made a
[28:18] confession of truth so there has to be
[28:20] the invitation given
[28:21] so if we're to prophesy again we plead
[28:24] god's cause we urge men to salvation
[28:28] now i think that kind of picks up some
[28:29] of the things we ministered on in part
[28:31] one
[28:32] now coming back to some of the things in
[28:33] part two
[28:34] paul says in first corinthians chapter
[28:36] 11 verse 1 he says be ye followers of me
[28:39] even as i also am of christ now kind of
[28:43] laid a foundation i'm taking a little
[28:44] bit of a change here
[28:46] when paul says this in chapter 11 we're
[28:49] going to look back again in verses
[28:50] chapters 9 and chapters 10
[28:53] to look at what paul was referring to
[28:54] when he said follow me as i follow
[28:57] christ so the example that paul's been
[28:59] expressing through these ten chapters in
[29:01] first corinthians
[29:02] he is saying this is christ like
[29:05] the things i'm laying down to you the
[29:07] things i'm expressing to you
[29:09] and the things that i have done and the
[29:10] things that i say i do are reflective of
[29:13] the nature of christ
[29:15] and so paul is following in this pattern
[29:16] of what jesus says in john 10 27 my
[29:19] sheep hear my voice and i know them and
[29:21] they follow me
[29:23] why is it you follow christ because you
[29:25] hear his voice
[29:26] that's why we follow him if we didn't
[29:28] know his voice we'd be following another
[29:30] we'd be following a stranger now the
[29:31] trick is how slick these strangers are
[29:34] is they make you think they're the voice
[29:36] they make you think they're christ they
[29:37] make you think that they're advocates
[29:39] for the cause of christ and you're
[29:40] following a stranger why because he
[29:42] presents himself in such a way to seem
[29:45] to be based on the word of god oh this
[29:47] must be the way this must be the truth
[29:50] but the distinction of sheep is they
[29:52] hear my voice and i know them and they
[29:54] follow me and the beautiful part about
[29:56] being a sheep is if anyone's been led
[29:58] astray by a stranger he seeks out after
[30:00] you
[30:01] and he uses his voice to correct you and
[30:03] bring you back
[30:05] now jesus and i want to look at this
[30:07] very quickly jesus when he is as he
[30:09] declares himself to be a shepherd
[30:12] and we follow his voice and paul himself
[30:14] saying i follow christ
[30:16] jesus christ did not even speak his own
[30:18] words
[30:19] and if someone should have gotten away
[30:21] with speaking his own words it could
[30:22] have been christ but he did not speak
[30:24] his own words or do his own acts or even
[30:26] seek his own cause
[30:28] so jesus isn't out there looking out
[30:30] what was best for him
[30:32] what was best for his ministry and what
[30:34] would be politically correct in this
[30:35] instance and how could i do this to
[30:37] persuade the most people and he didn't
[30:39] justify in the sense that here i am i'm
[30:41] called to get people's attention and and
[30:44] i want people to know that i am the
[30:45] messiah and so he didn't calculate what
[30:47] way he thought was best to get everyone
[30:49] to believe in him
[30:51] he did what the father showed them
[30:53] now as a contrast i think it's josephus
[30:55] that suggests that judas believed jesus
[30:58] to be the messiah he absolutely was
[31:00] convinced that he was a messiah but he
[31:02] felt that jesus needed some impetus to
[31:05] cause him to step into his office
[31:07] and to deliver them from the tyranny of
[31:09] rome so he thought well he's the messiah
[31:11] all i need to do is threaten him with
[31:13] death threaten him with crucifixion if i
[31:15] just sell them out to the pharisees and
[31:17] sell them out to those who are seeking
[31:19] to stone him and i get him in trouble
[31:21] then he'll be forced to show his hand of
[31:23] this messiah
[31:24] now think about that
[31:26] in that way and i realize maybe it's a
[31:28] little bit different look at judas but
[31:29] it identifies sometimes this idea that
[31:32] we want to try to help the gospel we
[31:33] want to help things or we think where
[31:35] this is righteous and this is right and
[31:37] we want to do things a certain way but
[31:38] if you're not doing it in harmony with
[31:40] the word of god
[31:42] if you're not doing it in the way that
[31:43] god has ordained you to do it then then
[31:46] you need to take a step back
[31:48] and say well it's not so much important
[31:49] that i see what needs to be done i i
[31:51] must do it in the way that christ wants
[31:52] it to be done
[31:54] doing god doing the right thing the
[31:56] right way
[31:58] so jesus says in john 14 10 the words
[32:00] that i speak unto you i speak not of
[32:02] myself
[32:04] that's what this is his declaration the
[32:05] words that i speak
[32:07] to you i'm not speaking of myself john 5
[32:10] 30
[32:11] says i can of my own self do nothing as
[32:13] i hear i judge and my judgment is just
[32:16] because i seek not my own will but the
[32:19] will of the father which hath sent me
[32:21] it's his judgment
[32:23] it's his cause it's not my decision it's
[32:24] not my determination i'm not taking this
[32:27] stand because it suits my fancy i'm not
[32:29] doing this because it's my opinion and
[32:30] it's my gut instinct i'm doing this
[32:32] because my judgment is not my own it's
[32:34] the judgment of the fathers he's the one
[32:36] that judges
[32:37] so i want you to i want this to i want
[32:40] you to be able to personally make this
[32:41] relevant to your life and oh yes if i
[32:44] was jesus back then in the days of the
[32:45] messiah no you're yourself do you seek
[32:48] your own will
[32:50] he speaks not of himself i seek not my
[32:52] own will in john 8 50 i seek not my own
[32:54] glory there is one that seeketh and
[32:57] judgeth who that's god
[32:59] god is the judge jesus in following in
[33:02] the lord's way i speak not of myself and
[33:04] following god's will i can do nothing of
[33:06] myself i seek not my own will i seek not
[33:09] my own glory who was whose glory was he
[33:11] seeking the glory of the fathers
[33:14] he was wanting to glorify god in heaven
[33:16] he was wanting to lift up his precepts
[33:19] his mind his principles jesus christ as
[33:21] the very heart of god wanted to be
[33:23] faithful
[33:24] to that
[33:25] cause no confusion
[33:28] then paul likewise as he said be
[33:30] followers of me as i am of christ he
[33:31] says in ephesians 3 1 for this cause i
[33:34] paul
[33:35] the prisoner of jesus christ for you
[33:37] gentiles
[33:38] paul the prisoner referred to him as a
[33:40] love slave
[33:42] paul is the prisoner of jesus christ now
[33:44] this is not one that is held in bondage
[33:47] we realize that there's this
[33:49] kind of a double meaning that is given
[33:50] as he's in chains and he would be
[33:52] locked up and he would be enslaved or be
[33:55] imprisoned that he would not claim that
[33:57] his bonds or his chains were those of
[33:59] rome but rather it was in the cause of
[34:01] christ that he had been imprisoned but
[34:03] then he reflects it in this way that i
[34:05] am a prisoner of jesus
[34:08] i'm his prisoner i am bound to him it's
[34:11] for the cause of christ
[34:13] that i that i am faith is to the cause
[34:15] of christ that i am faithful because i'm
[34:17] a prisoner of jesus christ for you
[34:19] gentiles
[34:21] not even for his own good
[34:23] he could look at it this way that i must
[34:24] live this way i must suffer these things
[34:26] why must i suffer these things why why
[34:28] must i do this for the gentile sake
[34:31] not his own paul wasn't over there going
[34:32] oh my i'm really racking up the points
[34:35] and mileage in heaven right
[34:37] wasn't solely the rewards program that
[34:39] was motivating him but he saw that there
[34:41] was a reward and seen that others hear
[34:43] the gospel and be blessed by it and be
[34:44] turned to it
[34:47] and so paul is advocating for christ
[34:50] and he teaches us be followers of me
[34:52] he teaches us to follow the example of
[34:54] christ
[34:55] and christ spoke not of himself sought
[34:58] not his own will sought not his own
[35:00] glory
[35:02] i'm asking you individually now can you
[35:03] understand
[35:05] how this relates to advocating
[35:08] what are you giving what do you voice
[35:09] and support for what do you what is it
[35:11] you're lifting up is it the word or is
[35:12] it your personal opinion or is it
[35:14] something that you'd benefit the most
[35:15] from
[35:17] anymore i really it's really hard to
[35:18] trust people when they go out and say oh
[35:20] you you really really should invest in
[35:22] this stock you you should really go all
[35:24] in on this you think oh oh they they've
[35:26] they've bought some puts on this
[35:29] right or someone says oh this stock's
[35:31] gonna you know this is gonna happen
[35:32] that's gonna happen you know there may
[35:34] be there they're short on it right
[35:36] there's a reason there's a motive beyond
[35:37] you can't really trust them because they
[35:39] seek their own
[35:41] now we in first corinthians chapter 9
[35:43] verses 19 to 23 and i'm
[35:49] this is uh hopefully we'll just kind of
[35:51] give us the ramp that we need to finish
[35:53] this is our text but i'm going to read
[35:55] it this time from the living bible and
[35:58] don't get nervous i i've fully vetted
[36:01] this i believe it conforms with what
[36:02] paul was saying
[36:04] but reading from the living bible hey
[36:05] i'd even say there's somewhere we get
[36:07] dogmatic right you read from your king
[36:09] james bible and somebody reads to you
[36:11] from something else like is that the
[36:12] king james
[36:13] like well no
[36:15] i was just reading from you know the
[36:17] living bible and they're like oh well
[36:19] sorry
[36:20] relax
[36:22] relax it's gonna be okay
[36:24] i mean you realize that there's people
[36:25] in other countries that read it in
[36:27] different languages and it's not
[36:28] necessarily king james
[36:30] god's looking out after the revelation
[36:31] of it
[36:32] even there's been times that i've
[36:34] preached and it's translated into french
[36:35] and i'm in i'm in psalms and i said you
[36:37] know psalms
[36:38] 21 and the guy's like i read it first
[36:40] i'm like psalms 21 21 now just read it
[36:43] first and it's like well why why do you
[36:44] want me to read it i'm telling you what
[36:45] to read he's like because our bible's
[36:47] different
[36:48] your verse doesn't match up with our
[36:50] verse it's different you're like okay
[36:51] let's let all those semantics go and all
[36:53] these dogmas and all these creeds we
[36:55] have about it let the words speak to our
[36:56] hearts
[36:57] and so i'm willing to be corrected if
[37:00] there's anything that's spoken in a
[37:01] translation or something that doesn't
[37:03] harmonize with what we believe to be the
[37:05] truth i believe that this conveys the
[37:07] attitude of paul follow along now he
[37:09] says when i am with the jews i see him
[37:11] as one of them so they will listen to
[37:13] the gospel and i can win them to christ
[37:16] notice his nature now
[37:19] he's not confrontational
[37:21] with him
[37:22] and the reason why he's not engaging
[37:24] them in fisticuffs and drawing the sword
[37:26] and you guys have done this and you guys
[37:27] have done that
[37:28] he wants to
[37:30] have a rapport with him in such a way
[37:31] that they'll be willing to listen to
[37:32] what he has to say
[37:33] when i'm with gentiles who follow jewish
[37:35] customs and ceremonies i don't argue
[37:37] even though i don't agree
[37:40] because i want to help them
[37:42] and with the heathen i agree with them
[37:44] as much as i can except of course that i
[37:46] must always do what is right as a
[37:48] christian
[37:49] this is very good
[37:50] uh principles do we realize that there's
[37:52] sometimes we can really get our gander
[37:53] up very quick with people oh well
[37:56] and we take a stand real quick and we've
[37:58] alienated ourselves
[38:00] like they're not they're not going to
[38:01] listen to a thing you have to say now
[38:03] because you've kind of you've got hopped
[38:04] on your hobby horse or your pet peeve
[38:06] and it actually is what contrary to
[38:08] their pet peeve and now you're perceived
[38:09] as an enemy and the only thing they're
[38:11] going to think of the rest of the time
[38:12] is they're trying to make me a vegan
[38:13] they're trying to make me a vegan
[38:14] they're trying to make i can't have corn
[38:16] fed beef anymore and you're like oh no
[38:17] no i'm talking about christ yeah but
[38:18] what's your endgame
[38:20] you're gonna use jesus to get me to
[38:22] switch to doterra
[38:24] you can pull this young living out of my
[38:26] cold dead hands
[38:29] right we have to be careful not to get
[38:31] into chems he says and so by agreeing i
[38:33] can win their confidence and help them
[38:35] too this is the ethos of paul this is
[38:37] his rationale this is his mindset when
[38:39] i'm with those whose conscience bothers
[38:41] them easily i don't act as though i know
[38:43] it all
[38:46] i'm going to read that again give
[38:47] everyone an opportunity to say amen as
[38:48] if they already know this
[38:50] i don't act as if i know it all
[38:52] and don't say they are foolish
[38:54] the result is is they're willing to let
[38:56] me help them
[38:58] i mean this is wisdom this is real
[39:00] wisdom and zig ziglar doesn't have it
[39:01] all right these guys out there who tell
[39:04] you how to win friends and insults
[39:05] people i mean this is this is gospel
[39:07] instruction on how to be successful in
[39:10] personal relationships and witnessing
[39:11] the message yes whatever a person is
[39:13] like i tried to find common ground with
[39:15] him so that he'll let me tell him about
[39:17] christ and let christ save him if he
[39:20] likes fish and talk to him about fishing
[39:22] find common bases find common ground i
[39:25] do this to get the gospel to them and
[39:27] also for the blessing i myself receive
[39:29] when i see them come to christ where is
[39:31] his blessing not and be able to say oh i
[39:33] passed out a bible and i witnessed to a
[39:35] person but his reward is when he sees
[39:37] that it's effective
[39:38] so it's not just knocking on doors it's
[39:40] not just sending out passing out tracks
[39:41] it's not just getting somebody to listen
[39:43] to something but it's accurately
[39:45] conveying faithfully conveying the word
[39:47] of god so that it can bless them they
[39:50] can receive it and then he is blessed
[39:52] when he sees that they come to christ
[39:54] and this is
[39:57] paul
[39:58] saying that he is following christ this
[39:59] is the example of christ in his public
[40:01] ministry this is paul's ministry but
[40:04] this isn't just paul's approach this is
[40:06] the approach of christ
[40:08] as he said follow me as he says in
[40:10] chapter 11 follow me as i follow christ
[40:12] this is the example of christ in the
[40:14] example that christ set in his own
[40:16] public ministry not serving himself but
[40:18] serving others therefore we do what we
[40:20] don't serve ourselves we serve others
[40:23] paul was saying that i forget my own
[40:24] interest i forget my own convenience i
[40:26] forget about my own comforts i labor i
[40:28] serve and i do the things that i do that
[40:30] the gospel might be effective to others
[40:33] as i mentioned wednesday night this
[40:34] isn't paul who is just a conflict he was
[40:36] a passive aggressive or you wanted to
[40:38] avoid conflict this wasn't conflict
[40:40] avoidance
[40:42] when paul made these decisions it wasn't
[40:44] because i'm not a confrontationalist and
[40:46] i don't like to argue and when things
[40:47] get tense i i i'm not really comfortable
[40:50] i'll actually maybe address it wednesday
[40:51] night paul was not afraid
[40:54] not afraid to make the stand in the
[40:55] right instance paul was not afraid to
[40:57] speak out things that needed to be
[40:58] spoken even in this very book what is he
[41:00] doing he's correcting the corinthians in
[41:02] second quincy hey i hope you don't feel
[41:03] like i was too hard i actually realized
[41:05] i wasn't too hard because you did what i
[41:06] asked you to do and he's actually
[41:07] writing a letter to try to amend things
[41:10] bring them back together to restore
[41:11] their his own relationship and their
[41:13] confidence in him he's very careful to
[41:14] be sure that he hadn't offended him why
[41:16] because he addressed the situation he
[41:18] wasn't afraid to address the situation
[41:21] i will say this we as believers should
[41:23] be very very careful not to confront a
[41:25] situation because there's a difference
[41:27] between addressing it and confronting it
[41:29] confrontation leads to escalation
[41:32] but if you address it it can lead to
[41:34] resolution it can resolve the issue
[41:37] so
[41:39] he uh
[41:40] what paul desired to see was that the
[41:41] gospel would be successful
[41:44] and what he's expressing here when i'm
[41:46] with the jews i see him as one of them
[41:47] when i'm with the gentiles who observe
[41:49] the law i don't argue with him i see him
[41:50] as one of them when i'm with those who
[41:51] are weak i'm weak he mentions all these
[41:53] different classes of people and he's
[41:55] saying i'm acting so that i don't alarm
[41:57] their prejudice
[41:59] i'm acting in such a way to where i
[42:01] don't stir up their opposition to me
[42:04] if i'm talking to a jew they're a jew
[42:06] i'm a christian
[42:07] so i don't want to approach them in such
[42:09] a way to immediately i stir up their
[42:10] opposition to the gospel
[42:13] i don't when i'm talking to a gentile
[42:15] who still observes the law here i'm a
[42:17] jew who's converted from the law and now
[42:20] i don't want to stir him he's actually
[42:21] going to and he deals with circumcision
[42:23] he's saying hey you know it's a
[42:24] circumcision of the heart and they're
[42:25] not necessarily in one instance this is
[42:27] where maybe i'm getting into a wednesday
[42:29] night a little bit he addressed a
[42:30] certain situation a certain way then
[42:32] addressed it another way and then when
[42:34] he did it he's looking at the impact and
[42:36] the effect of the gospel
[42:38] and so he's thinking i don't want to
[42:40] stir up stir up the opposition
[42:43] uh if he was going to sit down and he
[42:45] was going to be witness to
[42:47] uh to the catholic
[42:49] his leading is not going to be like you
[42:51] know he's the antichrist right
[42:54] because what's that going to do to a
[42:56] catholic oh i didn't know
[43:00] who's jesus what do we need to do
[43:02] immediately you're gonna be like they're
[43:03] gonna be like oh
[43:04] i mean the pope he's the vicar of christ
[43:06] we oh no no no you gotta you gotta see
[43:08] this she's the mother harlot man
[43:10] let me look at this 666 and sitting on
[43:12] the hill and like you're going to walk
[43:13] them through
[43:14] issues two babylons right then we're
[43:16] going to start off with that
[43:18] and and if they don't even know you
[43:19] excuse me again can i just get my fries
[43:22] all right my pleasure all right they go
[43:23] back
[43:24] and they get your fries like man they
[43:25] were telling me the pope is you know the
[43:27] antichrist
[43:29] and all i wanted was a you know more
[43:30] french fries they didn't give me my
[43:31] large fry at chick-fil-a
[43:33] and so we there's this paul was saying
[43:35] i'm not going to just stir up their
[43:36] prejudice
[43:37] i'm not going to act in such a way that
[43:39] alarms them and causes them to be on the
[43:40] defensive and and even makes them feel
[43:43] this condemnation like i think i'm
[43:45] better than them
[43:47] but in the love of christ he
[43:48] condescended to their prejudices
[43:51] in the love of christ not the love of
[43:53] man merely and not just the the his
[43:55] wanting to be accepted in every single
[43:57] circle he condescended to their
[43:59] prejudice as an advocate for christ
[44:02] he never leaves that out of view when he
[44:04] said i'm acting this way i'm acting this
[44:05] way they may be they may be saved to
[44:07] christ i did this that they might be
[44:08] saved to christ if you're just doing it
[44:10] because you want a free ex you want
[44:12] something free at a restaurant the wrong
[44:13] reason
[44:14] if you're doing it because you just want
[44:16] to fit in and you want to cover all your
[44:17] bases wrong reason
[44:19] because notice what he says in first
[44:20] corinthians chapter 8 verse 13 wherefore
[44:22] i if meat make my brother to offend if
[44:25] what i eat offends my brother notice how
[44:28] like demonstrative he is and emphatic i
[44:30] will eat no flesh while the world
[44:32] standeth
[44:33] lest i make my brother to offend
[44:36] so there's maybe justification for
[44:38] exaggeration whenever we get real
[44:40] emphatic
[44:41] and say i don't care if you run a
[44:42] hundred thousand miles you know well i'm
[44:44] not gonna be able to run a hundred
[44:45] thousand miles
[44:47] but paul was saying the same thing i'll
[44:48] eat no flesh by the world standing being
[44:50] very very
[44:51] exaggerated exaggerated in a sense to
[44:53] make the point if it me defends my
[44:55] brother i won't eat meat
[44:58] that was easy wasn't it
[45:00] i will i don't want to offend my brother
[45:01] now there's much more emphasis in that
[45:04] than just
[45:05] meat it has something to do with things
[45:07] offered to idols
[45:09] but he's he's declaring something here
[45:10] if there's a sensitivity
[45:12] that's going to cause a stumbling block
[45:14] look this is this is something that's
[45:15] not going to if you eat if you eat this
[45:18] if i eat meat
[45:19] i mean all i got you mean all i got to
[45:20] do is abstain from eating meat to not
[45:22] offend my brother and he's saying all
[45:23] right then i can do that
[45:26] but if you ask me to begin to preach
[45:28] something different and to say something
[45:29] different compromising the word that's
[45:30] where he'd say no sorry i can't do it
[45:33] he addresses it this way in romans
[45:35] chapter 15 verses 1 to 3 when we then
[45:38] that are strong ought to bear the
[45:39] infirmities of the weak
[45:41] and not to please ourselves
[45:44] one of the initial series that we
[45:45] started a year ago in september when
[45:46] this church began having regular
[45:48] services was who is my neighbor
[45:51] we recognized just how deep
[45:54] this principle was to love our neighbor
[45:56] as ourselves and how much that would
[45:57] guide our conduct
[45:59] so he's saying those that are strong
[46:01] ought to bear the infirmities of the
[46:03] weak and not to please ourselves
[46:06] and it's not so much when someone is
[46:07] sick you want to bring them chicken soup
[46:09] but rather if someone has a weakness in
[46:11] their mind and some sort of hardship or
[46:14] something that's very difficult for them
[46:15] that we ought to help them in it and not
[46:18] just act to please ourselves to become
[46:20] to feel more righteous and to feel that
[46:22] we're better than somebody else and make
[46:23] them to feel foolish he's saying we
[46:25] ought to be sensitive and those of us
[46:27] of us who are strong bear the
[46:29] infirmities of the weak not to please
[46:31] ourselves
[46:32] let every one of us please his neighbor
[46:34] for his good
[46:36] to edification
[46:39] for even christ please not himself
[46:42] but as it is written the reproaches of
[46:44] them that reproach they fell on me
[46:46] this is very good this is very good
[46:48] teaching he's saying that let us not
[46:49] please ourselves but let us please our
[46:51] neighbor for his
[46:53] good edification there's kind of the
[46:54] boundary says well my neighbor told me
[46:56] to get high with him
[46:57] i didn't want to make him angry no he
[46:59] said to please your his neighbor for his
[47:02] good edification you realize that means
[47:05] sometimes we can say no
[47:08] because it's for their good edification
[47:10] when family member asks us to do
[47:11] something our neighbor asks us to do
[47:12] something we're feeling pressured to do
[47:14] something like oh maybe i should just
[47:16] please him no do you realize that your
[47:17] abstinence or your stand in the right
[47:19] nature and right character christ in
[47:21] that instance is for his good
[47:23] edification
[47:24] you're declaring something no we don't
[47:26] believe in this and no that's not what
[47:27] we do and that's against my conviction
[47:29] and so do you realize why it's very
[47:31] important to not be dramatic dogmatic
[47:33] where god allows differences but to be
[47:34] dogmatic where god doesn't allow
[47:37] differences
[47:40] for even christ please not himself be
[47:42] followers of me as i am of christ
[47:45] so we looked at chapter nine we read it
[47:46] from the living bible now i will read
[47:48] from the king james in chapter 10 verses
[47:50] 27 to 33
[47:53] if any of them that believe not bid you
[47:55] to a feast
[47:56] and you be disposed to go if you want to
[47:58] go
[47:59] whatsoever is set before you eat asking
[48:03] no question for conscience sake this is
[48:06] what we try to teach our children
[48:08] eat what you're served we try to do this
[48:10] at home eat what you're served why
[48:12] because we don't want to go to someone's
[48:13] house be invited over for dinner and
[48:16] then something is served and our kids
[48:17] like uh what is this and now everyone's
[48:20] embarrassed and it's like oh um it's
[48:23] chicken liver
[48:25] and it's this oh i don't eat that we
[48:27] don't eat that i don't like this i don't
[48:28] like that you want to teach them eat
[48:29] with their eat what they're served in
[48:31] some ways maybe paul is espousing the
[48:33] same virtue he says that if you're bid
[48:35] to feast and you go sit down to someone
[48:37] who's not a believer
[48:38] so in this instance what's the worry
[48:40] well is this meat been sacrificed to
[48:41] idols should i eat this meat or not was
[48:43] it you know how was it bled out what
[48:44] kind of meat is it he's saying whatever
[48:46] you're served just eat
[48:48] he says don't ask
[48:50] can you imagine that don't ask what's in
[48:52] this now i understand brother mike you
[48:53] might want to find out whether or not
[48:54] there's peanuts in it because he has a
[48:56] nut allergy but in this instance and
[48:58] that's life or death right it wouldn't
[48:59] be too as good out of edification to
[49:00] scarf down peanut sauce
[49:02] uh to not offend the magiris
[49:04] but this is a situation where hey it's
[49:07] it's it's meat that may have been
[49:08] sacrificed to idols and instead of being
[49:10] invited over to dinner and saying
[49:13] oh we're having beef well was it
[49:16] sacrificed to idols
[49:18] what market did you get it from oh i
[49:19] only get my meat from sprouts hey you
[49:21] don't ask so just eat what's set before
[49:23] you he says but if any man say unto you
[49:25] this is offered in sacrifice unto idols
[49:28] eat not for his sake that showed it
[49:31] and for conscience sake
[49:34] now what he's saying is here's one who
[49:36] has a um
[49:38] has his conviction that if something's
[49:39] been offered to idols in his mind he may
[49:42] still think that this idol had this
[49:43] influence over this meat so he's real
[49:45] suspicious of this meat oh it's been
[49:47] sacrificed to idols and maybe he still
[49:49] doesn't understand that there's no life
[49:50] in those idols there's no power in those
[49:52] idols that there's powers in in christ
[49:55] there's power in the name of jesus and
[49:56] that even in blessing things and
[49:58] sanctifying it he could partake in this
[50:00] meat but now you knowing better
[50:03] instead of saying ah you i can't believe
[50:05] you're so sensitive
[50:07] you just grab the tomahawk ribeye and
[50:09] start eating it you go oh oh this was
[50:11] sacrificed to idols okay and you refrain
[50:14] from eating for his conscience sake
[50:16] right
[50:18] no you because you could take the
[50:19] liberty and it doesn't bother you so it
[50:21] may not bother you or it may bother you
[50:23] but it doesn't bother me paul is saying
[50:25] hey just take a chill pill just relax
[50:27] don't get all self-righteous don't try
[50:28] to make this the hill you're going to
[50:29] die on take a step back and say oh well
[50:31] maybe we shouldn't eat here
[50:34] you're going to ask somebody to go out
[50:35] to dinner and say hey you want to go eat
[50:37] where do you want to go well we're
[50:38] thinking of going to applebee's like ah
[50:39] you know what i don't really feel like
[50:40] going there they got a lot of tvs and
[50:42] they always play rock and roll music
[50:43] like oh what are you huh apply the token
[50:46] to applebee's now
[50:48] and we start getting all upset with
[50:49] somebody and trash talking oh does it
[50:51] bother you do you have a problem with
[50:52] the television and and all of a sudden
[50:54] we start running somebody down because
[50:56] they would much rather go to ihop
[50:57] because there's no music being played
[50:59] it's like hey if that offends you if
[51:00] you're sensitive that
[51:02] don't die on that mountain
[51:04] don't pick the fight
[51:08] he says not for
[51:09] for conscience sake for the earth is the
[51:11] lord's and the fullness thereof what has
[51:13] he just said
[51:15] really at the end of the day there's
[51:16] nothing wrong with that mead
[51:19] they say conscience i say not thine own
[51:21] but of the other
[51:23] for why is my liberty judge of another
[51:25] man's conscience this is kind of what he
[51:27] i think he's asking the question on
[51:29] you know that maybe even someone else
[51:31] might say but he's also saying why would
[51:32] i let another man's conscience judge my
[51:35] uh moderate my liberty
[51:37] for if i buy grace be a partaker why am
[51:39] i evil spoke enough for that which i
[51:41] give thanks so much if i eat something
[51:44] and i'm spoken evil of i've prayed over
[51:46] it i've asked gave him thanks it's
[51:47] blessed i should be able to eat it but
[51:49] now someone who's offended may say
[51:50] something
[51:51] he says
[51:52] whether therefore you eat or drink or
[51:54] whatsoever you do do all to the glory of
[51:56] god
[51:57] so what are we keeping in view what are
[51:59] we thinking how does this promote the
[52:00] gospel how does this edify the body of
[52:02] christ how are my decisions how are my
[52:04] posts how are my attitudes how are my
[52:05] bumper stickers how are the things that
[52:07] i'm espousing and advocating for how
[52:09] does this glorify god
[52:12] he says give none offense neither to the
[52:15] jews nor to the gentiles nor to the
[52:17] church of god
[52:19] give no offense in these indifferent
[52:20] things give no offense in these personal
[52:23] things give no offense in these these
[52:24] things that you hold as your own
[52:25] personal conviction he says even as i
[52:27] please all men in all things not seeking
[52:30] my own prophet but the profit of many
[52:32] that they may be saved paul why would
[52:34] you let another man judge your liberty
[52:36] you prayed over it you should be able to
[52:38] eat whatever you want he says the reason
[52:40] why i don't do it the reason why i would
[52:42] abstain is that in abstaining i am more
[52:45] effective as a witness of what really
[52:47] matters
[52:49] i'm more effective as a witness of the
[52:50] things that really really count that if
[52:52] i'm a stickler about everything and i'm
[52:54] picking on everything and when it comes
[52:56] time to witness to my co-worker about
[52:58] baptism in the name of jesus christ they
[52:59] kind of just look and say well you're
[53:00] just a legalist anyways you've been
[53:02] split hair since the time you showed up
[53:03] here
[53:05] and then you try to talk about something
[53:06] that's really weighty something that
[53:07] really matters and it's kind of like
[53:09] well you your voice means nothing to me
[53:11] anymore
[53:13] they'll even question the very source of
[53:15] it
[53:17] is anybody else freezing cold this
[53:19] morning
[53:20] it means freezing cold can we turn the
[53:21] heat on but scott and brother john can
[53:24] you help with uh
[53:25] this one over here i don't stop
[53:26] preaching till i sweat and i'm up here
[53:28] dry as a bone
[53:30] i don't know if that was by choice i
[53:32] usually preach till i run out of water
[53:34] or until i start sweating
[53:39] that was a joke i don't have either of
[53:41] those as a
[53:43] some sort of guy you never you know
[53:44] sometimes my kids you say something in
[53:46] jess and they remind you years later
[53:47] that well you said you did this i was
[53:49] like
[53:50] did
[53:52] i don't know if they know this but i
[53:53] have
[53:55] i've traveled around the sun 45 46 times
[53:57] did you know that
[53:59] i've traveled around the sun's 46 times
[54:00] like wow he did that and he can't even
[54:02] get the garage clean
[54:05] now notice this in
[54:07] the living bible
[54:09] if someone who isn't a christian ask you
[54:10] to go out to dinner go ahead
[54:12] accept the invitation if you want to eat
[54:14] whatever's on the table and don't ask
[54:16] any questions about it unless you have
[54:17] an allergy then you won't know whether
[54:19] or not it's been used as a sacrifice to
[54:21] idols and you won't risk having a bad
[54:23] conscience overeating it
[54:26] but if someone warned you and what does
[54:28] and what who whose conscience are you
[54:30] afraid of offended in this situation
[54:32] the unbeliever you sit down to eat with
[54:34] because wouldn't you want your life to
[54:36] witness to him and if you immediately
[54:38] alienate them and make them feel guilty
[54:40] about eating meat because of your
[54:43] staunch position on something that paul
[54:45] is saying it's indifferent the word is
[54:47] indifferent about this
[54:49] then you become less effective
[54:51] i know i'm really belaboring this point
[54:53] but i want you i want the holy spirit to
[54:55] be able to amplify this in your own
[54:56] hearts
[54:57] make it applicable in your own life i
[54:59] don't know everyone's situations i can
[55:01] maybe guess as to some i know our own
[55:03] and there may be things that i could
[55:04] think of in our family that we could be
[55:05] less dogmatic about and less legalistic
[55:08] about for the sake of of not offending
[55:11] so we can be effective witnesses and so
[55:13] that we can help and instead of harm
[55:14] there's a way that we all might be
[55:16] challenged on different levels but i'm
[55:17] wanting just the word to be spoken over
[55:19] you and let that wash your spirits and
[55:21] align you correctly
[55:23] and so he says then you won't know
[55:24] whether or not it's been used as a
[55:26] sacrifice to idols and you won't risk
[55:27] having a bad conscience over eating it
[55:29] but if someone warns you that this
[55:31] meat's been offered to idols then don't
[55:32] eat it for the sake of the man who told
[55:34] you and of his conscience in this case
[55:37] his feeling about it is the important
[55:39] thing not yours
[55:42] not beautiful
[55:44] but why you may ask must i be guided and
[55:47] limited by what someone else thinks
[55:50] this really starts hitting home well why
[55:52] should it matter what somebody else
[55:53] thinks
[55:54] if i can thank god for the food and
[55:56] enjoy it why let someone spoil
[55:58] everything just because he thinks i'm
[56:00] wrong
[56:01] well i'll tell you why
[56:03] it is because you must do everything for
[56:05] the glory of god even your eating and
[56:07] drinking
[56:09] powerful is put that way isn't it
[56:11] you should do everything for the glory
[56:13] of god you should give thought to the
[56:15] things you voice support for and
[56:16] advocate for in everything even your
[56:19] eating and drinking
[56:20] so don't be a stumbling block to anyone
[56:24] whether they're jews or gentiles or
[56:26] christians don't be a stumbling block to
[56:28] anyone don't offend don't we know what
[56:30] jesus said about what happens if you
[56:31] offend
[56:33] he says that is the plan i follow too i
[56:35] try to please everyone in everything i
[56:37] do not doing what i like or what is best
[56:39] for me but what is best for them so that
[56:42] they may be saved
[56:46] why do you do it because of christ
[56:49] why do you do it that christ might be
[56:51] effective why did that i might be an
[56:53] effective witness this is why we even
[56:55] jesus said i sanctify myself for your
[56:58] sakes
[56:59] jesus didn't need to sanctify himself
[57:01] for his own sake but there was
[57:03] sanctification that he brought it made
[57:05] himself subject to for the sake of
[57:07] others and we likewise should have the
[57:09] same mindset that just because we might
[57:11] have liberties and we might have our
[57:13] rights and these are our rights and
[57:14] listen do you realize that's the trap
[57:16] allele to see it your rights
[57:18] this is my right i've got a right to do
[57:20] this this is my god-given right
[57:23] and we want to exercise our god-given
[57:26] rights and paul is saying well
[57:28] maybe you should do all things to the
[57:29] glory of god
[57:31] maybe that's what should guide you
[57:33] that's what should motivate you
[57:35] if you read in paul's gospels it's
[57:36] amazing he had power of making himself
[57:38] at home with all sorts of classes of
[57:40] people
[57:40] all races all degrees of men he can make
[57:44] himself at home
[57:46] he never alienated another class of
[57:47] people the poor were at home with him
[57:48] christ even was able to do it
[57:51] he was at home with the sinners and the
[57:52] publicans but yet could be invited into
[57:54] another man's home who is a of high
[57:56] degree
[57:57] and paul had the ability to not offend
[57:59] over many different degrees of men
[58:02] and while keeping the word it's
[58:03] important to understand that paul never
[58:05] transgressed the word he says this i do
[58:08] i do is one who is under the law but yet
[58:11] but yet not forsaking the cause of
[58:13] christ and i'm as one without the law
[58:15] but still under the law of christ while
[58:17] faithfully keeping the word of god he
[58:19] adapted himself to all men
[58:23] and why did he how why did he adapt why
[58:25] did he accommodate
[58:27] in the hope of gaining them
[58:30] i'll adapt in this situation
[58:32] to see that it's effect that might what
[58:34] i believe in could be effective for this
[58:35] person i will i will accommodate so in
[58:38] the hopes of saving them
[58:41] and so all his discipline all his
[58:43] self-denial even with christ and paul i
[58:45] want you to understand this he did it
[58:47] with one single objection objective in
[58:50] mind don't forget this
[58:52] the promotion of the gospel
[58:55] because immediately we could start
[58:56] thinking oh
[58:58] cool i can start doing this so i don't
[58:59] offend my neighbor and oh cool i could
[59:01] do this so i don't offend my family and
[59:02] oh we can dabble in this and we can mix
[59:04] in that and brother aaron's saying that
[59:06] we can kind of
[59:07] get be a little less sanctified
[59:10] so that we don't offend anyone that's
[59:12] clearly not what's being said
[59:15] he recognized
[59:17] that he could accommodate certain things
[59:20] and not be in their face and not be
[59:22] abrasive and not stir up their
[59:23] prejudices and not stir up their
[59:25] opposition to him for the promotion of
[59:28] the gospel
[59:30] so we likewise can moderate our behavior
[59:32] and moderate the things we say and
[59:34] moderate the voice things we lend our
[59:35] voice to so it's the sake of not
[59:37] alienating anyone but as long as we're
[59:39] not just trying to hide our christianity
[59:42] but that our christianity can be the
[59:43] most effective
[59:46] let me let me say this
[59:48] i i believe that we ought not to be
[59:49] afraid to call ourselves christians
[59:52] i believe that we ought to say that we
[59:53] we are we are christians that this is
[59:55] christianity
[59:57] and and though it may be a term that has
[59:58] been borrowed i believe that you are
[1:00:00] true christians
[1:00:02] and we identify as christians and we
[1:00:04] don't need to give ourselves any other
[1:00:05] nomination to identify who we are we are
[1:00:08] christians
[1:00:09] we are bearers of the life of christ we
[1:00:11] are manifest in the nature and character
[1:00:13] of christ therefore i have a
[1:00:14] responsibility to
[1:00:16] follow what i'm saying here not to make
[1:00:18] the message look good and not to make
[1:00:20] the messenger look good but to represent
[1:00:23] christ fairly
[1:00:27] because this message is christ
[1:00:31] and i say this then as advocates for
[1:00:33] christ should not we regulate our own
[1:00:34] conduct
[1:00:36] in light of the same purpose
[1:00:38] should this not be some sort of guiding
[1:00:40] principle and i don't mean that we'd
[1:00:41] have these lists of rules and
[1:00:42] regulations that whenever we would find
[1:00:44] ourselves walking into a situation like
[1:00:46] okay what can i do in this situation
[1:00:47] what can i do in this situation we look
[1:00:49] like a quarterback who's getting the
[1:00:50] call in from the sidelines we're having
[1:00:51] to look on the cheat sheet to figure out
[1:00:53] what play we're calling it's not this
[1:00:55] real uptight real tense thing we're
[1:00:57] doing we're just saying lord i want to
[1:00:58] be like you
[1:01:00] i want to follow your nature i want to
[1:01:01] do things the right way i want to i want
[1:01:03] to be an effective witness don't you
[1:01:04] want to see someone else saved
[1:01:07] this church has been holding regular
[1:01:09] services for one year we've seen the
[1:01:10] lord touch lives we've seen people who
[1:01:12] were backslid we've seen people who had
[1:01:14] rejected things of god we've seen the
[1:01:16] lord restore people i i desire to see
[1:01:19] people be impacted by this message
[1:01:22] not just carve art out carve out our
[1:01:24] little niche and do these little top
[1:01:25] secret missions into these other places
[1:01:27] and steal people out of other people's
[1:01:29] assemblies and hope that other churches
[1:01:31] fail that so we can benefit by it let's
[1:01:33] go out and save the lost
[1:01:37] count those that have been born here
[1:01:41] let's have this desire to
[1:01:43] regulate our conduct for the promotion
[1:01:46] of the gospel
[1:01:48] just as paul didn't do it we should not
[1:01:50] insist on our rights and privileges that
[1:01:52] hinder the cause of christ
[1:01:54] you may have certain rights you may have
[1:01:56] certain privileges but we ought not to
[1:01:57] insist on them if they'll somehow hinder
[1:02:00] the cause of christ
[1:02:02] and it's true as it says in the
[1:02:04] scripture we could look at it in first
[1:02:05] corinthians chapter 10
[1:02:07] verses 23 and 24
[1:02:10] the abuse of your liberty in christ
[1:02:12] leads to destruction not edification
[1:02:15] your abuse of it oh i'm free i can do
[1:02:17] this
[1:02:18] but you can abuse your liberty
[1:02:20] and it'll result in destruction
[1:02:23] but our our goal our objective
[1:02:25] is edification of the body of christ
[1:02:27] through salvation and sanctification
[1:02:30] that's what we want to do we want to
[1:02:31] edify the body of christ through
[1:02:32] salvation that there would be those
[1:02:33] added to it and then edify the body
[1:02:35] through our own sanctification through
[1:02:37] our serving of it and that's our
[1:02:39] objective
[1:02:41] so paul notice this is in the context
[1:02:43] first corinthians chapter 9
[1:02:45] we read how that he became all things to
[1:02:47] all men
[1:02:48] first corinthians chapter 10 he said
[1:02:50] that he pleases all men in all things
[1:02:53] what for the promotion of the gospel
[1:02:55] that they may be saved the gospel may be
[1:02:57] benefited it's in the middle of this
[1:02:59] that he makes this statement all things
[1:03:01] are lawful to me but all things are not
[1:03:03] expedient all things are lawful for me
[1:03:06] but all things edify not
[1:03:09] it's not even a question of his own
[1:03:10] edification it's not even a question
[1:03:12] alone of his own expediency but it's the
[1:03:16] edification of others and the expediency
[1:03:18] to which the gospel's being conveyed to
[1:03:20] their hearts he's saying yeah i've got a
[1:03:22] lot of rights i got a lot of privileges
[1:03:23] i got a lot of things i should i can do
[1:03:25] like i should be able to sit down and
[1:03:26] eat meat that i've asked god to bless
[1:03:28] and not let another man's weak
[1:03:29] conscience keep me from eating what i
[1:03:31] want and paul said that's completely
[1:03:33] within my right he says so why do you do
[1:03:35] it paulie goes will i do it that that
[1:03:36] person could be saved or their
[1:03:38] conscience not aggrieved because in this
[1:03:40] instance it's their conscience that
[1:03:42] means more than mine
[1:03:47] so he says let not let no man seek his
[1:03:50] own
[1:03:52] but every man another's wealth
[1:03:55] it's interesting isn't it
[1:03:56] welfare it's welfare
[1:03:59] let no man seek his own welfare alone
[1:04:02] but every
[1:04:03] in another man another man's welfare
[1:04:07] so paul is actually saying that he's
[1:04:08] really not coming to any conclusion
[1:04:10] about whether you should eat or eat
[1:04:12] certain foods or drink certain drinks
[1:04:14] he's not bringing a conclusion he's not
[1:04:16] drilling this down to say so therefore
[1:04:17] these are meats that are allowed these
[1:04:19] are meats that aren't he's kind of
[1:04:20] leaving that question alone in saying
[1:04:22] that we ought to be guided by our by
[1:04:24] what promotes the gospel
[1:04:27] in every situation be conscious of how
[1:04:29] can i be a most effective witness of
[1:04:31] what i believe
[1:04:32] and this is paul's cons prescription
[1:04:35] as it concerns our conduct's effect on
[1:04:37] others
[1:04:39] he's saying all things are lawful for us
[1:04:42] all things are lawful but not everything
[1:04:44] is expedient and not everything edifies
[1:04:46] so don't insist on your rights don't
[1:04:49] insist on your privileges if they don't
[1:04:51] edify the body of christ don't insist on
[1:04:54] exercising your rights if it brings an
[1:04:56] affront or an approach to a believer
[1:05:00] so he said in the matter of indifferent
[1:05:01] things don't seek to just satisfy your
[1:05:03] own desire don't seek to just satisfy
[1:05:04] your own passion don't seek to build
[1:05:06] your own consensus and advocate for
[1:05:08] yourself and things that are indifferent
[1:05:10] and things that the word doesn't speak
[1:05:11] to we have to moderate our conduct for
[1:05:13] the con for for the consciences of other
[1:05:15] people and for the sake of the gospel
[1:05:19] so he said our conduct takes into
[1:05:20] consideration the profit of others the
[1:05:22] welfare of others the edification of
[1:05:24] others
[1:05:25] look at philippians chapter 2.
[1:05:29] our advocacy for christ compels us
[1:05:31] compels us
[1:05:33] to be concerned about the welfare of
[1:05:35] others
[1:05:36] it's our advocacy for christ that
[1:05:38] restrains us from hurting other people
[1:05:41] we've said it before
[1:05:43] we've heard bride doesn't persecute
[1:05:44] bride why
[1:05:47] because bro it's not because bride knows
[1:05:48] everyone who's bride but because she
[1:05:50] doesn't persecute anybody
[1:05:52] she never persecutes bride
[1:05:55] so it's not that we can sit around and
[1:05:56] be like
[1:05:58] right not right right not bright not
[1:06:00] bright right not bright and we have a
[1:06:01] list that people we can persecute
[1:06:05] i'm so glad i'm so glad they fell away
[1:06:07] because now i can openly persecute them
[1:06:10] because clearly they're not bright no we
[1:06:11] don't persecute anyone
[1:06:13] it's not the spirit of christ it's not
[1:06:14] the nature of christ
[1:06:16] so we our advocacy compels us to not
[1:06:18] hurt others
[1:06:20] we're to consider how our how we are to
[1:06:22] act we think about how we're acting we
[1:06:24] think about what we live for what we
[1:06:25] support what we give our money to what
[1:06:27] we give our time to what we become
[1:06:29] characterized as with them leaving the
[1:06:31] holy spirit to deal with you in your own
[1:06:33] life and not become legalistic and put
[1:06:34] down a bunch of rules on how we ought to
[1:06:36] live and how we ought to act but we
[1:06:37] ought to consider how that we act so
[1:06:39] that we can help others not hinder them
[1:06:43] paul and i realize i want to read
[1:06:45] philippians 2 20 but i'm drawn back to
[1:06:46] what he says
[1:06:48] and all things are lawful for me
[1:06:50] but all things edify not
[1:06:53] it's easy to run into evil by accident
[1:06:56] when you pursue your rights
[1:06:58] you ponder that for a moment
[1:07:00] very easy to run into evil by accident
[1:07:03] when we pursue all rights and privileges
[1:07:05] that aren't plainly sinful right
[1:07:09] i'm gonna let you think about for a
[1:07:10] moment you could cue the jeopardy
[1:07:13] upon to this
[1:07:15] when we exercise all rights and all
[1:07:17] privileges in things that aren't plainly
[1:07:19] sinful that's when we can easily run
[1:07:21] into evil by accident
[1:07:24] was it say
[1:07:25] evil things have ruined thousands
[1:07:28] unlawful things ruined thousands
[1:07:30] lawfully things unlawfully used ten
[1:07:33] thousands
[1:07:35] where's the where's the real rub and the
[1:07:37] real the the area where god's starting
[1:07:40] to tighten up some of our lives it's not
[1:07:41] in the big things god's brought that
[1:07:44] hammer has
[1:07:45] chopped away so many things so here we
[1:07:47] sit today as born-again believers and
[1:07:50] loving the word of god and very faithful
[1:07:52] we've suffered such agitation of the
[1:07:54] last 15 years to where we know where we
[1:07:56] stand and we're real centered on truth
[1:07:58] and here we are and now these are things
[1:08:00] where the refiner is coming and he's
[1:08:02] very delicately chiseling things away
[1:08:04] from us and refining us because there's
[1:08:06] things that we hold to very personal
[1:08:07] these are my rights these are my
[1:08:09] privileges but yet if you pursue all
[1:08:11] rights and privileges and things that
[1:08:12] aren't obvious or plainfully sinful or
[1:08:15] things that seem to be indifferent we
[1:08:16] can accidentally run into evil and god
[1:08:18] is saying show up your lives buckle up a
[1:08:21] little bit you need to be more sincere
[1:08:25] we're going to go this way if we're
[1:08:26] going to take this find this last seed
[1:08:28] if we're going to go on a rapture we
[1:08:29] must be more sincere we must become more
[1:08:31] dedicated then a lot of times it's these
[1:08:33] areas where we feel we're a little bit
[1:08:34] loose in that we feel we have the
[1:08:35] liberty in that's causing us the problem
[1:08:40] he says for i have no man like mine in
[1:08:42] philippians 2 20 and 21
[1:08:44] who will naturally care for your state
[1:08:46] as he was sending i believe his titus i
[1:08:48] have no man like mine who will naturally
[1:08:50] care for your state
[1:08:51] for all seek their own not the things
[1:08:54] which are jesus christ
[1:08:56] that's not how we should live
[1:08:59] paul saying i'm sending someone to you
[1:09:02] who will look out after you i'm sending
[1:09:04] someone to you
[1:09:05] who is
[1:09:06] who's like-minded if i recall in
[1:09:08] particular
[1:09:10] that there wasn't just like anybody
[1:09:11] could help and anybody will do this
[1:09:13] because he didn't trust everybody
[1:09:15] i i took out some scriptures in first
[1:09:17] timothy and i'll read them wednesday
[1:09:19] night lord willing
[1:09:21] as paul is instructing timothy he was
[1:09:22] very deliberate in the way that he
[1:09:24] talked about certain things because he
[1:09:25] realized you know what there's some
[1:09:26] people that preach the gospel for their
[1:09:27] own benefit and he's actually saying you
[1:09:29] know what there's some people
[1:09:31] who are and i took this scripture out as
[1:09:33] well who are encouraged by the fact that
[1:09:35] i've been thrown into prison
[1:09:38] and are preaching the gospel
[1:09:40] the god the suppose in the gospel that
[1:09:42] paul is preaching he's saying there's
[1:09:44] people that preach these ways these
[1:09:45] people that preach these certain things
[1:09:47] and paul is saying there's not many who
[1:09:49] are like-minded
[1:09:50] who will preach the gospel unselfishly
[1:09:54] and desire to see that a son and or
[1:09:56] daughter
[1:09:57] know christ in a personal way and are
[1:09:59] led of his spirit and fulfill his will
[1:10:01] for their lives too many people are
[1:10:03] selfish and want to build consensus for
[1:10:06] their ideas want to build uh support for
[1:10:08] their policies and want to feel that
[1:10:10] they're a part of something and that
[1:10:11] their ministry or their ideals or their
[1:10:13] opinions or their beliefs or their
[1:10:15] church is thriving and successful and
[1:10:17] paul said there's so many people that
[1:10:19] seek their own and not the things which
[1:10:22] are jesus christ and what we ought to
[1:10:24] have in our hearts and what we should
[1:10:25] have at the core of our what our compass
[1:10:28] our moral compass and our ethics and
[1:10:30] what guides us is that we desire that
[1:10:32] men and women come to know that they are
[1:10:34] sons and daughters of god and that a
[1:10:36] real relationship with christ be
[1:10:38] established with god and that they find
[1:10:40] their value in him
[1:10:42] where they can be led of god and this
[1:10:44] word can be effective and the message
[1:10:45] can open up their lives and they can
[1:10:47] blossom why because we're advocates for
[1:10:49] jesus christ we do not seek our own but
[1:10:52] we seek those things which are christ we
[1:10:54] are advocates for
[1:10:57] let him close with this scripture john
[1:10:59] 10 27 my sheep hear my voice
[1:11:02] and i know them
[1:11:06] and they follow me
[1:11:09] i said wednesday night we are only sheep
[1:11:11] to christ
[1:11:14] ponder i've been pondering the subject
[1:11:15] that will prime minister on here soon of
[1:11:17] blind trust
[1:11:21] we are only sheep to christ
[1:11:24] jesus christ is our
[1:11:28] i like to find maybe a good word to use
[1:11:31] for it because
[1:11:32] jesus christ is our hero
[1:11:36] jesus christ is our role model
[1:11:39] jesus christ is our example
[1:11:42] he's the one that we're pattern our
[1:11:43] behavior after
[1:11:45] that it's that example that we look to
[1:11:47] it's that example that paul followed in
[1:11:51] so jesus christ sets the standard he
[1:11:53] sets this example
[1:11:54] paul is amplifying it
[1:11:57] so beautifully because now we look back
[1:11:59] and we see that jesus said follow me as
[1:12:01] i followed christ or jesus saying be
[1:12:03] therefore followers of me
[1:12:05] i'm quoting paul each time because
[1:12:06] that's what paul amplified jesus saying
[1:12:07] my sheep know my voice and they follow
[1:12:09] me
[1:12:10] be follow me follow me now paul is
[1:12:12] following christ and he's expressing
[1:12:14] these things
[1:12:15] philippians timothy corinthians all over
[1:12:17] he's expressing these things and what is
[1:12:19] he identifying the nature and character
[1:12:21] of christ
[1:12:23] whom he followed
[1:12:25] and he said i follow christ follow me as
[1:12:27] i follow christ and he was so faithful
[1:12:29] to the example of christ that he could
[1:12:31] say be there for followers of me as i am
[1:12:33] of god
[1:12:34] so he knew that he was being faithful in
[1:12:36] that duty to follow and that what he was
[1:12:38] preaching and what he was teaching was
[1:12:40] lifting up these principles and these
[1:12:42] aspects of christ this is what we here
[1:12:44] in the world today what would jesus do
[1:12:46] they don't even ask that question
[1:12:47] anymore you know what they want to know
[1:12:48] what would john wayne do
[1:12:52] it's true
[1:12:54] john wayne is more of a hero to message
[1:12:56] believers than jesus christ
[1:12:58] and i believe that as a reason why god
[1:13:01] preserved
[1:13:02] the the many different tapes he had
[1:13:03] because we have the example of christ
[1:13:05] paul followed that example and then one
[1:13:07] who preached the same gospel paul
[1:13:09] preached so once again you could see
[1:13:10] someone who lived the example of jesus
[1:13:13] christ and it doesn't have to fit this
[1:13:15] rugged man model or the right-wing
[1:13:17] conservative christian that everyone
[1:13:19] wants to idolize and become their hero
[1:13:21] we've had an example we've got a
[1:13:24] scripture to teach us we've got a word
[1:13:25] to teach us and guide us and jesus
[1:13:28] christ alone is the example by which we
[1:13:30] want to live
[1:13:34] paul was following christ's example and
[1:13:37] his meekness and concern for others paul
[1:13:39] was following the example of christ in
[1:13:41] his advocacy that men be saved
[1:13:44] invite the musicians to come i like this
[1:13:46] guy three that will come this time
[1:13:48] i'd like to invite you to come
[1:13:51] and and share this as
[1:13:54] maybe you're trying to just sum this up
[1:13:56] in my heart as i've walked through these
[1:13:58] things with you today
[1:14:00] the full gospel must be expressed in the
[1:14:02] character of christ
[1:14:05] in other words
[1:14:06] we don't want to just you can just say
[1:14:08] the word all you want or quote things or
[1:14:11] you know broadcast certain things
[1:14:13] but the full gospel
[1:14:15] it has to be expressed in christ's
[1:14:17] character
[1:14:20] you you want it to be conveyed you want
[1:14:22] to be a vessel is your life worthy of
[1:14:24] the gospel
[1:14:25] that was the question
[1:14:26] is your life reflective of it
[1:14:30] is it is it can you just act however you
[1:14:32] want and then at the end of the day
[1:14:33] justify it because you're a believer
[1:14:36] and like well i believe the truth don't
[1:14:37] i give me the word test give me the word
[1:14:39] test
[1:14:40] go ahead give it to me whatever brother
[1:14:42] bram said i believe in
[1:14:44] and it's like whoa i mean that's that's
[1:14:46] part
[1:14:47] we believe in the word for your day
[1:14:48] receiving your word for the day i i'm
[1:14:50] the kind of person i would never
[1:14:51] belittle that
[1:14:54] but that's not a get out of jail free
[1:14:55] card or that's not you can live however
[1:14:57] you want to say whatever you want do
[1:14:58] whatever you want act everyone be mean
[1:15:00] be rude be crass
[1:15:02] live unsanctified be disrespectful talk
[1:15:04] other people down
[1:15:06] persecute
[1:15:07] lie cheat still oh but
[1:15:10] believe every word
[1:15:12] right
[1:15:14] the gospel of christ has to be expressed
[1:15:16] in christ's character it has to be
[1:15:17] harmonized with the manner of life
[1:15:20] these things should not just be summed
[1:15:22] up in beliefs and opinions
[1:15:24] like this is what we believe this is my
[1:15:26] opinion
[1:15:27] but if you really believe something will
[1:15:29] you act on it
[1:15:31] if you really really believe that if
[1:15:33] you're really really concerned about
[1:15:34] something if you really if you're afraid
[1:15:36] let me just maybe just get real here
[1:15:38] because it's not i could even i realized
[1:15:40] as i was studying this last week it's
[1:15:41] like someone's going to ask me are you
[1:15:42] talking about masks brother aaron you
[1:15:43] talking about vaccines
[1:15:45] no but it's applicable
[1:15:48] if you're really concerned about people
[1:15:50] being led astray
[1:15:52] if you're really con
[1:15:54] concerned about people being deceived if
[1:15:56] you're really confused about people
[1:15:57] being harmed and being lined up into
[1:16:00] concentration camps and being subject to
[1:16:02] torture and people gonna be this is
[1:16:03] gonna happen too that's gonna be
[1:16:05] happening and you're going to liken
[1:16:06] what's happening today to something that
[1:16:07] happened in world war ii in nazi germany
[1:16:10] if you're worried about that what about
[1:16:12] those who are left behind for the
[1:16:13] tribulation do you care about them
[1:16:16] [Music]
[1:16:18] would you have a heart for them
[1:16:21] he said well man if i'm real i'm worried
[1:16:23] about our children suffocating at school
[1:16:26] maybe i should be worried about my
[1:16:27] my friends and my family who don't know
[1:16:29] this blessed gospel and truth because
[1:16:31] there's a greater tribulation coming
[1:16:33] and i'm not belittling anyone's personal
[1:16:35] stand on these things but think about
[1:16:37] what gets our righteous indignation up
[1:16:39] but meanwhile we can just kind of walk
[1:16:40] through laodicea of going look at all
[1:16:42] these people who are doomed for hell
[1:16:44] look at all this serpenty look at all
[1:16:45] these people who haven't heard the truth
[1:16:47] who rejected the message and act so
[1:16:49] calloused
[1:16:51] and act so like it doesn't even matter
[1:16:55] i trust you feel my heart this morning
[1:16:57] [Music]
[1:17:00] that we could we need to be more
[1:17:01] concerned about the cause of christ take
[1:17:04] our eyes away from the politics take our
[1:17:06] eyes away from all the pretense take our
[1:17:08] eyes away from all the things that are
[1:17:09] trying to distract us let people have
[1:17:11] their personal opinions and their
[1:17:12] personal convictions in things that are
[1:17:14] indifferent and don't don't berate them
[1:17:16] if they want to get vaccinated don't be
[1:17:17] random if they don't get vaccinated
[1:17:19] don't berate them if they wear a mask or
[1:17:20] if they don't wear a mask those are all
[1:17:22] distractions those are the indifferent
[1:17:24] things that are trying to dominate our
[1:17:25] minds and our conversations and who we
[1:17:27] are get our eyes back on christ
[1:17:31] why why why should we do that for aaron
[1:17:32] because there's something worse coming
[1:17:34] than a pandemic
[1:17:36] something worse awaiting those who don't
[1:17:38] receive this truth
[1:17:41] notice what brother graham says in the
[1:17:42] unveiling of god
[1:17:45] so much of this sermon in the unveiling
[1:17:46] of god he's talking about the mercy seat
[1:17:48] and god being hid behind badger skins
[1:17:50] and hid behind skins
[1:17:53] notice what he says in the unveiling of
[1:17:54] god
[1:17:56] he died to reveal himself to us
[1:18:00] now let us die to self
[1:18:02] to reveal himself to others
[1:18:05] oh my goodness
[1:18:06] he died to reveal himself to us
[1:18:09] now let us die to self to reveal him to
[1:18:12] others
[1:18:13] let us die to the traditions and things
[1:18:16] to reveal him to others
[1:18:18] died to the denominations to reveal him
[1:18:20] to others
[1:18:21] it sounds like paul
[1:18:23] does it sound like paul what he said in
[1:18:26] first corinthians 9 and first
[1:18:27] corinthians 10 that i died to traditions
[1:18:30] i died to these things i died to myself
[1:18:33] i i keep under my body i bring it into
[1:18:36] subjection that there might be others be
[1:18:38] saved and he says be ye followers of me
[1:18:41] as i am of christ
[1:18:44] brother bottom echoes out the same
[1:18:46] sentiments he died to reveal himself to
[1:18:48] us let us die to self to reveal him to
[1:18:51] others let us die to traditions and
[1:18:53] things to reveal him to others die to
[1:18:55] denominations how could we sum that up
[1:18:57] all our personal opinions that are based
[1:19:00] on the word
[1:19:01] but aren't in fact the word
[1:19:04] died in different things die to things
[1:19:06] that don't matter die to things that
[1:19:07] become these really personal pet peeves
[1:19:10] and get on your soapbox tie to them so
[1:19:12] you can do what reveal christ to others
[1:19:16] let's stand
[1:19:23] [Music]
[1:19:28] that quote this this statement
[1:19:32] i want to become something that guides
[1:19:34] me
[1:19:37] [Music]
[1:19:41] let me ask does it resonate with you
[1:19:42] this statement this closing statement
[1:19:44] [Music]
[1:19:45] he died to reveal himself to us
[1:19:48] let's die to self
[1:19:50] let's die to traditions and things let's
[1:19:52] die to denominations why
[1:19:56] to reveal him
[1:19:58] to others
[1:20:00] why would you do that
[1:20:02] why would you do that to reveal him
[1:20:04] to others
[1:20:06] with our heads bowed today
[1:20:08] [Music]
[1:20:12] i'm going to invite you to lift your
[1:20:13] hands in surrender
[1:20:16] and say lord i died to self i die to
[1:20:18] traditions i die to things i deny to
[1:20:20] personal opinions based on the word that
[1:20:22] aren't the word that are hindering
[1:20:24] the expression of the gospel
[1:20:27] let me just qualify as a caveat there's
[1:20:29] things that we base on the word that
[1:20:31] promote the gospel
[1:20:33] things that we say and do
[1:20:35] that we might adequately convey and
[1:20:37] express the gospel
[1:20:39] i'm speaking of those things that cloud
[1:20:41] the issue
[1:20:41] [Music]
[1:20:43] these heads hands raised and head spout
[1:20:45] [Music]
[1:20:50] i know there's mind battles
[1:20:51] [Music]
[1:20:56] and in these mind battles there's things
[1:20:57] that try to pull us
[1:21:00] into a certain way of viewing things
[1:21:02] [Music]
[1:21:05] but where i want your mind and your
[1:21:07] thoughts to wander to today
[1:21:10] is not man not opinion
[1:21:12] not church not ideas but to him who
[1:21:14] spoke to you and to begin with
[1:21:16] the one who's called to you
[1:21:18] the one who's
[1:21:20] touched your heart the one that you can
[1:21:21] be absolutely sure of
[1:21:23] that's god
[1:21:25] you can be sure of christ today
[1:21:29] and let them speak to your heart and
[1:21:30] guide you back to sinner and come to
[1:21:32] this compass my sheep
[1:21:33] hear my voice
[1:21:35] and they follow me
[1:21:37] they say lord i want to follow you all
[1:21:38] the way
[1:21:40] and die to self and died of traditions
[1:21:42] and died of things
[1:21:43] a gracious heavenly father
[1:21:45] i have a very
[1:21:47] succinct prayer

[1:21:52] the revelation of jesus christ

[1:22:06] these other causes
[1:22:08] so moved by other voices to where
[1:22:11] we're taking up arms to fight a
[1:22:13] political battle and we seem to have
[1:22:15] found maybe a scriptural justification
[1:22:17] for it but could it be that your voice
[1:22:19] is calling us
[1:22:21] back off that front line to the real
[1:22:23] front line
[1:22:24] calling us back away from the politics
[1:22:27] lord we're not led by the quote-unquote
[1:22:29] moral majority we're not led by the
[1:22:31] political right lord our enemy is not
[1:22:33] the political left
[1:22:35] lord we must stand for truth we stand
[1:22:38] for righteousness we stand for christ in
[1:22:40] this hour

[1:22:43] parroting the message and saying that we
[1:22:45] believe it and giving lip service to it
[1:22:47] but not holding it in the character of
[1:22:49] it so father
