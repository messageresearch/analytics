TRANSCRIPT
========================================
man amen god bless you good to see all of you tonight happy to be in the house of the lord and if you grab your bibles we're going to be reading from john chapter 6. and when i was looking at it earlier today i was wanting to read maybe a pretty big chunk of it and i uh i think we're just going to start with verse 22 and read to verse 35 even though it was the entire chapter that really covers a lot and has just paints a really beautiful picture we'll just make reference to some of these things um as we go forward but john chapter 6 starting with verse 22. we'll read to verse 35 the day following this is after he's walked on the sea the day followed when the people which stood on the other side of the sea so we know that he's crossed over to the other side of the sea he saw that there was none other boat there saved the one where into his disciples were entered that jesus went not with his disciples into the boat but that his disciples were gone away alone how be it there came other boats from tiberius nigh unto the place where they did eat bread after that the lord had given things when the people therefore saw that jesus was not there neither his disciples they also took shipping and came to capernaum seeking for jesus when they had found him on the other side of the sea they said unto them rabbi when camest thou hither jesus answered them and said verily verily i send to you you seek me not because you saw the miracles but because you did eat the loaves and were filled labor not for the meat which perisheth but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life which the son of man shall give unto you for him hath god the father sealed then said they unto him well what shall we do that we might work the works of god and jesus answered and said to them this is the work of god that you believe on him whom he hath sent they said therefor unto him what sign shows thou then that we may see and believe thee and what does and what dost thou work our fathers did eat man in the in the desert as it is written he gave them bread from heaven to eat then jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven for the bread of god which he which is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world sin said the unto the lord him lord evermore give us this bread jesus said to them i am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst but i send to you that ye also have seen me and believe not and all that the father they have given me shall come to me and him that cometh to me while i know why is cast out for i am come down from heaven not to seek my own but the will of him that sent me and this is the father's will which hath sent me that of all which he hath given me i shall lose nothing but should raise it up again and at the last day and this is the will of him that sent me that everyone which seeth the son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and i'll raise him up at the last day amen god bless you you could be seated we're continuing on the subject of christ my healer and i just feel impressed to try to cover as much ground as we can we have the opportunity on this subject it is um focusing on the the specifically on divine healing god's power to heal and what its purpose is there's a divine purpose to this divine healing and we mentioned sunday morning at the outset that just at its core divine healing points to the promise of full redemption and some may say well it seems pretty plain in scripture that god heals the bible says i am the lord that healeth all thy diseases we see that jesus went about healing and performing great miracles we see that it continued in the lives of the apostles we've witnessed it in our own lives and we've seen the power of god to heal and it might seem that may be too fundamental or maybe a waste of time to go over these things but brother abraham said the devil fights this wonderful truth of divine healing and marks it up so it's a truth that the devil would like to mark up it's a truth that the devil would want us to get out of balance and on sunday we were looking at a tipping point and look at uh kind of using the idea that there's a kind of an accumulation of things and just a series of small incidences that may be uh discrete or inperceivable might be something that is um just in small increments but eventually it builds to a point to where it tips over and it's called a tip point or a tipping point and at the point that it tips it can be something very very significant that happens and underneath some you know the watchful eye something just slowly slowly is building and then when it manifests it's like wow how did it ever get to this point that something so big can happen it had just been slowly building and slowly building and we talked about how it kind of comes that critical mass to a point where things change or a boiling point and we looked at it from the standpoint that there can be both the positive side of that and then also a negative and tonight i want to take um the subtitle of the minor leads to the major and and you're familiar with the statements brother says you can't major on a minor i've been reading through every single place where brother bam says it catching the context of it uh wanting to understand exactly what he meant what the majors are what the minors are but we in looking at this the minor when i say the minor there's because there's many different minors but there's one major but where you see the minor the minors to lead you to the major and that's my thought i want to continue on and it ties connect very well in with the tipping point now the one of the statements we read on sunday from the sermon the angel of god touches on this idea of this tipping point in the negative way now the angel god told me it would come to pass that they wouldn't believe unless there was a miracle and your words have been proved and this is what he says in his prayer and he's just he's looking at the phenomenon of he comes with signs and wonders and miracles and you think this is getting the people to believe and if you can get the people to believe nothing can stand in your way not even cancer and so here's god manifest himself in a ministry in a way that uh had not been seen just very powerful very very vindicated and it it finally worked to a point to where the people's faith weren't go it wasn't getting stronger is actually getting to where they had to see a miracle to believe i know it may seem a little bit counter-intuitive but this is the danger line or the tipping point that you see so much of the supernatural to where you are actually looking to that and need that to have faith instead of all that time your faith is actually building to say i don't need to see a sign i know what god can do and take god at his word so it came to the place where the people were only looking for the supernatural signs only looking for the gifts in order to believe and that was not what god intended by the gifts and there's very tempting just to re-preach sunday morning but well i'm going to take this further these are two statements of one is from god keeps his word in 57 another was from the evidence of the resurrection in 58. i'm going to make reference to them and i want you to be careful to try not to assume too much but just recognize that brother branham's identifying this tendency of what might seem to be positive eventually getting to a point to where it's it's counterproductive i was going to maybe get into the law of diminishing returns and i realized that some of us probably hated economics too much in our studies to maybe dig into it but it's something i felt maybe even applicable in this context because there is a supernatural that's been done that's true but you're going wild with it and that interesting especially when we sometimes we say if i'd rather have a wildfire than no fire fire at all it's all right if it's if that's the a b multiple choice you could either choose between the two give me wildfire but i don't want to do what brother branham is saying here where supernatural's being done he says but you're going wild with it you're going on the deep end with it and some people may say glory to god i'm wild right and i'm going off the deep end i'm jumping in like you know like the a lot of the nominal christian songs anymore about hurricanes and recklessness and going in deep and everything right and painting a real big picture so we're thinking yeah that's what i'm doing i'm going wild i'm going off the deep end he says the devil's pushing you off with it and so then you're like wait a minute i thought you were going somewhere else with this brother branham he says you've got plum out of the bible now now again i'm just this is brother branham ign referencing to the move of the supernatural and then people getting wild with it going off the deep end in a bad way with it and it's the devil that's pushing you off into it why because the devil fights the wonderful truth of divine healing the devil can impersonate any gift there's just ways he tries to gum it up and confuse us he says you've got plum out of the bible now he says i believe in the supernatural and we ought to he says i believe in jesus christ i believe he's the same yesterday today and forever and does the same things that he did yesterday and will forever so we must believe in the supernatural right must be there must be there should not be any reluctance in our hearts to see god move in the supernatural for god to manifest himself because we believe in it but we realize there is a way that our faith not properly centered the devil can push us out of balance and people are going wild with it and often to the deep end by the devil's nudge then he makes this statement in the evidence of the resurrection we've come we've become interested in some emotion we become interested if we can dance if we can shout because i believe in it if we can speak with tongues i believe in it i believe in every bit of it so he's i i love his balance he's not just preaching against emotion he's not preaching against dancing or shouting he says i believe in it but we've become interested in that it says but if we have that and don't have that agonizing weeping broken up spirit god can never use it and in reading a lot of these statements these brother bradham is putting it in this context and i may be getting a little bit uh ahead of myself even in into the maybe another sermon later but when he's he's looking at divine healing and how it relates he's he usually brings us back to salvation of the soul is the most important that's the most important thing we shouldn't be laboring to see miracles of the healing of the body at the sake of not ministering to the needs of the souls that need to be saved and sealed by the holy ghost and and i would think that we as message believers have a tremendous balance in that often in our churches we're preaching to uh people who've had that experience and they're not just hanging out for prayer lines and things like that uh and so i wouldn't want to just lean too far into this but he is wanting us he's wanting us to see that there's something where you get so fixated on the gifts and the movement of the spirit that other things are left undone and he's talking about this agonizing this week this weeping and he says them things are good but we've got to have the other to go with it we've left off the main thing and gone for secondary and you can never major on a minor so we've left off the main thing and gone for something secondary and you can never major on a minor we know that even in our own meetings our own meetings have gone too much to the place it's too much on divine healing instead of healing of the soul this is brother bam's assessment of his own meetings if you want to say he's just he's bringing in the the pentecostals that's fine but you'll find in other places what brother brahms lamenting about his own emphasis on the signs and wonders and miracles he says even in our own meetings we've gone too much to the place where it's on divine healing instead of the healing of the soul and i think it's still relevant today no matter how far that we've gone in the word of god it's still relevant today that we're mindful that there's souls that need to be saved amen no matter how much filled with the holy ghost you are and no matter how much filled the holy ghost your spouse is if you have children they still must be born again and so there must always be a gospel that's calling the sinner to repentance and i believe this message is the way of salvation and and he's saying we got to be careful that even in our own meetings that not too much emphasis is placed upon divine healing instead of healing of the soul and he's saying because you can't major on a minor now in the sermon the queen of sheba this is going to touch on the same thought but it's going to also bring in kind of this absolute concreteness of divine healing he says now in these meetings we do not have what we call major on divine healing because divine healing is a minor and you can never major on a minor divine healing is just something that god added to the church and no one can preach salvation of the soul without preaching divine healing for the body this is where we you can draw that thought from where i said that healing of the body is a consequence or a product of purchasing your salvation listen how he describes this it's just like if an animal had me by the side here and was just cutting my side out with his paws there's no need of chopping off his foot or his paw that is god in my side just knock him in the head it kills the whole animal i know it's pretty brutal and we might get censored by youtube but he says well that's the way christ did when he died for sin he killed every attribute of sin he killed the whole thing and before we had any sin we had no sickness sickness is an attribute of sin without sin they had no sickness and he's saying that if you deal with sin you've dealt with sickness you've killed the whole animal the whole beast and so it took care of the the sickness of your body when he took care of the sin question and when sickness is a result of sin and you cannot deal with sin without dealing with sickness he was wounded for our transgressions with his stripes we are healed so when you stop the sin question you also affect the sick question all of it is taken care of together and that's why christ died a full man a full death a full resurrection for a full church for a full gospel that's right therefore it all goes together he says you say well then brother branham your ministry is noted as divine healing because i might say man the most outstanding thing in your ministry is the divine healing sure certainly divine healing attracts about 85 percent of jesus's ministry was divine healing so catch that divine healing attracts 85 percent of jesus minister was divine healing did you know that the late dr f f bosworth used to say you never show the fish the hook you show them the bait he grabs the bait and he's got the hook so that's the way it is people come to see the power and the miracles of god and when they see that actually god catches them with the hooks and the jaw right there because they know that there's something real puts in a very a very beautiful light that god uses signs wonders supernatural in order to catch the people's attention divine healing attracts people come and they see the power of god and the miracles of god and when they see that they know there's something beyond themselves you know this is this is not normal this is not natural and this is just when the supernatural begins to move man whether it manifest in worship or praise or signs and wonders and miracles there's a point where you begin to realize there's something beyond there's something supernatural and i'm sure many of you can recall even as children or maybe a young person when you first begin to feel the presence of god you know this is beyond myself this is beyond natural i know there's something real beyond the flesh so in the way that brother brown was put in it now i still want you to remember the idea that uh brother brahms says you can get wild with this you can go too far you can go off the deep end you can get too caught up in emotion you begin to make the meetings all about divine healing and not so much the soul but so now we're kind of stepping back and showing that divine healing is necessary because it demonstrates something beyond the ability of man it is supernatural and so when that happens you know well man cannot do this is something only god can do and it gets someone's attention and they're challenged they then are facing the the choice should i do i believe in god do i accept the supernatural do i begin to open myself up to accept this one that can do the things that no man can do or do i want to just stay the way i am and so the individuals are confronted by the supernatural uh through divine healing and these manifestations and we're talking about just the center the the make-believer the the nominal person that these are ways of getting their attention now i'm going to be looking at john chapter six so you can if you want to start turning there uh where we were in our text we'll still read a few other scriptures and quotes but i want you to start thinking about uh what we read there in john chapter six and kind of read just in the middle and i'm going to start a little bit before that in john chapter 6 the at the very very beginning it says in verse 2 and a great multitude followed him because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased and so we know that just before he had healed it to pulled bethesda healed the nobleman's son and so word is going abroad that jesus christ this jesus of nazareth this man of galilee is praying for the sick he's teaching and things are happening and people are being delivered of their diseases and this is the phrase it says a great multitude there's many that are following because because because they are following because they saw miracles which he did they are following because of the divine healing so he amassed quite a large following because of the miracle of divine healing that was following him and the sermon conferences with god brother man says now we do not try to say that we make divine healing here a major because divine healing is a minor and you can never major on a minor but we believe that jesus christ ministry 86 of it was divine healing so it's already gone up a percent and in catching the people's attention by divine healing brought the realization that he was god this is what's taking place he says that there's a great multitude fun because they saw his miracles that he did on that they were diseased and divine healing is to catch the people's attention to bring the realization that this is god in the flesh of his son this is god manifesting himself as a messiah to the people that was the purpose of doing the supernatural because it was related to an attribute of god i am the lord that healeth all thy diseases it was to catch their attention in john chapter 10 verses 37 and to 38 i recognize a typo here that should be 38 not 28. might be trying to figure out which version of the bible am i reading in kind of like a hybrid english hebrew bible where you kind of go backwards it says if i do not the works of my father believe me not but if i do th though but if i do though you believe not me believe the works that you may know and believe that the father is in me and i in him we were reading the bible last night and eliot said that the bible has a way of saying things sometimes that you could say in much fewer words and this may be one of those instances if i do not the works of my father believe me not but if i do though you believe not me believe the works that you may know and believe that the father is in me and i in him he said if you can't take my word for it believe the works if you're not going to believe me when i tell you that the father is in me when i demonstrate something that should that could only be done by god then you ought to believe me said if you can't take my word for it which is the supreme way the original way the way that god wants it to be he's saying believe me because the works that are following demonstrate what i've just told you to be says it again in john 14 11 believe me that i am in the father and the father and me or else believe me for the very work's sake now this is uh to me it's a very profound uh profound scriptures because it's showing this uh the grace of god to where he sends his son and he is the messiah i think there's a song that uh i think brother rodney griffin wrote even if he never came and did another miracle jesus would still be god right if he never performed one miracle he still jesus would have still been the messiah and and so he's not demonstrating any signs and he wonders any miracles then he still would be who he was but god in his grace because he wants people to believe is declaring his presence in the son doing things that he said he would do by prophecy by promise by the by the old testament prophets and he's saying believe me when i tell you that the fathers and me and i and in him and if you can't just take my word for it believe me for the very work's sake that god is doing through me i i don't have the statement in front of me but i just want to make reference to it brother adam in the church book says jesus never did emphasize his works over the word i may be kind of losing the exact phrasing of it but jesus is first saying i am it speaks the word and stands by it but then is pointing out that god is doing demonstrating certain things that if you can't just believe my word believe the works so they're working together but he's not putting the emphasis on the works he's putting it on the word and giving a dispensation of grace to receive him by his works and so believe the works if you can't believe the word because the works are to back up what he was already saying now in john chapter 6 we know that thousands uh had begin to follow him when it says a great multitude we know by virtue of the miracles that are performed in john chapter 6 that thousands had come because of the divine healing because of the miracles they were attracted this is the question i want to ask what impact were the miracles having as they witnessed them where were they ending up at the end of the day what was what was the final outcome and result as they witnessed this tremendous these supernatural instances and in john chapter six verse five this is how we know thousands uh were coming he says when jesus then lifted up his eyes and saw a great company con unto him he saith unto philip when shall we buy bread that these may eat we continue to read and jesus feeds over five thousand uh with five barley loaves and just two small fish pickled or dried fish and uh when they're done there's leftovers to fill 12 baskets and we went through these very these some of these exact scriptures when we ministered last year i know you remember exactly the date march something 2021 you you don't even have to flip back in your notes you remember it so well on being hungry or hungry and and asking the question looking at the spiritual hunger that we all should have and so he he feeds 5 000 has leftovers to spare and because of this uh this great miracle there's already a great multitude following because the loaves and fishes are because of the miracles the divine healing now he does something that is supernatural and again i would say if you can't believe me when i tell you i'm the son of god maybe you should believe me when i just multiplied uh 12 you know these five loaves and two small fish enough to feed five thousand just the men and then the rest and all these leftovers so in verses 22 and 24 as we have already read it these come they come try to seek him and follow find out where he was they had been there when these miracles were wrought and they can't find him anymore and they didn't see him leave and they saw this this back and forth where they realized well where's jesus and the people are coming back to that place where the bread was broke looking for jesus and then seeing that he is gone they they go now across the sea to find jesus and they're seeking jesus in verse 25 and when they found him on the other side of the sea they said unto him rabbi this is a word of respect teacher rabbi master in a sense that they're they're showing them reverence and respect because they recognize the things that he's doing he says when cometh thou hithert they ask jesus answered them and said verily verily i say unto you ye seek me not because you saw the miracles but because you did eat of the loaves and were filled nice to see you too right what are you doing here and they're saying hey jesus what's going on you know que pasa and he's like you know you're not looking for me because you you really want us you know you really have saw the what's taking place you seek me not because you saw the miracles again this is a peculiar phrase because they saw the miracles but they didn't really see the miracles you're seeking me which we would think would be good and it is good but you're not seeking me because the miracles have truly attracted you but you're seeking me because you ate of the bread and it satisfied you so there was something shallow about their search they're seeing the supernatural they're seeing things that you and i will never see in our lifetime that many people fed off of two loaves and five loaves and two small fish and so this is something very very supernatural but the miracles went no deeper than the temporary satisfaction of their appetite it went no different it went no further because after that after their stomachs were hungry again they were still seeking this bread and they wanted this bread that was multiplied and so he's saying that they're what been awakened inside of them is just temporary that as soon as they're hungry again for natural bread they were looking for jesus and the same way that's exactly what healing is healing is temporal it's only going to last as long until you get sick again and it's only going to last until you die these healings are only temporary in this body because you can get healed in your body only to get sick at the very same thing or sick of something else so when they came looking for him they wanted the bread to feed the body which was something temporary in the same way that some people are just coming looking to christ for the temporary manifestations of the gifts and the temporary outpouring of the holy ghost because of what it can do to their body into their spirit and so jesus is actually identifying that they did not understand the supernatural significance or the reason for the miracles it was a signpost it was a sign that was being given but they didn't recognize what it was pointing to they were never at this moment they're not fully seeing the miracles for what they were for believe me for my word's sake but if you can't believe me for my words like believe me for my work's sake not if you can't believe me believe my works right it wasn't this it wasn't just trying to say well i mean at least you come for the bread right well at least you come for this at least you come for that no he wanted them to believe and so they sought him because the miracles but they sought him for the miracles only they're seeking them for the because of the miracles but then they were only seeking the miracles continuing in verse 27 labor not for the meat which perisheth but for the meat which is dearth under everlasting life which the son of man shall give unto you for him hath god the father sealed this is jesus now opening the word they come wanting more bread more miracles more signs more wonders well he's not going to give them what they're looking for because he's already given them a sign and now he's saying that you ought not to labor for the temporary things just don't labor for signs and wonders and gifts but you should labor for the word you should labor for that which can transform you and there's uh it provokes dialogue then they said to him what shall we do that we might work the works of god jesus answered and said to them this is the work of god that you believe on him whom he hath sent he's not letting up he's coming right back to it he says they said what can we do that we might work the mighty works of god he's saying the work of god when god has actually done a work in you you believe this is the work of god that you believe on him whom he had sent here's jesus christ standing there the father has sent me and i am speaking unto you and the word it would be effective in your heart even the signs and wonders and miracles would be effective in your heart if you had believed me because that's the work of god in there what can we do to work the mighty works of god well you haven't even started yet because god's not working even in you to believe me quite a statement they respond they said therefore unto him what signs show us thou then that we may see and believe thee what dost thou work and hadn't already been enough i mean they're following because of the miracles right they're falling because hey these guys are being healed he's cashing out diseases he just multiplied two loaves of five why'd i keep saying two loaves five loaves of bread and and two fish and he's done that and they're like and he said you should believe me like well what are you gonna do you know i mean i'm open to the idea i mean i'm not completely skeptical and i can be convinced convince me jesus and they know exactly what they're talking about because he just performed this miracle with two plus three loaves of bread and he says our fathers did eat man in the desert and it is written he gave them bread from heaven to eat this is they said they know exactly what they're thinking about but they only had an appetite for the miracles not for christ and they had an appetite for the miracles because what it could do to the body what it could do to the bottom line to think that you could have you could be hanging out with somebody that whenever you're hungry they can take whatever peter brought and feed everybody else and you don't ever need to bring lunch to work they only had an appetite for the miracles not for the miracle worker our fat fathers ate man in the desert and it's written he gave them bread from heaven to eat so why don't you when you pull it down to this guy why don't you feed us verse verse 32 so we continued then jesus said to them verily verily i send you moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven for the bread of god which is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world so truly it wasn't moses that gave the bread it was god that sent it down from heaven but now he's talking about the true bread of heaven the bread of god which is he it's christ the word which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world now consider just how contradictory this was to uh their religious minds he is saying that there is a living bread of life for the bread of god which is he which comes from heaven and giveth life unto the world there is a bread of life that is more necessary than just the temporal bread that even your fathers ate in the wilderness more necessary than just the bread that you ate the day before there there's a life that's more necessary than the temporary healings the temporary hunger and their response is not again in line with what jesus is trying to provoke because in verse 34 they said in him lord evermore give us this bread and when they say that they're not desiring christ who had come down from heaven who was that bread so it wasn't like it clicked right it wasn't like they said wait a minute this is he he speaks to us he is the one uh they're they're not desiring they're not being awakened to the true messiah because all their traditions and we could get into a lot of how these traditions are impacting them at this very moment but all their traditions had veiled them from seeing him the jews believed the messiah would come and when he would come he would serve the best wine they believed it they believed he would have the best wine and the best bread naturally and so there's a lot of reasons why they were looking forward to the messiah they would have the best wine and the best bread and so if he's the messiah then they're saying now's your time to put up buddy we've already heard that you turned the water into wine we saw what you did with the loaves the day before now you show us that you're the messiah because the messiah when he comes he's going to set up a natural kingdom on earth and all the gentiles are going to come to it there's going to be peace throughout all the world and you're going to rule and reign the messiah is going to be a natural king and he is going to have the best bread and the best wine and so they wanted was a perpetual natural food they weren't asking for the bread from heaven that supernatural that gives life unto the world the bread that jesus is alluding to but when they said evermore lord give us this bread they wanted it to eat just like they had the day before and he says in verse 35 and this is kind of what instigates their animus towards them and jesus said unto him i am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst he's not given in jesus didn't say you know what fine andrew come here let me have your little pouch of bread there he's not giving in he's still he had come to a tipping point come to a point where he knew i've done enough and you've seen enough even just this early on the miracles and signs and wonders that had been done he's saying i've got to and he's doing that which the father shows them i've got to lay in the word now i've got to stand by what i am there's been enough done already secondarily to back up what i'm trying to say that i'm the son of god so now he's wanting them not to seek after the bread to not seek after the miracles but to seek after him so he's saying just as that bread was given that fed you i am that bread that will satisfy you forevermore you eat you come to me you'll never hunger if you believe in me you'll never thirst and in verse 41 the jews then murmured at him notice the the negativity and the angle they murdered him because he said i am the bread which come down from heaven and they said is not this jesus the son of joseph whose father and mother we know how is it then that he saith i come down from heaven. are these the same people earlier i mean were some of them from verse two great multitude follows because of the miracles he did on them that were diseased are are not these the ones of the same thousands who were there when he multiplied the two plus three loaves and the two fishes were they not there when it happened weren't they not there and why didn't they say what's joseph's son doing right they didn't say it when he was multiplying stuff but and not that they wouldn't have said it elsewhere they could have said it but it's in this moment they're beginning to forget these are the same people that saw miracles were seeking after him and now when he starts speaking a certain way and he's sticking by what his calling is what is what the word is they're starting to say well you know he's really just a man and what about joseph and they're trying to allude to joseph his father and mother and the things they know about him and all the rumors that may be true and he's trying to say he came down from heaven and how quickly how quickly they turned on him when he wouldn't get him a little non right verse 51 i'm going to start counting your nices and they say i'm up to 18 nicest today like this is a record on a wednesday night in verse 51 i'm just skipping now john chapter 6 51-53 he's just he's not backing down i'm the living bread which come down from heaven if any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that i will give is my flesh which i will give for the life of the world now he says this after they start murmuring that he says he's he's the bread that comes down out of heaven and jesus didn't say you know what i know that sounds confusing and i know it's really easy to misunderstand me so let me explain myself i'm sorry that you took it that way let's kind of break this down into the semantics but he says no i am the living bread of life come out of him if you eat this bread you'll live forever and the bread that i give is my flesh he's aggravating it so then it says in verse 53 the jews therefore strove among them saying saying and then among themselves saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat and finally jesus backed off i know that seems a little dramatic i'm sorry let me explain myself then jesus said to them verily verily i say unto you except you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you wow how quickly the impression of the supernatural had left their minds a multitudes following because the sick are healed then they see another miracle which is supernatural demonstrative and this is not slight of hand and uh and he and he performs this miracle and it caused them to want to seek after him but at the very beginning of this part of the story at the very time on this next day jesus is already calling them out you're just wanting more miracles you have experienced and benefited by the miracles but you haven't really seen what they're all about and so when he starts trying to back come into the word now to say all of this was done that you might believe what i'm about to tell you then unless you eat this bread and drink this blood you'll have no part of me unless you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you and that was the payoff of the miracles that was the moment when they would have all succeeded but it was so quick it was like all those things were gone and they're now striving oh my goodness this man's saying this this man saying that when they ought to have said wow think about what he has done think about these miracles the minor had led them to the major but they weren't able to accept it it was right there in front of them and they weren't able to accept it so we know in the infamous john 6 66 from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with them that was it many of his disciples went back these disciples were ones that would have seen the divine healing they would have seen signs wonders discernments and all of those should have been building confidence building confidence for the moment when he would he would open up the word which is was already spoken uh it would backed up what was said of the messiah this would have convinced them this is the messiah this was god's trajectory this is how god was working he was trying to build them to a place to where they would see yes you are the very messiah is that not what happened to the woman at the well that he performed a wonder and was laid in the word and it brought her to christ it's not it's not the one who's the very messiah who told me the things that i've ever done but yet here's the opposite impact signs wonders miracles but when the payoff was to come for all that it's the very word that caused them to walk away if jesus had not if he had not stigmatized it with the word they might have been happy to follow now i don't want you stop giving me nices brother loyal so don't sit on me now i was i was just acknowledging them nice in investments brother brahm touches on so many different ones that we could use so many ones we could use on this because aren't we all familiar with this verse and many of his disciples walked away what was he doing getting into the word of his ministry brother man identifies it so plainly he said but one day god changed that ministry in him for miracles to the teaching of the word surely you could read between the lines look at the date it's getting it's coming he knows this is soon upon him when these seals are going to be open surely you could read between the lines he was already talking about how to change his ministry coming into something the program coming up a step higher he was very very conscious of this he says one day that ministry changed from miracles to the teaching of the word surely you could read between the lines and it's not that from this moment on jesus never performed another miracle but it was kind of that trajectory where this is building to this now the pattern can repeat itself as it often did in brother brown's ministries after the seals you'll find he'd start a series in tulsa or topeka or tampa and he's building building to this climax getting everybody on the same page what they're looking for what to expect in this last day how did he promise he would reveal himself so that whenever he would give a sign that would kind of be the aha moment i get it wow this is amazing right the revelation is to strike he says surely you could read between the lines he says you're not that blind and he says notice as soon as god changed his ministry from his miracles his miracles went on but not like that he began to tell them the straight scripture truth and where they were standing the crowd walked away from him said this is a hard saying what happened the 70 that was followed him he ordained they walked away too said who can understand a thing like this that's all against everything we was ever taught surely it ought to have been building to where they could have accepted him but it didn't and go awake jesus he said then we find out that they turned their backs and walked with him no more i'm gonna skip a little bit he says he gave them some strong doctrine his healing days were just about over he didn't care wasn't going to heal too much more he's going to tell them about something that was better i love that he was going to tell them about something that was better think of all i think of the emphasis we find often after the opening of the seals we've got something better we've got something more we've got something higher we've got something greater he says a whole new land a whole new field he says i'm going to tell him about something better he began to tell them that he was there revealed to them who he actually was so it wasn't just oh signs wonders miracles signs wonders miracles it was now he wanted himself to be revealed he wanted to reveal himself who he was uh to them what he was to be to them and it's the same in this last days god wants to reveal himself to you who he is the revealed word your mate he wants to reveal himself to you and god and his grace and god and his mercy will manifest himself to the movement of the spirit signs wonder wonders and miracles all sorts of things but at the end of the day he wants you he wants to reveal himself personally to you who he is in this hour and this time and he says so away they went why because he wasn't entertaining them with miracles anymore and the sermon sir we would see jesus i trust that this is making making sense to you kind of building in the right way he says now divine healing is not all the message jesus put i think they claimed about 80 so now he's lost six about 80 of his ministry was on divine healing but as a late brother bosworth many of you know brother f f bosworth a godly saint man he used to say that divine healing is just like the bait on the hook you never show the fish the hook you show him the bait and so divine healing is a minor you can never major on a minor but it leads to the major isn't that beautiful you can never major on a minor but it leads to the major that's what it's supposed to do it's to lead you to the major if the minor begins to have so much attention where to that becomes the major you can't major on a minor there's there's something being lost even in the minor there's a devaluing there's something that's unwinding and the people in their hearts in john chapter 6 jesus kind of calls it out you're seeking me not because you're recognizing this miracle and this sign as being indicative of christ the messiah being amongst you but you're doing it only because you love how the secondary work or that miracle you love how it makes you feel it to me it hearkens back to brother branham saying you know the supernatural is being done but you're going wild with it or you're going leading too much to emotion and the meetings get too much words there's too much placed on divine healing instead of the healing of the soul jesus said here's a bread you can eat and never die and they would just as soon get healed of a bad headache or a bad diagnosis but he says the divine healing is a minor and says and you can never major on a minor when i start and again this is just i believe a necessary foundation before we start to emphasize taking time to really highlight divine healing i haven't done i haven't got there yet i don't know if that's a success or failure on my part but i've just it it just so impressed only before we start really teaching in the word of god in such a way to where people can experience the healing power of god's word that i wanted this to be the emphasis i want this to be our foundation and we're entering the record as a church that if god ever as we invite god to move in powerful ways amongst us and to manifest himself amongst us that the word is always the main thing the word is always the major christ who is present amongst us he's the one that does the works and it doesn't lift up man it doesn't lift up any order it doesn't lift up anything secondary it all points to him who's present amongst us and so we can never major on a minor but the minor leads to the major so beautiful and when i pick up on this uh maybe i might want to take it that the major with the minor and how they work let's look back at john chapter 6 verse 66 from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with them the minor didn't lead to the major for them then said jesus unto the twelve will ye also go away then simon peter answered him lord to whom shall we go thou hast the words of eternal life peter's answer was well lord there's really no other charismatic ministries in the land today i don't know of anybody else who could take five loaves and two fish and feed five thousand and have leftovers i don't know anybody else who can cast out devils don't know anybody else who can turn water to wine peter does not point back to the secondary signs he points to major christ he points to the major and he says to you lord where else would we go thou hast the words of eternal life and we believe and are sure that thou art that christ the son of the living god if i could say it worked it had worked on peter a very disciple of john who had gone through the paces of the introduction and the keynote and the one who introduced jesus christ and now jesus christ is the one who introduced the faith to the disciples so the forerunner had worked on peter now the very one who's to reveal himself it works on peter because now he comes to a place to say i know that you are the messiah i know that you're the son of god he didn't say well you know at least we've got a prophet well i can always go back to john no he said we know that you're the messiah that was to come to the world and i'm going to wrap this up this isn't necessary just alluding to a moment ago this is a necessary foundation on these things that before before we begin to teach on divine healing i want us to know that it's the lord that healeth all thy diseases i find in my heart that i've i'm desperate to see uh certain ones healed to take god at his word to be delivered of things that have plagued them and i want to see god move and not be hindered at all and i'm desirous to see those things happen in our midst but i want our faith to run at a higher level and so there's a there's a real sensitivity on my part that as we ask god to come as we ask god to move as we desire to see god vindicate his presence amongst us that our loved ones who are lost would be saved the hard-hearted would have that broken down and they would accept it that i want the blind eyes the spiritually blind eyes to see jesus christ standing amongst us the same yesterday today and forever that when that happens it's the soul that's saved [Applause] they come to know christ and that our faith begins to run at a higher level not to create a pattern in a cycle of revival and death within our own church and that we're just on this pattern of all we have a great time then we just die die die die we all get re-baptized and we have a great time we die die die i don't want cycles i want our faith to run at a higher level amen in john chapter 1 verse 50 i don't know if i provided this but it says when philip philip is called to follow christ and nathanael is coming just on philip's word and jesus discerns them he says it says one in whom there's no guile and he says before philip called thee and i believe when he made this statement when thou was under the fig tree i saw thee so even before philip went to go get you even before philip called you he referred to something perhaps very personal to nathanael you remember that day under the fig tree maybe he cried out for the messiah maybe he longed to see the one who could uh the one that was promised and when he says this his answer is rabbi thou art the son of god thou art the king of israel amen one sign philip invites them to church show up to church just one service you're it you're the messiah i believe you and jesus says because i said unto thee i saw thee under the fig tree you believe just because of that he says thou shalt see greater things than these meaning that whenever you see yes i saw and believed and whenever you truly see the miracle and that provokes the faith then you're in line to see greater things but if you don't see you're always going to want to go back to that and back to that and back to that because you never really saw what was there but now once you see it then you know you know there's something there you know that it's real and then you can see greater things those of us who have seen the vindication those of us that have seen god perform signs and wonders and miracles then we can see greater things greater than these he says brother abraham says on the first seal and there's coming forth seven mysterious thunders that's not even written at all and i believe that through those seven thunders will be revealed in the last days in order to get the bride together for rapturing faith this is what we need we need we need faith for a rapture he says because what we got right now we wouldn't be able to do it there's something we've got to got to step farther we can't have enough faith for divine healing hardly we've got to have enough faith to be changed in a moment and be swept up out of this earth if you really take it for exactly what he's saying is we don't even have enough faith for divine healing and you think you're going to have enough faith for a change body i think we do ourselves a disservice then when we try to carve out the supernatural of the word of god and maybe it's maybe it's our own unbelief that we just say oh well i mean i believe but it's not for me or you know really no i'm fine with my arm mangled up like this you know i'm fine even sister esther testified i'm not happy staying at home i i'm not just going to endure and say this is my law and i guess this is my cross no there are certain promises in the word of god i want all that he has for me i want to walk in all his promises i want to live above this i want to live above that i want to overcome and i want to have i want to enjoy all his benefits and all his blessings and so i'll say this he's saying there's something coming seven mysterious thunders that's not even written at all that's going to be revealed to get the bride ready for rapturing faith he says because what we've got now we don't have we've got to take a step further so then if he says we don't have enough faith for divine healing right now but something comes to cause us to take a step further you have what it takes for divine healing if you've got power to change this body you've got power to see this body healed why because the minor leads to the major the sermon one in a million this might have been part of the radio program i was pulling out uh just many different things i just just saw such a tremendous grace of god and pulling this together today just at a very late hour just wasn't sure what direction to go and what i was going to be preaching just a very very difficult day for me and i just just saw the supernatural handle god bring these things together and he says in one in a million he says and divine healing usually draws an attention to people and brings them into the presence of god god does something that they know is well it's not understood we cannot mechanically show how it's done god does it in his own great way then that attracts the attention of the people to know that there's a presence of a power somewhere that can do something that's beyond under human understanding and that causes them to look to the lamb of god that's what it ought to do and it's not that it's you're not that you're chasing your tell but my it makes the word so important in a day of impersonations and fanaticism to be connected to the word of god and that when a real the real thing that is performed the real thing is done it creates a hunger to then look to the lamb of god and that's the way that god will do it in any child of god's heart any elect seeds heart they can see the supernatural performed anywhere and it makes them hungry for the lamb of god and they won't stop seeking until they find them they'll never be satisfied in denominations they'll never be dissatisfied in religion they'll never be satisfied in something nominal they'll never be satisfied in just uh conventions and revivals they gotta they want to know the lamb because that's what the that's what it attracted their attention to a presence of a power somewhere it's beyond human understanding that causes them to look to the lamb of god and the sermon leadership i'll make this my last statement i had been um listening to brother uh where the reginald ben david platt had shared with me some quotes from the sermon as i was with moses while i'll be within i just been studying through it and reading it tremendous things had stood out to me that i thought i might use tonight brother branham makes this statement the sign is not the commission the sign only points to the commission he's very conscious of this change in his ministry and it fit right in line with the the things that we'd been ministered on to to see that brother branham's recognizing there's that emphasis that can be put so much on the signs that the commission suffers you're not walking in that commission but it's for the attraction of the people my last statement of sermon leadership december 7 1965 you know the importance of this and any message that's come in a genuine born-again message of god is different from the old trend i love that statement this message is different from the old trend what people try to make up this message just to force it right into that same old trend it's different he says when a divine healing went forth not long ago did you notice how the impersonators followed it every one of them went right into the organization staying there does anyone know that there had to be a message follow that god don't entertain us he attracts our attention with something and when he attracts our attention then he's got his message amen that's what that that's what divine healing is for that's what the minor is for that's what the secondary is for he sent his word and he healed them of their diseases he sent his word and delivered them from their destructions i am the lord the word that healeth all thy diseases that's the original primary way that's the way god works and then he gives gifts he gives the gifts and he manifests himself not that that would become the destination and the ultimate but that that would get our attention to seek for the voice that follows the sign the message that follows he says god don't entertain us the divine healing is to attract us because there's a message that comes so all the supernaturals to be causing us to dig deeper into the message know it understand desire it because this message is more than just divine healing more than just healing of the body there was promises divine promises of god to the gentile bride that are opened up to this word of god and that's the major that's the major god bless you let's stand tonight
