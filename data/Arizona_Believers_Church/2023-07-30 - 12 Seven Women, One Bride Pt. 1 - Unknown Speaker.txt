TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I want to jump into a subject today and probably be a couple parts on this but if the title is seven women one bride and taking it from Isaiah chapter four there are seven women one bride just to give some foundation for where we are in this series right now we looked at and have been looking at mystery Babylon as we see it in the scripture kind of been tracking it through scripture from its Origins and then we see New Jerusalem brought right up next to it there in the scripture and this mystery Babylon in the New Jerusalem we could use as representations of the culmination of two kingdoms one is Satan's kingdom and mystery Babylon but then also New Jerusalem is the climax and culmination of the kingdom and as the Bible gives us the symbols and the description we see that Satan's kingdom is symbolized as a harlot yet God's kingdom is represented as a bride and Wednesday night for those of you who are able to catch it we spoke on the devil's lie versus the truth of God has taken a statement that brother Branham uses how the devil's lies and the devil's Devils lie the lie and the devil's Mysteries rose up against the truth of God and the mysteries of God in Babylon or in Babel in those very origins of organized religion and it's the devil's lie that tries to impersonate the truth of God Satan doesn't want to be 180 degrees from God overtly in in image and pretense he wants to be confused as God and the devil's life can be so close and so like it and it contains so much of the other the elements of truth that it could deceive the elect if God made it possible just as the woman was deceived in the beginning because it was possible God just flips the script in the end and makes it impossible for his bride to be deceived and some context for uh continuing on this I want to bring back a lot of the things we ministered on the tares and the wheat and the parable of the sower we realize that in the end of the world the tares are separated from the wheat so as we mentioned that there is a similarity between the two Vines and their Twins and they look a lot alike and they have the the tares that are growing up alongside the wheat and as they rep are represented in plant they look very much alike but there is a separation or distinction that ultimately comes or something that's going to separate out who the elect are from everyone else and in Matthew Chapter 13 Verse 30 it says let both grow together until the Harvest this is speaking of the good seed and The Bad Seed and in the time of harvest Harvest I will say to The reefers Gather ye together first the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into my barn and as he's given a parable we recognize that there's some symbolic order that's taking place and a symbolic process of The Good Seed which is the word of God that has been sown and the Bad Seed which is sown by the wicked one and how ultimately there comes a time when they there's no further expression or manifestation of these seeds and it's at that time that there's going to be a separation so Jesus picks it up in verse 39 he says the enemy that sowed them is the devil so he's telling us who it is that sowed these tares the Harvest is the end of the world and the reapers are the Angels so he lets the two plants grow up together what's the reason he says because they look so much alike that if you're going to go in and try to uproot the tears you're going to uproot the wheat also so wait until the very last when there can be a separation Nation because God's going to allow it to happen God's going to do the things that are necessary to see that the Harvest happens so he says the Harvest is the end of the world the reapers are the Angels there's different ways that we could bring that in the word of God to see what those are those are ministers and Messengers that are going to separate out the tares from the wheat and if I could say it this way there will be Ministries that are going to gather the tares together and there'll be a word of God that gathers the wheat together and the end of the world brother Adam says it's the end of an age where he says this day so this time of the separation of the tares from the wheat and the Gathering Together one's bundled to be burned the other one is Gathering of the weed into my barn this time of the Harvest it is the rapture we could just spend so much more time on that particular aspect of the timing of this but that is the rapture and brother Bram says there is a difference between the church and the bride now catch this part because to the bride the Rapture is a revelation there is a difference between the church and the bride the bride goes in the rapture so God will separate out the righteous from the wicked God will distinguish his elect from the rest and that's done at the time of the Rapture at the time of harvest and there's a lot of elements that go into this I just feel to represent this now at this stage that there is going to be an elect that are drawn out and separated out from everything else in the Rapture in Exodus chapter or in The Exodus which is a type of the Rapture in Exodus chapter 11 verses 4 to 7. I want you to see the nature of God and hell at the end uh they grow up together and they're indestinguishable until God sets the difference and if the difference is the rapture notice it's going to be revelation it's going to be a revelation that's the difference and Moses said thus saith the Lord about midnight now you can see these parallels to the coming of the son of man and the cry at midnight about midnight will I go under the midst of Egypt this is that last plague and all the first born in the land of Egypt shall die from the firstborn of pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne even under the firstborn of the maid servants that is behind the mill and all the firstborn of beasts and there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt such as there was none like it nor shall be like it anymore but against any of the children of Israel now notice the difference in verses four to six now God is going to say as this plague hits all the land but against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue this is quite a statement that there there's to be no menacing there's to be no harassing there's to be no tribulation that this plague is not going to hurt the children of Israel at all and against man or beast and this is why that you may know how that the Lord doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel how the Lord is going to bring a distinction between the two to mark them out to separate them that's what to put a difference is to be distinguished or set apart it means to be made wonderful so God is going to make just as he did in the Exodus he separated out Israel and show them to be wonderful as they were not partaking in all the plagues that Came Upon Egypt there's going to be a separation and a distinction in the end time and God is going to allow it represented symbolically in The Binding of tears to be burned in the separation of wheat into his barn that there's going to be separating out between the good seed and all the rest but the Branham says on the fourth seal like you give Egypt he give Egypt place to repent what was the last plague was death that's the last plague that hits the Pentecostal church it's spiritual death she's dead so it's a spiritual death that comes upon this Pentecostal church and this is in type of The Exodus this is what the bride is spared from because death is what is writing out that's in the name of the Lord she's spiritually dead he gave her place to repent and she's rejected it now she's dead she'll never rise again quite a statement to see that even upon the Pentecostal church was that last turn and that last restoration of the gifts in the church ages and then in just a short period of time uh they've organized and they've denominated they've come right under the Same Spirit of Babylon and they were given us space to repent an opportunity to repent even brother random being a messenger to that church uh called him to repentance and when they reject it they partake of the plague of spiritual death which is upon the entire plant that entire false Vine and even as that if you typed it out through the wheat plant itself it begins to die as the life moves on it dies from The Roots up and then in Revelations chapter 18 verse 4 I know we're just pulling from a lot of different places over the last few weeks and another heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her which is Babylon my people that you be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not of her plagues so there is going to be a separating out of the wheat from Babylon that there's going to be a distinction made there's going to be a voice that calls the bride out I know you all know this and this is um easy to be understood with your history and the word of God this voice calls the bride out of Babylon so that she is not judged or burned or partakes of her plagues if if anyone refuses The Voice they're going to they're going to have a strong delusion they're going to believe V LIE there's going to be a spiritual death that comes upon them there's going to be a lot of ramifications for that so there's a voice that gets the attention of the leg to draw them out so that they do not partake in the plague brother Branham says in Discerning the body of the Lord he says we need discernment we need the Discerning by the word the words right take the word God's words always right we can't discern by what people think what intellectuals tell us what psychiatrists tell us we got to go by What God Says that's more important now than ever got to bring it back to the word of God we've got to go back to what God has said about it in the beginning when the devil preached a sermon in Genesis 3 that contained all these truths that even subsequently appear to be Vindicated you won't surely die but the day you eat your eyes will be opened you shall become as good as God's knowing good and evil and the subsequent events and even What God Says proves what he said was true and he can even say see you didn't die but yet you go back to what God Said and even if it doesn't matter if they didn't die within that 24-hour period or even die 400 years later God said the day you eat that day you die you go back to what God Said in the original and that's true no matter what intellectuals tell us what psychiatrists tell us no matter how much truth it may seem that the devil has you always have to go back to the word of God to line up the inspiration brother bam continues in that sermon the last plague that hit Egypt was death the last plague that hits the church is spiritual death what we need today is a spiritual awakening the spiritual awakening to discernment this is part of the bride's Revival the church can recognize pulls and signs and wonders and uh and they can sense that there's a great move of God but what they can't do is recognize the Awakening of the Bride and the sermon Christianity versus idolatry brother Brown I'm pulling from all those symbolisms of how that babylonianism is mixed in with Christianity and through the uh through the Roman Catholic Church it's there's paganism mixed in with religion he says you've got to know the word stay on the word the great battle is at hand we've played church for years and years but the Hours come now that when Janice and jambres and Janice will withstand Moses as the Bible said they would now how did they withstand Moses by doing what he did so it's an impersonation it's to say oh you want Miracles we've got miracles you want signs we've got signs uh you've got interpretation we've got an interpretation so this is coming to the battlefield where it's not uh this overt rejection but uh well even as balaam's messages aren't we all the same you know why split hairs and why try to be so different and why why why why why why separate or why why do this so there's a there's a withstanding of the Bible and with standard of the word of God through those types of impersonations and he says it's going to be be spiritual battle conflict there'll be some just continue on denominational church will just move right on into denomination and go on the way it goes but I mean and that that's quite a statement that they're not actually battling it out they're just continuing on it's kind of going with the flow but the real True Believer is coming to that Battlefield that battlefield of being withstood that battlefield of being challenged that battle of having to make the choice and recognize the distinction and you better be Versed and know what you're doing or you could take an evil spirit so easy and not know so there's that influence and maybe even inspiration how you have to be so careful because the evil spirit is going to be so close that twin of Matthew 24 24 is so close he says you could take an evil spirit so easy and not know if it's contrary to this word don't believe it stay with that word they've got to stay with the word of God so that we can be inoculated against the deception that the devil uses to accomplish his agenda there will be a separation there's going to be there are twins that come from every Revival there's a spirit that is so close it can deceive the elective possible there's signs Miracles and wonders there's the devil's lie which is 99 true but not the truth and then you have God's truth which is a hundred percent true but the lies so close to it that things can get flip-flopped and which one is it but God will give his elect discernment and what we ought to be praying for is revelation more than anything because there is a time where God will be revealed himself so that we can know the difference between the two and recognize the difference between the two in Revelations chapter 17 I'm going to read verses one to five this is our now we're going I believe we're going forward at this point it says and there came one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vials and talked with me saying unto me come hither I will show unto thee the Judgment of the great that sitteth upon many Waters now I have not changed my flow I'm still in that distinction and that's separating out because the tears are bound to be bound together to be burned and that's judgment that comes upon the tares and here he's saying come hither I will show Thee the Judgment of the great that sitteth upon many Waters uh judgment there that Crema which comes from cream acrino it's a determination so we say let me look come let me tell you the Judgment of the great it means to to pronounce an opinion of so there's going to be a determination about this great and what we read in 17 and also 18 is the the determination of it what's really true about it but there's different clues that are given in the midst of it to suggest that one could look at it and be in awe or amazement of it in not know that it's the great so it says let me show you the Judgment or the determination or to pronounce the opinion of the great and that word also carries with it the meaning to approve to esteem or to prefer so if there's going to be a judgment or determination there there has to be it would be like taking a test and it's called a you have a it's called a single choice test or a true test and there's only there's a question with only one choice hey are a bunch of questions true or true it's just single option but where there's two to distinguish from and as you have but maybe an adversarial process and you have one that would sue and one that would defend and as you have the mystery Babylon versus the New Jerusalem you have the devil's lie against the truth of God if there's going to be a judgment of the one it also declares the opinion of the other that if you find or if you if you find judgment against somebody so I've been judged guilty it shows that the victim is declared to have been offended or wronged there's there has to be the other side of the other case to it other side of the case so the Judgment of the Great Horror the opinion of the great this determination of the is not complete unless we take from it or unless we have God's opinion of the Bride the Judgment of the great Harlot okay well I mean if that's all there is we maybe we could all agree that's not a good thing but you don't fully understand his opinion of the the city until you see his opinion of his bride so this one the seven of the seven angels with the seven vials says come I'll show you the Judgment the opinion of the great and then in Revelations 21 9 and there came unto me one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues notice it's the same and talked with me saying come hither I will show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife the same one that's binding that's showing us The Binding of the Babylon is now showing us the glory of New Jerusalem and it's Revelation 17 that opposes Revelations 21 so he could there could not be an exposing of Babylon by that light without declaring the True Light this that we see in Revelation 17 is the devil's creation to the mimic to God's bride if I could say this way Revelations 21 is what the devil wanted but Revelation 17 and 18 is what he produced and God's opinion of the great Horrors we could read the Judgment of it is countered immediately by the glory of his bride his glory in his bride his opinion of his bride and this is I would say the key I I'd like you to hold in your mind as we go forward it's it really is I don't mean this to be any slight but it's it's really Elementary well Elementary may not be the right word but there is a pro there's an academic process or just an intellectual process a fundamental process to be able to read the scripture and see the symbolic representation of both even to the point to where symbols are given and even within the chapter itself it says this is what it means it's not just I even realized for myself that as you grow up you hear Revelation book of symbols and symbolism and everything and we just we almost make it more mysterious than it needs to be in our in our heads if you're if reading it and just kind of even if there has to be some intensity or perseverance to do this you could just take away from the scripture these symbols relate to Babylon these symbols relate to New Jerusalem and all you've done is just been able to read it and even historians and theologians can play scripture it's like oh well this relates to this and this relates to that and this goes back to the Book of Daniel all you're doing is just being able to read it and recognize Symmetry and connections and as the the chapters unfold in the Book of Revelation there's things that are said that these things can be pieced together or anyone could read the Bible and piece together the symbols but it takes God to open your eyes to see the Fulfillment because God interprets his word by bringing it to pass and the Vindication is the manifestation and a lot could be said about mystery Babylon a lot can be said about New Jerusalem and historians theologians and even all of us as message Believers can agree that these symbols all point to these things but what happens when it ha when it's happening what then now let's continue with verse 1 of Revelation 17 there came one of the Seven Angels had the seven vials and talked with me saying unto me come hither I'll show unto thee the Judgment of the great that sitteth upon many Waters with whom and just recognize some of these words with whom the kings of the Earth have committed fornication and the inhabitants of the Earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication now the effect is upon the whole Earth and the verse three so he carried me away in the spirit Into the Wilderness quite a statement letter the spirit Into the Wilderness and I saw a woman sit upon a Scarlet colored Beast full of names of blasphemy or Blasphemous names having seven heads and ten horns now these there's greater uh there's interpretation given to this within this chapter what the seven heads mean and these different uh elements that we're reading here but I just want to pull out the the the the high parts here the Scarlet colored Beast is full of names of blasphemy it has seven heads and ten horns and the woman which sat upon this Scarlet colored Beast was arrayed in purple which is a symbol of royalty in scarlet color and decked with gold and precious stones and Pearls having a golden cup in her hand we mentioned even on Wednesday night just this this the symbolism between the things of God and now this mystery Babylon and this cup in her hand is full of the Abomination and filthiness of her fornication and her upon her forehead was a name written mystery Babylon the Great the mother of harlots and I like to say mother of Abominations of the earth she's the source and the reason for all these things foul and sinful and loathsome all these these things that exist in the world today have been propagated and spread by this this mystery Babylon the great the mother of harlots and Abominations of the Earth and we're just reading we're just reading this and we could take away from this by reading this and say this is the word of God that this woman is the great and she's very being carried by a beast with seven heads and ten horns right okay I think sometimes I joke and you guys think wait a minute is there a pun in there what did we just miss and I could be Mis just miss speaking and you're doing good not to say Amen but this Beast had seven heads and ten horns and the Beast represents ungodly power that's what a beast represents represents a power it doesn't mean that it has that we're all looking around for dragons with seven heads and ten horns and it's gonna Express itself this way it's symbolic representation of a power spiritual Powers Brother Band calls it an ungodly power and all would agree this Beast represents an ungodly power a woman now in Revelation 17 being carried by being upon this Beast let's just look at Revelations chapter 12 verses 3 and 9 we'll look at Revelations chapter 13. I want you to recognize what this Beast is and there appeared another Wonder in heaven and behold a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns upon his heads notice the same language that we read about revelation 17. so the Bible is it describes in Revelations 12 this great red dragon now it's described in Revelation 17 as a Scarlet colored Beast full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and ten horns here it's described as a red dragon seven heads ten hordes seven crowns upon his heads verse nine in the Great Dragon was cast out now watch how it goes all the way back and it tells us this who who were seen even be dealt with in this moment that old serpent called the devil and Satan who deceiveth the whole world and the deception isn't necessarily beginning at the time of the lie in laodicea or when the bride is taken away and there's he has full power and dominion over the Earth it began in heaven and in the garden and continued on Earth in the Garden of Eden and has been continuing ever since so it says he deceives the whole world we could even say the present world when it's uh in in a future time but as from the beginning of time he has been there as a Deceiver and he was cast out into the Earth and his angels were cast out with him that great dragon that Satan in his satanic religion all false religion all organized religion is represented in there I know that we want to think oh Catholic church it's it's it's it's a it's the Roman Catholic Church the the emphasis that brother Branham put on it wasn't just the Catholic Church and this is where it changes because brother Madam wasn't brother Adam didn't just get this inspiration that the Catholic church was bad and he starts preaching that and everybody's like what in the world is he talking about you had a lot of evangelicals and Pentecostals and Protestants saying you better believe it it's the great Harlan it's the there she is Mystery Babylon it's the Roman Catholic church and theologians historians and Messengers uh had agreed on that Roman Catholic church but now the messenger comes and as it begins to that Razor's Edge he's saying organized religion whether it be atheism agnostic science Protestant interdenominational you name it he's an organized religion is the mark of the beast which we could read about in these scriptures so the Scarlet Beast this red dragon at Satan's kingdom it's Babylon Revelations 13 1-4 and I stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea having seven heads and ten horns recognize again this uh these scriptures and I'm reading these so that you can see what what the woman is writing in Revelation 17. that old serpent called the devil Satan and now as we see that he has seven heads and ten horns and upon his horns ten crowns and upon his head the name of blasphemy and that's what ties it back into Revelation 17 and we see that this is also a characteristic of Revelations 12. and the Beast which I saw was like unto a leopard and his feet were as a feet of a bear and his mouth is the mouth of a lion and the dragon gave him his power and his seat in great Authority where does it derive its power where does it get its unction and it's inspiration saying the devil has done it the dragon gave him power and I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death and his deadly wound was healed and all the world wandered at the Beast and they worshiped the dragon which gave power unto the Beast this is what they're worshiping the dragon they gave power to the Beast do you see Satan do you see Lucifer then they worship the dragon which gave power to the Beast and they worshiped the Beast saying who is like unto the Beast who is able to make war with him so you can see the Antichrist false prophet the Beast these are the this is the same spirit even brother bam talks about the three stages of Satan a lot of people recognize these three stages of Satan it's if I could say this three satanic pulls or draws or influences or attractions and I've read that so that we could identify that Satan is giving power to the Beast that is carrying the woman this woman that we see and she's foreshadowed into Revelation 16 and but here in 17 and 18 more specifically spoken of we see that this woman is being carried by this red the Scarlet colored Beast This Woman's power is from Satan brother Branham in the church age book writes remember this is the false Vine let it name the name of the Lord it does so only in a lie its headship is not of the Lord but of Satan let it name the name of the Lord but it does so only in a lie it may name the name of the Lord but it does so lying because the headship is not of the Lord the headship is of Satan it finally ends up completely identified with the Beast and here he says it in plain English the riding on the Scarlet Beast distinctly shows her power is the god of force now that's that should be alarming we want to recognize any time in our lives where the lower G God of force is driving us to do something not a god of faith but a god of force these are the shadows of Catholicism that still exist within undenominational non-denominational churches independent uh message churches even where they exercise the power of the Beast and say oh well we're not Roman Catholic we don't believe in the Trinity we're not forcing this but they use Force to achieve their agenda they use Force to achieve the Optics because Satan is only concerned about Optics and how things look not how things really are that's why when something bad happens or there's a scandal there's a quick separation from it right there's no owning it rolling up the sleeves and getting down to the nitty-gritty to find out what's wrong this is the spirit of Catholicism that exists it's all about the pretense and we need to recognize Even in our own lives when we're being driven by organized religion by the headship of Satan and not Revelation which is God's Force it shows that the god of force Satan and not our God the Lord Jesus Christ what's moving this is what it shows and we realize that in Revelations chapter 17 you can take this from this it's important for us to recognize that this Beast is Incarnate in the people it's going to be in in the people that and it's represented by this woman and her power upon the waters even in Revelation 17. and it's this I don't think this is uh too much of a step here but I realize maybe there's a a lot more that we could be saying on that I just wanted to catch those images but as he was carried away in the spirit Into the Wilderness and saw a woman sit upon a Scarlet colored Beast and we and brother Branham is showing us that he all these kingdoms of this world all organize religion all denominations are represented in this we know that Satan offered these kingdoms of Babylon and of all the world and his power to Jesus in the wilderness temptation that when he tempted Jesus and the Temptations in the wilderness correspond to The Temptations in the Garden of Eden and the bride is going to be tempted in the same thing and all that is in the world or relate to those three these three Temptations so as Christ is being tempted in the wilderness Satan offers him catches he offers him all the kingdoms of the world and this power when it's offered to him he says you can have this if you worship me Satan doesn't want to be a prince he wants to be the god he doesn't even want to be the the king ruling and reigning over the kingdom he wants to be the God above the king given his light and power to the king just as this was reflected even in a monarchy even reflected in Israel he wants to be the one invisible and the Unseen power that's animating everything else so he wants Christ to assume the authority and the power as long as Christ worshiped Satan it says in Matthew Chapter 4 verses 8 and 9 again the devil taking them up into an exceeding high mountain and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them you recognize how that he is showing not just in that moment but future to an exceeding high mountain and showing him all the kingdom of the world and the glory of them and Jesus saith on him or Satan says and saith unto him all these things will I give thee if thou will fall down and worship me these were kingdoms that Satan had power over that he could give and he offers them to Jesus hear all the kingdoms and the glory of them the power of them if you'll worship me if you give me your Allegiance I will let you have all these kingdoms all of these kingdoms are represented in Revelation 17 and 18. the Bible calls her the mother of harlots every political and religious Kingdom outside of the kingdom is represented in the mother of harlots every single one there's a kingdom on Earth today that says we're agnostic we're neutral we don't take sides we don't have an official religion we don't have a official declaration no matter how neutral they would try to be I don't mean to offend any of our Swiss fans here but no matter how neutral a fair a person wants to be Satan is the prince of the power of the air he he's the we see the Hidden Springs of agendas in Nations and kingdoms and who sets them up and who takes them down God has allowed Satan to occupy that place in every political and every religious Kingdom outside of the Kingdom think about this outside of the kingdom is a product of Babylon I don't think that's too much of a mouthful to say even if you look at it in the paradigm of believer make believe or an unbeliever we could put a lot of people in the unbelieving category and then we'd put the elect in the believing category what's the make-believer it's the hybrid make belief unbelief mixed with faith and everything that is make believe for unbelief is of the same Kingdom everything outside of the Kingdom every political organizational religious organization denomination structure system is a word that I'd like to probably use a system man-made system is out is a product of Satan's agenda in the beginning the mother of harlots then speaks of daughters and that's how we would refer to them from the message of the hours how it's referred to in a lot of different uh interpretations the mother of harlots I mean she had daughters these are organizational systems denominational systems these are the product of organized religion in Babylon from Babylon whether it be religious or political oh it's not I hope I'm not ruining it for anybody here I don't I think brother Tucker stopped listening years ago right to think Oh you mean even the the Republican Party and Libertarians please don't tell me that the Tea Party is of the devil there's no God in it to even think that we've already been told America's lost all right that the the message of the hour some of those sermons could have been subtitled I think we mentioned this a few years ago could have been subtitled America will never be great again that's exactly what we've already been forewarned so these daughters are organizational systems denominational systems belief systems man-made systems all designed with the intent of binding God's people from the truth this woman who brings forth daughters now and as she's being written she's writing on this Beast the woman brings forth daughters by the power of the Beast this is by Satan's Design This Is by Satan's will this is through if I want to say Satan's programming Satan's manipulation by him sowing the hybrid seed in the beginning I want to pick up on that that Satan has designed the systems Satan has uh has designed all these organizations all these belief systems all these thought systems and what it produces in the end and the women in the politics and the religions it's all Satan's doing or his deforming so we have the beast at the beginning and the Beast at the end part of those parallels just a little bit from Eve to Satan's Eden how that Satan was in the Garden of Eden and there he was trying to gain access to life and as he the beast in the beginning brought forth a hybrid a a a mixture in Cain and that's what has allowed to be spread out over the Earth is that just that little bit of Leaven that's been sown into it that's the beast at the beginning that produces a sun that's a hybrid now when we get to the end the beast at the end has produced daughters that are called harlots through a mother that is called a and that's what Satan's achievement is in the end the beast at the end is in that woman the woman in Genesis 3 we know turned down the word that's what the woman turned down in Genesis 3. that's this is what the woman does at the end it's that spiritual Eve the church that turns down the word you know I'm just summarizing a lot in saying that in the sermon what shall I do with Jesus called Christ brotherbraham said Revelation 17 they saw Rome raise up itself in an ecclesiastical system of a woman a woman the church is always represented by a woman has this this distinction now Lord willing on Wednesday night we'll talk about how that God can use the word church but actually be speaking to two different groups of people and I'll just say that there so you kind of recognize that just because you see the one woman it's not all of it because the church is represented by a woman in Revelation 17 and 18 and there's a voice to a bride in the church calling her out which would be the true church and so there's a woman is always always represents the church the woman in the beginning if we go to Genesis 3 receive the LIE if I receive an Elijah's given power she brings forth the son and when she does this she's it's after she has conceived and is bringing forth life that she's called the mother of all living from Eve comes to sons from those two sons we can say however you want to combine it the whole world now can go trace it back its origin and we realize that Eve then is the mother of all living and when we come to Revelation 17 we have the mother of harlots of the earth and Abominations of the earth and the system which deceived has all the Abominations and filthiness of fornication and the kings of the earth and the inhabitants of the Earth have all been influenced by this mother by this woman just as the woman in Genesis 3 became Eve there's a spiritual Eve in the end where she could claim to be the power over all that is left on the Earth in Revelations 18 7 this is what it said of her how much she hath glorified herself this next phrase is interesting and live deliciously she hath glorified herself and lived deliciously think of how that ties back to a woman when she eateth she wipeth her mouth we think delicious would Inspire images of fruit and these connections that go back she had glorified herself and lived deliciously so much torment and sorrow give her so now because of this is going to be torment and sorrow for she saith in her heart I sit a queen and am no Widow and shall see no sorrow this is her own estimation of herself cast parallels here in Revelations 18. it's a it's the judgments as we're continuing from Revelation 17. and I think we'll read some things here in a moment so you tie these things together though in Revelations 18 it's talking about this woman he said well talk about the city or is it talking about the woman well the the both both are represented together she glorifies herself she lives deliciously and she said in her heart I sit a queen and am no Widow and shall see no sorrow remember Revelations 3 17 how the woman says that she is Rich increase with goods and have need of nothing there's a direct parallel between This Woman's estimation herself in Revelations 18 and the laodicean church because these These are these are these are united together she says that she's a queen sitting over many kings I sent a queen I am no widow she claims to be Christ's bride I haven't been widowed I haven't been divorced I haven't been put away I'm married and there won't be no sorrow so there is no death these are her both these are her Proclamation she flatters herself as Christ's spouse and she's flattened herself as I will see no sorrow I sit as a queen I am no Widow but she's the of the kings of the Earth what she says in Revelations 18 in verse 7 is contradicted by the judgment and the opinion that God has of her so if you only listen to her and how she presents herself boy she seems glorious boy she seems powerful she senses the queen she is no we ain't a widow she'll see no death she has the same voice it seems in the same echoing as even the bride would have and that's where it does get interesting because if you reject all the tenets of Catholicism because how much it lifts up and glorifies the church then you could turn right around and be tearing down the bride because the Catholic church and organized religion it's just the False Image because there is going to be a woman who is the glory and image of God who is all-powerful and who is in his Splendor and in his glory she is there is going to be a woman a true woman like that this woman in Revelations 18 she has this symmetry with Revelations 3 17 I'm rich increased with goods and have need of nothing brother Adam repeatedly connects those two together I said a queen I'm no Widow Rich have needed nothing it takes Revelations 3 17 and ties it to Revelations 18 7. and if you take the theme from Revelations 3 the great is the church who's rejected Christ it's in this laodicean church age that he's put out of the camp she's turned down the word she's given her opportunity the word is opening up to her she's she's rejected it she's walked away from it so the great she is a great but yes says I'm no Widow I I I have I said a queen I shall see no death trying to position herself and she's a mother with daughters so turn with me to Isaiah chapter 4 verse 1. I'll read this we'll come to verse two here in a moment in Isaiah chapter 4 verse 1. I want to I want to get I'm glad I got to this part because then this will give us some some things to handle grab a hold of as we go further and in that day brother Brahm said that's the end of time where we're living now marriage divorce and prostitution or what more what brother Brown says in the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom Earthly bride that's the end time where we're living now and he says marriage divorce and prostitution and what more parallels to the days of lot and the days of um uh Noah and in that day seven women shall take hold of one man saying we will eat our own bread and wear our own apparel only let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach now we know that it's from the Old Testament this is very very quickly I don't mean to get into this too much there's two distinct reproaches in the Old Testament to be unmarried three even to be unmarried or to have a child or to have a child outside of wedlock so to not have a child so to be unmarried to be Barren or to be unmarried and fruitful and so this what this woman is expressing is an image that we see repeated quite often in the Old Testament seven women say we'll eat our own bread and wear her own apparel but we want to take on your name so that the reproach is taken away if we found out there was a woman that had seven daughters or had many daughters and was the mother of harlots and said well does she have a husband no she doesn't have a husband this is a reproach so we see the image of a woman and her daughters and all these systems I want to see the image this is in time all these systems that are against Christ because we have seven women that have their own food and clothing but they want to have the man's name these seven women now represented in that day so it's this very specific time it's the end time where we're living now and it gathers up through these seven Church ages is it the type of the churches that have come forth through seven Church ages that have rejected Christ that have all organized and what continued on organized religion has continued on the life moves on in the true it moves on but the organized religion has continued on and so at that day there's seven women who have rejected Christ it's represented these seven churches who rejected Christ but they still want his name they eat their own bread and wear their own Peril and notice the challenge to laodicean church age in Revelations 3 18 I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich when they thought they were in white reignment that thou mayest be clothed we'll wear on a pair we'll eat our own bread but he's saying you need to buy uh gold try it in the fire you need white reignment in the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyes and that thou mayest see there is a parallel now of the woman who glorifies herself who sits as the queen am no Widow and shall see no sorrow with the laodice in church age that's rich increase with goods and have need of nothing and these seven one women that want to take the name of Christ but have their own bread and wear their own apparel they're only worried about the pretense and want to have a story for their daughters this is a gentile age that's been represented in Matthew chapter 6 verses 31 and 32 it says therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat what shall we drink or wherewithal shall we be clothed for after all these things do the Gentiles seek notice he's saying do not ask what are we going to eat or what shall we drink what shall be clothed with in that day seven women say we know what we have to eat we have our own bread we'll wear our own apparel and Christ is saying don't seek your own don't be consumed with that that's what the Gentiles will seek that's what they seek after they're without a promise all they're concerned about is what they eat in what they wear and now with this blending of paganism and Christianity they want to have their own bread and wear their own apparel but be called by a name so the reproach is removed he says for all these things to the Gentiles seek for your heavenly father knoweth that you have need of all these things he knows your need and we'll Supply it we don't need to try to fabricate our own clothing fig Leaf religion we don't have to come up with our own bread it'll only gets stagnated and rotten over he knows what we have need of we ought to be those unlike the Gentiles of the Heathen ways and be like those whose eyes have been opened to see that there's a promise of God for his elect in the end time that at that day in a day where seven women are taking hold of one man let us be called Christians let us have your name but we want to wear our own clothes we want to eat our own bread that there ought to be one that is dependent upon him the Gentile churches these harlots they seek their own bread and clothing what is it it's a spirit of independence from God son whether you want to say an iron disposition or this uh this uh this nature of this woman where she's dependent upon herself and she's getting away from absolute dependency upon God in his word they want the name but not the headship of the word is that not the seat of discrepancy Cain wanted to worship he wanted he wanted to worship God but he wanted to do it his way because when shown the right way he said no thanks I'll just murder the one that had the revelation of the right way hoping there's the devil's template hoping that his survives is to the victors go the spoils and it's the it's the conquers that write the history he's hoping that in the end it would the record we'd be so confusing and cloudy that he would alone would be the only one that could be worshiped because of so much confusion notice the seven women want the name brother Bradham says in the sermon the Harvest time if that seed hasn't been germatized it'll never raise again it can't raise there's nothing in it to raise it so if the seed hasn't been dramatized it can't raised it's German it's the germanizing that raises so if there's no seed there same result and if we just become a nominal Christian that means a name only if we just become a nominal Christian and he pauses there are two churches in the world Church natural Church spiritual they're all called Christians now when he says Church natural that doesn't mean tangible I said well brother just show me where the church natural is and we could just go put our put our hands about right we could drive by it and we could plan protest or whatever it's a it's a it's still it's a carnal Church a natural Church born of a man's inclinations it's that Babylonian religion organized religion denominationalism that's the church natural but the church spiritual they're both called Christians but the church natural cannot raise can can raise the correct way it's doing its raising now in the world Council Council of churches that's all organized religion that we have to resist the notion that it's going to head itself up in ways that we think it will or has to head up in ways uh that are very obvious to everyone else and we're all going to be having to we pay for gas by going dirt right we're gonna have the barcodes on our forehead and and people are going to get up there and like trying to look at me and shine a black light on my forehead and see if I've got got the mark because there's all sorts of ways people think it's going to happen and how this power is going to be exercised and maybe don't get so caught up in trying to figure out what that looks like and just realize that a prophet's already said it's here and the only shelter is in the word that's the only shelter the shelter isn't standing out there in the middle of the battlefield the battlefield said I I figured you out I got you you're a champ you're NFC you're AI your chat bot 666. right and we figured it all out and we know what it is hey that could be 100 the truth but without Christ you're nothing doesn't matter how much you've got it figured out if that's one thing this message has done so clearly is in a lot of ways it's Vindicated a lot of people's probing that they were right about certain things but listen what good does it do to tell you there's a tsunami coming of sin there's a power coming it's Antichrist and it's going to swallow us all up and there's going to be a force that takes us and everyone's gonna wonder and that man is incapable against it if you don't know if you don't have the power to take you out of here if you haven't recognized the very thing that gives you power against that what does it mean to overcome to him that overcometh what does it mean s but the Christian Rises the nominal Christian in name only that the natural church and the spiritual church what these are different seeds different life different Natures he says the Christian the true Christian Rises to meet Christ because it's a bride to go meet him there is a difference in them nature holds these secrets to us and we can see them as we watch them he takes us right back to the principle of the seed that's where we can see mystery Babylon and that's how we can see New Jerusalem is when we go back to the seeds so we have a mystery of two women at the end time one of Satan in this form of the Beast one of Christ you could say two Edens Two Cities and just as Satan took Jesus up to an exceeding high mountain and offered him many kingdoms those kingdoms are represented in women catch that Satan has offered Christ and I want you to think about this in a spiritual way he didn't just offer him the the mechanics of Kingdoms he said like someone offering you a house do you want this house or coming give me more details right but you remember how that when the near Kinsmen in the Book of Ruth this is so good why am I doing this at 11 30. and in the Book of Ruth the nearer Kinsmen was given an opportunity to have land and the Revelation was he goes yeah I'll take it land give it to me in the revelation of a woman comes with it and he goes oh no I don't want to Mar my inheritance notice that that attitude the woman came with it now when Satan offers Christ all these kingdoms this way if I could say this and if you're giving me some latitude and you feel that you need to forgive me if I'm overstepping a little bit but the women came with it and he's offered all these kingdoms through this way and he realizes if I take the kingdoms this way then I become the husband to the daughters of Satan if I take the kingdoms his way then the wives come with it and Satan's like yeah baby right he doesn't mind but Christ won't receive it that way because notice what he says in Matthew 4 10 after Satan has taken him up to this exceeding high mountain and shows them the kingdoms says I'll give you these and I want to say women I'll give you I'll let you to be I'll let you have these women they're yours if you worship me and notice what Jesus says get the hint Satan for it is written Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve Jesus brings it to worship now we we I think we rightly focus on the fact that he's asked him to worship Satan in order to receive the kingdoms but in receiving the kingdoms he has to worship the woman it's about worship it's about service and there's and we can even see how there would be a a have a taken on the mark of the beast and as we see the climax allowed to see what is it it's a woman's world it ends with the worship of a woman so when he asked him when he's asking him and I hope you can make this connection when he's asking Christ to worship Him and receive the kingdoms he's asking him to take these harlots as wife and he's wanting Christ to marry these women and he and he's going to if he took the kingdoms that way the women came with it so it wasn't just a response to worshiping Satan but it's his Judgment of the kingdoms it says Judgment of the women he says I can't take these kingdoms that way these women are filth these women are are putrid these women are Unfaithful he did not he did maybe he wanted a bride but he didn't want it that way in Revelation 17 18 and the woman which is revelation 17. which thou sawest is that great City Revelations 18 which reigneth over the kings of the Earth was he I just catch this in symbolic form this is purely you don't have to adopt uh this way of seeing it but this is this is what I see that if this woman now is the one that Reigns of the kings of the earth and he asks Christ he's going to give it to what's he going to do there's your husband and wife just to type we could debate about it over barbecue or something this afternoon and I'll be fine with that I love it when I get feedback from you do you see them the offer came with women and this woman is the one that Reigns over all the kings of the world and Satan is how is Satan worshiped he's worshiped through the and the harlots that's how he's worshiped how does he receive worship through organized religion he's receiving it through the mother Harlot he's receiving it through the heartless so how was Christ going to worship Him so when Christ says get thee behind me Satan for it is written Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve Jesus Christ was rejecting and judging these women and it was upon that great high mountain says and the devil took him up into exceeding high mountain and showed him the kingdoms of this world now hopefully this helps you see the parallel I'm seeing in Revelations 21 verses 9 and 10 and there came unto me one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last pledge and talked with me saying come hither I will show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife remember Christ has taken to the exceeding high mountain driven of the spirit Into the Wilderness in Revelation 17 this Angel is brought into the Wilderness by the spirit Into the Wilderness and he saw a woman sin upon these mountains and here it says come hither I'll show you the bride the Lamb's life and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and showed me that great City the holy Jerusalem descending Out of Heaven from God do you recognize the different mountain peaks that Lucifer takes him up to a very high mountain and from there he can see an imitation Kingdom from there he can see women and maybe a great woman there he sees a false Jerusalem and there given an opportunity to receive it he says no I won't take it and what's the joy that is set before him there on another high mountain they're at another great mountain peak he sees the great City the holy Jerusalem descending Out of Heaven from God one is worried she says I have my own bread I have my own clothing I know what I'm going to eat I know what I'm going to wear I just want I just need a husband I just I just need that one from Heaven I need that peace I need to be inappropriately married to the match piece so the the Conquering the coup can be complete there will be no secession there will be no abdication if I could just get him and here she's lusting after him and trying to entice him and he refuses it in the there in the wilderness do you not see what it is the bride turns down in this end time and hear this woman seven women taking a hold of one man give us your name to take away our reproach but we don't want your headship we'll feed ourselves and clothe ourselves and Jesus says this is what the Gentiles seek after and then he says in verse 33 but seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness what must our eyes behind the two different kingdoms the carnal Kingdom of the Gentiles and then the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you and to her was granted to her was given to be to be dressed in this righteousness you see what the parallel there is then seek ye first the kingdom of God this ought to be our ambition this ought to be what we're looking for because God promised the word would be restored to his elect in this last days and we know that what Eve turned down the nominal Church turns down but we are raised up to accept what the woman turned down what the church rejects there will be a bride in the land that will receive him for in that day seven women shall take a hold of one man saying we'll eat our own bread and wear our own apparel only let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach and then it says in that day shall the branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious then that same day there will be a branch of the Lord that's beautiful and glorious and the fruit of the Earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel there you are there you are seven women trying to take a hold of one man in that day but there's a day another day that dawns and they'll be the branch the Lord will be beautiful and the fruit of the Earth the bride is answering the bride is answering to the fruit of the ground because it says the fruit of the Earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped those that escape they're answering to the fruit of the ground they too are excellent and comely what is that a nod back to the garden the fruit of the ground will be excellent in Conley the fruit is God originally ordained it not the LIE but the fruit of the ground says in the flashing red light are the signs of his coming he says Brothers if you could come to your instruments Eve got from behind the word of God and that caused every heartache every graveyard every sin that was ever committed started right there here it is again women were the cause of the first fall or woman was the cause of the first fall and women end up in the end up ends up the time she started it she ends it and then he says go listen to this sermon it's just chock full of stuff that I want to read no wonder the Bible said those that escape notice how he says out of Zion not just Israel out of Zion shall be glorious in this side of the Lord there's your parallel a woman started it and a woman ends it and it would seem that the beast at the beginning has achieved his Beauty at the end and you have the Beauty and the Beast at the end and hear what Satan designed to do from the start he's accomplished in Revelations she started it she ends it but there's another voice calls elect out of Babylon and then we see her described in the preceding chapters come to another high mountain not the false Mountain but come to Mount Zion not not the natural Mountain from which we see all the kingdoms of this world but let's come to another Mountain where the marriage transpires between Christ and his bride where he turns down the seven women to be married to the one for an invisible Union no wonder the Bible said those that escape out of Zion shall be glorious in the sight of the Lord for the next few days or for however long it might be before we pick this back up who ends it what those different ends might be [Music] could you stand with me today
