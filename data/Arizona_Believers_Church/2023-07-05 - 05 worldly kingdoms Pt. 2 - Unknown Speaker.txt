TRANSCRIPT
========================================
as you can see from the slide that we're going to be continuing on the subject of the Kingdom and I'd like to read a statement from the church age book and this I will kind of capture a lot of different thoughts that we were using in the last the first service on worldly kingdoms on Sunday but it's also wanting to re-emphasize the whole point and kind of looking at this subject I don't ever want to approach a subject in such a way to where you feel it's more academic or historical lesson but if Jesus Christ is in every verse then we can see ourselves in every verse and so the real importance is to see what Christ means to us when we read our Bibles and we catch Revelation and so brother Branham is making some very um profound statements and you just find it's just throughout all these chapters in the church age book he's just using addressing this particular theme of sewing and reaping he says whatever seed started the church will come forth and be like the Original Seed because it is the same seed so there's the law of reproduction he says in these last days the true bride Church Christ's seed will come to The Headstone that's a maturity that's a fullness and she will be the Super Church a super race as she nears him so this is uh these are new Creations or new creatures this is this is I would say the kingdom this is representative of the Kingdom and he says they in the bride will be so much like him that they will be they will even be in his very image this is in order to be United with him they will be one now I'm going to say it now and maybe not with any kind of background or explanation to it but this prerequisite in order for them to be United is they have to be the same and you kind of catch that it can't he says the seed that started is a seed that's going to come up and he said it's going to be Christ seed and so if Christ is going to unite it has to be his seed and he says it has to be the same it'll be the same seed and this is so that they can be United together they will be one they will be the very manifestation of the word of the Living God we know in many different places uh he's saying that you are the message of the hour you are the reflection of it you are the word made flesh and he says denominations and this is uh as you're reading and tracking what he's saying is it's addressing maybe the error in the pergamian church age this is uh this is applicable now when he speaks of denominations remember denominationalism is anything that's mixed and I think it's good for us to think that way and saying oh does it say Baptist does it say Presbyterian is it a denomination and then draw the conclusion that it's mixed but if you see anything mixed that's denominationalism and so it doesn't matter if they call themselves independent or message if it's mixed that's denominationalism and so it says they will be the very manifestation of the word of the Living God if I could say but he says denominations cannot produce this wrong seed so whatever seed it is it'll come forth he says they will produce their Creeds and their dogmas mixed with the word this mongrelizing brings forth a hybrid product now that's the that's the focus tonight is that the hybriding or this Mongrel eye that's kind of a kind of an aggravating word mongrelizing it has maybe some harsh sounds to it and it is a uh it kind of is uh maybe maybe a term that we don't use very often now but this mongrelizing brings forth he says a high bridge product now as we continue in the subject of worldly kingdoms I'm wanting to associate that hybrid product with the worldly kingdoms what we see in the world today uh what we call worldliness and that all that is in the world is the lust of the eye the lust of the Flesh and the pride of life and all those things as we look at this in part two of worldly kingdoms we're wanting to identify where it began and in by examining the origins of the kingdoms of this world I'm hoping that we can Mark out more clearly what is the kingdom because there's there's uh things that maybe we and I guess I'll just address it this way that divide that we've come up with well uh we were living here in Earth and we're making decisions about whether or not we're going to spend eternity in Hell or whether we're going to uh spend eternity in heaven and I believe that's the wrong way of looking at it because I I feel impressed to identify the original and recognize what the original is the original spoken word the way that God originally set it up take Genesis 1 Genesis 2 as we have and frame out that picture where God represented Perfection but then be able to look at the perversion so that we can understand the future home we can understand what eternity is going to be and recognize where the seeds of the Kingdom were planted and what that's going to be one day in eternity and what it is we're living for and what it is we're doing on Earth right now so that we're we're Mark so we're recognizing identifying the worldly kingdoms to make the kingdom more pronounced but we need to recognize what the original was because that's going to be what survives that's what we're we're heirs to and in Genesis chapter one excuse me Genesis chapter 3 according to the parable of Matthew 13 we see the wicked one going and sowing seeds of all the worldly kingdoms and what the what the devil was able to accomplish is he poisoned the nature of humanity poisoned the nature of man uh by sowing his seed and that's what Cain began to bring forth is a poison nature in the sermon God's power to transform ER says to make this point I wanted to give you my analysis of what Satan done in Eden and I like that he wants to give you his analysis and he's analyzing uh what took place and he's going to set forth as a prophet what happened and he summarizes it this way sprayed horrible poison spray this is what he's done and I in the way that he describes it and this is going back to what we were saying over and over again on Sunday Satan himself does not have a seed uh but he is if we say he's a power he's an influencer but he does not have a seed he cannot create co-equal with god brother bear said accepting the ability to create he doesn't have the power of life in him is actually the power of death and so he's wanting to uh he's wanting to have access to life and so it's not that he had a seed and he sowed it but he took seeds that God had already made and he's and brother man's using this as an in a sense of an allegory or a type that he sprayed the seed with poison he poisons the mind of the serpent he uses that serpent to influence the woman and so he says it's sprayed a horrible poison spray this is what he does in Eden would you like to know what that spray was I can tell you I got the formula of it two words unbelief which is contrary to Faith sprayed unbelief doubt so this is what he sprays in the beginning is unbelief and he sprays doubt and by spraying unbelief and doubt and in in in indwelling the serpent sowing the seeds of discrepancy just through preaching the word of God and misrepresenting it he's using the spray of unbelief and doubt then now watch what brother Branham says and science filled its place so as unbelief and doubt tankered something and rotted something and caused it to fall away he says where the cavity is that went into the seed Satan filled that cavity with knowledge and Science and civilization and it's deformed the whole entire creation of God the devil cannot create it he can only pervert it he cannot transform it he can only deform it so he is used in the beginning the tactics of unbelief and doubt you'll find that he still works that way with you anytime something's working through fear or unbelief or doubt you can recognize that as the tactic of the enemy and so he creates a deformity which is through this spray of unbelief and we were drawing and we you connected this in God's power to transform into things brother Adam's saying and there and also this sermon seated discrepancy how that the tares are what the efforts of the wicked one brought forth as the enemy It Goes Forth to so then the Bible says is the devil so what he does is he sprays this poison he causes these seeds to mix and it brings for Tears which are a poisonous weed we saw where it's called even by the horticulturalists the wheat's evil twin so it's a it's a it's something that looks just like the wheat before full maturity oh it through different stages it looks like a plant that maybe would be good for food but if you eat it that grain uh and that seed will can intoxicate you impair your judgment your discernment eventually causing death that's what's represented by the tear it's a mimic weed it's a stowaway seed something is we read to where it's kind of in that middle ground they say to where the the tares are not exactly domesticated but they're not exactly wild they're not tamed or they truly well there's something that is sown into the rest of the grain depends upon the efforts of domesticated crops but yet has a wild nature to it and so this is what the tares represent even in the world today and these worldly kingdoms as we were saying Sunday they exist because of Satan's ambition as RAM said Satan wanted to indwell man just as God did so Satan wanted access to humanity and he gained that access through the serpent by creating a hybrid product that he could then dwell in because there was this Affinity with animal nature we know he wanted to be worshiped as God and this is how he achieves it he used God's original seeds and mixed them right use God's original seeds and mix them to create something that he could access and what did it produce an evil twin produced an evil twin so those are the tares that you see that Satan allowed to be sowed into God's creation and just as Fellowship in on this and I think the the idea of setting forth the serpent just even saying serpent we all kind of go right we just kind of feel like ooh but when God created uh and we know that there's even a little bit of uh maybe it's not so much foreshadowing he's looking back as to why it's named The Serpent but yet as Adam would have given all these names to these beasts and it takes on a particular meaning and particular feeling we associate that because of how Satan used it right oh my how the how Satan used the serpent so it's hard to think that God would have actually caused that Beast to exist in a day of creation when he said it's good and be a part of that original so Satan that comes and takes a serpent that if he had just stayed in his Lane would have brought forth uh other other seed and would have had his place in God's Eden but yet Satan allows it to mix and in doing so it creates a hybrid product that's why Satan could influence Cain that's why the devil having entered into judas's heart is because God reserved the right for himself to dwell within his original creation man in his pure form and we find all that is in that in the church age book now if you look at Genesis chapter one this is where I I feel like I'm just kind of pausing uh tonight instead of getting further into the manifestation of the seat of discrepancy kind of see it in Cain and track the kingdoms of this world uh to the end I just felt impressed to look at Genesis chapter one and this this Dynamic of seed and it bringing forth life so Genesis chapter 1 verses 11 and 12 it says and God said let the Earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the Earth and it was so so we know that God sowed first by the spoken word we've seen the message of the hour but the realm says there's seeds that are laying there in the earth and then now he's saying that these are to come forth there's maybe some more scriptures we could have read here even in the first two chapters that highlight this process and this principle but it says here in 12 in the Earth brought forth grass an herb yielding seed after his kind and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind and God saw that it was good now in verse 11 and verse 12 when it says kind it's species and each one had us there was a species that was uh that God had carved out that God had created that God had set apart and he says Let each a herb and each grass in each tree bring forth after his kind whose seed is in itself and that seed could have been translated to semen it's it's that something has virility and Powers it has the ability to reproduce and bring forth it speaks of because it's seed it speaks of Offspring and descendants that come from everything that was in that seed and and there's uh there's I can't remember uh and I I'd heard it's I've seen it written it's kind of quite common phrase that you know we can we can take an apple and count these seeds that are in an apple but God actually knows just how many apples and apple trees can come from a seed because it's in there it's in it's in it's in the power of the seed to bring it forth and so the this is the species after his kind by the seed that is in it so God has ordained reproduction for certain species reproduction by seed and and Brother Band calls this in Genesis 1 11 God's law of reproduction so we can say whatever life was in the seed comes forth into the plant and then it goes into the fruit why because it's the law of God the law of reproduction God's law of reproduction you take seed germinates whatever process it goes through it says that life that's in the seed comes into a plant and then it comes into the fruit that's how God originally designed this and it's saying in chapter one this is what happened the seed in the Earth come forth into grass and trees yielding the herbs and the trees yielding fruit all of this came forth now in Genesis chapter 1 verse 28 . it's got and now speaking to the man and the woman it says and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth my brother Brown helps us to connect that it's it's the same law of reproduction this species now this human race Adam as it were it's represented in Adam and the woman they are to also to be fruitful multiply and replenish the Earth and it says and subdue it and have dominion over the Fist of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth so we recognize that Adam is the first king on Earth as he's given dominion over every living thing so the his throne is established in Eden he has a domain over all living things here's Adam uh represented together with his wife standing there brother bam says in God's power to transform and God placed over this to rule all his great creation here on Earth his son and his son's bride Adam and Eve what do you have all the elements of the Kingdom you have a a king and his Queen you have the domain you're going to be given authority to rule and Reign Over everything and now they're under the Commandment to be fruitful multiply and replenish the Earth just as every seed was supposed to bring forth of its own kind now mankind is to bring forth of himself of his own kind right you with me just help me out a little bit tonight if you could you don't have to we don't have a noise meter up here we keep track we're not going to be sending out report cards on how well you pulled or he a manned but if you can help me help me and brother Nathaniel we we always tell the church don't say Amen if you can't because sometimes the preachers tell say Amen we find ourselves going no uh-huh can't do it but only say Amen if you can so now brother Brad makes two statements I'm just going to read these I don't have a slide for he says Adam was the son of God Eve was the daughter of God so I'm just I'm bringing this to you if it's the law of reproduction is that whatever life is in the seed comes into the plant and comes into the fruit then let's think of the same thing when it came to the man and the woman Adam is the Son of God Eve is the daughter of God and brother bear says another place Adam was a direct descendant descent from God and you only take the nature of your parent so if Adam was a direct descendant from God he's wanting us to recognize that there would have been the nature of God in Adam that that's there's nothing else mixing with it there's nothing else to defile it there's nothing else to influence except the spoken word has brought forth the supernatural being God is going to form uh by the word of God he's going to form and form a body from the dust of the earth and we saw him as a tree rooted in the earth and it has this great picture and uh that God is trying to portray to us and he said he has the nature of his parent so that when God tells the man and the woman to be fruitful and multiply and replace the Earth he's saying I want you to be parents and therefore the very nature that you have is to be sewn into and it's got to be the same nature the same life that'll come forth into the children now brother Bradham says this and I'm drawing really heavily from spoken words The Original Seed and and you're just gonna tonight just because just kind of stay with me we're just kind of walking through this and maybe I'm not making any big points at the beginning and maybe I won't make any big points at the end but hopefully he'll look back and say okay we got somewhere and it'll help us for the next time and the sermon spoken words The Original Seed he says notice what happened to Eve's children the first one that was born now I think that brings us to Genesis 4 we think about King now if God said multiply to his bride to Adam's bride and replenish multiply and replenish the Earth that was God's Commission and she would have done it and he would mixing themselves together now I think that's that's a that's maybe a mouthful just saying that but he's saying that and he's using maybe a phrase just for us to instead of trying to figure out just exactly what that would look like or just how it happened because there's some debates on whether or not it would be just only by Spoken Word or what would take place but he's saying it would have had to have been the two of them right as a couple you're 19 and together bringing forth children that's how God originally intended it and so he says they would have done it and he uses the term mixing and I I don't want to focus that so much on the mixing but themselves in other words the only way that they could have fulfilled God's original commandment is it would have been for the man and the woman by whatever means that God would choose for them to mix that's how they were to bring forth children of God that's how they bring forth another atom or or another woman he would have done it she would have done it by mixing themselves together now turn in your Bibles to Mark chapter 10. because this is uh this is where we're maybe able to piggyback on some of the things we've already ministered on last month it says in Mark chapter 10 verses 6 to 9 he's being asked a question about divorce and remarriage and in the resurrection you know who's going to be with who and he says and kind of the question is well why did Moses give us a writ of divorcement Jesus says here but from the beginning of the creation of God from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female now we recognize that as gender and it it it this gender has roots and species it says from the beginning of the creation God made them as he had spoke to them and said be fruitful multiply and replenish the Earth he made them male and female for this cause this is Genesis 3. this is or Genesis 2 this is the the utterance the prophetic utterance for this car shall a man leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife and they too shall be one flesh so then they are no more Twain but one flesh this beautiful Mysteries here beautiful deep truth he says what therefore God hath joined together let no man put asunder now I don't believe it's subtle but maybe it's not as apparent but but Jesus is talking about and the scriptures are talking about reproduction go back to Genesis 2 and you look at it now it's talking about reproduction because it says God made them male and female and by upsetting that fourth male and female relate to gender but not in the way that we're trying to confuse it today but it's in the sense that you have a certain species you have a certain kind and within that you have male and female and even the word gender comes from the root Gene which means to give birth or to beget so Jesus from the beginning of creation God made them male and female then this is for the purpose of begetting for bringing forth life and so just even to use the term of male and female to give gender construct it's it's done in terms in the role of reproduction solely like whatever what role does a person play in reproduction determines whether the male or a female and that's the truth that's the scientific truth that's the reality no matter how someone would try to change it and so he says that that wherefore and I know there's maybe a lot more to be we're leaving there to be spoken on but I want you just to catch this male and female and he's relating to the role of begetting bringing forth it says whatsoever God hath joined together let no man put asunder when it says join that means to be fastened to or yoked to and it the root is wagos which means pair or joined together and it comes from the root word zygote which means joined or yoked now this is to me this is really uh I wouldn't say just fascinating but this is the truth of what Jesus is saying as we go back and say well what what does it mean what God has joined together we only think in terms of I now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I pronounce you man and wife and then we say whatsoever God has joined together let no man put asunder and we kind of think by the power invested in me by the state of Arizona and as a minister of the Gospel I now join you together and we all go hey right and that's that's kind of how we think about it but this is a phrase that has such deep meaning and implication even the purpose of marriage and the marital Union and how God ordained it in the Garden of Eden what was the union for it's for bring forth it is is the for the purpose of bringing forth children and so he says that when he says let God whatever God had joined together the word is actually zygote you know what a zygote is it's the initial cell formed when a new organism is produced by the means of sexual reproduction whatsoever God hath ordained whatever God has joined together God has a way to where the man and the woman in the beginning were to produce an offspring and that would be the zygote that would be the joining together it's not which is produced by the the union of a male sperm and a female ovum and in that joining together it contained the DNA that's derived from both in order to form a new individual that's good stuff this is what's this is what's represented in the picture when he says whatsoever God had joined together let no man put asunder in other words this is how God ordained the man and the woman Adam would have I mean you could even say Adam was just one's being and in him was all the genetical makeup of Adam and then when God brings the woman out he's cleaved or separated out this DNA the agenda from Adam masculine feminine and so all the DNA in the woman would have originally been the DNA in the man but God has to portray this beautiful picture of what he's wanting to achieve and he couldn't achieved it with just an Adam because he's wanting to produce an earth to bring forth a bride he wants to be married to a bride in order for him to have abriety it has to become a bridegroom so this is what's in this picture that now the man when the woman comes out from the man she's his DNA hey she is him she's just equal but opposite in a different reflection he says that male and female God has determined that they would bring forth the material to produce another Son of God what God had joined the zygote that's the that there is going to be a formation of another uh seed from the man and the woman now I hope you can understand that is we we try to be delicate with maybe the way we express these things but I think that's just uh plain enough that God was intending this joining together this says comes back to the Commandment of Genesis 1 28 by mixing themselves together they would have brought forth children now if you look at Leviticus 19 I'll read just in two places in the Old Testament um on this and it's a vast subject but the Old Testament law forbade the practice of cross-breeding and you say well why there's just instead of spending a bunch of time showing it this is just the truth of it it weakens the Original Seed that by mixing this seed is good seed in this seed by mixing it together in doing so it doesn't it can't produce any one of the original seeds in its original form nor can it breed itself back and so it weakens it sows into weakness and it brings forth weakness in Leviticus 19 19. this shows God's attitude towards the mixing you shall keep my statutes Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind that word gender that means breed or reproduce with a diverse kind it's uh and then it'll say mingled seed this is the forbidden hybrid mixture that God is telling the children of Israel to not do themselves so don't let the cattle gender with a diverse kind do Thou shalt not Sow by filled with mingle seed and then just so as to make the point neither shall a garment mingled of linen and Woolen come upon thee so this is maybe I'll express it this way this is God's attitude towards that practice and it's not that some of this carries on as God as an abomination in the eyes of God but he's doing something very distinct to show us that God had something in the original that if it stayed in the original it would have brought forth something and he's cautioning them and warning them that if you do it this is what causes as it uses the phrase that mingled and that's what mongolize comes from this mingling or mixing uh you don't sow different seeds in your field don't don't gender your cattle with different kinds this is God's law now if I could say it this way don't make good Evil by mixing it don't make something that's good Evil by mixing it because even in the root of the word evil it means to be broken asunder therefore whatever God hath joined together let no man make it evil let no man put asunder don't let it be divided don't let it be broken up however God originally intended it to be don't make it Evil by mixing it and brother Branham and and I just forgot which sermon it was in but he said that the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil it was a mixed tree notice how it's mixed it's it's a mixture of Good and Evil God doesn't want good to become evil by mixing it but good two things that are good can become evil by mixing them incorrectly and really you could just take brother by Adam's teaching and say you all you have to do is do it out of season right that's all it takes is to make something that's good evil is to use it out of season and so he says as we bring that back to the tree of knowledge of good and evil evil means to break asunder it's something that's broken or divided and this is how you can make something that seemingly good evil is by mixing it and so when I said that this practice of cross-breeding is is forbidden and their ward of it in the Old Testament I say let's not gender your cattle with diverse kind uh don't mingle your seed it's because if the all if in the way that God originally intended it that you have a species if you change the ovum or the sperm in other words if you don't take the same whatever God had joined together this is they're they're to produce this zygote it's going to be this DNA together is going to produce this if you change it it hybrid it's a hybrid and which which and if I can say this way cannot perfectly reproduce because if something if if you have two of the same thing then you're going to get the same thing right you say this is this is by by progeny by distribution has got to say it's going to bring forth after its kind whatever life was in the plant the seed comes forth in the plant comes forth the seed and it has the ability then and The Power Within it to bring forth another one but if you take it and you divide it asunder and now you're going to take um egg and and and and ovum and you're going to take sperm and you're going to now try to breed something and whatever you produce they're from two different species or two different kinds it produces something that's half and being mixed how can it bring forth something that's perfectly halved how is it going to be able to reproduce itself it cannot reproduce itself perfectly and brother I I think I have I keep wanting to quote brother Branham I'm not even sure if you even used this scripture but Deuteronomy 22 9 it says Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with diverse seeds now again this is a prescription very similar to the one we just read in Leviticus don't sell thy vineyard with diverse seeds now this is before you would have scientifically done it or even intentionally done it for the purpose of bringing for something different but he's saying don't do it lest the fruit of thy seed which thy has sown and the fruit of thy Vineyard be defiled God knew the power of the seed and and no doubt by then there had already been different plantings and different ways of trying to bring forth hybrid mixture we even see it in the nature of of the children to cause forth speckled cattle to come forth in certain ways that you try to influence progeny and the way things would be brought forth says don't sow your vinegar with diverse seeds because then the fruit that you the seeds you've sown and the subsequent fruit is going to be defiled so again it says diverse seeds it means two different kinds or mixture this is the mixing of seeds that's forbidden by the law if you mix two different kinds of seeds then your product will be defiled or desecrated or Unholy it's going to be a mixed seed and so you get something hybrid as we're looking at this hybriding tonight I guess that would be maybe the thrust of how we're looking at worldly kingdoms worldly kingdoms that exist today are a hybrid of what God originally produced a hybrid is a thing made by combining two different elements hybrid with The Offspring of two dissimilar appearance or dissimilar stock it means it's The Offspring of two plants or two animals of a different species and that's where we'd say such as a mule that you're not taking the same species and you're though they'd be of the same kind of genus to be able to mix they bring forth something that's not quite the same it's something that is a hybrid Aaron I find this very interesting that the word hybrid comes from the Latin hybrida which means The Offspring of a tame sound a wild boar and this is where we get the very term hybrid is something that is tame and something that is wild and that's why I'm trying to I'm just doing this very slowly to show you that the tares that were introduced in the beginning are something that is mixed in something that's impure and it brought forth something that's not entirely man but not entirely serpent it's that wheat's evil twin those tears as we read before Sundays they're not exactly wild but they're not exactly tame and so the original sin broke God's law of reproduction it broke God's original order because the woman gendered a diverse kind of it's a great Wednesday nights maybe a great time to speak this plainly on the original sin because it's really a hard one for a lot of people to swallow and I find that maybe we just we believe it's so uh adamantly and we see it so clearly that maybe there's not a lot of teaching that spit on it because we just believe it but it's good for us to understand this because when you read in the church age book and you read in the Bible you'll find that a lot of the things that are being taught a lot of things are being said we understand more perfectly when we can recognize what's happened in the beginning but remember go back to the beginning you'll get your picture straight and that's what we're wanting to do brother Bradham says in the church age book is we're looking at how what the woman she gendered a diverse kind he said the first son Adam was the spoken seed word of God he was the son of God he was a daughter of God he was a direct descent he had the nature of his parent he would have passed that on he was given a bride to reproduce himself that's what she's for that's what she's to do God made the woman in such a way to where what at whatever Adam put into her she would bring forth that's what that's what she had the she had the power of and I think it's a very good reminder for us to know as husbands whatever we're gonna whatever we're gonna give out we're gonna probably gonna get it back just a good reminder he was given a bride to reproduce himself that is why the bride was given him to reproduce himself to produce another Son of God but she fell so notice just how clear her role was and how they'd be joined together and it'd produce that that cell would begin to form to bring forth another child just like him but she fell and he uses this phrase she fell by hybridization she caused him to die through the hybriding but Brahman referring to it in the church age but say oh it was a fruit as the fruit he says no it was the degradation of humanity by intermingling the seed this is how brother bam taught us the original sin it degraded Humanity by intermingling the seed of the human Adam and the woman with that seed of the serpent he spoke a word to the Original Seed he said she crossed her seed she mingled it with the serpent Siege she brought a child of death think of that she brought a child to death a child that she perverted every child after that through that Crossing her seed I hope I hope that it's just plain to you and I know that these are things I'm not breaking new ground uh today in any way but I'm wanting you just to see plainly the emphasis that Brothers brother M is putting on this she crossed her seeds she fell by hybrid and it brought this is a maybe the real uh part maybe I uh I want you to catch this part death came by that clearly that's how death came now Genesis chapter 3 we'll start with verse 14. we maybe have to 16 but maybe we might stop a little early we've gone over this scripture so often I think we can just read it now after the indeed has been done and the seed has been sown the Lord God said unto the serpent because thou has done this Thou Art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt not go and thus shalt thou eat all the days of thy life and I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his Hill and then verse 16 is going greater into how the woman in sorrow will bring forth children and and the desire to her husband he shall rule over thee but notice how when he's cursing the serpent the curse of the serpent raises the image of the seed of the woman and the seed of The Serpent and being message Believers we know why it says because thou Hast done this the whole world reads it says because you lied to the woman this is what's going to happen no it was more than just a lie the LIE is what brought forth the ACT this is because thou has done this you are going to be cursed and as he curses them and in the image of him being cursed and coming into the ground to eat the dust of the earth he says I'll put enmity between thee and the woman and then this greater emphasis between via seed and her seed so in the curse he's wanting this picture of the seat of The Serpent and the seed of the woman to be represented and then the transformation of the serpent foreshadows the process that would set into Humanity as the serpent beguiled Eve and caused her to fall there's a mixing that takes place and this mixing would change the entire human species and brother Branham I'll say it changed man Adam and what his race was to be it was going to be a particular way had a particular Gene set it was going to be in the nature of God after the parent of Adam this is the way it was going to be brother Branham is you drawing from what happened to the Garden he says the same thing happens to denominations and he says the whole specie has changed I feel like I may be reading from the wrong Church age book or something with so few amens tonight you've read these things haven't you dust it up don't be afraid of the church age book dust It Off I mean many people tell you Shakespeare wrote the King James version Bible and we're not afraid of that trust the Lord there's things we can learn from these things he says and so now listen to how brother Bradham said it he says you know what a hybrid is what comes of two species mixing the result is no longer pure like the original it is mongrel so when you mix something the result is no longer pure like the original so it doesn't that's again this is my emphasis it doesn't mean that you have to take something evil and mix it with something good he's just saying if you've take taken two species good species good species but different species right and you mix them that product is no longer pure like the original that's what a hybrid is he says well Eve allowed the Beast to mingle his seed with hers she produced a creature cocaine that wasn't pure human now that's striking because then this is where we recognize that this is what brother Brown says she perverted every child after that because in the process of time it's foreshadowed and now the serpent is going to come down to the Earth and he's going to fall take over the whole earth and he's going to have or he's going to come down to the Earth he's going to rock upon the Earth he's going to Slither upon the Earth then in that transforming of the serpent of an upright Beast to the Eater of the Dust God is showing us this is what's been sewn into Adam the king of Eden this this race that was above all race the one that was given dominion over all the Earth it's now going to succumb to the Earth that's going to be hybrid and drawn down there she produced a creature called Cain that wasn't pure human he was of the wicked one notice how different he was from Abel notice how different he was from Seth he hated God and would not obey the word and persecuted and killed the righteous he says he set himself up above the word of God Network program said shows the serpent seed they can't humble themselves to the word of God they just can't do it and so he says he hated God and would not obey the word and persecuted and killed the righteous that's the mark of it even to this day for the very moment that God said the woman seed will crush the head of the seed of the serpent the seed of the serpent is represented by this entity that is no longer pure human right that is how the serpent lives on inhumanity not in the snakes upon the Earth but in Cain so that's the seat of the serpent this mixing this mixed creature and so he says the seed of the serpent that that nature that mixed nature is going to be crushed by the seed of the woman Satan knew that the curse was going to be lifted off of man Satan knew that whatever was sown into Humanity whatever he sowed into the human race there was going to be the seed of the woman because the seed of the woman is going to bring it back to the original he said this is going to be I I've managed to produce a hybrid but now he's saying the seed of the woman which this the devil knew that would have to be a pure child between Adam and the the woman Satan knew that so what happens immediately he knew that the pure seed of the woman would Prevail so what happens as soon as Abel manifests and came manifest Cain murders Abel because Satan knows that's the seed of the woman and he's afraid that that's going to be the one that'll kill Cain because if Cain had been dealt within think about it I mean if pain just would have kind of everybody says if we could just go back in a time machine and kill Hitler right oh we'd like and we just would solve the Holocaust and we wouldn't have a World War II it's like well you know I don't know how much luck he might have with them I think why did they just kill Cain in the beginning well how many hypothecate on that all the time but it was the nature of the seed within Cain to rise up against the righteous Abel and he and he kills them but this is and I just say that because that's where he says he hated and would not obey the word and persecute and killed the righteous it's because Satan knew the plan of God and was always waiting for the seed of the woman to come forth as we read on on Sunday Isaiah 14 12. how about fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer son of the morning how about cut down to the ground there's your image of Satan being cast out of heaven now embodying the serpent and that serpent that he used is cut down to the ground the Bible says you're going to crawl on my belly you're going to be you're going to be cursed above all cattle every beast of the field upon my belly thou shall go thou shall I eat dust all the days of your life it's represented here in Lucifer cut down to the ground and then what did the serpent do he intermingled seed and a caused mankind to die and the Bible says which does weaken the Nations there's your Humanity being brought low there's it's being brought down to the Earth it's it's losing its connection man was to be intended to be upright or has intended to be that that fastening Between Heaven and Earth but now through the fall that's cut off he loses the holy image of God he doesn't have that connection to heaven anymore he's now entirely EarthBound he's been brought down to the Earth it's weakened and mingled the Nations which nations there's Humanity and now with that with those things said this is going to be kind of a little bit of a pivot here in the sermon future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride but the man says then what happened he set Adam and Eve here on the earth and said multiply now and replenish the earth now remember this from a couple Sundays ago their bodies were all laid out here for you to eat and make your body it's already laid out all the materials already laid out already in the earth already by the spoken word he says their bodies were already laid out here it was in the earth he says for you to eat make your body that's the that's the way he had of doing it so that means God's original program Genesis 1 and 2 it's a framed person perfect picture all the spoken word is already in there and if it it would have brought forth just exactly the way that God had intended it to he said that's the way God's doing it all the materials laying out there like a contractor putting out all this material it's already there he says their bodies already laid out here for you to eat and make your body it was already in there and is it not the very things that we feed on today that have come from the earth that are giving us the energy and the minerals and the nutrients in order to form this body to to be healthy and to cause it to grow it's that energy being furnished to the DNA that's already inside of you expressing what's in the blueprint he says but sin came along and interrupted his plan and we know that that means that Satan worked out which was necessary to fulfill the master plan right so it interrupts his plan but it was all part of his plan did you get that his plan's been interrupted but it was his plan to have the plan interrupted so now he says of the Earth she rolls right on time and the Earth and everything she rolls right on just the same time does so once Satan interrupted it everything's there sorry it's in the earth he says now everything that's going to be has already been sown and now the man and the woman they they mix there's a mix in a seed Cain comes forth Abel then Seth he says time just rolls on everything just goes on he says in the same sermon you see how Satan got to Eve now and that's why death has reigned on Earth ever since wanting this to be such a clear picture to us when we look at the kingdoms of this world when we think of the things that exist in the world today when Satan got to Eve he said that's why death has reigned on Earth ever since and Heavens Earth Beast atmosphere is all cursed of God because of it filling up all of these things are cursed because of it that's the curse because Satan got to this first so are we able to come to a spot then to recognize what took place in Genesis 3 what is taking place in Genesis 4 and in the successive chapters what's coming out until we get to Abraham you see all worldly kingdoms coming into into being and then from there everything else is just a reiteration of it going stronger and growing greater growing more evil but if I could say this I want to end on a positive note I want to go ahead and continue so I can end with a few more amens tonight hopefully God's original plan cannot be defeated however the seeds that he sowed will not return to him void the kingdom as we're just using that phrase we're not trying to create some nomenclature that we can only use it's just a way of describing something so we all think about the same thing the kingdom would be restored and it is prophesied as the seed of the woman so read with me in Hebrews chapter 2 verses 9 to 8 18. I just want to read this because I feel that with this background with this Foundation we can read this it just has so much Rich uh meaning and depth and color to it so it says in Hebrews 2 verse 9 we'll read to verse 18 but we see Jesus who is made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death this is why he was made lower than the angels for the suffering of death death has reigned ever since the eve fell and caused a hybrid product to come forth so one is by judgment other one is by seed by mixing it's just sewn into it could we I could make the point now you notice how long man would live early on that even the pure the pure seed from Adam lived longer and they died because God says you want the day you eat the day you die so by judgment not no one could live that Thousand Years but but for the rest they they're dying because the mixing of seed they're weakened they they just get younger or they get they live they die younger and die Younger die younger why because it was through the mixing through the hybriding and so Jesus is going to come made lower than the Angels try so he's made now he's man this may lower the age he's coming in the image of humanity as Adam would have been a spiritual supernatural being that would have inhabited flesh you're trying to say in this hierarchy he comes forth as a flesh being and we see him but we see Jesus crowned with Glory and Honor there's your king that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man for it became him for whom are all things by whom are all things in bringing many sons unto glory to the same Crown to the same Throne to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings for both he that sanctifieth and they who are Sanctified are all of One for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren so the sanctifier has Sanctified those that are his he says they're all one he's not ashamed to call your brethren and then now Paul quotes from different scriptures according from the Psalms according from Isaiah saying I will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the church it may be congregation in Psalms in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee I will declare it by name unto my brethren in the midst of the church to say this is the Affinity this is the connection and again I will put my trust in him and again behold I and the children which God hath given me this has to do with uh progeny and procreation and reproduction that he's going to be the firstborn among many Brethren he is going to have he has a nature that is divine and those who are the children of God will share the same nature and and be won together with them they will be the same life they have to be in order to be the for him to be the firstborn among any Brethren has to have the same exact nature doesn't say the first half Brothers they have to be the he has to be the firstborn among many brother not half brother and half sisters it have to be the same two pair the same parents for as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood which we are he also himself likewise took part of the same why did he take part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil Satan from the beginning wanted to kill the seed of the woman and that was part of the plan that God had when Satan set forth his plan and the Bible even tells us that had the princes of this world known what was going to happen they wouldn't have crucified the Lord Of Glory had Satan known that by killing him would it actually be the great foil to his plan he would not have done it but Satan he says Satan had the power of death he's the one that part of the devil why because he's the one that brought the death through the mixing so Jesus comes having bypassed the mix having been the seed that was prophesied to come the Original Seed when he comes God then and just I guess it just passes our understanding it's so hard for us to even grasp what happens but he tastes death that through that death it destroyed the power of death he defeated death by death and death is going to die he says and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetimes subject to bondage he's loosening us from death severely he took on him the nature took not on him the nature of angels but he took on him the Seed of Abraham wherefore in all things it behooved him to be made likened to his brethren that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God to make reconciliation for the sins of the people now this is we sing it but recognize it in this instance he was made likened unto us not that he would remain like us and just merely die the death of us but we see him who suffered death being crowned with Glory and Honor so by his death he has forever consecrated a way that we would not remain in this human state but that we too could become like him that's why he says we're brother and he says he that sanctifies which would be Christ by the shedding of his blood and he that has Sanctified we who are Sanctified by the blood are children of God we are back to the original seat again we're back to the original life we are removed from the bondage of the fear of death so oh well what about those that die it doesn't matter that's just something that happens to this flesh that Still Remains hybrid but there's been a new nature birth on inside of you listen this is why you must be born again my I don't I don't God forgive me if I say this the wrong way I don't understand why we get so confused on the new birth and the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the point brother braham's trying to make but he says there's a difference why because there can be an anointing that can fall on flesh and that anointing may never change a person but the new birth makes you a new creature to be born again brings you out from under the hybrid nature and sets inside of you it's your soul a carousel that can never die deliver them oh praise the Lord be made like unto his brethren so he can be a faithful high priest knowing what we're going through was he not tempted in all that like in manner as we are yet knew no sin I say well does uh perfection does the Perfection relate to sinlessly snow because he was made perfect through suffering so it's not just a sinless Perfection that makes us perfect it's that process in the verse 18 I guess this I wanted to get read all the way to this friend that he himself hath suffered being tempted he's able to secure them that are tempted he's able to help you take this to Heart tonight I felt impressed to end on this scripture to to know that he who is perfect who's been crowned with Glory and Honor who has come after the original program of God the Son of God the spoken word Son of God who've come into flesh a taste of death for us who suffered being tempted and he's able to help them that are tempted this is the power of the king this is the power that Christ can give now that when we are tempted he is able to help us because wherein is that we are tempted it's going to be yet still in the realm of our flesh in the realm of our mind it's going to be through those senses of the mind and body that's the realm in which we are going to be tempted he says I am able to help you when you're tempted brother Branham says in the church age book chapter three we'll invite our brothers to come to their instruments then there was to come a day when God would appear in flesh and by the means of his humiliation he would restore Fallen men and make him a partaker of that life eternal he says once you see this you can understand the serpent seed and know that it was no apple Eve ate once you see this you can see that it was no apple this is why God he came apart from the instrumentality of man this is why God formed him in the womb of a virgin this is why God took these of his own without borrowing it from a hybrid man or Barnet from a hybrid woman he took original and he mixed it together and he brought forth the pure a pure Son of God bypassing that act bypassing the timing and and the the placement of the original sin and he said that day would come when God would appear in flesh this is what's being spoken of here in Hebrews 2 9 that Jesus made lower than the Angels this is God appearing in human flesh and he would restore Fallen man and make him a partaker of life eternal brother Branham says in chapter three the seat of the womb was literally God reproducing himself in human flesh he is not using literally figuratively he's using literally literally the seat of the woman was literally God reproducing himself in human flesh that's what's represented in Genesis 3. brother says but God came in the flesh follow me God came in the flesh give us another birth to bring us back to original Sons and Daughters of God that's why except you be born again you cannot see the kingdom of heaven but the man well I had someone testify to me recently just the impact your sermon made when you're talking about raising the message knew all about it but you must be born again you must be born again you're being taught Kingdom principles in your home you're being taught about the kingdom you're learning things about Christ you're learning things about the word of God but unless you're born again don't take this the wrong way and I'm not necessarily saying in a bad way but it's me it's not entirely a good thing until that happens you are only the product of your parents no matter how much you believe no matter how much you believe it's true you must be born again because cry God Came In the Flesh to give us another birth and it's by the new birth that we come back to original Sons and Daughters of God [Music] by that life that now lives within our souls now I want to read this statement this is the same the the statement the quote I read when we in the last sermon of this series he says we belong to a kingdom and the kingdom is the word of God made spirit and life in our own life bringing to pass every promise in this day as it did in that day when the word and God were one see that Oneness see that in order to be United together with them you are him you have to be him because that was the picture in the beginning that God had set that God had framed and what's remarkable in this before God could Brethren says this and this is the part I was pulling all these things out but the bigger picture and the bigger narrative that he's using in all these places is the picture in the at the day of Pentecost here's a church that comes forth just like the woman was given to Adam to reproduce another atom to reproduce another Son of God Christ was given a church on the day of Pentecost to reproduce himself he says before he could come to her she was hybrid and so through successive ages there's still this hybrid nature in there until the end he's able to bring it back to the original and that's why we can be raptured that's why there can be a harvest because that seed comes back to its Perfection again in the representation of the Bride it'll bring up all the individuals down throughout time who were born again [Music] to bring to pass every promise in this day as it did in that day when the word in God Was Won Hallelujah could we pray tonight together as you stand [Music]
