TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Matthew chapter 17:es 1 to8 just remember that in the prior verse Jesus has said there's some standing here who will not die until they see the son of man coming in his kingdom and then this is what they saw verse one and after six days Jesus taketh Peter James and John his brother and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart and was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and his reignment was white as the light and behold there appeared unto them Moses and Elias which is Elijah talking with Then answered Peter and said, Jesus, Lord, it is good for us. Said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here. If thou wilt, let us make care three tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias. I yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and build a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved son, in whom I'm well pleased. Hear ye him. And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were so afraid. And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid. When they lifted up their eyes, they saw no man save Jesus only. Wow. What an extraordinary uh vision. What a thing to see. You can be seated. I've given a title to my sermon today, brilliant beauty. Uh considered, you know, just different titles that we could give this, but as we've been on a particular subject all year, there's something about beauty and something that is attractive. And we're wanting to draw from here in verse two where it says his face did shine as the sun and there was this brilliance and there was this beauty that's being expressed. And though it's only expressed in just a few words about his face did shine as the sun and his reignment was white as the light, it's trying to convey something so striking to the eye. This this that it was engaging and it was very attractive. And I want to use this thought of a brilliant beauty drawing from um the characteristic of light. Now, if you'll turn to Luke 11:es 33 and 34, this will kind of catch up where we've been the last couple service services. It says, "No man, when he hath lighted a candle, putteth it in a secret place, neither under a bushel, which we know if it's in a secret place, the light isn't going to shine in any relevant manner." Or under a bushel, that's a filter, something that's going to diffuse the light or diminish its power. that they which come in but on a candlestick that they which come in may see the light. So this is this example of how light is going to be placed in certain ways that it might be effective. So we realize that light has power. Light has purpose. So he says the light of the body is the eye. Now this is speaking to you as a believer because you are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hid. A light is placed upon a candlestick not under a bushel that it might give light to all that are in the house. So the light of your body is the eye. Therefore, when thine eye is single, unmixed, pure, thy whole body is full of light. So there's this illumination inwardly. But when thine eye is evil, the body also is full of darkness. So that mixed double-mindedness, double tongedness, the uh the lack of singularity, the lack of the simplicity of Christ kind of divides us, divides our attention, divides our loyalties and therefore our body uh is darkness. He says full of darkness. So this light having power and purpose. Then Jesus talks about this internal light that we have and this internal light that we have must be expressed externally. Other words, we know we must give light. Where we left off last Sunday is right here at Philippians chapter 2. We didn't come to it, but we are now. Philippians chapter 2 verses 12 to 18. Now, just really draw into this uh uh this reading here because we were talking about uh I think maybe then it was mixed media and the mixing of things and this uh this lack of purity. He's going to use this word harmless which is unmixed. Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence. And so the the brother Eleaser ministered on this scripture here recently was very, very applicable. But now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which workketh in you, both to will and to do of his good pleasure. Consider this. Just let this be something that you remind yourself of that God is in you both to desire, to will, to give uncction, and to do what pleases him. &gt;&gt; There's something really remarkable when you look at uh uh the scriptures, and I've been reading in the Psalms where it says, "In the Lord, I will praise him." And and there's a certain thought that's being expressed in that to where there's things that we're doing that aren't separate and apart from God that just make it this one perfect, complete whole. And I know that might be a fragment to you in terms of a thought, but I've just been thinking of these things and they're so powerful. God in us to will and to do of his good pleasure. So he says, "Do all things without murmurings and disputings that you may be blameless and harmless, unmixed." &gt;&gt; Blameless and harmless, the sons of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation. And all the Americans said, "Amen." In the midst of a crooked and perverse nation. So, we realize we're called to allow this God that is in us to willing to do of his good pleasure. We're to have a certain attitude. No murmurings or disputings that we be blameless and homeless. Uh homeless harmless. I'm not prophesying. Never claimed to be a prophet in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation among whom ye shine as lights in the world. So now the God that is in us is wanting to be externally expressed. And it's said that we are to be lights &gt;&gt; in in darkness. The word to shine as lights in darkness. Holding forth the word of life that I may rejoice in the day of Christ that I have not Is that the name of your church, brother Ben? His word of life. Or did I I see what what symmetry here? What good things are happening? The holding forth the word of life that I may rejoice in the day of Christ that I have not run in vain neither labored in vain. Yay. And if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy and rejoice with you all. For the same cause also do ye joy, rejoice with me. There's the reward of the laboring and the servants work. But his desire that where is this rejoicing and joy going to come from? Seeing light expressed in the believer &gt;&gt; among whom you shine as lights in the world holding forth the word of life. So there's that. How do we shine forth into a dark world in this crooked and perverse nation? We do it by applying the word of God. By holding forth the word of life. &gt;&gt; And by holding forth this word of life. By applying it uh we become lightbears or luminaries. &gt;&gt; We become these these uh we express and declare light. And if I could say this, I may have mentioned it to some extent on on Sunday, but I was kind of tracking this last Sunday that the the faithful Christian will not be content without making an effort to express Christ. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; A genuine Christian is not going to find themselves satisfied or happy unless they have made some effort to display and express Christ. &gt;&gt; I hope by saying that some of you are like, "Ah, now there's the reason for my melancholy. I'm not making an effort. I'm not I'm not trying to apply myself holding forth. It doesn't say laying there homeless, right? It says harmless as a as a home for heaven. The word of God is in YOUR HEART. NOW, I want it to radiate. AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE truly satisfied UNLESS YOU MAKE SOME effort to directly reflect or express Christ. The word of life, holding forth the word of life, which is light. The Bible says in John 1:4, "In him was life." This is the word and the life was the light of men. &gt;&gt; Tells us there's life in the word and the life that is in the word is the word of life which we find not only in Philippians but in first John and different places. This word of life and this word of life is the light of men. &gt;&gt; It's this life of light. You could even go back to the beginning when God breathed uh breath into Adam. He became a living soul. He was filled with light. And this light that he had inside of him, this was the light of men. This is what lit humanity. This is what made him a living soul. In Psalms 36:9, for with thee is the fountain of life. In thy light shall we see light. Now, isn't that interesting? In thy light shall we see light. I mean, we could say in thy light we shall see light. But there's this in his light, we can see. We we have life and this light was the light of man. It was the true light. The fountain of wisdom and holiness and and happiness and man in his original state. That life was the light of man. And this light is the hope of humanity. It is our it is our strength. It is our power of all things that are truly beautiful and genuine. The word of life is light. It is beauty. It is power. Light. Even in the scripture it says in God's light we see light. It's a force of reason that understanding which is which is kindled in our minds to know God. The word of life is the light of man. It's by the word hearing of the word that we have faith in God. And it's that word of life that enlightens us. In thy light we shall see light. Life is understanding and and knowledge and power. So the question I am posing today is I often like maybe just to help myself along because the question is asked you know what's your point and and that's the question I ask myself often but is Christ beautiful in your eyes I is he beautiful in your eyes does this aura and charisma of Christ attract you &gt;&gt; this the Bible describes him in ways uh that we could say well those are just agit And that's just a description and that just says light and that just says white and that just says this. But it's it's using a language to describe something that we're not seeing &gt;&gt; with our natural eye. &gt;&gt; But in his light we see light. In him the word is life. And that life is the light of man so that we may see. And so, has there been an illumination of Christ in our souls that now he being this word of life to us, WE CAN HOLD HIM forth as light in a crooked and perverse generation? &gt;&gt; We were reading from George Mat's uh rest by the river devotional to you on Wednesday night and he was using the scriptures in Luke chapter 11 and he said, "You will imprint Christ upon my life when you have made him beautiful to my eye. that if Christ is going to be impressed, if he's going to be seen, if he's going to be expressed, then he must first be made beautiful to our eyes. &gt;&gt; And he was talking about what we admire and what we set forth as heroic and what we desire uh um to experience or to see. And he says, what is that picture of heroism which you have set before your inward eye? In other words, you have some external image of what a hero is. And if that hero is John Wayne, to use a relevant character, a timely character, or maybe let's update him a little bit. If that is Rambo, then you're going to look at that as a hero, then that's going to be what you aspire to be. That's what you're you're going to say, "This is what heroism looks like." He says, "What is that picture of heroism you've set before your inward eye?" He exclaims in effect, and he's talking about Jesus in Luke 11, it is no use to lay down rules of morality. That's that legalism. These are the rules. Follow it. What is your model of perfection? Your ideal of beauty, &gt;&gt; your standard of excellence. &gt;&gt; Think of it. If we if we just gave you all a list of rules, and I know some of you wish we would do that, &gt;&gt; just tell me what to eat, tell me what to wear, tell me where to go, tell me what to do, tell me what car to buy, where to get a job, where to go to church. Just tell me everything. And we'll just follow it like a list of rules. A and tell ourselves, as long as I'm doing this, I'm okay. But there's no use in laying down rules of morality. The question is what's your model of perfection? What what's your what's what do you consider beautiful? What's the standard of excellence that you're trying to achieve? He says everything depends on that. &gt;&gt; Ultimately, what you're going to express, what you're going to pursue, what you're going to do is going to fit somewhere within what you believe to be these models, these ideals, and these standards. Brother Bam in the sermon things that are to be as we're talk we're following up on this statement of is Christ beautiful in your eye and has what you see is it imprinted on you. He says you're nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in God. &gt;&gt; So as a son of God you are the manifestation of the word of life. In him was life and the life was the light of men. Now you are light. You are holding forth the word of life. You are the attributes of God. He says now you're expressed after his word has come in you to light up this age. You are expressed to light up this age. Says what Paul is saying that you may in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation in the time you're living now. &gt;&gt; Listen, I we're not trying to build up an archive of social media post so that a hundred years from now they're going to look at the LIGHT BACK IN 2025 and say, "My, weren't they really good Christians over there off Wahala?" Right? They said, "Weren't they just brilliant Christians?" No, right now in the age that you're living in now, you're to shine forth to light up this age. You're expressing God's life in you because you're a son or daughter of God. You are now made, you're setting in this church because your duty is to express God. &gt;&gt; Your duty is to express God. It's God that workketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure that you might be holding forth the word of life in a crooked and perverse nation as lights in the world. Therefore, our duty is to express God to this nation, to this people, and to this neighborhood where you associate. &gt;&gt; So, you are to express God in your neighborhood. &gt;&gt; You want to be a good neighbor. You want to love thy neighbor even when their trees are encroaching on your yard. Even if they don't let you pick the lemons from their tree that's hanging over into your backyard, you're to love your neighbor. And if we are, we have a duty because there think of this power of light. If light is shining, then light in Ephesians it says light reproves. And so there's a there's a shining of light into our hearts that reproves us and corrects us. Then there's a reflection back out of the light which that light then it becomes a reproof. We're expressing Christ. We are holding forth a word of life and therefore it shines as lights in the world. And this light shining it means you have the power to shape. You have the power to to uh um highlight and you have a power to shape desire and admiration. &gt;&gt; What is the picture of heroism you set before your eye? What are you shedding light on? What is being illuminated? So there's an influence that we that we hold as Christians. So this is there's an expression that influences perception because that's what light's going to do. And as we read from that rest by the river, beware what ideal you suggest to the admiration of the child. So this is the responsibility. Our duty is to express Christ, express God to our neighbors. So then what we uh what we lift up and what we express as idilic idealic and what we express as something good, we suggest it to here the admiration of our children. When we make violence heroic, when we make abuse of power beautiful, we make selfishness desirable. &gt;&gt; There's things that we can uh express. And when we do so, you do it to the admiration of your child. &gt;&gt; When there's things that you give attention to, things you support, things you watch, things you listen to, things that you talk about, it it's suggested to the admiration of the child. &gt;&gt; Is that true? don't often ask you to agree with me or for give you AN OPPORTUNITY TO SAY NO IT'S NOT UH IS it so one I can't remember who it was one time did that I don't know if it was uh I don't know was it was it Ben was he the one that did it I can't remember where is he where did they go they're back there some there they are him that said it one time or was it was it one of your daughters that said nom just disagreed with me the little cookie bear it's she called me out on something one time But there is a an expression of light that's going to highlight something and we need to think what is it we're lifting up. What what is it we're making beautiful in someone else's eye? &gt;&gt; Right &gt;&gt; now you may recognize these things as being very familiar not just over the last few weeks but we're revisiting subjects from the very beginning of the year in the first few months of the year. 21st century Christ we looked at uh the sacred symmetry and we were looking at Christ being expressed today. And then when we we preached a sermon on ugliness and then from there we kind of got into a a whole section on some other things and it was God's word discerning God's word leading into areas that needed to be addressed and we see the supernatural hand of God and how he addressed certain things. But the question is what is it that we are making beautiful &gt;&gt; because there are ways and I'm just trying to think of a way to say this. There are ways that we can make Christ unnecessarily unattractive. And I say that because Christ in his truth is not really attractive to the world. &gt;&gt; The carnal mind is at enmity with God. If Christ represents God, then the carnal mind kind of instinctively repulses at Christ. &gt;&gt; And so the life which is humanity's light has been filtered so much, manipulated, and incorrectly perceived so that man in his fallen STATE DOES NOT SEE GOD as he is. Remember man in the garden who was perfect and knew everything or had a perfect knowledge, a perfect understanding of love of God. As soon as he sinned in THAT DEBASE STATE, HE RAN FROM GOD fearing him, &gt;&gt; wasn't drawn to that presence. HE DIDN'T PINE AFTER THAT PRESENCE. He didn't cling to him instinctively and say, "Oh my, WASH ME, MAKE ME WHOLE." THE IMAGE OF GOD HAD CHANGED. And as we've been speaking about mixed media and different things and poison, I almost brought my poison card that uh that someone gave me and and was going to show it and I had it in my coat pocket and I left it in a very safe place because I didn't want to lose my poison card. But there are there is a legalism that we could use to take away certain things, take away media, take away um certain privileges or certain things. We restrict uh people's freedoms or liberties and we do it with the wrong motive and objective and that makes Christ unnecessarily unattractive. When you read in the word of God that he wants us to be uh blameless and harmless, when we read that he wants us to walk circumspectfully with wisdom and not foolishness, and we see what the Bible in the New Testament requires of us, we're not even getting into the Old Testament. What the Bible requires of us, it's like it's a standard that if you're honest and you look, it says, "Well, I don't know if I really want to do that. That's not very attractive. That that's not appealing to me in my flesh." AND SO THERE'S WAYS that we could take the true word of God and then begin to utilize it legalistically or with the wrong motive and objective. And that leads to manipulation and it leads to a hypocrisy that makes Christ unnecessarily unattractive. &gt;&gt; In the Old Testament, we saw where God had called Israel to get rid of all the mediums, get rid of all the witches and the soothsayers and the necromancers and all these ones with spirits of divination. He said, "PUT THEM AWAY. They're an abomination to me. They're evil practices. They'll only cause you to sin. And it said in 1 Samuel that Saul had put away all those familiar spirits and the wizards out of the land, taking shots at the wizards, too. And then what does what does Saul do? He put them out. But what did he do? He went right back and visited them. Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; So when he visits the medium, he's he it shows that his original efforts to banish wizards and mediums was not word-based, &gt;&gt; but maybe politically based, &gt;&gt; maybe uh pretense, &gt;&gt; the the the the the person the the politics of appearances &gt;&gt; and therefore he could be hypocritical about it. AND WHAT WOULD THAT MAKE THE RULE? YOU GO BACK AND YOU LOOK AT THE WELL THE KING PUT AWAY ALL THESE things and then you see somebody that's hypocritical with it. It makes the word unattractive. &gt;&gt; And as we're still trying to take a step further in terms of u the mixing of things and being unmixed, we used the we were using the phrase last time that now because Saul had these mixed motives, his results were mixed. went to see a medium. He was mixing things. Now, Nehemiah chapter 13:es 1:3, I'm reading this because there's this response of the people to the word of God to be harmless or unmixed to to observe the word of God, to obey the word of God. It says, "On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people. And therein was found written that the Ammonite and the Moabitete should not come into the congregation of God forever because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Balam against them that he should curse them. How be it, our God turned the curse into a blessing." We understand the story of Balum. Now it came to pass when they heard the law that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude. Now this phrase they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude had a very specific application as in the law the Ammonite and the Moabitete should not come into the congregation of God forever. But this response of the people upon hearing the word indicates that there was some deep conviction and clarity about what they're supposed to do. They didn't just hear the word and be like that was a good sermon. Really enjoyed that. and a and continued to live as they were. But they this response when IT CAME TO PASS WHEN THEY HEARD THE law they obeyed it and they separated according to what the law had asked them to do. And this what what is described as a collective decision when they heard the law they separated from Israel and all the mixed multitude. It was achieved through this individual understanding, some individual con uh conviction that began to uh have this collective momentum. Say this is what we must do according to the word of God. So we can say well the word of God was read and everybody heard the word and like okay well I guess we better get rid of the Moabites. But notice in Nehemiah chapter 8 verses 1 to3 and all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the street that was before the Watergate. That's the original Watergate. And they spake unto Ezra. I am not a crook. They spake unto Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses which the Lord had commanded to Israel. So now they want the word to come forth. We want it to be read. And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both of men and women and all that could hear with understanding. So I think this is a key part. So you as parents, as adults, as believers filled the Holy Ghost, you're the ones that can hear the word with understanding upon the first day of the seventh month. And he read therein before the street that was before the Watergate from the morning until midday. That's my goal today. Before the men and the women and those who could understand, and the ears of all the people were attentive unto the book of the law. So they didn't just hear a dry sermon. They just didn't hear it recited. and they just weren't showing up to do the homaly and to do the the mass and to do the the tradition and to play the tape or to DO THESE THINGS. IT WASN'T SOME SORT OF formal recitation of scripture. Just have a reader do it, just have this. But they came and as they heard the words, they believed that it was from God and it was giving them instruction and that it was to be for them a light. &gt;&gt; And hearing the word with understanding led the individual to conviction and then a decision. I'm hearing the word clearly. I understand that it's asking me to do this and therefore they did it. &gt;&gt; There is a brilliance that sheds light on the truth of the word. And this is what happened when the word was read. It was illuminated to them. It became light to them and they had to act upon it. This is where uh the Bible speaks of light has sprung up. But men didn't want to believe the light. They refused the light. And so there's this brilliance of the word of God that shines upon the word and we're like this is it. This is the truth. This is what we must do. There's a critical moment when in which you respond to that in Psalms 90 16 and 17. Let thy work appear unto thy servants and thy glory unto their children. Think of this phrase. God's glory is manifested to the children by the work that he shows their parents. Let the work thy work appear unto thy servants. So as God reveals himself to his servants, then the glory is expressed to the children both him to in you both to will and to do. It's the work of God in us. And let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us. I think that's connected with the glory. The glory is going to be appear to our children. Let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us that his glory may be seen by our children and establish thou the work of our hands upon us. Yay, the work of our hands establish thou it. The beauty of the Lord, his kindness, his pleasantness. That's what this beauty refers to. This delightfulness, his sweetness, even it means a loveliness. These are things that are attractive. These are things we say, well, is it sweet or sour? Is it good or is it bad? These are things that are kind, that are pleasant, that are sweet, that are lovely. And I realized and and I'm just taking a little bit of an aside, but this kind of became the the heart of my emphasis as I was studying it over the last week or so. And where we're maybe going to arrive at this point is how that beauty can be objective or could be argued to be objective like this as the philosophers argued that there was a beauty that an absolute beauty manifest in symmetry and proportion and order. But then you had some these stoics on the other hand who saw it maybe a little bit more broadly that there can be a beauty that is subjective. So it exists as a sum of the parts that you see beauty in the individual itself by how things are all proportioned or how things are worked together by some relationship or just in inward goodness. So they didn't look at there's different ways that you could look at say well there's a beauty that's inward or that is subjective or there's a subjective beauty but called symmetry and proportion and order and and for those of you who are familiar Confucious said everything has its beauty but not everyone sees it. very interesting cultural traditions and views of beauty in the Chinese culture. He says everything has a beauty but not everyone sees it. So it stands for the phrase that we might use beauty is in the eye of the beholder. &gt;&gt; That we we say well beauty is just in the eye of the one who's perceiving that judgments of beauty are subjective. What you think is beautiful somebody else may not find beautiful. what people find pleasing, somebody else might may not find pleasing. Reminds me of haunted houses. Some people want to go to a haunted house. I'm like, why would I want to voluntarily offer myself up to be scared? I I don't I don't understand that. So, yes, there's certain things. Beauty, we can say, well, maybe we say beauty is absolute, but obviously horror is subjective. But it subjects when there says beauty is in the eye of the beholder, it suggests beauty is determined by the observer's perception that it's rather than there being some sort of inherent quality that makes it beautiful, we all just have our own decisions and our own judgments of what is beautiful. Now, this is where things have turned because we can read in the word of God and we see things are set a certain way and we are wanting you to consider that the word of God is beautiful and but to the carnal mind it's not and that would mean it's subjective because God is objectively beautiful. &gt;&gt; The word is objectively perfect. &gt;&gt; There is a an objective truth. It's called the word of God. &gt;&gt; The word of God is the truth. No matter what you think about it, no matter what you've made it, &gt;&gt; no matter what others have made it, who've made it unnecessarily unattractive, it's still the truth. &gt;&gt; The ugly truth, as we may say. But man, there it's so there's a if it's subjective, that's well, it's your opinion and there's not some inherent quality of being beautiful and that's what people will do, right? To absolve themselves of obedience. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I don't think it's true. What have they they've made it subjective to their own rationality and understanding and it doesn't have this inherent quality of truth. It's to each his own. In Proverbs chapter 16 verse two, it says, "All the ways of man are clean in his own eyes, but the Lord weighth the spirit." There's 31 chapters in the book of Proverbs. Anybody play the game where your birth day is your chapter? Anybody? Anybody done that? Well, 16 is really rough. Okay. All right. I don't follow I don't subscribe to that. If I could find a metric that works for me, I'll espouse it. But chapter 16 is pretty hard. All the ways of man are clean in his own eyes, but the Lord weighth the spirits. What does it mean? Clean outwardly. &gt;&gt; In other words, NO MATTER HOW I arrive at the decision or the the the appearance or the conclusion, my motive, you know, it's all good. It's all clean. All the ways of man are clean, pure outwardly in his own eyes. So man has made his own beauty and his own purity and his own unmixingness clean subjectively. If it's clean in my eyes, it's that's what matters. But it says God judges motives, judges objectives. He judges the the support, &gt;&gt; the canvas. What is it on? What's your basis? The Lord weighth the spirits. the subjective truth where a person's individual perception or opinion uh uh uh is well this is how I've arrived at it this is this is what I believe this is how I feel but there is a question if the Lord's way in the spirits how was it informed &gt;&gt; you can say well THIS IS HOW I FEEL THIS IS HOW I SEE IT THIS IS MY CONVICTION THIS IS MY DECISION BUT GOD IS NOT ONLY CONCERNED ABOUT WHERE YOU ARRIVE HE'S WEIGHING HOW YOU GOT THERE &gt;&gt; YEAH THAT'S RIGHT &gt;&gt; WHAT WHAT INFLUENCED THIS? WHAT INFORMED your decisions? Oh, I think that's beautiful. Why do you THINK THAT'S BEAUTIFUL? &gt;&gt; I THINK THAT'S THE TRUTH. WHY DO YOU THINK THAT'S TRUTH? I THINK THAT'S A LIE. I DON'T THINK THAT'S TRUE. I THINK THAT'S WRONG. WHY? &gt;&gt; The Lord weighth the spirits. For Proverbs chapter 19 verse 21, these are the things that the Lord weighs. There are many devices in a man's hearts. In a man's heart. This is what God is weighing. His devices. You keep trying to make these cell phones lighter and lighter. God still knows the await the weight of it. There's many devices in man's heart, many judgments. That's what it means. A device is a value judgment, a way to judge. Nevertheless, the council Lord that shall stand. So subjective beauty is a matter of opinion. &gt;&gt; Objective beauty is a matter of truth, an absolute. And the Bible says there's many value judgments in your heart where you arrive at your conclusion or your opinion, but the counsel of the Lord that shall stand. In other words, his purpose, his advice, his opinion is actually the one that's true. &gt;&gt; So if you if you halt between two opinions, take God's. If you're wanting to get neutral, God has a will. I have a will. I'm just going to get neutral to it. Are you crazy? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; No. I don't want to be neutral. I'm sold out to his will. &gt;&gt; There's nothing in his will I'm afraid of. There's nothing outside of his will that I want. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That's how THAT'S HOW I SELL MYSELF OUT. I want his will. Now, there's times when I don't know what his will is. Could it be the left? Could it be the right? And I want to know. And therefore, I pray and I realize that God is kind to me. I was even thinking of it today. It it wasn't the Forest Frank song, but I was listening to another song this morning and and it one of the lines said, "I'VE GOT YOUR BACK." God responding to a believer's conundrum and what he's going through. I'VE GOT YOUR BACK. IN OTHER WORDS, PRAY. Be sincere. IF YOU MAKE THE WRONG DECISION, GOD'S GOT YOUR BACK. &gt;&gt; He literally is GOING TO SAY, "DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. LET'S GET OUT OF THIS TOGETHER. THIS IS THE RIGHT WAY." &gt;&gt; SO THEREFORE, I'M NOT AFRAID OF SELLING OUT TO HIS WILL. But the one THING THAT'LL KEEP ME FROM IT IS MY OPINION AND MY judgments and my subjective uh uh values. &gt;&gt; So this is God's man's opinion versus God's opinion. And I want to take God's Benjamin Franklin and his uh I forgot what his uh pseudonym what he was writing his pin name was and his publication now but he wrote a little diddy back there in the 1700s. Beauty like supreme dominion is but supported by opinion. &gt;&gt; Therefore, there's a supreme dominion that's supported by opinion. Says it's just like beauty that it's only opinion. As they say, opinions are like noses. Mine are bigger than yours. So if there's a uh if things are if beauty is a matter of opinion &gt;&gt; THEN CONSIDER THE POWER that social media has over us. &gt;&gt; CONSIDER THE POWER and the influence that society has to influence our definition, our perception and our opinion of beauty &gt;&gt; in what we embrace as beautiful. there. This is the danger of the rhetoric when it comes to politics is the more often a lie is repeated, the more likely you are to believe it's true. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And so when we hear it repeated over and over AGAIN THAT CERTAIN LIFESTYLES OR CERTAIN uh things that are evil or beautiful that are we should have pride in that we should accept and we think are great then that presents an image of beauty that we then BEGIN TO SAY WELL THAT IS BEAUTIFUL. Uniqueness is what MAKES US BEAUTIFUL. VARIEDNESS IS WHAT MAKES US BEAUTIFUL. AND WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY LOOKING AT IS A PALE horse &gt;&gt; with NO CLEAR IDENTITY WHATSOEVER. AND IT'S THE ANTICHRIST SWEEPING THROUGH POLITICS and religion and society. And because and THEN AS THAT VOICE BEGINS TO SHAPE PERCEPTION OF WHAT IS BEAUTIFUL, THEN THERE'S ANOTHER VOICE ON THE OTHER SIDE SAYING BURN THEM ALL AND WE HATE THEM AND PROTEST AND ABUSE AND DEFILE AND IT MAKES VIOLENCE HEROIC. AND BOTH OF THEM ARE THE WRONG IMAGE of beauty. A lot of these things that we read online, whether it be on on X or if it be on any of these social media platforms, you're reading people's unfiltered opinion. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And you just you read it and you say, "Oh, well, I guess so and so is a piece of garbage. &gt;&gt; Oh, this. Oh, that." And and what you do is it immediately influences perception. Because if you were if you were a blank slate and you were just an empty canvas and somebody offers an opinion on Proposition 50, oh my goodness gracious. Yep. That's how I feel about it. You know, nothing else but what the person said. Amen. &gt;&gt; And there's all sorts of op-eds, opinion editorials, or even opinion pieces that are not just for the purpose of expressing opinion, &gt;&gt; but for the purpose of shaping opinion. For influencing opinion, as a means of swaying people to hold to that opinion or further strengthening those who already have it. This world's full of opinions, perceptions of beauty, subjective definitions of what is beautiful. And the world would look at Christ in his nakedness and recoil from it and say that's not beautiful. &gt;&gt; And if WE RECEIVE THE LIE, if we receive the influence, if we're not careful, then that begins to shape our perception of what is beautiful. And then we too have arrived at this subjective opinion of what is beautiful AND WHAT IS ATTRACTIVE IN CONTRADICTION TO what is objectively true. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; In Isaiah 53:es 1:3, if this seems to be somewhat abstract, there is very concrete practical application of these things. &gt;&gt; ISAIAH 53:ES 1-3. WHO HATH BELIEVED OUR REPORT? AND TO whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? &gt;&gt; For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root of the of of out of a dry ground. For he hath no form nor clumliness. This is saying he doesn't have any attractiveness, no form, proportion, symmetry. &gt;&gt; And when we shall see him, in whom is the light, &gt;&gt; in whom is the way, the truth, the life, in whom is the word of life made flesh, there is no beauty that we should desire him. Notice just how this prophecy is expressive not of the true nature of Christ but man's perception of him. He is despised and rejected of men. So this is this humanity, fallen man, the carnal nature, the carnal mind sees no desirable beauty in Christ. He's despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief. And we hid, as it were, our faces from him. He was despised and we esteemed him not. Art not worth an estimation. &gt;&gt; That an at an auction it wouldn't sell. How much are you going to pay me to take it off your hands? &gt;&gt; If it was put on offer up, no one would want it. If it WAS ON FACEBOOK MARKETPLACE, SOMEBODY WOULD CHARGE YOU JUST FOR reading the listing. &gt;&gt; There's no beauty THAT WE WOULD WANT IT. &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO ATTRACTIVENESS THAT WE WOULD DESIRE TO PARTAKE IN IT, to be one with it, to be identified with it. This is man's base instincts in nature. THIS IS HIS INSTINCTIVE VALUE PROPOSITION that there is no beauty in Christ. &gt;&gt; David Hume writing at the similar time of Benjamin Franklin said, "Beauty is no quality in things themselves. It exists merely in the mind which contemplates them and each mind perceives a different beauty." Now, is that true? We may say, well, that's true when it comes to an individual's perception. They say perception is reality. That's a reality in certain context. And so he's saying, WELL, BEAUTY IS JUST HAS THERE'S no inherent beauty. It's just whether or not A PERSON THINKS ABOUT it and values it. BUT THEN LET'S APPLY that principle to Isaiah 53. There is no inherent beauty. There is nothing that is inherently pure. IT'S BASED UPON A PERSON'S CONTEMPLATION AND SUBSEQUENT PERCEPTION OR VALUE JUDGMENT of whether or not it's pure and beautiful. &gt;&gt; And let's apply it to Christ. And could we say that if you look AT CHRIST AND YOU JUDGE him sinful, is it true? If you look at the word AND SAY THAT IT'S WRONG, is that in fact make it true? Does that mean there's no inherent quality of truth in the word? &gt;&gt; Come on. The Bible said there was no beauty in him that we should desire him and we did not esteem him as valuable. But in Psalms 27:4 and we say Franklin and Hume and Confucious and these different ones say, "Well, beauty is in the eye of the beholder." Then what are you beholding? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And when you behold him, what do you see? David said, "One thing have I desired of the Lord." Dear friend, Brother Steven Bryant just been God's been using his gift to write many songs as of late. And one of the songs he was writing is All My Days. and and and I just WANT TO SEEK AFTER you always. One thing have I DESIRED OF THE LORD. ONE THING AND if that one thing I will pursue that will I seek after. Later on in this chapter he says when you said seek my face it's your face I will seek. So he says one thing HAVE I DESIRED. IT'S THAT WHICH WILL MODERATE ALL DECISIONS. IT'S THAT WHICH WILL BECOME THE BOUNDARIES TO ALL VISIONS. IT IS THAT WHICH WILL BE MY GUIDE. ONE THING HAVE I DESIRE. THAT ONE THING WILL I SEEK AFTER THAT I MAY DWELL IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD ALL THE DAYS OF MY LIFE. AND THEN NOTICE WHERE HE TAKES IT TO BEHOLD THE BEAUTY OF HIS L OF the Lord. &gt;&gt; And to inquire in his temple. &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, THERE IS AN INHERENT beauty in Christ. There is SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL ABOUT GOD THAT DAVID IS SAYING, I WANT TO SEE. DO YOU REALIZE THAT WE CAN CRAFT JUST BY THE BIBLE, WHICH WE BELIEVE THE INSPIRED word of God, and we could just take certain instances and and seemingly objectively PROVE THAT GOD is is homo like a maniac and he's mean and HE'S A NARCISSIST. KILL THEM ALL, WOMEN AND BABIES INCLUDED. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? If that was pulp pot, we'd say, you know, kill him. &gt;&gt; But it's God telling the Israelites and what is it? It's a way that you see God and you see him as harsh, unforgiving, brutal, bloodthirsty. &gt;&gt; And and that's what people may see in David, a man of war. &gt;&gt; A man who shed blood and adulterer, &gt;&gt; but David knew there was a true beauty in God. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; That you just didn't you didn't just see the works, you knew the ways. Amen. &gt;&gt; As God made his ways known unto Moses and his works unto the children of Israel, the children of Israel saw the results, but Moses knew his heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He knew the motive and objective. He knew the evil behind the things that were being slain and removed. He knew the purpose OF GOD AND THE OBJECTIVE he's trying to to uh to present. He knew what God was ultimately trying to portray. And David says, "There is a beauty of the Lord." And if I could say this, just enter it into this last section of this sermon this morning. There is a beauty of Christ that we will only see when we behold his face. &gt;&gt; Just as Balum was shown the backside of Israel. &gt;&gt; Just as there's a a way that you could show something in a certain light. What do you say? Unfavorable light. It's that time of year, brothers. Family pictures. Just give me a moment. And what is most important when it comes to family pictures? Light and post-processing filters. &gt;&gt; Don't look at my search history. It's all about adding hair. I was told today that my beard is thin and wiry. and and uh now I got to get my beard trimmed for family pictures. But light is so important because something could be in the wrong light. You can have the best smiles, the best of clothes, carefully curated over months. And if you don't get your pictures at 4:26 p.m. with just the right exposure, the pictures are worthless. And so there is a certain beauty of Christ that can only be seen in his face. &gt;&gt; And that becomes better the more clear he becomes. &gt;&gt; And this is what we see in Matthew chapter 17. This may cause some people to relax a little bit because he's finally at his text. Hopefully this means the end, but it could mean the beginning. &gt;&gt; In Matthew chapter 17 says, "And after six days, Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John, and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart." This is where we're going to see the son of man coming in his kingdom, as it says in Mark, coming in his glory, his beauty. &gt;&gt; This is not the coming that many people are looking to WHEN HE COMES BACK TO EARTH WITH HIS BRIDE TO RULE AND REIGN in millennium. It's not maybe a denominational coming that's got him as a 900 foot Jesus in the cloud. But this is a coming in glory where he reveals himself &gt;&gt; and was transfigured BEFORE THEM. AND HIS FACE DID SHINE AS THE SUN and his raignment was white as the light. HIS FACE DID SHINE AS THE SUN. WE MIGHT JUST SUPERIMPOSE AN IMAGE OF A burning hot molten lava SUN. BUT IT'S NOT SOMETHING TO WHERE IT WAS NO LONGER HUMAN. But it means there was this brilliance or radiance about him, &gt;&gt; A TRANSCENDENT SPLENDOR, THIS UNRIVALED, UNPARALLELED GLORY, UNCONCEALED. He retained the fleshly image. He retained the image of a man. BUT THE BIBLE'S USING WHAT MIGHT SEEM TO BE HYPERBOLE. IT'S BEING DESCRIBED SO THAT YOU COULD SEE THERE'S THIS UNRIVALED BEAUTY that's emanating from him. Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; THAT THIS ONE THAT'S DESCRIBED IN ISAIAH 53, THERE'S NO BEAUTY. WE SHOULD DESIRE HIM. DESPISED AND REJECTED A MAN OF SORROWS ACQUAINTED TO GRIEF. WE HID OUR FACES from him as it were. WE ESTEEMED HIM NOT. THIS manifestation you couldn't take your eyes off of. &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; THIS brilliance was captivating. &gt;&gt; Something you'd be drawn to. I can't take my eyes off this. It was a revealing that was so arresting that the disciples should have just been in this stunned absolute silence. This beauty, breathtaking brilliance, a brilliant beauty. Verse three, and behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elijah talking with him. Now, I want to suggest this. It's only a suggestion that his face shining as the sun and his arignment white as light. If we could somehow imagine that these words are being used to express the most brilliant beauty you've ever seen and then all of a sudden Moses and Elijah nestle up next to it. You might go, but then your eyes are coming right back to Christ. Reminds me of the time that I had a a friendship for a while with Julio Franco and a professional baseball player who's always my favorite player when I was a little kid, young teenager, and God just by way of my testimony allowed me to become friends with him. I had lunch with him one day and we had gone to lunch and he wanted to go to a bookstore to buy a gospel album that just come out and we walk into the bookstore together and he was in town playing and we walk in and there's this like 18 nyear-old kid sitting there and he sees Jula Franco goes Julio Franco and he looks over at me and he goes Julio Franco right? In other words, YOU JUST HAVE SOME GUY LIKE ME, RIGHT? I'M NOT 67. I'M 5'8 ON MY BEST DAY. AND SO HERE HE'S GOING, "OH MY GOODNESS, JULIO FRANCO, spare Julio Franco. AND HERE'S THE MOST BRILLIANT CHRIST YOU'VE EVER SEEN." And Moses and Elijah saddle up next to him. AND PETER SAYS UNTO JESUS, "LORD, IT IS GOOD FOR US TO BE HERE. If thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles, one for thee, one for Moses, and one for Elias. To me, there is something that's now arresting about Peter's response. You have Moses the law. You have Elijah the prophets. But there stands the Messiah of which Moses and the prophets the law and the prophets testified of. &gt;&gt; And yes, this is a striking image of vindication. This is a striking image of even the resurrection wherein you have the living saints represented IN ELIJAH AND THE SLEEPING saints represented in Moses are going to be gathered together TO A GLORIFIED CHRIST. YES, THERE'S A LOT THAT'S BEING EXPRESSED HERE. BUT IN THIS VERY MOMENT, PETER'S INSPIRED BY WHAT HE SAW. AND HE WANTS TO BUILD three equal tabernacles, &gt;&gt; habitations, &gt;&gt; altars. If I can say this, trying just trying to make a point here. It's as if Peter was only seeing it skin deep. Here's that carnal value judgment and this knee-jerk reaction to fanaticism. This is that he looks AT IT AND HE'S NOT REALLY GETTING THE PICTURE HERE. MOSES AND ELIJAH ARE NOT THERE TO REPRESENT THE TRINITY. THEY'RE NOT THERE TO REPRESENT H THIS DIVIDING OF GOD INTO THESE OTHER ENTITIES, BUT THEY'RE THERE AS TESTIMONIES OF THE LAW AND THE PROPHETS THAT THIS IS THE MESSIAH. &gt;&gt; THAT THIS IS WHAT WE FORESHADOWED. THIS IS WHAT WE POINTED TO. AND SO WHEN PETER SPEAKS THIS, GOD'S IMMEDIATE RESPONSE WAS WHILE HE HAD SPAKE, BEHOLD, IF I CAN SAY THIS, Peter's opinion was these are all on equal footing. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them. This is a symbol of God's presence. Brother Anthony, this is why I really enjoyed your special this morning. Sister Valerie, you're saying on his presence because this is what the light of the countenance means. This is what the face of the Lord means. This is what the tabernacle means. It means his presence. It's a symbol of God's presence. It's a token of his love, his grace, and his favor. &gt;&gt; A bright cloud overshadows. And behold, A VOICE OUT OF THE cloud and said, "This is my beloved son in whom I'm well pleased. Hear ye him." &gt;&gt; In other words, you may there may be Moses and Elijah, but he's given God's given his opinion now. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; and he's not disregarding Moses and he's not disregarding Elijah and he's not doing away with the law and doing away with the prophets, but he's saying in Christ they're made perfect. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If you want to accept the law, accept them in Christ. If you want to accept the prophets, accept them in Christ. When the disciples heard it, they fell on their face and were so afraid. And Jesus came and touched them and said, "Arise and be not afraid." And notice what happens. And when they lifted up their eyes, they saw no man save Jesus only. &gt;&gt; In other words, there's something it expresses to us this how clear the gospel is, &gt;&gt; how clear it is when it's revealed to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's Jesus Christ. The word only. nothing else expresses this brightness of the gospel wherein there's oh well there's let us build three tabernacles it's to each his own however you want to serve God whatever you think like this inward beauty where it's like in everyone is an inward deity theqi we all have it right that's and we all have we could just and if we could just center ourselves on the inward divine Right? And we could all get centered. Then we can all begin to communicate one to another as this harmonious whole, one with nature, one with man. And like, okay, if that works for you, that's good. I'm going to go over here to Catholic mass. But we love you're you're just we're all part of the same thing. We all love one another, right? And there's this idea. It's like, well, okay, but the Bible says there's only one only one way to be saved. It's through Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible teaches that if you believe there's a multiplicity of ways it could happen, but then you don't believe the Bible. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; But now he's shining in the brightness of his glory, a bright cloud overshadows him and witnesses. It's in contrast to Exodus chapter 19 where God came in a thick cloud. It was dark IN THIS THICK CLOUD, &gt;&gt; BUT NOW IT'S A BRIGHT CLOUD. UNDER THE LAW, WHICH JUST TESTIFIED OF CHRIST, HE SPEAKS IN A DARK CLOUD. AND IT'S BECAUSE THIS FIRE THAT COMES UPON THE MOUNTAIN, BUT NOW IT'S A BRIGHT CLOUD THAT OVERSHADOWS THEM. AND A VOICE FROM THE CLOUD SAYING, "THIS IS MY SON IN WHOM I DWELL IN WHOM I'M REVEALED, THE ONE THAT WILL MAKE KNOWN TO YOU THE FATHER. IT'S THROUGH CHRIST THAT YOU COME TO KNOW ME, THE WAY, THE TRUTH, THE LIFE." AMEN. &gt;&gt; In Psalms 50:es 1 and 2, the mighty God, even the Lord, hath spoken and called the earth from the rising of the sun into the going down thereof. OUT OF ZION, NOTICE IT SAYS, "THE PERFECTION OF BEAUTY, GOD HATH SHINED." &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; Here even IN ZION AT MOUNT TRANSFIGURATION, THE PERFECTION OF BEAUTY, GOD hath shined. &gt;&gt; The perfection completeness. It's the sum of all beauty. &gt;&gt; It is an objective beauty. It is completely beautiful in and out. YOU SAY IF IT'S BEAUTIFUL OUTWARDLY, THE WORD IS BEAUTIFUL OUTWARDLY. YOU SAY IT'S BEAUTIFUL INWARDLY, THE word is beautiful inwardly. IT IS BOTH THE SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE BEAUTY THAT CANNOT BE RIVALED. &gt;&gt; That you would reject to your own detriment and condemnation. Out of Zion, God shined. This is what's happening in Matthew chapter 17. God radiating, shining, and speaking. It is the brilliance of Christ. And if I could use this, there's several scriptures. I could probably do it in quick order. A person's face is it's enlightening. The Bible uses the phrase the light of my countenance, the brilliance of one's face. It's to to to even use one's face as a symbol of their identity. That's why when we we have passports or driver's license, it it doesn't show your nice kicks, right? Could you just imagine if we were all identified by our shoes? You go, you stand there, you're at the airport, you hand them your passport, and they look at the passport and look down at your shoes and you're like, "You're not wearing WHAT ARE THOSE?" RIGHT? OH, I FORGOT TO WEAR MY IDENTITY. NO, THEY LOOK AT YOUR FACE. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; It reveals your identity. When you see someone's face, it's their presence. &gt;&gt; And do you realize just how much then something can be misinterpreted? How much something could be misunderstood when you don't see their face? &gt;&gt; When when they try to do some uh dog and pony show or some smoke and mirrors AND THEY SAY, "SEE THAT? IT'S CHRIST. SEE, LOOK, it's Jesus." You'll know when you see his face. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's what declares one's presence. The face is also indicative of character. I had a brother, a dear friend of mine that told a story one time. There was always a sister. It was in Pentecostal church and she would always say at the END OF EVERY SERVICE, I SEE JESUS. I SEE JESUS. And one day in the afternoon, they had a kids event. Everybody had balloons and everything. And later on in that service day, the service is winding down and one of the kids had let go of a balloon and it began to work its way to the very top of the outside of the church where there were these windows at the very top. And she started saying, "I SEE JESUS. I SEE I REALLY DO [screaming] SEE HIM." And it was just a balloon. But when you see his face, it's his identity. It's his character. It's his presence. In Job 29:4, "If I laughed on them, they believed it not." Job's response to his persecutors, he says, "In the light of my countenance, they cast not down." What does he mean by the light of his countenance? His smile, his disposition, his attitude, his conviction, his belief. Confidence is revealed by one's face. What is it many times at law enforcement or border patrol? What are they looking for when they begin to ask you what seems to be these really innocuous questions like, "Hey, did you enjoy your time in Mexico?" And you're they're going, "Yes, [snorts] you had a great time." You know who'd you go see? Bob &gt;&gt; Aia. Hey, they're just they're looking at your facial expressions. They're measuring your body response. So what about the light of your countenance? &gt;&gt; Now, now this works two ways. One, do you see Christ in his beauty? But now what's seen on you? &gt;&gt; When people see Christ, does he look like this? &gt;&gt; Is that what they say? Christ just must be angry. &gt;&gt; Psalms 43:3, "For they got not the land in possession by their own sword." Think of how incredible this is. Neither did their own arm save them, but thy right hand and thine arm and the light of thy countenance. SO NOW IT'S JUST NOT MERELY A NICE SMILE, BUT THERE'S POWER IN HIS PRESENCE. &gt;&gt; THERE'S POWER IN HIS CHARACTER BY THE LIGHT OF HIS COUNTENANCE BECAUSE THOU HAS A FAVOR UNTO THEM. THERE'S POWER IN THE LIGHT OF GOD'S COUNTENANCE IN PSALMS 89:15. BLESSED IS THE people that know the joyful sound. THEY SHALL WALK, OH LORD, IN THE LIGHT OF THY COUNTENANCE. IN THE LIGHT OF HIS COUNTENANCE, THERE'S BLESSING. Proverbs chapter 16. Yes, that's my Proverbs verse 15. IN LIGHT OF THE KING'S COUNTENANCE, HIS LIFE AND HIS FAVOR IS AS A CLOUD OF A latter rain. This is what we see in Matthew chapter 17. This is what we see when he reveals himself in the this beautiful end TIME PROPHECY. IN THE LIGHT OF THE KING'S COUNTENANCE, his life. &gt;&gt; SOME MAY SEE JUDGMENT. SOME MAY SEE DEATH. BUT IN HIS EYES ARE FAVOR. AND HIS FAVORS AS THE CLOUD OF THE LATTER RAIN. WHAT DOES HE DECLARE? THE CAPSTONE OF GRACE. Grace &gt;&gt; when we look into his word, this word which has become a new book, he says, "You're looking at me face to face." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; We we're looking at that Christ who's looking to us to pardon us, not to judge us. In numbers 6:es 22- 26 this ironic blessing not ironic but ironic blessing and the Lord spake unto Moses saying speak unto Aaron and his son saying on this wise ye shall bless the children of Israel saying unto them the Lord bless thee and keep thee. The Lord make his face shine upon thee and be gracious unto thee. The Lord lift up his countenance upon thee and give thee peace. Notice how these dispositions of grace and peace come by his face, his presence from this light of his countenance, which is the brightness of his beauty. His face did shine as the sun, it's in his brilliant beauty, his unmistakable beauty. If to the children of Israel, it's by the light of his countenance that they were able to possess the land. It's by the light of his countenance that they were blessed people. It's by the light of the countenance that there's life and favor, grace, and peace. It says in 2 Corinthians 3:18, and we'll pick up on this next week or maybe Wednesday, but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord. &gt;&gt; But we all with clarity beholding as in a mirror the beauty of the Lord, &gt;&gt; are changed into the same image from glory to glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. Even as by the spirit of the lord &gt;&gt; the beauty of the lord is revolutionizing the beauty of the lord is changing that when we see him partially we see him cryptically when we see him it through a dark glass when we don't see him clearly we can't be changed &gt;&gt; but as we see him more clearly the more we're changed in OTHER WORDS THE BEAUTY OF THE LORD IS LIFECH CHANGING &gt;&gt; THE MORE THAT WE SEE HIS BEAUTY the more that we are changed 90 vers8 thou has set our iniquities before thee our secret sins in the light of thy countenance. I know this may seem to be an odd all of a sudden, how did we end up here? But I raise it to make this point. It's impossible to not be changed by his presence. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Impossible. Because when we stand before him, all things are made clear. &gt;&gt; That's right. your calling, your predestination, your election, his grace for you, his love, his forgiveness. All these things are laid there to receive and to accept. But then also our sins and our iniquities to disavow. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And therefore, our response will determine whether we are changed for better or for worse. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; In the beauty of the Lord and the revealing of his character, we see what we ought to be. &gt;&gt; With the spirit of the Lord, there is liberty. It's the verse that precedes this in 2 Corinthians CHAPTER 3. LIBERTY TO WHAT? BE WHATEVER we want. That's what people have interpreted it to mean. WHERE THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD, THERE'S LIBERTY. You do you. You do you. You do you. You do you. Scream, shout, dance, kick somebody over, yell, falsely prophesy, DO WHATEVER YOU WANT. To each his own. Where the spirit of the Lord is, there's liberty to do whatever you want. No, it means liberty to become like Christ. &gt;&gt; Liberty to become the word. &gt;&gt; And when we look into the word of God, we see what we ought to be. Yes. &gt;&gt; When the word has an ought, we see what we ought to be. And therefore, it also reproves what we are &gt;&gt; and what we cannot be. &gt;&gt; And we'll either say yes to the word and trust that it's God in him both to will and to do &gt;&gt; of his good pleasure. &gt;&gt; Musicians, if you come, I'd like to read one final scripture in Psalms verse 4 to two. Excuse me. Psalms chapter 4:es 2-6. I read this because it's challenging. Oh ye sons of men, how long will you turn my glory into shame? The prayer is that the beauty of the Lord would be seen on us. The prophecy is that his glory will be seen on thee at the rising of the sun. How long will you love vanity and seek after leasing? Say love. But know that the Lord hath set apart him that is godly for himself. The Lord will hear when I call unto him. Stand in awe and sin not. Commune with your own heart upon your bed and be still say law. Offer the sacrifices of righteousness and put your trust in the Lord. There be many that say who will show us any good? What is beautiful? What is pure? What is truth? So the prayer is Lord lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us. How is it that we can turn this shame into glory? Through his face. By seeking his will, seeking the Lord. And if I could say this as we close, seeking God's face is not an act of physical worship. Right? that this is how kind of what we've distilled it down to that seeking the Lord's face is what we do when the music is right and our hands are lifted and we're seeking him through this uh act of worship. But to seek his face is the pursuit of perfect beauty. To seek his face is to seek a life-changing experience. To seek his face is to allow the light of his beauty, this brilliant beauty to shine upon us that there our shame might be turned into glory. That we would no longer love vanity or seek after leasing. That we could be set apart distinct and different. It's an act of seeking God to find his presence, that brilliant beauty, to know his will and then yield to it. Not just to be in his presence and not be changed. Not to just be in his presence and feel raptured up for a moment, but to seek his face and through the revealing of his face, we know what his will is. And in that moment, we have a decision to yield to it. And when we truly see this, when you can see that this Christ, then we can say it's it really is the word only. It really is Jesus Christ only. And if we can come to that place where we're seeking his face for the purpose of knowing his will and yielding [music] to it and then the light of our countenance be not cast down, then we begin to reveal the nature, character, identity, and presence of Christ. Then others will see the brilliant beauty of Christ in you. Now, they may see what we know to be objectively a brilliant beauty and they may call it something else, but it's worth the risk. DO YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE somebody's going to see it and say, "I don't know what it is, but there's something about this." And it's going to be a draw. It's going to be the salt of the earth. It's going to be the light. So let your light shine. Don't be afraid to immanate the beauty of God. Don't try to change it to fit the taste of Leodysia. Because you know what? As soon as you try to fit their v vision of beauty, they're going to say, "You're oldfashioned anyways." &gt;&gt; That is so yesterday. Nobody does that anymore. They're going like, "Oh, look at them trying to pull off that look. Look at them. They're just trying." You're never going to be able to pull off an authentic worldliness. &gt;&gt; That's right. It's only when you're in the world that you're being a hypocrite because you are called to be a luminary, a lightbearer of Christ's word. AND THAT'S WHY YOU CAN'T FIT INTO THESE WORLDLY SOCIAL SYSTEMS. YOU'LL ONLY FIND YOUR PLACE IN YOUR AUTHENTIC SELF IN BEING A CHRISTIAN. AND THEREFORE, JUST BE THE CHRIST THAT YOU'RE CALLED TO BE. AND DON'T WORRY ABOUT WHAT THE CRITICS HAVE TO SAY. SOMEONE WILL SEE YOUR LIGHT AND SAY, "WHAT IS IT THAT LIT YOU, &gt;&gt; BRO? Why are you so lit? Hey, THERE'S GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT SAYS NOW THERE'S SOMETHING TO THIS AND THEY WON'T REAL may they may not realize it yet but they've seen the brilliant beauty of Christ and then Christ begins to be imprinted in their lives and they come to know him in that personal way which is necessary. God help us to not only see the brilliant beauty of Christ but to be &gt;&gt; the brilliant beauty of Christ. Let's stand. Let's pray together. Our gracious heavenly father, Lord, there is so much more that could be said on this subject, but today as we leave it here through this [music] very lengthy service, I pray that there would be a theme that just unfolds from the scripture of seeking your face to know you. Not just in an act of physical worship, but in the sacrifice of righteousness, in the pursuit of perfect beauty. that Lord, I'm acknowledging my sins and my failures in your presence. For it is the light in the light of your countenance that I see my mistakes and my weaknesses. But Lord, you would not reveal a weakness unless your strength could be made strong. &gt;&gt; Lord, you would not reveal sins or expose them. And they would not be come up before you in the light of your countenance if you were not willing to cast those sins behind your back. So therefore, Lord, we plead the blood. As we stand before you in your presence, scriptures become more clear that as in the light of your countenance did my sins come, but then you cast them behind your back. No longer accusing, no longer standing in the way. And Lord, with my sins being confessed and being repented of, Lord, I pray that I could see you in a more clear way, with more beauty, that in doing [music] so, I could be a light to my children. Lord, I don't want to make the message, smutty. I don't want to make it unclean or impure. I don't want to twist it and pervert it and make it into something that's worldly. It's watered down, that's powerless. And Lord, I don't want to make it unnecessarily unattractive. Because truly to the carnal mind, it's not beautiful. It's demanding. The word is demanding. It just doesn't merely ask for our hearts, but then it even gives the evidence of [music] a changed life as a litmus test. Paul in the New Testament teaching how that we ought to behave as husbands and wives, how we &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; ought to behave and children in manner of giving, in manner of living, in a manner of dress and appearance and conversation. And Lord, the world calls it ugliness, but is a sacred symmetry of your word that you find beautiful. And whereas there's many devices in our hearts that come to opinions about beauty and in our eyes subjectively there may be a beauty we want to take the counsel of the Lord. Your opinion of what is beautiful, Lord, we'll take no matter what it may make us look like outwardly. I want your beauty to be seen on me. Lord, I pray today that you could work a miracle in our lives by changing our taste for certain things that we have found beautiful. That Lord, you would take away these idols that we have lifted up, that we have admired and esteemed as powerful, as heroic, as beautiful, and let us see the beauty of Christ. and no longer make vulgar heroic. No longer make selfishness desirable. No longer make violence beautiful, but Lord, we can make Christ the word desirable to our eyes. And when examined by that brilliant beauty, Lord, may we be changed by it to be reflectors of it. Luminaries, lightbearsers, bless your people, I pray. In the name of Lord Jesus Christ, we ask this. Amen.
