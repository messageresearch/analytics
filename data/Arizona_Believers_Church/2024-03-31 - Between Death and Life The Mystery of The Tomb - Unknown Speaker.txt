TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I am preaching an Easter Sermon this morning and by taking this text it may not seem very easterly or Resurrection or however you'd want to say that but I do want to come back to this uh maybe here at the beginning just to make a quick point and then hopefully return to it at the end and I will say that I'm laying a lot out there today that I hope to even maybe come back to on Wednesday night and so just as we explore this it's not just to say something about uh Resurrection Sunday or Easter Sunday for the purpose of honoring um the time or the holiday or satisfying those who came hoping to hear an Easter Sermon but we have just something in our hearts that we can just uh look at together and gain so much from my title is between death and life I know we had the phrase between life and death and maybe we always order it in a certain way where we see life and death but I I want to say it this way que death and life and kind of a subtitle The Mystery of the Tomb and I'm just going to visit the story of the Resurrection today going to take some time reading through the scriptures going through great detail I think it's good for us sometimes just to read the Bible together and look at the scriptures and maybe look at them collectively there are so many different instances in the gospels that refer to the events of the crucifixion and resurrection and the surrounding happenings and if you just read one uh I think you can take away the story you can get the gist of it but as you read all of them together and you start looking at them uh you realize there's certain things that are repeated there's certain themes that seem to have some emphasis and sometimes just a little bit different angle that can catch you to help you understand things in a broader way and if for all of you I know you all remember exactly what I preached a year ago on Easter on I think it was uh between hell and heaven and it was the mystery of Christ's Ascension and we looked at a lot of scriptures surrounding the events and uh I think I might just start a thing where every Easter I have mystery in my title there or between we have to use between and mystery and uh but I'm looking at some of the very same things but just a different aspect whereas before we kind of looked at after he had resurrected uh be from that uh time where he went to hell and before he went into heaven that moment in that time when he began to he saw Mary a and they had this interchange and he realized something's happen happening and something's taking place and as we looked into that we saw so many beautiful examples of the high priest and the sacrifice entering into heaven to be presented for God to accept it so there's just so much that we can draw from the scriptures and I will say it's going to be very simple but focus with me I don't want the Simplicity to lose you a little bit and um and for those who need complexity I'll weave some of that in there for those who look for it now if you'll uh I just I want to read a statement in the beginning uh from the sermon turn on the light I'm drawing a lot from these principles that he preaches brother BR preaches in this but I want to walk as I before I walk through these scriptures and we read a number of different places today and we pick up truths things that are factual things that are historical things that are real and very true about the crucifixion and the resurrection I want to do it to identify a promise for us not just to uh be able to pass a quiz if we had a quiz afterwards and say what day was he crucified and what hour did this happen and what happen next and get the chronology right but to see a promise for us and the promises are in the details that that God expresses something to us we know that the Bible is written by the Breath of God the scriptures are given by inspiration and so these things are written for our learning and things were written to teach us things and so I believe that if we can see Jesus Christ in every verse then there's things uh that are instructional to us in the in the details about the resurrection and brother brandom says it this way this is how I want to reinforce that with this God never speaks a word unless he's got a reason for speaking that word and as we believe the Bible is the written word of God I want to attach that same principle to it God would not have preserved this word and washed out over it if he did not have a reason for doing so said he's not like you and I that we just and then he says or especially myself and if he would say especially of himself i' I say especially especially of our ourselves that speak so many foolish things God so God's not like that God speaks every word with the meaning I think that has so much weight God speaks every word with the meaning and something that he's trying to achieve and will achieve by his word we can speak so many foolish things and sometimes we can be very sincere about the things we want to do but we're just trying to do it not necessarily will we do it but he's got something he wants to achieve and he will do so he says and it will perform exactly what he said it will do we know that in Christ God gives us all things and and therefore as we look at these scriptures we're wanting to see that God is speaking something for a reason and that there's this pattern that what God speaks if he ever gives a promise it's going to come to pass it will not fail and that he has something he's going to try to achieve and as he as Christ was part of that and part of the prophecy I want us to discover something about ourselves because in Christ we are given all things and it says in First Peter chapter 2 verse 21 this is going to be kind of an important part uh just to Anchor in because I'm as we read the things about Christ I I want you to be able to think well what does this mean to me what does this mean to me for me and you perhaps should always be asking yourself that question whenever you come to church what does this mean for me but he says for even here unto we were ye called so we are called to this he says because Christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that you should follow in his steps now he's being very precise about we're going to be called to trials and testings and sufferings and we're going to have to stand and make our stand and we're going to have to endure uh because we've been called to that but he says as Christ was called to suffer and he suffered for us he left us an example that we should follow in his steps and thank God those steps just aren't limited to suffering that those steps are are also include the glory that came by the suffering and all the promises that were in him we are partakers in and Joint hirs in so in Christ his life and his the way that he lived and was born and lived and grew there's so much that we draw from his example specifically and precisely in many cases literally for us and so when we look at Christ today it's not just merely looking at it historically but maybe you could look at it if we could say in a mirror or some some foreshadowing or look to it to identify a promise for ourselves especially if we're talking about a resurrection we're talking about Redemption there's things that we could look at for ourselves so the the subject is between the death of Christ and his life after death between death and life so we're looking at between the death of Christ and his life after death and we could say this way in between that was a resurrection that's that's what is there in in between death and life now I wrestled at at what point to put this and if it seems to be a little bit out of place and and unnecessary hold to it a little bit because there's a principle I'm sharing here in more uh more of an academic sense as a way of helping us understand something something spiritually and I want to maybe introduce or remind many of you of what of of a black box and we're not talking about in aviation uh brother John that wasn't you that had the emergency landing the flight out of Phoenix or coming to Phoenix okay saw a headline out about of Southwest Airlines flight that hadn't Tak an emergency landing I was like no brother John would have made it he would have made it all the way man but so this is a black box not in reference to Aviation but it's uh when I refer to a blackbox we're talking about a complex model that is not easily interpreted and so that's why so the phrase blackbox it's like it's you you can see what's on the outside but it's not easy to understand what's on the inside uh so it's some sort of complex model or system that you can't quite explain that you're you're not able to interpret it easily or it's not easily understood or maybe I could put it this way it's just not straightforward and I'm finding that it's starting to come up a little bit more with respect to AI because you know they've developed things and they feeded information and they get results and there's this black box with artificial intelligence where you don't know what's happening behind the curtain a a and that's what we there so you know things are going in you know things are coming out but there's this mystery as it were in terms of how does it come up with this and so a black box is a system which can be viewed solely in terms of its inputs and outputs without any knowledge of how it works internally so you see something go in you see something come out and you know it solely by what's going in and what's coming out but you don't know much about what's happening on in the inside and so it's a phrase for the scientists here the coders uh those in Computing and Engineering I think this is a phrase that's not foreign or is it okay I'm getting we we've resorted to sign language now and there you go all right so in engineering it would be an operation that acts as a part of a mechanism without any clear indication of How It's Working you know it works you get results but you're not sure how and if you just look at it that way you realize man my life's full of black boxes you know I just do this and it works and it it works all the time and uh I think like our kids you know they just think the refrigerator is a black box you know I I put an empty gallon of milk in it and there's a full gallon in the morning how does this happen but in other words the inner workings of the Box we use that phrase a black box the inner workings are not seen yet the results or the output can be observed you're not observing what's happening but you're observing what takes place that so the the uh concept again of a black box is you're making observations of different states maybe a stimulus or some sort of condition what something is before and what happens afterwards and so the results are observed I want you to kind of hold that in your mind the results are observed but the process that achieved the results is hidden or not understood or uh not easy to explain some of examples would be maybe the search engines you put in a term and you get the results and so you put in some data uh gave some sort of prompt and you get some results but you don't see the the web crawlers you don't see the algorithm that's working in the background algorithm would be a really good one where there's output and you get something but you don't know what's behind the scenes in the black box that's determining why you're getting the information that you're getting they even refer to the human brain as a black box and it's uh or maybe a brick for some people but it's uh it it they they can identify processes but they're not sure exactly why it's working the way that it does maybe in a more Elementary terms a lock is a black box where uh um you can see what happens the results a door handle they consider uh even could be seen as a black box and children sometimes that's that's what life is is all about is Uh something's they see something happens if I do this it gets this result but yet there's not an understanding of what's happening in the Unseen and now with that and just to be able to grab everybody back on the same page so it's we're not just getting academic with this Jesus in Matthew chapter 6 this is kind of like a black box as he's saying that there's people who are um outwardly praying and giving alms openly and wanting everyone to see what they're doing in Jesus is saying don't do like everyone else does but uh when you and then he says when giving alms don't do it publicly and then he says when it comes to praying don't pray openly and loudly and boisterously and broadcasting so that everyone can see you but he says when you pray enter into your closet and shut the door and so you the world sees you and now the the let's say then it doesn't because you're hidden in this place and then he says your father will reward you openly so there's something that happens in secret that produces a result that is going to be open and it's not necessarily explainable what's taking place in that closet what takes place from the time that you enter to the time that you're rewarded that that period of time isn't always easy to explain but you could say it happened all right I feel good now it's called a black box in this sense that it's uh opaque in other words it's light can't get through to it it's impervious to the Rays of light and if something's opaque in not a non-literal sense not talking about color it's not able to be understood it's not seen so the Black Box it refers to not the box but what can't be seen on the inside what's not understood so if I could say this the Box holds a mystery you see what go in you can see what comes out but the inner workings are hidden they're secret so this is my title if I could put it this way and apply it to the Resurrection The Mystery between death and life the between death and life The Mystery of the Tomb Christ is seen entering the tomb dead but then Christ is seen alive and so this is the mystery between death and life now let's just look at the scriptures scripturally the death of Jesus Christ is not a mystery in other words the Bible sets forth very clearly uh that he died and so there's a record that he dies now some can dispute whether or not he lived some could dispute uh whether or not he was who he uh who he was purported to be if he did exist but let's just look at the record that says he died on Ma in Matthew CH 27: 50 says Jesus when he had cried again with a loud voice yielded up the ghost we realize that his death was by crucifixion at the hands of the Romans at the request of the Jews and we could read a lot of different scriptures to show how Herod and pilate uh um are working together and at the request of the Jews let his blood be on our hands is what the Jews said but then it's by the Roman government that puts them to death under capital punishment and as he's hanging there upon the cross he cries with a loud voice it says he yielded up the ghost that means he died Matthew 15 excuse me Mark 15:37 Jesus cried with a loud voice and gave up The Ghost and Luke it says and Jesus cried with a loud voice father into thy hands I commend my spirit and having said thus he gave up the ghost this is this is the moment where he dies he says in John chapter 19: 28 to 33 it says after this Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished that the scripture might be fulfilled say I thirst now there was set a vessel full of vinegar and they filled a sponge with vinegar and put it upon hisp and put it to his mouth when Jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished now these things are happening so that scripture is fulfilled says and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost father into your hands I commend my spirit it's finished and he dies then it says the Jews therefore because it was the preparation that the body should not remain upon the cross on the Sabbath day for the Sabbath day was in high day besought pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away this was to ensure that they would die they they would expire uh more quickly and this you can go back to Deuteronomy and find where this has its roots in the law uh it's funny just how some things they can be real sticklers about meanwhile an innocent man is dying on the cross uh and and they besought pilot their legs be broken so they kind of haste in their death verse 32 then came soldiers and break the legs of the first and of the others which were crucified with them but when they came to Jesus and saw that he was dead already they break not his legs they do say that they thrust a a spear spear in his side and there's no audible groaning there's nothing as the the water and blood pours forth from him and here we can see that the Bible says that Jesus died now it's even witnessed of the soldiers they come to Jesus and they see that he was dead already therefore they don't break his legs that the scripture might be fulfilled not a bone of his was broken this is the record of the observed state of death that Christ is dead we see this moment in time on this on this crucifixion day on that Friday where Christ has been crucified and he is dead now let's skip forward a little bit and let's look at the scriptures that tell us show us Jesus's life after death and you'll see that his living after dying is not a mystery in other words there may be some that dispute whether or not he lived or whether or not he was even a real person but as far as the Bible's concerned there's its details clearly that he was alive after death and so there's a a great record about him living after he was dead and there are multiple Witnesses of him after he was crucified in Mark chapter 16 he's seen by Mary Magdalene in Matthew 28 he's seen of Mary Luke 24 on the road toas two disciples walk with him and their eyes are open and they knew him and then later in that very chapter he appears in the midst of his disciples he shows his hands and his feet he even sits and eats with them in John chapter 20 it recounts some of these other ones we've already mentioned but then he appears twice to his disciples uh first time Thomas isn't present the second time now Thomas is present and each time these are witnesses of him alive after death in John 21 he appears to the disciples on the sea of tiberias we see it in in Matthew 28 and Mark 16 and acts one he's before his Ascension he's appearing he's uh he's eating he's teaching he's giving them instructions these are all these instances and we'll keep uh coming back to some other places in the scripture because as we mentioned before God doesn't speak something unless he has a reason and there's so many instances of Christ uh report reporting in Christ after he was dead showing that he's clearly alive and Paul even WR writes it this way in 1 Corinthians chapter 15: 3 to8 for I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received how that Christ died for our sins according to the scripture so his death again now being recorded in the New Testament by Paul and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures a so there's his death burial and now he says and that and then now his resurrection and it's not just oh he resurrected but here's the record of it here's the observation and that he was seen of sephus which is Peter then of the 12 after that he was seen above 500 Brethren at once of whom the greater part remain of this present but some are fallen asleep so Paul is saying there's living Witnesses of this above 500 that he appeared to not just Peter and the other disciples there's over 500 that he appeared to uh and there's some that are still alive giving Witness some have died but some are giving witness still says and after that he was seen of James then all of the Apostles here's witness after witness after witness that Christ was there was life after death and then he says and last of all and this is the one that's real real neat to dig into last of all he was seen of me also as of one born out of due time these are witnesses of Christ being alive in other words this is the record of the obser oberved state of Life the Bible records this observed state of death that he was dead and then there it records that he is living so details in the scripture this recorded observed state after death well if I can say it this way it records him being dead and alive but then the Bible also records his state after death and before life and it tells us he's buried in a tomb so let's examine the record of him being buried in a tomb and Matthew chap 27: 57-60 this is the the the time of his crucifixion and when the evening was come there came a rich man of arthea named Joseph who also himself was Jesus's disciple he went to pilate and begged the body of Jesus I believe in another place it says he craved the body of Jesus he begged the body of Jesus then pilate commanded the body to be delivered now we're we're just wanting we're wanting to read the scriptures to find out what's happened we haven't gotten into the details of his scourging and his beatings and him being nailed to the cross and but we we've looked at him dying on the cross and him just quickly looked at scriptures how he's living after death but now let's just look at the details God doesn't speak something unless he's got a reason and it says that pilate commanded the body to be delivered and Joseph had taken the body when he had taken the body he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth and laid it in his own new tomb which he had heun out in the Rock and he rolled a great Stone to the door of the Seiler and departed so the the terms tomb and Seiler interchangeable in these readings that there it is like a a a hillside a cave as it were a great Rock and in this rock is heun out a place uh for burial and it tells us it's a new Tomb not an old one because there would be Graves where there'd be multiple bodies buried therein and not just one so it's one us to know that this is a new Tomb in that nobody else lays there there's nobody else buried there Joseph takes the body wraps it in clean linen cloth and it puts it in a a uh a cave heun out of a rock a room he out of a rock a place of burial then he rolls a great Stone in front of the door and then he departs it's told this way in Mark chapter 15 and pilate marveled if he were already dead and calling unto him the Centurion he asked him whether he had been dead whether he had been any while dead now this is Joseph comes to him and craves the body and pilate's like wait he's already dead and so here's another affirmation that Christ is dead he marveled that he was already dead he expired so quickly so he asked the Centurion and when he knew if of the Centurion in other words the Centurion confirms yes Jesus is dead he gave the body to Joseph and he and so there's that again a record of death and he bought fine linen and took him down and wrapped him in the linen and laid him in a Seer which was Hune out of a rock and rolled a stone under the door of the supper and Mary Magdalene and Mary the Mother Jesus uh uh beheld where he was laid so that's telling us again here's Witnesses Mary Magdalene Mary uh the mother of Jesus behold where Christ is laid and there's certain things we could say here a lot of things maybe I just going back over this past week and enjoying it but the the the idea that where he was laid was a place he out of a rock that he's wrapped in this linen that now Mary the two Marys are observing him de place so these details are important and I believe that God records these details so that we can understand uh the condition of Christ when he enters and even where he's entering and to remove remove any confusion I I I want to say that because the verse I'm about to read where there's maybe a lot of objections that could be offered that if you take Christ and you put him in a graveyard and all of a sudden you see a body walking out of the graveyard someone say Well that's not Jesus that's Tom right that that's not who you're purporting it to be it's somebody else cuz there was so many bodies there there's so many people laying there in John chapter 19: 41 and 42 it says now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden isin't that remarkable that where the place he dies there's a Garden nearby in the same tract of land to where they're Associated together in the same place there's a garden and there's a place of death and it brings us all the way back to the Garden where death entered and so here where he's dying nearby there is a garden this Garden in this Garden is a new Seer wherein was never man yet laid in other words no dead man has ever been in this place it seems to be the case with Christ where the Bible says he was separate from Sinners that God is wanting Christ to be distinct Jesus told his disciples to go find the foul of an ass that has never yet been ridden on by man and Christ was the first one to ride that colt into uh the city and here he is going to be the first one to be laid in a grave heun out of a rock therein no man has ever yet been laid it leaves no room for the speculation that it could have been another body that came out or that it wasn't Christ who Rose in verse 42 there laid they Jesus therefore because the the Jews preparation day for the Seiler was nigh at hand if I could say this I I I put forth scripturally there could be no question that Christ was dead when he entered the tomb and we read in Matthew chap 27: 62-66 in reading this it helps us to understand why this tomb was empty and no man had ever laid in it the only Bon that would be in the only body that would be in there the only supposed bones would be that of Christ wrapped in linen Bound by new linen Fresh Linen and it says in Matthew 27: 62-66 now the next day that followed the day of preparation that's where we left off in John 19 the chief priest and Pharisees came together un pilate saying sir we remember that that deceiver said while he was yet alive I mean he's dead there's still name calling that that deceiver while he was yet alive after 3 days I will rise again now what stands out to me is the fact that they remembered but the disciples didn't amazing how much the critics the dece they'll remember the words of a deceiver better than the faithful followers of Christ he says we remember that that deceiver said while he was yet alive after three days I'll rise again command therefore that the supper be made sure until the third day lest his disciples come by night and steal him away and and say unto the people he has risen from the dead so the last Heir shall be worse than the first they're they're thinking about this they're realizing that Jesus had said that I will rise in three days and now how they figured that out and how they picked up on that and the deci and it registered their head and it didn't to the disciples is something to be remarked on but they're saying kind of in a proactive way you know it would be it's one thing for him to die but it would be worse it would be worse for him to be a martyr and worse than having crucified him if somehow they're able to spend this tail by stealing the body of Christ and being able to say oh he's risen he's risen so this is them them wanting to be proactive about this body and I I I love it in this way it's ensured that this body was not going to leave at the hands of men it says pilate said unto them ye have a watch go your way make it as sure as you can and trust me if these that thought Christ was a deceiver had latched onto this idea that his disciples would steal the body in three days they were going to watch it and be sure that the disciples did not steal the body so it says so they went and made the supper sure sealing the stone and setting a watch we've already looked at Christ dead on the cross we've looked at Christ alive afterwards so the mystery is not in his death the mystery is not in his being alive later and we've walked with through these scriptures to see that now Christ has been wrapped in Linen in a grave in which no other man lies a rock that's been heun out in a place for his body and now the tomb is sealed Christ's dead body wrapped in linen is hidden inside and it's not just sealed it's under watch and The Observers are there to guard against theft they're there to guard against the stone being rolled away and they're there to be a witness of what may happen because they want to be able to testify if there's a war if there's a battle if there's a struggle over the stone and the stone is rolling away and the disciples steal the body they they want men to be alive to be able to say he didn't raise again he was stolen we witnessed it this is what happened so there is an effort by the natural men in that day to be sure that the body remains there in this sealed State then on in Matthew chapter 28 veres 1 to7 I'd like to ask the query you're just individually are you comfortable this morning is it is the pace okay are you I know you're not learning anything but it's just good to look at these things together like I said very very simple in Matthew chapter 28: 1-7 in the end of the Sabbath as it began to Dawn toward the first day of the week Came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the Seiler and behold there was a great earthquake for the angel Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the Stone from the door and sat upon it uh what happened this is this is the most detailed we get at this moment there's a great earthquake the angel Lord descends from heaven and comes and rolls the Stone from the door and sits on it his countenance was like lightning and his rainment white as snow and for fear of him the keepers did shake and became as dead men this is the the keepers those that set watch those that would have sealed it made it as sure as they can now they are shocked because they haven't fought with anyone externally that there was nothing nothing to be observed on the outside say I I hear them coming oh that's Peter if I've ever heard of Peter here they come they're going to wrestle with us for the body all of a sudden there's an earthquake and there's an angel sitting on the stone and the stone is rolled away and the angel answered and said unto the women and and now this is to this spoken to the women fear not ye for I know that you seek Jesus which was crucified I I I know why you've come and I I think we're going to be reading a few places where they were coming to anoint the body to give it the according to their ceremonial way of treatment of the dead and he says this he is not here for He Is Risen as he said come see the place where the Lord lay in other words come see for yourself I know you're coming to see Jesus who was dead but he's not here and he's not dead He's Alive come see where the Lord lay and he says and go quickly and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead and behold he goeth before you into Galilee there shall you see him lo I have told you so here's the angel of Lord sent it upon a stone there's different readings that kind of take you through a little bit Fuller picture of different things that are happening but behold there's an earthquake Christ is dead Joseph takes the body wraps it in linen brings him into the tomb rolls the the stone over it Mary and Mary are witnessing this uh the those that thought he was a deceiver go tell pilate look I'm sure as we're standing here they're going to try to steal the body so let's seal the tomb make it ass sure as we can and set watch and we're waiting now and the next thing we hear is there's an earthquake and an angel Lord descends the stone is rolled away and he sits upon the stone and those coming to see Jesus he says' I know you've come to find the body of Christ but the body's not in here see for yourselves and it says he's risen from the dead he goes before you and you'll see him alive what happened this is as close as we get and as I want to use this image the tomb acts as a black bux we we only hear that there's an earthquake we now see that there's an angel that can be seen of the those that keep were keeping watch and the keepers in the garden we we see that the the the women that came to the tomb early can see him but it the tomb has hidden what's happened Christ went in dead now he's going before them alive it there's something that's happened in this tomb in Luke 24: 2 and 3 and they found the stone rolled away from the supper and they entered in and found not the body of the Lord Jesus so the body's not there IM mark chapter 16 veres 4 5 and 6 and when they looked they saw that the stone was rolled away for it was very great and I maybe I don't have it here but there's one place where the women are surmising to themselves what are we going to do about the stone how are we going to get it open especially see as maybe they had heard through the grapevine that there were set watch they' sealed it and they made it sure as could be maybe they're thinking there's no way we're getting that open they've gummed it up and they've blocked it up and theyve watching over it we're not going to be able to get it open but the Bible's telling us they found the stone open they enter in and they don't see the body in Mark 16 and when they looked they saw the stone was rolled away for it was very great and entering into the Seer they saw a young man sitting on the right side clothed in a long white garment and they were arried that's a new word for us to use afed and he saith unto them be not afed ye seek Jesus of Nazareth which was crucified you seek Jesus which was dead he is risen he is not here behold the place where they laid him this is now uh um there's some observations taking place Christ was dead he entered in he was wrapped in linen he laid there these women can say we saw it he was wrapped tightly in these new linens he was laid there in this tomb the tomb the stone was rolled in front of the door but now the stone is rolled away this great Stone there's an angel in there he's saying don't be afraid Jesus which is dead is risen he's not here look the body is not here John 20: 3-7 Peter therefore went forth and the other disciple now they've gone and that Peter and John are returning and came to the suppiler so they ran both together and the other disciple did outrun Peter John's just being humble and came first to the supper and he stooping down and looking in saw the linen clothes lying yet went he not in so John could just look in and see the linen clothes so the very Linens that were wrapped around his body have come off and then then cometh Simon Peter following him and went into the Seiler and seeth the linen clothes lie now he's entering all the way in he's not stopping short he's not just peeking he wants to go in and he wants to examine it he wants to look he wants to be sure did you go all the way in did you search around is there any evidence that he may still be in in there is there is there Foul Play suspected what is it he says he seeth the linen clothes lie in the napkin that was about his head not lying with the linen clothes but wrapped together in a place by itself this is these are very intriguing details and I know you're all anxiously awaiting the mystery of the the linen cloth next year and there's between the lens uh the mystery of the cloth there's uh write that down in case I forget but there's these details are very interesting they're peculiar to think what what's happening now if I could just call back to the time in the resurrection of Lazarus when he's resurrected they rolled away the stone and they they they had to be taught loose him and let him go so though we we don't understand so much what took place but we do realize that there was some human means to open the stone there was some human means to unwrapping uh uh Lazarus but now this resurrection of Christ all this goes unobserved even how the stone was rolled away what was it the earthquake who did it but now the the Linens have been unwrapped the cloth is folded neatly together everything is very tidy and very neat placed together and if I could say this about the women if I could say this about John and Peter they're all looking into the tomb they're looking into the black box uh they're they're trying to figure out what happened but the only thing they could come up with is that he's not there I I see the linen clothes that were wrapped around him I see the napkin that was about his his head I I I see everything that was on him when he went in I saw him die on the cross I saw his body taken down I saw him wrapped in Linens I saw him laid in the Tomb I saw the napkin laid over him but now when I look I see it all neatly folded together that napkin lies there nothing's out of place nothing hurried nothing's torn apart but and I know he's not there anymore if I could say this the mystery is not in that he died and the Mystery was not in that he was living but the mystery laid somewhere in the middle in between his death and life after death this is what could was not observed this is what's not recorded if you think about all the details of the things that are recorded here in down to uh Joseph arthia craving the body and taking them down and buying new linen and wrapping them and then it just doesn't say well and they he put them in a grave it says there was one nearby there was a garden near where he was crucified and this was a a grave a tomb heun out of a rock in which no man ever laid and there's all these details given to it and then when it comes to the resurrection now this is where I want the details right I I want to know just exactly what's happening that can make a man that's dead live again I I want to know how this works I want to know the elements that relate to it I I want to be able to look into the box and see it happen and observe it happening but all the Bible says is there's an earthquake and the stone is rolled away we don't know what takes place in behind the stone uh we we don't know if he wrestled his way out uh and maneuvered his way out and and folded the we're we're not sure exactly what's taking place in the darkness but we know based upon what we can observe that Christ who is dead is alive there's no mystery that he was crucified and died and it should not be any mystery that he's alive but what happened in that black box what happened behind that stone these are things that again the Jews were wrestling with and those of the chief priests and Pharisees just as they were worried that the deceiver body would be stolen and they set watch now they had another problem to deal with because now the very ones who are to set watch and determine whether or not the disciples stole the body are now witnesses that they didn't they're now witnesses that the body was in there and then it wasn't well who took it nobody we sat watch and the next thing we know the stone is open and there's an angel sitting on the stone and there's no body in there and it was H out there's no other secret tunnel in there's no other way in there's no other explanations they couldn't say oh well there's another body in there we'll just allege that that's Jesus all these things have been controlled for as it were oh almost so this is what and this let me just say this this is always the tactic of the devil just lie the devil and even the critics are not afraid to lie to achieve their means of discrediting something that they don't agree with and in Matthew 28: 11-15 it says now when they were going behold some of the watch came into the City and showed unto the chief priest all things that were done so those that were setting guard those that were making sure the disciples didn't steal the body away in the night are now witnesses that something has happened and they go and they tell the chief priest guess what there was an earthquake break next thing we know the stone is rolled away and there's an angel sitting there and the body's gone and the linens are all wrapped together very neatly and the napkin which was about his head was laying and said did you seal it good enough listen we had it sealed really really good and there was more than just one man keeping watch we were not going to let this body be stallen trust me Chief priest the body was not stolen it's just not there anymore amen and so now they got to they got to call huddle and when they were assembled with the elders all hands on deck just made someone in corporate the corporate world get uh Buzzy and they they were assembled with the elders and had taken counil this is their conclusion they gave large money I want large money they gave large money was it a giant check you know like you see when they win the lottery here they gave large money under the soldier sers so these just weren't men guarding the tomb these were soldiers put the aid team on it put the SEALs team on it put the best just give guard long enough in order for them to not be able to take the body and they give large money to the soldiers saying say ye his disciples came by night and stole him away while we slept that's the only way to explain why these soldiers would have let this body get taken away is these band of bands of this band of men that were tasked with making the tomb secure and making sure the body didn't leave were asleep and they gave him large money to tell that story and says if this come to the governor's ears we will persuade him and secure you in other words do we all agree on our story so they took the money large as it was and did as they were taught in this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day they could they didn't even need the internet then just get the story out there so enough doubt tell a few lies and people will never know whether or not it was true or not just give people enough to work with and if they want a doubt they'll have something to work with so now this is the story that is told by these soldiers who were not overcome in a battle who did not let the stone get rolled Away by Earthly means and who did not allow the body to be taken by the disciples it's the story of those men that could say a dead body went in and there's no dead body there anymore Jesus Christ dies he enters the tomb dead but when you see him next outside of the Tomb he's alive this tomb this room in a cave or this CA this room in the side of a in a rock this cave in the side of a hill room heun out of a rock and then sealed this tomb hid the transformation if I could say this and this kind of just a whole another Channel this isn't a resurrection like Lazarus Lazarus would live again and die this wasn't a resurrection of those who had been dead before and they were brought back to life in a in a condition much like they were before they died but this is a different Resurrection this is a glorification this is a transformation even to where Christ was not recognizable in the state that he was in because could it be that he was young again could it be there was some resemblance but not so strong enough to the man who looked like he was 50 that went into the tomb but there was enough left to know yes look at his hands and look at his sides that stone and The Rock hid what took place on the inside a dead body beaten and bruised not yet broken but pierced aged well beyond his years thrown into crucified on a cross and thrown into a a room in the side of a hill in darkness and sealed and a watch set over it what took place the tomb hid the transformation his death was observed openly his death was observed publicly hanging on a cross and naked before the public to be scorned and he dies publicly the Centurion Witnesses when he gives up the ghost He says surely this was the son of God H those that had came beat their chest and walked away it there was many that could witness that day he dead yes amen we also know that his life afterwards was observed death life both observed in Acts 2:32 this Jesus hath God raised up whereof we are all Witnesses they're Witnesses of life in Acts chap 3: 14 and 15 but ye denied the Holy One and the J and desired a murderer to be granted unto you and killed the Prince of Life there's his death whom God hath raised from the dead whereof we Are Witnesses now I'm giving you some Clues to some things they killed him but he's alive and we're Witnesses in Acts Chap 13: 28-31 and though they found no cause of death in him yet desired they pilate that he should be slain this is the record Being recited in the book of Acts and when they had fulfilled all that was written of him they took him down from the tree and laid him in a Seiler this is an unbroken narrative this is perfectly recorded everyone agreeing it says now the dead body enters the tomb but God raised him from the dead there's that phrase God raised him from the dead we can we can draw that conclusion based upon what we observe and when he he was seeing many days of them which come up with him From Galilee to Jerusalem who are witnesses unto the people so he saying he was seen many days this life after death is witnessed in Acts chap 10: 40 him God raised up the third day and showed him openly his death was open life is now witnessed life is open Paul said he was seen of above 500 people some are still alive today that saw him this was no hidden thing this just isn't The Whispers of the disciples this isn't some conspiracy much like it was for the Chief priest and the soldiers they had the little cabal they had the little secret but that nobody else could be witnessed to they were the only Witnesses of a lie and a fabrication but God raised Christ and set him before many witnesses over and over and over again so that there could be no disputing of the record of life these things could be observed as we see it in scripture crucified buried but now alive shown openly but what could not be observed is what happened behind the stone I know this is very very simple and I I'm I'm wanting it to be that way what could not be observed was what happened in the Tomb says in Acts chap 5:30 I hope you could just see it I'm not even using all the scriptures that could be used in these things the god of our fathers raised up Jesus whom ye slew and hanged on a tree I've read four Witnesses now five witnesses that Christ was laid in a grave buried as Paul calls it laid behind a stone dead in God raised up Jesus in darkness behind the stone his death is public his manner of death is public and then we could say even as teaching in manner of life after he resurrects is public it's seen it's witness but this thing God does something in secret God God does something hidden would would it not seem more dramatic and plausible to witness that this is the Son of God than to see him expire and die on the cross and then in the eyes of those that slayed him he animates back to life and he's transformed and all that saw him die would see him change again into a glorious being would that not have been more Supernatural it seems like that would be more Godlike that would be more indisputable but yet God does something in the dark God God does something hidden behind Stone in a black box he does something seemingly impossible in Acts chap 2: 22- 24 Peter says ye men of Israel hear these words Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God among you by Miracles and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you as ye yourselves also know they witness the Miracles they witness the ministry him being delivered by the determinant counsel and forn knowledge of god wow you have taken and by Wicked hands have crucified and slain he lived he manifested miracles signs and wonders but according to the determinate counsel and for knowledge of God he has allowed you with Wicked hands to crucify him and slay him we arrive at verse 24 with the dead Christ verse 24 whom God hath raised up and this is maybe as close as we get to maybe even some imagery as to what takes place having loose the Pains of death because it was not possible that he should be Holden of it so here he is bound by the chains of death then wrapped literally in new linen laid be in a in a cave hollowed out of a stone and a stone rolled up against it and there he lays in this dark cold grave Bound by Linens but yet in a very real sense he's Bound by chains of death and the Pains of death are wrapped around him but the Bible says that God raised up Jesus and it uses this poetic phrase having loosed the Pains of death and know it's the cords of death were broken the bands of death were broken if I could say this never before had they been broken like this a man is born and he's ordained to die and a man that died seemingly untimely if he raised again we understand that that chain is still linked to that man and it could only go so far before death comes and stops him brother brandom even tells us of those who should have died at a certain time but yet they recovered they miraculously and that one baby that died and brother br's able to go back in a vision and say oh they should have died then and now they've gone now it just shows that that death comes and there's no way to break those bands but now this is what's so remarkable death doesn't always lose its grip for for mankind he just kind of lets them uh loose for a little bit of a season but now the cords of death are broken he has loosed the Pains of death and it says because it was impossible for death to hold him Hallelujah hell death Hell In The Grave had no more power over him no matter how much it wanted to hold him no matter how much it felt it had a right to him death was intent upon keeping it back I asked my wife if she was going to sing the conversation this morning as a special all by herself and because it would just it would aati I we just did it on the way to church and so it wasn't something we took seriously and we're practicing there at the piano SE that's very good sister uh there's this idea that I'm going to hold him nobody's ever got away from me before he's not going to escape me but now all of a sudden it's like I I'm the same death I was before I'm men are still dying there's those that still remain in the grave I I I I still I seemingly have power but over this one Hallelujah and some others I don't have power over anymore I I still seem to have strength I'm still death I still have power but my bands and my power over this one has been loosed and when this one has been loosed it did something else to those who are in Paradise Hallelujah the chain was broken listen to how job says this in Job chapter 14 oh I'm getting excited I'm preaching over an hour now Job chapter 14: 10-15 but man dieth and wasteth the way that's what man does yay man giveth up the ghost that's what Jesus is recorded over and over and over saying is he gave up the ghost this should bring us back to Job 14 when a man gives up the ghost he dies he Wast away and he's no more as the waters fall fail from the sea and the flood decayeth and drith up so man lith down and riseth not till the heavens be no more they shall not wake nor be raised out of their sleep now think of that description this is man that enters the tomb this is death this is observed job is not just speculating saying well we're all new here no one's died but this is what I think's going to happen no they've witnessed it time and time again that when a man dies he Wast away they've seen the bones they've seen the dust they've seen the Decay it could have been even more descriptive of the the skin worms that eat away and the body rotting and away and it's gone and he's no more and there's something that could be observed in nature but when it came to man you could be the this flower could die and seemingly go back into the ground and the next year it comes up again grass could die the next year it comes back again leaves could fall off a tree the next year it comes back again job could observe so much cycles and nature he says but man's different as great as he is when that man is swn into the ground when he dies he doesn't come back up again from the earth you don't ever see this man again and then he says this now think about hopefully we've walked through this together where this just have some punch and we've we've walked enough around in this black box we've walked up to the tomb and if you're John you just peaked in if you Peter you went all the way in hopefully enough about this scene is with you to hear this then job in pondering what happens to man when he dies and he Wast away and he's never seen again he makes this prophetic declaration oh that thou would has hide me in the grave hide me don't just bury me don't let me just rck die and waste away when something's hidden it's put there to be retrieved later amen there's a difference when you when someone says I lost my wallet versus I hid my wallet and forgot where I hid it there there this is something where I plan to come back again I plan to return so he says oh that thou would hide me in the grave that thou wouldest Keep Me In Secret Keep Me In Secret it's not observed man cannot says keep me in secret until thy wrath be passed that thou wouldst appoint me a set time and remember me Jesus Christ went into the grave death the judgments of God brought death there had to be something accomplished by his death but once God's Wrath was satisfied death no longer had a right to the body of Christ and here is job cries out oh if you just would hide me in secret and then remember me when you're wrath has been plated in other words don't just bury me in the ground to rot and die but Place me in a grave as it were you are hiding me from Mankind and then remember me to come get me again amen hallelujah keep me in secret until thy wrath is overpassed and then he comes to verse 14 if a man dies shall he live again what a question all the days of my appointed time will I wait that time that set time that you would remember me I'm not going to be wasting I'm not going to be decaying I'm going to be waiting till my change Come Thou shalt call and I will answer thee thou will have a desire to work to the work of thine hands the thing which you have made the thing you have created though death may seem to have taken me and buried me in the earth I'm not buried to decay I'm not buried to waste away I'm just hid in secret and then you're going to call I'm going to have a appointed time where I come back and the one that man says when a man dies can he live again man waste away what's remembered of him there's no man that comes back from this he speaks that man Wast away but job said oh that you would appoint me a time where I wouldn't forever remain hidden but that I could come back again in Acts 13: 32-37 and we declare unto you glad tidings how that the promise which was made unto the fathers God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children in that he hath raised up Jesus again as it is also written in the second Psalm Thou Art my son this day have I begotten thee and as concerning that he raised him up from the dead now no more to return to corruption this is where it's different oh this man was raised but died again this man was raised he died again but this one this is different he said on this wise I will give you the sure mercies of David where of he saith also in another Psalm Thou shalt not suffer thine Holy One to see corruption job said when man dies he waste away it is sown in demand that when after a certain amount of time the body begins to Decay and to corrupt for David after he had served his own Generation by the will of God he fell asleep was laid with his fathers laid in a grave with other men Christ was separate from Sinners he's not laid in a grave with his fathers he fell asleep laid unto his fathers and saw corruption he say so these verses could not have been speaking about David but he whom God raised again think of this saw no corruption this is remarkable that God did not allow corruption to set in he watched out over the body so that the bone was not broken he watched out of it so verse after verse after verse just fulfilled and now there's a word that says I will not suffer him to see corruption and unseen to man man could play a little bit of schro dinger's cat and say there's a body inside is it corrupting is it not the only way to know is to observe it so they open up the box to see whether or not the body's decaying and it's not there anymore wo if I could say this as I try to wrap this up now that I've learned to preach more than an hour I need to figure out how not to preach an hour and a half between death and life I just want to put it this way very simply and it doesn't change the mystery it just adds more color to it between death and life was God look at these scriptures that had to be fulfilled for his death these scriptures that had to be fulfilled for Life The W the word stood there amen as a preserver so that Christ would not see corruption the word was there Christ was not just thrown into a grave and hid behind a stone job said oh that thou would hide me and keep me in secret he the word was there is a hiding place we read it already in Luke 23:46 and when Jesus had cried with a loud voice he said father into thy hands I commend my spirit and having said thus he gave up the ghost he was now at this very moment realizing I'm full I have fully abandoned and given myself completely so now at this moment that I'm dying I'm not just being commit my body is not just being committed to a grave my spirit is being committed to God John 10: 17 and 18 therefore do do my father love me because I laid down my life that I might take it again no man taketh it from me but I lay it down of myself I have power to lay it down and I have power to take it again but over and over and over and over and over again we read that God raised Christ from the dead and the power he said this commandment have I received of my father if I could say this God was the inner workings of the Black Box his command his charge and his word said he will not corrupt he will be hidden for an appointed time but I will call and he'll come forth am the word will preserve him the word will keep him the word will hide him and it may be secret it may be unseen but eventually there he will come forth and it will be seen if I could say this it wasn't just a tomb and I want to go quickly and I'll just pick up some of this on Wednesday night it wasn't just a tomb it was a secret meeting place a secret meeting place hollowed out of a stone he said into thy hands I commend my spirit think about how that there Abraham desired a burial place and they all looked to this one spot this one plot and they all want to be there because it was something about the place and it wasn't so much that the bones would be there but there would be power present to raise the bones and so when Jesus says into thy hands I commend my spirit there is a grave near the Garden near the the sight of his death there was an appointed place a set time Jesus was not just being scattered into the ground he was not just being thrown into some pit there was a special place prepared a sight heun out of a stone and and work made prepared fresh and new and it was a hallowed place out of a stone where he laid in Isaiah 45:15 it says verily thou art a God that hideth thyself that means a god who's hidden who carefully hides himself and conceals themselves the Bible says thy way is in the sea other words when a ship passes through it it doesn't leave a track that you can follow later thy path in the Great Waters and thy footsteps are not known God moves and God works and and and you never see it he hideth where he works he's secret in the way that he does things for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways he says for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than yours and my thoughts than yours could I say this and I don't mean it in a crude way God is a black box there there are certain things about him that we accept and I think even just a someone who's just sane and sober would have to accept Supernatural would have to accept Divine but God is a black box something where there is no clear explanation something difficult to understand or explain something unexplainable something unsolvable Hallelujah something that cannot be interpreted that's why why we have science that's why we have so many religions it's man looking at a black box we see what goes in we see what comes out we know there's got to be something Beyond the Veil we know we got there's something that works beyond what we see but God cannot be described God cannot be contained God is that black box the secret things belong unto the Lord but then he says but those things which are revealed belong unto us the black box is unexplainable it's a mystery to himself no man knows the father but the son and to whom the son will reveal him this is the the mystery of God this is the mystery of who he is the mystery of purpose and the secret things are in the black box and they belong to him but the things which are revealed to us belong to us forever death entered the tomb but God reversed it happened in secret it happened in darkness in Acts chap 26:8 why should it be thought to thing incredible with you that God should raise the dead I ask the question now as Paul is there contending and there's this wrestling with it in this uh you know well there's no disputing they're not saying well Jesus is a myth Paul this guy never lived they observed the death this man Jesus of Nazareth was witnessed to be dead he was witnessed to be placed in a tomb he was witnessed to not have been stolen but now the grave is empty and he's seen and so Paul in a way he's offering he's offering not so much an explanation but just uh the con illusion why would it seem such a hard thing why would it be incredible that God should raise the dead remember the scripture we read in the beginning in Peter for even here unto were ye called because Christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that you should follow in his steps his steps were to a cross carried to a tomb but he came out of that tomb in John Chapter 13 Jesus Is Telling uh the the witnesses and the scribes and different ones the non- disciples you know you can't follow me you don't know where I'm going and then Peter's like where are you going and he said where I go you can't follow me now he said but you will afterwards in other words he was laying for steps and he said you can't go where I'm going now but you will be able to later and though we realized this for foreshadows many things I want us to look at it for ourselves where he was going then we couldn't go but we can now into thy hands I commend my spirit and I'm going to be taken to a laid behind a stone on a cold slab wrapped in Linens and there's going to I'm I'm going to be trusted to this sealed in no way of excape wrapped and bound but I'm trusted in a God that raises the dead and though the process may not be able to be explained and though the specifics leave us something to be desired in terms of just exactly what was it we say well it was the word it was the word of God that's the word that did it I know there's something in this it says but how and how did it work and how was it said and what did it do and where did it start we want to find the Fingerprints of the evidence we want to be able to replicate it we kind of want the copycat recipe for what was happening behind that stone but what we know is God was in there amen amen and we can follow in Matthew Chapter 6: 5 and 6 When you pray don't be as a hypocrite stand in the synagogues in the public openly praying oh look at me look at me don't do that but thou and just meditate on these words this week but thou when thou prayest you when you pray enter into thy closet that word is secret real an inner chamber if I could say this where the father is amen because he says and when thou has shut thy door the stone has been rolled in front of the door you're not even praying with the door open right because that's that's what a uber Pharisee would do right like he'd say well you know I won't do it on the street corner but you know just open the door a little bit oh God right just do it right in the door doorway but I'm in the closet no he says no shut the door hide yourself and the Father which is in secret this place that we've got to enter into it represents death to self but above all it represents trust in a God you don't see Amen in a God that at the moment you can't put your fingers on and the Father which is secret the Father which is hidden will reward thee openly on the other side of the Black Box Brothers if you could come to your instruments maybe we'll add a little bit to this on Wednesday but the glory of God entered behind the stone and brought a resurrection and Paul says that therefore in Romans 6:4 therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father now that that's just that's just like saying the key that goes into a lock and it turns and the lock unlocks you say what's the key that did it but yet still in the Black Box what's turning what's moving what kind is it the glory of God entered in behind the stone and raised up Christ from the dead raised up by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life that we too have a place that we can go that we too can be quickened to walk in newness of Life there as the seed was swn into the grave Christ the Original Seed swn into the grave as job witnessed it as men talk about it and it said all the cycle of nature a seed goes on the ground it comes up it Withers and dies it comes back again Christ was swn into the ground and in order for him to come back again light entered into the darkness and the quickening power of God the shikina glory the Bible says the glory of the Father the light of God's presence quickened Christ back to life and God ha both raised up the Lord and will also raise up Us by his own power he says it again in 2 Corinthians knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise us up also by Jesus and shall present us with you Jesus Christ went into the ground as a seed and the light struck the seed and the Darkness behind the stone unable by uned by man was quickened back to life and in Romans chap 8: 1011 and if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness you have death and you have life but what is it in between but the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you I'm just I don't think I'm doing anything to try to uh understand the mystery of the Tomb anymore but just to say that you're living out of Mystery you're living out of a mystery how a dead dying decaying body inside unseen by the world there's it's harnessing quickening power that though the world cannot observe totally and completely what is taking place inside of you inside of you there's a transformation happening oh brother Bram what's the what is the translation what is a translation change that's all in other words just as there was an earthquake and the ground shook and the stone rolled away and he was no longer in the Tomb inside of you right now you are a black box un unheard of to the world unrecognizable to the world uninterpreted to the world but God one day is going to finish the process that quickening power that laid behind that stone emptied it out and reverse death and it's that same Spirit dwelling in you now amen and I say pay attention to what's going in pay attention to what's going in feed on it feed on listen to the word of God MP3s tapes read it however you can get it feed on the message of the hour keep being faithful to church come on the Wednesday nights kids eat free anyways feed on it just feed on it watch what's coming in you know why because one day what's taking place secretly in here that communion oh that thou would as hide as me hide me in your the secret of your presence one day brother Bram in the sermon it is the rising of the sun he said he sent his word to his disciples he is believing fear not for I'm he that was dead and is alive again forever more and I have the keys to death and hell I've already conquered it death and then life he says Don't Fear anymore between death and life don't fear anymore for every for ordained predestinated seat of God shall come to life when that light spreads across the Earth of the Glorious gospel in every age it'll bring forth the crop that God ordained it to do he had raised from the dead oh what a wonderful thing that is I am alive brother says I am alive or quickened the word means word quickened the Greek word means that something that's made alive after death oh what a mystery Dead Alive Dead Alive what happened in between he says like the seed that goes in the earth it has to die every bit of the seed it has to rot every bit of the seed and every bit of the life that was in the seed has to come forth again he was quickened not only that and I will send the same life that quickened me the power that brought me from the grave I will send it upon you to Quicken you that where I am there that where I am there ye will be also am surely it could be said to the disciples where I'm going you cannot follow me now but now he invites you to that secret place he invites you to that chamber oh and it may seem fearful it may seem like something oh I'm just not sure what the future holds I'm not sure what's going to take place in there but it's a place of trust and I promise you he's there you may not know what happens behind that Veil you may not understand what's happening in that secret place but he's there and that's where he wants to meet you and that's what's happening in the age we're living in right now the Father which is in secret hidden unseen he wants us to meet us meet us in that place between death and life and we can understand it better by the mystery of this black box the tomb I know there's a lot there just to think about but it should mean something to us there's so many mysteries in this world so many unknowns and unseens and so many things we don't understand say father into thy hands I commend my spirit father into your hands I give my life just as Christ abandoned himself to the cross and in doing so he abandoned himself to the Grave he was not going to be forgotten because there in darkness there in that hidden place the father I know as we covered it last year in the image of Christ entered into heaven if we could just bow our heads for a [Music] moment I'm just overwhelmed with this image of God embracing his son and this Embrace so warm to [Music] omnipotence and I see a father holding his son tight to his bosom saying you did it son you did it it's over it's finished I knew you could do it I knew you would go this path I knew you could trust me I knew you would trust me and there in [Music] secret perfect love begins to have its [Music] way there in secret hidden is a union between word to word word father to son I don't know the mystery of the Tomb with as much Authority as I can wield with quotes and Scriptures it doesn't mean all the answers are plain but what I do know is he's there God was there and that's all that mattered and with all of life's mysteries maybe there's one hurdle that someone needs to overcome and that's the fear of entering into that secret place to trust him when all hopes is lost when the Pains of love lost and whatever it might be bombarding us just to flee to him the Bible says a man will be a rock we have a hiding place that we can go to there in secret he'll do for you the unexplainable that which cannot be interpreted that which cannot be explained but you'll be able to say one day all I know is I'm changed I know I went in broken and I've come out fixed I went in sick and I've come out healed I went in scared I've come out bold and courageous would you be willing to enter in today if you could let's stand together as a [Music] congregation let's bow our heads in a word of [Music] prayer do you want to come run into him today you want to run into his arms you know could you imagine Jesus when he committed his Spirit into the hands of God and he was going to have this unseen reunion and they were going to meet in this way of saying it's done it's finished you did it it's over I can have Fellowship again with my creation my Redemption is now it's it's purchased God even himself realized he's on the other side of redemption now and it's could you imagine Jesus being nervous and Afraid fearful that it wasn't enough he didn't do good enough or that God was going to say yeah you know I think I'll just try another son there was rest there was rest in that tomb and that's the image that's offered to you in the secret place when thou prayest enter thou into thy closet it's a place of rest place of trust not because it's hidden so much from the world and robbers can't get to you and people can't annoy you but it's because he's there that secret mechanism in the black box that makes all things possible so I pray for you to today that you could just trust him more between death and life as mysterious as it may be trust him our gracious heavenly father today Lord this Easter Sunday as we've entered into the afternoon father we're just so grateful we're grateful for the record that there can be no disagreement that your son died surely the scripture could have been written in such a way to where our theological debates today could be over whether or not there was a certain number of lashings requisite to retire our sins and just how much he was beaten and bruised for our iniquities and just how much he was striped for our healing and there could be so much speculation as to what his life meant afterwards and whether or not he did live and where he's gone now and all sorts of things Lord but you provided so much detail in the word to where we know you sent your son and he died cruel death and then just likewise just as much as it was detailed in death it's detailed in life and he's appearing to disciples to over 500 he's eating he's walking along the sea he's he's fellowshipping he's teaching there's life no doubt about it and we have witnesses that observe that Christ has now some ways appeared gone back into another Black Box he's out of our sight and so Lord our eyes turned back to that tomb the mystery of what took place behind that stone somehow someway the word tells us as you raised up Christ from the dead you will raise us up we may not be able to explain it we may not be able to interpret it we may not even be able to conceive how but we believe that you will and that you are and we'll trust you and as a body of Believers today we say into thy hands into thy hands oh God into that secret place we come hide us hide us away oh Lord until the change comes I don't want to leave Lord until till the change comes cuz one day the stone will be rolled away and we will meet in the air and until then until then Lord keep doing what you do in secret keep doing what you do hidden and unseen that we may be rewarded openly we love you Lord we thank you for this gift we commit ourselves to you now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen
