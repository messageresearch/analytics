TRANSCRIPT
========================================
as we read that and as we think about what that scripture means to us even how we've kind of referenced it I think a few times even taking some time to look at how love thy neighbor as thyself is kind of all the law and the prophets hang on that and even as Jesus said it and Paul refers to it that we are to love the Lord thy God with all that we are and with the perfect love and then to love thy neighbors as thyself there's three different loves that are expressed there and uh and to think that in doing that and loving your neighbor as thyself is saying this is the fulfilling of the law there's so much that is emphasized in that and so tonight with the subject of love and hate we're ref what we've been doing is kind of wrestling with the different aspects of perfect love and how it varies from Human love because there's some things that we could say I will love if you love someone you're kind to them if you love someone you're patient with them and there might be attributes of human love or love that can be tainted uh that might seem to be the same attributes of a perfect love or the love that we would have for God but I've been laboring in a way to kind of separate the human love and perfect love or love that is divine and there's been three main themes in this series as we've looked at perfect love there's a knowing God's perfect love for us and then a growing in perfect love for God but then also showing God's perfect love to others I think you've seen that in the what we've expressed as maybe the the horizontal relationships and the vertical relationships that we want to know God's love for us better we want to grow into a more perfect love for God and it just can't end there we want to love one another correctly with the right kind of love and in looking at love and hate I think we're using words that are very familiar to us and we've been pointing out that perfect love may share some similarities with human love but perfect love is always pure and as Paul is saying here in Romans chapter 13 that you cannot love your neighbor and do any evil to your neighbor and in Mana in love in your neighbor and if we just say well I don't know what that looks like and we just admit that there is a perfect love that you could have for your neighbor there's a way that you could love your neighbor according to the scripture and and you'd say that if you could love your neighbor and in doing that whatever that looks like and if we don't know what that looks like we say but we can agree that if we do that we actually fulfill the will of God that we actually fulfill all the law that all the law and the way that it's multifaceted for the Jesus and the writers to say man if you could just get this part down the rest would be easy then it really speaks to me it really speaks to the pure character of perfect love that there's something about the love for God and God's love for us that when it's manifest it's always pure and and loving your neighbor the Bible is telling us you can do no evil to him nor can you commit any evil to God so the Bible does not say love thy neighbor and in loving Thy Neighbor it fulfills the law so whatever you think you need to do to love your neighbor that's going to be the Fulfillment of God's love regardless of what it does to God's word or how it views God's word but in other words if you love your neighbor you can do no evil against your neighbor neither can you commit any transgression in God's word so kind of you cannot offend God's word by loving your neighbor I think as we said last Wednesday the highest form of of Love towards anyone would be manifesting the true nature of the word of God that it's not like well I think the nicest thing I could do to speak their love language and the nicest thing I could do is get them something they like and we think of all these terms and ideologies that maybe we can use uh to express love and to convey things to uh to somebody and we think oh well if I could just if I could just speak in a way that they can understand and I believe that in its most simple basic way the best way the highest form of loving someone is manifesting the true nature of the word and sometimes it takes a lot of breaking down and humility to find how God's nature needs to be expressed to somebody I I this just kind of this thought is bombarding me right now and it's something I've come across a few times but I've actually been revisiting a lot of things that I had been taught Through The Years in terms of parenting and different um ways of parenting your children and and the deeper you get into the word of God sometimes you go back and you look at some of the things you were taught and you cringe a little bit because it doesn't come from the word and it doesn't come from the message of the hour it comes from somebody who maybe never wanted to have kids and hated them right and so they just equip you with a lot of ways to inflict pain upon your children and I and I realized that even and I don't mean any offense to anybody who may subscribe to this Theory but there's this there's some things that just become these our minds just kind of latch onto it says you don't want to become the threatening repeating parent and we say well that that's the true nature of the Devils to be a threatening repeating parent and then the more you read in the Bible you find that God is so long-suffering he comes across as a threatening repeating parent it was I have to reject the nature of God to adopt somebody else's theology in terms of how I need to raise the kid my kids and I realize the best thing I could do for my children is to manifest the nature of God and I find myself praying more and more God give me wisdom to know what's needed in the moment that I find myself in but the highest form of love that we can express is to manifest the word of God now on the subject of of love and hate I'm wanting to look at the relationship between love and hate some may say there is no relationship but at least we can explore that and it may be to find out if there actually is a righteous hate or a true hate and I find that the very things that kind of led me into this area that kept love and hate kept surfacing is I'm kind of aiming to address the ugly side of loving God with the perverted love so that we could take a love for perverted things and we say well that's that's filio and that's worldly love and that's lust and that's that's wrong if that's foul and any love that we say points downward to the Flesh and points downward to Earthly things we say that's a base lover a human love but there's this ugly side of claiming to love God but yet it's a perverted love it's not a perfect love and so there's a real ugly side to that because how easy it is to justify ourselves when that happens but before we go further let me say this we've touched on how that perfect love is loyal to God's will so that it's protective of God's purpose and that loves evidence is centered on uh perfect love being an expression of God's word so there's this idea that when we realize I think we went through different things that God is his word God is love scriptural trait of loving God is obeying his word and so we can kind of develop this real rigid system that if I love God I keep his word if I love God I'm obedient to his word so it it tends to contend to some sort of legalism uh force or intimidation because we we feel like as long as I'm doing his word that's love but our Humanity can easily co-opt uh what we see as attributes of God's word for our own vanity our own Pride our own self-serving uh reasons and I and and maybe that that needs to kind of be the the kicker to start thinking now if you turn to Psalm 139 verses 21 and 22 I come I arrive at this scripture now as I'm thinking about ways that we view God or his love or the word and it takes on a certain character by our perception like we're seeing it through our own glasses our own lens our own filter and there's a part of it says yeah I like that and we try to use that this veneer of God's love really to serve ourselves and to serve some other emotional agenda that's very far from the love of God and David says and I know you all can just repeat this by heart without even looking it up do not I hate them O Lord that hate thee and am I not grieved with those that rise up against thee and the church said I hate them with perfect hatred I count them my enemies I'm sure you all have thought about this scripture in terms of love and hate but he says I hate them with perfect hatred I count them mine enemies do I not hate them that hate thee and it this seems to be uh if you put it that way you could find yourself kind of going yeah I mean if somebody hates God I mean I'll just take them right back and I and there's this feeling that maybe that this has some sort of we have some sort of affinity to it without having to rationalize very much if you knew somebody hated your children you might just instinctively say why I oughta right it's just it's just natural if somebody hates someone you love it creates that adversary relationship that the enmity is there uh just by virtue of those different extremes and your love for the object he says I hate them with perfect hatred I count them mine enemies and I wonder just how easily maybe even just based upon a scripture like this how easily do we justify hate when someone disagrees with us or offends us like if someone says you know oh I don't believe like you or somebody says something to offend you or somebody does anything happens like just in this realm to where some sort of sensitivity of ours or some like or dislike is offended by somebody else how easily is it for us to hate them or Justify our hatred based upon description in other words we we Harbor hate that is an evil but yet we say we we hate them because it's against God's word as I was studying this I found that some people note um they paid attention to the fact that this is being written in the Old Testament and there's this sense of my look at the difference between a Jew who doesn't have the Holy Spirit and the nature of a Christian and what what a vast difference in temperaments what a vast difference in desire and as I read through the book of Psalms a lot of the Psalms this past week and reading through a lot of these different scriptures you find where there's a lot of things in the Old Testament that kind of have that edge and that lack of Greece and that cutting and that tearing down and you can certainly see that there's a different nature under the law a different nature under the Old Testament and certainly a Christian would have a different nature than those of The Unborn again Jew but I asked could there be a perfect hatred because he says I hate them and I hate those that hate thee but then he says you know what let me just put it this way I don't just hate them I hate them with the perfect hatred and I wonder and I'm kind of I'm not just wondering this and then for the rest of the service I'm just going to kind of like spitballing I don't know you know help me out here so we try to figure this out I mean I'm I'm saying this maybe to prompt some thinking but there is could there be a perfect hatred that not just a hate but a perfect hate if there is a faith and a perfect faith if there is a love and a perfect love could there be and in some realm some way could there be a perfect hatred the word that David uses here the psalmist uses is perfect it means the end or the consummation completion completeness and it comes from the root to accomplish or fulfill and so we're thinking again I hope you're thinking of because you remember perfectly with perfect recall Parts one through eleven and where we defined perfect love and it's When Love is perfected it fulfills its goal it fulfills its objective and so there's some sense of purpose some sort of sense of accomplishment so he says when I hate them with the perfect hatred in other words this hate has found its intended target it's fulfilled its purpose it accomplishes what it ought David if I could put it this way the psalmist or whether it's be David who wrote it um there's a psalm for David that it says well I just don't have a hate it's not just directed towards you know I hate oysters all right you know I I I hate the Diamondbacks or something like that but he's saying you know what in all the things I've hated throughout my life I finally have found the right uh Target of this kind of hate like if there's going to be some sort of animus is there going to be some sort of bitterness and hostility surely it could be towards this and and maybe bring in those other words into view could Cloud the picture a little bit but he's saying I I found I hate that is centered correctly could that be what he's saying is what I'm proposing and what I propose is there must be a Godly hatred there must be a hatred that is perfect that's pure that produces righteousness because the Bible speaks too often of a hate that originates within God and before we take a step further in looking at Godly hatred let's look at Second Corinthians 11 2. Paul says for I am jealous over you with a with Godly jealousy for I have a spouse you to one husband that I may present you as a chaste of Virgin to Christ and so I think it's his objective and his goal uh he's bringing into mind the type of zealousness that a friend of a bridegroom would have the kind of zealous a man would have over someone he's protecting for his friend or for his wife his uh the wife of a man of her husband and he says I am jealous over you with The Godly jealousy Godly jealousy implies that that maybe there's there's a way that we might think of jealousy and say well that that's that's Carnival he says this is a Godly jealousy you know this is a jealousy that that has God's honor at heart as I have espoused you to one husband uh my loyalty in my Zeal isn't for myself but it's to Christ that this is a zealous this is a Godly jealousy this isn't for my own vanity my own Pride but this is literally a Zeal for God and and I'm jealous over you not to honor my Ministry or myself but as a a Zeal that has God's honor in Christ's honor at heart the word zeal is this word jealous this comes from to desire to earnestly pursue it's translated to covet and envy and so for Paul to say there's a Godly jealousy there's there's some Pursuit and there's some something that you place above everything else that you covet that you can envy that can be in the category of a righteous desire or Godly Pursuit but it also means to be heated or to boil With Envy hatred and anger and we all know that there is a selfish jealousy which is cruel which is manipulative which is a condemning or controlling which is abusive and this is a this is a jealousy that often arises within the context of Human Relationships where where one has a love for the other maybe two people have a love for each other and if there's any kind of fear or or immaturity in that love jealousy can be one of those things that creep into it and it becomes very very possessive and I trust that none of you have experienced these things being raised in Godly homes and having good relationships and hopefully uh finding yourself whether courting godly people and ultimately marrying a Godly spouse that you haven't experienced this but for anybody who's spent any time in the world or has had a relationship that's a little bit broken jealousy is a nasty thing there there could be no trust when you're out of one another's presence there's this possessiveness of who are you calling who are you texting what are you doing and and and and all these things and barriers that are constructed to keep you uh under their control or within their view it's a very very nasty thing and so maybe there's ways that we can all relate to a jealousy that's manipulative controlling that's abusive we know there's a selfish selfish hatred which is spiteful it's mean it's destructive it's condemning yet the Bible says there's a Godly jealousy and there being a Godly jealousy I want to say that there's a Godly hate and I believe there's a Godly jealousy and a Godly hate that is an expression of perfect love I like the quietness it means you're listening and maybe you're saying I sure hope there's not a part two because we better get to the end of this in Exodus chapter 20 verses 5 and 6 it says Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them nor serve them for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God Paul was in a very safe place when he said that he was coveted and envied with a Godly jealousy to honor Christ and to present the bride or this this engaged one that he may present to as a Chase of urgent to Christ because God himself says I the Lord God am a jealous God and then as a result of this jealousy I hope you can see this next step visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children upon the third and fourth generation of them that hate me and showing Mercy unto thou unto thousands of them that love me and keep my Commandments he says I am a god that is a jealous God and the very next two characteristics that he expresses is Love and Hate that being a jealous God it was it's necessary for him to have some love and it's necessary for him to have some hate says I the Lord thy God am a jealous God and I will visit what they do what is due upon them that hate me but I'll show Mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my Commandments because they're one in the same says in Exodus 34 14 this is even more pronounced and more clear for Thou shalt worship no other God we know the Bible says there are no other gods beside me and this is mentioned in this context I think it's important that we recognize this for Thou shalt worship no other God for the Lord whose name is jealous is a jealous God so actually names himself jealous we know that God is love though he does not name himself as love here he is named as jealous and the Lord is a jealous God his name is jealous but notice how it says thou shall not worship any other God and and so he's saying let me explain this to you you cannot deify anyone else you cannot give honor and glory and praise and worship to anyone else because I I Am the Only God and there is no other God beside me there's only one God and therefore there can only be one loyalty and one love to one God there could be no other worship worship isn't due anywhere else there's only one God is there anything else you want to worship would we ever worship William random would we ever worship creation would we ever find ourselves worshiping the things that God loves and God honors no we we could not do that that love is only due to God he's one God therefore it's a jealous God because that love can only come to one there's only one God Thou shalt worship no other God for the Lord whose name is jealous is a jealous God so I know that maybe to this point some of these things are making sense to you but it might just be a little bit of rough patch there as we talk about love and hate and they're being a perfect hatred and maybe a Godly hatred and I will say this acknowledging the paradox love cannot exist without hate if it's if it's merely just the law of contrast I think that would be enough to satisfy but let me take it a step further and say perfect love cannot exist without perfect hate perfect love cannot exist without perfect hate in Deuteronomy chapter 7 verses 7 to 10 I'm going to read this and again it's really it's like an unto Exodus 20 where he says I'm a jealous God and so I'll punish those that hate me and I'll have mercy to those that love me he says in Deuteronomy 7 7-10 the Lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because you were more in number than any people for you were the fewest of all people a full church does not indicate God's love or blessing he says but because the Lord loved you and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your father's hath the Lord brought you out with the mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house of bondman for the hand from the hand of pharaoh king of Egypt so it's his love he said this is the love I have for you no therefore the Lord thy God he is God he's his name is jealous he's a jealous God but he's the faithful God which keepeth Covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his Commandments to a thousand Generations so notice how he's talking about his love there's dozens of places I could use tonight I know you're already thinking of all these different places we could use from the Old Testament where God talks about the love he has for Israel the love he has for his elect and so now as God has talked up I love you I chose you not because you were great not because you were Mighty but I chose you in a situation where you were clearly the oppressed and you were the victim and you were little and you were small and you were powerless and I love you and I'm going to keep my Covenant I'm going to I I I'm gonna could by whatever I swore to you I will fulfill it so now that his love is clearly in the air and everyone's feeling his love he says and repayeth them that hate him to their face to destroy them he will not be slacked to him that hateth him he will repay him to his face this is uh this this escalated quickly like we're just over here feeling all yeah yeah oh he loves us isn't this great and God is love and also and you right you're like all right he says I I'm gonna punish you I'll repay them that hate him to his face and and it's like he'll not be he's not gonna be Slack those that hate him he'll repay it's gonna it's gonna be obvious it's going to be a clear rebuke but why why would why would this the Lord did not set his love upon you because you were great and you were Mighty and he loves you and he's going to keep his promises and it's love love love love and then all sudden and anybody that hates God he's going to repay him to their face why because of his love should we start all over I think we got plenty I'm looking out across the audience I got after hour people with me tonight so I'm not afraid to go long but if you if you if you'll help me a lot tonight if you're catching it and at least say okay right because that indicates you're like all right I'm with you to that point you have to say Amen but you're like okay or you could even go huh I mean at least I know that you're like wrestling with him and watch it not too many huh or I'll repay you to your face the very reason why God verse 10 this is how this is how I feel to express it so you can understand if God says I love you and I love you and I love you and I love you and then there's somebody over there going and I hate God that loves you and God says oh and him too we'd all be like and and whatever happens I know this is maybe a crude example but it's like whatever his love for you does it works for this guy over here we'd be like well in the end I mean what good I mean what kind of love is it I know this is this is real carnal the way I'm trying to describe it but it's kind of like the ax murderer is in heaven right and it begs the question well what good is election what good is love what good is the cross if God's love is just kind of like well I know I said I love you and if you keep my Commandments I'll do all sorts of special things for you but I just can't find it in me to punish this guy who hates me so I and I'm putting it very Elementary maybe two over simplistic terms to recognize it's because he does love that it almost requires that he hates and so in Proverbs Chapter 6 verses 16 to 19 how many have already thought of this tonight these six things death the Lord hate so hatred is some sort of characteristic of God it is if I could say that it has that God helped me to find the right words to express it it's not that it it has Genesis purely in God of its own but it exists as an opposite to love and these six things death the Lord hate yay seven are an Abomination unto him so as we think as we read this invert it says a proud look a lying tongue hands that shed innocent blood and heart that divides with Wicked imaginations feet that are that be swift to run into mischief and so as we read these and it's kind of always remarkable that I mean he's writing he says there's six things God hates he's like no wait seven like he couldn't just couldn't just like line it out and write it write it out seven but these six things that the Lord hate yay seven are an Abomination unto him and a proud look a lying tongue hands that shed innocent blood a heart that devises we can imagine there's a feat that be swift to running to mischief and we think oh okay well maybe it's the proud look so we could change our look it's the it's the lying tongue so we could change our tongue or we could the hands and we think of like just these different parts and so maybe we're we're cutting we're dividing uh weaknesses in an individual but then he says a false witness that speaketh lies and now it's really hard to separate out which part we're talking about and then if it gets if you feel like there's still some wiggle room and he that soweth Discord among the among brethren so it's not just a look it's not just a tongue it's not just hands it's not just the heart it's not just feed it's not just a false witness but it's the person these six things I mean seven things that God hates that are an abomination the Abomination is something that God detests that's why when we read in the Bible there's a lot of things in the in the Bible that God gives the children of Israel as a law and it's a law this is this is something critical to understand and maybe to ponder he gives it to the children of Israel as a law to govern their human nature so God's given it to them as protective of nature given the fall but then there's other things that are reflective of God's on God's perfect nature and those things are an Abomination regardless of man's condition so when he says that it's an Abomination for a woman to wear a garment that pertaineth to a man and then he says but you better not Square you have to cut your beard this way or you better not mix your cotton with your linen you may say well this is in the law and this is in the law well God didn't say it's an Abomination to wear linen pants and a silk shirt I don't think he did but but there's certain things that maybe we place in this category that God give this prescription against it but then there's other things he says I don't care if you're Old Testament New Testament I despise it I hate it because it speaks to the character of God and as we read this it's not that God just hates the proud look and a lying tongue hands that shed innocent blood in the hearts of devise is wicked and feet that are Swift Swift and mischief and false Witnesses speak lies and he that so this chord it's he detests these things and hates these things because of the things he loves that's each one of these is against his nature and his character that's why when Paul says hey if you just won't kill and you won't steal and you won't do this and it begins to list all these uh different Commandments in the scripture and says and if there's any other ones they're all summarized in this one thing to love thy neighbor as thyself in other words the things that God hates are against the things that God loves amen therefore there is he says that he hates them now you cannot truly love God and this is I think this is where it gets um uh you have to get real this is I I I hope that what's happening is as we said there's this ugly side of loving God of having the perverted love towards God that we try to take these things that are Godly hate Godly jealousy so try to pull into this other realm now there should be a separation but the things I'm getting ready to read is where people start conflating their own personal agendas with the spirit and nature of God and it's a false love because you cannot truly love God or his word without the consequence of hating the opposite I hope that satisfies in the way I phrase it took some time to try to find just an exact a right way to convey that um I find with with the gift that God has given me I admire the Ministries that are much different much greater much more charismatic I find that God deals with me in uh in getting myself out of the way long before I get behind this desk to try to find the mind of God than just getting up here with the phrase love and hate and just kind of trying to explore it a little bit and by inspiration come up with ideas to share with you on that and so sometimes there's very specific things I feel to say to convey it and we cannot love God without the consequence of hating the opposite of God notice this and I'll just use Psalm 119 as an example there's three different places there's more that I could have used even from Psalm 119 but I felt like this that this conveyed conveyed some of these things well I don't know why I'm DJing up here so much verse 104 through thy precepts I get understanding now if we look at this as our beginning place to say that the more he understands about the word therefore I hate every false way so as his love for the things of God grew as his knowledge of the word of God grew as he gets understanding through the word he hates every false way now it's he could not say that man I'm getting all this understanding with more understanding I find it easier to compromise I find it easier to accept things that are against God he said no the more I know about you the more I hate every false way verse 113 I hate vain thoughts but thy law do I love so now notice the balance to each I hate I hate in a poor line but thy law do I love so just in these verses alone and there's many other places I am Telling You many other places we could show this these opposites and they how they're working where there's this love for God there's a hatred for things that are not God or against God and so there is this I look at it as sort of this balancing that as you love God that there's there's this it spreads out that the more Your Love Grows for him the the more things in essence that it places in its proper perspective that you view correctly and the things that seem to be further away from him or if God reveals to you one thing the thing that is against that or anti that it changes its tenor when God reveals to you baptism in the name Lord Jesus Christ then baptism and titles changes its character and so as God reveals himself as Christ reveals himself you you see the Antichrist as against the things that you love and so if I could just get scientific for every action there's an equal and opposite reaction so it's not that I've got to go right but in that in my love to Christ creates the opposite uh thrust against the things that are against Christ and so perfect love and perfect hatred are the perfect harmony of God's character it's a balancing act God it couldn't it couldn't be perfect love he couldn't be all love if he didn't have this other dimension of hate it has to be it must be this way even in a prophecy of Christ Psalms 45 7 thou love this righteousness and hadest wickedness remember how Paul I I read I quote the scripture so often I've I think I've actually banned it from being in this series even though it's probably too late but uh Let Your Love be without dissimulation without hypocrisy abhor that which is evil plead to that which is good love requires a discernment of what is Godly what is ungodly and then not just a discernment to say well I know ones of God and one's not but I love them both right I can just I just no I shouldn't hate but no there has to be an abhorrence a detesting a rejecting of that which is evil it says you love righteousness and hate wickedness therefore God thy God hath anointed thee with oil of gladness above thy fellows this is this is the heart of God this is something that pleases God is Not Just To Love good things but also to hate the anti-good if I can say it his love requires hatred through thy precepts I get understanding the more I understand I get the more I hate things that are wrong I hate vain thoughts I hate in a poor line but the law I love you know it's the hate that he has for the vain thoughts the lying the false way the wickedness is not mentioned depart apart from a love for understanding the law in righteousness so love requires hatred but not as a product not as the ultimate not as a a priority only as a consequence I only have hate because of how much I love now let me just drop back and say I say this for the grace that we can have in our own relationships that's the reason why our relationships whether it be a spouse or to children have such intensity you know what I'm talking about because of love that's what creates it two people don't care they're never going to argue right there's not real feelings if there's not something in there that hurts if there's not something in there that feels then it's kind of yeah well whatever I don't even think they're I don't even like them right there's just no will to fight there's no will to work I think I've talked about this before that you know love is what Rises up in the moment sometimes it doesn't say what it should and sometimes it goes sometimes it acts in extreme ways and sometimes it raises its voice and sometimes it gets really really hurt and a lot of other emotions spill in when this damn burst but you know at the end of the day there could be some stepping back and say you know what this may not make a lot of sense but that's a good sign it's a good sign and and I've said this I know I've said this before that when we love somebody that we open ourselves up to the to a uh an equal capacity to be hurt by them and so love hatred exists as a consequence of the law not a product of it necessarily but as a balance a consequence of it and so as we press along further in this very simple thought this evening as we hearken back to what David said about his perfect hatred and another whether you want to take into consideration all these things that we've already mentioned that can are hated in the scripture perfect hatred for an enemy or for somebody else if you want to say there is a perfect hatred and it is towards an object maybe we could say an enemy it exists only in light of a perfect love for God so if I'm saying that hatred is a consequence of loving then perfect hatred can only exist if there's actually perfect love so that means there has to be a loved a lover a loved a love that's being projected and then by consequence a hatred does that make sense that you just can't say that well I mean I I hate infidels and I and I hate homosexuals and I hate Democrats and and I hate people I want to take away our guns and I hate Target and what else do we hate and you have this this energy to hate things and it's like all right and it gets like the mob mentality and you have all this hatred it says all right so what is it you love as you hate Starbucks so much what is it besides Bad Coffee and I'm like oh I never thought about it I'm like maybe you might want to say and stop saying you hate because it's a word that we easily we throw out there quite a bit but there's a hate that is base that is foul that is perverted that is destructive that is harmful that is painful just as that jealousy these jealousy and hate which is it is selfish and it seeks to destroy others to condemn them to shame them and it's this Genesis of this hate that arises from human emotion alone but then this hatred perfect hatred it only exists because there's a counterweight to it Called Love you know it can only go so far because love brother Banner makes this makes the statement I think I quoted it last Wednesday any person any church any organization any individual that reasons against one punctuation of God's word is your enemy and a lot of people say right they love that they like to think just one punctuation buddy your spiritual grammar is off I hate you right you got the calm in the wrong place and that's how they feel about it man if they haven't if they if they don't believe it like this if they don't have it like that there's this this animosity this bitterness it's hostility that they have against people because brother bam says it any person any church any organization any individual that reasons that gets one punctuation of God's word is your enemy and I say Amen but then I find that Jesus says in Luke 6 27 but I say unto you which here not everybody hears love your enemies do good to them which hate you and so it I mean it really does beg the question why it says in Deuteronomy 7 10 and repayeth them that hate him to their face to destroy them he will not be slacked to him that hateth him he'll repay him to his face and yet we're told to love our enemies and do good to them which hate us can I express it in a way that's maybe more paradoxical than saying that love cannot exist without hate but we're to both love and hate anything that's against God um we're to both love and hate anything that's against God but only because our love is first to God let me give you an example and I know that I'm not running out of time this evening but I intentionally had just very uh succinct thought to express to you and so I mean really as hard as it's up to you how early you make it to Culver's by how hard you pull and how responsive you are and how much we feel that we've we've hit the mark but let's use the example of Jonah so Jonah is told to go to Nineveh and to to preach this uh you know condemning this Army's Pole to go and preach and tell them to repent Jonah has and then the the those at Nineveh they're Arch enemies there's these are Fierce People these are people that it's not like Jonah said oh a chance to go visit family and I've always wanted to go see Nineveh it it was one of these things where it's like nah I don't care for him I hate him don't like them let them sin because at least they get what they deserve and God help us if we've ever thought oh I sure hope they don't ever come to the message because I hope it's really hot in Hell whenever they get there but this is how Jonah feels about it Jonah's kind of like hey I don't want to go he runs he finally gives in and even here in a moment we'll see in a slide where John is basically I knew this was going to happen but Jonah and uh chapter 3 says he calls and he says we're not quite there yet but he says yet 40 days and none of us shall be overthrown so there's maybe he's already kind of started he flipped over this gigantic Sandile 40-day Sandile Sun you know Ascend uh what is it called hourglass a 40 a 40 day glass tips this keg over and he's like look when this thing gets to the bottom Nineveh is going to be destroyed and he's kind of like 40 days and you guys are gonna get it right and he's done right he's happy he's delivered the message he feels good and then wait a minute wait a minute what the king repents they can't tell her sackcloth and Ashes this has been a voice this is a voice from God we need to correct ourselves we've done something wrong oh perv Venture that we we let's let's repent let's repent let repent and the whole city does exactly what Jonah's message was to do is they all repent and you would think that Jonah would be like this is wonderful what a Revival what a what a repenting what a purging what a cleansing I had several lengthy scripture readings to bring to you where where Paul in second Corinthians writes back to the Corinthians he says you know what I wasn't happy that I made you sorry but I mean I was happy I made you in a Godly sort you could tell that Paul is saying it wasn't easy for me to write that letter I want to call things out I didn't want to break that brother I didn't want to expose that sister I didn't this wasn't easy to me and I'm so happy you repented oh what Zeal what cleansing see this is what that was any and he's explaining himself in such a way to say this is why sometimes love is cutting this is why Love sometimes is very hard and why it has to do what it does but this didn't come easy to me and Paul's rejoicing in the repentance Paul's not saying man I thought for sure I'd get rid of that guy hey I thought for sure they dig his Hills in and he refused to repent and I'd get rid of him my adversary this enemy but no he comes back and here Jonah the king does exactly uh what Jonah says he must do and he repents and then it says in verse 10 and God solved their works that they turned from their evil way and God repented of the evil that he said that he would do unto them and he did it not wow God's like oh man never mind and this is something that's obviously conveyed to Jonah and as you read the in your Bible you know chapter 3 is going to end but let's just remove the chapters and it says and and God repented of the evil that he said that he would do to unto them and he did it not but it displeased Jonah exceedingly and he was very angry so God God acts Jonah says if you guys don't repent you're going to get it to your face right and leaves and they repent like we don't want it we don't want it in 40 days and God says you know what I Repent I'm sorry I said I was going to destroy you and Jonah finds out about it and it displeased him exceedingly he was very angry verse two he's basically I knew this would happen I knew it that's why I didn't want to go because I knew they would say they were sorry I knew that you were a god of patience and God of kindness that you would be slow to anger and that you would say repent and then they would repent and you would forgive them I wish you were a different kind of God right and then this is how bad it gets for Jonah and you can read the rest of the book because it gets really pitiful for a moment there therefore now oh Lord take I beseech thee my life from me if it is better for me to die than to live this is this is horrible John is so upset that the ninevites the ones he hates these Idol worshipers these mean-spirited people are now turning around and repenting I said I this displeases me I'm not happy about this and he goes so far as I say go ahead and just kill me I do not want to live in a world with an innovite serve you I don't want to live in a world where those that I hate I actually love the thing I love and to find it's the same thing that became a struggle for the Jews in the beginning of the Christian church to accept Gentiles because of prejudice because of bias imagine how hard it would have been for them and I wanted to explore it tonight a little bit how to how they could accept us all you killed Stephen talk about a talk about love and hate colliding but now not necessarily as a balancing but coming Head to Head right like this wrong kind of hatred is surfacing within Jonah and he's saying I I I I I hate him I hate them they hate thee God but now when the when their hatred changes his doesn't right so because perfect hatred if Jonah's hatred had been correct as soon as God's heart turned his heart would have turned now look at Matthew chapter 6 verse 24 with me that I'm going to consider that a foundation and if you're worried like you build a foundation then you build a house and you're worried that this might be some sort of three-story condo just a Pergola tonight all right the only thing that's going up is just a few more you know four corner posts and some trusses and maybe we'll roof it later but Matthew 6 24 no man can serve two masters remember the conclusion of this therefore seek ye first the kingdom of God so it puts one thing as the ultimate no man can serve two masters for heal they hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other there's a lot of wisdom in this if someone has two masters that it creates this competition it creates this manipulation it's Rife for turning and pitting it's the same kind of dynamics that exist in a split home where uh the father and mother are no longer married and they both have a love for their children and children both have a love for their parents and there's some sort of loyalty that they want to have equally for both but yet they hate each other right the father and mother hate each other and maybe it sounds more like we're describing uh the in-laws of the neighbor and the apartment next door but we recognize those Dynamics in a split home where now the children are constantly being torn between and it's such a difficult thing it's just a real logical statement you either hate the one and love the other else he'll hold the one and despise the other you cannot serve God and Mammon it says no no one can serve two masters the word is translated to Lord in other places in the New Testament but to be a master it's he to whom a person belongs that's a about which he has power of deciding so a master means a master of something means something belongs to them and they have power to decide to be a master means the owner the possessor and disposer of a thing one who has control so he says no man can serve two masters you cannot it's almost it's a contradiction in terms that you cannot be under the control of one who has the sole power of deciding and also be under the control of another who has the sole power of deciding it's almost a contradiction of terms it cannot happen and and in the same sense that some people think the terminology Military Intelligence is a paradox uh let this or oxymoronic in this sense two masters is right and listen this isn't rocket surgery I think you could you guys could figure this out that as these as you have a loyalty to one and he demands full obedience you have a loyal to another he demands full obedience he said this is this is not you cannot do this and so if I could back up Godly jealousy when God there's a Godly jealousy it means that God's love does not make room for any other love or lovers there's no other room for it I am a jealous God that means you can only love me and you say oh well that doesn't sound very Godly well that is very Godly you can't have this is the nature of love that you if you love me a jealous God says well then you can't say that you love me and you love this God and you love that God you love this equally this kind of love Demands a loyalty if that's hard for you it's it's what exists within within uh what ought to exist within a marriage where that love is for your wife it's not shared anywhere else that's what's reflected in that Union in that bond that this is not something that's shared this is not something well I love you and I love you and I love you and I love you and you have these Privileges and everyone else has these privileges it speaks the nature of this love speaks of fidelity and it says that this The Godly jealousy means there's no other room for any other lovers any other loaves God must be the owner he must be the sole possessor of our love hey he must be the only one who has control of our heart and so to me that's what perfect love is is when we finally yield it all to him and he's the sole controller of our hearts I would say he has all of your soul if you want to use it in terms that his baptism Holy Ghost has possessed our hearts then the rest is him possessing everything else that exists every door every Spirit every affection having preeminence so perfect love is when all your heart holy and completely is to God Alone every affection everyone every ambition every desire you cannot serve two masters you cannot love two masters requires that you love one and hate the other in James 4 4 ye adulterers and adulteresses know ye not that the Friendship of the world is enmity with God whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God to have some sort of in moderate love or prevailing desire to the world if this is if that's where your loyalties lie whoever is a friend of the world whoever concedes to the world compromises with the world he said you cannot do that and stay loyal to God if your prevailing desire just it's on its face you're saying friendship with the world is enmity with God to to be that kind of friend to have that kind of kinship to have that kind of loyalty to the things of the world and to the fleshes that puts you against God that makes you that that's hatred to God and we've read this in first John 2 15 love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man loved the world the love of the father is not in him I want you to recognize these things as both of them it's it says that friendship with the world when it's the ugly side is its hatred towards God that the more that you align yourself with these things its soils and and muddies and it perverts and it sours Your Love towards God it becomes hatred and animosity towards God because that's just the way love and hate work that's just the way loyalties are you can't you can't serve them both only through love and loyalty to God can we arrive at then this this is a conclusion of this and I realize now I I feel that I've definitely inadequately have conveyed this but in reading this Matthew 6 24 James 4 4 first John 2 15 and if we could maybe take a step back and say there's love for God there's hatred for the world there's friendship with the world and hatred for God and kind of see this uh these different sides and how God's jealousy says you can only have one love I'm a jealous God so that love that you have if it's not to me then it gets it's spread out or it's divided and that becomes a dangerous sore spot for you becomes a point of weakness it's going to breed hatred and animosity towards things that are me or or of me a better for me so then if there if there must be then as I've said perfect hatred only exists in light of God's perfect love that perfect love and perfect hate a perfect love cannot exist without perfect hate it's only through this love this devotion this loyalty Fidelity to God this uh faithfulness to God that we can ever arrive at a true hatred for the world the only way that we can and I know I've already said it but maybe just saying it different way is the only way that we could have that opposite hatred for the world is by having a greater love for God we cannot arrive at perfect hatred or pure hatred or true hatred for sin without first having love and loyalty to God God is Not arming us just to hate sin and he's not just arminess to hate lies and feet that are Swift or mischief and hate those that bear false Witnesses so we're just let the Liars raise their hands heads let them all raise their hand and I'm just going to chop off all the heads of the Liars let somebody speak against this message come on I dare you I dare you to raise up and that's all we're doing is looking for someone's head to cut off let in any any distaste or hatred for anything of lying and anything Antichrist it exists as a consequence of falling in love with God and so we arrive at Luke 14 26. and now this becomes very very heavy in Luke 14 26 If any man come to me and hate not his father and mother and wife and children and Brethren and cisterns Yea and his own life also he cannot be my disciple I can't be his master I can't be his teacher can't be his Lord can't be his controller can't be the one that will lead him God I can't be the one that he's loyal along to if he doesn't hate his mom his dad his wife his children his brothers his sisters that's how it reads right I didn't pull it up from any other translations and I could do it and you know what you know all the things I've read I mean it they've all I mean even some of the modernist they all just kind of go yeah that's what it says hey If any man come to me and hate not his father mother wife children brother and sisters and even himself it can't be my disciple now I'll say the correct interpretation of this is critical what does Christ mean to hate right because he says we should he's saying you're not a good disciple unless you hate your mom hey and some of you are thinking next never knew my dad next right you're thinking I think I'm getting there I think I found perfect love but what does he mean by this what could he mean and now let me say this we may confuse hatred of the world for the love of God in other words we we have hate but we confuse it as love like this is my love for God that's what causes me to hate because we hate something that we think God hates in other words we're trying to align ourselves with David had a perfect hatred God hates Abomination God hates Liars they're nothing but a liar I hate them and we're trying to we're trying to find ourselves in this Niche where this guy this is this is how God feels so this is how I feel this is how God feels so this is how I feel and we're trying to hide behind God with all of our hates so that we're kind of standing behind God says let me Adam right he's a liar yeah you're filthy but we're standing behind God right and it's like yeah he's my protection for all these ways I feel about this person and I would say it's easy to despise someone we disagree with and not only is it easy to despise someone we disagree with but then it's easy to imagine it's because we love God more it's easy to imagine that the reason why I don't love them the reason why I hate them the reason why I don't like them the reason why we don't get along the reason why this the reason why that is because we love God because we love this message because we want to keep it pure we don't want to bring any smut on it we want to be loyal we want to be fierce we're the zealots of this end time we got to keep this message honorable we got to keep it pure and we argue it's the love for God when the real reason for our hate is the decaying of our nature because our Nature's decaying it's easy for us to say oh no no this is this is perfectly what brother Brandon this is perfectly what Christ would do this is what this is what the Bible requires this is this is Godly jealousy this is hating unrighteousness this is righteous indignation and we suppose that it's our love for God when the real reason for our hate is not an increase of Grace but the further degrading of our nature if I could come and arrive at oh the the thrust of this when I read this if any man come to me and hate not his father and mother his wife his children brother and sisters many people do not find it difficult to hate I said it before the hard sayings of Christ are only pure to those who find them hard that if reading this they find it easy you find it easy to relate you find it easy to to step into and say oh yeah oh yeah that makes perfect sense if there if there's somebody who had already written it out says I was wondering when he'd come to this this whole series on perfect love I've had one ending point had one spot to end on it would be this and many may have find it very easy to hate and I realize now as I'm looking at this I don't know French very well I don't know French at all except and I'm going to say this wrong but Francois Marriott maybe that was a little French and Spanish Jesu he wrote a book in 1936 in French I haven't read it it was translated later and I've studied this different portion in chapter nine it's entitled Judas and because it provides these hypothetical thoughts of Judas to the sayings of Christ now that's fascinating isn't it what was Judas thinking when Jesus said these things because we do have one Glimpse where Judas is like oh no we could have sold this sold this or and John's like and he said that because he's a thief right like we hear Judas sounding very honorable very politically correct thinking of the poor that's the real nature of Christ and really John's like no no he's a thief no he he just wants the coin man he's in this for himself and so this hypothetical thoughts of Judas to the Saints of Christ he writes in Matthew chapter 10 verse 21 and I'm using this to kind of amplify Luke 14 26. there says Jesus is saying unless you hate your mom and dad your brother and sister and even yourself you can't be my disciple and so we feel that we have some injunction to hate and Jesus says in 10 Matthew 10 21 and the brother shall deliver up the brother to death and the father of the child and the children shall rise up against their parents and cause them to be put to death mariak says that the other disciples were mortified that when Jesus said this the other disciples found themselves saying what kind of horror is this maybe even beginning to think wait a minute does that mean that my brother will put me to death or I'm going to need to cause my parents to be put to death what is the Messiah gonna what are we going to be compelled to do what are we getting conscripted into and there was there was there were more they were horrified to think that brother is going to deliver his brother to death father the children there's going to be the Civil War causing he put to death and and mariach writes it that these disciples find themselves shocked stunned it's revolting to them but he says not Judas Judas loved it that there was something about Judas where he was something he could take to very easily to where Judas when he heard it was kind of like oh yeah yeah I get that that makes perfect sense that there's something in him that's that took to it I think even C.S Lewis said it put it this way he took to it like water off a duck to water like you mean that I'm going to need to kill my brother sign me up like it was just something inside him and said I'm here I'm all in While others are thinking no no no you have to explain yourself Christy this can't be true and so I I say that to recognize that this is these are hard sayings and there should be some appropriate oh no in ourselves it says if I have to hate my father and my mother and my children my brothers and sisters in order to be his disciple there should be something inside of it says that's difficult that's hard I don't understand this in the same way when the Bible says spoil the rod spoil your child there should be a party that says oh is that then how does that look Lord how how do I apply that not just saying honey let's plant some more branches let's get some more switches up in here no there's there's got to be something inside it says no I surely surely there's got to be something a better way I'm not saying we challenge God or we're questioning God but it can't be that easy like it was for Judas and I'll say many selfish people convince themselves they love God because of their hate there's many selfish people that have convinced themselves they love this message because of their hate that they love the anti of the message because there's plenty of it but they have not they become more anti-anti-christ instead of Christ they recognize religion organize religion in its backside they recognize women are out of their place and they recognize the privity of human nature and they recognize homosexuals are doing this and they recognize governments are doing that and all big brother's doing this and the the Illuminati that and the One World ordered this and they've got all sorts of these conspiracy theories and these ideas and you'll find that what they really love about the message is the anti-side the consequence and not the real love they have the they they they really recognize that anti-anti-christ part it's because they've drawn their sword to everything else but it hasn't been the consequence of falling in love with Christ and there's a lot of people find themselves in this I told you in the beginning that this is what I was going to be looking at this dark side of this perverted love for God and people convinced this is a love for God because I hate because I'm loyal because I'm zealous loyalism loyal yeah lowercase L I apologize didn't mean to call you out so clearly just slipped well now since we all know who we're talking about tonight you know it's true of people right they've convinced themselves they love God because they hate when really their love air quotes love is self-serving and their courage to criticize and to fight and draw their sword is nothing but cowardice go ahead write it down they're quote unquote courage to rail fight to use their Pulpit to bully They Call it Courage they call it being set for the defense of the Gospel but it's nothing but cowardness so then in light of Luke 14 26 Matthew 10 21 is Christ I'm closing I'm coming to my clothes here is Christ the very heart of God the very love of God very God love himself if we could say it that way see asking us to hate in the same terms that we would use of hatred do we resent them do we laugh at them do we mock them do we score on them when they're we we mock them in their Calamity we mock their deception do we enjoy causing them pain I think it begs the question I believe that Christ is clarifying even more distinctly to us when he says if any man come to me and hate not his father and his mother if any man will not do that he's not worthy to be my disciple I believe he's clarifying more distinctly what it means to love God when he asks us to hate and not just merely asking us to hate it assumes some loyalty there's a presupposition that if you love me and you want to be my disciple then the hatred that he proposes here is to Simply reject any influence that calls you away from Christ I mean I I just feel like you can't you can't say that Christ is demanding that we hate in the same way that we hate in our human nature and that you can't say that he's saying love God and that this is this is something organic that Springs forth from itself and then he says and over here make sure you have a really healthy and robust hate tree right it's not it's not just a separate Garden it's not a separate attribute it's it's this the hatred that he's proposing is that we must reject any influence that calls us away from Christ because you cannot serve both one must be the priority one must be the absolute one must be the main thing so we must reject we must deny even the most the things that are the most precious to us he does not just say hey if you don't hate your hobbies if you don't hate your favorite sport if you don't hate your favorite Mexican food if you it's not that he just kind of picks things and say well you got to hate the desert we're kind of like oh we're in no I mean he picks the things in the heart that should be the hardest to hate he's not just saying that well if you got to hate you got to hate the Redskins and they don't even exist anymore you're gonna hate this you gotta hate that it's it's not that it's not rivalry it's not Petty things but then you must deny even the things that are most precious to you if they come between you and your love for God anything that steps in the way you got to say out of the way anything that tries to usurp his first place you got to get out of the way anything that tries to replace him is your first love you got to get out of the way no matter who it is whether it's your mom your dad your wife your husband right he's saying it doesn't matter and he takes those things that are closest to your heart did you have the greatest Affinity to you say it to a Jew to her bloodline family meant everything and Jesus knows I hope you can catch this part Jesus knows that it'll look and feel like hatred to them that you do that to because love is so easily misunderstood of Christ was that to put Christ first as somebody else's expense well to them feel like hatred to them will feel like rejection is that not so maybe we've been on the other side of it at some time and we felt that it was very blunt and very hard and very hurtful but then when we realized that this was because the love of God we find that love is so easily misunderstood so Jesus puts it in a language so that we can understand what it they'll feel in what it may look like because to them that's exactly how it feels it feels like hatred I heard the huh Matthew 10 34. not that this will resolve the huh but it's going to be one of my last scriptures to read to you tonight to again see so starkly how Christ is Raising this could we not see the image of a jealous God a hating God a vengeful God is going to repay there's this nature in this character of God I hope it's I hope I I think I've said things just feeling that I've got um I've got an audience that's connecting these things too that are that are deeper than just what I'm saying in terms of even how people try to characterize this message and use this message and you find it's been detached from the love of God doesn't have that other side to it it doesn't have the love anymore so now it's just a caudulent it's just a bully pulpit just beating people up it's just beating things up it's like where's the other side do it and that's where we become the thief and the parable of the Good Samaritan we're just robbing people we're just stripping them we're just leaving them half dead in Matthew 10 34-37 think not that I'm come to send peace on Earth so what were the angels singing on that day when you were born I like it was that kind of Cryptid cryptic like we welcome peace come on and Jesus kind of stand out there behind the corner like are they coming watch this all right he says but don't think I've come to send peace on Earth obviously that speaks to kind of the misconception of the Kingdom at the time I come not to send peace but a sword for I am come to set a man at variance against his father and the daughter against her mother and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law and and why does it not say the son-in-law against the mother-in-law assumed I've come to I have a wonderful mother-in-law by the way I know she doesn't stream but uh wonderful in-laws said a man at variance against his father and the daughter against her mother and the daughter-in-law against her mother this is what happens this is this is Christ says I come to bring I'm not coming to bring everyone together and Kumbaya and peace I come to sin I don't come to sin peace but a sword now it's painting quite the picture maybe even instinctively we like to drill down on that and kind of get real heavy and underline that part of it and then he goes in further a man's foe shall be they of his own household this is this is difficult this is conflict this is gut-wrenching this is this is horrible and maybe again as it's in Matthew chapter 10. and I didn't read further in what Marriott says about Judas in this particular instance but maybe at this point the disciples are going oh oh and Judas is over there going sharpening his sword okay all right I like where this is going and this seems easy to him and then he says this and I think this kind of becomes that clarifying part he that loveth father a mother more than me is not worthy of me he that loved that son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me in other words these things cannot stand in competition to Christ therefore we must be willing to reject and renounce even those things that are the most precious to us if they interfere with our love for God we must be willing to act as though we hated them that's what he's saying they interfere with my love to God if they interfere with my keeping his Commandments if they interfere with my uh my convictions towards the word of God and I know this may take on a different this sound to some people a different look but in its most simple terms if they interfere with me loving God and keeping his Commandments then I must be willing to act as though I hated them when our love compels our love to him compels us to act a certain way when our love for him is driving us it's love I must give vent to my Revelation I must love him I I must be I express this I must do these things for him we cannot let human emotions deter us because it's in those moments where maybe the human affinity is the human emotions what causes I I find that even it becomes one of the biggest mistakes we make in parenting is in our love for our children we'll we'll let down on the word of God and the standard right we'll let it down for the sake of not wanting to do this to him not wanting to do that to him when in reality that's the wrong kind of love that you don't really love them you you that's the that's it's a it's a perverted love not perfect love because anything that would get in the way of loving God you must be willing to act as though you hate it our emotions can easily deceive us especially when it comes to love we have her spouse and for family for friends and so when the word compels us he said you must be willing to because if you love father mother more than me you're not worthy if you love son or daughter more than me you're not worthy then I must occupy that Soul place and since our emotions I must finish with this our emotions can deceive us it's hard to know when the duty to hate arises and I would hope that we find it hard to find to know when that duty to hate arises and I will say those that truly love God will not arrive early at hate nor will they gladly embrace the sword Jesus I come not to bring peace I come I I come to bring a sword I say if we truly love God we won't arrive easily at the at that sword we have the sword it's at our disposal but if we truly love God we're not always going right first response first thing we do right somebody crosses us we're just over there like a Peter prior to his birth where's the ear I'm going to cut off and it's almost instinct if we truly love God that's not our default in Philippians 3 18 Paul writing says from any walk of whom I've told you often and now tell you even weeping that they are the enemies of the Cross of Christ Paul's saying this isn't easy for me to say and if I've named names if I've corrected anyone if I'm calling out the Antichrist I don't do it with Glee I'm not giddy about it I I say it even now weeping that an enemy to Christ it it Sorrows me he said I wouldn't all Israel would be saved it's not something that he could that he arrived he arrived at that conclusion that they those that I'm talking about they're enemies of Christ and being enemies of Christ I I must detest them I must stand against them I must hate the sin I I can't have be in League with them I can't have friendship with them he recognized the loss and so those of us who truly love God will not arrive early at this kind of hate it I no man can serve two masters he'll either hate one or love the other so if any man come to me and hate not his father mother wife children brothers and sisters or his own life he cannot be my disciple that hate that hate I hope for you is not something easily grasped but selfish abusive people will quickly grab the sword and easily hate I'll close by saying there's many women who convince themselves that they loved God and they love the message by abandoning their husbands they do it in the name of the message they do it because of their loyalties to the message and they convince themselves that they love God by hating their husbands men will convince themselves that divorce and separation declared loyalty and dedication to God is this the wrong note to end on I'm not saying all men I'm not saying all women but there's those that do it and they blame God for their hate and if they did an autopsy on it they'd find the love of God was never in it and so I'll say this you'll never arrive at perfect love through hating you'll never do it you'll never arrive at a greater obedience you'll never arrive at a greater understanding you'll never arrive at a greater Harmony in unity with God and one another through hate but only by Falling in Love More that's the only way you can do it and in loving more I trust that hate will find its place The Stand Together musicians please come
