TRANSCRIPT
========================================
my title today uh the subtitle on this part nine is the promise of wholeness the promise of wholeness and we'll uh kind of get into in a deeper way just exactly um what that means but i'd say maybe for a thesis statement that our um we're wanting to focus our faith we've been talking about faith even in the promise of healing we know it's by faith but focus kind of on this focus our faith on the promise to be made whole you'll find a number of scriptures where it speaks of jesus when he healed somebody says and they were made whole been reading through those and looking at them and as a part of this in terms of our healing and maybe being used in that phrase to be made whole i'm wanting to begin to look at things that hinder our healing i recognize that a lot of us are we understand the promise of healing we understand and believe divine healing so sometimes it's not really just getting to the bottom of what it is and how it happens but really some of the things that keep us from it and what i'd like to be able to identify today is how that divine healing is more than just healing of the body and since divine healing is more than just the healing of the physical body i i begin to recognize that it may be that our physical healing is found in recognizing just where the divine healing resides and where it's the most significant and that begins to move barriers and one thing that we'll definitely be touching on is how that divine healing is not just for this this physical body that can see and taste and feel but also our spirits and our minds our hearts as it were now john chapter five we'll start with verse one we're just going to walk through this i'm recognizing today that it seems to be much hotter than it normally is i even just checked to make sure the air conditioner was working if we just get too comfortable we'll just stop we we know we always have a time to pick pick this up later i wouldn't want to just keep driving this home and all of a sudden we all just are on the other other dimension and we all died of heat stroke because i didn't know when to stop and i'd say well this is where we wanted to be after all right but uh we'll just be real sensitive to um the uh the heat today john chapter five verse one if we'll start here and we'll just we'll just be kicking this off it says after this there was a feast of the jews and jesus went up to jerusalem now there is at jerusalem by the sheep market a pool which is called in the hebrew tongue bethesda so to say call this a sheep market it's going to stay here having five porches in the hebrew tongue bethesda having five porches this points to a very specific location that they say here he calls it the house of mercy bethesda it's called the house of mercy in these or in this area in these lay a great multitude of impotent folk of blind halt withered waiting for the moving of the water so because this was the during the time of the feast of the jews then there may have been a lot more that were there during this time it was very crowded it's very near roman garrison where soldiers um stayed so there might have been even just gentiles there present to witness the phenomena or maybe even themselves partake in it and john describes it this way and it says for an angel went down at a certain season into the pool and troubled the water whosoever then first after the trouble of the water stepped in was made a hole of whatsoever disease he had now when we read this and maybe we haven't taken time just to consider what exactly may have been happening or what a remarkable occurrence this was for these things to take place but this would be activity that we would call paranormal this is beyond the scope of normal scientific understanding to be able to explain why there was a certain moment when the waters would be stirred and that someone the first one to step in would be made whole now science can no doubt look at this and say what it might have been a spring that fed it and so it was kind of intimate that it would bubble up and stir and they might even say that it was maybe there was some valves or something that they were using in the bath house or using at the roman garrison and when these things were opened or maybe even it was done intentionally uh by a priest of some sort of false religion that would cause it to to boil up and bubble up but then even once we explained that you wouldn't really wouldn't be able to explain uh adequately through science why the first person in was healed and nobody else and because of some of these uh notations in this part about the sheep market and the pool called bethesda and five porches and the bar the stirring or the troubling of the water and the healing of the individual this is actually a very controversial story not among us but among academics and scholars and even bible scholars and even the critics john is the only one that records it and there's much criticism about many of the elements of this and i had originally began to kind of build some things i'd been studying on uh here at the at this point but i think we can just circle right back to it and i want to come back to this particular element when we talk about healing cults i think that'll get all of you thinking um thinking very uh concerned because there's a lot of healing cults that are out there and so there's a lot of scholarship uh debating the merit of these this pool and whether the pool actually had healing powers or even if it even had any jewish connection there's a lot of arguments that say that this was um this was a pool that was kind of dedicated to a false deity and so it was a false religion that was using this pool for healing powers and one of the writers wrote this said these practices this practice of going into the pool of water to be healed uh are not well attested in jewish sources which commonly connected healing with prayer to god and so the prayer to god was the primary way you beseech the lord that's how abraham did it for abimelech you beseech the lord and you receive your healing saying these these kind of practices where there might be some sort of supernatural bubbling up of the water an angel stirring the water and someone jumping in it to be healed that's not commonly associated to or even attested by jews and rabbis and jewish sources they say the god of israel did not reserve his favor for those who are best able to help themselves and so in this story it's kind of one of these situations where the first one in is the one that got the favor so they're saying that within jewish tradition the elements here don't necessarily fit but brother branham touches on this story in several places in one particular place where he's speaking earnestly continuing for the faith that was once delivered unto the saints he's preaching this in germany he says now a lot of aristocrats say they're crazy that's no angel but god was healing anyhow and it's this part i think is very important for us to catch god has always had a place of healing since he's been god and man's been man that's right there's always been a preparation for healing since genesis when he raised the brass serpent they started worshiping that he tore that down then he sent an angel on a pool of water and the history says it was terrible i've been reading through a lot of different um books that brother branham read books in his library trying to find where he may have gathered this from but he refers to in a few places how that people would cut one another and fight and stab and maim one another as they're trying to get into the pool so they have this faith to believe that an angel of the lord is stirring the waters but then and they want their healing and they're willing to kill to get it tells you something about this kind of insatiable fanaticism for only the physical part can lead to a lot of craziness and and a lot of behaviors and a lot of thought processes that aren't christ-like that's something to hold in your mind and so brethren touches on that in other places and i will say this even as brother brahms describing it here the method or the means by which a person was healed may seem odd to an angel to visit stir the waters and the first person in it is one that's healed but we know it's god alone that heals that even medicine can't heal no man is a healer there's a lot of ways we could keep uh enforcing that but if there were some means by which somebody had faith to believe that it get in this water they were going to be healed it's god who has designed it that way that a person would be healed and sirs we would see jesus he says ever who's stepping in first got healed of what disease they had they had faith to believe it many criticized it make fun of it but the bible said it was an angel and i believe it god always makes a way so this be to me no matter how much you would research how much you would study no matter which debate uh in uh within the nominal christian world and theologians about well this wasn't in the original and this seems really odd we don't even know what the sheep market is we don't know about this we don't know about that brother adam says it's in the bible i believe it and he's saying he's emphasizing god always makes a way in other words this may seem strange and odd that troubled waters would turn would cause someone to be healed but that wouldn't be odd to us for as christians because god's a healer and god makes a way and so god brother iran says in other places god has always had a way of healing for believers now no matter when how you look at that way whether you're looking in the old testament looking in the new testament or even looking now that way is always pointing to christ the serpent lifted up in the wilderness speaking of the son of man being lifted up and lifted up on a pole christ being lifted up on a tree so there's a lot of things in the old testament that pointed to christ and there's things in the new testament that are in this way pointing back to christ but remember it all points back to the word it's all pointing back to christ even in revelations chapter 22 verse 2. it speaks of how the tree of life is going to be there bearing 12 manner of fruits and the fruit and the leaves of that tree were for the healing of the nations so even in that phrasing whatever it might be actually not just in simple form but in practical application it's the leaves of the tree of life that are for the healing of the nations in other words god always provides a way for healing and whatever means he provides if it's god providing it it all points back to the word it all points back to christ he sent his word and healed their diseases so it's oh wow it's the brass serpent that's what healed them no god said for moses to do it and if they looked on it then they would be healed so it's not the elements of brass or the image of a serpent but it's the word of god behind that image that brought the promise or that brought the healing and so there's always been a way now this scripture to me is one of the most central to our belief in divine healing first peter chapter 2 verse 24 who his own self bear our sins and his own body on the tree that we being dead to sins should live unto righteousness by whose stripes ye were healed love how he puts it in that past tense again for us his own self christ bore our sins in his own body on the tree that now we being dead to sin so there has to be some way that we are made dead to sin should live for the purpose of righteousness and then by whose stripes ye were healed this is the promise of healing to the believer and whatever that encompasses this is god's promise so now as peter writes it that through this sacrifice he's made a way for us that we might be dead to sins live unto righteousness by whose stripes we are healed that means now divine healing is not limited to a place it's not limited to a pool outside the sheep market it's not limited to cycles of visitation it is now available in christ ever since the price was paid christ shedding his blood him being resurrected the spirit being sent back from that moment on healing is available through christ brother bradman the sermon behold a greater than solomon is here says if something tells you tonight i believe there's a fountain for healing somewhere god's signal ringing get in right quick now he's not referring to a physical pull he's saying if there's something in your heart telling you that there's been a spiritual fountain opened up that you can be bathed in and being bathed and it received healing he says get in right quick the water's already troubled all you have to do is step right in now he's not referring to the dynamics of that particular service that the an angel visited and stirred the waters but is referring to a fountain being opened up to the believer where the waters are troubled and he says it's all ready all you have to do is step in when did it get troubled brother branham 1900 years ago on calvary the trouble and then on the day of pentecost it really shook the whole thing it really got troubled then now all you have to do is step right into the waters of the spirit and get healed you recognize this now all you have to do is step in there's no place in israel there's no place in america there's no place in africa there's no particular place that we all have to gather we don't have to be every easter in jeffersonville to get our healing it doesn't have to be some cycle of revival but now the waters are stirred now you by faith can step in and receive your healing the bible uh speaks of this because now we have a high priest who can be touched by the feeling of our sicknesses our diseases our weaknesses our feebleness of health in acts chapter 5 i'm going to reference this very quickly just i i feel very sensitive to your discomfort today but in acts chapter 5 verses 12 to 16 this is just to look at how god provides a way but the way is always christ and as odd as it may seem to dip yourself in a pool that's kind of getting wavy or bubbling up it says in acts chapter 5 verses 12 to 16 that by the hands of the apostles there were many signs and wonders done among the people and then they're all gathered in one accord at solomon's porch and the rest durst no man joined himself to them but the people magnified them so now the believers are congregating together and the believers were the more added to the lord multitudes both the men and women in so much that they brought forth the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and couches that the least the shadow that at the least the shadow of peter passing by might overshadow some of them so they were such signs and wonders being done that people were laying the diseased in the way so that the shadow of a believer passing over them would bring them healing and this being attested to and believed that the shadow of peter healed many he says there came also multitudes out of the cities round about under jerusalem bringing sick folks and them which were vexed with unclean spirits and they were healed everyone amen by what the power of christ peter says this isn't by my power it wasn't by their own ability it wasn't necessarily the shadow but by faith in the finished work and the faith that was being lifted up by the lives of these believers in acts chapter 19 verses 11 and 12 and god wrought special miracles by the hands of paul so that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs are aprons and the diseases departed from them and the evil spirits went out of them it may seem odd to take a prayer cloth that may seem odd to take something that's been prayed over but yet this is something that god allows to be memorialized in scripture and they were taking things that had been anointed by or wore or associated with paul and god is using this and their faith in it to cause the diseases to part from people to depart from people and evil spirits to go out of them this kind of circles back to this odd element of a pull being stirred and bringing healing but yet we see a pattern that god can use whatever he wants but then it ought to be god that gets the glory it didn't it didn't start a cult of just shadow healing it doesn't start a cult of only handkerchief healing but just ways that god healed now picking back up in john chapter 5 verse 5 and a certain man was there this is now with that background of the waters being troubled there's a man there who wants to be healed that's why he is there which had an infirmity 30 and eight years when jesus saw him lie and knew so he's laying there and knew that he had been now a long time in that case he said to him now there's no this is there's no prompting jesus is taking his own initiative will thou be made whole i'd like to come back to that phrase will that be made whole it says the impotent man inside impotent means to be weak to be feeble to be powerless it means to be sick he was he was sick he answered him sir i have no man when the water is troubled to put me into the pool but while i'm coming another step down before me now notice how he says sir a lot of places in the interactions that jesus has with jews and even gentiles there's a lord master rabbi there's ways that they refer to him here it's just a simple sir we find from reading further that he didn't know who was standing before him he didn't know who was actually asking and if you could if you could let this kind of resonate with you and i don't want to take time to amplify it today but this really identifies the stubbornness of god's grace that this person didn't even know who he was wasn't even wanting someone like kim to heal him but god shows up to heal him anyways and without him still as yet knowing that he can be healed as we read this he just says will you behold and he gives them all his objections but god heals them anyways that speaks something to me that tells me something about god when he has a when there's an election where there's a motive on his part where he wants to do something he's going to do it and you're not going to get any credit for it so he asked him will not be made whole to be made whole this is where this word uh the promise of wholeness was coming to me it means to be sound if someone is sound it's of a mine a man who or person who's sound in body uh sound in mind there's some sort of wholeness that means to will that be made whole we do you want your body to be restored back to its condition of wellness do you want to be restored to health now in jeremiah chapter 19 verse 11 i'm gonna have to look at this in a way that i can maybe cut some things out today for your own sake but it says in jeremiah chapter 19 verse 11 i want to use this to kind of look at this word whole will you be made a whole this is a maybe an odd scripture just to pull out but it says and thou shalt say unto them and shout thou and shalt say unto them thus saith the lord of host even so will i break this people in this city as one breaketh the potter's vessel that cannot be made whole again and they shall bury them and tough it there will be till there be no place to bury quite a message of judgment we somehow break into people in a city like one breaking a piece of pottery and when a piece of pottery is broken they know that it would be impossible to restore it back to a pristine perfect unbroken condition that maybe if you broke it in a few enough pieces and had everything there that maybe you could glue it back together but the strength would be compromised visually you wouldn't be able to repair it it's unable it could not be made whole again that word whole there is rafa could not be made rafa again which is healed could not be made back brought back to its original condition and so when it's speaking this it says if you break a potter's vessel it cannot be made healed again brokenness is what sickness is any kind of sickness or disease is there's a breach in uh what to a person when they're sick whatever it is whether it be bacterial be a virus whether it be some sort of disease or a cut or break there's some sort of breach in the wholeness and the completeness of that person's body and really they find that if you've been cut it may heal but it's never like it was originally it's never healed back pristine no matter what it is there's always going to be some compromise there in that wound or that search or whatever it is that tried to fix it they even say you say well uh you know if you're ever sick you say well can the body ever come back to exactly the way it was before with a lot of these illnesses you if you've been sick before there's some record in your body there might be the case with everything there might finally be able to develop a test and say well look at this you've had 467 colds this year no in your lifetime they might be able to look at white blood cells and do some tests and find that there's always a marker in your body just like with heart attacks they can look at your heart and say at some point in your life you had a heart attack well how do you know the heart bears the record and so this is the idea of being sick there's some wound or breach and the bible is saying that once there's been a brokenness who can ever be made whole again to be made whole implies that everything the sickness caused is reversed i mean that's what that's what you would want right if we said that while i had i had something and and and it was and it was healed it was made whole well something may have been taken away a symptom may have been taken away but to be made whole means everything that was caused is reversed or abolished now i'm gonna i'm gonna skip some things here in jeremiah jeremiah 33 jeremiah 8 jeremiah 30. he's talking about bringing health and cure to be perfectly sound and whole and it's answering to the question of is there any balm in gilead is there not a physician here and so there's a theme in jeremiah that we're just wanting to skip through today uh again so we could come to the real real heart of where my burden's at i noticed it's starting to cool off a little bit so i don't know if brother judah did some technician there or something like that got something working but it feels feels like it's cooling off a little bit i don't know how long it'll last so i'm going to preach as fast as i can so we can get through this but as he says i will bring health and cure i'm going to bring make you perfectly sound and whole why because there is a balm in gilead there is a physician there is a way that the health can be recovered i will restore health under thee i will heal thee of thy wounds he says in jeremiah so christ is that physician that jeremiah speaks of his atoning blood is the balm or the medicine for souls that are sick and for bodies that are not well that's that's what christ is we have no other source we have no other remedy now this to me is for me personally the most outstanding scripture on the wholeness first thessalonians chapter 5 verses 23 to 24 and it says the very god of peace sanctify you holy and i pray god your whole spirit and whole soul and whole body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our lord jesus christ faithful is he that calleth you who also will do it paul is requesting that the power the peace of god would sanctify you holy which means perfect sanctify you perfectly complete in all respects and what i'm wanting to really emphasize today is how that this just how complete and full god intends this to be we could think well if i could just have one thing it would be that i don't wake up with arthritis in the morning if i could just have one thing it'd be that i could eat whatever i want and not gain weight and we could be very uh i don't even want to say one dimensional but very singular about what it would mean to us to experience something tremendous but god is saying paul is writing a way that god intends that his power would holy sanctify you and i pray that your whole spirit whole soul and whole body would be preserved blameless he's using a language to say that i want you to be entirely complete there'd be no part wanting whether body spirit or soul that nothing would be lacking and paul's you know using a language that brings your entire being into view whether you can see it or not not just oh i pray that god would always heal your physical body but that god would also make your mind or your spirit complete and that god also would preserve your soul blameless unto the coming of the lord he was saying i want everything body spirit and soul to be perfectly in harmony and let the person be whole everything working together so that you as an individual can be sound amen i i know that we can relate to this everything working together so that you as an individual can fee to can be whole is there not times in our lives when everything feels great physically but we're just not quite there emotionally ever had times when you just felt like you're on top of the world emotionally but you're broken physically there are times where maybe you feel great physically and you feel great in your emotions but you know something's troubling you in your soul you say that's what this means is there can be all these different parts afflicted and paul saying listen my prayer for you is not that we were just like well thank god i'm saved and that everything else is a complete wreck and there's no peace in your hearts and there's no wellness in your body i'm praying that the entire person would be sound would be at rest would be complete and isaiah chapter 53 verses 4 and 5 recognize just how complete this promise was surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows where is this going to be where's our grief and sorrow we we carry that primarily within our the realm of human emotions and human spirit but he has borne our griefs carried our sorrows yet we did a steam stricken smitten of god and afflicted now verse five but he was wounded for our transgressions and bruised for our iniquities and the chastisement of our peace was upon him where is that that's the condition of the soul so there is there is a remedy for our spirits there is a remedy for our souls and then with his stripes we are healed in other words the atonement covers it all whether it be soul spirit or body there is a wholeness that comes into view at the promise of this sacrifice that through this sacrifice it'll bear your griefs and sorrows it's there for your spirits and for your minds it is there for the transgressions and iniquities that are upon the soul that place you in the position of god's wrath and that's what the chastisement of our peace the price for our peace with god the peace in our souls is paid by this and by his stripes we are healed there's no need that the atonement does not meet and soul spirit and body to be preserved blameless means to undo anything wrong so that there is no fault paul's prayer is that you may be holy entirely perfectly in spirit soul and body preserve blameless in other words let the power of god's word make it be that there is no fault found in soul spirit or body to remove anything wrong with you to heal anything wrong in you that's what it speaks of now i'll read this we may come back to this wednesday night and in the sermon and knoweth it not says there's three rings three circles and i was gonna maybe put this in a slide for you but we'll save it for wednesday night and that's gonna make sure everyone comes back wednesday night so they can see the slide he said that's you this person this this rings you have the outering of the body you have the ring of the spirit and you have that inner part the soul he says that's you that's god god of the trinity is one and without a trinity he's not god he can't be manifested any other way and neither can you be manifested without being the trinity person that you are that's body spirit soul this statement's important without either one of them you are not complete without a body you're not complete without spirit you're not complete without a soul you're not complete you're not whole unless you have all three of these things if you didn't have a soul you'd be nothing if you didn't have a spirit you wouldn't be nothing you didn't have a body you'd be a just a spirit not a body well brother branham is identifying and instead of just taking this oh if one of these is missing then i wouldn't be complete if something's wrong with any one of these you're not complete you may have each one of these elements and oh i've got all three elements but from the position that paul approaches it that you have a spirit you have a you have a body you have a spirit you have a soul that's from out working in if you work from the in out it's soul spirit body in those three rings brethren says without any one of those you're not a person so if god desires that you as a person would be whole then it speaks to the wholeness of body spirit and soul and not just a well body all the days of your life in a troubled mind or a well body and a well-mind and a troubled soul it speaks to soul spirit and body being whole and so the promise of healing in the atonement relates to the full redemption of soul spirit and body the promise of wholeness it's the promise of soundness i think you're having a sound mind a sound body a sound soul it's completeness if any one of them is out of kilter you're not whole so it's talking about continuity again i think this is where we can fellowship in this a little bit we can all tell our own stories of how that we know when something's not right even in our physical bodies we know when some something just doesn't feel right so it's a in the physical part there's one member that's just a little bit out of joint or painful and how that works to make you feel well this isn't right so the rest isn't right isn't that the way some of us think that the way it is now is the way that it's always been and the way that it'll always will be and there's times when we're sick and we can't remember what it was like to not be sick and it's really hard for us to remember what it's going to be like when we're not sick or there's been pain that we've lived with our whole lives or something we've always just been dealing with and we've dealt with it so long we don't know what it's like to be without that and so we kind of approach it with every day well this is just how it is and you're just not able to compartmentalize and say well uh why don't why your back's not hurting you know is it fine no i just kind of i've just cut that part out you know that part doesn't bother me anymore no if it's wherever it is if one part of the body suffers the bible says every part does and so to have wholeness is there some sort of harmony and union and and there's some sort of togetherness and that would mean just with respect to all the elements of your physical body all the elements of your spirit and that of your soul but then also soul spirit and body also together being harmonized in the union of all parts now i want to focus on this part today on redemption or so the atonement healing in the atonement speaks of redemption of the entire person so let's look at the soul for a while salvation which is to be saved and i know that there's a a word that is used regarding saved that we could kind of use as this i don't know it's just it's man's invention really just to try to categorize people saved but not saved is really what it is right because it's like oh they're saved from what absolutely nothing until it's all sorted out before white throne judgment right when they're actually judged according to their works and get in another way so there's a category that we use to talk about people who've made professions who believe that they're saved and even to maybe categorize people for the sake of of numbers when we pass out bibles and have people read the sinner's prayer and but that's not what the bible speaks of salvation true and complete is to be saved and that is the permanent healing of your soul to be saved is the permanent healing of your soul your body can get healed you can get sick and get well you can be sick be healed to get sick again but if the soul is ever saved it never gets sin thick again now this is i want to zero in on this and kind of uh may hopefully magnify some things today because i believe this is an important element to receive physical healing if this was a a mixed congregation today where we were having a convention and people were invited from all over the valley and there's people from different denominations and out of the world and there's people from all over that were here that maybe we could preach on divine heal and in such a way that would kind of cast the net and get people to believe in that moment to receive their healing but i know i'm standing before not rookies but veteran believers of the message of the hour people who've had an experience with god and find yet through all their experiences and all the power that they've witnessed that in the time that they've spent in the word of god it seems as if miracles are further out of a reach now than they were the day in the early days of your salvation so what we're wanting to come back to is what those early days meant and go back to just how real that was because that's what we tend to lose connection with the most important thing and we're living out here on our own thinking it's our shadow that's going to heal somebody when peter was so closely connected with the power of christ it was so vivid what he had done on the day of pentecost that peter was never going to be mistaken by his shadow having the power to heal so this important element to receive your the healing of your body is to look at this permanent healing of our souls so the new birth we could say in this way and i think this is where there's a lot of connection to where we want to be on wednesday night is it changes the nature of the soul or the soul is regenerated to newness of life eternal life it is the perfecting of the soul when you're baptized with the holy ghost it resolves the sin question there's no more sin allocated to your soul it's no longer the judge it's no longer under the uh the penalty of death guarantees you the resurrection and therefore there is this permanence that relates to when that soul is sealed it is permanently healed brother braham says come see come out salvation come see the greatest miracle of all christ to change the sinner's heart that's the greatest remember this that's the greatest miracle of all second corinthians 5 17 therefore if any man be in christ he's a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new this is no small thing i know it maybe have some kind of mystical quality to it and it seems like by one spear we're all baptized into one body and we realize that that baptism is not even the water baptism it's a spiritual baptism that body we can't necessarily put our hands on it and there's people that we thought for sure were part of it and they're no longer part of it and so there's a way that we just kind of think well this is just kind of in the ether somewhere but this is very real and it's no small thing that when a person's soul is changed they become a new creature remember in the ecstasy or the augmented reality old things are passed away all things become new because now there's an entirely new life that's in the control tower of the person and it has a way of viewing everything differently than ever could have been viewed before by you so that all things becoming new is speaking about this unfolding process of the life that is in you all things are becoming new by the newness that is in that spirit the newness of life bill abraham said it's the greatest miracle that ever happened when a man or woman is born again of the spirit of god and becomes a new creature in christ jesus what is it it's that word birth that seals our souls this is the greatest healing and we need to i think it's very very important that we recognize this that if your soul is sealed that is the greatest miracle and that we we we need to recognize this and there needs to be some embracing of it laying a hole when the bible talks about laying hold of eternal life we could get in our minds and this is kind of the this is the leaven that's associated with the wrong kind of teaching when it comes to salvation uh i think there's a phrase within kind of upc or pentecost assembly of gods that once saved always saved is a man-made doctrine and and i would maybe agree with them if it's the once saved always saved the little s and the reason why they hold to that is because they believe that speaking in tongues is the evidence of the holy ghost and that very one who spoke in tongues and had the holy ghost can go right out and say you guys are a bunch of devils and i'm gonna i'm gonna go do this i'm gonna go do that they're like they lost it right so the dominoes started falling with the wrong uh evidence of the holy ghost and so there's a way that we teach what saved is and this sense that well i have eternal life and you're saved and you have eternal life and and you're part of the body of christ you're a son or daughter of god you are saved but now you got to prove yourself to become bride material which the holy ghost is going to make you right it's kind of the way that it can be taught well that's just not how it is at all otherwise you have genuine sons and daughters of god who possess eternal life who don't go in the resurrection or the rapture left over for tribulation have to stand before white judgment and god's like so sorry how did i miss you sorry sorry you had eternal life and you had to go through all that i tell you what we'll upgrade you i'll give you one more night free how's that how about a couple bottles of water will that take care of your problem serve the tribulation that's not how it works if you are saved you have eternal life now to lay hold of eternal life is to become intimately familiar with what you have and to never let go of the greatest miracle of all the soul to be changed for a person be changed that is the greatest miracle and the sermon fellowship brother bam says the greatest miracle ever performed when god can take something and convert it and bring it back to itself again just the same as you could take an animal by science and drop a little drop of water on top of a hog and make it a lamb i i you know science is pretty phenomenal and it wouldn't surprise me if they came up with some potion that would make a pig look like a lamb right and just drop drop look what we've done but he says now that's the greatest miracle of it changes whole nature appetites attitudes everything that's what god does when he saves a man from sin he changes his entire makeup so greater miracle than any part of divine healing that i've ever seen and brother braham says and i by the grace of god i've seen pretty near everything that i could ever think of and hear of done by our lord jesus even the raisin of the dead after they were gone so this is this is pretty valid if you ask some of us and say well what's the greatest miracle you've ever seen you're kind of like well the only one me right that may be true for some of us the only miracle we may know is this what he's talking about or we may have seen somebody else heal but brother branham's got quite the testimony of how the power of god and he says the greatest miracle he's ever seen even beyond raising the dead i still think that salvation is the greatest miracle so if you take all the divine healings that ever were in the world and weighed them they cannot by quantity ever out qualify the salvation of even one soul he's saying this is the greatest miracle of all and i say it's not even close it's not like the greatest miracle you know it's got 59 votes for uh number one and there's three votes for number two it's it's not even close you couldn't even do it top ten it's all salvation of the soul it's it's the list there's nothing else outside of it it's the greatest miracle of all even took the greatest gift outside of this it's not even divine healing right so i want to i want to say this because this kind of forms this hoping this word can kind of hit these things that hinder our healing if the greatest miracle god ever did is the salvation of the soul then we ought to never let sickness discourage us should never let physical seal sickness no matter how bad the diagnosis may be or the prognosis be uh well this is permanent death or this is going to be death and it's it's a stage four and you're there's no hope for you that's why i think i've encouraged it before if there's something wrong or there's a symptom don't google it because we know how it ends you can scroll forever but the last line is always you have cancer you're going to die that that's what everything ends in is cancer and death and so no matter what it is we should never let symptoms sickness circumstances diagnosis uh the the prospects of life for the quality of life as we near near the termination of our life we should never let that overwhelm the glory in our soul that there ought to be something radiating so brilliantly from our souls that no matter what the condition may be of body and mind there's just something about that that hey i'm laying hold of eternal life and this overshadows all the suffering i could ever have in my mind and body the glory of the in my soul is going to outweigh the glory in my body and my mind this is what we draw from scripture that all the things that you suffer every single circumstance symptom every instance of suffering whether it be in body or mind it is always pregnant amen it's always pregnant with glory because that's what that's the only thing that's going to come from your suffering is the greater glory as paul talks about it so we ought to never let these things discourage us and it's in this that i believe that the holy spirit is wanting to address the things that hinder us from receiving our healing because you take somebody who in the right place in their soul has the glory of god residing within them and then they begin to suffer sickness and what they do is immediately let they let that flip things around and reorder their thought process to where now eternal life is out of the picture and they're hyper focused on their physical condition that's a state that only the saved can be in this is this is uh kind of taking all those statements where brethren says i've seen a ranked center come across the platform and be healed but a believer come by and not be healed and remember we walk through this wednesday night and we're identifying why it's so hard for people like us sometimes to receive our healing and just back up a little bit and realize why it's so important that we write this ship a little bit and we get this in order because we're going to have to have power not just to take away a toothache but change our body and if we're getting upside down and all confused and discombobulated with respect to a little physical pain and we're not living within that soul realm then we need to get things back in balance paul says in second corinthians chapter 4 verse 7 but we have this treasure in earth and vessels that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us there is a divine excellency deposited in you he says we have this treasure it's a repository it's not it's it says we have this deposit we could call the deposit the treasure but you are the treasury there's this repository you are a repository of divine excellency this is something we should ought to never forget brother brahm said in the message perseverance i don't know if i provided this statement but because it's so easy for us to live below what we are the order's been kind of turned upside down brother brahman says god has done something for you he saved you that's the greatest miracle there is there's got to be a recalibration of self-worth there's got to be we have to get a um i know sometimes when it comes to insurance you have to get something revalued you have to get it appraised and you have to get this appraised or coach comes time to buy something there has to be appraisal of the value and of its worth i think it's time for us to get a spiritual appraisal of our worth we've lost connection with it we're trying to you want to look at your blessed assurance policy you need to look at the appraisal that's attached with it you kind of look at the value that god has placed upon you and it's just so easy for us to live distant from our actual value but we have this treasure and earth and vessels that we have divine excellency deposited in us that's why paul begins to go down in the next several verses that's why we're we're cast down but not in despair we're this but we're not forsaken we're this but we're not well i said there may be a lot of things this way but when you look at it there's no way we can ever be lost we could ever be forsaken we should ever be in despair because of the value and the worth of what you have deposited inside of you you say oh god's never done anything for me or god hasn't done something for me in this and this is suffering and that is suffering and we begin to wonder has god forsaken me has god ever done anything god has done something for you he saved you that's the greatest miracle there is there needs to be a reordering of the graces there needs to be a reordering of the privileges so often we are jealous or we envy those who are blessed financially we envy those who are blessed with great physiques we envy those who experience divine healing we experience those who experience these great restorations out of terrible trials and we're failing to value what god has done for us in our soul he's done something for you he saved you and i'll say one of the biggest traps some of our young people can fall into is how we often take the most depraved individual's testimony and put it on a pedestal of how remarkable god's grace is and we say look at the healing that god did in this person's life look at the salvation that god did in this person's life but we do not echo the value of god's healing power to preserve and keep those who never make it on that pedestal there's got to be a reappraisal of graces or reappraisal of privileges what god is granting our families today is of the greatest value to not have to spend a moment in the world i take a testimony of somebody that says well i've been healed of cancer 476 times is that how many times we've had colds this year i don't know why there's maybe some spiritual about four six seven six but and then you take somebody says you know i i haven't i haven't been sick for years and god i've just god kept me in great health and we've got this we got this family problem where everybody in my family has died of heart attacks by 60 and here i'm 76 years old never had a heart problem at all and we're coming okay yeah what about this person who has cancer set 476 times you don't think god's in this you don't think god's in your wellness you don't think god's you should every night you should thank god for if you're healthy right now you should thank god for it if you're paying the bills you should thank god for it but if he saved you that's the greatest miracle there is have we not been reading a lot from luke chapter 10 i guess maybe not a lot we've made reference to it he says i've given you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and the power of the enemy nothing shall by any means hurt you says but you know what in this rejoice not because spirits are subject to you but rejoice because your names are written in heaven that's where the rejoicing is that's where the glory is we don't glory in the fact that we were now i want to i want to say this and then back it up with another statement we don't glory in that we were sick physically and then now well we glory in the salvation of our souls because if you diminish the power of our salvation it limits the power it limits the power of your faith if you diminish the power and the glory of your salvation it's going to limit the effectiveness of your faith because it's a there's a consciousness to your faith that knows when you're no longer operating by faith because with because there's an improper assessment you put too much worth and value on the soundness of your mind and body and not enough on the soundness of your soul and therefore faith cannot even in desperation act to change the circumstances of mind and body because it's kind of like wait as brother randy snow likes to say hey what am i chop liver huh why don't you ever call me right there's like i'm down here and i'm very very real and i'm very very powerful but you've somehow gotten all hyper fixated on all these other things and it's not from here from a good place from a powerful place that you're trying to operate your faith but you're in a compromised position somehow and by diminishing the glory of the salvation of our soul we have limited the effectiveness of our faith in our spirits and bodies in the sermon the uncertain sound brother bram says anything that's uncertain is unreliable and so in days of this time when they're not certain whether jesus is the same yesterday today and forever leave the thing alone i think that applies to any promise of god it was the theme of brethren's ministry in healing he's the same yesterday today and forever you can be certain amen where's your certainty you can know it to be that if it never performs any more miracle on you but the great miracle forgives your sins you can be certain if he never performs any other miracle on you but he has forgiven your sins which the seal of is the holy ghost then you can be certain oh if i could just have this happen i'll be certain oh if i could just have this happen i could be certain oh if i could have this happen i can be servant uh certain well if you've never been saved that sounds a lot like you've not been saved but if you have been saved there's a faith down on the inside saying wait a minute i'm pretty sure about this wait a minute i'm pretty sure about this wanting you to get out of your own mind let the mind of christ have preeminence to say this i know this i can be certain of that god has done something for me this i can be certain of he is the same yesterday today and forever well have you ever seen him raise the dead have you ever had a limb restored have you ever had tonsils grow back miraculously nope never had it then how can you know i can be certain because this soul which was as black as night has been regenerated into life and in delight and i can be certain he is the same yesterday today and forever that's the greatest miracle that god ever performed was to forgive a human being it's sins now he amplifies it take a man and convert him from the things look that's changed his innermost being not his body and his mind necessary but his innermost being from the things that he once drank and gambled and done evil and things like that and all of a sudden turns him right back around to love goes home to his wife and says honey i'm sorry that i've treated you like that picks up his little children hold them in his arms in the arm daddy spent all his money for whiskey daddy's done this and mother's been out all night long and left you chilled and i'll never do it again god forgive me and how that testimony that one of the greatest things that's one of the greatest things there is all the alcoholics anonymous didn't know they were in his target all the alcoholics anonymous and all like that can never change like that can they can never do they can never do for the person all the steps all the programs all the disciplines all the ways even all the uh the the ways that they try to use other substances to wean you off of bad substances all the things that they may try to do all the clinics can never do what god can do it's the greatest miracle again i'm addressing the barriers to your healing as a sealed believer brother braham of the sermon hear him he says you've never seen a miracle you say i i've never so before you see anything come accept christ first then you'll be in position to accept miracles and things when you see the lame walk in the blind sea is that so then is that not the position we ought to remain in oh you've never seen a miracle he's saying well then he's not just saying well come look at this so how about you just accept christ because because the miracles aren't the great thing they're not the important thing i'm anymore just slight of hand is a miracle to people like how did they do that and they literally believe they did that like wow this is amazing these people can levitate they can make the statue of liberty disappear and there's all sorts of things that they in their minds believe has happened and they don't realize no there's just a lot of money spent on this it's all angles smoking mirrors as it were i said no if you've never seen a miracle it's not about the show of a miracle it's about christ so he says accept christ first that's what it's all about anyways and once you accept christ i believe he's talking about the person of christ coming into you then you'll be in the position it says to accept miracles for yourself when you see miracles or be able to agree with them and accept them when you see the lame walk in the blind say you're in a position to accept that is the power of god what's the main thing the salvation of the soul so the sermon preparation he says how do you take a sinner like me and like you and making christian out of us i can't understand it that's the greatest miracle that god ever performed is when he took a sinner and made a christian out of us you believe that god can save anybody from sin because you've been taught that he says well that's a far more of a miracle that man that was dead and trespasses in sin that man is dead and he had to believe or remain dead i'll let this sink in i'm hoping that this really really just has the impact then after you were born again you become a son of god how much more ought you to believe for a lesser miracle for divine healing if a live man ought to believe more than a dead man see what i mean you've got to believe it can't explain it believe it that's all you have to do who's he speaking to not the dead prostitutes that somehow in their dead state can come and receive divine healing he's talking to those of us who have had our natures changed and god has performed on us the greatest miracle but somehow through all our knowledge and our ups and downs and all of our experiences we've somehow made the healing of this so much bigger than the healing of this and we've let what can be seen and felt and recorded and prescribed and diagnosed loomed so much larger than the fact that god has healed us of the sickness and our of sin in our souls and is liberated from death and he says if you can believe that how much more are you to believe for a lesser miracle of divine healing if your sins have been forgiven you and you know that you have the holy ghost then how much more are you this is not this is not in any way sarcastic this is in no way uh spanking it's it's just kind of like oh whoa hello yeah he's like hey you know if you could do this i mean you can that's better that's greater how much more ought to be believe for a lesser miracle of divine healing how much more should a living people believe more than dead people this whole series on christ my healer is about placing our faith in christ for all things it's a it's a centering our faith on him what what the true basis of healing is and the sermon demonology in the physical realm and i think that's a title that kind of speaks to how these things can even work he says how could a person on that estate and that condition i'm not a believer and i'm using this maybe out of the context here but to refer to a pers person whose soul is sealed eternally permanently healed says how can a person in that condition ever be sick maybe that's the devil the that's the statement the devil makes to us yeah i mean uh how could he be saved and cron and but still be chronically sick huh right is that the voice the devil uses with you to me it's garrison keeler's cigarette demon he used to use years ago i need a cigarette i need a cigarette but this is what he's like how is it that i i can be sealed in this condition and ever get sick he says because your body's not redeemed yet okay all right makes sense your body's not redeemed no matter how much how good you are how saintly how holy how much holy spirit that's only your soul and a very simple statement which i think is just stating the obvious for all of us our soul is fully redeemed future home where are we eight they already in our souls and he's saying but yet the body is not redeemed yet though it may go through cycles of the types of redemption in healing it is not yet redeemed so he is clarifying why sickness comes on a believer this is the clarification how can you say you have eternal life in your soul you have the power of god down in your soul but you still get sick in mind or body how can that be well the clear answer is mind and body are not yet fully redeemed so that clarifies why a believer can still get sick but more importantly if i could say it this way it's he is by putting it this way he's not just trying to clarify why we can still get sick but he's trying to place our faith on where the real power is where do we put our confidence not in that i've got a body that's impervious to viral infections and not that i've got a body that will never get a bacterial illness that's not where it is at all it's not that i've got a spirit that's locked in i got locked in at this great really great uh satisfaction rate locked in no matter what happens up or down i'm locked in i'm happy with me you know this is fine i'm locked in i can't go any lower i can't go any higher and it's not that at all what he's wanting us to realize is wait a minute i have a body that can still get sick i have a spirit that can still get discouraged but i got a soul they can't get sick i got a i got a soul that doesn't get sad i got a soul that doesn't get discouraged i got a soul that doesn't have a doubt since anymore it's impossible for my soul to doubt now hold up right wait a minute that changes things i'm gonna stop living with my faith on my body i'm gonna stop living with my faith on my spirit but i'm gonna start letting my faith and my soul look out at the rest of things it's a it's a way of brother i'm trying to place our faith don't sit there and say well i'm sick i'm sick well i mean i know that just happens it happens but wait a minute if your soul is sealed the body can still get sick but it's like but the soul is sealed hey it's like maybe we just well how can why is it the body can still get sick because the body's not redeemed your soul is perfectly redeemed but the body's not redeemed so with the body not being redeemed wait a minute i want to go back to something what do you say about the saul that's what the statement ought to do let's talk all day about our family medical history all right you ever go to the doctor and they want you to put down all the times you've been in the hospital what you're allergic to you're kind of like i need more ink right like they want to know everything about you and you're telling them you know that like when they're asking us about whether or not you had coveted symptoms you're kind of like are you breathing sorry sir you can't visit the infirm in this hospital because you're breathing well i could try to hold my breath and it's like everything everything was like did you wake up this morning yeah everything's like everything's a symptom and we're full of it so let's talk about it let's talk about your your symptoms let's talk about your medical history what i want you to do is take everything in your medicine cabinet everything in your pantry bring it over to my house and we're going to go through it we're going to figure out what's causing your problems and we're going to talk about what you can add it's going to fix your problems you need that's what you need you need to play in the dirt more and i would be like you know before we do that can we come back to what you just said about my soul again that's what we ought to be doing i mean listen we ought to put young living out of business right i'm not a doterra salesman either but we all these supplements and all these things we spend all our time i'm not going on a rent but maybe i am we spend all our time talking about all the supplements we can do to our mind and our body when all we need to do to supplement our mind and body is to come back to hold up wait a minute my soul is sealed my soul is healed my soul has divine power [Applause] brother bradham is trying to place our faith in the wholeness the soul is made whole the soul is perfectly healed therefore redemption power is already in you right redemption power is already in you so whenever whenever we are sick and i'm gonna spend a lot of time on this maybe in the future a lot of time may just be a sunday morning afternoon type service but that when you're sick we know that going to the doctor is perfectly fine in a matter of faith i think i might just deal with the whole idea of if i do have faith what does it look like does it mean i seek every available remedy for my disease or does it mean i do nothing right and i know these are questions we might ask ourselves and so there is there is when we are sick there's a reaching out for things that are beyond ourselves but never forget that when you are sick if you have the holy ghost redemption power is already in you and the sermon of paradox brotherhood says if you're sick i wish i could heal you but no man can do that it's already done healing lies in you it's your faith in the finished work that god did on calvary with jesus christ and outside of that there is no healing and outside of that there is no salvation no church no denomination no ritual nothing packs salvation no church no domination no ritual packs healing healing lies in you he says and works his faith expressed the healing power is in you it didn't come from the preacher it comes to you by faith following this the healing power is in you it doesn't come from the preacher it comes to you by revelation by faith but healing power is already in you and the sermon power of transformation let the holy spirit this to me just sums it up so beautifully so perfectly let the holy spirit come upon any person that's truly got something down there what's the something down there it's the something that's already there it's the something that's coming it's too omnipotence meeting it's the omnipotence of god's power divine in the soul of a saved person and in the spirit of god coming down and having to go through the channels of physical hearing and spiritually opening up to let it strike the soul let the holy spirit come upon anyone that's truly got something down there a healing comes from the inside listen believers let that healing come from the spirit that's in you if it's a genuine spirit anointing the genuine seed it can't do nothing but bear a son or daughters of god the healing is already within you when you are sick and you need healing we're not seeking a shaman we're not seeking a remedy we're not trying to find a bomb we're not trying to find a pool we're not waiting for the right cycle we believe that healing lays within us already and accept it that the healing comes from the inside healing let that healing come from the spirit that's in you i hope that i hope that has some impact let it come from what's in you healing comes from the inside healing lies in you the healing power is in you for the believer that changes it for i've got the holy ghost i've got depression and i've got back pain and so i'm externally looking for remedies right alone but when a person by faith can say i know there's power to heal on the inside of me it changes the nature by which you take a pill for chemical imbalance it changes the attitude that you have when you go to the chiropractor because you know at the end of the day you're not making your faith subject to anything else you know the healing power is going to come from within so whenever that chiropractor just says let me just do some uh ear cones on you and get all that ear wax out of your ear and that's gonna that's gonna straighten your head a little bit and that's gonna make your hips get into alignment and then obviously you walk out there with no nerve pain anymore you're not praising the virtues of ear cones you're praising the virtue of a god who said the power to heal was inside of you now i'm gonna i have a this is the last thought that i almost was gonna put my sermon title as as this because it's talking about the soul wanting us just to recognize the value of what god's done for our soul because it's the the soul has had our sins remitted for the remission of sins there's several statements in this matthew chapter 26 verse 28 for this is my blood he's given the the communion for this is my blood of the new testament this wine represents the blood that he's going to shed the blood of the new covenant which was shed for he says the remission of sins so when he shed his blood and in the shedding of his blood we know that there was atonement for body spirit soul he's saying this is the shedding of my blood which is for the remission of your sins that's its primary efficacy that's where it's directed to is to save the soul remission is translated to forgiveness deliverance or liberty and the scripture means to release from bondage or imprisonment it's the remission the releasing of the bondage of your soul the liberty of your soul the forgiveness of your soul it comes from a family meaning to leave behind your soul is not being left behind but sins are being left behind it comes from to abandon or to expire the very root of this word is its conjugate means to destroy the union or to separate from when i have re the remission of sins means i've taken your soul which was joined with sin and though it may have seemed to be so mixed together to where it was black i've been able to take sin out of it completely separate it leave it behind destroy the union that is what the remission of sin means it means you've been released from sin it no longer has power over you this is even part of the commission in luke 24 as the commission is given in the reading in luke verse 47 and that repentance and remission of sin should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at jerusalem so when they were to go in all the world and preach the gospel and to him that believeth in and as baptized shall be saved what were they preaching remission of sins they weren't preaching the healing of the body they were preaching the remission of sins so peter on the day of pentecost in acts 2 38 one of the most outstanding scriptures we can recognize in the bible then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost the repentance and the faith in christ is the process by which god will take the sickness of sin upon the soul and separate it from you and destroy the union and so preaching remission of sins is the gospel the seal of god is a seal that your sins have been separated or abolished from your soul acts chapter 10 verse 43 to him give all the prophets witness that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins romans 3 25 whom god hath set forth to be a perpetuation through faith in his blood he is going to be that offering he's going to be that price he's going to be that remedy the perpetuation through faith in his blood he is the mercy seat he is the atonement to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are passed through the forbearance of god even for to remit sins that are past because it was the remission of sins as paul is identifying even for those who had sinned in the old testament before the blood was even shed that's how powerful the blood is it can even put in put the remission of sins for those in the past because it atones for all the phrase to me remission of sins is so complete and total that it leaves no room for sin to ever come back the remission of sins ought to shed light then on the health of our mind and body just even that phrase because we know that sickness is the result of sin it's an attribute of sin so in john chapter 5 verse 14 as we read it today and afterward jesus finds him in the temple and says unto the impotent man who is healed again this is all this is all on his own the guy wasn't oh son of david have mercy on me he says behold thou art made whole there's your wholeness sin no more lest the worst thing come unto thee right this is this is with respect to his physical healing so where what is what is sickness a result of unbelief for sin so in order for a person in that state to rely upon to be remain perfectly whole in that it's a matter of them disbelieving for them to get sick brother brahman says and this is i have another statement from another servant but this listen to this one quickly sickness and sin are so closely associated together that it's almost like soul and body sickness and sin are so closely associated together it's like soul and body it's inseparable man has to die his soul is full of sin and his body's full of sickness and death is pronounced on him he's got to go his soul is sick and his body is sick and he says it's so closely associated together you can't even separate him the sin-sick soul and the sick body so think about this we have a sick soul and a sick body and they're inseparable right so then god heals the soul what's happened there's been some dis disentangling right so now you have a well soul but a sick body that still has to die in the sermon can we see jesus this is a my last last really lengthy statement to you so so that's the way divine healing is i know it's getting late i know it's hot it's cooler now than when it started so that's the way divine healing is it's based not upon some emotion not upon shaking or something of that type not upon anything but accepting what god promised you and jesus died that you may have no one can properly and clearly preach the gospel without preaching divine healing you just can't do it let's think spiritually about this let's really get to the heart of this let's get down to the real root of the glory that's within our souls and notice what this looks like because the remission of sins the fact that our sins have been remitted and all these statements we read the shedding of his blood by stripes were healed for the remission of sins for the mission of sins let's look at this now as we're closing soon for sickness is an attribute of sin and you can't deal with sickness without dealing with sin because sickness came as a attribute of sin before we had any sickness we had no sin but when we got sin sickness followed you have to deal with both together now he's he's coming back primarily to the perpetuation that it wasn't that he was crucified on the cross solely for our divine healing or even for specifically our divine healing but it was to atone for sin and what he's saying is they're so closely linked together you can't separate them you can't you can't pay a debt with an ounce of flesh without exacting some blood i don't know why you just use that as an example but it's one of those cliches that makes you think may i like may i like say it like this if a big animal had his pawn i know we read this here recently i think if a big animal had his paw in my side and was tearing up my ribs the rest of the animal wasn't bothering me but it was just his paw and he was tearing my ribs out now i do not have to find a knife to cut off his paw just knock him in the head that kills the whole animal well that's the way with sin so the head of the the paw in your side the thorn in your flesh the thing that's causing you pain or sickness in your body is the head of that is sin and so he's saying well that's the way it is with sin when you kill sin you kill every attribute that follows it so it may not be that you've sinned but the weakness of your parents and your parents parents says sickness is hereditary in many cases and through each generation gets weaker and wiser as the scripture says and so therefore you have to deal with sickness and sin on the same basis of the atonement this is such beautifully deep enriched teaching these statements brother branham are making are just it's endless in its depth it's so vast in its application he's saying that christ's price on calvary and the shedding of his blood was the price that crushed the head of the serpent and it paid the price of sin that's the head of the beast that's the head of the animal but then the paul that then had itself in the body that caused sickness when he paid for sin he had to deal with the power of the beast to make your body sick so he's saying you have to deal with sickness and sin on the same basis of the atonement so if sin which is related to the soul and sickness which is related to the body and spirit are on the same basis then so is remission so think of think of the term remission not in the scriptural sense but in a healing sense or a physical sense a medical sense remission in a in a health care setting means the reduction or disappearance of signs or symptoms of a disease when someone says their their thyroid disease is in remission or cancer is in remission or this disease or this problem is in remission it means there's a disappearance of the signs and symptoms now this remission medically can be partial or complete and that's that's where science has to do in the realm of science so they have a complete remission when there's complete remission this is what it means test physical exams scans every test they run on your blood every scan they do of your body every physical test everything shows that all signs of the disease are gone in other words everything that was there before they begin to point them to the initial diagnosis and they say based on your blood test based on your scans we see a physical mass we see the scan your blood test shows that your body is fighting this it's all positive for this when someone is in complete remission it goes back to the way it was before where there is no mass there's nothing in your blood it's like look we don't even have any record at all that can tell that you have it when you're in complete remission it's that all signs evidence symptoms indication that cancer or disease is gone and they call it full remission it's the total disappearance of all signs and symptoms of a disease to where science can actually say and some doctors say you're cured or they use the phrase no evidence that's what remission means to someone who's physically sick and so in hebrews chapter 10 verses 14 to 18 for by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are sanctified whereof the holy ghost also is a witness to us for after that he had said before this is the covenant that i will make with them after those days saith the lord i will put my laws into their hearts and their minds will i write them and their sins and iniquities will i remember no more their sins and iniquities when there is the remission of sins there is no evidence where there is the remission of sins there are no signs there are no skins there are no tests there are no symptoms as far as god is concerned a person is in full and complete remission wherever he has written the word in their hearts and listen how the language just tracks the science their sins and iniquities will i remember no more they are cured now where remission of these is there is no more offering of sins when a person is in complete or full remission they cease treatment there's no need to treat it anymore there's no need for those pills there's no need for this there's no need for that you are as far as we are concerned you are in full and complete remission so he says where sins have been remitted where i there is no evidence where there's no signs when there's not even signs that it was there before it's as if you have been made whole to a person who has never had sin who's never had a heart attack who's never had this never had that that's why science sometimes when god heals somebody they're like well we've been kind of trying to dig around to put a name on what you had but we can't even find what we thought we saw before so we're just going to believe it was this or believe it was that or say it's this or say or just keep on looking and keep on looking and it didn't amazing that they might be bird dogging something gosh god decided just to make whole i can't even find antibodies for this we can't even find elevated that we can't even find this we can't even find that why he is remitted now listen if that's the way it is for the soul and they're so linked together that he even uses this language and the scripture that we are our soul has been per he has perfected forever them that are sanctified the holy ghost is a witness of this covenant that the word is written into our souls and he's going to write in our hearts and in our minds and our sins and iniquities are remembered no more it says it's remission are the sins their soul is in remission and therefore since they are in remission there does not need to be a repetitive offering for sin because the soul has been made whole it needs there's no perpetual it doesn't need it anymore it's done it's in remission and it's upon this basis i'm closing it's upon this basis that we approach the healing of our minds it's upon this basis that we want to approach the healing of our bodies we are in remission already we have already experienced the greatest miracle of all no matter what the scan show what the blood test show what the symptoms show no matter what my mind or body is signaling i can stand here as a survivor of sin i could stand here as somebody who at one time had every bit of evidence of death in darkness and disease but my soul is in remission and i could stand as a survivor of sin and say i'm more than a survivor i'm more than a conqueror i am an overcomer [Music] because the greatest miracle of all has taken place on my soul and that's what the promise of wholeness does it ought to connect us to the god that's in us to stir up that healing that's within because let's close i want to read this statement let's just take it to the last slide in the rising of the sun divine healing is for our soul as far as spirit for our bodies the promise of wholeness harmony among the parts and whenever my spirit's not right and my body's not right i need to remember what it what it feels like to be right and what it means to feel it in the soul it's an attitude adjustment that's really what it is when you think about it it's an attitude adjustment we get so worried about these other things and it's easy to do especially if you rest on your mind your spirits but faith has got to start to heart the heartbeat has to come back again i'm in remission if sin is gone talk about a powerful place right if sin is gone and sin has been disentangled from my soul then let that become the force by which it can drive sickness because the healing is in you this is the promise of wholeness maybe your faith can reach out and grab this last statement dear god as he's praying we do this in the name of jesus christ the only name given among men whereby that we could be saved or healed these people who are fellow citizens of the kingdom a possessor of quickening power quicken it to them who is he praying to people who possess quickening power fellow citizens of the kingdom quicken it to them there's a quickening and there's more quickenings this is the language and may the spirit go from eagle to eagle word to word till the fullness of jesus christ be made manifest in each of the bodies for physical spiritual or any need they have need of there's your promise from eagle to eagle word to word you are a possessor of quickening power that's my attitude adjustment no matter how sick i get how depressed i get i am the possessor of quickening power so i am praying that the spirit will visit this eagle that eagle this word that word until christ is made manifest physically spiritually or whatever i have need of because that's the promise i'm living in now is the promise of wholeness god bless you let's stand together musicians who come
