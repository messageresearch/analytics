[0:00] Now on the subject of perfect love, this
[0:03] is going to be a few things at the
[0:04] outset and then I'll give you my title
[0:06] um after a little bit. But on the
[0:08] subject of perfect love, uh you all know
[0:11] already that it's vast. That if we were
[0:13] to take a subject and begin to teach on
[0:16] it or preach on it and preach
[0:17] inspirationally, you just take the
[0:19] subject of love and you can take it all
[0:21] the way from Genesis to Revelation,
[0:22] you'll find enough material. You'll find
[0:24] plenty of quotations. There's a lot of
[0:27] uh experiences that one could share. is
[0:29] just the the subject matter is vast and
[0:32] not only is it vast and just replete
[0:35] through the scripture and very deep in
[0:37] the message of God and a lot of very uh
[0:39] particular aspects maybe to the end time
[0:41] and the message of the hour that are
[0:42] beautiful to bring out. I will say that
[0:45] understanding God's love is critical
[0:48] very critical to understand his love and
[0:51] if I could say to this end I'm trying to
[0:53] maybe avoid some of the parts that deal
[0:54] with the misunderstanding. It's also
[0:56] very easy to misunderstand it. And so we
[0:59] must know his love. We must understand
[1:01] his love. We know that nothing but
[1:02] perfect love is going to be in that uh
[1:04] in that rapture. So there's a lot of lot
[1:07] of things that weigh heavy on us when we
[1:09] consider this subject. And and so
[1:11] there's I don't think I need to give too
[1:12] much emphasis at the outset just how
[1:15] important God's love is or how important
[1:17] perfect love is. And God has dealt with
[1:21] me very deeply and it's been something
[1:23] I've been studying over some time now to
[1:24] minister on many subjects under this
[1:27] banner of perfect love. And and I think
[1:30] it's a broad general subject. And I also
[1:32] in some ways as I go forward kind of
[1:35] want to be able to bring out how there's
[1:36] a lot of ways that we think about love
[1:37] where we've just kind of pushed it into
[1:40] a hole and said this is it. This is all
[1:41] that it is. not realizing there's a lot
[1:43] more to it even in a negative side
[1:45] because the Bible uses love in a way
[1:48] that isn't good and even uses the same
[1:50] Greek words for it. So sometimes we
[1:52] could just be so summarily this is all
[1:54] that it is and this is what agape is and
[1:56] this is all that this is and we want to
[1:58] look at it in a very broad way and then
[2:00] narrow it down to maybe some specific
[2:01] things. And so for some time as the Lord
[2:04] would lead, we want to be ministering on
[2:05] this subject of perfect love. But then
[2:08] very specific things underneath that
[2:11] umbrella or that banner of perfect love.
[2:13] In 1 Corinthians chapter 13 verse 13, I
[2:16] know this may come as a surprise that we
[2:18] would quote from this chapter when
[2:19] preaching on love. And without reading
[2:22] the whole thing, I want to look at this
[2:23] scripture here to start. It says, "And
[2:24] now abideth faith, hope, charity, these
[2:27] three, but the greatest of these is
[2:30] charity.
[2:32] Uh, say amen. If the greatest of these
[2:34] is charity,
[2:35] okay, so I they they didn't pack the
[2:37] amens up and misplace them during the
[2:39] move. It says, "Now abideth faith, hope,
[2:42] charity, these three, but the greatest
[2:44] of these is charity." Now, when Paul
[2:46] says this, I think this is a very
[2:48] striking scripture. I don't know if
[2:50] you've already fully processed this,
[2:52] digested, completely understand it
[2:54] frontwards and backwards and inside out,
[2:56] but to say that their faith, hope, and
[2:58] charity, these three now abide, but the
[2:59] greatest is charity. There's a lot
[3:01] that's said in that. And what he's
[3:03] saying is that right now now abideth
[3:06] right here on earth. And this is very
[3:07] this helped me understand this so much
[3:09] better. Right now we have faith, hope,
[3:11] and charity. Those are that's what
[3:13] abides now. Uh these three are here on
[3:15] earth. These three are with us now. We
[3:17] need these three now. He says, "But the
[3:18] greatest of these is charity." And the
[3:21] word charity that is used there is the
[3:22] noun agape. It's translated to love.
[3:25] It's translated to charity. It's
[3:27] translated even used just as deer uh in
[3:29] the scripture. D A R not to get the
[3:32] hunting brothers excited but it's
[3:34] translated that way. This word agape
[3:37] it's charity and it means simply means
[3:39] brotherly love. It means affection,
[3:42] goodwill, love, a benevolence. Even that
[3:44] word is conjugated to be beloved. And so
[3:46] it's something that just speaks of a
[3:48] good feeling towards I don't want to
[3:50] just emphasize maybe feeling so much but
[3:52] an affection, a good will, a a love, a
[3:55] benevolence towards somebody. And that
[3:57] would be the noun charity. It just
[3:59] speaks of something that it is. It is
[4:00] it's brotherly affection and goodwill.
[4:02] Love and benevolence. That's the agape.
[4:05] You'll find other places that the verb
[4:07] form of agape and agape oh
[4:10] it is it's translated to love. It's
[4:12] translated to beloved. It means to
[4:13] welcome someone, to entertain, to be
[4:16] fond of or to love dearly. And it speaks
[4:18] more of a verb and that there's some
[4:20] action or something overt about the
[4:22] love. Uh where uh if I can maybe use it
[4:25] this way, and I didn't premeditate this,
[4:26] so it might be a bad example. Uh that
[4:29] the the verb is expressing something
[4:32] that love is being expressed. So it
[4:34] carries some action with it. Whereas
[4:35] somebody say I I love them and it speaks
[4:38] of something that's inward. And so I
[4:40] could tell you that I'm really really
[4:42] happy right now
[4:46] and and that would be just a state of a
[4:49] of agape or happiness. But then to have
[4:51] the verb then that you I could be acting
[4:54] happy and I could be smiling and
[4:55] everybody would say he's not an angry
[4:57] preacher anymore and and that would be
[4:59] something demonstrative that would
[5:00] indicate that love is just not a state
[5:02] but it's an acti activity.
[5:05] And so, as I've studied this more over
[5:07] the last three months, I feel that I may
[5:08] owe DC Talk an apology because I've
[5:11] always made fun of their love is a verb
[5:12] song and realizing that love is not just
[5:15] a verb. But yeah, maybe there's some
[5:17] truth to that. So, whatever the MC name
[5:19] is, I apologize. Is it Toby Mack who
[5:22] wrote it? I don't know. But, uh, love
[5:24] does have an active active to it and it
[5:26] is used as a verb in scripture. Now, to
[5:29] say now abideth faith, hope, and
[5:31] charity, but the greatest of these is
[5:33] charity. We know that without faith it
[5:35] is impossible to please God.
[5:37] So the Bible say without faith it is
[5:40] impossible to please God but charity is
[5:41] greater than faith. We know that without
[5:43] hope it's impossible to endure. So if we
[5:46] took scriptures and shows just how not
[5:47] the enemy of faith but the truth of
[5:49] faith and hope working together that
[5:51] both uh faith gives uh hope to us
[5:54] because we're expecting something and
[5:55] without that hope you can't be patient.
[5:57] You can't endure. You cannot receive the
[5:59] promise. just to see where faith and
[6:01] hope fit in terms of the emphasis in the
[6:04] scripture. And then for the Bible to
[6:06] say, "But charity is greater."
[6:08] Somehow love, agape, is greater than
[6:11] faith and hope.
[6:13] And there are things that are said about
[6:14] charity. There are things that are said
[6:16] about love that are ne never said about
[6:18] faith and hope. In 1 John 4:8, it says,
[6:21] "He that loveth knoweth not God." But
[6:23] this is the part I want you to just keep
[6:25] in mind. For God is love.
[6:28] So there's things that are said about
[6:30] love, about this agape that he does not
[6:33] say, the Bible does not say about faith
[6:35] and hope. And so this gives us some
[6:36] pause to say that we know how important
[6:38] faith is because without it, we can't
[6:40] know God. We can't please God. We know
[6:42] how important hope is because without
[6:43] it, we can't receive the promises. But
[6:45] why is charity greater? And we realize
[6:47] that God equates himself with charity by
[6:50] saying God is love. Right.
[6:53] But could I ask the question, can we
[6:55] invert that if God is love is all love
[6:58] God?
[7:00] Something to think about.
[7:02] Faith and hope then as we consider that
[7:05] and address this at the outset. Faith
[7:08] and hope abide here now together with
[7:10] charity. And faith and hope are
[7:12] necessary to bring us back into
[7:13] fellowship with God. I've kind of moved
[7:15] some things looking at it now and I
[7:17] realize I've moved some things to for
[7:18] maybe next Sunday, but they're necessary
[7:20] to bring us back into fellowship. and
[7:22] relationship with God here. Now, without
[7:25] faith, you can't be in fellowship with
[7:26] God. Without hope, you don't have the
[7:27] endurance to enjoy your communion with
[7:29] God. But when we speak of love, love is
[7:32] therefore characterizing
[7:34] a different state, a state of innocence,
[7:36] a state of harmony, a state of
[7:37] perfection in God. that if we have faith
[7:40] and hope to be in fellowship with God
[7:41] and God is love. Then I think just even
[7:43] in that thought process we could realize
[7:45] that faith and hope are necessary but
[7:47] they bring us to a greater state of of
[7:50] harmony with God which is characterized
[7:52] as love.
[7:54] The Bible says in 1 Corinthians chapter
[7:56] 13 verse 10, "But when that which is
[7:59] perfect is come,
[8:01] then that which is in part shall be done
[8:03] away."
[8:04] And so he's describing this uh
[8:10] I'll come to it here in a moment at the
[8:12] end of uh the next verse that we read
[8:15] he's describing a greater way a better
[8:17] way of love. It's a uh uh and as he's
[8:21] describing and in the verses preceding
[8:23] this he's talking about love he's
[8:24] talking about love and then he speaks of
[8:26] a perfect condition a perfect state we
[8:28] know in part. We prophesy in part but
[8:29] when that which is perfect is come. And
[8:31] so what he's doing is he's bringing love
[8:33] and perfection into the same
[8:34] conversation.
[8:36] And if I could say this just to get your
[8:39] your thoughts uh maybe sync your
[8:41] thoughts with mine and what I'm looking
[8:42] at. Paul says, "Now here on earth abides
[8:45] faith, hope, and charity, but charity is
[8:48] the greatest of these." And he says when
[8:50] that and then there's this thought that
[8:51] when that which is perfect is come, all
[8:53] the parts are kind of summed up into the
[8:55] whole in heaven. Let me say this that
[8:57] love is going to be the sum of all
[8:59] perfection.
[9:01] And so in heaven, uh, faith and hope are
[9:04] going to be satisfied in love. Uh, faith
[9:07] what it looks forward to, faith what it
[9:08] speaks of and the substance that it
[9:10] represents, hope and what it's enduring
[9:12] for. That when that which is perfect is
[9:14] come, we don't do away with faith
[9:15] necessarily. We never do away with hope,
[9:17] but they're satisfied or if I can say
[9:20] fused and united together with this
[9:22] condition of perfect love. And therefore
[9:25] you can see that faith and hope are here
[9:27] now abiding now with charity to bring us
[9:30] to that place of perfection.
[9:33] And Paul says in 1 Corinthians 12:31
[9:36] and kind of hold that in mind how uh
[9:39] Paul is bringing that which is perfect
[9:42] while he's talking about charity
[9:43] together. So I think there's this this
[9:45] relationship between per that which is
[9:47] perfect and charity.
[9:49] Now, in 1 Corinthians 12:31,
[9:52] as he's talking about gifts, he says,
[9:54] "But covet earnestly the be best gifts.
[9:58] This drywall dust is going to make my
[10:00] lisp even worse, and you guys will have
[10:03] a lot of fun little tick- tocks you can
[10:05] create around my lisp, but covet
[10:08] earnestly the best gifts, and yet show I
[10:10] unto you a more excellent way."
[10:14] Love is what then he begins to expound
[10:16] upon. And so love is essential to this
[10:19] chief this more excellent way this chief
[10:21] of excellence way. And he's speaking of
[10:24] love in such a way that it says that
[10:26] yeah desire and covet the best gifts and
[10:29] those things. He's not dismissive of all
[10:31] the gifts but he's saying but I want to
[10:33] show you a more excellent way a more
[10:35] excellent course of conduct. and and
[10:37] catch this that the way that Paul begins
[10:39] to write about it that what he's saying
[10:41] is love is both inspirational and
[10:43] aspirational
[10:45] in that it's not anything that we just
[10:47] necessarily say I got it and it's mine
[10:50] uh but it's something that inspires us
[10:52] but then we also aspire to it that if we
[10:55] have charity a and it's something that's
[10:57] in our hearts we recognize there's
[10:58] something fundamental to that something
[11:00] foundational but it's something that's
[11:02] not only just foundational but it's
[11:04] aspirational because we know that
[11:05] there's more that we can grow into with
[11:07] love because he says, "Not only do I
[11:10] show you a more excellent way and then
[11:12] expounds upon that way in love in
[11:14] chapter 13, but then he says in 1
[11:16] Corinthians 14:1,
[11:18] follow after charity."
[11:22] This is going to be follow hard after
[11:23] it, pursue it, desire spiritual gifts.
[11:26] He says, "But rather that ye may
[11:27] prophesy." Now here prophesy does not
[11:30] mean to just foretell future events and
[11:32] tell someone or predict something that's
[11:33] going to happen in the future. But to
[11:35] prophesy is to open and apply the word
[11:38] of God.
[11:39] And he's saying that this and this is
[11:41] something that we all must do and
[11:43] desire. We ought to all desire that we
[11:46] could prophesy in that we could
[11:49] understand the word of God and apply it
[11:52] and that that is greater than tongues.
[11:55] Oh,
[11:57] I'm going to scramble here and dig deep
[11:59] into my notes. That would be greater
[12:01] than just speaking in tonesues. Is to
[12:03] understand the word of God and apply it
[12:05] to my life. Understand the word of God
[12:06] and apply it to my life. And if you can
[12:08] do that with while speaking in tonesues,
[12:09] fantastic. But the best thing that we
[12:11] could do is to hear to recognize and
[12:13] hear and have an understanding, have a
[12:15] knowledge of and then an adherence to
[12:17] the pure word of God. So he's saying not
[12:20] just have spiritual gifts and not just
[12:22] speak in tongues and not just manifest
[12:24] in the in the operation of gifts but
[12:26] rather prophesy which is to understand
[12:28] the word and make it applicable to
[12:29] yourself. But he says follow after
[12:32] charity. It's it's letting charity be
[12:35] that final aspiration that uh we can
[12:37] have gifts and we can manifest the gifts
[12:39] but I want to uh since it's the greatest
[12:41] as he's already said charity is the
[12:43] greatest make it your chief aim desire
[12:46] to fully possess this love that bears
[12:49] all things believes all things hopes all
[12:51] things desire to have this charity
[12:53] that'll never fail
[12:55] and Paul when he's speaking about
[12:56] charity he he's referring to it as a
[12:59] thing as almost an entity in itself and
[13:01] he uses nothing to say he's He's saying
[13:03] agape. So he could have just said love
[13:05] bears all things and love hopes all
[13:07] things and love endures all things and
[13:08] love thinks no evil and and and he's
[13:10] just speaking of love but it's it speaks
[13:12] of it in such a way to where it seems to
[13:14] be neutral. He's saying oh does that
[13:17] mean my love? Does that what what does
[13:20] this even mean? What does it even
[13:21] represent? And Paul is speaking I
[13:23] believe very particular and precise
[13:25] about God who is love
[13:28] an essential quality of God. He said you
[13:30] should desire this. So love should be
[13:33] and bear with me.
[13:37] This has been uh this has been very
[13:39] instructive for me because I I have
[13:43] somewhat of a complex against how love
[13:45] is preached and and how we could just
[13:47] turn love into something that it's not.
[13:50] Uh I preached a sermon one time called
[13:52] love is not what you think it is. And so
[13:55] I might end up repreaching that just to
[13:57] you know maybe catharsis for me after I
[13:59] preach these things. But love should be
[14:01] our supreme pursuit.
[14:05] And and and and I know there's a part of
[14:06] the my carnal nature that when it says
[14:08] that it wrestles with all the different
[14:11] places somebody could go with that, but
[14:13] I feel comfortable in saying that if God
[14:14] is love, then that should be our supreme
[14:18] pursuit.
[14:20] We should pursue this as Paul is saying,
[14:22] we should pursue after this thing, this
[14:25] charity that exceeds all other gifts.
[14:29] And so that's this love he's talking
[14:32] about. Now in 1 John 4:18, and this will
[14:36] kind of be the our turning point where
[14:38] we begin to turn towards our subject
[14:39] today, our specific title today. We've
[14:43] read this already. It says, "There is no
[14:44] fear in love, but perfect love casteth
[14:48] out fear." And then he gives us
[14:50] tremendous uh meat to chew on because
[14:52] fear hath torment. and saying, "Yeah,
[14:54] where where how could there be perfect
[14:55] love and there still be this existing
[14:57] torment?" So, he says, "He that fearth
[14:59] is not made perfect in love." This is
[15:02] the only place that I could find the
[15:03] phrase perfect love used in the New
[15:06] Testament. Uh there's a lot of different
[15:09] ways that love is translated and
[15:11] connected back to the Greek through the
[15:12] Hebrew and the Old Testament. Even in
[15:14] that I couldn't find anything that
[15:16] expresses this precisely this perfect
[15:19] love. This tellios which is a full age
[15:21] and maturity full and complete and agape
[15:24] which is love and charity. This full
[15:26] charity this full mature love. This is
[15:28] the only place that this phrase perfect
[15:30] love is used. And now perfect love as
[15:33] we've already said before is a vast
[15:35] subject and it's a fascinating subject
[15:37] to study. And I know already that I
[15:40] could take any one of you out to lunch
[15:42] today and fellowship on the subject of
[15:45] perfect love. And from the youngest to
[15:46] the oldest and even newcomers, they
[15:49] could find scriptures and things that
[15:50] they have been taught from the word of
[15:52] God and many statements from the message
[15:54] of the hour that could add to our our
[15:57] knowledge base of what we know about
[15:59] perfect love. And it's easy maybe to
[16:02] recite a lot of definitive statements
[16:04] about perfect love. And we know this is
[16:06] perfect love. And perfect love casteth
[16:07] out fear. And if you have fear, you
[16:09] don't have perfect love. And there's a
[16:11] lot of things that we could say that we
[16:12] feel is, hey, this is black and white.
[16:14] This is what brother Brandham said. But,
[16:16] you know, I'll say this. It's easy to
[16:18] remember those sayings and and quote the
[16:20] scriptures and even recite Brother
[16:21] Brandham, but much harder to grasp
[16:24] when you begin to contemplate fully what
[16:27] the Bible means and what it's referring
[16:29] to. And I would say it's elusive both in
[16:32] understanding and in our sense of having
[16:34] it when we really begin to ponder what
[16:37] it is. Say, "Oh, I the Holy Ghost is
[16:40] perfect love. I've got perfect love.
[16:41] I've got the Holy Ghost. I've got
[16:43] perfect love." And then we look at what
[16:45] what perfect love is. And we find
[16:46] ourselves maybe saying, "Well, you know
[16:48] what? It's really easy to say that, but
[16:51] harder to fully appreciate whether or
[16:53] not I have it."
[16:54] That's right.
[16:55] Because perfect love is just it's
[16:57] there's there's something ultimate to
[16:59] it. in Satan's Eden. He's speaking of
[17:01] Adam and the woman. If you want to uh uh
[17:05] even in your own personal devotion and
[17:07] study, begin to consider some of these
[17:08] things at the beginning. I uh I want I'd
[17:10] like to pick up on the subject very
[17:12] soon. He says they were wholly veiled.
[17:14] They were safe in God's pavilion. Now,
[17:17] this is one of the subjects I want to
[17:18] address, safety. He says they were
[17:20] alive. So, now life and safety. They had
[17:23] no death around them. He says,
[17:25] "Hallelujah. They had perfect love one
[17:27] for the other." So now this is a Adam
[17:29] has a perfect love for the woman. The
[17:31] woman has a perfect love for him. And
[17:32] then he says perfect life forever. So
[17:35] there's something about this perfect
[17:37] love that is necessary to perfect life.
[17:40] And you say, "Well, we got that
[17:41] backwards. Perfect life begats perfect
[17:43] love." Fine. However you want to put it.
[17:45] There there there's a co there's a
[17:46] mutual dependency upon these conditions
[17:49] of perfect love and perfect life and
[17:51] safety and being alive. He said they had
[17:53] perfect love. And this is a statement
[17:55] that just wows me. perfect understanding
[17:57] of the love of God. So, not only does
[18:00] Adam love his wife perfectly, but the
[18:01] woman loves the Adam perfectly and they
[18:04] have perfect love one for another and
[18:05] that creates some sort of dynamo that
[18:07] creates some sort of power. But now they
[18:09] have a perfect understanding of the love
[18:11] of God. Says they had God's word and
[18:13] kept it. That phrase is not accidental.
[18:16] They have a perfect understanding of the
[18:18] love of God and they're keeping his
[18:20] commandments.
[18:21] He says they were alive. He comes back
[18:23] to it. They were alive and safe in God's
[18:25] Eden with no death at all around them.
[18:29] Perfect love. And this perfect
[18:31] understanding of the love of God made
[18:33] them feel safe.
[18:35] And I if at any time their perfect
[18:38] understanding of the love of God I is
[18:42] clouded then that hinders their sense of
[18:44] safety.
[18:46] It create creates if there is at any
[18:48] point a misunderstanding about God's
[18:50] love in having that sense of feeling
[18:52] safe. Once that's removed, they're
[18:54] exposed to this vulnerability.
[18:56] And in in feeling that vulnerability,
[18:58] uh, because of a misunderstanding of
[19:00] God's love, and I think maybe somebody's
[19:01] just already pulling me into this, and
[19:04] if it's necessary for us to to digest it
[19:06] right now, I could just go right into
[19:08] it. That once you misperceive someone's
[19:10] love and you lose the sense of safety
[19:13] and you feel vulnerability, it makes you
[19:15] reluctant to love to love. It it it
[19:19] makes you suspicious of love. it there
[19:21] it creates a different sense of feeling
[19:22] of oh if this is what love is I don't
[19:25] want it if this is what happens when you
[19:26] love I don't want to do it and so
[19:28] brother Brandham is introducing to us
[19:30] some very powerful principles to
[19:31] understand about what perfect love is
[19:34] and how that god must heal many things
[19:37] in our lives to bring us to that state
[19:39] to where we feel safe and we feel
[19:41] alivemen
[19:43] and so as brother Brandham describes it
[19:47] it's just so fascinating as Paul has
[19:49] said perfect love. It brings the state
[19:52] of perfect love. My title today is
[19:55] perfecting love.
[19:58] And with this, I want to do a
[20:01] foundational review of the love of God.
[20:05] Not a new look in any way at all. This
[20:07] is all going to be so elementary uh to
[20:10] you. You'll wonder what I was doing
[20:11] throughout the week. But it is a fresh
[20:14] look in some ways at perfect love.
[20:18] But I want to call it perfecting love.
[20:21] And let's look again at verse 18 that we
[20:24] just read. There is no fear in love, but
[20:27] perfect love casteth out fear because
[20:30] fear hath torment.
[20:32] He that fearth is not made perfect in
[20:35] love.
[20:38] Are you able to hear me? Okay. Up there
[20:39] in the balcony. Okay, good.
[20:43] Now I believe that it is our instinct
[20:46] when we read this and I imagine some
[20:48] have already kind of engaged on some
[20:49] level with this thought process is that
[20:51] we've looked at it as a formula some
[20:53] sort of mathematic formula there is no
[20:55] fear in love because and perfect love
[20:58] casteth out fear and so if you have fear
[21:02] you don't have love and so we use this
[21:05] scripture if I can say as a litmus test
[21:06] where we have something that can test
[21:08] something and then it once you apply uh
[21:11] apply it to strip or you use the litmus
[21:14] uh to indicate the presence of some
[21:16] chemical once it flashes that color and
[21:18] gives you that signal you're like oh
[21:20] okay this proves uh proves something
[21:23] that's what we use a litmus test for and
[21:25] even just using it by way of analogy I
[21:28] think it's our instinct to create a
[21:30] litmus test from this scripture to
[21:32] determine whether we love God or whether
[21:34] we have love that there's no fear in
[21:36] love but perfect love casteth out fear
[21:38] so we ask ourselves do I have fear do I
[21:41] feel tor tormented at times. Are there
[21:43] times that I'm doubtful and I'm
[21:44] wrestling and I experience uh
[21:46] apprehension and dread and we ask
[21:48] ourselves do I have fear and we say if
[21:50] yes so we say yes then perfect love must
[21:54] be missing
[21:56] that there's must and you say that if I
[21:58] had if I had this perfect love in the
[22:00] way that we like to define it why would
[22:02] I still have fear
[22:06] come on I
[22:08] if this is true in your own life amens
[22:11] might help you break this
[22:12] bad thought process. If it's not true
[22:14] and you believe this, your amens may
[22:16] help somebody else overcome it because
[22:18] somebody may be sitting there saying,
[22:19] "Ah, there's no truth to this." And
[22:21] you're over there saying, "Amen."
[22:22] They're going, "Well, I don't know.
[22:24] Maybe now I'm the only one that's
[22:25] reluctant to this idea." So, your amens
[22:27] mean a lot more than just sick them to
[22:29] the preacher.
[22:30] Could signal to somebody they need to
[22:32] wake up. Wait a minute. Truth is being
[22:34] spoken.
[22:36] Maybe we're using a little peer
[22:37] pressure, a little hive mentality,
[22:40] right? the the power of the crowd when
[22:42] people start amening other people like
[22:45] brother Aaron may have something to say
[22:46] here what do you amen I like that
[22:51] so we have this tendency to use
[22:55] scriptures like this and and many other
[22:57] scriptures to where if it seems to be a
[22:59] very direct if this then that then we
[23:01] just look at it and say oh well if I
[23:03] have uh if I have fear then the Bible's
[23:07] saying that perfect love is cast out
[23:09] fear so then we say I don't have perfect
[23:11] love or he says that uh there's no fear
[23:14] in love. So now where does that put us?
[23:17] There's no fear in love so I don't even
[23:19] have love and then perfect love will
[23:21] cast out this fear. So then perfect love
[23:23] hasn't even been effective on me. And we
[23:25] really don't have any easy out in this
[23:27] scripture except to say you're you ain't
[23:29] kidding. Fear has torment.
[23:33] And then the Bible says in verse 16, if
[23:35] we just drop back a little bit, we have
[23:37] known and believed that love
[23:41] believe the love that God hath to us.
[23:44] God is love.
[23:45] And he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in
[23:47] God and God in him. So we have already
[23:49] been doing working the formula. We have
[23:51] already been writing it down. We have
[23:53] known and believed the love that God has
[23:54] to us. So I know it. I believe it. The
[23:56] love that God has to me. God is agape.
[23:58] God is love. And he that dwelleth in
[24:01] love dwelleth in God and God in him. So
[24:03] it's almost as if we have been rallied
[24:05] into this state of love is in me. I am
[24:08] in love. Isn't this lovely? Here we all
[24:10] are together in this state of love. And
[24:12] then he says there's no fear in love.
[24:14] And we're like wait a minute there's
[24:16] what now? There's no fear in love. And
[24:20] we say how can I have God then if I
[24:23] fear?
[24:24] How can I have love if I'm fearful at
[24:26] times? How can I put myself in this
[24:29] position? And this is where I'm saying
[24:30] maybe for some of you, you're thinking,
[24:32] man, this is just so elementary. Is
[24:34] brother Aaron really wrestling with
[24:35] these things and maybe we need to pray
[24:37] for him more than ever before.
[24:39] It I think it it's necessary to talk
[24:41] about these things and present things in
[24:43] such a way because I am taking a very
[24:45] complex subject and making as simple as
[24:47] I possibly can for you
[24:48] in a way that you could understand. How
[24:51] then do I have God or am I in God in God
[24:55] in God if I feel this?
[24:58] Why has my faith in God? I have known
[25:00] and believed the love that God has to
[25:01] me. Why has it not purged me of this
[25:03] fear? Why has it not purged me of
[25:05] anxiety and apprehension? Why is it that
[25:07] I could be in a state of torment at any
[25:09] time and sometimes for great lengths of
[25:10] time when I believe that I have the love
[25:13] of God that I am in him? And I think it
[25:15] begs the question and I don't know that
[25:16] it happens to all of us. Maybe our faith
[25:19] is strong and we're just able to rebuke
[25:20] the devil and maybe our understanding is
[25:22] large and we're able to place things
[25:23] where they ought to be as I hope to do
[25:25] today. But we could ask ourselves, do I
[25:27] really love him?
[25:29] Does he love me?
[25:31] What's the where's the crux of the
[25:32] where's where's the leak in this? How
[25:35] are these things seeping in to cause me
[25:38] to feel these things when I can look at
[25:40] the black and white of the scripture and
[25:41] says it says we've known and believe the
[25:42] love of God. And if we love God, we're
[25:44] in God and love is in us. And then it
[25:46] and then there's no fear in love. I I
[25:48] I'm just walking through the breadcrumbs
[25:50] here. And if there's no fear in love and
[25:52] I have fear, then am I not in love and
[25:54] love not in me? Where does it come from?
[25:57] And if I could just say this, and in no
[25:59] way do I want to belittle any of you,
[26:01] but some of us are no better at
[26:03] spiritual math than we are at natural
[26:05] math.
[26:07] And I would say that the carnal mind in
[26:09] general, just to make everybody feel
[26:10] good, is we are the carnal mind is not
[26:13] good at all when it comes to spiritual
[26:15] math
[26:16] just has a way of adding and multiplying
[26:18] and and dividing and subtracting and
[26:20] doing all of it incorrectly.
[26:22] And and what's even more remarkable is
[26:24] the carnal mind is willing to show you
[26:26] the work,
[26:28] right? It's not like they're just
[26:29] cheating and using a calculator and
[26:31] saying, "Oh, well, this is the answer."
[26:32] I mean, they'll walk you through it.
[26:34] Well, you know, God said this and
[26:35] Brother Brandham said that and this
[26:37] happened and that happened and they're
[26:38] pissing it all together and you're like,
[26:39] whoa, whoa. Looks like a conspiracy
[26:42] theory board, right? Looks like Lucas
[26:45] has been whiteboarding for a full week,
[26:48] right? You're like, whoa. All right. And
[26:50] it's and it's overwhelming. Like, man, I
[26:52] just don't even know if your premise is
[26:54] right.
[26:56] Because the carnal mind's not good at
[26:57] math,
[26:58] spiritual math.
[27:00] No offense, brother Preston.
[27:03] He was really good at math.
[27:07] But John, if I could say this now, just
[27:09] take the step forward. John is using
[27:12] love and if I can say love, he's using
[27:15] the noun and the verb love, agape and
[27:17] gapoa in different ways.
[27:20] And I believe it's very important for us
[27:22] to not just take agape and kind of lump
[27:25] it together as an all or nothing thing.
[27:27] That agape is just God's love.
[27:32] and agape is only divine love and
[27:35] recognize that the word love can be used
[27:38] in different context and we can't just
[27:40] take everything that he's saying about
[27:41] love and the love of God as to an all or
[27:43] nothing proposition
[27:45] and so this is a key that I I I think
[27:47] that you've already I've already
[27:49] referenced in reading our text and that
[27:50] you could pick up on if you go back and
[27:52] read these epistles of John reading all
[27:54] three is very good exercise in in in
[27:58] this subject
[27:59] but John is admonishing the believer.
[28:03] And if you look at what he begins with
[28:04] even in the first chapter, it it reads
[28:06] in the first verse, it's almost as if in
[28:08] the beginning was the word when he
[28:10] speaks of we have known the word of life
[28:12] from the beginning. And and he's
[28:15] admonishing
[28:17] a manifestation of the love of God.
[28:19] Because notice the real theme is John
[28:21] the love apostle they might call him.
[28:24] He's not he's not so much dealing and
[28:26] opening up and revealing the love of God
[28:29] as much as he's admonishing the
[28:31] believers who love God to show that love
[28:33] to other people
[28:35] and that he's looking at maybe this this
[28:38] channel this oneway channel and this uh
[28:40] love feast and this charity between the
[28:42] believer and God and he's saying that's
[28:45] wonderful but this relationship
[28:49] if it's real it then begins to work
[28:52] outward
[28:54] and this love affair that you're having
[28:56] with God, this is the kind of that's the
[28:58] love that you want to show to mankind,
[29:00] even if it's against our instinct. So,
[29:03] he's admonishing a manifestation of
[29:05] love. I would even say maybe a greater
[29:06] manifestation of love or a very
[29:08] particular love towards one another and
[29:10] to the brethren. And he's presupposing
[29:12] some fundamental knowledge of love. He's
[29:15] already assuming some fundamental
[29:17] foundation of the word of life. So John
[29:20] is not introducing Christ. He's not
[29:23] introducing Christianity. He's not
[29:27] challenging them in their experience to
[29:29] say, "See, aha, you don't know God."
[29:31] He's dealing with them as if to say that
[29:35] this love affair that you have with God,
[29:37] there's a practical outwork. And if you
[29:39] say there is an agape to your love as a
[29:41] noun, there is an agape verb to that
[29:44] same love. Yes.
[29:47] And so he uses the love of God or the
[29:50] love of the father or even his love as
[29:53] he might refer to it. Um
[29:56] we see his says his love is how he the
[30:00] phrase he uses it can have different
[30:02] meanings. It's making different
[30:03] emphasis. He's making different points
[30:06] and even have different holders of it or
[30:08] origins of it.
[30:10] So here are three different loves that I
[30:13] think we could categorize what we read
[30:14] today into.
[30:16] There is the love that is God
[30:19] and it is an attribute of God and it's
[30:22] that love that is whether it be
[30:23] manifested by him or through his
[30:25] children. There is that love which God
[30:27] is love. There is that charity which is
[30:30] God and essential. It's an attribute and
[30:31] a characteristic of God that we would
[30:33] attribute to God. And that is a love
[30:36] that John is referring to. There's also
[30:39] the love that God shows.
[30:41] So it's not necessarily the love that
[30:43] God is as Paul uses it now. He's using
[30:46] it in the sense of love that God shows
[30:48] or a love that God declares or a love
[30:50] that God manifests. So God John could
[30:53] refer to the love that God has or the
[30:55] love that God is. But now he refers to
[30:58] love in such a way that it's a love that
[30:59] God shows and manifested or it's like
[31:02] love being projected. And and we can all
[31:04] relate to this. They say, "Well, I love
[31:06] my I I I I I love my wife or I am I I
[31:11] have shown love to her." There's
[31:12] different ways that you're speaking in a
[31:15] sense that one speaks of something that
[31:16] is more internal or it is what it is.
[31:18] It's a particular state. But then
[31:20] there's a love which he's speaking about
[31:21] and he's using it in a way to say this
[31:23] is the love that's being projected. This
[31:24] is the love that's being shown.
[31:26] So those are two different ways that
[31:27] John is referring to love agape. But
[31:30] then there's also the love which is to
[31:32] God.
[31:35] Okay. There's a love that is that we
[31:36] would have for God. It's a love which
[31:38] God of which God is the object.
[31:40] So you have the love which is God. You
[31:43] have the love that God shows to an
[31:44] object. Then you have the love that we
[31:46] have that is to God as the object. And
[31:49] guess what? You can say all three of
[31:52] those with the same phrase. The love of
[31:54] God, the love of God, the love of God.
[31:57] And the one is the love which God is.
[31:59] The other is the love that God shows.
[32:01] And the other one's the love that you
[32:02] have for God. And we use the same phrase
[32:04] to describe three different things.
[32:06] Amen.
[32:07] And you mean and you and it's kind of
[32:09] like the adjective using of. Well, is it
[32:11] theirs or is it where how who is it? Is
[32:13] it my love for God or is it his love
[32:15] that is his possessive? Is it something
[32:17] too or something possessed?
[32:20] And so there is the love which is of
[32:22] which God is the object not his love for
[32:24] us but our love for him. And agape is
[32:26] used in the same context.
[32:29] So with those three different categories
[32:33] uh and I'm not trying to be
[32:34] oversimplistic and I'm not trying to
[32:35] introduce some rigid structure that we
[32:37] must abide by uh semantically. I think
[32:40] that's just practical to think of it
[32:42] that way.
[32:43] So now in verse 81 17 we've read there's
[32:46] no fear in love. Perfect love casteth
[32:48] out fear. Now verse 17, excuse me, verse
[32:51] 12,
[32:53] uh, verse 12, backing up a little bit,
[32:55] says, "No man hath seen God at any time.
[32:58] If we love one another," and that's just
[33:01] agape, so it's not necessarily a verb.
[33:03] It's it's something I have. If I have
[33:04] this love for one another, God dwelleth
[33:07] in us, and his love, which is the verb,
[33:10] is perfected in us.
[33:12] Now, maybe I've already conditioned you
[33:15] to not be so quick to create a litmus
[33:17] test. But this presents to us another
[33:20] easy formula to say, "Aha, okay, if we
[33:24] love one another, his love is perfected
[33:27] in us." And so if I don't love somebody,
[33:31] right? We all know who we're thinking
[33:32] about, right? I'm kidding. Uh if we all
[33:37] if we don't love somebody, then it's we
[33:40] get this rub, right? It's like, "Oh,
[33:42] well, I could tell you very clearly in
[33:44] plain language, I don't think I love
[33:45] them." Then we say, "Oh, well then this
[33:47] love isn't perfected in us." But let me
[33:50] warn you again. This isn't a quick test
[33:52] to say whether or not you have
[33:54] something.
[33:56] Saying if we love agape each other, then
[33:59] God abides in us. And God's agapeo, the
[34:04] the verb is perfected in us. So if we
[34:08] love one another, he's saying if we love
[34:10] one another, you got to you got to back
[34:11] up a little bit because what we do is we
[34:13] say, "Oh, if we love one another, we
[34:15] love God." But he's actually backing us
[34:17] up.
[34:18] Yeah.
[34:19] Just saying that God's love is perfected
[34:21] in us and it should manifest itself in
[34:25] that we're loving one another.
[34:27] That should just We should just go to
[34:28] lunch.
[34:30] Wait, really? I I think I know what you
[34:33] meant. We that that just seals it to
[34:35] look at it that way that Paul is not
[34:37] making our loved one for another as the
[34:39] cart that gets us to loving God, but
[34:41] rather it's God this aging
[34:44] in us, this activity in us that causes
[34:46] us to love one another.
[34:48] And so this is where I drew my
[34:50] inspiration to title it this way. And I
[34:52] know maybe linguistically it's kind of
[34:54] clumsy and I love the debate on it, our
[34:56] wordsmiths who'd like to talk about uh
[34:59] superlatives and comparatives. But the
[35:01] highlights, this highlights and
[35:03] emphasizes something about love. Because
[35:06] in one place there's a love that we
[35:08] have, but then there's a love that's
[35:09] being expressed and one is the love that
[35:11] we have for each other. But this other
[35:12] is his love being perfected in us. And I
[35:15] think there's different ways we can look
[35:16] at this and I will and I'm not
[35:18] schizophrenic and how I'm addressing it.
[35:19] There's just it's just that round.
[35:22] There's just that much to it. But love
[35:25] is a perfecting love. Amen.
[35:29] It is a perfecting love. I I just think
[35:32] that we should be remiss to
[35:36] take
[35:37] uh we need to be very careful to not
[35:39] just think that charity is what it is
[35:41] and agape is what it is and we've just
[35:43] been able to sum it all up and I know
[35:45] exactly what it is and realize that
[35:47] there's probably more to it than we
[35:49] could ever imagine. Especially if God
[35:52] has somehow someway said he is it
[35:57] because God is a God that hides himself.
[35:59] He's a God that's going to be revealing
[36:00] himself and unfolding himself through
[36:01] all eternity. So then we could just kind
[36:03] of admit admit doing that low-level
[36:06] mathematics to say, you know what, I'm
[36:08] willing to admit I don't know everything
[36:10] about love.
[36:11] But love is a perfecting love. Recognize
[36:14] this. If we love one another, God
[36:16] dwelleth in us and his love is perfected
[36:19] in us. That word perfected means is
[36:22] translated to finish or fulfill.
[36:25] It means to make perfect, to complete,
[36:28] to finish. The the the meaning behind
[36:32] perfect here this tells what it's what
[36:34] it's re representing is the
[36:36] accomplishment of some proposed goal.
[36:40] If it means to bring to an end, to
[36:42] accomplish to finish, then I want you to
[36:44] think of this. There has to be a finish
[36:47] line.
[36:48] When you fill something up and finish it
[36:50] and someone says, "Hey, I want you to
[36:52] put water in that cup and you say,
[36:54] "Well, how much do you want it?" Fill it
[36:56] up.
[36:58] Fill up to the line. Finish it. Complete
[36:59] it. You know, there's you know that
[37:01] there's a starting point. You know that
[37:02] there's a finishing point. And this
[37:03] perfection assumes that there's some
[37:07] filling up. There's some accomplishment.
[37:09] There's some purpose that's being
[37:10] accomplished. So, when we think of
[37:13] something being perfect, it's ideal for
[37:16] its purposes. It's oh when do we not say
[37:19] that when we say oh I I I I I need I
[37:21] need something to do this and someone
[37:23] says what about this you go that's
[37:24] perfect
[37:26] why because it's suits it's good for
[37:29] what you need to do
[37:30] so perfection and here when it says his
[37:32] love is perfected in us it relates to
[37:34] function it relates to purpose so let's
[37:37] think about this when John writes
[37:41] because I I would I propose that when he
[37:43] says no man hath seen God at any time so
[37:46] there's this general sense of humanity.
[37:48] Then if we love one another, that kind
[37:50] of narrows it down to us. God dwelleth
[37:53] in us. And he says in his love that's
[37:55] perfected in us,
[37:58] that it
[38:01] that one could argue who his love is,
[38:04] whether he's speaking to us
[38:05] individualistically,
[38:07] whether it's now this corporal body, all
[38:09] of us as believers uh uh together in
[38:12] this. But if we read it in in terms of
[38:15] how it sounds to us since it relates to
[38:18] purpose and function, read it this way.
[38:20] God dwelleth in us and his love is being
[38:24] accomplished.
[38:27] If we love God and then we love one
[38:30] another, his love is being perfected.
[38:34] His love is accomplishing its goal.
[38:37] Because in no place did God establish
[38:40] that he wanted us to have some sort of
[38:43] cultish relationship with him
[38:46] and then uh you know wall ourselves off
[38:49] from everybody else. But even despite
[38:52] the fact that all will not be saved, he
[38:55] desires that his love would be made
[38:57] known to all.
[38:59] Amen.
[39:00] And so he this this love his love is
[39:03] accomplished. Like this love I have for
[39:05] you when it's expressed to others. I'm
[39:07] like there you go.
[39:09] That's it.
[39:11] So in John chapter 13:es 34 and 35.
[39:15] Man, brother Michael, I didn't know you
[39:16] song service was so long.
[39:19] I can't believe it's already 11:30.
[39:22] Getting me up here at 11 like that.
[39:23] That's that's unfair.
[39:26] John 13:es 34 and 35. A new commandment
[39:30] I give unto you that you love one
[39:31] another. How is this a new commandment?
[39:33] Well, he had it's prefaced prior and in
[39:36] the very obvious in Deuteronomy and
[39:38] places in the scripture, thou shalt love
[39:39] the Lord thy God.
[39:41] And so he says, I got one for you that
[39:43] you love one another
[39:46] as I have loved you. That you also love
[39:49] one another. Now, this is active. This
[39:51] is the verb. That you love one another
[39:53] as I have loved you. That you also love
[39:55] one another. So, this is my desire that
[39:57] you love one another. Well, how? Well,
[39:59] as I have loved you, you also love one
[40:02] another. So, there's love projected to
[40:04] me. As love has been projected to me, I
[40:06] need to project it to somebody else and
[40:07] these other brethren. By this shall all
[40:09] men know that you are my disciples if
[40:11] you agape. Now, it's the noun have love
[40:15] one to another. Right?
[40:17] It's almost as if when he says it, he
[40:19] doesn't mind using it in a state and and
[40:22] a possession that when you have love one
[40:24] for another, it's going to be shown as a
[40:27] verb to the other.
[40:29] So when John is saying if we love one
[40:31] another, his love is being perfected in
[40:32] us. If I could say it this way, love is
[40:34] working.
[40:36] Love is working. In 1 John 2:5, it says,
[40:39] "But who so keepeth his word, in him
[40:42] verily is the love of God perfected."
[40:45] hereby know that we are in him. Now,
[40:48] this is again
[40:50] I I was going to start in chapter 2 but
[40:51] just kind of got moved into chapter four
[40:53] as the starting point but said the
[40:55] person who keeps God's word in that
[40:59] person is the love of God perfected. So
[41:02] again it's it's a kind of taking God's
[41:05] love being perfected in the individual.
[41:08] If we obey and keep his word, our love
[41:11] for God is working.
[41:14] Uh the love he has for us, his purpose
[41:16] is being accomplished. If we keep his
[41:18] word in him, is the love of God
[41:19] perfected? Now remember the phrase the
[41:22] love of God. Now is that the love he has
[41:24] for us or is that the love we have for
[41:27] him?
[41:29] John chapter 14 23 and 24. Just remember
[41:32] that if you keep my word in you is the
[41:34] love of God perfected.
[41:38] Jesus answered and said unto them, if a
[41:40] man love me, he will keep my words and
[41:43] my father will love him and will come
[41:46] unto him and make our abode with him. He
[41:50] that loveth and these are the active in
[41:52] the act of working sense. He that loveth
[41:54] me,
[41:57] he that loveth me not keepeth not my
[42:00] sayings. And the word which you hear is
[42:02] not mine, but the father which sent me.
[42:03] So these things I'm saying. This just
[42:05] isn't my godly here. This is God
[42:07] telling you this.
[42:08] If a man loves me, if you love me, now
[42:10] just think of how pure this formula is.
[42:12] All our mathematicians could just tell
[42:14] you so easily. If a man loves me, he
[42:16] keeps my words.
[42:17] It's that plain, that simple. If you
[42:19] love me, you keep my words. If you love
[42:20] me, you keep my words. And so this is
[42:22] the love who whosoever keepeth his word
[42:25] and him verily is the love of God
[42:26] perfected. I believe that John is
[42:28] drawing from these very things. Now when
[42:31] the love that's being used both of the
[42:33] love that we would have to God again
[42:35] it's coming from this agape.
[42:38] And remember as we've taught on agape
[42:40] before that this love is not rooted in
[42:43] just our base affections and emotions as
[42:46] a person. And that to use the sense of
[42:47] agape that that in as it relates to the
[42:50] love of God or the that we would have
[42:52] for God or the love that we would God
[42:53] would have to us. It's a love of
[42:55] intelligence.
[42:57] It's a it's a it has some sort of reason
[42:59] and comprehension. I would even go so
[43:01] far as to say that if the word is used
[43:03] in a carnal sense in other words this is
[43:05] a love that has some sort of
[43:06] corresponding purpose to it that it's
[43:09] joined to to a greater utility. And so
[43:12] the Bible is saying that love can be
[43:14] summarized as doing God's will.
[43:17] So we express our love for God or our
[43:19] love to God in that we uh that we do
[43:22] what he wants us to do and our doing his
[43:26] will expresses our love to God and it
[43:28] manifests his love for us. Does that
[43:30] make sense?
[43:32] That God loves me. I do his will. That
[43:35] that this expression of his love to me
[43:37] is what causes me to act in doing his
[43:39] will. In me doing his will, it expresses
[43:41] my love back to him.
[43:42] Right? Amen.
[43:43] And so love is doing God's will. And in
[43:45] doing his will, I'm expressing love to
[43:47] God. And I'm also manifesting the love
[43:49] of God that he has for me. 1 John 5:1-3,
[43:52] "Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the
[43:54] Christ is born of God. And everyone that
[43:56] loveth him that begat loveth him also
[43:59] that is begotten of him." Now, that
[44:01] would be where John is trying to say, if
[44:03] you love him that begat, then you love
[44:07] him who's also begotten of him. that
[44:08] there's there's this mutual love that
[44:10] should be shared when you love someone.
[44:12] By this we know that we love the
[44:14] children of God when we love God. What
[44:17] is John's aim overall? Not so much that
[44:20] we learn and know and understand because
[44:21] he says we have known and believed the
[44:23] love that God has to us. I think we're
[44:24] coming to that in a moment. So it's not
[44:26] that love that he's trying to get
[44:27] straight. It's the fact that maybe it's
[44:28] not working like it ought to. So he says
[44:32] that that we love by this we know that
[44:35] we love the children of God when we love
[44:37] God and keep his commandments. Notice
[44:39] how he's taking John 13, John 14, he's
[44:42] marrying these things together. We know
[44:43] that we love the children of God when we
[44:45] love God and keep his commandments. For
[44:47] this is the love of God that we keep his
[44:50] commandments and his commandments are
[44:51] not grievious.
[44:53] So keeping God's commandments is the
[44:54] evidence of love to God. And there in
[44:57] keeping it's not heavy. It's not
[44:58] burdensome. It's not dreadful.
[45:00] And so I think I'll be reading a
[45:03] statement here in a moment. I think
[45:04] brother Brandham says it very very
[45:06] precisely. It's very very good. But it
[45:08] is
[45:10] it would just be so empty just be vanity
[45:13] to pretend to love God and not do what
[45:15] he asked.
[45:17] It's shallow. It's empty. There's no
[45:19] substance to it to pretend to love God
[45:21] and live opposite to his word.
[45:23] To say that I love God. Now this this
[45:25] could be harsh. to say that I love God
[45:26] and then reject the clear prescription
[45:28] in scripture that he's given us. That
[45:30] begs the question, but do you really
[45:33] to say that you love and don't do what
[45:35] he asked it? There there's something
[45:38] shallow about that.
[45:40] In second John verse 6, and this is love
[45:43] that we walk after his commandments.
[45:44] Now, when he writes to him again, he's
[45:45] reaffirming what Christ has already
[45:47] taught previously. This is love.
[45:50] This is this is how our love is shown or
[45:52] this is what his love produces that we
[45:54] live after his word.
[45:55] This is the commandment that you have
[45:57] heard from the beginning. Ye should walk
[45:59] in it.
[46:01] So love for God, if I could put it,
[46:03] God's love for us and our love for God
[46:04] necessarily accomplishes produces us
[46:07] doing his will. This love and this
[46:09] dynamic of love, this love relationship
[46:11] between you and the Lord. The love he
[46:13] shares to you, the love you express back
[46:14] to him, it necessarily produces us
[46:18] accomplishing and doing his will.
[46:23] Brother Brandham says in the church age
[46:24] book, he says, "People say they love
[46:25] God. They go to church. They even shout
[46:27] and rejoice and sing and have great
[46:28] emotional time. But when it's all over,
[46:31] watch and see if they're in that word,
[46:32] walking in it, living in it." Right.
[46:38] There's a there's a tendency to take a
[46:41] template of what a church service should
[46:43] look like
[46:44] and take a snippet of time that could be
[46:47] recorded from opening prayer to closing
[46:49] prayer and say that this
[46:52] this is the bride.
[46:54] This is what she looks like.
[46:57] when actually that should pro could just
[47:01] be absolutely unknown to anybody other
[47:03] than those that were there and just
[47:04] watch their life afterwards and you'll
[47:06] know whether or not it's the bride's
[47:07] revival,
[47:09] right?
[47:11] It's the life that is lived
[47:13] and it's the life that is fed through
[47:15] our church experiences through special
[47:17] meetings, through prayer, the the
[47:18] manifestation of the gifts and the
[47:19] things that God uses to charge us and
[47:21] wash us and encourage us. But that that
[47:23] is not the window into the bride's
[47:26] revival.
[47:28] That that is that is part of God. Our
[47:31] church is a part of God fueling our
[47:33] revival because brother Ben Brandon is
[47:34] saying, "Hey, it's great when we shout,
[47:36] great when we dance, great when we do
[47:37] all these things, but watch and see if
[47:38] they're in that word, walking in it,
[47:41] living in it." That's that's what we
[47:43] want to see. Amen.
[47:44] He says if they go through all the other
[47:46] and they don't walk in that word, if
[47:48] they refuse to walk further in the
[47:50] light, you know, there's times when you
[47:52] use phrases of Pentecostal and
[47:53] Pentecostalism and and it can get very
[47:56] very confusing because there's a true
[47:57] Pentecostal, there's a true there's a
[47:59] true Pentecostal, there's truths of the
[48:01] Pentecost of Leodysia, there's truth of
[48:03] the Pentecost in the first church. Uh,
[48:05] and there's even a true Pentecostal
[48:06] experience now that exists. And there's
[48:08] a true manifestation of the gifts. And
[48:09] so there's ways that we use all these
[48:11] different phrases and we could put a
[48:12] scarlet letter on one of them. But if
[48:14] there's anything that's a negative
[48:15] that's negative connotation of
[48:17] Pentecostalism that brother Bam
[48:19] identifies, it's refusing to walk
[48:21] further in the light.
[48:23] Has nothing to do with the song
[48:24] services. Has nothing to do with the
[48:26] manner of worship. Has nothing to do
[48:27] with the expression of the gifts. Has
[48:28] nothing to do with tongues and
[48:29] prophecies. It's just do they fail to
[48:32] walk further in the light.
[48:35] He says if they go through all the other
[48:37] and don't walk in that word, they can
[48:39] say they love God, but their lives tell
[48:42] another story.
[48:45] I can't remember what scripture it was,
[48:46] even what series it was that we're
[48:48] preaching on, but there was uh I was
[48:50] looking at it was a different statement
[48:52] very similar to this. And it's striking
[48:54] when you consider martyrs even in modern
[48:57] times for pseudo Christian causes.
[49:02] They're willing to fight for Christ,
[49:04] carry a gun for Christ, kill for Christ,
[49:07] go to war for Christ, but not live for
[49:09] him.
[49:11] They're they're willing to crusade for
[49:13] him but not live by his word. That's
[49:15] exactly what brother B said. They could
[49:16] say they love God,
[49:18] willing to die for him, willing to fight
[49:19] for him, but not willing to live by his
[49:21] word.
[49:24] So when John says, now we're coming back
[49:26] to verse 18 here. When John says his
[49:29] love is perfected in us, I want us to
[49:32] better understand this because remember
[49:34] I kind of I I kind of couched it this
[49:35] way that we're going to do a litmus test
[49:37] that if I have fear, I don't have love.
[49:40] But when John refers to his love is
[49:42] perfected in us, he's connecting it with
[49:44] our knowledge of him. Love is connected
[49:45] with knowledge. I got to get through
[49:46] this part and and then we'll be uh
[49:50] yeah we we'll be further along.
[49:54] In first John chapter 2 verses 3 and
[49:56] four. I think this is very important to
[49:58] catch here that John is not just
[49:59] connecting love to just some sort of
[50:02] feeling that's going to wash over me
[50:04] that I just let my mind go blank and all
[50:06] of a sudden
[50:08] I got perfect love.
[50:11] He's connecting it something something
[50:12] different. Right.
[50:14] Says in 1 John 2:3-4, "Hereby we know
[50:17] that we know him.
[50:19] If we keep his commandments,
[50:23] he saith, I know he that saith, I know
[50:25] him," and keepeth not his commandments,
[50:26] is a liar, and the truth is not in him.
[50:30] Now,
[50:32] make sure I'm in the right spot here
[50:36] because there's just uh I might be able
[50:38] to I might be able to cut this short a
[50:40] little bit.
[50:47] I want to be sure that we use Yeah. So
[50:49] we This is So the I'm I'm wanting to
[50:52] marry verse 18
[50:54] that his fear that there's no that
[50:57] perfect love casteth out fear. He that
[50:59] fearth is not made perfect in love. So
[51:01] there's a making perfect in love that's
[51:04] contra contrasting the fear. But when he
[51:06] says whosoever keepeth his word in him
[51:08] verily is the love of God perfected. And
[51:10] it's that phrase, the love of God
[51:12] perfected, that we're thinking about, do
[51:14] I have perfect love? Do I have perfect
[51:15] love? Do I have love? Is God's love,
[51:17] perfect love, working on me? And so, we
[51:19] create all these requirements. But when
[51:21] he says this, in him, verily is the love
[51:24] of God perfected. Notice these prior
[51:26] verses he's running through this. If we
[51:28] we hereby do know that we know him if we
[51:30] keep his commandments. So, he's saying
[51:32] we know we know him when we do his word.
[51:34] So, our obeying his word is based upon
[51:35] knowledge and our doing his word is an
[51:37] expression of love.
[51:40] But then he says,"I know he that says I
[51:42] know him and keeps not his commandments
[51:44] is a liar and the truth is not in him."
[51:46] So we would expect, this is maybe just
[51:48] me, but we would expect that if he's
[51:50] saying, "He that says I know him and
[51:51] doesn't do his word, he is a liar and
[51:53] the truth is not in him." We would
[51:54] expect that he would say, "And he that
[51:56] keeps his word, he is the truth and he
[51:59] has the truth in him."
[52:00] Right? And if if we're just going to
[52:02] take this logical construction and you
[52:04] know fill in the blanks and follow the
[52:05] pattern 2 four blank 8 10 like you know
[52:08] oh oh I know it goes there six goes
[52:10] there and if we're trying to follow the
[52:11] pattern instead of John saying and he
[52:14] that keeps his word he is the truth or
[52:16] the truth is in him he says in him has
[52:18] the love of God been perfected. So it's
[52:20] somewhat of a pattern interrupt where
[52:22] you're following him logically but then
[52:23] he kind of he just leans another way and
[52:26] he's saying that oh but to him who obeys
[52:28] in him is the love of God being
[52:30] perfected. Why? Again knowledge and love
[52:32] are being connected together.
[52:34] So in in one sense he's saying that our
[52:37] obedience is the product of his love.
[52:41] In one sense he's saying that our
[52:43] obedience is the product if I could say
[52:44] of his perfect love. Let me say this is
[52:47] beautiful. Has so many different layers.
[52:49] There's just so much if you want to just
[52:51] start moving up and down the elevator of
[52:53] this thought in God's word. It's very
[52:55] very beautiful all the touch points and
[52:56] ways that you could look at this. But
[52:58] he's saying that obeying God's word
[53:01] is that and I want to say perfect work
[53:03] but is that perfect work that love is
[53:06] accomplishing and fulfilling in us
[53:09] that this is what love is doing. His
[53:12] love for me is working something inside
[53:15] of me. Causing that's the work of love.
[53:19] Isn't that why people don't understand
[53:21] God's love?
[53:22] Because he said, "Well, if he loves you,
[53:23] why does he let that happen?" Because
[53:25] they're saying, "What is love?" If I
[53:27] just say, "I love you."
[53:30] Like, okay,
[53:32] awesome,
[53:33] right? That's great. You love me. And
[53:36] then there's just there there's no
[53:37] evidence of it. It's like, I told you. I
[53:39] told you I love you. Is that not enough?
[53:42] And you can say, well, I mean, at least
[53:44] God killed his son, right? That's how he
[53:47] showed his love to me. He didn't just
[53:50] say it and leave it at that.
[53:51] He proved it.
[53:54] He showed it. So, obeying God's word is
[53:58] the work of love in in us. I can say it
[54:00] this way since love, perfect love
[54:02] relates to purpose. The purpose of God's
[54:04] love is being accomplished in those who
[54:07] are keeping his word. When you see
[54:09] somebody lining up with the word of God,
[54:10] you say, "Now that's the evidence. That
[54:13] is the evidence." When someone is the
[54:14] word is being opened up to them and
[54:16] they're walking and living in the word
[54:17] of God, that's God's love working.
[54:22] So when we look at perfect love,
[54:27] this is this is just super logical as we
[54:29] bring this to a close. God's love for us
[54:31] is already perfect,
[54:33] right? If we say the love of God and
[54:36] we're talking about the love that God
[54:37] is, that's already perfect. So you don't
[54:39] have the love of God and then the
[54:41] perfect love of God when it comes to who
[54:43] he is being love. And there's the love
[54:45] that God has for us. It's already
[54:47] perfect. It cannot be made perfect or
[54:50] perfected.
[54:51] And this perfect love that he has for us
[54:53] has a purpose. It has an activity. It
[54:55] has an intelligence. It is perfecting.
[55:00] It is making complete. It is making
[55:02] whole. It has this drive and this desire
[55:04] that I love you and my love which is
[55:08] perfect is not going to be perfected or
[55:10] complete or have accomplished its goal
[55:13] until so we can say I have a perfect
[55:15] love but now it's a perfecting love
[55:17] because it's not going to rest until you
[55:20] are made whole.
[55:22] Come on somebody. We widen the aisle so
[55:24] we can get some activity. That this is
[55:27] something to step in an aisle and say,
[55:29] shout hallelujah to that his love for me
[55:31] is perfect, but it won't rest until it
[55:35] is perfected.
[55:36] Not his love, but its purpose.
[55:40] It says in first John 19, we love him
[55:43] because he first loved us.
[55:46] We love him because he first loved us.
[55:49] That means for the reason we love him
[55:52] and the cause of our love for him is
[55:55] solely his love for us.
[55:58] God's love for us causes our love for
[56:01] him. It's what inspires our love for
[56:03] him. It's what instigates our love for
[56:05] him. It's what birthed my love for him.
[56:08] Nobody told me about God and how great
[56:10] he was and how he created the earth and
[56:12] described him in such a way says, "Oh,
[56:13] I'm falling in love with this guy."
[56:15] No, we loved him because he first loved
[56:18] us. It's when that love was felt, when
[56:20] that love was broke through all the
[56:22] calluses and broke through all the
[56:24] layers. When we felt that love, that's
[56:26] what caused us to fall in love with him.
[56:29] If I can say this, I know it maybe
[56:31] sounds like a cheap cliche, but to to
[56:33] but to to love God is to know him.
[56:38] And our love for God is proportional to
[56:40] our knowledge of him.
[56:41] Amen. God's love is per perfect
[56:45] but our love is proportional in in
[56:48] degrees to our knowledge of him.
[56:52] So when he says his love is perfected in
[56:55] us
[56:57] his love is perfecting our love for him
[57:01] that is in us. Yes.
[57:04] The love of God is the love of God
[57:06] perfect. His love is perfected in us.
[57:08] Then it's the love we have for him him
[57:12] is perfecting. And the perfect love he
[57:15] has for us is perfecting.
[57:20] Perfect love for us as we would possess
[57:22] it relates to our love for him. And that
[57:25] knowledge and that knowledge of him.
[57:27] Love and knowledge growing to maturity.
[57:30] grow into full perfection.
[57:32] Could we could you personally identify
[57:34] with this? My love for him, the love I
[57:38] have for God, my agape for God may not
[57:40] be perfect, but it's perfecting.
[57:44] It's a present participle.
[57:46] In other words, in continuous a
[57:48] continuous sense
[57:50] that I have perfecting love.
[57:54] That I do not speak of one that says,
[57:56] "Oh, my love for him is perfect."
[57:58] because I'm not always doing what he
[58:00] wants me to do. Oh, my love for him is
[58:01] perfect because there's times that I
[58:03] fear, but I realize that his perfect
[58:05] love is perfecting the love that is in
[58:08] me. So, though my love may not be
[58:10] perfect love, it is perfecting love. It
[58:12] is in continually in the sense of
[58:15] getting better.
[58:18] The Bible says in 1 Corinthians 8:3,
[58:19] "But if any man love God, the same is
[58:22] known of him." This is this is exciting
[58:25] scripture right here. But if any man
[58:27] love God, the same is known of him.
[58:29] Maybe I could just go it a little bit
[58:30] faster and sweat a little bit harder to
[58:33] finish this. But if any man love God,
[58:35] the same is known of him. To say that
[58:38] you are known of God, it denotes and
[58:40] signifies that a there's a personal
[58:42] relationship between the one that knows
[58:44] and the one that is known. There's a
[58:46] relationship between the knower and the
[58:48] known. If any man love God, the same
[58:50] that loves God is known by God. So
[58:52] there's a love to God and there's a
[58:54] knowledge. There's a knowledge between
[58:55] two. So it it says that there's a
[58:57] relationship between the one that knows
[59:00] and the one that is known.
[59:02] And the knowledge, this is what's meant
[59:03] by this word that is used, especially if
[59:05] a Jew is going to be using it. The
[59:07] knowledge of an object implies that that
[59:10] object has an influence on the knower.
[59:15] To say that I love God means that he
[59:17] knows me.
[59:19] Now notice what Paul has done. If you
[59:21] love God, that means God knows you.
[59:25] because you could not have loved him
[59:26] unless he knew you.
[59:28] So he says in 1 John 4 7 and 8, beloved,
[59:32] it's Paul who says, "If any man love
[59:33] God, the same is known of him." So it's
[59:35] beloved, let us love one another.
[59:39] This is what he's trying to encourage.
[59:41] He's saying this is where it's got to
[59:42] come from. For love is of God. And
[59:45] everyone that loveth is born of God and
[59:47] knoweth God. He that loveth not knoweth
[59:50] not God, for God is love. Amen.
[59:53] How why is he saying this? You don't
[59:56] love because you don't God you don't
[1:00:00] know.
[1:00:02] True knowledge of God implies the
[1:00:04] influence of God upon the knower.
[1:00:07] True knowledge of God implies the
[1:00:08] influence of God on the knower.
[1:00:11] If there's listen, if there's anything
[1:00:13] lacking in our love, if there's anything
[1:00:15] missing in the manifestation of it,
[1:00:17] knowledge can perfect it. Amen.
[1:00:20] Amen.
[1:00:20] It's not that you don't It's not that
[1:00:22] your love is imperfect in the sense that
[1:00:24] you got something that's not complete.
[1:00:26] You've just looking at in the middle of
[1:00:27] the process. And if you don't have what
[1:00:30] you need, you just need to know more of
[1:00:31] him.
[1:00:35] If any man loves God, the same is known
[1:00:37] of him.
[1:00:40] I I I I want you just to to really grasp
[1:00:43] that that that say if any man love God,
[1:00:46] the same is known of him. In other
[1:00:48] words, you love him because he knows you
[1:00:51] and and this and this knowledge of an
[1:00:53] object implies the influence
[1:00:57] the influence
[1:00:58] of that upon the person. So when you
[1:01:01] know God you love him. Why? Because your
[1:01:03] knowledge of God him being the object of
[1:01:06] your knowledge. It implies that it must
[1:01:08] if you truly know him then it must
[1:01:10] change you.
[1:01:12] Yes sir. True.
[1:01:14] Brother Brandham says, "When we were
[1:01:15] sinners, alienated without God in the
[1:01:19] world, that muck of mud, as I talked
[1:01:20] about this morning, God came to us.
[1:01:23] God sought you. You never sought God.
[1:01:27] No man could come to me except the
[1:01:28] father draws him first. And God came
[1:01:30] down in that muck where you were and
[1:01:33] sought you out and bought brought you
[1:01:34] out." That ought to create a perfect
[1:01:36] love.
[1:01:37] What ought to do it? The knowledge of
[1:01:39] it. Why? The knowledge of that ought to
[1:01:42] implies or the true knowledge of implies
[1:01:44] an influence on the knower.
[1:01:48] We love him because he first loved us.
[1:01:51] We love God because we're known of God.
[1:01:54] Amen.
[1:01:54] Says in Romans 5'8, God commendeth his
[1:01:56] love toward us. And that while we were
[1:01:58] yet sinners, Christ died for us. It's
[1:02:01] important to know that he commended his
[1:02:02] own uniqueness of the love procure to
[1:02:04] God who is love. He manifested what was
[1:02:06] in his heart when he sent his son to die
[1:02:08] for us. Amen.
[1:02:10] And this is fully demonstrates the love
[1:02:11] that God has to us. Christ died for us.
[1:02:15] And Paul uses commendeth. He uses it in
[1:02:18] present tense.
[1:02:20] Not past, not future, present tense. And
[1:02:24] God continually establishes love,
[1:02:27] establishes his love.
[1:02:29] This love that he had for us was before
[1:02:31] Christ died. This love that he had for
[1:02:32] us was before your conversion. This love
[1:02:34] is from everlasting is what the Bible
[1:02:36] teaches us. It did not begin with your
[1:02:38] love for him. It did not begin with your
[1:02:40] works, but it was from his will, from
[1:02:42] his heart, from his pleasure that he
[1:02:44] loved us.
[1:02:45] In first John 4:9 and 10, but this was
[1:02:48] manifested the love of God toward us,
[1:02:50] because that God sent his only begotten
[1:02:51] son into the world, that we might live
[1:02:53] through him.
[1:02:54] Herein is love, not that we love God,
[1:02:58] but that he loved us and sent his son to
[1:03:00] be the perpetuation for our sins. Do you
[1:03:02] see what John is trying to get us to? to
[1:03:04] where we get right back to the place
[1:03:06] where we know God and we know what this
[1:03:08] love is and we're absolutely secure and
[1:03:11] growing in our knowledge of God and our
[1:03:12] love for God and his love for us. And
[1:03:15] that's what's going to turn us into a
[1:03:16] dynamo of his love. It can never happen
[1:03:19] apart from knowledge of God. It can
[1:03:21] never happen apart from having love for
[1:03:22] God. John is trying to bring us to a
[1:03:24] greater manifestation of God's word.
[1:03:27] Amen.
[1:03:29] How is God's love manifested in that he
[1:03:31] sent his son to die for our sins? 1 John
[1:03:34] 3:16, hereby perceive, we hereby we know
[1:03:37] that God loves us. Hereby we perceive
[1:03:39] the love of God because he laid down his
[1:03:41] life for us.
[1:03:43] And we ought to lay down our lives for
[1:03:44] the brethren.
[1:03:51] If we know him,
[1:03:55] then we know that love has an influence.
[1:03:58] It's a perfecting love.
[1:04:01] Herein is our love made perfect. Our
[1:04:05] agape can be perfected.
[1:04:08] Herein is our love made perfect. My
[1:04:11] agape made perfect. His love can't be
[1:04:14] made perfect.
[1:04:16] It's already perfect. But my love can
[1:04:18] be.
[1:04:19] God's love is not separated into
[1:04:21] degrees.
[1:04:22] You don't take a temperature of God's
[1:04:24] love and say, "Seems like you're a
[1:04:26] little cold today, buddy." Right?
[1:04:28] Doesn't happen.
[1:04:29] God's love is not separated in degrees.
[1:04:31] It does not grow cold, nor does it
[1:04:32] increase.
[1:04:35] God's not kind of like, you know what? I
[1:04:36] don't know. I mean, I think I like you.
[1:04:38] Could be a crush. Not sure where we're
[1:04:40] at, you know? And then we buy him
[1:04:43] flowers. He's like, you know what? Hey,
[1:04:44] things are warming up over here.
[1:04:47] He loves us
[1:04:49] when we're ugly, when we're unlovable,
[1:04:51] when we're brutes, when we speak against
[1:04:53] him, when we doubt him. He's already
[1:04:55] going, "Man, I love this guy."
[1:04:58] This guy's awesome.
[1:05:00] And all the angels are like,
[1:05:03] "But this is my guy. I love him."
[1:05:06] Because his love can't diminish for us.
[1:05:08] Hey, I know I'm not giving anybody a get
[1:05:11] out of jail free card because once you
[1:05:13] know this, it changes things. That he's
[1:05:16] not looking for you to make a mistake so
[1:05:17] he has an excuse to break up with you.
[1:05:19] He's not looking for you to make a
[1:05:21] mistake so he can put you away in
[1:05:22] divorce. He's not looking for you to
[1:05:24] fail so he can have an excuse not to
[1:05:27] love you anymore. He's bound to it.
[1:05:30] His love is already perfect. It can
[1:05:33] neither decrease or increase based upon
[1:05:36] anything we do.
[1:05:37] Amen. Amen.
[1:05:39] Charity never fails was never spoken of
[1:05:41] our love but of God's love. The love
[1:05:43] that is God.
[1:05:44] Amen.
[1:05:46] But my love
[1:05:48] is perfecting.
[1:05:50] Amen.
[1:05:52] And that is why when I read there's no
[1:05:53] fear in love, but perfect love casteth
[1:05:56] out fear. Then I know that what God is
[1:05:59] doing is perfecting my love.
[1:06:02] Amen.
[1:06:04] He is perfecting my love. If I if John
[1:06:07] could have maybe written it a little bit
[1:06:09] better, uh, he would have, but it's
[1:06:11] right in what he's saying.
[1:06:14] It's not so much a litmus test. Well,
[1:06:17] let's see whether or not you have
[1:06:18] perfect love. Oh, scared this morning,
[1:06:21] are you?
[1:06:22] Let's find ourselves at the altar. He
[1:06:24] say, "No, no, no, no, no. God's love
[1:06:26] will take care of that."
[1:06:28] Yes, sir.
[1:06:29] Our love is perfecting in us as we
[1:06:31] commune with him, as we fellowship with
[1:06:33] him, as we come to know him more. says
[1:06:35] in verse 18, "He that fearth is not made
[1:06:39] perfect in love."
[1:06:41] What does that mean?
[1:06:44] It only means that there's more to him
[1:06:45] to know.
[1:06:47] That's all he's saying.
[1:06:49] He's just, "Oh, oh, there's there's more
[1:06:51] of him to know."
[1:06:52] There there's more of our heart that can
[1:06:54] be in love with him.
[1:06:56] Oh, you you your fear is that he that
[1:06:59] fearth is not made perfect in love. In
[1:07:02] other words, if I fear, my love isn't
[1:07:04] perfect yet,
[1:07:06] but it's perfecting,
[1:07:08] so he's not he's not taking it away from
[1:07:10] us. John is not asking us to start over.
[1:07:13] He's encouraging to keep going.
[1:07:16] He's not saying, "Oh, you didn't have it
[1:07:18] to begin with." He's saying, "No, this
[1:07:19] is just a sign that there's more of him
[1:07:21] to know."
[1:07:22] Our love is only limited by the limits
[1:07:24] of our knowledge of God. So I know that
[1:07:27] if I have fear, it's only that that fear
[1:07:30] has found the limit of my knowledge of
[1:07:31] God. Oh, hallelujah. It's only that fear
[1:07:34] has found the place in my heart or that
[1:07:38] door within my heart, found that place
[1:07:40] in my life where the knowledge of God is
[1:07:42] yet to advance. It's only found that
[1:07:44] weakness, that soft spot that the love
[1:07:46] of God is pursuing, that the love of God
[1:07:48] has not yet reached to. That part of my
[1:07:51] heart that I've withheld from him, it
[1:07:53] tells me that I can love him more.
[1:07:59] I limit
[1:08:01] my the capacity my capacity to fear is
[1:08:05] quantified
[1:08:07] by how much I know him.
[1:08:11] It it it exists in that space where my
[1:08:14] knowledge of him is limited
[1:08:17] and the limited understanding that I
[1:08:18] have for his love for me.
[1:08:21] So perfecting love,
[1:08:23] God's love is perfect.
[1:08:26] God's love is perfecting our love
[1:08:29] for him. So God's love is perfecting and

[1:09:03] him to know. Amen.
[1:09:06] You you fear a little bit. Oh, just you
[1:09:08] know what? The best cure for fear is
[1:09:09] falling more in love with Jesus.
[1:09:11] Oh, whatever it is you're fearing it.
[1:09:14] There's there's just some
[1:09:14] misunderstanding between God's love and
