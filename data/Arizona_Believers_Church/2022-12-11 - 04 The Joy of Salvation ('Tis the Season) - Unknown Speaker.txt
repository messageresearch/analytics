TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we've been on the subject of the joy of salvation and the uh it's a series on salvation and the joy that it brings and kind of making sure that we have the right kind of joy and today's title is tis the season and that's kind of a familiar phrase to us when we're borrowing this phrase tis the season from the traditional Christmas Carol Deck the Halls of thousand Holly and we all familiar with the phrase tis the season to be jolly and even that phrase tis the season is very familiar to US during this time it's ubiquitous now in terms of it's everywhere you look this time is tis the season something about the season but it didn't really enter into our language or our vernacular until the 1970s with if you're spiritual that's after the seals are open and so this phrase tis the season to be jolly I'm consider in some of these different phrases and things during this time of year jolly means to to be married cheerful speaks of Joy or merriment they actually um not sure exactly where we get that word Joy from and some of the different sources point back to Joy one of them is Latin from the Latin word to rejoice and I was just doing some studying on this particular Christmas Carol because I had this thought on my mind tis the season the way the Lord brought this to me was very unique uh found out that the the melody to it is from a 16th century Welsh uh Carol about New Year's Eve and about the New Years and then it's not until the 1860s that they put American or English to it and uh it was originally meant to be performed with a group of singers and and a harp and so when we see tis the season to be Jala we all say okay see some brave people at first everybody was like this is a trap we know this is a trap he's about to preach against Christmas music uh not yet and so the idea was that you know you know someone you'd sing the verse and then the harp would come in and play that part and uh I saw where a John Ritter he's an English composer said the idea was that the singers would come up with the first line Deck the Halls of palsaholi and then the harpist would improvise the next line and then they sing the line after that tis the season to be jolly and the harpist would play something so that's that's what we're looking at is tis the season to be jolly I've kind of entered that into your mindset but when I use the phrase tis the season we're going to make this very applicable to us as Believers we're looking at our reason for rejoicing and ask her says why are we happy why is it we have joy and um is it just merely something that's causing us to be happy or or is there something that we're happy in and last Sunday we looked at different types of Joy using the principle of cause and effect we titled it cause and effect some people actually thought it was a typo at first but we brought it into how Joy actually can be a cause itself once it's centered correctly and so the cause is the reason why something happened I might have a slide up there for cause and effect causes the reason why something happened the effect is actually what happened and so we looked at the emotion of Joy where it's just merely human emotion where you're excited about something a pleasure or happiness caused by natural things and so in context you can be happy and excited about anything and the Bible says Rejoice not when your enemy fails why because you can get happy about things that you shouldn't be happy about so there's an emotion of joy that is related to Natural things but then we looked at how Joy can be a happy motion call caused by Supernatural things and that the spirit of God can move and it can enthuse us and we can get excited and we can rejoice and how this fruit of the spirit is joy and how God's presence can cause people to Joy but then we wanted to look at joy in a different context that Joy was more can be more than just a human emotion caused by something but it's actual joy in the right thing and that's where we read from Nehemiah 8 10 for this day is Holy and our Lord neither be you sorry for the joy of the Lord is your strength and so it's not just Joy because we're saved when we say the joy of Salvation and it's not just joy that the Lord has given us and made us happy as some sort of emotion and so this is where Joy becomes something different the joy of the Lord and the joy of Salvation are not just an emotional effect but an affect themselves it's a power it says the joy of the Lord is your strength and so when your joy you're rejoicing your praise your happiness and your pleasure is in in the Lord it is your strength when it is when it is in the Lord like your happiness is to the Lord then it is a strength it can be a cause itself and so the sermon on cause and effect was about identifying the right cause of joy and even the effect of joy and how it can become an affect itself and so this is this leads me right to where we want to begin today and if you want to look at Proverbs chapter 15 this is where we're going to be starting because the joy we're talking about must have the right context when in the series on pure joy we were looking at something that was pure and something that was clean brother Branham says that that's our our Spirits are clean and they are pure and that our joy is in the Lord so it must have the right cause it must have the right context so our the joy that we have and if Joy expresses itself and some if it expresses itself externally or something that we have internally The Joy must be appropriate for the moment it must suit the moment it must it must suit the momentum uh if there's something that takes place and there's we've seen it before there's actually uh diagnosable conditions where people respond to trauma and sadness and loss through great joy and kind of enthusiasm and it's not the way that they're acting is not appropriate to the events that have transpired and so our joy must have the right cause it must be within the right context it must suit the momentum of the of the ACT actions it must suit the moment and in Proverbs chapter 15 verse 21 it says Folly is joy to him that is destitute of wisdom but a man of understanding walketh uprightly so this is a very uh a significant scripture because it's saying that Folly which is foolishness to me it means literally and I don't mean to offend anybody it means stupidity and some sort of senselessness it is uh it is folly is joy to him that is destitute of wisdom so if somebody doesn't have wisdom then they can enjoy being ignorant somebody doesn't have wisdom they can actually the Folly which is foolishness can be a joy to them but a man of understanding walketh uprightly so one thing just to catch at the beginning is wisdom is tied uh true Joy is tied to wisdom and so now we're looking at Folly and Folly what is what the scripture is saying is a person can be happy or derived feel a sense of Happiness from Folly when he lacks wisdom if you lack wisdom you lack understanding then you can enjoy foolish things so there could be a joy Folly is a joy to someone who's destitute of wisdom and so this Folly in the scripture is a false hope or expectation that in what year it's foolishness but you expect to get something from it and and in that's foolishness in itself and that's why it's called Falling the Hebrew word that is used there Cassel is actually translated to both Folly and to Hope in the Old Testament in Job chapter 8 verses 13 to 15 so are the paths of all that forget God and the Hypocrites hope Shall Perish whose hope that's the same word that is used of folly who's Folly but yet it's here used as hope shall be cut off and those whose trust shall be a spider's web he shall lean upon his house but it shall not stand he shall hold it fast but it shall not endure so this is a this is a hope or rejoicing in the wrong thing this is finding Joy I'm going to lean upon my house I'm going to lean upon my treasures I'm going to lean upon my own wisdom but it's saying that it brings misery that it brings weakness it brings destruction that what you're trusting in will fail you so this hope this this Folly that the Bible is talking about is actually connected to this false idea of Hope remember how we used hope is what the wrong kind of hope hope in the uh the in the quotations as one of the grinches that tries to take our joy because you're expecting something from something that it can't give you that something you're expecting then it's also translated uniquely in Psalms 38 7 for my loins are filled with loathsome disease it's actually in the Psalms speaking of the condition of being unfit for service and when the writers decided to translate this Hebrew word which is used to fall it's used for Folly it's used for Hope but now it's loins it's it's used to refer to someone's source of strength or energy my source of energy has been dried up within my loins where I should have ambition where I should have joy where I should have strength and vigor in life and vitality uh it's filled with it's a lonesome lothum's disease and I'm not getting the joy that I ought to have and so the use of the word suggests a longing for or a desire for the wrong thing and because I wanted something and I was expecting something and I put my hope in something and thought this would solve all my problems it's caused me disappointment because I trusted in the wrong thing it brought me shame because I thought I would get happiness out of this endeavor or this possession it's actually caused disappointment and so there is a hope there is a Folly and there is a joy a joy that is connected to the wrong thing that is a a disease that robs us of our strength and pulls virtue from us whereas true Joy is associated wisdom understanding knowledge and revelation that's what we want you to see in this that there's a Folly there's something where you're you're rejoicing in something that you ought not and you may say oh well I'm happy I feel great this is this is wonderful but if it's not connected with wisdom if it's not according to knowledge then it's a disappointment it's just nothing but Folly I actually was going to maybe my working title was Jolly or falling but it wouldn't fit on the slide in the fourth still brother bam said there's a power of the revelation of the word that gives septimulation of Joy to the believer stimulation of satisfaction the stimulation that it's Vindicated it's proved so this is the joy that we're looking at there's the power of the revelation of the word it says the joy of the Lord is my strength it's not the joy that he gives you that becomes your strength so it's not Joy remember we're talking about how there's some things that we have we're it's been it's caused us to be happy but that's not the joy the not the joy that the Lord gives but my joy in him my joy in his word my rejoicing in his truth my rejoice in this Revelation in my understanding of who he is that's what gives me strength you're not strong because you're happy you're strong because you're happy in Jesus You're Not Strong because he makes you you know takes away your Melancholy or takes away your depression your strength comes from being happy in the things of God because the power of revelation of the word gives stimulation of Joy to the believer it stimulates satisfaction the stimulation that it's Vindicated it's proved remember how he wrote in the church age book that a true believer's strength health and their liveliness is connected with their knowledge of and obedience to the pure word of God so the the Folly is joy to him that is destitute of wisdom but through the power of revelation of the word a man that has understanding walks uprightly shoulders back his his eyes up he's properly satisfied he's properly happy some of our Market enthusiasts will recognize this phrase It's a phrase of irrational exuberance and I originally was going to use it last week it just wasn't going to fit for time's sake but irrational exuberance it's used mostly with respect to the stock market but I think it has broad application in other areas but it's baseless optimism that lacks a real Foundation and it comes from uh I can't remember where he was given the speech but the the Fed chair Alan Greenspan I believe in 1996 was given a speech and in it he made this comment but how do we know when irrational exuberance has unduly escalated asset values he didn't know you're going to come here and and get like a lesson on how to uh get money out of the stock market but he's saying that there's times when people the markets are behaving irrational their values are being excessively inflated or you see a steep rise and some sort of value just a steep rise in investment and overall uh values are going high and he's saying how do we know when the excitement in the market isn't connected with some real value how do we know when everybody is doing it and everybody's investing and everybody's all in on on on bitcoin and everybody's all in all these other alt coins and how do we how do we know when this is really indicative of people who are investing rationally and it's tied to some real fundamental valuation so he says how do we know when in irrational exuberance is what's creating the value because it seems that people should be excited about something that has value but then once people start putting value in something it can inflate the value of something that has no value and so it's an unfounded Market optimism they say that lacks a real Foundation of fundamental valuation but instead rests solely on psychological factors in other words someone's just all worked up fomo right fear of missing out I better go all in on this uh AMC stalker which was there was one of them that was going crazy a lot of people thought they're going to buy houses using it but you never know when all of a sudden the the floor drops out and everyone's left holding the bag but it's when you get emotional about something without good reason and he's talking about this phrase irrational exuberance when people get excited about something without a fundamental valuation it creates this inflated asset price say oh you see that stock price you see how high it is but they're not using rational thinking they're not they're not valuing it on on the on they're not looking at the the financial statements they're not looking at the filings they're not looking at the the debt they're not looking at their cash flow it's just all based on psychological factors so I would call it a irrational exuberance as a baseless joy it's a baseless enthusiasm where there's excitement there's Emotion and Joy without really understanding what's causing the joy why are you all excited about that why why is the price going up and a lot of people who know would study the markets and look at the balance sheet would say we have no idea why we don't know why this stock is taken off we don't know why it's going high uh and so there's this irrational exuberance when people can get excited and they're and they and they like something and they're all for something but when you really get down to it it's just an emotion it's excitement for excitement's sake and in Romans chapter 10 verses 1 and 2 it says Brethren my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is that they might be saved he says for I bear them record that they have a Zeal this is an excitement of mine this is some sort of order this is fervency of spirit they have a Zeal they have an enthusiasm for God but not according to knowledge so there can be a Zeal but a Zeal without knowledge is baseless there's a Zeal without knowledge is irrational exuberance a Zeal without knowledge is a baseless enthusiasm it must be connected to as the Bible says a man of understanding walketh uprightly Joy should be connected with wisdom Joy should be connected with understanding and our joy and this is where I'm coming to tis the season our joy must be based on the word for our day there should be there there cannot be any other inspiration there cannot be any other Foundation we have to find our joy in the power of the Revelation for the time that we're living in because what we don't want is baseless joy we don't want a joy without the right cause we do not want to be happy just for happiness sake and in Nehemiah chapter 8 verse 10 it not only identifies to me a true Joy where the Bible says the a man of understanding walketh uprightly versus this Folly be enjoyed to he that is destitute of wisdom but Nehemiah chapter 8 and especially verse 10 the context points to the bride's Joy today what the bride should be rejoicing in today and so let's look together at Nehemiah chapter 8. as we go forward in this verse 1 it says in all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the street that was before the Watergate there's maybe a lot of types and things that we could bring here but they gathered together themselves together as one man there's this Unity they've been called together and they've spoken to Ezra The Scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses which the Lord had commanded to Israel and so we could say in this way the book of the law of Moses was lost to them it was something that they had not been reading it was something they were no longer familiar with being in captivity these precepts and the Very things that their faith were based upon had been eroded and chopped away and they'd forgotten the Commandments of God they had forgotten his precepts they had forgotten the law that was given to them they'd forgotten his promises and so they were reading the the Book of Genesis and Exodus Leviticus Numbers in Deuteronomy these are the words that were being read to them and you say well how did they do it well they did it from morning to afternoon and they were there listening and all that could have understanding were listening to the the very words of Genesis and Exodus Leviticus Numbers in Deuteronomy and what was happened is it was being read the word was being restored to them the things that had been lost the things that had been covered up the things that had been taken away from them through their own Disobedience and captivity these things are being restored and in verse 5 it says in Ezra opened the book and the sight of all the people it says for he was above all the people so he'd come to that Pulpit that wouldn't Pulpit to stand up in a place where he could be heard he opened the book and the sight of all the people and it says when he had opened it all the people stood up so at the time when this book is open and there's there's a restoration there's going to be a hearing of those things that were lost a very hearing of their who they were and what made them who they were this is what made them Jews this is what made them Israel is the god of Israel the god that had given the law to Moses and passed it down um to to the Israelites and so this open of the book revealed to them now as they're hearing this and I love this thought of them standing standing up when the book is open maybe we'll come to it here in a moment that with the opening of this book it revealed to them why they had been in bondage it it was revealing to them and they were hearing God said if you do this this is what's going to happen if you do this this is what's going to happen because remember it's the book of the law and as they're hearing it there's an unfolding of their church history there's an unfolding of how they let go of the truth and certain things were lost and certain things were no longer kept and observed and so as they're hearing this and really in one sense I could say that the law on its face ought to cause someone to cry the law on its face would cause someone to weep and so their initial response as the book is open and they're hearing it reciting uh they begin to weep but the truth of the opening demanded a different response and and maybe it might we might have to amplify this at another another moment in another service but the law itself it's judgment but within their word it's it's come bringing them to a particular place where at this time let's just read it in verses 9 and 10. it says in Nehemiah which is the tershafta and Ezra the priests The Scribe and the Levites that taught the people said unto all the people this day is Holy unto the Lord your God mourn not nor weep and so this this day in this first day of the seventh month he's saying this day is Holy unto the Lord but it says don't mourn don't weep for all the people wept when they heard the words of the law so there was I hear the book is open and I think there's ways that you can make this application that the book is being open the words are being spoken but as they hear it all they can pick out of that is reason to cry reason to weep and there's even uh and I think sometimes people are just kind of predisposed to being bad or sad and bad you know I'm glad all those stayed home today no um predisposed to being sad and they and they kind of like it and they could have the best day ever and you ask them how they go I don't know it was all right it's like I mean didn't you just get a million dollar raise it's like yeah but I kind of wanted to um some people just kind of like being that sad and disappointed and discouraged and there's actually one thing we've got to recognize is we think well the lord loves a broken and contrite spirit but there's an excess of grief that can be debilitating we think oh well this is what God must want no he wants you to realize at some point I mean there's a grieving and there's a broken Spirit to get out away from all the pretense to be honest with God about your your your sins and to ask for forgiveness and come honestly before the throne of grace but we ought not to be given to an excess of grief and so here are these the priests and and Nehemiah and Ezra saying and all the leaf I'd say no no you don't understand you're not you don't understand completely we understand that you would weep at the hearing of this we understand that you would look at your history and see the sins of your fathers we understand that the law itself gives great occasion to weep but it says this is the day that it's holding to the Lord your God verse 10 then he said unto them go your way eat the fat and drink the sweet for everybody who wasn't here last Sunday this is our scripture for this season it is to go your way eat the fat and drink the sweet and a combination of the carnivore diet and whatever you want drink the sweet send portions into them that for whom nothing is prepared for this day is Holy under our Lord neither be ye sorry it's not saying they shouldn't be repentant but it's saying don't grieve don't be sad for the joy of the Lord is your strength being point he's pointing them to the Joy the Levites the priests the word of God is pointing them to the joy that is power joy that is strength joy that is not that is uh is the opposite of this weeping and this morning that they were exhibiting and so we've said this before and I want to emphasize this rejoicing in the Lord gives us Inner Strength not just asking God to make us happy but being happy in him being happy in his promises and rejoice in the wrong thing will weaken the power that we need to fulfill his word and so what we could see from this context is when the word is revealed in its proper season it's the time for Joy not weeping that there's there's things that and if there's things that you're feeding on in the word of God and it just causes you to be discouraged it causes you to weep it cause you to be sorrowful then maybe you haven't placed it in its proper context maybe you don't recognize where it fits in God's season because their joy and rejoicing when the when they're told don't weep don't be sorry don't be sad they're saying they keep pointing to the day they keep pointing to the moment and to the time and so they had this their joy and their rejoicing had to be according to the word that was relevant to that day it wouldn't they're not just telling to be happy for no reason eat the fat drink the sweet send portions to those that have none these are things that were required by the word that was being restored to them so it wasn't just indiscriminate it wasn't just oh let's just get happy let's just get excited let's just shout Let's just dance when the word was opened the very open of the word made them aware of what that day meant what that time meant is that this isn't a time to be said this isn't a time to be sorrowful this isn't a time to be uh uh oh weeping and crying the word that's been opened up to us has enlightened us to the season the time that we're living in and it's a time to rejoice the very next verse verse 14 it says they found written in the law which the Lord had commanded by Moses that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the Feast of the seventh month so do you notice what happened here they come the first day of the seventh month and they start reading through the law and if you could make application to how this message will actually go back all the way to the very beginning and then traces even church history and there's things you read that can apply to certain ages and apply to certain times and there are certain things that are relevant to other dispensations and now here they were in the first day of the seventh month and as the word unfolded it finally came to the place where they read whoa do you see what day it is do you see what's relevant for the time that we're living in the next day they res in the very next day they come to they realize that this is the time that they restored if I could put it this way God coincided that's what I want to say first God coincided God was very deliberate in this when all the people were gathered together he made it happen to where they gathered together where the timing of the openness book was at the time of the Feast of booths this is God God making sure this happens in this way there's this very time God timed the open of the book to coincide with the Feast of Tabernacles and so in verse 14 we see that they recognize that they're going to have the Feast of Tabernacles according to the law and this is this is how Feast of Tabernacles is described in Leviticus 23 40 and ye shall rejoice before the Lord your God Seven Days the Feast of Tabernacles has actually caused called the season of our joy and in celebrating the Feast of Tabernacles of the Feast of booths its Joy is referenced several times with the promise in other words God is saying this time this season is a time of joy there's a time for the other things there's a time for this there's a time for that there's a time for war there's a Time For Peace but this moment this time the word was opened up in a season where all the the the Levites and Ezra Nehemiah can say wait a minute wait a minute you've got to recognize the moment you're living in according to the word of God that's just been restored to us and if we were in another time maybe that would be okay if we were in another day maybe that emphasis would be fine if we were in another moment maybe you could be happy in this or be satisfied and weeping but now is the time of rejoicing now is the time of Praise now is the season it says of our joy in Deuteronomy 16 15 it says the seven days you're to celebrate in the presence of the Lord your God at the place where the Lord will choose because the Lord your God will bless you in all your Harvest and in everything you do and your joy will be complete it is a season of Joy it's a season of rejoicing and notice that what time it is the Harvest Time at the Harvest time to celebrate the presence that what they're celebrating is not because there's a way that we talk about the presence is the way we talk about worship there's the way we talk about praise and and everything to where it really is just that feeling that you get when the spirit moves and brother bear says some people don't even know what anointing is because they're looking only at the joy and the enthusiasm that God gives instead of them having a celebration because of his presence or salivation in his presence in his chosen place so this is when God the moment that God allowed the book to be open to Israel and the word the book of the law to be restored to them coincided with their season of joy and so to us I say tis the season because we must recognize our day and its promise in order to have true rejoicing are we living in the time when God wants us to weep are we living in the time where God wants us to do this to do that what time are we living in biller bam and the sermon Awakening Jesus is a mind of a man is always talking about and rejoicing what God has done and they're saying what he will do and ignoring what he's doing this is how we tend to uh go about our source of Joy we're happy about things that have happened or we're looking to look forward to things that will be and so he's saying that's the tendency of man they're always praising God for what he's done and looking forward to what he'll do and ignoring what he's doing now and brother bear says and in there miss the whole thing so and actually just looking back to what he's done and only looking forward to what he will do without recognizing what he's doing in the present speaks of having no understanding of what has happened and not understanding what will be you catch that so you cannot miss what's happening now and actually know what has happened and know what will be because if you can truly rejoice in what has been and truly rejoice in what will be then you have to recognize what is now he says man is always rejoicing about what he's done and rejoicing about what he'll do but not recognizing what he's doing if I got to say it this way that prophecy and fulfillment must align you can be rejoicing in Prophecy rejoicing in Prophecy but you must you must recognize what he's doing today you must have the you can't just have a balance of history in the future and say well he's done this and one he'll do that but you've got to you've got to possess the present reality I've been studying in all the places that Paul refers to Joy and he he is actually just has so many scriptures on it and ways that he places Joy it's a very rich uh study but he says in Philippians 4 4 rejoice in the Lord alway and again I say rejoice there's rejoice in the Lord alway and again I say rejoice you find that Paul is constantly rejoicing and the reason why Paul could Rejoice so earnestly despite all the things that he's enduring and all the things that's taking place he said hey I'm finishing my race with joy I I I'm happy I I'm rejoicing he says therefore I rather Glory not rejoice in the fact that he's sick but while being sick he can Rejoice all these things and why could Paul do it because he recognized his day he had recognized his day and the message he had received the promise that was given to him as a Jew and Hebrews 11 39 and 40. we know this has application of the time we're living in now to the Gentile bride but look at how a Jew was talking about his history and these all these fathers of their faith the ones that went before him obtained a good report through faith received not the promise God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect so Paul in his place and even though he's he's going to be bringing us into a gentile Church age and he's a messenger first messenger the Gentile church he stands as one who's received the promise that was given to him as a Jew and he's saying that we got something better than they got and that we as it relates to the Jewish Church ages we have received our Capstone and that we have been the Perfection we have received the Perfection of their faith that they have received through the one that we've received Christ he's the one that grants The Inheritance retroactively to the Seed of Abraham and he could rejoice so his cause of joy was his brother Branham uses this phrase revelation of the word in its season he doesn't say it about Paul but I'm saying it because go go look up and if you just want to if you just want to use the search function uh in the in the message Hub or whatever app it is you use and just put in put in season and uh and just you could start in 65 and work your way backwards and you can just read forever because season is so he's constantly pointing out to the season the season the season and he used this phrase It's the revelation of the word in its season talks about the five must and trying to do God of service without it being his will you can listen to the one in in August of 65 or even in Shreveport later in November those two I would encourage you to listen to those but these were the five must he says in following God keeping his Commandments to do anything right for God to do God's service correctly these are the phrases he uses the five must it must be in his time must be in his season must be according to his word must be the person he's chosen to do it it must be Vindicated and one of the things he emphasizes over and over again in this sermon and he actually I think he even preaches spiritual food and due season after this there in August season he's talking about the season the season it must be in his season and season is the proper time or the suitable occasion season is the right moment the appropriate time that's what a season is I think I might have a slide for you on that season it's a proper time it's a suitable occasion it's the right moment so when we say season we say something's out of season it's not the right time and there's things that oh it's not seasoned for it's not seasoned for it it's not the right time it's the time which when something is in season it fits right like a word fitly spoken meat in due season it's like this is the moment I need it this is the moment we have need of it this is what it's for this is the time that we need it and brother Branham says and things uh trying to do God of service without being the will of God he says he regulates the Sun and regulates nature to meet his word how is it the sun dictates seasons in its nearness to the earth and the rotation of the Earth around the Sun determine Seasons times and Seasons he said God regulates the Sun he regulates nature to meet his word he regulates the church the predestinate the bride to meet the season that they are in so God is the one who's regulating the seasons God is the one who regulated the children of Israel coming back to restore rebuild the walls of Jerusalem to try to restore Temple worship God was regulated and God's the one that gathered the people as one man God's the one that caused the book to come open God's the one that's doing this and he does it in a moment at a time then when the book comes open what they're supposed to do it's in the season of Joy the season of their Joy the season of rejoicing God regulated it that way yet a Nehemiah when the book is being opened they're sad they're depressed the Bible tells us they're weeping because they didn't recognize the season they didn't recognize what was transpiring and what was taking place I could have saved this maybe for our segment on character disorders but some of you have heard of seasonal affective disorder something may suffer from it sad they call in it's it's basically it can happen in the summer but it's more prominent in US it can happen spring and summer but it's more prominent with fall and winter but it's depression caused by the changes of season and with seasonal affective disorder that would be related to the fall winter disorder the symptoms start in the fall and continue in the winter months and it's it it's characterized and we're all going to die self-diagnose right now so this is the fun part right by the loss of energy and moodiness and somebody's saying that's me every morning is morning a season and and some of the the they have different characteristics of it of oversleeping and uh an appetite change where you're Desiring all those really bad carbs or the the the high carb foods and so I at least have that part down the weight gain check tiredness low energy these are all ways of saying You must you might be being affected merely by the change of season the reason why you're feeling the way you are it's a feeling sad or down you feel the sense of loss a feeling of hopelessness they say it's characterized by I feel worthless I I feel guilty problems concentrating these are all things that happen just through a change of season and so you come into this winter season and people oh it's cold it's cloudy it's dark it's this and and the different things that come along with it people start to feel depression and it's just related to a season change and this is where if you don't recognize the season the purpose of the season if you don't know how to meet the needs in that season there's a way that in the change of season you're not getting the joy that you have to have in the moment that's coming brother said Christ is the word that lives in you that verifies everything that he promised in its season so when God regulates the season in whatever season we're in if we can recognize his regulation if he could recognize his purpose if we can see that he regulates the sign and regulates nature to meet his word if we see that he regulates the predestinated bride to meet the season that they're living in then it's his regulation that determines my Jubilation it's his see it's what he's doing that makes me rejoice he says another place let the light shine and the light will bring every word to its right position in its season as I was looking at this these things and considering how that God allowed the book to be open at a particular season at a particular time at how I just I think in my in my heart I realized that there can be just as in the book of Nehemiah and the word is being opened they didn't they didn't recognize the season and that's why they were weeping that's why they're sad and maybe for some of us if there's a little bit of a dissatisfaction and we're not getting the joy I remember a brother from New Zealand he used this phrase one time where he I can't remember if he ran in to get something or something happened and he said did you get any joy and I'm like I mean wasn't shopping for Joy but it's just a phrase they use in New Zealand did you are you satisfied did you get what you want do you find any Joy is it did you possess what you wanted and sometimes we find ourselves sad and we're not getting Joy because we don't recognize the season we're in could you imagine how frustrated a farmer would be if he's expecting a harvest in the dead of winter he doesn't recognize the season he's not responding appropriately to the Time of the Season and so there is a sadness that we can have because it's not placed correctly but I want to look at the other extreme if our joy and our enthusiasm and excitement doesn't have the right Source or the right aim then it's baseless it's the kind of it's the kind of Joy that'll uh cause us to be disappointed or ashamed and the scripture that brother Branham is using he uses it as his text when he preaches the sermon in Shreveport on trying to do God of service his first Chronicles 13 7-10. and he uses this as a the you trying to do God a service without it being his will he says they put the Ark on a new cart and this this isn't according to the word because the the ark was to be carried by the Levites but they put it in a new way a new leadership a new ministry must be carried by the Levites and took it out of the house of adnanab and uza and ahil were the drivers of the cart then David and all Israel made Melody before God with all their strength with songs and corded instruments of music and with brass instruments and horns so now they're rejoicing they're praising they're worshiping why because the ark is coming back to Israel and so we could see this the ark is coming back they built a cart they this is a new card this is the great thing the word has been restored the word has been restored isn't this wonderful isn't this great this is our Revival this is our this is our joy and when they came to the grain floor of chidan oozer put his hand to keep the Ark in its place for The Oxen were slipping and the Wrath of the Lord burning against us destruction on him because he has put his hand on the ark and death came to him there before God this occasion of Joy this rejoice in this great happiness that they had why because they aren't coming it's our Ark it's our word these things are ours and they're dancing and rejoicing but brother Branham is using this scripture as an example of how they were trying to do God a service but it wasn't according to his will wasn't according to a season it wasn't being done the right way and he said he says this and trying to do God of service he says now let us see what happened and this is what happened it brought death he says their religious emotion and stuff was great their intentions were great their Crusade was great their singing was great their dancing was great their shouting was great their music was great and they had the ark what good is the ark without God notice all these elements they had left God out they hadn't consulted God they hadn't done it according to the word they hadn't consulted the prophet he says it's just a wooden box and a couple tables of stone this is what happened they had rejoice and they had emotion they had dancing they had music they had everything they even could point to this the physical part of the Ark so by all appearances this is their Revival this is their great restoring this is their great rejoicing but all their activity and all the rejoice and resulted in the wrath of God because they weren't doing it correctly in God's time with his person with his Vindication in his season and brother Branham says he's talking about different uh whether it be water baptism and different things he says that when all this happens he said let us now see what happens when God and his age and his time is not considered just the people's idea this is what happened when God's season is not considered this is what happens when they haven't thought well what time are we living and what moment are we living and what's appropriate what's the appropriate expression for the time and for the moment now you could say the art coming back was an occasion to Joy but it wasn't being done according to God's word and if they had understood the word for their season they would have said wait a minute we can't just shout and dance because we're not doing it the way God has ordained it to be done brother bam said the real word of the season of that age was ignored because they had a lot of emotion isn't that interesting that emotion can Cloud our view and that where there's joy there's excitement there's enthusiasm and there's this sense of energy and inspiration we'll use that what is brother I'm saying the church age book well we get results don't we like they use that as the measuring stick they use that as the Plumb line he says away with experience as a Plumb line back to the word of God it says in Nehemiah 8 5 and Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people for he was above all the people and when he opened it all the people stood up when he opened the book it says all the people stood up it was this attitude of attention and respect this is why we even stand when we read the word of God there's a scriptural basis for you saying why do you get the script you understand when you read the word of God well we do it because brother Branham set the example but this is an example that that is used in the scripture to say that when the book is open and we read from the word of God we stand out of respect but it was the this him standing up before the people being lifted up before the people in this very Act of him opening this anticipation we had heard this was going to happen we had heard this day was coming maybe there was rumors going through the camp and different ones had heard they found the book of the law and there was different things that were being wrecked into their time and like oh it's going to be open they stood with respect and now the book is open it says then he said unto them verses 10 to 12 go your way eat the fat drink the sweets and portions of them for whom nothing is prepared for this day is Holy unto our Lord neither be you sorry for the joy of the Lord is your strength so the levite stealed all the people saying hold your peace for the day is Holy neither be aggrieved and all the people went their way to eat and to drink and to send portions and to make great mirth because this is why they Rejoice because they had understood the words that were declared unto them they're rejoicing was not because the ark's coming back they're rejoicing wasn't because oh we dusted off the book of the law the rejoicing was because they understood the words of the open book I'll say this it's not enough to say this is the third pool it's not enough to say the seventh seal is open it's not enough to say this is the open of the word we need to understand what that means we need to recognize what is actually transpiring what is meant by it and trust me it's not just theological it's not just to itch our ears it's something very real and something very practical and it has to do with the season that we're in and it has to do with God's purpose it says in verse 8 so they read in the book of The Law of God distinctly and gave the sense and caused them to understand the reading this is what those who had heard is that he may have stood up and began to read then there was those who were tasked with with hearing what was being said and then they would take what was being said and they they taught it to the people and they made sure they heard he says oh he said this he said that and there's a there was a teacher there there was a levite there was one there who could stand there and he says they made sure that they understood they spoke distinctly and then they gave the meaning they gave the sense and they kept preaching the word of God so that the people could have an understanding now I hope that this isn't too hard of a pivot a hard Fork here or something but in Nehemiah 8 what we read in Nehemiah it holds a parallel to promises that are relevant in our day holds a parallel to Revelations 5 and Revelations 10. these are promises for the day we're living in I could read to you probably a dozen statements from trying to do God of service without it being his will where he makes reference to this these things he said the Bible said of Malachi 4 what would happen today Revelations 10 how the seals would be open and reveal all the Mysteries that's been hid through these reformers and that sermon he's pointing us to the time we're living in in Revelations 10 Revelations 5 the seals would be open it revealed the mystery that's been hit through these reformers and he's being very explicit he's being very distinct he's not saying oh well maybe it'll be he's it's been identified perfectly he's been very Adam he's being very bold and so brother Branham is saying this try and trying to do God of service without us being his will and he gives the five must if I'm going to draw a parallel of the book being open in Nehemiah 8 and they're hearing the words of the book and you could have an inappropriate response because you don't recognize the implications you don't recognize the season you don't recognize the a moment then I say if we believe these things do we understand what has happened in this season we're living in because if not maybe our Jolly is folly think about it maybe what we're all happy and excited about maybe it's just follow you know sometimes it comes as a shock to people they they see the truth of the message of the hour and they hear some sort of fanaticism they hear some kind of cultish idea and they hear about some false Doctrine that's sweeping and they think oh well that you know that must just be dead and it must be dried up and you go to a meeting sometimes they're the most enthusiastic because a lot of emotion can still follow that and so we don't want to just convince ourselves because we're happy we got it but are we happy in what we got do we know what we have we have the right kind of joy said they made great mirth because they understood the words that were declared to them can we have joy because we're understanding the words that have been declared to us and I'll pick up on this either Wednesday or next Sunday I I could do it right now because I was prepared to preach something totally different and I didn't even know if I sent the right slide show I I didn't know if I had the right notes I was like this could be really interesting and all my friends will say have you considered evangelism we're there foreign but now is the bride calling what does that mean this is this is the season now is the bride calling now is when the Seven Seals have been opened when he says now as the bride calling it's not a reference to how God called The Bride out of every age that's not what the bride age is you cannot take the revelation of the bride and say well in every age there was a variety okay the bride age is a very distinct dispensation that brother oriented us to at the very end of his ministry he says now is the bride calling now is when the Seven Seals have been opened and this is brother but I'm saying this is the time we're living in so I know I'm running out of time let's look at Revelations chapter 5. I'm just going to read through this and we'll pick up on some of these things at a later time but here's the scene that's being set you can see that the church ages unfold through the first three chapters uh chapter four is kind of setting the scene but then chapter five is events that are transpiring between the seven Church ages and the open of the Seven Seals that unfold in the next chapters and this is the event that takes place he said I saw on the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with the loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof now I want you to recognize Birdman preach recognizing your day and its message and the whole time he talks about the Jews right because they have a day in its message but we've got to recognize our day and its message the season the time that we're living in and now as we read this think about the implications for us think about how brother Brown says the Seven Seals will be open the Mysteries revealed do we have the understanding at the open of this book so that we can have joy is it our season of Joy he says and it continues the question is whose word that open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in Heaven Nor on Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look thereong and John's response now and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open the book to open and to read the book neither to look thereon now John's response is appropriate because the book he's looking at is the title deed it's the book of redemption it's the land that is the Lamb's Book of Life this is the book of the manifestation of the grace of God when the law is read then the appropriate response would be to weep right and and so there's a there was a response and the open of the law to where the people wanted to weep but now the teachers and the Levites and him I said no no if you recognize your day this is the season of Joy this is the season of rejoicing and if we were only looking at the church ages then we could look at the complaints and we could look at the failures and we could look at the cycle of Revival and death and we say oh well look at this and look at how Satan has worked against the church and made it lukewarm and Powerless and there's a we could have this cause for being sad and so when John sees that this book of redemption is sealed up and can't be read he's saying that's the grace that we need and so he cries he begins to weep and one of the elders saith unto me weep not weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David this phrasing this even calling him the line of the tribe of Judah it's the only time he's referred to that the lion of the tribe of Judah though they believe the Messiah would come though the prophecy is related to Judah and this King out of Judah the lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seals thereof he hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seals thereof this is this is why he says John John's crying John's crying he said stop crying hey don't you cry I think sometimes it's one of the most unfair things we say to our kids right you stop your crying the Clint's teeth bit is just something I do behind the pulpit but they we get that stop stop the crying it's okay to cry sometimes there's real good reasons to cry and in this case John had good reason to cry if the book stayed sealed so the angel just this person just this elder just doesn't say it's okay John stop crying he said don't cry because stop crying because the lamb or the line of the tribe of Judah hath prevailed to open the book and in verse in verse 13 we could read what happens to John where John says every creature in heaven and in Earth under their third eye John crying out when he began to cry out uh blessed be blessing and honor and glory and Power to him that sitteth on the throne and unto the lamb forever and ever he says John begins to cry this out so in verse 13 wait and we'll come to in a later surface we see John's weeping turn to Joy what had happened season had changed if the book's not open you should cry but when the book is open the season changed so when it tells me is in this there's a particular season where temporary Joy is all you should expect but when the season changes it's a permanent Joy Ecclesiastes 3 4 says a time to weep and a time to laugh and a time to mourn and a time to dance so you have a time to weep a time to mourn but then there's a time when weeping and mourning are no longer appropriate when this other time comes and this is what's happening to John he's crying he's weeping but then he's told no don't don't cry anymore because the lamb excuse me the lion of the tribe of Jew hath prevailed to open the book and this is what brother Branham is pointing us to and he says this is the time now is the bride calling now is when the Seven Seals have been opened what Seven Seals the Seven Seals are on this closed book in Revelations 5 1. this is what he's wanting us to look at he's saying all Seven Seals have been open everything's been prepared to them that can receive it this is a time this is the time that we're living and this is the season that we're living in and I'll say this you may disagree with me but I'm just saying what he said I'm not even putting any interpretation to it I'm just saying what he said he's saying now is the bride calling now is when the Seven Seals have been opened and he's saying they have been opened this is the time that we're living and so when brother Brown has come into this place to preach this very things and he's even pointing back to what's happened even one place he says it's history but brother Branham when he's when he comes to preach the seals I want to put it this way if there's a time to cry and a time for Joy brother Branham comes as a prophet and he stands in the breach between the morning and the joy he comes right at the season change seasons are changing God's the one that's orchestrating and what does God do when you need to turn a corner he sends a prophet and so when it comes time when there's going to be a transition there's going to be a change of seasons brother random comes and he stands in the breach I'd like to amplify this more later but brother brother Branham said that John was the breach so John the Baptist as John the Baptist 4 Ran So here's brother Branham John was a breach between the law and Grace now brother Branham comes in and he's going to be the breach between two dispensations and so if you can catch this this is a very beautiful thing and we're just going to be closing on this principle in the breach and Revelations 5. brother Branham so in Revelations chapter 5 verse 2 you have a sealed book and in the in the sealed book it says that this is the book is in the hand of him who sits upon the throne and the very next thing we hear is verse two and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with the loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof now nothing is said about worth nothing is said about who can do it but yet this is the proclamation who is one that opened the book and loose the seals thereof now when we read that we feel as if it's an invitation to find someone who's Worthy please raise your hand if you're worthy please raise hands if you're worthy and that somehow there had been a search put out there's a Headhunter who's trying to find somebody who could crack the code somebody who could figure it out but notice how brother Branham is struck by this very scripture and the sermon the breach brother bear said this was the this book was the title deed to Redemption and it was sealed with Seven Seals and then an angel came forth a strong angel proclaiming with the loud voice who was worthy to open the book to take the book who was able to open the seals who was able to open the book here's the brother Brian I'm standing in the breach had the seven Church ages now we stand in the bridge because he has to he's preaching the breach before he preaches the Seven Seals because that's where we were that's the time that we were in now catch what he says the angel asked it John saw it and he said now who's Worthy let him and now brother Brown I'm feeling the weight of this scripture he stayed in the very moment and The Time of the Season that's recorded in Revelations 5. notice how brother Branham says this oh my maybe I am just feeling this way and when you're ready you rise he's the only one that could feel that way any one of us could have asked the question well who's worthy and we might have thought we had the answer but only one could say this let him the Ascend the angel let him he said here's the book of redemption here's the Plan of Redemption brother I said I feel a certain way right now I see a book sealed up and though the Bible says who's worthy he says I'm feeling a certain way to declare unto you not who's worthy but let him who is come oh my maybe I'm just feeling this way but let him let him he says here's the only way you'll ever be redeemed for here is the title deed of redemption of the whole heavens let him come forward if he will he says again oh my now speaker forever hold his peace let him come forward and claim this book what is brother about him feeling he's still in the weight of the mantle he's feeling the weight of the age the season changed and as he's preaching the breach he actually feels the anointing of Revelations 5 2. he feels the power of that scripture and brother Brenham declares he's declaring the change of season and he doesn't just say well who's worthy who's worthy and then nobody knows nobody knows his worthy nobody knows who's worthy but he says I'm feeling a particular way about this he says and maybe I'm the only one that can say this maybe I've got to Proclaim as the seventh angel messenger with the loud voice I'm not asking who's worthy but I'm saying he who is worthy let him come and take the book and the Bible says and he came [Applause] he's declaring a season change says in Genesis 49 verses 9 and 10. because it asks this this odd question Judah is a lion's welp he's just a pup this is the prophecy of Jacob going over his son Judah from the prey my son Thou Art gone up he stooped down he couched as a lion and as an old Lion now grew up from a young Lion now he's an old lion mature grown-up says who will wake him up who shall Rouse him up Genesis 49 who shall Rouse him up who will stir him up who will wake him up and says the scepter shall not depart from Judah nor a lord Giver from between his feet until Shiloh come rest peace come and unto him shall the Gathering of the people be what does the Bible telling us that Judah this lion to the tribaj Judah who will wake him who will stir him who will bring them forth listen Jesus went to the River Jordan because John was there and it was John listen you gotta we have to kiss this it was John that the presence of John is what brought Christ to that place into that season for him to say Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world and brother Branham is standing there in Jeffersonville under the weight of Revelations 5 2 and he says let the lamb come let the worthy one come let him take the book well he's rousing up the line of the tribe of Judah he's stirring him he's causing him to rise and to take his claim the Bible says in Revelations 5 7-10 and he came and he came can you say that and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne Watch What Happens and when he had taken the book that whole taking of the book I think there's a lot of this that's misunderstood but it means to choose means to collect it means to lay upon so I almost said Tis the seizing right we've been using some word plays this is the time to seize this is the time when he says oh maybe I'm just feeling this way he says let him come forward and claim this book let him come forward and seize it let him come forward and take it Christ is the mystery of God revealed he says you're the book let him come forward and take it he comes three times he comes time to save his bride and later he's going to come with his bride but then he comes to take his bride this is the season that we're living in he says and when he had taken the book this is what happens the four beasts and four and 24 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps tis the season right it's sung by those you have to have a coral then you have to have a harp if you're going to sing tis the season to be joyful to be happy and the harps are playing having every one of them Harps and golden vials of odors which are the prayers of saints and they sung a new song well this isn't a song you could sing before that when they crossed over the Red Sea they begin to sing a song of the horse and the writer have been cast into the sea no one could have imagined that tune no one could have properly written that tune no one could have adequately been inspired to sing it with an understanding but once God who gave the promise they would be delivered and come out with the mighty hand when they could look back and see that God had done it according to his word and they were in the season then they sang a new song oh I believe that we have occasion to sing new songs that have never been sung before and they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof what is it they did as they began to fall down on their face they bowed their heads and worshiped the Lord with their faces to the ground of Nehemiah now they begin to worship now we're worthy to take the book and open the seals thereof for thou was slain this is the song has redeemed us to God by the blood like blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and Nation this has to be a gentile song he says it has made us into our Gods Kings and Priests we shall reign on the Earth brother Branham refers to it I believe it's in the seals maybe the seventh seal when he's looking at these scriptures he says this is a time when everything must be worshiped because it's the season he said this is the time now when the seventh seal is open now there's it's worship everything must be worship I want you to ponder this phrase real deeply brother Branham when he's preaching the church agencies John must have really had a Pentecost of his own I like that because John already had a Pentecost but now now he has a Pentecost of his own now is a now it's a different season it's a different time he says John must have really had a Pentecost of his own brother man says talk about a happy time when then seals broke when the when the book was opened before Israel the the Levites were quick and said no now's not a time to cry Now's the Time To Worship Now's the Time To Praise Now's the Time to Rejoice because that was the season and when this seven sealed book is opened up it's a season of worship it's a season of Joy it's a season of Praise it's a season of Happiness not enthusiasm for enthusiasm sake not to be happy just to be a worshiper not just to be charismatic not to just be Pentecostal but the bride has a Pentecost of her own this is her Reviving this is her Joy what is it it's Christ making himself known when the bride begins to line herself up with the word of God that's your rejoicing that's your Revival it's an understanding it's a knowledge it's in Revelation that's our new song brother Branham says makes this statement in the breach musicians please come and the sermon the breach Abraham's describing this scene he says the lamb proceeded out into the vision now I want you to notice we read when we I'm getting into my next one just looking at the clock we're just just into the after hour said the bride we could sit hour after hour right drinking in these things but I'm going to touch on this maybe it'll just kind of wet the whistle a little bit for next time we usually read it that Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah and then we see the image of a lamb and the order sometimes causes us to miss what's happened he was the lamb but now he's the lion that's what's changed he didn't change from a lion into a lamb he's introduced as the lion though he even though he had been the lamb so what is it there's a name change there's something changed there's something changing in this time in this season he says the lamb proceeded from the vision come from the father's Throne he says oh think where did he advance from to this vision he come from Glory where he seated the right hand of God he Advanced forth to John out of Glory now this is the part that I want you to to recognize for ourselves he says all would not it be glorious if our sinful thoughts tonight could be laid aside long enough to accepting him he would Advance all the way from Glory tonight to make himself known to anyone the lamb advancing from glory for intercessions to make claims now for his Redemption that's what's happened in the bridge Brothers preaching the breach we'll touch on this next time or at least hopefully next year even maybe if necessary but think about now brother I'm standing there and he's going to be the one later on in the sermon says oh maybe I'm just feeling this way brother Abraham yes you're the only one that could feel the weight of that calling you're the only angel that could Proclaim that and he actually utters the very words let him come and claim this book he says let him come now a forever hold his peace you realize brother Madam had been trained for that moment as a young man he learned the price for not being where he should be when he ought to be there when he didn't go to the Pentecostals when he was supposed to brother Adam paid the price when he wasn't walking in the vision that one time brother Branham had been trained and molded whatever you do don't miss it because everything hangs in balance at that very moment he says oh this is the only way you'll ever be redeemed here's the title deed of redemption of the whole heavens and earth can you think about what hung on that moment in brother Bam's desert had he not been there in that moment where would we be he had to be there in that moment God orchestrating his Angel God orchestrated his star so he could come to that very place let him come and he gives us this invitation wouldn't it be glorious if he would Advance tonight all the way to make himself known to make claims for his Redemption would it not be glorious if we could just put our sinful thoughts aside long enough to accept him could you receive him this is the time this is the hour that we're living in [Music] oh I say I'm so thankful for this messenger I'm so thankful for how faithful he was to speak these things to us there's statements brother Branham says he's identifying just how odd and peculiar it might be and how people may look at it and question it he says I know it sounds strange to you but God has Vindicated it so perfectly you realize what the the Grinch wants to steal the joy that's related to this what he wants to take okay I'll give you another word play he wants to take away the presence he wants you to believe that what we have is just what's always been right just another just another order of the church ages and he wants to take away the very reason for the bride's rejoicing the very reason why we could be happy he wants to rob that from us this is something that when Jesus says you'll see me again in that Joy no man can take away from you all right because it's the season of Joy if we can recognize our death say away with the seasonal affective disorder away with being sad this is the time to Rejoice oh if he could put aside our carnal thoughts love it put aside the people's ideas long enough to accepting him he is our joy he is our peace I'm thankful for this I Want To Praise Him for this I I'm not just I'm not just happy because he sent it I'm happy in what he sent I'm happy and wanty revealed I'm happy in what he's doing I can even say that my joy as your pastor is in you the very bread of life has brought you forth you're the very manifestation of his presence you are the Vindication that the badship is here I'm rejoicing in that I don't rejoice in anything else I have no other Glory but in the work of God and what he's doing that's my praise that's my joy that's my happiness or how we could be thankful a prophet stood here in the breach and said let him come tis the season for worship for joy thank you for the cross thank you for your nails [Music]
