TRANSCRIPT
========================================
if you have your bibles while i have you uh standing with me uh in honor of the word i'd like to remain standing and read over in hebrews chapter 11 this is no surprise i'm if if you uh have heard we've been in the book of hebrews for a while uh with a bible study um with our employees and so uh it's certainly my children are are probably cringing thinking here we go another lesson from the book of hebrews from dad but uh it's just so good you know you just this is meat that you can chew on uh for a while and and it doesn't lose its flavor hebrews chapter 11. um we'll begin at uh let's just begin at verse 23 and we'll read down through verse 26 by faith moses when he was born was hid three months of his parents because they saw he was a proper child and they were not afraid of the king's commandment by faith moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of god than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season esteeming the reproach of christ greater riches than the treasures in egypt for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward amen let's just bow our heads for a word of prayer lord jesus we thank you god that we have the freedom lord to come into a place and to read this word of god lord the bible is such a precious thing to us lord it is we realize your word says that heavens and earth will pass away but not one word of god will pass and lord we are resting in that lord we uh when all things seem to fall around us god there's one thing we have found sure in our lives and that is your word and god not just your word but your spirit along with your word and lord we thank you for that we ask god that you would take this word tonight that lord you would find good betting ground in our hearts to place and plant that word that it would bring forth fruit lord for you and god for your harvest we ask that you would be pleased with us lord in our offering of thanksgiving and praise that we give to you tonight lord we believe again that in your presence god all things are possible lord we are asking that you would raise up those that would be sick those perhaps even in the hospital lord jesus that would call upon your name believing lord that in divine healing that you are still our healer and lord god we pray that you would encourage those that are discouraged and bring back the backslider into the fold we ask that god you would do this for we ask these things in jesus christ's name amen man god bless you you can be seated i send greetings from sister grace my wife who could not be with us this evening and thought that it would probably be a good thing also if she didn't come that the two-year-old wouldn't come either and so i hope you all enjoy the noise free service tonight from at least our two-year-old and it's good to see our friends each and every one of you um certainly happy to be gathered in a place of friends and not a hostile environment uh it makes it so much nicer um we've been studying in the book of hebrews um with some employees during a bible study and i just want to make it note of the time and we've come upon hebrews chapter 11 and i would say hebrews chapter 11 is probably one of the more preached upon chapters in in in in in the bible and so um i as we got to chapter 11 in our bible study one of the young men took a look at these each and every character that was mentioned in this book and they said you know it seems so many times that when i read about the faith of these individuals that we read about in the bible it seems like they've got real faith and sometimes when i look at the decisions that i've made in my life i question whether is it is it faith or is it not faith that i'm doing the things that i'm doing because it seems as though perhaps the the decisions that i make in life they don't stack up to be maybe as crucial as what we read about some of these characters in the bible um the decisions that they made but the conclusion that this young man made in the bible study was nonetheless it is faith that that that even i as a christian today the decisions that i make for uh for for the word of god and and for our lord it is still the same faith and i i i want to turn over um before i get too far ahead of myself over into the book of mark and i want to read you a portion of scripture in mark chapter 10 and i'll explain to you the purpose of this and i want to begin at verse 17 and read down to the 22nd verse and when he was gone forth into the way there came one running and kneeled to him and asked him good master what shall i do that i may inherit eternal life and jesus said unto him why call us thou me good there is none good but one that is god thou knowest the commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness defraud not honor thy father and mother and he answered and said unto him master all these have i observed from my youth and jesus beholding him loved him and said unto him one thing thou lackest go thy way sell whatsoever thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come take up the cross and follow me and he was sad at that saying and went away grieved for he had great possessions this evening i'd like to speak to you about choice and i took these notes for a bible study i was going to do for a group of young people and the lord knows my heart i love to talk to the young people i i i believe that these children are the cream of the crop as far as the children go um i believe that i've seen a desire from so many young people to serve god like we would serve god and i believe that um they too have choices you know one place brother branham said uh there are two changes of life that we go through and most of us know about that middle of life that transition in the middle of life and and many people go through what they would call a midlife crisis but brother branham said that there's also a change of life from the adolescents into a young adult that that is also a great change of life and and i can say amen to that i can remember boy that was a tough transition in life going from that age and so i don't want to overlook our our young people i don't want to overlook our children and so uh if you all will just bear with me um i'd like to talk about choice tonight and i believe um this discussion i've had this discussion with brother lucas i believe he also put together i think a little uh study and maybe he talked to the young people about choice as well from my recollection of our discussion and i i i i hope that this isn't just um just a rip-off of of of his study um but that something that we can each glean from tonight uh viktor frankl said everything can be taken from a man but one thing the last of the human freedoms to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances to choose one's own way now viktor frankl was a a psychiatrist i believe a psychologist and a survivor of the nazi holocaust and he has put together i think i don't know what i think what they call it but something called logotherapy logos therapy and um he believes that adversity and things in life help us make decisions to find meaning in life and and we find that to be true we we can see that even in the word of god but choice here viktor frankl says is the last of the human freedoms and choice ah comes to each and every one of us and more than one time a day and i've always said it like this um the choices you make is like dropping uh a pebble in a in a in a pond or or a lake and it causes ripples the choice you make will affect you and others around you more than you think just the the one-time drop does because the ripples will will go on and on and on and you say well that scares me a little bit i don't know if i want my decisions to i don't know what kind of effect it's going to have on others around me and that so that scares me a little bit and so maybe i don't want to make a choice you know we laugh um i'm sure some of you have have gone through this um when you finish a service maybe a sunday morning service and the family gets in the car and it's where are we going to eat and everybody says well i don't know you choose well you know i don't know you choose you choose you choose and and they're they're so many times our families probably sat in the car for 10 minutes trying to create or somebody to come up with a decision uh you know where are we going to eat and and uh a lot of times it ends up a fast food because we we just couldn't make up our minds but if you're if you say well i just don't want to make the choice well failure to make a choice is still a choice and it too will have effect in your life now i read these scriptures here um and and your homework i always like to leave congregations with homework uh is to go in your in your own with with your own choice at your own true choice of time even to go and listen to a message called leadership roman reads these scriptures here in that message leadership and he's showing the difference between two young men the the young man moses who was a rich young ruler and this young man found in mark chapter 10 who also was a rich young ruler and each of them was faced with a choice and one chose one way to live for god and one chose unfortunately another way and we find him in another scripture with his eyes lifting up in hell begging for a drop of water and last week a week ago tonight we listened in to the service here brother aaron preached a service called blind trust bad faith and i thought it was tremendous and i would be happy to sign up for the puzzle club that brother aaron was talking about putting together uh and it and i i think it's a little bit humorous the very next day while we were having the bible study brother aaron's uncle brother dennis mcgeary was at the bible study and he happened to be talking about putting the puzzle together as well and i thought did you listen into the service and he didn't i i confirmed he did not listen into the service but he was talking about you know i used to i used to put the puzzle pieces together by looking at the shape of the puzzle piece he says but as i've gotten older i've learned to uh be able to look at the color of of the thing and be able to put the the pieces together by by the by where they go in the color of course he wasn't talking about actually puzzles he was talking about ministering and and looking at the bigger picture um and i and this might seem strange that i keep going along this line of the puzzles but i'm colorblind and so i don't have that choice so many times to look at the color and so i i was when brother aaron was saying you know maybe i should just put together a class on how to build puzzles i thought brother i'm signed me up not just for literally building puzzles but i thought the way he put together blind trust and bad faith and discussing thomas and discussing the different characters of the bible who didn't come out of just blind trust to the lord that they had received a testimony and seen something whether it was in the word of god or in the life of christ or in the life of a believer that caused them to have trust to put their trust in in jesus christ and therefore they could have faith in what they were believing and i thought oh lord i i find that so so well thought out that i thought you know brother aaron was saying you know i don't know if when i'm going to get back to this subject and i thought well man that's exactly where i want to talk about is is is that faith and that trust when we discuss choice tonight and uh it i'm sure i'm not gonna touch anything that he's he's where he's going but um i just find it remarkable i was thinking about when brother aaron was speaking of of thomas and how that thomas simply desired to have the same experience the other disciples had that they had seen the lord resurrected they met him when on their way to the tomb thomas didn't have that opportunity and so he said well i won't believe until i can actually put my finger in the scar or put thrust my hand into his side and the lord was so gracious not to rebuke thomas but to say here here you go here's your opportunity thomas and then to say more blessed are those who have not seen and yet believe and and and we find that that that there are those uh who who upon hearing a testimony believe uh not as brother branham said just blindly but because and we're gonna we're gonna show examples of that tonight but because they were able to to put their trust into either the word of god or the testimony of somebody who knew god he mentioned i say he mentioned brother aaron mentioned philip going to nathanael and saying we've seen we've found the messiah and nathanael saying whoa jesus of nazareth and he said wait a second can any good thing come out of nazareth and philip just said look come see for yourself so when nathanael comes and jesus beholding him with the with that prophetic ministry able to to discern says to nathanael behold an israelite in whom there is no guile and nathanael just upon hearing that says thou art the son of god and and jesus asked him because i told you who you were you believe and his brother aaron said nathanael was saying yeah exactly just because of that gift you telling me who i am i do believe that you're the son of god and jesus said well you'll see greater things than this and and and it it causes my mind immediately to go to those to the prayer lines and to go to the things that you that you've heard so many times on tape that when when the discernment would would take place and uh somebody would come through the line and and and brother branham was able to just read their mail basically just read things into their lives that nobody could know and and time after time this would happen and and and then you could hear on so many tapes him saying um you know if if one of these signs was done in some of these other places overseas if just one of these multitudes of people would come upon just seeing one of these signs he says why is it that we as americans uh and here in the us and in in in these first world countries why is it that we have to see more and see more and see more and we we could probably dissect that and find out why it is that it takes more than one time more than one time but we do realize that for some of us it takes it just does it takes more like i'll say this there are a few skills that i've i've learned in my life i've been mastered by any means but i've learned and sometimes i feel so sheepish i i i used to work with my dad doing finnish carpentry and he was showing me when you're working with not paint grade but stain grade doors and base and casing and handrails um you've got to be pretty precise you can't just fill the gaps up with with caulking and and paint it it's it's got to be very precise and so he was desiring to show me how uh the tricks and the trade to how to do that how to to to make everything fit so nicely without without large gaps and many times he would show me and he would say you got it and i would say can you show me again he's like sure so he'd go through it again he cut a piece of wood we'd go through it he'd say all right you got it now can you show me again and there's been certain things that there's well i'll i'll i guess i'll you know confessions good for the soul there's been certain times people have have showed me several times and said you got it and i i was so embarrassed just to say no that i would just say sure yeah i got it and then they would leave and i would scratch my head and say i didn't get it you know i have no idea i i have no idea what i'm doing but then when i when you get it when i get it it was it was there it was nailed down and and from then on it was just off to the races and i could just do it like like i'd like i'd known how to do it all the time and god is so good to us to be long-suffering to say you got it lord i don't know i don't i all right that's all right we'll go through this again and and i love it how that as a 40 year old man i can sit down with my children and if they get excited about something they see in the bible they're probably i think so many times they look to me like dad you've probably known this forever but i'm so excited to say tonight that there's still things even last when last wednesday when brother aaron was showing a different way at looking at thomas as we would call him doubting thomas and saying no listen he still believed just like the others believed and i thought my i've never seen it like that before and i was so excited because i'm 40 years old and i saw something for the first time and so when we even as all this as as as you can get i don't think you it would matter how old you got when god shows you something and you get it it anchors down in your heart and you say lord i got it i got it thank you god for revelation that hits home and and revelation doesn't just just just move with the wind but it's anchored in the word oh my it's just tremendous and and so uh i i want to go through a couple characters in the bible and demonstrate especially to these young people demonstrate the faith that god gives to a believer that it is faith and it's good faith it's warranted faith and so i'd i'd like to start by just rehearsing this for you as we were going through our bible study we got into chapter 10 and at verse 26 you come to this place where paul says if we sin willfully after that we've received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins you go whoa that's heavy i jump over to verse 29 of how much sore punishment suppose ye shall shall he be thought worthy who hath trodden underfoot the son of god and hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing and hath done despite unto the spirit of grace man that's heavy and it is it's a very serious very serious subject but i jumped down and i i told these young men at the bible study i said you know so many times we jump over to hebrews 11 and we say you know i just want to read about those the the heroes of faith i just want to read about the heroes of faith but if you would prelude it with chapter 10 and you see this you say whoa who are these and paul i said look before you ever jump into chapter 11 and just start reading from verse 1 i said just imagine that that chapter 11 isn't there just imagine that that chapter 11 starts two verses higher and you start reading chapter 11 actually chapter 10 verse 38 now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him but we are not of them who draw back unto perdition but of them that believe to the saving of the soul now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen and goes on explain to us now what faith is he says now the just shall live by that faith and we're not of them that will draw back but we're of these in chapter 11. and when you when you can start the chapter like that then you're not looking at each of these characters as wow look at them but you're realizing paul's saying we are of them we are one of them and you say oh okay tell me more well i will tell you more let's go to one of those to to such a character and i'm turning over into joshua now therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood and in egypt and serve ye the lord and if it seems evil unto you to serve the lord choose you this day whom you will serve here we go here's that choice whether the gods which your father served that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the amorites in whose land he dwell but as for me and my house we will serve the lord now i don't believe that joshua at this point is saying now you all choose i'm going to turn my back but as for me now i'm gonna serve the lord and then he's looking back over his shoulder going what now what are you all gonna do now what are you what are you all gonna do i don't believe josh was doing that joshua's showing his faith where his faith is established and he's saying now you get the choice you get to choose whom you will serve now let's let's continue to read and the people answered and said god forbid that we should forsake the lord to serve other gods for the lord our god he it is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of egypt from the house of bondage and which did those great signs in our sight and preserved us in all the way wherein we went and among all the people through whom we passed these people are saying we believe also in the same god you believe in because we have witnessed what he has done as well and that is what excited me so much about last week's service was we have something to base our faith on we have something to put our trust in because we have seen for ourselves what god has done for us now i i'm just going through these just a couple characters so that we can get through this i wanted to turn to a couple a couple of of the sisters in the bible so many times we read about you know we've already read about moses and we've already read about joshua and uh i like for for for the girls you know the little girls i got i've got girls i'd like for them to see that hey you know what about us what choices do we have to make in life well you've got some choices to make too and so let's look at a couple of those i'm turning over into the book of ruth for you young ladies that want to turn over into the book of ruth we're going to read from ruth chapter one and we're going to begin at verse 10 and read on down to verse 17. and they said unto her this mrs ruth and orpah saying unto naomi surely we will return with thee unto thy people and naomi said turn again my daughters why will ye go with me are there yet any more sons in my womb that they may be your husbands turn again my daughters go your way for i'm too old to have a husband if i should say i have hope if i should say if if i should have a husband also tonight and should also hear hav or bear sons would you tarry for them till they were grown would ye stay for them from having husbands nay my daughters forgiveth me much for your sakes for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the lord is gone out against me and they lifted up their voice and wept again oh no doubt and orpah kissed her mother-in-law but ruth clave unto her and she said behold thy sister-in-law has gone back unto her people and unto her gods return thou after thy sister-in-law and ruth said entreat me not to leave thee or to return from following after thee for wither thou goest i will go and where thou largest i will lodge thy people shall be my people and thy god my god where thou diest will i die and there will i be buried the lord do so to me and more also if ought but death part thee and me here's a choice set before ruth and orpah you're going to stay with me your mother-in-law you notice the inflection i put there so many people they that's that's kind of how they always say their in-laws you know my father-in-law says you know the difference between in-laws and outlaws is outlaws are wanted and he says but you're not my in-laws you're not my sons-in-laws you're my son in grace and so i say oh thanks dad but here's their mother-in-law it's not even their own mother it's not even their own father it's their mother-in-law their mother-in-law says look he my husband's died my sons have died your husbands and you get listen i'm gonna make this easy for you i'll make the decision easy for you go back to your own family you enter into the same church you used to go to you go probably get go to the same people you grew up knowing and probably get a job a lot easier i don't make the just go it's okay i can't help you i got nothing to help you with and orpah says boy that sounds right you know i i'm gonna go but ruth ruth why did she choose naomi what was it that she would choose naomi over her own family they say well we don't know maybe she didn't have family and maybe but what i see here is that ruth saw something in naomi's life that was real ruth saw a testimony that naomi hill had believing in a god that that naomi made so real that i knew to be a real god that that knew to be the one true living god and and ruth saw this and ruth had confidence in naomi's testimony ruth had confidence in that because she'd seen with her own eyes she'd felt it the the the love and the embrace from from her own arms she had recognized that this that naomi believed was more than just a a hope so a a wish for type of life it was a real life and so her this faith she had in her mother-in-law carried her far enough to make a decision to let your people be my people let your god my god where you die that's wherever you live i want to live there that's where i want to live i want to be around you there's something different and and she even when she went with her mother-in-law then she's she's relying upon her mother-in-law's instruction what should i do and her mother-in-law says go away glean over in this field and and and and when you do and and and her perhaps her mother-in-law saw the the the the glimmer in boaz's eyes when he looked at ruth and and and he saw uh the the favor that he showed unto ruth and perhaps her mother-in-law caught that enough to give her wisdom enough to go on but when ruth experienced for herself who boaz was and and who this god was ruth uh embraced that on her own choice with her own decision and god carried her through all the way another character for you sisters is an esther and then esther chapter four again beginning at verse 10 again esther spake unto hate act and gave him commandment unto mordechai this is her response to mordecai all the king's servants and the people of the king's provinces do know that whosoever whether man or woman shall come unto the king into the inner court who's not called there's one law of his to put him to death except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden scepter that he may live but i've not been called to come in unto the king these 30 days and they told to mordecai esther's words then mordecai commanded to answer esther think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king's house more than all the jews for if thou all together hold us thy peace at this time then shall their enlargement and deliverance arise to the jews from another place but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this then esther paid them returned mordecai this answer go gather together all the jews that are present in shushen and fast ye for me and neither eat nor drink three days night or day i also and my maidens will fast likewise and so will i go in unto the king which is not according to the law and if i perish i perish now that's a choice to make there is set a crossroads before esther and now once again esther is relying upon the trust she's got in uncle mordecai she's relying that he's saying listen he's given her instructions thus far he's told her how to conduct herself thus far and she's made it into the into the palace thus far and uncle mordecai has always given her godly counsel uncle mordecai has has has given her her aid in such a way that she can trust uncle mordecai and uncle mordecai certainly is not uh taking any glory for who he is but uncle mordecai is sharing with esther what he believes who he believes in because uncle mordecai says listen here comes a decree and he gave her the decree that had already gone out the law that had been made and he said this is coming down and you've got to go into the king and discuss this you are a jew it affects you she's like i can't do that he says listen if you don't do it i believe in a god who's so big that he'll enlarge he'll be enlarged and he'll find another way to save the children of israel because i believe that god made a promise for these children for this group of people the seed of abraham i believe in a god who has shown himself to be faithful to these children time and time and time again and he'll do it again if he did it once he'll do it again and these are the words of mordecai this is the faith of mordecai now he says uh i don't know what's gonna happen to you esther that's reassuring you know i i i really don't know if you're going to die or not but who knows perhaps you were sent here for such a time as this well once again my thoughts are drawn to is esther asked to use blind faith blind trust in making this decision no esther begins drawing from a resource that's already there her trust that uncle mordecai knows a god and knows the word of god and has lived a life that has shown he believes that god is a deliverer and so esther is now relying upon this and saying he's never let me down before you go tell him to tell everybody you know that's a believer let's pray fast let's fast and let's pray let's approach god this is a serious matter i don't think that i have to draw a whole lot from you to make you think do you know about serious matters like this i believe we each understand matters like this they're very serious now i'm not gonna i'm not gonna continue to read through but we know the end of this story that esther goes before the king and she recognizes that she's not just somebody just anybody but that she's found favor with the king that the king isn't just acknowledging her as some some lady in the kingdom or or some servant but she finds out that he loves her that it's it's not a matter of laws it's not a matter of of uh an audience with the king it's a it's about a relationship she discovers that he loves her so much that he tells her i'll give you it's all yours he says up to half i think i'll give up to half the kingdom you just say the word and when esther's trust and esther experiences for herself not mordecai mordecai he wasn't there for that part mordecai didn't get to experience the relationship esther got to experience with the king this was between esther and the king and she discovered that this king not only just found favor but he loved her he loved her he desired for her to be his wife to share in all of his glory to share in all of his secrets to share in all of these things and when she discovered that that it wasn't about just this he's the king and i'm subservient to him but that that's he wants me to be his wife he wants me to to sit and to rule and to reign with him when she discovered this is about more it's about a relationship her trust was anchored and she was able then to say i i'd like to set a dinner how about that now esther's trust and her faith begins to build in in her position and her uh relationship with the king so much so that he says what would you like to do dear and she says well i'll tell you what i like to do let's have ourselves a dinner huh and how about you bring el haymon along with with in in absolutely anybody you'd like bring them along esther now begins to set the stage to make things right to bring about the uh hidden ill motives that have been set out there and oh my that just makes my heart just swell in size that our faith is not just in a distant god it's not just in a well he's god and and i'm i'm i'm a i'm just a human down here just trying to you know to pull my pull my weight you know to stack the blocks for this you know this great thing that's happening but when you discovered for yourself that he loved you that all the plan of redemption was about a relationship was about a marriage was about a family and you begin to discover that you're not just an orphan the devil would like to pull that one right over your eyes that you're not just some uh washer girl that's got to be in the back while the other ones are dancing so frolicking around with beautiful dress and that you're just there you're just the downtrodden cousin but no he loves you he desires to marry you and and it doesn't it doesn't cause the believer to rise up and say well then you know let my voice be heard oh no quite the contrary you say oh lord why me why me but your confidence begins to build your trust in god begins to build in that relationship and that faith then is no longer blind faith but it's a faith in an experience you've had that he's been faithful he's been faithful he's been faithful oh my i'm going back to hebrews chapter 11. and we see that this first verse chapter or verse 23 in chapter 11 says by faith moses when he was born was hid three months of his parents we find this was the faith of his parents they believed that god had given them a proper child that this child was different that god was going to use this child and their faith caused them to go into action and to hide moses during these three months and we realized that as moses was carried into the palace and raised by pharaoh's daughter that god so ordained things that his own mother got to be his wet nurse she got to raise her own child and get paid for it in the palace and through the stories and and and and and i guess by faith we can we get to envision moses's mother jockbed telling moses about her god telling moses about his people telling moses the stories that uh were from the beginning perhaps the creation and and the promise of the woman's seed and the messiah to come and and all of the promises of god that were given to abraham and to isaac to joseph and and and and oh how she must have you know even sharing with moses we're in the land of egypt and and here's the reason why we're in the land of egypt and let me tell you about joseph and how that god preserved him and and set him up in a place and and sharing these things in order to raise her child now imagine she's just a wet nurse and so this relationship that she gets to have in the palace with her own son goes for how long i i would say maybe maybe we could be generous and say 10 12 years old before she's let go you're not needed anymore as a wet nurse but she's instilled these things into moses these stories this sunday school for the kids not just for fun not just for the candy but for life for life lessons that are going to come away come across his way but now she's done as a wet nurse and now moses is turned over into the hands of the egyptian teachers now moses is turned over into the hands of the egyptian priests now he's turned over into the hands of the egyptian commanders moses is now being trained under egyptian training during this first transition from adolescence to adult life a very serious time in a child's life and we don't get all of the description between verse 23 and verse 24. we don't get that whole drama that unfolded in those years but what we do understand is that by faith moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer the affliction with the people of god than to enjoy the pleasures pleasures of sin for a season is steaming that reproach of christ great greater riches than all those of egypt brother branham says that one day moses was looking walking by a window and he looked out the window and he saw the hebrew children making bricks mud daubers and something in his heart said those are my people i'm a part of that and was it moses's own choosing or was there a foundation that had been built by his mother when he was young that even when he was in the hands of the egyptian priests even though he was in the hands of the scholars of egypt even when he was in the hands of all the the commanders of egypt who promised moses might and power and popularity and strength and all of that still there was something in moses a representation that god had put within moses that when those when he could look out the window us his mother's words could come back into his mind and he could see something that was real a people that were willing to even forsake uh riches forsake the the great things of god that were willing to die that were willing to live a life of slavery and yet serve a god that was real now the long story is right that that faith carried moses far enough to kill one egyptian and then out of fear he flees and even when he's standing before god before that pillar of fire he says lord and god says i'm going to send you moses but i'll go before you but i'm sending you to go to egypt to pharaoh and and moses says i can't talk i don't have the ability to talk but moses says god says to moses you know bring aaron you know he'll talk for you but i'm the one who will go before you moses moses now had received an experience in the presence of god as you hear so many times on tape not to kill one egyptian but to go and before a whole nation not in fear anymore not in hopes so anymore now with an assurance that he met the god who created all heavens and all earth the god who is so mighty that he could open up the red sea moses now met that god and by that experience now moses's faith is based on something to do more than just slay one egyptian oh my and i i printed up these quotes and i'm not gonna read them all but they're on free moral agency and there's a couple places where brother branham says that that god put us on equal terms with him by giving us free moral agency you think wow that's a that's a tremendous thought that god himself acts upon free moral agency and god through foreknowledge and desiring to put you on equal basis to put mankind on equal basis gives them free moral agency and he says even knowing that when he gave adam and eve free moral agency they would choose wrong that their choice would be the wrong choice and him knowing that by foreknowledge he set the motions of the plan of redemption into place because he desired he desired to put to bring forth the attributes of a savior to bring forth the attributes of a healer to being bring forth the attributes of a father it's so many times we the prophet of god just continually brings out that on our own with our on our own choice just as as men and women as carnal men and women born into the sin into this world in sin the choices we make eventually lead us to the wrong they're the wrong choices and even with good intentions even though those that have got the best intentions out of our own capacity out of our own mental capacity our own desires eventually we go astray we choose the wrong way we'll choose the easy way and i want to close with this thought in galatians chapter 4 verse 6 it says this let's start up higher let's just read from verse 1 down to verse 6. now i say that the heir as long as he is a child differeth nothing from a servant though he be lord of all but as under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of the time was come god sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because ye are sons and daughters god hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying abba father god god is so good to us to speak of the goodness of god we couldn't we would exhaust every service doing that but to see that you god knowing you were a son of god god knowing that moses was his son god knowing that joshua was his son and the children would believe uh caleb and joshua god knowing that ruth was his daughter god knowing that esther was his god knowing that that those were his sons that was his daughters but he wouldn't be just unless he gave them free moral agency to choose for themselves and his brother aaron was expressing they it wasn't just throwing a dart in the dark it wasn't just faith based on on hope so god knowing that you were a son and daughter of god and that so many times your own choices let you down they just they continue to let you down but god loving us so much he sent his spirit so that so that he could help you make the decision not that he would make the decision for you but that he himself would live inside you so that you could have trust in his decision so that you could have trust and faith in god in the very life of god that you could have the same experiences that the disciples had that that that thomas had not that you would have to physically see him but that you could know him that you could know him and that you could put trust that this same jesus christ that you read about you didn't get to see him you didn't get to even though you say that's what i would have needed to i would have needed to touch him i would have needed to to feel the scars maybe i would have needed that maybe i would you could call me thomas but god knowing that god uh he gave you some the best thing he could give you that was the very life that was in jesus christ to guide your decision to help you make that decision based upon something you've got can have faith in that's his eternal word and it just thrills my heart to look into this bible and to see that there's testimony after testimony after testimony of those who made life-changing decisions decisions that were enormous not only for themselves but for people around them it wasn't it wasn't blind it wasn't blind trust god gave he he gave example after example opportunity after opportunity that we could put our trust in these in these examples in in the word of god back here in the word of god back here back here all the way to our very own day to where we could see one another the testimony that each one of us has and say if god could do it for him if god could do it for her god you're still the same i believe that and i could have faith that you'll do the same god bless you this evening let's stand together oh take courage church we're not of them that draw back our heart has no pleasure in drawing back but but the just shall live by faith that's what we live by is the faith this mysterious faith as his brother aaron read amen i have decided to follow jesus
