[0:00] Acts chapter 2 verse 44
[0:05] it says, "And all that believed were
[0:07] together and had all things common and
[0:11] sold their possessions and goods and
[0:13] parted them to all men as every man had
[0:16] need." And all that believed were
[0:18] together and had all things common and
[0:20] sold their possessions and goods and
[0:22] parted them as to all men as every man
[0:24] had need. You can be seated.
[0:28] I'm going to take my title directly from
[0:30] uh this scripture verse 44 it says all
[0:33] things common and continue on that
[0:35] subject we've been on of community
[0:38] trying to draw it from uh the scripture
[0:40] here where the Bible even mentioning
[0:42] that they continued in fellowship that
[0:44] word there is that togetherness or that
[0:46] community and so there's definitely a
[0:48] scriptural principle here worth
[0:49] exploring so if you could just look back
[0:52] at these verses we've just mentioned
[0:53] verses 44 and 45 and all that believe
[0:56] were together and that's very important
[0:58] aspect. They were of the same mind and
[1:00] the same heart and had all things
[1:02] common. And it's because of this basis.
[1:04] It says they sold their possessions and
[1:05] goods imparted them to all men as every
[1:08] man had need. When it says all things
[1:10] common, doesn't say all things in
[1:13] common, but it says all things common.
[1:15] It means ordinary or belonging to all.
[1:17] So that there was this uh what they had
[1:19] or that they o owned they used together
[1:22] or jointly or they um they were willing
[1:25] to share it or shared by all or many is
[1:27] how that might uh be phrased and they
[1:29] sold as much as was necessary so that
[1:32] they would have means to support those
[1:33] who didn't have. So someone had property
[1:35] and they could sell it and be a benefit
[1:37] and a blessing to those who didn't have
[1:40] um to those who had needs. That's what
[1:42] the scripture is uh referencing is the
[1:44] fact that what they had if they needed
[1:47] to they sold it and they shared the
[1:49] proceeds among everyone. Again, if this
[1:51] if you're just visiting today, we have a
[1:53] number of visitors. Don't get nervous.
[1:54] We're not doing our best to start a
[1:56] commune or redistribute wealth. We're
[1:58] just looking at this scriptural
[2:00] principle. And some have read this to
[2:02] mean, well, we all need to wear the same
[2:03] clothes. We all need to have all of our
[2:05] possessions in common. But that's not
[2:07] what the scripture is uh establishing as
[2:10] a precedent. The word common also is
[2:13] translated to unclean or defiled or
[2:15] unholy. And it's very interesting uh it
[2:19] in that context that they regarded or
[2:21] they had all things common. They looked
[2:24] at it in the sense that it's not sacred
[2:25] or holy. So anything was eligible to be
[2:28] let go of. There was nothing there was
[2:31] no sacred cows as it were that they
[2:33] would protect at all cost. everything
[2:35] was just common and so they regarded
[2:37] their earthly possessions, their assets,
[2:39] their income, all those things as
[2:41] ordinary such as they're willing to
[2:43] share it with whoever needed it or who
[2:45] would benefit from it. We find that it's
[2:47] not just isolated Acts 2 though it is uh
[2:51] it is mentioned amongst the church at
[2:53] Jerusalem in Acts 4:32
[2:56] says and the multitude of them that
[2:57] believed were of one heart and of one
[2:59] soul. Again, this is this uh the
[3:02] preamble to this giving away is the they
[3:05] were of one heart, one soul. As it says
[3:08] in Acts chapter 2, they were together
[3:10] and then before all that they believed.
[3:12] So there was a common faith and then
[3:14] there was a common mind and heart.
[3:16] Neither said any of them that ought of
[3:18] the things which he possessed was his
[3:20] own, but they had all things common.
[3:22] There's that phrase again where they had
[3:26] what they possessed and what they owned
[3:27] was shared. And the scriptures go on to
[3:30] describe those acts in Acts 4:es 32 and
[3:34] beyond. It tells what they did to
[3:36] distribute those things. And these
[3:38] scriptures at the very least show that
[3:40] there was some sense of togetherness or
[3:42] family or relationship or responsibility
[3:44] to one another. Uh elements that we
[3:47] might say reflect a community where
[3:49] they're unified together around
[3:50] something. They have some basis for
[3:52] feeling together. So, it shows this need
[3:55] for community, but then also the
[3:56] responsibility that one has when they
[3:58] are a part of something. And as we went
[4:01] over on Wednesday night, there's many
[4:03] different scriptures that demonstrate
[4:05] the that believers have a responsibility
[4:07] to, as the Bible says, the household of
[4:09] faith, do good unto all men, especially
[4:11] those of the household of faith. That
[4:13] there um there are those in your own
[4:15] family, a man has to take care of his
[4:17] family. There's a lot of
[4:18] responsibilities we have. So a lot of
[4:20] scriptures uh speak to this
[4:22] responsibility that we have as believers
[4:25] to be giving to look out after the needs
[4:28] of others.
[4:29] And the uh where we arrived at Wednesday
[4:32] night and I think this is the very
[4:33] important part. The strength to perform
[4:35] this duty is not found in being told
[4:38] that you have to do it. I don't think
[4:40] anybody has ever been asked to take out
[4:42] the trash and just because they WERE
[4:43] ASKED LIKE, "OH YES, YES, I've been
[4:46] endued with power from on high to take
[4:48] out the trash. But rather there is a
[4:50] strength in performing this duty is
[4:52] found in the unity of faith and this
[4:54] common love that they had for the word
[4:56] or something else that united them first
[4:58] and something else that they they found
[5:00] that gave them energy or gave them this
[5:02] identification and because they had the
[5:04] same mind and the same love and they
[5:06] were working towards the same goal. As
[5:08] needs arose and as they saw that it was
[5:10] necessary maybe to remove a hindrance or
[5:12] to bear somebody else's burden they
[5:13] gladly stepped in and helped out.
[5:16] So community does not begin with selling
[5:19] everything or just merely establishing
[5:22] that we must serve others. You can be
[5:23] told well eternal life is living for
[5:25] others which we believe but it's just
[5:27] not being told to do it that gives you
[5:29] the power. There has to be something
[5:31] within you.
[5:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:33] &gt;&gt; You can't do it by uh u program or
[5:36] process.
[5:38] You can't just establish well this is
[5:39] the definitions. These are the things
[5:41] we're going to do. And you can't use
[5:43] programs and and processes to make
[5:46] everything in common. That's not what's
[5:48] going to establish to have all things
[5:49] common. But having, and this may just be
[5:52] a little bit of a play on words, but
[5:54] having all things common, as the Bible
[5:56] mentions it in Acts two and Acts four,
[5:57] is possible when Christ is your common
[6:01] all things.
[6:03] &gt;&gt; Maybe just a little bit of maybe seem a
[6:05] little bit awkward, but I think you'll
[6:06] get my point as we continue that we can
[6:08] have all things common. It's possible
[6:10] when Christ is common, the common all
[6:13] things to every single one of us, the
[6:16] whole or every or all as the word all
[6:18] things there implies. If you'll turn to
[6:20] 1 Corinthians chapter 13,
[6:23] we're able just to push a little bit
[6:25] further. I think that sums up the first
[6:27] couple servicees. Well,
[6:29] I want to use this phrase all things in
[6:32] the New Testament to catch uh kind of
[6:34] the meaning of the phrase all things and
[6:36] what it implies uh and then how that
[6:39] it's applicable in Acts chapter 2 and
[6:40] and chapter 4, but then also the lesson
[6:43] that's being demonstrated to us. 1
[6:45] Corinthians chapter 13:es 1:7. Though I
[6:49] speak with tongues of men and angels and
[6:51] have not charity, I become a sounding
[6:53] brass or a tinkling symbol. Now, these
[6:56] are very uh familiar scriptures to us,
[6:58] but think of how he's saying that
[7:00] there's gifts that can be displayed, but
[7:02] if you have not charity, that's going to
[7:03] be the repeated theme. Have not charity.
[7:05] And though I have the gift of prophecy
[7:07] and understand all mysteries and all
[7:09] knowledge, and though I have all faith,
[7:10] so that could remove mountains, and have
[7:12] not charity, I am nothing.
[7:14] &gt;&gt; So, now there's two uh two things to see
[7:17] here. If you have not charity, you have
[7:20] nothing.
[7:21] &gt;&gt; So, there's a there's an idea of
[7:22] nothing. And uh uh if you don't have
[7:25] charity, it's as if you have nothing at
[7:27] all. He says verse three, and though I
[7:29] bestow all my goods to feed the poor,
[7:32] and though I give my body to be burned
[7:34] and have not charity, it profitth me
[7:36] nothing. could bring this back to the
[7:39] scriptures we've read of how that you
[7:40] must be a cheerful giver and you must
[7:42] look after the needs of others and and
[7:44] when you collect your bounty uh give
[7:46] willingly and all these different
[7:47] scriptures that we could use to show
[7:49] that the believers in the New Testament
[7:51] voluntarily and willingly gave and they
[7:54] paid their offerings and they gave
[7:55] tithes and there was ways that they're
[7:56] trying to support and they supported uh
[7:59] regions that had famines and in the
[8:01] early church we see them selling their
[8:03] possessions and distributing the wealth
[8:05] to those who didn't have but He said
[8:07] even if I did all that and didn't have
[8:09] charity it would do me no good. It
[8:11] profitth me nothing. So if you don't
[8:14] have charity kind of the result is
[8:16] nothing. It profits me nothing. I I have
[8:18] I am nothing. Then it describes charity
[8:21] in this way. Charity suffereth long and
[8:23] is kind. Charity envieth not. Charity
[8:26] vaunteth not itself. Is not puffed up.
[8:28] If you have if you name your daughter
[8:29] charity, there's a high bar here.
[8:33] Do not behave itself unseemly. Seketh
[8:35] not her own. So this is that uh every
[8:37] man looking upon the needs of others is
[8:40] not easily provoked thinkketh no evil
[8:43] rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth
[8:45] in the truth and then this phrase
[8:48] beareth all things believeth all things
[8:51] hopeeth all things endureth all things
[8:55] &gt;&gt; there without charity you're nothing
[8:58] and and if without charity it profits
[9:00] you nothing and there's this idea that
[9:02] well if I though I could do these things
[9:04] and speak with these great tongues
[9:06] and I don't have charity then I it's
[9:08] nothing special
[9:10] &gt;&gt; and he goes through these different uh
[9:13] one after another principle after
[9:15] principle after principle then he says
[9:16] but charity bears all things believes
[9:18] all things hopes all things endures all
[9:20] things so now there's not just there's a
[9:23] nothing and then there's everything
[9:25] &gt;&gt; there's a nothing and then there's all
[9:27] things without charity I'm nothing but
[9:29] then charity can bear all things believe
[9:31] all things hope all things endure all
[9:33] things I believe that there's
[9:36] Essentially what that word is meaning is
[9:38] everything.
[9:40] &gt;&gt; And the more I've studied this and found
[9:41] there's so many different phrases all
[9:43] things that it's it's just a word uh
[9:46] that's used to imply everything or the
[9:48] whole. But if charity without charity or
[9:51] nothing, then charity becomes
[9:52] everything.
[9:54] &gt;&gt; That if I could if I could do many
[9:56] wonderful works and have not charity and
[9:57] it profits me nothing, then charity is
[9:59] everything. If I can speak with tongues
[10:01] and don't have charity and it's it's
[10:02] really no distinction in it or I I'm
[10:04] just tooting my own horn, then charity
[10:06] is everything. So essentially charity we
[10:09] say believeth all things. It doesn't
[10:11] mean charity believes a lie.
[10:14] &gt;&gt; But it's it's kind of narrowing what we
[10:16] what all things is to imply. But so we
[10:18] can say let's say that charity is
[10:20] everything.
[10:21] &gt;&gt; Charity is all things. And if that's the
[10:24] case, I I believe we could do the math
[10:26] and say I know I know that makes us
[10:28] cringe. We don't want to have to do math
[10:29] on a Sunday morning, but for the
[10:31] Christian, Christ must be everything.
[10:35] &gt;&gt; Church can't be everything.
[10:37] &gt;&gt; I think it's very brave of me to say as
[10:39] a pastor, church can't be everything.
[10:42] There's one person who wakes up on
[10:43] Sunday morning and and doesn't really
[10:46] have a choice whether or not they want
[10:47] to go, and that's the person preaching.
[10:51] And and you don't say, "I wonder if I
[10:52] want to go to church today." You you
[10:54] just go to church. So my family and I,
[10:56] we uh God has called us to serve the
[10:59] church. So that's our what that's the
[11:01] dominant uh calling in our lives. Well,
[11:04] I know you don't have the same calling.
[11:06] So I'm not going to hold you to the same
[11:07] standard of well, they're not thinking
[11:09] about the church every day and they're
[11:11] not wondering about this and praying
[11:12] about that because church can't be your
[11:14] everything.
[11:15] &gt;&gt; Church shouldn't be your everything.
[11:17] Your family's not your everything.
[11:19] Community is not everything.
[11:21] &gt;&gt; Those things aren't the everything.
[11:23] Christ is the everything.
[11:25] &gt;&gt; Because if Christ isn't the everything,
[11:27] church means nothing.
[11:29] &gt;&gt; Family is going to profit you nothing.
[11:31] There's there's a point at which these
[11:32] things begin to be devalued.
[11:34] &gt;&gt; In 1 Corinthians chapter 15 27 and 28, I
[11:39] want to look at these scriptures that
[11:40] use this phrase in all things to see how
[11:42] that Christ should have uh be
[11:44] everything. For heath put all things
[11:46] under his feet.
[11:47] &gt;&gt; But when he saith all things are put
[11:49] under him, it is manifest that he is
[11:51] expected which did put all things under
[11:53] him. And when all things shall be
[11:55] subdued unto him, then shall the son
[11:57] also himself be subject unto him that
[11:59] put all things under him. Huh? I'm
[12:03] getting dizzy. But all things are under
[12:06] his feet. All things are put under him,
[12:07] subdued under him. He's put all things
[12:09] under that God may be ultimately. Why is
[12:11] all this subduing? Why is all this
[12:13] undering and ordering? That God may be
[12:16] all in all.
[12:17] &gt;&gt; That means overall holy.
[12:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:19] &gt;&gt; Completely. God may be all in all.
[12:22] That's the goal. That God would be all
[12:24] in all.
[12:26] &gt;&gt; So he's putting all things under his
[12:28] feet. God has put all things under the
[12:30] sun, under Christ, and made all things
[12:32] subject so that when that happens, God
[12:34] has the preeminence in everything.
[12:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:36] &gt;&gt; Colossians chapter 1 15 to 20 say, "Who
[12:40] is the image of the invisible God? The
[12:42] firstborn of every creature." This is
[12:43] speaking specifically of Christ. For by
[12:46] him were all things created that are in
[12:48] heaven and that are in earth, visible
[12:50] and invisible, whether they be thrones
[12:53] or dominions or principalities or
[12:54] powers. All things were created by him
[12:57] and for him.
[12:59] &gt;&gt; And he is before all things and by him
[13:01] all things consist.
[13:03] &gt;&gt; We could take this to try to be very
[13:05] very um deliberate in terms of saying
[13:07] well all things he's created all thrones
[13:09] and so we think oh so he's the
[13:10] originator of Game of Thrones. Okay. And
[13:13] dominions. Ah, so he he invented the the
[13:15] card game and principalities. And we
[13:17] begin to think about our high school
[13:18] principal and said, "No, it's not that
[13:20] we're going to try to make everything
[13:21] fit linguistically, but he's just saying
[13:24] this is the totality of things.
[13:27] &gt;&gt; Everything.
[13:28] He is before all things, and by him all
[13:31] things consist. And he is the head of
[13:32] the body, the church, who is the
[13:34] beginning, the firstborn from the dead,
[13:35] that in all things he might have the
[13:38] preeminence." Amen.
[13:39] &gt;&gt; It could be that this phrase in here is
[13:41] what I I'm zeroing in on as I just let
[13:45] it unfold through it last week. That in
[13:47] all things all things he might have the
[13:49] preeminence in everything the preeminent
[13:52] one to be overall. For it pleased the
[13:54] father that in him should all fullness
[13:56] dwell. And having made peace through the
[13:58] blood of his cross by him to reconcile
[14:02] all things unto himself. By him I say
[14:05] whether the the blood um by him I say
[14:07] whether they be things in earth or
[14:09] things in heaven. A lot of things things
[14:13] in heaven things in earth but he says
[14:14] he's going to reconcile all things by
[14:16] himself that in all things he might have
[14:18] the preeminence because he is before all
[14:19] things and by him all things consist
[14:22] that that the the all things now is is
[14:24] is relative and has its meaning in
[14:27] Christ.
[14:29] Ephesians 1:es 22 to 23 and hath put all
[14:32] things under his feet and gave him to be
[14:35] the head over all things to the church
[14:37] which is his body the fullness of him
[14:39] that fleth all in all. Let me be that's
[14:42] another angle to approach that in all
[14:44] things he might have the prim to fillth
[14:46] all in all. He has a body. Christ has a
[14:49] body over which he's the head but the
[14:51] the headship comes so that he can
[14:53] control the body. He can have
[14:54] preeminence in the body.
[14:57] It's what's necessary for a body change.
[15:00] &gt;&gt; He puts everything under his feet. All
[15:02] things, he says, that he might be the
[15:04] head over all things, everything holy to
[15:07] the church.
[15:09] &gt;&gt; That God might be all in all.
[15:13] &gt;&gt; So, if I could phrase it this way,
[15:14] Christ is the all things common to the
[15:17] church.
[15:20] &gt;&gt; And to the Christian, the church being
[15:22] the the body.
[15:23] &gt;&gt; In other words, there's nothing outside
[15:25] of him. That's right.
[15:26] &gt;&gt; What What is What is church if Christ
[15:29] isn't a part of this?
[15:31] &gt;&gt; Could you imagine if you attend a church
[15:33] and the the pastor gets up and says,
[15:35] "We're we're we're no longer a Christian
[15:37] church. We don't want to be identified
[15:39] as Christians and we're not going to
[15:40] preach Christ. We're going to preach
[15:41] good and we're inclusive and everyone
[15:43] can come and be a part of it." Then that
[15:45] changes everything.
[15:48] &gt;&gt; It it the picture's completely changed
[15:51] because Christ is that all things
[15:53] common, everything. He's everything to
[15:55] the to his body and to the Christian
[15:57] individually. Ephesians 1:10 puts it
[16:01] this way that in the dispensation of the
[16:03] fullness of times he might gather
[16:05] together in one all things in Christ. He
[16:10] was to bring these things together,
[16:11] gather together, combine them, join them
[16:14] in one all things in Christ.
[16:18] &gt;&gt; Both which are in heaven and which are
[16:19] on earth, even in him.
[16:22] All things are in Christ. Christ is in
[16:26] all things. This is the kind of the
[16:27] theme we're getting from the scripture.
[16:29] Everything is Christ. Everything I need
[16:31] is him.
[16:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:34] &gt;&gt; But there is a sufficiency in Christ.
[16:36] There there is a power in Christ.
[16:38] There's a THERE'S THIS TOTALITY OF
[16:40] EVERYTHING IN HIM.
[16:42] &gt;&gt; And it may seem to be somewhat poetic.
[16:44] Or you might begin to think, well,
[16:45] that's that's just when WE SAY, OH, THAT
[16:47] means everything to me. and someone buys
[16:50] you a gift or says, "You know, you look
[16:52] nice today." They said, "That means
[16:53] everything to me." We don't walk away
[16:55] going everything. We we understand what
[16:59] they're trying to mean. BUT HERE, THIS
[17:01] THIS is everything.
[17:06] &gt;&gt; That I believe that's the point of some
[17:07] of these scriptures where it says that
[17:09] all things consist by him, that he might
[17:13] have the primitance in all things.
[17:16] Without me, he says, you are nothing.
[17:20] &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 8:6, but to us there is
[17:23] but one God, the Father, of whom are all
[17:26] things, and we in him, and one Lord
[17:30] Jesus Christ, by whom are all things,
[17:32] and we by him.
[17:35] It's identifying a a reality
[17:39] of faith, an existence that is of God.
[17:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. and and and these other things,
[17:45] whether it be in heaven or earth,
[17:46] there's this zeroing in on this
[17:48] subjection to the Almighty.
[17:50] Ephesians chapter 4:10, he that
[17:53] descended is the same also that ascended
[17:54] up far above all heavens, that he might
[17:57] fill all things.
[18:00] &gt;&gt; That in all things he might have the
[18:01] preeminence, that God may be all in all.
[18:05] That he might fill all things. Christ is
[18:09] to have preeminence in his church and
[18:12] he's to have preeminence in the
[18:13] Christian.
[18:15] &gt;&gt; It would be nice if we could find the
[18:17] perfect church and having found it where
[18:18] Christ has the preeminence we could
[18:20] become a part of it and therefore we
[18:22] could say Christ has preeminence in the
[18:23] church but he only has preeminence in
[18:25] the church to the extent that he has
[18:26] place in the individual's life.
[18:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:29] &gt;&gt; That as he has preeminence in the
[18:30] individual is he has preeminence in the
[18:32] Christian. That's how his he begins to
[18:34] have preeminence in the entire body.
[18:36] Amen.
[18:37] &gt;&gt; Then there's no one singular church.
[18:40] Arizona Believers Church. You could even
[18:42] say it this way. We cleverly cleverly
[18:45] named the name Arizona Believers Church,
[18:47] acknowledging that there's going to be
[18:48] three kinds of believers.
[18:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:51] &gt;&gt; Every church has three kinds of
[18:52] believers.
[18:53] &gt;&gt; You have believers. You have make
[18:55] believers. You have unbelievers.
[18:57] &gt;&gt; But in the body of Christ, THERE IS ONLY
[18:59] ONE, the believer.
[19:02] &gt;&gt; That's that that that's the body. That's
[19:04] the church.
[19:06] and Christ having preeminence. This is
[19:09] this is an end time. As brother Random
[19:10] preaches, Christ is the mystery of God
[19:12] revealed. That three-fold purpose of
[19:14] Christ that um that there would be a
[19:17] revealing of God the father, God
[19:19] revealed in his son, the fullness of God
[19:21] revealed TO HIS SON AND TO have
[19:23] preeminence in his church.
[19:26] &gt;&gt; He wants to have preeminence. CHRIST
[19:28] WANTS TO BE THE PREEMINENT ONE. And this
[19:30] is especially relevant in when you look
[19:32] in Revelations chapter 3 when Christ HAS
[19:35] BEEN KICKED OUT of the church.
[19:38] &gt;&gt; He he he's not even uh they have their
[19:41] names. They have the name Christian.
[19:44] &gt;&gt; And that's where Isaiah says that seven
[19:46] women will take a hold of one man and
[19:47] say, "Let us eat our own bread, wear our
[19:49] own clothes, do our own thing, but let
[19:50] us be named after you."
[19:52] &gt;&gt; We want to be called Christians, BUT WE
[19:54] DON'T WANT TO BE SUBJECT TO A HUSBAND.
[19:56] WE DON'T WANT TO BE SUBJECT to Christ
[19:57] the word. Amen.
[19:59] &gt;&gt; So Christ IS KICKED OUT OF THE CHURCH.
[20:00] SO IT'S EVEN MORE important that we
[20:03] recognize that's the heir is to not give
[20:05] him his due not give him the first place
[20:08] and that he fulfill that he fill all in
[20:11] all that Christ would have preeminence.
[20:14] I believe the work of Christ in the
[20:15] believer is to change all things
[20:19] &gt;&gt; or change everything. If that's the
[20:21] phrase that resonates with you, it's the
[20:23] process of transforming everything.
[20:27] I think the life of a Christian as it
[20:29] continues the the spirit uh does its
[20:32] work in one's heart year after year
[20:34] after year it it's a continual growing
[20:37] &gt;&gt; in Christ
[20:39] &gt;&gt; should be
[20:41] in 2 Corinthians 5 161 17 and 18
[20:45] wherefore henceforth know we no man
[20:49] after the flesh yeah though we have
[20:50] known Christ after the flesh yet now
[20:53] henceforth know we him no more therefore
[20:57] If any man be in Christ, he is a new
[21:00] creature, a new creation,
[21:02] &gt;&gt; born again by the Holy Ghost, born again
[21:04] by that uh that incorruptible seed. Old
[21:08] things are passed away.
[21:11] &gt;&gt; So the old things are have lost some
[21:14] there's something been lost and they're
[21:16] passed away. Behold, all things are
[21:18] become new. Amen.
[21:22] &gt;&gt; I would
[21:24] it's not wouldn't be hard to guess that
[21:26] many of you have thought about, well,
[21:28] what does even mean all things became
[21:29] new? I know that I've received the Holy
[21:32] Spirit. I know my life is different. I'm
[21:34] walking in the the the newness of life
[21:36] and and the Holy Spirit is in my heart.
[21:38] But what does it mean? All things are
[21:40] become new. And you're saying, "Well,
[21:42] then answer the question. Just think
[21:43] about it. The Bible says all things are
[21:46] become new. And all things are of God,
[21:48] who hath reconciled us to himself by
[21:50] Jesus Christ, and hath given us the
[21:51] ministry of reconciliation, because
[21:54] Christ IS TO RECONCILE ALL THINGS.
[21:58] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN YOU ARE BORN AGAIN, when you
[22:00] receive this Holy Ghost, in Christ, all
[22:02] things become new.
[22:06] &gt;&gt; It's as if there was in the old things
[22:10] there was meaning, there was life, there
[22:12] was value, there was there was a system.
[22:15] And then whenever you became a new
[22:16] creature, this completely changes.
[22:20] &gt;&gt; Maybe some of the the the same ideas and
[22:22] elements and terminologies and obviously
[22:23] the same oxygen you're breathing and you
[22:25] still live in the same city and there
[22:27] may be a lot of things that are still
[22:28] the same, but it's as if everything's
[22:30] been completely changed.
[22:34] &gt;&gt; This is the work of Christ and the
[22:35] believer to change all things.
[22:38] &gt;&gt; Notice this dimension to it. Philippians
[22:40] 4 12-13.
[22:43] I know both how to be abased
[22:46] and I know how to abound. I I want to
[22:49] get into the knowing how to abound part.
[22:52] I think I'm getting that abase down
[22:54] perfect.
[22:56] Everywhere and in all things I am
[22:58] instructed to both be full and to be
[23:00] hungry. Both to abound and to suffer
[23:01] need. There's Paul really showing you
[23:04] just uh what it means to have all
[23:07] things. Be full and hungry. Abound and
[23:08] to suffer need. All things. And then he
[23:11] says in verse 13,"I can do all things
[23:14] through Christ which strengthenth me."
[23:17] &gt;&gt; This is the potential of Christ. I can
[23:19] do all things through Christ which
[23:21] strengthenth me.
[23:23] &gt;&gt; I I I I had some of the scriptures in
[23:25] here to use. Maybe we'll and we took
[23:27] them out of our notes to possibly push
[23:29] to Wednesday night. But it says with
[23:31] with man this is impossible. With God
[23:34] &gt;&gt; all things
[23:36] that it opens up a whole another realm.
[23:40] all things common. And then we FIND IT'S
[23:43] THROUGH CHRIST THAT WE CAN DO ALL
[23:44] THINGS. It's through Christ that all
[23:46] things become new and all things are of
[23:49] God. I love how he says, "I can do all
[23:52] things through Christ which strengthenth
[23:53] me." And many times we use that whenever
[23:55] we're facing something uh that we want
[23:57] to be able to accomplish for great
[23:58] means. And he's basically saying, "I
[24:00] know how to be abased. I know how to be
[24:02] hungry. I know how to suffer need
[24:04] BECAUSE IN CHRIST I CAN DO ALL THINGS.
[24:06] &gt;&gt; I can suffer need. I can be hungry. I
[24:09] can be a based
[24:11] &gt;&gt; but then I also know how to be full to
[24:13] abound
[24:16] because I can do all things through
[24:17] Christ which strengthen me.
[24:20] &gt;&gt; Romans chapter 8 vers 28 we know that
[24:23] all things work together for good to
[24:26] them that love God to them who are the
[24:28] called according to his purpose.
[24:31] &gt;&gt; And so we CAN'T JUST SAY ALL THINGS WORK
[24:33] TOGETHER FOR GOOD. We have to say for
[24:35] them that love God and are called
[24:38] according to his purpose all things work
[24:40] together for good.
[24:42] &gt;&gt; So he's qualified it already within the
[24:44] verse itself. To them that love God and
[24:46] are called according to his purpose.
[24:48] Whatever transpires, whatever is
[24:50] working, God will ultimately resolve it.
[24:53] He'll bring it to good. It says all
[24:55] things work together for good.
[24:59] We know that implies then that not
[25:00] everything is good.
[25:03] &gt;&gt; But that God works all things together.
[25:10] &gt;&gt; All things common.
[25:12] I'm hoping that we can just again and it
[25:15] may seem to be somewhat semantic just
[25:17] using the phrase all thing, but instead
[25:19] of just saying, well, we need to share.
[25:21] We need to learn how to share and and we
[25:23] need learn to get along and we're going
[25:25] to start a ride share program in the
[25:26] church. Not everyone should be able to
[25:27] drive all these late model cars and and
[25:30] and have, you know, less than 2,000
[25:32] miles on a vehicle. Everyone should be
[25:33] able to enjoy that and experience that.
[25:35] So, we're going to share vehicles. We're
[25:36] going to share we're going to
[25:37] everybody's just going to share things.
[25:38] Do a home share thing, right? You know,
[25:41] that like you can live in our house,
[25:43] we'll live in yours. We just we're all
[25:44] every all things common. Well, there
[25:46] there's a way that people come up with
[25:48] not so much the extremes in that way,
[25:49] but they're trying to use program or
[25:51] process to achieve community, and it
[25:54] doesn't work that way.
[25:56] Now, you can achieve a community. I
[25:59] mean, you just have to become a certain
[26:00] age. You could become part of the Sun
[26:01] City community, right? And there's
[26:04] rules. There's graduation. There's ways
[26:05] that YOU BECOME A PART OF SOMETHING. BUT
[26:08] THIS ONE IS NOT PROGRAMMED. This is not
[26:09] process. This is God's mind. THIS IS
[26:12] GOD'S PROGRAM. This is something very
[26:14] supernatural. So, these things that ARE
[26:17] RELATE TO GOD. WE CAN'T JUST TRY TO BE A
[26:19] FAMILY BECAUSE WE'RE RELATED. THOSE ARE
[26:20] THE WORST kinds of family. [laughter]
[26:23] Hey,
[26:25] for some
[26:28] or there's things that we'll do, I think
[26:29] we're fellowshipping on this, brother
[26:30] Anthony. There's things we'll do in the
[26:32] name of family, in the name of
[26:33] Christianity that um are inexcusable in
[26:36] the name of Christ.
[26:39] &gt;&gt; And so, there has to be something more
[26:41] at the core, at the heart.
[26:43] Can't do it by government. That would be
[26:46] communism.
[26:49] &gt;&gt; You can't do it by force.
[26:53] all things common in Acts.
[26:56] It was the impact that the word was
[26:57] having on their hearts.
[27:00] &gt;&gt; It's the word that was doing it.
[27:03] &gt;&gt; Peter's sermon on the day of Pentecost
[27:05] was, "Men and brethren, what what must
[27:07] we do?" Well, sell all you have,
[27:10] &gt;&gt; give to the poor.
[27:12] It's not what he said to do.
[27:15] When Jesus even said that to the rich
[27:17] young ruler, he knew he was ident. He
[27:20] had a question. what must I do? And he's
[27:22] saying, if any man will come after me,
[27:25] if any man's going to follow me, if you
[27:27] want to follow me, he had to love Christ
[27:30] more
[27:32] &gt;&gt; than what he had.
[27:34] &gt;&gt; And so when the believers were parting
[27:36] with their their possessions and selling
[27:38] these things, it was very contextual to
[27:40] that that church at Jerusalem. But it's
[27:42] the impact of the word in Acts chapter
[27:44] 6:7.
[27:46] Did you catch that, guys? Acts 6:7.
[27:52] trying to ingratiate myself to the the
[27:54] youth.
[27:57] Remember that when you hit like and
[27:58] subscribe
[28:02] AND THE WORD OF God increased and the
[28:04] number of disciples multiplied in
[28:06] Jerusalem greatly and great company of
[28:08] the priests were obedient to the faith.
[28:11] Was this by legislation? Was this by
[28:13] law? Was this by popularity? Was this by
[28:15] using uh buzzwords for the current
[28:19] generation? No, the word of God
[28:21] increased.
[28:23] &gt;&gt; And as the word of God increased, the
[28:25] number of disciples multiplied greatly.
[28:28] And even amongst the priesthood, THEY
[28:29] WERE OBEDIENT TO THE FAITH BECAUSE THE
[28:31] WORD OF GOD INCREASED.
[28:34] &gt;&gt; THIS WASN'T a a this wasn't a change of
[28:36] community and that the priests are like,
[28:37] "Man, I'm tired of this country club. I
[28:39] hear there's a really nice one now over
[28:40] here and they've got better rules and
[28:42] better food and so I'm going to change
[28:45] groups." This was because the word of
[28:47] God was increasing. Acts 12:4, but the
[28:51] word of God grew and multiplied. IT
[28:52] BECAME GREATER and increased. This was
[28:54] true. As the word grew IN THE
[28:56] INDIVIDUAL'S LIVES, SO THAT IT GREW
[28:58] CORPORATELY in the body of Christ. The
[29:00] word of God grew and multiplied.
[29:04] &gt;&gt; Acts chapter 19 20. So mightily grew the
[29:07] word of God and prevailed.
[29:10] Mightily grew. This is in strength.
[29:14] And prevailed.
[29:16] As the word of God grew,
[29:19] there was it prevailed. This is power to
[29:21] overcome.
[29:25] &gt;&gt; We can we would never want to accomplish
[29:28] something by force or by privilege or by
[29:32] opportunity.
[29:34] That that's not how we want to
[29:36] accomplish things as Christians. We do
[29:37] it by faith in the word of God,
[29:39] &gt;&gt; by the word. And and it's the testimony.
[29:42] There's a there's a power of God that we
[29:44] tap into through the word of God that
[29:46] we're not trying to achieve through some
[29:48] other means.
[29:49] &gt;&gt; The word of God grew and prevailed.
[29:53] &gt;&gt; You want to have more of Christ? Welcome
[29:54] to receive his word.
[29:57] &gt;&gt; In Ephesians chapter 4:1 15,
[30:01] but speaking the truth in love
[30:05] may grow up into him in all things,
[30:07] which is the head, even Christ. Christ
[30:11] is all things.
[30:13] &gt;&gt; How is it accomplished? By speaking the
[30:15] truth in love.
[30:17] &gt;&gt; By speaking the truth in love. By the
[30:19] word of God, we may grow up into him in
[30:22] all things. We may grow up into Christ
[30:25] the whole everything. This scripture
[30:26] says everything is Christ.
[30:29] &gt;&gt; All things is Christ. The purpose of the
[30:30] word being preached, speaking the truth
[30:32] and love. I WOULD GROW UP INTO HIM IN
[30:34] ALL THINGS. If you wanted to use A
[30:36] DIFFERENT TERMINOLOGY, HE COULD GROW AND
[30:38] increase in you to be everything to be
[30:40] the all in all.
[30:42] &gt;&gt; So these things are happening because
[30:44] the word of God is growing.
[30:47] &gt;&gt; The word of God is increasing.
[30:50] &gt;&gt; The word of God is like a seed.
[30:53] A
[30:53] &gt;&gt; and Jesus using the parable of the sewer
[30:55] describes the word of God being sown and
[30:57] increasing to a hundfold. That's the
[30:59] work of God in your life.
[31:03] In reality, the word of God is complete.
[31:04] It is full. It is perfect. Nothing needs
[31:06] to be added to it. There's nothing wrong
[31:08] with the word. But the process of the
[31:10] word in an individual's life is that
[31:12] process of the seed being watered and
[31:15] that life having preeminence. And as
[31:17] that life begins to grow inside of you,
[31:19] it pushes things out.
[31:21] &gt;&gt; It's when we get a little bit stagnant
[31:23] in our experience with God that there
[31:24] there's these little areas where things
[31:26] can kind of creep back in. Right?
[31:29] &gt;&gt; May we get a little bit uh cold and
[31:31] indifferent,
[31:33] but the more the word has preeminence,
[31:35] the less power earthly things have over
[31:38] a person.
[31:40] &gt;&gt; I'm wanting this to be uh joined with
[31:43] our understanding of what the believers
[31:45] did in the early church. This wasn't,
[31:47] and I I know I'm maybe just falling back
[31:49] on this phrase. There wasn't a
[31:54] uh well, maybe I'll just read it in Acts
[31:56] chapter 5. I I wasn't going to read
[31:58] this, but let's just let's just read
[32:00] through this and um
[32:03] just as a a as a a word of warning.
[32:06] How's that? Ananas and Safh
[32:09] or just for context that this is
[32:11] something this was something very real.
[32:14] You say, well, it wasn't like, well, you
[32:16] know, if you don't want to sell this,
[32:17] you want to sell that. But there was
[32:18] something that once they begin to
[32:19] operate within it, it was beyond
[32:21] themselves. It was beyond governments.
[32:22] It was beyond personalities and
[32:25] politics. This wasn't being legislated
[32:27] by the disciples.
[32:29] This wasn't uh a democratic socialism.
[32:34] Says, "But a certain" and if you were to
[32:36] read the verses before it, having land
[32:38] sold it and brought the money and laid
[32:39] it at the apostles feet. And it says
[32:42] this in verse 34 of chapter 4, uh none
[32:44] of them lacked for they were possess
[32:46] those that were possessors of lands or
[32:48] houses sold them and brought the price
[32:49] of things that were sold and laid them
[32:51] at the apostles feet. And distribution
[32:53] was made unto every man according to as
[32:55] he had need. This is what's happening
[32:56] within the church, this distribution of
[32:59] possessions. And then chapter 5 begins
[33:01] with but a certain man named Ananas with
[33:03] with Safhara his wife sold a possession.
[33:06] So they chose to operate with the body
[33:10] that that this is maybe what they
[33:12] represented. This is what they're
[33:14] saying. We've sold and kept back part of
[33:16] the price. His wife also being privy to
[33:18] it and brought a certain part and laid
[33:20] it at the apostles feet. These things
[33:23] are very
[33:25] uh it's very interesting story in the
[33:27] early church if I could just put it that
[33:28] way. And I I know that's certainly
[33:30] understating it. But Peter said, Ananas,
[33:33] why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie
[33:36] to the Holy Ghost and to keep back part
[33:38] of the price of the land? How is it he's
[33:41] lying to the Holy Ghost? Just ponder
[33:44] this dynamic that as the believers were
[33:46] selling things and taking the price and
[33:49] dist and putting at the apostles feet to
[33:50] be distributed. They participate, they
[33:53] sell, BUT THEY KEEP BACK PART OF THE
[33:55] PRICE. AND SO BY TESTIMONY OR BY
[33:58] CONFESSION OR BY ACTION, THEY'RE
[34:00] IMPLYING THAT WE'RE DOING WHAT EVERYONE
[34:02] else was doing. [clears throat] And to
[34:04] hold back wasn't lying to Peter. It
[34:06] wasn't a lying to the rest of the
[34:07] apostles. IT'S LYING TO GOD.
[34:09] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[34:11] While it remained, was it not thine own?
[34:15] These are very good questions. I, as I
[34:17] was looking into these, and I had uh
[34:19] thought to perhaps address these things
[34:21] on Wednesday or next Sunday, while it
[34:22] remained, was it not thy own? And after
[34:25] it was sold, was it not in thy own
[34:27] power?
[34:30] It's this was yours to begin with.
[34:33] &gt;&gt; You have control OVER IT. WHY HAST thou
[34:36] conceived this thing in thine heart?
[34:39] Thou hast not light UNTO MEN, BUT UNTO
[34:41] GOD.
[34:42] &gt;&gt; Something dishonest that they did in
[34:44] their hearts. Something they thought
[34:46] that they could they did. WERE THEY
[34:47] RECOGNIZING THE GRAVITY OF IT? Were they
[34:50] just caught up? This this may is is not
[34:53] meant to uh put FEAR ON ANY ONE of us,
[34:56] but did they just see everyone else
[34:57] worshiping and everyone else going to
[34:59] church and and they're like, "Well,
[35:01] let's just do our part so we can look
[35:02] like we're part of IT
[35:04] AND LET'S SELL THIS." and well, I don't
[35:06] know if I'm absolutely convinced of
[35:08] this. And well, let's we want everyone
[35:10] to think we're going along with this.
[35:11] So, they give a LITTLE BIT. AND IT JUST
[35:12] SHOWS THAT THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT NOT
[35:14] UH GIVING your all. There's something
[35:16] ABOUT HOLDING IT BACK THAT YOU YOU MAY
[35:18] FOOL EVERYBODY ELSE, BUT YOU'RE NOT
[35:20] GOING to fool God.
[35:21] &gt;&gt; And the consequence of LYING TO GOD IS
[35:23] DEATH.
[35:25] &gt;&gt; You know, well, THE CONSEQUENCE OF NOT
[35:27] NOT PRETENDING TO BE LIKE EVERYONE ELSE
[35:29] AND GOING ALONG WITH THE FLOW IS THAT I
[35:30] WOULD BE REJECTED OR I WOULDN'T FEEL A
[35:32] PART OF IT. LISTEN, DON'T LET THE FEAR
[35:34] OF MISSING OUT CAUSE YOU TO PRETEND TO
[35:37] be a Christian.
[35:40] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't want to displease God.
[35:45] &gt;&gt; Thou hast not lied unto men, but unto
[35:46] God. And Ananas, hearing these words,
[35:48] fell down, and gave up the ghost. And
[35:50] great fear came on all them that heard
[35:51] these things. And the young men arose,
[35:54] wound him up, and carried him out, and
[35:55] buried him. And it was the space of
[35:57] three hours after when his wife, not
[35:58] knowing what was done, came in. Peter
[36:01] answered unto her, "Tell me whether ye
[36:02] sold the land for so much." And she
[36:04] said, "Yay, for so much. Why the
[36:06] dishonesty?
[36:08] Why the lying?" Then Peter said unto
[36:11] her, "How is it that ye have agreed
[36:12] together to tempt the spirit of the
[36:14] Lord? Behold, the feet of them which
[36:16] buried thy husband are at the door, and
[36:18] shall carry thee out." Then she fell
[36:20] down straightway at his feet, and
[36:22] yielded up the ghost. And the young men
[36:23] came in, found her dead, and carried her
[36:26] forth, buried her by her husband. And
[36:29] great fear came upon all the church and
[36:30] upon as many as heard these things and
[36:33] every single one of us said yeah.
[36:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:40] &gt;&gt; This is in the establishment of the
[36:41] church. Then it begins to say that many
[36:43] signs and wonders were done by the
[36:45] apostles and by the church
[36:48] and the and the public in the face of
[36:50] the people at Solomon's porch.
[36:52] But here's this dynamic operating within
[36:56] the church where people be led of the
[36:57] Lord are giving a and they're
[37:00] supporting.
[37:03] But it wasn't
[37:05] it wasn't done at the fear, you know,
[37:08] the threat of punishment.
[37:12] But as the word had premised, the love
[37:13] of the love of these other things
[37:16] diminished.
[37:18] And the love the love of property and
[37:20] possessions is one of the strongest
[37:23] powers in the human psychology. It's a
[37:26] very very powerful motivator. They've
[37:28] studied it from a number of different d
[37:29] uh directions just to figure it out that
[37:31] there's something about physical
[37:32] possession. They say possession is
[37:35] nine10enth of the law. It's 11 1110 of
[37:38] our our mindset that when you have
[37:40] something there's this pride of
[37:41] ownership.
[37:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[37:42] &gt;&gt; We tend to get place higher value on
[37:45] things that we own.
[37:46] &gt;&gt; Right. And so the love of property and
[37:48] possessions is is a strong power
[37:51] motivates us. Yet somehow as the word
[37:54] begin to have preeminence, possessions
[37:56] begin to lose their power.
[37:59] In Philippians chapter 2 20- 21,
[38:03] Paul says, "For I have no man likeminded
[38:06] who will naturally care for your state."
[38:10] I have no man like-minded who will
[38:12] naturally care for your state. What a
[38:14] what a statement.
[38:16] For all seek their own,
[38:19] not the things which are Christ's.
[38:23] &gt;&gt; This is he said, I have a different kind
[38:25] of mindset towards these things and I I
[38:27] naturally instinctively I care for your
[38:29] condition. I care what you're going
[38:30] through. But then he says, for all seek
[38:33] their own. I think this forms uh this is
[38:36] at the core of what Paul is using to
[38:37] address the church at Philippi. He's
[38:40] he's using this language say that people
[38:42] tend to be more selfish. They tend to
[38:43] look upon their own needs.
[38:46] They seek their own. They seek their own
[38:48] reputation. They seek their own
[38:49] possessions, their own prestige or
[38:51] popularity and not the things which are
[38:53] Christ.
[38:56] &gt;&gt; To someone their possessions are
[38:58] everything.
[39:00] &gt;&gt; They're they're they're precious to
[39:01] them.
[39:03] But he's saying to me, I that's I think
[39:05] all I have all things common because I
[39:08] value the things which are Christ. I
[39:11] seek the things which are Christ. All
[39:12] things are Christ.
[39:15] So chapter 3:12 he says and and I want
[39:18] to come back to verse one of this
[39:19] chapter in the closing he says now as
[39:20] though I had not as though I'd already
[39:22] attained
[39:24] either were already perfect but I follow
[39:26] after this is a pursuit if that I may
[39:29] apprehend that for which also I am
[39:31] apprehended of Christ Jesus. Brethren I
[39:33] count not myself to have apprehended but
[39:35] this one thing I do forgetting those
[39:37] things which are behind and reaching
[39:38] forth into those things which are
[39:40] before. I press toward the mark for the
[39:43] prize of the high calling of God in
[39:45] Christ Jesus.
[39:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:47] &gt;&gt; Here he here he's saying this is what I
[39:49] I don't have this attitude. Again, we'll
[39:50] we'll drop back to some more of the
[39:52] context for this, but he says I'm I'm
[39:54] pressing forth. I'm reaching forward. I
[39:56] want this prize that of the high call of
[39:58] God in Christ Jesus. And he says in the
[40:02] prior chapter, not every everyone's
[40:04] seeking their own, but I seek the things
[40:06] which are Christs.
[40:09] Let us therefore, as many as be perfect,
[40:11] be thus minded, and if anything in
[40:14] anything ye be otherwise minded,
[40:17] God shall reveal even this unto you.
[40:20] Nevertheless, where until we have
[40:21] already attained, let us walk by the
[40:23] same rule, let us mind the same thing.
[40:28] Brethren, be followers together of me,
[40:29] and mark them which walk so as you have
[40:31] us for an example.
[40:34] For many walk of whom I've told you
[40:35] often and now tell you even weeping that
[40:37] they are enemies of the cross of Christ.
[40:41] Catch this phrase here in verse 19.
[40:42] Whose end is destruction whose God is
[40:45] their belly. Whose glory is their shame
[40:48] who mind earthly things
[40:53] &gt;&gt; that seek their own
[40:56] and their end is destruction. Their god
[40:58] is their own desires. Whose god is their
[40:59] belly. What they want. what they're when
[41:01] they're hungry, when they need to be
[41:03] clothed.
[41:06] &gt;&gt; But he's saying, "Let us mind the same
[41:07] thing. Let us walk by the same rule."
[41:10] And he's he's speaking of reaching
[41:11] forward to those things which are
[41:12] before, pressing toward the mark for the
[41:14] prize of the high calling in God in
[41:15] Christ Jesus. Well, what kind of mind
[41:18] did he did he have?
[41:20] Let this mind be in you which was in
[41:22] Christ Jesus.
[41:24] Let every man not look on his own
[41:26] things, but look on the things of
[41:27] others. You have to recognize this in
[41:28] the context of this greater letter.
[41:30] Maybe go and read the whole the letter
[41:31] to yourselves to see that this is the
[41:33] theme that he's he's tracking. He says,
[41:35] "Let this mind be in you. Walk by the
[41:37] same rule. Let us mind the same thing."
[41:39] That there is this humility to be
[41:42] willing to serve and to give and to be a
[41:44] part of something greater THAN OURSELVES
[41:46] AND NOT ALWAYS TRYING TO PROTECT
[41:47] OURSELVES.
[41:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN. The instincts that we have as
[41:50] human beings have a lot to do with
[41:52] surviving
[41:54] a
[41:54] &gt;&gt; and whether or not we live and whether
[41:56] or not we survive and whether or not we
[41:57] eat and whether or not we're clothed or
[41:58] we're warm when it's cold. And so
[42:00] there's a lot of survival instincts. But
[42:02] when we can let go of THIS SELF-P
[42:03] PROTECTIONISM AND SELF-S SURVIVAL AND
[42:05] REALIZE THAT CHRIST CAN DO FOR me what I
[42:08] am not EVEN ABLE TO DREAM of
[42:10] &gt;&gt; that it's a trusting no longer in self
[42:13] [snorts]
[42:14] &gt;&gt; and trusting in Christ.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. So it's a as he's admonishing them
[42:20] that they I tell you now weeping that
[42:22] there's people who mind earthly things.
[42:24] This is what has the preeminence. Says
[42:27] for our conversation is in heaven from
[42:28] whence also we look for the savior the
[42:30] lord Jesus Christ looking unto Jesus the
[42:32] author and finisher of our faith. We're
[42:34] looking beyond the natural things. We're
[42:36] looking beyond the human things who
[42:37] shall change our vile body that it may
[42:39] be fashioned like unto his glorious body
[42:41] according to the working whereby he is
[42:43] able to even to subdue all things. unto
[42:47] himself.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; There is a rearranging of desire.
[42:52] There's an a a reordering of priorities.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; And this willingness to give is a mark
[43:01] of Christ apprehending possessing uh
[43:04] possessing the heart.
[43:07] Christ has more of me the less of the
[43:09] world I want. Yes,
[43:12] &gt;&gt; this is this is the literal product of
[43:15] Christ having preeminence. The more
[43:17] preeminence he has, the less preeminence
[43:18] the world has.
[43:21] &gt;&gt; What was the phrase that uh one of the
[43:23] great writers of the past said, "How do
[43:24] you keep the tears out of bushels? Pack
[43:26] them full of wheat,
[43:29] &gt;&gt; the more that they could be packed full
[43:30] of the good, there's less room for the
[43:32] bad."
[43:33] &gt;&gt; It it's a reordering of what we value.
[43:37] So again, we could have it's one of the
[43:38] things I don't take uh I don't know if
[43:40] you I just mentioned Dr. James Dobson
[43:43] and I think uh bless his heart I believe
[43:44] he passed away in the last year or so.
[43:46] Uh but there's an ide
[43:52] far just initially but do you realize
[43:54] even that could be wrong
[43:56] &gt;&gt; if the focus is the family and not
[43:58] Christ?
[44:00] &gt;&gt; But as Christ comes in focus the family
[44:02] comes in view. Amen.
[44:05] &gt;&gt; HOW COULD YOU NOT WANT CHRIST FOR YOUR
[44:06] CHILDREN? I HAVE NO GREATER JOY THAN TO
[44:08] SEE MY CHILDREN WALKING IN TRUTH. I I
[44:10] WANT CHRIST TO HAVE PREEMINENCE IN MY
[44:11] HOME. I WANT HIM TO BE WELCOME AT OUR
[44:13] TABLE. AND THERE'S THIS ATTITUDE THAT
[44:15] WHEN CHRIST COMES INTO FOCUS, IT'S NOT
[44:17] THAT when we say these OTHER THINGS COME
[44:19] INTO FOCUS, WE BEGIN TO SEE them in
[44:21] light of Christ.
[44:25] &gt;&gt; Matthew chapter 19 29.
[44:28] I I this is going to be one of those
[44:30] sermons where it's like, man, he read
[44:31] from Acts chapter 5 about Ananas and
[44:34] Safh, then Matthew 19, and then Matthew
[44:36] 10. And those are going to be the only
[44:38] things people remember.
[44:41] And everyone that hath forsaken houses
[44:44] or brethren or sisters or father or
[44:47] mother or wife or children or lands for
[44:50] my name's sake
[44:53] &gt;&gt; shall receive a hundfold and shall
[44:55] inherit everlasting life.
[44:58] If these words seem difficult to
[45:01] receive,
[45:03] he is qualifying it for his sake,
[45:06] &gt;&gt; for Christ's sake.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; If you have forsaken houses, brothers,
[45:12] sisters, father, mother, wife, children,
[45:13] or lands
[45:15] for the sake of Christ, you're going to
[45:18] receive a hundfold.
[45:21] So he says elsewhere in this life and
[45:22] the life to come inherit everlasting
[45:24] life
[45:26] for his sake.
[45:28] &gt;&gt; If he just said any man that forsakes
[45:30] houses uh mother, wife, children or
[45:33] lands shall receive a hundfold. You know
[45:35] that would be a very easy get-rich
[45:37] scheme.
[45:38] Forsaken it all. You say, "Well, no
[45:40] wonder these people have had a hundred
[45:41] wives. They just keep forsaking and they
[45:44] get keep getting more. But it's for my
[45:46] name's sake.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; Jesus is saying this. And if he doesn't
[45:52] TAKE TIME TO EXPLAIN IT, he's at least
[45:53] letting it GET INSIDE YOUR HEAD A LITTLE
[45:55] BIT. LIKE, WHOA, WAIT A MINUTE. WHAT? Is
[45:57] that even an option? Is that would that
[45:59] even be necessary? In chapter 10, he
[46:02] says it this way. Verse 34, "Think not
[46:04] that I come to send peace on earth.
[46:07] Christmas is over.
[46:09] Think not that I come to SEND PEACE ON
[46:10] EARTH. I CAME NOT TO SEND PEACE, but a
[46:12] sword." Yes.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; For I am come to set a man at variance.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; This is disagreement. This is at odds.
[46:22] This is emnity. Set a man at variance
[46:24] against his father and the daughter
[46:26] against her mother and the
[46:27] daughter-in-law against her
[46:28] mother-in-law.
[46:30] And a man's foe shall be they of his own
[46:33] household.
[46:37] And this seems to be him specifically
[46:40] saying, "I've come with a sword and I'm
[46:42] going to cleave. I'm going to separate
[46:43] father from son, daughter from mother.
[46:46] There's going to be a a there's going to
[46:49] be a variance AND DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN
[46:51] DAUGHTER-IN-LAW and mother-in-law.
[46:54] How come it doesn't say anything about
[46:55] son son-in-laws here? [snorts]
[46:58] And the follows are going to be in your
[47:00] own house. So he gives us some color to
[47:02] this in verse 37. He that loveth father
[47:05] or mother more than me is not worthy of
[47:07] me.
[47:09] He that loveth son or daughter more than
[47:11] me is not worthy of me.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; We really need to read this and maybe it
[47:17] it it's maybe it's a phrase that's
[47:19] mentioned so often we're able to kind of
[47:20] put it in a category maybe it just
[47:22] becomes poetry but this is very these
[47:24] are very real words. If you love your
[47:26] children more than you love Christ then
[47:28] you're not worthy of Christ.
[47:30] Now, this would be good. This would be a
[47:32] good bullet point under uh God is a
[47:35] narcissist, right?
[47:38] &gt;&gt; But think of what he's trying to say.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; If these things are worth more,
[47:44] if when IT CAME DOWN TO WHETHER OR NOT
[47:46] YOU WOULD ACCEPT CHRIST OR RECEIVE
[47:48] CHRIST OR FOLLOW CHRIST OR KEEP YOUR
[47:51] FAMILY OR HAVE THIS AND YOU WOULD SAY,
[47:53] "WELL, I'D RATHER be with my wife."
[47:56] He says, "You're not worthy of me. If I
[47:58] could say it this way to help you, you
[48:00] don't understand the value
[48:02] &gt;&gt; of Christ.
[48:05] &gt;&gt; That if you DON'T SEE THE VALUE OF
[48:07] CHRIST, IF YOU HAVE A IF YOU WOULD BE
[48:09] WILLING TO CHOOSE lands or in-laws OR
[48:11] FAMILY AND ALL THESE OTHER THINGS OVER
[48:13] CHRIST, WE SAYS, "YOU'RE NOT WORTHY OF
[48:15] ME." HE'S NOT SAYING IT IN THIS
[48:17] NARCISSISTIC WAY. WE'RE LIKE, "OH my
[48:19] goodness, that's just distasteful."
[48:20] SAYS, "YOU CLEARLY DON'T UNDERSTAND THE
[48:22] VALUE of Christ
[48:25] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IN CHRIST IS YOUR FAMILY. IN
[48:28] CHRIST ARE LANDS AND POSSESSIONS.
[48:30] THROUGH CHRIST, DO YOU REALIZE THAT AN
[48:32] UNBELIEVING SPOUSE IS REDEEMED THROUGH
[48:35] THE SPOUSE THAT VALUES CHRIST
[48:39] &gt;&gt; THAT I COULD DO ALL THINGS THROUGH
[48:40] CHRIST? THAT IN CHRIST IS ALL THINGS.
[48:42] THAT I SEE CHRIST AS THE WAY OF HAVING
[48:44] MY FAMILY. I SEE CHRIST AS THE WAY OF
[48:46] TRULY ENJOYING LANDS and possessions."
[48:49] Amen.
[48:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; He that would love these other things
[48:53] more than Christ clearly doesn't know
[48:55] the value of Christ.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham goes to great
[48:59] lengths and different ways to say this,
[49:00] but that's what science and religion is
[49:02] trying to do today is to cut away at the
[49:04] value of the word.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; And use all sorts of uh uh and and the
[49:09] dishonest in doing it too.
[49:13] &gt;&gt; In Luke 14 26, it says it this way. If
[49:16] any man come to me and hate not his
[49:19] father and mother and wife and children
[49:24] and brother and sisters and some of you
[49:26] are going yes YES YES
[49:29] AND HIS OWN life and some might say okay
[49:32] all right good I'm good there me hate me
[49:36] and his own life also he cannot be my
[49:38] disciple
[49:40] &gt;&gt; and the language seems to be very very
[49:43] uh difficult and heavy IF YOU'RE GOING
[49:45] TO FOLLOW ME AS HE TOLD THE PREACHING
[49:46] LORD, FOLLOW ME. SELL WHAT YOU HAVE.
[49:47] GIVE TO THE POOR. COME FOLLOW ME. TAKE
[49:49] UP YOUR CROSS AND FOLLOW ME. IF ANY
[49:50] MAN'S GOING TO COME TO ME. IF HE'S GOING
[49:53] TO ENJOY UH IF HE'S GOING TO BE SEEN OF
[49:56] me and live in me and I IN HIM, HE HAS
[49:58] TO HATE HIS FATHER,
[50:01] MOTHER, WIFE, CHILDREN, BROTHERS,
[50:02] SISTERS, and his own life.
[50:05] Because if any man will follow me and be
[50:08] my disciple,
[50:10] Christ has to be everything.
[50:14] The hate there is not to create animus
[50:17] towards other people but it's to order
[50:20] your love that my love is for the word
[50:23] &gt;&gt; that's where my that's what my love is
[50:25] for that's where my loyalty is too
[50:28] &gt;&gt; and that if when Christ becomes all
[50:30] things then all things become common
[50:34] &gt;&gt; even down to lands and in-laws
[50:38] and children
[50:40] and mother and father and life
[50:44] when the word is valued above everything
[50:47] everything becomes common
[50:50] what what is what is worth the Bible
[50:53] even goes so far as to say Jesus said if
[50:55] any man who wants to save his life and
[50:57] keep his life and protect his life
[50:58] you're going to lose it
[51:00] &gt;&gt; sir
[51:03] &gt;&gt; Philippians chapter 3:es 1 to1 11 we
[51:06] took the scripture where he said that
[51:07] they mind earthly things
[51:12] we read in chapter 2 where he says they
[51:13] seek their own and not the things that
[51:15] are Christ. We read in chapter four
[51:16] where he says I can do all things
[51:18] through Christ. Read from other places
[51:20] in Philippians earlier. There's there
[51:23] there's a lot that he's expressing here.
[51:25] Let this mind be in you which was in
[51:26] Christ Jesus.
[51:29] So he's kind of I know we're taking this
[51:31] a little bit out of order but I thought
[51:32] it would just maybe resonate differently
[51:34] this morning this way. Finally, my
[51:36] brethren,
[51:38] rejoice in the Lord.
[51:40] To write the same things to you, to me
[51:42] indeed is not grievious, but for you it
[51:44] is safe.
[51:46] Beware of dogs.
[51:48] Beware of evil workers. Beware of the
[51:51] concision.
[51:54] This is this is where safety is.
[51:56] For we are the circumcision,
[51:59] which worship God in the spirit and
[52:01] rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no
[52:03] confidence in the flesh.
[52:07] though I might also have confidence in
[52:10] the flesh. If any other man thinkketh
[52:12] that he hath whereof he might trust in
[52:15] the flesh, I more. I just love how Paul
[52:17] is.
[52:19] He's how he says, "Well, everyone else
[52:21] seeks their own, but not me.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; I actually care for you. And if an angel
[52:25] from heaven came and preached to you
[52:27] something other than what I'm preaching,
[52:28] let that angel from heaven be cursed."
[52:32] &gt;&gt; This is the This is the prophet Paul.
[52:34] This is the Apostle Paul. This is why
[52:36] some believe that Paul was the
[52:37] antichrist that hijacked Christianity.
[52:39] But this is the word of God to us. And
[52:41] he shows that in his flesh he had a lot
[52:43] to brag about.
[52:46] Circumcised the eighth day of the stock
[52:49] of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a
[52:51] Hebrew of the Hebrews, touching the law,
[52:52] Pharisee, concerning zeal, persecuting
[52:54] the church, touching the righteousness
[52:56] which is in the law, blameless.
[52:59] Quite the resume.
[53:01] Quite the outward works, the adherence
[53:04] to rules and regulations as a Pharisee,
[53:06] a zealot. The law kept it. Pharisee of
[53:10] the Pharisees, a Hebrew of the Hebrews,
[53:13] of the stock of Israel, circumcised on
[53:15] the eighth day. I've got all these
[53:16] things are all lined up. THIS MAKES ME
[53:18] PART OF THE CLUB. But he says in verse
[53:19] 7, "But what things were gained to me?
[53:22] Those I counted loss for Christ."
[53:27] HIS ENTIRE IDENTITY. He was willing to
[53:29] lose it and allow it to be stripped away
[53:31] not just for anything but for Christ.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; So he says, "Yay doubtless AND I COUNT
[53:38] ALL THINGS but loss for the excellency
[53:42] of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord
[53:46] for whom I HAVE SUFFERED THE LOSS OF all
[53:49] things and do count them but dung that I
[53:52] may win Christ."
[53:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is this great paradigm shift
[53:58] for Paul. All the things he valued, all
[54:00] the things he pursued, even the things
[54:01] that caused him to persecute the church,
[54:03] HE WAS DOING IT ZEALOUSLY FOR THE LAW,
[54:05] FOR A GOD THAT HE KNEW WAS RIGHT.
[54:08] LISTEN, not that he thought was right,
[54:09] that he knew was right.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; But now in this paradigm shift,
[54:13] everything outward, everything external,
[54:15] EVERYTHING BY THE LAW AND BY THE FLESH,
[54:17] NOW HE REALIZES, I'M WILLING TO COUNT
[54:19] everything loss. In all things he counts
[54:22] as dung. I say quite often we don't need
[54:24] the Greek to understand that
[54:27] &gt;&gt; he counts all things for loss. ALL
[54:29] THINGS I DO COUNT THEM BUT DUNG that I
[54:32] may win everything.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; THAT I MAY HAVE ALL THINGS.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; SO IT'S THIS COMPLETE REVERSAL WHERE AT
[54:40] ONE TIME THE THIS WORLD AND WHAT IT
[54:42] HOLDS IS EVERYTHING TO YOU BUT THEN
[54:45] CHRIST BECOMES EVERYTHING.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; And so you're WILLING TO LOSE ALL THINGS
[54:49] THAT YOU MIGHT GAIN ALL THINGS. CHRIST.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; I've suffered the loss of all things. I
[54:54] count all things that lost that I may
[54:56] win Christ or for the excellency of the
[54:58] knowledge of Christ. Jesus says my Lord.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; He says, "And be found in him, not
[55:03] having my own righteousness which is of
[55:04] the law, but that which is through faith
[55:06] of Christ,
[55:08] the righteousness which is of God by
[55:10] faith." It's it's from this faith that
[55:13] our good works are born. Not by becoming
[55:16] up coming up with a metric
[55:18] of what good works is. We can just do
[55:21] that using chat GPT now, right? And it
[55:24] even gives us bullet points. And if
[55:26] you'd like me to, I will tell you how to
[55:27] perform this tomorrow, right? How about
[55:29] you just do it for me? Is there a way
[55:32] you could just get me out of bed at 5 if
[55:33] that's really the ideal time to get up?
[55:35] And who knows how long it's going to be
[55:37] till they can just implant a chip,
[55:39] right? And it's like we're up at 5 and
[55:41] we're brushing our teeth and we're
[55:42] making our bed and we're doing all these
[55:44] rules to live by.
[55:46] But this is what that would just be a
[55:48] cheap knockoff of what the Holy Spirit's
[55:49] wanting to do in you
[55:51] &gt;&gt; to cause you to will and to do of his
[55:55] good pleasure.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; So righteousness by by faith, not by
[55:58] law. And he says that I may know him and
[56:00] the power of his resurrection and the
[56:02] fellowship of his sufferings, the
[56:03] community of his sufferings being made
[56:05] conformable unto death. if by any means
[56:07] I might attain unto the resurrection of
[56:09] the dead.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; And that's when he says, not as though
[56:12] I've already attained, was already
[56:14] perfect, but I pursue, I seek, I don't
[56:17] mind earthly things. I'm pursuing
[56:19] heavenly things.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; As Christ has apprehended me, and I know
[56:23] that he has fully possessed my soul. I
[56:25] want to apprehend him. I WANT TO KNOW
[56:27] HIM MORE,
[56:29] &gt;&gt; BE FOUND in him,
[56:31] &gt;&gt; not having my own righteousness, BUT I
[56:33] WANT HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS BY FAITH.
[56:36] For the excellency of the knowledge of
[56:38] Christ Jesus, my Lord,
[56:40] all things have passed away, and all
[56:43] things have become new.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; As we invite our musicians to come,
[56:50] this statement has meant a lot to me.
[56:53] I'm sure I'm sure it has to you, many of
[56:55] you.
[56:58] But in reading these scriptures of if
[57:00] any man forsakes these things that are
[57:03] precious for his sake, he'll give them
[57:04] back. You'll receive a hundfold.
[57:08] If any man love these other things more
[57:10] than me, he says, I cannot be my
[57:12] disciple.
[57:15] He that loveth these other things more
[57:16] than me is not worthy of me. It speaks
[57:18] to the value that we place on Christ.
[57:22] in the sermon, the power of
[57:24] transformation,
[57:32] if you could, I have it quoted here, but
[57:35] he says, "Sometimes you have to separate
[57:36] from everything that's dear on earth to
[57:39] you to take your position that God
[57:41] [music] has called you to."
[57:45] &gt;&gt; You have to separate from everything
[57:46] that's dear.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; That doesn't maybe become unfeilling.
[57:51] Would it be easy if we did just
[57:53] instinctively hate everyone else but
[57:55] Christ? And that and that was the work
[57:57] of the Holy Ghost. I hate you. Oh Jesus.
[57:59] Jesus. Precious Jesus. But you separate
[58:03] from things dear to you. You have a
[58:04] love. You have feeling for the people.
[58:07] SO YOU HAVE TO SEPARATE FROM THINGS THAT
[58:09] ARE DEAR TO TAKE your position that God
[58:10] has called you to. And he says, I'm sure
[58:12] you can read between the lines of what
[58:13] I'm saying. Sometimes the very dearest
[58:16] person on earth, you have to shake hands
[58:19] with them and just take your position in
[58:22] Christ to where [music] God has called
[58:23] you.
[58:25] Can be hard sometimes. I'd say it's
[58:28] probably hard every time when you have
[58:29] to separate, make decisions, but you
[58:32] have to do it to take your position
[58:33] [music] in Christ.
[58:36] Notice how it doesn't work uh community
[58:38] is not working externally to where if we
[58:40] could just get all the parameters right
[58:41] and then be adopted into that then we'll
[58:44] have the sense and feeling of it. But
[58:46] sometimes the only way that you could
[58:48] really become a part of something is
[58:49] [music] when inside of you you get you
[58:51] joined to something greater
[58:54] that Christ the word means more to me
[58:57] than it's ever meant before. [music]
[58:58] and and by necessity
[59:01] I have to take to take my stand. I'm
[59:03] going to have to separate from things
[59:05] that are dear to me.
[59:08] He says, "But what is God doing
[59:11] transforming you from what you were?"
[59:15] He says, "MAYBE YOU'RE A SON OR DAUGHTER
[59:16] OR WHATEVER from a ve lovely family." He
[59:19] says he places you somewhere, but it's
[59:22] his way of doing it by the renewing of
[59:24] your mind to obey the word of God
[59:27] regardless of what the price [music] is.
[59:31] In Acts chapter 5, it says they held
[59:33] back some of the price.
[59:36] So, it puts us in view of this.
[59:38] Regardless of what the price is, I'm
[59:41] willing to pay [music] the price
[59:44] to obey the word of God regardless of
[59:46] what it costs. regardless of what
[59:48] happens.
[59:50] So, you may be a son or daughter in a
[59:51] lovely family. You may have be part of
[59:53] something very, very beautiful, but God
[59:55] WANTS TO PLACE YOU SOMEWHERE else
[59:58] to be made the hardest decision you've
[1:00:00] ever made. But it's God's way of [music]
[1:00:02] transforming us.
[1:00:05] If we want all things common, [music]
[1:00:07] then Christ has to be
[1:00:10] everything.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; If we're going to have everything in
[1:00:12] common, if we could use that phrase that
[1:00:14] Christ needs [music] to be everything,
[1:00:17] commonly to us. Let's stand.
[1:00:22] Our gracious heavenly father,
[1:00:25] [snorts]
[1:00:31] you know better than I, Lord, what it is
[1:00:34] you're dealing with in people's hearts.
[1:00:37] And when I look out upon a congregation
[1:00:39] with visitors and maybe newcomers
[1:00:41] [music] and
[1:00:43] different mixture of families and
[1:00:46] identities and
[1:00:49] truly Lord, you know what's in the heart
[1:00:52] of the believer, the listener today.
[1:00:55] And Lord, I'm not pointing to a church.
[1:00:57] I can join my words with brother Brad.
[1:00:59] I'm not for [music] one moment. Is our
[1:01:01] vision or our goal to just start a
[1:01:03] church and gain followers?
[1:01:06] But our desire is to see that a real
[1:01:07] relationship would be established
[1:01:09] between you and the believer
[1:01:12] where they're fed by your [music] word
[1:01:13] and led by your spirit.
[1:01:17] And Lord, it can be difficult.
[1:01:21] I say it can be often it is and most
[1:01:23] likely very difficult to follow your
[1:01:25] will because it's contrary to the flesh.
[1:01:29] Sometimes we have to separate from
[1:01:31] things that are very dear to us. It may
[1:01:32] not be a family member. It could be a
[1:01:34] job. It could be a a possession. It
[1:01:36] could be things that we enjoy. But you
[1:01:38] call us to do it, to take our [music]
[1:01:39] stand.
[1:01:42] And Lord, I I believe
[1:01:45] that instead of just looking at [music]
[1:01:48] those things we're asked to give up,
[1:01:51] we just need to look at what we stand
[1:01:53] [music] to gain
[1:01:56] that I may win Christ.
[1:01:59] The excellency of the knowledge of
[1:02:00] Christ.
[1:02:02] When we get so hyperfocused on, I'm
[1:02:04] going to lose this. I'm going to lose
[1:02:05] that, I'm going to lose this, I'm going
[1:02:05] to lose that. Then we haven't truly
[1:02:07] considered what we stand to gain
[1:02:11] and then we lose the fear of what we'll
[1:02:13] miss out on and actually gain the faith
[1:02:18] of what is ours. [music]
[1:02:20] To believe for restoration and family.
[1:02:22] To believe that you'll provide all our
[1:02:24] needs. that you will be a father to
[1:02:27] [music] the fatherless,
[1:02:29] a husband to the widow. That we have
[1:02:31] nothing to fear in you. I can do all
[1:02:34] things through Christ. That our
[1:02:36] sufficiency is in Christ.
[1:02:39] For your grace is sufficient for us.
[1:02:42] Lord, bless the people today as there's
[1:02:44] things that we wrestle out here in the
[1:02:46] new year. Lord, we passed quitter
[1:02:48] [music] Saturday.
[1:02:51] By the second Saturday of the year,
[1:02:53] resolutions are broken and they've most
[1:02:55] people have quit and given up. But Lord,
[1:02:58] I'm not giving up on your promises. I
[1:03:00] want to sell out to them more than I
[1:03:01] ever have before. I want to believe your
[1:03:02] word with everything that that's in me.
[1:03:06] And Lord, may we fall in love with your
[1:03:08] word.
[1:03:09] May it have a greater [music] impact in
[1:03:12] our lives than it ever has before.
[1:03:15] Commit ourselves to you now, Lord, in
[1:03:17] the name of [music] Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:03:19] Amen.
