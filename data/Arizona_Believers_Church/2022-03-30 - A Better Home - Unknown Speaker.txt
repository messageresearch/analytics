TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and just sensing um just for myself personally and recognizing being able to have our own place kind of a culmination of well over a year of prayers and searching and and efforts many efforts being made to be here i kind of i sense that it would be a good idea maybe not just to jump into part four of a series or continue on something that we'd be ministered on already but to address maybe a subject uh that speaks to the specialness of tonight the opportunity that we have tonight and so my title is a better home and this is applicable on a number of different levels and you'll kind of see where i'm going and how that's applicable as we go forward but i want you to think about this a better home and here at the outset i'd like to just express it this way that this is home as a church for now this is an opportunity that god has given us to gather together it's um some facilities that we can call our own that we can take pride in um a wonderful opportunity for those who every service have been showing up two hours early and maybe staying at least an hour late uh making sure everything is taken care of um there's a definite change and shift for many different people but i wanted just to speak to that as we're gathering here for the first time i just wanted to speak to uh the fact that this is uh this especially this part right here there's other parts to this facility there's other places where we'll have whether it be office space or sunday school rooms or even a fellowship hall there's a lot of different places to this facility but to where we're gathered right now i wanted to give some context uh to how we view this and how special it is to us uh we often have this prayer in our hearts from the very first time that we ever held a service here at arizona believers church it was held on july 26 um 2020 at the hilton garden inn uh we didn't have any control over who had been in there the night before even who had been in there that morning but we knew one thing our god was greater than whatever it was and so we always relied upon his presence to sanctify the atmosphere to drive out any spirits and and we often wrestle even with just atmospheres that could be just outside those walls and those doors but now we have a place that we can call our own and that we can begin to reverence and respect and i believe it can just even heightened heighten the atmosphere the presence that we feel and in the message be not afraid it is i brother branham makes this statement uh and i think i provided these four there might be some other scriptures there in the way at the beginning i'm not sure but it's one of the first quotes in there but braham says because i believe uh and he refers to the masons in a masonic lodge and then he says i believe that the masons are all right but the mason lodge will never take the place of the church or the blood of jesus christ he says all my people are masons and they're all right as a lodge but it won't take the place of the church he makes this troubling statement he says and the trouble of trouble of it is you've got the church till it's no more the masonic lodge or any other lodge they've turned church and the and the having of church and even the facilities of a church turn it into nothing more than a lodge he says the church is a house of god where christ lives and manifests himself amongst the people and you realize he's referring to the actual building he's actually referring to the gathering place he's referring to not just the the the mythical or the the mystical body of christ and the body of christ that exists that transcends borders and transcends flesh and is all around the world specifically referring to that church as a house is a house of god where christ lives and manifests himself amongst the people i think that's the attitude that we ought to have to this sanctuary that this is a place this is the house of god uh there's gonna be some remodeling done there's gonna be some walls removed there might be some changes in seats and changes of of locations of chairs and platforms and many different things but we always want to remember when it comes to gathering here in our time in here that this is a gathering place where christ manifests himself amongst the people and brotherhood says even christ lives and then in the message church order i've always identified this i think we've had the opportunity to do it here a number of times how that this is the day after christmas this is december 26 1963 this was an important enough uh information to address to where he was willing to have a meeting with the board and with the trustees on the day after christmas for the canadians this would be boxing day and yet they still wanted to get together and discuss um important matters and brother brown does give a lot of emphasis to the things he's speaking on but he says this now deacons of the church and as i said are the police of the church but the church is not a general meeting house for fellowship and friendship and frolic the church is a sanctuary of god now you think oh okay so then we just come to the sanctuary we leave we can't have friendship but really have to identify he's talking about just turning it into a lodge where it's just a general meeting place where it's more about the social aspects more about that's where my family goes to church that's where they have a great youth group they have a lot of the different amenities it's a place where we can kind of satisfy the social longings that we have as humans he's saying it's not for friendship and frolic the church is a sanctuary of god so it connects with this idea the church is a house of god or christ lives and manifests himself amongst the people he says the church is a sanctuary of god now if we want to meet one another let me come to your house or you come to my house you go to one another's house and meet one another i'd say we might be able to do a better job of that as a church that we don't see each other maybe very often outside of church but if we want to meet one another we can make that effort to see one another at one another's house and invite people over and go out to see someone but he's not so much saying that we don't have that element at church but he said that's the only reason why you're coming go do it somewhere else and he says it this way but just to frolic around the church and talking and things like that it's not right brethren we come here we get the whole thing off of our mind i've read that different ways and and i think it can strike us as we read it that if we come here just for friendship and frolic and those different things then we get the right thing the sanctuary of god the dwelling place of his presence we get that the whole proper thing off of our mind but then i read it a couple of times and it struck me that when we come to church it's to get all those things off our mind the frolic the demands of our time socially and all the different demands that we have at work and and even the pulling and friendships and family we come here because it's the opportunity to put your phones in airplane mode to not have to worry about um liking someone's post or replying to something in the family chat and whatsapp it's a time that we get aside and he says then we get our minds off of all of that get the whole thing of all the all the things of the world off our mind and then i included this statement he says it just about a paragraph and a half later he says this in the sanctuary here is where the lord dwells he's not there at the tabernacle he's referring to this the very place uh where they would sit and listen to the word of god go forth he's making these outstanding statements the church is a sanctuary of god it's a house of god where christ lives and manifests himself amongst the people this in the sanctuary here is where the lord dwells and you find it it's a very unique uh dynamic in message churches and i'm sure many of you anybody ever been into another church beside a message church raise your hands you've all been in different churches and if you've been in some of the even more modern bible churches and different places and i found this uh one of the first times i was ever in a pentecostal church i was amazed at just how the sanctuary is just kind of a general meeting place where you talk about whatever you want and you and you show pictures and you share stories and you pat one another on the back and it's real casual it's just like fellowship and um in a fellowship hall until the the music starts and the song leader grabs the mic and then everybody just all of a sudden the switch is thrown and they begin to get into worship mode but one thing that's unique about our churches is that where you come in you sit you pray and you're quiet and there's a reverence for the sanctuary the reason why it's not just a place where ministers share the things they've been studying on over the last few days it's a place where the lord dwells it's a place we want to we want the lord to be welcome here and i'm certainly glad that you're here tonight and i believe you have you i trust you feel welcome here but we've come to welcome him and to let this be a place where he can dwell in the message first brother branham is talking about an age of hybriding he says they've even got churches today till they're hybrids now churches kind of have this hybrid purpose is it really the word is it really to build up faith in christ or does it become more about uh pretense and and popularity and social things he says they get in here they just go to church it's a lodge instead of a church a church is a place where people come together and worship god in spirit and in truth that's what church is for it's a place where people come together and worship god in spirit and in truth and today it's a lodge we go there and have a little time to shake hands and fellowship in some black coffee in the back of the building then go home till next week we've done our religious duty now they had that even then or was that just prophecy i mean because now i remember i remember a church down the street from my house in texas they had a they had a church and they had a little coffee bar called hebrews and uh remember another church that had a a little coffee house in it called higher grounds and it's become trendy right to have the coffee bar and what that's people come and they got a place they got a place now where they can drop the kids off and they give you a number and if your number pops up on the screen while you're in the church you know there's a problem with your kid back in the daycare and and they all serve coffee and maybe we would all take a little exception to uh black coffee here uh and maybe we'd want a latte or something with oat milk in it but brother graham's identifying if it was a trend then if it was in seed form then it's full-blown grown tree with its fruits that these things of coffee bars and amenities and social programs and different things to get the people together and people come shake hands fellowship have some lattes and go home and come back the next service and repeat and people feel that they've done their religious duty and i would say if we're not careful we could do the same thing and feel that we've done our duty according to the message we've come we shook hands we fellowship with one another and we go home and we leave off where church is a place where people come together worship god in spirit and truth the place where christ lives and manifests himself among the people you all are here on a wednesday night so i know that you value this but this gathering here streaming can't touch it just dreaming can't touch it because this is there's something very special about this dynamic something very special about the bride of jesus christ getting together to hear the word of god to encourage one another breathing bringing our licks of fire together i can testify for myself and my family i love the fact that um technology has made streaming available and i i'm always blessed when we have that opportunity to hear the service when we can't be in service but there's always a part of my heart that says this is this is just a substitute this is just to get me through this is just to get me along and and i know that there's many here that this church was started around that were faithful to stream and and and were faithful to their churches only by way of streaming but their prayer was always god bring us a place that we can call our own and have this gathering together so brother branham is telling us what it ought to be like but then he says it's come to a lodge it's uh you know it's become frolic and just friendship it's been social shake hands fellowship have some coffee come back the next week and then he makes this observation i felt it just fit so perfectly in this and i i trust that everybody's still excited as i read these things i just maybe this is just what i needed in my heart just to feel like i'm addressing um this opportunity that we have and the newness of it and and what we have to look forward to going as we move on but in the message stand still brother bram says it's a nervous age what is it i give this solemn warning to the church stand still what a message from the prophet it's a it's a nervous age stand still in this nervousness there's this fidgeting there's this restlessness he says stand still god always commands us stands still before he does anything and then he then he says this the church is in a neurotic stage the church is in a neurotic stage what a remarkable assessment of the church age it's a neurotic stage and it's something that he's identifying in her expectations and her anticipations and in her spirit he says every church is a proselyting and pulling and fussing and stewing he says it's a neurotic age i want you to think about that as he says the church is in a neurotic stage and then he says because of this neurotic stage of the church age if i could say it that way he says there's the spirit on churches where they're they're worried about the numbers they're worried about the people they're work they're pulling they're fussing they're stewing and there's churches that exist just to oppose other churches and there's churches that fight back and forth and there's pushing in this pool and and he says it's a neurotic age that's a sign of this neurosis is the the fuss and the stew and the fighting the pulling and the proselytizing he says but stand still he says now that's the message and then he's bringing it back to um when they crossed over and they said caleb stealed the people or that opportunity they had at cades barnea and i was really studying that and pondering that and i maybe the lord will just open it up to speak on it to you all um personally is that they're finally there rose up a generation that was finally going to cross over and when that and there was a time when there was this division that took place where there was a generation that wasn't going to cross over but there was going to be a generation that would and god had to start focusing everything on that next generation and he says notice caleb the people had just come back the spies from over in the promised land there was that cadis barnea they'd been brought through many trials and seen the hand of god in a very beautiful picture of the full gospel church and many of them had become discouraged discouraged and upset because so many different isms and things has happened in the church can we say amen to that i read to you these three statements about what church is supposed to be and i imagine if we had time to talk to one another there's many of us that testify you know what church no longer became it was no longer that for us it had lost its specialness it wasn't this house of god where christ lived it was more about the friendship and it was more about the frolic and the social things that shake hands fellowship have some coffee in the back of the building and we see all these things as they might be and now he said it's a neurotic age and people become discouraged and upset with the isms and things that have happened in the church but he says but that don't take away the real thing no matter what your experience has been in church before no matter what image has been put before you and no matter no matter if you don't see your proper image somewhere let me tell you there is a place where god's word is living there's a place where the word of god is manifest and and there's people that believe the word of god and very um convinced of its truths and i and i may have mentioned this sunday you know let's ask people where is it being manifested where is it in flesh where does god manifest him in the word of god and i would say come and see come and see where god's word is alive so these things that we've seen don't take away from the real thing he said god calling his church to halt stand still don't be jumping and running not knowing what you're doing come back to the word come back to christ i believe that we have a wonderful opportunity as a church as we're young as we're growing as we enter into a new stage where we have our own facilities and there'll be some growing pains and maybe even some birth pains as we come into a new facility and growing pains as we uh fill it up and as we learn to use it but let's always remember what it's for there may be some other ways that we can use the things around us but let's always remember it's for moments like this where the word is preached a place where god himself can come down amongst us and make himself known and so if you want to look with that as even um the part of the foundation and i just in my heart i don't want to take very long tonight because we do i do want to uh when we wrap it up and we're done just give you an opportunity uh just to look around to take it all in to fellowship with one another and and enjoy enjoy this time since i know there's maybe some excitement and there's some newness to it uh i just wanted to respect that and honor that tonight maybe not belabor any point or or uh try to preach something when everybody's going i wonder what it looks like behind that wall and i wonder what i wonder what's over there and i wonder what's over here and and you just want to take it all in and so i wasn't going to try to fight against that and have 80 to 90 people staring at me like i i really want to i want to see the place please brother and just let me see the place and so i'll let you see the place and we'll have that opportunity to do that when the service is dismissed but with that with that as a kind of a foundation what struck me is this is home for now but you know there's always a better home in hebrews chapter 11 verses 8 to 16. let's just walk through these verses tonight together and i have provided them if there's any mistakes in the slides i did it just from here at the last minute didn't even know if we'd have an opportunity to see slides i didn't even didn't know what was going to happen i finally today just in some of the time and logistics of things i just said i'm just gonna get ready for church and go there and show up and hopefully everything works out and it did it's all worked out i kind of announced and let everybody know so that i can always say hey look i have detrimentally relied upon our verbal agreement and i've let everybody know and so i could have some cause of action tomorrow morning maybe get an injunction going if we don't get in but i say that jokingly if the owners happen to be streaming but hebrews chapter 11 verses 8 to 16 by faith abraham we went through this quite a bit in supreme faith of abraham by faith abraham when he was called to go out so god calls him out into a place so he's called to go out somewhere which he should after receive from inheritance this phrase to me just becomes more and more profound as i read through different places in the scripture to recognize that abraham isaac and jacob never possessed the promise that was given to them they never they never had it as it was promised he's called to go out into a place that he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and he's obeying and he went out not knowing whether he went could we do that could we have the faith of abraham god says go and you just go and say but where am i going i said i'll show you later he said and here's the phrase i want to start focusing on by faith he sojourned in a land of promise as in a strange country so the soul journey that means to dwell in a place as a stranger and and so he you don't souljarn in your own native country don't sojourn in a place that's your own you're not uh sojourning in your house that is your house it's your place of abode but when it says he sojourned in the land the promise the place that he should after receive for inheritance but it wasn't his he said potentially one day by faith and by vision he could believe that it was his but he lived in it as a stranger and he says this way as in a strange country the phrase means in a foreign country or in another man's country here it is it's saying this is yours you can have it it's yours but you can't take possession now and as he walked through the land he's looking around saying these people own these houses they own these lands and they own these cattle and they own these hills and it's like they own it as theirs it's their possession and i am a foreigner i'm an immigrant in their country and they all are living here with their possession and he's a souljourning as a stranger in a strange country and because it was uh he was traveling as a stranger in a strange country a country that was not his own it says he dwelled it says dwelling in tabernacles with isaac and jacob the heirs with them of the same promise a tabernacle may not be the tabernacle we're most familiar with today we put the name tabernacle on buildings but this would be a this would be a tabernacle here would be a tent consisting of poles and maybe some some plants of some sort or animal skins would make this all things together to create a dwell in place but it's a tabernacle with these poles and animal skins so it can be easy to move it says it's dwelling in tabernacles dwelling in tents it's wanting to signify that they were journeying in a strange country as strangers and they never they never built a permanent house they never fixed themselves in an area where they could say this is our own as a matter of fact a lot of the history's looked at abraham and his children as nomadic people that they just were always on the go and they always were moving and that's how they came all the way out of babylon down into the promised land that they they were never fixed in one spot for very long i think we as a church kind of felt that way as like abraham that we just never knew when we have to move and pick up the equipment put it in the truck and move on to another place and abraham had this uh this lifestyle that if he ever had to go he could do so quickly and that's what it's referring to dwelling in tabernacles he's on the move it's a it's he's always in transition but it says this about what's in his heart for he looked for a city verse 10 for he looked for a city which hath foundations whose builder and maker is god it's intended by the writer that the soul journey in a and in the land of promise as in a strange country soul journey as in a strange country dwelling in tabernacles it's in the writer intends to kind of have this but up against this statement for he looked for a city which have foundations whose builder and maker is god as he walked through the promised land and he looked at all the hills and the things that even he was given an inheritance in that is still in his heart living in tents he was looking for a city that had foundations and this is a stark contrast to the idea of having a tent because the foundation is something that is laid down he didn't want to just always be taking the poles and take pull them out rolling up the animal skin and packing them on the pack animals and moving on to the next place and finding the the proper uh lay lay of the land where he could take care of his cat and he can put out his tents and he can live and and could we fix it here will this work can we homestead a little while here he wanted to come to a place where he could put down his roots something that half foundations as it said something steadfast and unmovable it's the exact opposite of well i'm just kind of a stranger here i'm just kind of passing through we're not going to live here for very long when he's looking for a city to have foundations and his heart he said believe in one day i'm going to settle down forever one day i'm not always going to be moving one day i'm going to find that city which is eternal whose builder and maker is god so abraham knew and if you could kind of catch this thought tonight abraham knew that the tents weren't the ultimate and in another way and i'm maybe getting ahead of myself a little bit another way abraham knew that this this journey in this life is not the ultimate that whatever it consisted of and whatever he went through there was something that he would after receive for inheritance there was things he had to go through there was things that had to take place but he was looking for a city that had foundation so he knew that this transitory life and this unstable life and this movable life and things that could change in just a moment he knew that they were not the ultimate he had a he had a transcendent faith that he could just look at everything and say this faith is beyond this flesh it's beyond it there's i know there's more i know there's a better better thing coming i know there's better things to uh to experience and to enjoy there's more to there's more to life than even this life there's more to this existence than the things that i see and so these phrases soul journeying as in a strange country dueling in tabernacles it's to is to run counter to this idea of a city that has foundations now we'll read through verses 11 and 12 through faith also sarah herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised therefore spraying their even of one and him as good as dead so many as the stars of the sky and the multitude and as the sand which is by the seashore innumerable and then notice this and i believe it's really speaking specific it could be applied to any of the saints but specifically abraham to whom the promise was given and sarah and the child that came from them and you have isaac and jacob these are the patriarchs the god of abraham isaac and jacob and their wives makes this remarkable statement these all died in faith well i think that just kind of takes that that stain of death and kind of rubs it out a little bit because there's the devil always wants to whisper to a believer that somehow if they die of sickness if they die of cancer if they die in tragedy die in a difficult situation that somehow you can't die in faith but the bible says these all died in faith death doesn't take the faith away from a believer as a matter of fact what faith does is it just takes death and it kind of uses it to bring it into the ultimate expression of what their faith was all about right into the presence of god so there's no there's no stigma on a believer's faith if they die he said these all died in faith not having received the promises they die believing they they die with this belief that they one day would receive the inheritance and after it says that abraham knew that he would after receive for inheritance after what when would it be but he says they died having not received the promises but notice but having seen them afar off and i love this and were persuaded of them and embraced them now this is really coming to what stood out to me so much when i was studying this as it says that they saw them afar off and this is by faith and then then they're persuaded of them they don't have them but they see them and then they're persuaded they're convinced and then they can they can somehow embrace them it's not yet here present with me but somehow i can embrace them and then through this process of seeing persuading and embracing it has this uh effect upon their confession and confessed that there were strangers and pilgrims on the earth now this is a remarkable statement and paul is going to come back and i'm going to come to it here in a moment and he's going to tell us why this is so remarkable he said this this the fact that they're willing in the absence of any title deed in the absence of any evidence in the absence of anything that they could lay claim to they can see it be persuaded of it and embrace it and then say you know what i'm a stranger and a pilgrim on the earth this is a remarkable statement and paul will tell us why but notice strangers it means a foreigner literally the word means an alien it's to be away from your homeland and we would use maybe today we say stranger but maybe today we'd say an immigrant and maybe people are trying to maybe use uh some aggravating language they may call them illegals or something there's ways that people try to agitate it and and aggravate a little bit put a stigma on it but we're literally talking about someone who's a foreigner in a strange country and a country that's not their own they're an immigrant they're a foreigner they're an alien it means to be away from your own homeland this is it so they confess now notice this remarkable they confess they were strangers this is their confession and pilgrims one who comes from a foreign country into a land to reside and so we're strangers we're pilgrims we kind of get the idea maybe the concept of immigrants and pilgrims in the united states and that's how we you know that's how we settled here originally the pilgrims it means somebody who's come from another country into a land that is not their own but we're going to we're going to reside here confessing we're just strangers and pilgrims on the earth and then this is for they that this is what out it's so amazing they that say such say such things declare plainly that they seek a country somebody who says such things as that is declaring plainly well what do you mean those that see them afar off and are persuaded of them embrace them and then are willing to say that while i'm here i'm just a stranger while i'm here i'm just a pilgrim what do you mean your family grew up here and you've owned this land for decades and you have a house and you have this while i'm here i'm a stranger and i'm a pilgrim they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country the word country means one's own place a fixed abode or a home it's one they seek a home they seek a fixed abode they seek something that is their own the word country it comes from the root something that is remarkable something that's noted or marked out something conspicuous so it gets the idea of borders or walls and things that kind of frame something up they declare that one day i'm gonna have my own place one day i'm gonna have my own home and they say people who say such things as this plainly declare that they're seeking a home the word country refers to and then he says and truly if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out if their minds had been on the country they left is it there's really the the idea of a man with no country is maybe just a real oddity or an outlier but they clearly came from somewhere and abraham's identified with family and lands and possessions and he comes from this uh this land of china and he's coming out of uh er he's coming out of the land of the chaldees he's coming out of babylon and harry is coming he's traveling in he says now if they had been mindful of the original home that they had they'd been mindful of the home that they came out of they might have had opportunity to have returned notice that they cherish the memory of where they were from then they could have gone back if that's what it was all about is just to go back to a place that you're from and it's and you're not a foreigner you're not an immigrant then they could have just gone back to babylon it's what the bible's saying that if it was just a matter of having your own place if it was just a matter of having your name on it the title on there having a history there this is where we all grew up and it's something you could call your own it says if they'd just been mindful of this earthly life and these earthly things and they could have just returned if they cherished their original home like that that much they could have just gone back but it makes this statement think of this they confess that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth for they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country and if they'd been mindful that country from which they came out they might have had opportunity to return but now they desire a better country now they desire a better country that isn't heavenly wherefore god is not ashamed to be called their god for he hath prepared for them a city this is where i got the inspiration a better home they desire a better country they desire it's an ardent longing for the possession of something you do not have right now but you believe that you ultimately will be able to call it your own as it says having seen them afar off persuade them and embrace them there's this reaching out an ardent desire to possess something that you do not have now but yet you believe that one day you will have it when they they desire and even the language that paul is used to this point it's wanting to bring up this image that there's a yearning for there's a stretching forth at the hands for it that though they were strangers on earth and they were pilgrims on the earth they had this long and they had they stretched out their hands for something they did not yet possess but one they knew that they would so they desire a better this word means more useful serviceable more advantageous i can say that this is definitely where we're at now uh is a church is even more useful more serviceable maybe it doesn't have the full service maybe it doesn't have the nice fire feature on the patio maybe there's a lot of things that are different not as many stories here as we had at the other place but it's more useful more advantageous they desire a better something that was better and actually one of the renderings of it translation is something more excellent so the beauties of the word of god is you could have excellent excellent excellent more excellent you can have good good good gooder that you can have you can have something that's good and you can have something that's uh uh more excellent but then you've got something more excellent a more perfect oh that's perfect i know how to make it more perfect and this is just something that you can have as an expectation as a believer says they desire a better country something they call they could call their own a better kingdom a better home that in their journey and in their in their lives no matter what they had acquired and what they had learned and accepted and experienced and even achieved and accumulated and possessions that they could call their own it says they desire a better country something more excellent something that was a better a better kingdom than kingdoms of this earth a better home than the earthly homes they desired something better and let me say this for us and i could express this for all of us that are here tonight as believers we desire a better home and maybe there's some wives here saying amen to that yep i want a better place than i'm living in now that may be true in the natural we may desire a better place to live with more square footage or a better location or more land or better amenities or something upgraded but when we as believers begin to think about our faith and what's deep inside our hearts no matter what we accomplish here with jobs and job promotions and houses and new houses maybe second homes and second cars maybe being able to go on vacations no matter what the balance sheet is telling us no matter what our p l is declaring to us as believers we declare that there must be something better than what we have possessed until now i believe this ought to be the heartbeat of every single christian believer that i always have something it's not a disregard for what i have it's not a disrespect for what i've been given it's not this dissatisfaction and disdain for any blessings of god but something down inside of me as it says they declared plainly as believers we declare there must be something better than what i possess till now and i would say it to us in a spiritual sense wherever you are in your walk with god whatever move of god you've experienced in your life let there be something down inside of you say there must be something better than what i've experienced up until now and then to even view it as a whole of what are these experiences for what are these gatherings all about why are we experiencing these things do we have this thought inside of us that nothing but my future home will satisfy me maybe even in the sense that our these bodies as they long and crave we could have in our spirits say nothing but that new body will satisfy me that's what i mean when i say a better home god's blessed us as a church to have a place we can call our own it's wonderful that we just we're all gathered together as family on a wednesday night and it feels like we fit like a glove like this is fitting we fit this is us this is who we are and god didn't want us to go out and and and get something that uh that looked any different than this because this is what he provided i may i was maybe pondering different things i could share things i could say and maybe there'd be a more appropriate time to do it but if i'm not mistaken brother mike i believe it was just last wednesday we stood right at the doors there the door there at the hilton garden inn and we were just talking about they hadn't been delivered a contract and we didn't know why they were dragging their feet and i just said uh and it really wasn't me speaking based upon the way i conducted myself for the next 48 hours but i said you know what i just know that if a hotel tells us tomorrow that they don't want us anymore then there'll just have to be something available friday and uh and i knew i said that but i didn't act like i did on thursday when the email came and said yeah you've been paying three thousand we're sorry we did get the contract to you it's gonna be 12 000 now if you want it a month and i went maybe full panic mode and i reached out to other people who wouldn't panic and unbeknownst to us at the very moment that i get the email from the hotel saying we want to raise your rent to 12 grand a month there was a tenant that was getting ready to move in here the only thing they lacked was a signature on the lease at the same moment they called the the broker and said we don't want it anymore and within two hours we had reached out brother jeff had reached out to him and on friday we came here for the first time and saw it and so god did exactly what he said he would do and so this is better would you agree i believe this is better but amen i believe that [Applause] but there's something down inside of us that declares there must be something better than what we even possess right now and if you want to think of that in terms of maybe a natural gathering place that's certainly fine i have a vision that we could own our own place one day a place as we grow and god continues to add that it would be fitting for everyone and meet the needs of the church but i do know for us on a spiritual level our eyes are on something else it says this in psalms 137 verses 1 just read to verse 6 it says by the rivers of babylon it's just a beautiful um image by the rivers of babylon there we sat down i feel like that's where us sometimes here in laodicea and satan's eden by the rivers of babylon there we sat down we wept when we remembered zion we hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof for there they that had carried us away captive required required of us a song and they that wasted us required of us mirth saying sing us one of the songs of zion he was being carried away captive dragged out of your home dragged out of jerusalem dragged out of israel dragged out of palestine dragged away from your inheritance your promise and there you are by the rivers of babylon and you and your your heart is thinking about zion and you hang your harps on the willows and your captors your kidnappers your abusers say oh sing us a song of home sing us a song in your tongue sing us sing to us of the place that you came from and they say how shall we sing the lord's song in a strange land and then it says and it certainly speaks to the difficulty of it the hardness of it but it says if i forget the o jerusalem let my right hand forget her cunning if i forget this place of promise if i forget this place that god has given us as an inheritance if i forget it then let my hands forget their skills if i do not remember thee let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth this is this is wishing a deterioration and judgment and corruption upon their person upon their abilities upon their substance let let me let me wither and die if i forget theo jerusalem if i prefer not jerusalem above my chief joy what an attitude carried away captive strangers in babylon and have this heaviness in their heart that no matter what i may be given here what i may learn what i might excel at what i uh opportunities i might have oh god let me not forget jerusalem if i forget jerusalem let my right hand forget her cunning if i do not remember they let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth if i prefer not jerusalem above my chief joy i wonder if that was the song they would sing it was a song of exile and longing for which their what was their rightful possession a song that spoke of home a song that spoke of better things a song that always remembered that though i'm here i have a promise there and that i prefer jerusalem above my chief joy and there's a more modern day phenomena of the jews being scattered all over the world they call it the jewish despora and they've been scattered out of israel and they were driven out of israel over the world but yet these israelites these jews were very faithful to continue to observe their their feasts and their traditions and and as these jews would be gathered out into all these other places all over the world they would still celebrate their cedar and they would celebrate yom kippur and in those particular two feast on the conclusion of both the cedar knight and yom kippur they would always have a phrase next year in jerusalem it just it's such a remarkable phrase it just moves me to think about it that here they are they're strangers they're gathered off in some other place they they their hearts are on home their hearts are on jerusalem and they're they're scattered around the world and they'd get together and they'd have a feast but they would every time they'd say next year next year we're going to do this in jerusalem let's not do it here again next year let's do it in jerusalem and that was always their hope they never got complacent they never got satisfied and looked at everything they had and their wealth and everything they accumulated they knew there was something that was above their chiefess joy something greater than anything else they possessed and it was their longing next cedar may it be in jerusalem and they had this phrase next year in jerusalem why because in their language of the haggadah it was this phrase jerusalem it was the final stage of redemption for them whatever has happened whatever we've experienced whatever god is doing we know that it's not complete until we're in jerusalem and for them to gather together and then say next year jerusalem it was signifying a vision for something better signifying a longing for something better something promised something that was theirs and it didn't belittle the feast they were right to keep the feast they didn't despise doing the feast and they were faithful to do it everything they kept perfectly but they kept it believing one day this may be the last time they had in their hearts next year jerusalem maybe we could have the same desire next year new jerusalem if we were just beginning last year at this time and then we find ourselves in this facility this time next year lord next year new jerusalem lord we don't want to get complacent here we don't ever want to lose this edge that we have as a young church we want to always remember what this is for and what it's all about because it says in hebrews chapter 13 verse 14 for here we have no continuing city no permanent city here we have no continuing city remember that doesn't matter if you hold own the the title to your home outright free and clear as believers we have this thought here i have no permanent city but we seek one to come we're soldiers here on earth pilgrims knowing that heaven is our home and this is not our abode here this is not our this is not what we're called to so we look to things that are to be i say to us as a church arizona believers church this is home as a church we seek a better one we do and so what we'll do is we'll make this the best until better comes we'll make it the best we'll get everything out of this that god desires us to have we'll treat it we'll treat it as if it is our own we'll take care of it we'll be respectful of it we'll leave it in a better condition than we found it and we'll have respect to this this place the facilities will certainly have respect to this gathering place right here this sanctuary and will make it best until better comes because as believers we can declare plainly that we seek a home we seek a better home and then i say it to us as believers each one in your families the heads of homes and those that make up this church never get complacent or lose sight of the gold just as they kept the feast and cedar they kept it in yom kippur and they reminded themselves every time at the end just remember next year in jerusalem let's remember our goal our goal is the rapture art that we desire as they say i prefer jerusalem above my chief joy i prefer translation above my chief joy oh brother aaron what's your favorite do you like this do you like that i enjoy this do you like being there i enjoy that i love this i love that but i prefer i prefer rapture i you say how would you love church oh i absolutely love it though i look forward to these times i hope you do too i think about them i long for them i look forward to them i'm so excited about what the future holds but if you ask me well do you want me to go ahead and tarry a little bit so you can enjoy the facility so no no no no what i prefer more and what i want more is a body change as much as i love church as much as i love you and these bodies i think you're going to be a lot better in a new one no offense i'm going to be a lot better in a new one i want to be together in that eternal youth meeting at that meeting in the air that's going to that i prefer that above any of my chief joys and that is what i look forward to and so my final statement to you tonight and we'll just worship for a little bit as brother branham says in the message proven his word he says last sunday i'll just mention this i don't have it up there but he just makes this statement last sunday was a week ago i spoke on the subject the future home of the bride and groom so this is his where his mind is his mind is on this future home of the bride and groom and he says i've been feasting on that ever since knowing that when this life is over i'm going to that city i'm bound for that city and nothing else matters oh my if that really could begin to break on us it it can change attitudes change perspective it could be that paradigm shift we said i'm going to that city and the path that i'm on now and that i'm fighting for i'm striving in that i'm doing my best to surrender to the the mind of god and letting him have preeminence and whatever difficult difficulties that brings it says i'm bound for that city and nothing else matters that's the kind of attitude we ought to have and they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a better home to say nothing else matters what matters rapture or boss what else am i it's about the rapture it's about the body change it's about applying the token it's about getting out of here and nothing else matters oh well you don't own this you don't own that you guys are just written your church well it's not this big it doesn't have that it doesn't it you only have eight foot ceilings ah well one day guess what this the sky is not even be able to hold me i'm gonna be able to travel like a thought and that and nothing else matters he says what if the sun doesn't shine today or tomorrow never comes what difference does it make we got a home a resting place tired or not tired we still have that resting place a better home god bless you let's stand together tonight
