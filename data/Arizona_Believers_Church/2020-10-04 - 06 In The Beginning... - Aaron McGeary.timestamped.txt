[0:00] one verse there
[0:03] this morning and then we'll jump right
[0:05] into some other spots here it says
[0:07] and in that day shall the deaf hear the
[0:10] words
[0:11] of the book and the eyes of the blind
[0:14] shall see out of obscurity
[0:16] and out of darkness my what a beautiful
[0:19] beautiful description
[0:21] for the time that we're living in in
[0:22] that day shall the deaf hear the words
[0:25] of the book
[0:26] and the eyes of the blind shall see out
[0:28] of obscurity and out of
[0:30] darkness let's go to the lord in prayer
[0:33] our heavenly father we're so grateful to
[0:35] be gathered together today
[0:37] as believers as the bride of jesus
[0:41] christ lord as those who are longing to
[0:42] fellowship with you and those who
[0:44] desire to have your word take
[0:46] preeminence in our lives
[0:48] so lord we pray today that you would
[0:50] just bless us with your presence and
[0:52] we acknowledge it already lord we sense
[0:55] your presence and we
[0:56] we're grateful for it now lord we pray
[0:58] that the word would be rightly divided
[1:00] to our hearts
[1:01] that we could feed on it sustain us and
[1:03] strengthen us
[1:04] and i commit the people to you today
[1:06] that are here the many who would desire
[1:09] to be here unable to make it
[1:10] lord there's different ones that have
[1:12] reached out and expressed they can't be
[1:13] here today but they wanted to be
[1:15] i pray that you be with them in them
[1:17] their circumstance
[1:18] lord we pray for those who would be
[1:20] streaming that there would be a
[1:22] connection with the body of christ that
[1:24] there would be a
[1:25] sense of participation in the service as
[1:28] they pull upon the word of god and may
[1:29] you speak to them
[1:31] and lord i just pray that you come now
[1:33] in a special way and speak to our hearts
[1:36] we ask this in the name of the lord
[1:37] jesus christ amen
[1:40] you may be seated
[1:43] it's good to see the strayers come down
[1:45] the hill i guess they say
[1:47] to be with us today god bless you it's
[1:49] nice to see you in the house of the lord
[1:51] wonderful wonderful for the uh the
[1:54] younger generation
[1:55] uh to see the encouragement of those
[1:58] who've gone before us
[1:59] and get behind the word of god i find
[2:01] there's such a tremendous hunger
[2:04] in the bride of jesus christ and it
[2:05] knows no boundary of age or geography
[2:09] and sometimes it comes from the most
[2:11] surprising places when you begin to
[2:12] fellowship you're like wow
[2:14] they're really feeding on the heart of
[2:15] this message they are hungry
[2:17] and it's just wonderful to see how the
[2:19] message continues to grow
[2:21] and become more real to even those that
[2:24] we've looked up to and admired for years
[2:26] who've walked in this message for
[2:27] decades
[2:28] and it's not just the same message that
[2:30] they
[2:31] were feeding on you know 30 40 years ago
[2:33] it's gone great it's gotten greater
[2:35] it's gotten brighter and it's gotten
[2:37] more intense and i think that's just an
[2:39] inspiration and encouragement to us all
[2:41] so god bless you thank you for coming
[2:43] today and visiting us
[2:45] we've been looking at genesis chapter
[2:47] one i'm just going to jump right back
[2:48] into it again
[2:50] genesis chapter 1 as we're looking at
[2:52] the subject of in
[2:53] the beginning and it says in the
[2:56] beginning
[2:56] god created the heaven and the earth i'm
[3:00] still pondering this now after a few
[3:02] months
[3:03] just how impactful this scripture is and
[3:06] just how
[3:06] full of truth and depth to it
[3:10] and what i've been looking at to maybe
[3:12] the words i want to put it in this
[3:13] morning as we've looked at what heaven
[3:15] and earth means and we've looked at
[3:16] different angles from this first chapter
[3:19] but i want to look at it this way that
[3:20] from the moment that god
[3:22] begins to create and he himself comes
[3:25] into existence as a being that is
[3:26] worship
[3:27] god is unfolding a mystery god at one
[3:30] time would have just been by himself
[3:32] that
[3:32] he would not have been known because
[3:33] there was no one to know him but as he
[3:36] creates
[3:36] he begins to unfold his nature and his
[3:39] desire and it becomes an expression
[3:41] of himself creation becomes an
[3:44] expression of the creator
[3:46] and the creation is expressing god's
[3:49] ambition
[3:50] and we have the benefit today of with by
[3:53] the word of god of knowing what was in
[3:54] his heart
[3:55] and what his ambition was that he
[3:57] created the earth for a purpose and that
[3:59] was to
[3:59] get a bride out of him so he was very
[4:01] focused and he had a singular goal
[4:03] in the beginning but yet this so it's
[4:05] expressing
[4:06] his ambition now as we say that
[4:10] he is a mystery is unfolding
[4:13] he's actually it's hidden because it's
[4:15] called a mystery if it was obvious maybe
[4:16] it wouldn't be used
[4:17] i wouldn't use that language that it's a
[4:19] mystery but he's hiding a mystery in the
[4:21] creation
[4:22] his ambition is in the creation each uh
[4:25] turn that he makes and each thing that
[4:27] he speaks and each image that unfolds
[4:29] is expressing something and holds
[4:31] significance
[4:32] and so he's hiding a mystery and we know
[4:35] that god where god hides himself he also
[4:37] reveals himself
[4:39] so he hides himself in simplicity he
[4:41] reveals himself in simplicity
[4:43] so where god was hiding himself in the
[4:45] beginning he's also revealing a mystery
[4:47] in the simplicity of creation and
[4:51] so it's as if that from this moment we
[4:53] say in the beginning god
[4:55] we can say the mystery of god begins
[4:58] because to this point we don't know god
[4:59] to this point
[5:01] he's not a being that is known he's not
[5:02] a being that is worshipped but now
[5:04] he begins to make himself known and
[5:06] declare himself and the mystery of god
[5:08] begins and in the sermon christ is the
[5:11] mystery of god revealed
[5:12] he says when you read in the beginning
[5:14] god created
[5:16] he said there is christ
[5:19] now we probably read this often and we
[5:21] read it say brother branham said you
[5:22] should see christ in every verse of the
[5:24] bible if you don't see it go back and
[5:26] read it again
[5:27] and it's almost as if this just becomes
[5:29] uh
[5:30] an exercise where we just try to see
[5:32] christ but i believe
[5:33] that in this what he's saying here in
[5:36] the beginning god created
[5:37] he's wanted us to understand there's
[5:39] christ in the beginning
[5:41] and christ is the mystery of god
[5:43] revealed so in the beginning god created
[5:46] there's
[5:46] god is being un made known and god has
[5:49] unveiled himself
[5:50] in the beginning this is the mystery of
[5:52] god being un
[5:53] unveiled in acts chapter 15 verse 18
[5:57] it says known unto god or all his works
[6:00] from the beginning
[6:02] god knows the beginning from the end god
[6:04] has a plan and this verse actually is
[6:06] speaking about god
[6:07] being very purposeful and having intent
[6:10] in creation
[6:11] and that known from the beginning is
[6:13] god's works from the beginning of the
[6:15] world
[6:15] god knows what he's doing from the
[6:17] moment that he begins to create
[6:19] god has a goal in mind he has an end in
[6:21] mind he has a place that he's going to
[6:23] arrive
[6:24] and it's it really it suggests exactly
[6:27] what we read on the face of it this is
[6:29] only known to god
[6:30] god does not begin to act and we're all
[6:32] like oh i know exactly where he's going
[6:34] i know what he's going to do
[6:35] but his purpose is hidden this secret
[6:38] belongs to the lord so it's only known
[6:40] to him
[6:41] from the beginning of the world only god
[6:43] knew what he was doing
[6:45] so with each step there's something that
[6:46] unfolds and if you could catch the
[6:48] revelation of it
[6:49] you could see the purpose of god it says
[6:52] in ephesians chapter 3 verse 9
[6:54] and to make all men see so this is
[6:56] paul's prayer to make all men
[6:58] see what is the fellowship of the
[7:00] mystery so there's a there's a mystery
[7:02] then a fellowship of the mystery the
[7:04] fellowship of the mystery
[7:06] which from the beginning of the world
[7:08] hath been hidden god
[7:10] who created all things by jesus christ
[7:13] so in the beginning god created brother
[7:15] says there is christ this is a work of
[7:17] god that's only known to god it's a
[7:19] secret that pertains to god and it's the
[7:21] mystery of god it's something that the
[7:23] father only knows what he is doing
[7:26] and now paulus says he wants men to see
[7:28] what is the fellowship of this
[7:30] mystery that from the beginning of the
[7:32] world from in the beginning it has been
[7:34] hidden god
[7:35] so god was hiding a mystery within
[7:37] himself but with each step
[7:39] there's some symbol there's some sign
[7:41] there's some foreshadowing
[7:42] that's unfolding as god brings these
[7:44] things forth
[7:45] and to make it even more plain in the
[7:47] time that we're living in now
[7:49] what god had in his mind what god in his
[7:51] heart is being made known in its
[7:53] fullness
[7:54] so that we don't we're not we're not
[7:56] just kind of guessing we're just not
[7:57] probing we're not well it's dark here
[7:59] it's a little bit cloudy there
[8:00] but rather we're living in a time where
[8:02] the fullness the plainness is coming
[8:04] and being made known to us so that we
[8:06] can have a full fellowship of a revealed
[8:08] mystery
[8:09] not just well this is a mystery that's
[8:10] fellowship around it but actually enter
[8:12] into the fulfillment of it
[8:14] so in the beginning god created he said
[8:17] there is christ
[8:19] and in second thessalonians chapter 2
[8:21] verse 13 he says but we are bound to
[8:23] give thanks always to god for you
[8:25] brethren beloved of the lord because god
[8:28] hath from the beginning
[8:30] chosen you to salvation through
[8:32] sanctification of the spirit
[8:34] and belief of the truth so from the
[8:36] beginning
[8:37] you were chosen to salvation the the the
[8:39] choosing of you unto salvation
[8:41] doesn't doesn't happen when all of a
[8:43] sudden god hears that someone's
[8:44] expecting it's oh no
[8:46] sister so-and-so is expecting well i
[8:47] wonder if it's going to be a boy or a
[8:49] girl and when they have the baby showers
[8:50] oh that's going to be a boy
[8:52] and when the baby's born he's like well
[8:53] okay let's kind of figure out where
[8:54] they're headed and what kind of nature
[8:56] do they have and
[8:57] and god's just kind of waiting to choose
[8:59] and if you have a good attitude in
[9:01] sunday school god says well maybe i'll
[9:02] choose him
[9:03] or wait it's tier 12 maybe i'll choose
[9:05] him paul is saying that since the
[9:06] beginning
[9:08] from before the foundation of the world
[9:10] god has
[9:11] chosen you and elected you to salvation
[9:14] through sanctification of the spirit and
[9:16] belief of the truth
[9:18] so in the beginning when god creates and
[9:20] this mystery begins to unfold
[9:22] you're there at the heart of god already
[9:24] chosen
[9:26] so when it says known unto god are all
[9:27] his works from the beginning of the
[9:29] world you were a chosen person
[9:31] from the beginning and god knew that all
[9:33] his works would bring you to an expected
[9:36] end all his works would have a climax
[9:39] and would have a conclusion
[9:40] wherein you were brought into fellowship
[9:42] you were brought into a relationship to
[9:44] him
[9:45] and that he would achieve what he set
[9:47] out to do when he first begin to create
[9:51] so there's a mystery that begins to
[9:52] unfold the mystery of god begins
[9:54] in verse 1 and it continues to unfold
[9:57] and it says the earth was without form
[9:59] and void
[10:00] and darkness was upon the face of the
[10:02] deep
[10:03] this darkness is obscurity it's
[10:06] confusion there's nothing distinct
[10:08] and as we read from our our text it
[10:10] would be very similar words how it says
[10:12] the blind eye shall see out of obscurity
[10:15] and out of darkness so this there's
[10:16] obscurity and there's darkness upon the
[10:19] face of the earth
[10:20] it was a dark dismal gloomy atmosphere
[10:22] as brother branham described it
[10:24] and we've we've looked into the meaning
[10:26] of that how satan's kingdom is death and
[10:28] darkness
[10:29] and it says and the spirit of god moved
[10:31] upon the face of the waters
[10:33] this is god brooding over the earth at
[10:36] taking
[10:36] impregnating whatever seed was there
[10:39] bringing life
[10:40] out of it god is now brooding over the
[10:43] earth and he brought light
[10:44] and in bringing light he brought life
[10:48] and so just a couple points of review
[10:50] god's quickening power
[10:52] transformed a chaotic world into a
[10:55] beautiful eden
[10:57] and god's quickening power separated
[10:59] darkness and it transformed chaos and
[11:00] confusion
[11:01] into order into beauty and to a a
[11:04] an eden of holiness and perfection and
[11:07] so this great mystery
[11:10] a great mystery was hidden in creation
[11:13] and now it starts to unfold and you
[11:15] could look at it even when god creates
[11:17] man and he says it's not good that man
[11:18] should be alone
[11:19] brother branham taught us that this is
[11:21] god reflecting something about himself
[11:24] so there's a mystery unfolding in
[11:25] creation we read last time and this will
[11:28] be
[11:28] maybe just our last point of review and
[11:32] then
[11:32] go further and if i say go further if
[11:34] you think i'm going to get real far
[11:35] you're probably going to think i'm
[11:36] repreaching what i've
[11:37] preached already but it's important
[11:39] sometimes just
[11:41] to just look at something over and over
[11:42] again from the perspective of the
[11:44] messenger
[11:45] as i thought about it this morning i'm
[11:47] really gonna i want to just share with
[11:49] you what brother branham taught
[11:51] uh so that we could understand these
[11:52] principles that are in the message of
[11:54] the hour that anchors us
[11:56] and we realize this is a part of the
[11:58] theme of the message this is
[12:00] these are the parameters with it which
[12:02] god is dealing with his bride
[12:04] and i want to stay within that
[12:05] foundation and so brethren says in god's
[12:08] power to transform
[12:10] in genesis chapter 1 this world was
[12:12] without form and it was void
[12:14] darkness was upon the earth nothing but
[12:16] complete chaos
[12:18] and when this world was in that
[12:20] condition the spirit of god moved upon
[12:22] the face of the water
[12:24] and the entire picture was changed from
[12:26] a total chaos
[12:28] to a garden of eden so all god's spirit
[12:31] moving the spirit of god moves upon the
[12:33] face of the water and the entire picture
[12:35] changed
[12:36] darkness obscurity blackness chaos
[12:39] changes to
[12:40] a garden of eden and remember in the
[12:43] threefold purpose
[12:44] of christ that last purpose is to
[12:46] restore us back to
[12:48] a garden of eden condition so we're
[12:51] living in this time when god once again
[12:53] wants to change the entire picture
[12:55] and restore the bride from chaos to a
[12:56] garden of eden condition
[12:58] he said that's the transforming power of
[13:00] god that can take something that's
[13:01] nothing and make something wonderful out
[13:03] of him
[13:04] that's the god i serve that's the god i
[13:06] believe in who could take something
[13:08] that's nothing and make something
[13:09] wonderful out of it that's what we're
[13:11] that's what we're tied to that's what
[13:12] we're anchored to
[13:14] now just a little bit more review so i
[13:16] apologize for misleading you and being
[13:17] dishonest
[13:18] i'm repenting for for lying to you i i
[13:21] didn't realize i had another quote here
[13:22] i wanted to read
[13:24] and and i want to just remind you of
[13:27] this at the end of the laodicean church
[13:29] age
[13:29] the world was once again spiritually in
[13:32] total chaos and darkness
[13:34] and we looked at that last sunday
[13:35] through the the phases of the moon and
[13:37] the total eclipse of the moon
[13:38] at the time that the pope was visiting
[13:40] jerusalem and so the world
[13:42] is completely blacked out in laodicea
[13:45] and we see this in revelations 3 20 this
[13:48] is prophecy now
[13:49] in revelations 3 20 it's saying that
[13:51] christ stands at the door
[13:53] behold i stand at the door and knock
[13:55] this means christ
[13:56] is now outside of the church he's
[13:58] outside of laodicea
[14:00] so something tremendous has transpired
[14:03] where christ one time who is in the
[14:04] midst of the church
[14:05] has become a fugitive brother brandon
[14:07] uses that word he's become a fugitive
[14:09] and christ who is the way the truth the
[14:11] life christ who is the light of the
[14:13] world
[14:14] he has been rejected and because he's
[14:16] been rejected there's no more light in
[14:18] the church
[14:20] if christ had been in the church maybe
[14:21] you could give a sliver of light if
[14:23] christ had been in the church
[14:25] maybe there's some indication somewhere
[14:27] but he has been rejected
[14:29] and brother branham ties this spiritual
[14:32] condition
[14:32] in laodicea to genesis chapter 1 verse 2
[14:36] he said the difference is just like it
[14:38] was in the beginning in other words
[14:39] it's just like it was in the beginning
[14:41] the similarity the situation
[14:43] is just like it was in the beginning
[14:45] when there was gross darkness upon the
[14:46] earth
[14:47] and the spirit of god moved upon the
[14:49] face of the water and said let there be
[14:51] light
[14:52] and god separated the light from the
[14:54] darkness so as a prophet he's orienting
[14:57] our view
[14:58] to these scriptures and saying if you
[15:00] can look at genesis chapter one verse
[15:02] two
[15:02] you can see a figure pre-figure
[15:04] foreshadowing or another expression
[15:07] of what we're facing today though that
[15:09] may have been in a physical sense now in
[15:11] a spiritual sense total darkness and
[15:13] chaos
[15:14] but then if that's tr if that's the case
[15:16] he's saying god
[15:17] separated light from darkness so once
[15:19] again
[15:20] he says and i believe that we are now
[15:22] living in that hour again
[15:24] when god is separating light from
[15:26] darkness and he's pressing it to the
[15:28] other side of the world
[15:30] that light might be made manifest that's
[15:32] what i want him to do in my own life
[15:34] i want him to take all the darkness
[15:36] press it to the other side of this flesh
[15:38] press it right on out put it behind me
[15:40] put it under my feet that the light may
[15:42] be made manifest and so we believe that
[15:45] we are living in that hour again what
[15:47] hour
[15:48] when the spirit of god truth is
[15:51] separating light from darkness the word
[15:54] is
[15:54] taking the flesh taking the world taking
[15:57] the devil
[15:58] taking uh sickness and disease and
[16:00] darkness and unbelief
[16:02] and he's pressing it all away and he's
[16:04] separating it from the light
[16:07] and once again the word is bringing
[16:09] forth the garden of eden out of chaos
[16:12] and i say a garden he's bringing a
[16:13] garden out of chaos and what eden is he
[16:15] taking it out of
[16:16] satan's eating he it's as if he set
[16:19] satan up
[16:20] and i think satan's so deceived that he
[16:23] probably hasn't picked up on it yet
[16:25] that he got into god's eden and he made
[16:27] and he thought he made a mess of it
[16:28] but god all along knew it would take
[16:31] satan six thousand years
[16:33] to make his eden so god took 6 000 years
[16:36] to make his
[16:37] let the devil come in and defile it
[16:39] because all along god knew
[16:41] from the beginning this was part of the
[16:43] mystery from the beginning he knew that
[16:45] once satan was like oh
[16:47] i've got it i've got my kingdom i'm the
[16:50] god of this evil age i've triumphed i've
[16:52] i've won and even in this sense and i'll
[16:55] belabor this point
[16:56] and probably wear this point out even to
[16:59] the point where he's like you know what
[17:00] after
[17:00] god seemingly restores back the church
[17:04] i killed it it's dead it's over it's
[17:06] black
[17:07] it's dark and satan's like this is my
[17:09] eden i have now
[17:11] exalted myself above the stars of god
[17:14] this is
[17:14] it isn't this wonderful it's right at
[17:17] that moment that god says
[17:18] satan you've achieved your perfect eden
[17:22] now i'm gonna bring a garden out of your
[17:25] eden
[17:26] now i'm gonna transform people
[17:29] into a beautiful garden a beautiful
[17:31] dwelling place of my presence
[17:33] right in your eden so this is going to
[17:36] be my
[17:37] uh my maybe not my thesis statement
[17:40] but the direction i'm wanting to go this
[17:42] morning and what i want to focus on
[17:44] is it's critically important for us as
[17:46] the bride
[17:47] to recon recognize the dispensational
[17:50] change that has occurred
[17:53] that at this moment that god begins to
[17:54] separate light from darkness there's a
[17:56] change in dispensations
[17:58] and you could even look at it in the
[18:00] sense that there's a blending now
[18:01] because brother branham as the elijah
[18:04] he's a keystone
[18:05] he's a keystone ministry he's a he's
[18:07] comes in the center of the arch
[18:09] and he comes in his ministry to blend
[18:11] two dispensations together
[18:13] and so it's a blending of a church age
[18:16] dispensation
[18:16] and eternity or a blending out of the
[18:19] church ages into a bright age
[18:22] and it's important for us to understand
[18:24] that there's been a change in
[18:25] dispensation there's been a transition
[18:27] by this ministry
[18:29] and also to understand and this would be
[18:31] part of my emphasis today
[18:33] to understand what full restoration is
[18:35] what full redemption is
[18:37] and and what this full uh manifestation
[18:40] of the word of god points to
[18:42] because in some ways we could actually
[18:44] view restoration
[18:45] in a light that isn't full light we can
[18:48] believe full manifestation in a light
[18:50] that's actually a glare of another age
[18:52] or looking back in another time but what
[18:55] we want to
[18:56] do is catch all the light that's
[18:58] accumulated
[18:59] and follow the pattern of the life
[19:01] toward accumulates and the entirety of
[19:03] the life
[19:03] arrives in the seed and not say there
[19:06] was life in this there was life in this
[19:08] but rather follow the life to where it
[19:10] is today
[19:11] and to understand what the full
[19:12] restoration is and what that full
[19:14] manifestation is pointing to
[19:16] and so as christ in revelations chapter
[19:18] 3 verse 20 is on the outside of the
[19:20] church
[19:21] he says behold i stand at the door and
[19:23] knock then in revelations chapter 4
[19:25] verse 1 he says after this this is after
[19:28] the church ages revelations chapter 2
[19:30] revelations chapter 3
[19:32] after these symbols have been given to
[19:34] him i looked and behold
[19:36] a door was opened in heaven i believe
[19:39] that we should connect the door of
[19:40] revelations 3 20 to this door because it
[19:42] says and
[19:43] the first voice which i heard was as it
[19:46] were a trumpet talking to me
[19:48] with me which said come up hither and i
[19:51] will show thee things which must be
[19:52] hereafter this is john now walking in
[19:56] the pattern of the bride at the end time
[19:58] to where now that christ has been put
[20:00] out of the church there's actually a
[20:01] message that calls her out of babylon
[20:03] there's a message that calls her up
[20:05] higher says come up higher
[20:06] and as you are quickened up higher you
[20:09] can actually see
[20:10] things that are transformed trans uh
[20:13] transpiring things that are to be things
[20:15] that are going to be in the future but
[20:16] then also be able to look back
[20:18] and understand what those symbols meant
[20:21] in the church ages
[20:22] i'll show thee things which must be
[20:24] hereafter which is revelations chapter 5
[20:26] the lamb taking hold of the book and
[20:28] loosing the seven seals thereof
[20:29] so the bride is now raised up i believe
[20:32] this is what this scripture
[20:33] stands for the bride is raised up and
[20:36] shown the capstone revelation
[20:38] she's raised up to see the capstone
[20:40] revelation and the climax of this
[20:42] revelation is the change of our body
[20:45] so at no point are we saying ah we've
[20:47] arrived we just kind of settle in
[20:48] isn't this wonderful but rather we
[20:50] realize that the message we have
[20:52] received in this hour
[20:54] is a message who which climax in power
[20:56] over
[20:57] death and i would say that that power is
[21:00] in you now
[21:04] so in 1962 this is december 31st 1962 in
[21:08] the contest
[21:09] he's just preached sirs is this the time
[21:11] or is this the end of the in
[21:12] sign time sir and as he's praying at the
[21:15] very end he says heavenly father as we
[21:17] stand here
[21:18] as many thoughts are dying out in our
[21:20] hearts
[21:21] and of the mistakes of last year and he
[21:23] says and as we're approaching the death
[21:25] of 1962
[21:27] and the birth of 1963 now
[21:30] this is these are significant terms now
[21:33] and if you could just grab a hold of
[21:35] this
[21:35] language he's using the death of 1962
[21:40] the birth of 1963 it's easy for us to
[21:44] very quickly think oh yeah it's new
[21:46] year's eve
[21:47] that's what he's talking about he's
[21:48] using the same language that we would
[21:50] use
[21:50] every year the death of 2020 which we
[21:53] were probably all praying for
[21:54] and the birth of 2021 somehow deceived
[21:57] into thinking it's going to be better i
[21:59] don't know
[22:00] but we we have that that we use that
[22:02] language at the time of a new year
[22:04] but brother madam as a prophet isn't
[22:06] merely commenting
[22:08] on the dying out of the calendar year
[22:11] and the birth of a calendar year
[22:13] but rather he's looking at something
[22:15] spiritual and he's looking at his
[22:16] significance
[22:17] and he's praying for the death of 1962.
[22:22] and if i could say this just from my own
[22:24] personal conviction
[22:27] i think 1962 is too much very alive in
[22:30] too many people's hearts
[22:32] and that there's a lot of people who
[22:34] love this message and fellowship in this
[22:36] message and believe this message
[22:38] but they're living in 1962 they're stuck
[22:40] in 1962
[22:42] and they haven't fully walked in the
[22:44] birth of 1963
[22:46] because brother branham when he uses
[22:47] this language the dying of the death of
[22:50] 1962
[22:51] and the birth of 1963 he's actually
[22:54] pointing to as a prophet
[22:56] that there is a death that is in 62
[22:59] there's a dying out that is transpiring
[23:01] where the entirety of life
[23:03] is coming out of laodicea darkness is
[23:05] fully coming upon laodicea but there's
[23:07] going to be a birth
[23:09] there's going to be a behold i do a new
[23:11] thing there's going to be a power come
[23:13] forth that's going to bring forth the
[23:14] full manifestation of the word of god
[23:16] and braverman says we've arrived at a
[23:18] dispensational change
[23:19] where there's going to be a death of the
[23:21] system there's going to be death of that
[23:22] order of worship there's going to be a
[23:24] death to the church age
[23:25] but there's going to be life coming to
[23:26] the bride
[23:28] a death of 1962 a birth of 63 so he says
[23:31] oh god
[23:32] may we be one step higher up the ladder
[23:37] why is he saying this because
[23:38] revelations chapter 3 has come to
[23:40] revelations 3
[23:41] 20. now we need to be one step higher up
[23:44] we need to come to revelations 4 1.
[23:46] so one step higher up the ladder until
[23:49] so wherever you're at
[23:50] on the ladder keep climbing he says
[23:54] climb one step higher one another step
[23:56] higher until we can see
[23:57] jesus and his program praise the lord
[24:00] what a beautiful sentiment of what the
[24:02] birth of 1963 is going to be
[24:05] the death of 1962 is a death to a church
[24:08] but the birth of 1963 is the rising of
[24:11] the sun
[24:12] it is the fullness of the word being
[24:14] unveiled it's christ coming on the scene
[24:16] to avenge his elect so he says just keep
[24:18] climbing the ladder
[24:19] if you take a step up higher that's a
[24:21] good job but if you don't see jesus in
[24:23] his program
[24:23] keep climbing and let me say that this
[24:26] message has delivered unto us a ladder
[24:28] that's got all the rungs we need that
[24:29] are necessary
[24:30] to keep climbing until we see jesus in
[24:32] his program
[24:33] because what comes to us in 1963 at the
[24:36] opening of the seals
[24:37] is jesus and his program amen so he
[24:40] prays a prayer with purpose may we come
[24:42] up
[24:42] one step higher up the ladder until we
[24:44] see jesus
[24:46] and we can see jesus and his program
[24:49] brother branham knew
[24:51] by vision that there was a great climax
[24:53] coming he had just preached
[24:55] sirs is this the time when he preaches
[24:57] that he references revelations chapter
[24:59] 10
[24:59] verse 7 over and over and over again
[25:03] the whole sermon is built around
[25:04] revelations chapter 10.
[25:06] it's built around those mysterious seven
[25:08] thunders uttering their voices
[25:09] it's built around the mystery of god
[25:11] being finished and he's focusing on
[25:13] the thunders the thundering forth he's
[25:15] focusing on the mysteries that'll be
[25:16] tied up and to be revealed
[25:18] and brother branham even as he stands
[25:19] there probing he's actually able to
[25:21] identify
[25:22] even before these things come to pass
[25:24] he's able to identify
[25:26] all the things that his own ministry has
[25:28] been tying up
[25:29] all the loose ends but yet he still
[25:31] realizes
[25:32] there's a mystery of god that is still
[25:35] yet to be made plain
[25:37] and he's he knew this by vision he knew
[25:39] this by multiple dreams that he elicited
[25:41] from other sources in that sermon serves
[25:44] as this the time the day before he says
[25:46] this
[25:46] may we take one step higher up the
[25:48] ladder he knew by vision that there was
[25:50] a dying out
[25:51] and he knew by vision there was going to
[25:52] be a climax something great coming
[25:56] and the scripture that he's pointing to
[25:58] is revelations chapter 10 verse 7
[26:00] but in the days of the voice of the
[26:01] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[26:04] sound
[26:05] the mystery of god should be finished as
[26:08] he had declared to his servants the
[26:10] prophets the mystery of god
[26:13] is going to be finished so as we look
[26:16] and i'll say this now
[26:17] so that i'm it's not like i'm trying to
[26:18] hide anything
[26:20] in the beginning we see a mystery
[26:24] uh begin to unfold this the starting in
[26:27] the beginning is the start of the
[26:29] mystery of god
[26:30] now we're looking at a scripture which
[26:32] says the mystery of god
[26:33] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[26:35] angel the mystery of god is going to be
[26:37] finished
[26:38] so you have in the beginning it starts
[26:40] and in the ending it
[26:41] ends in the end it finishes so there's a
[26:44] finishing that we're facing
[26:45] now and is this as he says
[26:49] the mystery of god should be finished as
[26:51] he had declared to serve as the prophets
[26:53] there's a lot of layers to that a
[26:56] tremendous depth to what this mystery of
[26:58] the old testament prophets was
[27:00] but then also it's the mystery that has
[27:02] been hid since the beginning of the
[27:03] bible
[27:05] the mystery from in the beginning you
[27:06] say well brother brown brother aaron
[27:08] after this mysteries unfolded we still
[27:09] have a millennium we still have all
[27:10] these things
[27:11] uh that's to take place but what was the
[27:13] singular mystery
[27:15] think about it if god's heart purpose
[27:17] was to have a bride of his choosing
[27:19] once we are fully translated and in our
[27:22] new bodies
[27:23] then we have entered into a perfection
[27:26] to which nothing else can be added to
[27:29] and then we are as we always will be
[27:31] with him
[27:33] and so god will have then achieved the
[27:35] fullness of redemption
[27:37] not just soul not just spirit but body
[27:39] of his bride united together as a body
[27:41] in a meeting in the air together with
[27:43] christ and now god
[27:44] is expressed fully in bridegroom and
[27:47] bride and the bride from all ages
[27:49] and then the rest is housekeeping
[27:52] right he's going to start do a
[27:53] pre-millennial cleanse we're going to
[27:55] come we're going to finish a millennial
[27:56] reign on earth
[27:57] uh satisfying certain prophecies but
[28:00] then god's like
[28:01] listen from now on it's the redemption
[28:03] of the earth from now on it's bringing
[28:05] back things that the earth is long for
[28:06] and there's things that come into place
[28:08] but what we're facing now is the
[28:10] finishing of that singular mystery of
[28:12] god
[28:13] because as we come into this
[28:14] understanding we know what's next
[28:17] right we we've been told how this
[28:20] unfolds that we know what's next
[28:23] and then brother benham says this and
[28:25] this is where i
[28:26] i derived this unction in my heart to
[28:29] see the dispensation that we're living
[28:31] and to recognize what restoration is
[28:33] brilliant says in the easter seal and i
[28:35] wanted to read so many different things
[28:37] this morning
[28:38] and uh and i actually was pondering
[28:41] having an afternoon service because i
[28:43] was like man there's just so much here i
[28:44] could always just tell
[28:45] whoever wants to come back and listen to
[28:46] me finish my quotes come back
[28:49] but he says oh christian what an
[28:51] opportunity we have
[28:54] he says we have opportunities are you
[28:57] listening
[28:58] because this is gonna i don't i know
[28:59] you've heard this before and you
[29:00] probably had this revelation long before
[29:02] i did because i just got it this week
[29:05] he says we have opportunities that saint
[29:07] paul
[29:08] never dreamed of having
[29:12] now chew on that for a while
[29:15] paul's revelation then brother brahman
[29:18] said
[29:19] was prophecy for today so when we
[29:22] recognize that brother branham preached
[29:24] the same gospel paul preached
[29:27] he does not say that so that we would
[29:30] bring the message
[29:31] back to another age or or take away the
[29:35] significance and the relevance for today
[29:37] or even put a period on that when he
[29:38] says i preached the same gospel paul
[29:40] preached he didn't put a period on it
[29:42] because brother branham is saying this
[29:43] even before he comes to his
[29:45] commission he was commissioned to open
[29:47] those seals he was commissioned
[29:49] to to to be a seventh angel he was
[29:51] commissioned to be a malachi 4 not just
[29:53] an angel to laodicea but a seventh angel
[29:56] of revelations 10.
[29:57] he was commissioned to be an elijah so
[29:59] he says i preached the same gospel paul
[30:01] preached he says that even before he's
[30:03] fully entering into his commission
[30:05] of these other ministries of a son of
[30:07] man revealing the son of man
[30:09] so when he says i preached the same
[30:10] gospel paul preached and the church
[30:12] would have the truth as paul had it
[30:14] it's not said to have a period because
[30:16] brother braham says
[30:17] we have opportunities that paul never
[30:20] dreamed of having
[30:22] that's a heavy statement
[30:26] we are then facing things that brother
[30:29] paul
[30:30] preached in seed form we have the
[30:33] privilege of walking in things that paul
[30:35] longed to walk in
[30:37] and because of that we cannot have what
[30:39] maybe i could term
[30:40] a church age mentality
[30:44] because if you have a church age
[30:46] mentality
[30:48] and and maybe i'm i'm putting a a a name
[30:51] on a tag on something that could mean
[30:54] different things
[30:56] but if you have a church age mentality
[30:59] then you have a thought process that's
[31:01] connected with the cycle
[31:04] because the church ages begin with the
[31:07] falling away
[31:09] and it becomes a cycle of falling away
[31:13] a messenger restoring a fallen away a
[31:16] messenger restoring to where the
[31:18] cycle of the church ages is a cycle of
[31:20] revival and death
[31:23] and that cycle repeats itself in every
[31:25] church age
[31:26] even to the last one because when
[31:29] brother branham looks at the laodicean
[31:30] church age how does he identify
[31:32] it as completely blacked out
[31:35] so he makes this statement when he's
[31:37] writing the church age book chapter
[31:38] three of the church age book
[31:39] that cycle of revival and death has
[31:42] never failed
[31:43] so it's always continued the cycle of
[31:46] revival and death in the church ages
[31:48] he says all you have to do is recall
[31:50] this last move of god in the spirit
[31:52] when men and women dress like christians
[31:54] went to church
[31:55] prayed all night took to the streets
[31:58] street corners
[31:59] and weren't ashamed of the
[32:00] manifestations of the spirit
[32:03] now brother branham is identifying a
[32:06] genuine
[32:07] move of god in the laodicean church age
[32:10] we know that later devil inspired
[32:13] took a hold of that and got into it and
[32:15] corrupted it but there was a genuine
[32:17] outpouring
[32:18] it wasn't from day one and unrighteous
[32:20] partaking it wasn't from day one just
[32:23] devil-inspired men and a bunch of
[32:25] impersonators there was a genuine
[32:27] outpouring of the baptism of the holy
[32:28] ghost and it was it was something that
[32:31] god was including in the pattern
[32:33] of the restoration of the church and
[32:35] brother brahms identifying that this
[32:37] last move of god it takes place within
[32:41] the church age he says they went out
[32:42] with all these manifestations they left
[32:44] their old dead churches
[32:46] worshiped in homes or old store
[32:47] buildings they had reality
[32:50] he says but it wasn't too long a time
[32:52] until they began to get enough money
[32:55] to build fine new churches they put in a
[32:58] choir instead of singing unto god for
[33:00] themselves
[33:01] they put gowns on the choir they
[33:03] organized a movement and ran it by man
[33:06] they soon began to read books that
[33:08] weren't fit to read
[33:10] they let down the bars and the goats
[33:12] came in and took over
[33:14] so now he's describing what happens
[33:16] within the laodicean church age
[33:18] after a divine sovereign move of god
[33:20] through the baptism of the holy ghost
[33:22] it wasn't long until these things start
[33:24] happening in the church
[33:25] he says the cry of joy was gone
[33:29] the freedom of the spirit was gone
[33:32] now he says the cry of joy was gone this
[33:34] is significant because what's happening
[33:36] christ is being kicked out of the church
[33:39] the cry of joy is going as it says in
[33:41] jeremiah 33 11 the voice of joy
[33:44] in the voice of gladness the voice of
[33:46] the bridegroom
[33:47] and the voice of the bride the voice of
[33:49] joy and the voice of gladness is
[33:51] connected with the voice of the
[33:52] bridegroom
[33:53] it's connected with the voice of the
[33:55] bride so as there is a
[33:56] falling away in a blackness that's
[33:58] descended upon leo to see it but
[34:00] says the cry of joy is gone the voice of
[34:02] god the voice of the bridegroom is no
[34:04] longer in the midst of her
[34:05] the voice of the bride is being snuffed
[34:07] out it's dwindling it's narrowing down
[34:09] there's darkness coming upon it the cry
[34:11] of joy is gone the freedom of the spirit
[34:13] is gone
[34:14] and he says oh they kept on with the
[34:16] form
[34:18] now think they kept on with the form of
[34:21] a voice of joy
[34:23] they kept on with the form of the
[34:25] freedom of the spirit
[34:27] they kept on with the form he says but
[34:30] the fire had died down
[34:32] in the blackness of ashes is all about
[34:35] is about all that is left
[34:39] this is brother random as he's writing
[34:40] the church age book
[34:42] this is you know it also it would have
[34:44] been finished after these seals are open
[34:46] he's accurately depicting the seventh
[34:49] church age
[34:50] as being blacked out burnt over the fire
[34:53] is gone
[34:54] it's the blackness of ashes and all that
[34:56] is left
[34:58] are the ashes
[35:02] says but they kept on with the form
[35:05] why because in the end time satan's
[35:08] power
[35:10] if it were possible could deceive the
[35:11] elect
[35:13] so it means it comes in a form so close
[35:16] and in second timothy chapter 3 verse 5
[35:18] he says having a form of godliness
[35:21] but denying the power thereof from such
[35:24] turn away
[35:26] having a form great is the mystery of
[35:28] godliness the mystery of goddesses god
[35:31] made manifest in the flesh
[35:33] and so they have a form of godliness
[35:36] they have a form of the cry of joy they
[35:37] have a form of the freedom of spirit
[35:39] but it's all in a form because he says
[35:41] they deny the power
[35:43] of the re of godliness they denied the
[35:45] power thereof which brother brahm said
[35:48] they deny the power of revelation
[35:51] he quotes the scripture and he says the
[35:53] power of revelation
[35:55] so they have a form of godliness but
[35:57] denied the power of revelation which
[35:59] revelation is a transforming power
[36:02] so they have a form of god it's form it
[36:04] means the shape
[36:05] or the semblance the the image that we
[36:08] now
[36:09] should properly have is that of a shuck
[36:12] which is in the shape of the seed
[36:14] which is the husk which is in the
[36:16] semblance of the seed
[36:17] and by visually looking at it you may
[36:19] instinctively think it is the seed
[36:22] but you have to separate the shark to
[36:24] find the life
[36:26] so it can look like seed it could maybe
[36:29] bend down and bow like seed there's ways
[36:31] that it might
[36:32] seem to be seed but it's just a shuck or
[36:35] a husk around the seed
[36:36] because the life has already left the
[36:38] husk
[36:40] and what does brother branham pointedly
[36:43] and consistently do he identifies the
[36:46] laodicean church age as husk
[36:48] he identifies the pentecostal age and
[36:50] the pentecostals
[36:52] as husk he calls him shock and he
[36:54] preaches a sermon says the shock is not
[36:56] heir with the wheat
[36:58] one is to understand not so much in the
[37:01] sense that he's
[37:02] taking the pentecostals and running them
[37:03] down and and pushing them down but
[37:05] rather
[37:06] helping the genuine pentecostal to
[37:08] understand that their inheritance
[37:10] isn't in that but there's more
[37:13] it's not just the way he uses the
[37:16] language it's not just a rebuke to
[37:17] pentecost
[37:18] and maybe a judgment upon the
[37:20] pentecostals and a judgment upon
[37:21] laodicea
[37:22] but in the very judgment there's a
[37:23] blessing and the very judgment and say
[37:26] look elect those who have the
[37:27] pentecostal blessing those who've
[37:29] experienced the the experience because
[37:31] pentecost is an experience
[37:33] the baptism of the holy ghost there's
[37:34] more
[37:36] there's more to there's this experience
[37:38] is leading you into something greater
[37:39] something further
[37:40] so when you when it identifies it as
[37:42] shock you don't say well i i guess i'm
[37:44] shocked no
[37:45] you follow the entirety of the life
[37:47] you're not merely fellowshipping in the
[37:48] husk age you've entered
[37:50] into the grain age the week time the
[37:52] bride time the rapture time
[37:55] so it may seem like judgment but it's
[37:57] actually invitation
[37:58] because that's exactly what genesis
[38:00] chapter 3 verse 15 is
[38:02] the judgment upon the serpent was what
[38:04] prophecy of a redeemer
[38:06] and as as the serpents being condemned
[38:09] as the serpents being judged actually a
[38:11] way is being made for restoration
[38:13] back to the garden of eden a restoration
[38:15] back to the
[38:16] uh to the the condition of the garden of
[38:18] eden
[38:19] so any judgment that's pronounced upon
[38:21] laodicea any judgment that's pronounced
[38:23] upon pentecostals
[38:24] is not done to slam the door as it was
[38:26] but to awaken the bride to an entrance
[38:29] into where god is today
[38:34] and and not so much and again not
[38:36] leaving things behind
[38:38] in that we abandon uh the restoration of
[38:40] the gifts or we abandon the
[38:42] move of the holy spirit but we take it
[38:43] with us because
[38:46] wesley did not bring a revelation of
[38:48] sanctification
[38:49] by abandoning justification it would
[38:52] have never worked
[38:53] sanctification could only properly rest
[38:55] upon justification
[38:56] and the baptism of the holy ghost to the
[38:58] restoration and the gifts did
[39:00] not settle on its own accord but it
[39:02] followed
[39:03] justification and sanctification and
[39:05] they became more
[39:06] perfect in the baptism of the holy ghost
[39:08] so there was no
[39:09] abandoning the prior truths but it was
[39:12] being assumed into a more perfect part
[39:16] so when that which is perfect is common
[39:17] maybe i'm getting to preach what i left
[39:19] out of my notes
[39:19] i wanted to come to that which is
[39:21] perfect because we do have today by
[39:23] divine vindication
[39:25] so the parts are assumed into the whole
[39:27] so we cannot look down on justification
[39:29] we cannot disdain sanctification
[39:31] and we ought to never have the wrong
[39:33] view of the gifts and the wrong move of
[39:35] the holy spirit because it's part of our
[39:36] inheritance
[39:40] it's part of what god was making for us
[39:44] part of what god is choosing for us
[39:48] now in isaiah chapter 28
[39:53] verses 9 to 11
[39:57] so i appreciate the tremendous
[40:01] the tremendous pull up on the word of
[40:02] god that that i'm experiencing
[40:05] i imagine god must feel that there must
[40:08] be some
[40:09] uh some joy that he's experiencing
[40:13] uh god enjoys imparting life
[40:17] we've been referred to that the joy he
[40:19] enjoys
[40:21] when his people are hungry for the word
[40:23] and pulling on the word
[40:25] and as you're attentive and as you're
[40:27] listening uh that that rejoices god's
[40:30] heart
[40:31] i and and i'll say this brother branham
[40:34] always said that the amen was for the
[40:36] preacher
[40:39] so the amens are sick them to the
[40:42] preacher
[40:42] but god feels the spool of your heart
[40:46] right so if you if you tend to be one
[40:49] that is quiet
[40:50] don't ever feel like god hasn't seen you
[40:51] because you're not shouting
[40:53] if you tend to be one that just kind of
[40:55] sits there and earnestly pulls and maybe
[40:56] one that takes no
[40:58] notes and you're not boisterous i don't
[41:00] feel that you're missed god
[41:01] feels that god senses that and the man
[41:03] of god does too
[41:05] he's properly got himself out of the way
[41:06] if he's prepared himself through the
[41:08] weak and kept his
[41:09] uh spirit sanctified and his heart upon
[41:12] the center of the message then he feels
[41:14] he feels the pull of the people
[41:17] and so i i feel all of it right now
[41:20] of course i would say that after i
[41:22] prefaced it that way
[41:23] but i've since the pull of it now
[41:26] with the with the move of pentecost in
[41:28] view and this transition this move
[41:30] further
[41:31] brother branham identifies the this
[41:34] prophecy in isaiah chapter 28 verses 9
[41:36] to 11
[41:37] he places this within the context of the
[41:41] baptism of the holy ghost and laodicea
[41:43] the restoration of the gifts
[41:44] and notice the question is asked whom
[41:46] shall he teach knowledge
[41:48] and whom shall he make to understand
[41:49] doctrine
[41:51] so knowledge and understanding teaching
[41:55] and who will he teach knowledge
[41:58] in understanding doctrine this is what's
[42:00] brought into view
[42:02] now we know that there was a teaching
[42:04] reign that had to follow
[42:06] that had to come and because the
[42:08] teaching reign hadn't come
[42:10] it wasn't the final climax when god
[42:13] restored
[42:13] the gifts in laodicea because god
[42:15] there's still more
[42:17] it's not again that man got out of order
[42:19] and god had to go oh man i was just
[42:21] about to do something and you got out of
[42:22] pace
[42:23] god had it planned from the beginning
[42:25] just the way that it would unfold
[42:27] and so this is the question who am i
[42:29] going to teach knowledge
[42:30] who am i going to make to understand
[42:32] doctrine so knowledge and understanding
[42:34] this teaching this understanding this is
[42:37] what is in view
[42:38] and it says them that are weaned from
[42:40] the milk
[42:41] so as newborn babes we desire the
[42:43] sincere milk of the word that we may
[42:46] grow thereby so it's them that are
[42:49] weaned from the milk and drawn from the
[42:51] breast so the images of one
[42:53] who is birthed but then goes to the
[42:55] process of development to where they
[42:57] mature
[42:58] from milk even to meat and god desires
[43:02] this
[43:02] for us as individuals but he also
[43:04] desired it for the church
[43:07] and paul in hebrews said i have things i
[43:09] want to teach to you but you become dull
[43:10] of hearing
[43:11] and you have need again to be taught
[43:13] what be the first principles
[43:15] because you don't have the maturity to
[43:17] receive meat
[43:18] because the full word meat belongs to
[43:20] those who are full age
[43:23] and so there is going to be an our time
[43:25] and i say there's going to be because
[43:27] i'm kind of looking at it in 62
[43:28] as we transit transition to 63. so i'll
[43:31] say in present time
[43:33] we are in the time of full age
[43:36] the time of maturity where meat is given
[43:38] out to the church
[43:40] and therefore as individuals we are born
[43:43] babes and when you receive the baptism
[43:46] only goes you obey but now you feed on
[43:48] the word of god
[43:49] and you grow from babes to adults
[43:52] you grow into maturity so this is true
[43:55] to the church
[43:55] this is true also to the individual and
[43:57] he's saying who am i going to teach
[43:59] knowledge who am i going to make
[44:00] understand doctrine
[44:01] those that have matured to that place
[44:03] where it's time
[44:05] so he says for precept must be upon
[44:07] precept precept upon precept
[44:09] line upon line line upon line here a
[44:12] little and there a little so things are
[44:13] building right
[44:15] things are things are building up he
[44:16] says for with stammering lips and other
[44:19] tongue
[44:19] will he speak to his people now it might
[44:23] seem to be backwards because he's saying
[44:26] who will i teach knowledge who shall i
[44:27] make to understand doctrine
[44:29] he very could have very well said
[44:30] because with stammering lips and other
[44:32] tongues
[44:33] will i speak to people speak to the
[44:34] people and that signifies the birth
[44:38] that signifies the beginning but he's
[44:40] saying it's only those
[44:41] who have matured and grown up where
[44:44] there's line upon line precept upon
[44:45] precept
[44:46] they'll come to a time and a place where
[44:48] the full word will be revealed
[44:50] that's who's going to understand they
[44:52] that be wise daniel said seal them up
[44:54] until the end and the wise shall
[44:55] understand
[44:57] so the stammering lips referenced here
[45:00] in isaiah 28
[45:02] verse 11. it references to being in
[45:05] infancy
[45:06] and the very hebrew word that is used it
[45:08] means not able to use speech
[45:11] napios it literally means no word
[45:15] so it's not uh it's not
[45:18] it's it's actually saying that they are
[45:20] not they have not come to the place
[45:22] to be able to articulate and understand
[45:25] and the bands of their tongue loose
[45:26] and to have knowledge and understand to
[45:28] speak plainly
[45:30] to speak clearly which the understanding
[45:33] relates to how how you speak and so he's
[45:37] saying they haven't they don't have a
[45:39] uh my goodness i i love how there's a
[45:42] draw
[45:42] to expound upon the subject that as we
[45:46] as we see things and as we experience
[45:48] things and the world becomes the child
[45:50] an infant's laboratory everything every
[45:53] day is an experiment
[45:55] and they're learning depth and they're
[45:56] learning hot and cold and they're
[45:58] learning what no means and
[46:00] and they instinctively just put
[46:01] everything in their mouth
[46:03] because that it's like that's their main
[46:04] feeler right
[46:06] they're just like i don't know about
[46:08] that
[46:09] they shake it they throw it down they're
[46:11] gaining this
[46:12] visual database and they're able to then
[46:15] move
[46:15] through the natural world and that's
[46:17] what happens for us as we begin to
[46:19] we're born again by the word of god we
[46:21] feed on the word of god
[46:24] listen to the voice of the messenger we
[46:25] read our bibles we're interacting with
[46:27] the word of god and we're we're taking
[46:29] it and we're understanding we're
[46:30] becoming more discernment i don't want
[46:32] to put that in my mouth that's not good
[46:33] i don't want to do this and then and
[46:35] there's a walking there's a growing
[46:36] there's an increasing that takes place
[46:38] in the word of god as we're feeding and
[46:39] this is the pattern that the child
[46:41] goes through to where at one time
[46:42] they're napios unable to speak but as
[46:44] you mature
[46:45] you come to a place ultimately what god
[46:47] wants to do is he wants
[46:49] his bride to speak clearly
[46:53] well she's the final voice of the final
[46:55] age and paul says that if i speak in an
[46:57] unknown tongue i become a barbarian
[47:00] so he doesn't just want his bride one
[47:02] blah blah blah blah blah blah
[47:04] he wants her to have a token language he
[47:07] wants her to speak a pure language he
[47:09] wants her to
[47:10] be able to articulate clearly the word
[47:12] of god speak with plainness
[47:13] because she prophesies again according
[47:16] to revelations
[47:16] 10 8 to 11. so the stammering lips
[47:20] another tongue brother branham says in
[47:22] the rapture in the days of the
[47:23] pentecostals
[47:25] the restoring back of the gifts the
[47:26] restoration of the gifts speaking in
[47:27] tongues casting out devils and the gifts
[47:29] so the days of the pentecostals the
[47:31] laodicean church age is
[47:33] the restoration of the gifts speaking in
[47:35] tongues
[47:36] and brother adam identifies uses this
[47:39] gift
[47:40] as like an identifier of the age
[47:42] speaking with tongues
[47:45] and it and it actually becomes so
[47:46] prominent
[47:48] it it starts their slide out of truth
[47:50] because they make it the evidence
[47:53] so isaiah chapter 28
[47:56] and joel 2 28 isaiah 28 11 joel 2 28
[48:00] i pour out my spirit upon all flesh this
[48:03] is restored
[48:05] in the laodicean church age this is
[48:07] restored to the church
[48:09] at the beginning of the age joel 2 28
[48:12] isaiah 28 11.
[48:14] so this the the gifts the the the cast
[48:17] sound of devils
[48:19] signs and wonders miracles speaking in
[48:22] tongues
[48:23] that's been put back in the church in
[48:25] the laodicean church age
[48:27] can you can you see that i know you've
[48:30] already been taught these things very
[48:31] well i'm looking out at
[48:32] a seasoned uh veterans of the message
[48:36] now brother branham says in the church
[48:38] age book the pentecostal age did not
[48:40] restore
[48:42] now that's that's an interesting
[48:45] statement
[48:46] and we realize that in one sense it
[48:49] didn't restore because what was restored
[48:51] it fell away from but it's also not a
[48:54] restoration
[48:55] because it's not the full restoration
[48:58] that god promised
[49:01] because there was more if brother
[49:03] branham said we have opportunities that
[49:05] saint paul never dreamed of having
[49:07] then restoration means more restoration
[49:10] points to more
[49:12] so when in the pentecostal age when the
[49:14] gifts are restored
[49:16] and when the baptist holds comes back
[49:17] into the church it is the last order of
[49:19] the reformation
[49:21] so then there's a mystery of restoration
[49:23] that points to a greater glory
[49:25] there's a mystery of restoration not
[49:27] just to where god wants to have a church
[49:29] back where it has the signs and wonders
[49:30] operating but whatever power and
[49:32] potential is
[49:33] in the church is actually realized where
[49:36] we realize the realization where the
[49:37] full potential is maximized we walk in
[49:39] the full
[49:40] fellowship of it so there is a order of
[49:42] reformation that comes in the laodicean
[49:44] church age and if there's anything lost
[49:46] that has to be added back
[49:47] but whatever it rep what was ever
[49:49] representing the restoration
[49:51] speaks that there still is more there's
[49:53] another rung on the ladder
[49:55] take one step higher up the ladder until
[49:59] and that's what's being expressed so the
[50:02] message
[50:03] a man that can turn on the light he says
[50:06] yesterday luther's manna would not work
[50:08] for methodist
[50:09] methodist manna would not work for
[50:10] pentecost pentecostal manna will not
[50:13] work for today
[50:16] now i think in the past i know
[50:19] maybe some years ago i made the mistake
[50:21] of not being too
[50:22] uh diligent to express that pentecostal
[50:27] in no way descr is descriptive or
[50:30] is not just descriptive of the manner in
[50:32] which someone worships
[50:34] you say ah pentecostal the pentecostal
[50:37] manna won't work for today
[50:39] and you think oh well that's just a an
[50:40] exuberant song service and a church that
[50:42] has drums or
[50:44] a really good syncopation in the music
[50:46] or a move of the spirit where people are
[50:47] dancing
[50:48] and we immediately just go to the type
[50:50] of songs that are seeing and the way the
[50:52] people worship and whether or not
[50:53] there's kind of dancing and emotion well
[50:56] that's not
[50:56] that's not the pentecostal brother man's
[50:58] talking about pentecostalism
[51:01] is not the way that you express worship
[51:04] it's not the manner in which song
[51:06] services are conducted or the atmosphere
[51:08] that people move in after the word goes
[51:11] forth but pentecostalism is the failure
[51:13] to walk
[51:14] further in the revealed word
[51:16] pentecostalism is not walking in the
[51:19] light
[51:20] that's what pentecostalism is so you
[51:22] could just find somebody who's
[51:23] just as dry cold and formal they don't
[51:26] even have an organ let alone drums
[51:29] and they can be just as pentecostals
[51:31] anybody else
[51:32] no tongues no laying on of hands uh know
[51:35] believing that the gifts are not only
[51:36] put on put on the shelf
[51:38] but they were sent back to the
[51:39] manufacturer
[51:41] and they could be just as pentecostal as
[51:43] the church that is wanting to exercise
[51:45] them over and over again it has a great
[51:47] a choir and everything's really
[51:48] exuberant and moving because
[51:49] pentecostalism is not the songs you sing
[51:52] or the way you worship it's failure to
[51:54] walk further
[51:55] in the light
[52:00] and it's connected with worship because
[52:01] you're not worshiping in truth
[52:04] but it's not just what we visually
[52:06] inspect ah they're they're really worked
[52:07] up they're just a bunch of pentecostals
[52:09] you could be judging inaccurately
[52:12] completely judging wrong because you
[52:15] just don't judge
[52:16] you don't judge something by how uh
[52:18] whether it's pentecostal by how they
[52:20] worship
[52:20] but what's the teaching what's the
[52:23] knowledge does it vary from the word
[52:26] and it's very instructive to then not
[52:29] just assume
[52:30] that if it is exuberant and charismatic
[52:33] and it's
[52:34] the rain is falling that number one
[52:37] that's a vindication of
[52:38] the doctrine or number two that their
[52:41] doctrine is correct
[52:42] or that this is something that uh is is
[52:45] not pentecostalism that this is what
[52:46] pentecost represents
[52:48] you've got to have discernment in this
[52:49] hour to know the difference
[52:52] so he says pentecostal manna will not
[52:54] work for today every day it come day by
[52:56] day fresh
[52:57] and so has it through the church ages
[53:01] luther's manna was the message of
[53:02] justification wesley's manna
[53:05] message was the manifestation of
[53:06] sanctification pentecostal
[53:09] was the restoration of the gifts
[53:12] so you have to recognize that these are
[53:15] church ages
[53:16] not just these men's messages and not
[53:20] just in
[53:20] age within the age these characterize
[53:22] the age itself
[53:25] luther wesley pentecost the pentecost
[53:27] being this laodicean age
[53:29] it was the restoration of the gifts he
[53:30] says but
[53:33] that's a change right this is the
[53:35] introducing
[53:36] of the headstone the last day the brine
[53:40] tree
[53:41] he says which is contrary to all of it
[53:43] and yet it's the same light for the
[53:44] matured
[53:46] why is it contrary to all of it because
[53:48] they cabbage down
[53:50] they stop they put a period and even the
[53:52] restoration against pentecost this last
[53:54] great move
[53:54] in laodicea they stop and refuse to walk
[53:58] further in the light
[53:59] he said so it seems to stand against all
[54:01] of it but it's the same light
[54:03] for the matured
[54:07] he said this is the introducing of the
[54:09] headstone if you look at the statue of a
[54:10] perfect man the lord of the sea and age
[54:12] is that seventh age
[54:13] but then there comes a move of the holy
[54:15] ghost to what introduce the headstone
[54:18] and where brother branham points us is
[54:20] not in the beginning of laodicea not
[54:21] even at the end of laodicea but
[54:23] something that happens at the same time
[54:25] that laodicea is going into chaos
[54:26] there is an introduction of the
[54:28] headstone
[54:30] the same light for the maturity
[54:34] an introduction of the headstone whom
[54:37] shall he teach knowledge
[54:39] for whom shall he make to understand
[54:41] doctrine
[54:42] the introduction of the headstone he
[54:44] says like the same sun shine today will
[54:46] be ripening the grain for the harvest in
[54:48] july
[54:49] and this is how we don't look back in a
[54:52] negative way at what happened in prior
[54:54] ages
[54:55] same holy spirit same light but it's
[54:58] advanced he says
[54:59] but that light won't today won't do any
[55:02] good back there in july
[55:03] it's stronger the wheat is more advanced
[55:07] it's ready to take it that's good amen
[55:12] touch somebody and say i'm ready to take
[55:13] it no don't we're social distancing
[55:19] but you can say that in your hearts you
[55:21] said i'm ready to take it
[55:23] well it's more advanced it's stronger
[55:25] the wheat is more advanced it's ready to
[55:26] take it certainly is
[55:27] they couldn't take it now it can
[55:31] then the season wasn't right then is now
[55:33] he says they couldn't take it then
[55:34] now is the time the season wasn't right
[55:37] then
[55:38] it is now so the sunlight is bright
[55:42] shining in its fullness at its peak in
[55:45] its greatest intensity so he's using the
[55:47] analogy of a harvest that if the
[55:48] sunlight shone in the intensity
[55:50] back in the beginning of the of the of
[55:52] the season
[55:53] like it is now it would burn it it would
[55:55] kill it up it wasn't ready but the
[55:57] church has matured to the place now
[56:00] through the opening of the word of god
[56:02] we can receive this intensity
[56:04] we can take it while we've come higher
[56:07] up the ladder
[56:09] it's stronger what is the light and the
[56:12] wheat
[56:14] it's more advanced it's ready to take it
[56:16] not just the sun but the wheat
[56:19] oh let's uh let's let's look at let's
[56:21] look into the word and say i can take it
[56:23] look at the floors that i can take i was
[56:25] made for this i was built for this
[56:30] my spiritual dna it can only
[56:33] be activated with this let it shine let
[56:36] it radiate let it come lord
[56:38] let the full force of the word hit me
[56:41] not because i'll wither not because i
[56:43] can be shaken but because i'm ready to
[56:45] take it
[56:46] the light is stronger but i'm more
[56:48] advanced
[56:50] praise the lord so
[56:53] then brother branham is identifying and
[56:55] maturing now
[56:57] to where it has been precept upon
[56:59] precept where it's now
[57:01] those who had stammering lips
[57:05] and the and the brother identifies the
[57:07] stammer lips as pentecost
[57:09] the day of pentecost joel 2 28 and this
[57:12] is restored in the laodicean church age
[57:15] there's a an advancement now now listen
[57:18] to what he says
[57:20] as about pentecost he's writing
[57:23] or he's preaching this actually when he
[57:25] preaches the thigh tire and church age
[57:26] he preaches the revelation of jesus
[57:28] christ
[57:29] and december of 1960 he says look at
[57:31] them cold and formal
[57:32] we don't have to talk about baptists and
[57:34] presbyterians
[57:36] we know they've been dead for years
[57:40] yeah and i guess that's true maybe we
[57:42] don't talk too much about presbyterians
[57:43] or baptists and
[57:44] not that we talk about them but brother
[57:46] ben i'm saying we're not
[57:48] we see that the life has moved on that
[57:50] they've denominated they've organized
[57:52] they deny certain things and they
[57:54] they're rejecting uh certain
[57:55] manifestations of the gift they're
[57:57] rejecting
[57:58] the liberty of the holy spirit that just
[58:00] lets me know how long i've been
[58:01] preaching when that thing fires up
[58:02] it's kind of like my own personal timer
[58:04] like it's not the blue screen of death
[58:06] just relax i'm still going but it's
[58:08] appropriate because that's what i want
[58:09] to start talking about is the death
[58:10] that's come to the church
[58:11] so thank you microsoft
[58:16] so he says we don't have to talk about
[58:18] the baptist and presbyterians he says
[58:20] they've been dead for
[58:21] years when luther had this his revival
[58:23] justification
[58:25] if he would have kept on this
[58:27] pentecostal great move now
[58:29] would have been the lutheran church if
[58:32] it just would have moved on the light
[58:35] would have come by
[58:36] sanctification had wesley followed in
[58:38] luther couldn't have followed that no
[58:40] sir they are already lutheran so then
[58:42] wesley come after wesley died
[58:44] then what happened they organized that
[58:46] and made wesley and methodist and all
[58:47] kinds of methodists
[58:48] had a great revival but when they
[58:50] throwed in the organization
[58:52] what happened then pentecostal come
[58:54] along
[58:55] speaking in tongues and bringing the
[58:57] restoration of the gifts
[58:59] what happened when pentecost come along
[59:01] speaking in tongues and bringing the
[59:02] restoration of the gifts they couldn't
[59:04] move
[59:04] westlands couldn't methodist couldn't
[59:06] called them devils
[59:09] so this is this is how it transpires the
[59:12] lutheran's called the west
[59:14] the methodist devils then the method is
[59:17] called the pentecostal devils
[59:18] and he says now what's pentecost done
[59:22] they the same the same thing
[59:25] they did and where are they
[59:28] at he says just as dead as a doornail
[59:34] who not the baptist not the
[59:36] presbyterians
[59:38] and i find that in the message sometimes
[59:40] those who uh
[59:41] um are you know brandomites they're
[59:45] baptocostals
[59:46] or penta baptists why because they take
[59:49] brother branham's baptist background
[59:51] and his pentecostal calling and they
[59:53] just become that
[59:55] but he says the baptists were dead as a
[59:56] door now and the pentecostals
[59:59] are just as dead as the door now and the
[1:00:02] scripture that brother adam uses to
[1:00:03] identify
[1:00:05] what transpired in the church age is
[1:00:07] revelations chapter 2
[1:00:09] verses 21 to 23.
[1:00:12] he says and i gave her space to repent
[1:00:14] of her fornication
[1:00:16] and she repented not behold i will cast
[1:00:20] her into a bed and this is the last
[1:00:21] thing he says before he stands at the
[1:00:22] door knocks revelation
[1:00:24] repent therefore repent but he says i i
[1:00:27] because she's given a space to repent
[1:00:29] and she does not
[1:00:30] think about the grace from the moment
[1:00:32] that brother branham's ministry begin
[1:00:35] and he preaches to the laodicean church
[1:00:37] age with signs and wonders think about
[1:00:39] that time revelations 3 19 that's going
[1:00:41] forward to the church up until the end
[1:00:43] of 62
[1:00:43] bible says it's the death of 62. what is
[1:00:46] it what do we find out in the indictment
[1:00:47] what do we see that unfolds later as his
[1:00:49] ministry progresses
[1:00:50] in the open of the word they're dead
[1:00:52] they're dead he was preaching repentance
[1:00:54] and because they did not repent
[1:00:57] he says i will cast her into a bed and
[1:00:59] them that commit adultery with her
[1:01:01] into great tribulation except they
[1:01:03] repent of their deeds and i will
[1:01:04] kill her children with death
[1:01:08] and burden identifies the deadness of
[1:01:10] the church
[1:01:11] and the deadness of laodicea the
[1:01:13] deadness of pentecost is this scripture
[1:01:15] being fulfilled
[1:01:16] though it may be expressed in another
[1:01:18] age and to another church
[1:01:20] it's being spoken to the whole church of
[1:01:22] all the ages
[1:01:23] i will cast her into a bed and i will
[1:01:25] kill her children with death
[1:01:28] so the church the laodicean church the
[1:01:31] church
[1:01:32] is dead as a door now at the death of
[1:01:34] 62.
[1:01:36] and program says unspoken word is the
[1:01:38] original seed every man no matter
[1:01:39] whether he's the pulp priest bishop or
[1:01:41] whatever he is
[1:01:42] he dies because he's a hybrid
[1:01:45] that's exactly he was born between satan
[1:01:48] and eve every man was born between
[1:01:52] satan and eve i know that's a that's a
[1:01:54] weighty statement
[1:01:55] very very difficult but it's the truth
[1:01:57] he says call it whatever you want it was
[1:01:58] satan and eve
[1:01:59] the original word had nothing to do with
[1:02:01] it
[1:02:02] the original word was life by the time
[1:02:04] you're doing a good job you're picking
[1:02:05] the right songs
[1:02:07] the original word had nothing to do with
[1:02:08] the original word was life now why does
[1:02:11] man die
[1:02:12] because the original is hybrid so if
[1:02:14] there's death and label to see it that
[1:02:16] means the word has been hybrid
[1:02:17] he's hybrid and brought death and when
[1:02:19] the church today that's called
[1:02:21] themselves pentecostals called them
[1:02:23] baptists whatever they want to
[1:02:24] when they hybrid this word with dogma it
[1:02:27] produces a dead child
[1:02:29] she can't have no life in her she's dead
[1:02:32] and her children are dead
[1:02:34] she the church she laodicea
[1:02:38] are dead and therefore they have
[1:02:40] stillborn children
[1:02:42] they cannot bring forth there is
[1:02:45] no life in them amen
[1:02:49] that's what the message teaches us there
[1:02:51] is no more
[1:02:53] life in them now i i may be this may be
[1:02:56] a supposition on my part i may be
[1:02:58] speculating
[1:03:00] but i feel this is just a spiritual
[1:03:02] logic like we're just using
[1:03:04] a a reasonable faith if there could be
[1:03:07] life
[1:03:08] in them then we can stay in them
[1:03:14] if there's still life in them we could
[1:03:15] stay in them
[1:03:17] but brother branham plainly called us
[1:03:19] out of them
[1:03:21] out of denomination out of organization
[1:03:23] and this represents a dramatic shift and
[1:03:25] the indictment just nails it down
[1:03:27] at one time you could be in the baptist
[1:03:29] church at one time you could be in the
[1:03:31] upc church
[1:03:32] at one time you could be in any
[1:03:33] different church why god was using the
[1:03:35] system
[1:03:37] and god was using men of god and
[1:03:39] organization and denominations
[1:03:41] and people were coming to birth in
[1:03:43] pentecostal but listen
[1:03:44] there's something that transpires in the
[1:03:47] birth of 63.
[1:03:49] something that takes place where now
[1:03:51] revelations 18 4
[1:03:52] is clear and distinct come out from
[1:03:55] among them there
[1:03:56] is no more life in them and so there has
[1:03:59] to be a transformation there has to be a
[1:04:02] moving on beyond it in order to come to
[1:04:04] a birth
[1:04:05] you have to come out of it otherwise you
[1:04:06] could be birthed in it and you can stay
[1:04:08] in it
[1:04:11] so this is i want to read a lengthy
[1:04:13] statement to you
[1:04:16] i didn't even look at what time we
[1:04:17] started he says now there's a and this
[1:04:20] is there's a man here that can turn on
[1:04:21] the light
[1:04:23] and you could go look at these sermons
[1:04:24] there's a man here that can turn on the
[1:04:25] light
[1:04:26] and then um and shalom
[1:04:29] and in these different sermons he
[1:04:31] preaches at the end of 63 in the
[1:04:32] beginning of 64 and these
[1:04:34] themes are repeated over and over again
[1:04:36] he says he was the word made light or
[1:04:38] became light
[1:04:39] so the word became light the word in
[1:04:42] that generation he was the word
[1:04:44] light of that generation because the
[1:04:46] prophets of old had spoke of him
[1:04:48] and here he come and vindicated he was
[1:04:49] the light of god spoken word all the
[1:04:51] prophets had said
[1:04:52] had been fulfilled in him the prophets
[1:04:54] back here
[1:04:55] with the word so all those scriptures
[1:05:00] that pertain to him when he came
[1:05:02] that word became light because he's the
[1:05:04] manifestation of it
[1:05:06] now he says all the prophets that have
[1:05:07] been spoken of him are fulfilled in him
[1:05:10] but they're still a mystery as he had
[1:05:11] declared to his servants the prophets
[1:05:13] that's held for this day that's the
[1:05:14] finishing
[1:05:16] so christ is the beginning of that
[1:05:17] mystery but there must be a finishing of
[1:05:19] that mystery
[1:05:20] he said like god was at the beginning so
[1:05:22] now he's drawn the parallel
[1:05:24] to christ in his day to the beginning
[1:05:27] when god said
[1:05:28] let there be light and light came now
[1:05:30] the prophet said a virgin shall conceive
[1:05:31] bring forth a son
[1:05:32] they shall call his name emmanuel for to
[1:05:34] be god with us now they had spoke it
[1:05:36] the word had went out but he was the
[1:05:38] light what was he
[1:05:40] the fulfillment so what's light
[1:05:42] fulfillment
[1:05:45] the prophecy when it's uttered is not
[1:05:48] the light
[1:05:50] the fulfillment is the light the prophet
[1:05:53] as he prophesies
[1:05:54] is not the light the fulfillment is the
[1:05:57] light
[1:05:59] so you cannot say there will be light
[1:06:02] one day and that be light
[1:06:05] that light that word becomes light when
[1:06:07] it's manifested when it's fulfilled so
[1:06:09] whatever's being fulfilled is the light
[1:06:10] for that day that's how it wasn't luther
[1:06:11] wesley and pentecost
[1:06:13] the fulfillment is light he was the
[1:06:14] fulfillment of that word he was the
[1:06:16] manifestation of that word
[1:06:18] so is it today god's word
[1:06:21] has been fulfilled at the hour that's
[1:06:24] the light it's god manifesting himself
[1:06:28] amen just as it was at the beginning
[1:06:32] just as it was at the beginning of the
[1:06:33] creation of god these are the parallels
[1:06:34] we've been bringing up over and over
[1:06:36] in the beginning god then in the days of
[1:06:39] christ
[1:06:39] it brings it up again in the beginning
[1:06:41] of the creation of god christ is now
[1:06:43] following that pattern and now here we
[1:06:44] are today
[1:06:45] god's word has been fulfilled at the
[1:06:47] hour that's the light
[1:06:48] god manifested himself he was the light
[1:06:50] of the world
[1:06:51] christ was and when the prophets
[1:06:53] inspired by the holy ghost said unto us
[1:06:54] a child is born
[1:06:55] unto us a son is given a child is given
[1:06:58] his name shall be counselor prince of
[1:06:59] peace mighty god everlasting father
[1:07:01] there it was what was he the light that
[1:07:04] fulfilled that word
[1:07:05] the light that fulfilled that word in
[1:07:08] matthew 28 we find when jesus was raised
[1:07:10] from the dead
[1:07:11] he was also the light of the spoken word
[1:07:14] of david
[1:07:15] i'll not leave his soul in hell neither
[1:07:16] will i suffer my holy one to see
[1:07:18] corruption
[1:07:19] what's the light when the scripture's
[1:07:21] made manifest
[1:07:23] when the prophecy is being fulfilled so
[1:07:25] he says death was in darkness
[1:07:27] but he opened the seals of death
[1:07:31] and walked into it and come back out
[1:07:33] again he was the light the vindicated
[1:07:35] word that the dead can live
[1:07:37] after they are dead all right so this is
[1:07:40] what it stands for
[1:07:42] christ being the first fruits
[1:07:45] born again from the dead as he is now
[1:07:46] the first fruits of the resurrection
[1:07:48] as he is now himself identifying
[1:07:52] that the dead can live that they are
[1:07:53] dead the light of god's word
[1:07:56] vindicating that the dead can live after
[1:07:58] death
[1:07:59] he was on the day of pentecost that was
[1:08:02] the light that showed when the holy
[1:08:03] ghost came
[1:08:04] isaiah said in the 20th chapter precept
[1:08:06] must be upon precept line upon line hear
[1:08:08] a little and they're little hold fast to
[1:08:10] that which is good
[1:08:11] for with stammery lips and other tongues
[1:08:12] will i speak to this people
[1:08:14] and this is the rest this is the sabbath
[1:08:16] that i'll give so now he identifies
[1:08:17] isaiah 28
[1:08:18] the verses that we read verses 9 to 11
[1:08:21] verses 8 to
[1:08:22] 10 to 11 as the outpouring of the day of
[1:08:25] pentecost
[1:08:26] he says and this is the rest and
[1:08:29] all they would not hear walked away they
[1:08:32] wagged their heads and when the day of
[1:08:33] pentecost when the holy ghost fell upon
[1:08:35] those people
[1:08:35] they acted like drunk men and women
[1:08:37] staggering upon the impact of the holy
[1:08:38] spirit
[1:08:39] they walked away and wagged their heads
[1:08:40] and said this people is drunk full of
[1:08:42] new wine and so forth
[1:08:44] it absolutely was the light the word
[1:08:47] that had been prophesied made manifested
[1:08:50] so is it in every age
[1:08:53] so as the light was made manifest on the
[1:08:56] day of pentecost and that's the word
[1:08:58] made manifest is light so is it in every
[1:09:00] age the word made manifest come to life
[1:09:03] is the light of that age there the word
[1:09:05] made manifest
[1:09:07] just like it was in genesis 1 when god
[1:09:10] said let there be light and there was
[1:09:12] light
[1:09:12] when god said there will be a sun and
[1:09:15] there was the sun
[1:09:17] so then what is the light for today
[1:09:22] if he says it has to be in every age
[1:09:24] what is the light for today
[1:09:26] and he's he says he keeps pointing to
[1:09:28] the beginning in the beginning he said
[1:09:30] let there be light then he said there
[1:09:31] would be a sign and there was a son
[1:09:32] he's saying s-o in so he keeps pointing
[1:09:35] to the beginning
[1:09:37] and and i i believe that he does this
[1:09:41] because that's the true restoration
[1:09:43] point
[1:09:45] he does this because we are restored
[1:09:48] back
[1:09:49] to the church as it was on the day of
[1:09:50] pentecost and that was
[1:09:53] reflected in the restoration of the
[1:09:56] gifts the last order
[1:09:57] reformation brings back the leaves it
[1:09:59] brings back the fruit
[1:10:00] everything's been brought back in that
[1:10:02] but yet there's still one part that was
[1:10:04] lacking
[1:10:05] and that can only be seen in the
[1:10:07] potential that is expressed
[1:10:08] in the garden of eden in the beginning
[1:10:12] because brother brown says in the bride
[1:10:13] will be fulfilled all that was promised
[1:10:16] to be made manifest all that was
[1:10:17] promised of god to be made manifest in
[1:10:19] the virgin
[1:10:20] so the woman that fell in eden the woman
[1:10:22] that fell after the day of pentecost
[1:10:24] the bride does not fall why it's very
[1:10:28] simple why she doesn't
[1:10:30] you are ordained not to it's
[1:10:33] just that simple you don't come up with
[1:10:36] any other reason
[1:10:37] well the reason why i won't fail is
[1:10:39] because i can do this and i can do that
[1:10:41] and i believe this i believe the seals
[1:10:42] are open and i believe this
[1:10:43] listen god ordained you not to
[1:10:46] he has predestinated you not to fail
[1:10:49] therefore
[1:10:51] you can take it i'm more advanced by his
[1:10:54] election by his predestination
[1:10:56] this is something that i can take you're
[1:10:58] elected to do it
[1:11:00] so he keeps pointing to a time or he's
[1:11:03] he's pointing to the beginning for us to
[1:11:05] understand our age
[1:11:06] because once again we're just like it
[1:11:08] was in the beginning darkness
[1:11:10] death obscurity and god speaks and
[1:11:13] there's light
[1:11:15] so in isaiah chapter 32 verses 3 to 3
[1:11:18] and 4
[1:11:19] and the eyes of them that shall see the
[1:11:22] eyes of them that see
[1:11:23] shall not be dim so they that have eyes
[1:11:26] to see
[1:11:27] they will not be dim and the ears of
[1:11:29] them that hear shall hearken
[1:11:31] so not all ears will hear no i all eyes
[1:11:33] will see but he that have
[1:11:35] eyes to see and ears to hear
[1:11:38] because some ears are dull some eyes are
[1:11:41] dim and they can't see
[1:11:43] see and they see not hearing they hear
[1:11:44] not but there are people who are
[1:11:46] possessed with the quality
[1:11:47] the eyes of them that see that means you
[1:11:49] have an eye that can see
[1:11:51] it will not be dim the ear that can hear
[1:11:54] it will hear so if something had been
[1:11:57] hid
[1:11:58] it'll be shown to you and because you
[1:12:00] have eyes to see you'll see it when it's
[1:12:01] made manifest
[1:12:03] what was not speaking before you had an
[1:12:05] ear to hear but yet it was not speaking
[1:12:07] and when it speaks you'll hear
[1:12:08] why because it's given unto you to know
[1:12:11] you have ears to hear you have eyes to
[1:12:13] see
[1:12:14] and you cannot see it unless it's made
[1:12:16] manifest you cannot hear it unless it
[1:12:17] speaks
[1:12:19] oh that's why i inspire you as the
[1:12:21] church of god
[1:12:22] to live the life to speak the word so
[1:12:24] that others may see and hear
[1:12:26] the reason why that person you know is
[1:12:28] stumbling around in darkness
[1:12:29] is because they have not yet heard the
[1:12:31] voice they have not yet seen the light
[1:12:33] and you are the voice you are the light
[1:12:36] not don't judge them because of their
[1:12:37] outward appearance and their
[1:12:38] circumstance
[1:12:39] they have an ear to hear they just need
[1:12:41] the word to be spoken
[1:12:42] they have eyes to say it was given to
[1:12:44] them by god they just need the light to
[1:12:48] shine
[1:12:50] and we hide our light when we walk by
[1:12:51] saying oh my goodness can you believe
[1:12:54] that sister
[1:12:55] and we just hide our light
[1:12:58] she's getting what she deserves when
[1:13:01] really what she needs is someone to let
[1:13:02] it shine
[1:13:05] and she's like i i've never seen this
[1:13:07] before
[1:13:09] i've never heard this before all along
[1:13:11] she had an ear to here
[1:13:13] all along she had eyes to see but
[1:13:15] something got in the way
[1:13:17] of the sun and the earth began to black
[1:13:20] it out
[1:13:21] but then god in this end time has set a
[1:13:23] city upon a hill
[1:13:25] for the purpose of salvation
[1:13:28] and he says the eyes of them that shall
[1:13:30] see shall not be dim and the ears of
[1:13:31] them that here shall hearken
[1:13:33] the heart also of the rash the expectant
[1:13:36] the scripture in the new testament talks
[1:13:37] about those who are looking those who
[1:13:39] are anticipating those are expecting
[1:13:40] shall understand knowledge remember the
[1:13:42] question unto whom
[1:13:44] unto whom shall i teach knowledge unto
[1:13:48] whom shall i make
[1:13:49] to understand doctrine now it's coming
[1:13:51] the heart of the rashford the expected
[1:13:52] shall understand knowledge
[1:13:54] and the tongue knows the dispensational
[1:13:56] change and the tongue of the stammerers
[1:13:58] shall be ready to speak plainly
[1:14:03] i expected a big ring man
[1:14:07] the the the tongues the stamina the
[1:14:09] other tongues of pentecost
[1:14:11] it's a move of god because that's where
[1:14:13] the light of god was
[1:14:14] but there's still a dimness there's
[1:14:17] still a lacking there's still in part
[1:14:19] paul even teaches that brother branham
[1:14:20] even shows it but then there's a time
[1:14:22] when the full word is going to be
[1:14:24] unveiled there's a time when the full
[1:14:25] light is going to be shining
[1:14:26] and the heart of the rash the expectant
[1:14:28] once they understand knowledge once this
[1:14:30] doctrine is taught
[1:14:31] once the teaching comes once the full
[1:14:33] word is born into manifestation
[1:14:35] the tongues that once stammered are now
[1:14:37] loose to speak plainly
[1:14:40] it represents a change from pentecost
[1:14:43] to perfection from laodicea to bride
[1:14:50] the tongue of the stammers is ready to
[1:14:52] speak plainly brother says in the
[1:14:53] invisible under the bride of christ
[1:14:54] and yes certainly this uh this quote can
[1:14:57] be misused but he says the word that
[1:14:59] fell on the day of pentecost
[1:15:00] will not work this day that was for
[1:15:03] pentecost
[1:15:07] that means there's got to be something
[1:15:09] added to it
[1:15:11] or something more advanced something has
[1:15:14] to open up upon those shoulders
[1:15:17] what did he identify pentecost as the
[1:15:19] lips the tongues the layout of the scene
[1:15:20] age it was
[1:15:21] in the lips right but he says we're in
[1:15:23] the eye
[1:15:25] intelligence headship that's where we've
[1:15:27] come
[1:15:28] it says the word that from the day of
[1:15:29] pentecost will not will not work this
[1:15:31] day
[1:15:33] that was for pentecost this is for the
[1:15:35] bride going home of the bride
[1:15:38] we got something different the
[1:15:41] pentecostals represented that again
[1:15:44] laodicea represented that again
[1:15:47] in a last order of reformation in a
[1:15:49] godly way in a divine way not in a
[1:15:52] an unrighteous way in a powerful way
[1:15:55] if they aren't who they were we can't be
[1:15:57] bride
[1:15:59] if they weren't pentecostal then we have
[1:16:01] to be the pentecostals and it's not
[1:16:03] going home time yet
[1:16:06] if we follow the message teaching he
[1:16:09] says this is for the going home of the
[1:16:11] bride
[1:16:11] if we are the true pentecostals and
[1:16:14] those in the beginning of laodicea
[1:16:15] weren't
[1:16:16] then we're still waiting for something
[1:16:18] else to happen
[1:16:19] for it to be rapture season for it to be
[1:16:21] harvest time
[1:16:23] and i would say we have grossly grossly
[1:16:25] misunderstood the message
[1:16:28] because brother braham is clearly i
[1:16:29] orient in us we are in the brightest the
[1:16:31] pentecostals represented again we are in
[1:16:33] the bright age no more than the word of
[1:16:34] noah would have worked in the day of
[1:16:35] moses
[1:16:36] no more than moses's law would have
[1:16:37] worked in the time of paul he tried to
[1:16:39] tell him you were dead to that you
[1:16:40] cannot have it
[1:16:42] paul told them you are dead to that you
[1:16:44] cannot have it if i can say it another
[1:16:46] way it's dead
[1:16:47] to you it's not yours it's dead that's
[1:16:50] not where the life is don't reach back
[1:16:52] and grab it
[1:16:53] whatever benefit whatever power whatever
[1:16:55] promise whatever potential
[1:16:57] was in it is in the present truth so you
[1:16:59] don't have to go to something in the
[1:17:01] past to get it
[1:17:02] if you want blessing if you want gifts
[1:17:04] if you want power
[1:17:05] if you want true worship if you want a
[1:17:07] move of god find it in the revealed word
[1:17:10] find it in the present truth it's there
[1:17:14] if people who've used the language of
[1:17:15] the present truth people who use the
[1:17:17] language of the open of the word
[1:17:18] didn't have it following it's because
[1:17:20] man took it out and it's a form and a
[1:17:22] semblance
[1:17:23] but where the word of god is there's
[1:17:25] worship where the open of the word is
[1:17:27] there's healing
[1:17:27] where the power of god is present
[1:17:29] there's manifestations
[1:17:32] man's the one that would take them out
[1:17:34] man's the one that would make a mockery
[1:17:36] of it
[1:17:37] so if we want it don't reach back to
[1:17:39] something in the past to have it
[1:17:40] stay in the word and let me tell you the
[1:17:44] devil sure tries to beat you up and
[1:17:45] bully you
[1:17:47] to reach back but don't do it
[1:17:52] brother braham says in the third seal we
[1:17:54] have denominational revivals but we've
[1:17:55] had no real stirring
[1:17:57] no no no no no sir
[1:18:00] don't think we've got revivals we
[1:18:03] haven't
[1:18:04] oh they've got millions and millions of
[1:18:06] church members but not wearing revival
[1:18:08] nowhere
[1:18:09] no no seven knows perfect
[1:18:14] right we've had denominational revivals
[1:18:16] we haven't had a real stirring no no no
[1:18:18] no sir no and then he says it again not
[1:18:20] a revival nowhere
[1:18:21] no no because we've had many churches
[1:18:24] churches brides brides churches brides
[1:18:26] but there must come
[1:18:29] one so he says the bride hasn't had a
[1:18:32] revival yet
[1:18:35] there's been no revival there now
[1:18:36] there's been church revivals
[1:18:38] church age revivals but now i i just
[1:18:41] noticed this
[1:18:42] it's march 3rd march 20th
[1:18:46] of 1963. revelations 3 20 behold i stand
[1:18:49] at the door knock
[1:18:50] now brother branham don't make anything
[1:18:52] out of that it's just brother bam
[1:18:54] standing there
[1:18:56] and he says the bride hasn't had a
[1:18:57] revival yet there's been no revival
[1:18:59] there
[1:19:00] no manifestation of god disturbed the
[1:19:02] bride yet
[1:19:04] the church in each age has been stirred
[1:19:06] but a bride's revival hasn't happened
[1:19:09] yet
[1:19:10] so he says we're looking for it what is
[1:19:12] it then
[1:19:13] it'll take those seven unknown thunders
[1:19:15] back there to wake her up again
[1:19:18] he will send it he promised it
[1:19:21] so what is the bride's revival the open
[1:19:23] of the seven seals
[1:19:24] where's the bride's revival the
[1:19:26] revelation of the seven thunders
[1:19:28] so he resets he says where he promised
[1:19:30] it watch
[1:19:31] she was dead so the prophet gives the
[1:19:36] prognosis
[1:19:37] he says she is dead and what it's going
[1:19:40] to take to revive her
[1:19:42] is the revelation of the seven unknown
[1:19:43] thunders that's going to bring life into
[1:19:46] the bride
[1:19:46] so at the beginning of 1963 the church
[1:19:50] is dead this is the condition of the
[1:19:51] odyssey in church what is going to
[1:19:53] revive her
[1:19:54] it's going to take life the seven
[1:19:57] unknown thunders to wake her up and in
[1:19:59] the message
[1:20:00] he cares do you care he says we're at
[1:20:02] the end
[1:20:03] and we see we're at the end there's not
[1:20:06] no way to build upon that corruption
[1:20:08] how can we build a city upon the charred
[1:20:10] ruins
[1:20:11] of the sodom and gomorrah how can we do
[1:20:14] it
[1:20:16] man he cares do you care
[1:20:20] july 24th first 1963
[1:20:23] how can we build a city upon the charred
[1:20:26] ruins of sodom and gomorrah
[1:20:29] how can we do it and then he says this
[1:20:33] there's only one phoenix left
[1:20:37] and that's the coming to the lord jesus
[1:20:41] he says you can't build on charred ruins
[1:20:42] but he says there's another phoenix
[1:20:45] what is he referring to well you could
[1:20:46] say in mythology it was this bird
[1:20:48] that could regenerate itself from ashes
[1:20:51] it's symbolized by the sun do we not
[1:20:53] call phoenix this area the valley of the
[1:20:55] sun
[1:20:57] the very symbols for the city of phoenix
[1:20:59] and that bird it's it's sun
[1:21:00] it's fire and in the mythology this
[1:21:03] phoenix
[1:21:05] obtained new life by rising from the
[1:21:08] ashes of its predecessor
[1:21:11] so laodicea is and ashes laodicea is in
[1:21:15] ruins
[1:21:16] and the prophet says how can we build
[1:21:18] upon charred ruins
[1:21:20] how can there be how can there be
[1:21:22] anything he says but there is
[1:21:23] one phoenix left there is still yet
[1:21:27] arising
[1:21:28] of the sun even though there's ashes
[1:21:31] even though there's ruins
[1:21:32] there is another one there is another
[1:21:36] rising of the sun
[1:21:37] god is going to build up through the
[1:21:39] ashes and he says and i am the
[1:21:41] resurrection and the life he says
[1:21:42] gracious god great eternal jehovah
[1:21:45] who moved upon the waters and said let
[1:21:46] there be light you who spoke the world
[1:21:49] into existence
[1:21:50] by your word has promised by that same
[1:21:52] word
[1:21:53] that we shall rise again
[1:21:56] true words of these could be spoken at a
[1:21:58] funeral service these words could be
[1:22:00] spoken about they which are
[1:22:02] uh that go before us and those that
[1:22:04] sleep but it's
[1:22:05] also spoken in this last days over the
[1:22:07] charred ruins of laodicea
[1:22:09] there was another phoenix left it is the
[1:22:12] rising of the sun
[1:22:13] the same word that said let there be
[1:22:15] light in the beginning has spoken again
[1:22:18] and we have risen risen out of the
[1:22:21] charred ruins
[1:22:23] branham says and it is the rising of the
[1:22:25] sun he says who is the son of man
[1:22:27] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:22:29] word was with god and the word was god
[1:22:31] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:22:32] among us and if all the teaching that we
[1:22:35] have and the confirmation of the word of
[1:22:37] god
[1:22:37] by god signs and wonders we see today
[1:22:40] that the book of luke 17 30
[1:22:42] and malachi 4. this is what he's looking
[1:22:44] at luke 17 30 the coming of the son of
[1:22:46] man
[1:22:47] malachi 4 the forerunner of the messiah
[1:22:49] the different scriptures that we are
[1:22:50] acquainted with
[1:22:51] that that word is again waved over the
[1:22:53] people the dead traditions of man is
[1:22:56] dead
[1:22:56] and the son of god is alive again with
[1:22:59] the baptism of the holy spirit right
[1:23:00] among us giving us life
[1:23:02] as christ was the first one to raise
[1:23:04] from all the prophets because he
[1:23:06] is the light the vindicated word that
[1:23:08] the dead can live after they are dead
[1:23:12] so why is it waved it's waved over ashes
[1:23:15] seemingly why he's waved christ is the
[1:23:18] sheaf wave
[1:23:20] he's the word that's waved over the
[1:23:21] people a prophet there
[1:23:23] with the loaf waving it over the people
[1:23:26] showing what it's going to come there's
[1:23:27] more to come to maturity
[1:23:28] he's the sheath wave which is the
[1:23:31] evidence of the resurrection which is
[1:23:32] the evidence of the harvest which is the
[1:23:34] evidence of more seed to come to
[1:23:35] maturity
[1:23:36] it's the phoenix oh praise the lord
[1:23:40] he says he was the first fruits of those
[1:23:42] that slept in the bride coming of christ
[1:23:47] in the bride coming of christ coming out
[1:23:50] of the church now
[1:23:51] no matter how you want to diagram this
[1:23:52] no matter where you want to put the
[1:23:53] comma i believe it all says the same
[1:23:55] thing
[1:23:56] his first coming was a bride coming
[1:23:59] because he came to
[1:24:00] purchase his bride he came to pay the
[1:24:03] price of redemption he came to redeemer
[1:24:05] the second coming he comes to receive
[1:24:07] his bride
[1:24:08] his third coming is with his bride
[1:24:11] they're all bride comings
[1:24:13] the first coming was a word coming
[1:24:17] was it not the word that came to john
[1:24:18] the baptist
[1:24:20] it was the word coming the second coming
[1:24:21] is a word coming
[1:24:24] the third coming which is what most
[1:24:25] people look to brother i said will be a
[1:24:27] word coming so don't let anybody use a
[1:24:30] language that tries to diminish the
[1:24:31] power of what you've received in this
[1:24:33] hour
[1:24:35] if it says in the bride coming out of
[1:24:37] the church
[1:24:38] or if you want to say in the bride
[1:24:40] christ coming in the bride
[1:24:42] or in the bride coming of christ however
[1:24:45] you want to look at it
[1:24:46] this is fulfilled in this hour this time
[1:24:49] the coming of christ in his bride or the
[1:24:51] bride coming to christ
[1:24:52] they'll have to be a sheep wave again in
[1:24:54] the last days why it was there in the
[1:24:56] first age
[1:24:57] first time waving of the sheaf the first
[1:24:59] one that come to maturity
[1:25:00] the first one to prove that it was wheat
[1:25:02] proved it was a sheaf i'm sure you see
[1:25:04] what i'm talking about
[1:25:06] it was waved over the people i know
[1:25:08] you're familiar with this
[1:25:09] he says that for the first time will
[1:25:11] come forth for the bright age
[1:25:13] for a resurrection out of dark
[1:25:16] denominationalism
[1:25:18] there is another phoenix left it is the
[1:25:21] coming
[1:25:21] the bride coming of christ christ coming
[1:25:24] in his bride
[1:25:25] for a resurrection out of dark
[1:25:26] denominationalism will be a message
[1:25:28] that the full maturity of the word has
[1:25:30] turned back again
[1:25:31] in its full power being waved over the
[1:25:34] people by the same signs and wonders
[1:25:36] that he did back there
[1:25:38] because i live ye live also speaking to
[1:25:40] his
[1:25:41] wife not to the church the bride his
[1:25:44] wife
[1:25:45] because i live you live also what a
[1:25:46] resurrection that was finish it with me
[1:25:49] and what a resurrection this is to be
[1:25:52] quickened from the dead
[1:25:55] oh there was one more phoenix left
[1:25:59] oh hallelujah there has been a rising
[1:26:01] from the ashes
[1:26:03] arising even from the ashes of our
[1:26:05] predecessor she has risen upon the scene
[1:26:07] but everybody said she
[1:26:09] is risen
[1:26:12] what a resurrection this is to be
[1:26:13] quickened from the dead to be made alive
[1:26:15] in christ jesus
[1:26:16] by god's quickening power
[1:26:19] we've been raised up from the ashes of
[1:26:20] laodicea
[1:26:23] we've been raised up from the ashes of
[1:26:24] denominationalism
[1:26:26] we've been raised up from the ashes of
[1:26:27] false doctrines
[1:26:29] and that's why the devil is howling
[1:26:32] that's why the devil hates it
[1:26:34] when bread and christ is the mystery god
[1:26:36] revealed begins to talk about the devil
[1:26:37] howling
[1:26:38] he's howling at the the revealed truth
[1:26:40] the manifestation of this truth
[1:26:42] is in her and her alone he hates that
[1:26:45] he hates that this truth is manifested
[1:26:47] in the bride and the bride alone
[1:26:49] he can't stand it so all hell the devil
[1:26:51] is howling
[1:26:52] against it and he says
[1:26:56] about the devil howl and he says she is
[1:26:58] now risen by the power
[1:27:00] of the vindicated word promised to her
[1:27:04] what is he what is he howling against
[1:27:06] that she is now risen
[1:27:10] and let me find let me find an
[1:27:13] appropriate place to stop here
[1:27:17] i'd at least like to get to my text
[1:27:23] i don't like it when that happens and i
[1:27:24] don't get there i'm like why did i even
[1:27:26] have that
[1:27:27] why did i even have that there but
[1:27:29] brother brown makes a statement and go
[1:27:31] awake
[1:27:31] jesus and brother in one place said that
[1:27:35] pentecost has not recognized the
[1:27:36] awakening of the bride
[1:27:39] and who is he trying to awaken he that
[1:27:41] is in you
[1:27:43] he that is in in the right he that is in
[1:27:45] he that is in the ship wake him up
[1:27:46] so he's trying to awaken not jesus as
[1:27:49] the third person
[1:27:50] out there but awaken the christ in the
[1:27:51] bride he's trying to awaken the bride
[1:27:54] and he makes this statement there's more
[1:27:55] to the ministry than divine healing
[1:27:57] and he says the sickest body i know of
[1:27:59] tonight is the so-called body of jesus
[1:28:00] christ
[1:28:02] he says it needs spiritual healing and
[1:28:05] this quote
[1:28:06] is often used in present day language to
[1:28:10] suggest
[1:28:11] that the bride is still the sickest body
[1:28:12] there is
[1:28:15] and i've seen it used so that the person
[1:28:17] quoting it makes themselves relevant
[1:28:21] because you've got to come to me for
[1:28:22] healing but broadband said there's more
[1:28:25] to the ministry his ministry than divine
[1:28:27] healing he's saying
[1:28:28] there's spiritual healing divine healing
[1:28:31] can touch everyone
[1:28:33] divine healing is to anyone who will
[1:28:34] come up in a prayer line who will
[1:28:35] believe who can have their hands laid on
[1:28:37] them
[1:28:37] that that's for everyone but the sickest
[1:28:40] body i know is the spiritual body of
[1:28:42] christ
[1:28:42] he's saying there's more to my ministry
[1:28:44] than laying hands on the sick
[1:28:46] in the physical body recovering my
[1:28:48] ministry is to heal
[1:28:49] that sick body so he says it needs
[1:28:52] spiritual healing there's only one bomb
[1:28:54] that i know of that will heal that's the
[1:28:55] word
[1:28:56] and that's the body that we want to
[1:28:58] stand up
[1:28:59] in the strength and vitamin power of the
[1:29:01] gospel and that's why i use much of the
[1:29:04] time now
[1:29:04] is trying to strengthen the church by
[1:29:07] the word
[1:29:09] oh they may have wanted more prayer
[1:29:10] lines they may have wanted more signs
[1:29:12] and wonders
[1:29:13] of healings and manifestations but he
[1:29:15] says i'm spending more time in the word
[1:29:18] why because there's more to this
[1:29:19] ministry than prayer lines
[1:29:21] and laying hands on the sick but i have
[1:29:23] a ministry to heal the body of christ
[1:29:25] with the vitamin power of the word of
[1:29:27] god so i want to strengthen the church
[1:29:29] by the word
[1:29:30] and i say he has done it
[1:29:35] the bride of christ is no longer the
[1:29:37] sickest body on the face of the earth
[1:29:39] as he says it november 30th 1963 i
[1:29:42] believe when he came to that definitive
[1:29:43] place that he now knew what the third
[1:29:45] pull was
[1:29:46] it was the open of those seven seals not
[1:29:48] just an instance in which someone gets
[1:29:50] all riled up and speaks something
[1:29:51] and create something in this end time
[1:29:53] but then the third pull had come
[1:29:55] into full manifestation it was the
[1:29:58] opening of those seven seals
[1:29:59] the revealing of those seven thunders so
[1:30:02] he says that's why i spend my time
[1:30:04] in the word is because i want them to
[1:30:06] stand up
[1:30:09] why he was fulfilling malachi 4 2. but
[1:30:12] unto you that fear my name shall the sun
[1:30:14] essent of righteousness arise with
[1:30:16] healing in his wings
[1:30:18] and ye shall go forth and grow up as
[1:30:20] calves of the stall
[1:30:22] you've matured now whereas calves are in
[1:30:25] a stall
[1:30:25] but now it's ready to be loosed
[1:30:29] now you can go forth because the son of
[1:30:31] righteousness has arisen
[1:30:33] with healing in his wings and at that
[1:30:35] day our text
[1:30:36] and at that day shall the death hear the
[1:30:39] words of the book
[1:30:40] and the eyes of the blind shall see out
[1:30:42] of obscurity and out of darkness
[1:30:45] why because brother branham said it's
[1:30:46] genesis 1 2 again
[1:30:48] darkness obscurity spiritually she's
[1:30:51] dead as a door now
[1:30:52] it's death it's death but then the book
[1:30:54] is opened
[1:30:56] and the deaf hear the words of the book
[1:30:58] and the eyes of the blind see
[1:30:59] out of darkness out of obscurity
[1:31:02] he said now that the seals are open the
[1:31:04] spirit of truth directs us to the word
[1:31:07] that's death and darkness is being
[1:31:08] defeated genesis 1 2 the spirit of truth
[1:31:11] directs us to the word
[1:31:26] he said that explains why all the
[1:31:27] mistakes have been made through the ages
[1:31:29] because the seals were not open
[1:31:33] isn't that wonderful so now that the
[1:31:35] seals are opened
[1:31:38] no more mistakes because the only reason
[1:31:40] why there was mistakes
[1:31:41] because the seals weren't open maybe
[1:31:44] that's why some people don't want them
[1:31:45] opened
[1:31:47] right that's why they want them to be
[1:31:49] like a clear bag
[1:31:51] like a candy bag it's sealed but you can
[1:31:53] see inside of it
[1:31:54] because as long as it's sealed you can
[1:31:56] justify your mistakes
[1:31:59] he says that's the reason why these
[1:32:00] mistakes were made the seals were not
[1:32:01] open this was not revealed
[1:32:04] but now that it's revealed ii
[1:32:07] thessalonians 2 8
[1:32:08] then shall that wicked be revealed whom
[1:32:10] the lord shall consume with the spirit
[1:32:12] of his mouth
[1:32:13] and shall destroy with the brightness of
[1:32:16] his coming
[1:32:18] now i want to i want to i'm going to
[1:32:20] continue to go forward and i know it's
[1:32:21] late
[1:32:21] it's already in the afternoon but i want
[1:32:24] to go forward so if you need to stand
[1:32:27] and you need to shake yourself or
[1:32:28] whatever it is you need to do
[1:32:30] i i'm not i don't plan on taking too
[1:32:32] much more time but i want to slow down
[1:32:34] for a second
[1:32:35] this scripture is fulfilled for us
[1:32:38] you'll find even brother branham has
[1:32:39] asked the question is second
[1:32:41] thessalonians 2 8 was that fulfilled in
[1:32:43] the first seal brother said yes
[1:32:44] because that's what the seals revealed
[1:32:46] that wicked one riding out for the
[1:32:47] church ages
[1:32:49] the church thought the white horse rider
[1:32:51] was christ
[1:32:54] but the seals are open it's like no it's
[1:32:55] the antichrist
[1:32:57] so then we understand and know the
[1:33:00] workings of the antichrist from the
[1:33:01] beginning
[1:33:02] he says and that wicked one shall be
[1:33:04] revealed not made manifest to the whole
[1:33:06] world yet
[1:33:06] whom the lord shall consume with the
[1:33:08] spirit of his mouth and shall destroy
[1:33:10] with the brightness of his coming
[1:33:12] to consume it means to destroy with the
[1:33:14] spirit of his mouth is that
[1:33:15] god speaking will destroy it
[1:33:18] so when god speaks it destroys
[1:33:22] this wicked one and what is it that
[1:33:26] happens at the opening seven seals it's
[1:33:27] god speaking
[1:33:29] and he that has an ear the death shall
[1:33:32] hear the words of the book
[1:33:33] and when the words are spoken to her
[1:33:35] heart it destroys the power of the
[1:33:37] wicked one
[1:33:39] he is consumed with the spirit of his
[1:33:41] mouth
[1:33:43] revelations 1 16 and he had in his right
[1:33:45] hand seven stars
[1:33:46] which are the seven messengers to the
[1:33:48] seven church ages and out of his mouth
[1:33:51] so now it's just not stars anymore but
[1:33:52] it's his mouth
[1:33:53] out of his mouth when a sharp two-edged
[1:33:56] sword
[1:33:57] whom the spirit whom the lord shall
[1:33:59] consume with the spirit of his mouth
[1:34:01] what is that two-edged sword it is the
[1:34:03] word of god
[1:34:05] he's speaking now in the end time and
[1:34:08] what is it doing it's destroying the
[1:34:09] works of satan
[1:34:10] and it says in his countenance was as
[1:34:12] the sun as the sun shineth
[1:34:14] in his strength it's the son of
[1:34:16] righteousness
[1:34:18] with healing not just physical healing
[1:34:19] but spiritual healing
[1:34:22] whom the lord shall consume with the
[1:34:23] brightness of his coming
[1:34:25] the brightness of his coming that's the
[1:34:26] glorious manifestation of god that's the
[1:34:28] epiphany the shining forth
[1:34:29] it is the revelation of jesus christ it
[1:34:32] is
[1:34:33] him shining in his strength
[1:34:37] and brother branham takes this very
[1:34:39] scripture and he connects it with
[1:34:41] revelation 1 16 he connects with
[1:34:44] revelations 21 23
[1:34:46] and the city had no need of the sun
[1:34:48] neither of the moon to shine in it
[1:34:50] for the glory of god did lighten it
[1:34:53] and the lamb is the light thereof what
[1:34:56] city is that
[1:34:58] you amen the bride the new jerusalem
[1:35:02] the glory of god doth lighten it why
[1:35:04] it's the brightness of his coming
[1:35:06] destroying the works of satan in the
[1:35:08] patmos vision when brother bran preached
[1:35:10] it he connects revelations 1 16
[1:35:12] with revelations 21 23. so i'm going to
[1:35:15] close
[1:35:18] i'm i i've grabbed the handle of the
[1:35:19] door and i'm shutting it
[1:35:22] let me say let me say this you aren't
[1:35:24] blind
[1:35:25] you can see you aren't sick
[1:35:30] you're healed whatever whatever lie
[1:35:34] whatever situation whatever
[1:35:35] whatever it might be you aren't dead
[1:35:38] you're alive
[1:35:40] because that's the message the cycle's
[1:35:42] been broken
[1:35:44] and can't you see then in this context
[1:35:46] can't you see how the devil is trying to
[1:35:48] abuse you with denominational darkness
[1:35:51] whether it be your own memory of your
[1:35:53] past and trying to overwhelm
[1:35:56] this the enemies come in like a flood
[1:35:58] it's a flood of darkness
[1:36:00] but when the enemy comes in like a flood
[1:36:02] the spirit of the lord
[1:36:04] shall lift up the standard against it
[1:36:07] and that standard means it causes the
[1:36:09] flood to be put to flight
[1:36:12] as if light is chasing away darkness and
[1:36:15] so the spirit of the lord in this end
[1:36:17] time has raised up a standard against it
[1:36:19] so listen no matter how much you may
[1:36:21] feel that you're blind you aren't blind
[1:36:22] you can see
[1:36:23] no matter how deaf you may feel you're
[1:36:25] not deaf you can hear no matter how sick
[1:36:27] you may feel you're not sick you're
[1:36:28] healed
[1:36:29] no matter how dead you may feel you're
[1:36:31] alive and the same goes for anyone else
[1:36:34] who may seem to be in the same condition
[1:36:37] because in revelations chapter 22 verses
[1:36:39] 16 and 17
[1:36:41] it says i jesus has sent my angel to
[1:36:43] testify unto you these things
[1:36:45] in the churches now think of that
[1:36:49] we had an angel come to us who was
[1:36:51] likened unto one who was a star
[1:36:54] in the hand of him one of those seven
[1:36:56] stars
[1:36:57] says i have sent my angel to testify
[1:36:59] unto thee unto you these things in the
[1:37:00] churches
[1:37:01] brother branham came and had a testimony
[1:37:03] of these things in the churches
[1:37:05] but he also had a ministry to introduce
[1:37:07] him
[1:37:09] so now he says i am the root and the
[1:37:11] offspring of david
[1:37:12] and the bright and morning star not just
[1:37:14] merely a testimony of what was in the
[1:37:16] churches
[1:37:17] but now behold i stand at the door and
[1:37:20] knock
[1:37:20] revelations 4 1 come into me accept with
[1:37:23] me i am the root and offspring of david
[1:37:25] and the bright and morning star
[1:37:30] and then after he's made known then
[1:37:33] after he declares himself as this
[1:37:34] and the spirit and the bride say come
[1:37:38] now she speaks in unison with him now
[1:37:41] they're speaking together why
[1:37:42] i am the root and the offspring of david
[1:37:44] the bright
[1:37:45] and morning star she stands there with
[1:37:48] them in his glory so now the spirit and
[1:37:50] the bride say come
[1:37:51] and he says let him that heareth say
[1:37:54] come
[1:37:56] if you've heard then you likewise invite
[1:37:58] and you say come
[1:37:59] and listen i think it's so beautiful let
[1:38:01] this be our testimony
[1:38:03] come and let him that have thirst come
[1:38:05] and whosoever will let him take the
[1:38:07] water of life
[1:38:08] freely that's our message
[1:38:12] we're not a broken cistern
[1:38:15] we say come
[1:38:22] he says i sent mine angel
[1:38:25] the angel of revelations 10 7 why the
[1:38:28] mystery is finishing
[1:38:30] and now the bride is speaking
[1:38:33] in the beginning god created the heaven
[1:38:37] and the earth
[1:38:38] and in the ending there's now a
[1:38:41] finishing
[1:38:42] it's the alpha and omega that's why i
[1:38:45] thought sister melissa special was so
[1:38:47] perfect finished well because who's
[1:38:49] finishing you are
[1:38:52] is are we going to watch jesus cross the
[1:38:54] finish line
[1:38:56] how is he the finisher in you
[1:39:00] he's the author and the finisher
[1:39:03] in the beginning now in the ending
[1:39:07] brother luke did you have the website
[1:39:08] the never ending beginning is that what
[1:39:10] it was for your wedding when he and
[1:39:12] sister rachel
[1:39:13] were engaged he set up a website is it
[1:39:15] still live i mean am i putting in a plug
[1:39:16] should we put some seo on this monetize
[1:39:18] it the never-ending beginning
[1:39:21] it's a perfect description and he used
[1:39:23] it in reference to his own natural union
[1:39:24] with his wife
[1:39:25] but what did it speak of this is
[1:39:27] something that will never end
[1:39:30] something unfolding something continuing
[1:39:32] but now we've we finished
[1:39:33] the mystery of it when christ says the
[1:39:36] things pertaining to me shall have an
[1:39:37] end
[1:39:38] he's not saying one day they're going to
[1:39:39] flip the switch and i'm going to be gone
[1:39:42] he's saying the prophecies that pertain
[1:39:43] to me will be finished
[1:39:46] they'll have an end they'll be they'll
[1:39:47] come to a clinic they'll come to a
[1:39:49] manifestation
[1:39:50] and the same with the mystery it's
[1:39:52] coming now in the ending it's the
[1:39:53] finishing
[1:39:54] and then once it's finished then
[1:39:56] eternity is dawning
[1:40:00] oh this is i i felt so compelled to end
[1:40:03] with this statement now
[1:40:05] i i've been i've been threatening now
[1:40:07] i'm i'm going to fulfill the threat
[1:40:10] what was assault is now battery because
[1:40:13] assault you just have to be in an
[1:40:15] imminent threat of harm
[1:40:16] so assault you just have to pretend to
[1:40:18] punch somebody and that could be assault
[1:40:19] so you're saying brother aaron can i
[1:40:20] suit yes you can sue
[1:40:22] yeah that's all the answer to can i sue
[1:40:24] is always yes
[1:40:26] but battery is when you actually do it
[1:40:28] so i'm actually closing
[1:40:32] if not you can sue me for assault
[1:40:35] brother branham writes this in the
[1:40:36] church age book and he says he had a
[1:40:38] dream
[1:40:40] and he says i saw a man that i supposed
[1:40:43] was my father
[1:40:45] do you do you understand how powerful
[1:40:48] the inference of authority is
[1:40:49] to the human the human mind where
[1:40:52] there's the inference of authority they
[1:40:54] have found
[1:40:55] that authority can make humans do all
[1:40:57] sorts of horrible things to other humans
[1:40:59] and they've actually done thought
[1:41:01] experiments where they give someone the
[1:41:03] inference of authority and they tell
[1:41:05] somebody
[1:41:06] turn that button up to a one and when
[1:41:08] you turn that button up to a one there's
[1:41:10] a person in another room who's gonna
[1:41:11] receive an electrical shock
[1:41:13] and so they say turn it up to number one
[1:41:15] the person goes one and you hear a guy
[1:41:16] go
[1:41:18] and they say two and hear up three oh
[1:41:21] now i want you to crank it up all the
[1:41:22] way to ten and with the inference of
[1:41:24] authority they're like wow and you hear
[1:41:25] someone going ah
[1:41:27] and the person does it without saying is
[1:41:29] this gonna harm the person
[1:41:31] is this really the right thing to do but
[1:41:34] because there's an
[1:41:35] inference of authority because they
[1:41:38] tell you they're your spiritual husband
[1:41:40] because they
[1:41:41] tell you they're your father in the
[1:41:43] gospel because they tell you they have
[1:41:45] authority over you with the inference of
[1:41:46] authority
[1:41:47] you suppose that they are your father he
[1:41:50] says i suppose that was my father he was
[1:41:52] a great big burly man
[1:41:53] i also saw a woman who was supposed to
[1:41:55] be my mother but she didn't i
[1:41:56] but she didn't look like her even as the
[1:41:58] man did not look like my father
[1:42:00] this man was very mean to his wife he
[1:42:03] had a large club with three corners on
[1:42:04] it
[1:42:05] you know when you take a log and set it
[1:42:06] up on an end and hit it with an axe it
[1:42:08] makes a three cornered wedge like piece
[1:42:10] of firewood
[1:42:10] it was like that he would take this club
[1:42:13] and hit her with it and knock her down
[1:42:16] as she would lie there crying he would
[1:42:18] walk around with his chest stuck out
[1:42:21] and on his face with such a proud
[1:42:23] boastful look
[1:42:24] that he appeared to take great pride and
[1:42:27] satisfaction
[1:42:29] in beating up a poor little woman
[1:42:33] and every time she tried to get up
[1:42:36] he would hit her i did not like what he
[1:42:39] was doing
[1:42:41] but as i considered stopping him i
[1:42:42] thought i can't tackle that man he's too
[1:42:44] big
[1:42:45] then he's supposed to be my father
[1:42:50] the inference of authority kept was
[1:42:52] working on him to keep him
[1:42:53] from standing up he said but down on the
[1:42:56] inside i knew
[1:42:57] he wasn't my father and i knew that
[1:43:01] no man had a right to treat a woman like
[1:43:03] that
[1:43:04] i went over and grabbed him by the
[1:43:06] caller and i turned him around and i
[1:43:08] said you have no right to strike her
[1:43:11] and when i said that my muscles grew and
[1:43:13] i looked like a giant
[1:43:15] do you realize what happens when you
[1:43:18] stand up for your god-given rights
[1:43:20] when you realize that you have
[1:43:22] opportunities that saint paul
[1:43:24] never dreamed of when you recognize your
[1:43:27] rights when you stand up to the devil
[1:43:29] he goes you have no right to strike her
[1:43:31] when i said that my muscles grew and i
[1:43:32] looked like a giant
[1:43:33] the man saw them and then he was scared
[1:43:35] of me i said you strike her
[1:43:38] again and you'll deal with me he
[1:43:40] hesitated to strike her again
[1:43:42] and then the dream left me let me say
[1:43:44] this i thank god that a little man about
[1:43:47] 5 8
[1:43:47] an uneducated man from kentucky had
[1:43:50] enough audacity
[1:43:51] and enough courage to grab that bully by
[1:43:54] the caller
[1:43:55] this laodicean church age all these
[1:43:57] denominations
[1:43:58] all these organizations and all these
[1:44:00] bully pulpits
[1:44:01] and he grabbed him by the caller and he
[1:44:03] says you have no right to strike her
[1:44:07] and if you do you have to deal with me i
[1:44:09] thank god he did that
[1:44:11] and i believe every man of god who's
[1:44:13] ordained to preach the gospel
[1:44:15] must follow in this same line and carry
[1:44:17] on the same legacy
[1:44:19] we are set for the defense of the gospel
[1:44:21] and therefore we're set for the defense
[1:44:23] of the bride
[1:44:24] no man has a right to treat her wrong
[1:44:28] you have no right to strike her then he
[1:44:30] interprets it the woman represents the
[1:44:32] church of the world today
[1:44:34] he says i was born right into the mess
[1:44:37] that's the mess she's in
[1:44:38] she was supposed to be kind of a mother
[1:44:41] she is the mother of harlots
[1:44:42] her husband is the denominations that
[1:44:44] rule her the three corner block is a
[1:44:47] false triune
[1:44:48] baptism of a trinity every time she
[1:44:51] started to rise up
[1:44:52] that means the congregation began to
[1:44:54] accept truth
[1:44:56] he would drive her right down again with
[1:44:59] that false doctrine
[1:45:01] he was so big that i was afraid of him
[1:45:03] at first
[1:45:05] but when i came against him i found out
[1:45:07] i had great and powerful muscles
[1:45:11] they were faith muscles the outcome of
[1:45:14] the dream
[1:45:15] was that since god is with me
[1:45:19] and give me strength and can give me
[1:45:21] strength
[1:45:22] let me stand up for her against the
[1:45:24] denominational power of the world
[1:45:26] and make him quit striking her i thank
[1:45:29] god for that
[1:45:31] let us do the same since god is with us
[1:45:36] and he can give me strength let's stand
[1:45:38] up
[1:45:39] stand up for the hurting stand up for
[1:45:41] the loss stand up for her
[1:45:43] against any power of the world and make
[1:45:45] them quit striking her
[1:45:47] you're going to have to leave that
[1:45:50] dynamic
[1:45:53] so there's got to be someone to stand up
[1:45:54] to it
[1:45:56] i say just even as that song was sung
[1:45:58] let the church arise
[1:46:01] and finish well she said let the church
[1:46:02] arise and let's lift the banner of
[1:46:04] christ
[1:46:06] let's stand to our feet today sister
[1:46:07] lord if you could come
[1:46:11] thank you for being patient
[1:46:15] giving me the opportunity to finish this
[1:46:24] light has come to defeat the darkness
[1:46:29] i want to sing i've been thinking of
[1:46:31] amazing grace in the kit of f it's a
[1:46:33] song that's just been in my heart
[1:46:35] what amazing grace in that dave the lord
[1:46:39] would lead we might amplify
[1:46:40] it more next sunday and that day shall
[1:46:41] the death hear the words of the book
[1:46:45] why because the church is dead
[1:46:48] but then something happens and life
[1:46:50] comes
[1:46:51] that's the time we're living in now
[1:46:54] that's what we're walking in
[1:46:56] and i believe this message stood up to
[1:46:59] the darkness of laodicea
[1:47:00] [Music]
[1:47:02] god says god is with me and can give me
[1:47:04] such strength
[1:47:05] we can look to the scripture that says
[1:47:08] we're living in a time
[1:47:09] where we can take it the light of the
[1:47:12] sun that's shining now
[1:47:14] it's stronger but the weed is more
[1:47:16] advanced
[1:47:17] so it's ready to take it god is with me
[1:47:20] and can give me strength let me stand up
[1:47:22] let me rise up and lift the banner of
[1:47:25] christ
[1:47:26] let's pray a word of prayer and then we
[1:47:27] could even make it a dismissal prayer
[1:47:30] our gracious heavenly father lord we're
[1:47:32] so grateful
[1:47:34] to be standing up that as the elect in
[1:47:37] this last day we're not laying
[1:47:39] around but we're standing on our feet
[1:47:41] like a great army
[1:47:44] and not merely are we a great army in a
[1:47:45] valley which was one time dead
[1:47:47] dry bones but now we've been animated by
[1:47:49] the voice of god
[1:47:51] and the son of man has prophesied and
[1:47:54] we've been raised up and now we're
[1:47:55] walking in the light of the truth
[1:47:58] and now we can have fellowship in the
[1:47:59] mystery
[1:48:01] pray lord that you strengthen the people
[1:48:02] that have come
[1:48:04] lord if there's been any obscurity or
[1:48:06] misunderstanding in my delivery lord if
[1:48:08] there's been any
[1:48:09] uh uh edge by the tone of my voice may
[1:48:12] you make it clear upon the here's
[1:48:14] ears lord and in their heart
[1:48:17] that a rebuke of baptist the rebuke of
[1:48:20] denomination the rebuke of organization
[1:48:22] [Music]
[1:48:24] rest squarely upon the promise that in
[1:48:26] this last day you would open up
[1:48:29] a new land a new message
[1:48:33] not closing a door but opening the door
[1:48:36] lord may we stand for true father not
[1:48:38] water it down
[1:48:40] but may we not obscure truth lord for in
[1:48:42] this our ears can hear and eyes can see
[1:48:45] the voice of god and the light of god
[1:48:46] shine in this end time
[1:48:48] we commit the people to you today
[1:48:50] whether sick and body or needy in their
[1:48:52] minds we believe the word is enough
[1:48:54] and upon whatever basis we need to meet
[1:48:56] you lord whether it be hands being laid
[1:48:57] on
[1:48:58] coming forward in prayer lord oil being
[1:49:02] being anointed with oil whatever
[1:49:03] whatever the steps would be in your word
[1:49:05] that we should walk through father
