TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and we're going to turn to a familiar scripture Hebrews 11 verses 1 to3 and we know it's a Wednesday night so we'll try not to hold you too long um but just try and bring out another little thought to you this evening so Hebrews 11: 1:3 it says this now Faith is the substance of things hope for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which were are seen were not made of things which do appear amen if you could just go to the next slide brother I just want to read this from the countdown it says but God in the spiritual achievement is going forward not going backward he's going forward looking into the word and believing the promises for the things that never has come yet for the spiritual Revelations to manifest the spiritual things that God has promised he sees them come to pass just as a scientist in his laboratory are working on different things uh to help man taking creation the spiritual man is looking forward to something that God promised that has never yet been created amen let's just bow our heads for a word of prayer Heavenly Father we're a privileged people today Lord to be able to gather in your name and father what a blessing it is to be in our right mind and father it's not our human mind but the right mind of Jesus Christ today Lord that father has brought a word to us Lord has bought a spirit to us and father by those things Lord that we're able to achieve such great things in Jesus Christ and God we're just so appreciative of it today Lord we just ask that you'd come in a special way and anoint my lips and the lips of those that hear father that we would be able to receive of you the things that you'd have for us father to be encouraged by them to be exhorted Lord to be lifted up into higher places and deeper depths in Jesus Christ we ask in Jesus name amen you can be seated so I uh I am uh 100% more experienced with doing a PowerPoint presentation for church than I was the last last time which also means that I'm twice as likely to have mess ups in the PowerPoint presentation since I've done two um but uh anyway you know I think it's kind of like freshman and sophomore year like they have sometimes somebody does great their freshman year and their sophomore year they're kind of a failure so hopefully that's not that tonight um not that two PowerPoint presentations is a sophomore year but uh you almost feel like it after you try and work through those things so um I'm going to pick up uh the last time that we were gathered for those of you that were here uh we were talking about X Factor and in that particular service we talked about representation and um we took the thought from uh brother Brandon teaching on the countdown and I've kind of been having a lot of different thoughts come from that particular sermon and from the things that are actually happening uh in the world today and kind of looking at those two different things so I just want to kind of give a quick uh review of what he talked about so um in the countdown he was taking the natural world and actually the creation of man and typing it with the spiritual world and what God was doing in the church and so he brought out different things from that the the natural what man was doing and typed it with the spiritual to just let us know kind of what was going on so um he typed justification with the horse and buggy hopefully you can see those pictures a little bit sanctification with the automobile and the restoration of the gifts or the Holy Spirit coming back with the gifts upon the church is the airplane and then the Holy Ghost is that spaceship and he inaugurated as the astronaut age and so it was an amazing thing to me to think that you would I wouldn't tie these things together personally I I I don't know how I would so that's why we have a prophet right because there's all kinds of things in the scripture that I don't know how we would tie it together like how do you how do you how do you how do you Poss possibly in your mind be able to Fathom the things of God and even today you'll read things and read things and read things and it's funny how you do it or at least this is what I do I'll read something and maybe 10 times later I'll read the same thing and all of a sudden it's like wow I didn't even realize it said that and it just comes out you know the Lord reveals those things to us in such a way that it's just an amazing thing and so brother random has taken this and he's tied this particular thing and the countdown together and then he said this is a by way of prophetic when he was talking about what the countdown was and he was going through and and listing it so what we had done the last time was I went through and kind of just showed because I think it's real important especially with so much discouragement uh towards brother brandom and towards the word in general I I think it's really important especially for our young people and even some of our more mature folks that we really establish the fact that he knew what he was talking about this was was no mistake in what he was talking about and so one of the things that we talked about was that we we go back in the scripture um and we look at uh the scripture back in Genesis we realized that what happened in the days of Noah and so there were particular people that were involved in this particular story and we know that the scripture says hey we're going to be living in the days of Noah at the last times uh we understand things are going to be occurring um so you you go back and and look in the scripture and think okay so what what was going on in those days or what what today would tie us back to that to say okay we're living in the days of no one so we can look around us and see how I guess the word would be horrible I I don't know what's a good what's a descriptive word I I I I guess the worst adjectives you can come up with and that pretty much describes it like think of the worst food that you hate completely and if you were said hey you have to eat this whole plate of whatever that is I don't know what it is but uh well I can tell you what it is for me but I won't say but I don't what that is for you but whatever that thing particular thing is when you go to to eat it that's how bad it is like I I can't stomach this kind of like brother brandom talked about castor oil and how bad it was and he couldn't handle it so it's kind of like the world's kind of castor oil right now because it's really hard to swallow really hard to to take that flavor and taste it so we're just at a an interesting um juncture of time so one of the things I um wanted to to say just before we move move on to the next thing where I'm going to just give a real quick backdrop on that is if you notice in those slides of Transportation there's something that's real important that we need to notice about it is that it doesn't say anything about the humans walking right every one of those is a vehicle every one of those is something that you ride in everything in fact if you're on the horse and buggy and it's moving pretty quick and you come out of it you're going to get hurt and if you're in the automobile it's worse and if you're in the airplane it's worse and by the time you get to the space brother sister unless you're suited up and and you know still Tethered to that ship you come out of that thing it's not good right as we can we can look back in history and see those things so in Acts the 17th chapter and the 28th verse it says this for in him we live and move and have our being as certain also of your own poets have said for we are also his offspring so I want you to have that idea when when we're thinking about these different vehicles that he had typed with and then we think of justification saying to ification the gifts being restored and the Holy Ghost so Jesus Christ himself the word coming and indwelling when we think of those things the power that was given to the church in each of those different ages or in each of those different times wasn't the church moving itself it was the church being moved by something greater than the church so when Martin Luther got a revelation of justification this was something amazing that it happened because remember the the Catholic church had had you know basically squeezed everybody down and it had become so dark but yet just a a thing a word of God that had come and it moved people in such a way that they could not only just come out of that organization but actually live a whole different life than they had prior to that and you could go through the sanctification the same thing and with the gifts the same thing and and and so so on and so on so I just want you to kind of have in the back of your mind that when we're talking about this spaceship today or when we're talking about what we're going to talk about that we move when God moves spiritually we're moving as God takes us so that's what I kind of want you to have in the back of your mind so uh if you remember in Genesis we start out and we're talking about uh Noah and Noah had three sons ham Shem and japeth and the interesting thing about uh ham was he was the one that we tie all the IES to and the steens to and if there's somebody bad in the Bible pretty much you can trace it back to ham because he was the one that brought the the Philistines and the amorites and whatever jebusites and like I said any IES I don't know if you have any IES in your life but if if you want to blame ham that's kind of where it came from so in the Space Race um we were battling Russia America was trying to get up into space and by the way this isn't a space lesson this isn't a science lesson I'm not trying to teach you science because I'm not a scientist but I do see a correlation between what happened and and the word of God in fact let me put it to you this way when I was a kid and I don't remember if I shared this before but when I was a kid I was raised Roman Catholic and so when you're young and uh your parents plan Christmas it's a pretty big deal and so I don't know about kids but I was pretty excited to get presents right because presents are awesome at least that's what I thought when I was a kid so uh as you get older you maybe don't appreciate it as much but when you're young it's very exciting and not being the best of kids uh I always look for the presents that my mom would would hide cuz I was excited to get them cuz they were presents right cuz you're a kid and it's very exciting let's go find the present so I'd look everywhere I'd search in the garage I'd search through their closet under the bed in the dresser everything and my mom was a good shopper so she'd always buy stuff ahead of time and all those years of of being a kid and and and that and searching for presents I didn't find anything like ever but always stuff would show up you know the day that it was supposed to show up here'd be all these presence and it's like where did they hide them CU I know they didn't go out because of course being a kid you stay up as long as you can right and you sneak around and try and see what you can find out but she would hide things in plain sight just right on a bookshelf I didn't think to look on the bookshelf cuz there a right in the living room you know above the fireplace on the mantle something would be hidden and the most obvious places you could possibly think all those things were there and that's where she put them and I never caught on and I think sometimes that's what the Lord does he puts things in obvious places and we just don't sometimes it just doesn't click for us um you know in fact maybe in the Church of God it it clicks in the message I think we get a little bit more of that clicking right but in other Realms folks people just can't see it even if it's in plain sight so don't get too excited about the fact they don't see it it's okay because that's the way it goes sometimes but anyway we're talking about ham being that person um and so in the American Space Race the the first thing the first humanoid not human but humanoid they sent into space was named ham and he was a chimpanzee as you see by the picture now despite the resemblance he is not actually related to anyone in this room so I just want to make that clear that you understand and by resemblance I mean he's got an opposable thumb like the rest of us do cuz see how he's holding the paper so isn't it funny that as our space race takes off and remember this country was established by the Lord I mean it was it was it was the work of God that established this country outnumbered outgunned right we know that the Lord was present brother brandham even talked about when they were I think it was the Declaration of Independence when they were signing that they had a seat there for for for the Holy Ghost to be present with them for the Lord to be present they made a special seat so here they are in and showing ham as being the first one to take off and then um it was a man named Alan Shepard which to me is also so he's a man called Shephard uh this is him actually in the Space Capsule when he's getting ready to take off and it's going to be real important in just a few minutes because we're going to talk about how he's strapped in there um but Alan Shepard was the first one and then the last time we talked I didn't include it in this particular show because I wanted to focus a little bit on Mr Mr Shephard um was that brother Brandon had had talked about that John Glenn was the first astronaut into space and the difference between this gentleman Alan Shepard and John Glenn's flight was that Alan Shepard basically shot up in the air he kind of went across the earth a little ways and then came back down um John Glenn when he was shot into space he actually orbited the Earth three times and then came back down so he got a little bit higher had a had actually a view of the earth got to see something uh came back down this gentleman was so strapped in that he didn't see much of anything on the way so anyway if you kind of I just want to give these this information I don't want to go deep into that because we just don't have time for it but I just wanted to kind of establish that this is where we're at so we see that um there's a history that that is tied to the Space Race and it it's all the way through the the first astronaut in space or Cosmonaut was a Russian who was a farmer and Noah was a farmer his name was farmer um so it just all ties together so anyway we won't go that deep into that but what I want to talk to you about tonight is something that happens to astronauts when they get into space and what it is is called the overview effect and we might call it something like the big picture effect so we've heard the saying you can't see the forest for the trees right you can't you can't get far enough back because you're just in the midst of the trees you can't see the forest so it's the big picture effect and so there's something that happens to the Natural astronaut when they get up into space um and it's it's a very interesting thing that happens to them and they become almost overwhelmed um with what it's like to see Earth and the interesting thing about it is the effect doesn't actually happen when they get out there and see maybe the vastness of space in fact if you'll remember brother brandom talked about a man who got out there and he said well I didn't see God so therefore there must not be a God and it's interesting to me that when we have a preconceived notion about something so the gentleman obviously had an idea in his head hey this is what it's going to be when I get out into space God's going to be there I'm going to see him he's going to be some being floating in space for some reason I'm going to know he's there so we've got this whole universe you've got you know bazillion Stars I don't know how many but it's in the billions or without number right I I wouldn't know how to count them um I'm sure the Lord knows the number but he hasn't shared it unless he shared it with you let me know cuz I would love to know that number uh that would be interesting to find out but they get out there and and they can see the vastness of space they can see they even know how it's expanding they they see all these different things and yet it never catches on but what happened when they would turn back and look back at the Earth is when the overview effect actually took place and so when they would see that they would actually be overwhelmed almost by the emotion of it and there would be things that that took place and they had a man that his name is Frank White that actually I guess wrote a book I haven't read the book by the way but he wrote a book about this particular effect because he's talking to these astronauts and they're all telling him the same thing when I when I got into space there was this when I saw the Earth and it's Mother Earth and they realize you know what's there and they had this connection to it they all have these different feelings about it so I'm just going to read some quotes of of what they said um next if you would so the first one it says you see how diminutive your life and concerns are compared to other things in the universe the result is you enjoy the life that is before you it allows you to have inner peace it was something that I have not got the vocabulary I haven't got the words to say perfection wouldn't touch it superb wouldn't even touch it nowhere it was something that I never you just have to be there it sort of reduces things to a size that you think everything is manageable all all these things that seem big and impossible we can do World Peace no problem so isn't that funny that you you get out into space and you're just looking back at Earth and it's such an a human experience that suddenly The Impossible becomes possible so that's a good thought right The Impossible becomes possible it's extraordinary the most profound experience I can imagine it's so much larger than me I wish there was some way I could explain it to you there are no words I couldn't find it it's not found anywhere then it says so I knew exactly what I was going to see but there was no way you can be prepared for the emotional impact it brought tears to my eyes I didn't feel like a giant I felt very very small somehow you feel a part of something bigger and that fills me with hope and I didn't include their whole thing but I just wanted to give you an idea of what this is so what they say is they have an overwhelming feeling of UN when they get up high enough when they can look back and they they see themselves as a part of something bigger than themselves and they start to see their connection to that Earth and they see the you know they they realize that everything that matters to them is there that that's where life is that that's where important things are that the interesting thing that happens is politics don't really matter anymore religion doesn't really matter any anymore the things that divide people don't really matter anymore and they start to think what can I do to fix things when I get back to Earth how can I make this life on Earth better in other words what is there out there that I can do that that I can do something so if you just go to the next one Psalms 1331 it says this behold how good and how pleasant it is for Brethren to dwell together in unity and I thought you know the word already had these answers a long ago so starting a long time ago and we could go through and you could search all kinds of scriptures and we just don't have time for it this evening but Unity was something that God always wanted and here it is man be able starts to to connect himself to something Beyond himself right because this is a view that very few people see I mean very few people are privileged to see that view of Earth some five 500 and some they they say over 600 but many have been multiple times up into space so so somewhere around 600 people have had this opportunity to to witness this particular thing and almost all of them come back with a similar uh basically feeling about what it is that they see and so I'm thinking about that and I thought you know that's the Lord had had already written about this and had been talking about it and so when when we realized that Jesus Christ came on the scene he he started the overview effect right away because he's introducing something that's brand new because remember in the old test what was what was the thing that everybody loved you wrong me I'm paying you back right you rob from me I'm robbing from you it was an eye for an eye and it was a tooth for a tooth right so if you did something there's going to be payback if if you know somebody killed killed my my family member I'm killing your family member it's kind of like the the mafia if you kill my family member I'm killing your family me you and every other family member that's with you because that's the way it was and and it was a very it when you look at the law it was it was a fairly harsh thing because you you had to have something to guide the people because if you didn't guide them when they got under the wrong Spirit what happened right so you had to have something a way to guide them and so that's why the law was in place but in Luke chapter 6 we're starting when when Christ comes he starts with this whole New Concept that comes out so the 27th verse of Luke 6 it says this but I say unto you which here love your enemies do good to them which hate you well that's a concept right we'd have to consider that one pretty hard if we were living under a law where it said hey eye for eye for tooth for tooth you know I I need to get something but here the Lord is actually introducing them to what these people are experiencing out in space this is an overview effect because the effect of the word is to change you into something just like the effect of looking back at the Earth has changed these people almost all of them say have been changed forever if you if you ask the astronaut that's seen these things and has been affected by it they've been changed forever so reading on the scripture bless them that curse you and pray for them which despitefully use you and unto him that smiteth thee on the One Cheek offer also the other and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat also give to every man that Ask Of Thee and of him that taketh the way thy Goods ask them not again and as you would that men should do to you do ye also to them likewise for if you love them which love you what thank have you for Sinners also Lo love those that love them and if you do good to them which do good to you what thank have you for Sinners also do even the same and if you lend to them of whom you hope to receive what think have you for Sinners also lend to Sinners to receive as much again but love your love you your enemies and do good and lend hoping for nothing again and your reward shall be great and you shall be the children of the highest for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil be ye therefore merciful as your father also is merciful judge not and you shall not be judged condemn not you shall not be condemned forgive and you shall be forgiven given it shall be given unto you good measure pressed down and shaken together and running over shall men give into your bosom for with the same measure that you meet with all it shall be measured to you again so I I'm I'm thinking of these here's these astronauts and they're so moved by just seeing Earth and and then I'm thinking about the word of God and I can see where Christ has already prepared us for this and hidden it basically in plain sight and maybe we're not even aware that he's making this good measure for us in other words he's making this preparation for us by placing the word and then not only does he place the word in place for us but he follows up with the Holy Ghost to allow us to come into an image of that same thing that he's talking about so it's not hey you have to do this it's hey here's what you need to do and to make sure that you can I'm going to give you the power I'm going to give you the mobility or in other words I'm going to give you the that that spaceship I'm going to give you the capability to get you there and I'm going to make sure that you're able to get to this point and you don't have to rely on yourself you don't have to do this thing yourself I am the one that's going to take you to this level so I'm going to make sure and and so he places in his word cuz this is tough I mean I don't know about you so I'll just use my own confession it's not the easiest thing humanly to love your enemies right you can you can look sometimes it's your sometimes it's family members that you know they just know how to get maybe under your skin right sometimes it's co-workers they just know like you know they work with you enough they figure you out one of the things in the fire service just so you know it one of the things that you never do is tell them a weakness so if you have a fear of snakes never tell anybody because if you do guess what you will find everywhere every day snakes if you have a fear of spiders tell no one because every day whenever you can or whenever they can you will see spiders if you have a fear of of people popping out in you know odd places people will pop out in odd places so and right because they once somebody recognizes a weakness they kind of go after it and one of the things that interesting is and I don't want to get into personality types or anything like that but you'll find people that um I I guess in science they call it passive aggressive but you know they will put digs in but they don't come out and really say it blunt to your face right they'll they'll do it kind of as as a behind the kind of as a controlling thing to kind of push you a certain way and control you a certain way and and they'll do it as a dig and the the thought here is that if that's happening in the church well we've got a problem right but fortunately the Lord's given us a way to fix that problem because if let's say let's say we're dealing with it in the church let's say we have an issue that's going on and or or some church not necessarily the church body here but I'm just saying somewhere you've been to church right and there's some kind of issue that's come up and somebody's put you down or put you into a category or or tried to control you by some way whatever that person was whatever if they were in leadership or they weren't in leadership they were just somebody in the congregation could have been somebody related to whatever that particular thing is if they're trying to control you and they're in church I I can tell you what the problem is they haven't gotten high enough yeah amen that's the problem you just haven't gotten you you haven't gotten enough of that so you you have to be in the ship and the ship's got to take you High Enough and then there's something else that has to happen too you have to be willing to look back and have a connection with what that is so in other words if if you get up high enough so this was the thing that happened with with the astronauts when they got up high enough that effect like I said earlier didn't take a didn't didn't happened to them until actually they were looking back and found a connection with what they were seeing amen until they did that until they actually made a connection to something that we see they were seeing nothing really happened they're like oh this is great you know hey I made it I'm an astronaut this is I'm really cool kids are going to love me when I land back on the earth it's going to be an amazing time everything's going to be special but they never had that unifying feeling they didn't have that kind of thing that happened to them and that's kind of the same thing in the word of God unless and and we we talk about it this way they they'll say you have to know who you are and that's really good you do have to know who you are and you have to know what your relationship is to the Lord right but in that same thing you have to know what you are as well because if you know you know I I know who I am but I don't know what my role is right I I've got a sense of who I am but if I I I don't understand what it is that the Lord's looking for or requiring from me then there's something that that I need and I I need to get I need to take a better look at what it is that's coming or what it is that's happening or what it is what's my connection to this place what's my connection to heaven how do I get there what what is it that makes me drawn towards that thing and to be willing to to look completely and establish that relationship with it and understand that there is a relationship there and and a lot of times the barrier to the relationship is is ourselves we look in the mirror there's the barrier we find it you know the the our we're enemy sometimes is ourselves and that's what we're looking at Galatians the 6th chapter and the 10th verse says this if we have as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men especially unto them who are of the household of faith I was telling the Saints up in Cottonwood I said this was an interesting thing for me I I used to work in construction um a long time ago and uh some of the brothers at the church we when we would need something done you'd ask another brother and we found out something that was very interesting uh you would ask somebody to do something and suddenly the price went up if they were a brother in the church compared to the siners so we we we came up with the saying just give me the sinner deal because the sinner deal was better than the brother deal because and I'm not sure why I mean at least it seemed that way so it might have been just my perception and others perception around me but anyway it became a saying just give me the center deal because the center deal was better usually because that Center deal was competition right you had to go out and and and win the competition but if you're in church it's like captive audience they're not certainly going to go get some sinner to to sell this thing to them I'll sell it to them and it again that was our my perception might be false but it I just wanted to let you know that that's how it was and and sometimes I find in church what we're able to do is we treat Sinners pretty well most most believers do a pretty good job of that but in the church it's a little bit harder for some reason following what Galatians says here is something that's just a little bit harder to do and the reality is we just need to get a little bit higher and we just need to take a better look that's all because when we get a better look and we realize our place in God and what we're to be in God that'll happen and by the same token Saints if you're there and somebody else isn't just remember all they need to do is get a little bit higher just remember the saying it's nothing that the Holy Ghost can't cure right it's nothing that the Holy Ghost can't cure so sometimes we want to cure it ourselves we want to fix the problem we want to fix that person and sometimes prayer is the best way to fix it because sometimes you can't you know you find out with your kids when they go astray sometimes you just can't fix them you know it takes it takes the Holy Ghost to be involved to to do something for you something different James the thir chapter and we're going to read 13th verse and the 17th and 18th verse and I'm sorry I'm moving fast but I want to finish in a reasonable time tonight the word says this on the 13th chapter who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you let him show out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom but the wisdom that is from above is first pure then Peaceable gentle and easy to be entreated full of mercy and good fruits without partiality and without hypocrisy and the fruit of righteousness is swn in peace of them that make peace so all I'm doing here is I just wanted to read a few scriptures we're going to go on to Colossians to save time third chapter in the 10th through the 17th verse and it says and have put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him for there is neither Greek nor Jew circumcision or uncircumcision Barbarian cyan Bond nor free but Christ is all and in all put on therefore as the elect of God holy and beloved bowels of mercies kindness humbleness of Mind meekness and longsuffering forbearing one another and forgiving one another If any man have a quarrel against any even as Christ forgave you so also do ye and above all these things put on charity which is the bond of perfectness and let the peace of God rule in your hearts to the which also you are called in one body and it says and be ye thankful let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and AD teaching and admonishing one another in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with Grace in your hearts to the Lord and whatsoever you do in word or In Deed do all in the name of the Lord giving thanks to God and the father by him so all these scriptures that we're reading are just the Lord's way of letting us know hey there's an overview effect in other words there's a big picture right I maybe big pictures is something that we would understand better than overview so an overview is just I'm looking over the audience right now so I I have a good view of like everybody and if you're sitting back in the corner you might not have a view of the girls that are over here you know depending on where you're sitting there may be things in your way but an overview allows me to see everything all at once and the scripture is an all- encompass in scripture so everything we need as far as the word of God goes is written in the word for us and then everything that needed to to be revealed through a prophet was revealed for us so we don't have to ring our hands and worry about it or have have discouragement about it everything that's necessary for you was already there so let's go back to Alan Shepard for a minute you don't have to go back to the picture but so Alan Shepherd to me I I I read about him and he kind of reminded me of my dad he was kind of uh uh and I I don't know so I should be since this goes out on the internet I should be careful uh because I don't know the man but from what I read he just reminded me of of my father um and my dad was uh a person that um you would never see cry uh he was a very um stoic person a very matter of fact uh he he was a very what you would call a man's man I guess I don't know he he was not what do they call it now metrosexual he wasn't that way at all he was he was from an era where you know the men were men and the women were women and and that was the way it was and that's kind of what this man reminded me of so when they sent alen Shepard into space one of the things that that was going on and why they strapped him in so tightly is because they were so fearful of what might happen to him when he got out there there was a lot of anxiety because it was trepidation they weren't sure about it what's going to happen to this man we need to make sure that that he's prepared for this flight and so they if you when you saw that picture and you can go back to it if you want brother John but he's he's very compacted and very strapped in and very unable to move and I thought about this because he was so strapped in he pretty much didn't see anything except for the inside of the spaceship they had a window for him but he couldn't even like lift his head to like change the view or whatever cuz he was so strapped in and I thought you know isn't it amazing that when people have fear or anxiety or trepidation about something it traps them and you get so trapped in in that fear or anxiety or trepidation and it could be other things too and sorry for the kids if you don't know trepidation but it's basically fear on another level so um it it's it when you have those kind of things happen in your life it's just like this man he went into space but he couldn't see anything and so the interesting thing about Allan Shepard was when he he got out into space um he uh ended up going back and and being a person that walked on the moon in fact for the golfers and I don't know if anybody's a golfer he actually played golf on the moon so he he took and whacked a golf ball and I don't know how far it went he thought it went forever and they they figured out how far and it didn't go forever but anyway he got to play golf on the moon but one of the interesting things about him was that they asked him you know hey what about your your trip into you know space you know were you expecting to to have you know anything happen when you got out there on the moon like you know when you looked back at Earth what what did you were you expecting to to you know have any kind of reaction and he said you know before I left if theya said hey you know are you going to like have a real emotional response are you going to you know is something big going to happen to you when you get out there and he's he's like I would say no there's nothing's going to happen but Alan Shepard gets out on the moon and when he turns around to see Earth he said he just started crying so I thought that'd be to me it's like if you can imagine the most stoic person that you know and you put him in that situation and all of a sudden they're hit by this flood of emotion and to me that's like Christ when he comes to you you might be the most stoic person in this building but I can tell you if the Holy Ghost moves on you you can cry like a baby and it's okay men it's okay and women it's okay too and kids it's okay as well because that's something that's perfectly fine you know I I'm going to interject this I wasn't planning on it but I'm going to anyway so many many years ago I won't tell you how many decades cuz it had aged me and I'm aged enough already so uh but many many years ago there was a young girl a sister in a church and uh she was probably your girl's age maybe right in that that range but she uh started praying for the Holy Ghost and I can tell you that so um we used to attend the church and then we we um had moved away for a while and came back and so in between that time um this young girl had sought the Holy Ghost and um she'd been pretty much the only one as far as I know in the church at the time seeking the Holy Ghost and when the Holy Ghost fell it didn't just change her the whole church changed and when when we came back and you ever hear Brother brand talk about a Canadian church so it's a little bit starchy right so there was a little bit of that um and some of you might know the story but when you came back you pretty much had to look like get the address on the building and make sure that was this the right building am I in the right because brother sister it changed the church and that's what the Holy Ghost will do it didn't it didn't it wasn't that effect didn't just happen to one person I mean it was the whole building and not not overnight but pretty soon that whole church changed to where you wouldn't know that it was a Canadian starie church it was Pentecostal as Pentecostal could be and Pentecostal is not a bad word it's not a cuss word if anybody worries about that because Pentecost was an experience right it's not speaking in tongues that's what some people labeled it that's okay but it wasn't that it was something that completely changed people changed their perspective it changed their view it changed the way that they were relating to each other it changed how the church was moving and I I'm not saying that you need to to be like that but what I am saying is when the Holy Ghost comes in expects something to happen am and if it comes in and it's not you but it comes to somebody else you better get ready because it's going to move on you too and it's a good thing because that's what you need is the power of the Holy Ghost to do something for you that's what's going to change you and so just like Alan Shepard where he's he's someone that isn't emotional he's not really gripped by things he he was a very to me a little bit hard kind of person but yet it changed him and it it it gave him a whole different world view than he'd ever had before so I just thought that was an interesting thing um if you could bring up the next slide so I just want to show you this are just some things that are out in space there are several uh space telescopes that are up there and they're giving us pictures so uh again I'm not a scientist I'm not advocating that anybody becomes a scientist or that you become a natural astronaut and trying to get out to see one of these things um but this is a what they call NGC 33324 which is a star forming region in the kry nebula which all I know is they say it's Interstellar dust and gas that makes that look like that so I'm going to tell you why I'm doing this in just a second so go to the next slide please so this is what they call a cartwheel Galaxy something that you can see out in space to me they they're amazing pictures if you can go to the next one please this is called Proxima centuri the closest star to Earth and then the last one if you would they in the next slide this is called the star Zeta ofi and I don't even know if I'm stay in that right but I hope it's close so and the reason I'm showing you these things is one it's it's an amazing thing to see what's out in space but if you could go back one picture I think it is yeah so this particular picture was taken off the internet it was labeled as proximus centor but I just want to let you know do you know what this might be anybody have a guess some of you now the people that have seen the news I don't want don't want you to tell me anybody guess that hasn't seen the news so proximus and Tori if you take the p and the C it's a basically a picture of pork chiso so a scientist decided to I don't troll does that make the kids that know what troll is that make fun of people basically is that what it is trolling so he decided to to troll his followers while you would do this I have no idea and he took a picture of cheso I don't know if it was pork I just assume pork cheso it could have been beef cheso I don't know could have been vegetable cheso I don't know but it was a picture of teso and so he took this picture and put it out on the internet so I'm doing this for two reasons one so you'll wake up for the finish of the sermon uh and and two to just and this is part of adults eat free tonight so right so and it's not that you're getting pork Cho it is the fact that everything on the internet is not necessarily true so you can have scientists that put things out on the internet and just because they put it out on the internet doesn't necessarily make it so so we can look at pictures that they send back and and it's lovely to see I think it's very interesting to see but my faith isn't in the internet or the pictures that they show or any of those other things our faith is in the word of God and you know and and just to to continue on with the idea of the overview effect and sorry about that I just wanted to to to show some people the pictures and I thought that was really interesting that I I why would you do that I mean I I don't know but anyway it was shocking to me that somebody would would go to to that length to make fun of other people um so with regard to to this and and the overview effect science and and and by the way and I'm sure brother Aaron is is listening tonight but I almost thought there was a disturbance in the message uh when he said science was right um because most of the time you'll never hear anybody say science is right but he also went on to explain how that science was and science observes what they can right so and they have to try and explain what they can by observation so um for maybe some of the young people I'm sure you're probably not confused about this but science uh um basically came up with an explanation of how everything happened and so their explanation was basically from something that was I don't have a pin but something that's about the size of the point of your if you look at your pens about the size of that there was a big bang and billions of stars started to form and planets came and all these different things happened and the universes continuing to expand because they needed something there it couldn't be nothing so there had to be something so somehow all this energy is built up into something that size and then boom it explodes the word of God instead says in the beginning God and that's what we know as having an effect so science has an idea right and I don't know what the chances or what the numbers are and I know somebody's figured it out I didn't look it up to to see what their their odds are but when Genesis talks about from How The Creation happened and it goes from one thing to another so it starts out with the you know the the water and the little things and then it gets bigger and then you've got you know you have fish and then you have birds and then you have you know Beasts of the field and then you have things that walk upright the the odds of of the Bible being correct on that for men that have written it thousands of years ago is astronomical that they would have how did they figure it out like where did they come but it was the word of God right so science in its own way was like well we've got to have an explanation so there had to been something there but yet for God it it wasn't necessary that anything be there there wasn't anything that had to be there so um go to the next slide if you wouldn't mind says this and the rejected King and I Heard a Voice then that spoke to me that was in the room said this is what you preached was the Holy Ghost this is perfect love and nothing can enter here without it it I am more determined than ever in my life that it takes perfect love to enter there there was no jealousy there was no tiredness there was no death sickness could never in there never in there mortality could could never make you old and they could not cry it was just one Joy so brother brandom is talking about he's relating a story about when he was at home and he was carried up are most of us familiar with the story most of us know it okay so brother Brandon was talking about a story of when he he was carried up um and he he he went and met the Saints and they were under the Altar and so uh he's in a different dimension now and he's went to see something there and I I got to thinking about that particular thing and you know we talk about the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost is a spaceship and the Holy Ghost takes us up but brother brandom went higher than anybody and he went up to a dimension that we haven't crossed over so we're still in this one and we're still in still dealing with that fourth dimension where we have all the issues and in fact just to mention this with the astronauts you know the the interesting thing about astronauts is even when Russia invaded Ukraine the astronauts that were on the space station were like we're astronauts they they weren't saying hey I'm a Russian astronaut or I'm an American astronaut I'm I'm an astronaut right and so they stayed unified in the fact that they were astronauts and I think that's a good lesson for for the church to learn it it's it's not the politics so the Republican Democrat independent doesn't matter what church group that you go to doesn't matter and that's why I appreciated brother Aaron preaching about local church versus true church and and what the the local church serves that true church and if we get a revelation of that we have an understanding of that then you know one Church politics goes away but then other politics does too because then you're not you're able to fellowship with Democrat or independent or libertarian or whatever you know at least to the point that you can agree right so you you can do those things and you're able to accomplish those things simply because that you have received something greater so um going back earlier and I just want to I threw these in here I wasn't trying to be tricky but I was trying to make a point so brother Brandon was actually two of the quotes cuz he was a spiritual astronaut to me and some of you probably might have recognized him or thought man that's really familiar I think I've heard that before so um one of the quotes it was it's on slide eight I believe it was something that I he says this it was something that I have not got the vocabulary I haven't got the words to say perfection wouldn't touch it superb wouldn't even touch it nowhere it was something I never you just have to be there so that's brother brandom's quote about when he gets up and sees something Beyond anything that he'd seen before and so he's coming back and saying Hey listen there's something out there that's more amazing than anything that I've ever seen and I don't know know so we see pictures where you know the Angels over ahead right we've got a picture of that he sees Visions all the time he sees things happen and yet he gets to this place that's again higher than somewhere he's ever been and then all of a sudden everybody's coming up to him our precious brother brother our precious brother and then he sees people that are like 90 something years old but yet they're 20s something years old now and the the Angels tell him hey this is this is one that you led to the Lord when she was 90 and here's this other one and and he the the feeling is overwhelming and he's got no way to describe it and to me that's just like these astronauts in the natural they're like how can I put into words what I'm seeing I don't know what it is what's going on here but yet you have a spiritual astronaut that's gone higher than something that we have right now and he's sending word back and saying you need to see this you need to experience what I'm experiencing because there's perfect Joy here there's there's amazing stuff here and this is something that you've got to connect to so the other one that was also brother brandom is I wish there was some way I could explain it to you there's no words I couldn't find it it's not found anywhere so the best thing we've got is the word of God because that's our best view and and and the message itself working with that word to to teach us and to help us to understand what's out there and how we can connect to that thing and how we can get a better view than we've ever had before so the petty differences that come up when we when we have somebody that's critical and you know this is a really tricky thing if you have somebody that's critical and you want to say something about it then you become critical so it's like a 22 how do how do I fix this but say something because they're critical because you don't want to be critical right uh but I I believe that the word can can teach us what to do in those situations so that we can offer correction not that we're trying to fix somebody but we can offer a correction in such a way that we're actually doing it out of love not just because they're so critical I can't stand them because that's a little different when it's I can't stand this critical person and therefore I'm going to fix this as opposed to this person is critical but I really want them to see that there's something higher and there's something greater and there's something deeper that they can they can come to so we're almost done don't worry I'm not going to hold you much longer so if you could go to the next um slide so this is a view one of the views of um from space of the earth and normally what the astronauts describe is seeing that you see the little red line that's there so what the astronauts describe is that's usually blue but I chose this particular picture for a reason so when they're looking back at Earth they see what's protecting them and it's basically a blue line and that blue line goes all the way around the world and it's basically a line that protects them from the vacuum of space so in the vacuum of space if you get out there and you didn't have some kind of protection like what they're wearing they're in a spaceship they have special suits if they go outside of the spaceship they're Tethered to the ship they have special things but that little line and some of them described it as like paper thin some of them described it as like thin like skin like it was just a a a very thin line and they realized that without that without that protection that there's certain death and the reason I chose this red line is because without the blood of Christ without a Scarlet thread without that as a protection there's no way that you're going to see the level that brother brandom saw that's right and you know he told the whole story and we won't go into it but just the end of the story is this that when when he started to condemn somebody and he started to have problems and he was going to Lord why don't you just wipe him off the face of the Earth then the Lord showed him that red line that's he showed him that Earth covered and said you're you're looking at the wrong thing and that changed him right so here he is on Earth and and now he's had this change because the Lord has showed him what kind of protection he was under it wasn't just who he was but it was what he was so what was his relationship to that that red thing it was that his relationship to the blood was when he sinned his sin went up and hit the blood and the blood took care of it and then he sinned again and his sin went up and it hit the blood and the blood took care of it and each time that something happened the blood took care of it and so much so that then he saw this image of when all his sins were in a book and those that book was taken and thrown into the sea of forgetfulness to be remembered no more and that to me this is so striking because here we are and we see Earth and it's got this Veil around it that protects it from from certain death but yet we've got a greater Veil that protects us a a a greater thread a a greater thing that protects us from that place and from that thing and I I you know there's an interesting thing and I heard this from another brother so I don't take credit for it but one of the things I I wanted to to kind of throw in here as we're about to wrap this up is that when you get out into space one of the things that you have to remember is that you have to stay Tethered to the ship you can't just go off on your own and you know the Bible actually deals with this because it talks about those that were once enlightened and they've tasted of the Heavenly gift and so they they've gotten something right they got up there somewhere and and then they get out there and then they're like oh I I don't need it anymore I don't like it anymore I don't want it anymore whatever the situation is they come to a place where they decide I don't need that and it's it's kind of like sometimes people get out of the well let me put it to you this way and it we find that the message um has developed some people that have some interesting doctrinal ideas and they don't they don't really come from the word or the message although they can take and kind of mix things together until it looks like it does and the interesting thing that I find is that you don't see a lot of of what we call maybe nominal church people doing that it's actually typically in the Realms of the message and you have to think well why is that why why would we do that and it's because they free they're free right you get out and look at what's what's the one experience that you've heard about people in space what do they get to do what are they wait weightless right if you get if if Alan Shephard got out of that that basically that thing that was holding him he gets out of the seat belt they float around so these space tourists that are going up right now they get up in there and guess what they get to do take off their seat belts and they float around in their Space Capsule and they get to see the Earth from that particular View and then they come back down and when we talked about the the inspiration for crew they got to actually orbit the earth so they're out of their things floating all over the place so freedom is awesome but you got to stay Tethered to the ship you know you've got to stay with the word and you've got to stay with the leadership of the Holy Ghost because once you start to lead yourself and once you you go that way that that Thin Red Line so I I don't look at like so the astronauts looked at the Earth like it was fragile I don't see Christ as fragile but what I do see as fragile sometimes is our relationship to him in other words the way that we view our relationship to the Lord and sometimes the way that we view our relationship to other people that's where the fragility comes in it's not that the blood is fragile the blood's able to forgive anything that it needs to the Bud's able to accomplish anything in your life that's necessary the blood's able to do that no matter what but the fragility comes sometimes in our relationship or our view of it because we get preconceived ideas we decide sometimes who's in and who's out and let's face it it happens right you'd be surprised sometimes like you see people look at we could look at in the B you know the the man of gadera who would think of us if you saw a guy that's out doing what he's doing that this guy is actually a Believer right because we have a preconceived idea that's why you need the Holy Ghost and the word to guide and that that way we're not fragile We're Not Fragile like that blue line that surrounds the Earth We're actually more than able to to overcome everything that's possible so we're able to do that so I want to read um we're going to be closing here shortly so um if the musician wants to come up and start playing that would be wonderful so with the the Advent of of this space travel and with what was happening they said that there's something that has happened um and it's it's become something of of a unifying cry if you want to say and it's called the whole Earth view and in this whole Earth view when you have a view of the whole earth that's when the political problems disappear that's when the barriers go away that's when the the problems between people go away when racial problems aren't an issue you don't have people thinking that I need to fix this or fix that and I I was thinking about that particular thing when they're talking about the whole Earth view and there they say this is the age so they they've introduced this idea that this is the age of the whole Earth view and I thought well that's perfect timing cuz this is the age of the whole word view this is the age when the word has opened and it's 100% if it was beyond 100% I I guess it would be that but it's completely open to the Bride of Jesus Christ and our relationship to that word through the Holy Ghost is able to carry us on to a amazing and amazing things and so it's just to me something that that's the most amazing thing could you go to the last slide brother and brother brandom says this in countdown it says what are they doing they are wrapped in Christ in rapturing Grace and brother and sister that's where we're at this is rapturing Grace and the thing that that can overwhelm us as far as that and I don't want to get on an emotional level but on a word level or on a faith level is that in rapturing Grace those different scriptures that we read through rapturing Grace you're able to accomplish all those things through rapturing Grace you're able to overcome all those things through rapturing Grace you're able to forgive you know the scripture says 490 times a day what a concept that is now it might feel like sometimes people can sin 490 times a day against you but I don't think anybody's everever achiev that yet but it's just something Ju Just so amazing so there wrapped in Christ go ahead and keep it up please sorry in rapturing Grace nothing they did themselves Christ took the uneducated the foolish things of the world wrapped his astronauts in it and empowered them with the Holy Ghost to take off brother sister that's where we're at today you're empowered with the Holy Ghost to take off and we started with a scripture where it said that things that are made of things that would do not appear and then we had that that quote that we read at the start from brother bandam and this is what I want you to get if you get nothing else from the sermon besides there's a red line covering you and there's a relationship to be had that'll give you a different view it'll give you a big picture view so it's not the issues dealing dealing at home or dealing with the neighbors or dealing with a problem in church or wherever those issues might be but it's a different view that'll be able to unite you to the word of God and in uniting you to the word it'll allow you to night in a Brotherhood and and not a Brotherhood of man where we're going to go off to Mars somewhere but a Brotherhood of man that's going to take us to the place where brother brandom talked about and told us about and saw and visited and saw those people and so the idea is this in your life maybe you don't see yourself where you should be maybe you feel like I need more and whatever that is I need more love we all need that right so that's an easy one maybe you need more peace you know sometimes you just some some people just can't settle like there there's something in you that just you know it you feel like every day there's just some you know something's wrong but God where there's nothing that appears has already placed in you what's necessary to make something that's not there appear so whatever you have need of today if that's if it's a the ability to just turn and look at Christ in a different way if it's an ability to see you know something that you haven't seen to to to just like those astronauts did when they're seeing the they're seeing Earth in a different way because before when they're on the earth you're seeing what you can see and you get up in a plane you can see a little bit more but now you can see the whole picture now you can see these relationships now you can see that hey these these Petty differences that we have World Peace isn't a problem we can fix this thing but naturally you can't but spiritually God has placed in you everything necessary just like the last time we talked remember silica's like in every phone that's in this building sand from a beach who would think that it would end up there everything that was necessary to build a spaceship in the earth so everything necessary for you is available and God will make those things appear out of things that today don't appear at all it may not appear and and and here's the other part of the thought it may not appear in the person that you're having the battle with they just need to get a little bit higher themselves they need to just get a little different view themselves you know they all all it takes is just a little bit bigger picture of what's going on and it'll lead you to everything that's necessary in Christ amen it's rapturing Grace Saints I pray God bathes Us in it cuz I don't know about you but I need it every day and I need it more and more every day why don't you stand with me
