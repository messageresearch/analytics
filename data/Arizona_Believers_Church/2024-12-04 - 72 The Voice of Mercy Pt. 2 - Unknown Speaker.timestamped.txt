[0:00] I'm going to just get right into the
[0:02] voice of Mercy part two and um just say
[0:05] a few things at the outset in order to
[0:07] catch everybody up on the same page but
[0:09] I'm wanting uh to continue in the
[0:12] subject but maybe drop back and just do
[0:13] a little bit U deeper dive on one
[0:16] particular aspect since Wednesday nights
[0:18] I feel affords us that privilege or that
[0:20] opportunity but we know that the house
[0:22] of the Lord as we looked again kind of
[0:23] refreshed this view of the house of the
[0:25] Lord being an image of God's Throne
[0:27] which is in heaven and it was AE figure
[0:30] of Christ and so we're wanting to look
[0:33] at even in using this title the voice of
[0:35] Mercy we're want to know the way to
[0:36] Mercy today how is it that we can
[0:38] receive Mercy in this hour especially
[0:41] considering the scriptures that have
[0:43] been fulfilled in this time and the Very
[0:45] wey and heavy heavy things that brother
[0:47] brandham said take place on these
[0:50] particular events whether it be the open
[0:51] of the seals the revealer of the son of
[0:53] man there's a lot of lines that we could
[0:55] draw on the sand and say oh that's it
[0:56] nobody's been saved since' 63 or
[0:58] nobody's been saved since 77 whatever it
[1:01] is people want to do but I believe that
[1:03] stems from
[1:04] misunderstanding of what's actually
[1:06] transpired and sometimes uh there's just
[1:09] an outside an allout rejection of what's
[1:12] happened because of the scarecrows that
[1:14] come up so we're wanting to look at
[1:16] where the word is today where Christ is
[1:18] today and using this example of the
[1:21] secret place of the Tabernacle this
[1:22] Dwelling Place of God I think it really
[1:25] really helps us to see what God's doing
[1:27] in this hour because it was a throne of
[1:29] Mercy mercy and judgment now we read
[1:33] this on Sunday brother BR makes this
[1:35] statement in Revelation 4 part 2 says
[1:38] first he was in the heavens above and
[1:40] shining in the Stars he say that was his
[1:41] first Throne second he was on Earth
[1:43] shining through the shikina glory that
[1:45] was in the temple and the Tabernacle
[1:47] behind that Veil next he come and was
[1:49] made flesh and dwelt Among Us still
[1:51] wearing his patience that's Christ so
[1:53] you see a throne in heaven then Moses
[1:55] makes a tabernacle the house of the Lord
[1:57] on Earth which is in the image of what
[1:59] he saw in heaven it's the throne room
[2:01] the Throne of God all these different
[2:03] things that we can bring out then God
[2:05] comes and he dwells in the flesh of his
[2:07] son and he's still wearing his patience
[2:09] he's still being longsuffering he said
[2:11] then he redeemed Man by his blood and
[2:13] came into his church in the form of the
[2:15] Holy Ghost he says and speak against
[2:17] that it's a finished thing done and
[2:20] that's a quite a statement we'll read
[2:22] that scripture uh here in a little bit I
[2:24] believe and he says now you can see
[2:26] where the shaking come we're at a time
[2:29] they don't really realize people can't
[2:31] comprehend what it mean and I believe
[2:33] that he's looking at a change in
[2:34] dispensation kind of an accumulation of
[2:37] the wickedness of Le to seea the
[2:38] darkness that has descended upon the
[2:40] world even his own Ministry being a
[2:42] under the spirit of Elijah being a
[2:44] messenger to the church going to be a
[2:47] son of man revealing the son of man the
[2:48] seventh a angel messenger in Revelations
[2:51] 10 uh there's a lot of things
[2:53] transpiring that he knows he's facing
[2:55] and that he knows he's coming up and he
[2:57] says that people don't realize what's
[2:58] happened they can't comprehend what it
[2:59] means he says first Throne was in heaven
[3:01] judgment seat second Throne was in
[3:03] Christ the third Throne is in man so
[3:06] he's bringing out those uh elements of
[3:09] the Throne of judgment or The Mercy Seat
[3:12] and how it's moved how we saw it in the
[3:14] temple in the Tabernacle we see it in
[3:16] Christ and now he says The Mercy Seat
[3:18] today is in the heart of man so that
[3:21] notice again the throne is The Mercy
[3:22] Seat and God's judgment seat or God's
[3:25] judgment throne and Jesus Christ then is
[3:29] one of these
[3:30] uh he's that dwelling place that house
[3:32] of the Lord in there throne in heaven
[3:34] throne in the temple now there throne in
[3:36] Christ then there's a throne in our
[3:37] heart but Jesus Christ became the
[3:39] dwelling place of God and in him we see
[3:42] the perfect image of the Fulfillment of
[3:44] the type of The Mercy Seat in Hebrews
[3:47] 12: 24 it says in Jesus the mediator of
[3:50] the New Covenant and to the blood of
[3:52] sprinkling that speaketh better things
[3:55] than that of Abel on Sunday we were
[3:57] wanting to point out in Scripture and
[4:00] according to the message of the hour how
[4:01] the blood speaks and how it's where that
[4:03] Voice of Truth is and where they're
[4:05] speaking the blood testifying there's
[4:07] where you'll find Mercy and here Christ
[4:10] has become the mediator of a better
[4:12] Testament a better Covenant that speaks
[4:14] better things than the blood of Abel and
[4:17] him being the meteor it's one that comes
[4:18] between two people with differences to
[4:21] remove those differences to bring them
[4:23] together on I want to say on equal
[4:25] footing but an equal understanding it's
[4:28] one who intervenes to make peace peace
[4:29] where there's a
[4:31] dissatisfaction where there's been a
[4:33] breach in a relationship a mediator
[4:34] restores that relationship or a mediator
[4:36] comes and confirms what promises have
[4:38] been made between two parties and and
[4:41] confirms the Covenant and in Job chapter
[4:44] 32: 33 I think this is just per put
[4:47] perfectly for he is not a man as I am
[4:49] that I should answer him and we should
[4:52] come together in judgment he's speaking
[4:53] about God how is it that he is a man
[4:56] that me as a man how can I get God to
[4:58] answer to me
[5:00] how can I get him to uh argue with me or
[5:03] come to my terms he says and we should
[5:05] come together in judgment to decide
[5:07] things to reconcile our differences he
[5:09] says neither is there any daan betwix us
[5:12] that might lay his hand upon us both may
[5:15] seem to be a little bit of an
[5:16] interesting phrase but this daan betwix
[5:19] us or this daan between us is a mediator
[5:22] one that would stand between it's this
[5:24] perfect picture of one who is a mediator
[5:26] stand between two parties and you have
[5:28] this desparate relationship between job
[5:30] who's a man and God who is not a man and
[5:33] and how are those two going to be
[5:34] reconciled how are they going to have a
[5:36] meeting of the minds or resolve
[5:38] differences or come to some sort of
[5:39] agreement on an issue but there's one he
[5:42] says we need somebody to stand between
[5:44] us and put their hands on us both to
[5:47] bring us together in
[5:49] reconciliation and that daysan is Christ
[5:53] this is the one that job knew he needed
[5:55] and in 1 Timothy chap 2 veres 5 and 6 it
[5:59] says for there's one God and one
[6:01] mediator between God and Men boy this
[6:04] will kind of get get some people choked
[6:07] up the man Christ
[6:09] Jesus yeah Read that read that and just
[6:13] make God one like your fingers one or
[6:15] the way the Pentecost does want to make
[6:16] them one not God's not three he's one
[6:19] there's one God and one mediator between
[6:20] God and man and Men the man Christ Jesus
[6:25] and this he says who gave himself Christ
[6:27] Jesus who gave himself a ransom for all
[6:28] to be testified if IED in due time so
[6:32] this this Greek word mediator that's
[6:34] used here that root mesos it's one who's
[6:36] in between in the middle or as the Bible
[6:38] says in the midst in the middle of it's
[6:41] even used in the term midnight it's
[6:42] something that's in the middle of things
[6:44] he is the mediator between God and men
[6:46] and there's only one mediator between
[6:49] God and men and that's Christ he is the
[6:53] so mediator he's the daysan who can
[6:56] stand between two people stand between
[6:58] an Angry God and a Sinner and bring them
[7:00] together and reconcile them in Hebrews
[7:05] 7:22 by so much was Jesus made aurity of
[7:09] a better Testament just uses a little
[7:11] bit different language it's not
[7:12] necessarily an intercessor or a mediator
[7:15] but here it's aurity Christ is the
[7:17] Pledge or the guarantee that all elect
[7:20] will come into eternal life he will be
[7:22] there forever standing there as a
[7:24] mediator to bring every seed into
[7:27] relationship with God Amen because he
[7:29] has by the sacrifice of himself and the
[7:32] shedding of his blood once he's entered
[7:34] into heaven presented himself as a
[7:36] sacrifice and and in that there is no
[7:38] time that's an eternal thing so when a
[7:40] Believer accepts Christ and is
[7:42] identified with this sacrifice that's
[7:45] been met in Christ in the day when he
[7:47] appeared on the day of atonement in the
[7:49] throne room of God in heaven and he is
[7:51] our shity that's a sponsor it means it's
[7:53] under good security or a guarantee a
[7:55] bondsman I know none of us have any uh
[7:58] familiarity with what a bondsman would
[7:59] do but he is the one that gives us a
[8:01] full Assurance of
[8:03] redemption this is his uh this is
[8:07] his this is his position that he is
[8:09] assurity and I would say the New Birth
[8:11] the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the
[8:13] guarantee of our faith the sealing of
[8:16] our faith in that guarantee in that
[8:18] shity so Christ is The Mercy Seat Christ
[8:22] is our
[8:23] mediator it's a special position that he
[8:26] has he is our intercessor and he is a
[8:29] Recon iler and this is the word of life
[8:32] this is the word it's uh we can see this
[8:34] image in the blood I've been studying
[8:37] the token sermon I really would
[8:38] encourage uh th those of us here and in
[8:41] our church to listen to one of the token
[8:43] sermons I've been listening to the one
[8:44] he preached in
[8:45] Jeffersonville September 1st 63 and and
[8:48] listen to it in light of these things
[8:50] we've been studying on mercy and what
[8:53] he's preaching there is what I'm trying
[8:54] to preach here trying to draw from those
[8:56] things to see when brother M's
[8:58] emphasizing the time that we're in when
[9:00] judgment's coming and there's only one
[9:03] place of safety under the blood and it
[9:06] it was the only place you could be saved
[9:07] was under the blood uh and he says to
[9:10] that today is the life that's the token
[9:13] now let's look at Christ and what we
[9:15] want to look at here is and just for
[9:18] we're not going to be lengthy this
[9:20] evening but I want to just look at
[9:22] Christ in this role as the mediator or
[9:25] The Mercy Seat even this voice of Mercy
[9:28] in the sermon the unveiling of God this
[9:30] is June 14th 1964 I would encourage this
[9:33] one to be one uh that you would listen
[9:35] to I've got a whole list of sermons uh
[9:38] that I've been putting together of kind
[9:39] of like a chronological listening uh
[9:42] list just to see these themes in great
[9:45] great detail in the message of the hour
[9:48] and we talk about uh the fullness of
[9:50] redemption and a and the interceding
[9:53] over ignorance that when the full word
[9:55] comes into manifestation and you have an
[9:57] absolute then God can't make an EXC
[9:59] excuse if the absolute's rejected so you
[10:01] could just begin with the absolute that
[10:03] brother Brandon preacher he just calls
[10:04] it uh absolute and then just start there
[10:07] and there's so many different sermons
[10:08] you can see where brother B I'm standing
[10:10] in the Gap why because he knows
[10:11] judgment's coming a and people aren't
[10:14] ready and he's preaching the flashing
[10:15] red lights of the signs of his coming he
[10:17] and he brings us right to the Third
[10:19] Exodus which is where we are in the
[10:20] token and then he preaches the
[10:21] indictment God doesn't call man to
[10:23] judgment without first warning him and
[10:25] then Christ is the mystery of God
[10:26] revealed there's only one provided way
[10:28] God only have one provided Ed way H uh
[10:30] perfect Faith the token desperations
[10:33] Souls that are in prison now there's a
[10:36] man here who can turn on the light
[10:38] Shalom and those different messages that
[10:39] go with that theme and turn on the light
[10:41] then he preaches a trial he preaches it
[10:43] more than once and so you can see this
[10:45] theme of things unfolding through there
[10:47] and then he preaches and there's several
[10:49] other sermons mixed in here the
[10:51] unveiling of God and the unveiling of
[10:53] God is just before he preaches the
[10:55] presence of God unrecognized God has
[10:57] provided a lamb to the trumpets
[11:00] recognizing your day in its message The
[11:02] God Who is rich in Mercy these are all
[11:04] Talent this is a theme that brother Bram
[11:07] is laying out a beautiful picture that
[11:08] he's seeing and he's trying to minister
[11:10] to us and the the Mighty God unveiled
[11:13] before us or here the unveiling of God
[11:14] is such a tremendous sermon to really
[11:17] consider because it's these things he's
[11:19] preaching that summer that causes him to
[11:22] make statements of the next few months
[11:23] that c that make people think who what's
[11:25] going on and that's why you have four
[11:27] services on question and answers because
[11:29] of these things that he's preaching of
[11:30] course there's a lot of questions about
[11:32] what kind of pajamas should I wear and
[11:33] what honey should I use in my oatmeal
[11:35] but a lot of the questions revolved
[11:37] around things that he says in these
[11:38] sermons I don't think there's a question
[11:40] about honey in your oatmeal that was
[11:41] just
[11:42] me uh riffing a little bit but notice he
[11:44] says when that veil was rent on the day
[11:46] of crucifixion so you can just start
[11:48] thinking about this text that we've read
[11:50] um and we could have read in other
[11:52] places that at this critical moment
[11:54] there was an earthquake and the veil of
[11:55] the temple was written too and what did
[11:57] they say there's no Ark there's no blood
[11:59] on the The Mercy Seat this has all been
[12:02] a facade it's gone it's over but despite
[12:05] its limits and despite what was missing
[12:07] there was still Mercy up to that moment
[12:11] so he says when that veil was rent on
[12:12] the day of crucifixion the veil that was
[12:13] wrapped it was rent on the day of
[12:15] crucifixion the whole Mercy Seat came
[12:18] into view now the Jews could not
[12:20] understand how that God could have mercy
[12:21] upon a sinful foul people like we are
[12:23] that would be Gentiles but they couldn't
[12:26] see this one who is giving Mercy because
[12:28] he was hid he's hid but he's right there
[12:30] in plain view but they don't lack he's
[12:33] there for their eyes to see but they
[12:35] don't have that understanding he was
[12:36] behind the mercy seat on the inside with
[12:39] Badger skins hanging down covering him
[12:42] before if any man walked in behind that
[12:43] Veil it was sudden death he says we're
[12:45] going to get a lesson here in a minute
[12:47] if you can receive it to walk behind
[12:50] them skins even one of the priest son
[12:51] tried to do it one time and died don't
[12:53] go behind that Veil the man that walked
[12:56] behind why there was no Redemption yet
[12:58] in that right so you couldn't go through
[13:00] that curtain into the shikina glory and
[13:03] the life of that blood on the altar
[13:04] being that of a bull or a lamb or
[13:06] mingled blood or whatever it would have
[13:07] been that can't come back upon the
[13:09] believer uh and to protect them in that
[13:12] moment so you couldn't enter into the
[13:14] veil because there was no redemption in
[13:16] the shadow it was potentially it was
[13:19] just potential and anything potential is
[13:21] not the real thing yet just potentially
[13:24] it was Redemption sin covered not
[13:27] remitted remitted is divorced and put
[13:30] away and so the blood of sheep and goats
[13:32] could not do that so Jehovah was hid
[13:34] behind a veil now back behind this Veil
[13:36] where he was hid to enter into that a
[13:39] man dropped dead to try to enter into it
[13:40] I brother Brams In this passage we're
[13:42] just reading through it it's kind of
[13:43] repeating these things alternating them
[13:46] he says but since Pentecost since the
[13:48] crucifixion when that veil was rent from
[13:51] the top to the bottom for that
[13:53] generation now it's important to look at
[13:55] for that generation when this event
[13:56] happens Everything Changes it's a new
[14:00] dispensation that this is for them they
[14:02] could have said they could have stood
[14:03] there and said hey you were fine under
[14:05] bulls and goats you were fine under
[14:06] these you were fine under that but
[14:08] that's all been changed recently this is
[14:10] recently changed well when when Christ
[14:12] was crucified and you're a worship was
[14:15] exposed as bloodless Christ became the
[14:17] mercy seat so it says that veil was rent
[14:20] from top to bottom for that generation
[14:22] Jesus was that God veiled and when he
[14:24] died at Calvary God sent fire and
[14:27] lightning ripped that Veil from top to
[14:28] the bottom that the whole Mercy Seat was
[14:30] in plain view but they were too blind to
[14:33] see it as Paul said about reading of
[14:35] Moses when Moses is read yet that Veil
[14:37] is still on their heart I could listen
[14:39] for the statement oh brother sister
[14:42] that's what the Jews did when the veil
[14:44] was rent and brought God into Plain View
[14:46] hanging on the cross he was in plain
[14:49] view but they could not see
[14:51] it what was on the cross what was
[14:54] bleeding The Mercy Seat the perpetuation
[14:57] that lid that covers a a that symbol
[15:00] what was symbolized in the most holy
[15:02] place is now literally being fulfilled
[15:05] there on that rock or on that on that
[15:07] mountain on that
[15:10] cross there it is deity hung upon
[15:15] wood bleeding for us a mercy seat lifted
[15:20] up not between two cherabin but between
[15:22] two
[15:24] thieves what an image so as he's hanging
[15:27] there on the cross this is the mercy
[15:29] seek Christ Our mediator intercessor
[15:31] this reconciler this
[15:33] shity this is this a very uh
[15:37] simple lesson but it's it's tied to such
[15:40] deep things or critical things important
[15:42] things in the message of the hour so
[15:44] here in verse 33 these sayings upon the
[15:46] cross are very weighty and his words
[15:48] were very limited so Luke 23:33 and when
[15:51] they were com into the place which is
[15:52] called Calvary There They Crucified him
[15:56] and the malifa these two thieves one on
[15:58] the right hand and the other on the left
[16:01] now we're going to read some things in
[16:03] verses 35 to 37 but this is what Jesus
[16:06] says in response to these events that
[16:08] are transpiring around them Father
[16:10] forgive them for they know not what they
[16:13] do here they've crucified him and this
[16:17] is what they're doing they parted his
[16:18] reignment and cash lots and the people
[16:20] stood beholding and the rulers also with
[16:22] them derided him the people the rulers
[16:25] are saying he saved others why can't he
[16:27] save himself let him save himself if he
[16:30] be Christ The Chosen of God they're
[16:32] mocking him and the soldiers also mocked
[16:36] him coming to him and offering him
[16:38] vinegar and saying if thou be the king
[16:40] of the Jews save thyself and they made
[16:43] sure it was printed in all the tongues
[16:44] so everyone would know in this sarcastic
[16:46] mocking tone in verse 38 here he is King
[16:49] of the
[16:50] Jews so while all this is taking place
[16:53] below him at his feet there on the on
[16:57] Calvary that day Jesus intercedes for
[17:00] the ignorance of the people no matter
[17:02] how nasty it was no matter how cruel it
[17:04] was no how much they derided him and
[17:06] mocked him he said father forgive their
[17:09] ignorance now I'm not misreading that
[17:12] father forgive them for they don't know
[17:13] what they're doing forgive them for
[17:15] their
[17:16] ignorance while this is while he's in
[17:18] plain view this is while he's bleeding
[17:22] this is while his some of his last words
[17:24] before he can before he dies he has to
[17:27] still remain ever that lamb that
[17:29] intercessor or here this one who had
[17:31] intercede for ignorance and he's making
[17:34] intercession for the
[17:36] guilty primarily the ignorant and you
[17:39] can see why the Bible says in Acts 17:30
[17:42] in the times of this ignorance God
[17:44] winked
[17:45] at because here they are mocking him
[17:48] deriding him crucifying him and Jesus
[17:50] doesn't say 10,000 angels come lightning
[17:54] lightning shuck and tore the veil of the
[17:55] temple Why didn't it just strike all
[17:56] those knuckleheads deriding him I mean
[17:59] is that what we would have done in that
[18:00] situation oh you don't think I'm the
[18:01] Christ the son of living God I'll show
[18:03] you right we would have had a lot of
[18:04] things we would have wanted to
[18:06] do but it says God winked at their
[18:08] ignorance the old Covenant winking even
[18:11] all through the Old Testament those
[18:12] things stood as a temporary atonement
[18:15] pointing to Christ who had come and
[18:18] redeem all the Seed of
[18:20] Abraham at this time of this ignorance
[18:23] God weak De Jesus even points to it in
[18:25] Mark chapter
[18:27] 3: 28 to
[18:34] 30 be sure I've got my right scripture
[18:36] here nobody else is turning in their
[18:39] Bibles I'm the only one flipping Pages
[18:43] here hope now all the
[18:49] dust so here he says verily I say unto
[18:52] you there's a lot here about a kingdom
[18:54] being divided against itself and how
[18:56] they were D they're calling him beel
[18:58] he's unclean and so he deals with uh how
[19:02] their statements are uh ridiculous
[19:05] because Satan's wouldn't be divided
[19:06] against himself he says verily I say
[19:08] unto you all sins shall be forgiven Unto
[19:10] the Sons of men in blasphemies wherewith
[19:14] soever they shall blaspheme now
[19:16] blasphemy that's that one of those heavy
[19:18] words right oh you blasphemed the Holy
[19:21] Ghost you're lost and if you blaspheming
[19:23] blaspheme is a pretty uh a pretty heavy
[19:26] weighty word and the blaspheming means
[19:28] to speak evil blashe means to slander to
[19:32] detract from something it's injured
[19:34] speech speech that inur injures and so I
[19:37] believe that would be slander lials in
[19:39] print slander in spoken is that right am
[19:41] I getting this right somebody ask a
[19:43] lawyer and so here there can be all
[19:46] sorts of blasphemies he says but he that
[19:48] shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost
[19:50] hath never forgiveness but is in danger
[19:53] of Eternal damnation because they said
[19:56] he hath an unclean Spirit Jesus saying
[19:59] they all sins shall be forgiven under
[20:01] the sons of men and these blasphemies
[20:03] that they're speaking even about
[20:05] Jesus and it's a paradox even about
[20:08] Christ they can speak evil of they can
[20:10] say things that are inous that can
[20:12] detract from his reality who he really
[20:14] is they can water down the truth they
[20:15] can lie about the truth they can lie
[20:17] about Christ they can lie about um him
[20:20] even as he hangs upon the cross he says
[20:22] father forgive them for their ignorance
[20:24] they don't know what they're doing and
[20:26] God will forgive the sins of them even
[20:29] if it be
[20:30] blasphemy but to blaspheme the Holy
[20:33] Ghost they are in danger of Eternal
[20:36] damnation have NE never forgiveness now
[20:39] so that it puts us that there is
[20:41] something where you can cross the line
[20:43] then we have Paul in first Timothy 1113
[20:45] he says of himself I was a blasphemer
[20:47] and a persecutor and injures but I
[20:50] obtained Mercy because I did it
[20:52] ignorantly in unbelief here's that theme
[20:55] where brother man said the Holy Ghost
[20:56] interceding over the ignorance of the
[20:58] people Christ that Son of God that role
[21:01] that he plays over the ignorance Paul
[21:03] himself is set forth as an example I
[21:05] believe first verse 15 tells us that
[21:08] that I was I I I'm an example of how
[21:10] someone could know everything about the
[21:11] law know everything about the one true
[21:13] God know everything about Christ and
[21:15] even the message and the word and still
[21:17] miss it and that God did that so that
[21:20] when the Revelation came when I received
[21:23] it there was a mercy for me though I
[21:26] blasphemed and persecuted and murdered
[21:28] and injured I did not face the Judgment
[21:31] of Eternal damnation because God forgave
[21:33] me I found forgiveness in Christ he says
[21:36] I obtained
[21:38] mercy so here's Christ hanging upon the
[21:41] cross The Mercy Seat in plain view it's
[21:44] life soon is going to be leaving him and
[21:46] he stands there bleeding with arms
[21:47] stretched wide saying father forgive
[21:50] them for their ignorance forgive them
[21:53] for even crucifying me hold that in your
[21:55] minds we'll come back to it here in a
[21:57] moment
[21:59] but verse 39 to verse 43 and one of the
[22:01] malifa which were hanged railed on him
[22:04] saying if thou be Christ save thyself
[22:06] and us so he's he's joining in on the
[22:10] sarcasm and the snark I guess maybe
[22:12] sarcasm really Waters it down just the
[22:14] this nasty
[22:17] deriding and the other Thief hears it
[22:20] and says he rebukes this other malifa do
[22:24] you not fear God you are in the same
[22:27] condemnation
[22:29] you're hanging on the cross you're going
[22:31] to die and you're going to rebuke him he
[22:33] goes and we hang we're hanging there
[22:35] dying justly we indeed justly for we
[22:38] receive the due reward of our
[22:40] Deeds he says but this man has done
[22:44] nothing wrong well here's he's
[22:46] recognizing something he's seeing
[22:48] through the lies he's seeing through the
[22:51] condemnation I mean do you realize just
[22:53] how easy it would be kind of like the
[22:54] guy guys's in prison and they says what
[22:56] are you in here for go oh well I didn't
[22:57] do it and everybody's like
[22:59] yeah yeah none of us did anything yeah
[23:01] we're all here cuz we're innocent and
[23:03] you could just imagine a thief hanging
[23:05] on the cross is like I know I'm guilty
[23:07] and I'm pretty sure they wouldn't just
[23:08] crucify an innocent guy he must have
[23:10] done something to deserve these nails
[23:13] and yet he sees through the lies he
[23:15] ceases the cobbling together of this
[23:17] detraction and he says Jesus unto Jesus
[23:20] Lord remember me when thou comest into
[23:23] thy kingdom it's not just recognizing
[23:25] the innocent of a a citizen or one who's
[23:28] been false accused but Lord Master the
[23:31] king remember me you are King they can
[23:34] mock you they can deride you they can
[23:35] put all sorts of false inscriptions but
[23:37] here in with my last breath I want to
[23:40] declare that you are the king and when
[23:42] you come into your kingdom remember me
[23:45] amen and Jesus said unto him verily I
[23:47] say unto thee today shalt thou be with
[23:50] me in Paradise now I'm not trying to
[23:53] make a technical distinction but I would
[23:54] want you to recognize two different
[23:56] things that transpire very near each
[23:58] other in one instance he's interceding
[24:00] over the ignorance of the people that
[24:02] are crucifying him and now he's not just
[24:05] interceding but he's mediating and
[24:07] reconciling one who stands condemned and
[24:09] dying as a sinner and if he with that
[24:12] breath leaves in this moment he could
[24:15] face Eternal damnation but God there re
[24:19] honors the the sacrifice in Christ
[24:22] imparts eternal life to the thief dying
[24:25] on the cross I want you to really think
[24:28] think about that go listen to that day
[24:29] on Calvary really weigh what's happening
[24:31] with this Christ is dying on the cross
[24:33] he sees a bunch of people who are
[24:35] ignorant and hateful and spiteful and
[24:37] blaspheming he says father forgive them
[24:39] for they know not what they do Lord be
[24:42] merciful to them let it not be this
[24:44] blasphemy that would result in death and
[24:46] eternal damnation forgive them for they
[24:48] know not what they do and in the face of
[24:49] all that here's one who confesses them
[24:52] and he doesn't say well father forgive
[24:53] him for his ignorance he he doesn't want
[24:54] to do that he's not ignorant anymore but
[24:57] he asked for Mercy he asked for to be
[24:59] remembered Remember Me this is what job
[25:01] prayed oh that you would remember me in
[25:03] a time of judgment in the
[25:05] end hide me till your wrath be over
[25:07] paath past but then remember me today
[25:10] you'll be with me this is what the
[25:12] Throne of Mercy does it makes a way to
[25:15] life into life his brother B was saying
[25:19] a moment ago the old Covenant covered
[25:22] sins the New Covenant remits
[25:25] sins Christ is remitting the sins of the
[25:28] the thief on the cross this is exactly
[25:30] what's happening I realize there's this
[25:32] dispensation that's transpiring at this
[25:34] time where the I I know there's some
[25:38] that make the argument that the thief
[25:40] dying upon the cross invalidates the
[25:42] necessity to be
[25:43] baptized I think you got to be careful
[25:45] what kind of platitudes you you you make
[25:48] uh when you see this instance and so I'm
[25:50] not I'm not just being loose and playing
[25:52] loose with this I recognize there you
[25:53] don't want to go too far and make it out
[25:55] to be well all you got to do is just say
[25:57] Lord remember me don't need to be
[25:58] baptized does need you to be changed but
[26:00] it's here as an example showing it's the
[26:02] power of the one who is covered in the
[26:05] blood the one who had the blood of God
[26:07] this is uh the Son of God he says you
[26:09] will be with me in Paradise imp Parts
[26:11] life he remits this thief sins he pleads
[26:15] Christ in this singular moment he's
[26:17] pleading for mercy on the ignorant and
[26:20] grants life to that who's in the one
[26:22] who's enlightened the one who
[26:24] sees and remember in Acts chapter 17
[26:28] verse
[26:29] 30 at the times of this ignorance God
[26:31] winked at what was the second part but
[26:34] now commandeth all men everywhere to
[26:36] repent so there's a winking at ignorance
[26:39] that works for a season but then there
[26:41] comes a time where it's not like you can
[26:43] say well I mean look he said father
[26:44] forgive them for they know not what they
[26:46] do so there's just this imp
[26:49] perpetuity of
[26:51] winking because you're ignorant and
[26:53] someone say well you know that this is
[26:55] right you know this is true yeah but you
[26:57] know what uh he Winks at our ignorance
[26:59] or I escaped this and he forgave me for
[27:01] that and there's this idea well this
[27:02] will just always remain but no he says
[27:04] now I'm commanding everywhere to
[27:05] everyone to repent so let's see how this
[27:08] works in Acts chapter
[27:10] 2 verses
[27:13] 36-39 thank you everyone for being wide
[27:15] awake tonight and amen and get behind
[27:18] the
[27:19] word God just made sure the people who
[27:21] showed up tonight were
[27:23] awake got their energy drinks in right
[27:26] before service everybody's be wired not
[27:28] be able to go to bed tonight I
[27:30] appreciate
[27:32] it acts 2: 36-39 therefore let all this
[27:36] is Peter preaching on the day of
[27:37] Pentecost one thing to think about which
[27:39] is remarkable is there already been a
[27:41] great deal of commotion and speaking in
[27:42] tongues and things happening right it's
[27:44] already been the spirit of God's poured
[27:46] out and they're they're starting to uh
[27:48] manifest in this excitement and this
[27:50] Zeal and it's kind of causing people to
[27:52] ask questions and then Peter preaches
[27:54] this sermon this inaugural sermon on the
[27:56] church the day that the church is born
[27:58] and he's he's preaching and this is one
[28:00] of his concluding statements or this is
[28:02] his concluding statement therefore let
[28:04] all the house of Israel know
[28:06] assuredly that God hath made that same
[28:09] Jesus whom you have crucified both Lord
[28:12] and Christ
[28:13] guilty he has just indicted them for
[28:16] crucifying Jesus Christ it's already
[28:19] happened he's died he shed the blood he
[28:21] went to the Grave he rose he's ascended
[28:23] into heaven and now Peter says you've
[28:25] crucified him
[28:28] this Jesus whom you have crucified God
[28:31] has made him Lord and Christ and notice
[28:34] what happens now if we could just
[28:36] dramatize and speculate and you might
[28:38] say well let's just run the numbers ask
[28:40] chat GPT you know what's the probability
[28:43] that someone who was there that day on
[28:44] Calvary deriding Christ was there uh uh
[28:47] on the day of Pentecost there in
[28:48] Jerusalem and let's just uh think that
[28:51] maybe there's one guy who is there
[28:53] mocking Christ and there he stands in
[28:57] Acts chapter 2 hearing this and all of a
[28:59] sudden he
[29:01] realizes when he said father forgive
[29:03] them for they know not what they do that
[29:05] was
[29:06] me I crucified the Lord Of Glory I I
[29:09] have blood on my hands it says now when
[29:11] they heard this they were pricked in
[29:13] their heart it said unto Peter and to
[29:15] the rest of the Apostles men and
[29:16] Brethren what shall we do they knew they
[29:18] were guilty they didn't say wouldn't
[29:22] me and then Peter said unto them
[29:26] repent you say well how just just a
[29:29] little bit
[29:30] ago just there so many days ago what is
[29:33] it 50 days or whatever just just some
[29:34] time
[29:36] ago God was winking forgive them they
[29:40] don't know what they're doing and Peter
[29:42] doesn't repeat the
[29:44] Mantra he doesn't say oh uh listen while
[29:49] you had cruci while you were crucifying
[29:51] and why you were there mocking him and
[29:53] deriding him as he was hanging on the
[29:54] cross he said father forgive them for
[29:57] they don't know what they do
[29:58] so there's still Mercy for your
[30:00] ignorance he he's Still the Lamb on the
[30:03] throne he's still on The Mercy Seat
[30:06] today interceding for your ignorance he
[30:08] says
[30:10] repent it's exactly what he says repent
[30:13] be baptized every one of you in the name
[30:14] of Jesus Christ for the remission of
[30:16] sins it's not the baptism that remits
[30:19] your sins but it's the repenting and
[30:21] believing in the shity and your faith in
[30:24] the shity that your sins have been
[30:25] remitted it's what the thief on the
[30:27] cross said he said oh we hang here
[30:30] justly he is innocent Lord God remember
[30:34] me King Jesus Remember me when you come
[30:37] into your kingdom says repent and for
[30:40] the remission of sins be
[30:42] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and
[30:45] you shall receive the gift of the Holy
[30:46] Ghost that's the Seal of your faith for
[30:48] the promises unto you and to your
[30:49] children and all that are far off even
[30:51] as many as the Lord Our God shall
[30:53] call the voice of Mercy is The Voice of
[30:56] Truth amen if Peter was to go back to
[30:59] Luke Chapter uh 23 and saywell father
[31:02] forgive them for they know not what they
[31:03] do it wouldn't have been it wouldn't
[31:05] have been timely right but he had to
[31:09] speak the truth and if you reject that
[31:12] there's nothing left but
[31:13] judgment so on the cross at that time
[31:16] he's hanging there this Mercy seat's
[31:18] hanging there there's forgiveness for
[31:20] ignorance for that
[31:22] generation but now it's either
[31:24] repentance or
[31:26] rejection now that they've heard the
[31:28] word and Peter says that one you
[31:30] crucified God has made him Lord in
[31:32] Christ and then the response is well
[31:33] what what can we do says you have to
[31:35] repent for doing it repent of your sins
[31:38] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[31:40] you shall receive the gift of the Holy
[31:43] Ghost now I'm going to pick up in the
[31:46] unveiling of God the very same place we
[31:49] were just
[31:49] reading oh brother sister that's what
[31:52] the Jews did when the veil was rent and
[31:54] brought God into Plain View hanging on
[31:55] the cross he was in plain view but they
[31:58] couldn't see it everybody listening I
[32:01] speak too soon about
[32:03] sleeping could it be possible that the
[32:05] Gentiles have done the same
[32:08] thing when
[32:11] then now
[32:13] what could it be possible that the
[32:15] Gentiles he says has did the same thing
[32:18] could it be that the Gentiles are guilty
[32:22] of crucifying Jesus Christ and God has
[32:25] revealed him in plain view right he says
[32:29] oh God when they've had the church ages
[32:32] of the Son of God but when
[32:36] now Church ages of the Son of God here
[32:40] he is the Holy Ghost revealed himself as
[32:41] a Son of God through seven Church ages
[32:43] but in the end before he's son of David
[32:44] in the Millennium he reveals himself as
[32:46] what the son of men this is a judgment
[32:49] dispensation that comes Son of God
[32:51] through the church ages but then when
[32:53] denominations are rejected and God
[32:55] Christ is kicked out of the church and
[32:57] he stands on the outside of the seven
[32:58] Church ages right now there's a prophet
[33:02] standing there ministering an entrance
[33:04] into fellowship with Jesus Christ again
[33:06] because he can't be found in
[33:08] denominations this is his theme in the
[33:10] Feast of the trumpets and these
[33:11] different sermons he's preaching could
[33:13] it be possible they've done the same
[33:14] thing they've had the church ages of the
[33:16] Son of God but now the veil of
[33:18] denominations and things this veil of
[33:20] traditions that we've got since
[33:21] Pentecost when the church Traditions
[33:23] have been
[33:24] rent and there was even a continued veil
[33:27] of tradition
[33:28] since Pentecost you could say back at
[33:30] the beginning of church but even in Lea
[33:32] which represents Pentecost again the
[33:35] things that the people said days of
[33:36] Miracles has passed in these things God
[33:38] has taken the veil off of it and brought
[33:41] it in plain view and they're ready to
[33:43] crucified again just exactly
[33:46] like here it is in plain view just
[33:50] exactly what the Jews did to their
[33:52] Messiah he said it's happening today the
[33:54] same thing's happening today he said
[33:56] well that's wa we didn't see a physical
[33:58] Messiah you're saying brother brandham
[33:59] was that was it brother brandham is that
[34:01] who was no our mate is the revealed word
[34:05] the promises to the Jews are physical
[34:07] they were promised a physical Messiah
[34:09] the bride was promised the revelation of
[34:11] Jesus Christ revelation of who God is
[34:15] God cannot be seen with eyes God can
[34:18] only be touched and felt and known by
[34:21] his Divine communication which is
[34:23] revelation it's not in the flesh and so
[34:26] this is the moment that God has been
[34:27] building too to reveal himself who he is
[34:30] to a bride that will love him for who he
[34:32] is not the flesh not after the
[34:37] flesh so he says now he's being revealed
[34:40] and what are they doing they're
[34:41] crucifying him
[34:43] again now where my real wrestling's
[34:47] today and I think I took paid a real
[34:49] price just in my spirit trying to find
[34:51] uh which direction to go at this
[34:53] moment and I I want to read a statement
[34:56] from the indictment and we probably cut
[34:58] this a little bit short there's a lot a
[34:59] lot here for you to chew
[35:01] on but in the indictment if you follow
[35:04] the trajectory of some of these sermons
[35:06] we've read this is July 7th
[35:09] 1963 and he's preaching the indictment
[35:12] so all these things should just start
[35:13] kind of wow I mean we're like we're just
[35:16] tracking these things that he's
[35:17] preaching there uh at the at in
[35:20] Jeffersonville even say he's preached
[35:22] the Third Exodus now he's preaching the
[35:24] indictment why because it's the Third
[35:26] Exodus judgment
[35:29] striking and he says what are you going
[35:31] to do about it stay out there in your
[35:34] Creeds stay out there in your dogmas and
[35:36] die you are
[35:41] guilty with Wicked hands you've taken
[35:43] the Prince of Life The Word of Life and
[35:45] crucified it to the people now what did
[35:47] they do now this is days of Christ he's
[35:49] saying today what are you going to do
[35:51] about it you're going to stay in
[35:52] denominations they're guilty of
[35:53] crucifying them if I could put it in the
[35:55] words of Peter this message what you
[35:57] have crucified is Jesus
[36:01] Christ and the answer should be well
[36:03] then what should we do what do we need
[36:05] to do well then he preaches the
[36:07] token says why this is the sermon that
[36:09] needed to follow the seals why because
[36:12] this is what you need to avoid it the
[36:14] Judgment he says now what did they do
[36:16] they didn't know it today men walk
[36:19] ignorantly they don't know that's the
[36:20] truth they think it's some kind of ism
[36:22] they don't dig down deep enough to get
[36:24] into the spirit of Revelation they don't
[36:25] pray enough they don't call upon God
[36:27] enough they just lightly take it oh well
[36:29] I believe there's a God sure now go
[36:31] listen to the Token brother BR brings it
[36:33] right down to us message believers who
[36:35] will agree with everything the prophet
[36:36] says say what the tape say believe
[36:39] believe the prophet brother man goes
[36:40] into great detail about how much you
[36:42] could follow the messenger how much you
[36:43] could believe in the prophet how much
[36:44] you could believe the message and
[36:45] believe the message and you know what
[36:47] it's almost as if he knows where we're
[36:49] going to be in this end time and he says
[36:51] a lot about take
[36:53] boys and we're like yeah in your house I
[36:58] don't have to go to church anymore and
[37:00] he says you can do all that but if you
[37:02] don't get under the
[37:04] token he says you don't call upon God
[37:06] enough you don't like you just lightly
[37:07] take it oh I believe I believe he said
[37:10] well there I believe there's a God sure
[37:11] the devil believes the same thing the
[37:14] devil believes it more than some people
[37:15] claim to believe it the devil believes
[37:17] it and trembles people just believe it
[37:19] and go on but the devil trembles knowing
[37:22] his judgment is
[37:25] coming I I realized Maybe now it's not
[37:28] uh I'm trying to remember just maybe
[37:30] it's in the uh in the token brother says
[37:32] Luther knew it was coming Wesley knew it
[37:34] was coming they all knew something was
[37:36] coming here people they know judgment is
[37:40] coming and people believe it and don't
[37:41] pay no attention the judgment is coming
[37:44] guilty of crucifying him sure I indict
[37:48] this
[37:49] generation and then I love finding them
[37:52] guilty wait what happened to my trial he
[37:55] indicts him and finds them guilty I
[37:58] indict this generation finding them
[38:00] Guilty by the same word that found them
[38:02] guilty at the beginning that's right
[38:04] Jesus said who can condemn me he was the
[38:06] word made flesh and today the same word
[38:09] is made
[38:11] flesh go listen to the trial God told me
[38:13] that 33 years ago it's fulfilled right
[38:15] here this afternoon God keeps his word
[38:17] he's the same yesterday today and
[38:19] forever what is the very Christ that he
[38:22] was sent to point to they've crucified
[38:25] him and these are some statements he
[38:27] says after this he says we can't do
[38:28] nothing else but head for judgment we're
[38:30] already
[38:32] there we're already there to judgment
[38:34] that's why he can indict them and find
[38:35] them guilty don't have to do any kind of
[38:38] Discovery can't do any kind of pre-trial
[38:40] motions no jury selection why because in
[38:43] the token he says the very judge became
[38:44] our Advocate our
[38:47] attorney and so having been rejected God
[38:51] said would you like me to appoint
[38:52] counsel for you I don't need a counsel
[38:55] he's like all right fine I won't
[38:56] represent you I find you guilty
[39:00] he says therefore the time for
[39:01] repentance for nation is a nation is
[39:04] gone I believe that this nation can
[39:06] never be great
[39:09] again no he says I believe that this
[39:11] nation cannot repent you all are
[39:13] thinking how do we miss
[39:14] that
[39:18] like I believe that this nation cannot
[39:21] repent I believe it's cross the line
[39:23] between mercy and judgment I believe
[39:25] she's toddling in the balance
[39:30] he says if this generation has rejected
[39:31] the same Mercy that was spurned in them
[39:33] days God would be unjust to let them get
[39:35] by without
[39:36] judgment judgment judgment judgment
[39:38] judgment and so then he comes to the end
[39:40] he's praying listen to the prayer he
[39:41] prays in this and he's like I plead for
[39:43] Mercy for the
[39:45] people and he starts pleading for God's
[39:47] mercy the souls that are in prison now
[39:49] what is he saying God please don't let
[39:51] it be too
[39:52] late he's looking at these events and
[39:55] he's seeing the type in the day of the
[39:56] Christ first pull second pull third pull
[39:59] he's seeing him being rejected and
[40:00] crucified he sees that he's amongst the
[40:02] people for a period of time that he
[40:04] ascends into heaven and the day of
[40:05] Pentecost it was repent repent repent
[40:07] Jesus sees this pattern unfolding and
[40:09] he's thinking oh God forgive them for
[40:11] they don't know what they're doing oh
[40:13] what where where are we living could the
[40:15] door be shut really soon so why is he
[40:17] saying Lord forgive them people walk
[40:19] ignorantly he's saying please forgive
[40:21] him God have mercy because ignorance
[40:23] would no longer be an
[40:25] excuse he was changing from father
[40:27] forgive them for they know not what they
[40:29] do father forgive them for their
[40:30] ignorance too
[40:33] repent now when I I'd like to see this
[40:38] go look into what the Greater Works
[40:41] are a part of that Greater Works that
[40:43] the bride's supposed to be doing that
[40:44] the Christ body is supposed to be doing
[40:47] at a time where it looks as if judgment
[40:48] is absolutely
[40:50] certain will there be a voice on Earth
[40:52] that says Lord forgive
[40:54] them and not just I mean I think today
[40:58] this kind of idea of apply the token to
[41:00] your family is merely
[41:02] covering right I'm just going to hide
[41:04] the fact that my children have rejected
[41:06] the message of the hour and I'm just
[41:07] going to apply the token on them and we
[41:08] won't even go to church we want to
[41:10] offend them you know we'll just pret we
[41:12] just believe and apply the
[41:14] token and it's so far from what the
[41:17] applying the token
[41:19] means so far from what Mercy is I don't
[41:22] know why I haven't been able to get to
[41:23] it but I've had this just some
[41:24] scriptures together showing that Mercy
[41:27] is not a
[41:28] pushover Mercy is not being willfully
[41:32] ignorant about the ignorance of the
[41:33] people Mercy is calling exactly for what
[41:35] it is and saying they're ignorant and
[41:37] they're facing Eternal damnation father
[41:38] just forgive them and that Mercy as it
[41:41] moves would say do you realize you need
[41:44] God's help you need God's
[41:47] grace and so here we are he says could
[41:49] it be that the Gentiles have done the
[41:51] same
[41:52] thing that they're so blind miserable
[41:55] and wretched
[41:57] that they don't realize they're
[41:58] rejecting Christ they don't realize here
[42:00] they are religious have need of nothing
[42:03] and don't realize Christ isn't with them
[42:05] anymore that their worship has been
[42:07] exposed as less bloodless christless s
[42:12] zi says they'll go on thinking they're
[42:14] going on worshiping Satan thinking
[42:16] they're worshiping God why because
[42:18] Christ isn't in that
[42:20] anymore he that one time that was okay
[42:22] at one time that was fine and he might
[42:24] have received worship through that
[42:26] because he's winking there's a H an
[42:28] interceder I think we'll get into this
[42:29] sometime soon is an interceder means
[42:32] he'll hit the mark when you can't so
[42:34] it's like making up the difference make
[42:36] up the difference finally gets to that
[42:37] PL place where there's no more Shadow
[42:39] it's like I can't make up any more
[42:40] difference you've got to come to
[42:44] me so here we are in the Le Dean age and
[42:48] when he calls him out for being blind
[42:49] and miserable and wretched and he's been
[42:51] rejected what does he say in verse 19
[42:53] Revelations 3:19 as many as I love I
[42:54] rebuke and chasen be jealous therefore
[42:57] and repent the Zeal of this age is to
[43:01] repent there has to be repentance why is
[43:03] it all of a sudden be zealous therefore
[43:05] and repent why are they called to repent
[43:07] now because the times of ignorance are
[43:11] over right there's no partial anymore so
[43:15] it says you have to repent men and
[43:17] Brethren you're guilty of crucifying the
[43:20] Lord Of Glory well what can we do repent
[43:22] and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[43:23] Christ and here at the end time he says
[43:27] as many as I love I rebuke and Chase I'm
[43:28] counseling you I'm telling you this is
[43:30] what you need to do be zealous therefore
[43:31] and repent and here's our here's our
[43:34] repentance behold I stand at the door
[43:36] and knock If any man will hear my voice
[43:40] and open the door I will come into him
[43:42] and will Su with him and he with me am
[43:45] the supping is that communion the
[43:47] speaking
[43:48] amen he's interceded through the church
[43:51] ages as a lamb the token brother bam
[43:54] saying I know I'm maybe giving some
[43:56] things away here and maybe not getting
[43:57] into much detail but in the the token
[43:59] he's saying it was the lamb in Luther it
[44:01] was the lamb in Wesley was always the
[44:04] lamb but
[44:06] now he's saying we've entered he's using
[44:08] it as a type now we've entered a time a
[44:10] moment in the evening time the death
[44:12] Angels passing and the lamb which has
[44:15] been kept you must have the
[44:19] life he's interceded through the church
[44:21] ages brother brand I'm
[44:23] saying but when the veil is broke the
[44:25] veil is rent and everything things
[44:27] exposed now if I could use it in the
[44:30] image of the Cross and I I say this very
[44:32] very carefully father forgive them for
[44:34] they know not what they do he's
[44:37] interceding over ignorance this day
[44:39] you'll be with me in Paradise he's
[44:42] reconciling for
[44:43] Redemption he's not just saying forgive
[44:45] them for they don't know what they do
[44:47] but now in this moment he's bringing
[44:49] them together he's reconciling for
[44:54] Redemption Brothers come to your
[44:56] instruments
[44:57] let me close with this statement in the
[44:59] unveiling of God the whole Mercy Seat is
[45:01] setting in plain view anybody can see it
[45:04] the veil is rent glory to God the whole
[45:07] Mercy Seat comes into Plain View how God
[45:10] could have mercy on foul Sinners as us
[45:13] when he hid himself was a mystery and
[45:15] now it is in plain view or in full view
[45:18] revealed by his word it's always the
[45:20] word constantly that is God it's the
[45:22] word that opens up it's those people who
[45:24] have know the word of God that day when
[45:27] Jesus died they would have seen The
[45:28] Mercy Seat they would have seen who he
[45:30] was there's that in the indictment that
[45:33] day this
[45:34] day these things that have just been
[45:36] recently as he would say there in
[45:38] 63 The Mercy Seat today is in plain view
[45:43] he says well in full view man I see it
[45:45] plainly but in full view it's the word
[45:48] of God The Mercy
[45:51] Seat if they would have only recognized
[45:53] him in that day so he says it was Jesus
[45:55] hanging on the cross The Mercy Seat
[45:57] and what was it the people were too
[45:59] blind to see
[46:00] it unless you think was common a moment
[46:03] ago could it be is it possible that the
[46:05] Gentiles had done the same thing if you
[46:06] thought that was just an outlier or a
[46:08] mistake in the transcription now it's
[46:10] repeated again their Traditions how then
[46:13] on the day of Pentecost the word came
[46:15] was in the form of the Son of God and
[46:17] they begin to organize it at NAA the
[46:19] first thing they went to the Methodist
[46:21] Baptists Presbyterians Pentecostals and
[46:22] so forth It's organized tradition till a
[46:25] man don't know where he stands but
[46:27] glory to God he promised in the last
[46:29] days that he would do it he would show
[46:32] his word in plain view open before us
[46:35] again open it up they only had know the
[46:38] word they know who Jesus was if a man
[46:41] only knew the word of God he'd know the
[46:42] hour we're living in and what's going on
[46:44] has it happened then it's happening
[46:45] today they just refused to listen to
[46:49] that word their Traditions what caused
[46:51] those Jews to see that they look like
[46:54] they could have actually seen because
[46:55] the thing was tore open
[46:58] you'd think they would see
[47:00] it you would think that as maybe they
[47:03] those who are there on the leaders that
[47:04] day who crucify them and these strange
[47:07] events start happening they go home and
[47:09] they run into one of their priest
[47:11] buddies and says you won't believe what
[47:12] happened at the temple
[47:14] today at such and such hour the Earth
[47:17] Shook and lightning struck and the veil
[47:19] was rent from bottom to the top
[47:21] completely open and it exposed now
[47:23] everyone knows there's nothing there and
[47:26] you think say when was
[47:28] that and you think their mind would
[47:31] start saying wait there's the there's an
[47:32] innocent one hanging on the cross who
[47:35] pla to be the Son of God there's deity
[47:37] nailed to
[47:38] Wood here's the blood is bleeding this
[47:42] is the day uh this is the Feast of the
[47:44] Passover all these things are happening
[47:45] you'd think that a moment at this moment
[47:47] maybe someone say wait a minute wait a
[47:48] minute wait a minute what's H what's
[47:50] happening what in the world is happening
[47:51] what's this surely this was the son of
[47:55] God he says but it was tore open for a
[48:00] purpose what did he say in the breach
[48:02] because he wants to gather his bride to
[48:03] his
[48:04] side it's the revealing of that Mercy
[48:07] Seat we're drawn to that it's the
[48:09] revealing of Christ we're drawn to that
[48:11] so it has a
[48:12] purpose the purpose is redemption the
[48:14] fullness of
[48:16] [Music]
[48:21] redemption and I believe that we can be
[48:24] a voice in this hour to say father
[48:25] forgive them for they don't know they're
[48:29] doing that there could be by God's grace
[48:33] repentance the voice of Mercy will find
[48:37] the
[48:38] righteous believe it's in the token says
[48:40] it'll find them it'll get there somehow
[48:43] it'll find it'll find the seed but it's
[48:46] going to have to take a
[48:48] voice as Peter stood there on the day of
[48:50] Pentecost and said men and Brethren
[48:52] you've crucified the Lord Of Glory
[48:54] there's got to be a voice that could
[48:56] tell the people what they do yes and if
[48:59] I believe as myself personally I believe
[49:02] that the mer Mercy is in the bride that
[49:05] there's been a transition from Christ
[49:07] the son of God as an interceder through
[49:10] the church ages but now we've entered in
[49:12] this different dispensation and say well
[49:14] Christ there's still Mercy there's still
[49:16] Mercy available and I say that the bride
[49:18] is that way or that place or that voice
[49:20] of Mercy I'm not saying the Bride Can
[49:22] Shed her blood for anyone's sins I don't
[49:24] think anyone needs to put their hands on
[49:25] the bride and and identify themselves
[49:27] with the bride or they've got to believe
[49:29] in the bride's blood no but she's
[49:31] dressed in the bleeding word in type in
[49:35] symbol she's dressed in the bleeding
[49:37] word in other words she is a
[49:39] representative I had it in my notes and
[49:41] I I guess I just took it out when Paul
[49:43] said we've been given the ministry
[49:44] reconciliation maybe I'll pick up on
[49:46] that on Sunday morning we've been given
[49:48] that word reconciliation means it's been
[49:50] translated to
[49:51] atonement we have the ministry of
[49:54] atonement because we are the voice of
[49:57] the bleeding word we are the final voice
[49:59] to the final age and oh that God go and
[50:02] look into it I'll just kind of give give
[50:03] my thunder away brother bam says we have
[50:06] power to remit
[50:07] sins we've got power to impart eternal
[50:11] life and you that there has to be Mercy
[50:14] there has to be Mercy in us today let me
[50:18] be merciful oh God if it means I have to
[50:20] start with myself and not be so hard on
[50:22] myself and know that I know that I know
[50:24] that I've obtained his mercy and have
[50:26] receive Mercy I can give Mercy oh God
[50:29] help me to do
[50:31] it let's stand and pray tonight
