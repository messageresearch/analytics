TRANSCRIPT
========================================
there's just so much to to say about that and and I just pray that God is allow will allow us to hit that just for a little bit but it says that he was the expressed image and I know brother brandham he's preached many messages on on that he's preached the unveiling of God Christ is the mystery of God revealed and many other messages where you can look how God would Express himself through certain things but the ultimate was this man Christ Jesus and once he came after all of that after him he would Express himself differently than he would in the Old Testament but my my title today and it sounds very strange because it almost doesn't sound like it's uh connected with this scripture but it is power without character and and Jesus was the expressed image and that Greek word is character he was the character of the person of God the Bible says that there was no beauty that we should desire of him so whenever we see image we think of a person we see oh man God is about to express himself like the Jews thought so he's like oh they might he's going to come down in a fiery Chariot Chariot he's going to come down with all of his his host of angels and he's going to express his Beauty Express his greatness and when God's like okay I'm going to express myself it was a stoop shoulder little man so he wasn't expressing a physical he was expressing character he was expressing values principles and we call it as message Believers the word we he was expressing his own word to us right now this title that I uh that I come came up with power without character it's from the exposition of the seven uh Church ages the Samaran Church age brother brandham he says unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him now I I don't want you guys to be just kind of in a narrow thinking of okay man I've got I'm I'm going to be suffering but in suffering there's many things in that suffering our suffering could be in little tiny things in our job in in household in sickness or whatever it might be but in those little tiny intricacies of our suffering there is temptations there is little things there's opportunities there there's a lot of things that are within our life of suffering that is just not man I'm always have to carry this chain I always have to I'm always suffering no it's in our daily life our daily suffering just to get up from bed and our aches and pains are there when we go out to work and and somebody's frustrating us how are we going to act and in that is a molding of character so you have to suffer with him every single day you're suffering and what is that creating or molding a character he says you have to suffer to rain the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering so character is not brother brandham says character is a victory and not a gift so it's something that we we're not born with it's not something that is given to us and I I truly understand that this is the way it is because of our fallen nature God could not just give us his character anymore like he did with Adam and Eve like he did with Lucifer like he did with the other Angels the Bible says that he created Lucifer perfect they were perfect Adam and Eve they were created in the image of God right so we as Fallen creatures now we come with a little re Renegade nature a character that's ready to fight the world take over and become Caesars and napoleons and whatever and just take over in our work space and take over here and and just that's that's who our character is now so now our character is not a gift it's something that has to be molded every single day and he says it's not a gift a man without character can't Reign because power apart from character is satanic now that's heavy and I I don't want us to go too deep into it oh man that's satanic evil demons is scary Darkness but just think about it it's satanic we're going to go into that just a little bit but Power without or power with character is fit to rule and since he wants us to share his throne on the same basis that he overcame now I like that because yes Jesus did suffer but he lived a life 33 years and a half and he says in that same basis of his pattern of life that's how he overcame so we got to look at that pattern now this quote it it can be deep and it is deep it's a deep statement and it's a path to a millennial Reign because we without this molding of character we can't Reign future tense right so it could be deep and we can say how it's a path to a millennial Reign a millennial rule but but and brother random says that that it's we have to have character for the purpose of power or to rule or to Reign that that those are the words rain power and all of that so we're looking at that and we're seeing oh man I I in order for me to be the bride in order for the Rapture in order for me to rein I have to have character but I I believe that this quote we can write it down in a piece of paper we can fold it in our pocket and we can use it every single day cuz cuz as Fathers as mothers we are ruling we are reigning there we are leading that's a better word we are leaders we are leaders in our workspace we are leaders just by default if you call yourself a Christian if you call yourself bride you're already the Bible says the light of the world so that means you're influencing you're leading the Bible says that that uh when when God created Adam and Eve the second thing he did was let them have dominion so we were created in our genetics and everything was to have dominion whether it's dominion over a workspace whatever it might be or just your little tiny Kingdom at home going to the grocery store you are a son and daughter of God reigning and ruling so it can be applied right there and without character well that our lead and our Reign can become satanic right so it it it means this statement it suggests that having power without possessing a good character traits can lead to negative consequences it become just as simple as that power a leading whatever you have without good characters traits without a strong character it leads to negative consequences so this quote shows that character is stronger than power character backs up Authority you cannot be in a in a power position you cannot be in a position of leading without character you have to have an amount of of of moral Restraint of principles and values in order to be a leader because once you become a leader and you don't have the the the principles you don't have the order you don't have that in your life it it's going to go into negative consequences in your leading so so so it protects your Authority character I'd rather I'd rather be a man down in the dumps poor messed up but with character instead of a man with with many things and and and many riches without any character character supersedes power yes that's what brother brandham is saying character supersedes Authority and Leadership so it is the foundation of being a leader Foundation of of of being a person of influence it's your character this quote implies that to effectively lead or Reign like brother Bram says a person must have that strong character character here refers to qualities like honesty Integrity responsibility and moral strength um the way I summed it up as I was s studying this is your character is your values now I want you guys to burn that in your brain it's values it's principles it's motives it's your philosop philosophy or your belief system so so that's in your character what you believe and that's why that's why when we we hear the word the word the word the word and we're like man what we hear so much of we got to stay on the word we got to follow the word Jesus was the word what what is that it is God's Own value system it's his principles and his principles Define his character character so when you look at his word you know who he is it's it's not an image but it is a character within God and when you look at his word and you begin to follow your philosophy begins to be intertwined with this word your belief system and and whenever it's ingrained in there then your body your life everything else is going to translate from what you believe from what your values are you might say oh this is right this is wrong somebody else might say this is wrong and this is right and and it determines their character right so so power and Corruption it it warns that power alone this quote does power alone without a moral compass provided by good character can be corrupting yes it can be corrupted or as brother Bram says satanic in this context satanic it implies that power devoid of ethical considerations can lead to harm Injustice abuse of authority that's why a lot of times we U we hear people say I don't know if you've heard it before but it's like man power is is will corrupt you man power is corrupting but in in reality power is revealing power will reveal your character so so whenever I don't know I lived in a small town so I saw it many times but you would you'd see somebody that you grew up with and um you know a little rascal just like you and then they they put a badge on and then they're somebody different they're over there throwing down the law and they're just somebody and it's like whoa what happened to you what it's their character never changed but their Authority their position changed so now they have a different position but the same character so now now what they're going to do is they're going to abuse that Authority they're going to hurt people they it's going to become unjust it's going to harm other people because their character never changed but their position did right brother bham he says it is satanic okay so this is satanic power apart from character now he's saying it in a way where it's like it's no character if you have power with not any character but the word satanic is basically relating to or the characteristic of Satan so power without this character is a different character it's a Satan it's Satan's character now this scripture um I would like to turn to uh Ezekiel 28:15 and uh I'm not going to hold you guys up too long it might be um before an hour but if you would like to turn with me to Ezekiel 2815 to18 this scripture is talking about the king attire of course but it it's it's a good example of what Paul says in Hebrews how the word is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart because this scripture it goes past the history of what's going on it goes past even the intent and the thoughts of the heart of Ty and it goes all the way to the beginning to another character and his name is Lucifer so that's that's how deep these prophecies and these scripture is that it it'll go straight through history straight through the future straight through our intents and go hey I see you Satan I I see you devil and and and the king of Ty was projecting the character of Satan or satanic character with his power and and God began to speak directly to that covering cherub and and um and he saw his motive and and like I said character is our motive brother bham he says in the message before we read the scripture he says in question and answers he says job and preached in 1959 job said I'll have a desire he'll speak and then I'll answer him see now the body is what you look at the spirit is what controls you your soul is the motive of that spirit or the nature of that Spirit the soul that sth that Soul shall die you're born in the world with a sinful soul and that is the nature of your spirit is sinful you long for the things of the world then the Holy Ghost comes down and baptizes you and changes the nature of that spirit so it changes your motives your motive is is the reason why you're doing something especially when it's hidden so we can we can come to church we can do great things but what is the motive of our heart what is that and there's a big difference between motive and personality because I remember brother brandham he would preach how he's like you you know we can create atmospheres and we're like wow I'm a Creator I can create how by our character that's how what he said by the character and me as a young person it's like I interpret it as man I I'm a pretty quiet guy you know I was probably 18 I barely gave my heart to the Lord and I said man my personality is is kind of garbage my I don't know how to talk to people uh you know keep eye contact or anything like that it's like man nobody was going to want to be around me because that's what I thought I thought it was personality that brother Brandon was talking about but but your personality is something that um we we frame or we create so that people can see us it represents what we want people to see our character is what we actually are a personality is a set of Personality qualities where where is uh character is a collection of mental and moral characteristics of an individual personality is outer appearance and behavior of a person at the same time Time character indicates the traits of a person which are hidden so this character it is creative this character it creates atmospheres it's it's not a personality Lucifer had the probably the greatest personality hey how's it going how are you doing what's going on but what's the character behind that so so now we want to look beyond what we see in the outside what we see here brother Bram says our our flesh is what we see but and our spirit is within us and our soul is the motive of that spirit so we can go do something and everybody says oh well that's good I can go and feed the poor but in my heart it's like I just want to look good for the people right I want to go and do this but in my motive it might be different so so then God that's what he does and the best the best example or the best thing that I've ever seen was when brother brandham would discern the hearts brother brandham he spoke so much on motive and I'm like man why does he talk about motive intention objectives all the time but it's because brother Brenham looked by the grace of God he looked beyond the the outward appearance and he would see the intention of a person the motive of that person and he says you need this and this and this why he saw their motive whatever we do how beautiful we appear whatever image we portray it's the character inside it's the motives that are in our hearts that matters to God that's why we're going to read Ezekiel don't worry but that's why when when God told Samuel Samuel was was crying because God just rejected Saul and he he was mourning and mourning and God had to tell him get up stop crying I got somebody else for you who is it this was our King he said you know what you people he Associated even Samuel maybe Samuel even fell in love with that man he said that's our King even though he's all messed up he said but you look at the outward appearance you see the shoulders you see this you see that I look into the heart I look into the motive I look at intention it doesn't matter how small how ugly how whatever that man is I'm going to use that character and that character is going to produce something far greater than anything that this world can produce I look at the heart I look at the motive Ezekiel 28:15 it says Thou was perfect in thy ways he's talking to Lucifer thou was perfect you were perfect brother brandham says character is not a gift it is a victory he said in in thy ways now in those ways that though that is the statues of God Jesus says I am the way the truth and the life what was it it wasn't a highway it wasn't the 101 it wasn't the i7 that we got to go down it was a way of life values it was the word he said you were perfect in the word you are perfect in my ways until or or he says from that day or from the day that thou was created until iniquity was found in you he he saw motive before he saw action amen iniquity was found in thee now the the reason why we're going into this because brother brandham he says power apart from character is satanic so now we want to see what satanic where is this coming from this is the source right here this is what he's talking about when he talks about a satanic character now remember power doesn't corrupt power reveals so here it's showing the Revelation or revealing of his character and we think oh well man his character is going to be revealed in those hard times no this was in in abundance his character was revealed when everything was good he said by the multitude of thy merchandise that was trading in the market markets and all of that he says by because he's still speaking to the king ofy but he's looking at Lucifer he says by the multitude of thy merchandise success they have filled the midst of thee with violence so was this outer thing that exposed him or or he didn't have the character to to contain all of this goodness thou H has sinned therefore I will cast thee as a Fain out of the Mountain of God I will destroy thee Oh covering cherub from the midst of the stones of fire now he goes again and he's looking within the heart and seeing what happened because of what was given to him he said thine heart was lifted up because of thy Beauty thou so his heart was lifted up because of Outer Image appearance brother Bram he he said in in choosing of a bride this a great message um for what we're talking about because he talks about character a lot but he says that a woman now I don't want to pick on any women but this is this is what brother Bram says he says a woman can or a girl she could be corrupted by her own beauty that people can always say man man the parents the aunts the UNC you're so beautiful you're so beautiful you're so beautiful until they become corrupt corrupted by their own Beauty brother Bram said that so there can be a lifting up or a corruption by own Beauty he says thy heart was lifted up because of thy Beauty thou H has corrupted thy wisdom by the reason of brightness he says I will cast thee to the ground I'll lay thee before kings that they may behold thee thou Hast defiled the sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities by the iniquity of thy traffic therefore I will bring fire from the midst of thee it shall devour thee and I will bring thee um bring thee to ashes upon the Earth in the sight of all of them that behold thee it says you were perfect in your ways until iniquity was found in you we are born in that condition iniquity and our ways are corrupted actually 50 Isaiah you don't have to turn with me but I I saw that correlation and I really just enjoyed it but Isaiah 53 it says 536 he says all we are this is when Jesus had to die for our sins this is where it says that there was no beauty that we should desire him but it says all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and the Lord had laid upon him him the iniquity of us all so we what we did because the what gave me this inspiration was I was studying about free moral agency choice and there's a way that God gives us a and God gave us the choice or free moral agent to say I don't want that choice I don't want that way so I'm going to make my own way and here in in 53 of Isaiah it's showing that we've all gone our own way once we go our own way we lose the power the protection of God because the way is the word we get away from the word we get away from God because that is his protection and he says we've all gone our own way and now he had to come and he had to pay the price of our iniquity which means something that you ought to do and you don't do so he paid the price of our wrong choices of our own ways and and he here is the originator of that iniquity he chose because brother B says he gave him the same put him in the same bases in the Garden of Eden as in the Garden of Eden a a tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and the tree of life and he chose knowledge of Good and Evil he chose his own way maybe his actions showed something else but God looks at the motive so the reason this is the amazing thing is the Reason God uses the kings of Babylon because in Isaiah 14 he uses them them he uses him as Lucifer the king of Ty the old covering cherub the king of Egypt to expose Satan is because their characteristics we projecting the psychology of Satan his own mind right right and I started to think about it and as we grow up because we are molded we are not given character we are projecting satanic characteristics every time we get angry every time pride comes in our heart every time we think we're better than somebody every time all of those things are character satanic characteristics there was one time where where Jesus he be to tell his disciples all the things he must suffer he said I must suffer this and that and and Peter the Bible says Peter took him he said don't say those things he said don't be telling us those things that's not going to happen to you what was it selfishness no you can't die we need you Jesus looked at him and looked right past Peter he said Satan get the behind me what was it it was a characteristic of Satan selfishness and every time something Rises up whenever we're driving in the 101 or the I 10 Satan comes out oh I just want to right and God has to come and say hey get thee behind me Satan watch out those are satanic whenever we go and and and we're leading we have to lead lives of Christians and every time we get out of character of God we go into the character of Satan we go into anger greed pridefulness all of those things so he said get thee behind me Satan in Isaiah 1413 and4 he says for thou has said in thine heart man I I love how God just pierces this God doesn't care about action action is going to come let the heart be right let the motive be right work work on this person in here action it'll come amen he says for thou has said in thine heart I will Ascend now now this this is Lucifer's projection or his his perverted way of thinking what God should be he says I will Ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the north I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most high I I I I I I that's a characteristic of Satan me me me I I I I remember um one of my buddies at work he'd say man you work for the Navy to one of my other co-workers he's like why he's like because you're always saying I I I me me I I I he said you work for the Navy uh why it selfishness and notice the process of Satan's thinking here in the these two little verses he says I I will Ascend exalt I will sit on the mount I will Ascend above and then the last one is I will be like God now this is important because this shows the perver perverted point of view of how to be like God he missed characterized God by a selfish exaltation he saw God and he says that's that's how it is to be like God he mischaracterized him even to the point well whatever the tale was he mischaracterized God to the point he pulled angels to his side I remember brother bam saying I I don't remember I believe it's um the conflict between God and but he he says how Satan attacked the word i' say it looks like he's attacking Adam and Eve you know just in my you know just thinking and I realized Satan don't care about us we're easy but if we're fortified by the word he has to mischaracterize God he has to mischaracterize God's values what are his values his word so if he can Mis or skew and and pervert the word of God then we see God in a different light and that's why God says I never change he's so adamant about his own values his own character that he says heavens and earth shall pass away but my values my word shall never pass away why because that that that is God his word is his principles he lives and he died by those principles that is his principes so when the saan can go and mischaracterize God then he's got the people whipped he's got the people where he wants them to be and and he saw God and he says yeah I want to I want to ascend like God I want to be selfish I want to be over all the stars all the Cong ation what is the people the angels He says I want to sit in the sides of the north I remember uh David talking about uh what a beautiful situation sitting in the the Holy Mountain the sides of the north it was there in that Jerusalem he said I want to sit there above the Jews above the Gentiles above the Angels like God I want to be like him my question is do we want to be like God do we want to be like God amen but he mischaracterized what to be like God is I want to be over I'm the bride we're better oh got to be careful we're greater we've got a greater thing where we want the position without the character I'm I want to be better that's what he wanted he wanted to rule over brother bam he says in this God God of his e evil age he says notice what he'll do his thoughts he thought God dwell in worldly beauty that was saying thought he saw the outer he saw the outer appearance he said he did that in Heaven Sin never began in the Garden of Eden it began in heaven when Lucifer the son of the morning exalt himself in Beauty and wanted a more beautiful kingdom than Michael than of Michael I I don't want to get too much into that but brother bradam has thoughts of who Michael is right you read Hebrews 1 and 2 it says that Jesus had a greater he says he I'll call the Angels ministering Spirits flames of fire but to you your throne will last forever right beautiful and and chapter 2 it shows that he was greater than all he was not merely a creation but he was the cause of creation and then in Chapter 2 it shows how he made himself a little lower than Angels that's character he made himself a little lower Satan wanted to be over he wanted to be over Angels he wanted to be greater because that's his thought and he says he thought God dwelt in Beauty Sayan begins to Mis represent God by by saying the reason why God is great is because of his Beauty because of his self exaltation but we realize that God he occupies this position because of his virtue we see that in throughout the whole Bible that God is willing to go to the lowest that's character Sayan was like no I want to be like God I want to have be the image of God he wanted the position but yet God was stood in that position because of his virtue because he was willing to leave the throne and wash feet of dirty fishermen to be laughed at to be spit at I wonder brother brandham said this I don't have the quote but he said that the devil doubted because he saw Jesus do that he says wait he's claiming to be the Son of God he and he's acting like this he was ready for a fight he was ready for a Michael he was ready for a heaven battle but he saw a little man not knowing that the fullness of the character of God was in that man his game is to me re misrepresent the character of God character is your values your principles your motives your philosophy or your belief system like I said that's why God says I don't change heavens and earth pass away my word will remain why because that's his values and that's why we have to be careful we have to be careful of yes I want to be like God the Bible says in Philippians he says put the mind of Christ put the mind of Christ and then he started saying he wasn't afraid to be called equal to God call himself equal man that sounds like Satan but then it says that he was willing to suffer that he was he put himself lower that is to be like God lord I want to be like you all right you're going to have his character you're you're you're not going to have this great Kingdom or anything like that you're going to have his character to help those in need to project His Image he thought it not Rob robbery to make himself equal brother Brenham says his own character molded him to that kind of person so to be equal to God is a molding of character and not anything else else so the closest we are to God is is when we humble ourselves when we allow God to enter in when when we put it like the song says we take ourselves away and let God come in and the closest to Satan is not when we're smoking and drinking out in the world it's when we're prideful this is what made me realize that why the Bible says it'll be so close to the very elect that it'll deceive them if it's possible because Satan doesn't dwell in dingy dirty Satan doesn't dwell in in in all of those things which which those are produces that sin produces those things but where he wants to be is right next to God he's used to that he wants to be closest to God he wants to be the closest to per ction that's why Cain was the closest to Jesus I mean uh uh Judas was the closest to Jesus other than John he was right there Cain had the most beautiful sacrifice Esau was was the the more respectable man why it's he wants to be there he's comfortable there in Perfection where where where our perfection can become our corruption where where we need to realize that the position that God places the bride is not any other position you nobody can just come and take a position of a child of God right because the character has to match that position and if it doesn't the the we'll be corrupted by the reason of our brightness we we'll be we we'll have iniquity by the our wisdom our wisdom will be defiled the Bible says by the reason of our Beauty wow look at them I am the bride I am this holding a position and not having the character holding a position and we can go into our lives and say Lord the position I hold that this this message is not for me to preach to you it's for me to sit here also and say Lord I didn't I wasn't born perfect I got a lot of molding to do I got a lot of things that I need to work on and and that's why God chose us because he wants our character to be a victory he wants us we're always in the becoming stage we're never perfect in this flesh we're always becoming that man the messages that that brother Aaron has been preaching I I was here when he preached oh my goodness what message it was the first one of Liberty I forgot what it was cuz now he's in impatient Liberty but it was the first one and he said something great he said that Jesus redeemed us and he gave his holy spirit to liberate us and it's not to liberate us so that we could do whatever we want to do that's a characterless person oh I'm I'm free to do anything but he says Liberty is the concept of freedom to become the freedom to become so now now I have the Liberty to be molded into Christ and and how do I do that by what looking at his glory and the more value I see the more values and principles I see the more it become I become that so so that's what we want every single day we want to be in the character of God no matter what an outer appearance looks like whatever our position is if we can stand firm in our character that's what matters to God he's looking at our heart he's looking at at us brother brandham he says he says notice now but God is featured in character there is no Beauty we should desire Jesus but there was never a character like him on earth now we find out today that the church character Satan and his group look after big beautiful churches beautiful things he says that's what the world looks at today oh it's the pastor the great and so and so time oh so and so Priestly and godly walking out these big robes and things like that they call that beauty it's so easy to call it Beauty we're human even Samuel said man look at Saul look at how great he is it's so easy but God it says but the real saints of God man so he gives us a different kind of vision now well it takes that away because it's so easy to look at that he says but the real saints of God looks for character of the Vindicated word the Bible is just not an understanding of religious Doctrine it's not for knowledge Doctrine so that we can we can uh you know create these things create structures of Our Lives that's not it but it it's a gaining of insight to the moral and ethical principles and that Define God's character the word defines God character every that's why when Satan says I want to be like God look at how great he is he's over everybody while we're these just little tiny ants everybody's killing each other there people sick and all of that he wants us to think that but I want to be like that I want to be great but the Bible says different he says that he came down and he became that so that we can become him that's what the Bible does for us it defines God's character and and and the best thing for us to do as I'm closing the best thing is is to be raised and to be taught to have good character but but our natural we got to remember that our natural character does not compare to the mind of Christ so it it can only help us get to that real character so when we're raising our children when we're helping one another out when we're coming to church what it's doing it's it's creating a character children when they're getting taught and all of that it's creating a character but it does not compare to the character of God but it helps us to get there brother brandham he says in the message he carth for you if you'd like to stand with me he says this leads to eternal life a man is made so that he could want that that comforter so so even though our nature and everything is all messed up God still found a way so that we can seek thirst desire that comforter he says he is wanting a comforter because he was made that way that's the way God put him together built rooms in him his soul his conscience his sight his senses everything was put together so everything that is consisted of us or con you know everything that is made up in US it it is built so that we can want that character and then us a as As Leaders parents uh whatever wherever you are as a leader wherever you are what we're doing is we're building character to those that are be underneath us we're building character in their conscience saying that's bad showing them good memories allowing them to reason but reason a right way see all of that is within us allow us allow them to show what's good and what's bad and and all of that is not to replace the comforter but it is to take us to the comforter so that whenever it's built and and it's there then the the young man the young woman can come to God and they could be ready saying Lord I know Lord I I've been raised in a good home I I've been raised the right way but Lord I need your comforter I need your your character to overcome because I will never be able to fulfill God's word without your character let us bow our heads as uh the brother wants to come up Heavenly Father Lord it's only by you father only by your holy spirit that that we can have this character it's not a man-made character father even though many people here were raised right lord it's not sufficient father what's sufficient for you Lord is your own Holy Spirit to live within us and as your spirit is in us then we could take your word because your word without our spirit it'll cause us to become just like Lucifer satanic with all of this authority of the word authority of the Bride authority authority without the character The Authority as people say the authority of the third pole but without character it'll never work it's whatever the character of Christ comes in US Lord then we we can walk as the bride we can walk as the light we can walk as Christians we can walk as what you intended us to walk by as Kings and Priests Lord as Christians as light of the world father I ask Lord that you just touch each and every person here Lord allow your word to just work in them as they they go to their homes is wherever they go father they go back to work tomorrow Lord let your word your values just work in them Father that whatever defect that we have can begin to be molded and chiseled out father that we become more of the Statue of the perfect man Lord we thank you Jesus in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen amen
