[0:00] this is part 11 of Christ My Healer
[0:04] and again Christ my healer just
[0:06] continuing this series part 11 and my
[0:10] subtitle today is vision correction and
[0:13] uh this is uh a lot on my heart I think
[0:17] it's going to be a very simple subject
[0:19] but what we want to preface this by is
[0:22] in this approach with these we're
[0:24] addressing the barriers to Healing
[0:26] looking at our mental approach to Christ
[0:29] Our State of Mind as we approach Christ
[0:31] for our healing and as this is part 11
[0:35] in a series on Divine Healing and I
[0:38] spent a lot of time laying the
[0:40] foundation so some of you may be waiting
[0:41] when is he going to be getting to it I'm
[0:43] in the heart of it now but the real
[0:45] heart of Divine Healing The Heart of the
[0:47] subject and so vision correction is our
[0:49] title today and it's a very broad
[0:54] subject but I trust we can zero in on
[0:55] some things that really help last week
[0:57] we spoke on or the week prior to that a
[1:00] couple Sundays ago we spoke on chronic
[1:02] conditions of the heart and in this
[1:04] subject and we're kind of continuing on
[1:06] the same theme chronic conditions of the
[1:08] heart we were looking at how that heart
[1:10] problems maybe not in the physical part
[1:12] of the heart but in our minds or our
[1:15] Spirits how there's heart problems that
[1:18] can actually cause sickness and I think
[1:20] we understand that worry anxiety I want
[1:22] to get into it Lord willing just even
[1:24] how a lack of forgiveness inhibits
[1:27] prohibits us from being healed there's a
[1:28] lot of things that relate to our minds
[1:30] that cause sickness but then it's our
[1:32] mental state that can keep us from being
[1:34] healed and that was the thought behind
[1:36] The Chronic conditions of the heart
[1:38] because we may be seeking Divine Healing
[1:41] we need healing in our body we need a
[1:42] healing of this cancer we need a healing
[1:44] of this ailment and we're desperate in
[1:47] to see physical healing but it's
[1:49] actually something in our state of mind
[1:51] that's going to keep us from it so God
[1:53] needs to First address a chronic
[1:55] condition of the heart before he can
[1:57] address a chronic condition in our
[2:00] bodies and that we break that up by
[2:01] looking at we're soul spirit and body
[2:03] and I think that image has been before
[2:05] us quite a bit lately so we can relate
[2:07] to it that way now James chapter 5 this
[2:10] is where I want to start it's a little
[2:11] bit of a review
[2:12] but I'm hoping that we're just jumping
[2:14] right in this James chapter 5 verse 13
[2:16] and
[2:18] we know in reading this in verses 14 and
[2:21] 15 is where he says if there's any sick
[2:23] among you call to the elders and have
[2:26] them pray anointing you with oil and the
[2:28] Bible says and the prayer of faith shall
[2:30] deliver you so he said if there's any
[2:33] sick call the Elders have them anoint
[2:35] you pray over you and the the scripture
[2:37] is and this is what we believe that if
[2:39] we're sick and the prayer and it's the
[2:41] prayer of faith that'll heal us that
[2:43] Faith healing us and that prayer over us
[2:46] and that's one of the most outstanding
[2:47] scriptures on Divine Healing and laying
[2:50] hands on the sick and they shall recover
[2:51] James enforcing that that we if we're
[2:54] sick we can call for the elders they can
[2:56] anoint us with prayer known as with oil
[2:58] pray over us and will be healed but
[3:00] verse 13 as we've looked at it this way
[3:02] it's an often overlooked conditioned
[3:05] precedent or something that James
[3:07] addresses first before we call to the
[3:10] elders and it's it and the the point of
[3:13] this I see is that it's putting us in
[3:16] the state of mind to benefit from that
[3:18] act of the prayer faith for physical
[3:21] healing and so this is what it says in
[3:24] verse 13. it says is any among you
[3:27] Afflicted let him pray is any Mary let
[3:31] him sing Psalms so if there's any
[3:33] Afflicted let them pray is any Mary let
[3:36] them sing songs do I need to go up or
[3:38] down on this
[3:40] down
[3:44] am I good here little up good all right
[3:48] don't be afraid to tell me what to do
[3:49] back there brother Mitch we know you run
[3:51] the show uh without you he would it
[3:53] would be a nightmare be a train wreck of
[3:55] the sound so thank you but uh so is any
[3:58] Afflicted among you let them pray is any
[4:00] Merit let him sing songs this is this is
[4:03] Paul James addressing what we're
[4:06] thinking before we ask for the elders to
[4:08] come and pray for us if we're physically
[4:10] sick we look to how this word Afflicted
[4:12] means suffering of mind or emotion and
[4:15] so is your mind suffering are your
[4:17] emotions Disturbed are you are you a
[4:20] burdened with uh with complexes do you
[4:22] have scars that you're wrestling with
[4:23] internally have you suffered from
[4:26] disappointments do you need to if you
[4:28] have a lot of things working through
[4:29] your mind he's saying if you're
[4:30] Afflicted then pray about your state of
[4:33] mind if you're disturbed if you're
[4:36] emotionally upset if you're worrying if
[4:38] you're doubting he doesn't say in that
[4:40] state call for the elders to pray for
[4:41] your sick body he says you need to pray
[4:43] first because that's going to align your
[4:45] spirits and your emotions and help wash
[4:48] you and make you more sensitive and then
[4:49] he says is any Mary and it's kind of the
[4:52] the question that assumes the answer is
[4:55] anyone marry in other words are you in
[4:57] good spirits
[4:58] are you happy are you glad are you
[5:01] cheerful if not sing Psalms
[5:05] and so there's a it's a direct
[5:06] addressing of the believer's State of
[5:09] Mind before they would call and have the
[5:11] elders pray over their physical sickness
[5:14] because if I could put this it's the
[5:16] mental state it's the emotional state
[5:18] that we need to be in before healing can
[5:20] come
[5:21] and so that was that's again maybe just
[5:23] a synopsis of what we were looking at in
[5:25] terms of The Chronic conditions of the
[5:27] heart now Vision Correction
[5:30] in looking at this is we're continuing
[5:32] to look at the function of the state of
[5:34] mind or the human emotions and we
[5:37] touched on this a little bit so we'll
[5:39] bring it back in it's it's looking at
[5:41] our attitude towards the promise of God
[5:43] so if you're sick the Bible says uh that
[5:46] you're gonna you want to be prayed for
[5:48] to believe for your healing to prayer of
[5:49] faith will save you and that if you're
[5:52] not in the right frame of mind when you
[5:54] go to pray that's going to keep you from
[5:55] getting the healing you want because
[5:57] it's gonna it's gonna pervert or maybe
[6:00] Cloud your attitude towards the promise
[6:02] well I'm going to have hands laid on me
[6:04] but I'm not sure and well I'm sick and I
[6:07] believe God's A Healer but I don't know
[6:08] maybe I deserve this or maybe it's not
[6:10] for me and so it has a lot to do with
[6:13] our attitude towards the promise of God
[6:15] so in looking at vision correction I was
[6:18] originally originally going to title it
[6:19] vision problem problems I thought that
[6:21] might be too negative but Envision
[6:23] correction we're dealing with vision
[6:24] problems
[6:25] problems with our vision
[6:27] and a sermon show us the father we read
[6:29] this last time brother Brown says I go
[6:31] on record I say this about the word of
[6:33] God being a seed if you can take the
[6:35] right mental attitude towards any Divine
[6:39] promise of God he will bring it to pass
[6:40] this is one of those absolute sayings
[6:43] that I think he says the right mental
[6:45] attitude so many different times
[6:47] to us the right attitude the right
[6:49] mental attitude says it so many times
[6:51] that this is a principle that's pretty
[6:53] firm in the word of God the right
[6:55] attitude towards any Divine promise will
[6:58] bring it to pass
[6:59] and he says if you will get if you can
[7:01] get yourself in position to believe that
[7:04] that promise was to you so the right
[7:06] mental attitude has something to do with
[7:09] where you're standing so if you can get
[7:11] yourself in position so maybe you hear
[7:13] about a promise you're kind of seeing
[7:15] part of the promise but you got to move
[7:16] yourself around a little bit and get
[7:18] yourself into position to where you can
[7:20] believe or see that that promise is to
[7:22] you a similar statement in the sermon
[7:25] the Queen of Sheba God's words are true
[7:28] I believe the right mental attitude
[7:30] towards any Divine promise of God will
[7:33] bring it to pass he says if you can look
[7:36] at it in the right way so that statement
[7:39] the right mental attitude towards any
[7:41] promise of God will bring it to pass any
[7:43] Divine promise will bring it to pass and
[7:46] he uses the phrase of getting yourself
[7:48] in position or in this way he says if
[7:50] you can look at it the right way and
[7:53] that's exactly what attitude relates to
[7:55] an attitude is as we look at in terms of
[7:57] its uh your behavior how you feel
[8:00] towards something your opinion but
[8:01] attitude is your way of viewing
[8:03] something attitude is literally your
[8:05] perspective your Vantage Point our
[8:08] perspective is a particular attitude
[8:10] toward or a way of regarding something
[8:12] it is a point of view so your attitude
[8:15] is your point of view what's your
[8:17] opinion of this what's your attitude
[8:19] towards this what's your Vantage Point
[8:20] what's your view what's your way of
[8:22] considering it or regarding it
[8:24] if you uh if you have a view of
[8:26] something you're regarding it in a
[8:27] particular light or with a particular
[8:30] attitude
[8:31] and so when brother Branham says the
[8:33] right mental attitude will bring any
[8:34] Divine promise of God to pass he's
[8:37] telling us that one of the most
[8:38] important factors in receiving a
[8:40] blessing from God or receiving the
[8:42] promise is the way you view it I know
[8:45] this seems very very simplistic but it's
[8:46] just a cheap trick to get a lot of amens
[8:49] right when it's real simple and you know
[8:50] it you amen a lot but it there's a it's
[8:53] just a very simple principle of saying
[8:55] the way you view it your position
[8:57] towards it the way you're looking at it
[8:59] and so if this is such a uh a clear
[9:02] thing in the word of God that there's a
[9:04] promise of God that says I am your
[9:06] healer and you can be healed or whatever
[9:08] the Divine promise may be and program
[9:10] says the right view of it will bring it
[9:12] to pass then that tells us the most
[9:15] important part in terms of me receiving
[9:17] that Divine promise is how I view it
[9:20] and that's where we get this idea of
[9:22] vision correction God may he may need to
[9:24] heal or correct our vision before we can
[9:27] receive healing in our body
[9:29] now I'm not talking about the physical
[9:31] part but I'm talking about that mental
[9:33] perception that mental part the State of
[9:35] Mind are you Afflicted in mind or are
[9:38] you not seeing things the right way are
[9:39] you not settled are you not sure then
[9:41] pray because God may need to align and
[9:44] correct your vision before he can heal
[9:46] that part of your body
[9:48] now if you'll turn to Mark chapter 8
[9:52] foreign
[9:58] tells us in verse 13. that he had I left
[10:03] the Pharisees and they're questioning
[10:05] entered into the ship and they begin to
[10:07] uh pass to the other side verse 14. now
[10:09] the disciples had forgotten to take
[10:11] bread neither had they in the ship with
[10:14] them more than one loaf
[10:17] and
[10:19] Jesus then makes the statement in verse
[10:21] 15. and remember that part's important
[10:22] because they're sitting there with one
[10:23] loaf of bread and have all this is a
[10:25] boat full of people and he says take
[10:27] heed Beware of the leaven of the
[10:28] Pharisees and of the leaven of Herod
[10:31] and they reason among themselves saying
[10:33] it is because we have no bread and so
[10:35] they're thinking he's either passive
[10:36] aggressive or this is just Jesus's way
[10:39] of digging at him a little bit you know
[10:41] why didn't you guys bring more bread
[10:42] there's 12 13 of us what are you
[10:43] thinking uh and this shows just how
[10:47] shallow their thinking is because Jesus
[10:50] is not talking about the literal bread
[10:52] but the leaven of the Pharisees and the
[10:53] leaven of Herod is a spiritual warning
[10:56] something that will uh eat up and
[10:59] pervade and something that'll corrupt
[11:00] and they immediately begin to think very
[11:02] Carly very surfaced Jesus is talking
[11:04] about matters of the Soul matters of the
[11:06] spirit they're thinking in terms of
[11:08] their stomach and their digestive system
[11:09] and Jesus when Jesus knew it verse 17 he
[11:13] saith unto them this is where we're
[11:15] starting to look at this vision
[11:15] correction and so we're looking at it
[11:18] the first part we're looking as even
[11:19] this direct spiritual application the
[11:21] way we see things and perceive things
[11:23] and what our discernment is and when
[11:26] Jesus knew it he saith in him why reason
[11:28] ye because you have no bread
[11:31] I say this and the first thing you think
[11:33] of is someone only brought one loaf of
[11:35] Sarah Lee
[11:37] and he says perceive ye not yet neither
[11:40] understand are you thinking about this
[11:42] at all are is there any depth of
[11:44] understanding with the things that are
[11:45] taking place and he makes this statement
[11:47] I think this very
[11:49] um very uh
[11:51] significant heavy your heart yet
[11:54] hardened now not by sin
[11:57] but something's been dulled or something
[11:59] something's not getting through there's
[12:00] some some barrier there that he's
[12:02] addressing maybe ground that's hard so
[12:04] there's no deepness of Earth what's
[12:06] taking place isn't penetrating like it
[12:08] ought to haven't I see you not having
[12:10] ears hear you not so they had the
[12:12] physical ability of eyesight they had
[12:14] the physical ability of hearing but yet
[12:17] the seeing and the hearing here speaks
[12:19] of kind of picking up the thought or
[12:21] catching what was being said and then he
[12:23] says and do you not remember
[12:25] can you not does your memory not even
[12:28] serve you well in this instance when I
[12:30] break the Five Loaves among five
[12:31] thousand how many baskets full of
[12:33] fragments took you up so now he's
[12:34] probing their their memory
[12:37] they send him 12.
[12:39] and when you and when the seven among
[12:41] four thousand how many baskets full of
[12:42] fragments took you up and they said
[12:44] seven
[12:45] and maybe at this point he's hoping that
[12:47] light bulbs start going off right like
[12:51] ah and he said to them how is it that ye
[12:55] do not understand
[12:59] and so when you read this these
[13:01] different questions that he's asking
[13:03] he asked these several different
[13:05] questions all probing at their mental
[13:08] state
[13:10] is he says why are you reasoning do you
[13:12] not perceive do you not understand do
[13:14] you not remember is your heart hardened
[13:16] how many baskets did I take of that time
[13:18] how many this time do you not understand
[13:19] he's saying how is it that when I make
[13:22] this statement that you ought to be
[13:24] looking at one way you immediately take
[13:25] it and apply it in the physical and even
[13:27] apply it in the physical you still miss
[13:29] it hey you're saying that's not really
[13:31] what I meant but even then if I was kind
[13:34] of alluding to the fact that she only
[13:35] brought one loaf one of you should
[13:37] object and say well Jesus you can take
[13:40] this and divide it to where it's We'll
[13:42] have leftovers by the time we get to
[13:44] where we're going
[13:45] and so he was asking he was asking them
[13:48] to consider how they were viewing the
[13:50] situation
[13:51] and when he uses the phrase have you yet
[13:54] hardened your heart have ye your heart
[13:56] yet hardened it literally means blinded
[14:00] because he's talking about understanding
[14:01] and perception and how you see things
[14:03] and how you view things he says are you
[14:05] blind
[14:06] is your heart yet blinded because there
[14:09] was still a need for greater perception
[14:11] and understanding of what Jesus was
[14:13] accomplishing remember a lot of the
[14:15] emphasis and the things that we took in
[14:17] the foundation is that Jesus could do
[14:19] Miracles but then there's a way that we
[14:20] view that tour we're only letting that
[14:22] get very shallow and very surfaced where
[14:25] we're there for the loaves we're there
[14:26] for the fish but we're not really there
[14:28] for the spiritual need that we have or
[14:30] the soul need that we have and that's
[14:32] the tendency of the flesh to look for
[14:34] things that satisfy the flesh the bodily
[14:36] exercise and excitement and all sorts of
[14:38] things that thrill us but never getting
[14:40] to real the real heart of the matter the
[14:42] soul of the matter and so there was
[14:43] still a need for greater awareness to
[14:46] see what was actually happening
[14:49] in Mark chapter 6 verses 51 to 52
[14:53] . this is an another instance where
[14:58] Jesus uses this phrase
[15:00] and it's in chapter six where he feeds
[15:02] the five thousand and then in this
[15:05] instance where he's walking upon the sea
[15:07] and so there's a very significant events
[15:09] that take place in chapter six he feeds
[15:10] five thousand they take up all those uh
[15:13] the the seven basket fools or excuse me
[15:15] the 12 basketfuls and now Jesus comes
[15:17] walking on the water there's a lot there
[15:19] that we could unpack unpack in terms of
[15:21] their fear and they begin to worry and
[15:23] they begin to be afraid but after it's
[15:25] over he says and when he went up in up
[15:27] the he went up unto them into the ship
[15:31] and the wind ceased and they were so
[15:34] amazed in themselves beyond measure and
[15:36] wondered
[15:37] so there is in this particular instance
[15:40] they are so shocked and in amazement at
[15:44] what he has done and there and the
[15:47] question of how they are amazing
[15:48] themselves beyond measure and wondered
[15:50] it suggests that they're wondering isn't
[15:53] just in pure amazement
[15:55] like we could say about the things of
[15:57] God at this point as Believers that
[15:59] whenever God does something we're always
[16:01] amazed but we're never surprised right
[16:04] because that's amazing but it doesn't
[16:06] surprise me because that's just exactly
[16:08] what God would do if you were drowning
[16:10] in a lake and all of a sudden you saw a
[16:13] Christ walking on the water to pick you
[16:15] up out of the water you would be amazed
[16:16] but it wouldn't surprise you because we
[16:18] believe that God can do those things but
[16:21] to them their amazement beyond measure
[16:24] and their wonderment was now causing
[16:26] them in their minds to be like what what
[16:29] is going on here this is getting weird
[16:32] right there's something about it because
[16:34] it says in verse 52 for they considered
[16:37] not the miracle of the loaves for their
[16:39] heart was hardened
[16:42] in other words they're they're
[16:43] understanding ought to have grown at
[16:45] this point
[16:46] their faith should have been increasing
[16:48] through each Miracle to where whenever
[16:51] Jesus does what he did to feed the five
[16:53] thousand then he comes walking on the
[16:55] water like see
[16:57] I mean what do you expect this is our go
[16:59] this is the Messiah this is what he can
[17:01] do and their faith get even bigger at
[17:03] that point but now because the Bible's
[17:06] saying that they were not they had not
[17:08] considered they had not reflected upon
[17:10] the Miracles they had not fully
[17:12] considered what the implications were
[17:14] well if this is this then this is that
[17:16] and this is what it must be they hadn't
[17:19] really thought about it in a deep way we
[17:21] talked Wednesday night about critical
[17:23] thinking it's not me doesn't mean we're
[17:25] being critical it means you're actually
[17:26] thinking about what's happening
[17:29] means you're actually considering what's
[17:31] happened and since they had not
[17:32] considered the Bible says or reflected
[17:34] deeply upon the Miracles they were
[17:37] wondering because had they done it they
[17:39] would not have wondered at this miracle
[17:42] they would have said well add that to
[17:43] the list of powers
[17:45] and we know we can multiply things now
[17:46] we know he can walk upon the waves we
[17:48] can he can calm the Seas it ought to uh
[17:51] it ought to deepened their faith but the
[17:54] Bible and telling the story when Jesus
[17:55] walks on the sea they were still holding
[17:57] the feelings of doubt
[18:00] there was still a sense of anxiety maybe
[18:02] even a hesitation uh if I could even say
[18:05] and I don't want to put too much
[18:06] emphasis on it but maybe some unbelief
[18:10] right man it's hard for them to accept
[18:12] this it's hard for them to believe this
[18:14] and he's using the phrase that your
[18:16] heart is hardened
[18:18] it's not they didn't have eyes that they
[18:20] didn't have ears Jesus is talking about
[18:22] their mind
[18:24] they weren't rubbing their eyes and
[18:25] doubting what they saw but they're
[18:27] doubting what it meant
[18:28] they're not they're not trying to unplug
[18:31] their ears and they're questioning what
[18:32] they heard in terms of did I hear that
[18:34] did I see that but it's the process by
[18:36] which they are perceiving and Discerning
[18:39] what was happening
[18:41] and so it is this heart being yet
[18:44] hardened is the blindness of the Mind
[18:47] and this is what's transpired in Mark
[18:49] chapter eight it calls back to Mark
[18:50] chapter six and it's addressing the
[18:52] attitude of the of the belief of the
[18:54] disciples in the boat towards the Christ
[18:57] that's with them
[18:58] think about that the attitude of the
[19:00] disciples Christ is there the Wonder
[19:02] working Miracle God is there the power
[19:04] to multiply the loaves the power to calm
[19:06] the seas in every instance Christ is
[19:08] present right there with them in the
[19:10] boat but the problem is they're added to
[19:12] towards the divine presence it's their
[19:15] attitude towards the present Jesus
[19:17] Christ the one that is here fulfilling
[19:19] his promised word he's here he's doing
[19:21] many wonderful things and he has power
[19:23] to walk on water he has power to calm
[19:25] the waves there's power to multiply
[19:26] those his power to heal our bodies but
[19:28] the only thing that will keep it from
[19:29] happening is our attitude towards it
[19:33] and the sermon and knoweth it not
[19:34] brother Graham's talking about the
[19:36] doctor giving medicine and actually the
[19:37] phrase brother Brandon uses he says I
[19:39] feel like a doctor I feel like I'm
[19:41] giving medicine to the woman and having
[19:42] to hold her mouth shut to get her to
[19:44] swallow it and he's alluding to the
[19:46] preaching of the word he's trying to
[19:47] give us some medicine but we're not
[19:49] swollen so he feels like he's got to
[19:50] hold our mouths and cover up our our
[19:53] nose and choke us to where we have to
[19:54] swallow in order to breathe and
[19:57] that's just maybe me putting in my own
[19:58] words but that's the way it reads
[20:00] but he mentions the doctor giving
[20:02] medicine he says spit it out between
[20:04] your fingers pour some more down then
[20:07] finally shake their head and Revolt back
[20:08] and go back and won't do it in other
[20:10] words the medicine's there but they're
[20:12] spitting it out they're pouring their
[20:13] head out they're refusing it's in the
[20:14] mouth it's right there it's really all
[20:16] they need to do is swallow it just needs
[20:17] to drop a little bit deeper
[20:21] he says yet you come back again and pour
[20:23] it in again
[20:25] that medicine coming right back in again
[20:27] then who is to blame
[20:29] not the doctor
[20:31] not the medicine
[20:32] but the attitude of the person
[20:35] is that I think that's that maybe our
[20:37] listen let's just all
[20:41] mistakes were made but not by me right
[20:44] now we always feel yeah that's a big
[20:45] problem but I'm not part of it
[20:47] and we always think yeah that's not
[20:49] right something was done wrong no that's
[20:51] not good and and we don't think it's
[20:52] we're no we're the reason so we do have
[20:55] this sense in a lot of ways that we can
[20:57] recognize when something's wrong but our
[20:58] instinct is to not think that we are it
[21:01] and so in a lot of ways we could blame
[21:03] the doctor right well it's a doctor's
[21:05] falter we could blame the medicine the
[21:07] prescription well it's the
[21:08] prescription's fault it's Western
[21:10] medicine they're the problem well it's
[21:12] the acupuncturist if that's that's a
[21:14] problem it's the you're using the wrong
[21:15] brand of oil whatever it is we start we
[21:18] want to blame a lot of other people but
[21:19] even in this context he's saying it's
[21:22] not the preacher and it's not what he's
[21:23] preaching it's your attitude
[21:26] and I think that's sometimes what we're
[21:28] in just be honest with ourselves that
[21:30] are Instinct sometimes is to put the
[21:32] problem on somebody else well he's not
[21:34] preaching it right or this isn't right
[21:35] that's not right but what about us who
[21:37] are taking the medicine are we taking
[21:40] the medicine what's my attitude towards
[21:43] it
[21:44] maybe not to use a
[21:46] a kind of an aggravating statement I
[21:48] don't know if this is politically
[21:49] correct but it's a mental problem
[21:53] it's an issue of perception
[21:55] it's an issue of our vision
[21:58] and so as he abrides them why did you
[22:00] reason do you not perceive do you not
[22:02] understand is your heart blinded do you
[22:04] have eyes to see do you have ears but
[22:06] don't hear do you even remember
[22:09] that'd be the easiest one right calling
[22:11] out all those elements of the spirit
[22:12] imagination memory reason and affection
[22:15] it's all he's identified all this
[22:17] suspects how is it that you do not
[22:19] understand and then verse 22 immediately
[22:21] it comes into a miracle and I believe
[22:23] it's here for a reason
[22:25] and he comes to bethsaida and they bring
[22:27] a blind man unto him and besought him to
[22:29] touch him
[22:30] now he just upgraded them he says is
[22:32] your heart yet hardened are you blind I
[22:35] mean if we just put it in modern
[22:36] parlance right you blind
[22:38] right that's maybe what we would say to
[22:40] one another and he says they bring a
[22:42] blind man unto him and besought him to
[22:44] touch him
[22:46] and he took the Blind Men by the hand
[22:47] and let him out of town and when he'd
[22:49] spit on his eyes and put his hands upon
[22:50] him he asked if he saw ought
[22:55] maybe put another way do you see
[22:56] anything
[22:58] now this is this is a unique statement
[23:01] when he comes when he answers he looked
[23:03] up and said I see
[23:06] so now this man was blind but now he can
[23:09] see and Jesus is asking him again now
[23:11] this is a probing question
[23:13] uh what is it you see do you see what do
[23:16] you see ask him if he saw anything he's
[23:18] he's wanting him to say what what do you
[23:20] see
[23:21] and so he says I see men
[23:24] and what I'm and if I could put it in my
[23:26] own words I see what I assume to be men
[23:30] but they look to me no different in
[23:32] trees than trees but I know them to be
[23:34] men because they're walking and trees
[23:36] don't walk
[23:36] that's kind of what's meant by the
[23:38] phrase I see men as trees but yet
[23:40] they're walking I can't disturb discern
[23:43] among uh physical shapes I can't tell
[23:46] whether it be a man or a tree but it's a
[23:48] man it's as if it's a tree walking but
[23:50] yet I know it's a man
[23:52] and we can absolutely assume from this I
[23:56] think it's very very clear I don't know
[23:57] if there'd be much arguments no matter
[23:58] how many commentaries you pulled up or
[24:00] what preachers you talked to I'm pretty
[24:02] sure that they would all agree that this
[24:03] indicates that the physical eye was
[24:06] healed
[24:07] there were some obstruction there was
[24:10] some something cloudy in his vision
[24:11] there was something detached there was
[24:13] something wrong physically that breach
[24:15] was minted there was a healing to the
[24:16] physical part of the eye and some
[24:18] obstruction removed something taken away
[24:20] or something added to to mend the
[24:23] physical part and so now Jesus says what
[24:25] do you see and he says I can see
[24:28] what looked like to be men is trees
[24:30] walking
[24:31] now and I I know that I'm maybe going a
[24:34] little bit slower today than I had hoped
[24:36] but and you're thinking wow how fast can
[24:38] you go then
[24:40] but the vision involves uh the function
[24:43] of the eye that'd be the physical part
[24:45] that's detecting light but then also the
[24:48] brain which is essentially interpreting
[24:50] the light
[24:51] and and that's where the vision is I
[24:53] know if you really start thinking about
[24:54] this it gets a little weird but what
[24:56] you're seeing right now is in your head
[24:59] right I mean it's like what it I know it
[25:02] makes a lot of sense what you're seeing
[25:04] but it's all in your head and I'm not
[25:06] wrong for saying that listen you see me
[25:08] up here in a gray suit and you see me
[25:09] preaching but it's all in your head
[25:11] and you're like yeah duh right it is
[25:14] it's that's where Vision comes to its
[25:17] picture and so there's Optical parts and
[25:19] that's why when people say they refer to
[25:22] things as optical illusions uh it's
[25:24] technically not correct right it's a
[25:26] visual illusion because the optic part
[25:28] is the physical part and there's the
[25:29] physical part and the neural part that
[25:31] transmits uh information and then
[25:33] there's a whole mental part that takes
[25:35] place
[25:36] and so Vision in terms of physical parts
[25:39] involves the cornea and the pupil and
[25:41] the iris and the lens and the retina and
[25:43] an optic nerve and then even our tear
[25:46] ducts are part of our vision because the
[25:48] tears keep the eyes from being irritated
[25:50] and help keep our vision clean and so
[25:52] there's a lot of different physical
[25:53] parts to the eye and then even the optic
[25:56] nerve is a physical part that's going to
[25:58] help send signals to the brain to
[26:00] produce an image
[26:02] if we even and I had some slides to uh
[26:05] share this but I realize now we just
[26:08] kind of had left those off but maybe
[26:09] just try to describe it but the vision
[26:11] begins at the cornea that that initial
[26:14] layer in the eye kind of a curved layer
[26:17] and it's going to bend the light and
[26:18] that's going to enter into that's the
[26:20] very process it's going to enter in that
[26:22] way and then it comes into the pupil
[26:24] which is kind of the Gateway of the
[26:25] light
[26:26] which is then uh
[26:28] controlled by the iris which is a muscle
[26:32] that it's dilating that pupil and
[26:34] Contracting it and making it larger it's
[26:36] controlling it's a muscle that's
[26:37] controlling the size of the people what
[26:38] is it determining how much light comes
[26:40] in how much you're receiving it's in
[26:42] this way that the eye works a lot like
[26:43] your camera
[26:44] and then there's a lens that focuses
[26:46] that light sharpens the detail
[26:49] and then the retina transforms that
[26:51] light into electrical signals
[26:54] the eye is a fascinating organ all these
[26:58] different parts and then those signals
[26:59] are sent to the brain by the optic nerve
[27:01] and then the brain creates the image
[27:04] that we see
[27:05] this is amazing right no man invented
[27:08] this God did this
[27:10] and so what we're seeing is a
[27:13] reproduction of the light now just get
[27:16] you can get real spiritual here we just
[27:17] start really preaching of the light
[27:19] that's being reflected and absorbed and
[27:21] sharpened and focused and the Brain
[27:22] reproduces this image
[27:25] and so when Jesus lays his hands it
[27:27] doesn't actually take some away from the
[27:28] crowd this is not going to be a public
[27:30] show he takes away from the crowd he
[27:31] spits and he anoints his eyes he puts
[27:33] his hands on him and then says do you
[27:35] see he says I see Ministries walking
[27:37] Jesus healed something we could say
[27:40] maybe from the cornea to the optic nerve
[27:42] there was a physical healing of the eye
[27:45] toward that process is obviously working
[27:47] because now he he's the the light being
[27:50] reflected from the men that it's being
[27:52] it's being brought into his mind where
[27:54] he can make this decision but he needed
[27:57] further healing
[27:59] I can say it that way he needed a
[28:01] further healing of his visual system
[28:03] because
[28:05] there there's there's a part of that
[28:08] part of this process of vision that
[28:10] relates more to our visual perception
[28:13] not just our Acuity where well I can see
[28:15] 2020 or I can say whatever it is how we
[28:17] measure that that's related a lot to the
[28:20] shape of the eyeball and whether there
[28:21] be any anything physically that's
[28:23] obstructing it but there's a part also
[28:25] of our visual perception where we're
[28:28] thinking and considering and putting the
[28:30] pieces together of this pixelated image
[28:33] that's been sent to our minds
[28:35] because that's part of the brain the
[28:37] visual cortex is the largest system in
[28:39] the brain
[28:40] and what the information sent to your
[28:43] brain is in 2D did you realize that
[28:46] the light as it's sent to your brain is
[28:48] two-dimensional and your brain makes it
[28:50] three-dimensional
[28:52] it's your brain that does that you guys
[28:54] are smart right I'm not Flat Stanley up
[28:57] here today
[28:58] you see it 3D three-dimensionally it's
[29:01] the mind that does that it's the mind
[29:03] that creates the depth perception it's
[29:05] the mind that's interpreting Shadows
[29:06] it's the mind that's interpreting
[29:08] relational shapes to recognize he's
[29:10] further away they're closer there's
[29:11] light here there's a the mind is doing
[29:13] it's the biggest part of the vision to
[29:16] where the mind gets a pixelated image
[29:18] and then the brain says I know how to
[29:20] fill this in sharpen the details and
[29:23] make this look complete
[29:24] that's what uh Google The Almighty
[29:26] Google has just recently rolled out with
[29:28] their latest pixel 7 I believe it is to
[29:30] where now they can take your old blurry
[29:33] photos
[29:34] and make them clear
[29:36] because that's what your brain does
[29:38] your brain is able to take something
[29:40] that's blurry and fill in the gaps and
[29:42] colorize it and and makes things sharp
[29:44] and make things work and focus it you
[29:46] have a blind spot a physical blind spot
[29:48] in your eyes and your periphery
[29:50] it's absolutely there you there's
[29:52] different ways that you can experiment
[29:53] with it and see it but what does your
[29:55] brain do it knows there's something
[29:57] there and it fills it in it's the it's
[30:00] the original healing tool right
[30:02] Photoshop figured it out that our brains
[30:05] have a healing tool we'll take what's
[30:06] next to it and use that to click alt
[30:10] click click right
[30:12] and it's going to fill in the blank with
[30:14] what's around it
[30:16] and that's how Photoshop works with the
[30:18] healing tool or brush sometimes it's
[30:19] just taking what's nearby and and making
[30:22] the assumption that hey this is what
[30:24] ought to be there and so if you try this
[30:26] I don't know how I'm just guessing I
[30:27] don't know if this would really work if
[30:28] you tried to do that with baldness or
[30:30] something then you've got to be sure
[30:32] you're getting the hair not the bald
[30:33] part of the baldness just keeps getting
[30:35] bigger and bigger I'm assuming that's
[30:38] how it works
[30:41] so now Jesus has healed something in the
[30:45] physical part
[30:46] and he clearly can see now better than
[30:49] he had before
[30:50] and this is where the story is
[30:52] fascinating because he says and after
[30:54] that as if healing his blind eyes wasn't
[30:56] fascinating enough after that he put his
[30:58] hands again upon his eyes and made him
[31:00] look up
[31:02] and this if you read this there's I
[31:05] don't know what the initial knee-jerk
[31:06] reaction might be I can't remember how I
[31:08] begin to process this years ago before
[31:10] the Lord quickened this to me that
[31:13] there's it's as if he prayed and he kind
[31:16] of healed him
[31:18] so he needs to pray again because that
[31:20] doesn't make sense he sees men as trees
[31:22] walking maybe Jesus was needed to pray
[31:25] for him again or sometimes it just takes
[31:26] a couple times to get it right but he
[31:28] does this to demonstrate something to us
[31:30] very important especially in light of
[31:32] the fact that the disciples were there
[31:35] watching all these Miracles Mark chapter
[31:37] 6 12 loaves of baskets of bread taking
[31:39] up the leftovers out of those love that
[31:41] love and then they come later he walks
[31:43] on the water he comes later he feeds
[31:44] four thousand again and they're
[31:46] witnessing all sorts of Miracles and
[31:47] then Jesus makes one comment like great
[31:49] we did bring enough bread
[31:51] there's a reason why this story takes
[31:54] place immediately afterwards because now
[31:56] the blind man could see in a lot of the
[31:58] same ways that the disciples could see
[32:00] they could see things he could see
[32:02] shapes he could see the image of things
[32:04] he could see things walking and moving
[32:06] he could even say what they were but
[32:08] something more was missing and so this
[32:10] is a call back to what the disciples
[32:12] were going through and this is
[32:13] addressing the struggle the disciples so
[32:15] these first several chapters to
[32:17] recognize that there's something greater
[32:19] and maybe more important first that we
[32:21] need or that we're ultimately needing
[32:24] than just saying whoa Miracles awesome
[32:26] wonderful this is great
[32:28] he put his hands on him again
[32:31] and put his hands again upon his eyes
[32:33] and made him look up and notice the
[32:35] phrase and he was restored and saw every
[32:38] man clearly
[32:41] now if I could just kind of jump a
[32:43] little bit Christ
[32:44] healed the physical part the first time
[32:47] the second time he healed the mental
[32:49] part
[32:51] and the second touch was not to fix kind
[32:53] of get a further healing like ah I
[32:55] prayed I prayed I thought you'd get 20
[32:57] 20 the first time I prayed for you but I
[32:59] don't know maybe like maybe I don't know
[33:01] 120 20. I don't your vision isn't quite
[33:04] right let's try this again right
[33:06] crack the knuckles
[33:08] you know
[33:10] I don't know what just happened there
[33:12] let's try this again no he knows exactly
[33:14] what he's doing he's demonstrating
[33:15] something this is for us for our
[33:16] learning for our benefit in the
[33:17] scripture and so the second touch wasn't
[33:20] to heal the physical part was to heal
[33:21] the emotional part
[33:23] just to heal the mental part the part of
[33:25] the mind that makes sense of what's
[33:27] being sent into the body now we could
[33:29] make this we can make this very very
[33:31] simple
[33:32] that our
[33:34] and the the visual Acuity of a an infant
[33:38] is
[33:40] at a young age they're not seeing very
[33:43] far images aren't very sharp very clear
[33:45] but by the time they're two years old I
[33:47] think they begin to it begins to get to
[33:49] what's 20 20. and so a lot of the things
[33:51] that they say and do in the way they
[33:52] interact in those first couple years is
[33:55] due to the fact that they don't see like
[33:56] they ought to but then once they're two
[33:58] years old their vision is 20 20. and
[34:01] then they begin to build a database
[34:05] of what things ought to feel and look
[34:07] like in depth perception in softness and
[34:11] all sorts of things to wear now that's
[34:13] how they begin to learn to walk and to
[34:15] reach and to run and all sorts of things
[34:17] because it's the Mind as a muscle is
[34:20] learning to interpret data and interpret
[34:23] the signals that are being sent to the
[34:24] mind
[34:25] so if you take someone who's been blind
[34:26] especially from birth someone who's been
[34:28] blind and all of a sudden they're able
[34:30] to see the information doesn't make
[34:31] sense
[34:33] that's why when they've recorded this of
[34:35] people who have received their sight by
[34:37] the miracle of Science in adult life
[34:39] who've been blind all or if not most of
[34:42] their lives they can't tell that the
[34:44] Moon is not right there
[34:46] they don't know what a curb is they'll
[34:48] trip right over it
[34:49] they could see they could see something
[34:51] very large in one particular instance I
[34:53] read about this man was at Costco
[34:55] and he sees this great huge pile of
[34:58] pallets or what he thought were pallets
[34:59] he's like oh my goodness why did they
[35:01] put this big huge large mass in the
[35:03] middle of the aisle and he says it to
[35:04] his wife and she was like you know what
[35:06] are you doing and it was it was a lady
[35:08] on a on an electric scooter
[35:11] hey because he can't discern among the
[35:14] blobs and the shapes he didn't know male
[35:16] from female
[35:17] he didn't know smile from frown because
[35:20] we learn all that growing up the next
[35:22] person who has a baby whenever you talk
[35:23] to your baby go you're so cute
[35:25] and and always use the frown to
[35:28] demonstrate happiness and it's going to
[35:30] grow up thinking why are you mad at me
[35:32] right
[35:34] because it's visual cues it's learning
[35:38] and that's what's taking place I'd love
[35:41] to spend much more time on it maybe we
[35:42] can in the future but it was the God
[35:45] gave them in the second touch the
[35:47] database and the mental acuity the
[35:49] visual Acuity and the visual perception
[35:51] of an adult
[35:52] in One Touch
[35:54] he had the mind of an adult who could
[35:57] now tell and see every man clearly and
[36:00] not wonder is he happy is he sad is he
[36:02] close is he far away
[36:03] is it male or female which is becoming a
[36:06] bigger problem I guess these days
[36:08] ma'am sir is the my go-to these days
[36:11] and there's a way that now he could see
[36:14] with full understanding he saw every man
[36:16] clearly
[36:17] now if I could say this so I can try to
[36:19] move on in this just as the total
[36:22] healing of the Blind Man's eyes or the
[36:24] Blind Man's Vision the total healing of
[36:25] his vision relied upon the healing of
[36:27] his mind
[36:29] our physical healing depends upon the
[36:32] condition of our mind
[36:33] his total visual healing the healing of
[36:36] his visual cortex visual Acuity visual
[36:38] perception his whole eyesight relied
[36:40] upon not just the healing of the
[36:41] physical part but the healing of the
[36:43] mental part and now in another way using
[36:45] this as a type our physical healing May
[36:48] first Rely Upon Our Minds being healed
[36:50] before the physical part is healed it's
[36:53] demonstrating these very verses that
[36:55] there's a physical part that takes place
[36:56] but total healing relies upon a mental
[36:59] part now we want to apply that to the
[37:00] fact that oh I need healing of this
[37:02] problem my body's broken this is not
[37:03] fixed I have this disease I have this
[37:05] chronic illness whatever it may be God
[37:08] May needs to get your mind healed right
[37:10] and your vision healed right so you can
[37:13] receive the healing of your body
[37:15] brother random says we read these
[37:16] statements last time if you do not
[37:17] approach Divine Healing right you'll
[37:19] fail to receive your healing
[37:21] he says in many times many many times
[37:23] people want to be so tranquilized
[37:26] they want this that or the other what
[37:28] does it mean by tranquilized they want
[37:30] their mind numbed
[37:32] they want their mind tranquilized white
[37:34] you're anxious you're nervous you're
[37:35] fearful you're doubting you're
[37:36] suspicious you wonder if you deserve
[37:38] this you wonder if it's for you you're
[37:40] wondering if it's because of this or
[37:41] because of that there's all sorts of
[37:42] things going through your mind right all
[37:44] sorts of fears lumped into your mind
[37:46] everybody says people want to be
[37:47] tranquilized we'll pick up on this
[37:49] Wednesday night Lord willing you know
[37:50] they want their mind to go blank or be
[37:52] numbed
[37:54] that's what they'd rather happen is just
[37:56] get tranquilized instead of come to an
[37:58] understanding
[37:59] listen let's just say and I hope I'm not
[38:01] venturing here
[38:03] but if you were sick because you did
[38:05] something wrong and you just want your
[38:06] nine mine numb then you're never going
[38:08] to get the sense that what needs to be
[38:09] made right in order for your healing
[38:12] you're never going to get the sense of
[38:13] it
[38:14] and so don't even fear that if God says
[38:16] well you're sick because this happened
[38:17] all right let's make it right
[38:19] that's it that's how simple it is
[38:22] and so people he says that you gotta if
[38:24] you do not approach Divine Healing right
[38:26] you'll fail to receive your healing the
[38:28] other statement we used in conjunction
[38:29] with this last time this is just a
[38:30] statement
[38:31] you must know how to approach God for
[38:33] healing like you do with salvation
[38:37] I know it's a familiar
[38:39] Maybe
[38:42] if you know how you must know how to
[38:45] approach God for healing
[38:47] the same way you do for salvation so
[38:49] we've emphasized this a lot for several
[38:50] services and so I don't feel like I'm
[38:52] out on a limb here
[38:54] to try to touch on this very quickly but
[38:56] in your approach to Salvation
[38:59] there's a certain process God follows in
[39:01] order for you to be saved listen you
[39:03] don't go to bed and wake up saved right
[39:07] you don't go to bed I'm an awful sinner
[39:09] I hate my life and then you wake up in
[39:10] the morning like bless God
[39:12] right I feel like a Christian today I
[39:14] know that happens right we go to bed
[39:16] feeling awful and wake up maybe feeling
[39:17] good or maybe it's vice versa I don't
[39:19] know uh but
[39:21] it doesn't happen while you're asleep
[39:24] and so I I need to go through this very
[39:27] very quickly because we've been taking a
[39:28] lot of time just to this first first
[39:30] part this first third or quarter of the
[39:33] service
[39:34] do the math
[39:35] so I'll try to go quickly this is a
[39:37] familiar concept so I think I can Breeze
[39:39] through this very fast but let's examine
[39:41] it let's let's not Overlook what's
[39:43] happening but in Acts chapter 2
[39:45] Peter's preaching and let all the house
[39:47] of Israel know assuredly that you've
[39:49] crucified the Lord Of Glory he's really
[39:51] just hammered in his sermon he got to
[39:52] that clinching point and then verse 37
[39:55] when they'd heard the sermon that was
[39:57] preached it says they were pricked in
[39:58] their heart
[40:00] and asked what do we do
[40:02] and so the heart was provoked by what
[40:05] Peter was preaching you say this way the
[40:07] word stirred up their emotions
[40:09] the word stood up their thought process
[40:11] because now they had put themselves in
[40:13] the place of the guilty hands that
[40:15] crucified the Messiah instead of saying
[40:17] well that's a weird story and walking
[40:18] away they're like they're in the story
[40:20] now like they're there and they're on in
[40:23] the guilty chair they're being indicted
[40:25] and they're like what do I do like they
[40:27] felt it what happened the word had kind
[40:29] of stirred up their hearts or stirred
[40:30] their emotions because the Bible says
[40:32] they were pricked in their heart that
[40:33] means to pain the mind to agitate it
[40:36] it's used to the emotion of Sorrow so
[40:38] there had been some sorrow some guilt
[40:40] some conviction stirred up within them
[40:43] and now that they're experiencing this
[40:44] disconcerting emotion they take it the
[40:46] step first Peter what do we do about
[40:48] this and he tells them to repent
[40:51] when they said they were pricked in
[40:52] their heart it's the seed of thought
[40:53] passion desire appetite affection
[40:55] purpose and Endeavors they had found
[40:58] that it was right there in their mind
[41:00] they felt that that was what pricked and
[41:02] they asked what they would do and so if
[41:03] you recognize Peter preached the word
[41:05] the first thing it did is it stirred up
[41:07] their heart and G and that's what
[41:09] brought him to repent he says repent be
[41:11] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[41:12] remission of sins and you shall receive
[41:14] the gift of the Holy Ghost so we got our
[41:15] text in for the baptism down and and
[41:18] he's and he says that and then he says
[41:19] they did they called upon the Lord they
[41:21] were they were baptized and it added
[41:23] souls to the to the kingdom that day
[41:25] through this process and so their soul
[41:27] was healed and recognized the healing of
[41:30] the Soul began with an attitude
[41:32] adjustment in the person's heart
[41:35] at one moment did they just hear about
[41:38] this Jesus right may have been the very
[41:40] ones or she's yelling crucify him and
[41:42] they had a particular way of seeing it
[41:44] at a particular way of viewing the
[41:46] Messiah had a particular way of using
[41:47] the viewing the disciples but now
[41:49] through the preacher of the word their
[41:51] mind is changed and their hearts and
[41:54] emotions and their Spirits are being
[41:55] stirred up all by the preaching of the
[41:57] word and it put them in the condition to
[41:59] therefore repent and receive the Holy
[42:01] Ghost that's how the soul is healed
[42:03] in second Corinthians chapter 7 verse 10
[42:05] it says for Godly sorrow worketh
[42:07] repentance to Salvation not to be
[42:09] repented of but the sorrow of the world
[42:11] worketh death
[42:13] what is it Sorrow by God's word brings
[42:16] repentance that you need not regret that
[42:18] there's no regret associated with that
[42:20] you don't have to regret being sorry
[42:21] there's no regret Godly sorrow Works
[42:24] repentance not to be repented of but
[42:25] then there's this worldly sorrow that
[42:27] works death
[42:28] why because Godly sorrow is not just
[42:30] mere remorse or regret it's a star which
[42:33] is not selfish it's not woe it's me it
[42:36] the motive and objective is not selfish
[42:38] Godly sorrow is something that's more
[42:40] than just remorse because the worldly
[42:41] sorrow
[42:42] arises from the selfish motives worldly
[42:45] considerations like oh I shouldn't have
[42:47] done that it's a different level
[42:48] remember Judas sorrowed
[42:51] but found no place of repentance so
[42:53] there's a worldly saw worldly emotion
[42:55] worldly crying worldly regret worldly oh
[42:57] I shouldn't have done that but then
[42:58] there's a Godly sorrow
[43:00] that the word of God creates
[43:02] that the word of God brings and it's a
[43:05] change of heart or you can say a change
[43:06] of mind
[43:07] and this is why it's so critical because
[43:09] that repentance is coming to your right
[43:12] mind
[43:13] that's what repentance you come to your
[43:15] right mind you own it you acknowledge it
[43:16] you realize that there's this horror
[43:18] it's not regret just an uneasy feeling I
[43:20] wonder if I should repent or I maybe
[43:22] there is something to this you can't
[43:24] just try it but this Godly sorrow is a
[43:26] change of mind it's coming to your right
[43:28] mind
[43:29] because sorrow Judas sorrow but sorrow
[43:32] in itself is not repentance
[43:34] but if it's Godly sorrow it contributes
[43:37] to that repentance
[43:40] and so it's in that state of repentance
[43:43] which is being in your right mind that
[43:45] you bypass all other emotional states
[43:48] remember how brother Brown talks about
[43:50] you know he's receiving God while you're
[43:51] in your mind because people later in
[43:53] life can lose their minds and they're
[43:55] not held accountable but it's in that
[43:56] moment or that time when they're in the
[43:58] right mind
[43:59] and so being in your right minded it
[44:01] cuts off it goes past all these other
[44:03] emotional states that might oppose
[44:05] salvation all the barriers to receive in
[44:07] Salvation in that moment all questions
[44:09] are gone in that moment all doubt is
[44:11] gone in that moment all fear is gone and
[44:12] you receive the Lord and you receive
[44:14] Christ and it changes your nature
[44:17] so let's catch that dynamic in Salvation
[44:19] the word preach in Acts chapter to the
[44:21] word preached brought them to the proper
[44:24] mindset or the proper mental state to
[44:27] receive the word of God to repent and to
[44:29] receive salvation
[44:31] and if you can recall now and I'm not
[44:32] going to try to repreach the last 10
[44:34] services but remember all the different
[44:36] foundational services to Christ my
[44:37] healer the original the first initial
[44:40] and original way to receive any blessing
[44:42] from God is at the word by the word
[44:46] remember we we you say it so often we
[44:48] believe it so often that we don't really
[44:49] stop and think okay then what's
[44:51] happening
[44:52] if it's by the word then what literally
[44:55] is happening if I'm receiving it by the
[44:57] word because if not we're taking it like
[44:59] what we need to do is we just need to
[45:02] have like you know tile our ceilings in
[45:04] The Bible Pages of the Bible or have you
[45:07] know the Bible printed out on their
[45:08] sheets or our comforter get a weighted
[45:10] blanket that's stuffed with the King
[45:12] James version Bible right and I'm just
[45:13] going to sleep under this in the word by
[45:15] osmosis is going to Bear upon my
[45:18] sickness what is it that's happening
[45:19] when the word does it what's taking
[45:22] place when the first an initial way to
[45:23] receive any blessing from God is at the
[45:26] word what does the word actually doing
[45:30] whereas it's having its impact
[45:33] how is it taking place
[45:35] this isn't self-serving I think this is
[45:37] the obvious the word is first
[45:39] penetrating to your emotions and your
[45:41] mind and it's dealing with the condition
[45:43] of your heart it's dealing with your
[45:44] emotions it's dealing with your attitude
[45:46] and the first initial way for something
[45:48] to happen is for the word to take your
[45:51] mind and your attitude in your heart and
[45:53] to adjust it and get it right and it
[45:55] puts you in the channel to receive a
[45:57] benefit from God
[45:59] the Bible says in Hebrews 4 12 for the
[46:01] word of God is quick and powerful and
[46:03] sharper than any two-edged sword
[46:04] piercing even to the dividing asunder of
[46:07] Soul and Spirit and the joints and
[46:09] Marrow what does it do at Pierce's Body
[46:10] Spirit Soul the word is applicable to
[46:13] Soul Spirit body the scripture is very
[46:15] very rich and deep it divides among Soul
[46:17] spirit and body and is a discerner of
[46:20] the thoughts and intents of the heart
[46:23] we know that the word of God is light
[46:25] light is what makes manifest what light
[46:27] is what discloses light is what gives us
[46:29] the capacity to see that's what colors
[46:32] are that's what vision is it's the
[46:34] taking in of light and focusing the
[46:36] light and letting so much in and so much
[46:37] out and then the brain interpreted it
[46:39] all begins with light
[46:42] the word is a light it is a discerner of
[46:45] the thoughts and intents of the heart
[46:46] the thoughts at your considerations
[46:48] it's what you're pondering
[46:50] what you're deliberating
[46:52] your thoughts of the heart and the
[46:54] intents it's speaking again to your
[46:56] meditation your manner of feeling what
[46:58] your will is it's your act of thinking
[47:01] so now I I know that we've been
[47:04] we've been in this subject now this
[47:06] morning for quite a while but stay with
[47:08] me because you're looking at this we're
[47:10] wanting to understand what the barriers
[47:12] are to Healing maybe the boundaries
[47:14] within healing within which healing
[47:16] works because you'll find that the way
[47:17] God does it even though he might do it
[47:20] many different ways take a man out from
[47:22] around the crowd spit clay put Clay on
[47:24] his eyes he might do different things to
[47:26] loose the tongue there's a lot of
[47:27] different ways but you'll find that he
[47:28] creates these boundaries he's always
[47:30] working within the framework of his word
[47:33] and so if the word is a discerner of our
[47:36] thinking of our emotions of our feelings
[47:39] it discerns it to address it
[47:44] yeah that if you could just change your
[47:46] attitude towards church I don't like
[47:47] going to church because brother Aaron
[47:48] always makes me feel like I I'm doubting
[47:50] and I apologize that's certainly not my
[47:52] goal but if you if it's making you feel
[47:55] that way it's there to address it
[47:58] hey it's like okay God wouldn't be
[48:01] uncovering it he's kind of like see this
[48:02] see this
[48:04] see that let's deal with it right but
[48:08] some of us get embarrassed right and as
[48:09] soon as we start feeling oh no and we
[48:11] run away from it because God is not like
[48:13] our parents he's not like our best
[48:15] friends he's not like our Social Circle
[48:16] he's maybe he's not like maybe some
[48:17] preachers we've experienced God is not
[48:20] the one that exposes something to go hey
[48:23] right this is not a playground God's not
[48:25] trying to make fun of you he's not
[48:27] trying to be a little he's not trying to
[48:28] make you go viral and and cancel you if
[48:31] the spirit discerns it and brings it out
[48:33] he does it to address it
[48:36] he if he uncovers anything broken he
[48:39] does it because he wants to fix it he
[48:41] doesn't bring it up in your heart and
[48:42] also you feel I'm broke and I've got
[48:44] this complex I got this car so that God
[48:46] can say yeah see I told you you're
[48:47] scarred I told you you're broken I told
[48:49] you you have all these breaches he's
[48:51] saying no I'm only doing it so I can fix
[48:53] it you've covered it up you've denied it
[48:55] you've filled it up with this you've
[48:57] done that he says no no I'm washing all
[48:59] this away and I'm bringing it to the
[49:00] surface and I know it makes you really
[49:02] really uncomfortable but I would never
[49:04] do this if I wasn't wanting to fix it
[49:06] before I finally fix it
[49:09] I'm not trying to make you feel bad I'm
[49:11] not trying to make you feel broken
[49:12] that's one thing I say personally but I
[49:14] say it with some restraint it has
[49:16] agonized me to experience situations
[49:18] where you're told that you're broken
[49:20] just so that person can make you feel
[49:23] that they are the ones that can fix you
[49:27] and they do it in a humanistic way and
[49:29] we've experienced it so often where
[49:31] we're treated that way in a way to be
[49:33] manipulated and to be abused and taken
[49:34] advantage of that when God begins to do
[49:36] it we get a little bit fearful because
[49:38] that's the way the world has treated us
[49:40] but listen God does it because he wants
[49:43] you not himself to receive the glory
[49:45] necessarily but he wants you to receive
[49:48] your healing
[49:51] he'll if he uncovers anything broken he
[49:53] does it to fix it not just to expose it
[49:58] have you noticed this a lot of times in
[50:00] the gift of discernment brother Bynum is
[50:02] in the prayer lines he's Discerning
[50:03] issues but what is he doing he discerns
[50:06] them he's not just telling them some
[50:07] anecdote from the past
[50:09] you'll find that most often there's
[50:11] times when it's not a problem or issue
[50:13] but the discernment is the name or the
[50:15] address right and we say that's benign
[50:18] but that's Supernatural so you can
[50:20] realize that's a miracle that could only
[50:21] come from God and that lifts their faith
[50:24] to be healed but what about all the
[50:26] times where he says this happened in
[50:27] your life
[50:29] and he's not the the doctor standing
[50:31] before you and he's identified these
[50:33] tumors on your toe or the doctor's doing
[50:34] this it's all relative to the sickness
[50:37] or better yet they're healing
[50:40] there's things that discernment would
[50:42] uncover in order to address the issues
[50:44] whether what was causing the sickness or
[50:47] the barrier to them being healed
[50:50] something in their mind they keep going
[50:51] back to in the sermon the Inside Man and
[50:54] I'm just going to have to keep preaching
[50:55] here he says you think the heart trouble
[50:57] left you while you were sitting there
[50:59] and this is a man coming in the prayer
[51:00] line he says he's Discerning that it was
[51:02] heart trouble this is really interesting
[51:03] to the man I'm sure he's like oh yes do
[51:05] you think you left you while you're
[51:06] sitting there do you believe that God's
[51:08] going to make you well you do come here
[51:09] praise almighty God May the blessing
[51:11] rest upon this man knowing that Satan
[51:13] would send him to a premature grave if
[51:15] he could now I curse this horrible
[51:17] Affliction and as you the Creator
[51:19] standing here can create may he be
[51:21] healed in Jesus Christ's name amen God
[51:24] bless you brother God bless you your
[51:26] attitude is enough to bring the healing
[51:30] what was the purpose of the discernment
[51:32] what was the purpose of the prayer what
[51:33] was the purpose of all of it to get that
[51:35] attitude because your attitude is enough
[51:37] to bring the healing
[51:39] brother Brian said the attitude is what
[51:41] brings the results
[51:44] the sermon proven his word but before
[51:46] now this is where I think we're getting
[51:48] right into the thick of it this is
[51:50] probably the
[51:51] that uh real turn here I think this is
[51:55] where we're taking our turn we're
[51:56] getting into the meat of where I want to
[51:57] be today but before we pray for the sick
[51:59] we've got to get the people in that
[52:01] attitude
[52:03] it's the attitude that always brings the
[52:04] results
[52:05] it's the attitude that you take towards
[52:07] God here's the woman touched His Garment
[52:09] she was healed with the blood issue
[52:10] soldiers spit in his face and put a
[52:12] crown on his Thorns ahead and felt no
[52:14] virtue it's your approach right talking
[52:16] about different touches different
[52:17] attitudes different approaches it's your
[52:20] Repro approach the attitude is what it
[52:22] takes and that's what it is tonight dear
[52:24] friend it takes the attitude
[52:26] we are and believe that we are in the
[52:28] presence of Jesus Christ
[52:30] but it's your attitude that brings the
[52:32] results we've learned that in scripture
[52:34] already
[52:37] that Christ could be there in the boat
[52:39] and a loaf of bread nearby but with the
[52:41] wrong attitude it'll never benefit them
[52:43] the mechanics are here and so is the
[52:45] Dynamics
[52:46] I love this if you can just get started
[52:49] God will do the rest I love that if you
[52:52] can just get started oh how to get
[52:54] started get the right attitude attitude
[52:56] adjustment I think we've been you're
[52:57] saying remember there and this has been
[52:58] a few Services you've really been
[52:59] hitting this yes
[53:00] it's just an attitude adjustment
[53:03] and I I've thought about this recently
[53:05] in Christ saying well what's harder to
[53:07] forgive sins or to heal the body
[53:09] listen how many of you have witnessed a
[53:11] miracle in the in the flesh and you've
[53:13] seen it you know God's here on the flesh
[53:14] right okay we got hands on so we've seen
[53:17] God do things that we can verify
[53:19] physically if he can do that can he also
[53:22] heal the mind and the body
[53:24] can he also do that which we cannot see
[53:26] is he not able if you can just get
[53:29] started God will do the rest how do I
[53:32] get started get the right attitude is
[53:34] your mind Afflicted yes how do I get
[53:36] started to pray
[53:37] are you sad sing hymns get if you just
[53:40] get started what does it take to get
[53:42] started just have the right approach
[53:44] just have the right attitude because
[53:46] then God does the rest you don't have to
[53:49] get yourself in the frame of mind to
[53:50] heal yourself you don't have to get
[53:52] yourself in the frame of mind to
[53:53] diagnose what your sickness is you don't
[53:55] have to get yourself in the right frame
[53:57] of mind to get started isn't to figure
[53:58] out the remedy to get started isn't to
[54:01] figure out how to do it to get started
[54:02] is just to believe and to have the right
[54:04] attitude towards the word of God God
[54:05] says I'll take it from here
[54:09] in Acts chapter 14 verses 8 to 10 this
[54:12] to be very very important to catch this
[54:14] and they're sad their side of certain
[54:16] man at lystra impotent in his feet being
[54:19] a from his mother's womb who
[54:21] never had walked
[54:23] now remember too also how that when
[54:25] people have been
[54:27] uh suffered traumatic injury and they
[54:29] can actually repair the spinal cord a
[54:31] lot of things they can do to fix the
[54:33] injury but then the brain has to learn
[54:34] to walk all over again
[54:36] the atrophy the certain things in the
[54:37] muscle and it takes sometimes years of
[54:39] physical therapy to get back to walking
[54:41] and they do it because it's just the
[54:43] it's the the remarkable all healing is
[54:45] Divine Healing it's the way that God
[54:47] made the body it's the way he made the
[54:49] mind it's all part of God's program and
[54:51] this man was impotent from birth had
[54:52] never walked the man the same heard Paul
[54:55] speaks so now the man this impotent man
[54:59] this uh crippled man is sitting hearing
[55:02] the word of God preached
[55:04] who Paul Behold steadfastly beholding
[55:07] Him so now as Paul's preaching he sees
[55:09] the man there being crippled they're
[55:12] listening to the word being preached and
[55:15] perceiving that he had failed to be
[55:17] healed Paul said with the loud voice
[55:19] stand upright on the thy feet and he
[55:22] leaped and walked
[55:25] even though he had never walked before
[55:27] he didn't get up all wobbly right
[55:30] he didn't need Physical Therapy Jesus
[55:32] said here's a card
[55:34] jeroboam down the street he's got a
[55:36] physical therapy Studio he'll stretch
[55:38] you out a little bit he'll get you on
[55:39] the bars he'll get you walking no it was
[55:41] all there mentally physically he left he
[55:43] walked he was agile he was quick he had
[55:46] the the coordination and the fluidity he
[55:48] had all that there God had touched him
[55:50] and healed him and noticed the order
[55:52] Paul is preaching the word
[55:55] and what did it do it built Faith
[55:57] because the man steadfastly believed he
[55:59] had Faith to be healed now whether or
[56:02] not the scripture is silent on this but
[56:05] Paul is preaching and the man had Faith
[56:07] now whether or not he had faith in his
[56:09] mind I believe I can be healed I believe
[56:11] I can be healed the word of God had
[56:13] raised his attitude and his faith and
[56:15] elevated his faith and so now with just
[56:17] faith it was faith that to be healed so
[56:20] then the climax comes the punch line
[56:22] comes the the flip the switch is flipped
[56:25] be rise up and in that moment without
[56:27] thinking about it without considering
[56:29] without worry there was this faith that
[56:31] could respond to the situation and he
[56:33] laughed and began to walk so the word
[56:34] preached Faith was built for the healing
[56:39] because it's remember the word the word
[56:42] the word the word the word that God's
[56:43] original way to receive a blessing is by
[56:45] the word
[56:46] and well I think we start doing is we
[56:48] start thinking oh it's got to be in that
[56:50] declaration right wake up be healed
[56:52] right it wasn't stand
[56:56] it was the word being preached and the
[56:58] faith was there
[56:59] it was being built it wasn't Thy word
[57:01] stand the faith was already there that
[57:03] was just the impetus that was what put
[57:05] it in motion
[57:06] for the round of the sermon identified
[57:08] Christ of all ages he says now just be
[57:09] reverent okay so
[57:12] um I I'm getting anxious about I just
[57:14] need to get my attitude right
[57:16] I'm starting to get nervous
[57:18] Lord help me
[57:20] I don't wanna I wanna get I I hope to
[57:22] just I want to just drive this now home
[57:24] today so now he's telling people at the
[57:26] end of this service and I want you to
[57:28] catch the principal not just get so
[57:30] zeroed in on all the mechanics and
[57:31] dynamics of this but this principle
[57:33] brother Ram's using be reverent look
[57:35] while they're getting the prayer line
[57:37] lined up you all give me your undivided
[57:39] attention now you must listen to what
[57:42] I'm telling you
[57:44] I mean think about that
[57:46] this is important one time there was a
[57:48] woman Jesus was passing through the
[57:50] country and he crossed over the sea and
[57:51] he went into a place where there was a
[57:53] woman with a blood issue and all the
[57:54] priests and them come out and they were
[57:55] making fun of him
[57:57] and there's a bunch out there that
[57:59] believed him
[58:00] and he was going through the crowd
[58:02] and the woman said within her heart and
[58:04] I listen close are you listening say
[58:07] Amen right
[58:08] now the woman see and he says and he's
[58:11] told him give me your undivided
[58:12] attention listen and I watch what he
[58:14] says with this the everyone the prayer
[58:16] lines being made up he says
[58:18] on anything
[58:20] distracts from what you're doing I know
[58:22] it's a fragment it says now the woman
[58:24] see on anything distracts from what
[58:26] you're doing you see every person is a
[58:30] he stops says I'm not dealing with you
[58:31] as a body I'm not just dealing with the
[58:33] physical part someone comes out there
[58:34] and they got cancer well I'm not just
[58:36] dealing with the cancer I'm not just
[58:38] dealing with the physical part I'm not
[58:39] dealing with you as a body I'm dealing
[58:41] with you as a spirit a soul
[58:43] and that moving
[58:45] if I could amplify this based upon as I
[58:48] read this in different parts of it in
[58:50] other places where premises be still and
[58:52] he deals with this very issue something
[58:55] happens it distracts he says I'm dealing
[58:57] with you as a spirit and that movie you
[58:59] got your mind doing somewhere else
[59:03] and I'm trying to get a hold of that
[59:06] so here someone needs to be healed so
[59:08] what's he doing listen pay attention
[59:09] right Focus no I'm saying that's brother
[59:12] Brandon but if you could do the same
[59:13] that'd be great follow my finger
[59:16] I hope you're listening Under the
[59:17] Influence today
[59:19] hey he says he's saying listen Focus
[59:21] right here watch me pay attention and
[59:24] he's saying he says because if you let
[59:26] your mind wander
[59:28] you get your mind going somewhere else
[59:30] and this phrase that's what I'm trying
[59:33] to get a hold of
[59:34] did you catch that
[59:36] right we think we can just sit here and
[59:38] doodle right or write out all the
[59:40] professional sports teams we could think
[59:41] about try to figure out what we're gonna
[59:43] do with our fantasy salary cap or we
[59:45] could plan our week out we could plan
[59:46] our days we can do it and we can draw
[59:47] and that what's happened as long as
[59:49] we're here our soul is over there going
[59:51] moon this is good yeah loving this right
[59:53] and maybe that's not their proper Soul
[59:55] voice maybe it should be more this is
[59:57] wonderful
[59:58] my soul loves this bread
[1:00:00] I did our uh Garrison Keeler cigarette
[1:00:03] demon voice I think but that's what
[1:00:05] we're thinking in our minds is yeah you
[1:00:07] know what I'm here and my soul's gonna
[1:00:10] get it right because there's a way we
[1:00:11] use the scripture well I don't even know
[1:00:13] what to pray for but my spirit does and
[1:00:14] I and and we think somehow it's getting
[1:00:16] it but listen the word he says that's
[1:00:19] what I'm trying to get a hold of and if
[1:00:21] you think I'm just asserting this and
[1:00:23] reading it out of place I'm going to use
[1:00:25] some more things or just know I got
[1:00:26] something else lined up right
[1:00:28] he's trying to get a hold of your mind
[1:00:31] that's what he's trying to get a hold no
[1:00:33] pay attention listen he doesn't say
[1:00:34] think about whatever you want make him
[1:00:36] get tranquilize make your mind go blank
[1:00:38] I'm going to talk to your soul for a
[1:00:39] moment he's got to do with your mind
[1:00:41] first that's what I'm trying to get a
[1:00:43] hold of but all these things that
[1:00:45] distract
[1:00:47] so what is it I think I have the
[1:00:49] scripture here Psalms 107 verse 20. he
[1:00:51] sent his word and healed them and
[1:00:54] delivered them from their destructions
[1:00:55] where's the word where is it first
[1:00:58] penetrating what does the word first
[1:01:00] come up against
[1:01:02] if you're deaf you'll never hear it if
[1:01:04] we just put it that way but then what
[1:01:07] wrestles with the vocalization what
[1:01:10] wrestles with the stand to your feet
[1:01:12] what wrestles with the information the
[1:01:15] signals that's being sent it's your
[1:01:17] spirit that is first confronted with the
[1:01:19] word it is your mind it is your emotion
[1:01:22] it is your memory Jesus do you not
[1:01:23] understand is your heart hardened do you
[1:01:25] not remember
[1:01:30] the word is trying to get a hold of that
[1:01:31] mind first
[1:01:33] the church age book chapter two brother
[1:01:35] Branham writes and Paul said that that
[1:01:37] word come in power as well as voice
[1:01:40] the word preached actually demonstrated
[1:01:43] itself I love how he phrases this like a
[1:01:47] flaming cutting sword it went to the
[1:01:49] consciences of men
[1:01:52] and like a surgeon's knife it cut out
[1:01:54] the diseases and said captives free
[1:01:56] I know listen I'm saying this very very
[1:01:59] respectful because I'm not I'm not
[1:02:01] trying to allude to anything but it's
[1:02:02] more if in my mind as I've tried to
[1:02:05] construct what is a weakness in our
[1:02:08] perception or how we actually perceive
[1:02:10] Divine Healing and prayer lines and the
[1:02:13] casting out of demons there's a way that
[1:02:15] we're purely looking at it from a
[1:02:18] physical standpoint
[1:02:20] that the minister speaking or laying on
[1:02:22] of hands or calling things out and we've
[1:02:24] seen the physical manifestation of
[1:02:27] healings or things taking place and
[1:02:29] we're looking at it in this sense of
[1:02:30] that's power over the cancer but brother
[1:02:33] Branham relays it this way like a
[1:02:35] flaming cutting sword the word
[1:02:38] went into the heart and the thinking and
[1:02:41] the mind of the man in there like a
[1:02:44] surgeon cut out diseases and broke
[1:02:47] chains and set the captive free and once
[1:02:50] they were free in their heart they could
[1:02:52] be free in their body
[1:02:54] that's how the word he sent his word and
[1:02:57] healed them if he sends his word and he
[1:02:59] heals you of cancer let me say this it
[1:03:02] first healed your mind healed your heart
[1:03:04] and got you in a position to believe I
[1:03:07] don't care if this is hereditary I don't
[1:03:08] care if my family members died from this
[1:03:10] it doesn't matter to me if I'm only
[1:03:12] given two months to live I believe that
[1:03:15] I can be healed
[1:03:17] and the word first sets the conscience
[1:03:19] of man right
[1:03:21] what is the conscience of man described
[1:03:23] here it's the heart the Inner Man
[1:03:25] the spirit
[1:03:27] it's that place
[1:03:29] that influences every part of our life
[1:03:33] I I want to reference it very quickly
[1:03:35] because I may need to skip some things
[1:03:36] here Brothers just look closely if I
[1:03:38] skip around
[1:03:39] but
[1:03:40] our attitude and our feeling our emotion
[1:03:43] it colors what we experience
[1:03:46] have you ever been sick and in pain and
[1:03:48] you go to do something that's supposed
[1:03:49] to be nice and you don't enjoy it at all
[1:03:51] why because you're the mood you're in
[1:03:53] the pain you're feeling
[1:03:55] there's things that you ate you smelt
[1:03:57] you witnessed you heard that because of
[1:03:59] your anxiety or depression or whatever
[1:04:01] you're going through that time maybe a
[1:04:02] loss of a loved one or whatever it is
[1:04:03] maybe years later you come across the
[1:04:06] same thing months later whatever it is
[1:04:07] and that whole experience has been
[1:04:09] colored by your mood your feeling your
[1:04:12] emotions it's because that that mind the
[1:04:14] conscience of man colors our lives
[1:04:30] is any Afflicted among you
[1:04:32] he says let them pray
[1:04:34] is any Mary
[1:04:36] let him sing Psalms
[1:04:39] in the sermon Christ knocking at the
[1:04:41] door I'm skipping a few things here so
[1:04:43] it's I don't know if it's just a couple
[1:04:44] slides a couple scriptures
[1:04:46] the sermon Christ knocking at the door
[1:04:47] in the discernment again Rochester he
[1:04:49] says I'm a stranger to you lady you're
[1:04:51] standing here for someone else
[1:04:53] and the lady is in a hospital been very
[1:04:55] sick cancer so the woman is standing
[1:04:57] here and she's there
[1:04:58] for somebody else
[1:05:00] now I realized I skipped over some very
[1:05:02] important principles
[1:05:04] but whatever's happened to you in your
[1:05:06] life is in there somewhere
[1:05:09] whatever you've been through whatever
[1:05:10] experienced your brain has logged it
[1:05:12] memories
[1:05:13] reason affection experience because
[1:05:16] Jesus actually wanted to go back in
[1:05:18] their minds and kind of bring it up
[1:05:19] let's go back to this what happened
[1:05:20] think about it right because it's in
[1:05:23] there somewhere do you not remember is
[1:05:24] your heart hardened or now there's some
[1:05:26] sort of numbness what's going on now
[1:05:27] Jesus brother Brandon is he's Discerning
[1:05:29] this he says you're standing here for
[1:05:31] someone who's sick they're in the
[1:05:31] hospital doctors can do no more he says
[1:05:34] in your need of prayer too because you
[1:05:37] got a heavy heart
[1:05:39] now we know that that's just a phrase
[1:05:41] right
[1:05:43] right I mean it's not that we wait
[1:05:46] someone heart if we put it on a scale
[1:05:47] and go oh they've been through some
[1:05:48] stuff I mean their heart weighs 40
[1:05:50] pounds right maybe they've been through
[1:05:52] some buffets I don't know but there's a
[1:05:54] way that you can look at it where
[1:05:55] someone who has it's it's the heaviness
[1:05:57] of spirit that if we could think
[1:05:59] literally now there's something being
[1:06:01] stored
[1:06:03] away something being deposited into our
[1:06:05] emotions our experience these things can
[1:06:07] be scars complexes Shadows why the Bible
[1:06:10] is I I skipped over the Bible says Every
[1:06:12] Man Has a chamber in his imagery
[1:06:15] chambers of his imagery and Ezekiel so
[1:06:17] there's actually Chambers they're not
[1:06:18] just channels that things pass through
[1:06:20] but they're storage places they're
[1:06:22] databases
[1:06:24] it's a place that things uh literal
[1:06:27] Chambers as the scripture says it and
[1:06:29] it's there that things get piled in and
[1:06:31] cause our vision problems because it
[1:06:32] becomes a heaviness it becomes a cloud
[1:06:34] it muddles our minds it confuses us why
[1:06:36] because all the input all the data all
[1:06:38] the Analytics
[1:06:39] that's why the analytics sometimes got
[1:06:41] to be careful with it because it's just
[1:06:42] going by what it knows what's been put
[1:06:44] in there the data it has available to it
[1:06:46] it doesn't actually know the outcome
[1:06:49] it's only speaking about probabilities
[1:06:52] and so in our minds we've got all sorts
[1:06:54] of things that's causing vision problems
[1:06:55] and here this woman has a heavy heart
[1:06:58] but God knows the secrets of the heart
[1:07:02] do you believe he can tell me what your
[1:07:04] heaviness is about
[1:07:06] it's because you want to have a baby
[1:07:09] he says because you want a baby
[1:07:11] and I see two Dark Shadows
[1:07:14] you've had two miscarriages in your life
[1:07:16] like in your time
[1:07:18] that's correct
[1:07:21] I know this that's a pretty maybe a
[1:07:22] heavy subject but do you realize what
[1:07:24] just took place there
[1:07:26] here's a woman who comes up in the
[1:07:27] prayer line for somebody else who has
[1:07:29] cancer and the spirit of God uncovers
[1:07:31] two Shadows
[1:07:33] that's in her heart she has a heavy
[1:07:35] heart
[1:07:36] there's a there's a heaviness in there
[1:07:38] do you want me God can tell you what the
[1:07:40] heaven says it's two Dark Shadows one
[1:07:42] for each miscarriage
[1:07:45] so what she had been through found a
[1:07:47] chamber in her spirit that brother
[1:07:49] Branham identifies as a dark shadow or
[1:07:51] two Dark Shadows and he relates it to
[1:07:53] two miscarriages now if we could take
[1:07:55] that and maybe make it applicable to all
[1:07:56] of us there's things we go through
[1:07:58] things we experience things we hear
[1:08:00] things we see things we do things that
[1:08:01] we have suffered and it becomes painful
[1:08:03] memories or Shadows within the chambers
[1:08:05] of our heart that hinder our faith and
[1:08:08] in doing so we'll hinder our expectation
[1:08:10] and this is done listen this is done not
[1:08:13] so that we would long for profit to be
[1:08:16] able to tell us how many Shadows we have
[1:08:18] but for us to be aware that God knows
[1:08:21] the deposits in your Chambers and God
[1:08:25] needs to and wants to address them he
[1:08:28] may not necessarily make sense of it he
[1:08:30] may not necessarily take a scar away or
[1:08:32] a complex away but he wants to address
[1:08:34] it to put it in its place or to heal it
[1:08:37] so that you can receive what you have
[1:08:38] need of
[1:08:41] there's so many things we go through
[1:08:42] that we can't seem to get over whether
[1:08:44] it be a mistake we've made in this
[1:08:46] instance there's a shadow that follows
[1:08:47] her of two miscarriages there's people
[1:08:49] that live under the condemnation because
[1:08:51] they've been taught that abortion is an
[1:08:52] unpardonable sin or they've been taught
[1:08:54] that this is an unpardonable sin that's
[1:08:56] an unpardonable sin and the devil builds
[1:08:58] them into a place of such a complex
[1:08:59] where that resides so deeply and so
[1:09:02] Heavenly in their religious mind and God
[1:09:05] may be identified in your own heart and
[1:09:07] your own Spirit today that that shadow
[1:09:09] is keeping you from accepting the love
[1:09:11] and forgiveness of God that Shadow's
[1:09:13] keeping you from your healing and he
[1:09:15] doesn't expose it to laugh at you and
[1:09:17] make fun of you he brings it up to
[1:09:19] liberate you he brings it up to say I
[1:09:22] know what you're going through I know
[1:09:24] the Shadow and if the light comes to
[1:09:26] expose the shadow it wants to shine in a
[1:09:28] way to chase it away
[1:09:34] I hope this is hitting home
[1:09:36] and the sermon the absolute again I
[1:09:37] wanted you to catch
[1:09:39] how brother Branham is talking about the
[1:09:42] word if I haven't framed this correctly
[1:09:44] God help me how the word deals with our
[1:09:46] vision first
[1:09:48] and our minds first last night we had a
[1:09:50] great prayer service and that's good
[1:09:52] that's fine laying hands upon the sick
[1:09:54] that's a good thing that's all it takes
[1:09:56] some time and there's some that there's
[1:09:58] something back there that they can't
[1:10:00] catch
[1:10:01] and you've got to get that person and
[1:10:03] find out what it that is now this is
[1:10:05] again the miracle of discernment
[1:10:07] there's something that's hindering them
[1:10:10] something laying in the way is this
[1:10:13] plain enough to where I could have just
[1:10:14] read this at the beginning we had
[1:10:15] already baptized and been at Rito's I
[1:10:18] apologize but this is as plain as it
[1:10:19] gets
[1:10:21] something laying in the way sometimes
[1:10:23] laying hands on the sick is enough but
[1:10:25] sometimes something lays in your way
[1:10:27] and he says in one little Shadow will
[1:10:29] vibrate it away now the library right
[1:10:32] away the healing one little Shadow we'll
[1:10:35] fight right away now the little lady in
[1:10:36] there a few moments ago she was so
[1:10:38] nervous so upset poor little fella she
[1:10:40] could even get her breath
[1:10:42] she was just in brother Brown's like
[1:10:44] he kind of begins to demonstrate gasping
[1:10:47] for breath and just carry it on now the
[1:10:49] thing you have to do here's just a
[1:10:51] little inside right
[1:10:52] but man's pulling back the curtain a
[1:10:54] little bit it's catching her spirit
[1:10:56] and then this is now again this is the
[1:11:00] dynamic on the prayer line but this is
[1:11:01] God's boundary of what the word is doing
[1:11:04] every time you sit and hear it he says
[1:11:07] and then you're he says you're catch
[1:11:08] it's catching your spirit and then
[1:11:09] you're projecting to her your very
[1:11:11] thought
[1:11:12] again I'm reading this to recognize that
[1:11:15] this is what the word wants to do change
[1:11:16] your thinking
[1:11:18] he says and you change your thinking
[1:11:20] then what does that then you could
[1:11:22] center her on Christ and from there she
[1:11:24] can go on but you've got to change her
[1:11:27] way of thinking
[1:11:29] in the way that he described it
[1:11:31] we're not going to try to figure out
[1:11:33] just exactly how he described it as he
[1:11:35] says at the end of this I think I have
[1:11:36] he says don't try to study it don't try
[1:11:37] to figure it out just believe it the
[1:11:39] goal is by some way to take whatever's
[1:11:42] missing in the person's Spirit or
[1:11:43] whatever is wrong he says to change her
[1:11:45] way of thinking she can't change it
[1:11:47] herself she's just running a whirl
[1:11:49] you've got to pick that up
[1:11:53] I literally saying you ought to change
[1:11:54] your way of thinking he says now there's
[1:11:56] a little something that gives you some
[1:11:57] he says don't try to study it don't do
[1:11:58] it just believe it and go on
[1:12:01] in other words let's recognize what the
[1:12:03] word is trying to do in that moment now
[1:12:05] I'm I'm very very close to closing I've
[1:12:07] got a couple more statements here but
[1:12:09] I'm and I'm going to be done
[1:12:12] let me try to summarize this though
[1:12:14] I think it's way too easy for us to
[1:12:16] discount
[1:12:18] how crucial the condition of our heart
[1:12:20] is to our healing
[1:12:22] it's way too easy to get so focused on
[1:12:25] the physical part that we're not
[1:12:26] realizing the damage that's being done
[1:12:27] in the mental part
[1:12:29] because we can get so focused on well
[1:12:31] I've had this problem I have that
[1:12:32] problem and we're worried about how bad
[1:12:34] the physical condition is getting and
[1:12:36] we're so worried about the physical part
[1:12:37] that's broken that we're actually
[1:12:38] inadvertently making it worse
[1:12:42] by the worry and the anxiety and the
[1:12:44] fear that the physical parts not being
[1:12:45] taken care of and meanwhile our spirit
[1:12:47] begins to starve
[1:12:49] I don't know if I'll preach it right
[1:12:51] here in this moment without give you the
[1:12:52] subtitle but one of the subjects we're
[1:12:54] going to be want to be talking about
[1:12:55] maybe it's going to want a Wednesday
[1:12:57] night is what's the saying is it uh feed
[1:12:59] the cold star of the flu which one is it
[1:13:04] starve the fever Okay Okay Google
[1:13:07] rewrite my notes no there's a saying out
[1:13:10] there that's like starve one feed the
[1:13:12] other but let me just put the starve
[1:13:13] your fear feed your faith
[1:13:16] whatever it is you're going through
[1:13:17] whatever it is you've got to starve the
[1:13:19] sickness starve the fear feed your faith
[1:13:22] there's something there that we begin to
[1:13:24] focus so much on the physical part oh I
[1:13:26] believe I can be healed I believe I can
[1:13:27] be healed I believe I can be healed oh I
[1:13:28] know this and we get chasing after the
[1:13:29] healing so much of the physical part we
[1:13:31] haven't stopped and said am I Afflicted
[1:13:33] am I happy am I a good place emotionally
[1:13:35] am I where I need to be spiritually is
[1:13:37] everything right in my spirit in my
[1:13:38] heart it is okay wonderful then I'm not
[1:13:40] going to panic about the physical part
[1:13:45] the word needs to build up your heart
[1:13:47] build up your emotions
[1:13:48] build up your mind it needs to give you
[1:13:51] courage and faith brother remember the
[1:13:53] sermon what hears thou Elijah brother
[1:13:55] Brown says if our heart condemn us not
[1:13:56] but if there's something in that life
[1:13:58] that condemns you again if you're
[1:14:00] thinking about this think about how he
[1:14:02] says somebody you they have something
[1:14:04] that's in the way a little vibration in
[1:14:07] your Shadow a little shattering Spirit
[1:14:08] can drive your healing away now he's
[1:14:10] using it this way he says there's
[1:14:12] something in your life that condemns you
[1:14:13] you better make that right I don't care
[1:14:15] what in the world you you just can't
[1:14:17] operate right
[1:14:18] make this in a much broader apply this
[1:14:21] more broadly than maybe a secret Center
[1:14:22] here today probably this more broadly
[1:14:24] than someone who's made a mistake or
[1:14:25] done something wrong that's sinful apply
[1:14:27] this in a much broader way you just
[1:14:28] can't operate right the Holy Spirit
[1:14:30] can't deal with you when you've got
[1:14:31] Prejudice come on somebody in
[1:14:34] selfishness and all those little things
[1:14:36] in you the Holy Spirit can never bless
[1:14:38] you
[1:14:39] you might get some intellectual emotions
[1:14:41] some work up
[1:14:43] let me just explain something to you now
[1:14:46] can you recognize I've run out of time
[1:14:48] to amplify this do you recognize what he
[1:14:50] just said
[1:14:51] how he just said that something
[1:14:52] Prejudice selfish or something in your
[1:14:54] spirit and the Holy Spirit can't bless
[1:14:56] you you might get emotional or get
[1:14:57] worked up but you're not getting the
[1:15:00] healing you need right it's not coming
[1:15:02] so he says let me explain it for
[1:15:03] instance when a woman gets married and
[1:15:05] she she's afraid she's not going to have
[1:15:07] a baby she won't have it
[1:15:09] but let her go and adopt a baby then
[1:15:11] she'll have one
[1:15:13] he said the books claim that that's nine
[1:15:15] out of ten will do that why it sets her
[1:15:18] body into the right emotion
[1:15:21] ask a doctor that doctor if that's not
[1:15:23] right why it puts her in the right
[1:15:26] attitude
[1:15:28] you're so worried and nervous about
[1:15:30] something happen what job feared It Came
[1:15:32] Upon him your fear actually in that
[1:15:33] sense has the ability to create or bring
[1:15:35] something your way or to manifest
[1:15:37] something and if you're all nervous and
[1:15:38] apprehensive about not being healed
[1:15:41] guess what somebody right you're
[1:15:44] probably not going to get healed because
[1:15:46] of your apprehension but if we could
[1:15:48] just relax ourselves and that's exactly
[1:15:51] what he's saying with respect to a woman
[1:15:52] who's wanting to have a baby her body
[1:15:54] gets set in the right emotion he says it
[1:15:56] puts her in the right attitude where did
[1:15:59] it take place not physically but
[1:16:01] emotionally in her mind
[1:16:04] it's shown us that our minds if you say
[1:16:05] our Spirits our emotions our eyesight
[1:16:07] our vision our hearts whatever you want
[1:16:09] to call it it's what rejects the word or
[1:16:11] filters out the word
[1:16:13] it's like that mind is that lens it's
[1:16:15] the corneus the very beginning layer of
[1:16:17] how that we view the word of God it's
[1:16:18] that the way that we look at the word
[1:16:21] he said if the heart's not right the
[1:16:23] emotions aren't right that we cannot
[1:16:24] receive the word properly that's what he
[1:16:27] told us about receiving the Holy Ghost
[1:16:28] to be born again
[1:16:29] that's what it's going to be to grow and
[1:16:31] mature in the word of God
[1:16:32] the condition of the Mind
[1:16:35] the mind your emotions your heart what
[1:16:37] he's showing us in this it must be said
[1:16:39] on the word by the word
[1:16:41] or it hinders the effect of the word
[1:16:43] the right attitude is looking at the
[1:16:45] word the right way and so the first
[1:16:47] thing the word wants to do is catch your
[1:16:49] mind and focus it
[1:16:51] now this is a lengthy statement in the
[1:16:53] sermon in life I I went I was upon I was
[1:16:56] gonna maybe at one point not have this
[1:16:57] in there
[1:16:58] but I think it's just too important
[1:17:01] um to have this whole
[1:17:03] this whole statement in the sermon life
[1:17:05] you all still here
[1:17:08] I'm glad we're having a baptism you're
[1:17:09] all sticking around
[1:17:10] for the baptism you're loved Chase
[1:17:14] they've all they're all staying for you
[1:17:17] in the sermon life brother bear says and
[1:17:19] and this there's a lot here but just
[1:17:21] kind of follow the theme what we call
[1:17:23] life now is only a shadow or a negative
[1:17:25] we all like to Rejoice but we can
[1:17:27] Rejoice over the right thing that shows
[1:17:29] that we've hooked up with the real thing
[1:17:31] when we Rejoice over the right thing
[1:17:34] though we Rejoice over the wrong thing
[1:17:36] then it shows we're hooked up with the
[1:17:37] wrong thing
[1:17:39] and that's maybe principle number one
[1:17:43] so our live can tell right now
[1:17:46] what we are which way our emotions are
[1:17:48] running you are who you are by your
[1:17:50] emotions
[1:17:51] we can tell right now what we are in
[1:17:53] life by how your emotions are running
[1:17:54] that's why when we are sad how are you
[1:17:57] doing we're saying I'm sad
[1:17:59] when we're frustrated we say we're
[1:18:00] frustrated it doesn't mean your name is
[1:18:02] frustrated it means you are frustrated
[1:18:04] and it's all because your emotions he
[1:18:06] says if we're rejoicing over the world
[1:18:07] and evil things our minds and our souls
[1:18:09] are inspired by below Boogie Woogie
[1:18:10] dances heartaches drinking all these
[1:18:12] other things that we run after it's from
[1:18:14] below but notice what we are is our
[1:18:17] emotions are running
[1:18:19] this is a generalization for one to
[1:18:20] examine themselves what do I tend to be
[1:18:23] in the aggregate
[1:18:24] am I doing all these other things that
[1:18:26] tells you what you are
[1:18:27] not the moments of clarity when you
[1:18:29] finally make it to church and you're
[1:18:30] feeling good about yourself but what are
[1:18:32] you he's saying it's your emotions now
[1:18:35] Nick slotty says but if we rejoice in
[1:18:37] the spirit that we have eternal life
[1:18:40] and we raise our emotions to God and
[1:18:42] praise him then we have joy then we have
[1:18:44] joy Jesus said that your Joys might be
[1:18:47] fooled but not full of the perverted
[1:18:49] life but full of the eternal life above
[1:18:51] and that's so that's a
[1:18:53] those first few slides to me present to
[1:18:56] you a thought on two kinds of life and
[1:18:59] then brings he starts taking our
[1:19:01] emotions and he's carving out the
[1:19:03] emotional part so in the next slide says
[1:19:05] so you can see it depends on what you
[1:19:08] look at
[1:19:09] now just for instance for the psychology
[1:19:12] part of it psychiatric
[1:19:14] are we all getting nervous now
[1:19:17] now let's notice just a moment this
[1:19:20] psychic View
[1:19:22] here's the picture of Christ and here's
[1:19:25] an electric fan
[1:19:27] now we're just going to have to imagine
[1:19:28] it right a picture of Christ and I guess
[1:19:31] I could have demonstrated this but a
[1:19:33] picture of Christ and an electric fan it
[1:19:36] depends on which one I look at
[1:19:38] are you catching the visual Christ
[1:19:40] something else
[1:19:42] and he's talking about your emotions but
[1:19:44] now you want to get into the psychiatric
[1:19:45] view of it he says if my emotion is
[1:19:47] moved this way or emotions is moved that
[1:19:50] way
[1:19:51] if I look at that and long for that and
[1:19:54] desire that my motion is set towards the
[1:19:56] fan but if I look this way my motion my
[1:19:59] desire is set that way
[1:20:02] so what you're looking at has some
[1:20:04] impact upon your perception and what
[1:20:06] you're seeing what you're indicted what
[1:20:07] you're considering what you're thinking
[1:20:08] about so your emotions are moved by what
[1:20:10] you're looking at
[1:20:12] that's the reason Jesus said whosoever
[1:20:14] look upon a woman to lust after half
[1:20:15] committed adultery with her already in
[1:20:16] his heart it's where your emotions are
[1:20:19] set where your thoughts are
[1:20:24] that's where where your emotions are set
[1:20:25] where your thoughts are that's what
[1:20:27] you're looking at as he says it's where
[1:20:30] your emotions are set where your
[1:20:31] thoughts are it's all based upon what
[1:20:33] you're looking at
[1:20:36] now the next slice is then we can
[1:20:38] Rejoice on because that we are the
[1:20:40] children of the promise on the great
[1:20:42] Eternal Church of God whose Christ's own
[1:20:43] promise I can't feel that's right the
[1:20:45] world thinks we're crazy oh this is life
[1:20:46] we'll be right in their way I am this
[1:20:50] day to see a lady now he's changed but
[1:20:52] this is to deal with the emotional part
[1:20:54] of The View
[1:20:55] I am this day to deal with the lady
[1:20:58] who went to a psychiatrist she's 35
[1:21:00] years old never smoked never drank in
[1:21:01] all her life very fine girl her people
[1:21:03] were Christians are Christians her
[1:21:05] father is a doctor and she gave her life
[1:21:07] to Christ in early stage and what did
[1:21:10] she do
[1:21:12] she goes out and finally gets to a place
[1:21:14] to a college where she was teaching and
[1:21:16] a psychiatrist there he sat down to talk
[1:21:19] to her and he said you mean to tell me
[1:21:20] you've never kissed a boy she said not
[1:21:22] one time in all my life and he said you
[1:21:24] mean you've never had a little drink and
[1:21:26] been in a party
[1:21:27] never
[1:21:29] he said girl you don't know what you're
[1:21:31] missing
[1:21:33] catch this now him being a psychiatrist
[1:21:36] he swung the girl's mind
[1:21:39] until now she's become so evil and so
[1:21:41] bad because she don't even want to hear
[1:21:43] the name of Jesus spoke in her presence
[1:21:45] what did that nasty psychiatrist do he
[1:21:48] was messing with her mind he swung her
[1:21:50] mind right
[1:21:51] and we say that's what the psychiatrist
[1:21:53] does that's what the world does is it
[1:21:54] manipulates your mind and swings your
[1:21:56] mind and that's how the world achieves
[1:21:58] its results he says and even her father
[1:22:00] mother can't even see her no more and
[1:22:01] she's lost her mind and this next week
[1:22:03] will go to an institution for shock
[1:22:05] treatment
[1:22:06] it's because that she turned her
[1:22:09] thoughts from Christ
[1:22:10] under what that psychiatrist was moving
[1:22:13] was a move in her mind now leave it
[1:22:15] there
[1:22:16] now take it all in the aggregate two
[1:22:18] kinds of Life emotion and the whoopee
[1:22:21] and the Boogie Woogie and all that and
[1:22:22] what your emotions are set on he says
[1:22:24] now let's take the psychiatric view of
[1:22:25] this we can have the emotions that are
[1:22:27] hooked into the right thing emotions
[1:22:28] hooked on the wrong thing he says what's
[1:22:30] determining that what you look at is
[1:22:32] what derives your emotions from and you
[1:22:34] start getting your emotions built up and
[1:22:35] he says you can have your emotions on
[1:22:37] the wrong thing you can have your
[1:22:38] emotions on the right thing I can look
[1:22:39] at a fan and my emotions can be
[1:22:40] projected towards that or my eyesight to
[1:22:42] that he says or I could look on this
[1:22:43] other side of things and begin to look
[1:22:45] at Christ and he's trying to draw this
[1:22:48] comparison and he says now I had a
[1:22:50] scenario where I'm going to see a young
[1:22:52] lady whose mind has been swung from the
[1:22:55] things of Christ to the things of the
[1:22:57] world and she's gotten so evil and he
[1:22:58] says it's all because she turned her
[1:23:01] thoughts from Christ
[1:23:03] to the things of the world and the
[1:23:05] psychiatrist swung her mind
[1:23:08] now pay attention to the next statement
[1:23:10] and that is what we are here for this
[1:23:13] morning is to move your mind and your
[1:23:15] thinking from the things of the world
[1:23:17] until the things of God which are
[1:23:19] eternal which is eternally
[1:23:22] did we read that right
[1:23:24] I'm here this morning to move your mind
[1:23:28] and to move your thinking listen when
[1:23:30] I'm preaching the word I can't do
[1:23:32] anything to your soul
[1:23:34] the the preaching of the word in this
[1:23:37] this Dynamic of preaching the word of
[1:23:39] God I'm not up here with this thought
[1:23:40] process that man if I can just get past
[1:23:43] their bullheadedness and their
[1:23:44] stubbornness and their tiredness and I
[1:23:45] even though they're sleeping if I could
[1:23:46] just say it the right way it'll get in
[1:23:48] there some way and and it's all going to
[1:23:50] make a difference somehow no listen the
[1:23:53] reason why I agonize Time After Time and
[1:23:56] pray and study and strive to be sure
[1:23:59] that I'm finding the mind of God is
[1:24:00] because it's so important that I don't
[1:24:02] get in the way and it's so important
[1:24:04] that the word is preached and it's
[1:24:06] Clarity and it's faithful to the message
[1:24:07] of the hour and it engages you as a
[1:24:10] person to hear the word of God to change
[1:24:13] your thinking and to swing your mind
[1:24:15] from all the things that this world has
[1:24:18] because listen I realize the world has
[1:24:21] got your attention
[1:24:23] I'm not saying it's your attraction I
[1:24:24] know it's your distraction the world has
[1:24:26] got your attention and there's so much
[1:24:28] Tick Tock in so much movies and programs
[1:24:30] and sensationalisms and there's so many
[1:24:32] ways that we're sensitized it's it's
[1:24:34] impossible in a carnal way for church to
[1:24:38] compete with what the world can give you
[1:24:40] but if I can get myself out of the way
[1:24:42] and God by his grace can get you within
[1:24:45] the sound of my voice if I can yield
[1:24:48] maybe I could say something that gets
[1:24:51] your attention
[1:24:52] like whoa wait a minute where did that
[1:24:55] come from
[1:24:56] I preached a youth camp recently and
[1:24:58] there's a dozen guys or so who rented an
[1:25:00] Airbnb they showed up at the youth camp
[1:25:01] and after I think it was the first or
[1:25:03] second service they went home they said
[1:25:04] guys brother Aaron's on to us
[1:25:07] he he knows what's going on he knows
[1:25:09] what's up he's in our Snapchats
[1:25:11] whatever's going on this just got
[1:25:13] serious I said well how did that happen
[1:25:15] well guess what I'm not 21 years old
[1:25:16] just to correct the any air there
[1:25:19] and and I'm not in my mind I I don't
[1:25:22] experience certain things but there's a
[1:25:24] discernment that comes when you get
[1:25:25] serious before God and there's a way
[1:25:27] that the word can go forth where there's
[1:25:28] times you say things you don't even know
[1:25:30] what you're talking about like well I
[1:25:31] just read that for this I didn't realize
[1:25:32] that part was in it why because God
[1:25:34] didn't get your attention and we might
[1:25:37] think well it's just if you're a luck
[1:25:38] seed it's going to get in there somehow
[1:25:39] yeah absolutely but how is it going to
[1:25:42] happen you may have an ordained Lexi
[1:25:44] down in your soul and I can't be so
[1:25:46] stubborn and legalistic and bullheaded
[1:25:48] and think I could just as long as I'm
[1:25:49] just yelling something that brother Adam
[1:25:51] said it's gonna happen no you've got to
[1:25:53] swing their mind you've got to change
[1:25:55] their thinking they're looking at this
[1:25:57] they're looking at this oh God let the
[1:25:59] word today if it doesn't happen today
[1:26:01] may you at least be aware that what God
[1:26:03] is wanting to do is correct your vision
[1:26:06] [Applause]
[1:26:07] swing your mind
[1:26:09] to the things of God
[1:26:12] that's what we're here for this morning
[1:26:13] to move your thinking to move your mind
[1:26:15] next slide
[1:26:17] that's what preaching is for
[1:26:20] he says pervert but maybe we can say
[1:26:22] it's to revert to pervert to pervert the
[1:26:25] thinking to a higher and better into a
[1:26:27] place where Christ is until you become
[1:26:30] converted
[1:26:31] then your mind reaches for those things
[1:26:33] which are above
[1:26:34] how could we ever be in the place we're
[1:26:36] just going to beat people up who are in
[1:26:38] the wrong state of mind you're not
[1:26:39] reaching for the right things you're not
[1:26:40] reaching for the right things you're
[1:26:41] wrong you're wrong you're wrong
[1:26:43] without telling them what's right
[1:26:47] and tell me what the word's been trying
[1:26:49] to do is swing your mind to the things
[1:26:50] of God so you can get to the place to
[1:26:52] where you're converted
[1:26:54] and then you can reach for the things
[1:26:55] which are above
[1:26:57] there's a way if I can say it doesn't
[1:26:58] matter how you're raised what religion
[1:27:00] what denomination what organization
[1:27:01] especially if you've been raising the
[1:27:02] message there's a lot of memory you have
[1:27:04] here
[1:27:05] of the way you think things should be
[1:27:06] done and if we're not careful what we do
[1:27:08] is we just grab a hold of what's being
[1:27:10] preached in that Realm
[1:27:12] and we stay in that frame of mind
[1:27:14] instead of opening up
[1:27:16] to be converted
[1:27:20] let me say this as I close
[1:27:23] if we could just at least do this on
[1:27:25] this subject of vision correction just
[1:27:27] establish in your heart right now
[1:27:30] that the word first and primarily first
[1:27:32] and foremost
[1:27:34] wants to heal your take your heart
[1:27:37] and get it right
[1:27:40] it doesn't say that if you heard the
[1:27:42] word just be baptized in the name of
[1:27:44] Jesus Christ and call yourself saved it
[1:27:47] has to be a change of heart a change of
[1:27:49] mind
[1:27:52] if I could say it this way if our soul
[1:27:54] is right then primarily we just want our
[1:27:57] Spirits right
[1:27:59] that you I know you may take exception
[1:28:01] of this and I'm not discounting physical
[1:28:03] pain I'm not discounting sickness I'm
[1:28:05] not discounting cancers whether it be
[1:28:07] actual eye problems or heart problems or
[1:28:09] back problems or digestive problems I'm
[1:28:12] not discounting it at all but right now
[1:28:14] if I could be a spiritual chiropractor
[1:28:16] for a second
[1:28:17] if I could be what's the head and what
[1:28:19] are the Sinners where they focus
[1:28:20] everything back here they can just get
[1:28:22] that part of line they say everything
[1:28:23] else will fix itself whatever Meridian
[1:28:25] you're on today however you want to look
[1:28:27] at this listen to me this will help you
[1:28:28] right here if your soul is Right
[1:28:30] primarily what you want is your heart to
[1:28:32] be right
[1:28:34] okay if your soul is right what matters
[1:28:37] the most is that your heart is right
[1:28:38] because the new body will come
[1:28:41] it's coming
[1:28:42] don't have to worry about that if your
[1:28:45] soul is right what you want is your
[1:28:46] character to be right your heart to be
[1:28:48] right your spirit to be right you want
[1:28:49] your attitude to be right you want to be
[1:28:51] positive you want to be critical you
[1:28:52] want to be crabby you want to be
[1:28:53] expected you want to be kind you want to
[1:28:55] be a servant you want to be humble if
[1:28:56] your heart soul is right you want your
[1:28:58] heart to be right because listen the new
[1:29:00] body's coming the healing's coming the
[1:29:02] pain will go away the back will
[1:29:04] straighten up the pounds will be shed
[1:29:06] the hair will come back whatever it is
[1:29:08] one day the body will be right but why
[1:29:10] I'm here I want my attitude to be right
[1:29:13] I want my heart to be right
[1:29:17] I guarantee you after Vision Correction
[1:29:20] the healing will come
[1:29:22] if we could focus on the part that
[1:29:24] matters
[1:29:25] and get your right attitude the healing
[1:29:27] will come
[1:29:29] praise the Lord
[1:29:31] amen musicians please come we'll
[1:29:33] transition out to our baptismal service
[1:29:36] I know that may kind of leave you
[1:29:38] hanging a little bit I know we often
[1:29:39] worship
[1:29:40] but I think we just came right to a head
[1:29:42] today
[1:29:43] right to a spot we could just take God
[1:29:45] at his word and believe him that all
[1:29:47] things are possible
