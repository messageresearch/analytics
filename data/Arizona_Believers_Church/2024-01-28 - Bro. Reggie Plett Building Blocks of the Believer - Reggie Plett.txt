TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I thought about this and as brother Aaron has been preaching again on on the house of the Lord and obviously I always look introspectively and and into my own life and and and say God where does that fit me um in my own personal walk with you and then I begin to work out how does that fit in my home with my wife and my children and in in in our little sanctuary of our home and then again I continue to go outward how does that affect me in my life as I um conduct myself in the world in in the workplace and in public but I thought about our church here and I thought really in this scope of things I know we've um I don't know exactly the time frame brother Aaron um has that I know it's I think maybe coming up on three or four years but I think we've been here two years I would say we're still a young church it's still a new church church and um as my heart has um just been thinking about listening to to different tapes and and uh I've been reading a book uh 50 years in the Church of Rome by uh Reverend chiniki and um brother brandom refers to brother chiniki and and his books and and just the deception that he faced in the Catholic Church um as a Young Man growing up reading his Bible and how that that was uh so frowned upon when he became a priest was why are you reading your Bible and everything he did he pointed back to the Bible and he just began to see this this disdain for for the the reading of the word and so forth and but it was the one thing that he would always refer to and he would see it he he would always look to the word of God but just that uh that deception that was all around uh and I just as I think about our church I think about this young church and as it's growing and I think oh God don't let those things creep in don't let those things begin to creep in and Lord if if it would come through me oh God keep me from it help hold me under the blood don't let me be a part of of bringing anything in that would be displeasing and would would cause a church to begin to go a drift and and go in a direction it shouldn't go whether it would be uh Traditions or or something baggage I would bring from my past um I know many of us have come uh probably the majority of us have been in other churches and we've we've come from other churches and now we're gathered together in this one place that we call a church and and it's just like well here we are so let's make this work but as we begin to pump the brakes a little bit and say you know we that's not why we go to church wait this is not why we go to church it's a daily walk this is a daily thing this isn't just a we want to get together every Sunday and we'll just do that for the next however many years we'll just do that we it it it it's a collective group of individuals and we each are bringing something into this place and as I think about that house of the Lord and and and and and making of that house of the Lord and and again this morning I'm talking about the the building blocks of the believer I don't know if do we have that image brother John of that that Lego man uh at the beginning I I I I figured the young men would really like that the young guys who love to build Legos think I could build that uh that's how I imagine uh the believer that's how I imagine us as as as as an individual that's made up of just lots and lots and lots of individual blocks and and and every day and every moment of our life we're adding a block and adding a block and adding a block and at first maybe you think I don't see the picture I don't understand what we're building here but as we go along this is this is what we're forming we're forming who we are and and and as Believers uh I think we would all say God let that image end up looking like Jesus Christ like Christ that's our desire and so I I I I've got to hurry along here and so buckle up and I'm hoping that we can do this quickly and we can get through this but as we're talking about the the the building blocks of the believer uh as we start with these if we can imagine as these Lego blocks and I'm hoping that I can just keep these young men alert and and and awake and and and and engaged in the service this morning get the if we can get the young people engaged then then the older ones you can you can drift off and and rest your weary bones but there's certain blocks that we like uh you open up your Lego set and you empty out the bag of the Legos and you start separating your Lego pieces there's certain ones that you you you you you go to the instructions and you're going to start with the the real long 2x6 block that's where you're going to start your base and and you're going to there's certain ones that you you you gravitate towards you say oh I like that block that's the one block you know I'm real good with these blocks and there's lots of little minute blocks that you're going to add to those bigger blocks but there's certain blocks that that you can get a hold of and and and even the youngest ones that start building on their Legos they they grab those real long ones those real long flat ones that look work as good paddles for know we've never done that but uh there's ones that you like to grab and and and you gravitate towards and the first block that that we would say that as a Believer the first block we want to build upon is that block of Jesus Christ is that Cornerstone Block it's it's Jesus Christ or we refer to Jesus Christ as the word because in St John 1:1 we find that in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and that word was made flesh and that flesh was Jesus Christ and so that's the first block we were we're going to grab as Believers that's the block we want to start with and we like that block that's Jesus Christ that's the for the firm Cornerstone that we're going to build upon is Jesus Christ the word the Holy Ghost and then we're going to talk about that and and we're going to build on that one and everything everything we build on top of that we're always going to point back to that that no matter what we talk about in church what no matter what we talk about in our homes around a cup of coffee it's all going to be based upon the word that we as Believers are going to agree that the one thing that we're always going to point back to is the word not well my church said well my preacher said well this I heard you know I I I read this in a good uh uh uh devotional no no no no if it's doesn't line up with the word it's you you can bring it to the table but we're we really want it it the only thing that's going to be solid is the word is Jesus Christ we like that block everybody agrees we like that block the next block maybe we want to add to that is the block of prayer the scriptures tells us to pray without ceasing that that that that that no matter what we want we want to be praying and everything we do no matter what we do no matter what direction no matter uh what other block we want to add to our lives as Believers as husbands as Fathers as wives as housemakers as young uh young people excited about the Lord we want to be prayerful about it we want to we before we make a move we we want to ask God is this the next block I ought to be adding amen and so prayer is a is a block that is a key Block it's a block that we want we want to keep that one close how about the block of love we say oh that one yeah I wanted that one that's the one I wanted before prayer that's fine they're interchangeable those two blocks you can you can you you can put the love block before you put the prayer block if you'd like but love is a block that we say yes yes I I I I want the word but I want to bring the word in love I I don't want as as brother brandom uh has has well I I suppose as as I had preached here the last time I preached here about I think uh mechanics and Dynamics uh we we we we love the mechanics we we we will we want to be all about that but if we're not bringing the mechanics with the Dynamics and love being that main Dynamo that's driving us we don't that we don't want to be that we don't want that in our home we we don't want our children molded around because I said so that's why we want it we want it to be out of love we want God I I I it's because I want to I it's I abstain from certain things because I wouldn't want to hurt him that's that love of God that's that's the block we want to add we like that block I put in the block of committal and committ is a big one and and it doesn't get talked about a lot but the block of committal is being able to give it to God and leave it there to let go that's a big block that's a block that that we want to put in and then we want to take it off and then we want to put it on but then we want to take it off and we always want to take get we always want that block there but then we we we once in a while we want to go ahead and take it off the the pile but it's such an important lesson in life amen when you can learn to give your need to the Lord yes and leave it there we sing it all the time leave it there leave it there take your burdens to the Lord but then go pick it back up and then we wrestle and we wrestle and we wrestle and with time we learn I should have just left it he carries it so much better than I carry it we always want the the block of faith you know when we think about uh the stature of a perfect man at the base is Faith that's where we start we can't please him without it uh Faith the just live by faith there's just everything's built upon faith when we look at Abraham who is our father of faith and we see that it was it was by faith that that that Abraham acted and that's what pleased God and it was Faith uh that Abraham had that righteousness was accounted to Abraham by faith faith is a big block faith is a block that that that that even if you didn't have the word faith on your lips your actions as a Believer show that that's what you're walking by is the block of faith that well how are you going to do this how do you know this week is going to be it's by faith do you know how do you know can you prove it to me if I set up here I'm going to now I'm going to prove this to you could I really if I could prove it to you probably somebody could disprove it somebody much smarter than me but it's by faith that we as Believers are walking you say I can't prove it I don't know the scriptures I didn't go to the theological school to learn the arguments and but it's by faith that we as Believers walk right we like that block the block of forgiveness this is a block we want to add brother brandham was preaching about uh speak to the mountain and in the scripture Jesus is speaking about faith and if you had the faith of grain of mustard seed you could move a mountain but in that same context when Jesus is teaching about that kind of Faith he says when you stand praying forgive and if you can't forgive neither will your father in Heaven forgive you and brother brandom says faith is based on forgiveness well you know you need context with that that you need context with that but the idea is if there's something that's in your heart if there's something in your life and it's it's that hangnail and you just you just you don't even really so you forget about it most of the time but something will come along and it'll rub it and your nerves immediately you know it's there and it's something that that's you're harboring you don't even know you're har you know when when when it comes up you know it that nerve you hit that nerve and you know it but then with time and distance you forget about it but once in a while you catch it on something somebody will bring it up again and you the you can feel the heat rise in your face and you realize there so something that I thought I had forgiven it's still there it's still there and and then when when God that when the Divine healer when the Great physician deals with that and you're allowed you're allowed you are allowed but you're able to forgive yes the release that it has is so wonderful it's it's that hangnail being gone it's taking that hangnail off and and and you don't it doesn't catch anymore it's done and and and you can bring it up the subject can be brought up and you can talk about and you realize I didn't even realize it but it doesn't bother me anymore because it's gone I've forgiven amen as Believers that is a block that Believers have that the world is just they just bury it whether it would be with a substance abuse or or or or or finding you know like a py Psychopaths they have to continue to to to rotate and and move because they get discovered quickly their their pattern but that's what they'll do is they just want to move along and I well I'll just have to make new friends and they can never forgiveness is is a block that is something that Believers it it the world must Marvel at it well and and I would say because sometimes as Believers I Marvel at other believers who have told me their story and they tell me about the forgiveness and I think my just the grace of God that's just God that could do that we like these blocks now brother brandom in the church age book speaking about the temple and building this up because that's what we're talking about is the building blocks of a Believer and the idea is uh is joined with this idea of the house of the Lord and us being that house of the Lord us being that Temple for God and and so as bu the building blocks we don't want to just collect blocks we're wanting something to build we we're wanting to shape something up we're wanting God to make something out of us not just be a pile of blocks uh we want to we want to be again formed in the image of God we want to be his handiwork framed together to make up the body of Christ that's what we're Des that's the desire for each of these building blocks that we can add these blocks to be the image of God for the day and age we live in so brother brandom in the church age book in the Philadelphia Church age he says now he's not only giving crowns but he says that these and the bride will be made pillars in the temple of God but what is the temple of God Jesus spoke of his body as being the temple it was it was the temple of God but now that we are his body the True Church the true church is the temple of God by the Holy Ghost within us so you are that Temple and we would all say Amen to that now he's going to make the Overcomer a pillar in that Temple but what is a pillar a pillar is actually a part of the foundation for it holds up the super structure praise God that puts the Overcomer right in with the apostles and Prophets for it says in Ephesians 2 19 through verse 22 which we just read and uh you're you're no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens of the Saints household of God you're built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ being the Chief Cornerstone yes that verse 22 says that we are build it together with them so when we think of Moses when we think of of of Elijah when we think of Paul and Peter and James you're in with them you're that kind of a Believer no don't SE separate them and say boy that Peter that Paul wow amazing that's you that's you when when when all of the the time is over and people begin talking about Believers don't be surprised if your name comes up I mean we do it I just want you to know that that we in our house uh we do talk about you I mean I'm glad that you all don't do that but we do that in our house we talk about you and we talk about how awesome it is that we get to fellowship with the people we get to fellowship with because we get to hear the stories when we as a new church come together and it's formed up of of of people who have come from all different walks of life different churches and why are you at this church you know there's another church you could go to that church and I was at that church but I left that church and why did you leave that church well because of this circumstance well let me tell you about what I came from and we begin talking about those things and you say wow these people are amazing what pillars in the temple of God now when God puts a man in the temple as a pillar and makes him a part of that Foundation group what is he doing he's giving him the revelation of the word and of himself let me let me back up so I can read that again now when God puts a man in the temple as a pillar so when man or woman okay the when God puts a man or a woman in the temple as a pillar what is he doing but he's giving him the revelation of the word and of himself that's what he's doing as a Believer he's revealing who he is to you that you as Believers walking with these other blocks as God is building you upon W with the with with the blocks of faith and of Love is you're saying by faith and with love I want to know him I want to know who he is how he is what he is and God begins revealing who he is to you that Revelation is solid that's what forms a temple a pillar because that is exactly what the apostles and Prophets had Matthew 1617 there he is that word there he stands no one can get him out Matthew 16:17 is Jesus saying to Peter and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon barjona for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed unto thee but my Father which is in heaven Revelation upon this I'll build my church Revelation that's one of the blocks we want that's one of the blocks you've got it's a good block you see I like that block and all these blocks all these blocks we think I like these blocks I like those ones I those those are the ones that I want I want more of those blocks but God's not building a square box you've got curves to you you have you have very intricate parts to you you're very unique some of us have got higher uh foreheads than some other of you some of us you know have darker skin than others you're very unique God's not building this and so you say I like those block but just give me more of those blocks but as a Believer really our desire is God it's it's your you're the handy man we're your handiwork and it's your It's Your Design we're not telling God well I want you to make me this it's what I don't know what you're making God but whatever it is I'm sure it will be great and he's like are you sure and you're like I'm yeah well what is it and he says well I'll show you'll see at the end what it is you you haven't seen the completed picture yet uh I got some I got some unique blocks though that you may not see them from the outside they're parts of those Legos that go on the inside and you think why did they have that Lego there at all you can't you can't I can't even see it from anywhere in this final thing but why is that block in there and he said there's a purpose for it we said well what what what like what and he brings out the block of sorrow in Isaiah 533 he is despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not we go oh yeah that's right this we came to church not to hear just about the blocks of love and goodness and happiness and comfortability here in this church but tomorrow and this week and maybe even right now there's somebody in here who their heart is bleeding right that maybe this is a reprieve to be here this morning because when this service is over they're about to go out to something that they wish they didn't have to these are the blocks that now we're going to talk about that gets real heavy but these are the building blocks of the believer and this block of Sorrow is obviously a necessary block because when God was prophesying of what he would would be yes when he came in flesh so that we would have an actual image of God in flesh he was a Man of Sorrows and I there I know I look out I can see the grayer hairs and the lack of hairs to know that some of you know exactly that block you know that block amen you're acquainted with that block there's a block of suffering and in 1 Peter 510 it says but the God of all Grace who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus after that ye have suffered a while make you perfect establish strengthen and and settle you we love the perfecting we love the establishing we love the strengthening we love the settling but the suffering that comes before that we don't like that but that is a necessary Block in the building of a Believer and I it's not that God's like oh here we go you know this is just good for you I hope you're ready no no he didn't design that he didn't design that he allowed that to bring about his attributes he didn't design that but he knew that what if he would allow that through the fall through through this this this great plan of his it would make a better believer that he would put within you the ability to overcome the suffering to to to endure the suffering and even more than enduring the suffering to conduct yourself with joy amidst the suffering that God has seen fit to allow in your life for you to be able to conduct yourself with joy now that's not happiness and skipping and dancing it's joy in the lord it's it's the when you're curled up in a fetal position terrified in your bed at home because of of the anxiety and everything around you there's still something in your heart that says I you know what I love the word you know what's so comforting to me is to hear the revelation of God in this day it's like but look at you're a you're falling apart you're on the outside you're a mess and it's like I know but I still got this joy down inside of me okay we're going to hurry along patience okay now I may skip over some of this but and I think I will brother John I think I'm going to skip over it but brother Brandon in the church H book he does such such a beautiful job of laying out God perfecting us through patience that it's through patience waiting for and waiting on God Amen in patience possess ye your souls it's that patience being able to be patient first with God first with God in the book Christ the Healer brother FF Bosworth you know brother FF Bosworth was brother brandom's daddy in the gospel he's the one that when at the Sam Houston Coliseum when when Dr best wanted to call brother brandom out and debate him brother brandom said I'm not debating brother Bosworth was like let me okay the reason Dr Bosworth was like let me was cuz he just wrote the book Christ the Healer he had just written a book where he had over 600 scriptures on Jehovah Gyra being Jehovah Rafa being Jehovah sh he had just gone through all of that to see that Jesus Christ was the Fulfillment of all of that and if you were going to De debate Divine Healing then you had to debate Divine saving and so he was just ready for it brother br brother BR said now listen I don't want an argument whatever but brother brother Bosworth in in his book Christ the Healer he said it's playing playing uh chess with God and God moves he he gives his word God says uh by my stripes you're healed that's his move he said now it's your move and your move is either I believe it or I don't know if I believe that that's your move and and that could go sideways that you know that could go a lot of ways depending on on how you move on that but then after you move let's say you say I believe that now it's God's move right but you don't get to tell God when to move oh that's the part that we just go oh I forgot this isn't Checkers this is chess you know and and so you know you you I I I sent my word I healed to heal them and you say I believe that go ahead he yeah yeah and you go [Music] patience but then when God moves boy he moves huh what a beautiful move the block of sacrifice in in Romans 12 and: 1 it says I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice wholly acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and you know there were so there's so many beautiful illustrations that brother brandham gives in through story form of course being uh biblical you know is scriptural but he dramatizes so much you know and and we love that I love that I just want know I love that I guess I'm dramatic and so uh one of those stories is blind bmus and uh brother brandom speaking about blind B marus in the message the faith that was once delivered to the Saints says then one day his wife took sick he walked out he was a Believer he believed God would heal he believed God was real he said Lord God my poor wife the doctor can do no more for her if you'll spare her life tomorrow I'll take these turtle doves and offer them to you for a sacrifice it's a hard thing we want to make the sacrifice out of well something easy see that's not a sacrifice it's something that hurts and cuts is what's a sacrifice you say well I got it you know well just so happened that I have it that's not how a sacrifice works the ministry explained brother bam says and the queen said I'll go see for myself the Queen of Sheba now I want you to notice what a sacrifice when you come to see God you don't just come on a flower bed of ease you have to make a sacrifice it's a sacrificial way it's a way of death you have to die out to come to him you have to forget all you ever know in order to learn of him empty out that he can fill us you don't mix it now you have to empty out oh you'll appreciate it later questions and answers say well I'll go I'd go to church and I'd praise the Lord if I felt like it well now a priest is to make a sacrifice and you the congregation are high Priests of God to make a spiritual sacrifice that's the fruits of your lips giving praise to God you go down and say well if I felt like it I'd go over and testify to somebody well do it anyhow if you're a high priest brother it's burning in your heart whether you feel like doing it or not do it anyhow because you've got to make a sacrifice something that's hard to do go do it anyhow you're a spiritual priesthood a royal people giving praise to God because God lives in this heart we know this as adults we know this that you know sometimes you you you've got to go and do something you say but man I really don't want to go and do I don't feel like but it's got to get done and we teach our kids that listen it's got to get done but I don't feel like doing it right now you you got to be able to override feelings in that case that's those senses right that's that if if the senses don't agree with the word we deny the senses a that's harder than it's it's you know like you can say it so easy it comes off the lips but the discipline to do that or the yielding to the spirit of God to do that however you want to phrase that it's one of the building blocks for a Believer yeah we agree there's other blocks there's the block of reproach there's the block of Holiness and I don't just mean dressing in a Holiness way I mean living in the way of Holiness it comes out it's it comes out in the appearance sure but it's a way of life easy oh no no not easy but worth it you know his yoke really is light if we'll just get our yoke off it's just we're trying to put his yoke on and this other Yoke the block of loneliness oh it's lonely sometimes you feel like Elijah Lord I'm the only one I think I'm the only one Lord and he has to pull you out and say I want you to know there's 7,000 they have not bowed the knee to bail but talk about loneliness does the believer know about loneliness oh too often I put the block of the Cross because Jesus said that we must pick up our cross and follow him and that idea of the Cross is dying out it's bringing everything it's the it's the X on the map to the treasure but it requires Ires vulnerability opening yourself up becoming vulnerable and dying out now the other day I was we were in our house and okay just looking at the time and my son Luke the 4 yold was uh was on the couch and he was pulling the blanket was sitting with one of his siblings and he's pulling the blanket over his head and going oh the ghost is I don't want the ghost is to get me oh the ghost is no no no what ghost is and and The Sibling one of his siblings said stop no there's no such thing as ghosts and I said now wait wait wait wait wait we don't want to teach our kids that I mean every time we go to church we're talking about the Holy Ghost in Fire and you know I mean it's all about the Holy Ghost so we believe in ghost why why would we tell them there's no such thing as ghosts well there's no such thing as bad ghost is well how do we want to go into that discussion exactly but when we talk about these building blocks of the believer we want to talk about the blocks of faith and love and joy we want to talk about those blocks but the blocks of the believer are not always those lovely joyous blocks and we do our children I think a disservice I got to be careful but I don't mean that we just like oh let me show you what my burden is child you know so you can learn to carry this weight of adulthood just crush your child in one sitting but as Believers when we're sitting in devotion Even in our homes and when we're listening to those tapes and we're you hear if you're just fast forwarding all the way to the prayer lines in the end you're going to hear about Terrible Things Cancers and sicknesses and blindnesses and crippling things that you think what suffering and if we go well I you don't need to know about the suffering no you need to know about the suffering so that you can hear about the Deliverance of the suffering that's why we love that that kept the prayer line part not just the services we love to hear the prayer lines because you get to hear how the while the preaching of the word was going on men and women were who maybe had never picked a Bible up in their lifetime who maybe were just wheeled in from the hospital by a loved one but they're still they don't they're not believers they don't go to the brandom Tabernacle in 1954 these are people that are coming straight from the hospital room from CS and stretchers and people are bringing them in and they you don't know what their life is like they could be alcoholics they could be uh uh uh chain smokers and and and their lives may be absolutely upside down but they are are are coming into this place because somebody has heard that Jesus Christ is the same today that he was when he walked the shores of Galilee and they say is that true well let's go and see right that's the come and see and so they're showing up at the services and brother brandom is saying now we're going to go to the Bible and if the Bible is true then and the Bible if the Bible was true then and the Bible is true now and if God was a Healer then then God must be a Healer now and the people are saying is that true well keep listening and he begins to talk about the word of God and people are hearing it and they're doing like you're doing they're nodding their heads going that he's that's just right off the pages that's that's that's true and he says now if God is true and if this is true then let God back up this and then people begin and and he begins with the gift in his life begins Discerning what is wrong with them he begins Discerning what their doctor looks like he begins Discerning how many surgeries they've had he begins Discerning they're not even there for them but for their neighbor or for their daughter or for somebody that isn't even here but he begins Discerning this through a gift and the people say that is true do you know anything about the Bible not just what I just heard only until now is the only time I've ever heard that do you think it's true yeah well then what can God do with that and we hear it on tape and we go amazing men and women can be delivered from demons plaguing their lives well those are ghosts those are bad ghosts well the bad ghosts don't really exist oh they exist they exist and as Believers if we're hoping to skirt through life without having to ever come up against one where is you're getting your pattern from because in every story I read through here that's the story that comes up is what the believer who maybe was not a Believer at first was up against before he was delivered so we say well then what is what what are the kind of things that we just think that's not real that's not true la la la la la la la that's not real well one of those things are dragons oh what no we're not listening to you talk about Harry Potter this morning I'm not talking about that in Revelations 12: 7-9 it says and there was war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the dragon there's no and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found anymore in heaven and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the Earth and his angels were cast out with him I love that John just keeps adding the name so you can't mistake him if he tries to hide his identity that Dragon old serpent devil Satan filthy Mongrel it's like yeah you got him that's the guy that's the one I've been yeah having to deal with yeah well he was cast out of heaven and now you got to deal with him oh yeah yeah yeah he no longer just hanging around out in the out in The Ether there he was cast to Earth and now it's your problem so I want to read a children's story for you for you adults to keep this for your children and and we're going to read this children's story children so I hope the children are awake and here we go the name of this story is there's no no such thing as a dragon and it reads like this Billy Bixby was rather surprised when he woke up one morning and found a dragon in his room it was a small Dragon about the size of a kitten the dragon whacked its tail happily when Billy patted its head Billy went downstairs to tell his mother there's no such thing as a dragon said Billy's mother she said it as if she meant it Billy went back to his room and began to dress the dragon came close to Billy and wagged its tail but Billy didn't Pat it if there's no such thing as something it's silly to Pat it on the head Billy washed his face and hands and went to breakfast the dragon went too it was bigger now almost the size of a dog Billy sat at the table the dragon sat down on the table this sort of thing was not usually permitted but there wasn't much Billy's mother could do about it she'd already said there was no such thing as a dragon and if there's no such thing you can't tell it to get off the table mother made some pancakes for Billy but the dragon ate them all up mother made some more but the dragon ate those two mother kept making pancakes until she ran out of B Billy only got one of them but he said that's all he really wanted anyway Billy went upstairs to brush his teeth mother started clearing the table the dragon who was quite as big as Mother by this time made himself comfortable on the hall rug and went to sleep by the time Billy came back downstairs the dragon had grown so much he filled the hall Billy had to go around by way of the living room to get where his mother was I didn't know dragons grew so fast said Billy there's no such thing as a dragon said M said mother firmly cleaning the downstairs took mother all morning what with the dragon in the way and having to climb in and out of Windows to get from room to room by midday the dragon filled the house its head hung out of the front door its tail hung out of the back door and there wasn't room in the house that there wasn't a room in the house that didn't have some part of the Dragon in it when the dragon awoke from his nap he was hungry a bakery van went by the smell of fresh bread was more than the dragon could resist the dragon ran down the street after the Bakery Van the house went too of course like the shell on a snail the postman was just coming up the path with some post for the bixes when their house rushed past him and headed down the street he traced the bixby's house for a few blocks but he couldn't catch it when Mr Bixby came home for lunch the first thing he noticed was that the house was gone luckily one of the neighbors was able to tell him which way it went Mr Bixby got in his car and went looking for his house he studied all the houses as he drove along finally he saw one that looked familiar Billy and Mrs Bixby were waving from an upstairs window Mr Bixby climbed over the dragon's head onto the porch roof and through the upstairs window how did this happen Mr Bixby asked it was the dragon said Billy there's no such thing mother started to say there is a dragon Billy insisted a very big dragon and Billy patted the dragon on the head the Dragon wagged its tail happily then even faster than it had grown the dragon started getting smaller soon it was kitten size again I don't mind dragons this size said mother why did it have to grow so big I'm not sure said Billy but I think it just wanted to be noticed so we like that story huh that's fun the the drawings are so nice and but all of you have already started thinking some of you have already realize what the conclusion of this is if you want to pretend there's no such thing as a dragon as a Believer we'll pray for you but some of you know that dragons are real some of you know that a dragon can come in your house and start very small seems almost innocent like nothing just something new maybe maybe something novel we'll try it out huh we'll see how it goes if we don't like it it can go but sometimes it just goes in your hall and falls asleep and you find yourself without even realizing that you're having to go around it every day you're just going around it you don't it's like it's like it's not a problem you have plenty of Hall space you could go around it but other people notice it's in your house like what's with the dragon you're like what we don't know what dragon you we don't even we don't talk about dragons here we don't even talk about that in our house so silly good well what about the ghosts we don't even believe in ghosts well I hope you do I hope there's one that you fill this house with you know but this dragon that starts so small begins to grow in your homes begins to grow in our homes and then we have it gets to the place to where it will fill every room in your house that there won't be a room where there isn't a piece of dragon hanging around in that room and husband usbands and wives find themselves like on edge your eyes are big and a little bit Twitchy and it's like well what's the problem well I don't know what it is I don't even know what it is but maybe you can figure it out and and and here we are being affected and the next thing you know it's eating at you it's it's brother Brandon tells so many stories about the husband who got in a fight with his wife and he leaves the house without kissing her goodbye like he did every day and he and she and he walked away out the house and he just open and then he was later on was like so he goes back opens the door where she at she's still right behind the door crying never says a word to her brother brandom said he never say said a word to her he just picked her up hold her by the arms gave her a kiss and then left there was feeling in it that time he didn't have to say a word and sometimes it's not the words we even have to say you can feel it in your house you husbands and you wives you fathers you mothers you children no you know if you feels tense it feels tense in here what is going on in here there's a dragon and we got to deal with this Dragon do you want to deal with this Dragon I don't know he's getting bigger yeah well okay you want to push it off okay the next thing you know he'll eat your breakfast he'll eat eat your lunch he'll eat your dinner and you'll find yourself eating your breakfast lunch and dinner on the way out the door because you don't want to sit around where there's a dragon you're like I don't even want to be around here I can just feel it it's so tense in here I'm I'm not she needs to deal with this thing I was like well okay well that you know thanks team you know like where's the team on this it's like what happened to prayer what happened to family prayer well I don't I got deadlines okay well that one's just going to grow you know hey we used to do the well things are different now well what's different now okay and then one day Dad Mom one day you go to work and you come back from work and where's your home you say well the house I you know my house isn't like this story my house is not picking up I didn't say your house I said where's your home your home is gone it's picked up and it's moved out and that's when you want to gather the pieces no no no no no no no no no no kids come come come come and they go adios I'm finding me a good church to go to I'm find I'm going to go start hanging out with people whose atmosphere is good to be around I'm going to go find people that love to talk about the things of the you remember the things you used to love Dad you remember the things you used to love as a couple yeah I'm going to go find those kind of things because they left here that home's gone I mean in this story even the mailman knew that's pretty bad when the mailman is driving by your house and he's throwing the mail in your like I got to get out of here right I mean that's a dragon in the house now obviously the end of this story is Billy's patting the dragon's head and we're not looking to Pat no dragons on the head but this idea of we don't we just there is no dragon that is not that is not part of our makeup that is not part of our story if you want to go read the end of the book it is not that you just avoided the dragon it's that you you're an overcomer of that that that this thing with the building blocks of the believer is that God is putting something in you to withstand that that it's not patting it on the head but it's dealing with that Dragon right away it's stomping that dragon out it's the story where brother brandom had that dream and or or that man had that dream and told brother brandom that I had this dream and there was the devil and he was so big and I couldn't I felt like I couldn't deal with him and he every time he came he would he would go boo and I would I would shrink and he got bigger and the devil got bigger and I got smaller and every time he would scare me like that I got smaller and he got bigger until my faith something within me started saying boo back then he got smaller and I got bigger it's the same thing and brother tells a story about that dream that of uh of where he thought it was his father and his mother and and there was a man that was beating her with a club over the head and he said he was so big he was so strong I could not go up against that man he said but then my faith muscles rose up with inside of me and I said you hit her one more time you'll have to deal with me now brother explains to us that that was that ecclesiastical teaching that trinitarian teaching trying to beat that trinitarian teaching into the churches but how many other things try to get beaten into you I'm telling you that dragon is real and he's got these fingers and he just wants to creep in and creep in and creep in until he's got those fingers around your neck and he's ringing the life out of your house out of your church out of your car rides out of everything he wants to ring the life right out of it you know those stories when young guys get together did you see that guy did you hear what he said oh man if I would have been there I would have said and they list off this really powerful speech that's what then you know somebody I was in this place and this brother or this man or this woman they were talking about somebody else and I was like and I and you're like wow you go you said that no but I was thinking it everybody been there all right I'm so glad that we have recorded and written that there is a spirit that would love to beat you over the head with a club Corner Three Corner club or whatever else what other kind of abuse that the devil would like to put on you whether that be physical sickness or or or some sort of a teaching to throw you out into some fanaticism or whatever else and keep you away from the building blocks of the word and of Christ and of you know faith and love whatever it would be oh it' be in the name it's it's surely it'll be in the Name of Love it'll be in the name of Faith but it's not it is it is absolutely the devil and you know it as a Believer you and somebody was go prove it you go I just know it there's an unction that God has put within your heart that you just there's something in you and you just think well was it clean was it lovely was it honest and maybe that's what it you you you know you can't find you know where in 2 Chronicles where to rebut that thing but you know as a Believer because God has put some blocks within you that are firm that are big based blocks and I'm so glad that we have something that is written that if you try to pull this you'll deal with me and we can go back to the word we can go back to those tapes we can gather around the pure word of God and we can say you know this is what I'm experiencing in my life and we pour ourselves out before one another knowing that we care for one another knowing I know you've been where I've been I remember praying for you going through certain struggle so I know you know what I'm dealing with and let me tell you what I'm dealing with we don't have to cower to a dragon now you know this idea of if I would have been there let's there's been plenty of opportunity where a situation presents itself and you would think you know I'm going to run in there and deal with the situation and instead you're just Frozen you don't even know what to do and when the whole thing is said and done you thought I thought that I would have I thought I was the kind of guy that that would run in and attack that thing and you find out you're not that kind of guy I froze up I didn't know what to do in that situation and that's being real but when we have got a word that we can go back to when we can just the quotes that I read about sacrifice and patience and all these things and you can read that you can read your Bible and you can read what these men and what these women did and how they how they walked amidst those trials say God I don't know if I'm a Moses I don't know if I'm a Jeremiah I don't know if I'm a Amos or a micaah I don't know if I'm that but I believe like they believed and Lord as you're building me you know maybe maybe we think maybe maybe brother Reggie thinks I'd like an extra big block of faith God says no what I've given you is sufficient but if I had Faith I'd be able to run in and just deal with the situation he says yeah but you might be overzealous and you may go overcorrect that thing you may deal harshly you don't need that what you need is more love you think man really yeah you need some more of that and I have seen over the last few years even even being here even being amongst you all I've seen God do things in my life I was telling brother Phillip last night that two years ago if there was a certain situation presented itself I had an answer and it was solid I was I knew it and today it is absolutely different God has turned that thing totally around and I look at that and I just um Marvel at that but I see that everywhere here I don't see just that here I see that over in Bulgaria you know I I see that I see that all over the place it's it's being a Believer and it's those building blocks that God puts in your life and he places them in a way and in a place that you thought for sure that does not go there but when it's done wow it's perfect I'm closing with this in Acts 7: 47-49 says but Solomon built him in house how be it the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as sayth the prophet Heaven is my throne and Earth is my foot stol what house will ye build me sayeth the Lord or what is the place of my rest in the message what house will ye build me preached down in Tucson brother brandom and I realize he's talking about brother green brother Perry but just fit yourself in this says but we as this group of people we have a message for this day we believe that God has given us a message I think that's very gracious that brother brandham has included Us in this brother green is I don't want to call him my associate because we're well it is also my associate we're together in this message brother green preaches the same thing and message that I believe in he's left his home he's left his people he's left his church he was I believe he was a district superintendent or something of one of the organizations and give the whole thing up when he heard this he left everything that was dear to him also to come to the desert just to support what God is giving to us now I say I believe it's not only should be in our heart it should be in our duty to back him up everything that we can to attend the services to come here to worship and to make this a place where God can reveal to us the things that he's for us to reveal I say amen and as his word said the message doesn't come to me through the giving of the inspiration as it does maybe to some of us but he said I'm here to back up what God has given what a statement so what brother green is saying is God doesn't give me messages like he gives to brother brandham but I want to support with the way God made me as a Believer I want to be a support to the rest of this structure am called the body of Christ I want to be a pillar I want to be a corner I I want to be Crown molder I don't know what I don't know where you have need of me I don't know what piece where I fit into this whole thing but I want to be part of it so whatever God has made me the way he shaped me I'm sorry it's as Quirky as it is I'm sorry that it looks like it does but God I promise God's in it and I'm a part of this some of you go but you don't even you're kind of you you're funny looking in this like we're all normal stones and you're not I know but I I don't know what this thing's going to look like in the end y'all but you know maybe I'll be covered up with something else so you won't see this Stone you know I don't know I want to be part of it I'm in the body of Christ yeah and I believe if we will all cooperate together we'll put our hearts to it I know now listen to this I know that each one of you if you feel like I do I'm so hungry to see the spirit of God moving I just can't hardly stand it are you I'm so hungry to see the spirit of God moving I can't hardly stand it I can't wait to see these young people on fire for God oh I just can't hardly stand it I want to see the what God has got for your family I want to I can't hardly stand it I want to see God move in your families so much I'll take it further I want to see God move in Phoenix so much I'm hungry I just can't hardly understand it and if it's if it's with a still Small Voice so be it oh I want to see it though oh I want to be a part of it some experiences I just had up in the mountain just to feel that once again that something that when I was first Saved was So Glorious to my heart and we can come into a place we can sit and we can see it among us that we're that we're drying as we sit here in the desert I get among my brethren they talk with me and I talk with them always in a little way of watching feeling out there with the spirit as it was to see just the condition of that brother to see what's wrong I begin to feel us all reclining getting away from the spirit it's become too natural a thing to us we must Worship in the spirit the the uh where the spirit of God not only our message should be the flame of the hour it should be the flame in our hearts see it's got to be in our hearts or we can't we can't rightly present it to the people the spirit has to pack the message itself yes Lord I don't want it to be me packing this message I want it to be the spirit moving in me packing this message I want it to be that when you're around brother Reggie you're not like oh no you know you're not in the grocery store going oh no not that guy I want it to be oh brother good to see you like I don't mean that just for me I'm not just throwing myself in there like please I mean for each of us that when we see each other it's hey God bless you it's good to see you oh I need to pray more for you but I've been praying and I'm going to pray I'm going to pray more it's like that felt good well that felt good and man I tell you I've been I've been listening to the word and I've been in but I've been listening to a tape and God oh I feel like he's just speaking in my heart I believe he's got something for us and you go oo I like that keep listening yeah I'm trusting and believing in every one of you to be a real Christian now they need Sunday school teachers they're going to need a staff I think we filled those spots on that's this isn't a call to but maybe we need something else maybe we don't need Sunday school maybe we need a phone call once in a while huh you're going to need a staff and I want to

no so as we sit and we hear the preaching of the word we want it to change us day by day little by little in ways that are Beyond salvation and you understand what I mean by that Beyond salvation I'm not saying greater than salvation I'm just saying more [Music] intricately it's good for the older ones too you young people God is still adding blocks to your mom and dad God is still adding blocks
