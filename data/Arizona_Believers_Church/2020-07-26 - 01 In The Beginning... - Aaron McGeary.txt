TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and here in genesis chapter 1 verses 1 to 5 it says in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters and god said let there be light and there was light and god saw the light that it was good and god divided the light from the darkness and god called the light day and the darkness he called night in the evening and the morning were the first day and then i'd like to read also in john chapter one i've been looking at the phrase in the beginning and how that there's different uh references in scripture to the beginning of things i even uh not to address it this morning but even it speaks it when the in the address to the laodicean church age it refers to jesus christ as the beginning of the creation of god and there's such a beautiful mystery contained in that and here john chapter 1 verses 1 to 3 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god you can see just how genesis begins within the beginning now john beginning in the beginning was the word verse 2 the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer gracious heavenly father lord we thank you that we're together today we thank you that we have a hunger and our hearts for your word for that's been placed there by you and lord if there's a deep in our hearts crying out we know there's a deep to respond so i pray that you respond to the deep that's in the people's hearts today lord that you administer to them in a way that encourages them lord we look beyond these four walls today and we see a lot of uncertainty we see unrest we see hurt lord we see we see pain we see even anger and frustration and we see those that are sick and and a plague that has even gone around the world and social conditions that are very unstable but father what has drawn us today is your word what has our attention is your word and we know that it's your word that's the solution and the answer to everything outside these four walls so we give it preeminence today and we ask that you come break the bread of life to us as only you can in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen you may be seated now having us uh a short song service isn't a trick to be able to preach longer but we uh we do feel that the word should have the the preeminence in the first place and with the different settings that we're having to recognize and honor with the conditions and even the requirements of the state and the city and the county we felt it would just be best maybe to have an abbreviated song service and and get right into the word i i want to give you the title of this it's in the beginning and if the lord would lead perhaps there'd be more services to express this thought but in the beginning is my title and i just want to start with genesis chapter 1 verse 1 again it says in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and this is the phrase in the beginning is actually just one word in the hebrew but in the english it is these three words in the beginning and in the hebrew the beginning and what's being referred to in reference to something that is first it's even used to refer to something that is the best or the chief or even the choice part of something in the beginning the first even in our language it would be the time when something begins in the beginning it's the time when something has started or the act of starting something and as i pondered this it's very difficult even as a subject to know where to start and even as i pondered it where this phrase fits within the the plan of redemption and the story of god redeeming the earth and you you must start somewhere when telling a story and and we all likely usually we're going to tell a story we'll begin maybe chronologically and i went on a vacation and i left on this date and we begin to tell it in order and it is when god begins to tell this story he starts here with genesis in the beginning but this is not the beginning of god when he says in the beginning this isn't just all of a sudden there's nothing then there's something because god was before the beginning it says in the beginning god so we know that god was already there when this beginning starts or when he this this act starts something and elohim is the word that's used for god and that means the one who exists by himself and john gives us a little bit of a better understanding of who this one is it says in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god so in the beginning was the word in the beginning was elohim the one who existed by himself and even that that thought is difficult for us to grasp because if i said that brother john was alone by himself we would picture him within space with distance and time and how long were you by yourself and where were you and where was the closest person and you say i'm in the middle of nowhere i'm all by myself and no one else is here we still think in terms of light time and matter and we picture him within a space and nobody else around but when god was before the beginning there was no space there was no time there was no matter it was just god so existence was god god was the only existence and so he was one who existed he's the iem as the scripture tells us and in psalms 90 verse 2 it says before the mountains were brought forth or ever thou had formed the earth and the world even from everlasting to everlasting thou art god that's psalms 90 verse 2 before the mountains were brought forth before the earth was formed from everlasting to everlasting thou art god is saying before the beginning after the beginning you are you always will be thou art god so it's not once the earth was created or that god is becomes into existence but there was elohim before there even was time brother abraham says god covers all space and fills all time and runs into eternity and so eternity has no beginning it has no end so when this time begins god runs into this time and then he fills all time and space and then when it all ends it runs right back into eternity in genesis chapter 2 verse 4 it says these are the generations of the heavens and of the earth and you see how that connects with genesis 1 1 these are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created so heavens and earth were created by god in the day that the lord god made the earth and the heavens so it's the lord god he's described here as the lord god who made the earth and the heavens and lord is jehovah god is elohim and so jehovah it means the self-existent one it's adanahi which comes from havard and havan means to become it means to exist to become known and what and it says he's called the jehovah god a jehovah elohim he's continually becoming because you have a god that exists but nobody knows him there's nobody else with him there's not even a room that he inhabits there's not even space that he can travel he is just there all by himself and so but he has a characteristic he's known as lord god jehovah god adanahi which comes from this root to become or to exist so he's continually becoming he's a god that is un that unveils himself it is the unveiling of himself in romans chapter 1 verse 20 says for the invisible things of him romans chapter 1 verse 20 the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and godhead so the invisible god becomes known for what he creates and he this is this is then the becoming god he's once invisible he's once not known there's not even space that he inhabits but now this uh lord god this jehovah this one that exists by himself he then is going to unveil himself and become known so he is the invisible self-existent one who reveals himself and that's important to understand that that's the nature of god is he desires to express himself and to make himself known and brother bam says this in christ is that christ is revealed in his own word he says the entire bible is the entire revelation of jesus christ making himself known to every age so when we read here in genesis 1 we see that jesus christ is being made known when we read in john chapter 1 jesus christ is being made known he says he made himself known in the days of luther as a foundation the church the foot the legs like he did to king nebuchadnezzar you remember how he dreamed those dreams and come from the head down see now he comes from the feet up in the babylonian kingdom he showed all those old testaments he come from the head down until he come down till god himself became flesh at the foot of the ladder this is brother branham giving quite an interesting perspective how it's in the old testament it's god consending down and god coming down and then he says before he comes to the foot of the ladder and we can see that this is god who in the beginning was the word and then it's god who's invisible who unfolds himself down all the way to where he's made flesh in his son jesus christ and that's the becoming god all the way down through this time to now he's at the foot of the ladder in the flesh of his son jesus and then he turns it around and this is very beautiful now here in the new testament he brings himself right back up again to the head again the head of gold to be crowned so god was in the beginning and he kept coming down through the prophets and on down until god himself became human like us plumbed down at the foot of the ladder a baby born in a manger hated rejected despised in a bad name in everything he was and that's a remarkable way of describing it because you picture the god of heaven who begins all by himself and then he and we know kind of the backstory to this in the beginning was the word so there is a point where this god forms himself into a logos it's a theophany body and he from that he begins to create it's in that form that he can become god had god just created something here's the invisible god who creates something and it would be like uh what what's going on here i just i just got here uh what am i doing here so god has to form even a being that one's angels has created becomes god because he's not god until he's worshipped and we know the message teaches us things very plainly to understand this and so brother branham is saying that this one who was omniscient all powerful unseen invisible has now come from being the preeminent one who exists by himself this this mighty god bound by an oath down to a baby in a manger and this was the becoming god because when he creates adam or when he forms the logos and then creates angels he's worshipped as god when he creates adam this is a mature male there in the garden with the female in him but when he gets down to the foot of the ladder he's a baby born in the manger a baby that's probably already got rumors swirling around about its origin a baby that's already in an uncertain time not even born in a proper setting but that's the way that god brought him forth he's there at the foot of the ladder and then brother bram says then he started rising and from the feet he began to build the bride oh isn't that wonderful to think that this is what he came down to and then now that he's at the feet when he begins to rise he's not necessarily bringing himself back up but he's bringing a bride up because we know and i feel that i'm preaching to very mature believers today and so in my mind i kind of think of a in a way that a subject matter unfolds i think well we can bring in at another time how that in this invisible god was one singular purpose the heart purpose of god was to have a bride of his choosing and so when brother brahm says he started to rise he began to build the church the bride when he begins to rise back up it's not so much a resurrection of himself as much as it is an expression of himself in bright form because that's what his desire was all along so once he had achieved christ now he wants to achieve the bride bride to christ and so now it's coming back he says on back and now coming out into the headstone where it all joins together and makes the one great transfigured body of jesus christ which is what you are my that's wonderful i just feel so much of a blessing in reading that that you just feel like if we stopped there we could say it's good to been in the house of the lord and i'm glad that not none of you are saying well that's just a good stopping point brother aaron let's go see what they have at the breakfast but you could just see a beautiful picture in this as brother branham describes that now gen even the word genesis as we read in genesis chapter one genesis in the latin means generation or nativity so it's the the the generation of something nativity of something and in the greek and it comes from the this even in the latin it comes from greek which means origin or creation or again generation and its root is from the word the greek word which means to be born so genesis refers to something being born it's related to genos which is race or to birth or to beget and the very root of all these words and the very root of genesis is gene so it speaks of the source of something the origin or something and we know that it speaks gene speaks of a seed and then in a seed there's dna there's instructions everything that that that is everything that any a plant is going to become is in the germ is in the seed and so you may look at a you may look at an apple tree and you may see it full of apples or more appropriately here in the valley of citrus tree and you look at that citrus tree and it began with the seed just one seed but every orange that's going to be on that tree was in that seed now that's hard to get your head around that but every every orange that's ever going to be on that citrus tree is in that one seed that's planted and brother berry coffee has a saying that anybody can count the apples that's on a tree but god can count the apples that's in the seed and because it's in there it's programmed in that and just to share a story that really really blessed me we were renting a home in north carolina and pray for us we're right now trying to find a place to live in phoenix and my goodness i've never seen a hotter real estate market in my life but uh we we planted a little garden sister elizabeth planted some lettuce and some different things on one side of the house and she hey jack was there helping and she had planted a whole row of cucumbers and jack took a seed he said i want to plant a seed he took one little seed and he went to the front of the house where there's a rather large little flower bed there and he took that seed and he planted it almost right next to the concrete and he just planted that seed there and it's fast forward a few months and not one cucumber has grown on the one side of the house nothing ever came up but we've got a jar of homemade pickles that have come from that one little vine that grew out of the ground and even right now there's probably still two dozen blooms on it that overnight turn into a little cucumber and by the next day it's big enough to be pulled off and elizabeth pickles them and they've been absolutely uh wonderful to taste but what struck me elizabeth said that's the one that jack planted and i realized it was the faith of a five-year-old who was like mom we're planting cucumbers i want to plant one and by faith he took a seed and he went over and said you're a cucumber seed then i'm going to get cucumbers and he planted in the ground and it's the only one that came up and who knows it very well could have been the experience of sister elizabeth as a green thumb who knows like you know what there's not a left enough direct sunlight here those groundhogs keep eating all the lettuce it's probably not going to be able to come up this isn't the best place to plant cucumbers and so she had enough experience to think cucumbers may not work here but childlike faith to say if it's a cucumber seed then i'm going to get cucumbers and he planted it in the ground and it came forth and so in the same way that genesis refers to a gene or a seed then there's something in there to come forth and in the in the greek or even the greek translators who translated the book of the bible and translated it from hebrew they used genesis from the hebrew word bereshith which is one word bereshith but in the english it's three words in the beginning so in the in the hebrew there was just one word that started it all be rashed in the beginning it's the first word of the torah it's the first word of the bible when you would open the torah it says bereshef into the english it's in the beginning but in that it's now the gene that is coming forth there's a seed there's an origin and i read somewhere and studying this that how bearish that this word the the beta the word the uh it comes and beth is first in the in the bible and somehow the alpha is is is skipped over and there's some rich history within the rabbinical teaching on why this was so and i pawned it and i realized the alpha already was so the next was the beth because the alpha existed before time so when it says beverage you have the alpha the alpha you have god elohim and then the very next is the bearish sheth in the beginning was god and genesis it is the introductory chapter to god's story of expressing himself with the purpose of achieving a bride he had a purpose in doing what he was doing and i feel it's this purpose that we must always keep in mind otherwise even the story of redemption the story of salvation almost becomes arbitrary it seems even accidental and how that god created adam and eve like a kin and barbie doll and oh my i'm gonna have a nice little playhouse and all of a sudden the barbie gets out of hand and and ken follows along with it he's like oh no what do i do with my playground and he comes up with an idea to redeem things that's not it at all god wanted to have a bride of his choosing and actually places these people in the conditions and the situation all with it knowing that i have a whole plan to end up in the last days with this a bride of his choosing that loves him contrary to to opposition and despite weakness and difficulty that she's going to love him and love him for who he is the word and he knew that's what he wanted in the end and that's that's why things unfold the way they do it's not just arbitrary he says well i'm gonna punish you adam and i'm gonna punish you even i'm gonna punish the serpent and many times they only look at three that are punished in the judgment but the earth is also punished there's four that are punished and that god just says well then i'm gonna punish you all and i'll figure it out later it says i know what i'll do i'll bring a sacrifice but it was and then when i and then the idea the kind of the nominal teaching is i'll have a sacrifice and then those who accept them they can get back in and they can come back into salvation but it wasn't arbitrary to those who will believe and those who will accept them he gave a redeemer to redeem that which was in his heart in the beginning so his purpose the genesis as we read it it's a story an introductory chapter to god's story telling his own telling of him expressing himself for the purpose of having a bride and so it holds all the patterns it holds the types it foreshadows things it is the foundation and it holds the seeds of everything that will be and i'm gonna i'm gonna take my time just to emphasize this this morning in in the message of the hour and just go and just be patient and diligent to read a number of places so that we can establish in the beginning how what what the importance of this genos is this genesis of the bible because this is the beginning of god expressing himself because we wouldn't know him otherwise unless this book had been written now there was a brother ramp says that god's first bible was in the stars and where do we see the beginning of that we read about it in the bible and so brother branham says in the message why i am a holy roller he says in genesis was the seed chapter where all the seeds were sown everything that you find in the world today came out of genesis everything began back there in the beginning so he's saying everything that's why the bible said there's nothing new under the sun because god in the beginning put it all there now we know there's things that come forth and we'll touch on it here in a moment that began in this book that we see coming forth in genesis but that's a that's how satan's plan comes into picture so brother says it's just like sowing a crop if you watch what kind of seed you got no matter what it looks like when it's this high you'll have to see what it is what seed it is you'll have to see what it'll be when it comes to seed if it's wheat corn or whatever it is it might look like a weed but if it's a wheat down here in the bottom it'll produce a wheat up there it's just what it is and when i was uh weeding the flower gardens and i was pulling all the weeds out and all the grass and everything i happened upon this plant i didn't know what it was and it looked like a weed because it was right on top of the concrete and i didn't think it was anybody who was planting something would want to plant but it had a little bit of flowering to it i thought you know what i'll just leave it and sure enough it was that cucumber plant and i wouldn't have known it i wouldn't have known that it was cucumbers i just know well it has a bud on it maybe this is something that that was coming back up or maybe something there elizabeth plant and i left it alone and brother said you got to wait it may look like a weed but what was in the seed is going to come forth you can't judge it till it comes to fruit he says now we go back to genesis to find out everything and then he uses the example of babylon and how that even in the book of genesis you find the seeds of babylon and he and he shows how we come all the way over here into the book of revelation where it's in the end time and where babylon ends up he says see you see the seeds of babylon in genesis now we see the maturing and the it's a perfection of it but yet we see the perverseness of it in the book of revelation which is manifested in our day in our time you see the seeds in genesis you see the maturing and the expression in revelation we see it today it begin back then and then it comes to fruit and the time we're living and he uses that example he says but you've got to go back to the beginning to start everything and this is a statement that really struck me because i wanted just to use the statement in genesis was the seed chapter it just to show where i'm saying you go to go back to genesis to find everything go back to genesis to the beginning to start everything then he says this if the faith that was once delivered to the saints we got to go plumb back to the beginning to get it to find out what we're going to talk about so he says we're going to talk about the faith that was once delivered to the saints he said if you want to know the faith that's once delivered you've got to go back to the beginning to know what that faith is now in one sense we've got to go back to the day of pentecost to know that the faith that was once delivered but even then we'd have to go back to when christ was with the disciples to understand the faith that they had to be in the upper room and to receive the outpouring and then to understand even who christ is you'd have to go back to go back he's saying let's go all the way back to the beginning to know what this faith is that we're being restored back to because it's we it is not just a faith to hold us together uh uh and to keep a profession of faith until one day a minister stands over our casket and delivers a wonderful eulogy about how wonderful we were and how much we believed the message and how faithful we were to our children and how what a great guy we were what a great mother we were that's not the end game of this message and the faith that was once delivered to the saints the purpose of that faith is to defeat death that there'd be no more caskets for the elect there'd be no more burials for the believer and that one day one day we're going to have the last funeral for a believer one day the last bride member is going to be buried and there'll be no more gravesides there'll be no more funerals there'll be no more weeping but there's going to be a people who have the faith that was once delivered in his perfection be translated and meet the lord in the air that's the purpose of this he says you got to go back to the beginning to even understand that and then the message who do you say this is he's speaking about the foolish virgin and then he he likens he says that and it's uh it's i guess it's a very deep uh teaching that he's pointing it out because you think about my this is very staggering to understand the foolish virgin he looks at the the example of eve he said you have the fullest virgin but then you but you can go back and see in eve that she even played that part of this foolish virgin he says notice the woman here represents the future denominational church called bride not the bride but they call themselves bride the woman here represents the future denominational church called bride so he says the foolish virgin that can be typed by eve he says it's represented here and it's the future denominational church he says it all comes up in genesis it's a seed you start in genesis you'll get your picture straight so again in the beginning in genesis in this genos chapter in the c chapter he says it all come up in genesis and and the way that uh in the way that the the lord just uses the the burden that i have in my heart when i begin to look at a subject i just begin to see a road map like you could just preach on this forever because you could just start well let's just do genesis 1 1 and then just stay and you can stay on genesis 1 1 forever and then you're like well of course you can with this because it's the seeds of everything it's connected throughout because it's taking it would be like taking that little cucumber seed or that little citrus seed and then being able by revelation to describe and bring forth every orange that would hang on that tree every cucumber that's going to be pickled and just and bring it out in that setting because it's all right here he says you start in genesis it all come up in genesis as a seed he says an end time seed sign or end time sign seed he says as i was preaching yesterday on the seed it's the word all things begin in genesis because genesis means beginning or seed chapter of the bible everything we have on earth today the origination of it started in genesis and then he he he adds this part and i want you to catch it that it's not he's not changing what he's saying but he's showing that there was something that began also in genesis that wasn't part of the beginning that god sowed seed but then satan took that seed and hybrid it and when that happens it's no longer the original so it comes up in genesis but it wasn't in the beginning and that's where the um brother branham points back to in certain times you got to know what the original was what was the original spoken seat word c what was the original in the creation if it was an original attribute of god it never ends right as there's something brother jason watkins uh shared one time in fellowship it might just it just made everything connect for me in terms of the original attributes he said the earth the heavens and the earth were original spoken word attributes of god that's why in the new heavens and new earth they're not completely annihilated and destroyed and cast in the lake of fire but they're renovated why because god redeems his original attributes that's why we you are an original attribute your original gene you you have no beginning really you have you will have no end you will you you do not have to even in eternity you have a different uh uh promise because only the elect only the predestined are included in redemption but yet there's still others who are there in eternity who are preserved by the word of god but yet we have a different inheritance he says all things begin in genesis he says the origination of it started in genesis he says now we have things today that did not begin in genesis because it's been hybrid anything hybrid is a phony it's no good it cannot reproduce itself and anything that's hybrid is man-made and cannot bring itself back again now you could see just how expansive this is to begin to ponder what the original sin was the original sin wasn't serpent seed that's the result of the original sin the original sin is the hybrid god's original seed and he says this continuing in the same sermon therefore anything that wasn't spoken by god in the beginning is a hybrid and he's talking about how uh a mayor a mule and those things that can't breathe themselves back in and you just you breathe these things and and you breed the corn your hybrid corn and you show how you plant it it won't come up he says therefore anything that wasn't spoken by god in the beginning is a hybrid so you have something that's in the beginning by the spoken word then you have other things that follow in this seed chapter that are not part of the original and that gives you a test to be able to determine is this original or is it hybrid because if it's hybrid it won't produce the results that the original can he says that's the way that the people get away from the word of god it becomes a hybrid affair it must die it cannot bring forth of its kind to life again the church that will refuse to believe the word of god is a hybrid church with dogmas creeds doctrines that's not scriptural and i say this in my heart is starting even this this work today and this service together that the foundation must be the word the attraction must be the word what is lifted up must be the word he says church that refuses to believe the word of god is hybrid even as we have named this church arizona believer's church it's abc but everyone says never get away from your abc's always believe christ what is christ he is the word that's what these seals represent they represent christ the word so our what we must always be identified with is not personality not politics not pretense but it is the word that gathers us together it's you want to be a people that believe the word of god a church that does not believe the word of god is a hybrid church what you are are you are believers you're not identified with even one particular doctrine you're not identified with a particular way of worship or or a particular building i love the fact that we can start from scratch fresh not with any particular building or doctrine or personality or idea idea but say if you're hungry for the word of god if god calls you in your heart to the word then this is the word's gonna be what has preeminence and he says continuing the church cannot bring forth a spirit-filled child because it's hybrid it's no good he says it might be bigger great big walls fine pews big bells plush seats no pews not even a musician not even a song leader he says it might be bigger great big walls fine pews big bells plush seats but that doesn't mean one thing it's spiritually dead that's right it cannot bring forth spirit-filled children because it's dead itself now what is it that's going to bring forth spirit-filled children is it a is it a really dynamic song service is it is it a charismatic altar call no what's going to bring for spirit-filled children is is a belief in the word of god and even for that child unaware of its own election to be in an atmosphere where the word has preeminence and they believe that that word is for them and they come even if it isn't an altar call it's where the word has prince and it's the word that's pulled them brought them forth it's the word that meets them at the altar and it's a word birth that they experience in knowing him and forgiveness of sins it's the word that must have preemised in the message marriage and divorce brother branham makes this statement and he's addressing the subject of marriage and divorce and what he does is he uses jesus then they come to jesus and they ask him the question well why did moses give us a rid of divorce and he basically says well he did it for this reason and he did it for that reason but it wasn't so from the beginning so when he answers the question of marriage and divorce he points out he's pointing out to them that moses gave you the rid of divorce because of the fall of mankind so this writ of divorce and i'll just be very blunt he says because the hardness of your hearts so these men go up there well why did moses give us the permission to divorce our wives he says because you have hard hearts that's why he says but from the beginning it wasn't so because adam didn't have a hardened heart so he's showing that yeah that's the reason why he did it because of the condition of mankind says but from the beginning it wasn't so and he's showing when jesus wants to answer the question and get it straight he says yeah it may be this way now but if you want to know the real answer go back to the beginning so bravo answers the question the true answer that jesus wants us to go back to is to go back to the beginning then that would be in genesis because the word genesis is the seed chapter to every question in the bible and you always have to go back to the seed to see what kind of seed is in the field to find out what your crops will be now what kind of seed is sown genesis being the seed chapter we go back to genesis jesus introduces us to that script scripture at the beginning now remember and i think it may be in the book of mark where he says at the beginning he made a male and female and so i think in matthew then even in mark when he's answering this question he's referring it's phrased where they're going back to the beginning from the beginning he says at the beginning now remember that's when time started to begin before that it was eternity and brother branham in this message he he brings us to genesis 3 15 when the curse comes upon the serpent and when the curse comes upon the serpent what god has hid in the curse to the serpent is the seed of redemption and the mystery of redemption and a redeemer so in judgment to the serpent is actually a promise to the bride a promise of redemption and brethren says that ends the beginning so once you get to the curse to the serpent now he says that ends the beginning and now there's something different that has unfolded from there and this is the fallen creation this is the hybrid creation that's now intermingled with the the original creation and that from there it said that ends the beginning now something different has unfolded so he says he told you when time started to begin before that it was eternity so actually time is entered in now once the final judgment comes but before that there was only eternity that once death entered into the soul of eve it begins to fade away and now he says now it's time now you're only in time he says now our question there notice if we go back to the beginning now don't fail this and that's the reason i want to talk slow so that the people out on the wires and the tape will say say it clearly if jesus said go back to the beginning there was only one pair of anything on earth there was one adam one eve they were joined by god alone one female horse one male one female parrot one male at the beginning as he told us to go back there was only one pair of anything then we find out that everything in the beginning and this is i wanted to emphasize this everything in the beginning was running in perfect order in harmony with god in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth and he says everything was running in perfect order and harmony with god nothing was out of cater everything in heaven is still in order and all the stars the galaxies the solar system everything is perfectly in order so although there has been calamity on the earth because the woman got out of step but you look to the heavens and everything is timed perfectly they can even tell you when the last time this comment came by and the next time it will come by and they can even time it like go ahead and set your clock they can tell you when the next solar eclipse is going to be they they can plan all this out why it's perfectly timed perfectly set in order graham says it's still in continuity with god it's still in harmony with god the soul says everything still perfectly in order that's how that we even have with the rotation of the of the earth and its rotation around the sun it's perfectly we keep time by it we can plan these things but he says one of them moved it would interrupt the whole program maybe and greatest battle ever fought he talks about how if one of those stars was to get out the moon was to move its place the earth would be flooded in a moment one interruption spoils the entire program now when human beings were running and continuing to god in continuity with god with one man and one woman this woman sinned and it throwed the whole earthly program out of continuity with god then this interrupts things it's chaotic it's discord therefore one word added to this book or one word taken from it it throws a christian out of continuity with god throws a church out of continuity with god throws a family out of continuity with god every believer can be thrown out by not accepting every word of god that's your that's your um covenant those are your marching orders this is what you're bound to as a believer you must believe every word of god if there is if it is in the word of god then you believe it and you take it as the word if there's a question as to what it means you say lord i believe your word is true i i may not understand that that light that someone's trying to put on i may not understand that context that somebody else is putting on but lord don't let me reject your word on the basis of somebody else's misinterpretation or even on the basis of unfaithful people who carry it lord don't let me attach other things to this word and whether it be stigma or or history or rumor or whatever it may be lord i believe your word is true and let the true interpretation come to me lord let the revelation of your word be dawned upon me because lord i don't want to make the mistake of adding to or taken away because if i do i'm thrown out when i do it throws my family out of continuity with god when i do the church can be taken out of continuity with god so we must the word must have the preeminence so in genesis we see the beginning of all things it's and we can see the beginning of god's purpose right and that's that in itself you can just take that that that thread and identify god's purpose all the way from the beginning how that god desired god's heart purpose in the beginning was to have a bride of his choosing and it's that heart purpose of god that very passion to have a bride that causes this invisible self-existing one to form himself into a body now what what dynamics worked upon this the strong one this mighty one bound by an oath what worked upon him to actually go from being the only thing being invisible to form himself into something visible call a body called a theophany the logo to create from it was his desire for you to have fellowship with you that became the passion the in the energy that formed himself into a logos and then you can see that god then models himself and he creates angels and now he is god the pyramid and he's worshipped by angels but he's not done he creates an order in a hierarchy and then from that he creates the earth and then he begins to model himself in the earth he's now in a supernatural spiritual realm and then he creates adam first as a spirit being and in that he's in the likeness of god but then he wants to follow himself into a body and now in that body adam becomes on earth in flesh what god was in a theophany in heaven and so now adam's on earth and god says oh this is good and then the next thing you know he says it's not good for what for man to be alone and brother branham says it's because god saw in adam himself it's now a mirror and so even before god could have a bride he expresses you by bringing the woman out of adam so in the beginning you could see the purpose of god but not only can you see the purpose of god in the in genesis in the beginning you can also see satan's plan and satan being stripped of the ability to create he can only pervert so he has to work with what god has spoken by his word in the beginning and all he can do is defile it and pervert it and so you can see how satan very quickly when we get to genesis chapter three he's already there we got two chapters boom he's already there perverting it now we might think man what a horrible story why it began so well and we only get to chapter three and already in chapter three we don't even know really what's going on and already satan's got into this thing and messed it all up god put it on the basis that he would do it used the he used the ambition and the false agenda in satan's heart for his own purposes because what do you want to do he wanted to express himself he wanted to unfold himself and so god accomplished creation he spoke and he performed his word and then he made sure he knew one day and he saw that it would be recorded that in the pentagon moses writing these books that god did all things these things and then he would give inspiration for one to write and go back and say in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth he spoke he performed performed it then he preserved the narrative of it for our benefit because he had something that he wanted to express and so in the speaking of it in the performing things happen but yet even in it i i can honestly just say this if it wasn't for the fact that brother branham william brown the prophet of god in fulfilling malachi 4 and and revelations 10 7 you wouldn't be able i wouldn't be able to preach this if somebody said brother aaron you've got no ministry outside of outside of william branham i might say guilty is charged and they say that actually to say well you know there's nothing to your prophet there's nothing to what you believe you'd have nothing without him and i would say you're right you're exactly right you take you take this uh you take this message this word away from take the bible away take this away take it what are we standing on what do we have what do we have to identify ourselves with but you wouldn't be able to identify this without the word being opened up to us and the revelation coming because all you would see is god creating all you'd see is is things coming forth and you could always try to guess well what is he trying to do here what is he trying to accomplish if we went over to someone's home and we saw they're out busy doing yard work and they're putting a fresh coat of paint on in there and they're setting up these things and things ready to say well i wonder i wonder what he's doing it looks like maybe he's going to be hosting something later something's going on and you don't know until someone can tell you oh he's preparing to have a gathering and this person's coming or it's a it's a backyard wedding for his daughter you don't know you could guess all day long at the movement in the activity but until you know the purpose then it all begins to make sense go ah well that explains this and that explains that and so we look back on it and we could even with this if with the revelation that we have now we could begin to see that god was expressing something in all of it adam even on earth all alone there was a mystery to that what was it that this was god when adam when the woman was brought out of man that this is god unfolding that mystery because god even in the beginning when he did all of it he still hides himself he doesn't say in the beginning god wanted to have a bride of his choosing that in a day called the laodicean day there would be a group of people called believers and they would believe in a prophet his name would be william branham and and then it just tells you everything up front and here goes the story of how we got there it doesn't work that way it just starts out in seed form and look at how many people probed and guessed at it but the bible says in isaiah 45 15 verily thou art a god that hides thyself oh god of israel the savior this is the very nature of god to hide himself so even though he's unfolding himself and even though he's allowing it to be preserved and to be written by inspiration we believe the breath of god wrote this bible we believe that this bible is the infallible word of god we believe that this bible even though it might to the academics have contradictions and things be out of place and no geographical proof and no scientific proof and things happen in this bible that cannot be scientifically proof and as a matter of fact have been proven to be scientifically impossible we believe it to be the word of god and we and we believe these things be it even with everything that's recorded god is still a god that hides himself so that's the nature of god to hide himself but it's also his nature to reveal himself and god hides himself in simplicity and reveals himself in the same and so yes it's the nature of god to hide himself but it's also his desire to make himself known in the simplicity of it to make himself known in the place that he's hiding if god hides in simplicity don't go looking for great big things to find him he doesn't move from his simplicity his hiding place and then go find end up in something great fantastic to the natural eye he's going to be hid right where he is and that's where he's going to be found romans 11 33 and 34 says oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of god how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out for who have known the mind of the lord who have been his counselor this is this is the nature of god his judgments are unsearchable his ways are past finding out says who hath known the mind of the lord who can be his counselor the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of god this is paul setting forth that his judgments are unsearchable his ways pass behind you now how is it that you can know his ways how is it you can search his judgments he tells us in corinthians by his spirit for the spirit search of all things yea the deep things of god the things of god are known by the spirit of god and he says yeah he's given us these things he's freely given these us these things it's by the spirit of god that we can understand these very things that's why the scripture says this in ecclesiastes chapter 3 verse 11 he hath made everything beautiful in his time think of that phrase he hath made everything beautiful in his time if something's ugly right now in your life just know that he makes everything all things beautiful in his time could you imagine if if if your wife or your mother or someone you know says i'm i'm gonna i'm i'm making a beautiful cake and and you just went in there and on the on the table was all these ingredients on the counter and you say well beautiful cake my this what is this oh my goodness that's salt that's that's oh what is cocoa oh i can't i'll never forget the first time i think one of my kids was like hershey powder awesome let's just spoon this thing in by the tablespoons and it's like oh that's awful yep coco is bitter you got to add the right things to it to make it what it what it can be and so you could look in on something in an intermediary step and say well that's that's not good and that's not good and that's not good but just give god time he makes all things beautiful in his time he says also he had set the world in their heart so that no man can find out the work that god maketh from the beginning to the end it's a very uh weighty very heavy heavy statement in the amplified it says he has also planted eternity in man's heart and mind a divinely implanted sense of purpose working through the ages which nothing under the sun but only god can satisfy it speaks to the germ of life inside the believer that once quickened by the holy spirit can then begin to understand what god is doing otherwise we're just guessing paul said you know the things of man by the spirit of man that is in you and so then man can have some kind of camaraderie with another man when he hears that you're going through something oh i know what that's like i feel sorry for you oh that happened to you i know what that's like because we know by shared experience in our human emotions what another person's feeling and then by the spirit of god we can relate to the things of god so he it takes eternity it takes the spirit of god in our hearts to know the divine plan of god and to be able to see the strand of god's purpose from the beginning to the end otherwise it's hidden it's hidden from the natural man it's hidden out of their sight to where man can't make the work of god find out the work of god from the beginning to the end that's exactly why when christ came you think with the depth of prophecy that had been given with the signs and wonders that had been done and here he is saying that he's declaring that he is the son of god and and he's believed to be the messiah and now wouldn't it be the moment when everything would click and make sense and they would accept him as their redeemer and to deliver but no in that very moment they crucified him why because it was hid from them they didn't have that divine spark on the inside to be able to see the purpose of god from the beginning say oh he would be lowly he would be humble he would be despised and rejected only from the eternal perspective can we discover what god intended by creation only by the divine revelation of the word of god can we look back and see all these seeds in genesis where god was hiding himself he's hid his meaning in creation he's given in the beginning as we begin to read this he's given us a window into his heart to know his mind and actually when you begin to realize that this window is a glimpse into his mind and brother branham could tell us that now what was in the back part of god's mind is unfolding it's a revelation of everything that he's been doing and then you realize it's not so much a window as much as it is a mirror because you're looking into it and seeing yourself and you can look into the beginning in the beginning and see yourself and though it may be hidden don't be maybe mysterious in matthew chapter 13 verse 11 they ask him in verse 10. why do you speak this way it seems like you're you're telling stories and we're kind of like i don't know and he says why do you speak in parables why do you talk this way he says because it's given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given the mere writing of this bible the mere transcribing and the inspiration the theater new stars the breath of god that wrote the scripture wasn't enough for it to be understood wasn't enough for everyone to know what god was doing the revelation of it is missing the revelation has to come to say oh i see myself in that now it's not so much a window it's even not so much a story but it's actually a mirror where i see god's purpose and how what it means for me and it is it's given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven there was a quote that was running through my mind time and time again over the last couple weeks as i was preparing this actually i'd say more appropriately just over the last week or so coming to my mind over and over again it's from the token where brother man says the way god starts that's the way god finishes so we see in the beginning god then we know in the end it will be god and the way that god starts by his spoken word and there's all these things my mind begin to think the way god starts that's the way god finishes i was pondering how that in that's in that sense there's ways that we could look at that and it can become very heavy for us the beginning of the thing is is what sets it on its course and we're taught that if something deviates if you take a gun and you put in the sights and brother mike was shared a video of brother mitch in a shooting course and it was uh it was really it's you wanted to kind of get a full scope of what was happening no pun intended as you watch someone they're shooting shooting down range and you realize that if the sight is off just the least little bit in the beginning the longer that bullet travels the more the further off it gets and so it becomes a very heavy weight upon us to realize when we look if there was any in the beginning if it didn't start right then you begin to think well is it a doomed course it didn't start right but the way god starts that's the way god finishes and i i didn't put it in my notes i didn't put the quote there but this morning a pastor from amarillo brother jeremy shriner sent a group text message out and it was that quote and i just text him right away i said brother that means so much to me and it's encouraging because there was some logistical uh problems in trying to get the room for this morning and we didn't know how the service was gonna be and just him sending that just confirmation lord that was a very quote that was in my mind in my heart all week now a brother shares this with me and i said i'm i'm i'm preaching on in the beginning this morning my first service for this church i'm starting in phoenix and i said that scripture is just a confirmation to me that quotes a confirmation to me he says wow you're starting your first we're celebrating today our 48th anniversary of a church the 48th and immediately something my heart just said arizona was the 48th state added to the union and i told him they said you can't make this stuff up so i say i'm not saying it is but could it be i did drive by and i saw a sign i did literally a sign in scottsdale it said aaron for arizona it was just it was something i want to get a picture of it i'm going to ask the guy if he loses can i have those signs all right and i was going to take a picture and send it to somebody and say this is a sign and then no matter what objection they have i said no it is literally a sign but the way god starts that's the way god finishes and so it just almost just almost been an hour here with you in the it's been over an hour from the start but just in the minister of the word i know it's been almost an hour don't mean to uh belabor this but i want to ask this in closing what does god want me to see in the beginning ask yourself that question what does god want me to see in the beginning how is it that i i how is it god wants me to first relate to it and i could be so direct in saying this i know that god has quickened this to me for your benefit to encourage you where you are right now because we ponder our path we say well this where i am today here i am i'm x number of years old i'm in this station in life and and we see the path that we've gone and it's easy to say where i am today what do i have to show for everything that's transpired what what has been accumulated what has been added what has been saved up and and where where am i today to be able to say oh this is all been built up and added to this and this is where i am now and as we begin to look back we see ups and downs and we see false starts we see things that we wanted to do that don't turn out right things that we started all this seems great oh my this is it this is going to be and then it and it fails and it doesn't work out or we have great ambitions and we see that we have failed ambitions and as we begin to look back we realize man there's a lot of ups and downs things haven't quite worked out maybe the way that i thought they'd work out and it's easy to get discouraged and then we begin to look at it this way the way something starts the way that it finishes and we see the seed of things and what the seeds were and the fruit that comes out and we think my what seeds have been sown where's the pattern for me as i began to look in the beginning was the garden of eden in the beginning was perfection in the beginning was all these wonderful things and i said well where what was my beginning how did things look for me and he wonder where's the hope the bible says in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god so there was the perfect word dwelling imperfection and then this perfect word this perfect god then begins to unfold himself and when we think in the beginning we think of a perfect garden in eden in god's light the garden we see oh this is beautifully pre-figuring a bride my my spouse is like a garden and clothes and we say oh my here's the bride there in pre-figure glorious and splendor and perfect and yet we don't see ourselves that way but look again at genesis chapter 1 verses 1 to 5. spare with me just a little bit longer look again and let's look at what we must first relate to in the beginning what is it god wants us to first identify with or maybe if i could put it this way what is it that we could most easily relate to in our brokenness in our disappointments in our discouragements it says in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and notice this the earth now god just created this mind satan didn't create this this isn't this isn't the children playing with plato this is god god creates the heavens and the earth and then the very first description and the earth was without form that means confusion and void speaks of emptiness god's created it now but in its very first description of it the very first manifestation of it is it's without form and it's void it's confusion and emptiness it says in darkness was upon the face of the deep there was this fluid mass and water mixed it was it was chaotic so it says in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth in our minds we think this beautiful radiant light and and the birds flying and beautiful palm trees and and adam tall dark and handsome and oh my this is beautiful but yet god actually the very first description he gives of his creation without form it's a it's confusion when it says this without form and then says void it's empty you wouldn't look at it and think well i know what to do with this it's and it says darkness is upon the face of the deep it was like the fl there was it was almost as if there was a substance of earth but yet it was a mass it was a fluid mass and it's mixed with water and it doesn't seem like you couldn't swim in this can you walk on it what do you do this and if any one of us today were to look at that we would all we'd probably be repulsed this this confusion is chaotic it's chaos in the beginning but then it says and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters and god said let there be light and there was light and god saw the light that it was good and god divided the light from the darkness showing now that he's also showing that he's going to begin to separate fluid mess he's going to bring forth a and even in the the torah and the original hebrew teaching of this it begins to describe how that now by the agency of god's spoken word things begin to be ordered let there be light and there was light and he saw the light that was good and god divided the light from the darkness and god called the light day in the darkness he called night and the eden in the morning were the first day god is now bringing order the word of god moved on dead and chaotic elements think about that the word of god moved where there was emptiness moved where there was a void moved where there was chaos and confusion moved where there was a fluid mass and water all mixed together and then he began to speak things and took these chaotic elements combine things together arrange things and then he actually quickens them they're all laying there in its mass and confusion and disorder but then god by the spoken word forms them into a condition to be the foundation of a new creation to bring forth a beautiful eden of holiness but how did it begin and then i would say this to us and to you individually no matter how chaotic your life may seem our first the first way we can relate to genesis chapter one is not with the beautiful eden but with the emptiness and the void and the emptiness we feel in our hearts the voids that we sometimes feel like the darkness that seems to pervade over our situation and then we realize there's only one solution it's for the word of god to come and quick and even chaotic elements and even fluids that darkness and chaos and all the confusion and bring order and put things into the right foundation to bring forth a new creation and an eden of holiness that means to me that regardless of how we read it earlier we talked about a church getting out of cater and a family getting out of cater and a believer getting out of cater it's because they rejected the word then it's empty it's void it's chaos but then let the spoken word the spirit of god move again upon the face of the waters take the chaotic home life take the chaotic personal life take all the confusion and bring order and produce an eden i do not believe it's a coincidence that we've gathered in a garden inn today why because god wants to take chaos and confusion and emptiness and the spirit of god move upon the deep to bring bring chaos back into order and that's what the word still does today with our chaos it's what he can do with your darkness it's what he can do with your brokenness he can move upon it and bring new life therefore there's nothing that it could be so chaotic and out of order that god can't fix i say this in hope to our families our loved ones our children whatever it may be even our hopes for fellowship and to have and to have a normal church services and have feet washing and communion all these things we desire to do in obedience to the word listen no matter how chaotic it may be out there the word can still move and the spirit can move and bring foundation bring order and bring life bring holiness bring salvation brother braham says in the message note that not in the beginning of the creation of god when he begin to create and bring you into existence you see you started back there as a seed and worked down to where you are now i want you to hold it into your hearts the next time circumstance or situation or darkness or chaos or emptiness or void or great trial or great calamity is pressing in on you and you begin to feel a little bit of suffocated maybe a little bit of anxiety to the future might a panic attack moving on it's pressing on you then you just go ahead and read genesis 1 2 again the earth was without form and void darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the water and god said let there be light no matter what my void is no matter what my emptiness is god you move now let the spirit of god move again because back then in the beginning when you begin to create and bring me into existence i see a likeness of how i feel now he says you see you started back there is a seed and god worked down to where you are now and then you were all in christ then when christ died he died to redeem all of you and you are a part of this word and how can the bible all of its precepts upon precept line upon line here a little they're little not one jot or one tittle shall fail and you're part of that heaven and earth shall pass away but this word this word shall never pass away part of this in your hearts is we'll be going to prayer here just a moment but i want to read one more statement to you satan's eden he says then mate then made one of his attributes from his own body so god did he made one of his attributes from his own body god has attributes in his body like you are an attribute of your father you notice you were in your grandfather's grandfather's grandfathers but in that way in that say we'll take it down to like you and your father you didn't know anything when you were in your father the germ of life comes from the male the male has the blood cell the woman has the egg therefore the blood cell has the life in it and when you were in your father you actually didn't you know nothing about it yet science in god's word proves that you were in your father but you know nothing about it now the image is as we can say in the beginning of creation god began to create and bring you into existence you were somewhere already you just didn't know nothing about it he's saying this that god has attributes in his body he says like you were an attribute of your father and you were in your father before you ever gained expression here and he says but the father longed to know you and when the union of connection with mother then you made you were made to know your father you were made known to father you are your father's attributes you look like them you've got parts of your body that looks like your father and i'm pointing to my nose he said now that's the way god was in the beginning okay that's the way god was in the beginning well we know god wasn't like us unknown and but yet he's now says we were he's wanting us to see that we were god was that way in the beginning you were in him and he wanted to know you there had to be a way to bring you forth he says every son of god and every daughter of god was in god at the beginning you don't remember it now but you were there he knowed it he wanted you to become so he could contact you speak with you and love you and shake your hands don't forget that that god's love for you is immutable it cannot be changed it cannot be interrupted he wanted you to become so the becoming god the self-existent one who becomes the becoming god wanted you to become also so he could contact you speak with you and love you and shake your hands let's bow our heads if you desire prayer in your heart today if you have a need in your heart and you want to reach out to the lord you just want to maybe just by just showing that a a positive action maybe you want to stand your feet say lord i accept your word today it spoke to my heart lord this void i'm feeling this emptiness maybe you would lift up your hands before the lord now and say lord let the spirit of god move upon this broken vessel let the spirit of god move upon my broken heart my emptiness my discouragement my my sickness lord if then the beginning it was empty and void it says lord you created the heavens and the earth and the earth was empty chaotic and confusion and darkness lord then certainly i'm not at a loss or abandoned today because i'm confused and because i'm hurting no i'll just reach out to him say lord touch me he'll heal my body lord let the spirit of god move upon the deep of my my body let it move upon my mind in my heart my melancholy my anxiety whatever it might be lord i want to be grounded in your word lord that's the charge that i need let the spirit of god move upon the face of the waters let's pray our gracious heavenly father we desire that your holy spirit would just move upon the face of the waters lord it's my heart's crying feeling this burden this call lord take my family and move them to this valley i want your word to move upon the face of the waters move upon your people lord not just for this assembly but for our sister assemblies in the valley our sister assemblies in arizona our sister assemblies in kentucky and kansas and connecticut and florida lord in north carolina lord for the body of christ around the world lord we see the chaos the emptiness the void the cancers the strokes the trials the the fires lord the floods all the things that are trying to attack your body oh god let your word move upon the deep let it move upon the bride of jesus christ let it move in our personal life in our home life lord let it move father and lord may you bring forth something beautiful in your time father i commit the people to your desire that you touch them you strengthen them for your glory lord you alone are deserving of it it is you father that is that has taken these words and harnessed them and delivered them lord it is you that has pulled into the in the believer's heart to receive these things and let it be you father that waters let it be you father that brings forth fruit let it be you father that gets the glory we commit ourselves to you now father i pray your richest blessings upon the people we ask this in the name of the lord jesus christ amen
