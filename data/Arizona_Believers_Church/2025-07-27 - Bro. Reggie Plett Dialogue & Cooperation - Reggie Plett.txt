TRANSCRIPT
========================================
We'll start at verse 18. Come now and let us reason together, sayaeth the Lord. Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow. Though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool. If you be willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land. But if you refuse and rebel, you shall be devoured with the sword. For the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it. Amen. May God add his blessings to his word. You can be seated. This morning we have for a title dialogue and cooperation. And I love this painting. Um it's a painting by I I believe it's by Robert Zoo and it's called the road to Emmas. A good friend of mine has this hanging in his house. And I always love looking at this picture. I love to study it. And and uh we'll get into this story a little bit later. Um but I wanted to tell you 10:30. My son Luke, our six-year-old, was at a vacation Bible school. He went to several this year actually. We like to just visit all the different churches if they have vacation Bible schools so we can get free snacks and so forth. Um but he he was going in one of the vacation Bible schools that he went to. Um they were talking about the body of Christ and they were talking about the church body and the different the different members of the body and not not the different me they weren't talking about you just so you know. They weren't talking about the different members of this body. They were just talking about the different positions that are within a the framework of a church. And they were at the end they wanted the children uh to to to participate in a service and to to feel the part of of each of those roles. So they had uh uh visual and audio children, you know, three-year-olds on on cameras that are just filming the ground and, you know, and playing with the soundboards that weren't weren't hooked up, but they thought they were. and uh you know playing a keyboard with this again the sound off so there was no but they were just pounding on the keyboard and and uh they were looking for a preacher and someone to play the part of the preacher and and Luke got that part. Luke volunteered to to take that part. And uh so they had this service with all these children and his sermon lasted about 45 seconds and he had so many fans for that. I mean a 45se second sermon. So I' I'd love to I'd love to get the same accolades as Luke would. And I know you all would applaud it if if this could last 45 seconds. It'd be the greatest church service ever. We'll be a little bit longer than that, but I'll I'll try to get us out in a nice and timely manner. But I'm taking from online uh Marryiam Webster's dictionary. The word dialogue. Um Miam Webster says has several several definitions of this word dialogue. A written composition in which two or more characters are represented as conversing. A conversation between two or more persons. An exchange of ideas and opinions. A discussion between representatives of parties to a conflict that is aimed at resolution. The conversational element of literary or dramatic composition, a musical composition for two or more parts suggestive of a conversation. So this is Miriam Webster's definition of dialogue. Now cooperation much shorter. the actions of someone who is being helpful by doing what is wanted or asked for a common effort. Association of persons for common benefit. So that's what we're talking about today is dialogue and cooperation. And in my mind, I want you to know kind of my thought process behind this so that it's not so abstract as as it can be. Um, in my mind I'm I I'm thinking about ch children and and and the relationship between a parent and their children. Um, and it's only because this is this is just my life right now, you I mean, we have an 18-year-old and we have all the way down to a six-year-old and I have to know how to navigate as a parent uh to be able to communicate with older children and younger children. And I don't talk the same to the older ones as I do the younger ones. And so in my thought process, I'm thinking about this dialogue and cooperation as the thought process behind a parent communicating with their children. So keep that in your mind as we as we talk about this. And the other thought is only because we do this every week. We we we're always coming together in a body. And and and when I when I took the word dialogue, it was it was to kind of contrast the idea of a monologue. So a monologue is one person talking is what I'm doing right here. This this here is a monologue. It's me for the next 45 seconds just talking to you and and you have no there's no discussion here. It's just simply me discussing with you. And and many times I think we come to church and we think, well, I pray that the that the that the minister is inspired. I pray that God has somehow quickened something to that minister and how that it blesses his soul and perhaps I'll be able to glean a little bit and maybe I can follow his thought for a little while and maybe he'll say something that might relate to me that would be a benefit to me. And I think so many times uh we feel as as members of a body many times maybe we come to church and we feel like we got robbed. Maybe we feel like I didn't follow that at all. Maybe maybe you feel like you know what I'm just not I'm just I don't know what it is. My mind's not in it. My heart's not in it today. I don't know what it is. But that was a great monologue but it had nothing to do with me. And so we're going to talk about a dialogue, not a monologue, but a dialogue and cooperation. Now, this scripture that we read here in Isaiah chapter 1 has always stood out to me and I I can remember hearing Brother Brandon preach about this. But this idea that God says, "Come, let us reason together." And you think what an invitation &gt;&gt; that God is offering God Almighty who's omnipotent. He knows he he knows the way you ought to go. He knows He already knows the end from the beginning. But yet he's offering for you to come and reason with him concerning whatever matter you've got going on. &gt;&gt; Now you would think thinking as a parent now remember you know better. &gt;&gt; You've got your six-year-old, your four-year-old, your three-year-old, whatever it is, you know better than them. But they're coming to you with an issue. And is there going to be any dialogue at all? Or is it simply, look, I know what's best for you. Just do what I say and it's over. Discussion finished. &gt;&gt; And we do that. That's what we do. That you just do what I say and that's the end of the discussion and and everything will go along just fine. And it works great for the three-year-old. It works great all the way up until a certain point, especially once they hit teenage years. and they can begin to reason themselves and they want to have a dialogue with you and you think that tactic doesn't work so good anymore. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham takes this scripture and he preaches many sermons and one of the ones that I'm or the one that I'm drawing most of this context from is from Conference with God. Brother Brandon preaches conference with God, conferences with God, conferences, and he preaches and it's all the same sermon just with a little bit different titles, but he's using this scripture that come let us reason together. Though your sins be as scarlet, they'll be white as wool, be white as snow. &gt;&gt; And in this message conference with God, Brother Brandon begins talking about conferences and what is a conference and and why do they have conferences? And he talks about the different conferences they had. He talked about the Geneva convention. He talks about the big four, the the Paris conference, big big international conferences that our governments have had uh to have discussion with foreign parties. And that was part of our you could see that in some of those definitions that we read that if there's a conflict, it's that's what dialogue and cooperation is for is to bring ideas together and to talk them over. And in this message, Conference with God, Brother Brandham says, "What is conferences held for? What's the reason for these conferences?" There has got to be a reason or they wouldn't have those these conferences. They've got to come to a certain decision of what they're going to do. That's what a conference is for, is to make a decision. men in one place and other place and different minds and little things rise up here and something over here and back here. Then they've got to come together and hold a conference and then make a decision what they're going to do about it. And that's why they're held. He says, and then another thought I want you to get is this. In a conference that they never have a conference unless there's a crucial need, it's at a strenuous time when conferences is held. And so again, if you're thinking about a parent and and children or or as children maybe as children thinking about their these conferences they've had to have with their parents at home, something's going on. There's something happening. There's ruckus going on. There's there's a fuss happening in the house. And dad says, "Okay, everybody get together. You two come here. Let's talk. And here we go. Time for a conference. It's at a strenuous time and everybody's thinking about these times in your house. You're thinking about these conferences. Maybe it's a husband and a wife. Okay, we got to talk. There's a conference happening. But when I think about a church setting, when I think about us coming to church, a lot of times that's exactly what we're doing. When we walk through that door on Sunday morning or Wednesday night, we're asking God, "Okay, Lord, we need to have a conference. &gt;&gt; We got to talk. &gt;&gt; I need I need some answers. I need a solution. &gt;&gt; I We need answers here. We need a fix. I've got something happening in my life and I need an answer. &gt;&gt; And many times you think, "No, no, no, no, no. You're just whistling by the graveyard. No, no, no. Everything's going to be fine. Everything's going to be fine. And how are you, brother? Oh, just fine." And your life's just falling apart behind that smile on your face. And God is the one that's calling you. &gt;&gt; We need to have a conference. We need to talk. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham starts here. He says, "And then God has held some great conferences. There come a time in God's great economy where there had to be a conference held. And the first one that I can call of for this earth was in the Garden of Eden. He takes us right back to Genesis when the angels of God came home weeping, saying, "Your child has fallen. He sinned and he's broken your commandments." Something had to be done. The creature of God had fallen from grace and was subject unto eternal separation from the presence of his God and his maker. It was a crucial moment for the king of heaven had said, "The day you eat thereof, that day you die." And putting his trust into his son, his son had broke his commandment. There had to be something done. It was his creation. It was the work of his own hand. It was the love of his heart, the apple of his eye. Something must be done. So, there had to be a conference called. God selected a certain tree in the Garden of Eden. And after he had thrown out old bloody sheep skins into behind the bushes, he called Adam and Eve. And there he made a conference, talked over and made a remedy for this horrible thing that his children had done, God's conference. Now, I pause because I'd like for each of you to imagine what that was like. When Brother Random reads that, it paints a picture in your head, and it's a beautiful picture. I mean, he's just given us a short description, but how long did that last? How long were they hiding? How long did it take them to make that fig leaf apron? How long did they sit in shame wondering what's it going to be? What's going to happen? But what a picture. And I'd like to read the scriptures because in with each of us, this is where we draw from. This is the source we draw from. And so this this is where brother Brandham is drawing this picture from. In Genesis 3, I'm going to read verses 8-11 and then jump over to 21. Says, "And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day. And Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden. And the Lord God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou?" And he said, "I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself." And he said, "Who told thee that thou was naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?" Then it says, "Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins and he clothed them." So here, just through the reading of the scripture, we see exactly the words that were given to Moses, but but painted out for us by brother Brandham in such a beautiful picture. And I think about Yeah, that's about right. And and and honestly, Brother Brandham goes on with several many different stories in this message, conferences about conferences, different conferences that God had throughout the Bible. And as brother Brandham's preaching this and talking about the examples that he's given, my mind is just spilling over with other characters in the Bible. One of my favorite is the story of Job because I feel it's so real. It's so human. It it so touches each of us that Job would be willing and able to talk with God and almost as God is asking, inviting us to do here in Isaiah, come, let's reason it out. &gt;&gt; If you've got a problem, bring it up. Let's hear it. &gt;&gt; And and and and Job does Job's not afraid to talk to God and say to God, you know, why why do you bother with me? I'm a miserable human being. Why do you even Why do you torture me with coming back and giving me another chance and another chance? I I'm I'm human. I fail and I can't help but fail. And why do you bother? Why do you keep this up? And and God's letting him go. Just let him spill it out. Just let him cry out to God and and and and and tell God, you know, how this this thing, it just it's like I don't just fail you once. You know, you would think that I have would have this thing nailed down. &gt;&gt; And God's like, "Yeah, go ahead, Job. Get it all out now. Get it all out." &gt;&gt; And when he gets done, God's like, "Now it's my turn. And it's a dialogue that's going on between God and Job. &gt;&gt; And it's so real because if you'll read it when especially when you find yourself in these kinds of situations, suddenly you don't feel alone. You don't feel like, "Am I the only one that has these thoughts? Am I the only one that that has this happen in their life? Am I just a miserable believer? Am I just Am I &gt;&gt; Why do they keep letting me back in the church? &gt;&gt; God's like, "Yeah, good. Good. &gt;&gt; Get Get all that out because I've got answers for you. &gt;&gt; I have a remedy." But you get it out. You need to do that. You need to get it out. So many stories like that. &gt;&gt; I think about my kids and think about at home. You have things that come up and and as a parent, you're like, "Okay, got this thing under control. Come, let's talk. Dad's got answers." All this wisdom that I've accumulated through the years and then it turns into a monologue. it just turns into your children staring at you while you're just unfolding all of this wisdom. You know, well, this is, you know, son, if daughter, if you would just go this direction and if this would happen, this is what I would do. And in that case, I would contact somebody I know. And and they're like, they're like, where's the dialogue in this? Well, if you would just cooperate, you know, this is the cooperation part is you cooperating with me. you just I tell you what to do and then you do it and then it's settled. And I think many times our kids are like, "Yeah, we need to have a discussion, but when's it your turn to be quiet and listen and let me talk?" And when we read these scriptures, I want you to know that that's what God is offering. Is you want to talk? Is there something that you have to say? &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, you don't want to hear me say it, God. You don't want to hear me say it cuz it's stuff I'm going to say." He's like, "Say it. Say on." He's a big God. And he's trying to show us how to be like him. He's trying to show us the great plan, this great plan, this harmony that he desired to have from the beginning. &gt;&gt; Yes, it was interrupted. God was like, "Even though it was interrupted, I want you to know that we can still have that amidst the interruption." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And the world, they they're like, they're like, "What, you know, what do you do? What do you do in that situation?" You know, they they're trying to figure it out. So then they're going, "I need is there a medication I can take? Is there, you know, like how much do I have to drink to get to a state to where and and and as somebody who recognizes that there is a God &gt;&gt; and then when you get introduced to that God and you know he's not a a out in the ether, he's a person &gt;&gt; and that that that person became man. And he was tempted in every manner as we are tempted. And he wants you to know that that what you're feeling. I know that feeling &gt;&gt; that that this this this whatever this interrupt, this whatever it is, anxiety, this issue that you've got, I know it. &gt;&gt; I want you to know I know it. So go ahead. You can give it to me. talk. So, I want to jump over now to this story of the road to Emmas. It's in Luke chapter 24. And I'm just going to read some of the scriptures. I want to jump over it. I would encourage you when you have your at your own time or if you want to stop listening to me and just read your Bible, that's fine. But I'm just going to jump through the story. It says starting at verse 13 of Luke chapter 24. And behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmas, which was from Jerusalem about three score furongs. And they talked together of all these things which had happened. Now all these things that which had happened was the death, the burial, and the resurrection of Jesus or the rumored resurrection at this at this moment. Now, it it it it had happened, but all they knew was just the rumor of it. And they're talking about that. So, we have two people having a dialogue on the road. They're walking together and they're discussing they're discussing the matter at hand. They're having a dialogue and and one of them is is talking about and and no and both of them are are sad and and we'll read that Jesus is Jesus asks them, "Why are you so sad with your communications?" They're sad. They they they they haven't understood that this was supposed to happen. They just know what happened. And it's breaking their hearts that this Jesus they thought they that they knew was the Messiah. That they knew he was he was that fulfillment. They thought this he wasn't maybe wasn't supposed to die. They thought the kingdom would be ushered in that this would now just bring in the millennium and so on and so forth. And they were getting ahead of you know they were just misinterpreting scripture and and and they just couldn't wrap their minds around this. But they're having a dialogue together. They're both talking about it. And that's us that's us with our friends. That's us with our spouses. That's us with our our fellow uh believers calling each other throughout the week that you know how's it going? Well, you just won't believe what just happened. You know, the car won't start and then the water heater went out and then you're not going to believe this, but I've got a cousin and this one's in the hospital and and and you're just spilling it. You're just spilling it. My life is falling apart. And and you know, we just had a fight. we just had a fight and I don't know what's going on and and you know and all the issues. They're having a dialogue and they're discussing this matter of Jesus. Verse 15. And it came to pass that while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near and went with them. &gt;&gt; Man, thank God for that. &gt;&gt; That's what this is all about. That's what this is all about. Is that when we've got things happening in our life that is too big for us, that's past our understanding, if Jesus can come along, &gt;&gt; it's amazing how things work out. &gt;&gt; So, while they're talking about this, Jesus himself draws near. But their eyes were holden that they should not know him. And he said unto them, "What manner of communications are these that you have one to another as you walk and are sad?" Now Jesus is asking to be a part of this dialogue. Now he wants cooperation. Can you share with me? Can can can would you be willing to tell me what you all were talking about with each other? Would you let me into your conversation? Strange man, stranger comes up on the road. Would you be willing to share with me? You I can see you some you guys are bothered with something. Do you mind sharing with me what's going on? They they said, "Do you not know what just happened in Jerusale?" "No. What just happened about Jesus of what Jesus? Tell me all about Jesus." And they're like, "Well, this is what we thought was going to happen." and they start spilling it to him. And then while they're telling this to him, instead of like, "Oh, I'm so sorry." He says, "Oh, you fools slow of heart. You don't even do you not know what the prophets said." Now, right then, they could have chosen that cooperation has now ended. You call me a fool. So far, and you don't even know who Jesus is. We're telling you what just happened. You don't even know who he is, and you're going to tell us we're fools. I don't know where you're going, but you know, this road's wide enough that you can go to the other side if you'd like. We'll be over here talking about our issues. Thank you. They didn't do that. &gt;&gt; They didn't do that. They c they were cooperating. They he says, "You you you fools, you slow of heart. Do you not know?" And then it says, "And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself." So now he's taking their problems and he's saying, "All right, now let's go through the scriptures and let's through cooperation and dialogue, let me show you that this was all in God's plan, &gt;&gt; that this God's got this under control, &gt;&gt; that God planned this all along." And while he's talking with them, verse 32, and they said one to another, after they get done, after he opens their eyes and they see, ah, it's Jesus, and this was supposed to happen, this is fulfillment of prophecies. And while they're their eyes are being opened to that and he's breaking bread and revealing who he is to them, he's doing something to them, showing them in a way that they knew him intimately that they know that's him. That's him. He's alive. Jesus. In fact, the rumor of his resurrection is true. I know it to be true. I've seen it. It says, "And they said one to another, did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us by the way and while he opened to us the scriptures." This is the purpose of dialogue. This is the purpose of cooperation. &gt;&gt; This is what we all desire when we come to church. &gt;&gt; This is what we and when we walk through those doors, we say, "God, please talk to me this morning. God, I'm coming to hear from you. Not to hear from some preacher, not to hear but God speak through him somehow. God, maybe through a song touch my heart. Maybe through a a a fellowship afterwards talking with a brother and sister something could be settled in my life. &gt;&gt; And and then this is why we come. That's the purpose. And we think but you know but it's only one way. It's just one way. It's just a preacher and he's up there. It's a monologue. And and and where's my part in this? and and and please catch this when I say this because this is how I really feel &gt;&gt; that I'm so grateful that in this day that we live, God sent a prophet with a gift to show us that Jesus Christ is indeed alive. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. say everybody knew that. All the Christians knew that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But &gt;&gt; we have the privilege. We have the privilege to have even recorded these messages that when people are coming to services like we've been coming to for generations coming to church, sitting through a church service, listening to a a preacher give his uh version or or or or you know his painting of a story within the Bible and oh that was really good. Oh, I never thought of it that way. That was really unique. I'll tell you that was really neat, brother. Thank you. And then and then you leave and you're like, "Okay, now I got to go home and face the issue." &gt;&gt; That was really great for Sunday. Uh but I know what's coming Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. &gt;&gt; For generations, that happened. And then we have this opportunity that God shows us by his grace &gt;&gt; that Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the New Testament. &gt;&gt; And that he's not just a God of history. He's still alive. and that this baptism of the Holy Ghost was not just for the 12 on the day of Pentecost, but that baptism has happened in every age. That it was for whosoever will. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandis is is preaching these things and we're like, "What?" You know, we're going this, you know, re is okay, we've heard that before, really? And he's and then at the end of the services, brother Brandon would would would say, "Now, if he would come and show the things that I've been saying to be real, would you believe him?" &gt;&gt; Because the angel told him, "If you could get the people to believe you, &gt;&gt; nothing would stand before your prayer, not even cancer." &gt;&gt; So, he's preaching the word of God. He's preaching the truth right out of this this word. and and it's like that's true that's true but lots of men were doing that that that you know that and and thank God for that but then something different something now if he is alive and if he is real perhaps he would show himself here today &gt;&gt; and that kind of perks everybody ears up like what do you And I'm going to say this now. I don't want to say it later because I'll forget. I am that age. That for the for years it seemed like it was just monologue, monologue, monologue, monologue, monologue, monologue every week. Monologue. We go to church, tradition, tradition, tradition to hear the monologue, monologue, monologue, monologue. Where's the dialogue in all of this? Where's my part, God? How do I know you hear me? I've been praying. And so I want to read a couple examples because every time I hear these, every time I read these, I just think, "Thank you, Jesus." &gt;&gt; To allow people to realize this is not just a one-way street here, that you've got a part into this. And God is very interested in it. He's he's interested in you down to the detail. &gt;&gt; And here's the proof of it. So this is after brother Brandham's preaching. This is I'm I've only taken two. There's so many. I wanted to bring so many, but I want to read these with you. This is from the message testimony. This is after the service. Now, Brother Brandham's called a prayer line. You believe, lady? All right. Let's you and I just talk a moment then. If you're a believer, I believe that is truth. You have a wonderful atmosphere, but you're suffering. You have you've had your trouble is bad enough to you as just you've been to a doctor. And I see him doing something riding on a Oh, it's a heart trouble. You have heart trouble, don't you? And he had something around your arm. It's a blood pressure and it's very seriously about 300. Is that right? I see him shake his head and walk away. He thinks you're going to have a stroke at any time. That's what he said to you. See now, who was in the room there to hear him say that and come back and let me see it right here before me now. Jesus Christ. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Then he's interested in you, isn't he? &gt;&gt; You believe you'll never have a stroke now, will you? God bless her now. May her faith be confirmed in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Go believing with all your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now suddenly we are hyper aware that God knows our problems. &gt;&gt; That God knows what's wrong with us. And now the prayer that you've been praying, the prayer we've been praying that seems to maybe have been a silent prayer that it was just a one-way, it was God, where's the cooperation in this? I'm coming to you. I've got an I've got a an issue. I have an effect. I have something that that that I need. But how do I know? Now, we're getting a glimpse into, oh, God knows and he cares. He's very concerned and he's he can see right into the room where you're at. He can see the doctor. He can he's seen all of that. He's very aware of your condition and he's concerned and he desires that you would have healing, that you would have peace, that you would have joy, that you would be saved. He's very concerned. &gt;&gt; Here's another one. This is from Thirsting for Life in 1957. Now, if the audience can still hear my voice, the woman seems to be getting smaller. There's like a shadow between her and I stands a light. The woman's suffering. Yes, sir. She's very sick. She has many things wrong with her. The woman has something wrong in her bowels. It's colitis. I believe the doctor diagnoses that as colitis. Kind of a thin fellow. the doctor. He said it's colitis. And then I see something about looking at the bottom of the feet. You've got fallen arches, too, that bothers you. That's true. Then you've got some sort of a bleeding hemorrhage in your blood. That's the truth. And I see you drop a dish going from a room. You're real nervous, upset, and you have real gloomy spells kind of late in the evening when the sun's going down and kind of getting kind of a melancholy feeling, kind of strange feeling. I see you sitting on the chair looking out, watching the sun through the window. You have a real funny feeling. That's true. I'm not reading your mind. And here's another thing. I hear you in a room praying. It's beside of a bed and you're asking God to give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost. You're seeking for God. That's thus sayeth the Lord. Is that true or false? Is every bit of it true? You believe God now? Would you say that to the audience? You see that? Now, in between here, just so you know, there is responses. You can hear the lady. That's true. Yes. even to the doctor's description. That's true. And God in heaven knows I know nothing about the woman. What is it? It's Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; And I want to say this to you, my sister. The dark shadow that hung over you when you come here has gone from you. You're healed. Go on your road rejoicing and thank God. Amen. And I just grabbed those two. There was so many that I wanted to grab. Brother Brandham describing the doctor, what he looked like, things that they said, things that nobody would know. There only two of them in the room. But God God saw it. God heard it. God recorded it. And God showed it. And I say all of that because it shows me and I want my children to know this. I this is this is what I want is I want my children to grow up knowing this that when we go to church it's not out of just tradition. &gt;&gt; Although you know brother Brandham said we should honor the resurrection. That's why we come together and we meet together on Sunday. But not to not to just well that's just what we do Sunday morning and and and it's fine and there's and there's so many benefits to that. But that God isn't just wanting to hammer this down my children's throat and just get it in there and just fit it in and through osmosis it's going to really make you a believer. &gt;&gt; But that God wants a dialogue with my children. that &gt;&gt; that when they've seen, you know, they come to dad for some advice and and sometimes dad's got some good advice, then other times, ah, not really. But when when dad when dad's wrong, when dad's off, when mom is mom's the same. We'll just say that. I I know that. I'm I know that's dangerous to say that, but sometimes it happens. They can go to God &gt;&gt; and I want them to go to him first and I want them to go in the midst &gt;&gt; and then I want them to go at the end. &gt;&gt; I don't want it to be a one-time thing. I want it that that that that through all of it that, you know, well, dad gave me good advice, but I'm still going to God. I still want to go to God in this. I would say yes, children, please. Please, let's get God involved in this in all things. &gt;&gt; And I want them to to experience though it would seem though it would seem like when we go to church, the preacher, he preaches and it and it's a good thing, but where's my part in it? Here's your part. is that the things that you have need of, your desires, things that you've got going on in your life are just as important as the things that are going on in mom and dad's life. &gt;&gt; They're just as important. &gt;&gt; And I want you to I I want our children to know that that the things that are going on in your life, they're very real and they're very important. And that God knows that it's important. And and when you hear something like this, I want you to know that God knows it, &gt;&gt; that God's concerned about it, and that when you come in to a church, when you come into a service, when you're when you're meeting with believers, and and in the midst of it, you're desiring something from God. Brother Brandham when when he would when he would be preaching and when he would uh be fixing to to maybe start a prayer line, he he was he was asking, you know, and and many times the discernment would happen. He would say, "Now now that's not me that's doing that. That's you operating the gift. &gt;&gt; It's your faith pulling the gift. It's you doing that &gt;&gt; and you think what me really brother Brandon is letting you know yes your faith in God if you'll just and and he would say this many times now he would start the service now those of you that have a need you hold that while I'm preaching you hold that before God and you see if God don't answer that &gt;&gt; so through the whole service. They've got something going on in their heart. They've come for a reason. They've come to those meetings for a reason. And it's to get it's to get something fixed. It's a conference with God. They're coming there to have a conference with God because there's an issue. They need to reason it out with God. And then they need a solution. They need to come to a solution by the end. And brother Brandham's saying, "Now you just hold faith. You hold faith. You Now, I'm going to show you in the word. I'm going to back it up. I'm going to build a strong foundation with the word so that you can feel safe. You can feel comfortable to know that it's in God's word. That it's not just it's not just me saying it, but that go it's it's in God's pattern. He's he's been faithful. If he's done it once, he'll do it again because that's how he is. He he would he wouldn't be God if he could if he was changing his mind all the time if he does it once. And he said and and if if if he saved one man based on faith, he's got to save the next one based on faith. &gt;&gt; If he heals one because of their faith, then he's got to heal the next one based on faith. &gt;&gt; That it's by faith. And he's telling and and you're listening to these sermons and you're going, "Okay, then then Lord, increase my faith. &gt;&gt; Do you know do I number one, do I have faith?" And brother Brandon was trying to show you you've got faith. Just like faith the seed of a a grain of mustard seed will move mountains for you. And you've got faith. If you can start if you're going out and you think your car is going to start and it starts, you you just That's faith. You got faith in your car, it's going to start up. That's the same kind of faith he says. And many times, brother Brandham says, "What? Why? Why did God ask uh the children of Israel to apply the blood with hissip? It was a common weed to show you that it's common faith. It's just common faith. That's your part into it. &gt;&gt; Believe it or not, we're closing. 45 more seconds. Brother Random says this in this message, Conference with God. And actually, I'll ask the musicians if they'll come. That's how serious I am. I'd like to sing Brother Micah. He knows my name. But I want to read this quote for you from again, Conference with God. And again, I would recommend go listen listen to these sermons. You'll be blessed. You know that. Brother Brandham says, "Maybe you don't know what to do. Maybe you're a sinner and have done so much sin. Maybe you smoked till you can't smoke no more and can't quit it. Maybe you've drank till you can't drink no more and you can't quit it. Maybe you've come to a place where you so full of sin and lust till you have to look upon every woman you see wrong. Or maybe you've even perverted your own natural resources. Maybe you've come to a block. I don't care where you're at. God is still ready to come to you in a conference and talk it over with you. Maybe you broke up your home. Maybe you've left your husband or left your wife. Maybe you run off from your children. There might be many things in this life that the enemy has trapped you into. But remember, my brother, sister, you still have the rights to have a conference with God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Talk it over with him. He's a very present help in the time of trouble. Amen. &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother, that is so extreme. We're way beyond that. I've been saved for far too long. I don't have any of those issues in my life." Praise God. But I'll guarantee you've got some issues. And God is inviting us to have a conference with him. [Music] I wanted to throw this in there and I didn't I felt like I had too much as it was Brandon so many times I say so many times I know more than once he he said I'm like a child and he said trying to put my arm in a jacket and he said you just they just can't do it. If you've ever had a little child and get your jacket on, you know, it starts when they're baby. Get your jacket on. You know, they're just their little limp arm is just going every direction and you're like, put it in the the sleeve just, you know, and they're they're going doing the circle thing cuz they can't get the arm in the and you're like, why are what's the circle going to do for you? You know, you're going to catch your jacket. Brandon said, "I need God to help guide my arm and put it in the sleeve." &gt;&gt; He's so gracious in giving us things like that that I It doesn't matter how old you are, how young you are. Brother Brandham's saying, "I myself need God to guide my arm to put it in the jacket. that if God just left it up to you, just, you know, you know what to do. Fix your problems. Just fix your problems. Where would we be? But God's invited us. He's invited us every service. more than every service. You all know this. He invites us every day. He invites us in our homes privately. Let's talk. Let's have a talk. Bring your problem to me. And many times we just pray like, "God, what I need is the wisdom of Solomon. Just give me wisdom how to navigate through this issue." And God can give you wisdom. Many times it's just God, I need a miracle. That's where I'm at. I've exhausted all of my resources. There's nobody else for me to call on that I can think of. It's going to need to be you, God. And he shows up. [Music] This is not a monologue. I want you to take encouragement knowing that when we come together like this, it's very much a dialogue. And I hope that those just those examples that I showed you is that when you're holding before God something and you're praying to God and saying, "God, do you hear me?" He wants you to know, "I hear you." Now we I don't have that gift. You know, we don't have that gift operating to let you know specifically. But you got to see through that that he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Then he's still a discerner of our thoughts and the intents of our hearts. He still can discern that and that he knows. And that where you're sitting in your seat every time when you come here, you're sitting in your seat and you're praying before God saying, "God, you know where I'm at. You know the condition I've got." Or perhaps you're praying for somebody else. Lord, you know them. They're not here, but you know God, if I could intercede for them, I would do it. And God can answer that. &gt;&gt; God knows that. [Music] Just this come let us reason together. Though your skin sins would be as scarlet, they could be white as wool. Just that scripture there allows me to say, "Thank you, God. Forgive your stupid servant for having to go over this again, Lord, but we need to go over it again." And he says, "All right, let's let's go over it again. Let's pray together. Let's stand with me if you would. [Music] Precious heavenly father, Lord, thank you for your word. God, I thank you not only for this written word, but God, the very breath that you breathe out, Lord, and the word that was spoken, the word that was written, and Lord, the word that has made itself life, it's made itself real. God, if we were to go around, how as the scripture and the disciples declared, we couldn't even pin down half the things that God has we've seen God do. Lord, that's true. You've showed up in our lives again and again and again. Lord, for those that don't know that, that don't know you to be that God, I pray that you would reveal yourself, God, to each one as a personal God. That you're not just out in the ether, but you're a person who knows, Lord, you're you're touched by the feeling of our infirmities. That Lord, you care for us. You care for the problems that we have. You care, Lord, for even the the victories we have. Lord, you're very very aware of it and you you're you you rejoice with us when we're rejoicing. We thank you for that. We thank you for being a good father. We thank you, Lord, for being the right kind of a parent. We thank you, God, for each of us as children, Lord. So some of some may be younger, some may be older, but God, we recognize that you're a proper parent. And Lord, we as parents desire to Lord, to be a parent like you are. And God, that we as children, Lord, we desire to to to to find cooperation with you, Lord, and to learn of you and and to know when it's our place to sit at your feet and to learn of you. Lord, we thank you for affording us an opportunity to pour out our needs to you, Lord, to express our hearts honestly before you. And that God, you don't condemn us over that, Lord. You guide us through it. Lord, you take those nail scarred hands. Even when we need chastisement, it's always with nail scarred hands. We thank you for that, Lord. I pray God that as each of us goes our way Lord as each of us goes to our respective homes that you'd bless each and every home here represented with your presence. That God you would hear our prayers and that God you would even help us to pray properly. That God we would be like the child who would pray our alphabet just to say God you form the words. I don't even know what to say. Lord, we love you. We want to tell you we love you. We thank you for knowing us. We thank you for hearing us. And we thank you, God, for making yourself known to us in this day. We ask all these favors and give you thanks in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
