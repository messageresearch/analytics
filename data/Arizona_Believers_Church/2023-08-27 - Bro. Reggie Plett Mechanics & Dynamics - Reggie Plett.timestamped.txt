[0:00] but I want to read uh the first nine
[0:02] verses of Proverbs chapter 8.
[0:07] doth not wisdom cry and understanding
[0:10] put forth her voice
[0:13] she standeth in the top of high places
[0:16] by the way in the places of the paths
[0:20] she crieth at the gates at the entry of
[0:24] the city
[0:25] at the coming in at the doors
[0:29] now this is her crying this is this is
[0:32] uh wisdom and understanding these are
[0:35] the words she's crying in these next
[0:37] verses unto you o men I call
[0:41] and my voice is to the sons of man
[0:44] oh ye simple understand wisdom and he
[0:49] fools be of an understanding heart
[0:56] think the Lord even speaks to the fools
[1:01] here for I will speak of excellent
[1:04] things and the opening of my lips shall
[1:07] be right things for my mouth shall speak
[1:10] truth and wickedness is an Abomination
[1:13] to my lips
[1:16] all the words of my mouth are in
[1:18] righteousness there is nothing forward
[1:21] or perverse in them
[1:23] they are all plain to him that
[1:26] understandeth and write to them that
[1:29] find knowledge
[1:31] amen would you pray with me one more
[1:33] time our precious Heavenly Father Lord
[1:38] feels so good Lord to be in this place
[1:42] Lord this building that we have
[1:43] consecrated that has been set aside for
[1:46] the service
[1:47] of the Lord and Lord
[1:52] as we've come in and we've worshiped you
[1:55] Lord we've sung our praises to you
[1:58] we ask that God you've you've felt
[2:01] invited
[2:03] that you feel Lord that you hold the
[2:05] preeminence in this place that each one
[2:07] here has come with a desire Lord to look
[2:10] to you and to receive from you and God
[2:13] we want to give you the high place
[2:16] Lord this day
[2:18] we would ask that God you would as these
[2:20] words would be spoken that God your Holy
[2:24] Spirit would move through this building
[2:26] Lord it would Quicken the minds of your
[2:29] people that as they begin to think on
[2:31] the word of God a God you would draw
[2:34] close and your spirit God would begin to
[2:37] minister to the desires of their heart
[2:39] the Lord you would Minister to the needs
[2:42] that they have God pressing needs in
[2:44] their lives
[2:45] that God when that our faith could reach
[2:48] out
[2:49] and grab a hold of the Supernatural and
[2:52] bring it into our bosom and say that was
[2:54] for me
[2:55] that God it would change our lives
[2:57] forever in a greater way
[3:00] the Lord we would become closer to you
[3:03] and that we would recognize that God
[3:05] your desire is always to be closer to us
[3:10] we commit ourselves Lord we consecrate
[3:12] ourselves we turn our attention fully to
[3:15] you this morning and we ask now that you
[3:17] would have your way in this service be
[3:19] with our pastor Lord those that are
[3:21] traveling those that are not here that
[3:22] wish they could be here I pray you'd
[3:24] minister to them where they are we ask
[3:26] these things in Jesus Christ's name amen
[3:29] and God bless you you can be seated
[3:32] this morning my title is mechanics
[3:36] and Dynamics
[3:38] and
[3:39] I picked this uh slider I put this slide
[3:42] together
[3:43] because this top picture is just a
[3:47] rendering it's some artists rendering of
[3:50] an atom
[3:52] it's very crude rendering on each of
[3:55] those spirals that would be gathered
[3:56] going around that little Center ball
[3:59] there's actually other little balls
[4:02] cycling around that ball and those are
[4:04] protons and
[4:05] as brother Eli was ministering Wednesday
[4:08] night about some of these things I
[4:10] thought boy best of luck to you to
[4:12] explain some of that because
[4:15] I I I I felt like I was right with him I
[4:18] was like I I don't know I'm no physicist
[4:21] I'm I'm no scientist
[4:23] but
[4:25] there's there is a principle and the
[4:27] scientists can grab the mechanics of
[4:30] something and they love that
[4:33] they love the mechanics of an atom and
[4:36] and the build up of an atom
[4:40] but the bottom picture is the result of
[4:44] an atom being split
[4:47] now this if if I did not if I couldn't
[4:50] explain to you atoms when they split
[4:54] they create an explosion or they create
[4:57] an implosion which then creates an
[5:00] explosion when you when you put some
[5:01] other things with it and you say well I
[5:04] have no idea what you're talking about
[5:05] don't give me the science of how that
[5:07] works and I just
[5:11] detonate a bomb you go I got it
[5:15] I get it
[5:18] and
[5:25] statistics have shown
[5:28] and this is statistics which again is
[5:30] really very mechanical and boring to me
[5:34] um
[5:37] but it's statistics that show that men
[5:39] and women are more alike than they are
[5:42] different
[5:43] we are more alike than we are different
[5:45] however
[5:47] at the far ends of the spectrums the
[5:50] differences
[5:51] are very big
[5:55] and in other words
[5:57] it was described in one way like this
[6:00] when just given free choice for uh life
[6:05] uh for for for a job for an occupation
[6:10] when when not pressed upon when not
[6:13] leaded LED in any direction as a child
[6:16] not not groomed as a child to go a
[6:19] certain way in life like in for instance
[6:22] some of the fathers are saying you know
[6:25] you know my son I want him to become a
[6:28] great athlete
[6:30] I want my son to be a great athlete and
[6:33] so they put posters up in his room
[6:36] of athletes and sports and they buy all
[6:39] the sports equipment for him and they
[6:41] stick it in his room and he's just
[6:43] crawling and the mom is like what are
[6:45] you doing he's like my boy you know my
[6:48] boy's gonna he's gonna be a pro athlete
[6:50] and like we don't even know if he's
[6:52] going to be able to talk you know
[6:57] but fathers will then you know son well
[6:59] son what are you doing you know what are
[7:01] you doing with your free time let's get
[7:03] outside let's throw the ball let's let's
[7:04] hit hit the ball let's whatever it is
[7:07] whatever ball or whatever sport it is
[7:09] that you're doing you're training your
[7:10] child to become the pro athlete for
[7:13] let's get on the ice
[7:14] for the Canadians out there
[7:19] if if you didn't groom them to go a
[7:22] certain direction to become an engineer
[7:24] to become a doctor if you just left
[7:26] human beings alone to free choice
[7:28] without giving them in any direction
[7:31] statistics show
[7:34] that males
[7:36] that
[7:38] the vast majority of males
[7:41] will tend to go towards
[7:44] the stem fields
[7:47] which is like engineering and building
[7:50] and
[7:53] I don't know science
[7:55] things like that and women tend to go
[7:59] into
[8:00] Social Services
[8:02] Health Care Nursing those type of
[8:06] professions and they say statistically
[8:09] that is because men are geared toward
[8:13] liking things
[8:15] while women are geared to liking people
[8:21] now again those are just statistics
[8:24] there are men who care more about people
[8:27] than things and they're women who care
[8:28] more about things than people
[8:31] and all the men are going Amen brother
[8:34] and the sisters are going Amen brother
[8:36] and you know exactly what the other
[8:39] person your significant other that's
[8:41] sitting next to you no you know exactly
[8:43] which way they lean
[8:45] if you spent enough time
[8:48] Mike and Maddie you'll figure it out
[8:52] these next four slides if we go through
[8:54] these next four slides slowly is to
[8:56] evoke an emotion
[8:59] from from some of you
[9:01] so if you could just hit the next slide
[9:03] Brother John
[9:07] and then the next one
[9:11] and then the next one
[9:15] and then the next one
[9:18] now some of you
[9:21] you're you're
[9:22] what is the what's the chemical that's
[9:25] being dopamine your dopamine is just on
[9:28] fire right now I can start preaching
[9:30] right now and and I'm going to get more
[9:32] amens but these next four slides
[9:39] and the next one
[9:42] and the next one
[9:46] and the next one
[9:49] now
[9:52] the men that are looking at this are
[9:53] like uh
[9:55] but the women who are sitting here
[9:58] the women that sounds terrible excuse me
[10:00] you for the sisters who are sitting
[10:02] there looking at this
[10:04] they're going yeah that's my man
[10:08] and they you know they're looking in the
[10:11] bank accounts sitting okay
[10:13] they're like thank you
[10:18] and what we have here is we have
[10:19] mechanics and we have Dynamics
[10:22] and the men who like the things care
[10:25] about the mechanical parts of this thing
[10:27] and they're going sweetheart look at
[10:29] this new drill I got sweetheart look at
[10:30] this new saw I got isn't this exciting
[10:33] and she's like can you build me
[10:38] this thing
[10:40] she doesn't care about the thing
[10:42] she cares about you doing
[10:47] the thing
[10:50] and and and you want her to appreciate
[10:52] the thing but she only appreciates
[10:56] that you got her thing done
[11:00] that's terrible isn't it sisters
[11:06] and so
[11:09] when we were looking at mechanics and
[11:11] Dynamics
[11:13] we're all geared a different way now I'm
[11:15] going to give you a little bit of
[11:16] History my background is Dutch
[11:20] and Irish
[11:23] and probably some German and maybe
[11:25] English I'm a real Heinz 57 and Canadian
[11:31] and now all of the stereotypical things
[11:34] that you'd like to say about each of
[11:36] those races are running through your
[11:39] head
[11:40] Irish
[11:42] um
[11:44] Dutch mm-hmm
[11:49] and as each of us then now
[11:51] introspectively begins looking at our
[11:54] culture
[11:55] looking at our past
[11:57] you begin thinking about well what is
[11:59] your background
[12:01] and what is it that they say about
[12:04] your culture
[12:05] and you go uh-huh
[12:08] um
[12:09] and You Begin thinking about these
[12:11] things
[12:13] we have tendencies
[12:16] to do certain things and to act certain
[12:19] ways it's just inherent in us when we're
[12:22] born it's just who we are it's so what
[12:24] we do and then we like to place it upon
[12:27] our backgrounds and that's that's okay
[12:29] there's nothing wrong with that we even
[12:31] hear brother Brandon I'm talking about
[12:33] that that my people they were Irish and
[12:36] and and my mother was Native American
[12:38] and he I was I had a temper to fight a
[12:41] buzz saw as a as a child and you know I
[12:43] went to those kids and you know I was
[12:46] gonna shoot every one of them I had
[12:48] intentions to shoot everyone and the gun
[12:50] went click click click click click click
[12:52] click you're like what
[13:00] some of you were are absolutely foreign
[13:03] to that that I have no there is no
[13:06] tendency in me to ever when somebody
[13:08] Rises up against me I shy away
[13:12] I would never go after somebody with a
[13:14] gun
[13:16] and some of
[13:18] us
[13:20] are going oh exactly you know exactly
[13:23] that's exactly what I would have done
[13:26] it's the way we're built
[13:28] it's our mechanics it's the way we're
[13:30] built up and then the Dynamics that
[13:32] works within us
[13:38] say great thanks for this lesson this
[13:40] morning
[13:43] where does this apply in the word of God
[13:47] I think it applies in our entire lives
[13:49] and it applies Within
[13:51] and and I always go I always go in and I
[13:54] go out and I and I say you as an
[13:57] individual have your own walk with the
[13:59] Lord that's you and the Lord and that's
[14:01] your first Circle you and the Lord
[14:04] and after that Circle you may have a
[14:07] significant other
[14:08] and it's you that significant other and
[14:12] then and the Lord and and that Circle
[14:14] then just got a little bit bigger and
[14:17] then you start having children and that
[14:19] Circle that Clan just got a little bit
[14:21] bigger
[14:22] and then perhaps they're blessed enough
[14:25] to be a part of a church body and that
[14:28] Circle just got a little bit bigger and
[14:29] then your work uh your co-workers and
[14:33] then your community and that Circle just
[14:35] gets bigger and bigger and bigger as it
[14:37] goes out and I
[14:39] my desire is to see God working in all
[14:43] aspects of my life
[14:45] and I think that's every believer's
[14:48] heart is that God I want to make sure
[14:51] that this is secure that this bond
[14:53] between you and me is secure after that
[14:57] we'll work on the next circle out and
[14:59] then the next circle out and then the
[15:01] next one and so forth and and some of us
[15:04] are so good at that that we're effective
[15:07] within a community that within the
[15:10] within a greater Community within the
[15:13] the mayor and and and the people that
[15:15] don't know anything about the message of
[15:18] this hour are still affected by the
[15:22] message of the hour in your life
[15:26] and
[15:27] when I see somebody who who's good at
[15:30] that I go praise God I want to be more
[15:32] like you I want to be more like that
[15:37] but I need to take make sure that these
[15:39] things are taken care of first before I
[15:42] try that
[15:45] so I have a I have this quote that I'm
[15:48] going to read it's very lengthy but I I
[15:50] couldn't shorten this up
[15:54] because I want you to get the the full
[15:56] Dynamic of this of this quote
[15:59] so you get the picture
[16:01] so this is from the message the
[16:03] impersonation of Christianity
[16:06] remember random says now praying that
[16:09] God will understand I know he does he
[16:11] understands we know that
[16:13] now I was speaking to a very scholarly
[16:16] man from Canada so here we go right away
[16:19] go ahead with your stereotypes
[16:22] and as we know the Canadians are if you
[16:25] know them have ever had personal
[16:27] acquaintance with them they are Scholars
[16:30] very deep most of them
[16:32] and they do not have the troubles up
[16:34] there that we have here now that doesn't
[16:36] mean Canadians don't have troubles
[16:40] they have troubles up there we don't
[16:42] have down here
[16:44] okay
[16:46] and in there I found that this man yet
[16:49] not much older than I he's probably 50
[16:51] and he was completely grayed and his
[16:55] mustache was gray and yet not over 50
[16:58] years old
[17:00] and I said to him my brother when he
[17:03] came to the room where I was staying the
[17:04] pastor of a church I said looked at him
[17:07] and just a few years ago in Saskatoon
[17:09] when we had a great meeting together at
[17:11] the big arena when I first started into
[17:13] the Evangelistic meetings he was
[17:15] black-headed
[17:17] his mustache was black and he was had
[17:19] two young daughters and they're married
[17:21] now and got children
[17:22] and so I said in my heart oh what has
[17:25] happened he's wondering what's made him
[17:28] go gray so quick
[17:30] what's happened
[17:33] he said brother Branham about two years
[17:36] ago I thought maybe the Lord had called
[17:38] me to the United States for work
[17:40] he said I went to the West Coast and got
[17:42] connected with the certain broadcast
[17:43] that goes National
[17:45] and he said when I seen the dishonesty
[17:47] of the way they misused the finance that
[17:50] was sent in he said I just
[17:52] as a Christian couldn't stay there any
[17:55] longer I left and I got hooked up with
[17:58] another
[17:59] said it was out of the frying pan and
[18:01] Into the Fire
[18:02] he said then I just kept and found out
[18:05] so many things and said to find the
[18:08] weakness of the American pulpit
[18:12] and I said brother
[18:14] that is true
[18:16] we have no middle class here to speak of
[18:18] we either have the real cold and formal
[18:21] and indifferent or the extreme fanatic
[18:28] okay so I'm I'm
[18:29] taking a little bit of of artistic
[18:32] Liberty here to demonstrate mechanics
[18:37] and Dynamics
[18:39] and I'm likening mechanics to this real
[18:43] cold formal indifferent it's very
[18:45] mechanical
[18:46] then you have this real fanatical which
[18:49] is very Dynamic it's all Dynamics
[18:54] and we don't have the middle ground and
[18:56] I said it's too bad
[18:58] and he said then I come here and he said
[19:00] brother Brandon as soon as I got here
[19:02] and my first message I found out it was
[19:05] beating on the piano and turning over
[19:07] the chairs and he said then I begin to
[19:09] wonder and said then through it all
[19:11] I I tried to preach the gospel just in
[19:15] the word and when it did he said there
[19:18] was something another that after a while
[19:19] the Lord let me break through to the
[19:22] anointing and brought the Holy Spirit
[19:24] came into our midst with a love
[19:27] and the peace of God began to flow over
[19:30] the building just by preaching the
[19:32] gospel
[19:36] and said then I said now the holy spirit
[19:38] is here and we will now Worship the Lord
[19:41] and concentrate Our Lives unto God
[19:44] wouldn't that be a nice service that'd
[19:46] be beautiful and said some young boy
[19:49] with not enough wisdom to hardly get in
[19:51] the door runs up to the pulpit he said
[19:53] amen preacher that's right look oil's
[19:56] been dripping out of my hands all
[19:57] morning Hallelujah let people come up
[20:00] here and I'll get this anointing oil for
[20:02] healing he said brother Branham I said
[20:05] Sonny find you a seat and sit down and
[20:08] said you know what happened
[20:10] the presiding Elder said to me you find
[20:13] you a seat and sit down
[20:16] he said how will we ever how can you or
[20:19] preachers who try to hold that position
[20:22] between the two Fanatics balance the
[20:25] load I said just the grace of God
[20:31] oh what a place
[20:34] that's the truth just the grace of God
[20:40] and the man threw his hands in his face
[20:42] and wept till the wife and I standing
[20:44] there and the tears dropping off on his
[20:47] trouser legs he said brother Branham I'm
[20:49] heading for Saskatoon to get out of this
[20:52] mess of evil spirit and I said that is
[20:55] true the American Social intellectual
[20:57] groups has become so against the other
[21:00] group
[21:01] and the other group has run forth into
[21:04] into Fantastics until the true gospel
[21:07] it's hard to find a place of approach
[21:09] and to get a preeminence
[21:12] but and as I left the house speaking to
[21:14] brother Cox on my road down he knows
[21:16] nothing of this and he sits here down
[21:18] the road I said Lord how true that is
[21:21] and how hard that it's been to try to
[21:25] get the true gospel to the people
[21:27] pulling from both sides and trying to
[21:30] hold in the middle of the road as we've
[21:32] as we've contended from that since the
[21:35] hour the Cornerstone was laid see now in
[21:39] some I said what about these Americans
[21:41] down here what will happen to them and
[21:44] it seemed like something said just spoke
[21:46] to me and said what are you doing
[21:48] what is this to thee follow thou me
[21:54] so I just I'll stop here to say
[21:58] each of us may look at somebody else
[22:01] across the building
[22:04] across the street at another church
[22:07] across the world and we look at them and
[22:10] we look at the way they're acting and we
[22:12] see the way their church is doing it and
[22:13] we see the way our brother or our sister
[22:15] does things and in our minds we're
[22:18] thinking why do they act like that why
[22:20] is it that they do things like that why
[22:22] do they do the that the way they do it
[22:24] the Lord is saying what is that to thee
[22:28] what are you doing
[22:30] follow thou me you follow me
[22:33] and we say yes Lord that's true God help
[22:36] me
[22:41] and then the vision returned to my mind
[22:43] the day that I laid the Cornerstone on
[22:45] return home I was quoting it to my wife
[22:47] how many remembers the vision of the
[22:49] morning of the Cornerstone it's laying
[22:50] right there in the Cornerstone Now 23
[22:52] years ago I think and it was I was just
[22:55] across the street here just waking up
[22:57] one morning about seven o'clock in the
[22:59] June when the Cornerstone was laid I
[23:02] believe or July and on the morning
[23:03] looking out towards the rising of the
[23:05] Eastern Sun I was praising the Lord
[23:07] because the Tabernacle would then be
[23:10] have this Cornerstone laid Mr Markham
[23:12] and them had been here and many of them
[23:14] had digging the foundation and so forth
[23:16] and I was to lay the Cornerstone we have
[23:19] the pictures and so forth of it and each
[23:21] one was to place in this Cornerstone a
[23:24] certain little token and even Catholics
[23:26] come by and drop their little beads and
[23:28] so forth whatever they had into the
[23:30] Cornerstone
[23:31] but that morning the holy spirit said to
[23:33] me as I was laying there I went in them
[23:35] days I didn't know to call it a vision I
[23:38] just said it was a trance and I saw a
[23:40] vision which spoke and said that my work
[23:42] would be between the two faculties of
[23:45] the Pentecostal the Trinity and the
[23:48] Oneness and there was an empty place on
[23:51] each side to be filled
[23:54] I did not cross them up I just broke
[23:57] from each tree and planted it down and
[24:00] up into the heavens went the great trees
[24:03] are growing quickly and the fruits fell
[24:06] down and they were delicious I was
[24:09] eating them and at the cross just ahead
[24:11] of me lay all covered with fruits
[24:16] and then when I got to the place the
[24:18] Holy Spirit come down to the top of the
[24:20] trees and said shaking and roaring and
[24:22] it said do the work of an evangelist
[24:25] said when you come out of this read
[24:27] second Timothy 4 said do the work of an
[24:30] evangelist this is not your Tabernacle
[24:33] and I said where and I seen the
[24:35] Tabernacle as it is today I said where
[24:38] is my Tabernacle and he sent me down
[24:40] under the bright blue sky and he said do
[24:43] the work of an evangelist make full
[24:45] proof of your ministry for the time will
[24:47] come when they will not endure sound
[24:49] Doctrine but shall Heap for themselves
[24:52] together teachers having itching ears
[24:54] and shall be turned from the truth to
[24:57] Fables
[24:58] if that hasn't happened word by word
[25:01] that is why I've tried to strictly stay
[25:05] with the word and that's my subject
[25:08] tonight on the word
[25:13] so we see brother Branham with this
[25:15] desire in his heart not not to
[25:20] go after the trinitarians and correct
[25:23] the trinitarians and not to go after
[25:25] even though I believe he did not to go
[25:28] after the Oneness and to correct the
[25:29] Oneness and to just straighten the
[25:31] Oneness even though I believe he did
[25:34] but to stay in the middle of the war
[25:36] just preach the word of God the
[25:39] unadulterated word of God
[25:42] and the two when they can see the word
[25:46] of God being preached those that have
[25:49] the mechanics say that's true what he's
[25:52] preaching that is true the mechanics are
[25:55] in that I believe it and it and then
[25:58] when they see the spirit moving the
[26:01] Dynamics moving they say my I've never
[26:03] seen that before
[26:06] but the mechanics are right
[26:09] I'll keep listening and It produced
[26:13] fruits out of mechanical starchy cold
[26:20] fundamental people
[26:22] and then those that were running to
[26:26] Fantastics that were the Pentecostals
[26:28] that were the trinitarians they didn't
[26:31] know about the word they just knew that
[26:33] the spirit of God was moving they saw
[26:35] the working the outpouring of the gifts
[26:37] they saw the tongues they saw the
[26:39] interpretations they saw the Divine
[26:41] Healing and they said that is God that's
[26:44] got to be God but they didn't know where
[26:46] to tie it to they didn't know the
[26:48] mechanics of it they didn't know is that
[26:51] I don't know how it works does God even
[26:55] explain how it works and he does
[26:57] he does but they didn't know that but
[27:00] they just knew it was God but they could
[27:02] see brother Branham and they could see
[27:04] those Works they could see that Ministry
[27:06] they could see the Divine Healing they
[27:07] could say that's of God but when they
[27:09] began hearing the mechanics of it the
[27:12] teaching of it the placing of it they
[27:15] said we don't have that
[27:18] but that man's true and and with each of
[27:22] those different groups of people
[27:24] thinking different ways feeling
[27:26] different ways acting different ways
[27:28] when they saw that this was of God It
[27:32] produced fruit
[27:34] Delicious Fruit
[27:37] and we say to those that are fantastic
[27:41] to those that that lean towards the
[27:44] Fantastics that don't take the time to
[27:47] study the word of God
[27:49] but they love the things of God they
[27:51] love the word of God they love the
[27:53] people of God they love the acts of God
[27:57] when we see fruit moving in their life
[27:59] we say praise God
[28:01] bless you
[28:03] and when we see those who are so studied
[28:05] and they know exactly where it is and
[28:07] this is where brother Brandon really
[28:09] talks about the the Pharisees this is
[28:11] how they missed even the coming of the
[28:13] Messiah was that they they knew the
[28:16] pattern of God they knew this is this is
[28:19] how God does things through the pasties
[28:21] come through this way he's spoken to the
[28:24] prophets this way he sent an angel in
[28:27] this way therefore when he comes he'll
[28:29] come this way and when he didn't
[28:33] they missed it
[28:36] they were so caught up in the mechanics
[28:38] of the thing that when the Dynamics took
[28:40] place
[28:41] they missed it
[28:51] so we see these two groups of people
[28:53] we say whoa
[28:55] where am I who am I
[28:59] and I believe
[29:02] that as a believer
[29:05] and I I see brother I see in the message
[29:08] of the hour
[29:09] brother Branham
[29:13] the way he was built
[29:15] the way God gave the the Visions to him
[29:18] the way the way
[29:21] he presented the word of God
[29:24] the way he told his stories
[29:27] was all by design a perfect design I
[29:31] believe
[29:33] to the place that
[29:36] the first thing the first desire that
[29:39] brother Branham even in his meetings
[29:41] you can see that he would have multiple
[29:43] day meetings and he would say now these
[29:45] first few days I'm simply trying to get
[29:49] people to embrace the word of God to
[29:51] give their hearts to the Lord then those
[29:54] last services
[29:56] I like to use those for the healing
[29:59] services
[30:00] because if you can get the first part
[30:03] first
[30:06] then whether you get sick again or
[30:10] whatever it's it's a you're a sealed
[30:12] product it's a finished work
[30:15] your body may your you may get healed
[30:17] during the meeting but if your soul is
[30:19] lost what's to what avail
[30:22] and you begin to see how he lined his
[30:25] meetings out so that his first Services
[30:27] were do you know Jesus Christ do you
[30:30] know he's alive and that the spirit that
[30:33] dwelt within that man is here to dwell
[30:35] in you
[30:37] and people would say what
[30:39] brother Brandon was saying the baptism
[30:41] of the Holy Ghost is not for something
[30:44] of the past but is something that's very
[30:47] much for today
[30:49] and so anybody that has tried to create
[30:52] some sort of a mystery fog around that
[30:55] just
[30:57] let's go to the word of God and then see
[30:59] if God will back that up to prove to you
[31:02] that what I tell you is right is true
[31:06] people would say okay I'll I'll cool my
[31:09] Jets I'll sit I'll listen for a little
[31:10] bit
[31:13] and then their faith could grow and they
[31:16] could receive things that they never
[31:18] thought they could
[31:20] congressman upshop who was paralyzed uh
[31:24] you know an invalid for so many years
[31:26] after so many years he comes to a
[31:29] meeting and God heals him
[31:31] why didn't he heal him years before
[31:34] God Was preparing that seed for that
[31:42] so as we look at both the mechanics and
[31:45] the Dynamics and we say oh they're very
[31:47] mechanical or we we examine our own life
[31:50] I'll tell you I'll just I'll go ahead
[31:52] and I'll step out first I'll speak first
[31:54] this morning okay
[31:56] and then the rest of you that have your
[31:57] hands up that want to speak that the
[31:59] camera can't see right now just get in
[32:01] line and then you
[32:05] up in the box seats in the balcony and
[32:07] everywhere else
[32:11] I'm a very mechanical person
[32:14] I'm more mechanical than I am dynamical
[32:16] I don't know if that's even a word
[32:23] I love
[32:24] the studying of the word of God
[32:27] I love to study it I love to run the
[32:29] references I love to look at the
[32:32] etymology I love that I love the study
[32:34] of the word of God
[32:39] and so
[32:41] many times
[32:45] I'm always trying to
[32:49] emphasize to my own family
[32:52] study the word get your Bible sit down
[32:56] study it well why is this happening well
[33:00] have you studied have you looked
[33:05] it's
[33:10] some people
[33:12] really like that some people really
[33:14] appreciate that some people say oh I
[33:16] love that these very tidy it's very it's
[33:18] very orderly
[33:21] other people it drives them crazy
[33:24] it drives myself I drive myself crazy
[33:27] and then you see other people I know of
[33:30] some families growing up in my life
[33:34] they'll do something they'll they'll
[33:36] make a a business decision or they'll
[33:39] make up they'll make a vacation plan
[33:41] without a plan
[33:43] they'll just we're just doing this thing
[33:45] and and then and or they'll make this
[33:48] decision I'm gonna you know I went ahead
[33:49] and I just put down thirty thousand
[33:51] dollars on and you're going you did what
[33:55] and they come back and they're like
[33:56] isn't this amazing I gained 150 000 and
[33:59] you're like
[34:03] how did they do that I don't know I just
[34:07] believed that it would work
[34:12] and I mean we we do laugh at that
[34:14] because it's you know I'm laughing
[34:16] cynically in my head I'm going
[34:20] okay of course you did
[34:26] but the reality of that is
[34:28] is that there's this there's this part
[34:31] of the it's a faith in them
[34:34] that they throw out a fishing line and
[34:36] they pull up a submarine
[34:39] you know I mean like they hit gold
[34:42] and I and I've noticed that a lot of of
[34:45] those people that I'm mentioning man
[34:48] when they hit when they hit it they hit
[34:50] it
[34:51] but when they hit bottom man they hit
[34:54] bottom it's like these
[34:56] Peaks and valleys I mean epic like Rick
[35:00] you know and I'm just like just I just
[35:03] want to gain you know I just
[35:05] I just want any gain but you know and
[35:07] it's like yeah okay well you got it but
[35:09] it's so small nobody
[35:12] it's like but it is a gain right
[35:18] and I and I look at those people and I
[35:20] go I want more of that
[35:24] I do I'll just be truthful
[35:27] I say God I know how I made up this is
[35:31] the point I was getting at was the first
[35:33] thing brother Brandon when he when he
[35:34] put together the church age book the
[35:37] very first part of it is the deity of
[35:40] Jesus Christ
[35:41] and why is that at the front and not the
[35:44] back well it's all through it but it's
[35:46] right at the front and the point is is
[35:48] if you can recognize him who he is
[35:54] it will give you a rest it'll give you a
[35:56] confidence it'll build your faith to
[35:59] know if this is who he is then I'm
[36:03] confident he's in control
[36:06] I'm confident I can lean upon him I'm
[36:10] confident that he's got the answer it
[36:13] gives you this faith it gives you this
[36:15] confidence to know who he is first okay
[36:18] then the next thing is is who are you
[36:22] oh that's a big one so now we're this
[36:25] big complex creature called a human
[36:27] being
[36:28] and we're going who am I you know I mean
[36:31] there's people you look at them in your
[36:33] whole life you go to church with them
[36:34] and you go out they're so put together I
[36:36] tell you they're so put together and
[36:39] then years down the road you go to their
[36:41] home for supper
[36:43] and they're like I tell you I'm a wreck
[36:45] I can't I can't do this I can't and
[36:47] you're like I mean they're just pulling
[36:49] down this whole fabric of what you
[36:51] thought they were
[36:54] and you're like I thought you were so
[36:55] put in there like oh no I'm a mess
[37:01] so we come to church on Sunday morning
[37:04] we get into our prayer closet daily
[37:08] hourly
[37:10] minute by minute we get we we're
[37:13] uttering prayers to God going who am I
[37:17] who am I
[37:19] mean we say it in all kinds of different
[37:21] ways like who am I and they were like
[37:23] who am I
[37:27] okay you know you get these glimpses of
[37:29] who you are and you go oh
[37:32] that's glorious you know the minister
[37:35] gets up and he goes I want to redo the
[37:37] end of the book and you're like I love
[37:38] the end of the book
[37:40] and he's like but the journey to the end
[37:42] of the book is raw and you're like yeah
[37:48] so now he wants to show you who you are
[37:50] and when you begin understanding Who You
[37:53] Are
[37:54] then he says now let's see who we are
[37:59] let's find out who we are
[38:03] and you find that this desire of who he
[38:06] is
[38:07] is for you to know who you are and that
[38:09] he can make you
[38:12] the potential
[38:15] of who you're supposed to be
[38:18] that's the desire of the believer
[38:24] so brother Brandon expresses a little
[38:26] bit these mechanics and these Dynamics
[38:29] he expresses it in in the church in the
[38:33] framework of the church in the framework
[38:36] of of uh I say the church it's it's
[38:40] not the bride necessarily but we're just
[38:44] going to call it the church she's
[38:46] included but it it's also including the
[38:49] umbrella
[38:51] of what is called the church
[38:53] and in the message the token brother
[38:54] Branham says I've always said
[38:57] I've met two classes of people now I've
[38:58] pulled up several quotes here from
[39:00] different messages because he says this
[39:02] a lot and I I want to read them to
[39:05] substantiate because you're going to
[39:06] know these quotes but it substantiates
[39:10] what he's saying you you so that you
[39:13] just it wasn't just something well I
[39:15] don't know if that's what he was saying
[39:17] well he says it multiple places so it
[39:19] gives you an idea that I think that's
[39:21] what he's saying
[39:22] I've always said I met two classes of
[39:24] people the fundamentals and the
[39:26] Pentecostals now I kind of go the
[39:31] fundamentals and the fantasticals
[39:36] he calls it Pentecostals
[39:38] the fundamentals positionally studies
[39:42] the scriptures and figure it out they
[39:45] say well we're sons of God they believe
[39:48] that yes sir but they don't have any
[39:49] faith with it
[39:51] but the Pentecostals has a lot of faith
[39:54] and they don't know they're sons of God
[39:55] like a man got money in the bank can't
[39:59] write a check and the other one can
[40:01] write a check got no money in the bank
[40:04] if you could just ever get the thing
[40:07] together till men and women could
[40:09] realize you that's been truly baptized
[40:12] into the Holy Spirit and you have the
[40:15] token to display you have a right to
[40:17] every Redemptive blessings that God
[40:20] promised
[40:22] everything that he promised is yours
[40:24] hold your token over your unwavering
[40:27] Faith as you pray and over his word
[40:30] faith in his word
[40:33] you say I believe the word I need faith
[40:36] in his word so he said I got faith faith
[40:39] in what
[40:40] it needs to be faith in his word okay
[40:45] the message the identified Christ of all
[40:47] ages and I find out I I find two classes
[40:50] of people as it goes along one of them
[40:52] is the fundamentalists and the other one
[40:55] is Pentecostals now the Pentecostals got
[40:58] something but they don't know who they
[40:59] are and the fundamentalists know
[41:01] something but ain't got nothing with it
[41:04] so now there it's just like a man has
[41:06] got money in the bank and can't write a
[41:08] check and the other one can write a
[41:10] check got no money in the bank if you
[41:12] could ever get that thing together it
[41:15] would be a great thing but now in the
[41:17] face of this way we try to carry the
[41:20] meeting is for you
[41:22] you as the individual for your need in
[41:26] Christ
[41:29] now I like that
[41:31] because there's many husbands that are
[41:33] like holding dearly to their own Souls
[41:36] but they're like I gotta keep it
[41:38] together for my family
[41:41] but the first things first is you
[41:44] your need as an individual
[41:49] God will take care of your family
[41:51] he'll do it he'll do it
[41:56] and he'll take care of you
[42:00] he'll take care of you individually
[42:06] salvation
[42:08] Divine Healing or whatever you have need
[42:11] of is to you by faith know that you're
[42:15] in the presence of Christ and by faith
[42:18] you reach and get it for that's the only
[42:21] way you'll ever get it is by faith we
[42:24] are saved by faith we're healed see
[42:26] nothing that God has to come down and do
[42:29] again he's already done it
[42:33] one more then Jesus came and called
[42:36] that's what's the matter with the people
[42:38] I've often said it's a little ridiculous
[42:40] to say it I find two classes of people
[42:42] as I travel the fundamentalists and the
[42:44] Pentecostals outside of that I don't
[42:46] know about it and the fundamentalists
[42:48] are people who positionally knows where
[42:51] they stand but they haven't got any
[42:53] faith in what they're doing
[42:55] and the Pentecostals is the people who
[42:57] they have has got that Faith but they
[43:00] don't know who they are it's just like a
[43:02] man that's got money in the bank and
[43:03] can't write a check and the other one
[43:05] can write a check and hasn't got no
[43:07] money in the bank if you could ever get
[43:10] it together if you get the Pentecostals
[43:12] to wake up that the holy spirit that you
[43:14] claim to have that's him identifying his
[43:18] name and his word
[43:20] then sign Your Name Across the check and
[43:23] hand it in watch it watch it be
[43:26] recognized by the banks of Heaven
[43:35] husbands and wives you know
[43:37] it's like the husband's like I got the
[43:39] money in the bank and she's like I can
[43:40] write the check
[43:43] get them together you know and watch
[43:47] the the
[43:49] Pinterest show up in your house you know
[43:52] it's like
[43:53] all of a sudden you'll start seeing all
[43:55] kinds of things showing up in your house
[43:56] and you men are like I'm not a decorator
[43:59] don't you worry you put the money in the
[44:01] bank she'll write the check
[44:10] the mechanics and the Dynamics
[44:14] I know I know I know who I am I know my
[44:17] makeup I know which way I lean
[44:23] see the other and
[44:26] I want it I want more of it
[44:28] but I see how far it goes and I go ah
[44:34] I don't know that I want that it's
[44:37] but but but this other is saying I know
[44:40] who I am I know how I act and I know I
[44:43] see that and I appreciate it and I need
[44:46] more of it but they see the far end of
[44:48] it and they go I want nothing to do with
[44:50] that
[44:52] right
[44:54] I mean there's just some of us that it's
[44:57] it's like you know I I tell you we need
[45:00] the spirit we need more Spirit we need
[45:02] more spirit and you look at somebody
[45:04] else who who's like well
[45:07] you know be careful where the spirit
[45:10] goes and and they go oh they're cold
[45:12] they're starchy they're fundamentalists
[45:14] and I want nothing to do with that and
[45:16] the fundamentalist is going praise God I
[45:19] see what God has promised for today you
[45:21] know one day if only
[45:24] I tell you and he sees this other group
[45:26] that's going I'll tell you God is moving
[45:28] and and I see God moving you and they're
[45:30] going
[45:33] cuckoo cuckoo
[45:36] I don't know that I want any of that
[45:39] brother Branham is saying there's fruit
[45:41] in both
[45:44] they both produce fruit good Delicious
[45:47] Fruit
[45:48] if you could get the two together
[45:52] what a feast
[45:56] Colossians chapter 3 and verse 17 and
[45:59] whatsoever ye do in word or deed
[46:05] do all in the name of the Lord Jesus
[46:08] giving thanks to God and the father by
[46:12] him
[46:13] we love when people do things in Word
[46:16] so nice it's so pleasant
[46:19] but we really love it
[46:21] when they do indeed
[46:23] we really like that
[46:24] but if you if you only did indeed
[46:28] and not in Word
[46:34] some of you look at me so strangely when
[46:38] I say these things
[46:39] and
[46:41] I've heard this
[46:43] I've heard this discussion so many times
[46:46] do you love me
[46:49] you know I love you
[46:51] I bring home the bacon and I do this
[46:54] thing I know but I want to hear you tell
[46:56] me
[46:58] oh so the word is important
[47:05] and then there's you know oh I love you
[47:07] you know how much I love you oh I love
[47:09] love love love love love love I love him
[47:11] lovey love you
[47:13] it's like then show me
[47:18] you know you're
[47:20] you're all talk and no game
[47:24] okay whatsoever ye do in word and or
[47:28] deed word or deed do all in the name of
[47:33] the Lord Jesus
[47:37] First John 3 18 my little children let
[47:40] us not love in word neither in tongue
[47:44] but in deed and in truth
[47:49] so
[47:51] this word and tongue is one thing and
[47:53] this deed and Truth
[47:59] we're seeing this connection
[48:02] Saint John 4 23 but the hour cometh and
[48:05] now is when the true worshipers shall
[48:08] worship the father in spirit
[48:11] and in truth
[48:15] for the father seeketh such to worship
[48:19] Him
[48:22] I I love that you worship me in spirit I
[48:26] love it I love it
[48:29] child
[48:30] I work I I I love your worship and
[48:33] spirit you need some truth now with it
[48:37] child you got lots of Truth boy you're
[48:40] loaded with truth good good job so happy
[48:43] how much truth you went and you sought
[48:45] and you found it and I'm happy
[48:49] now it's time to add some Spirit to that
[48:51] truth
[48:52] and I'm seeking those that will worship
[48:56] in spirit
[48:57] and in truth
[49:01] the smyrnian church age brother Branham
[49:03] says he told us the evidence or what
[49:06] would happen after being baptized with
[49:08] the Holy Ghost was that we would have
[49:11] the teacher come and teach
[49:15] all truth
[49:18] but that teacher was an inside teacher
[49:23] not an outside teacher
[49:27] if the spirit wasn't inside you wouldn't
[49:30] hear the truth and receive it by
[49:32] Revelation if you heard it every moment
[49:36] of the day
[49:38] you see I tell you brother reg you're
[49:40] such a fine teacher the way you teach
[49:41] things is so beautiful and you know I
[49:43] prayed that God would reveal and he sent
[49:46] you and your that your teaching is just
[49:48] it's teaching me all kinds that's great
[49:50] that's wonderful thank you for the words
[49:52] thank you for your even the faith in me
[49:54] but this teacher he's talking about is
[49:56] an inside teacher and that's not me
[49:59] that's not any man that you'll ever find
[50:02] that is none other than the spirit of
[50:05] God himself
[50:07] The Same Spirit that dwelleth in him if
[50:09] that same spirit that dwelled in him
[50:11] raised Jesus from the dead it will
[50:13] Quicken your mortal bodies too if that
[50:16] Spirit dwells in you
[50:17] [Music]
[50:23] now there's a message
[50:26] it is the rising of the Sun and I'm I
[50:28] promise you I'm coming to a close here
[50:30] shortly which
[50:34] I promise okay
[50:37] the message is it is the rising of the
[50:39] Sun and I find that when brother Brian
[50:41] was talking about mechanics and Dynamics
[50:43] it's the one sermon where he covered he
[50:45] talks about it the most
[50:47] in your table search it will come up the
[50:50] most
[50:52] he does such a nice job
[50:56] of illustrating mechanics and Dynamics
[51:01] and I grabbed one small quote from it
[51:06] says until that church becomes both
[51:09] Dynamics and mechanics
[51:12] and the spirit of God that moved him to
[51:15] do the things that he did
[51:17] if he hit now listen I want you to put
[51:19] your name in here remember that story of
[51:22] the sailor boy
[51:24] who is the sea captain
[51:27] got sick
[51:28] and he he knew that this sailor boy was
[51:31] a Christian
[51:31] and he asked him could you come in here
[51:33] could you read me the Bible and that
[51:36] sailor boy he said read to me something
[51:37] from the Bible and he said well
[51:39] there's this scripture that's always one
[51:43] of my favorites my mother taught it to
[51:44] me and it was he was bruised for our
[51:48] iniquity and by his stripes we are
[51:51] healed he goes over that and the captain
[51:53] says that is so lovely that is so nice
[51:55] he says but you know my mama when she
[51:59] taught me to read it she taught me to
[52:01] put my name in it
[52:02] and he goes he reads this scripture but
[52:05] he uses not by his stripes I'm Healed he
[52:08] he uses his name
[52:11] and the captain says oh that's so nice
[52:14] could that be done for me and he says
[52:16] sure and he reads the captain's name
[52:19] into that very scripture and the captain
[52:21] gets up puts on his coat and goes out
[52:24] and he continues to live because by
[52:27] faith he believed when that boy put his
[52:30] name in there he believed that was meant
[52:33] for him and I want you to believe the
[52:36] same thing when brother Branham says
[52:38] this him uh
[52:41] if he hit on 16 cylinders talking about
[52:44] Jesus Christ
[52:46] so will the bride
[52:49] it doesn't say maybe
[52:51] if he said on 16 cylinders you might hit
[52:54] on eight
[52:56] if he hit on 16 you might hit 12.
[53:00] he said if he hit on 16 cylinders you
[53:03] will hit on 16 cylinders now you say I'm
[53:07] not a 16 cylinder person I don't know if
[53:10] I can do it he said you could
[53:13] he said you would
[53:16] if he hit on 16 cylinders so will the
[53:19] bride amen for he said in John 14 12 he
[53:23] that believeth on me the works that I do
[53:25] shall he do also I'll give him a charge
[53:28] of my Dynamics in his mechanics
[53:32] that the world will not be able to
[53:34] withstand it and I'll raise him up again
[53:36] at the last day that's the Easter
[53:39] message the Dynamics and the mechanics
[53:41] together the mechanics without the
[53:44] Dynamics no good neither is the Dynamics
[53:48] without the mechanics
[53:51] oh my when I read that I think oh God
[53:54] there's hope for me
[53:56] oh God not only is there hope for me I
[53:59] believe you want that for me and if I
[54:02] can believe that God wants it for me
[54:04] then I believe that I will come to that
[54:06] I've got to believe that I and if I
[54:11] don't come to that then the Lord will
[54:12] take me home and that's okay with me and
[54:16] somebody will hit on 16 cylinders
[54:18] somebody will bring both the mechanics
[54:21] and the Dynamics together and I'm not
[54:23] saying that one day I will I believe
[54:26] that God has done that for you that has
[54:29] received the baptism of the Holy for you
[54:32] that do believe this I believe that both
[54:35] is there the opportunity for what we
[54:38] desire to be is a possibility that we
[54:42] can be
[54:47] and this is why
[54:49] I read proverbs 8.
[54:51] now I know this is a little bit of
[54:54] artistic Liberty but just bear with me
[54:56] I'm just going to go over those first
[54:58] three verses
[55:00] proverbs 8. verse 1.
[55:05] doth not wisdom cry and understanding
[55:08] put forth her voice
[55:10] imagine wisdom and understanding as
[55:13] mechanics and Dynamics
[55:17] they're crying out
[55:19] they've got something to say they just
[55:21] they've got something that's good that's
[55:24] desirable for you you search proverbs
[55:27] Solomon is constantly saying if there's
[55:29] one thing to get get wisdom
[55:32] few and understanding you know get them
[55:37] they're like sisters and they'll be a
[55:38] treasure for you I'm telling you get
[55:41] wisdom and get understanding and this
[55:43] idea of get the mechanics and the
[55:46] Dynamics get them I promise you it's a
[55:49] benefit I promise you it'll work wonders
[55:52] in your life
[55:54] does not wisdom cry and understanding
[55:57] put forth her voice she standeth in the
[56:00] top of the high places
[56:05] did you find her
[56:07] did you find her this morning
[56:10] she was in the top of the high places
[56:12] did you find her
[56:13] you say no I was in a hurry to get here
[56:15] we were running late brother the kids
[56:17] were keeping me from her no problem no
[56:21] problem
[56:22] she was by the way in the places of the
[56:25] paths did you find her there no I flew
[56:28] past that at 90 miles an hour this
[56:30] morning on the 101. no problem
[56:33] she crieth at the gates
[56:36] did you get her there
[56:39] did you get it there
[56:41] you say man I tell you I've just I've
[56:43] got all these jobs lined out you don't
[56:45] understand my schedule I'm busy no
[56:48] problem she was at the entry of the city
[56:53] did you get her there
[56:56] no
[56:58] I like to sleep
[57:01] I just you know I'm just going to be
[57:03] honest I'm a lazy person
[57:05] I'm just lazy and I just didn't no
[57:07] problem she was coming she was at the
[57:10] coming Inn at the doors
[57:16] the point I'm trying to make
[57:19] is that there was always there's this
[57:21] opportunity it's this opportunity that's
[57:24] been presented
[57:26] that this idea
[57:29] of mechanics and Dynamics and well I
[57:32] know who I am I know who I am and I know
[57:35] who I want to be and and you know
[57:37] another Sunday you know I can't wait
[57:39] till next Sunday because I might get it
[57:41] no problem
[57:43] it might be there I I have no doubt
[57:46] it'll be there waiting for you
[57:48] but you know it's waiting
[57:51] less than 24 hours from now
[57:54] your job
[57:56] and school
[57:58] and every other problem
[58:01] that's not here at this place on Sunday
[58:04] morning
[58:06] and mechanics and Dynamics
[58:09] are what we need is what we want it's
[58:11] what I'm Desiring for my Monday morning
[58:17] when I when I'm approaching
[58:20] my family first thing in the morning
[58:24] when we're going to do our devotions
[58:25] together if we would do them together I
[58:28] probably won't I'll probably be chasing
[58:30] deer
[58:32] early in the morning
[58:34] okay but when I come back
[58:37] I want the mechanics and the Dynamics
[58:39] working
[58:41] and when I have to go meet the customer
[58:43] I want the mechanics and the Dynamics
[58:46] operating in my life perchance
[58:50] per chance
[58:52] I could be a witness for Jesus Christ
[59:00] it's that daily it's that daily it's the
[59:03] Practical use thing that's what I
[59:05] believe that this message has given us
[59:07] is that practical daily daily outworking
[59:13] and and it's and that's such a terrible
[59:15] thing to say daily it's Moment by moment
[59:18] the the spirit of God moving through me
[59:22] the moment by moment I could say
[59:25] something that might that might have
[59:27] been wasn't brother Reggie that was that
[59:31] was God
[59:32] and you know what that is you know what
[59:35] that is you know when you go when
[59:37] somebody has said something and you go
[59:38] to them later and you say that was just
[59:40] the Lord and then you're taken back and
[59:43] you know you're oh thank you thank you I
[59:44] don't know what I said
[59:46] it don't matter right
[59:53] the opportunities waiting
[59:56] it's sitting there waiting for us she's
[59:57] crying out she's crying out the
[59:59] mechanics the Dynamics she's crying out
[1:00:03] amen if the musicians would come
[1:00:31] you know I love that we have the young
[1:00:32] people right here on the front
[1:00:37] in my heart
[1:00:42] I think I'm probably 17 now
[1:00:45] probably 17 years old at this point
[1:00:48] I think 17 year olds are allowed to sit
[1:00:50] up here right
[1:00:55] I feel like I'm one of you I feel like
[1:00:57] I'm one of you young people
[1:00:59] foreign
[1:01:04] as a young person
[1:01:06] to go to church
[1:01:14] because that's just what that's what you
[1:01:16] do that's what you do on Sunday
[1:01:20] and I know what it is as a young person
[1:01:21] to go to church
[1:01:23] with a
[1:01:25] with an aching desire in my heart
[1:01:29] for God
[1:01:31] to change my life
[1:01:32] [Music]
[1:01:37] and you look around at the world around
[1:01:40] you at the grown at the adults around
[1:01:42] you that
[1:01:46] believe
[1:01:48] the word of God
[1:01:52] you see how they act you you've got
[1:01:55] you're going to go home to a family that
[1:01:56] believes that and you know how they act
[1:01:58] even even at home and not here in front
[1:02:01] of everybody else
[1:02:04] and I
[1:02:05] [Music]
[1:02:09] am thankful that you that you've got
[1:02:10] that
[1:02:14] foreign
[1:02:20] say I just want more Dynamics
[1:02:25] I want to see God more in my life I
[1:02:29] believe he's there you may be at that
[1:02:31] place where you say I believe he's there
[1:02:32] I believe I've seen him in my life I but
[1:02:35] I need to see him more I need to see him
[1:02:38] more evident in my life I feel like
[1:02:39] maybe I've gone cold or Star stale
[1:02:45] and I need him more
[1:02:47] the point is is I if you want that he
[1:02:51] wants you to have it
[1:02:52] he wants you to have more of that
[1:02:58] if you say I don't I don't
[1:03:01] I don't know how it works it seems so
[1:03:03] mysterious it
[1:03:06] how does it work
[1:03:09] so many times you've heard this advice
[1:03:11] but it's just the truth
[1:03:14] we're going to say read your Bible
[1:03:19] [Music]
[1:03:23] this this is our foundation it's right
[1:03:25] here the word of God
[1:03:27] foreign
[1:03:28] this is our foundation now there's many
[1:03:30] other books that we're going to
[1:03:31] recommend that you read
[1:03:33] good ones
[1:03:35] as many sermons we're going to want you
[1:03:37] to read or hear
[1:03:42] but a few young people
[1:03:45] I'm not 17.
[1:03:49] just a little over 25.
[1:03:53] almost twice
[1:03:55] but I still
[1:03:57] I still have moments and you can look
[1:03:59] around you could look at those that are
[1:04:02] even older than I am and you could ask
[1:04:04] them you still have these feelings that
[1:04:07] I'm feeling that you want more of God
[1:04:10] you want him more evident and more
[1:04:13] dynamic in your life and if you looked
[1:04:16] around those grown people that you have
[1:04:19] looked to and thought whatever you
[1:04:22] thought about them if you looked around
[1:04:24] they would I believe with all my heart
[1:04:27] they would tell you a man
[1:04:29] I still feel that way
[1:04:34] [Music]
[1:04:39] and if you ask them when you ask that
[1:04:41] when you felt that way did he do it for
[1:04:43] you
[1:04:45] so many of these older Believers would
[1:04:48] tell you he did it he does it he's
[1:04:51] faithful he does do it
[1:04:54] he's faithful at giving both the
[1:04:57] mechanics and the Dynamics and when I
[1:04:59] needed more mechanics God created the
[1:05:02] circumstances for me to search the
[1:05:04] scripture for me to search it out so
[1:05:07] that I could be anchored in knowing why
[1:05:10] he does what he does
[1:05:12] and when I felt that I was anchored and
[1:05:15] then my my my mind and my heart thought
[1:05:17] what could God do
[1:05:21] that's when the dynamic said oh
[1:05:24] taste and see
[1:05:26] [Music]
[1:05:30] taste those Dynamics
[1:05:31] [Music]
[1:05:37] I wonder if we could just sing this
[1:05:39] together this is the air I breathe this
[1:05:43] is my daily bread
[1:05:45] sing it with me
