[0:00] matthew chapter 18
[0:03] i'm going to begin reading with verse
[0:04] 15.
[0:06] i would like
[0:08] um
[0:09] i even realized right now i was going to
[0:10] read to verse 22.
[0:12] but while you're standing i'm going to
[0:14] take advantage of you your attention and
[0:17] kind of uh
[0:19] teach a little bit through some of these
[0:21] verses because i don't want to come back
[0:22] to them later but i want you to connect
[0:24] with something
[0:25] on this subject of barriers and
[0:27] boundaries it's very relevant scriptures
[0:29] when you recognize this it says moreover
[0:31] if thy brother
[0:32] shall trespass against him he's just
[0:34] been talking about a lost sheep someone
[0:36] who's gone astray he says moreover if
[0:38] thy brother shall trespass against thee
[0:40] go and tell him
[0:42] his fault between thee and him alone so
[0:45] you don't do it in front of somebody
[0:46] else you go to them and them alone
[0:48] otherwise it's it's inappropriate if he
[0:51] shall hear thee thou hast gained thy
[0:53] brother but if he will not hear thee
[0:55] then take
[0:56] with the one or two more that in the
[0:58] mouth of two or three witnesses every
[1:00] word may be established and if he shall
[1:02] neglect to hear them tell it unto the
[1:04] church but if you neglect to hear the
[1:06] church these are very remarkable
[1:08] scriptures because
[1:09] there's only one one other place where
[1:11] jesus mentions the church and that's
[1:12] upon this rock shall i build my church
[1:15] so this mystery of the church
[1:18] is contained in this and also speaks of
[1:21] what paul would establish as the
[1:22] christian church he says if he neglects
[1:25] to hear the church let him be unto thee
[1:28] as a heathen man and a publican it's a
[1:31] very heavy statement regard him respect
[1:34] him as a heathen man and republican
[1:36] verily i say unto you whatsoever ye
[1:38] shall bind on earth shall be bound in
[1:40] heaven now notice the power here that's
[1:42] being given
[1:44] you have this power to bind and this
[1:45] power to loose relates to barriers and
[1:47] boundaries
[1:48] that you have been given power to bind
[1:50] whatever you bind in heaven or on earth
[1:53] will be bound in heaven whatsoever ye
[1:54] shall loose on earth shall be loosed in
[1:57] heaven
[1:58] so this speaks to your authority the
[1:59] position you have as a believer and even
[2:01] how it would be reflected in heaven
[2:03] again i say it unto you that if two of
[2:05] you shall agree on earth as touching
[2:07] anything that they shall ask it shall be
[2:09] done for them
[2:11] of my father which is in heaven for
[2:13] where two or three are gathered together
[2:14] in my name there am i in the midst of
[2:16] them now notice how
[2:18] this speaks to
[2:21] whatever you're binding whatever you're
[2:22] losing
[2:23] comes after
[2:25] addressing a trespass
[2:27] and if the person's not heard then
[2:29] you're going to take with two or three
[2:31] witnesses
[2:32] to address the matter and if they don't
[2:34] hear you they become as a heathen and a
[2:37] publican and then it's saying whatever
[2:39] you bind and it's not speaking to the
[2:41] church speaking to the individual even
[2:42] those that would be witnesses together
[2:45] whatever you bind on earth and if two
[2:47] shall agree on earth these if two shall
[2:49] agree
[2:50] then it shall be as you asked very
[2:52] powerful scriptures that i want you to
[2:54] keep in mind and on the front end as we
[2:56] approach this subject god bless you you
[2:58] can be seated
[3:00] we're talk we are speaking on the
[3:02] subject of barriers and boundaries i
[3:05] thought i would finish tonight it's been
[3:07] impressed upon my heart
[3:08] to go ahead and by god's grace some sum
[3:11] it all up
[3:12] on sunday morning
[3:14] and i think it's very rare that i have
[3:15] that kind of
[3:17] uh sense that i could summarize
[3:18] something and wrap it up but if god
[3:20] would give me the liberty and the grace
[3:21] to do so we'll do that on sunday morning
[3:23] we'll take this subject and uh take a
[3:26] step further in it but try to summon
[3:28] bring it to a climax and then move on
[3:30] from there but we're in the subtitle of
[3:33] respect
[3:34] and we're we're bringing a lot in from
[3:36] these other services we've already
[3:38] preached so this is an upper-level
[3:39] course in this we're just going to jump
[3:41] right in it when we talk about respect
[3:43] we are specifically referring to a
[3:44] healthy respect for yourself
[3:46] and then also a proper respect for
[3:48] others
[3:49] and it is about setting
[3:52] setting and observing boundaries but
[3:55] also addressing barriers and it's a
[3:57] respect when you respect something um
[3:59] you'll set a standard you'll set a limit
[4:01] when you respect something you won't go
[4:03] beyond that if it's somebody else's but
[4:05] then if you have respect for for the
[4:07] appropriate appreciation for something
[4:10] you can see when something's a hindrance
[4:11] something's uh
[4:12] binding up something's keeping something
[4:15] from something's keeping something from
[4:16] something
[4:18] how's that for an alliteration
[4:19] but there is a restraint something's
[4:21] being held back
[4:23] i want to uh
[4:24] define and so i will respect
[4:27] and this is very important to kind of
[4:29] grab on in the beginning
[4:31] and i'm very conscious of the time and
[4:33] i'd ask brother michael to give me a lot
[4:34] of time and he's done so
[4:36] and i'm kind of losing it rapidly but
[4:39] catch on these definitions because i'm
[4:41] going to come right back to them again
[4:42] even if i don't reference them they're
[4:43] going to they're going to pop i think in
[4:45] in at the end to respect means to show
[4:48] or feel a deferential regard for so to
[4:51] show a deference to feel a regard a
[4:53] deference a deference to somebody and it
[4:56] also means to esteem now this would be
[4:59] the most likely definition that we might
[5:01] use out of respect because it connotates
[5:03] maybe some reverence or not necessarily
[5:06] an awe but a deference to somebody and i
[5:08] think it's an appropriate use of the
[5:09] term respect i be brother branham uses
[5:12] it in that sense in many of the places
[5:13] he deals with it uh there's also a
[5:16] definition of agape love that is defined
[5:18] as godly respects and godly love so
[5:20] there's something about respect that's
[5:22] even related to love
[5:24] now respect also maybe in a more general
[5:27] sense carries with it this meaning
[5:28] relationship a relation this is what it
[5:30] originally means it's a relationship
[5:32] with respect to something it's a
[5:34] relation or relationship
[5:36] so it's a regard or consideration
[5:38] and the word respect is literally from
[5:40] the act of looking at someone
[5:43] to respect something is it's literally
[5:45] the etymology of it is to literally from
[5:46] the the word that means the act of
[5:48] looking at one
[5:50] and so we uh those are kind of in
[5:53] in the meaning and the full
[5:54] understanding of the term respect and so
[5:56] we use it to mean kind of the courteous
[5:58] treatment of somebody or the uh to be
[6:00] considerate of someone uh to a treatment
[6:03] that's due someone if you're considerate
[6:05] or uh you're courteous it's a treatment
[6:08] in that treatment it's due to them they
[6:09] deserve this show them the respect that
[6:11] they deserve it's a treatment that
[6:13] they're due
[6:14] and and to regard something
[6:17] since that's kind of in the in the
[6:18] meaning to regard something to regard
[6:21] something's to consider it it's also to
[6:23] judge
[6:24] when you regard something you're judging
[6:26] it you're you're estimating what it uh
[6:29] what it deserves and what its value is
[6:31] and it also means it's to show
[6:33] deferential regard for so it's
[6:35] consideration or judgment but it's also
[6:37] to esteem which means to estimate or to
[6:39] determine so there's a lot that comes to
[6:41] value so there's a lot that comes into
[6:43] the picture when we talk about respect
[6:46] because we could just use it very
[6:47] loosely well i need to respect somebody
[6:49] i just need to and like we do with love
[6:51] because we're talking about we were
[6:52] using the referencing love has limits
[6:55] and so we could just use it very
[6:56] sloppily uh very messy very emotional
[6:59] very huggy feeling and that's not what's
[7:01] intended by the word respect there's
[7:03] some estimation some determination to or
[7:06] value
[7:07] uh what uh what is due
[7:09] and so it's this word respect is about
[7:12] love
[7:12] it's about faith functioning in
[7:15] discernment functioning and judgment
[7:17] a development of faith to into perfect
[7:20] faith a development of love that can
[7:22] recognize what is good and cleave to it
[7:24] recognize what is evil and abhor it
[7:27] and we will not take the time this
[7:28] evening we'll refer back to it but we'll
[7:30] come back to it next service lord
[7:31] willing to love thy neighbor as thyself
[7:33] and also to love thy enemies are calls
[7:36] to respect them
[7:38] when you're asked to love your neighbor
[7:40] we don't we don't default to kind of
[7:41] this you know the kind of love we might
[7:43] have for our wife or the kind of
[7:44] emotional love uh when we're told to
[7:46] love our enemies it's not it's to res
[7:49] it's to have a respect that's even due
[7:51] to a neighbor the most base respect
[7:53] that's due to a neighbor even a respect
[7:55] that's due to your enemies
[7:57] and i want to emphasize that much more
[7:59] in the coming service
[8:01] but if you ponder it right now and just
[8:02] think about it it's a beautifully
[8:04] measured balance
[8:06] of seeing them for what they are
[8:08] and what they can be
[8:11] because if you treat a sinner as a
[8:13] christian
[8:15] as someone who can understand all
[8:16] mysteries as somebody who's walking in
[8:18] the fellowship somebody who has faith
[8:20] and you treat them and regard them as
[8:22] having
[8:23] come to salvation then you could you
[8:25] could miss them where they are and fail
[8:27] to appreciate where they are as a sinner
[8:29] and what they need
[8:31] and you say well then then how do i love
[8:33] them as a brother and how do i treat
[8:35] them right so that they can be saved
[8:36] regard also what they can be
[8:39] because if they're a sinner that means
[8:40] there's potential to be saved
[8:42] and so it's not just uh recognizing oh
[8:44] he's a snake in the grass oh she's an
[8:46] enemy and boy she's sure got a problem
[8:48] it's a measured balance of seeing them
[8:50] for what they are being able to have the
[8:52] testimony that you can't tell who their
[8:54] friends are and who their enemies are
[8:55] not because you just treat everybody the
[8:58] same but you have a way that you conduct
[9:00] yourself in a measured approach to say
[9:02] even if they're my enemy they can be
[9:06] there's a way that you even if they're a
[9:07] sinner even if they're a reprobate i
[9:09] also see them for what they may what
[9:11] they can be
[9:13] now this is picking up on galatians
[9:15] chapter five now if you could turn in
[9:17] your bibles your apps
[9:19] i turn your attention to the screen
[9:21] galatians chapter 5
[9:23] verses 13 to 15.
[9:25] and
[9:26] this is a
[9:29] was used on sunday and i want to begin
[9:32] here as we take a step further in the
[9:33] subject of respect for brethren you have
[9:35] been called into liberty only use not
[9:38] liberty for an occasion to the flesh but
[9:40] by love serve one another liberty is
[9:42] often used as a justification
[9:44] for a lot of nonsense
[9:46] paul is saying don't use your liberty as
[9:48] an occasion to satisfy yourself to lift
[9:50] yourself up make yourself look good or
[9:52] even indulge your desires but use your
[9:55] liberty as an opportunity to serve
[9:57] others to serve one another and then
[9:59] this very weighty weighty statement that
[10:01] summarizes even the teachings of christ
[10:03] for all the law is fulfilled in one word
[10:06] the law and the prophets hang on these
[10:07] things that christ mentioned now paul
[10:09] summarizes it in one word one
[10:10] commandment even this thou shalt love
[10:12] thy neighbor as thyself
[10:15] but if he bite and devour one another
[10:17] take heed that you be not consumed one
[10:19] of another
[10:21] if you bite that biting that rough harsh
[10:23] speaking when you bite somebody's head
[10:24] off that's what he's talking about this
[10:26] biting this backbiting this stabbing
[10:28] this harsh speaking to devour means to
[10:30] destroy
[10:31] and he says if this is kind of the way
[10:32] you act and the way you interact with
[10:34] one another you're going to take heed
[10:36] because you're going to be consumed one
[10:37] of another you're you are going to be
[10:39] consumed you'll also do the consuming
[10:41] where it would be with bitterness with
[10:42] jealousy through contention and strife
[10:45] that you're overwhelmed and that becomes
[10:46] your metric that becomes your view that
[10:48] becomes your everything he says you
[10:50] better be careful because when you enter
[10:52] into that you are consumed with it
[10:54] now verse 13
[10:57] has is deserving of a lot of attention
[10:59] he's saying you've been called into
[11:01] liberty so you're free
[11:03] but don't take that don't take advantage
[11:05] of that liberty to serve yourself
[11:08] but serve one another so now you're
[11:10] you're supposed to respect and regard
[11:11] somebody else in even how you conduct
[11:14] yourself well i may have the right to do
[11:15] it but how may this right infringe upon
[11:17] somebody else's
[11:19] comfort level or what they uh what would
[11:21] be respectful to them
[11:23] in other words as we mentioned before
[11:25] paul is saying don't always take the
[11:26] liberty
[11:28] i have the liberty well i'm just going
[11:29] to take the liberty i believe we ask the
[11:31] question
[11:32] of just because we can should we
[11:35] and we should never take advantage of
[11:37] somebody or defraud somebody
[11:40] in in in the moment of the opportunity
[11:42] we have to do it and then justify the
[11:44] ends like well it's going to work out
[11:46] for the good like could you imagine all
[11:48] this stuff we could do well all things
[11:50] work together for the good
[11:51] right
[11:52] and so it's kind of calling out that
[11:54] attitude that lacks the wisdom
[11:56] to see things how they might unfold so
[11:58] he's saying don't don't always just
[12:00] because you can give somebody a piece of
[12:02] your mind
[12:03] i don't always just uh be kind of the
[12:05] bull in a china closet
[12:07] because you can't you can do it and it's
[12:10] it's expressing this idea don't let your
[12:12] liberty be let liberty be somebody
[12:14] else's bondage
[12:16] though we might be able to justify it
[12:17] through liberty and justify it because i
[12:19] can and justify it because it's my right
[12:21] or however we might justify it he said
[12:23] let's not use our liberty solely to
[12:25] serve ourselves but to consider one
[12:27] another
[12:29] and when paul is
[12:31] identifying the biting the devouring and
[12:33] even i realize i'm drawing it from a
[12:34] larger context from the scripture he's
[12:36] dealing with temperance which temperance
[12:38] is self-control
[12:40] and it's the ability the power to
[12:42] restrain desires the power to uh
[12:45] restrain passions
[12:46] and you it's described in a person who
[12:48] should have be a city with walls
[12:51] a city without walls
[12:52] a man who cannot control himself is like
[12:54] a city without walls and broken down
[12:56] paul is paul is saying that we ought to
[12:57] be cities with walls that the scripture
[13:00] says that better is a man who can
[13:01] control himself than a man who can tear
[13:03] down a wall we need to be the stronger
[13:04] people
[13:05] we need to be the stronger person
[13:07] and temperance relates to the power to
[13:10] control the tongue
[13:11] we'll recognize that through the
[13:12] teaching of the message of the hour and
[13:14] since it relates very generally to
[13:16] self-control
[13:17] uh and but also to how we speak
[13:19] temperance regards not only physical
[13:21] boundaries but also the emotional ones
[13:25] and it is our and i want to be very uh
[13:30] very purposeful in what i'm about to say
[13:33] our words and our actions because can be
[13:36] agents of harm or health
[13:39] what we say and what we do can either
[13:42] cause hurt
[13:44] continue to hurt or it can promote
[13:46] healing or bring health as we use those
[13:48] scriptures last time
[13:50] and we ought knowing that our words have
[13:52] the ability to breach a spirit knowing
[13:54] that the tongue can be a tree of life
[13:56] knowing that our actions can either
[13:58] promote healing kind words can bring
[14:00] healing certain things can bring healing
[14:01] other things can bring sickness knowing
[14:03] that then self-control moderates that
[14:06] power for its best use
[14:10] and we're
[14:11] in looking at just because we can we
[14:13] have the right should we we use the
[14:15] example of marriage
[14:17] and now that there's this perversion of
[14:18] the headship of the man over the home to
[14:20] where he kind of looks at his wife is
[14:22] his property and so since you're my
[14:24] property you can do you do whatever i
[14:26] ask you to do
[14:28] and there's a very unhealthy uh
[14:30] relationship that exists in that dynamic
[14:32] so we were looking at the example of
[14:34] marriage and identifying how that mutual
[14:36] respect is the key
[14:38] that to have the mutual respect it's the
[14:40] key to fellowship it's a key to intimacy
[14:43] it's a key to a good relationship
[14:45] when there's mutual respect a husband
[14:47] could have all of his needs met in a
[14:48] marriage just purely out of fear
[14:51] not respect
[14:52] purely because the wife is in a
[14:53] co-dependent relationship and so the
[14:56] the dishes need to be washed the meals
[14:57] need to be cooked the the bed needs to
[14:59] be made and she's like what am i going
[15:01] to do if he leaves me there's kind of
[15:02] this abandonment so out of fear of
[15:04] abandonment a man can have all his needs
[15:06] met but that's not a real relationship
[15:09] and and key in on this because this is
[15:11] the i could have just as easily called
[15:13] this sermon respect uh um something
[15:15] about relationship because it's so much
[15:17] about relationship
[15:18] a relationship when we talk about words
[15:20] can either hurt or harm actions to
[15:22] either hurt or harm
[15:24] or hurt or heal
[15:26] in either one it's the relationship
[15:29] that's going to determine the contact
[15:31] context of our words or actions
[15:34] somebody may do something to somebody
[15:36] else and we may view it as being a
[15:38] tremendous offense but to that person
[15:40] whom they've done it to it it may be
[15:42] something that's completely benign and
[15:43] there's nothing no nothing loaded in it
[15:45] there's nothing disrespectful but maybe
[15:47] through our own prism our own experience
[15:49] we may see that and say oh well how
[15:51] could they treat somebody that way and
[15:53] it's because the relationship gives
[15:54] context to what is said and what is done
[15:58] and it's what's going to determine what
[15:59] is appropriate
[16:01] there may be something that you feel
[16:02] like you can say to anybody but it may
[16:03] not be appropriate to just anybody it
[16:05] may be appropriate to somebody in
[16:07] context but not appropriate to somebody
[16:09] else in a different context
[16:11] and brother reggie spoke in our little
[16:13] youth meeting we had sunday evening
[16:16] on repentance makes way for fellowship
[16:19] and it was very beautiful
[16:21] the way that he expressed it
[16:23] and how that it's through the act of
[16:25] repenting that it produces and brings
[16:27] the reconciliation or it's going to
[16:29] bring forth the relationship
[16:31] and he was looking at it from the
[16:32] standpoint of the first fruits of
[16:33] repenting and doing what one ought to
[16:36] when they're convicted of sin but it's
[16:38] in that repentance to change mind to
[16:40] regard something
[16:43] it leads it leads makes way for
[16:45] fellowship because the fellowship is
[16:47] what promotes and nurtures relationship
[16:50] and it's a very important concept i hope
[16:53] maybe can be expressed a little bit more
[16:56] and we used psalm 25 verse 14
[17:00] and this is
[17:01] important to have right before us
[17:02] tonight the secret of the lord is with
[17:04] them that fear him
[17:06] and he will show them his covenant
[17:09] this is a
[17:11] an astounding prophecy for the time that
[17:14] we're living in
[17:16] yet we can bring it down to a personal
[17:18] level the seeker the lord is with them
[17:19] that fear him so if you fear the lord
[17:21] have this respect and deference to him
[17:24] then his secret will be with you but it
[17:26] begins with that respect so once the
[17:28] respect is established once the
[17:29] relationship's being established his
[17:31] secret is with you and he will then show
[17:33] you through that relationship his
[17:35] covenant
[17:36] so where there is mutual respect there's
[17:38] relationship
[17:40] where there's mutual respect there's
[17:41] fellowship there's relationship and it's
[17:43] in the context of that relationship that
[17:45] there's intimacy and that there's going
[17:46] to be true fellowship
[17:48] so if the relationships if the respect's
[17:50] not there the things that may be said
[17:52] and done
[17:54] they're not going to hit the mark
[17:57] if you don't have the relationship you
[17:59] might say well i'm i'm the dad i should
[18:02] be able to say it but if you haven't
[18:03] developed a relationship with your
[18:05] children in 40 years it may not be time
[18:07] to speak up
[18:08] you can't just say well i'm the dad i
[18:10] can say whatever i want no
[18:12] have you established relationship
[18:14] and you'll find that the teaching we
[18:16] receive from the message of the hours
[18:17] children begin to enter into their teen
[18:18] years pray for me that the relationship
[18:21] changes to where you begin to be more of
[18:22] a friend
[18:24] right why because the relationship
[18:26] always needs to be there
[18:28] because that's what's gonna form the
[18:30] context for help
[18:32] it can't always just be pointing to the
[18:33] fact i'm the dad i'm the mom i'm the
[18:35] head i'm the boss no there has to be
[18:37] some fellowship there has to be a mutual
[18:39] respect if it's gonna be productive
[18:42] so
[18:43] now stepping further barriers
[18:46] are artificial boundaries
[18:49] a barrier wants to present itself as a
[18:51] boundary but in fact it is what it is
[18:53] it's a barrier
[18:54] and barriers then become the context for
[18:57] forced relationships
[18:59] a barrier is going to force either
[19:01] separation or it's going to force a
[19:03] connection or force some sort of
[19:04] interaction
[19:06] uh that
[19:07] produces a shallow artificial
[19:09] relationship
[19:11] relationships that are fraught with
[19:13] barriers are shallow
[19:15] relationships that are fraught with
[19:16] barriers are usually forced and there's
[19:18] a coercion there's abuse and
[19:19] manipulation
[19:20] so barriers are artificial boundaries
[19:22] but boundaries are the true limits
[19:24] where there's boundaries there's
[19:26] personal identification where there's
[19:28] boundaries there's personal
[19:29] responsibility that that you understand
[19:32] and you know what what you must take
[19:34] care of and where there's
[19:35] uh boundaries exist and clearly defined
[19:37] relationships
[19:40] if anybody's thinking about starting a
[19:41] company and having a lot of employees
[19:42] you better have boundaries
[19:45] so that people aren't stepping on one
[19:46] another's toes and so everyone
[19:47] understands the part that they've got to
[19:49] play and so boundaries are are part of
[19:51] clearly defined relationships and is and
[19:54] it's those boundaries that are going to
[19:56] clearly define who you are going to
[19:57] clearly identify what your
[19:58] responsibility is and is going to help
[20:01] distinguish delineate between
[20:02] responsibilities and identity and that's
[20:05] how you can have relationship
[20:07] if we were all just sharing a jail cell
[20:09] tonight we would get along by force
[20:13] right and we'd have to start using
[20:15] different elements of psychology to
[20:16] figure out well i i have been when we
[20:18] talk about drawing a bigger circle some
[20:20] of us just think that means putting one
[20:21] another in a cage together
[20:23] and so we got to figure out a way to get
[20:24] along we got to figure out a way to do
[20:25] this got to figure out a way to i need
[20:27] to figure out a way to survive tonight
[20:28] because i'm in a i'm in a cage with a
[20:30] lot of ruthless people
[20:32] and i want to make it till the morning
[20:33] that's not relationship
[20:36] but where someone has a distinct
[20:38] boundary and someone is comfortable with
[20:40] their boundaries and they're calling in
[20:41] then there's a way that those people can
[20:43] begin to interact in a respectful way to
[20:46] produce that three-fold cord
[20:49] to produce uh that continuity and
[20:51] harmony that's going to allow the church
[20:53] of god to rise above any challenge
[20:56] and so those barriers must be respected
[20:59] and this is my thesis if not
[21:02] there is a relational consequence
[21:06] so barriers produce shallow
[21:08] relationships so those things can be
[21:09] just shifted around and it's just going
[21:11] to stay shallow
[21:12] but where where there you want to have
[21:14] true continuity and true fellowship it's
[21:16] in the violation the movement and the
[21:18] disrespecting of boundaries that have a
[21:20] relational consequence
[21:22] there's a cost to a relationship when a
[21:25] boundary is neither set nor respected
[21:29] pride paradox setting limits love has
[21:31] limits all of those were all about
[21:32] respecting boundaries
[21:35] god's boundaries must be respected
[21:38] right we have to respect god's
[21:39] boundaries if we don't respect god's
[21:41] boundaries there's consequences it's the
[21:44] most basic simple teaching uh
[21:47] that we could even bring out of the
[21:48] scripture in the very beginning god took
[21:50] chaos established order and said there's
[21:51] consequences if it's violated and so the
[21:53] very first lesson we get in scripture is
[21:55] hey if you out go outside of god's
[21:57] boundary of his word brother and said
[21:58] there's nothing left but judgment
[22:00] so we must respect god's boundaries or
[22:02] there's consequences
[22:04] and the word teaches us it admonishes us
[22:07] and it's very clear in a number of
[22:08] different contexts that we must
[22:10] we must establish boundaries and we must
[22:12] be very zealous to defend them
[22:17] not necessarily separate from truth but
[22:19] in harmony with the purpose of god
[22:21] and then it teaches us how to handle
[22:23] those who disrespect them are you still
[22:26] with me
[22:28] because this is where it gets gooder
[22:30] gets even more applicable first
[22:32] corinthians chapter 5 9-13
[22:35] we've been all over the book of
[22:36] corinthians first and second corinthians
[22:38] there's such a beautiful continuity
[22:39] amongst all the different statements
[22:41] that are being made
[22:43] and in first corinthians chapter 5
[22:45] verses 9 to 13
[22:49] i love how god just gives you the
[22:50] liberty to speak
[22:52] speak plainly
[22:54] and he says this in first corinthians
[22:56] chapter 5 verses 9 to 13 i wrote unto
[22:58] you in an epistle not to company with
[23:00] fornicators
[23:02] and a company speaks of personal it's
[23:04] more personal
[23:05] uh we were talking about thieves llc
[23:07] well maybe you don't want to be a
[23:09] partner with the thief
[23:10] but this is now you said you don't want
[23:11] to have company with a fornicator he
[23:14] said i wrote to you before you don't
[23:15] have to have company of fornicators and
[23:17] it speaks of a more of intimate conduct
[23:19] not that you wouldn't have
[23:21] any association whatsoever but it speaks
[23:23] to something personal
[23:25] uh there's there's a meaning behind that
[23:29] yet not all together with the
[23:30] fornicators of this world now what do
[23:32] you mean brother paul or with the
[23:34] covetous or extortioners or with the
[23:36] idolaters of this world for then must ye
[23:38] needs go out of the world right
[23:41] if we were not to have company
[23:43] with uh uh with fornicators and those
[23:45] are their covetous extortioners idolatry
[23:47] then we would just like take us out of
[23:49] here
[23:50] wins the next rocket ship to space put
[23:52] me on the moon we'll form the first
[23:53] colony but he's all be believers who
[23:56] aren't extortioners you know
[23:57] he's saying we'd have to just leave this
[23:58] world he says but now
[24:00] if you think he was going to liberate
[24:02] you to where it's like you know what you
[24:04] can't avoid them so hang out with them
[24:06] gets even tighter but now i've written
[24:08] unto you not to keep company
[24:10] same word if if any or this one is
[24:13] speaking to that uh to mix to to be
[24:16] personal intimate with if any man
[24:18] in a fellowship relationship context not
[24:20] necessarily carnal knowledge or a
[24:22] physicality if any man that is called a
[24:25] brother don't keep company with anybody
[24:28] that has called a brother and they are a
[24:29] fornicator covetous an idolater a
[24:33] a drunkard or an extortioner
[24:36] with such an one no not to eat don't
[24:39] keep company with a brother who is a
[24:42] fornicator or as covetous or a dollar
[24:44] tree or or a drunkard or an
[24:45] extortioner with such a one no not to
[24:47] eat which would have been more of a
[24:49] close fellowship
[24:50] and and akin to what the jews would have
[24:53] understood under their law conduct that
[24:54] would have been forbidden under the law
[24:56] but what i then this is
[24:58] uh him explaining for what have i to do
[25:01] to judge them also that are without
[25:05] do not ye judge them that are within
[25:09] but them that are without god judgeth
[25:12] therefore put away from among yourselves
[25:15] that wicked person
[25:17] all right let's all agree that's that's
[25:19] pretty heavy right
[25:20] that if somehow somebody who's called a
[25:22] brother is a fornicator coverages
[25:24] idolater rail or drunken or an
[25:25] extortioner we can't keep company with
[25:27] them we can't sit down to eat with them
[25:29] and then he goes so far as to say put
[25:30] away that person from among yourselves
[25:33] now before we just come up with the oh
[25:35] here's a rule all right this is the rule
[25:37] we got to do this
[25:38] we want to ask ourselves why
[25:41] what is paul hitting that why would he
[25:43] have this uh this standard
[25:46] and to also consider what underlying
[25:49] issue paul is addressing
[25:51] when he says don't keep company don't
[25:53] sit down to eat put them away from
[25:55] yourselves
[25:56] because there is a principle that paul
[25:58] is looking at
[25:59] and there's something some overarching
[26:01] theme something that's very very
[26:03] important and he's kind of looking at
[26:04] that and saying that with if these
[26:06] things are working to undermine this
[26:08] then you've got to take appropriate
[26:10] measures to be very very zealous to
[26:12] protect this
[26:14] and if you look at the characteristics
[26:16] of this brother
[26:17] who is an idolater a fornicator obtains
[26:21] things by force is greedy loudly insults
[26:25] is unreasonably influenced or
[26:26] intoxicated or drunkard this is the way
[26:28] he's describing this person that you
[26:30] need to say wait a minute
[26:32] is this the kind of person i need to be
[26:33] close with
[26:35] idolater
[26:36] somebody's uh there there's a specific
[26:39] application that fornicator who's
[26:40] someone who's forceful obtains things by
[26:42] force somebody who's greedy somebody
[26:44] who's a railing loudly insults just uh
[26:46] speaks their mind critically a is a
[26:48] drunkard
[26:50] and i would say that each one of these
[26:52] is marked by boundary violations
[26:55] whether it be idolatry violating a
[26:57] boundary of god or e a person's it's an
[26:59] offensive each one of these is a conduct
[27:01] that either offends god or a person
[27:06] does it say anything of somebody who
[27:08] uh uh is
[27:11] acting separate from some offense that
[27:14] either harms god
[27:16] or harms a person
[27:20] now i'm jumping right into i'm just
[27:21] going to get right into it why would
[27:22] paul ask that
[27:23] proverbs chapter 22 verses 24 to 25
[27:27] make no friendship with an angry man
[27:31] and with the furious man thou shalt not
[27:33] go
[27:34] why
[27:35] let's thou learn his ways and get a
[27:37] snare to thy soul
[27:39] paul has just said that if somebody's a
[27:41] they're a a complainer they're
[27:43] covetous they're an extortioner they're
[27:45] an idolater then then don't keep company
[27:47] with that brother because brother is
[27:49] going to be a context uh uh to get close
[27:54] you know what a con man is it's a
[27:55] confidence man first they win your
[27:57] confidence some of us are given
[27:59] confidence just based upon our
[28:00] confession oh your brother i can get
[28:03] close to you and he say listen if anyone
[28:05] is an extortioner
[28:06] a
[28:07] covetous an idolater a rail or a
[28:09] drunkard any one of these things he's
[28:10] saying that you should separate yourself
[28:12] and and put away that wicked person from
[28:14] among you because
[28:17] you should not make a friendship with an
[28:19] angry man nor should you go and be
[28:21] partner with a man who is furious
[28:23] because his conduct will influence you
[28:27] you will learn his ways and get a snare
[28:29] to thy soul
[28:32] there is an influence there's an impact
[28:33] by these behaviors there's an influence
[28:35] there's an impact by this conduct you
[28:37] either learn those ways or they'll trap
[28:39] you in your mind
[28:41] you'll either learn them or they'll
[28:43] become a snare or a trap in your heart
[28:45] so whether it be proverbs or paul it's
[28:47] rebuking behavior that is aggressively
[28:50] disrespectful
[28:53] because though it's a minority it can
[28:54] influence the whole
[28:56] because isn't that what levin does
[28:59] though it may be small in quantity
[29:02] it works to to invade the whole lump
[29:06] and in this way maybe i'm using some
[29:08] buzz words we ought to be intolerant of
[29:10] the disrespectful
[29:14] because disrespect breeds more
[29:16] disrespect
[29:18] and that's what paul is saying you got
[29:20] to stop somewhere
[29:22] because if you allow the word of god to
[29:24] be disrespected and you allow yourself
[29:25] to be disrespected there's no end to the
[29:27] disrespect that will result from it
[29:31] have any of the mathematicians here i
[29:33] know we're heavy on the math minds
[29:34] tonight
[29:35] looking out upon the congregation ever
[29:37] heard of the mathematical principle of
[29:39] renormalization
[29:41] and statistics okay we've got one
[29:43] so they've taken this concept of
[29:44] renormalization and they begin to apply
[29:46] it in a broader context to context to
[29:49] social issues and different things
[29:51] and
[29:51] in that way
[29:53] in so much maybe taking the
[29:54] extrapolating the mathematical principle
[29:57] looking at from the social standpoint
[29:59] this is just my the way i've tried to
[30:00] digest it and distill it down
[30:02] renormalization occurs when a group
[30:05] will appease an individual in order to
[30:08] avoid certain costs
[30:10] so it's like well we'll all change what
[30:12] we're going to do
[30:13] just so that we don't bother that we
[30:15] don't get trouble from this person let's
[30:18] say that all of us tonight really really
[30:19] like it cold but we found out so and so
[30:22] was coming so we turned the air
[30:23] conditioner off because you know how
[30:25] they can be when it gets cold
[30:27] right and so everybody just puts up with
[30:29] the heat and that's renormalization
[30:32] when for a very small minority the it
[30:35] kind of pervades the entire group and
[30:37] some of the examples i believe they use
[30:38] in the social context is when in a
[30:40] family there's somebody who is gluten
[30:42] free or non-gmo and it's just one person
[30:44] so that the family assimilates to honor
[30:47] and respect this non-gmo person within
[30:49] the family so the family itself will no
[30:51] longer have any gmo in their diet but
[30:53] then when that family goes to a larger
[30:55] family picnic the extended family is
[30:57] like oh wait a minute that part of the
[30:59] family doesn't do this so let's not have
[31:01] any non-gmo in at the picnic and then
[31:03] what happens eventually everyone's
[31:06] right
[31:07] eating kosher
[31:13] and the principle that is pointed to in
[31:15] this is eventually the disrespectful
[31:17] eventually the intolerant maybe the
[31:18] boisterous the the ones that paul
[31:20] is identifying here will eventually
[31:22] overwhelm the silent majority
[31:25] and notice that it's the silent majority
[31:28] that gets overwhelmed
[31:31] and so where there is no respect for
[31:33] boundaries
[31:35] you'll either assimilate
[31:37] or you'll be oppressed
[31:41] where there's no respect for boundaries
[31:43] you either need to become a boundary
[31:44] breaker or you you're going to be
[31:46] oppressed
[31:49] now i was going to save this statement
[31:50] for the end
[31:52] but i want to read it now
[31:54] and so it's and if you want to take that
[31:56] as your cue that you can just leave
[31:57] because i got to the end
[31:59] so be it
[32:00] but in your mouth and the message is
[32:01] your life worthy of the gospel this will
[32:04] just take everything and i think it'll
[32:05] just kind of slingshot us to the end
[32:08] very quickly brother man says don't fuss
[32:10] is your life worthy of the gospel don't
[32:12] fuss when the family gets in a fuss
[32:14] don't fuss with them
[32:17] your mother said i ain't having you go
[32:19] up there that old church anymore well
[32:21] you all think about that you all think
[32:24] about now you're letting your hair grow
[32:26] out you look like some old grandma don't
[32:27] fuss with her
[32:29] you notice those comments those biting
[32:30] comments
[32:32] he's like don't fuss with her
[32:35] say okay mother
[32:37] it's all right i love you just the same
[32:39] and i'll be praying for you as long as i
[32:41] live
[32:42] now don't fuss
[32:44] temper breeds temper
[32:47] notice the conduct of the mother and we
[32:49] need to be careful there sometimes
[32:50] because we see our children acting
[32:51] childish so that we want them to see how
[32:53] they're acting and so we respond or we
[32:55] get frustrated we respond in a childish
[32:56] way and just what happens we're just all
[32:58] being childish and the kid hasn't
[32:59] figured out what maturity is yet
[33:01] right well i hit them they hit me i
[33:03] guess we hit each other when we don't
[33:04] like what someone else is doing
[33:06] so they just repeat the cycle
[33:08] and so he said temper breeds temper
[33:11] when the mother is being catty when the
[33:13] mother's doing the things that are
[33:14] offensive when the mother's doing her
[33:16] part if you respond in kind you've just
[33:18] given birth to her spirit
[33:20] now it just gets it it becomes a dynamo
[33:23] temper breeds temper remember what paul
[33:26] told us to do in those situations he
[33:28] says it recognize the detrimental impact
[33:30] that a person can have upon you your
[33:32] spirit don't be friends with an angry
[33:34] man don't go with the furious because
[33:35] you'll either learn his ways or become a
[33:37] snare to your spirit this is this is in
[33:39] practice now brother says temper breeds
[33:41] temper first thing you know you grieve
[33:43] the holy spirit away from you you'll be
[33:44] fussing back
[33:46] then the holy spirit takes its flight
[33:49] temper breeds temper and love breeds
[33:51] love be full of love
[33:53] jesus says this will all men know you
[33:55] are my disciples when you have loved one
[33:57] for another that's the fruit of the holy
[33:59] spirit love
[34:01] and did you know you're a little creator
[34:02] yourself you know that certainly
[34:05] you've seen people you just love to be
[34:07] around you don't know why
[34:09] just love that that just that loving
[34:11] type of person have you seen that just
[34:13] as kind there you you like to be around
[34:16] them they create that atmosphere by the
[34:19] life they live the way they talk their
[34:22] conversation
[34:24] then maybe not a lot of amens but this
[34:27] could maybe be the doorbuster here then
[34:29] you've seen those that every time you
[34:31] shun them
[34:32] all time they want to talk about
[34:34] something evil and talk about somebody
[34:36] say oh my there they come they're going
[34:38] to criticize somebody there he's in here
[34:40] now he's going to talk about this man
[34:42] and they're going to do this and tell
[34:44] dirty jokes or something about women or
[34:45] something like that you just hate to get
[34:48] around them
[34:49] they create then he says seemingly
[34:52] pretty nice people but they create that
[34:54] atmosphere and the things that you think
[34:57] on and and he's kind of summarizing now
[34:59] the things that you think on the things
[35:01] that you do the actions the things you
[35:03] talk about creates an atmosphere
[35:07] and
[35:08] and he uses something that kind of gets
[35:10] all of our attention we can immediately
[35:11] begin to relate that yes i know there's
[35:13] people that i really enjoy being around
[35:15] i can be myself i i i can be open with
[35:18] them it's a
[35:20] and i and i love those kind of people
[35:21] and then we can immediately think of
[35:22] people they're seemingly nice but yet
[35:24] there's just something about the way
[35:26] that they act the way that they talk the
[35:27] way that they live and you're not
[35:29] jumping at the opportunity to be with
[35:30] them
[35:32] i said because we're all creators one
[35:34] person is created in a positive
[35:35] environment another person has created a
[35:37] negative environment environment and he
[35:39] uses that to substantiate the principle
[35:42] of don't fuss don't mix it up don't get
[35:45] entangled because whatever spirit you're
[35:47] being confronted with if you don't
[35:49] address it properly it'll only breed the
[35:51] same thing in you because temper breeds
[35:54] temper
[35:56] disrespect breeds disrespect
[36:01] and and that statement to me is just so
[36:03] powerful
[36:04] so let's let's back up
[36:06] in what paul is saying because he's just
[36:08] made some very uh incredible instruction
[36:11] hey don't keep company with the brother
[36:12] who are these things
[36:14] who is these things
[36:16] and put away from among yourselves that
[36:18] wicked person
[36:19] now that's
[36:20] very forceful but again we want to
[36:22] understand it in context so let's drop
[36:24] back to verse 1. we just read 9-13 we're
[36:27] going to read verse 1. if you're like
[36:28] hey wait a minute you did it out of
[36:29] order it just seemed to serve serve this
[36:31] better to do it that way
[36:34] it is reported commonly that there is
[36:35] fornication among you and such
[36:37] fornication is not so much as named
[36:39] among the gentiles that one should have
[36:41] his father's wife he's saying even the
[36:43] gentiles would blush at your conduct
[36:46] now we could spend a lot of time maybe
[36:48] drilling down on that but notice really
[36:51] what's this issue is their response
[36:55] i i mean we could just we could almost
[36:56] put it in the sense that well that's
[36:58] never going to happen so this is a
[37:00] one-off this is an outlier but what paul
[37:02] really takes exception to is their
[37:04] response to it
[37:06] you're puffed up
[37:09] and have not rather mourned that he that
[37:11] had done this deed might be taken away
[37:13] from among you
[37:15] like the the way that you've responded
[37:19] has not addressed the situation properly
[37:22] he says you're puffed up you should have
[37:23] mourned and then he gets then he kind of
[37:26] uh gets very forceful for i barely as
[37:28] absent in body but present in spirit
[37:30] have judged already i didn't even need
[37:32] to be there
[37:34] as though i were present concerning him
[37:36] that hath so done this deed in the name
[37:39] of our lord jesus christ when you are
[37:41] gathered together in my spirit with the
[37:43] power of our lord jesus christ okay paul
[37:47] to deliver such a one unto satan for the
[37:50] destruction of the flesh that the spirit
[37:53] may be saved in the day of the lord
[37:55] jesus
[37:57] paul is saying that this is a sin that's
[37:59] amongst you that is an embarrassment and
[38:01] it's a shame
[38:02] you've been puffed up instead of a
[38:04] mourning and addressing it properly and
[38:07] he says i've been able to judge this
[38:09] from afar and so he tells them what they
[38:10] ought to do the next time they gather
[38:12] now he's specifically referring to this
[38:14] offense and he says the next time you
[38:16] get together deliver this person unto
[38:19] satan for the destruction of the flesh
[38:22] not that the person would be completely
[38:24] and totally destroyed but that the
[38:26] spirit may be saved in the day of the
[38:28] lord jesus
[38:29] so now
[38:30] the ultimate goal is salvation
[38:33] not shame
[38:35] not protection of their own testimonies
[38:37] and boy we got to look out after how we
[38:38] look and and in the pretense he says no
[38:41] so that the spirit may be saved in the
[38:42] day of lord jesus and he says your glory
[38:44] and is not good
[38:47] and then this is the principle we all so
[38:49] often hear know you not that a little
[38:51] leaven leaveth the whole love
[38:53] why was it so important to address this
[38:55] conduct why was it so important to have
[38:56] the right attitude towards it not so
[38:58] that you could show off as being
[39:00] somebody who can be heavy-handed not so
[39:01] that you could be the one oh you know
[39:03] what we really dealt with this we really
[39:04] know how to do that he's saying eleven
[39:06] leaveneth
[39:07] it corrupts no you're not that a little
[39:09] eleven eleventh the whole one purge out
[39:11] therefore the old living that ye may be
[39:12] a new lump as you're unleavened
[39:18] for even christ our passover
[39:21] is sacrificed for us therefore let us
[39:24] keep the feast not with the old leaven
[39:26] neither with the leaven of malice and
[39:28] wickedness this is what he's dealing
[39:29] with this leaven of malice and weakness
[39:31] but with the unleavened bread of
[39:33] sincerity and truth
[39:36] now without being dismissive of the
[39:39] actual scenario and the context of the
[39:41] things that paul is saying
[39:44] the whole purpose of addressing sin
[39:48] the whole purpose of addressing this
[39:50] transgression
[39:52] against
[39:53] in this family context as he said that
[39:55] one should have his father's wife
[39:58] the whole purpose of addressing this is
[40:00] to stop the spread of sin
[40:04] the whole purpose of identifying and
[40:06] dealing with was to stop the spread of
[40:07] unbelief to say that's not right what
[40:09] happens if something goes unchecked what
[40:11] goes what happens if we don't have the
[40:12] right regard for it so paul is
[40:14] advocating in this case for strong
[40:16] protection for strong response he's
[40:18] advocating for the walls of protection
[40:21] to be put about the city if you want to
[40:22] look at the context of the church he's
[40:24] saying listen we ought to have the right
[40:26] attitude towards this we have to fortify
[40:28] our strengths we ought to fortify our
[40:30] walls and we ought to have the right
[40:32] attitude towards this sin as david when
[40:35] he was caught in his sins said all build
[40:37] up thou the walls of jerusalem likewise
[40:39] this church ought to have seen this and
[40:41] said we need to build strong walls we
[40:43] need to have parameters we need to have
[40:45] boundaries we need to respect the word
[40:47] of god we need to respect the house of
[40:49] god we need to do that not only for the
[40:52] sake of us but for the saving of that
[40:54] soul
[40:57] the truth we recognize this through the
[41:00] the abundance of scripture that implores
[41:02] us to do it we must be available to help
[41:04] someone in their need
[41:06] we must be gracious we must be kind we
[41:09] must be considerate who is thy neighbor
[41:12] which one was neighbor to the one that
[41:13] had been befallen by thieves and we
[41:15] realized well we have a duty to humanity
[41:17] we have a duty to those who are agreed
[41:19] we have a duty to help out but this does
[41:21] not make us available to enable every
[41:24] detriment
[41:26] it does not make us available to enable
[41:28] uh to participate in compromise or to
[41:31] help somebody who's conducting
[41:33] themselves in a detrimental way or a way
[41:35] that transgresses god's word
[41:38] how else are you really respecting
[41:39] somebody when you're enabling them
[41:42] we must have respect for each other
[41:45] we must have respect for boundaries
[41:48] we must have respect for sincerity and
[41:50] truth
[41:51] he's saying that we ought to keep the
[41:53] feast with the unleavened bread of
[41:55] sincerity and truth this is all within
[41:57] the context of him saying
[41:59] that you should deliver this one in this
[42:01] instance to the to satan for the
[42:02] destruction of his flesh that a spirit
[42:04] may be saved and your glory is not good
[42:06] don't you realize a little leaven
[42:07] leaveneth the whole lump and i wrote to
[42:09] you before saying don't keep company
[42:10] with those in the world who are
[42:12] fornicators but you know what i'm
[42:13] writing on you to not keep company with
[42:14] a man who's called a brother
[42:17] who does the same thing
[42:20] why because 11 leaveneth
[42:22] temper breeds temper
[42:25] disrespect breeds disrespect
[42:27] the wrong kind of behavior over time can
[42:29] be renormalized
[42:32] and then what happens you show up and
[42:33] you see it because you're an outsider
[42:34] you're like oh my goodness
[42:36] what is going on
[42:38] this is crazy but everybody on the
[42:40] inside is kinda like hey no this is this
[42:42] is the way we love one another right
[42:44] it's just kind of been renormalized over
[42:46] time well that's just the way we
[42:47] function that's just the way that we
[42:49] that we act and the people who are kind
[42:51] of caught up in the middle of it have
[42:52] renormalized and they don't recognize
[42:54] how incrementally they've strayed from
[42:57] the proper conduct that is becoming of a
[43:00] christian
[43:05] we address
[43:06] offenses since i even practiced preface
[43:09] this
[43:10] with how not only does the word tell us
[43:12] we have to set boundaries but it also
[43:13] teaches us how to handle those who don't
[43:15] respect them
[43:16] again you may say well this is very
[43:18] self-serving you're putting these
[43:19] scriptures in the context of boundaries
[43:20] well
[43:23] okay
[43:24] we can change the words if you want but
[43:26] paul is talking about somebody who's
[43:27] done something wrong
[43:29] and tells how to handle it
[43:32] and we address offenses transgressions
[43:34] against god's word things that
[43:35] personally offend us
[43:37] we address offenses as a way of
[43:40] establishing
[43:41] truth
[43:44] we we do this as a way of defending
[43:47] truth
[43:49] because paul says it that we ought to
[43:50] keep the feast getting rid of the leaven
[43:52] of malice and wickedness but keep the
[43:54] feast with the bread of sincerity and
[43:56] truth in other words we do this as a way
[43:58] of shedding the pretense
[44:01] this is we're not just
[44:03] we're not forced into fellowship here
[44:05] we're not all just gathering as those
[44:07] who've been i got the i go to jail card
[44:09] and here we are we just found ourselves
[44:10] at the corner of this board game on a
[44:12] wednesday night this is not forced it's
[44:14] something where we're shedding pretense
[44:16] and in doing so the pretense are all the
[44:19] barriers
[44:21] he says keep the feast
[44:23] the unliving bread of sincerity there's
[44:24] no pretense in this it's not the shallow
[44:27] relation it's keeping the feast where
[44:28] we're not all just doing it playing
[44:30] church but there's some true harmony
[44:32] true respect you are in your place and i
[44:34] respect it i'm in mind and i respect
[44:36] that and we're all working together in
[44:38] harmony and who we are and not some sort
[44:39] of forced unity
[44:42] which is the spirit of the day
[44:44] right the spirit of the day is forced
[44:45] unity
[44:47] so paul
[44:48] is he's talking about how you address an
[44:51] offense and a tough one too
[44:54] but we can gather from that
[44:56] that paul is telling us that there has
[44:58] to be a way that you can take that you
[45:00] can handle or i mean he's he's even
[45:02] taken it out of context and saying hey
[45:04] i've told you that someone claims to be
[45:05] a brother and they're a fornicator
[45:06] they're covetous they're an idolater
[45:07] they're railing a drunkard or an
[45:08] extortioner
[45:09] have no company with them
[45:13] because of the influence
[45:16] now in matthew chapter 18 i'm just going
[45:19] to read three verses
[45:21] and
[45:22] and amplify this
[45:24] for the remainder of our time this
[45:26] evening
[45:27] matthew chapter 18 verses 15 16 and 17
[45:30] moreover if thy brother shall trespass
[45:34] against thee
[45:36] to trespasses to go beyond a boundary
[45:40] that may be the terminology that we even
[45:42] recognize most often is to trespasses to
[45:44] enter unlawfully
[45:46] to enter without permission
[45:50] to enter without relationship
[45:53] are you catching this
[45:55] more of a if i brother do something
[45:57] inappropriate because it doesn't it
[45:58] violates the context of the relationship
[46:00] it violates
[46:01] it offends
[46:03] moreover thy brother shall trespass
[46:04] against thee go and tell him
[46:07] his fault between thee and him alone one
[46:10] of the most important aspects of this is
[46:12] you first go to him
[46:14] and it's with him and him alone you
[46:16] don't have anybody else involved you're
[46:17] going straight to him
[46:19] and if he shall hear thee i'll go ahead
[46:21] and just read through it then go back
[46:22] over it if he shall hear thee thou has
[46:24] gained thy brother notice that phrase
[46:26] thou hast gained thy brother
[46:29] but if he will not hear thee then take
[46:32] with thee one or two more then in the
[46:34] mouth of two or three witnesses every
[46:35] word may be established
[46:40] and if he shall neglect to hear them so
[46:42] you've gone to them yourself
[46:45] and and yourselves alone just the two of
[46:47] you now you've gone to them with
[46:48] somebody else
[46:50] and if you neglect to hear you then
[46:52] tell it unto the
[46:54] church but if he neglect to hear the
[46:57] church so even in saying intelligent to
[46:59] the church the church then responds in
[47:01] such a way to they they bring the
[47:04] offense to the brother that they're
[47:06] going to affirm and acknowledge the
[47:07] offense bring it to the brother now he's
[47:09] not just hearing the person who's
[47:11] offended he's not just hearing the two
[47:13] people that the person who's offended
[47:14] brought now it's coming through a little
[47:16] bit different channel
[47:17] and this whole scenario right let's just
[47:19] think right now if all of a sudden i
[47:21] said all right brother west we're taking
[47:23] you before the church you need to hear
[47:24] something and we're all going to be
[47:25] sitting here going
[47:27] and you'll get it get your attention
[47:29] right
[47:30] and jesus intends for this to sound like
[47:33] an attention-getting measure it says but
[47:35] if they neglect to hear the church and
[47:37] this you say wow that escalated quickly
[47:39] let him be unto thee the person offended
[47:42] as a heathen man and a publican
[47:46] so let's go back over this if thy
[47:47] brother trespass against you it's an act
[47:50] against you or he offends you the word
[47:52] trespass in the scripture means to miss
[47:53] the mark
[47:54] he's violated something as it pertains
[47:57] to you if he's gone beyond a boundary if
[47:59] he's entered unlawfully
[48:02] if he has without permission done
[48:04] something if he has done something
[48:05] without relationship
[48:07] if he has if put in such a way to where
[48:10] it seems very subjective he's saying if
[48:12] your brother offends you
[48:14] then go to him and him alone
[48:16] and if i can say this it may seem
[48:18] putting that that way that a trespass is
[48:21] to do something without permission a
[48:22] trespass is something that offends you
[48:24] it may seem that i'm trivializing the
[48:26] conduct and then it kind of exaggerates
[48:28] the response but consider the steps and
[48:31] the recourse that jesus demands
[48:34] that's very simple if you're saying well
[48:35] so you're telling me that if i just
[48:38] happen to whip into front of somebody in
[48:39] the parking lot and park in front of
[48:41] them even though i didn't see them and
[48:42] they're all up hot bothered about that
[48:44] and i offend them we're supposed to go
[48:46] through this
[48:47] yeah i would say that fits
[48:49] because think about what jesus is
[48:51] recommending
[48:52] he's teaching us how to behave towards
[48:54] someone who's offended us and even if we
[48:56] could say
[48:58] uh uh
[48:58] you're too sensitive or whatever it
[49:00] might be teach us if you are offended if
[49:02] someone is trespassed against you
[49:04] he's teaching us
[49:07] how to address it and then he's saying
[49:09] if he won't respect you he says he's
[49:11] saying avoid him right
[49:14] and john wesley had this comment to make
[49:16] about this scripture he says jesus lays
[49:18] down a sure method of avoiding all
[49:20] offenses
[49:22] whosoever closely observes this
[49:24] three-fold rule will seldom offend
[49:26] others and never be offended himself
[49:29] okay
[49:31] let's commit this to memory right he
[49:34] said if we could somehow observe this if
[49:35] we could somehow catch this and i
[49:37] believe he's expressing the idea
[49:39] that to closely observe it would to be
[49:41] not only uh
[49:42] compliant with the letter of it but also
[49:44] in harmony with the spirit of it there
[49:46] there's something being taught here that
[49:48] if it can be quickened to us we
[49:49] recognize it then immediately we start
[49:51] looking at how that we would like
[49:53] offenses to be addressed whenever we
[49:55] experience them but now we've become
[49:57] enlightened right
[49:59] we've tasted it now we now we know how
[50:01] it feels now now we're being our eyes
[50:04] have been under we have been enlightened
[50:05] to it now it's not so much about how a
[50:08] brother should treat me when i've been
[50:10] offended but now i'm a little bit more
[50:12] cautious and observant and aware of how
[50:14] i might come off to somebody else
[50:19] and this instruction
[50:21] and i think this is especially important
[50:22] for us to recognize
[50:24] that in the way that jesus is expressing
[50:26] this the instruction is to the offended
[50:27] person if thy brother trespass against
[50:30] thee you individually go to him and you
[50:32] alone it's one individual to another
[50:34] it's an instruction to offended person
[50:37] it's not so much a rule to the church
[50:40] where this is this church has got this
[50:42] kind of in their weapon cachet and we're
[50:44] going to use it whenever we want it's
[50:45] not it's not used as a weapon it's not
[50:47] used to empower the church it's a very
[50:50] deliberate teaching to the individual
[50:52] that when you're offended you have a
[50:54] recourse that you can go to the one
[50:56] who's offended you if he won't hear you
[50:57] you can go to him with other people who
[51:00] can also
[51:01] hold them accountable and you you
[51:02] accountable and if you won't hear them
[51:04] then you're going to bring it before the
[51:05] church
[51:07] and so it's it's for the individual
[51:10] because he says then let him if he
[51:12] doesn't hear the church let him be unto
[51:14] thee
[51:15] as a heathen man and a publican
[51:18] okay are you with me
[51:20] now
[51:22] let him be unto thee
[51:24] as a heathen man and a publican
[51:27] in other words regard him as
[51:30] treat him as a heathen and a publican
[51:34] respect him as
[51:37] he then view him as consider him as
[51:42] why would he be as a heathen man and
[51:45] republican
[51:47] we know the definition of heather right
[51:52] we could put just unbeliever reprobate
[51:55] we're not even given the benefit of
[51:56] being a make believer he's an unbeliever
[51:59] and then to say as a publican
[52:02] jesus at one time was characterized as
[52:04] being a friend republican and sinners so
[52:05] that that may have some weight even in
[52:07] this subject but it's he says they are
[52:09] to be as the unto thee as a republican
[52:12] go in the scripture republicans that
[52:14] were those who had a bad testimony
[52:17] they had a reputation
[52:18] they were of poor character
[52:21] right i mean we're drawn from our bible
[52:22] knowledge
[52:24] the publicans were just those who just
[52:26] they did things for all the wrong
[52:27] reasons jesus when he's deriding them of
[52:28] how you treat one person over how you
[52:30] treat another says don't republicans do
[52:32] the same
[52:33] right not republicans don't get offended
[52:36] the publicans
[52:39] and it's oh and they're saying that this
[52:40] is just the way
[52:42] they have a demeanor they have a conduct
[52:44] they have a reputation it precedes them
[52:46] oh that's just so-and-so right that's
[52:48] just a republican
[52:50] and and jesus is saying that if you go
[52:52] through this threefold process and they
[52:54] don't respond treat them as a heathen
[52:57] man as a publican
[52:58] that's serious
[53:03] all right so walk walk with me through
[53:05] this
[53:07] i'm running out of time so i won't i
[53:09] won't maybe dramatize it
[53:12] not that i had thought of this
[53:13] tremendous beautifully embellished drama
[53:15] that i could do begin to act out
[53:18] cue the smoke brothers
[53:19] bring the lighting down
[53:21] no let's just walk through this
[53:25] you are offended a brother trespasses
[53:27] against you you go to the brother
[53:30] and tell him his fault between thee
[53:34] and him alone
[53:36] and a true believer
[53:38] a christian someone who is spiritual
[53:41] will respond to the first effort
[53:44] maybe maybe not so much initially
[53:47] but that effort in itself
[53:49] jesus is saying
[53:50] it's i i i if i want to say well i'm
[53:53] infer in it that's fine but i believe
[53:54] it's implied in the context he's saying
[53:55] you know what if you go to him and him
[53:57] alone and you know not not
[53:59] all big right
[54:01] the the approach and even i want to get
[54:02] into this maybe more sunday it's not big
[54:04] time in somebody because there's a way
[54:06] especially if you don't appreciate
[54:07] relationship you're they're never going
[54:09] to be honest with you it's not it's
[54:10] never going to work out the right way
[54:11] it's just going to be a confrontation
[54:13] but he's saying that
[54:15] if you go to him that first attempt is
[54:18] probably going to produce a oh man i
[54:20] offended you i am so sorry
[54:22] right
[54:24] and then
[54:26] if we take a step beyond that if you go
[54:28] to him and say hey man that offended me
[54:30] that i'm telling you my fault he's like
[54:32] yeah well i think you're just making a
[54:34] mountain out of a mohill
[54:36] and whatever the response might be
[54:38] when you show up with a with two other
[54:40] people
[54:42] even a professing christian would be
[54:44] moved by the second attempt right
[54:47] or at least the third
[54:50] professing christian a member of the
[54:52] community a member of the church i you
[54:53] know looks at the one brother and
[54:54] brother two and brother three and says
[54:55] you know what i'm sorry i just i don't
[54:57] feel like i need to apologize like okay
[54:58] fine then one day you get brought before
[55:01] the church
[55:02] is a somebody who's just a professing
[55:04] christian somebody who's just even a
[55:06] make believers i'm like all right i'm
[55:08] sorry
[55:10] okay
[55:11] i'm sorry
[55:13] it's implied that even a brother who's
[55:15] trying a professing brother let alone a
[55:18] true brother he's saying would it would
[55:19] not fail to listen in that moment
[55:24] so when he says if he hears that means
[55:25] he understands and acts appropriately
[55:28] use this phrase you've gained thy
[55:30] brother
[55:31] it's very important
[55:33] uh that you're that you're right close
[55:34] with me right now and if you it's
[55:37] if you feel you find yourself waning a
[55:38] little bit i say just ready yourself
[55:40] stay yourself with all that you have in
[55:41] you and focus very uh intently right now
[55:45] he says you've gained thy brother
[55:48] it has a direct has a direct meaning
[55:51] that you've actually recovered him from
[55:53] his heir
[55:55] you've rescued thy brother when you see
[55:57] a brother taken in a fault ye who are
[56:00] spiritual restore such a one through
[56:02] spirit of meekness and fear can sit in
[56:04] your own selves why do people not
[56:05] restore you there's no spiritual people
[56:07] to do it
[56:09] they just run off when you've offended
[56:11] them talking about it right
[56:13] instead of doing what jesus said and
[56:15] going to them and them alone and saying
[56:17] hey this is where the ark this is where
[56:19] the fault is this is where the
[56:20] disagreement is he says if he hears you
[56:23] you've gained a recovered thy brother
[56:25] you have rescued him from his heir
[56:29] and you say well how look at luke 17 1-2
[56:32] then said he under the disciples it is
[56:34] impossible but that offenses will come
[56:36] amen
[56:37] right we're like good because i'm
[56:38] offended all day long but woe unto him
[56:41] to whom they come oh never mind
[56:44] right we can't just say well i'm you
[56:46] know we're just defensive i have a right
[56:48] to be offensive it's my right i tried to
[56:49] offend and just get kind of caught up in
[56:51] the political rhetoric he says but woe
[56:53] unto him through whom they come
[56:55] it would were better for him that a
[56:57] millstone were hanged about his neck and
[56:59] he cast in the sea then that he should
[57:01] offend one of these little ones
[57:04] all right do you think he's being
[57:05] extreme
[57:08] is he just trying to make a point well
[57:11] perhaps but i hope you get the point
[57:14] you'd be better that you'd be have a
[57:15] millstone hung around your neck and
[57:17] you'd be cast into the sea
[57:19] than to offend
[57:21] even the smallest and the least
[57:24] and so jesus is saying that your rebuke
[57:27] may save the offender from this judgment
[57:31] because he says you tell him of your
[57:32] fault between thee and him alone when
[57:34] the brothers trespass that when you go
[57:36] to him this is getting very very to the
[57:37] heart of god now please if you could uh
[57:40] gather your your resources now
[57:43] and channel this in your heart he said
[57:44] that if you can go to him and tell him
[57:46] of this fault
[57:48] then if he hears you
[57:50] you have received him from the judgment
[57:54] and this is what strikes me
[57:56] and if you feel like i well i'll just
[57:58] say it this way do i care anymore
[58:03] maybe maybe i want to say do we care
[58:05] anymore
[58:07] that when there's been an offense
[58:09] that what jesus is saying that if you
[58:11] are a son or daughter of god where
[58:13] there's been an offense you may be hurt
[58:16] but but you have healing as your promise
[58:18] you have eternity as your destiny this
[58:21] one stands in the place of being better
[58:23] if a millstone was hung around their
[58:25] neck than to have offended you
[58:28] and then it should be uh well is there
[58:30] not some is there not some care
[58:33] and this to me just i was so resonated
[58:36] with me we you wonder why you're so
[58:38] greatly impacted when there's an offense
[58:41] you wonder why even your body bears it
[58:43] at the scars and the physiological
[58:45] breakdown of the stressors and the agony
[58:48] why do we agonize over things like this
[58:50] why does it hurt so deeply it's not just
[58:54] for our pain alone but also for their
[58:56] loss
[58:58] could it be that it's not just my body
[59:00] is saying no but it's the church body
[59:03] saying no it's the body of christ saying
[59:05] oh no don't let this person be lost in
[59:08] their arrogance don't let this person be
[59:10] lost in their pride
[59:14] so he says
[59:16] you've gained thy brother
[59:19] there is an aspect of recovering him
[59:21] from his sin
[59:26] but then there's also this aspect of
[59:27] restored fellowship
[59:30] you've secured the relationship
[59:32] because the the the scenario hey listen
[59:36] that offended me
[59:37] i don't care
[59:39] okay
[59:40] offender this is
[59:42] brother tube of the three on brother one
[59:44] you've offended me i don't care
[59:48] all right
[59:49] offender
[59:50] we the church
[59:52] want you to know that you've offended
[59:54] brother number one
[59:56] what do you say
[59:57] i don't care
[59:59] all right you're not our brother anymore
[1:00:05] right
[1:00:07] you're to be to us to this offender you
[1:00:09] are to be
[1:00:11] whether you want to look in the context
[1:00:12] of church because it's certainly implied
[1:00:13] elsewhere
[1:00:15] in other places
[1:00:17] you are to now be
[1:00:24] as a heathen man and a publican
[1:00:31] so if he hears you though
[1:00:33] you never get to that part
[1:00:35] relationship's secured
[1:00:38] position of a brother is affirmed
[1:00:42] and then that becomes the conduct
[1:00:43] context for conduct among people between
[1:00:46] people
[1:00:49] but if
[1:00:51] and i realize i've already said it and
[1:00:52] kind of looking at the inverse
[1:00:55] if him hearing you
[1:00:57] through the process gains thy brother
[1:00:59] saves him and secures the relationship
[1:01:02] if he does not hear you the reverse must
[1:01:04] be true likewise you lose a brother
[1:01:07] because you've gained thy brother but
[1:01:09] now if he's to be under thee as a
[1:01:11] heathen and a publican he's saying that
[1:01:13] you have now lost your brother
[1:01:17] there is a there is a way of brotherly
[1:01:19] fellowship that ceases
[1:01:21] there's a closeness that is lost he's
[1:01:24] saying that at one time you could
[1:01:25] fellowship under this context that you
[1:01:27] are a brother because a brother
[1:01:28] trespassed against you you went to him
[1:01:30] as a brother other brothers went to you
[1:01:32] as a brother the church within which you
[1:01:33] are part of a brotherhood went to you
[1:01:35] but now that the process has not
[1:01:37] achieved any kind of resolution or any
[1:01:39] kind of understanding or acknowledgement
[1:01:41] and affirmation on your part then we can
[1:01:43] no longer deal with you and have a
[1:01:45] relationship with you in that context
[1:01:47] everything changes do you realize where
[1:01:50] there's disrespect of boundaries there's
[1:01:52] a relational consequence
[1:02:00] it means to cease to have true christian
[1:02:02] fellowship
[1:02:04] to no longer regard him as a brother to
[1:02:05] no longer respect him as a brother
[1:02:08] we could go back to psalms 25 14 that
[1:02:11] where there is no respect there is no
[1:02:13] disclosure of personal things
[1:02:16] there's no conversation that is intimate
[1:02:19] there's no there's no sharing of things
[1:02:21] there's something that is lost in it
[1:02:25] now
[1:02:26] lest we let our pride grab a hold of
[1:02:28] that and and run with it you still own
[1:02:30] kindness
[1:02:32] you you still owe them help if they're
[1:02:34] afflicted
[1:02:37] because we are to love our enemies
[1:02:40] and to love our neighbors as ourselves
[1:02:43] so even if they are the declare declared
[1:02:45] to be your enemy you still love them
[1:02:48] too many of us are operating under sun
[1:02:50] tzu's orders
[1:02:52] of the enemy of my enemy is my friend
[1:03:03] they've shown there's a consequence
[1:03:07] it is our duty to god
[1:03:09] to draw a line
[1:03:14] but it's also our duty to the offender
[1:03:17] what if we all just kept our mouth shut
[1:03:20] what if god did the same thing
[1:03:22] well
[1:03:24] i just want to be a loving god so
[1:03:26] i don't care how they baptize i you know
[1:03:28] just i i don't it doesn't really matter
[1:03:31] to me right
[1:03:33] if god operated by that contact just
[1:03:35] think of how things would be
[1:03:37] we owe a duty to god to draw the line we
[1:03:39] owe a duty to the offender to draw the
[1:03:41] line we are all a duty to build the
[1:03:42] boundary to defend it to clearly
[1:03:44] demarcate these things
[1:03:47] notice how paul continues in first
[1:03:49] corinthians chapter six verses one to
[1:03:50] five
[1:03:52] dare any of you having a matter against
[1:03:53] another go to the law before the unjust
[1:03:55] and not before the saints
[1:04:02] this is to me
[1:04:04] informative to the process that jesus
[1:04:06] expressed notice what he says do you not
[1:04:08] know that the saints shall judge the
[1:04:10] world
[1:04:12] and if the world shall be judged by you
[1:04:14] are ye unworthy to judge the smallest
[1:04:17] matters
[1:04:19] this is this is coming down to everyday
[1:04:21] life and this subject that we've been
[1:04:23] exploring and think all this may seem
[1:04:25] petty this may seem trivial you're going
[1:04:26] to judge the whole world
[1:04:29] should we not then begin to exercise
[1:04:31] judgment in our daily lives should we
[1:04:33] not begin to learn to stand for and and
[1:04:36] to espouse the virtues of a feast with
[1:04:38] unleavened bread of sincerity and truth
[1:04:40] should we not then be able to judge the
[1:04:43] smallest matters know ye not that we
[1:04:45] shall judge angels how much more things
[1:04:47] that pertain to this life
[1:04:50] if then ye have judgments of things
[1:04:52] pertaining to this life set them to
[1:04:55] judge who are least esteemed in the
[1:04:57] church
[1:04:58] now he's really done something really
[1:05:00] clever there
[1:05:01] right because we always want it to be
[1:05:02] the pastor right the deacon look at him
[1:05:04] before the board you always want it to
[1:05:06] be like this imposing mob
[1:05:09] they said hey you got a problem let
[1:05:11] those who are least esteemed in the
[1:05:12] church he says i speak this to your
[1:05:14] shame why these people were puffed up
[1:05:17] is it so
[1:05:19] it is it so that there is not a wise man
[1:05:22] among you no not one that shall be able
[1:05:23] to judge between him his
[1:05:26] brethren
[1:05:28] so what did paul express in the prior
[1:05:30] chapter for what have i to do to judge
[1:05:32] them also that are without chapter 5
[1:05:35] do not ye judge them that are within
[1:05:38] but them that are without god judges
[1:05:40] therefore put away from among yourselves
[1:05:42] that wicked person this is the function
[1:05:45] of judging if you're going to be tasked
[1:05:47] with judging the whole world start by
[1:05:50] judging yourself
[1:05:51] start by judging properly clearly
[1:05:53] defining boundaries within your own home
[1:05:55] within your relationships because we are
[1:05:56] to judge in the smallest of matters and
[1:05:58] judge things that pertain to this life
[1:06:04] again let's come back to it why
[1:06:05] influence
[1:06:07] why why should i
[1:06:10] have any of you ever had an experience
[1:06:12] where you let it go too long
[1:06:15] and you wish you would have done
[1:06:16] something about it sooner
[1:06:19] because now
[1:06:20] there's so much momentum
[1:06:22] it's gone so far you think how in the
[1:06:24] world
[1:06:26] how in the world can i ever get this
[1:06:28] back to where it ought to be
[1:06:31] it's the influence
[1:06:34] the reason why we're asked to do these
[1:06:36] things this is very practical in these
[1:06:37] scriptures that we've read tonight
[1:06:38] whether it be first corinthians 5 and 6
[1:06:41] luke 17 or if it be matthew chapter 18
[1:06:44] these things are there
[1:06:48] and taught to us because the ability of
[1:06:49] an offense the ability of a trespass the
[1:06:52] ability of these things to oppress
[1:06:56] and the baiting nature of them is jesus
[1:06:58] says it or as paul is even expressing it
[1:07:01] the leaven leavening and then brother
[1:07:02] bran i'm zeroing it around and says
[1:07:03] temper breeds temper it's the ability
[1:07:05] for disrespect to breed to breed
[1:07:07] bitterness
[1:07:09] right
[1:07:10] remember keeping our spirits clean
[1:07:12] and how things begin to defile and
[1:07:14] corrupt and it begins to channel and
[1:07:16] pervert our behavior
[1:07:17] so jesus says in luke chapter 17 verses
[1:07:20] 1 to 3 we read it a moment ago it is
[1:07:22] impossible but offenses will come but
[1:07:24] woe unto him through whom they come
[1:07:29] it were better for him that a millstone
[1:07:31] were hanged about his neck and he cast
[1:07:33] into the sea
[1:07:34] that he should offend one of these
[1:07:35] little ones take heed to yourselves
[1:07:38] are you taking heed
[1:07:40] i'm heeding brother aaron take heed to
[1:07:42] yourselves if thy brother trespass
[1:07:44] against thee rebuke him
[1:07:47] rebuke us to reprove brother reggie
[1:07:48] brought this out and even brought it
[1:07:49] through the church book sunday night
[1:07:51] that uh and the youth meeting we had in
[1:07:52] our home that the rebuke is to reprove
[1:07:54] it's it's this uh calling this exposing
[1:07:58] with the aim to correct
[1:08:00] some of us kind of like the aha exposing
[1:08:04] but just for the sake of exposing
[1:08:06] not with the desire to correct
[1:08:09] he says rebuke him and
[1:08:12] if he repent forgive him
[1:08:17] i'm just reading what he said i'm not
[1:08:19] trying to put a spin on that at all
[1:08:21] if thy brother trespass against thee
[1:08:23] reprove him expose the fault between you
[1:08:25] and him alone this is kind of the
[1:08:27] condensed language here in luke if he
[1:08:29] repent forgive him
[1:08:31] remember though
[1:08:33] he's saying take heed to yourselves
[1:08:36] if thy brother trespass against thee
[1:08:37] rebuke him and if he repent forgive him
[1:08:39] remember think about this the offender's
[1:08:42] also in danger
[1:08:44] don't lose sight of that
[1:08:46] the offender is also in danger
[1:08:48] that we are taught in many different
[1:08:50] instances in scripture that there's
[1:08:51] we're to rejoice when we're mistreated
[1:08:53] that we're the sufferings are going to
[1:08:54] come and the persecutions are going to
[1:08:56] come and they're going to mock you
[1:08:57] they're going to revile you they're
[1:08:58] going to mistreat you're going to do all
[1:08:59] sorts of horrible things against you
[1:09:01] and these things are going to happen and
[1:09:03] and listen if the world hates you know
[1:09:05] that they hated me to begin with and the
[1:09:07] worlds
[1:09:08] are the devils and they're lost and
[1:09:09] there's no recourse for them and then
[1:09:11] we're thinking wow yes i need to take it
[1:09:13] patiently when i'm buffeted but now when
[1:09:15] it seems to come very close and it's a
[1:09:17] brother that trespassed against you you
[1:09:19] need to remember the offender is also in
[1:09:22] danger of loss
[1:09:25] but also take heed to yourselves
[1:09:28] because there's a cost
[1:09:30] there's a consequence
[1:09:32] therefore guard your heart
[1:09:35] keep it with all diligence
[1:09:38] because there's a price that's exacted
[1:09:39] from you
[1:09:40] through these offenses
[1:09:42] there there is a there is a a detriment
[1:09:45] to you
[1:09:46] and then when you realize that our
[1:09:48] instinct might be whoa i want to get way
[1:09:50] away from this as far as possible
[1:09:52] but then when you're reminded that the
[1:09:54] loss is greater for them
[1:09:57] you risk the loss of thy you risk the
[1:09:59] loss by approaching it right
[1:10:03] you risk that
[1:10:06] knowing
[1:10:07] if i don't
[1:10:10] temper breeds temper
[1:10:14] musicians if you could come this evening
[1:10:27] and the message awakening jesus
[1:10:41] jesus is
[1:10:48] when he's expressing the instance where
[1:10:50] virtue was taken from jesus and he said
[1:10:52] virtue went from him he says virtue is
[1:10:54] strength now that principle is very
[1:10:56] large in itself but notice how he says
[1:10:58] in other words if we'd say today he got
[1:11:00] weak when the people drawed off of him
[1:11:04] well if it worked that way in that human
[1:11:06] body
[1:11:07] it'll work in another human body
[1:11:11] right you catch the principle he's just
[1:11:13] elicited that christ in the context of
[1:11:15] being uh um
[1:11:17] uh who he was and one approaching him
[1:11:20] and and using that gift themselves and
[1:11:22] drawing that virtue from him
[1:11:25] it drained him of that virtue
[1:11:27] and therefore he's
[1:11:29] uh uh if something's taken away from he
[1:11:31] says in modern language he got weak when
[1:11:32] the people were drawing from them and he
[1:11:34] said hey if it happened in his human
[1:11:36] body there's still the same principle
[1:11:38] that exists today it'll work in another
[1:11:39] human body and we can think of how
[1:11:42] when others exercise the gift in brother
[1:11:44] branham's life it drew virtue from him
[1:11:46] but notice what he talks about
[1:11:48] and we create our atmosphere around us
[1:11:50] each one of us
[1:11:52] you've been with people that were nice
[1:11:54] people but you just couldn't hardly be
[1:11:56] around them
[1:11:59] then you've been with other people that
[1:12:00] you just love to be around them
[1:12:02] right
[1:12:03] oh come on none of them are here that
[1:12:05] you don't want to be around so you can
[1:12:06] stay as man as loud as you want i the
[1:12:08] neighbor from next to the apartment next
[1:12:09] door is not here
[1:12:11] hey we can say whatever we want we can
[1:12:12] amen as loud as we want saying there's
[1:12:14] people that you they're nice but you
[1:12:16] can't stand to be around them but
[1:12:17] there's other people you love to be
[1:12:19] around them what is the what is the uh
[1:12:21] amplifying this idea of things being
[1:12:24] taken from you
[1:12:27] right
[1:12:28] the idea of being in a situation that is
[1:12:31] exhausting can i get a witness
[1:12:34] right the idea that when there's some
[1:12:36] people you're around you're completely
[1:12:38] drained you're spent you're exhausted it
[1:12:40] wears you down it's not virtuous there's
[1:12:42] others when you're around even though
[1:12:44] you may be given there's something that
[1:12:45] seems to be reciprocated in it that if
[1:12:47] you were doing all the water and you
[1:12:49] somehow watered yourself and you feel
[1:12:51] good about it why because it's the
[1:12:52] dynamics of those that take take take
[1:12:55] take take and others that when you give
[1:12:57] give give give there's something you get
[1:12:59] in return
[1:13:01] people that you love to be around others
[1:13:03] that you just can't hardly stand to be
[1:13:04] around even though they're nice people
[1:13:06] he says you create that atmosphere you
[1:13:08] have the ability either to be the one
[1:13:10] that is always taking and always one
[1:13:12] being dour always the one bringing down
[1:13:14] or you can be the one that's always
[1:13:15] building things up he says and all
[1:13:17] wouldn't you love to have been around
[1:13:18] jesus just a little
[1:13:21] wonderful see what that atmosphere he
[1:13:23] created would have been
[1:13:25] i imagine
[1:13:26] it was just one great big bundle of love
[1:13:29] and respect and godly fear
[1:13:32] and that can give you something to
[1:13:33] aspire to be
[1:13:35] that can give you something to aspire to
[1:13:37] create a kind of atmosphere where it's
[1:13:39] not just always critical it's not always
[1:13:41] just for for volity it's not always the
[1:13:44] kind of atmosphere that others leave and
[1:13:45] go ah that kind of sullied my spirit oh
[1:13:48] that kind of dirtied me that drew things
[1:13:49] from me that made me feel exhausted that
[1:13:51] made me feel negative that made me feel
[1:13:53] sad that made me that changed my
[1:13:55] attitude it changed my perception don't
[1:13:57] you want to be the kind of person that
[1:13:59] has a virtue to give where it's love and
[1:14:02] respect and godly fear and that's what
[1:14:05] others are drawing from
[1:14:10] [Music]
[1:14:12] i think this is very very practical
[1:14:15] for us to consider
[1:14:17] if you could stand with me this evening
[1:14:20] i believe it's very practical
[1:14:24] for us to consider
