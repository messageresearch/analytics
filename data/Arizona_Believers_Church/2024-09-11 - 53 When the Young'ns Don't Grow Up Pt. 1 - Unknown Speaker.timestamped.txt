[0:00] what a great place to uh pick back up in
[0:02] this series on the house of the Lord
[0:04] after having ministered on the big three
[0:07] to read this scripture wherein it says
[0:09] that these three abideth faith hope and
[0:12] charity and then it says the greatest of
[0:14] these is Charity a lot there for us to
[0:17] think about and consider and tonight
[0:20] having this opportunity to do this on a
[0:22] Wednesday night I like it because then I
[0:24] feel like I can go uh approach a new
[0:26] subject from just a little bit different
[0:28] angle uh maybe a little bit more depth
[0:30] in the word of God and some material
[0:32] that I know that you can handle I don't
[0:34] say that about that the Sunday morning
[0:36] crowd can't handle it but sometimes you
[0:38] just have a little bit more people you
[0:39] maybe have some different visitors and
[0:41] you might have a different burden um on
[0:43] a Sunday morning Believe It or Not
[0:45] pastors can be filled just directed a
[0:47] little bit differently based upon the
[0:48] service and with your midweek uh group
[0:51] that faithful core that's always there
[0:53] every single service just feel that
[0:55] there's a lot that we can get into and
[0:57] not um and really strike a real chord
[0:59] for you so I appreciate your patience
[1:01] tonight as we begin a new subject my
[1:03] title for this uh for the next
[1:05] foreseeable future is when the youngans
[1:08] don't grow up and I think that uh
[1:12] there's just a lot that you can gather
[1:13] from that title you might even be able
[1:15] to gather it quite a bit just from my
[1:17] slide I chose to put together uh when
[1:20] the young ons don't grow up you may
[1:22] recognize the font anybody know what
[1:23] font this is Calvin and Hobs font and uh
[1:27] that's a picture of a little bit older
[1:29] Calvin holding Hobs uh and maybe perhaps
[1:32] thinking am I too old for this but I
[1:35] want to begin to look at subjects of
[1:38] emotional and spiritual maturity and so
[1:41] I'm telling you everything up front so
[1:42] that as we go forward never forget what
[1:44] it is that we're targeting and what we
[1:46] feel the Lord is dealing with us on and
[1:49] at really at the heart of that we talk
[1:50] about emotional and spiritual maturity
[1:52] in our minds we might start thinking
[1:53] well this is 12 steps to living a better
[1:55] life or um this is psychology which I
[1:58] think is just one of the PWS that the
[2:00] devil likes to throw around a lot of
[2:01] times but that's not it at all uh it's a
[2:04] different PW of purpose and the purpose
[2:07] of the word of God in this hour I think
[2:09] sometimes it's missing uh we just kind
[2:12] of forget that well these things have
[2:14] happened and this has happened and God's
[2:15] doing this and God's doing that instead
[2:17] of taking a step back and thinking about
[2:19] how God is very deliberate when he does
[2:21] something that God does something to
[2:23] achieve something else he's always
[2:24] moving towards the kingdom and there's
[2:26] always a Perfection that he's trying to
[2:28] bring that there's a vision for the word
[2:30] when it's revealed and there's a vision
[2:32] for the word in this time and maybe even
[2:35] more importantly using this uh this
[2:38] phrase when the youngans don't grow up
[2:41] uh that what is the age that we're
[2:43] living in what what's the time that
[2:45] we're living in what's the mark of this
[2:47] age and what's the purpose of the word
[2:48] of God in this age now if you look at
[2:51] our text I'd like to start with verse
[2:53] eight again let start here uh I have a
[2:56] lot of things to cover in this uh in
[3:01] this service but yet uh we can just hold
[3:04] over till Sunday if we not able to get
[3:06] to all of it verse 8 says charity never
[3:08] faileth but whether there be prophecies
[3:10] they shall fail whether there be tongues
[3:12] they shall cease whether there be
[3:14] knowledge it shall vanish Away Paul has
[3:17] already said a lot in this chapter to
[3:19] challenge um a lot of our assumptions
[3:20] and Notions about certain things I know
[3:23] for me personally when he says though I
[3:25] understand all Mysteries and have not
[3:27] charity I am nothing that that really
[3:29] hits at the core of maybe some of the
[3:31] things that we really love or we hold
[3:32] very dear and I think it's important to
[3:34] recognize that he's speaking maybe in a
[3:36] rhetorical way and not necessarily
[3:39] wanting us to uh wouldn't want us to
[3:41] turn it into something that he's not
[3:43] meaning but yet he's wanting to get our
[3:45] attention and then he says charity never
[3:47] fails and says prophecies will fail and
[3:49] tongues will cease and knowledge will
[3:51] vanish away and that's some uh some
[3:54] pretty heavy things to say especially to
[3:56] this Corinthian Church he says for we
[3:58] know in part and we prophesy in part so
[4:01] it's not the prophesying and the knowing
[4:04] the gift of knowledge the word of
[4:05] knowledge the prophesying he is saying
[4:08] that it's it's just partial it's not the
[4:11] fullness he says but when that which is
[4:12] perfect is come then that which is in
[4:15] part shall be done away now Paul begins
[4:17] to prophesy and his Revelation then was
[4:20] prophecy for today so the very things
[4:23] that are being revealed to him and the
[4:24] mark of perfection and that which is
[4:26] perfect will come and when we uh when it
[4:28] shall turn to the Lord all all these
[4:30] different things this Revelation that
[4:32] Paul preached and he preached it so
[4:34] imminent that this is the last days and
[4:36] and this is the time that we're living
[4:38] in uh this is revelation for the time
[4:40] that we're living in when that which is
[4:42] perfect is come then that which is in
[4:44] part shall be done away when I was a
[4:46] child I spake as a child now it's
[4:48] important to recognize that he hasn't
[4:50] just Paul didn't all a sudden transition
[4:52] out of a sermon into another one and now
[4:54] he's given his life story and he's left
[4:56] the thought of perfection behind and
[4:57] he's not talking about charity anymore
[4:59] but he he and it's like Paul is slipping
[5:01] again he's going back and telling child
[5:03] stories no he's saying with this is an
[5:05] image of what this Perfection is when I
[5:08] was a child I spake as a child tongues
[5:11] word of knowledge prophecy he said when
[5:14] I was a child I spake as a child I
[5:15] understood as a child I thought as a
[5:17] child notice just the symmetry of those
[5:19] three with the tongues the prophesying
[5:21] and the knowledge he's saying these
[5:23] things are in part he says but when I
[5:25] became a man I put away childish things
[5:31] he says for now we see through a glass
[5:32] Darkly every time I read that I think of
[5:34] my dad my precious dad Brother David
[5:37] McGary who always says a glass darkling
[5:40] and so I it's hard for me not to read
[5:42] that I joked around that because of his
[5:43] spelling we believed in the Holy Sprite
[5:45] for
[5:46] years but now we see through a glass
[5:48] Darkly but then face to face now I know
[5:52] in part but then shall I know even as
[5:54] also I am known there's a lot that I
[5:57] want to would love just to even right
[5:59] now begin to unpack and put before you
[6:01] in a slide and drill into what these
[6:04] words mean and more in the context of
[6:06] what Paul is saying especially the
[6:07] audience that he's saying it too I
[6:09] believe brother brandham said this is
[6:10] the Pentecostal church that he's
[6:12] correcting he says when I was a child
[6:14] that word is translated to babe in the
[6:17] scripture uh some of the working titles
[6:20] I had for this uh these this subject as
[6:22] I've studied over the last several
[6:24] months is when the babies don't grow up
[6:26] or when the babies don't grow up or
[6:27] mature and so when I was a child or babe
[6:30] or childish is another word that it's
[6:32] translated to and it means these
[6:35] different things an infant a little
[6:36] child a toddler a miner one that is not
[6:39] of age so you realize when I was a child
[6:42] it doesn't necessarily mean when I was
[6:43] three or when I was 12 but it could
[6:45] actually mean this whole time period of
[6:49] wherein there's what you would expect of
[6:50] a 2-year-old is certainly not what you
[6:52] would expect of a 12-year-old and if you
[6:54] got from a 2-year-old what you would
[6:55] expect from a 12-year-old it would shock
[6:57] you right and but then sometimes when
[6:59] our 13-year-olds act like 2-year-olds
[7:01] we're not surprised cuz we saw that
[7:03] before from them but yet there is a um
[7:06] an infant a little child a minor one
[7:08] that is not of age that covers quite a
[7:10] lot of ground especially to a Hebrew
[7:13] that you could say there was these
[7:14] different junctures wherein uh uh in
[7:17] just in the language of a Hebrew and
[7:19] within Israel there's different
[7:20] junctures that one would come to even up
[7:23] to 30 years old the word also means
[7:26] untaught or unskilled and it's not that
[7:29] they wouldn't have any skill or that
[7:31] they wouldn't uh be taught at all but
[7:33] yet when one is at a certain age and
[7:36] they're not of age or they're a child or
[7:38] they're a minor or they're an infant
[7:40] then there's not uh they haven't learned
[7:42] or been taught they haven't gone through
[7:44] different seasons of life to uh uh
[7:46] wrestle with certain things or be
[7:47] exposed I haven't been awakened to
[7:49] things and so there hasn't been the
[7:52] consecutive years of teaching there
[7:53] hasn't been the consecutive years of
[7:55] putting into practice what one has been
[7:57] taught so it really means a lot when you
[7:59] say when I was a child it covers a very
[8:02] long stage of development and then he
[8:06] positions them to say when I was a child
[8:08] I thought and uh uh spoke and understood
[8:12] as a child and then he says when I
[8:14] became a man and he puts them against
[8:17] each other that there's when you're a
[8:18] child and though it may cover this long
[8:20] period of time he says when I became a
[8:22] man I put away these things that would
[8:25] reflect being an infant a little child a
[8:27] minor not of age or being untaught or
[8:30] unskilled not that there wouldn't be
[8:31] more to learn and more to uh implement
[8:34] but he's looking at this time when
[8:36] things that related to that particular
[8:38] age had now found their place and he was
[8:42] coming into
[8:43] adulthood the use of a word man in the
[8:46] Greek it's used to distinguish an adult
[8:49] from a child one that has grown up or
[8:52] one that has matured so he's wanting to
[8:55] think of childish things things that are
[8:57] related to babes or uh a youth a minor
[9:01] and one that is grown up or a man an
[9:04] adult in John chapter 9 if you were to
[9:08] read the story uh you could start with
[9:10] verse one and then read almost all the
[9:13] way to verse 34 I believe and it tells
[9:18] the story of a blind man who is the
[9:20] Bible says was blind from birth and I I
[9:23] wanted to share this question when they
[9:25] passed by this man who was blind from
[9:26] birth help me understand what the
[9:28] disciples were think thinking it says
[9:30] they said master who did Sin this man or
[9:33] his parents that he was born
[9:36] blind and I I I just haven't been able
[9:38] to figure it out for years why they
[9:40] asked that question they said he was
[9:43] born blind did this man sin that he was
[9:45] born blind that would they must have
[9:46] thought a lot about a baby in the womb
[9:48] like the things he could imagine and the
[9:50] Mischief he could get into and sin
[9:51] before he's even born and God would
[9:53] blind him for it but
[9:55] anyways this man was blind from birth
[9:59] and and the story is that Jesus told him
[10:00] to go wash in the pul Shalom and he was
[10:03] washed and he received his sight and the
[10:05] Pharisees didn't like this for a number
[10:08] of reasons and they went to the parents
[10:11] and they asked the parents you know what
[10:12] happened and what's the story here and
[10:15] the Jews had said that anybody who would
[10:17] speak positively of the Messiah I think
[10:19] it's in verse 22 they feared the Jews
[10:22] because the Jews had agreed that if any
[10:23] man confessed that Jesus was the Christ
[10:26] he would have been put out of the church
[10:27] or out of the synagogue so there was
[10:29] this peer pressure and this political
[10:30] pressure to not say anything about Jesus
[10:33] and in verse 21 uh they ask by what
[10:36] means he now seeth they asked him by
[10:38] what means does he now see and this is
[10:39] their response but by what means he now
[10:42] seeth we know not or who hath opened his
[10:44] eyes we know not he is of age ask him he
[10:48] shall speak for
[10:51] himself this is uh though we know and
[10:54] the Bible goes to another scripture to
[10:57] give us in verse 22 the context as to
[10:59] why they said it they might have known
[11:01] that it was Jesus and they knew it was
[11:03] the Messiah and they may have wanted to
[11:04] confess it but their answer is right but
[11:07] it hides behind that pressure to not
[11:10] give Christ the credit but he says he is
[11:12] of age he shall speak for himself in
[11:14] other words he's an adult we don't have
[11:17] to answer we do not have to explain to
[11:20] you uh what our convictions are tell you
[11:22] what happen since he is of age he has
[11:25] the right to speak for himself he is
[11:27] mature enough go ask Kim and in under
[11:32] the law there was a when a when a child
[11:36] came of a particular age and they would
[11:38] say it's when they could uh give proof
[11:40] of of uh development physical
[11:42] development in pub at around 12 years
[11:44] old that they would be qualified to be a
[11:47] witness in certain proceedings if
[11:49] someone needed to testify or give
[11:50] witness and so one could be of age even
[11:53] as an adolescent or a teenager but then
[11:56] uh one would pass these other Junctions
[11:58] to where as they grew or they matured
[12:00] and they developed uh they would be
[12:03] growing each time but here it means he
[12:05] is of age he's mature enough he can
[12:07] speak for himself the word of age is
[12:09] stature so he's of a particular stature
[12:11] of adult age he's maturity he's matured
[12:15] it speaks of maturity and it means to
[12:18] attain a state fit for a thing in other
[12:21] words he is of age he's like he's
[12:23] obtained a state to where he can speak
[12:26] for himself he doesn't need his parents
[12:28] uh man managing his Affairs he doesn't
[12:30] need his parents uh uh taking care of
[12:33] business could you imagine for some of
[12:34] you adults here if you weren't able to
[12:36] make it into work and you had your mom
[12:38] call and tell your boss sorry but
[12:41] brother Andrew is not able to make it
[12:42] into work today he's not feeling well
[12:44] and he'd be like is he in a coma is he
[12:47] having surgery why is his mom calling
[12:49] it's like no that's my son I'm just
[12:51] looking out after him and taking care of
[12:52] him this is the idea that there's this
[12:54] age of responsibility where he can speak
[12:57] for himself
[12:59] I use this very quickly just so that we
[13:01] can all be on the same page of what it
[13:03] is that we're referring to I will say
[13:06] this that tonight I had I'm not going to
[13:09] have the time maybe to get into how this
[13:10] relates to those three things of the
[13:12] individual uh the home and the church
[13:14] but there's this parallel to the house
[13:16] of the Lord and the purpose of worship
[13:19] and the Tabernacle of witness so I I
[13:21] don't want you to think that we're just
[13:23] trying to shoehorn this into this uh
[13:25] series and not and being stubborn about
[13:27] our titling but I want to use this
[13:30] principle the age of criminal
[13:32] responsibility and we hear maybe quite
[13:34] often that they're uh a CH someone who
[13:36] is below the age of 18 has committed a
[13:38] heinous act or some crime and there's a
[13:41] decision to try them as an adult and so
[13:44] there are things that brother B talks
[13:46] about juvenile delinquency and we hear
[13:47] that word quite a bit and to be juvenile
[13:50] it's over relating to young people and
[13:54] uh so when we have youth camps you can
[13:55] call them juvenile camps and I'm going
[13:58] to a juvenile camp so what are you in
[13:59] for uh there's um it's characteristic or
[14:02] suitable for young a young person for
[14:05] youngans for youths however you would
[14:07] say it that there are uh things that are
[14:10] juvenile they're characteristic of
[14:12] someone who is a child whether it be a
[14:14] minor or whether it be someone who's not
[14:15] of age or someone who's unskilled a
[14:17] little child something that is juvenile
[14:19] it relates to a particular time of life
[14:21] and the definition is the state of one
[14:23] who is not emotionally
[14:26] mature and therefore the law has
[14:28] different standards depending on whether
[14:30] or not you're categorized as an adult
[14:33] one who can have the Mena the intent
[14:35] form the intent the mental process to
[14:37] know what you're doing and what the
[14:39] consequences of what you're doing and so
[14:41] they'll take a someone that is a
[14:43] juvenile and not a certain age and
[14:44] they'll measure whether or not they
[14:46] believe they had this malice of
[14:48] forethought or they knew what they were
[14:50] doing and they were they're old enough
[14:51] to be held accountable as an adult so
[14:54] we're familiar with that idea of the age
[14:56] of criminal responsibility where
[14:58] juvenile though they're only 14 because
[15:00] of their act and because of their the
[15:02] way that they went about it they want to
[15:03] try them as an adult and say Well
[15:05] they're mature enough to face the
[15:07] consequences but I want you to think of
[15:10] how even the law itself recognizes this
[15:12] pattern of development and says that
[15:15] there's a particular time at which we
[15:17] don't necessarily trust them to vote we
[15:19] don't necessarily trust them to drive
[15:20] cars we wouldn't have them go to war we
[15:23] wouldn't allow them to buy alcohol
[15:24] there's certain things that we watch out
[15:26] over of a certain age because they're
[15:28] not mature enough and developed enough
[15:31] emotionally and mentally to be able to
[15:33] handle or trust their decisions in those
[15:35] things they are a juvenile they are a
[15:38] child they are young and they have not
[15:41] matured enough to a certain point to
[15:43] where they can be trusted so it's about
[15:46] responsibility Paul is talking about
[15:48] this very thing when he says when I was
[15:50] a child when I was juvenile when I was
[15:54] of a particular age of a particular
[15:55] development when I thought a certain way
[15:57] and acted a certain way uh uh these
[15:59] things that are characteristics of being
[16:01] a young person he say but when I became
[16:03] a man I put away childish things and
[16:05] Paul may have purely been talking about
[16:07] his own personal development as an
[16:09] individual and how that he had certain
[16:11] propensities as a teenager but then as
[16:13] he was taught and he learned and he grew
[16:15] there was things he no longer did just
[16:17] by way of maturing emotionally and
[16:19] spiritually and that when he became a
[16:20] man his life was markedly different than
[16:22] it was when he was a teenager in his
[16:24] early 20s and he's using that as an
[16:26] example of what happened happens when
[16:29] that which is perfect is come so Paul
[16:32] may have been very specific about the
[16:34] fact that this was him as an individual
[16:36] and as a man living a natural life but
[16:38] there's a spiritual parallel to the
[16:40] development of the spiritual body of
[16:42] Christ and the spiritual maturity of the
[16:44] believer that relates to what ought to
[16:46] happen when that which is perfect is
[16:49] come
[16:51] amen now in the qu question and answers
[16:54] part two and I believe every statement I
[16:57] want to read tonight
[16:59] uh just about every statement I think I
[17:01] have a couple other statements from
[17:02] somewhere else but these are lengthy
[17:03] I've provided them in a slide I want to
[17:05] go through them with you so that it's
[17:07] kind of in the fabric of of this subject
[17:10] and it's in your hearts and in your
[17:12] minds and in your Consciousness and then
[17:13] if we're not able to read them again or
[17:15] go back to them we could just kind of
[17:16] create this aura that it's all there
[17:19] when other people come who aren't here
[17:20] tonight and they're in the service it's
[17:21] there because it's in our hearts and in
[17:23] our minds brother Brams asked a question
[17:25] I'm going to read one 2 3 4 four
[17:29] questions all of them basically relate
[17:31] to this very scripture in some way
[17:33] brother Brandon brings it back to this
[17:34] scripture First Corinth in 1 Corinthians
[17:36] 13 dear brother brandom I have been
[17:38] baptized in Jesus name the word says
[17:41] that you shall receive the gift of the
[17:42] Holy Ghost does this mean I should
[17:44] receive a definite experience with the
[17:47] baptism I'm anxious to be filled with
[17:49] the
[17:52] spirit now brother bam said there's a
[17:54] good question and I believe it is this
[17:57] is a good question and brother brandham
[18:00] is going to tonight I want you to
[18:01] recognize there's things that brother
[18:03] brandham must establish as right and
[18:07] unassailable but he's going to
[18:08] acknowledge at the same time these traps
[18:11] that people have gotten into with those
[18:13] things to where it hasn't quite LED them
[18:17] in the way that it ought to have some
[18:19] something's in the misunderstanding
[18:20] somewhere and so he's wanting to get
[18:22] he's wanting to answer the question
[18:23] that's asked not the one that we think
[18:25] is being asked brother Brams asked
[18:27] questions and people say well do all
[18:28] born of again Believers go in the
[18:30] Rapture and then brother bam says no and
[18:32] so we just build a whole uh all sorts of
[18:35] manner of Doctrine around it not
[18:36] realizing that that question wasn't
[18:39] yours it was somebody else's and
[18:41] whatever that person was thinking when
[18:43] the question was asked brother bradam
[18:44] has to answer that or he gives them the
[18:46] wrong answer and we need to be mature
[18:49] enough with the word of God to know what
[18:50] brother bradam taught about being born
[18:52] again and realized that what brother
[18:54] random was doing was addressing those
[18:55] who in their minds thought you could
[18:57] actually be born again without the
[18:59] spirit so he had to move the needle for
[19:01] them to realize okay you're born again
[19:03] confessing but you have to go on to
[19:05] receive what is the actual New Birth and
[19:07] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and here I
[19:09] believe this question is asked with
[19:11] maybe a lot of assumptions a lot of
[19:12] things in mind and brother Brandon picks
[19:14] up on it immediately because we would
[19:16] say well this person wants a definite
[19:18] experience of the baptism of the Holy
[19:20] Ghost and brother Braham says the
[19:21] baptism with the Holy Spirit is a
[19:24] definite experience that a person must
[19:27] have I love it that he says this because
[19:29] this is a must you must be born again it
[19:32] is a definite experience too it's not
[19:35] anything you should be like well I don't
[19:37] know I mean back at that juvenile Camp
[19:39] there at one year I got I think I was
[19:41] born again I you know things have been a
[19:43] little bit different since then and uh
[19:46] it's not because you were traumatized
[19:47] because the food or the smells but you
[19:48] just think well something happened to my
[19:50] there should be a definite
[19:52] experience then he immediately says now
[19:55] let me kind of clear that up just for a
[19:57] minute now many people have the idea I
[20:01] believe it's twisted and he's not quite
[20:03] finishing his thought but he's thrown a
[20:04] lot out there and maybe they're here
[20:07] maybe right here to the church and to
[20:09] the church that's listening there might
[20:11] be a question now when I speak of not
[20:13] believing the initial evidence of the
[20:15] Holy Ghost is speaking with tongues I do
[20:17] not accept that I believe with God's
[20:20] help I can prove it in the Bible that
[20:22] that's wrong because the speaking in
[20:23] tongues is a gift of the Holy Ghost how
[20:25] many knows that so it's saying it is a
[20:27] gift of the Holy Ghost divine healing is
[20:29] a gift of the Holy Ghost and here the
[20:31] Beatles are doing
[20:42] it Satan can impersonate any of those
[20:46] gifts witches Wizards can speak in
[20:48] tongues and interpret it the jungle
[20:51] lands many times a wizard will speak in
[20:54] tongues drink blood out of a human skull
[20:56] and interpret unknown tongues
[21:02] now I I I'm I'm skipping some a portion
[21:05] here but I want you to recog brother
[21:06] bram's teeing up immediately when some
[21:08] this person says I want to receive a
[21:11] definite experience of the baptism the
[21:13] Holy Ghost so brother Bram says yes
[21:14] there is a definite experience but let
[21:16] me clear something up about what you
[21:19] what this definite experience might be
[21:22] because you might be thinking if I could
[21:24] just manifest myself in some sort of
[21:27] emotional way that I've had that
[21:29] definite experience so I'm skipping
[21:31] quite a few uh paragraphs here I trust
[21:33] that you could go back yourselves and
[21:34] listen or read it he says many questions
[21:37] here on it well will the bride will this
[21:40] the church and he says you can't divide
[21:43] what they are the bride is the elected
[21:45] of God so there's there's those things
[21:49] that can manifest and can present and
[21:51] look a certain way and he said we got to
[21:53] make the mistake of just assigning
[21:55] categories to things that happen says
[21:57] you can't divide it
[21:59] he says the bride is elected the church
[22:01] goes through we know the church goes
[22:03] through tribulation it'll stand before
[22:05] white Throne judgment but the bride
[22:07] elected of God are the only ones that
[22:09] can be born again therefore they're the
[22:10] only ones that can go in a
[22:13] Rapture that's the ones it says
[22:15] whosoever will let him come the church
[22:17] but the bride is the elected of God
[22:20] there's five offices elected of God for
[22:23] God has said in the church Apostles
[22:24] prophets teachers pastors evangelists
[22:26] God did that this is a very important
[22:28] scripture in Ephesians 4 it's at the
[22:30] real heart of the things I've been
[22:31] studying on this man has deacons and so
[22:34] forth and everything else but you see
[22:36] but God set in the church for the
[22:38] perfecting of the church so there's
[22:41] things in the church that are ordained
[22:42] of God for what purpose the perfecting
[22:45] he says you can't divide it and this is
[22:48] where he he's kind of entering back into
[22:50] answering this question directly now the
[22:52] Holy Spirit when it comes it is a
[22:53] witness unto you that this word is right
[22:55] the word for today not the word of
[22:57] Luther not the word not for Moses we
[22:59] witness it's the truth but it's another
[23:02] day so we witness the truth of the
[23:04] restoration of the gifts we witness the
[23:06] truth of the uh of justification and
[23:08] sanctification we witness the truth of
[23:10] Moses and Noah but you must also
[23:12] recognize the building of the truth to
[23:14] the age that we live in now now what if
[23:17] Jesus would come and say now as Moses
[23:18] came talking to you all out taking you
[23:20] out of Egypt I come taking you somewhere
[23:22] else what if he said let's go work and
[23:24] build an ark I'm the Lord God I'm going
[23:26] to float the world away now I'm going to
[23:28] drown the world all of them why he'd
[23:30] been out of the scripture he would have
[23:32] been out of the scripture never said
[23:34] he'd come like that he wouldn't have
[23:36] been the Messiah no matter how much Arc
[23:38] he'd built of whatever he had done he'd
[23:41] have not qualified the Messiah there you
[23:44] are it's
[23:46] qualification quite a statement is he's
[23:49] answering the question about a definite
[23:51] experience of the baptism of the Holy
[23:52] Ghost he wants to be very clear that he
[23:55] does he believes in speaking speaking in
[23:58] tongues he believes in Divine Healing
[24:00] but as far as trying to measure your
[24:02] experience by whether or not these
[24:04] things happen he's cautioning and he
[24:06] says the qualification is not
[24:10] in these this me these metrics are these
[24:14] things but what about the word for your
[24:17] day you wouldn't reject Moses you can't
[24:20] reject Noah you can't reject uh The
[24:22] Exodus and and the flood but he's saying
[24:24] Jesus couldn't come and try to bring
[24:26] them back he the scriptures spoke
[24:27] something of him and so what he had to
[24:30] do is Manifest the word for his hour and
[24:32] that was the
[24:34] qualification and then he immediately
[24:36] says 1 Corinthians 13 says this when
[24:39] that which is perfect is come then that
[24:40] which is in part shall be done
[24:42] away brother brandom I've been baptized
[24:45] in Jesus name the word says you shall
[24:46] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost does
[24:48] this mean I should receive a definite
[24:50] experience with the baptism I'm anxious
[24:52] to be filled with the spirit and brother
[24:53] brandom leads him right to 1 Corinthians
[24:55] 13 when that which is perfect has come
[24:57] that which is part shall be done away
[25:00] qualification so all these little things
[25:03] of jumping up and down like a kid trying
[25:05] to talking tongues and all these other
[25:07] things when that which is perfect it's
[25:11] not denying jumping up and down it's not
[25:14] denying talking with tongues it's not
[25:17] denying all these other things but he's
[25:19] saying but when that which is perfect is
[25:20] come and he says and we do have today by
[25:24] God's help the perfect interpretation of
[25:27] the word with divine
[25:29] Vindication then that which is in part
[25:32] is done away with when I was a child I
[25:34] spake as a child understood as a child
[25:37] but when I became a man I put away
[25:40] childish
[25:41] things brother Rand was putting right at
[25:44] the heart of his message 1 Corinthians
[25:46] 13 8-12 or
[25:48] 8-13 even and he is orienting us to
[25:53] things that have been and things that
[25:54] will be and at this point saying we do
[25:57] have today that which is perfect by
[25:59] God's help the perfect interpretation of
[26:02] the word with Divine Vindication and he
[26:05] leads us to becoming a man when I was a
[26:09] child I thought as a child I spake as a
[26:11] child I understood as a child so all
[26:13] these little things of of
[26:16] Youth all these little things of
[26:18] enthusiasm and experience and those
[26:20] things he doesn't say they're of the
[26:22] devil he doesn't say they're wrong he
[26:24] doesn't say they don't belong but he's
[26:25] saying what would all those things be
[26:27] characteris ISC of we could say that not
[26:30] as an Evidence but it's it's it's life
[26:33] it's maybe some stimulation it's some
[26:34] sort of expression in manifestation of
[26:37] the spirit that would work upon an
[26:38] individual but he's saying that's not
[26:40] where it's at it's the qualification of
[26:43] the word for your day in the time that
[26:45] you're living in when that which is
[26:47] perfect has
[26:49] come we come to manhood we come to
[26:54] adulthood and then he's asked this
[26:56] question that was question 281 then
[26:58] question 289 so we know it's several
[27:00] questions
[27:02] later he says at the instance of re
[27:04] excuse me at the instant of receiving
[27:06] the holy ghost or the baptism of the
[27:08] Holy Ghost is there a difference does a
[27:10] person speak with tongues if not always
[27:13] what manifestation is
[27:18] known they're asking good
[27:21] questions and I cleaned up the question
[27:23] a little bit as it as it was asked
[27:25] you'll find that brother brandham is
[27:26] repeat some of the statements in there I
[27:27] tried to clean it up to just what I
[27:29] thought the question actually was I
[27:31] apologize if if uh that would offend
[27:35] anyone but I just wanted to get get it
[27:38] across uh for the sake of this sermon at
[27:41] the moment that a person receives the
[27:42] Holy Ghost is there a difference that
[27:45] maybe could say he's already been asked
[27:46] a def is there a definite experience so
[27:49] definite difference there's some sort of
[27:51] Distinction that's wanting to be brought
[27:53] out of I know this is the moment that I
[27:54] got it he said does a person speak with
[27:56] tongues if not if they don't always
[27:58] speak with tongues what manifestation
[28:00] declares whether or not a person's been
[28:01] born again he says well could you
[28:04] imagine a mother giving birth to a baby
[28:06] and not knowing
[28:09] it this is in other words how could you
[28:13] claim then to have experienced the
[28:15] baptism of the Holy Ghost and have never
[28:17] known it that's quite a question it's a
[28:21] a very interesting statement I think I
[28:23] was ministering on a definite experience
[28:26] of the new birth overseas one time and
[28:29] um the brothers that we were ministering
[28:30] it to the ministers there uh a couple of
[28:32] them kind of took great offense to it
[28:34] because they had been told uh by some
[28:36] other preachers that you could have a
[28:38] definite experience and not know it and
[28:40] the question they posed to me was do you
[28:42] know when you were born do you remember
[28:44] being born I says you only know when
[28:47] you're born because your passport tells
[28:48] you when you were born and and and and I
[28:51] said well where didd you get that it was
[28:52] always brother so and so brother and so
[28:53] and so and never brother brandham the
[28:54] question brother brandham asked is can a
[28:56] mother give birth and not know it well
[28:58] well today they can when science
[28:59] intervenes right but according to the
[29:02] way that God had ordained it and sorrow
[29:04] as she would bring forth a child the
[29:06] Bible says she cannot forget that child
[29:09] she'd have to be unconscious not to know
[29:12] it neither can you receive the Holy
[29:14] Ghost without knowing it there's
[29:16] something that takes place in you
[29:18] there's something that changes you your
[29:20] whole system your whole spiritual system
[29:22] is made new again and you become a new
[29:24] creature in Christ as the Bible puts it
[29:26] a new creation in Christ
[29:29] you know it now you say brother brandom
[29:31] then you don't believe that a man could
[29:32] should speak in tongues to receive the
[29:34] Holy
[29:35] Ghost not to prove he's got the Holy
[29:38] Ghost so this is second time in this
[29:41] question and answers these things are
[29:43] starting to come up he says I would that
[29:46] every member of my church spoke with
[29:47] tongues so is it a dirty thing no is it
[29:51] an unscriptural thing no as long as you
[29:53] don't make it
[29:54] one and I would like for them to do that
[29:57] and and I believe if you ask God God
[29:59] will grant it to you so there's this uh
[30:02] there's this putting the gifts uh in
[30:05] context to say I mean it's there God can
[30:07] move upon you this gift can take place
[30:09] and it can transpire and I would that
[30:11] everyone in my church did it and I'd
[30:13] like for them to and I believe if you
[30:14] ask God that you will but let me tell
[30:17] you here's the prophet now cautioning
[30:19] his own church saying Hey I want you to
[30:21] do it you enjoy that just like we might
[30:23] sometimes as parents make available to
[30:26] our children certain things they can
[30:27] enjoy
[30:28] oh that's fine son you enjoy that honey
[30:30] you go ahead and enjoy that H have fun
[30:32] uh uh buy that experience this go here
[30:35] do that but realize this son that's not
[30:37] everything or that's not the ultimate
[30:39] that's not what's most
[30:41] important don't get caught up in those
[30:44] things don't don't make that your
[30:45] emphasis don't make that your drive and
[30:47] your passion but let me tell you I know
[30:49] plenty of people that speak in tongues
[30:50] and hasn't got the Holy Ghost and
[30:52] there's not a minister that's true with
[30:54] himself and with his congregation but
[30:56] will tell his congregation the same
[31:00] right anybody who won't emphasize the
[31:03] same being
[31:04] dishonest right he's not being true with
[31:06] himself or his church the devil can
[31:09] impersonate that Paul said though I
[31:11] speak with tongue of men and angels
[31:13] though I give my body to be burned as a
[31:14] sacrifice though I understand all
[31:16] Mysteries of the word though I give all
[31:17] my goods to the poor and all these
[31:19] things and have not charity I'm still
[31:20] nothing wow I have faith that I can move
[31:23] mountains and so forth I'm still nothing
[31:26] then he said
[31:28] that which is in part will be done away
[31:30] with when that which is perfect is come
[31:33] or when that which is perfect is made
[31:35] known hasn't he already kind of
[31:37] addressed this just eight questions
[31:39] prior question 281 he brought this
[31:41] question of the definite experience of
[31:43] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he
[31:45] said now there is a definite experience
[31:47] but don't get caught up in all these
[31:48] other things just look for the
[31:50] qualification of the word of God because
[31:52] we do have today the perfect
[31:54] interpretation of the word by Divine
[31:56] Vindication through God's help amen and
[31:58] that's the Fulfillment of First
[32:00] Corinthians 13 that which is perfect is
[32:03] come and that's when the childish things
[32:05] are put away or done away with given
[32:08] context however you want to look at it
[32:10] and he comes right back to it when that
[32:12] which is perfect is come or when that
[32:14] which is perfect is made
[32:17] known and he says now I got a question
[32:19] on that I hope to get to it tonight
[32:20] about what happened when the seals
[32:21] opened so now he's telling us I want to
[32:24] get to a question specifically on this
[32:26] and how that when which is perfect is
[32:28] come or when that which is perfect is
[32:29] made known it relates to when the seals
[32:33] are opened are we all together in this
[32:36] all right good now think about this as
[32:38] he's asked this question question
[32:40] 302 please explain 1 Corinthians 138 to2
[32:45] now that the perfect word is restored to
[32:47] the church are these verses
[32:51] fulfilled I I I read that as it's almost
[32:54] as if brother Brandon put the question
[32:55] in there like I want to get to to this
[32:58] so uh you asked this question I I'm not
[33:01] questioning whether or not these are
[33:02] organic questions it's perfect though he
[33:04] said I got a question tonight about what
[33:06] happened when the seals were open I
[33:07] believe this is the question now that
[33:09] the perfect word is restored to the
[33:11] church are these verses fulfilled he
[33:14] goes now I think I just went through
[33:16] that didn't I this is his answer and
[33:18] when that which is perfect has come that
[33:20] which is in part shall be done away with
[33:23] Paul said though I speak with tongues of
[33:24] men and angels and do all these things
[33:25] here but when that which is perfect come
[33:28] now is there anything more per is there
[33:31] anything perfect but God no sir is God
[33:33] the perfect in the beginning was the and
[33:37] the Word was with God and the Word was
[33:39] God the word still God when that which
[33:42] is perfect has come that which is in
[33:43] part is done away with that's saying a
[33:46] lot this is something that has been made
[33:49] known now I know that we try to look at
[33:52] things and we look in ter linearly and
[33:53] chronologically and spatially so we
[33:55] think when that which is perfect has
[33:57] come we got to think about a particular
[33:58] time and distance has to be traveled and
[34:01] and if I'm going to come to your home we
[34:02] set a time for me to come otherwise it'd
[34:04] be pointless brother Aaron would you
[34:06] come over for dinner and and you don't
[34:08] tell me a time you don't tell me where
[34:12] and and I just tell you say oh I came
[34:14] over for dinner yesterday how I just
[34:17] thought through it you I had dinner in
[34:19] your house uh and you say well that I I
[34:22] I can't get my head around that but
[34:24] that's just the way that we think so we
[34:25] think when that which is perfect is come
[34:27] we got to pinpoint a exact moment in
[34:28] time and God has to travel some sort of
[34:30] distance but it's when that which is
[34:32] perfect is made known where the spirit
[34:35] of Lord there is Liberty that means
[34:36] there is a something an entrance is
[34:39] opened up to where now God is moving
[34:41] with the intent and deliberation to
[34:43] bring to Perfection it's not in some
[34:46] other age of development not in some
[34:47] other time but now in the order of the
[34:49] church it's come to a particular age a
[34:51] time for fulfillment a time to bring a
[34:54] people to a place where they're suitable
[34:56] for a particular purpose
[34:58] to attain
[35:00] to a state that is fit for a
[35:03] thing and he's saying that it's the word
[35:05] that's God it's god making himself
[35:07] known that which is perfect is come the
[35:10] perfect word is restored to the church
[35:11] so he says I think we covered that
[35:13] already and here it
[35:15] is question
[35:18] 318 same question and answers all of
[35:20] these are in the evening on August
[35:26] 23rd what is the is that a person is
[35:28] really filled with the Holy
[35:31] Ghost John 14:26 brother BR says quotes
[35:35] the scripture when the Holy Ghost has
[35:36] come he will show you things to
[35:39] come can we just look at this for a
[35:41] little bit brother Bram has asked what
[35:45] how can we tell the evidence that when
[35:47] someone is really filled with the Holy
[35:50] Ghost and he quotes John 14:26 when the
[35:53] Holy Ghost has come he'll show you
[35:55] things to come now now he's pointing out
[35:59] uh a principle that Jesus is teaching
[36:01] especially in this particular uh series
[36:04] of chapters in The Book of
[36:07] John of the the Holy Ghost the comforter
[36:11] he's a teacher he's going to show you
[36:13] things to come and I think this is the
[36:14] answer he will perfect
[36:17] it he'll perfect what the
[36:22] experience what is the evidence that a
[36:25] person is really filled with the Holy
[36:26] Ghost the the
[36:29] evidence that a person is filled the
[36:31] Holy Ghost is he will perfect it think
[36:35] of this really pray and ask yourselves
[36:38] examine yourselves by this he will
[36:41] perfect it manads won't do it this
[36:45] that's just a that's just a quick punch
[36:47] but it packs a lot of weight he'll
[36:49] perfect it manads won't do it and he is
[36:51] the word which God was this is going
[36:53] back to answer 302 this is going back to
[36:56] answer for 289 the answer 281 he will
[37:00] perfect it he is the word when the Holy
[37:02] Ghost has come he will identify himself
[37:05] in you with the
[37:07] scripture so taking these things
[37:09] together about
[37:11] qualification if Jesus came preaching
[37:13] Moses's gospel he wouldn't have been the
[37:15] Messiah if Jesus came preaching Noah's
[37:17] gospel he wouldn't have been the Messiah
[37:19] what he preached what he emphasized what
[37:21] he demonstrated was the qualification
[37:24] that he was the Messiah what about the
[37:26] bride she will do this she will do that
[37:28] brother bam says I've got this written
[37:30] out here I've got these questions about
[37:31] she'll do this and she'll do that but
[37:33] when that which is perfect has
[37:35] come she's under an elect Ministry to
[37:37] bring her to what Perfection he will
[37:39] perfect it manads won't do it the Holy
[37:42] Ghost will identify himself in you
[37:44] according to the word and that is the
[37:46] true sign that the holy spirit is in you
[37:48] because it is the word now
[37:51] look what if you spoke with tongues I
[37:55] just want to ask you that now he's
[37:56] asking the question
[37:58] questions Jesus said when the Holy Ghost
[38:00] come what would he do and what if you
[38:02] spoke with tongues jumped up and down
[38:04] shouted and everything else and then
[38:06] come the
[38:08] word you notice where where he's
[38:09] bringing
[38:10] this there is all sorts of things that
[38:13] one can do and uh uh this is just life
[38:16] if you look at in the pattern when I was
[38:17] a child what let me say it this way Paul
[38:21] says when I was a child I thought as a
[38:22] child I spake as a child I understood as
[38:24] a child is that evidence that he can
[38:26] never be a man
[38:29] when you were 8 years old you did this
[38:31] and you did that you can never be a man
[38:34] you'll never grow up well I mean it it's
[38:37] there's not it's not a sentence or a
[38:40] condemnation it's not judgment they
[38:42] saying so you spoke with tongues you
[38:43] jumped it down shouted and everything we
[38:45] said now here's the real test where
[38:48] where do things stand then the word
[38:51] comes you come to a place where the word
[38:54] begins to open up or things are uh being
[38:56] identified in your life life and things
[38:58] are you're being challenged with certain
[38:59] things then the word comes I'm saying it
[39:01] what's your
[39:03] response and I prove to you by the
[39:05] scriptures I have that the baptism using
[39:07] the title of Father Son and Holy Ghost
[39:09] is absolutely a misunderstanding of the
[39:13] scripture nobody was ever baptized like
[39:15] that and you go ahead and hang with it
[39:17] anyhow could you tell me the Holy Spirit
[39:20] and you would do a thing like
[39:21] that how can it deny its own
[39:25] word now what is he referring to the
[39:27] evidence of the Holy
[39:28] Ghost now I'm not I'm not saying that we
[39:31] should just P pin it down to if I asked
[39:33] any one of you well in Revelations 13 it
[39:35] says this what is that you're
[39:37] like true true or false this or that and
[39:40] you get it wrong it's like well I must
[39:41] not have the Holy Ghost because I I
[39:42] couldn't get the trivia question
[39:43] answered just right in the time allotted
[39:46] to me it's not it's not a game of
[39:49] Jeopardy there
[39:51] is it is the it's as the word would be
[39:54] presented I I want you to I want you to
[39:56] really think about it not just make
[39:58] these knee-jerk reject you know things
[40:00] like oh well you know if it's not that
[40:02] quick then you don't have the Holy Ghost
[40:04] but and I and I'm not trying to water
[40:06] down what he's saying but the point is
[40:08] could the Holy Spirit deny the word no
[40:12] it
[40:13] cannot so when it it is there is there
[40:17] something in you now this is brother
[40:20] Aaron saying this is there something in
[40:23] you that when the word can get past the
[40:26] mind and all your senses and everything
[40:29] in between is there something in you
[40:31] that can ultimately resonate and say
[40:32] Amen to the word of God can the holy
[40:34] spirit in you say yes to that once it's
[40:37] fought through all unbelief and all
[40:38] darkness and everything that clouds the
[40:40] channels and everything's that in way do
[40:42] you have it in you at the end of the day
[40:43] to humble yourself to the word of God
[40:44] and say I know that's the truth I've
[40:46] wrestled with it I fought it I didn't
[40:48] believe it I struggled with it for years
[40:50] I was taught wrong I misunderstood but
[40:52] here now as the word is opening up to it
[40:54] something in my heart says Amen to that
[40:55] I believe that
[40:59] and he says when I show you what's
[41:00] supposed to take place in this day how
[41:03] that the son of man is to reveal himself
[41:05] what he's to do and all these scripture
[41:07] that's been now and then see him come
[41:08] right down and identify and you hang
[41:10] right on to a denomination and say that
[41:12] you're born again could you make sense
[41:14] out of
[41:16] that this is Brother brandham provoking
[41:19] thought about what about the evidence
[41:23] when someone is really filled the Holy
[41:25] Ghost he says a lot of things you could
[41:28] do but when it comes to that word where
[41:29] do you stand for yourself now trust me
[41:33] he's not given us a metric by which we
[41:34] can all kind of sit down and with the
[41:36] help of AI come up with a rubric so that
[41:38] we can judge people could and we'll just
[41:41] go to a we'll go to a a restaurant and
[41:43] we'll just pull people as they walk in
[41:44] just excuse me do you have a moment I
[41:46] want to ask you a few questions do you
[41:47] determine whether or not you got the
[41:48] Holy Ghost are we good okay there and
[41:50] we're going to ask the questions and
[41:52] we're going to follow the chart and once
[41:53] they've said no or yes or whatever else
[41:55] we thank you and they're like well what
[41:57] what how did I do do I have the Holy
[41:58] Ghost oh no you clearly don't have the
[41:59] Holy Ghost because we were able to kind
[42:01] of ask the questions gave you the word
[42:03] test and you denied it now this is for
[42:05] you this is for you to think about this
[42:08] is for you to challenge yourself for you
[42:09] to be honest with yourself brother M's
[42:11] calling out the intellectual honesty of
[42:13] preachers who will say one thing and not
[42:15] be honest about the fact that the word
[42:17] says
[42:20] another and he says could you make sense
[42:23] out of that and you hang with it anyhow
[42:26] he says could I tell my wife I love her
[42:28] and have a date with another woman and
[42:29] run around and then tell her from my
[42:31] heart I love her you think that'd be
[42:33] true love could she tell me she loves me
[42:35] and while I'm gone gone away she run
[42:37] around with some other
[42:39] man like that's that escalated quickly I
[42:42] thought we were just talking about water
[42:44] baptism and now you you're talking about
[42:47] adultery same thing right that spiritual
[42:51] adultery is related to physical
[42:54] adultery people can rant and rail they
[42:57] want against homosexuality but they have
[42:59] spiritual homosexual lesbian spirits
[43:02] that govern their churches that's all it
[43:05] is and they'll be blew in the face
[43:07] yelling and screaming about sexual sin
[43:10] and they they are the ones propagating
[43:15] it and he says that's exactly what
[43:18] Israel done he said you've set your
[43:19] limbs apart and taken every man that
[43:20] come by and you played the part of the
[43:23] whoredom with me and I'll put you away
[43:24] in
[43:25] divorce exactly what is that you're
[43:27] committing adultery against your own
[43:29] body and when a woman goes out and lives
[43:31] with another man or a man with another
[43:33] woman when they're married to them
[43:34] they're defiling their own
[43:35] flesh and when a person says that he's a
[43:38] Christian will absolutely deny the
[43:40] scripture being right he's committing
[43:42] adultery against the body that he claims
[43:43] to be in so it's a mark of antichrist so
[43:48] much that it would deceive the elected
[43:50] if
[43:52] possible when the Holy Ghost will
[43:55] come the true evidence that one has been
[43:58] filled with the Holy Ghost now not a
[44:01] baptism of the Holy Ghost upon your
[44:04] body not an anointing that can fall but
[44:08] when one is really filled by an
[44:10] experience of the Holy Ghost is sealed
[44:12] in the soul he's saying what is that
[44:15] evidence he says he will perfect it not
[44:19] manads but the Holy Ghost will come and
[44:22] identify himself in you with the
[44:25] scripture so there it we would desire to
[44:28] not have any misunderstanding the
[44:30] scripture we would desire to know what
[44:32] this revelation of the son of man is we
[44:35] do not want to be unfaithful to the word
[44:37] which we are a part of which brother
[44:39] bradam is saying to deny the word or to
[44:41] fail to fulfill the word or to reject
[44:42] the word would be just as guilty as
[44:44] committing adultery and the natural uh
[44:46] and type we cannot deny the scripture
[44:49] because we would be committing adultery
[44:51] against the body that we're a part of
[44:53] and he calls out this Mark of the
[44:54] Antichrist that's so close it could
[44:56] deceive the ctive possible so there is a
[44:59] qualification there is an identification
[45:02] there is a Vindication and a
[45:04] manifestation of whether or not one has
[45:06] truly been sealed by the Holy
[45:09] Ghost and it has something to
[45:12] do with putting away childish things and
[45:15] becoming a
[45:17] man 1 Corinthians chapter 13:
[45:21] 10-13 but when that which is perfect is
[45:23] come then that which is in part shall be
[45:25] done away when I was a child I spake as
[45:28] a
[45:31] child I understood as a child I thought
[45:35] as a child but when I became a man I put
[45:39] away childish
[45:47] things the
[45:51] Bible refers to be speaking like a man
[45:54] and speak to one as a man
[45:58] so much that comes to my mind when I
[45:59] begin to think about these things and I
[46:01] as I have just felt so
[46:03] burdened uh in these things for quite
[46:05] some time and studied on it so there's a
[46:07] lot of scriptural images we've studied
[46:09] and things we've
[46:11] considered and there's a way that you
[46:13] talk to uh an infant there's a way
[46:16] you'll talk to a toddler and it's not
[46:18] the same way that you would talk to an
[46:22] adult and I could just imagine if we
[46:24] were in a a deacon meting and I was like
[46:28] brother Mike honey if you could just be
[46:31] sure to do this and just talk to him in
[46:33] he might be like you're kind of weirded
[46:35] me out brother Aaron right like that's
[46:37] no way to talk to a man right you g
[46:39] yourself like a man speak like a man
[46:40] speak face to face and there's a way
[46:42] that you talk and maybe we've seen it at
[46:44] times when maybe an adult will talk to
[46:46] their child in such a way to where it's
[46:48] like that's kind of baby talk for that
[46:52] age right it's like how that how are
[46:55] they ever going to talk like an adult
[46:57] when the adults always talk to them like
[46:59] yeah you going to high school today huh
[47:03] first day Senor you're a Senor now huh
[47:06] look at you big senior right like like
[47:08] let's talk talk like a grownup to
[47:11] somebody who's a of age of a particular
[47:14] age and so he says when I became a
[47:18] man I put away childish things for now
[47:23] notice this for now I hope I read all of
[47:25] that but for now we see through a glass
[47:28] Darkly it it's not perfectly clear but
[47:31] then face to face now I know in part but
[47:35] then for now but then for now but then
[47:42] but then shall I know even as also I am
[47:45] known and now abideth faith hope charity
[47:49] these three but the greatest of these is
[47:53] Charity that's the Capstone that's the
[47:56] Finish finishing that's the perfecting
[47:58] of the stature that's the final work
[48:00] that's the piece that completes
[48:02] it that is that which is perfect is
[48:07] come now Darkly now as in a
[48:11] mirror that isn't quite clear I'm not
[48:14] sure I can't see it I'm not it's not
[48:16] level it's not where I fully can
[48:18] comprehend what I'm looking at but face
[48:19] to face I want you to think of it this
[48:21] way when you're face to face your eye to
[48:23] eye what does it speak of the same
[48:25] stature
[48:27] there's a time as children you look
[48:29] up and it's not eye to eye there's a
[48:32] time when it is disproportionate in the
[48:34] sense that as as as a child or as the
[48:37] younger you serve the Elder and you give
[48:39] the respect and you never grow up enough
[48:41] to show disrespect but there is a
[48:43] scriptural principle that as the child
[48:45] grows and ages there's a point at which
[48:47] he is accepted he is accepted and it's
[48:50] eye to eye it is it is a peer
[48:53] relationship says now I see through
[48:55] glass Darkly now there it's
[48:57] disproportionate in my understanding and
[48:59] what my experience and what I've been
[49:01] taught and what I know but then it will
[49:02] be face to face it'll be I to eye I have
[49:05] grown to where we can see eye to eye we
[49:09] can we can think alike and we can see
[49:11] alike and I've matured enough because
[49:13] then he says I shall know as I am known
[49:14] in other words I have
[49:17] matured you you know me you know things
[49:19] about me parents know things about their
[49:21] children they know the way that they're
[49:22] going they know what's coming so they
[49:24] teach them they train them and there's a
[49:26] point at which that child comes to a
[49:27] place where the adults need to stop
[49:29] using a language to suggest that they
[49:31] ain't done nothing they ain't been
[49:33] nowhere I get those people whenever you
[49:36] have a kid because they have two oh just
[49:38] wait till you have two right they're
[49:41] just always ahead of you all right so
[49:44] yeah you could be pastoring a church for
[49:45] 30 years and you could be 66 years old
[49:48] and the pastor who's 96 just wait till
[49:50] your 96 little young pup right but when
[49:54] he was 66 he was the E eth messenger
[49:56] right he was he could do
[49:58] everything and so there's this always
[50:00] idea this idea of well no one's ever
[50:02] going to be good enough and no one can
[50:03] ever achieve and Paul is recognizing no
[50:06] the servant will become like his master
[50:08] they shall see eye to eye face to face
[50:11] then I will know is even also I am known
[50:15] and I'd like to say this in in direct uh
[50:18] commentary on what brother bam is saying
[50:20] in question and answers that what God
[50:22] did in changing the
[50:24] age where brother Brown's talk about
[50:27] qualification and he's talking about um
[50:29] Luther's age and Wesley's age and the
[50:31] age of the uh outpouring of the Holy
[50:33] Ghost and the restoration of the gifts
[50:35] and brother brandom orienting us to the
[50:37] qualification the word for today the
[50:39] scriptural principles for today what God
[50:41] did in changing the
[50:43] age he demonstrates what his purpose is
[50:46] for the new
[50:48] birth if God only wanted the
[50:52] church to I I I think I need to be
[50:55] careful how I say this cuz I don't want
[50:57] to misrepresent this at all we
[50:59] understand that God has a purpose and
[51:02] it's not just the purpose of
[51:05] birthing it it wasn't just the purpose
[51:07] oh they're here throw them on the Shelf
[51:10] let's go get another one right and it
[51:12] it's it's not not taking inventory but
[51:15] and just stacking rocks but brother M
[51:17] talks about end time evangelism being
[51:18] the shaping of the stone to fit and so
[51:22] this the purpose of the new birth is
[51:24] reflected in how that God transition in
[51:26] all ages from the feet all the way up to
[51:28] the head and how God's transitioned all
[51:30] the way up to the intelligence there is
[51:32] this growth in stature as it matures and
[51:35] comes out in
[51:36] Perfection and it's manifesting the
[51:39] change of justification to
[51:40] sanctification to Restoration of the
[51:42] gifts to the Perfection demonstrates
[51:44] what God's purpose is in the new birth
[51:47] which is formed in those three stages
[51:49] that through the new birth we're to come
[51:50] to a place of maturity and
[51:55] Perfection and brother in the sermon
[51:57] marriage and
[51:59] divorce I want to just I want to try to
[52:01] wrap this up as soon as possible this
[52:03] evening but then face to face but then
[52:05] shall I know when that which is perfect
[52:08] has come brother Bram says when the
[52:10] seals are opened is that not what the
[52:12] question was when the perfect word is
[52:14] restored what happened when the seals
[52:15] were open when the seals are open the
[52:17] spirit of Truth directs us to the word
[52:20] that explains why all the mistakes have
[52:22] been made Through the Ages because the
[52:23] seals were not open this was not
[52:25] revealed
[52:26] now we could debate all we want on well
[52:28] they didn't need the seals and the first
[52:30] church didn't have the seals and the
[52:31] seals revealed what's been left off and
[52:33] we could try to get bogged down and
[52:34] semantics but we have to realize that
[52:37] whatever the reasons were and whatever
[52:38] we could diagnose about what's been we
[52:41] know at least for now mistakes were made
[52:43] because things were hid mistakes were
[52:45] made because things had been chained up
[52:47] mistakes were made because things had
[52:49] been mistaught but then God has a time
[52:51] and an hour where he's going to set the
[52:53] record straight he's going to tie up
[52:54] Loose Ends he's going to reveal the
[52:56] perfect word and the perfect word is
[52:58] what we need for our age we can even say
[53:02] that perfect faith is a faith that is
[53:03] necessary for the moment you're in you
[53:06] say I need perfect faith if it's if
[53:09] whatever the your situation you're in
[53:11] whatever it is you're facing whatever it
[53:12] is you're going through the perfect
[53:13] faith for that moment would be the faith
[53:15] you need to overcome to withstand to to
[53:17] to receive what you have need of and
[53:19] we're living in a time where there's got
[53:21] to be some scriptures fulfilled there's
[53:23] a promise for this age and we need a
[53:25] perfect Faith to meet the mark of this
[53:27] age and therefore the word had to be
[53:29] opened up and he said this is the reason
[53:31] why we didn't have we had these mistakes
[53:36] because this wasn't revealed why is it
[53:38] we make mistakes as we grow up because
[53:40] we didn't know and what do some of why
[53:42] do what do
[53:45] even even parental love and parental
[53:47] care will allow children to make
[53:49] mistakes so they can learn now I'm not
[53:52] talking about life altering traumatizing
[53:55] mistakes well you wanted to jump off
[53:57] that cliff without a parachute uh no but
[53:59] just uh um allowing them to experience
[54:03] and to make decisions and it helped them
[54:05] to learn and there's they make mistakes
[54:07] because they didn't know and sometimes
[54:10] they make mistakes because when we
[54:11] taught we didn't teach it clearly we
[54:13] make a lot of assumptions about what
[54:14] they should know I can't tell you how
[54:16] many times I say on a daily basis could
[54:19] you get that and put it
[54:21] there and I know exactly what that is
[54:23] and I know exactly what there is and the
[54:25] the child is sitting there
[54:27] going what is that and where is there
[54:31] I'm like don't use that in a sentence
[54:33] and there's a there's a some sort of
[54:35] meeting to minds and it's like that that
[54:38] put it there like what's that where's
[54:41] there right and if you have the wrong
[54:43] kind of demeanor they're just grabbing
[54:45] anything and putting it everywhere
[54:47] because they don't want to get it wrong
[54:50] and so there has to be some a pause to
[54:52] say oh I'm sorry please take that stack
[54:55] of $100 bill
[54:57] and put it next to my dresser right we
[54:59] have them just
[55:01] everywhere and so there's there's this
[55:04] you very
[55:05] specific very specific instructions and
[55:07] so we know that we as parents can do
[55:09] better in how we articulate and we learn
[55:11] and we grow and we
[55:13] understand and by the time we raise our
[55:15] fourth one we just get it
[55:18] perfect but the seals are open brother
[55:21] BR said the third pull is the opening of
[55:22] The Seven Seals to reveal the hidden
[55:24] truth that's been sealed in the word
[55:27] now you may take exception to this you
[55:28] may not believe this you may not think
[55:30] that this pertains to brother brandom
[55:31] you may think brother bram's a false
[55:32] prophet you may think these things are
[55:34] going to happen that's all fine that's
[55:36] all well and good but at least you know
[55:37] what he
[55:38] said I stand by this is what brother
[55:41] random taught brother ROM taught that
[55:42] the seals are open in his
[55:46] ministry and the third pull is the
[55:48] opening of those
[55:50] seals the spirit of Truth directing us
[55:53] to the word not in part he so the whole
[55:56] thing's revealed so we know what's going
[55:58] to happen on day 362 of the Millennium
[55:59] no no that's not it the word that was
[56:02] promised to us the time and the season
[56:04] that we're living
[56:05] in and in John chap 16:
[56:08] 12-13 I have yet many things to say unto
[56:11] you but you cannot bear them now what a
[56:16] statement remember what Paul said to the
[56:18] Hebrew church I got a lot of things I
[56:19] want to say but I'm not sure you can
[56:20] handle
[56:21] it he says you can't bear them now
[56:24] you're at a season you're at a time
[56:25] you're in a particular place in your
[56:26] experience right now to where the things
[56:28] that I might say might not be fruitful
[56:30] for you how be it when he the spirit of
[56:32] Truth has come he will guide you into
[56:34] all Truth for he will not speak of
[56:37] himself but whatsoever he shall hear
[56:39] that he shall speak that shall he speak
[56:42] and he will show you things to come it's
[56:45] the exact language brother manam was
[56:46] talking about he will perfect
[56:49] it under the opening of the word the
[56:52] spirit of Truth directs us to the word
[56:54] we have the spirit of Truth direct us to
[56:56] to the word there's things that the
[56:58] spirit of Truth is wanting to do guide
[56:59] us that's to instruct us it's to teach
[57:01] us into all
[57:03] truth show you things to
[57:06] come remember brother brandom had the
[57:08] vision of the third pool had different
[57:10] parts to it the most notable would be
[57:12] the one that we call the ENT Vision but
[57:15] it's had different parts and what
[57:16] brother man's trying to lace up that
[57:17] booty and what did the spirit say to
[57:19] when he made a mess of it you can't
[57:20] teach Pentecostal babies Supernatural
[57:23] things you'll create carnal
[57:25] impersonations
[57:27] they will you'll cause carnal
[57:29] impersonations you can't teach
[57:31] Pentecostal babies Supernatural
[57:34] things it's quite a statement but it has
[57:37] to do with the third pool there are
[57:39] Supernatural things that the spirit of
[57:41] Truth is to direct us too but it can
[57:44] only be learned as you grow can only be
[57:46] learned as you're willing to
[57:48] grow he says how can I teach you algebra
[57:50] when you can't understand your ABCs
[57:52] that's why you can't teach Supernatural
[57:54] things to Pentecostal uh babies is
[57:56] because there's not they're not
[57:58] apprehending they're not growing they're
[57:59] not Desiring they're not willing to sit
[58:01] and listen and to
[58:03] learn so Paul saying brother brandom I
[58:06] believe bringing it into our view and I
[58:07] know I've just thrown a lot there as
[58:09] hopefully just maybe I've focused in
[58:11] quite a bit to see a lot of granular
[58:12] things but this adulthood becoming a man
[58:15] is marked by becoming not aging we can't
[58:19] say well I've been I've been preaching
[58:21] this message for 46 years I've been a
[58:23] Believer for 50 years and say that
[58:25] that's some sort of Mark of maturity
[58:27] it's becoming not
[58:29] aging and the becoming has to do in some
[58:32] ways with putting away childish
[58:35] things in John 14:26 but when the
[58:38] comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom
[58:41] the father will send in my name he shall
[58:43] teach you all things and bring all
[58:45] things to your
[58:47] remembrance whatsoever I had said unto
[58:49] you this is what brother bam said is the
[58:51] real evidence when one is filled the
[58:53] Holy Ghost when the Holy Ghost has come
[58:54] he'll show you things come he will
[58:56] perfect it man-made won't do it I
[58:59] thought I had this in there I don't
[59:00] think I do I have a a statement from the
[59:02] church age book in there in the next
[59:03] slide I thought it was in the notes I
[59:05] just noticed that I must have uh printed
[59:07] the wrong copy or saved the wrong copy
[59:09] but brother bam says I want you to note
[59:11] very carefully that Jesus did not say
[59:14] that the evidence of being baptized with
[59:16] the Holy Ghost was speaking in tongues
[59:18] interpreting prophesying or shouting and
[59:22] dancing he said the evidence would be
[59:24] that you would be in the truth
[59:26] you would be in the word of God for your
[59:29] age evidence has to do with receiving
[59:32] that
[59:34] word so how could we have the Holy Ghost
[59:37] and deny any part of the word how could
[59:40] we act like balam or run in the air the
[59:42] way of Cain or or or being the gains of
[59:44] cor to accept partial truth and reject
[59:47] the rest of
[59:49] it Jesus did not emphasize works over
[59:52] the word he did not say that the
[59:55] evidence of the Holy GH ghost would be
[59:57] speaking in tongues interpreting
[59:59] prophesying or shouting and dancing it
[1:00:01] would be that you would be in the truth
[1:00:03] that's what the scripture stands for
[1:00:04] that when the Holy Spirit comes he will
[1:00:06] teach you all things and bring all
[1:00:08] things to your remembrance the evidence
[1:00:09] of the Holy Ghost may not be able to be
[1:00:11] discerned outwardly but you should be
[1:00:13] able to know inwardly that the holy
[1:00:15] spirit is teaching you all things and
[1:00:18] bringing all things to your remembrance
[1:00:20] the inside teachers teaching me all
[1:00:22] things and then reminding me when I need
[1:00:24] to know it teaching me all things
[1:00:26] reminding me of what he taught me
[1:00:28] teaching me all things bringing all
[1:00:29] things to my remembrance that's the real
[1:00:31] gift of the Holy
[1:00:33] Ghost it's the process of hearing
[1:00:36] recognizing obeying this process of
[1:00:38] disciplining ourselves making
[1:00:41] application the world the world has it
[1:00:44] in their disciplines and the biohacking
[1:00:47] and all the things that people do and
[1:00:49] and they come up with all sorts of ways
[1:00:50] to try to maximize their health and
[1:00:52] their thought process and their thinking
[1:00:54] and they streamline all sorts of process
[1:00:56] is where they'll never take a hot shower
[1:00:57] only cold ones they eat avocado ice
[1:00:59] cream or whatever it is they do they
[1:01:01] just are so obsessed with being the best
[1:01:03] person that they are that they
[1:01:04] discipline themselves according to what
[1:01:06] they've taught and what they've been
[1:01:07] learned that's going to make them the
[1:01:09] best athlete or the best whatever right
[1:01:12] and it's amazing the propensity that we
[1:01:13] can have in the natural things and
[1:01:15] discipline ourselves so carefully to
[1:01:17] Natural things but not do anything when
[1:01:20] it comes to spiritual things that we
[1:01:23] know if we're going to be honest are the
[1:01:29] truth Ecclesiastes 10:16 to1 17 woe to
[1:01:33] the o
[1:01:35] land I said D woe to thee o land when
[1:01:38] thy King is a
[1:01:40] child and thy princes eat in the
[1:01:43] morning it's not taking a a diss on a k
[1:01:46] a king that's 8 years old or 12 years
[1:01:49] old if they were you might
[1:01:52] expect a lack of sensitivity a lack of
[1:01:55] discernment some wisdom in certain
[1:01:57] matters and it would be according to
[1:01:59] those that He surrounds themselves by
[1:02:00] that would determine the type of
[1:02:01] decision that's being made but says wo
[1:02:03] to thee when th King is a child a boy a
[1:02:05] lad what's amazing is it also means
[1:02:07] servant there's a time at which when a
[1:02:10] child as a child is no different than a
[1:02:12] servant but once he is face to face once
[1:02:15] he's eye to eye once he's grown and he
[1:02:17] can see eye to eye in the stature of the
[1:02:19] father he's no more a servant but he
[1:02:21] becomes a possessor of what he's air to
[1:02:23] woe to thee when thy King is a child
[1:02:27] he's a youth the word means a boy a
[1:02:28] servant a youth childish when he has the
[1:02:30] characteristics and qualities of a child
[1:02:33] when he's emotionally
[1:02:36] immature and this is exactly what Paul
[1:02:38] is referring to he says when a when I
[1:02:39] was a child I thought as a child I acted
[1:02:41] as a child wello to thee when your king
[1:02:43] is a child and thy princes eat in the
[1:02:47] morning this is quite a
[1:02:50] thought and so it's clarified in the
[1:02:53] next statement verse 17 blessed are thou
[1:02:54] o land when thy King is the the son of
[1:02:57] Nobles and thy Prince has eaten due
[1:02:59] season for strength and not for
[1:03:03] drunkenness it's the prioritizing of
[1:03:05] things go back listen to part one of
[1:03:07] this series one thing
[1:03:09] desired it's a maturing it's a learning
[1:03:12] of what what's valued what's important
[1:03:15] if that means I have to forego all sorts
[1:03:16] of things in my life to make myself the
[1:03:19] best human I can be in order that I
[1:03:21] might grow emotionally and spiritually
[1:03:23] that's what we
[1:03:24] do as we prioritize the right things
[1:03:27] when your king is a child when he acts
[1:03:29] like a child he thinks like a child he
[1:03:30] reacts as a child he lives like a child
[1:03:33] he's got no accountability whatsoever no
[1:03:36] rebellious and stubborn that's the
[1:03:37] scriptures I've been studying on this
[1:03:39] the sin of rebellion the sin of uh uh uh
[1:03:42] stubbornness that would only be a child
[1:03:44] who's not willing to learn not willing
[1:03:45] to grow not willing to be instructed and
[1:03:48] I believe that the word as deep as it is
[1:03:50] and as wonderful it is is and as much as
[1:03:52] it's opened up to us it's calling us to
[1:03:54] a place of spiritual maturity and
[1:03:56] emotional maturity and I would say
[1:03:58] number one to us
[1:04:00] men that we're no longer children but
[1:04:03] we're men and it's also so to our wives
[1:04:06] and to our children but let us take the
[1:04:08] responsibility as men that we do not
[1:04:10] want to be as children we do not want to
[1:04:12] be eating for drunkenness eating for
[1:04:14] pleasure but that we do it for strength
[1:04:16] and that we're just dispensing judgment
[1:04:18] first and righteousness first in putting
[1:04:20] the right things
[1:04:22] first so that all things can be done
[1:04:24] decently and in
[1:04:26] order because there is a consequence
[1:04:29] when the
[1:04:30] youngans don't grow
[1:04:32] up may the Lord bless you this evening
[1:04:35] as we stand to our feet musicians come
