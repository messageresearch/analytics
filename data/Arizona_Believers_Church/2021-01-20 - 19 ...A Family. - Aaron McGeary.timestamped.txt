[0:00] prophecies that he brought before us
[0:02] ephesians chapter 5
[0:04] verses 21 and 22 submitting yourselves
[0:08] one to another
[0:09] in the fear of god wives submit
[0:12] yourselves unto your own husbands
[0:13] as unto the lord two very short verses
[0:16] they're not often joined together
[0:17] usually it's just wives submit
[0:18] yourselves to your husbands
[0:19] but notice what he prefaces it with
[0:21] submitting yourselves one to another
[0:24] in the fear of god wives submit
[0:26] yourselves
[0:27] and your own husbands as unto the lord
[0:30] amen you may be seated
[0:32] we're picking up on where we were on
[0:34] sunday
[0:36] and uh
[0:39] and speaking on a family we hadn't done
[0:41] this subject necessarily on wednesday
[0:43] nights but we want to continue
[0:45] and i think there's tremendous
[0:47] continuity as the lord's dealt with my
[0:49] heart even with respect to who is my
[0:50] neighbor and some of those themes and
[0:52] elements we referenced
[0:53] and even the direction that i felt the
[0:54] lord was leading me in terms of who's my
[0:56] neighbor
[0:57] i kind of see this developing and coming
[0:59] together but we're looking at how in the
[1:01] beginning
[1:02] god created a family and that family
[1:04] would be an expression of god
[1:05] because he began to make man in his
[1:07] likeness and adam brother bram said was
[1:09] the son of god
[1:10] eve was a daughter of god and they start
[1:12] out they are the start of that
[1:14] family of god in genesis chapter 1 verse
[1:17] 27 this is where we focused on sunday
[1:19] so god created man in his own image in
[1:22] the image of god created he him
[1:24] male and female created he them
[1:27] and we identified how that god had made
[1:30] the the sex or what we could call later
[1:32] gender
[1:33] and that he had a male and a female and
[1:35] this was only one couple
[1:37] and being only one couple there'd be
[1:38] only one family since there's only one
[1:40] family there'd be only one flesh
[1:42] and it we could possibly speculate that
[1:44] maybe the dna would have been the same
[1:46] for every single one of them
[1:48] such that if you took a dna test and you
[1:49] said well you know who stole the cookie
[1:51] from the cookie jar
[1:52] and you say number two stole the cookie
[1:54] from the cookie jar and he said well
[1:56] let's do a num let's do a gna test on
[1:58] number two and you find that
[1:59] the dna of number two is also the same
[2:01] dna for number six number seven
[2:02] number twelve and number thirty because
[2:05] it would have been one flesh it would
[2:06] have been one
[2:06] one family one couple and so we
[2:10] we looked at how that gender denoted the
[2:12] role of the responsibility that
[2:13] the male and the female had considering
[2:15] god's purpose for creation which comes
[2:17] forth
[2:18] in verse 28. and so the image of god and
[2:21] i want you to think of it that way that
[2:23] it's the image of god we're talking
[2:24] about
[2:24] required very specific and essential
[2:27] designations of male and female
[2:30] and that with the male and with the
[2:31] female there was a certain quality
[2:33] given to them there was characteristics
[2:35] that they would bear there was virtues
[2:36] that they would have that they would
[2:37] have to protect
[2:38] and these were very specific to the
[2:40] expression of god
[2:42] and we saw how in malachi malachi said
[2:44] that god had residue he had the ability
[2:46] he had power
[2:47] to make many males and many females and
[2:49] at least he's suggesting that god had
[2:51] power
[2:52] to make adam and to give him many wives
[2:54] but god was not just wanting
[2:56] uh to have procreation but he wanted to
[2:58] have an expression of himself
[3:00] so it was one man and one woman and this
[3:03] was to have a family
[3:05] bill abraham said he desired in love a
[3:07] family of his own
[3:09] a family of sons sons like himself
[3:13] and so to have a family these are those
[3:14] who descend from a common ancestor
[3:16] in order to have that continuity to have
[3:18] that harmony there'd be one man
[3:20] one woman and they would all descend
[3:22] from the same source
[3:24] they would be coming from god they'd
[3:25] come the way that he ordained it and
[3:27] planned it
[3:28] not many different families but one
[3:29] family coming forth as an expression of
[3:31] god
[3:32] so god desired one family in agreement
[3:35] in harmony of one flesh
[3:37] and one spirit and so if if that being
[3:40] review and that was all the amens i get
[3:42] on a review then i'm just expecting a
[3:43] really quiet night for the next hour
[3:47] i know you're listening i'd say that uh
[3:49] i say that just to be funny
[3:51] not that i am but just trying
[3:54] and then now just continuing so this is
[3:57] more review so here's your chance just
[3:58] to get right back on board with it this
[4:00] is more review this is a statement we
[4:01] used last time
[4:02] god one couple one flesh one dna no
[4:05] subspecies no other genus
[4:07] one man we wouldn't even have homo
[4:08] sapien this would just be man humankind
[4:11] and he says this in satan's eating
[4:13] therefore that was god's purpose to
[4:14] display his attributes in fellowship
[4:17] when i was in my father i knew nothing
[4:18] about it but when i become his son and
[4:20] was born of him i was an attribute
[4:22] a part of my father and you are a part
[4:24] of your father
[4:25] and as children of god we are part of
[4:27] god's attributes that were in him
[4:29] made flesh like he was made flesh so we
[4:31] can have fellowship one with the other
[4:33] as a family of god upon the earth and he
[4:36] says and that was god's purpose at the
[4:39] beginning
[4:40] so what was god's purpose at the
[4:41] beginning that sons would be an
[4:43] expression of him
[4:44] daughter would be an expression of him
[4:46] that they would all become a part of god
[4:48] and that eventually god is going to be
[4:49] expressed
[4:50] as a family so that's what god wanted at
[4:52] the beginning
[4:53] so family was god's ultimate family is
[4:56] what god was wanting to accomplish and i
[4:58] realized that's kind of a general term
[5:00] that encompasses a lot of different
[5:02] things but we see god in the beginning
[5:04] creating a family and it's going to be
[5:06] through that dynamic that god
[5:08] is going to be made known and going to
[5:10] be expressed
[5:11] so in genesis chapter 2 verses 22 to 23
[5:15] it says and the rib which the lord god
[5:16] had taken from man made he
[5:18] a woman and brought her unto the man so
[5:21] it's not just male and female
[5:23] but now there's a different language
[5:24] that's being used and brought her unto
[5:26] the man
[5:27] and now adam's speaking adam which is
[5:30] the same word for man
[5:31] it's mankind but it's given as a proper
[5:33] noun a proper name
[5:34] and adam said this is now bone of my
[5:37] bones
[5:38] and flesh of my flesh essence of my
[5:40] essence she shall be called
[5:42] woman because she was taken out of the
[5:45] man
[5:46] so god separates male and female he
[5:48] gives each one a very specific fleshly
[5:50] characteristics and they have this they
[5:52] have a representation in the flesh
[5:54] they are given each a different spirit
[5:56] masculine spirit feminine spirit
[5:57] and god divides them and separates male
[6:00] and female and it becomes man and woman
[6:02] so this is divine design this is how god
[6:05] orchestrated it
[6:06] we're not talking about what happens
[6:07] subsequently once mankind becomes
[6:09] deluded and
[6:11] and through uh procreation for thousands
[6:13] of years it begins to change
[6:15] and redesign humanity and so god did not
[6:18] make the body so that in natural
[6:20] in the bringing forth of of children
[6:22] according to the original design as god
[6:25] had fathomed it that it would bring
[6:26] forth something that would be perverted
[6:28] or something that would be fallen or
[6:29] something
[6:30] that would uh that would be riddled with
[6:32] cancer or something that would have
[6:34] a deformity that's not how god
[6:35] originally planned it
[6:37] but even scientists today in geneticists
[6:40] would show you that the reason why we
[6:41] have deformities
[6:42] in maladies and certain birth defects
[6:44] and certain conditions is because it's
[6:46] something in the dna
[6:47] something in the coding something in the
[6:49] seed as it comes forth and certain
[6:51] factors come to bear
[6:52] to create a variance from what should
[6:54] have been
[6:55] but in the beginning it was god's divine
[6:57] design that there would be male and
[6:59] female and god divided humanity
[7:01] so that humanity could fulfill genesis 1
[7:03] 28
[7:04] which was the divine it was a divine
[7:06] division so that
[7:08] mankind could fulfill its commission and
[7:11] in doing so god created complementary
[7:13] differences
[7:14] these were differences that complemented
[7:16] each other they didn't create
[7:17] uh the budding of heads and and become
[7:20] uh opposites where they were angry at
[7:22] each other and i hate you
[7:23] and and these different things it was
[7:24] differences but they were complimentary
[7:26] to fulfill god's purpose for mankind and
[7:28] then also
[7:29] to express the nature of god so this is
[7:33] and maybe that concludes the review
[7:35] portion but i want to use those
[7:36] scriptures in genesis 2
[7:38] verses 22 and 23 just to see this is
[7:41] god's unfolding family
[7:42] in genesis 1 it's male and female now
[7:45] it's man and woman
[7:47] and what you'll find later in verse 24
[7:50] it's father and mother
[7:51] so there's an unfolding of god's family
[7:54] and
[7:54] adam was called adam or adam he's just
[7:57] called man but now he receives a new
[7:59] title
[8:00] after the woman comes forth because adam
[8:02] is now ish
[8:04] and we've mentioned this before but i'm
[8:05] using this just building these blocks
[8:07] together so we can come to a point
[8:09] in this the second part of the service
[8:12] and so when he's
[8:13] now and this is how it's phrased he sees
[8:15] her and this is adam speaking
[8:17] she shall be called woman so it's adam
[8:20] naming her
[8:21] because she was taken out of man and now
[8:23] he renames himself
[8:25] he's not adam anymore he calls himself
[8:27] east
[8:28] and so the manifestation of the woman
[8:30] let this let this be the part you begin
[8:32] to just kind of
[8:33] focus on and strike you the
[8:35] manifestation of the woman
[8:36] brought out another attribute of the man
[8:41] so now when the woman comes forth he's
[8:42] just he's adam he's man
[8:44] but now when the woman comes forth the
[8:46] title or the name that he's given it's
[8:48] not
[8:48] adam it's east that's used in the hebrew
[8:50] and so now it confers upon him a
[8:52] different title
[8:54] now i can use title and name
[8:56] interchangeably merely just a reference
[8:58] to the way that you're going to
[8:59] speak about somebody or describe
[9:01] somebody
[9:02] and so the title changed because man had
[9:04] entered into
[9:05] a different relationship and you can see
[9:08] how that proper name can change
[9:10] under the same circumstances but here
[9:12] adam who is given a name
[9:14] now he's referred to in a different way
[9:16] and he's actually called man with the
[9:17] capital m
[9:18] and the woman is called woman with the
[9:20] capital w and this doesn't happen
[9:22] until adam now is in relationship with
[9:26] creation differently
[9:27] than he was before the woman was created
[9:30] adam was the god on earth
[9:32] he was the master over creation but now
[9:35] he names himself differently
[9:38] and he gives the woman a name she shall
[9:40] be called woman because she was taken
[9:42] out of man
[9:43] genesis chapter 2 verse 19 it says and
[9:45] out of the ground the lord god formed
[9:47] every beast of the field and every fowl
[9:49] of the air he says this immediately
[9:51] after saying it is not good for man to
[9:52] be alone
[9:53] in verse 18 and brought them unto adam
[9:56] mankind would be the
[9:58] what's being referenced there humanity
[9:59] one man adam to see what he would call
[10:02] them
[10:03] and whatsoever adam called every living
[10:05] creature that was the name thereof
[10:07] and it begins continues to say and adam
[10:09] gave names to the fowl to the creatures
[10:11] to all the beasts upon the earth
[10:13] and so it says that adam is going to is
[10:16] going to
[10:16] call these animals something and
[10:18] whatever he calls these living creatures
[10:20] that will be the name and to call it
[10:22] means to give a name to or call by
[10:24] but it has a deeper meaning it means to
[10:26] commission or to appoint
[10:27] to endow if he calls them they're being
[10:29] commissioned they're being appointed
[10:31] and he says whatever he calls them that
[10:33] will be the name thereof
[10:34] to name it means to set to ordain to
[10:36] establish to a point to constitute
[10:39] or to make something to determine
[10:40] something or to fix something
[10:43] so there's something to a name listen if
[10:45] a name didn't matter we wouldn't stress
[10:46] like we do over a baby's name
[10:49] what's one of the number one rules when
[10:50] you have a name don't tell somebody else
[10:53] the number one rule is not because they
[10:54] will they will steal it but because
[10:56] they'll say oh i remember i had an aunt
[10:58] who was a nancy and boy she was awful or
[11:00] oh i remember
[11:01] i had a sister named peg and she tried
[11:03] to kill me when i was eight or you know
[11:05] there's always a horror story and you go
[11:06] away going oh my goodness i mean i don't
[11:08] ever want to name my kid after that
[11:09] so you keep it a secret but there's
[11:11] something to a name
[11:13] there's something significant to it and
[11:15] i was kind of getting pulled down that
[11:17] channel and i just thought well maybe
[11:18] maybe we'll just leave that off and the
[11:20] lord may quicken it at another time
[11:22] but adam is now not just giving a
[11:24] nomination where so we can know well
[11:26] that's a giraffe
[11:27] or that's a that's a kangaroo but they
[11:29] it appointed something
[11:31] it was determining something it was
[11:34] identifying characteristics and quality
[11:36] and nature
[11:37] and so this naming and this calling
[11:39] establishes something that fixes
[11:40] something and
[11:41] point something so man which was adam is
[11:43] placed as
[11:44] ish which is man so you can say man
[11:47] and man those are the the same words but
[11:49] in the hebrew you had
[11:50] adam but now when the woman comes forth
[11:53] he's placed his ish
[11:54] because he's placed with the woman isha
[11:58] he wasn't ish before there was an esha
[11:59] but now that there's a woman which is
[12:01] esha
[12:01] he comes forth and he changes his own
[12:03] name and he's like well i'm not just
[12:05] adam
[12:06] but i'm also husband he steps into a
[12:09] different relationship
[12:10] now this change of name already is not
[12:12] unfamiliar to us
[12:14] because in verse 4 of genesis chapter 2
[12:16] it says these are the generations of the
[12:17] heavens and the earth
[12:19] that when they were created in the day
[12:21] that the lord god made the earth and the
[12:24] heavens
[12:25] we read in chapter one in the beginning
[12:26] god elohim created the heavens and the
[12:28] earth
[12:29] but now that man has come forth and now
[12:32] that creation is complete
[12:34] god takes on a different designation
[12:35] because god which is elohim
[12:37] is now lord god which is jehovah elohim
[12:41] and we identified this before and kind
[12:43] of reviewed this together
[12:44] as we're all solid message believers
[12:46] with good teaching this reflected a
[12:48] change in god's relationship to creation
[12:50] and now it expressed creation's
[12:52] relationship to god
[12:54] it identified the position of creation
[12:56] it's not just elohim
[12:58] a strong one but now it's jehovah elohim
[13:01] it's god
[13:02] becoming in relationship to his creation
[13:05] and since there's creation
[13:06] god is now lord god not just a god in in
[13:09] a supernatural realm
[13:11] and so the name or the title changed
[13:13] because relationship changed
[13:15] we could say this about god or maybe
[13:17] more particularly about adam but there's
[13:19] a new role
[13:20] elohim once he creates becomes lord god
[13:23] jehovah elohim because now there's a
[13:24] creation
[13:25] he's in a different kind of office you
[13:28] say well
[13:30] if you need a little bit more help on
[13:31] that god wasn't even called god until
[13:37] there was there was angels to worship
[13:39] him and then elohim became god so now
[13:41] that there's those that will reverence
[13:43] him
[13:43] and adore him he's not just elohim but
[13:45] he's an object of worship he's referred
[13:47] to as a god
[13:48] because relationship changed and you
[13:50] could see how this
[13:52] this expression of god as it unfolds and
[13:55] he's known
[13:55] in one way in one sense as elohim but
[13:58] now he
[13:59] makes himself known in a different
[14:00] dispensation and now he's called god
[14:03] even the mess the word godhead is the is
[14:06] godhood
[14:07] like fatherhood what is fatherhood it's
[14:09] a man in the office or the hood
[14:12] of a father and when a man steps in that
[14:15] office
[14:16] and under that hood he becomes a father
[14:18] and that's fatherhood
[14:21] and so if you become a robin
[14:26] so once in this new office it's not just
[14:29] elohim it's god he's an object of
[14:30] worship if the godhead
[14:32] is the office of elohim as a god and it
[14:34] becomes a new role a new responsibility
[14:37] it gives rise to certain duties
[14:39] and this is this is my this is kind of
[14:41] my thesis statement for the next several
[14:43] moments
[14:45] the name did not change the relationship
[14:48] the relationship
[14:48] changed the name so you can't just call
[14:51] yourself something
[14:53] and be some be that call it what you
[14:56] want
[14:57] but it's the relationship that defines
[14:59] the role
[15:01] right you can call yourself whatever you
[15:03] want to call yourself but it's the real
[15:04] it's the work that defines the role
[15:06] it's the work that defines the person
[15:08] that's why some peop sometimes people
[15:10] get caught up in just what you're going
[15:11] to call them
[15:12] and just make me a vp just make me a vp
[15:15] it's like fine
[15:16] you're the vp of office maintenance
[15:18] they're like yes i'm the vp of office
[15:20] maintenance
[15:21] but in the work they're the janitor
[15:23] right
[15:24] and the work they're doing and the labor
[15:26] and it's the work and the labor and it's
[15:27] the pay it's the reward that really
[15:29] defines what the office is
[15:30] don't just get hung up on a title oh
[15:32] there's a posting for this fancy
[15:34] job listing get down in the details what
[15:36] kind of work is being done what kind of
[15:38] pay is there and don't get worried about
[15:40] the the name on the marquee or the name
[15:42] on the sign or the name on the business
[15:43] card you want to know what the work
[15:45] what work is being done because it's the
[15:48] work that
[15:48] determines who the person really is so
[15:51] the name didn't change the relationship
[15:53] man adam said i'm now
[15:55] man i'm no longer adam and then he
[15:57] became husband but once his relationship
[15:59] changed and there was a further
[16:00] expression of the woman
[16:01] now because of a real genuine role and
[16:04] responsibility
[16:05] and change of relationship he could take
[16:07] on a different name
[16:08] so remember that it's not just calling
[16:10] it something but it's the operation and
[16:12] function of it
[16:13] that determines the descriptive heading
[16:15] or the name that's given to it
[16:18] biller branham says this and a man
[16:19] running from the presence of the lord he
[16:20] said if i was a young man and looking
[16:22] for a wife
[16:25] to be married and here stood a girl that
[16:27] meant every qualification that i thought
[16:29] it took to make a woman
[16:30] why morally she was a king queen excuse
[16:33] me
[16:34] and lovely and a fine personality
[16:37] a real christian everything that i could
[16:39] think of to make me a good wife
[16:41] no matter how much i say she's perfect
[16:43] she's exactly right
[16:45] she isn't mine until i accept her
[16:48] and the responsibility of her being my
[16:51] wife
[16:52] and it's in you could just it's what
[16:55] brother brahms alluding to
[16:56] oftentimes maybe somebody feels like oh
[16:58] man i got the revelation she's the one
[17:00] she's my wife hey no matter how much
[17:02] you've got the revelation
[17:04] she's not yours until there's a uniting
[17:08] that takes place
[17:09] no matter what it is that you feel god
[17:11] has shown you and how strong you feel
[17:13] about that conviction brother ben said
[17:14] hey
[17:15] she could be perfect she could be the
[17:16] perfect choice she can be everything
[17:18] that you want but she's not yours and
[17:19] you don't have claims on her or
[17:21] responsibility to her until you accept
[17:24] her and you're joined together
[17:26] as husband and wife and it's at that
[17:28] time of that union
[17:29] that there's a there's a transfer of
[17:31] headship there's a time of that union
[17:33] when you actually take on the
[17:35] responsibility is that true
[17:38] that's why that's why men and brothers
[17:41] and young brothers especially have a
[17:42] sacred trust
[17:43] to to not defile the headship that a
[17:46] father has
[17:47] over his daughter and within his family
[17:49] and not try to usurp that and cause it
[17:51] to transfer before its time
[17:53] because that you she's not yours and you
[17:56] don't have responsibility
[17:57] until you take her to be a wife and
[17:59] that's something that god you're going
[18:00] to do before the presence of witnesses
[18:02] and that's when the father gives her
[18:03] over symbolically maybe just in the
[18:05] wedding ceremony but that's when the
[18:07] transfer takes place
[18:09] and so it's this is just using this by
[18:11] way of an example
[18:12] brother man says that it's when you take
[18:14] her you accept her and the
[18:15] responsibility of her being your wife
[18:17] that's when she's yours and that's when
[18:19] the man goes from fiance to husband
[18:22] and so there's a change of title by
[18:24] virtue of the change of relationship
[18:27] now the the emphasis then
[18:31] by just raising those principles and
[18:33] laying them down very quickly
[18:34] is that family is defined by
[18:36] relationships
[18:38] and it's the uh a relationship is um
[18:42] it's something a state or a condition a
[18:44] position of being related to something
[18:46] else
[18:47] and that's just your textbook definition
[18:49] of what a relationship is
[18:50] that state or position the ship state or
[18:52] position or an office
[18:54] of being related or connected to
[18:56] something so you can have a relationship
[18:58] of two inanimate objects and how they're
[19:00] connected or how they relate to each
[19:02] other
[19:02] so relationships can extend beyond
[19:05] personal relationships but that's what
[19:07] we're looking at family
[19:08] is defined by personal relationships
[19:10] among different people
[19:12] as it says in psalm 68 verse 6 we read
[19:15] it sunday
[19:15] god setteth the solitary in families
[19:19] what is he saying he places someone who
[19:22] is alone
[19:23] in association to others for a purpose
[19:26] because someone on their own and by
[19:28] themselves uh
[19:30] they they're not family except for the
[19:32] relationship to something else
[19:34] adam was an expression of family how not
[19:37] because he was
[19:38] alone but because he was a son of god
[19:40] and so because of his relationship to
[19:42] god
[19:42] it's an expression of family when the
[19:44] woman comes forth you see an expression
[19:46] of family
[19:46] because you see man and woman but also
[19:49] son and daughter
[19:50] as an expression of family so it's when
[19:52] the solitary
[19:53] are set in families that that's what
[19:55] creates relationship
[19:56] and that's what a family is it's a it's
[19:58] a set of relationships among different
[20:00] people or between two people
[20:03] god set at the solitary in family so
[20:05] family is defined by
[20:07] relationships and that's where you get
[20:08] headings that's where you get names and
[20:10] titles
[20:11] now in the message spiritual amnesia and
[20:13] this principle
[20:15] is uh a worthy of a lot more attention
[20:18] because it has much breadth
[20:19] he says we are identified with our
[20:21] families in this human life
[20:23] by marriage so we are identified with
[20:24] our families by marriage
[20:26] and with our wives we marry and our
[20:28] family is identified
[20:30] by the union of our marriage this is
[20:33] very
[20:34] obvious to all of us because on the most
[20:36] basic level
[20:37] even our names are identifying us in
[20:40] natural life with family
[20:42] and we were talking about this the other
[20:43] day as a family that you can legally go
[20:45] and petition a court to have your name
[20:48] changed and you can legally change your
[20:50] name so that it has nothing to do with
[20:51] natural family
[20:53] but we're not looking at the exceptions
[20:54] to the rule but the general rule is that
[20:56] even by virtue of your last name
[20:58] you're identified with a family and
[21:00] brother bam is using it further than
[21:02] just names says we're identified with
[21:03] our families by marriage our family is
[21:05] identified by the union of our marriage
[21:07] well that's a very deep statement
[21:09] because family strains and family
[21:11] characteristics and family tendencies
[21:14] are joined together now when man and a
[21:15] woman unite there's a joining of family
[21:18] history there's a joining of family
[21:19] genetics there's things that come
[21:21] together and so the children of that
[21:23] union are identified by
[21:24] or in the union and so a person our
[21:28] personal identity
[21:30] is strongly connected to family
[21:32] relationships
[21:34] and and i don't i don't say that at all
[21:36] to discourage you brother branham said
[21:38] it himself he says you know i'm a brand
[21:39] i don't have a lot to brag on with being
[21:41] a brand
[21:42] and so we may not have a lot to brag
[21:43] about in our natural lives but we're
[21:45] looking at the concept
[21:47] that we are personally identified with
[21:49] our family and by our family
[21:51] relationships
[21:52] we could use the the gender-neutral term
[21:54] spouse
[21:56] parent child so you're identified
[21:59] they say well are you are you are you
[22:01] married well that's given you
[22:03] uh that's given you an identity of who
[22:04] you are yes i'm married i'm a husband
[22:07] and or do you have children yes i'm a
[22:09] father
[22:09] so these family relationships begin to
[22:12] define
[22:12] and clarify who a person is and isn't
[22:16] those those are some of the questions we
[22:17] ask when we want to know about somebody
[22:18] well are you married yes i'm married do
[22:20] you have children yes
[22:21] you have grandchildren you're learning
[22:23] about that person and you know
[22:24] more about them because of their family
[22:28] now that's just maybe on um on a very
[22:31] surface level but brother bannon makes
[22:32] the statement
[22:33] in influence of another and i don't have
[22:35] the statement here before you but it
[22:36] says family is what you
[22:38] are and he says and he
[22:41] and when he makes that statement he
[22:43] begins to talk about how the atmosphere
[22:45] in a family produces a particular
[22:47] product
[22:48] so family atmosphere family standards uh
[22:52] the
[22:52] the the discipline of mom and dad
[22:55] the things that mom and dad lift up it
[22:57] actually produces an
[22:58] imprint causes an imprint in the child
[23:00] and produces an image
[23:02] in the child he says family is what you
[23:03] are we're identified with our families
[23:05] our
[23:06] families identified by the union of our
[23:08] marriage so characteristics of the
[23:09] family
[23:10] influence the development of the person
[23:12] you become
[23:14] this is brother branham saying this
[23:15] family dynamics who you are in a family
[23:17] it's defined by relationships it's
[23:19] defined by influence and it's kind of
[23:21] making the person that you are would you
[23:23] agree
[23:26] now
[23:30] so that's the i've been through two
[23:33] parts this is a three-part sermon
[23:35] not counting the part two of the power
[23:39] prophecy of a powerful woman so it's
[23:41] three parts this is the third part
[23:44] now relationship if families divine by
[23:47] defined by relationships and we see that
[23:48] a man
[23:49] becomes a husband and he takes on a
[23:51] different role a different title steps
[23:52] into a different hood
[23:54] by virtue of marriage i want to
[23:57] kind of introduce this principle to you
[23:59] relationship requires responsibility
[24:04] so by virtue of relationship we have a
[24:06] duty to one another
[24:08] and there is there's a particular
[24:12] general duty of care that even society
[24:15] and law would impose upon somebody that
[24:18] we all have a general duty in
[24:19] relationship to one another
[24:21] as human beings that you would have a
[24:23] duty not to create a dangerous situation
[24:25] that could harm somebody that you would
[24:28] and this is a general duty we all have
[24:29] in our relationship to one another as
[24:30] human beings
[24:31] but then that that duty becomes greater
[24:34] by special relationship and so we could
[24:37] be walking home tonight from church and
[24:39] we could look over
[24:40] in and surprise lake and we could see
[24:42] you thinking man you'd walk to church
[24:44] that far well we're
[24:45] just telling the story and you see
[24:47] somebody drowning in surprise lake and
[24:49] you'd be like oh my goodness you know
[24:51] uh do i you know this is really awful
[24:53] this is horrible
[24:54] and if you didn't do anything to save
[24:56] them they'd say well there was they just
[24:57] had a general duty of care and absent
[24:59] any special relationship
[25:01] they shouldn't be obligated to wade into
[25:02] the water and try to save them
[25:04] now this may be a poor example even from
[25:06] a legal standpoint but have if the
[25:08] relationship changes
[25:09] the standard changes if somebody's kid
[25:13] is out there throwing rocks in the
[25:14] parking lot
[25:15] you might be able to say well that's
[25:16] going to hurt somebody or that's going
[25:17] to bust a window
[25:18] and you wouldn't have any liability but
[25:20] if someone's kid is your kid
[25:22] guess who may be on the hook for the
[25:24] medical bills or the damage to the
[25:25] vehicle
[25:26] because you have a duty by special
[25:27] relationship to the child
[25:29] to ensure that his conduct doesn't
[25:31] result in damages or harm to someone's
[25:33] property or somebody else
[25:34] and so relationship imposes a greater
[25:36] duty now that's just from a legal
[25:38] standpoint
[25:39] but think about this then even scripture
[25:41] or within our families by virtue of
[25:42] relationship
[25:43] it creates a duty one to another in
[25:46] first timothy chapter 5 verse 8 but if
[25:48] any provide not for his own
[25:50] especially for those of his own house he
[25:53] have denied the faith and is worse
[25:55] than an infidel now what is paul drawing
[25:58] on as he instructs timothy to come to
[26:00] the conclusion
[26:01] that a man who doesn't provide for his
[26:02] family is worse than an infidel
[26:04] how in the world does he come up with
[26:06] that standard why would he why would he
[26:08] make such bold claims if you provide not
[26:10] for his own especially those in his
[26:11] household
[26:12] those in his family he's denied the
[26:14] faith he's saying it because his
[26:16] relationship to his own
[26:17] and his relationship to his family or
[26:19] his household has established
[26:21] a duty of care to provide
[26:25] so it's the very relationship that the
[26:26] man was in that births the
[26:28] responsibility
[26:29] so paul is drawing from and it goes
[26:31] unstated that a man who has
[26:32] responsibility
[26:33] has a responsibility over his own
[26:35] especially over his family
[26:37] to provide for them and if he doesn't
[26:39] he's breached to duty and in breaching
[26:41] the duty he's saying he's denied the
[26:42] faith
[26:44] and this duty is so significant he says
[26:46] he's worse than an infidel he would be
[26:47] better off if he didn't even believe
[26:50] so paul is drawing on the fact that this
[26:52] man by virtue of relationship
[26:54] had a responsibility to provide
[26:58] in genesis chapter 2 verse 24 it says
[27:01] therefore shall a man
[27:02] leave his father and his mother and
[27:05] shall cleave unto his wife
[27:06] and they shall be one flesh this entire
[27:09] concept was not fattenable
[27:10] just by the image of man being on earth
[27:12] alone and then god creates the help
[27:14] means say oh well now man has a help
[27:16] meet they can rule and reign together
[27:18] but adam's prophetic utterance goes
[27:20] deeper it's not just a man and a woman
[27:22] but now
[27:23] he introduces the concept that a man's
[27:25] going to leave father
[27:26] and a man is going to leave mother
[27:28] because as long as that man is under
[27:30] father and mother he has a scriptural
[27:32] duty to honor them
[27:34] and is a scriptural duty to them but now
[27:36] it says he's going to
[27:37] leave his father and mother and cleave
[27:39] unto his wife and they shall be one
[27:41] flesh what happens
[27:42] responsibility changes as he enters into
[27:44] a new office
[27:46] it's important for a young man and even
[27:48] a young sister to recognize this
[27:50] when a man and a woman get married they
[27:51] begin to form their own
[27:53] family identity and it becomes a
[27:55] distinct identity separate from the one
[27:57] that the man had under his father and
[27:59] mother
[28:00] in one different than the girl had under
[28:02] her father and mother
[28:03] why because now that you become husband
[28:05] and wife the responsibility is to each
[28:07] other
[28:07] and your family and you no longer remain
[28:10] responsible in the same way you were
[28:12] when you were a child in the home
[28:15] it's not that you disrespect them
[28:16] anymore or you don't respect them
[28:18] anymore
[28:18] and that you show them disrespect but
[28:20] now your obligation
[28:22] changes because your relationship has
[28:23] changed
[28:25] are you able to follow just kind of
[28:27] these very simple things we're wanting
[28:28] to express
[28:29] that this is what's said to us in
[28:31] genesis 2 24
[28:32] that a man who is at one time under his
[28:35] father and mother
[28:36] is has to leave and by obligation cleave
[28:39] and be responsible to his wife
[28:41] and cannot shirk his responsibilities he
[28:44] has to his wife
[28:45] in the name of being responsible to his
[28:47] father and mother
[28:49] that there has to come a time when that
[28:50] division is made when that separation is
[28:52] made and someone gives themselves over
[28:54] to that family and to that wife
[28:56] and it may not just be father and mother
[28:57] it could be brother
[28:59] it could be bros right your buddies
[29:03] could be hobbies it could be recreation
[29:05] a man has to separate from those things
[29:07] of youth
[29:08] and and cleveland to his wife and now
[29:10] there's a different focus
[29:12] and this is what paul touches on in
[29:13] first corinthians chapter 7 verse 33
[29:16] but he that is married careth for the
[29:18] things that are of the world
[29:19] how he may please his wife
[29:23] and all the brothers said amen
[29:26] and now we feel like an excuse we have
[29:28] an excuse to concentrate on the things
[29:30] that are worldly
[29:32] but paul in this says they that have
[29:35] wives
[29:36] be as though you had none and you're
[29:39] thinking great
[29:40] this means i get to act like i'm single
[29:42] again
[29:43] no see we're just kind of boxing you in
[29:45] here
[29:46] he said hey the single person cares
[29:48] about the things of god how he may
[29:49] please the lord
[29:50] what because not being married they
[29:52] don't have the obligation to the wife so
[29:54] the single person
[29:55] the solitary is is focusing on christ
[29:58] and does the things that he may please
[30:00] the lord
[30:00] but he identifies how this shift of
[30:02] burden that when a man gets married and
[30:04] it even says it about the woman
[30:06] when she gets married now she cares
[30:07] about the things of the world how she
[30:09] may please her husband
[30:10] and the man cares about the things of
[30:11] the world how he may please his wife and
[30:13] paul recognizes this is a very strong
[30:15] influence and dynamic within marriages
[30:16] so he says look because
[30:18] time is short change your focus don't
[30:20] put family first put god first family
[30:22] second you third
[30:25] and he orders it differently then he
[30:26] says look we ought to not get so
[30:28] sidetracked that when a man gets married
[30:30] and he cares for the things of the world
[30:31] that he may please his wife at the sake
[30:33] of pleasing god
[30:34] no that's that's not what we must do but
[30:36] i'm using this scripture to point out
[30:38] that this is an
[30:38] obligation that a man takes on when he
[30:41] gets married
[30:42] it's an obligation a woman takes on when
[30:44] she gets married and these are the
[30:45] things that the scriptures are pointing
[30:47] out that relationship gives rise
[30:48] gives rise to responsibility again in
[30:51] the message of man running from the
[30:53] presence of the lord brother brown says
[30:54] we got so many things that we have to do
[30:56] so much responsibility that we have to
[30:59] face
[31:00] everybody has got to face a certain
[31:02] responsibility
[31:03] when you come to choose your wife to get
[31:05] married or choose your husband
[31:06] you've got to take a responsibility
[31:09] maybe you build a home it's a nice
[31:11] pretty home
[31:12] and then remember as a married woman you
[31:13] got to think about the responsibility of
[31:15] raising children
[31:16] and you got to think of them pretty
[31:17] slick walls are going to have little
[31:19] dirty hand prints all over them
[31:20] that's why you want to use the right
[31:22] kind of gloss or finish right
[31:24] wrong finish you can't wipe those dirty
[31:26] slimy little dirty hand prints off of
[31:28] them but he's saying
[31:29] this is the reality this is the reality
[31:32] of marriage this is the reality of
[31:33] raising children there's responsibility
[31:35] then you've got a responsibility of
[31:36] educating your children
[31:38] then you've got the responsibility of
[31:39] clothing and feeding everything is a
[31:42] responsibility
[31:43] now i know what some of you thinking
[31:44] everything is a chore but he's calling
[31:46] it a responsibility
[31:48] and it's so easy when the responsibility
[31:50] faces us to shirk from them
[31:53] and we find out that marriage is a
[31:54] responsibility in all manners
[31:56] brother brahm identifying that in
[31:58] natural life by virtue of the
[31:59] relationship a parent has to a child you
[32:01] have a responsibility to educate
[32:03] and to clothe and defeat you have
[32:05] responsibility to one another marriage
[32:07] is a responsibility what is its
[32:08] relationship
[32:10] because i'm in relationship to you
[32:12] there's mutual responsibilities that we
[32:14] have to one another
[32:15] so when you say a family is defined by
[32:17] relationships those relationships come
[32:19] with requirements
[32:20] responsibilities duties and things that
[32:23] we owe one another
[32:25] and that's what further defines what
[32:27] kind of family it is
[32:29] when brother branham identifies an awful
[32:31] family talks about wife going one way
[32:33] husband going another
[32:34] that's two people shirking their
[32:35] responsibilities and it creates
[32:37] an awful family but two people
[32:39] fulfilling their responsibility says
[32:41] creates the portrait of god a true
[32:43] family he says
[32:45] and that it's because of whether or not
[32:48] one is fulfilling their scriptural
[32:50] responsibility to one another
[32:52] so family is not just merely slapping a
[32:54] name on it and calling it a family
[32:57] not just merely entering into getting
[32:59] married well i guess i'm married i'm a
[33:01] husband now but it must carry with
[33:02] it it carries with it responsibility
[33:06] now in our in the text that we use
[33:10] in matthew chapter 5 verses 21 and 22
[33:12] excuse me ephesians chapter 5 rather
[33:14] verses 21 to 22.
[33:20] he says submitting yourselves one to
[33:22] another
[33:23] in the fear of god this is not spoken
[33:26] solely to the woman
[33:28] this is spoken to man and woman
[33:31] this is this is not paul says it to the
[33:33] woman and says oh well i better be very
[33:35] particular here and
[33:36] make her realize i'm talking to her
[33:38] she's out he's telling both man and
[33:39] woman
[33:40] boy girl all of us he said we submit
[33:42] ourselves one to another and more
[33:44] particularly
[33:45] as he begins to get into marital
[33:46] relationships he's telling the man to
[33:47] submit to the woman the woman to the man
[33:50] but then he says wives submit yourselves
[33:52] unto your own husbands as unto
[33:54] the lord so this image now that we
[33:56] create and a lot of us just immediately
[33:58] carnally begin to create this image
[33:59] of an authority figure and a woman in
[34:01] submission to the authority figure and
[34:03] that's kind of the idea we get
[34:04] the strong burly head and the woman
[34:06] under submission
[34:07] and we get the image of a gigantic thumb
[34:09] right
[34:12] and somebody under somebody's thumb and
[34:14] that submission well
[34:16] that may be by name but not in the
[34:17] reality that god is intending
[34:20] that may be submission in some
[34:21] relationships that may be submission
[34:23] that some want it to be and they turn
[34:25] marriage into an ultimate fighting
[34:27] bout trying to get the other to submit
[34:30] you're gonna tap out honey and that's
[34:32] kind of how how the relationship's
[34:34] working
[34:35] is the war of attrition are you going to
[34:37] give up i can argue all night long are
[34:38] you going to give up
[34:39] but that's not the submission that god
[34:41] that the prophet paul here is lifting up
[34:44] it's not submission that god is
[34:45] talking about submission carries with it
[34:48] the idea of cooperation
[34:50] submission here carries with the idea of
[34:53] agreement
[34:54] and the very words submit that you
[34:56] submitting yourselves one to another and
[34:58] the fact that it says one to another and
[34:59] then wives submit yourselves unto your
[35:01] own husbands
[35:02] it speaks of assuming a responsibility
[35:04] one to another
[35:05] so submission is not just cowering down
[35:08] and getting underneath something
[35:10] but submission is res assuming a
[35:11] responsibility to someone
[35:14] so when a wife submits herself to her
[35:16] husband she assumes a responsibility
[35:18] for and to her husband she has certain
[35:20] things that she must do for her husband
[35:22] she has a certain responsibility to her
[35:24] husband
[35:25] but it doesn't just work that one way
[35:27] the husband himself likewise
[35:29] even if it was just by virtue of the
[35:31] fact that his wife submitted to him
[35:33] he now has a mutual obligation to her
[35:36] because she has submitted herself to him
[35:38] there must be agreement there must be
[35:40] cooperation
[35:40] and then now he is responsible to her
[35:43] submission doesn't create one-way
[35:45] responsibility
[35:46] where the the the the the one that's
[35:48] submissive
[35:49] is now being dominated and they owe all
[35:51] the all the respect and all the care
[35:53] and everything and all the all the work
[35:56] goes one way to the one who's the head
[35:58] no it works both ways by virtue of the
[36:00] fact that there's one who's submitting
[36:02] and voluntarily yielding themselves to
[36:04] the other
[36:04] it creates a responsibility on the
[36:06] submitted part but also the one who's
[36:07] being submitted to
[36:08] now has a responsibility to the one
[36:10] who's yielded
[36:12] because now they have a duty to them by
[36:14] virtue of relationship a special
[36:16] relationship
[36:16] and they're even more responsible they
[36:19] would they're more responsible than they
[36:20] would have been without the submission
[36:22] right because now there's a greater care
[36:24] that's required
[36:27] the greek word submitting the who
[36:29] potasso is to place in a certain order
[36:32] or to arrange
[36:34] to mutually appoint or to agree upon
[36:37] so the submission is not one way
[36:38] accountability
[36:40] the submission isn't one way uh um uh
[36:43] dependency
[36:44] where there's where there's codependency
[36:47] and i'm absolutely convinced of this and
[36:48] you could just take this principle
[36:50] and identify it time and time again in
[36:51] all sorts of relationships whether it be
[36:53] in churches
[36:54] or or marriages or in business where
[36:56] there's a codependency there's abuse
[36:58] manipulation and control
[37:00] and fear and and one party being
[37:03] dissatisfied with the outcome
[37:06] but where there's mutual dependency
[37:07] there's cooperation
[37:09] there's a core there's harmony there's
[37:12] compromise in a good sense to achieve
[37:14] achieve a right result it's not it's my
[37:16] way or the highway if you don't like it
[37:17] there's the door
[37:18] there's there's a way of working
[37:19] together because the one party realizes
[37:21] well i'm dependent upon you and they say
[37:23] well i'm also dependent upon you so
[37:25] we're depending upon each other
[37:27] and that's exactly what paul is trying
[37:29] to lift up when it says submitting
[37:30] yourselves one to another
[37:31] he has not created a hierarchy where one
[37:34] is greater and better and stronger
[37:37] and more blessed than the other but he's
[37:38] arranging parts in relationship to each
[37:41] other and he says submit yourselves one
[37:43] to another that means husband must be
[37:44] submitting himself to his wife
[37:46] not that she would be the head to rule
[37:48] over him but in responsibility for her
[37:51] and the wife submitting herself to the
[37:53] husband so then you would ask
[37:55] if when paul sets it up that way and i'm
[37:58] i'm just using this this is an example
[38:00] of what relationships mean and how it
[38:01] gives rise to duty
[38:03] because otherwise if it's not creating
[38:05] that mutual dependency
[38:08] and it's not a two-way street wherein
[38:09] each party is complementing one another
[38:12] there's cooperation and agreement
[38:14] and it's an arrangement to place in a
[38:16] certain order so there's an order but
[38:17] there's a relationship one to another
[38:19] how do we submit to one another and how
[38:22] do we do as the scripture says
[38:23] submitting yourselves one to another how
[38:24] do we submit to each other
[38:26] if submission only means to be under
[38:28] somebody else
[38:30] ponder that how do we submit to each
[38:33] other
[38:34] if submitting means the other is under
[38:36] the other
[38:37] and i know maybe i'm using a language
[38:39] that begins to turn our whole concept
[38:40] upside down of what it means to be under
[38:42] headship
[38:44] but if if submitting only means the
[38:45] woman is under the man
[38:48] but the man has to submit also but that
[38:51] doesn't mean he has to get under the
[38:52] woman
[38:54] it suggests cooperation agreement
[38:57] harmony
[38:58] to their working together
[39:01] to be a church family and for us to
[39:04] operate as a church
[39:06] it's not a matter of being under the
[39:08] pastor
[39:09] and i know it's a language we often use
[39:11] and it's something you can study out and
[39:12] study very deeply in the message and
[39:14] even in the scripture
[39:16] and find that the phrase under someone's
[39:18] ministry or under this pastor can you
[39:20] sit under him and
[39:21] i'm under this ministry it's a phrase
[39:23] that we use and in our minds we're using
[39:25] a language that suggests there's some
[39:26] sort of
[39:27] hierarchy and that you have the pastor
[39:30] and everyone's underneath him as an uh
[39:32] you know look we're just kind of stuck
[39:34] underneath the man
[39:35] but really it's a language we use and
[39:37] the phrasing if you go back to scripture
[39:39] you go back to the message it's really
[39:40] to say
[39:40] we come to church to sit under someone's
[39:43] teaching or preaching
[39:44] that's why you're here you're sitting
[39:46] there while i'm standing
[39:49] listening to what i'm preaching so
[39:51] regardless of who's sitting here
[39:52] or who's standing here preaching you're
[39:54] sitting there under what they're
[39:55] preaching and you're listening to it
[39:58] and if you choose to come to a church
[39:59] and you come to church you sit under
[40:01] preaching
[40:01] and you yield to the order of the local
[40:03] church service
[40:05] those in authority the authorities of
[40:07] the local church so that you can we can
[40:09] have a church that governs and functions
[40:11] we don't all show up and someone say you
[40:13] know what i want to lead songs tonight
[40:15] and so everyone's up here fighting i got
[40:17] here first let me lead songs i want to
[40:19] lead songs get off the piano
[40:20] i don't want to have a piano tonight and
[40:22] everyone just kind of vises for who's
[40:24] playing who's leading songs what songs
[40:25] are sung but you come
[40:27] and you submit to the order of the local
[40:29] church
[40:30] and you sit under the preaching of the
[40:32] word but when you leave
[40:35] you retain your individual authority as
[40:38] a husband
[40:39] you retain your autonomy as a family
[40:41] when you leave the church service
[40:43] you don't leave thinking well i guess
[40:45] i'm under brother aaron
[40:46] i wonder what brother aaron would think
[40:47] about where we're going tonight for
[40:49] dinner
[40:51] i don't care if you don't go doritos am
[40:54] i on a roll now have i mentioned it now
[40:55] for four straight services
[40:57] you know it's getting bad when last
[40:58] night i was invited to go to dinner
[41:01] at ritos and i went
[41:04] with the family and it was good but
[41:07] think about that
[41:08] you come and you sit under teacher or a
[41:11] pastor or preacher
[41:13] and with with respect to your
[41:14] relationship in a local church
[41:16] if he's the highest order it creates
[41:18] arrangement and order
[41:20] and there's certain answerings too and
[41:22] certain decisions that are made
[41:23] and that relates to the local church but
[41:25] you retain your own headship of your
[41:27] family
[41:28] if you're if you're if you're going to
[41:30] church and we use the phrase you're
[41:32] sitting under someone's ministry
[41:33] you still remain personal responsibility
[41:36] for responsible for your wife and for
[41:37] your children
[41:39] you you retain your autonomy and your
[41:41] individuality as a son and daughter of
[41:43] god and the decisions you make
[41:44] outside of the context of a church
[41:46] service to where there's never this card
[41:47] that a preacher can pull and say well
[41:49] you're not under my ministry clearly
[41:51] you're not under my ministry
[41:53] because of what well i mean if you tried
[41:55] to bully the guy out of the pulpit
[41:56] during service say hey tonight's my
[41:58] night you know i want to preach
[41:59] you say hey you're clearly not
[42:00] submitting to the rules of order in this
[42:02] church
[42:03] and and then we've asked someone to
[42:04] speak and you're wanting to take their
[42:06] place and you're interrupting the
[42:07] service
[42:07] that's the time you say you're clearly
[42:08] not under uh the authority of the local
[42:11] church to listen to what the
[42:12] local church is doing but there's
[42:14] certain things and certain functions
[42:15] that you retain
[42:16] as a husband that you retain as an
[42:18] individual family unit and as a man and
[42:20] a person of god
[42:23] certain responsibilities that a church
[42:25] has to keep the local church clean
[42:30] and there's certain things that function
[42:31] within the local church
[42:34] that go beyond the scope of what i'm
[42:35] what we're dealing with tonight
[42:37] but i believe that sometimes submission
[42:39] has been perverted into something that's
[42:41] not scriptural not even not even close
[42:43] to being christ-like
[42:45] and it creates the wrong picture of
[42:46] leadership it creates the wrong picture
[42:48] of relationships
[42:49] and it's it it creates weakness
[42:52] or a vulnerability that the devil
[42:54] exploits
[42:56] and i believe god's wanting to wash his
[42:58] bride
[42:59] of the wrong concept of headship and a
[43:02] washer of the wrong concepts of
[43:03] leadership
[43:05] and i believe with all my heart this
[43:07] message calls out the bully with the
[43:08] three-pointed stick
[43:10] and says you've you stopped beating her
[43:13] you stop mistreating her
[43:18] and so submitting yourselves one to
[43:20] another
[43:22] so in a family then god has arranged us
[43:25] together
[43:27] with responsibility among the members
[43:30] and these are scriptural obligations
[43:31] that we owe
[43:32] one another and i think you could even
[43:35] look at it in the terms of maybe legally
[43:36] like a contract
[43:38] and that's what marriage is it's a
[43:40] covenant
[43:41] that's what parents have to their
[43:43] children they have a covenant they have
[43:45] a contract it's an agreement
[43:47] it's god's divine order order not just
[43:49] in the sense of arranging things but
[43:50] order in the sense of a command or
[43:52] something that should be obeyed
[43:53] god places us in a family and then god
[43:55] arranges a family a particular way
[43:57] and in that arrangement there's
[43:58] responsibilities among the members some
[44:00] members have responsibilities that
[44:01] others don't
[44:03] could you imagine if i went home tonight
[44:05] and i said well elliot did you pay the
[44:07] rent
[44:08] and he'd be like pay the rent how many
[44:10] baseball cards is that
[44:13] but he doesn't have that responsibility
[44:15] he shouldn't have that responsibility at
[44:17] least not yet
[44:19] and so the virtue of the office and and
[44:22] the relationship it dictates what
[44:23] responsibilities you have and their
[44:25] scriptural roles and scriptural
[44:26] responsibilities that were owed under a
[44:28] contract
[44:29] to one another and it's so even within
[44:32] the local church within the the unity of
[44:34] the local body
[44:36] and i want to end with this thought as
[44:38] the closing part of
[44:39] part three of par three parts it's
[44:42] through those relationships and the
[44:44] fulfillment of our duties one to another
[44:45] that the attributes of god are
[44:47] manifested
[44:49] that that's how we begin to understand
[44:50] god and that's why we as humans
[44:52] we use the relationship of father the
[44:54] son and husband to wife
[44:55] to begin to understand god and his love
[44:57] for us because it's in those
[44:59] relationships that god was the original
[45:00] parent
[45:01] that god is a husband and there's a
[45:03] certain relationship he wants to have
[45:04] with his creation
[45:05] and we be we're the part that unfolded
[45:07] first and so it's actually in the office
[45:10] of husband in the office of wife
[45:12] in the office of father in the office of
[45:13] mother in the office of child that if we
[45:16] meet our scriptural responsibilities
[45:18] god is actually being expressed and we
[45:21] paint a picture
[45:22] of the divine god's attributes are
[45:26] manifested through our relationships
[45:29] and it's a wonderful opportunity
[45:33] and it actually gives context i say
[45:35] rather i'd like to say that
[45:36] it gives context to our character when
[45:39] you see one
[45:40] acting a certain way and you see them do
[45:42] certain things you might think
[45:44] well that doesn't seem that really seems
[45:46] odd why would they do that
[45:47] and then you realize they have a
[45:48] responsibility over something
[45:51] and you realize that's why they made
[45:53] that decision
[45:54] why didn't he just stick it out why
[45:56] didn't he just do that so why did he do
[45:57] that oh i didn't realize he was
[45:58] responsible i didn't realize he was
[46:00] facing that decision
[46:01] i didn't know those were the
[46:02] circumstances so it our actions
[46:05] and even our what we lift up and what we
[46:07] promote it gives context to our
[46:09] character
[46:10] it gives context to our behavior you say
[46:13] somebody running out and doing something
[46:14] you might think oh that's that's
[46:15] harmless that's great did they enjoy it
[46:17] i said yeah they had a blast but they
[46:19] left their wife and children at home for
[46:21] a month while they did it
[46:22] like oh wow why'd they do that for it
[46:24] gives a different context to
[46:26] to callings and uh to conduct and
[46:28] behavior
[46:31] and so i want you to think of that the
[46:32] contract the covenant
[46:35] as we read this last statement brother
[46:36] brown in the message one it says now the
[46:38] first man
[46:39] and the first woman in the garden of
[46:40] eden were in perfect harmony with god
[46:44] so much that god could come down at any
[46:46] time he desired and talked lip to ear
[46:48] with adam and eve now that is perfect
[46:52] oneness
[46:53] god in his creation god speaking lip to
[46:55] ear with adam
[46:56] and eve don't you want to kind of create
[46:58] the kind of atmosphere
[46:59] in your life that god's welcome in his
[47:02] presence says welcome in
[47:03] he says and they were so perfect in
[47:05] harmony with god till they were one with
[47:08] god
[47:08] so he talked about man and woman
[47:10] perfectly together in
[47:11] harmony with god it creates an
[47:13] environment conducive to the presence of
[47:14] god
[47:15] god and his family were one any man in
[47:18] his family a correct good noble obedient
[47:20] family
[47:21] is one with another any family so the
[47:23] unity of the family some
[47:24] family relationships a good correct
[47:27] noble obedient family is one
[47:29] if there's something in the family that
[47:30] moves them apart then it's not right
[47:32] that family's broken somewhere
[47:33] that's disharmony disunity there's a
[47:36] broken
[47:36] the agreement now you can have one
[47:39] member submitting in that
[47:40] that uh unnatural sense and they're
[47:43] clearly under submission
[47:44] but if there's not cooperation if
[47:46] there's not harmony if they're not on
[47:48] the same page but it's like that makes
[47:49] an awful family
[47:51] so he said there's something they're
[47:52] broke somewhere they should all be one
[47:54] father with mother mother with father
[47:56] children with parent parent with child
[47:58] all in agreement integrity
[48:01] we're operating according to the same
[48:02] covenant we're meeting our
[48:03] responsibilities under the covenant
[48:04] we're all in agreement we're all in
[48:06] harmony there's no breach of contract
[48:07] there's no
[48:08] anticipatory breach there's no one's
[48:09] threatening to sue one another you keep
[48:11] doing that and i'm going to sue you no
[48:12] we're all in agreement we're all in
[48:13] harmony
[48:14] it says when you see that you'll see one
[48:16] lovely picture
[48:17] it says that's god's purpose
[48:21] what's his purpose that our families
[48:22] would be that way
[48:24] to paint a lovely picture why was it one
[48:26] man and one woman in the beginning that
[48:28] he might have a godly seed
[48:30] and that's god's purpose and his purpose
[48:33] as father supreme
[48:34] was to be one with his family his
[48:35] earthly family adam
[48:37] and eve the statement we've been reading
[48:40] from in the masterpiece but in agreement
[48:42] with love one to another
[48:43] that's a family
[48:47] so families defined by relationships
[48:50] these relationships we have one to
[48:51] another
[48:51] it's the relationship that gives rise to
[48:53] the name husband
[48:55] it's a relationship that gives rise to
[48:57] the name mother it's a relationship that
[48:59] gives rise to the
[49:00] the name child and then you can find
[49:02] yourself
[49:03] by those names in the word right
[49:07] you mean identify yourself write in the
[49:08] bible by what not because i'm looking
[49:10] for aaron david
[49:12] but i'm looking for what does god
[49:13] require of a man
[49:15] what does god require of a woman brother
[49:17] aaron was testifying he's reading the
[49:18] book of proverbs he's like my goodness
[49:20] this is so on point this is
[49:21] those are my words this is directly
[49:23] where i'm living right now why because
[49:24] it speaks to a young man
[49:26] because to tell them what to look for
[49:28] what to watch for and the bible is
[49:29] instructive to men
[49:30] it's instructed to young women it's
[49:33] instructed to the aged women it's
[49:34] instructed to
[49:35] to husbands and wives and we can find
[49:37] this bible in this message by virtue of
[49:39] the names
[49:40] it addresses the roles and
[49:41] responsibilities it means something to
[49:43] me every
[49:44] day of my life because the relationships
[49:47] i have
[49:50] in agreement he says fulfilling in other
[49:53] words fulfilling our
[49:54] responsibilities as dictated by
[49:56] scripture according to our position in
[49:58] the family
[50:00] and so we'll invite the musicians to
[50:02] come i want to end with this statement
[50:05] now i'll say that i agree with it but
[50:08] before you get all excited and start
[50:09] flipping over chairs and run the aisles
[50:14] i want to preface that i have a
[50:15] follow-up to it
[50:17] but we've heard this statement before
[50:18] character is what you are when you are
[50:20] by yourself
[50:22] and there's there's a tremendous truth
[50:24] to that
[50:26] identifying how that you can act one way
[50:28] around people and you could do something
[50:30] or you could kind of
[50:31] hold your tongue or keep from doing
[50:32] certain things when you're around others
[50:34] but when you're all by yourself what is
[50:36] it you conspire to do what is it you're
[50:37] thinking about what is it you're doing
[50:39] and it tells us
[50:41] it speaks to the principle that when
[50:43] you're all alone
[50:44] and you're at liberty to do whatever you
[50:46] want that that's going to really reveal
[50:48] someone's character right
[50:50] that's kind of the idea to it so i'm not
[50:52] taking exception to that statement
[50:54] but let me just say this if character is
[50:56] what you are when you're by yourself
[50:58] there's nothing like relationships to
[50:59] bring that real character out
[51:03] nothing like relationships to finally
[51:05] figure out whoa
[51:06] i didn't know you had that in you and
[51:09] what brings it out
[51:10] relationships conflict in relationships
[51:14] responsibilities that one has in a
[51:15] relationship you think immediately you
[51:16] begin to think negatively like wow i
[51:18] didn't know you could get mad like that
[51:19] i didn't know you could be jealous like
[51:20] that i didn't know you could punch like
[51:22] that
[51:22] and it's all in the context of some kind
[51:24] of rivalry or some kind of
[51:26] uh a fight between two people in
[51:28] relationship
[51:29] but sometimes you're impressed like wow
[51:31] where'd that come from
[51:33] because someone steps into a position or
[51:35] an office and they start acting out in
[51:37] ways you never realized before man i
[51:38] didn't realize they had that gift
[51:40] i didn't realize they had that had that
[51:42] um ability
[51:43] like you take brother michael for
[51:45] instance volunteers to lead songs
[51:48] because
[51:49] he's either had enough with me and
[51:50] brother tom or he feels a burden and
[51:52] he's like hey maybe there's a way that i
[51:54] can help and i see someone stepping into
[51:56] an office and begin to lead songs like
[51:57] wow
[51:59] this this had to always been there a
[52:01] sensitivity to the spirit a willingness
[52:03] to
[52:04] to lead the worship and humility in the
[52:05] way that it's done that's a gift
[52:07] operating and what created that a
[52:10] relationship to the congregation
[52:12] responsibility to god to do something
[52:14] that was pleasing to him and bring the
[52:15] right kind of
[52:15] atmosphere so it's not always negative
[52:18] then i get in a relationship i'm going
[52:19] to know i'm jealous and i'm impatient
[52:21] and i raise my voice
[52:22] no it'll bring out the best in you too
[52:25] and that's what god desires to do by
[52:27] virtue of relationships
[52:29] not place us in relationship to one
[52:30] another where we repeatedly fail
[52:32] i made a mistake in that relationship i
[52:34] made a mistake in that relationship
[52:36] and it brought out the worst of me here
[52:37] and the worst of me there listen you're
[52:39] still here today doing this
[52:42] breathing why because god's not finished
[52:44] with you yet
[52:46] because god's putting you in
[52:47] relationship
[52:49] so that you can he can bring out the
[52:51] gold that's in you
[52:52] and you look back and you're like man i
[52:54] failed here and i failed there and i
[52:55] didn't do this right and i didn't do
[52:56] that right and i could fret over me as a
[52:58] father and say man
[52:59] through the first 12 years of being a
[53:00] father i didn't do this right i didn't
[53:02] do that right but you know what i'm
[53:03] still a daddy
[53:05] i'm still a papa to jack and i'm still
[53:09] i'm still
[53:09] one that has an opportunity by virtue of
[53:12] that relationship
[53:13] not to keep making the same mistakes
[53:16] to bring out the real father in me to
[53:19] bring up the patience and the grace that
[53:21] a father ought to have i still
[53:22] have a marriage by the grace of god and
[53:24] that it gives me the opportunity to not
[53:26] remain
[53:27] obstinate to not remain harsh to not
[53:29] make the same mistakes that can be made
[53:30] in a marriage
[53:31] the opportunity is still there to bring
[53:33] out the real husband in me
[53:35] well and what gives me the opportunity
[53:36] relationship
[53:38] he said well brother and i don't have
[53:39] that i don't have that but you're still
[53:41] placed in
[53:42] family you're still in the house of god
[53:44] you're still placing a relationship as a
[53:45] brother
[53:46] as a friend and even as a dad or a
[53:48] grandparent all for what the opportunity
[53:51] that the real you could come out
[53:54] and it being the real you it's christ
[53:57] that's expressed
[53:59] and so we could perhaps cower a little
[54:02] bit when we think there's nothing like a
[54:04] relationship to bring out the real you
[54:07] there's nothing like a relationship to
[54:09] bring out the real you
[54:12] and i thank god for relationships i
[54:14] thank god for the relationship he gives
[54:16] us within church
[54:18] because it brings things out of us not
[54:20] always the bad
[54:21] but ultimately the good i'm glad he's
[54:24] placed us within families in this
[54:26] natural life to do what to bring out the
[54:27] best in us
[54:29] not to constantly highlight our worst uh
[54:32] instincts and
[54:32] and our worst uh attributes but he
[54:36] awakens
[54:36] us to him why do i keep doing that why
[54:39] because there's a better you on the
[54:40] inside
[54:42] and he's going to bring it out of you
[54:44] and i think that's the promise that we
[54:46] can yield to
[54:47] thank god for relationships
[54:51] i'm glad i'm not solitary i'm glad he's
[54:54] placed me in a family
[54:56] a church family where i'm responsible to
[54:59] you
[55:00] and i is the one who's standing up here
[55:02] now i voluntarily and willingly
[55:05] make myself accountable to you
[55:08] i'm accountable to you i do that
[55:11] and i thank god for that because what
[55:13] it'll bring out of me in the end
[55:15] is a christ-like characteristic why
[55:18] because you'll hold me accountable
[55:19] you'll say
[55:20] brother aaron that wasn't really christ
[55:22] like
[55:23] oh you're right that wasn't
[55:26] it's saying so if you don't agree with
[55:28] it right you hold yourself accountable
[55:32] so i thank god for relationships thank
[55:34] god he's placed us in a church family
[55:36] i thank god that he's given his family
[55:37] his husbands and wives his uncles and
[55:39] aunts his grandparents
[55:42] that we can express the attributes of
[55:43] christ i trust this extends of grace to
[55:46] you tonight
[55:47] and it is a strength to you let's stand
[55:48] to our feet
[55:51] [Music]
[56:00] let's bow our heads
[56:02] [Music]
[56:08] let's express our love to him tonight
[56:12] say lord it's the relationship i have
[56:14] with you as a daughter
[56:16] that i come to you and it's the
[56:17] relationship i have with you tonight as
[56:19] a son that i
[56:21] approach your throne and i'm mindful
[56:23] lord that you said
[56:24] in your word that if a natural father
[56:27] would give his son
[56:29] the things the necessary things that he
[56:31] asked for then how much more does our
[56:33] heavenly father give us the spiritual
[56:35] things that we need
[56:37] so i have the boldness tonight to
[56:38] inquire of god said
[56:40] lord what is it that you desire to see
[56:43] in me
[56:44] lord what is it that i must yield to
[56:48] more well and there then also lord help
[56:50] me
[56:51] help me in my in my calling as male
[56:54] female man woman
[56:56] husband wife father mother child son
[56:59] daughter grandmother grandfather you
[57:02] name it
[57:03] we all can come under this obligation
[57:06] together
[57:08] let's just express our love to him our
[57:09] gracious heavenly father tonight
[57:11] as we close this service and as we have
[57:12] been blessed in your presence
[57:15] lord we start with the very beginning
[57:18] yes lord i realize that i
[57:20] ventured as a preacher into areas of
[57:23] politics and
[57:24] statements that your prophet made in
[57:26] relationship to a powerful woman and
[57:28] vice presidents and presidents
[57:30] even the very image of a woman wearing
[57:32] royal
[57:33] purple like colors
[57:34] [Music]
[57:36] lord we see a striking image reflected
[57:39] today as vice
[57:40] president harris was inaugurated sworn
[57:42] into office
[57:45] and lord we could only go back to what
[57:47] we see already in your word that your
[57:49] prophet identified according to that
[57:51] prophecy that there would be a rise
[57:53] of a union in ecumenical realms
[57:57] realms lord that there'd be a union of
[58:00] in denominational realms and there'd be
[58:02] a union of the mother and her daughters
[58:04] and this would be a
[58:05] spiritual union and it'd be a force that
[58:07] would strike out against the word
[58:09] wrote in the church age book that once
[58:10] we see these this catholic president no
[58:12] doubt there be another one he says
[58:14] there's nothing left
[58:18] but a shaking lord and lord we realize
[58:22] that once more
[58:23] this world was shook when those seals
[58:26] were being opened
[58:28] fathers we sit under the anointing of
[58:30] the word of god and the open of the word
[58:31] of god in this hour
[58:32] it's there that we place our focus it's
[58:34] there that we place our trust
[58:36] and father if you could give liberty and
[58:39] our spirits to catch a revelation of a
[58:41] modern event
[58:42] by what your prophet has prophesied
[58:44] father we yield to we would accept it in
[58:45] your name
[58:47] but father we want to be very careful if
[58:48] we do not have the liberty to say this
[58:50] day
[58:51] this is fulfilled that we would just
[58:52] wait for you
[58:54] to bring that kind of unction and that
[58:55] kind of clarity
[58:57] but no doubt father we are excited we
[58:59] are thrilled to see
[59:00] symbols and images that perhaps our
[59:03] prophet saul
[59:04] come up before the people all around the
[59:06] world today
[59:07] and we have a special connection to a
[59:09] voice and to a message
[59:11] that spoke things beforehand and placed
[59:13] them in modern events
[59:14] beforehand and showed us what satan was
[59:16] doing beforehand
[59:17] and now to for what else would i ask men
[59:19] to do tonight
[59:21] except to go home and love their wives
[59:23] as christ loves the church
[59:26] what else could i ask children to do
[59:27] today except to go home and be obedient
[59:29] to their parents
[59:31] what else could we ask of the sisters
[59:33] except to reverence their husbands
[59:35] what could we ask of one another except
[59:36] to pay our tithes and give our offerings
[59:39] and
[59:39] baptize in the name of jesus christ and
[59:41] and to
[59:42] take communion and feet washing and do
[59:44] the ordinances of the church lord what
[59:46] else could we do except what the word
[59:48] has
[59:48] asked us to do and how else are you
[59:51] going to be expressed
[59:54] unless we have lives lived by the word
[59:56] [Music]
[59:57] and lord i can't fulfill my wife's part
[1:00:00] i have to fulfill my part and lord i
[1:00:03] know if i do my part i can make her part
[1:00:05] easier
[1:00:07] and what i pray that that be the unction
[1:00:09] and the inspiration that comes within
[1:00:11] our hearts today
[1:00:12] is may each one of us from myself uh to
[1:00:14] brother micah
[1:00:15] brother loyal and brother john lord in
[1:00:17] each one and
[1:00:18] that would be here from the this front
[1:00:20] of the room or the mission brother aaron
[1:00:22] all the way to the back lord
[1:00:23] may we realize that we consecrate
[1:00:25] ourselves as individuals to you tonight
[1:00:27] to do our part
[1:00:30] that it may work to the efficient
[1:00:32] operation of our families to the body of
[1:00:34] christ
[1:00:34] not taking ourselves even out of the
[1:00:36] context that we're operating on a global
[1:00:38] scale tonight
[1:00:39] as one ransom body of christ oh lord let
[1:00:42] us do our part and i don't want it to be
[1:00:46] in some kind of fantastic some kind of
[1:00:48] pie in the sky great things with
[1:00:50] headlights and the whole world notices
[1:00:52] the lord in the quietness of my home and
[1:00:54] my relationship to my family may i
[1:00:55] fulfill my responsibility and endure
