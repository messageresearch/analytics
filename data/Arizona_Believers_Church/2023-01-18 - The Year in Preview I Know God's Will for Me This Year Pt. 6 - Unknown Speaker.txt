TRANSCRIPT
========================================
excited to get to that juncture tonight so hopefully we'll just be able to move quickly in this our title is just a little bit different tonight it's still the year in preview it is part six I believe on this subject but just a little bit of a Twist as we wrap up this series in the next few parts it's I know God's will for me this year we're not asking so much what is God's will for me this year we're saying I know God's will for me this year because we're kind of focusing on things that we've kind of already laid in there and established and set real firm on on Sundays talking about attending church and you're giving and uh supporting missions and we'll pick back up on that on Sunday morning but tonight we want to continue to emphasize the preview because this is how I'm wanting to express it that God has already laid the path out for us maybe a lot of particulars that we fill in in our individual lives but there's some common ground that we're all going to share this is something I could say is God's will for us for all of us who are here tonight regardless of your callings male or female young or old these are things I could say are God's will for us that his word has given us a path to follow a plan established our steps and told us where we can place our feet and on Wednesday nights we're touching on these three things to sanctify your home gather around the word and live for others very simple and we're looking at now not as a question but God's will for me this year is that I continue to or establish a level of sanctification within my dwelling and where I live to gather around the word I would even say even as an individual this is something that you can be doing and then live for others in the sanctify the home I think the phrase apply the token is appropriate to use for that but it's about creating a safe distance from the world or a safe Haven from the negative influences of the world or just some means a fuse so to speak that triggers when there's too much excess it goes too far there's a there's something in that home that can just immediately begin to step in and sanctify and wash and keep us from uh that lack of moderation that the world can begin to spin up and negatively impact us and then in gathering around the word we were looking at how that we want to give have a specific time where we set aside time to give the Lord attention in our lives and in our home life and we're kind of phrasing it even and putting God first and you could do this through praying and reading your Bible there's certain things you can do to put God first and I wanted to kind of tie into this service from last week but maybe just bring this in just as one point of emphasis before we move on to live for others is from the sermon Fellowship and this was a longer quote last Wednesday but I'm just reading the last portion he says I went into Mineo home and the children are are all gathered round for family prayer always he says God bless that family talked about how his daughters love to do that gather around them and they sit there wide-eyed and their eyes twinkling and love to pray and love to read the Bible love to be a part of it when we've had the discipline in our home and we begin to establish this as a young family it was actually it was something that our children just were enthusiastic about and they said can we do character and that's what we had called it for the first year or two it was just something they looked forward to and there's a lot of different ways we tried to engage them and enjoy it at that age that they were at the time but he says God bless that family this is the phrase I really want you to zero in on remember that's the tie that binds so this putting God first or this the sanctification of the home and then even the momentum of that to gathering around the word that's what's going to bind you together as a family that's what's going to give you some common ground and things to Fellowship on and the right kind of bonds that's going to pay off dividends there's going to be a time in your children's lives where maybe that you know maybe you have some camaraderie around natural things and that's wonderful in a relationship there's going to come a time when you want to be able to go to and talk to you more than just Sports and they're going to want to ask hard questions and they're going to open up to you and say hey I'm going through a difficult time or I've made a mistake and would you pray for me you need to have that kind of discipline where they know they can trust you in spiritual things he said that's the tithe that binds and he says if you did that in your home there wouldn't be so many divorce cases and he says and things going on the way there is so maybe that's a phrase that we should relate to a little bit more just the way things are and that that lack of continuity the lack of Harmony even the harmony between spouses gathering around the word is something that brings us closer together prayer softens your spirit it's just something that it does it'll soften your spirit reading the word induce you with wisdom so there's a way that even husband and wife would be joined closer together and not always maybe in uh come in competitive modes uh when you're around gathering around the word of God it says and things going on the way there is you have fellowship with each other and so I want to emphasize that that this gathering around the word is a it's a cement to relationships if there's a stickiness to it that draws us closer together and it's a tithe that binds and it's the strongest bind binder that we can have as a family now let's take a step further if you would like to even just turn in your Bibles to Second Corinthians will be coming to the scripture here in a moment but now on live for others and I want to phrase this at the outset and if you want to jot this down you certainly can but it is an often forgotten or at a minimum overlooked form of family entertainment are you thinking are you pondering that phrase at all a forgotten form of family entertainment living for others when I say live for others I want to at the outset tell you that this is real family entertainment to live for others and to live for others I'm wanting to maybe point to very specific Acts or even acts in general acts of service or thoughtfulness to others that that are edifying that are helpful there may be a lot of different ways that you as a family live for others there might be ways that you have specifically shown kindness to certain people or certain situations many of you have done that for Elizabeth and I get just how different ways you reach out and try to show acts of kindness or service or offer to do different things and those are all ways that we live for others in in thinking about this thought something that stood out to Elizabeth and I as a young couple and many of you know brother Robert and sister Jill McGary spelled differently maybe we could say they spell it right but it's brother Robert McGary they just seem to have a discipline in their family so sister Elizabeth I were impacted by this many years ago how they just kind of reached out and they did acts of service and they showed kindness and we recognize it as them Thinking Beyond themselves and living for others and it really spoke to us as a young family that we we appreciated this testimony that they had where they served beyond their own family and they live for other families and they found ways uh to to show kindness or to be friendly and reach out and so there may be people in your lives that you could even think of that seem to be uh selfless and they're always giving and they're always showing kindness and and I would want you to think about those things and we talk about living for others because that's what is being specifically referred to is this service to those Beyond yourself and living for others and I would even say this that it's it arrives at it's number three or number six however you're wanting to count this because I would say that this is the product of a Sanctified home that's gathering around the word that this is something you don't necessarily start with this because if you start with this and you're you're wanting to use this as a means to achieve uh you know some progress there's just a way to wear self and pride you're doing something that is service but there's a lot of selfishness in it there's a lot of pretense mixed up in it there's a lot of look at me what I'm doing wrapped up in it and there's not enough you know we're doing this whether anybody knows or not um one time we came home from a trip and we came home and our house was clean we had no idea who did it we had some suspicions and I'm thinking oh no somebody saw our house the way it was when we left but they just cleaned our house while we were gone and they didn't care to have any attention should I call their name out anybody want to know they didn't care for the attention they just wanted to do something nice and we appreciate it there's things that um if you I feel really feel that if we get it in the right order it's done in the right way for the right reasons and so sanctifying your heart and your life and your home and gathering around the word I think the order is important to um focus and I may be spending more time on this thought completely backed away from it I may just get into it in the month of February how do you like that for planning I already know what I'm going to preach in February possibly is on charity begins at home and there's certain things that we have to first have established at home before we can desire to be effective outside the home and so these are things that you gather around the word and you're saying to find your home it puts you in a wonderful position and the order is good to give you that momentum to then begin to think outside your home because a lot of people will serve others as a way of not attending to the problems they have in their own personal life right I mean this is there's just a lot of Liberty here to maybe go down this path that that just becomes an outlet or channel for an energy that they ought to be focusing back into their marriage back into their children back into their own personal lives and they can do everything for everybody else but they just have this barrier and this Liberty and freedom to really face the facts at home and do the things they ought to at home so by no means do I want to get it out of order I think these first two are important that the order is important that this is the the product of sanctifying your home and gathering around the word it just creates in you this spark to begin to think about other people's needs and now this scripture I want to use is the head of this thought because it it's used to speak of how that we ought to live for Christ but then that creates this domino effect of then being christ-like in second Corinthians 5 15 and he that died and that he died for all that they which lived so he died for all but only those that live by that death they that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves you don't live selfishly you're not living for your own means or your own desires but you live unto him but unto him which died for them and rose again that's just such a beautiful statement he that died for all died so that they that live would not just live for themselves but they'd live for him that died for all and died for them that live and rose again and it is in this uh phrase they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves but live unto him it brings you out of this uh this idea of being selfish and it it gets you thinking about not just living for yourself but living for Christ but I'm talking about living for others so I'll build the living for others uh living for Christ and how that becomes living for others but this living for others it over it's a way of overthrowing pride and it just takes kind of your pride and your selfish ambition or he just stifles that selfishness that we can have and I think that you know showing paying attention to the needs of others is a tremendous habit that you can build for yourself personally but it's a tremendous Habit to establish within a family Dynamic and it's a wonderful lesson that we can be teaching these young men and these young ladies on these first few rows that they begin to think Beyond themselves and think of ways that they can help others and it's this is what it means to not live unto yourself brother Bannerman the sermon faith and the Son of God he says so each day I want to live not for myself if I live for myself I have a selfish life I want to live for others and give what strength I have not to myself and to my own pleasure but for the benefit of others that'll build the kingdom of God think of how that phrasing is so beautiful I don't want to live for myself that's a selfish life I want to live for others and give what strength I have not to myself for my own pleasure but to the benefit of others that will build the kingdom of God and I believe even in the way that he phrases it that even if you're doing service to someone who's not part of the Kingdom or what may never be part of the Kingdom you're still building the kingdom if I live in a kind of life that's not selfish and even as we've been reading it on Sunday in Hebrews chapter 10 about uh let's assemble ourselves together and all the more as we see that day approaching we recognize in verse 24 it says let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to Good Works and so this if I could say this church is a type of the family family is not a type of the church church is type of the family and so Church actually uh patterns itself and it's typed after family Dynamics remember that in the beginning God didn't establish a church he created a family so that's the that's the image that God is in and the church is a mirror of that and Paul doesn't it doesn't describe uh the church um the marriage like the church but he's describing the church like a marriage and like the relationship between husband and wife and so the church being a type of a family if the church is called to assemble themselves around the word for the purpose of encouraging one another and provoking one another to love and good works the Fab the family gathers around the word in order to Foster love and Inspire acts of Love behind it that we are then as a family if this is what the church does as they gather around the word in order to provoke acts of service and that's what we ought to be doing as a family Paul says in first Thessalonians 5 11 wherefore Comfort yourselves together so if we are going to gather together as a church as a means of exhorting one another then this is something we do as a family we Comfort ourselves together and edify one another even as also ye do so we do this within the family we encourage one another but then by the from the source of that encouragement that we gather as a family unit then we want to have kind of an overflow and a strength as a family unit that can then serve other people that's the beautiful thing of building your family on the right foundation and feeding your experience and keeping keeping your hearts and Minds right and freeing yourself from a lot of things of the world that can bind our Spirits down and trap us or if I could say this there's many things that the devil can push us to do that make us feel alienated from The Fellowship of Christian brethren and it's not the ACT it's not the thing you've done that the devil's trying to accomplish it's the alienation from Christ and the Christian Fellowship like that's the goal so there's a victory that you can have that whenever you've made a mistake you've been out of church for a while you've done something it makes you feel less deserving of Fellowship it makes you not feel a part make that diligent effort to re-engage and reconnect and find yourself in fellowship and get around the right things even I encourage the young people uh if sin is dragging you down and thoughts are weighing heavy on your heart don't get distant from your parents fight to get back into fellowship with them spend time together with the family don't let it alienate you from fellowship young people get out of that practice and they feel backslid and there's you know get around the right kind of fellowship and that's the victory and the devil has no victory in causing you to make a mistake his Victors to try to get you out from among the flock away from the comfort away from the edification away from the encouragement so if you just say I know I made a mistake God forgive me and you make that effort to reconnect with the things of God there's the Victory and the devil's like ah I thought I had him and he can't even Point scoreboard because whatever that was God's used amen right for your benefit for his glory and so this these disciplines that we have as a family I know there's maybe a lot of layers that we're building down but when a family can have this and let me reconnect it then if we can be in this habit as a family of encouraging one another then it's going to be so much easier to reach Beyond yourself and comfort and edify and help somebody else and strengthen somebody else so if I could for them which live feeding it from second Corinthians 5 15 living unto him which died for them which live it necessitates because it says we ought to live for him which died for us it necessitates a life of service to others not just the life well I'm just trying to serve Christ and I'm just trying to serve Christ but there's no self-sacrifice there's no unselfishness there's no service to others there's no reaching out Beyond yourself I would even say that we cannot be a Christian church and always just internalizing focusing on our own and only worried about who's here and only worried about what takes between these four walls we ought to have a mind to what takes place in our community within our neighborhoods and with our extended families and and the body of Christ around the world that's what makes us a genuine Christian Church not when we become cultish all right there's some message churches that have closed the doors anyone that doesn't believe the same way they do and they're only after satellite churches to build a following after their leader or their you know their their cult leader their eighth messenger and they don't have a burden for lost souls some even teach them that the door of Salvation was shut in 1963 and so they don't have a heart to for the for the lost and the burden to evangelize and a burden to see Soul saved and we ought not to be that kind of church we ought to have a mind for those that we come in contact with the heart for our co-workers our extended family and to live a life that is ministering and an encouragement to other people John Bunyan said not Paul Bunyan but John Bunyan said you have not lived today until you've done something for someone who can never repay you right that's that's a lot to think about we could probably have a breakout session on this you have not lived today I mean then maybe you almost feel like well I ain't started Living yet John you have not lived today until you've done something for someone who can never repay you I mean that's that's an unselfish act whether you're not expecting anything in return and as a matter of fact there's no expectation that they may do anything in return you're not doing it because you will get something out of it that's a selfless act and he says you haven't lived until you've done that and I believe that's the idea that brother Adam's pointing to that I want to live for others and and we ought not to live unto ourselves as Jesus as Paul is saying now in Revelation the sermon Revelations chapter 5 part one this is when brother Brown was preaching the revelation of Jesus Christ which then becomes the the kind of the the form for the church age book listen to this conversation he's having with Dr Sam Adair he says a few days ago I was sitting talking to my loyal little friend here in the city of medical doctor Sam Adair and he said how are you doing bill and I said oh pretty fair I suppose doc I said yourself and he said oh a lot of patience patience is in you know medical patients he said I've had 15 examinations this afternoon I said well that's good as long as it's just examinations and finding nothing wrong I said you know and he says we got to talking about back when we were boys and I said well doc I don't know just how long I'm going to be around we're both in our 50s is that when you start having that thought oh boy and he said that's true bill and I said but all these years about 31 years of ministry now I've kept my heart prepared for that hour when he comes so it doesn't matter when he comes so he said that is true I said the greatest thrill I have is living for others and he said that's what life is makes life real it's not what you can do or accomplish for yourself but what you can do for others brother random affirms this seed that's when you're really living this is the idea conveyed by John Bunyan that's when you're really living if there happens to be someone Among Us who's never did that try to live for somebody else give that a try this is what I'd like to say to us as a church to all of our families and individuals here everyone here who's listening to this let's give this a try watch what he says let's just see how much more life holds for you when you'll not live for what you can get yourself out of life but what you can give someone else in life complete Paradigm Shift of of the layout mentality of get rich or die trying right and that's the attitude that this world has and this is kind of I'm going to get mine I'm going to fake it till I make it there's got to be some a Prestige that comes from it something that I can acculate a badge something I can wear but he says and even nowadays there's so many acts of service that are actually done for the views and not for the real service it's done as it may be a means of income for themselves and as a means of getting attention so let's not do it for the views right so he says does this see how much you can get out of life when you can give someone else in what you can give someone else in life and you'll find that it's more blessed than riches or anything that can be thought of what is the the act of doing something for somebody else it's what you can do for someone else that makes life's burdens which life in itself is a burden and everyone said amen and it'll make it a little lighter for somebody else and you just don't know the joy unless you've tried it once to do something for someone else I hope this can inspire you for all of us we can be inspired by this to think how can I serve other people what is it I can do and we don't all and I say I say we don't all I would say that the you know the first thing you should not be thinking about is money right well who can I give money to can I make balance this Ledger here no it's something even beyond that what you can add what you can lend what you can do for someone else and Romans chapter 15 verses 1 to 3 it says we then that are strong ought to Bear the infirmities of the weak and not to please ourselves this is something that we we should take consideration of and then I think it gives some comfort to those of us who may be wounded or we may be hurting we may not feel that we're at our spiritual best I mean what a comfort in knowing that there's others around us who are strong who are willing to Bear the infirmities of those of us who are weak and wounded and trying to find our way back or get our feet back underneath us but if we are strong and we feel confident in our relationship with God and we feel that we're going in the right direction this is kind of the next level in terms of the way we think and we live our lives as we don't please ourselves verse two that every one of us please his neighbor for his good to edification for our own good and for our own edification brother uh Stephen Bryant told me one time that when he testifies he says it's like watering yourself when you're saying something doing something good and testifying and speaking of the good things of God it has a way of Watering your own experience in your own testimony and thrilling you a little bit he says let every one of us uh please his neighbor for his good edification so that moderates what you're doing for your neighbor right things that edify things that are for his good and you say well I just thought what I would do is um you know throw a keg party for him or whatever and five dollars a cup he's like well that's probably not to his good and for his edification and says for even Christ please not himself but as it is written the reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me notice how Christ plays not himself this is how we Circle back around to they that live live not henceforth live not unto themselves but unto him into his image and and for him and for his purpose and so I could say just as brother Branham said if you ever want to do anything for me do something for my children then this is the attitude of Christ if you want to do something for me you want to serve me you want to give vent to your your inspiration and you want to give vent to your Revelation uh all the Adoration and praise you want to pour out on me that's fine he's saying to Christ saying he says but now you be Christ to somebody else why my hands are absent from this Earth you be my hands while my feet have yet not come back in that Millennial coming back under the feet on the earth you be my feet you be my hands you beat my eyes you be myself extended so he is as Christ pleased on himself then we ought to Bear the infirmities of others and not just please ourselves and we ought to do good unto our neighbors for their good to edification and I believe this makes an excellent family goal to find opportunities to serve others to find ways to be a blessing to others and I would even welcome the conversation with any heads of household or any young people or anyone that would say brother Aaron I want to know what I can do for God I want to know if there's more I can do I want to serve others I would welcome the conversation to explore the opportunities that can be made available to you to live for other people in Philippians chapter 2 verses 3 to 8 Paul says let nothing be done through Strife or vainglory that has relates a lot to politicking vanity selfishness party making trying to gain followers but in lowliness of Mind Let each esteem other better than themselves it's so easy to for it to roll off the tongue but there's something about it that just kind of hits the center of a lot of issues where you think about yourself more than you think of others you think better of yourselves and you think of other people and you you're quick to give yourself the benefit of the doubt but not to other people it says you should esteem other better than yourselves look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others in no way is he espousing that we ought to forsake our own responsibilities and obligations but it's a lack of selfishness that we who are strong begin to think of ways that we can support and help the weak and those that have can find ways to give though to those that have not even as we've read in the scripture that during that time of feasting and celebration those who gathered their things together and feasted they're also to give an offering to those who did not have who could not Harvest who couldn't bring Things To The Feast there's a provision even made in the Feast of the Passover that a family for a lamb and that if one family had a lamb and another one wasn't big enough to have a lamb or it was too much for one left that they came together and they shared provision an image you see even in the beginning in the the Church of the the book of Acts that there was a given and there was a service and there was a common ground that they all had so let every man not just look on his own things but also the things of others let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus this is why I Circle back to living unto him they that live will live unto him we have to live unselfishly we have to have this mind of Christ who've been in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God that also means not that not there was no illegality to it it was not contrary to the law it was not wrong the equality is not wrong but also it wasn't something easily grasped God likeness isn't just something easy if we think we're just going to be perfect and going to be in His image gonna be the full word born into manifestation again and there's not going to be some birth pains they're not going to be struggle for life there's not going to be pressure it's going to be overcoming no it's going to be a hard thing something not stolen or easily grasped but made himself of no reputation took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in a fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross if we have time tonight we'll come into the image of the Rich Young Ruler who was asked to take up the cross and so we have this scripture I think that's just so plain doesn't necessarily need a lot of definitions and a lot of different translations for us to get this that we ought to if we're going to become come into the image of Christ the image of Christ is the form of a servant it must be in that image the image of a servant not one who is seeking to be served but one that is seeking to serve that's our attitude as Christians not what can Christ do for me but what can I now do for Christ if I can do all things through Christ which gives me strength then what can I do for Christ if he is my sufficiency what is it that I can now do for him and to build the kingdom of God and do things the right way in the sermon at Thy word brother Branham says a person who lives their life for themselves for their self lives a selfish life we must live for others bear ye one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of Christ I believe it's coming from Galatians just think of that how beautiful that is bear you one another's burdens and what is what does it say in Galatians that every man ought to bear his own burden right so we all have our own burden that we ought to care we recognize this one went through this and one uh sometime over the last couple years where that scripture the word burden there is that what you were Laden with that you are made to carry as a ship Laden with goods and it's tasked with carrying goods across the across the pond um that's its job and so it's Laden down it's built for it the whole is built a certain way it can it has ballast and things to balance it and it's it's made to carry that load and you ought to Bear the load you were made to carry but then it says that we also are to Bear one another's burdens and that burden there is a complete different word and it means something else that's dragging somebody down and so we have to then be in a position to recognize that someone needs a little bit of support somebody needs a little bit of help and then we can therefore fulfill the law by burying one another's burdens and he says and we've got to have a feeling for one another and if that's what it is for some of us that we just simply don't feel it maybe we can ask God to give us the burden I believe I've shared this story before I ran into a situation one time where I was talking to somebody and I mentioned to them they had this opportunity it was it was just they were made for it they had everything to do for it I said man you're in a tremendous opportunity and position to do this for that church and they said yeah I don't have a burden for it and and immediately my thinking was no this isn't a situation where you have to get a burden this is where you pick one up this is where you take the initiative and you say I don't feel burdened to do it but I see the need so I'll take it and I'll begin to exercise my exercise myself in it and I'll take it on myself to carry this burden and so if some of you have all the resources and energy and opportunity to do something for somebody or even for this church and you're just waiting to have the burden pick it up right just take it take it on he says and therefore when you do all you know to how to do then when you do lay down at night well you have the consolation knowing that you tried your best that's just even help you go to sleep these are some of the best this is the best melatonin you could pay for it says pure grade no side effect melatonin you'll be able to go to bed at night laying down knowing you tried your best and I can't make everyone else believe I can't make everyone believe that's impossible I think this phrase is just so gorgeous so beautiful Jesus couldn't do that when he was on Earth and I know there'll just be a few that believes but if anything I can add to help the gospel that's my duty of being here is to try to help somebody along the way did you catch that even if they don't believe it's it's not even contingent upon well we'll just give them the word test we'll see whether they're elected or not right I remember one time I there was a minister who came over from overseas he's from India and after I shared this story with one Pastor he said brother I never met a preacher from India has head on Square uh head on straight but um and I guess he just ran into some of the nut jobs like I did that one night when no matter what I said about the message this guy believed it and already saw it and I was like I could probably say anything right now he's like hey man that's right that's right baptize the name William Branham because they're just and at that point I said you know what why don't you get out of my car right but I still took him home and fed him and and we were nice to him even though we realized he was just looking for any church whatever Church would feed him that night and that ought to be our heart I'm not doing this only for uh Believers or see things the same way I do I know that there's nothing wasted if I'm doing it under the one whom I know my reward comes from and I'm doing it just as Christ laid down his life for all he died for all that they which live could then do the same thing he did pay the price for all so it says if I'll do anything it's my duty to help try to somebody along the way even if they won't believe because it's not his job to make them believers but it's our job to treat them with respect and decency and it's our job to be to do service to others Galatians chapter 6 verses 8 9 and 10. for he that soweth to his flesh shall of his flesh reap corruption but he that soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life Everlasting what is that eternal life is is implied in that but abundant reap life Everlasting is Abundant Living you know this is a life of abundance of Life of fulfillment like it's what brother Brown was talking about I believe it says when you lay your head down at night you have a consolation of knowing you did your best there's uh there's some of us there's people who have maybe just uh a real Consciousness do they they couldn't live with themselves if they cheated somebody they couldn't live with themselves if they if they lied if they stole it they took a disadvantage of somebody and it's something that haunts them and they they say well I I wouldn't do that just so I can go to bed at night just so I can sleep at night is that not the phrase you know I do it just so I I wouldn't do that because I want to be able to go to sleep at night but now this is the it the the further extension of that when you serve others the consolation it brings the Abundant Living so now with this life Everlasting now kind of brought into our view he says and let us not be weary in well doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not I think we've used that here recently about this is you know be not weary when doing right when doing the will of God doing the right thing we should not be weary it really is the the the fuse that we need the the endless views we need in this war of attrition and constantly denying the world and constantly saying no to the devil we need Christ in there in the way keeping us from being weary and well doing so that we don't have that Fallout it says for in due season we shall reap if we faint not as we have therefore opportunity now this is kind of the logical progression of sowing to the spirit and reaping life Everlasting and being not weird and well doing as we therefore have opportunity we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men as you have opportunity let us do good unto all men especially unto them who are of the household of faith this is this is what I am thinking of when I say live for others is doing good unto all men especially them who are of the household of faith so there ought to be a special service there ought to be a special attention there ought to be a caring for our own and looking after the needs of those that are amongst us and those who are part of our body I believe that we have that Duty first it would be the idea of uh at Jerusalem first or charity begins at home that's that idea of looking after the needs of the those that are within our orbit within our lives within our reach but then if we have that practice and that habit of within our own family and then looking after the needs of the church and how we can help others and make others feel apart and be mindful of the things that make life difficult for them there's families that drive distances to come to church and then we have a youth meeting in the afternoon and they might find themselves orphaned while their kids are at a youth meeting and eating some of the best food and having some of the best conversations I'm telling you adults are missing out but there's uh there's maybe a way where if you could begin to think Beyond yourself you're like oh well you know what we're local we're not too far away from the church uh maybe we could have this family over why they're Children of the youth mean there's ways that we can begin to think Beyond ourselves or how can we help what can we do this is how we can live for others can we get an amen for those who don't live in Maricopa Valley it's something to think about and this to me establishes establishes that eternal life is living for others he says you sow to your the spirit if you sow to the flesh you're going to reap corruption that's that's not living but that's the most important thing is life that's not really living John Bunyan said you haven't lived today unless you've done something for someone who can never repay you so living is serving others right if we can get that idea and Paul is saying that if you sow to the spirit you're going to reap a living real living life Abundant Life and so he says therefore as you have have opportunity do good unto all men he establishes I believe clearly that eternal life is living for others Abundant Living is living for others and that's exactly what brother Branham taught us in that sermon that day on Calvary he says but don't look to what you've done look what they that look what that day on Calvary did to you it paid your price it settled the question your sins be a Scarlet they're white as snow red like Crimson white like wool then you have no sin you're perfectly sinless no matter what you've done or what you do you're still sinless praise the Lord can we just say praise the Lord thank you thank you Lord for justification now but is that what does that create inside of us now this idea of like what did you say sinless no matter what I do say it doesn't create this selfishness right so it says he says as long as you've accepted Christ Jesus Christ is your savior sins are forgiven anything that's forgiven is remitted and forgot about then what does it do it gives you after that condition he says uh as as long as you've accepted you Christ your savior your sins are forgive anything that's forgiven is remitted and forgot about then what does it do it gives you after that condition his Spirit to follow him and to do as he did for others who is following for you now I mean I feel like I'm just live for others who is falling on sorry yeah gives you his Spirit to follow him and to do as he did for others who is following on he was just one man the perfect man he gave his life and he made an example for you now what must we do this is a a beautiful thought Justified sinless no matter what you've done no matter what you do there's this representation that purges you and gives you this representation that you're clean that you are forgiven that you're Justified now what does it do it doesn't give us a get out of jail card whenever we do something wrong it gives us the spirit to follow him and then he being the perfect man gave his life and made an example for you then what's the example now what we might now what should we do now the first thing I want to say is Jesus never lived for himself his life was spent for others that is perfectly eternal life when you say you go to church and you do good things that's fine but when you live your life to yourself you haven't eternal life eternal life is living for others remember how you said hey if you haven't tried this yet you should try it so let me put it in this way if you have been Justified but you still are selfish and haven't lived for others then you don't even know what you have yet because you haven't begun to walk in the eternal life that you've inherited you haven't begun to walk in in the the power and the life and the overcoming and the Victory of what you've been forgiven until you begin to live for others he says eternal life is living for others it proved it when it come to the Lamb of God he lived and had eternal life because he did not live for himself he lived for others and you receive eternal life by receiving that day and you don't live for yourself no more you live for others is that very familiar with to you I know we've heard this many many times before as a matter of fact I believe this is one of those sermons where just about every scripture and every quote I read tonight I know I've already read over this pulpit here as since we've been passionate at this church because these are things that are familiar to us things that we ought to be reminded of in this way it's the year in review but now so a year in preview these are things I want to always and consistently on some regular basis reinforce that we live for others and the the all even all six of these principles are things that I never want to be far from our thoughts as a church and so he says and you don't live for yourself no more you live for others this is the reflection of Christ this is the the heart of true Christianity and true eternal life even the true religion is expressed and visiting the fatherless and the widows and and keeping yourself unspotted from the world this is this is what Christianity is then he says someone said how can you stand and let anyone call you such bad names you don't live for yourself I I kind of the way he all of a sudden interjects that he says you live for yourself and this is how you do he says but how could you do it for someone who calls you bad names how is it then you have the right response when people mistreat you because you're in the habit of living for others you're not in habit of self-protection you're not in the habit of self-justification you're not in the habit of self-defense right I'm in the habit of living for others when someone says something bad about you your your knee-jerk reaction is it to preserve yourself you already are walking free in your own justification so your knee you need your creation isn't to justify yourself so beautiful how he puts this you don't live for yourself you live for others that you might redeem that man you know what Manny's talking about the one that calls you such bad names that's the one he's talking about you become sons and the trouble of it is that the church has forgot they were Sons we've forgotten that we're children of Christ that we are children of God he says you are Sons you are taking Christ's place you are Sons so don't live for yourself live for others kind of a wake-up call isn't it I'm a Christian I'm a Child of God so that I'm not living for myself and I know this is going to sound strange I'm not just living for God I'm not just to praise him and just to exalt him and lift him up and write beautiful songs and have awesome worship services and all my praises to Him and all my adoration to him and then have a life void of a heart for people and then be selfish and stingy and rude and mean and cold-hearted and and fight like a bus song all these other things that sometimes are brought into the the vernacular we use when we're talking about our response to others he's saying No this is the first and foremost if I could say our first praise to God is how we treat other people says you're taking Christ's place your son so don't live for yourself live for others will brother Branham I can live for this brother because he sure is a nice man that's not it Live Well I think wait so he says that's not it live for that man who hates you do we have a lot of people to live for live for that person who would kill you if they could hmm what year did he say this how come they how come they found this reel to real hey we need to check the authenticity of this is this a deep fake you know the message but this is exactly this is it live for the man that hates you live for that person who would kill you if they could now let's just be real that ain't easy I don't even know what that looks like right I mean how could I live for the guy that would kill me if they had the opportunity that's what they've done to him they killed him and he died that he might save them that's eternal life when that's in your bosom you're facing heaven then we haven't even done an about face to Heaven until we can live for other people we're not even facing Heaven properly and fully until we can live for others who would even do wrong to us just taking the words of the message of the hour I'm reminded of the scriptures doing good unto those that would use you and despise you and do hateful and mean things to you that there's a good that we ought to do to all men there's an Integrity that a Believer has that is greater than the Integrity of the world because this world has its limits and they have their they have their freedoms and they have their Bill of Rights and they have their extensions of certain uh Liberties that we afford other people until it crosses a particular line but even as Christians we don't even have the same barriers that a lot of people in the world have that oh I'll be your friend until you cross me I'll be good to you till you cross me and then I've got to get mine I got to protect mine there's a selflessness of a Believer and again if you need to refer back to the series on berries and boundaries to not let this be taken to the the devil's extreme but there's a selflessness that a Believer has to where if you can't do something for them you're even willing to pray for the one that would kill you and that's us maybe those most simple way you can live for others he says when that's in your bosom your face in heaven then but you sacrifice your own things give them up like shape gives its wool you look on towards Calvary why because eternal life this life that I have inside of me is made to not live unto myself not even made to serve my own purpose but there's a self-sacrificing that's done to to fulfill the will of God if they lay that enters the caveat to fulfill the will of God that there's there's an unction inside of me that'll act in the in the face of hatred in the face of a murderous intent in the face of those who do wrong to me there's an unction inside of me called eternal life that is willing to live and to be self-sacrificial and to not respond in kind in order to be christ-like in Galatians chapter 5 verses 13 and 14. this is backing up from where we were in Galatians chapter six for Brethren you have been called unto Liberty only used not Liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another it's just it's beautifully written it's plain it's in the scripture that this Liberty we have in Christ the sinlessness this anchor of our souls to know that our Salvation is permanent and cannot be taken away from us is not an occasion then to just continue to gratify the flesh without the fear of Eternal punishment but it's to give us freedom to love one another through service for all the laws fulfilled in one word even this Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself that's what Christ was teaching us all along the prophets hang on this and Paul is saying all the law is fulfilled in one word even this all the law is fulfilled and thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself loving thy neighbor as thyself is living for others living for the neighbor giving yourself to to in in service to someone else living for somebody else Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself the text that we read in the beginning Luke chapter 10 if you recall the lawyer introduces the subject of what can I do to inherit eternal life and so Jesus says well you've asked a good question I guess you could say you know Jesus saying well you know what do you think what's written in the law how great is thou in other words what's required of the law and he recites this Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul with all thy strength and with all thy mind and love thy neighbor as thyself and Jesus says you got it do this and live because what does it really take to do that it takes you have to have eternal life to do this he says do that now shall live Thou shalt have eternal life this is life this is the what eternal life is eternal life is living for others what can I do to have eternal life well I'll tell you live for others it is it something selfless about it and so the lawyers retort this well who's my neighbor now who do I have to be good to how far does this go and Jesus uses the story of the Good Samaritan to provoke the thought within the lawyer's mind that it's not just the believer it's not just the one that sees the seventh seal just like you or it's not just those of your own household and their own blood but your neighbor being neighborly is showing Mercy and it's actually such a beautiful thought the way Jesus challenges so many different things and uses these characters in this Parable to bring Rey so many questions and bring so much into our view but when you ask them you know who do you think is the neighbor to this one and the answer says in Luke 10 37 and he said he that showed Mercy on him then Jesus sent Jesus unto him go and do thou likewise because Jesus is answering the question of eternal life eternal life is living for others we who claim to possess the gift of eternal life then do not live selfishly but we live beyond ourselves not that we we can't live foolish we can't live perishly we can't give what we don't have we should never give Beyond there ought to be a prudence and a wisdom to this so there's not there's not any implication nor should there be any um uh inference on your part that I am you know expressing some sort of Reckless living where I'm just living for others but you didn't have to give everything away I mean you do need a car to get to work well my neighbor needed it right signed it over to him you know there's there's a there's some wisdom here that that in your giving if you could think of it this way that if you're kind of inclined to extremes and fanaticism right if you're a Peter who's like Lord you can't wash my face hey if I don't wash your feet you can have any part with me just dump me man head to toe just get every part of me wet and that's kind of the Peter mentality if that's kind of your tendency is to kind of be extreme and you're already trying to plot ways that you can just give away your 401k and and give out give away all your Bitcoin and everything because you want to live for others think about it in this sense that God is not going to require your service to others that's going to compromise your ability to serve him and to continue to serve others there's some wisdom that we can begin to have with this that living for others is not wasting my ability to serve God or compromise the ability to serve God or to continue to serve my family right continue to be effective within my own home within my own church and so I you know I'm saying this maybe not for us but for the neighbor in the apartment next door who just may be prone to fanaticism there's a wisdom that comes with this living for others but I feel that I can't uh can't say it with more fervancy or enough fervency that we ought to have this mind to love our neighbors as ourselves and the sermon the world has fallen apart brother bam says I'm I was talking to the cab driver coming down for those who don't know what a cab is it's kind of like an Uber driver Lyft I might have heard of those I was talking to the Uber driver coming down we was talking about some delinquent children up there and he said I think it's the parents I said amen and he's like yeah you get my tapes he says amen fella I don't know who you are but you're right on the right Road it's a good thing to say to your driver and I said that's right I said it's too bad that they've took the Bible out of the home and give them a deck of cards why is it getting so quiet and that started in the church I would stand on the elevator a few moments ago and a certain woman on there talking to another said well you know he said this is a wonderful thing our church is given a card party and how they're going to have some kind of a Thanksgiving turkey Affair that they was going out out of a Protestant church gambling Lottery Bunko dances he says stuff like that to entertain the church remember when I said in the beginning eternal life is an overlooked or often forgotten form of family entertainment eternal life is living for others Billy Graham says the church born again the Holy Ghost entertains the church with eternal life so how can the Holy Ghost entertain our families by us living for others this is probably the best form of family entertainment that we can have is living for others that as a family if there's a moment a time and a way even if it's just at the minimum through prayer who could we pray for tonight who is it that we can think of and ways that we can reach out and show kindness there's enough prayer requests that go out over this Pulpit where we have things that we can pray about as a family and we're living for others there's enough things and needs that come up we can always ride a nice car to think of a way that you could do something kind for somebody else our church has a wonderful testimony beyond our church here where I get uh my own family's been ministered to by the people in this church people sending gifts they heard my aunt had cancer people sent things and have provided cards and letters and we hear back and even have done that brother Michael I think even your own families testified to our prayer request goes out and says what can I do to help how can I help them and people have made things and sit things out as it's a wonderful testimony that now I get text messages from people and say hey I just had some somebody do really really nice something for me was this someone in your church right and they start here because that's because there's people who've taken this to Heart and I'm wanting I'm like uh should I claim it I mean should I say well technically you know they're all part of my church you know I mean I don't know I just say hey it wasn't me right or I don't know or maybe they need to be a part of our church what's their number but there's a it's wonderful when we can have that instinct and testimony of a church that you know what they're the reaching out kind they're the thoughtful kind they're the ones that are always looking Beyond themselves and I couldn't think of a better way for us to grow and prosper as a church the right ways than for us to begin to begin to be unselfish with what we have and live for others I desire for us to have um facilities I think these are very very nice and I thank God for it and the sacrifice that have been made for us to have this there may be some changes coming up to facilitate larger facilities and more room for people and I'd love to have um maybe maybe the short ceiling makes me look tall I don't know but maybe I'd love to have something a little bit more clearance so we can have brother Eli pray sometime you know and other things where he's worshiping back there and his hand is just like this on the ceiling right it's like how does that texture feel up there you like that huh is that a satin finish semi-gloss on the roof there I haven't been able to touch it you know there's there's just things that we might we want may want more of as a church I know and it doesn't need to begin by having a fun drive it could just Begin by having a fun drive right entertain ourselves by living for others like just just thinking Beyond ourselves and how can we help and how can we give and and why we would sure love to build a church but you know what we could probably have a faster track to building this church by building a few churches in Tanzania sure yes yes right why because we begin to entertain ourselves with eternal life and if you're saying wow that's kind of a neat little trick okay fine eternal life is living for others and the holy goes to Interchange that entertains the church with eternal life I believe there's some way by some degree we can arrive at our entertainment should be part of it should be living for others and that's how we can have some entertainment in our fans that's how we can allow the Holy Ghost to entertain us we maybe let Hollywood and and sports and movies and games and a lot of things entertain us a lot of recreation a lot of hobbies a lot of Endeavors we do whether it be hunting whether it be certain things that we enjoy for Collectibles you name it there's a lot of things that we can do that we have fun around I'm not saying anything about that I'm just saying there's another area of entertainment that we can have and that's living for others it's an interesting statement in Mark chapter 9 verse 35 and he sat down and called the twelve and said to them if any man desires to be first the same shall be last of all and servant of all this is what we ought to have as a church a servant's heart to be Servants of all in this pair or not the parable but in the story of the Rich Young Ruler Mark chapter 10 verses 21 to 22 I just want to refer to it very very quickly just make this point I believe we made this point in uh the series on talking about practice he said then Jesus Behold Him loved him said unto him because he gave what he came kind of with the same question right same question as a lawyer it says one thing about lack is go thy way so whatsoever thou Hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven come take up the cross and follow me this is that that christ-like mentality who made himself of no reputation who being in the form of God thought about robbery to be equal with God but made himself with no reputation took upon him the form of man humbled himself became obedient even to the death of the Cross he's willing to be selfless unselfish and bear the sacrificial burden which was death and so Christ is asking the rich wrong ruler not not an easy thing but a very very difficult thing he tells him to sell everything he has to give to the poor that he may have treasure in heaven come take up the cross and follow me and it says and he was sad at that saying and went away grieved for he had great possessions see the goal of Christ was not to make the Rich Man Poor but the goal of Christ was to get him to turn his eyes towards heaven and no longer live Desiring to accumulate wealth and maintain prestige and have for his own sake but to turn his eyes towards heaven and live for others so the goal of Christ was that poverty the goal of Christ was service the goal that Christ wanted to have within this young man's heart was to stir up whether or not there was any inkling of of eternal life inside of him that could be lit at the thought of serving someone else is it isn't that the only way that we receive eternal life is when we're willing to no longer live to satisfy ourselves but willing down to live for God and it's this desire for him to become our Lord and to no longer live unto sin and live in the pleasures of this world but we turn the other way and we turn towards Christ and we repent of our sins and we are now willing to Humble ourselves and live for him and the reason why we can do that is that germ of life is eternal and it's it's designation is not to live selfishly but to live for others Christ first and then by extension therefore I have to live for others so what he was provoking inside of this Rich wrong ruler wasn't this thought of well I could I guess I could live with nothing I don't doesn't matter to me I mean there's some people that they don't they don't need a bed they'll sleep anywhere I mean even as grown adults it's like hey I can live out of my car hey and they don't need a lot but it's it's not so much just how much you can be a base and how poor you can be and hey man I'm completely worthless you know I'm so broke I can't even pay attention no it's it's this idea of just changing your mind to where I'm not living for myself the goal is not poverty the goal is service and if I could put it this way the goal is neither riches nor poverty the goal is being christ-like the goal is service service to Christ and therefore by extension to others I've got two minutes before we make it to the after hour in the church age book chapter six it's my last statement chapter on thyterra Jesus said he that is greatest of all is servant to all there's that statement the servant of all the wise man commented on that saying here's what he said only history will prove the truth of the that dictum that man was right you notice I know he's going to express he's going to express it and begin to amplify it but do you realize what he's saying it's only once we give account of how you lived your life it's only in the final analysis that we'll know those people who truly lived not under themselves but unto others only history will prove the truth of that that man was right all the truly great men of history have been servants they who demanded to be served they who oppressed they who sought to always be at the head and have got have gone down in shame even the very rich are condemned by God when they have not used their wealth right but look into history and you'll find that the truly great were those who served others are we not taught in the message that a great man makes you feel great history can never claim those for whom much was done but will forever praise those who did much for others now let us apply that to ourselves even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto you but to minister so we are to follow that example oh I just love this see him as he bows himself over the feet of the Apostles and washes their tired and dirty feet he says you don't know now what I'm doing but you will know hereafter but what you see me doing you ought to also to do he became a servant in order that God could Elevate him to the highest Heights and one day in the Judgment of the Saints we are going to hear him say Well done good and faithful servant enter thou under the joy of the Lord I think he's using that scripture at a very specific application to the believer it is hard to be always a servant but those who spend and are spent for others will one day be seated with him in his throne it will be worth it all then if I could say if it's very difficult for you to even begin to comprehend the benefits that you may receive within your family within your personal life by living unselfishly by living for others if it's hard for you to think how this may Express itself in some sort of material benefit here on Earth or greater consolation when you lay your head down even if you don't seem to experience it like maybe you say well man brother Aaron made it seem like I was going to be a millionaire in six weeks if I just started Living for others if it doesn't happen exactly the way you're thinking it should tonight let me say this one day it will be worth it all thus saith Lord one day it will be worth it all and so let me just uh take this moment now as I believe will be next Sunday this coming Sunday we're going to maybe try to wrap up on those three that we've been focusing on Sunday and sum all this up on next Wednesday night and in this series if God will allow me to and permit you let me just say this that I believe that we've been given some very clear footprints that we can follow in to achieve Godly success this year and if we could even have this as our aim as we see this as breadcrumbs these are things I know ought to be doing these are things I know ought to be doing and for some of you you might be in that mode of already doing all these things and I'm giving you a big pat on the back Jose I'm giving you a lot of ambition and a lot of encouragement to keep doing what you're doing but if I could just say for the next uh maybe for some of us maybe the thing that we've got to move into is this unselfishness to begin to serve on a greater level and a greater capacity if I can say this way in the image of the son of man because that's what the son of man is manifesting himself in in this hour is a bride not saying what can he do for me what can he do for me but giving expression to our Revelation in service to others let's bow our heads in prayer our gracious Heavenly Father Lord I just want to pray for these people now and this this climax of this service with such a strong anointing and a desire in the people's hearts Lord for the things of God and a desire to be right a desire to serve a desire to be found faithful Lord I pray now for these families for the heads of household for the young ladies who are living on their own and for the young men who are bachelors in their apartments and their houses Lord for the for the the veterans amongst us and the elders the grandparents those who have already raised their children those who are in that season of the different seasons of life may we all come under this common bond in this common burden that we can give vent to this revelation of the message by how we treat others and how we live for others and I pray Lord for us us tonight that as a family as a church family we can have a heart and a burden for others I pray for our own families as I said it in the very beginning may this not be an overlooked form of entertainment may we as we would find ways to sanctify our home and find moments to gather around the word may we find some way in our lives and in our homes Avenues and opportunities to live for others Granite I pray Lord as I commit the people to you now Lord if there be a heart that would reach out to you and lift their hand and say Lord I want to live for others made you endure us Lord may your Holy Spirit give us strength to live for others give us the resources to live for others I do not believe that there can be a desire unless there be a provision there'll be something there to meet that desire so Lord I'm praying that you would drive away any selfishness any fear for lack of provision may we be like that Widow is there a fat Lord who is just so willing willing to give of her resources and may we Lord take even from our little Lord pledge it to you for a little as much when you are in it may we labor for the right things Lord I commit the people to you tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen Hallelujah could we stand together
