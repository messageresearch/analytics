[0:00] Genesis 24:1, "And Abraham was old and
[0:03] well stricken in age, and the Lord had
[0:05] blessed Abraham in all things." And
[0:08] Abraham said unto his eldest servant of
[0:10] his house, and many believe, and I know
[0:12] Brother Brandham taught that this would
[0:13] have been Eleazar, very trusted servant
[0:16] that ruled over all that he had, put, I
[0:19] pray thee, thy hand under my thighs.
[0:21] This is a way of swearing an oath and
[0:23] making a covenant. I will make thee
[0:25] swear by the Lord, the God of heaven,
[0:27] and the God of the earth, that thou
[0:28] shalt not take a wife unto my son of the
[0:31] daughters of the Canaanites among whom I
[0:33] dwell. But thou shalt go unto my country
[0:36] and to my kindred, and take a wife unto
[0:38] my son Isaac." And the servant said unto
[0:41] him, P per adventure, the woman will not
[0:43] be willing to follow me unto this land.
[0:45] Must thy needs bring thy son again unto
[0:47] the land from whence thou camest?
[0:49] Abraham said unto him, Beware that thou
[0:51] bring not my son thither again. The Lord
[0:54] God of heaven, which took me from my
[0:56] father's house, and from the land of my
[0:58] kindred, which spake unto me, and that
[1:00] swear unto me, saying, Unto thy seed
[1:02] will I give this land. He shall send his
[1:04] angel before thee, and thou shalt take a
[1:06] wife unto my son from thence. If the
[1:09] woman will not be willing
[1:13] to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear
[1:15] from this my oath, only bring not my son
[1:18] thither again." And the servant put his
[1:20] hand under the thigh of Abraham his
[1:22] master, and swear to him concerning that
[1:24] matter. Amen. I just trust God could
[1:27] really bless this to us tonight. You can
[1:28] be seated.
[1:30] My title is three words: composed,
[1:33] conducted, performed. Composed,
[1:37] conducted, performed. And I was glad
[1:38] that I could settle on a title. So many
[1:40] different things in my mind and subjects
[1:42] and wanting to break this up into
[1:43] different ones. I know there's
[1:45] tremendous continuity with the subjects
[1:46] that we've been on this year and even as
[1:48] late on this, but composed, conducted,
[1:51] performed. There's a lot in those words
[1:53] tonight to chew on. To start, I want to
[1:56] just define what a composer is. It's one
[1:58] who creates music. So a composer in the
[2:01] way that we're intending it today is one
[2:03] that today is one that writes and
[2:05] arranges musical compositions or pieces
[2:08] and even that word to compose is a
[2:11] placing together. It's putting placing
[2:13] something together with something else.
[2:15] So it's a it's an arrangement. So a
[2:17] musical composer creates music. They
[2:20] write and arrange it. Luke 1 vers1
[2:23] there's a Greek word used here that's
[2:25] defined or translated as set in order.
[2:28] And Luke writes, "For as much as many
[2:30] have taken in hand to set forth in order
[2:32] a declaration of those things which are
[2:34] most surely believed among us," and he
[2:36] uses this, "As others have composed
[2:39] this, I am also going to share with you
[2:42] these things that I have." So Luke was
[2:44] composing a declaration himself. He was
[2:46] the writer of the book of Luke. And so
[2:49] that's a creative act. But on this word
[2:52] conducted, a conductor is one who leads
[2:54] or guides. So follow me in each one of
[2:57] these definitions. A composer is one
[2:58] that creates, write and arrange the
[3:00] music. But then a conductor can be
[3:02] someone completely different and they're
[3:04] one who guides the music or leads or
[3:06] guides. To conduct, it means to lead
[3:09] together, to bring together. And we know
[3:12] that it also would speak to something. I
[3:13] think there's a type there, an object
[3:15] through which energy or heat passes if
[3:17] you're a conductor. So there's a lot of
[3:19] different ways you could look at this as
[3:20] a type of biblical truth. So you have a
[3:23] composer who writes it, a conductor who
[3:25] leads it or guides it, and it's a
[3:27] performer as we use this other word
[3:30] perform. That's one who accomplishes or
[3:32] fulfills to carry into effect or
[3:34] discharge a duty or to fulfill or uh
[3:37] discharge what is required or commanded.
[3:40] A performer. And so in a musical sense,
[3:42] it's one who to sing. One who sings,
[3:44] they're a performer. Or one who renders,
[3:47] plays a musical instrument. So we could
[3:50] see there's a composer. They're the ones
[3:52] that creates a composition and then
[3:54] there's a conductor and then there's a
[3:57] performer. While the conductor creates,
[3:59] the composer leads and directs the
[4:02] performer. So, you see these elements
[4:04] we're looking at here. You have a
[4:05] composer, you have a conductor, and then
[4:07] the performer. I'm just going to rely on
[4:08] you tonight, Rowan, to make sure that
[4:10] I'm making progress. So, don't don't
[4:12] want to lose you. Everybody else, they
[4:13] can do whatever they want, but I need
[4:14] you right here, and that'll help me
[4:16] tonight. and a composer having written
[4:18] it. Now that it's the conductor who
[4:20] works together with the performers and
[4:22] leads and guides them, the composer
[4:24] works independently
[4:26] and and they're they're thinking about
[4:28] how it would be conducted. They're
[4:29] thinking about performers, but they're
[4:31] writing this piece of their own creative
[4:34] act and their own inspiration, but the
[4:36] com conductor will work closely with the
[4:39] performers
[4:40] a
[4:40] &gt;&gt; and to lead them and guide them guide
[4:42] them. And so a conductor collaborates
[4:44] with the performers in order to
[4:46] interpret and to bring the composer's
[4:49] composition to life. So a composer has
[4:53] this genius or this intelligence, this
[4:55] inspiration and writes something and
[4:57] it's this musical piece, this
[4:59] arrangement, this putting together of
[5:00] things and then a conductor learns that
[5:02] piece and knows that piece and then
[5:04] collaborates with the performers for a
[5:06] performance. And you all have all seen
[5:08] this before. You see it with choirs.
[5:10] You're like, well, why do they need a
[5:11] choir director? Why do they need a
[5:12] conductor? These are all accomplished
[5:15] musicians being paid a lot to be in this
[5:17] worldrenowned uh symphony orchestra or
[5:19] whatever the the arrangement might be.
[5:21] And they still have a conductor that
[5:22] conducts because they know the music.
[5:24] They've worked and practiced hundreds of
[5:26] hours together. And then in the time of
[5:28] the production, the conductor is still
[5:30] leading and guiding the performers to
[5:32] accomplish what the composer had in
[5:35] their mind when they wrote the music.
[5:38] And I want to use this and so they they
[5:40] work together to interpret the
[5:41] composition or in other words bring what
[5:44] has already been composed in some form
[5:46] to life.
[5:48] And I want to look at it from this
[5:49] standpoint that God is the composer and
[5:52] God as the Holy Spirit that the Lord
[5:54] that moving force is the conductor and
[5:57] you are the performer.
[6:00] In second Peter 1:es 20 and 21, I'm just
[6:03] looking at this at God as the composer,
[6:05] knowing this first that no prophecy of
[6:07] the scriptures of any private
[6:09] interpretation.
[6:10] The day and age of remixes and anybody
[6:12] can do their own arrangement and use
[6:14] whatever samples they want when it comes
[6:16] to a song. Uh that changes maybe the
[6:18] original intent of the composer like
[6:22] this is the way they intended it to
[6:23] sound. And so scripture isn't just
[6:25] something you sampled. Scripture is not
[6:27] something you want to cover and just
[6:29] make your own arrangement too. God's
[6:32] word is of no private interpretation. In
[6:34] other words, the composer composes it a
[6:36] certain way. For the prophecy came not
[6:38] in old time by the will of man. But holy
[6:42] men of God. So there's this God directed
[6:45] that these they spoke from God. God as
[6:48] if he's speaking from a man. They spake
[6:50] as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.
[6:52] That word there speaks as they were
[6:54] carried along by the Holy Ghost. So
[6:56] here's God through the agency of man
[6:59] carried along by the Holy Ghost speaking
[7:01] through the scriptures. So scripture is
[7:03] God's composition.
[7:04] &gt;&gt; If you look in the sense of a drama or
[7:06] an act, God composed this drama. This
[7:08] composition holds prophecy. It's his
[7:10] will. It's his plan. God composed it.
[7:13] Second Timothy 3:16 says all scripture
[7:15] is is God breathed. So who wrote it? Not
[7:18] just these prophets and not these men.
[7:20] But they it was God breathed. God u
[7:23] composed then God conducted. But then
[7:25] the men wrote it out.
[7:28] &gt;&gt; Deuteronomy 4:13, we look at this maybe
[7:31] from a different view. God has given
[7:32] these commandments to Israel through
[7:35] Moses. These ten commandments even as it
[7:37] references here and he says, "And he
[7:38] declared unto you his covenant which he
[7:40] commanded you to perform." So God could
[7:43] write it. God gives the covenant. God
[7:45] gives the promises. But then he says,
[7:46] "Even the ten commandments and he wrote
[7:48] them upon two tables of stone." Who
[7:50] wrote it? God wrote it.
[7:52] &gt;&gt; Uh they were his commandments. They were
[7:54] his composition. But who was to perform
[7:56] it? Israel was
[7:57] &gt;&gt; right.
[7:58] &gt;&gt; And so the word is composed.
[8:02] I like the levels. It was brother
[8:03] Michael Jenkins that shared with me just
[8:04] even that other meaning of composure to
[8:06] be composed to have some composure not
[8:09] just be unduly influenced. The word is
[8:11] composed by God. It's conducted by God
[8:14] and then it's performed
[8:16] &gt;&gt; performed even by the composed and the
[8:19] conducted.
[8:20] And so look at it as God the composer,
[8:22] the conductor, Christ, the Holy Spirit,
[8:24] which we know is God, and the performer
[8:27] being flesh, someone who's actively
[8:29] fulfilling God's word. And we can see
[8:32] this image of composed, conducted, and
[8:35] performed in Jesus Christ. John 6:38,
[8:38] for I am come down from heaven not to do
[8:40] my own will, but the will of him that
[8:43] sent me. Just think very deeply about
[8:44] what we ministered on on Sunday. I
[8:46] haven't left the subject. We're just
[8:47] going forward to this point this year.
[8:50] no part two so far. And so we're just
[8:52] we're wanting to hopefully some of these
[8:54] things carry through. But he came down
[8:55] from heaven not to do his own will to uh
[8:58] to live his own life or to make his own
[9:00] declaration to compose his own story or
[9:02] make his own way but the will of him
[9:04] that sent him. So he's doing the will of
[9:08] the father. The father has laid out a
[9:10] plan for him. He's composed a plan for
[9:12] his life. The prior chapter in verse 30
[9:15] says I can of my own self do nothing.
[9:17] Not that he didn't have the ability, but
[9:19] he had submitted himself to God as I
[9:21] hear I judge. So he was hearing
[9:24] something from God and my judgment is
[9:26] just because I seek not my own will but
[9:28] the will of the father which hath sent
[9:30] me. There's numerous scriptures we could
[9:32] use in this vein that show the mindset
[9:35] of Jesus Christ that he was now he is
[9:38] acting according to God's playbook. He's
[9:41] acting according to God's drama, his
[9:43] composition in this symphony. He wasn't
[9:45] singing his own tune and playing his own
[9:47] solo, but he was following God and being
[9:50] conducted. The Holy Spirit came to dwell
[9:52] in him. Him hath the He hath the father
[9:54] sealed there on the Jordan River. He's
[9:56] led of the spirit into the wilderness
[9:58] right away. What is that? According to
[10:00] God's word, his composition, he's being
[10:02] conducted according to that word. You
[10:05] find many places where it says, "And
[10:06] this happened that it might be
[10:07] fulfilled." He had need to go this way.
[10:09] Why? That it might be fulfilled in the
[10:11] composition. The Bible having been
[10:13] written a certain way, he had to do
[10:15] this.
[10:16] &gt;&gt; Says in John 5 17 to20, but Jesus
[10:19] answered, "My father worketh hitherto,
[10:21] and I work." Therefore, the Jews sought
[10:23] the more to kill him because he had not
[10:26] only had broken the Sabbath. See,
[10:27] there's the honesty there. There's the
[10:28] scripture telling us it wasn't when he
[10:30] says, "For what good deed do you crucify
[10:32] me?" Oh, no, not good deeds. It's
[10:34] because you make yourself God. They
[10:36] wanted to kill him for this, too. the
[10:38] good deeds on the Sabbath, but said
[10:40] also, this is the more to kill him, that
[10:42] God was his father, making himself equal
[10:44] to God. And we all say, what hypocrites
[10:47] then answered Jesus and said unto them,
[10:48] "Verily, verily, I say unto you, the Son
[10:50] can do nothing of himself, but what he
[10:53] seeth the Father do." Here's the seeing,
[10:55] the hearing, the understanding, that
[10:56] that resonance, that sympathetic
[10:58] resonance to know, to understand. For
[11:00] what thingsoever he doeth, these also
[11:02] doeth the Son likewise. What is he? He's
[11:05] seeing the composition. He's seeing the
[11:07] plan of God. He knows how he's written
[11:09] this out. And he's being led of the
[11:11] Spirit. For the Father loveth the Son,
[11:13] and showeth him all things that he that
[11:15] himself doeth, and he will show him
[11:17] greater works than these, that ye may
[11:20] marvel. So, he's he knows what God's
[11:23] plan is, and he's acting according to
[11:25] that plan. We alluded to this. There's a
[11:28] number of places we could use this. I'm
[11:30] trying to just piece it together kind of
[11:31] chronologically in his ministry. Now,
[11:33] Matthew chapter 26:56.
[11:36] Actually, this is at the end of his
[11:38] ministry. This is not chronological. But
[11:39] all this was done that the scriptures of
[11:41] the prophets might be fulfilled. Then
[11:44] all the disciples forsook him and fled.
[11:47] And so these things that are transpired
[11:48] at the time of his arrest and his soon
[11:50] cominging trial, it says it happened
[11:52] that the scriptures of the prophets
[11:54] might be fulfilled. So whose plan was
[11:57] it? The prophets? No, they spake for
[11:59] God. It
[12:00] &gt;&gt; was God's plan that inspired these men
[12:03] to lay out these prophecies. Jesus is
[12:06] operating according to what has already
[12:07] been prophesied.
[12:09] &gt;&gt; Luke 4:21. And he began to say unto
[12:11] them, "This day is this scripture
[12:13] fulfilled in your ears." What was
[12:15] happening? He is fulfilling and doing
[12:17] what was required of him in the
[12:19] scripture.
[12:20] &gt;&gt; Prior one I was going to use, I skipped
[12:22] over it. Mark chapter 14:49.
[12:25] I was daily with you in the temple
[12:26] teaching and you took me not. But the
[12:28] scriptures must be fulfilled.
[12:30] &gt;&gt; It had to be fulfilled. There was times
[12:33] when they couldn't take them because it
[12:35] wasn't not yet time according to
[12:36] prophecy. And he's saying, "I was there
[12:38] and you didn't take me." But ultimately,
[12:39] these scriptures must be fulfilled. So
[12:42] the the what God had written, what God
[12:44] had breathed, the Bible became that
[12:46] boundary, this composition that needed
[12:49] to be followed. So scripture must be
[12:51] fulfilled.
[12:53] Paul writes of this in 1 Corinthians
[12:55] chapter 15:es
[12:57] 1 to 4. more of a brethren, I declare
[12:59] unto you the gospel which I preached
[13:01] unto you, which also you have received,
[13:03] and wherein you stand. It's the gospel
[13:05] that Paul preached. By which also you
[13:08] are saved, by whose gospel? He says, the
[13:10] gospel that he preached. If you keep in
[13:13] memory what I preached unto you, unless
[13:15] you have believed in vain. This is a a
[13:17] hard saying for a lot of people because
[13:19] Paul is saying, "The gospel I preached
[13:21] to you, you'll be saved if you keep it
[13:22] in your memory,
[13:25] unless you've believed in vain." So
[13:27] there's this this sense of well this by
[13:29] grace you are saved. How does this fit
[13:32] in? And I'm I'm only pointing that out.
[13:33] There's things in the Bible that are
[13:34] that fun to wrestle with. For I
[13:38] delivered unto you first of all that
[13:39] which I also received. How that Christ
[13:43] died for our sins according to the
[13:45] scriptures. So in what Paul received, he
[13:49] could take back to the Bible and say
[13:51] this is what God had revealed. Christ
[13:53] died accord for our sins according to
[13:56] the scriptures and that he was buried
[13:57] and that he rose again the third day
[14:00] according to the scriptures. So here's
[14:02] Paul saying these things happen in the
[14:04] life of Christ just exactly the way God
[14:06] had written it out beforehand. I hope
[14:09] you can see that in that sense of
[14:10] something being laid out. This is the
[14:13] way it's going to be and then someone
[14:14] hitting those notes in their life as
[14:16] Christ did. It was composed, conducted,
[14:19] performed by Christ. John 5:es 36 to4 he
[14:24] says but I have greater witness than
[14:25] that of John for the works with the
[14:27] which the father hath given me to finish
[14:29] there's your performance the fulfillment
[14:31] the same works that I do bear witness of
[14:33] me that the father hath sent me the
[14:35] father himself which hath sent me hath
[14:37] borne witness of me you have neither
[14:39] heard his voice at any time nor seen his
[14:41] shape and you have not his word abiding
[14:43] in you for whom he hath sent him ye
[14:45] believed not and that was the great work
[14:47] of God is to believe
[14:50] &gt;&gt; on him whom have sent that would show
[14:52] God's working in your heart. It would
[14:53] show that the composition through the
[14:55] conducting is having an impact through
[14:57] the performance upon you
[14:59] &gt;&gt; and you're becoming a part of it.
[15:01] &gt;&gt; So he says, "Search the scriptures."
[15:03] &gt;&gt; A great challenge. Search the scripture
[15:05] for in them ye think you have eternal
[15:07] life. You believe the Bible, you believe
[15:08] the scripture, you believe these things,
[15:10] then search them because you think
[15:11] there's life in them. He says, "And it's
[15:14] those scriptures that testify of me." He
[15:16] says, "But yet you will not come to me
[15:17] that you might have life." showing that
[15:19] incredible
[15:21] uh paradox of those who can believe so
[15:24] diligently in the Bible but can't follow
[15:27] in the fulfillment or the light of it
[15:30] and they won't come to the Christ of the
[15:32] Bible. They want to come to their
[15:33] imaginary God of the Bible.
[15:37] But Jesus Christ being conducted was to
[15:40] perform or finish the will of the father
[15:42] as it pertained to him. God having
[15:44] written it out, he says, "Search the
[15:46] scriptures."
[15:48] Now,
[15:50] the composed, conducted, and performed.
[15:53] We can see these elements in the story
[15:56] of Isaac and Rebecca. We've read just
[15:59] these first nine verses in Genesis
[16:00] chapter 24. And there's just such a
[16:02] great type. Don't you believe there's a
[16:04] great type in this for us? The time that
[16:06] we're living in now, especially when we
[16:07] read the book of Revelation, that this
[16:09] is a wedding time. This is bride time.
[16:11] &gt;&gt; It's what the message reveals to us.
[16:13] this time of uniting time. And I want
[16:16] you to look at this, see how that you
[16:18] see a performer that's being conducted
[16:21] according to a composition.
[16:23] And if I could put it in this way, I I
[16:25] want you to think about these these
[16:27] dynamics of leadership
[16:30] and and what it looks like to be led or
[16:32] what it is or what leading looks like
[16:35] because that's what the children of God,
[16:37] God's children are led by God's spirit.
[16:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. So they say, "Well, what what what
[16:42] makes you God's child? You're led of
[16:44] God's spirit."
[16:45] &gt;&gt; That that it's a very outstanding
[16:48] characteristic of a child of God. That's
[16:50] why when you don't aren't allowed to
[16:52] follow the leadership of the Holy
[16:54] Spirit, you feel displaced. The Bible
[16:56] says you become a bastard because
[16:58] children of God are led by the spirit of
[17:00] God. So I want you to think about
[17:01] they're talking about the leadership of
[17:02] the Holy Spirit, the leadership of God,
[17:04] and what leading looks like. And because
[17:06] all of us can say, "Well, the Lord led
[17:08] me to do this. The Lord led me to do
[17:09] that. the Lord led me to do this. And we
[17:11] would always treasure that for anyone
[17:12] else.
[17:14] &gt;&gt; But we want to look, we want to see what
[17:15] leading looks like.
[17:17] &gt;&gt; Is the leading of the Lord a maverick
[17:19] just out into off on his own doing
[17:21] nothing with anybody else and and
[17:23] antirist signs and and contrary to
[17:26] scripture? You'd say, "Well, now hard
[17:28] for me to accept that's the leading of
[17:29] the Lord." But we could see where in the
[17:31] composition God has that dissonant
[17:33] makebelief
[17:34] &gt;&gt; or unbelief.
[17:36] So, let's just look at this. And I I may
[17:39] I may be jinxing myself. Elliot tells me
[17:42] all the time, there's such a thing as
[17:43] that. And I may be jinxing myself right
[17:46] now, but I just feel like I can be done
[17:47] in under an hour. This is going great.
[17:50] Ruin it for me, please.
[17:53] But let's look at how these elements
[17:55] play out in Genesis chapter 24. I'll
[17:57] start to verse one. We'll read through
[17:58] this and pause a little bit. Abraham was
[18:00] old and well stricken in age, and the
[18:02] Lord had blessed Abraham in all things.
[18:05] And Abraham said unto his el eldest
[18:07] servant of his house that ruled over all
[18:09] that he had. So let's think about
[18:10] Eleazer in this regard. I'm very
[18:12] comfortable in that based upon what
[18:14] brother Brandham taught us. Put I pray
[18:16] thee thy hand under thy thigh and I will
[18:19] make thee swear by the Lord the God of
[18:21] heaven and the God of the earth that and
[18:24] notice he has a vision. He has an
[18:26] objective. He has a plan that thou shalt
[18:28] not take a wife unto my son of the
[18:30] daughters of the Canaanites among whom I
[18:32] dwell. So now he's sharing with him that
[18:36] he has that um Eleazar
[18:39] has a mission to go find a wife for his
[18:42] son Isaac. So he says, "You're you're
[18:44] you're not to find one here in this land
[18:46] that we presently dwell, but go back to
[18:48] the land I was taken out of where my
[18:50] kins live, but thou shalt go unto my
[18:52] country and to my kindred and take a
[18:54] wife unto my son Isaac." Look at it as
[18:57] Abraham uh composing giving a directive
[19:00] composing a a mission statement for
[19:02] Elees or laying out a a plan uh for his
[19:06] son. And this is what I want for my son.
[19:08] I want him to have a wife of my kindred.
[19:10] I don't want him to have a Canaanite
[19:11] wife. I want him to have someone from my
[19:13] father's family from the land of the
[19:15] Caldanss or wherever wherever my
[19:17] bloodline is from. I want you to go. And
[19:19] now Ezer, this eldest servant uh is
[19:23] going to be the one who is fulfilling or
[19:26] acting according to that mission or that
[19:28] objective.
[19:30] And so Eleazar feeling the weight of the
[19:32] the request and now understanding. Look
[19:35] at God, excuse me, Abraham maybe in the
[19:38] the God view of him the one laying out
[19:40] the plan. And so then Ezer feeling the
[19:44] weight of that says in verse 5, "And the
[19:46] servant answered and said per adventure,
[19:48] what if, right? What if the woman will
[19:52] not be willing to follow me unto this
[19:54] land? What do I do if?" So he's this is
[19:56] very good. He's being proactive. He's
[19:58] kind of thinking through these the the
[20:00] order of things. I'm going to go all the
[20:01] way up there and I'm just going to be
[20:02] some strange guy that shows up and says,
[20:04] "Give me your wife or give me your
[20:05] daughter, rather. So give me give give
[20:07] me your daughter. I want to take her to
[20:08] be the wife of my master." at very
[20:10] different time. Maybe not as crazy as it
[20:12] sounds right now, but nonetheless, he
[20:14] recognized even then possibly some
[20:16] difficulty.
[20:18] &gt;&gt; So he says per adventure, and catch
[20:20] this, the woman will not be willing to
[20:23] follow me unto this land. Here's
[20:26] somebody that recognizes the objective,
[20:28] but then also his mission and the part
[20:30] that he plays because he's not saying
[20:32] follow Abraham
[20:34] &gt;&gt; and he's not saying uh follow her dad or
[20:37] follow her gut. She's saying, "What
[20:39] happens if me, having been sent by
[20:41] Abraham to find a wife for his son? What
[20:44] if the woman that I ask or these women I
[20:47] request of will not follow me
[20:50] &gt;&gt; to the son
[20:52] &gt;&gt; because he's the one that stands there
[20:54] having been sent
[20:55] &gt;&gt; to make to bring that introduction."
[20:59] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Must I," and I love this.
[21:02] Just I think very like think very
[21:04] spiritually with me right now. I love
[21:06] this.
[21:07] Must th I needs bring thy son again unto
[21:09] the land from whence thou camest?
[21:12] Now let me just wax uh
[21:16] wax third pull a little bit here. The
[21:19] coming of the Lord that many people are
[21:21] looking for is a coming which the son
[21:22] comes back out of necessity because the
[21:24] people need to receive him and it and
[21:26] it's that time that great triumphant
[21:28] time. But that's the third coming when
[21:30] he returns to earth with his bride.
[21:32] What's happening here is that taking and
[21:34] catching away of the bride where God is
[21:36] actually forecasting and typing early on
[21:39] in the life of Abraham that no, the son
[21:41] will not come and step earth on earth in
[21:44] Leodysa, but there will be a bride who
[21:47] is raised up and brought to meet Isaac.
[21:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[21:52] &gt;&gt; And they'll go into a tent. Glory.
[21:58] &gt;&gt; He says, "What do I need to bring them
[22:00] back?" So he has concerns about the
[22:02] failure of the admission or the
[22:03] objective. He knows this is a difficult
[22:04] ask. And immediately Abraham says in
[22:06] verse six, beware that thou bring not my
[22:10] son thither again. He can't break. He
[22:12] could say this is the composition. This
[22:14] is part of those shadows and types. So
[22:15] he doesn't want to break it because he's
[22:18] not going Jesus Christ in that second
[22:20] coming isn't going to come uh uh in the
[22:22] in his corporal body showing uh to the
[22:25] Gentiles in the way that uh he would
[22:27] reveal himself to the Jews. But he says,
[22:30] "Beware that you not bring them back.
[22:32] The Lord God of heaven, which took me
[22:34] from my father's house, and from the
[22:35] land of my kindred, which spake unto me,
[22:37] and that swear unto me, saying, Unto thy
[22:39] seed will I give this land. He shall
[22:42] send his angel before thee, and thou
[22:44] shalt take a wife unto my son from
[22:46] then." So notice the basis upon which he
[22:48] makes this request, that God, the Lord
[22:52] God of heaven,
[22:54] he's the same one that took me out of my
[22:56] father's house. He's the one that
[22:57] brought me to this place. He swore that
[23:00] he would give me this land.
[23:02] &gt;&gt; He says he'll send his angel before thee
[23:05] &gt;&gt; and thou shalt take a wife unto my son
[23:08] from fence.
[23:10] &gt;&gt; In verse eight, and if the woman will
[23:11] not be willing to follow thee, think
[23:14] about this in
[23:16] how Abraham is expressing this. I have a
[23:19] plan.
[23:20] I'm sending you according to that plan
[23:24] to bring a wife back for my son.
[23:27] Eleazar is asked what if she won't
[23:29] follow me? He says I'm going to be
[23:31] sending my angel before thee. And if the
[23:33] woman be not willing to follow thee,
[23:36] then thou shalt be clear from this thy
[23:38] oath. So here you have the composer. You
[23:40] have a performer of this composition.
[23:42] Now you have one who's also being
[23:44] brought in as a performer in this. He
[23:46] says, "But if she will not perform her
[23:48] part, you're going to be clear of of
[23:50] this oath, but don't bring my son
[23:53] there." As he says, "Not my son thither
[23:55] again." And the servant put his hand
[23:56] under the thigh of Abraham as master and
[23:58] swear to him concerning the matter. Now
[24:00] there's another performer.
[24:03] Abraham composed it. Now Elezer is
[24:05] clearly going to be conducting because
[24:08] now he's the one that has to go to the
[24:11] woman to get her to follow.
[24:15] And he's saying, "What? But what about
[24:17] there's the the woman? There's Abraham's
[24:20] will. Elear now following that will. And
[24:25] but what about the woman? She has a part
[24:28] in this performance."
[24:30] &gt;&gt; And he says that the same God that spoke
[24:32] to Abraham would lead the conductor and
[24:35] go before him. He says, I'm reading this
[24:37] verse here, he shall send his angel
[24:38] before thee. And so there's an angel
[24:41] going before Eleazar. And we can see
[24:43] this pattern in Abraham
[24:46] and as God is unfolding this in Abraham.
[24:48] And it's this pattern for all those who
[24:50] are called to follow the example of
[24:52] Jesus Christ because the Bible says he
[24:54] set for us an example that we should
[24:56] follow in his steps. Jesus Christ is
[24:59] being conducted according to the
[25:01] composition performing and finishing
[25:03] God's will. And that often time can be
[25:07] uh uh it we see Jesus Christ doing these
[25:10] things. things are like, well, yeah,
[25:11] that the harmony that existed between
[25:12] the father and the son. Jesus bypassed
[25:14] sinful birth. I mean, look at him, 12
[25:16] years old. He's confounding the scribes
[25:18] and the Pharisees, we know he did only
[25:20] that which pleased the father and he was
[25:22] perfect and sinless yet tempted in all
[25:24] points and manner like we were. And we
[25:26] could kind of carve out the Christ
[25:28] exception that we don't have to do it
[25:30] that way. So, we're looking at a a real
[25:32] world example where Abraham, a natural
[25:34] man with a natural son, has a vision and
[25:36] a plan, and he wants his son to marry a
[25:38] woman from a country that he came out
[25:40] of, and he tked a servant to go out and
[25:43] to be led by the spirit of God to get a
[25:46] bride for his son.
[25:48] &gt;&gt; And so, I believe that we can see even
[25:50] in Abraham and Eleazar and here as we're
[25:53] leading it, we're kind of speaking of
[25:55] this woman who's ultimately Rebecca, how
[25:58] God works in our lives. In Philippians
[26:01] chapter 2:13, Paul says, "For it is God
[26:03] which workketh in you, both to will and
[26:06] to do of his good pleasure." God in you
[26:11] conducting according to his composition.
[26:14] &gt;&gt; It's God in you to will, to compose, to
[26:16] plan, to structure, to arrange, and to
[26:19] place. But then not only to have these
[26:22] these words in your heart and these
[26:23] things in your heart and say, "Well,
[26:25] he's placed this in me. He's placed this
[26:26] in me. This is in me. The word is
[26:28] written in my heart. uh his law is
[26:29] written into my heart and his my sins
[26:31] and iniquity will he remember no more
[26:32] against me but but he's going to do of
[26:34] his what good pleasure which is his
[26:36] composition.
[26:38] So there's this. You say, "Well, who's
[26:40] the composer?" God.
[26:42] &gt;&gt; Who's the conductor? God. Who's the
[26:44] performer? Christ in you. God in you.
[26:46] The hope
[26:47] &gt;&gt; of glory.
[26:49] And in the image of
[26:53] in the image of uh Abraham in James
[26:56] chapter 2:es 21-22,
[26:59] James making this just remarkable
[27:02] observation. Was not Abraham our father
[27:04] justified by works when he had offered
[27:07] by offered Isaac his son upon the altar?
[27:11] What was Abraham doing in that instance?
[27:13] God told him to do it.
[27:15] &gt;&gt; Abraham was doing it.
[27:17] &gt;&gt; He's performing God's will.
[27:20] &gt;&gt; What is he being led by the promises of
[27:22] God? And then in that act and in that
[27:24] fulfilling, James is looking at it and
[27:26] saying, "Was not he justified
[27:29] by following and performing and doing
[27:33] God's will
[27:35] by faith?" We see this faith can seeest
[27:38] thou how faith wrought with his works,
[27:40] and by works was faith made perfect.
[27:44] &gt;&gt; So that perfect faith was manifested in
[27:47] that he performed according to what he
[27:50] believed. Well, it's that great miracle
[27:52] that we see now with Abraham when he's
[27:53] willing to offer up his son Isaac upon
[27:55] an altar. In other words, he's willing
[27:57] for his own son to face death. Whereas
[27:59] before, it was the fear of death that
[28:01] rattled him.
[28:03] &gt;&gt; He's afraid to die before these kings.
[28:05] So, he lied. And he didn't have enough
[28:07] faith in the promise to say, "How could
[28:08] I die since I don't have a son?
[28:10] &gt;&gt; It's impossible for me to die." He ought
[28:12] to have had that faith that Paul had
[28:14] that says, "I know he's called me to do
[28:15] this, and it looks like I'm going to
[28:17] die. So, I'm going to trust in a God not
[28:19] who'll preserve life, but in a God
[28:21] who'll raise up life because I've seen
[28:23] the composition and I know I'm being
[28:25] conducted and God's going to perform his
[28:28] will. And so, he's just going to have to
[28:30] raise me from the dead. And Abraham by
[28:32] now is so certain by the coming of that
[28:34] promised son. It's through that
[28:36] revelation of the son that he knew he
[28:38] could come. He came to that perfect
[28:40] faith to believe that death could not
[28:43] stop the promises of God. Amen.
[28:46] &gt;&gt; And so through that perfect faith, it
[28:49] was manifested in performing the will of
[28:52] God.
[28:54] &gt;&gt; So I want to ask the same question in a
[28:56] sense that what if the woman will not
[28:58] follow me?
[29:01] In other words, per adventure, the woman
[29:04] will not perform her part.
[29:08] And this is the great challenge of Jesus
[29:11] Christ.
[29:12] This is the the challenge of
[29:14] Christianity.
[29:15] In John chapter 10 27, we could say,
[29:18] "Whosoever believeth on me shall be
[29:20] saved." Okay, that's right. That's
[29:23] Bible.
[29:24] He says, "My sheep hear my voice and I
[29:26] know them and they follow me."
[29:30] This is where I go more chronologically.
[29:32] So, I made a mistake earlier. We'll
[29:34] print a retraction in the morning in
[29:37] Matthew chapter 4 18 to22. And Jesus
[29:39] walking by the Sea of Galilee. Let's
[29:41] just see how this plays out. My sheep
[29:43] hear my voice and they I know them and
[29:45] they follow me. Saw two brethren, Simon
[29:48] called Peter and Andrew his brother,
[29:50] cast in a net into the sea, for they
[29:51] were fishers. And he said to them,
[29:54] "Follow me and I will make you fishers
[29:57] of men."
[29:58] &gt;&gt; How come we don't ever call ourselves
[30:00] fishers?
[30:01] &gt;&gt; For the victor, I'm a fisher because I
[30:03] love to fish
[30:05] and I know why we're called fishers
[30:08] instead of catchers.
[30:10] But he says, "Follow me. I'll make you
[30:12] fishers of men." And they straightway
[30:14] left their nets and followed him. I know
[30:15] there's a lot more to this backstory and
[30:17] even being disciples of John, but notice
[30:19] how he says, "My sheep hear my voice."
[30:22] And though the Bible is maybe writing it
[30:24] in a way to where it leaves out certain
[30:26] details, it's not trying to mislead us,
[30:28] but it's showing us at least some
[30:30] reaction to the call that they leave
[30:33] their nets and follow him.
[30:35] &gt;&gt; Follow me. They follow him. Going on
[30:38] from then he saw other two brethren
[30:40] James the son son of Zebedee and his
[30:41] brother John his brother in a ship with
[30:43] Zebedee their father mending their nets
[30:45] and he called them and they immediately
[30:48] left the ship and their father
[30:51] see you dad and followed him.
[30:56] This is the this is the call. This is
[30:57] the challenge of Christ. Don't just hear
[31:00] my voice.
[31:02] &gt;&gt; Don't just claim to believe in me but
[31:04] follow me.
[31:06] Matthew 8 18 to22. Now when Jesus saw
[31:09] great multitudes about him, he gave
[31:10] commandment to depart to the other side.
[31:12] And a certain scribe came and said unto
[31:14] him, "Master, I will follow thee
[31:16] whethersoever thou goest." So he's
[31:18] willing to follow. Perhaps he'd been
[31:21] hearing this commandment, the voice of
[31:22] the this uh the shepherd saying, "Follow
[31:25] me. Follow me." Remember this is the
[31:27] question that Eleazar has. Per
[31:30] adventure, the woman will not follow me,
[31:32] your messenger.
[31:35] And he says, Jesus says, 'Well, the
[31:36] foxes have holes and the birds of the
[31:39] air have nests, but the son of man hath
[31:40] not where to lay his head. Why was he
[31:42] saying to this one who appeared so eager
[31:44] to follow me? He's saying, follow me,
[31:46] but it's not going to be easy.
[31:48] &gt;&gt; And it's when it gets difficult that
[31:49] people often express just how badly they
[31:52] wanted to do it or just how convinced
[31:55] they were. Do you want to do it? You
[31:56] want to do it? You want to do it? Yeah.
[31:57] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's going to
[31:58] cost you. It's right. whenever we've
[31:59] been offered a free lunch or go to this
[32:01] seminar and all you got to do is sit
[32:03] here and listen to our pitch for an hour
[32:05] and we'll give you $1,000 in six free
[32:07] nights a at a lodge that can only be
[32:10] accessed through our own personal
[32:11] private jet that you have to pay for the
[32:13] tickets. But you don't know that till
[32:14] you sat through the presentation and you
[32:15] think ah what is this going to this is
[32:17] nothing to just go and sit and then you
[32:18] do it once and you're like fool me once
[32:21] shame on shame on you fool me once can't
[32:23] fool me again why because though they're
[32:25] saying it's free it comes at a price so
[32:28] follow me you really want to follow me
[32:29] it's not going to be easy but yet it was
[32:32] saying follow me and another of his
[32:34] disciples said unto him Lord suffer me
[32:36] first to go and bury my father I want
[32:38] you to think of this in terms of why
[32:40] does the Bible lay this out there while
[32:41] there's some that want to do it and they
[32:43] think it's going to be easy and he's
[32:44] saying it's not going to be easy. Now
[32:45] there's one that's what has these orders
[32:47] of priority except for me first to go
[32:49] and bury my father.
[32:52] It's a lot. I mean I've been studying
[32:53] this in the past and some time ago
[32:56] realizing just how
[32:58] uh much of a so many layers of
[33:01] complexity to this.
[33:03] &gt;&gt; He says I'm going to go bury my father.
[33:05] And kind of what it speaks to and the
[33:06] different ways that you can look at it.
[33:08] And Jesus's answer is kind of abrasive
[33:10] but he says follow me. Let the dead bury
[33:13] the dead. They're dead. So, it's no
[33:15] matter how hard it is and no matter what
[33:17] order of priority, if you hear and you
[33:19] believe, he's saying, "Follow me." And
[33:20] that's the challenge.
[33:22] &gt;&gt; Well, I'll get back to you. I need to go
[33:23] bury my father. Or, well, you know, are
[33:26] we going to be staying at Hilton
[33:27] Properties because that's where I get my
[33:29] points. Don't put me in a Marriott, man.
[33:30] And Jesus saying, hey, you know,
[33:31] sometimes we're going to have to lay on
[33:32] a stone. You know, sometimes we're not
[33:35] going to have a nice place to stay. We
[33:36] might be in Marriott's all over the
[33:37] place and you have to wait till you get
[33:39] to the millennium or heaven is sleep in
[33:41] a Hilton. Glory
[33:44] and and so there's ways that you got to
[33:47] wrestle this out. John chapter 1 43 it
[33:50] says the day following Jesus would go
[33:52] forth into Galilee and findeth Philillip
[33:53] and saith to him follow me.
[33:56] Follow me. That sounds like one words I
[33:58] want you wonder you know follow me.
[34:00] Remember the first job one of the first
[34:02] jobs I ever got I was doing. Have I ever
[34:04] shared this? If I have finished the
[34:05] sentence for me, I was doing
[34:06] telemarketing for
[34:09] concerned women for America. That was
[34:10] what it was. And I would say, "Hi, this
[34:12] is Aaron McGear with Concerned Women for
[34:14] America. Could you please hold for a
[34:15] message from our founder, Beverly Lee?"
[34:17] And this guy who was training me was
[34:18] like, "Were you in the Air Force?" And
[34:20] I'm like, "No. Oh, why do you ask?" He
[34:22] goes, "You keep saying Airman McGee."
[34:24] And I'm like, "No, no, no, no. Not an
[34:25] airman. What an odd way to announce
[34:27] myself." Yes, I'm Airman McGiri.
[34:30] It was Aaron McGiri. So here it's not
[34:32] airman McGear, it's follow me. He's
[34:34] saying follow me. So what he says to
[34:37] Philillip, follow me. Notice how this
[34:40] it's not just believe me or kind of hear
[34:42] me out for a moment. Let us banter back
[34:43] and forth. But there's this invitation.
[34:45] Think of this abandonment.
[34:48] Follow me.
[34:50] &gt;&gt; You got to leave your nets. Leave your
[34:52] father. Don't bury the dead.
[34:55] Don't don't worry. You know, know what
[34:57] you're getting into, but don't be
[34:58] looking for something easy. Follow me.
[35:01] Matthew chapter 9:9. As he passed from
[35:04] from then, he saw a man named Matthew.
[35:05] In the other readings, it's Levi sitting
[35:07] at the receipt of custom. And he said
[35:08] unto him, follow me. And what happened?
[35:10] He arose and followed him. Notice that
[35:14] in this his image, I want you to see
[35:15] this image. Immediately they left the
[35:17] ship. Straightway they left their nets
[35:18] and followed him. He arose and followed
[35:20] him. You read the scriptures of the next
[35:22] few days. As you come uh expecting
[35:24] Sunday morning, notice this impact of
[35:26] follow me. He arises and follows him.
[35:32] In Mark 10 21, Jesus beholding him. Now
[35:35] we're looking at this rich young ruler
[35:36] who came inquiring of eternal life. And
[35:38] one thing thou lackest. Go thy way. Sell
[35:41] whatsoever thou hast and give to the
[35:43] poor and thou shalt have treasure in
[35:45] heaven. And it doesn't end there. And
[35:47] come take up thy cross and follow me.
[35:51] &gt;&gt; Surely we could say in some ways that
[35:53] the cross would be that burden of
[35:55] following. The foxes have holes and the
[35:57] birds they have of the air have nests,
[35:59] but I have no place to lay my head.
[36:00] There's going to be persecution. There's
[36:01] going to be rejection. This isn't going
[36:02] to be broadly accepted. So, there is a
[36:04] cross and even a death that you may have
[36:06] to suffer to follow. But, nonetheless,
[36:09] even eyes wide open, follow me.
[36:14] Jesus apprised his disciples of the
[36:16] troubles to follow. I'm going to send
[36:17] you a sheep into the midst of wolves.
[36:20] Men are going to speak evil of you.
[36:21] Don't be surprised if they hate you. And
[36:24] and he was saying all this and what's it
[36:26] doing? Testing their resolve whether or
[36:27] not they would follow him.
[36:29] &gt;&gt; Just as in that moment he was now
[36:31] arrested and being hauled off. What
[36:32] happened? The the disciples bailed.
[36:37] &gt;&gt; In Matthew chapter 16 24 Jesus following
[36:41] up even on this very example. He says to
[36:43] his disciples, "If any man will come
[36:45] after me, let him deny himself, take up
[36:47] his cross, and follow me." We've covered
[36:51] this self-denial this year. Matthew
[36:52] chapter 19 21. And Jesus said unto him,
[36:54] "If thou wilt be perfect,
[36:57] go and sell that thou hast and give to
[37:00] the poor." You want to know why we're
[37:02] not perfect? Who's willing to sell?
[37:05] Who's willing to give? If you will be
[37:07] perfect, go sell what you have, give to
[37:09] the poor, and thou shalt have treasure
[37:11] in heaven. And come and follow me. He's
[37:16] saying over and over and over again,
[37:18] come follow me.
[37:21] This is Christ now. And if I could maybe
[37:25] just put it in the image of God being
[37:26] the composer, Christ being conducted,
[37:29] but now Christ becomes one who's
[37:31] conducting. And he's calling out and
[37:33] he's signaling. He's saying, "Follow my
[37:35] lead. Follow me. Do as I do. Such as
[37:37] I've done unto you, do unto one
[37:38] another." He's giving them an example.
[37:40] And he's showing them the heart of the
[37:42] father. He's revealing and interpreting
[37:44] the composition. He has this refrain
[37:47] over and over again. And I know that
[37:48] there's other verses and there's a
[37:50] repetition through the four gospels of
[37:52] these instances. Follow me. Follow me.
[37:54] Follow me. Follow me. John chapter 1
[37:57] verses 43-50. Now there's a little bit
[37:59] of a change here and I want you to catch
[38:00] something.
[38:02] The day following Jesus would go forth
[38:04] into Galilee and find Philillip and
[38:06] saith unto him follow me. We read that
[38:08] just a moment ago. Now Philip was of
[38:10] Bethadia, the city of Andrew and Peter.
[38:13] Philip finding Nathaniel and said unto
[38:16] him, "We have found him of who Moses in
[38:18] the law and the prophets did write." So
[38:20] this would be Deuteronomy 18. Jesus of
[38:22] Nazareth, the son of Joseph.
[38:26] What's happened here? God who wrote
[38:28] through the mouths of the prophets who
[38:31] had composed it in the law of Moses and
[38:33] gave these commandments
[38:36] has now sent his son Jesus Christ who
[38:39] has been conducted according to that
[38:40] composition and one witnesses the
[38:42] performance and the performance says
[38:44] follow me
[38:46] and now that he's following he goes and
[38:49] he finds Nathaniel
[38:52] and he says we have found the Messiah
[38:54] and Nathaniel says unto him can there
[38:57] can there any good thing come out of
[38:58] Nazareth.
[39:00] &gt;&gt; And we're all like, I want to read the
[39:01] Wikipedia on Nazareth. This is a pretty
[39:03] bad reputation.
[39:05] &gt;&gt; And Philip saith unto him, come and see.
[39:10] &gt;&gt; You notice notice how he's seeing this.
[39:13] He's thinking, I was told to follow and
[39:16] I followed. And so he's he's not going
[39:19] to do his own composition.
[39:21] He's not going to do his own song and
[39:22] dance there before Nathaniel and try to
[39:24] impress him and says, "All right, all
[39:25] right. Um, think of a number. Think of a
[39:26] number. Yeah, think of a number. I'm
[39:27] going to do what he's been doing. 17.
[39:30] And Nathaniel's like, "No." Uhuh. Not
[39:31] even close. I'm sorry. I meant to say
[39:32] between 1 and 20. There's a He's not
[39:35] going to try to do a gimmick. He's not
[39:36] going to try to blow his friend over. He
[39:37] says, "Come and see."
[39:40] &gt;&gt; There's even an element now where
[39:41] Nathaniel has to follow him.
[39:45] You following me?
[39:47] &gt;&gt; Follow him to come to Christ.
[39:49] And so as they're coming to Jesus in
[39:51] verse 47, it says, "Nathaniel coming to
[39:54] Jesus saw him and said, "Behold, an
[39:56] Israelite indeed in whom is no guile. I
[39:58] really want you to think deep about
[40:00] this." And I may have been forecasting
[40:02] this and signaling this a little bit,
[40:03] but what I've been studying may may be
[40:05] put off to next year on this particular
[40:06] way, but Deuteronomy 18 is very clear
[40:10] about people who read your mind. But
[40:12] yeah, the very one who fulfills
[40:14] Deuteronomy 18 is reading people's
[40:16] minds.
[40:17] &gt;&gt; That blows my mind. figuratively.
[40:20] So now he's reading his mind. He's
[40:22] discerning or he's knowing things about
[40:23] him. He seems to be somewhat of a a
[40:26] sorcerer. Behold, an Israelite in whom
[40:27] there's no guile. And Nathaniel said
[40:29] unto him, "Whence knowest thou me?"
[40:30] Jesus answered and said, "Before that
[40:32] Philip called thee when thou was under
[40:34] the fig tree, I saw thee." You don't
[40:36] have to give a show of hands, but how
[40:38] many have seen some of the episodes of
[40:40] Chosen? How many have been watched,
[40:42] binge watched it, waited till is it in
[40:43] the final season? I don't know. We know
[40:45] how the story ends, right?
[40:48] But I do remember one of the episodes in
[40:51] this particular example. I liked it
[40:54] &gt;&gt; because it added more depth to what
[40:55] Nathaniel's going through under the fig
[40:57] tree. We just think he's sitting there
[40:58] eating figs, right? Taking a nap. He's
[41:00] lazy. He's doom scrolling, right? And
[41:03] yet he's there wrestling things out.
[41:05] It's agonizing. It's a it's a moment for
[41:08] him that when the Messiah says, "I saw
[41:10] you." That means something to him
[41:11] because perhaps I can't remember this
[41:13] was this is five seasons ago. He he's
[41:16] there's this idea in his mind of
[41:17] something he's wrestling with and this
[41:19] pining and this desire and the fact that
[41:21] God saw him then
[41:23] &gt;&gt; it meant something to him.
[41:25] &gt;&gt; That's the way God works. And if you're
[41:27] trying to you're looking through your
[41:28] life and trying to find God, he might be
[41:31] in the very darkest moment.
[41:33] &gt;&gt; And that's when he can say, "I saw you
[41:35] there." And that's what this is about is
[41:37] I'm speaking to you now in such a way to
[41:39] say, "I saw you there." You go. Then in
[41:42] my sin, in my unbelief, in my
[41:44] disobedience, in my rebellion, in my
[41:46] worst mistake, and this thing I've been
[41:47] trying to outrun for years and I'm
[41:49] haunted by, he says, "I saw you then."
[41:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:53] &gt;&gt; And have somebody knock on your door and
[41:55] tell you, "God's not true."
[41:57] &gt;&gt; You said, "How do you know he's real?"
[41:58] The worst thing in the world happened to
[42:00] me. This girl I was courting called me
[42:03] and said the best thing that had ever
[42:04] happened to her before to God her was
[42:06] her feelings for me went away. But in
[42:08] there you see and feel the love of God
[42:10] and know that he's with you. I'm still
[42:12] healing.
[42:15] But before Philip called thee, when you
[42:17] were under the fig tree, I saw thee. And
[42:19] this response, so just think about it.
[42:22] This response, Nathaniel answered and
[42:24] said unto him, Rabbi, thou art the son
[42:27] of God. Thou art the king of Israel.
[42:30] What?
[42:31] That must have been something powerful.
[42:34] &gt;&gt; And how did it happen? Jesus called
[42:37] Philillip heard
[42:39] Philillip
[42:41] being conducted
[42:43] finds Nathaniel
[42:45] and he doesn't try to he doesn't try to
[42:47] do anything other than come and see the
[42:49] performer
[42:51] &gt;&gt; come and see the one
[42:53] &gt;&gt; and there
[42:55] he does something he shows something
[42:57] that reaches the heart of Nathaniel and
[43:00] his response is you are the Messiah thou
[43:03] art the king of Israel and I love
[43:05] Jesus's response. There's a great depth
[43:06] here. He says unto him, because I said
[43:10] unto thee, I saw thee under the fig
[43:11] tree, you believe.
[43:14] Isn't that amazing?
[43:16] And because he believed, he says, thou
[43:18] shalt see greater things than these.
[43:21] &gt;&gt; When you believe the voice behind the
[43:23] sign, you see greater things.
[43:26] &gt;&gt; This is what he's saying that come come
[43:29] and see. And exactly what Philip uh
[43:32] believed for happens because Nathaniel
[43:34] sees and when he sees his heart is
[43:36] opened up and he confesses faith and
[43:38] Jesus says you believe and having
[43:41] believed you will see greater things
[43:43] than these. Listen, if you shove aside
[43:46] God's manifestation and God's
[43:49] performance, if you shove aside the
[43:50] voice of Christ because you want to see
[43:52] greater things, you'll never see greater
[43:54] things because the foolish feed on
[43:56] foolishness. And the scorner will seek
[43:58] for truth and never find it. You've got
[44:01] could only see the greater things. You
[44:02] can only come to know God in greater
[44:04] ways when you receive the simple ways
[44:07] he's trying to make himself known.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; Come follow me.
[44:14] I want you to catch this element.
[44:17] It's very, very simple.
[44:20] Has such simplicity. I want to leave it
[44:21] with you as we'll try to close here in
[44:23] just a few moments.
[44:25] God is the composer.
[44:28] We speak of his will, his word, his
[44:30] plan, his predestinated plan, the plan
[44:32] of redemption. He's composed his will.
[44:35] It's played out. It's acted out. We read
[44:37] of it in the scripture.
[44:40] Though God has composed it written in
[44:42] his heart or in his mind, written in the
[44:43] sky and writes it out in the Bible. We
[44:45] all have all these different ways that
[44:47] we can say it, there must be a
[44:49] conductor.
[44:51] &gt;&gt; God did not just take the Bible and even
[44:54] in the sense where he just kind of left
[44:56] the script laying around in the days of
[44:58] Noah. And what's been happening ever
[45:00] since is Nimrod said, "Oh, that's what I
[45:02] need to be doing." People read say,
[45:04] "Well, I guess we need to build a
[45:05] tower." Uh that's not how it unfolds.
[45:10] God writes it and then there's
[45:12] leadership.
[45:14] There's a conducting
[45:17] and he uses an agency to collaborate
[45:19] with the performer.
[45:23] And what we're seeing already is that
[45:24] the performer can become another
[45:25] conductor
[45:27] where he's transferring energy to
[45:30] another who God has ordained to be a
[45:32] part of what the symphony, the
[45:35] composition.
[45:37] Follow me.
[45:40] When Jesus was saying follow me, it was
[45:42] the conductor who's acting according to
[45:45] the composition
[45:47] compelling disciples
[45:50] follow me.
[45:52] I I I have been mentioning this a lot.
[45:54] If it is just repetition, I hope that
[45:56] it's done in such a way to where it's
[45:58] still meaningful to you. But the hand
[46:00] signals and the movements that a
[46:02] conductor gives an orchestra, they're to
[46:05] follow that lead in that cue,
[46:08] &gt;&gt; is done for a purpose. So now the
[46:10] conductor knowing the composition,
[46:13] knowing what's coming, is compelling his
[46:15] disciples, follow me.
[46:18] And then the disciples had to have
[46:21] faith.
[46:22] Stay with me here.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; They had to have faith that they were
[46:26] being led by God's conductor
[46:29] according to the true composition.
[46:34] &gt;&gt; And each one of these instances, they're
[46:36] going to be tried on it. Follow me.
[46:38] Philip's going to follow. Peter, follow
[46:39] me. Andrew, follow me. Nathaniel, follow
[46:41] me. And Levi, follow me. And all these,
[46:43] follow me. At some point, they're going
[46:45] to have to have that faith that what
[46:47] they were following was the leadership
[46:50] of God
[46:52] &gt;&gt; in the Messiah as it was promised.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; They had to have faith that they were
[46:57] being led,
[47:00] conducted, following the signals of
[47:02] God's chosen vessel and that it was
[47:05] according to God's word.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; Likewise, we have to have that kind of
[47:10] faith. Amen.
[47:12] &gt;&gt; There's a tremendous
[47:14] I really do want to be very careful how
[47:16] I say this,
[47:18] but uh
[47:21] there's I mean I know there's always
[47:22] these different sides in these different
[47:24] ditches that we can find ourselves in,
[47:26] but humanly
[47:28] we want to find a way and I think it's a
[47:30] very Catholic proposition. We want to be
[47:32] able to have somebody tell us that go
[47:36] light a candle and your sins are
[47:37] forgiven. We want to be able to
[47:39] say,"Well, I I've done this. I've gone
[47:41] on my mission. I've prayed these
[47:42] prayers. I've done all these things. I'm
[47:44] going to make it." We find our comfort
[47:45] in those kind of structures that give us
[47:48] some assurance of our eternal destiny.
[47:52] And there's a a level how this works
[47:54] even in some um churches that claim to
[47:56] follow Brother Brandham where there's a
[47:58] lot of emphasis on just believe God sent
[48:01] a prophet or just play the tapes.
[48:03] Whatever is said on those tapes, thus
[48:05] sayith the Lord, and you can believe
[48:06] that and you can just rest. A and that's
[48:09] that's you know that's where God is.
[48:10] Listen, that comes from weakness.
[48:17] &gt;&gt; It's a weakness
[48:19] &gt;&gt; because they want to take all the
[48:21] accountability of the leadership of God
[48:23] in their lives and say, "Oh, God's
[48:25] already God's already thought it and
[48:27] spoke it. That settles it."
[48:30] &gt;&gt; And and this is this is all that we can
[48:32] do is just acknowledge that he was the
[48:34] one. He was the one. He is the one. And
[48:36] now there's no responsibility on their
[48:38] part to perform
[48:41] &gt;&gt; according to the word that's been given.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; And so it comes from weakness and
[48:45] insecurity to prop up anything visible
[48:48] and carnal as a substitute for Holy
[48:52] Ghost leadership to do God's will.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; We have to have faith.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; That we're being led.
[49:02] I trust that the the true nature of what
[49:05] I'm trying to express there can be
[49:06] caught as God would do so allow you to
[49:08] do so. Let me use this scripture from
[49:11] John chapter 6 verse 66 as we referenced
[49:13] it Sunday. Jesus doubling down. Many of
[49:17] his disciples were offended and they
[49:20] said, "Oh, I can't believe he says this.
[49:22] I can't believe he's saying this." A and
[49:25] Jesus rises up and one of the disciples
[49:27] says, "He's probably going to
[49:29] apologize." And Peter said, "Let him
[49:30] cook."
[49:32] And what did he say? "Oh, you think that
[49:34] offends you? That you think that's
[49:35] offensive?
[49:37] Let me cook." And what do you leaned
[49:39] into it?
[49:41] &gt;&gt; And when that happened, it says, "Many
[49:42] of his disciples went back and walked no
[49:44] more no more with him." Then Jesus said
[49:47] unto the 12, "You were following me and
[49:51] they were following me and I said, "Come
[49:52] to me and come follow me." And we had
[49:54] this kind of this good thing going. And
[49:56] there's been there was a lot of us just
[49:57] yesterday, thousands of people in our
[49:59] meeting. Now all these walk away and now
[50:02] he's talking to the 12 and he says,
[50:05] "Would you stop following me?"
[50:07] And here's Peter's magnumopus.
[50:11] He says, "Lord, to whom shall we go?"
[50:13] &gt;&gt; Who else are we going to follow?
[50:16] There was one thing he knew for sure is
[50:20] the blind lead the blind.
[50:23] And who could he walk away from? And who
[50:25] would he be fallen if he walked away?
[50:29] &gt;&gt; Thou hast the words of eternal life, and
[50:31] we believe and are sure that thou art
[50:32] that Christ, the son of the living God.
[50:34] I am determined to follow you.
[50:39] I am, we're not quite there yet. I am
[50:41] determined to follow you all the way.
[50:45] &gt;&gt; We know we I I am certain. You said
[50:49] follow me. I've been following. This is
[50:51] my life now.
[50:54] and everything's burning, Peter. The
[50:56] house is burning. He said, 'I'm fine.
[50:59] I'm gonna stay right here because I know
[51:02] thou are with me.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; I want to use this as my final scripture
[51:06] in John chapter 21
[51:08] verses 15 to 22.
[51:11] This is Jesus after his resurrection be
[51:14] uh before he ascends as we read in other
[51:17] places in the Bible. He says, "So when
[51:19] they had died, Jesus saith to Simon
[51:21] Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou
[51:24] me more than these."
[51:27] And he saith unto him, "Yay, Lord,
[51:30] thou knowest that I love thee." There
[51:31] was a tenderness to Peter by this point,
[51:33] I believe.
[51:35] Jesus says, "Feed my lambs." So there's
[51:38] this granting this opportunity to Peter
[51:41] to affirm his love. I love the symmetry
[51:43] of he denies him three times and he's
[51:44] given an opportunity three times to
[51:46] affirm his love. And each time Christ
[51:50] affirms a commandment,
[51:52] feed my lambs. He said to him again the
[51:54] second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest
[51:56] thou me? I imagine perhaps it didn't
[51:59] happen one after another. He saith unto
[52:01] him, Yay Lord, thou knowest that I love
[52:03] thee. He saith unto him, feed my sheep.
[52:06] Peter is feverishly scribbling down with
[52:08] some charcoal on a tablet, remember to
[52:11] feed the sheep, feed the lambs. He saith
[52:13] unto him a third time, Simon, son of
[52:15] Jonas, lovest thou me? It pricks Peter's
[52:17] heart. And he's grieved because he said
[52:18] unto him a third time, lovest thou me?
[52:20] And he said to him, Lord, thou knowest
[52:22] all things. Thou knowest
[52:25] &gt;&gt; that I love thee.
[52:29] I knew somehow in my heart, thou art the
[52:31] Christ of the Son of the living God. You
[52:33] told me flesh and blood did not reveal
[52:35] this to me, but your father which is in
[52:37] heaven. My father which is in heaven
[52:38] hath revealed this to me. When everybody
[52:40] else walked away, I said I where else
[52:42] would I go? You alone have the words of
[52:45] eternal life. I thought I was willing to
[52:46] run with you into death and then I was
[52:48] exposed as a fraud. But yet you came to
[52:50] me in my brokenness in my darkness and
[52:53] in my great need and you made yourself
[52:55] known to me. Lord, you know all things.
[52:58] He says, "Feed my sheep." And then Jesus
[53:01] says this in verse 18 very beautifully.
[53:03] When thou were young, you gerted
[53:05] yourself. You dressed yourself. You
[53:06] walked wherever you wanted to walk. But
[53:08] when you get old, you'll stretch forth
[53:11] your hands. And another will clothe you
[53:14] and carry where you could not go. Notice
[53:17] the leadership now at the end of his
[53:18] life. When you were young, Peter, you
[53:20] were headstrong. You were so c certain
[53:22] and sure.
[53:24] Uh you you were going to do all these
[53:26] things. I know you're thinking about
[53:27] Peter and the chosen right now. The guy
[53:29] in the tank top. Maybe they were all in
[53:31] tank tops. The guy with muscles.
[53:33] Guy with the nice hair. The one who's
[53:36] got a marriage that's on the rocks. It
[53:38] looks like at times
[53:40] he's the one. He's saying, "You were so
[53:42] headstrong and sure of yourself, but now
[53:45] when you get older, another's going to
[53:47] carry you."
[53:49] &gt;&gt; It says he's signifying the death that
[53:51] he would die in his own crucifixion and
[53:53] how he would glorify God. And then he
[53:56] speaks this. He's kind of told him where
[53:58] he's been in this moment. You love me.
[53:59] You feed my sheep. And then Jesus says
[54:02] unto him, "Follow me."
[54:05] Isn't that odd? He'd already asked him
[54:08] to follow him. Been a few years now. He
[54:11] had walked with them. He'd drawn the
[54:13] sword for him. He had denied him. He'd
[54:15] witness him in the resurrection. He's
[54:16] spending these days with them. He's
[54:17] affirmed his love. He knows all things.
[54:19] Now he's telling him that he's going to
[54:21] the manner of death he's going to
[54:22] suffer. And he says, "Follow me."
[54:26] because that's the important part.
[54:29] God has a composition
[54:31] and it's conduct being conducted
[54:34] and you're the one being conducted. I
[54:36] think this fits a lot with what we
[54:37] preached on. It's in your moment that
[54:39] there's this sense that we have to
[54:41] follow the leader.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; Was a working title I had earlier this
[54:45] week is follow the leader. There's got
[54:46] to be some way that we see this is God's
[54:49] word, God leading. I'm the one that's
[54:51] performing. I want this word to be
[54:53] performed. Amen.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; And please focus with me in this closing
[54:57] remarks. Then Peter turning about seeth
[55:00] the disciple whom Jesus loved following.
[55:03] So John following follow me. And John
[55:06] Pet John Peter sees John following. And
[55:08] so there still was a little that Peter
[55:10] was still in there and he goes which
[55:12] also lean on the breast at supper. And
[55:14] of course John's writing this and said
[55:16] Lord which is he that betrayeth thee and
[55:18] surprised he didn't say was leaning on
[55:19] his bosom. And Jesus whispered sweetly
[55:21] into his ear and trusted him above
[55:23] everybody else.
[55:24] But then in verse 21, Peter seeth him,
[55:26] saith to Jesus, listen, please focus on
[55:28] this, Lord, what shall this man do?
[55:33] He was worried in this moment, for some
[55:35] reason, he's worried about this man.
[55:36] You've told me this this prophecy, maybe
[55:40] this riddle
[55:42] that when I was young, I was headstrong
[55:43] and I clothed myself and I walked in my
[55:45] own strength, but when I get old,
[55:47] another is going to dress me and carry
[55:49] me when I couldn't. signifying that and
[55:50] maybe he sensed this is me in my old age
[55:52] or in my death and now he's worried
[55:54] about well what about this guy he's
[55:56] following you what about him and Jesus
[55:59] make says these words that I think that
[56:00] all of us should take into consideration
[56:02] at this very moment if I will if I will
[56:05] that he tried till I come
[56:08] what is that to you
[56:11] &gt;&gt; what is that to you
[56:14] follow thou me
[56:18] &gt;&gt; I want you to Take this to heart. What
[56:20] about this guy? What is that to you?
[56:23] &gt;&gt; Follow me. What about that group? What
[56:27] is that to you? Follow me.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; Should I follow them? No. Follow me.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; What about this decision? What is that
[56:35] to you? Follow me.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. If John was following Jesus, he
[56:39] had to follow in his own relationship
[56:42] his own inspiration in his own
[56:44] leadership being conducted by what he
[56:47] believed to be the conductor performing
[56:49] the will of the one that composed the
[56:51] will for his life. And Jesus say don't
[56:53] get distracted about everybody else's
[56:55] wills, everybody else's desires,
[56:57] everybody else's decisions. What is that
[56:59] to you? In other words, he's saying that
[57:00] shouldn't mean anything to you when it
[57:02] comes to what you need to do. The most
[57:04] important thing for you to do is follow
[57:06] me.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; And I say that to you tonight, each one
[57:10] of you. I say it as a a messenger of
[57:12] God. I say it as a servant of God. I say
[57:15] it in the same sense that Jesus meant
[57:16] it. What is that to you?
[57:20] &gt;&gt; Follow Christ.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:23] &gt;&gt; Follow him.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; Because God wrote this word.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; His holy spirit is conducting it.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. and he will perform
[57:34] that which he began in you.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; Now, we we read it on Sunday. Just and
[57:38] faithful is he. He's begun this work and
[57:41] he will perform it. He will finish it.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; Because it's Christ in you, the hope of
[57:45] glory. It is God both in you. Not only
[57:48] to will, to desire, to believe, to
[57:51] inspire you, but to actually do it.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:58] I hope that you can be excited about the
[57:59] things of God.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; And not let the devil distract us. We
[58:03] say, "But but what about
[58:06] &gt;&gt; what about brother Mitch? He's making a
[58:08] million dollars now and he's able to go
[58:11] on an elk hunt and I didn't get to draw
[58:12] and what about these guys? They get to
[58:14] do this and these guys get You're all
[58:15] thinking about Brother Mitch is making a
[58:17] million dollars now. I I got to keep you
[58:18] on your toes. He's the one getting the
[58:21] Bitcoin in his wallet on Mondays."
[58:24] There's a I want you to think of this in
[58:26] the sense that
[58:28] there's a lot of things that can
[58:29] distract us.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; And it's not being dismissive of your
[58:33] brother, but he's wanting you to think,
[58:34] what is that to you?
[58:36] &gt;&gt; Does that change my commandment to feed
[58:37] my sheep?
[58:39] Is is that going to change whether or
[58:41] not you follow me? Are you going to get
[58:42] your eyes on John or will you follow me?
[58:45] &gt;&gt; Let's follow him.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; Let's go all the way. Let's follow him.
[58:49] If we could stand together, musicians
[58:51] coming to your instruments,
[58:54] if we could pray together tonight.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Rowan, for getting me
[58:59] through this.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; Will you follow him?
[59:06] &gt;&gt; Are you purposing your heart tonight to
[59:08] keep your eyes on him?
[59:11] &gt;&gt; He's the one that wrote it. He's the one
[59:13] that's leading it. And the Holy Spirit's
[59:16] wanting to work closely together with
[59:18] you, right? Collaborate,
[59:21] work with you to perform it. Our
[59:23] gracious heavenly father, tonight as we
[59:25] close this service, as we'll soon be
[59:27] dismissed,
[59:29] we're looking to you now as our heavenly
[59:31] father to continue to make your will
[59:34] plain to us
[59:37] that we could better understand the
[59:38] composition.
[59:40] We're taught in the message of the hour
[59:41] that if we're to know your will that we
[59:44] need to check it with the word is there
[59:47] anything in this composition that
[59:50] tells me what the key is that tells me
[59:52] what the tempo is that gives me some
[59:54] sort of signal of what the highest note
[59:56] is and what the lowest one that key note
[59:58] the lowest tone is going to be and how
[1:00:00] is this arranged and therefore we can
[1:00:03] look into the composition the word
[1:00:06] then ask that great comforter that Jesus
[1:00:08] said was to come that conductor the Holy
[1:00:10] Spirit
[1:00:12] and say, "Lord, is am I reading this
[1:00:14] right? Can you leading me according to
[1:00:16] this?"
[1:00:18] So help us, Father, to be
[1:00:22] composed,
[1:00:24] conducted,
[1:00:26] and your word be performed.
[1:00:30] For your will has been written
[1:00:31] beforehand. It was written
[1:00:33] in the heavens. It was through the
[1:00:36] stars. It's written in your word through
[1:00:38] the Bible through record of acts and
[1:00:41] events and then also prophecy and
[1:00:43] foreshadowing and types.
[1:00:47] Lord, it's in your heart, your very
[1:00:48] mind, which is a blueprint which is real
[1:00:51] and eternal.
[1:00:53] And as your Holy Spirit leads,
[1:00:57] may we, Lord, rejoice when another says
[1:00:59] they're feeling led, as hard as it may
[1:01:01] be, let us rejoice when another feels
[1:01:03] like they're finding leadership.
[1:01:07] Lord, it's been difficult as a young
[1:01:08] church when we
[1:01:11] experience families moving in and
[1:01:14] they're with us and wonderful families
[1:01:16] and beautiful children and such great
[1:01:18] many things to offer. And then Lord, you
[1:01:21] lead them to move maybe back home or to
[1:01:24] a different situation. And surely, Lord,
[1:01:26] there's a there's a part in our hearts
[1:01:28] that aches and hurts. But Lord, we
[1:01:32] rejoice in that
[1:01:34] because they're following you.
[1:01:38] [Music]
[1:01:39] Lord, our prayer would be as they follow
[1:01:41] you, they would be in that vein of
[1:01:43] Phillip. Come and see, not see Arizona
[1:01:46] Believers Church, but the one who's
[1:01:48] leading me, Christ.
[1:01:52] Lord, may may we even understand better
[1:01:54] the dynamics of how that you having
[1:01:56] written your word
[1:01:59] and this unseen conductor of the Holy
[1:02:01] Spirit still uses this agency of men who
[1:02:04] are performing your will
[1:02:07] and that the performer is often saying
[1:02:09] will you follow
[1:02:12] May we take some time over the next few
[1:02:14] days to pray about Rebecca's
[1:02:16] song in the scripture
[1:02:19] the decision that she faced
[1:02:23] As the will had been composed,
[1:02:29] the angel was going before conducting.
[1:02:32] And Eleazar stood there performing
[1:02:34] according to his your will, God's will,
[1:02:36] the father's will, Abraham's will.
[1:02:39] What was in Rebecca's heart as she's
[1:02:41] witnessing this performance.
[1:02:44] Lord, we choose right now to follow you.
[1:02:47] My prayer for my children, Lord, if
[1:02:48] they're listening in a special way that
[1:02:50] they would say, "Lord, I want to follow
[1:02:51] you."
[1:02:53] May be sensitive to your presence and
[1:02:57] your leadership in our lives. I ask all
[1:02:59] this in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:03:00] Christ.
[1:03:02] Amen.
