[0:00] there's just so much to to say about
[0:02] that and and I just pray that God is
[0:04] allow will allow us to hit that just for
[0:07] a little bit but it says that he was the
[0:11] expressed
[0:13] image and I know brother brandham he's
[0:15] preached many
[0:17] messages on on that he's preached the
[0:20] unveiling of God Christ is the mystery
[0:22] of God revealed and many other messages
[0:25] where you can look how God would Express
[0:28] himself through certain things but the
[0:31] ultimate was this man Christ Jesus and
[0:36] once he came after all of that after him
[0:39] he would Express himself differently
[0:41] than he would in the Old
[0:44] Testament but my my title today and it
[0:47] sounds very strange because it almost
[0:50] doesn't sound like it's uh connected
[0:52] with this scripture but it is power
[0:55] without
[0:56] character and and Jesus was the
[0:59] expressed image and that Greek word is
[1:04] character he was the character of the
[1:07] person of God the Bible says that there
[1:10] was no beauty that we should desire of
[1:13] him so whenever we see image we think of
[1:16] a person we see oh man God is about to
[1:19] express himself like the Jews thought so
[1:22] he's like oh they might he's going to
[1:23] come down in a fiery Chariot Chariot
[1:25] he's going to come down with all of his
[1:27] his host of angels and he's going to
[1:30] express his Beauty Express his greatness
[1:33] and when God's like okay I'm going to
[1:35] express myself it was a stoop shoulder
[1:38] little
[1:39] man so he wasn't expressing a physical
[1:43] he was expressing
[1:45] character he was expressing values
[1:49] principles and we call it as message
[1:51] Believers the
[1:53] word we he was expressing his own word
[1:58] to us right
[2:01] now this title that I uh that I come
[2:04] came up with power without character
[2:06] it's from the exposition of the seven uh
[2:08] Church ages the Samaran Church age
[2:11] brother brandham he says unless we
[2:14] suffer with him we cannot reign with him
[2:18] now I I don't want you guys to be just
[2:20] kind of in a narrow thinking of okay man
[2:22] I've got I'm I'm going to be suffering
[2:25] but in suffering there's many things in
[2:28] that suffering our suffering could be in
[2:31] little tiny things in our job in in
[2:34] household in sickness or whatever it
[2:37] might be but in those little tiny
[2:40] intricacies of our suffering there is
[2:43] temptations there is little things
[2:46] there's
[2:47] opportunities there there's a lot of
[2:49] things that are within our life of
[2:51] suffering that is just not man I'm
[2:53] always have to carry this chain I always
[2:55] have to I'm always suffering no it's in
[2:58] our daily life our daily suffering just
[3:01] to get up from bed and our aches and
[3:03] pains are there when we go out to work
[3:06] and and somebody's frustrating us how
[3:08] are we going to act and in that is a
[3:11] molding of
[3:12] character so you have to suffer with him
[3:15] every single day you're
[3:18] suffering and what is that creating or
[3:21] molding a character he says you have to
[3:22] suffer to rain the reason for this is
[3:26] that character simply is never made
[3:29] without
[3:31] suffering so character is not brother
[3:34] brandham says character is a victory and
[3:37] not a
[3:38] gift so it's something that we we're not
[3:41] born with it's not something that is
[3:43] given to us and I I truly understand
[3:47] that this is the way it is because of
[3:49] our fallen
[3:51] nature God could not just give us his
[3:53] character anymore like he did with Adam
[3:55] and Eve like he did with Lucifer like he
[3:59] did with the other
[4:00] Angels the Bible says that he created
[4:03] Lucifer
[4:05] perfect they were perfect Adam and Eve
[4:09] they were created in the image of God
[4:12] right so we as Fallen creatures now we
[4:15] come with a little re Renegade nature a
[4:19] character that's ready to fight the
[4:21] world take over and become Caesars and
[4:24] napoleons and whatever and just take
[4:26] over in our work space and take over
[4:28] here and and just
[4:30] that's that's who our character is now
[4:34] so now our character is not a gift it's
[4:37] something that has to be molded every
[4:39] single
[4:41] day and he says it's not a gift a man
[4:45] without character can't
[4:47] Reign because power apart from character
[4:52] is satanic now that's heavy and I I
[4:55] don't want us to go too deep into it oh
[4:58] man that's satanic evil demons is scary
[5:02] Darkness but just think about it it's
[5:05] satanic we're going to go into that just
[5:07] a little bit but Power without or power
[5:10] with character is fit to rule and since
[5:13] he wants us to share his throne on the
[5:16] same basis that he
[5:20] overcame now I like that because yes
[5:23] Jesus did suffer but he lived a life 33
[5:25] years and a half and he says in that
[5:28] same basis of his pattern of life that's
[5:31] how he overcame so we got to look at
[5:33] that
[5:34] pattern now this quote it it can be deep
[5:38] and it is deep it's a deep statement and
[5:40] it's a path to a millennial Reign
[5:43] because we without this molding of
[5:47] character we can't Reign future tense
[5:49] right so it could be deep and we can say
[5:52] how it's a path to a millennial Reign a
[5:56] millennial
[5:57] rule but but and brother random says
[6:00] that that
[6:01] it's we have to have character for the
[6:04] purpose of power or to rule or to Reign
[6:07] that that those are the words rain power
[6:10] and all of that so we're looking at that
[6:12] and we're seeing oh man I I in order for
[6:14] me to be the bride in order for the
[6:16] Rapture in order for me to rein I have
[6:19] to have character but I I believe that
[6:21] this quote we can write it down in a
[6:24] piece of paper we can fold it in our
[6:25] pocket and we can use it every single
[6:28] day cuz cuz as Fathers as mothers we are
[6:33] ruling we are reigning there we are
[6:36] leading that's a better word we are
[6:38] leaders we are leaders in our workspace
[6:41] we are leaders just by default if you
[6:45] call yourself a Christian if you call
[6:47] yourself bride you're already the Bible
[6:50] says the light of the
[6:52] world so that means you're
[6:55] influencing you're leading the Bible
[6:58] says that that uh when when God created
[7:01] Adam and Eve the second thing he did was
[7:04] let them have
[7:06] dominion so we were created in our
[7:10] genetics and everything was to have
[7:13] dominion whether it's dominion over a
[7:16] workspace whatever it might be or just
[7:18] your little tiny Kingdom at
[7:21] home going to the grocery store you are
[7:25] a son and daughter of God reigning and
[7:28] ruling so it can be applied right there
[7:31] and without character well that our lead
[7:34] and our Reign can become satanic right
[7:38] so it it it means this statement it
[7:41] suggests that having power without
[7:43] possessing a good character traits can
[7:46] lead to negative
[7:48] consequences it become just as simple as
[7:51] that power a leading whatever you have
[7:56] without good characters traits without a
[7:59] strong character it leads to negative
[8:01] consequences so this quote shows that
[8:05] character is stronger than
[8:07] power character backs up
[8:11] Authority you cannot be in a in a power
[8:15] position you cannot be in a position of
[8:18] leading without
[8:20] character you have to have an amount of
[8:24] of of moral
[8:27] Restraint of principles and values in
[8:30] order to be a
[8:32] leader because once you become a leader
[8:35] and you don't have the the the
[8:37] principles you don't have the order you
[8:38] don't have that in your life it it's
[8:41] going to go into negative
[8:43] consequences in your
[8:45] leading so so so it protects your
[8:49] Authority character I'd rather I'd
[8:52] rather be a man down in the dumps poor
[8:57] messed up but with character instead of
[9:00] a man with with many things and and and
[9:02] many riches without any
[9:05] character character supersedes power yes
[9:10] that's what brother brandham is saying
[9:13] character supersedes Authority and
[9:17] Leadership so it is the foundation of
[9:19] being a leader Foundation of of of being
[9:23] a person of influence it's your
[9:25] character this quote implies that to
[9:28] effectively lead or Reign like brother
[9:30] Bram says a person must have that strong
[9:34] character character here refers to
[9:37] qualities like honesty Integrity
[9:39] responsibility and moral
[9:42] strength um the way I summed it up as I
[9:44] was s studying this is your character is
[9:47] your values now I want you guys to burn
[9:50] that in your brain it's values it's
[9:54] principles it's motives it's your
[9:57] philosop philosophy
[9:59] or your belief
[10:01] system so so that's in your
[10:05] character what you believe and that's
[10:07] why that's why when we we hear the word
[10:09] the word the word the word and we're
[10:11] like man what we hear so much of we got
[10:14] to stay on the word we got to follow the
[10:16] word Jesus was the word what what is
[10:19] that it is God's Own value
[10:23] system it's his
[10:25] principles and his principles Define his
[10:29] character
[10:29] character so when you look at his word
[10:32] you know who he
[10:33] is it's it's not an image but it is a
[10:38] character within God and when you look
[10:40] at his word and you begin to follow your
[10:44] philosophy begins to be intertwined with
[10:46] this word your belief system and and
[10:50] whenever it's ingrained in there then
[10:52] your body your life everything else is
[10:54] going to translate from what you
[10:57] believe from what your values are you
[11:00] might say oh this is right this is wrong
[11:02] somebody else might say this is wrong
[11:03] and this is right and and it determines
[11:07] their
[11:08] character
[11:10] right so so power and Corruption it it
[11:14] warns that power alone this quote does
[11:18] power alone without a moral compass
[11:21] provided by good character can be
[11:24] corrupting yes it can be corrupted or as
[11:28] brother Bram says
[11:30] satanic in this context satanic it
[11:33] implies that power devoid of ethical
[11:35] considerations can lead to harm
[11:37] Injustice abuse of
[11:40] authority that's why a lot of times we U
[11:44] we hear people say I don't know if
[11:45] you've heard it before but it's like man
[11:47] power is is will corrupt you man power
[11:51] is corrupting but in in reality power is
[11:56] revealing power will reveal your
[12:00] character so so whenever I don't know I
[12:03] lived in a small town so I saw it many
[12:05] times but you would you'd see somebody
[12:07] that you grew up with and um you know a
[12:10] little rascal just like you and then
[12:12] they they put a badge on and then
[12:14] they're somebody
[12:16] different they're over there throwing
[12:18] down the law and they're just somebody
[12:20] and it's like whoa what happened to you
[12:22] what it's their character never changed
[12:25] but their Authority their position
[12:27] changed so now they have a different
[12:29] position but the same character so now
[12:33] now what they're going to do is they're
[12:34] going to abuse that
[12:36] Authority they're going to hurt people
[12:38] they it's going to become unjust it's
[12:41] going to harm other people because their
[12:44] character never changed but their
[12:45] position
[12:46] did right brother bham he says it is
[12:51] satanic okay so this is satanic power
[12:57] apart from character
[12:59] now he's saying it in a way where it's
[13:01] like it's no character if you have power
[13:04] with not any character but the word
[13:08] satanic is basically relating to or the
[13:11] characteristic of
[13:13] Satan so power without this character is
[13:17] a different character it's a Satan it's
[13:20] Satan's
[13:22] character now this scripture um I would
[13:26] like to turn to
[13:29] uh Ezekiel
[13:32] 28:15 and uh I'm not going to hold you
[13:34] guys up too long it might be um before
[13:37] an
[13:39] hour but if you would like to turn with
[13:42] me to Ezekiel 2815
[13:46] to18 this scripture is talking about the
[13:49] king attire of
[13:51] course but it it's it's a good
[13:54] example of what Paul says in Hebrews how
[13:58] the word is a discerner of the thoughts
[14:00] and the intents of the heart because
[14:03] this scripture it goes past the history
[14:06] of what's going on it goes past even the
[14:11] intent and the thoughts of the heart of
[14:15] Ty and it goes all the way to the
[14:18] beginning to another character and his
[14:21] name is
[14:23] Lucifer so that's that's how deep these
[14:26] prophecies and these scripture is that
[14:29] it it'll go straight through history
[14:32] straight through the future straight
[14:34] through our intents and go hey I see you
[14:38] Satan I I see you devil and and and the
[14:42] king of Ty was projecting the character
[14:45] of Satan or satanic character with his
[14:50] power and and God began to speak
[14:53] directly to that covering
[14:57] cherub and and um and he saw his motive
[15:01] and and like I said character is our
[15:04] motive brother bham he says in the
[15:06] message before we read the scripture he
[15:09] says in question and answers he says job
[15:12] and preached in 1959 job said I'll have
[15:15] a desire he'll speak and then I'll
[15:18] answer him see now the body is what you
[15:21] look at the spirit is what controls you
[15:25] your soul is the motive of that spirit
[15:30] or the nature of that Spirit the soul
[15:32] that sth that Soul shall die you're born
[15:36] in the world with a sinful soul and that
[15:39] is the nature of your spirit is
[15:42] sinful you long for the things of the
[15:44] world then the Holy Ghost comes down and
[15:47] baptizes you and changes the nature of
[15:50] that spirit so it changes your motives
[15:54] your motive is is the reason why you're
[15:57] doing something
[15:59] especially when it's hidden so we can we
[16:02] can come to church we can do great
[16:04] things but what is the motive of our
[16:07] heart what is that and there's a big
[16:10] difference between motive and
[16:12] personality because I remember brother
[16:14] brandham he would preach how he's like
[16:17] you you know we can create
[16:19] atmospheres and we're like wow I'm a
[16:21] Creator I can create how by our
[16:24] character that's how what he said by the
[16:28] character and me as a young person it's
[16:30] like I interpret it as man I I'm a
[16:35] pretty quiet guy you know I was probably
[16:37] 18 I barely gave my heart to the Lord
[16:39] and I said man my personality is is kind
[16:41] of
[16:42] garbage my I don't know how to talk to
[16:45] people uh you know keep eye contact or
[16:47] anything like that it's like man nobody
[16:49] was going to want to be around me
[16:50] because that's what I thought I thought
[16:52] it was personality that brother Brandon
[16:55] was talking about but but your
[16:57] personality is something that
[16:59] um we we frame or we create so that
[17:03] people can see
[17:04] us it represents what we want people to
[17:08] see our character is what we actually
[17:12] are a personality is a set of
[17:15] Personality qualities where where is uh
[17:18] character is a collection of mental and
[17:20] moral characteristics of an
[17:22] individual personality is outer
[17:25] appearance and behavior of a person at
[17:28] the same time Time character indicates
[17:30] the traits of a person which are
[17:33] hidden so this character it is
[17:37] creative this character it creates
[17:40] atmospheres it's it's not a
[17:42] personality Lucifer had the probably the
[17:45] greatest personality hey how's it going
[17:47] how are you doing what's going on but
[17:49] what's the character behind that so so
[17:53] now we want to look
[17:54] beyond what we see in the outside what
[17:58] we see here brother Bram says our our
[18:00] flesh is what we see but and our spirit
[18:03] is within us and our soul is the motive
[18:06] of that spirit so we can go do something
[18:09] and everybody says oh well that's good I
[18:11] can go and feed the poor but in my heart
[18:14] it's like I just want to look good for
[18:16] the people right I want to go and do
[18:19] this but in my motive it might be
[18:21] different so so then God that's what he
[18:25] does and the best
[18:29] the best example or the best thing that
[18:31] I've ever seen was when brother brandham
[18:34] would discern the hearts brother
[18:36] brandham he spoke so much on motive and
[18:38] I'm like man why does he talk about
[18:40] motive intention objectives all the time
[18:44] but it's because brother Brenham looked
[18:46] by the grace of God he looked beyond the
[18:49] the outward appearance and he would see
[18:52] the intention of a person the motive of
[18:55] that person and he says you need this
[18:57] and this and this why he saw their
[19:00] motive whatever we do how beautiful we
[19:04] appear whatever image we
[19:07] portray it's the character inside it's
[19:10] the motives that are in our hearts that
[19:13] matters to God that's why we're going to
[19:16] read Ezekiel don't worry but that's why
[19:20] when when God told Samuel Samuel was was
[19:24] crying because God just rejected Saul
[19:28] and he he was mourning and mourning and
[19:30] God had to tell him get up stop crying I
[19:34] got somebody else for
[19:36] you who is it this was our King he said
[19:41] you know what you people he Associated
[19:44] even Samuel maybe Samuel even fell in
[19:48] love with that man he said that's our
[19:50] King even though he's all messed up he
[19:52] said but you look at the outward
[19:55] appearance you see the shoulders you see
[19:58] this you see that I look into the heart
[20:02] I look into the motive I look at
[20:05] intention it doesn't matter how small
[20:08] how ugly how whatever that man
[20:11] is I'm going to use that character and
[20:14] that character is going to produce
[20:16] something far greater than anything that
[20:19] this world can
[20:21] produce I look at the heart I look at
[20:24] the
[20:26] motive Ezekiel
[20:28] 28:15 it says Thou was perfect in thy
[20:34] ways he's talking to
[20:37] Lucifer thou was
[20:40] perfect you were perfect brother
[20:43] brandham says character is not a gift it
[20:47] is a
[20:49] victory he said in in thy ways now in
[20:53] those ways that though that is the
[20:56] statues of God Jesus says I am the way
[20:59] the truth and the life what was it it
[21:02] wasn't a highway it wasn't the 101 it
[21:04] wasn't the i7 that we got to go down it
[21:06] was a way of life values it was the word
[21:11] he said you were perfect in the word you
[21:14] are perfect in my ways
[21:17] until or or he says from that day or
[21:20] from the day that thou was
[21:22] created until iniquity was found in you
[21:26] he he saw motive before he saw action
[21:29] amen iniquity was found in thee now the
[21:35] the reason why we're going into this
[21:36] because brother brandham he says power
[21:39] apart from character is satanic so now
[21:41] we want to see what satanic where is
[21:44] this coming from this is the source
[21:46] right here this is what he's talking
[21:48] about when he talks about a satanic
[21:53] character now remember power doesn't
[21:57] corrupt
[21:58] power
[22:00] reveals so here it's showing the
[22:03] Revelation or revealing of his
[22:07] character and we think oh well man his
[22:10] character is going to be revealed in
[22:11] those hard times no this was in in
[22:16] abundance his character was
[22:20] revealed when everything was good he
[22:22] said by the multitude of thy merchandise
[22:26] that was trading in the market markets
[22:28] and all of that he says by because he's
[22:30] still speaking to the king ofy but he's
[22:32] looking at Lucifer he says by the
[22:35] multitude of thy merchandise
[22:38] success they have filled the midst of
[22:42] thee with
[22:44] violence so was this outer thing that
[22:46] exposed him or or he didn't have the
[22:49] character to to contain all of this
[22:54] goodness thou H has sinned therefore I
[22:56] will cast thee as a Fain out of the
[22:59] Mountain of God I will destroy thee Oh
[23:02] covering cherub from the midst of the
[23:05] stones of fire now he goes again and
[23:08] he's looking within the heart and seeing
[23:11] what happened because of what was given
[23:13] to him he said thine heart was lifted up
[23:18] because of thy
[23:20] Beauty thou so his heart was lifted up
[23:23] because of Outer Image appearance
[23:28] brother Bram he he said in in choosing
[23:31] of a bride this a great message um for
[23:34] what we're talking about because he
[23:35] talks about character a lot but he says
[23:38] that a woman now I don't want to pick on
[23:40] any women but this is this is what
[23:42] brother Bram says he says a woman can or
[23:45] a girl she could be corrupted by her own
[23:48] beauty that people can always say man
[23:52] man the parents the aunts the UNC you're
[23:54] so beautiful you're so beautiful you're
[23:56] so beautiful until they become corrupt
[23:58] corrupted by their own
[24:00] Beauty brother Bram said that so there
[24:02] can be a lifting up or a corruption by
[24:05] own
[24:07] Beauty he says thy heart was lifted up
[24:10] because of thy Beauty thou H has
[24:11] corrupted thy wisdom by the reason of
[24:16] brightness he says I will cast thee to
[24:18] the ground I'll lay thee before kings
[24:21] that they may behold thee thou Hast
[24:23] defiled the sanctuaries by the multitude
[24:26] of thine iniquities by the iniquity of
[24:29] thy traffic therefore I will bring fire
[24:32] from the midst of thee it shall devour
[24:35] thee and I will bring thee um bring thee
[24:38] to ashes upon the Earth in the sight of
[24:40] all of them that behold thee it says you
[24:44] were perfect in your ways until iniquity
[24:47] was found in you we are born in that
[24:52] condition iniquity and our ways are
[24:55] corrupted actually 50 Isaiah you don't
[24:59] have to turn with me but I I saw that
[25:01] correlation and I really just enjoyed it
[25:04] but Isaiah
[25:07] 53 it
[25:08] says 536 he says all we are this is when
[25:13] Jesus had to die for our sins this is
[25:16] where it says that there was no beauty
[25:18] that we should desire him but it says
[25:20] all we like sheep have gone astray we
[25:22] have turned everyone to his own way and
[25:26] the Lord had laid upon him him the
[25:28] iniquity of us
[25:31] all so we what we did because the what
[25:36] gave me this inspiration was I was
[25:37] studying about free moral agency choice
[25:40] and there's a way that God gives us a
[25:43] and God gave us the choice or free moral
[25:46] agent to say I don't want that choice I
[25:48] don't want that way so I'm going to make
[25:50] my own
[25:51] way and here in in 53 of Isaiah it's
[25:55] showing that we've all gone our own way
[25:58] once we go our own way we lose the power
[26:02] the protection of God because the way is
[26:06] the word we get away from the word we
[26:09] get away from God because that is his
[26:11] protection and he says we've all gone
[26:14] our own way and now he had to come and
[26:17] he had to pay the price of our iniquity
[26:19] which means something that you ought to
[26:21] do and you don't
[26:22] do so he paid the price of our wrong
[26:26] choices
[26:28] of our own ways and and he here is the
[26:31] originator of that
[26:33] iniquity he chose because brother B says
[26:36] he gave him the same put him in the same
[26:38] bases in the Garden of Eden as in the
[26:42] Garden of Eden a a tree of knowledge of
[26:44] Good and Evil and the tree of life and
[26:46] he chose knowledge of Good and Evil he
[26:50] chose his own way maybe his actions
[26:54] showed something else but God looks at
[26:57] the motive
[26:59] so the
[27:00] reason this is the amazing thing is the
[27:04] Reason God uses the kings of Babylon
[27:08] because in Isaiah 14 he uses them them
[27:12] he uses him as Lucifer the king of Ty
[27:15] the old covering cherub the king of
[27:17] Egypt to expose Satan is because their
[27:21] characteristics we projecting the
[27:24] psychology of Satan his own mind right
[27:28] right and I started to think about it
[27:31] and as we grow up because we are molded
[27:34] we are not given
[27:36] character we are projecting satanic
[27:41] characteristics every time we get
[27:44] angry every time pride comes in our
[27:47] heart every time we think we're better
[27:50] than
[27:51] somebody every time all of those things
[27:54] are character satanic characteristics
[27:58] there was one time where where Jesus he
[28:01] be to tell his disciples all the things
[28:04] he must suffer he said I must suffer
[28:06] this and that and and Peter the Bible
[28:09] says Peter took him he said don't say
[28:12] those
[28:13] things he said don't be telling us those
[28:16] things that's not going to happen to you
[28:17] what was it
[28:19] selfishness no you can't die we need you
[28:23] Jesus looked at him and looked right
[28:26] past Peter he said Satan get the behind
[28:29] me what was it it was a characteristic
[28:31] of Satan
[28:34] selfishness and every time something
[28:37] Rises up whenever we're driving in the
[28:39] 101 or the I 10 Satan comes
[28:43] out oh I just want
[28:46] to right and God has to come and say
[28:51] hey get thee behind me Satan watch out
[28:56] those are satanic
[28:59] whenever we go and and and we're leading
[29:02] we have to lead lives of
[29:04] Christians and every time we get out of
[29:07] character of God we go into the
[29:09] character of
[29:11] Satan we go into anger greed
[29:14] pridefulness all of those
[29:18] things so he said get thee behind
[29:22] me
[29:24] Satan in Isaiah 1413 and4 he says for
[29:28] thou has said in thine heart man I I
[29:32] love how God just pierces this God
[29:35] doesn't care about action action is
[29:38] going to come let the heart be right let
[29:42] the motive be right work work on this
[29:45] person in
[29:47] here action it'll come
[29:50] amen he says for thou has said in thine
[29:53] heart I will Ascend now now this this is
[30:00] Lucifer's projection or his his
[30:04] perverted way of thinking what God
[30:07] should be he says I will Ascend into
[30:10] heaven I will exalt my throne above the
[30:14] stars of God I will sit upon the Mount
[30:18] of the congregation in the sides of the
[30:20] north I will Ascend above the heights of
[30:23] the clouds I will be like the most high
[30:27] I I I I I I that's a characteristic of
[30:30] Satan me me me I I I I remember um one
[30:35] of my buddies at work he'd say man you
[30:37] work for the Navy to one of my other
[30:39] co-workers he's like why he's like
[30:41] because you're always saying I I I me me
[30:45] I I I he said you work for the Navy
[30:48] uh why it
[30:51] selfishness and notice the process of
[30:53] Satan's thinking here in the these two
[30:55] little verses he says I I will
[30:59] Ascend
[31:01] exalt I will sit on the
[31:04] mount I will Ascend above and then the
[31:08] last
[31:09] one is I will be like
[31:15] God now this is important because this
[31:19] shows the perver perverted point of view
[31:23] of how to be like
[31:26] God he missed
[31:28] characterized
[31:30] God by a selfish
[31:33] exaltation he saw God and he says that's
[31:37] that's how it is to be like God he
[31:40] mischaracterized him even to the point
[31:43] well whatever the tale was he
[31:46] mischaracterized God to the point he
[31:49] pulled angels to his
[31:51] side I remember brother bam saying I I
[31:54] don't remember I believe it's um the
[31:56] conflict between God and but he he says
[31:59] how Satan attacked the
[32:02] word i' say it looks like he's attacking
[32:05] Adam and Eve you know just in
[32:08] my you know just
[32:11] thinking and I realized Satan don't care
[32:14] about us we're
[32:16] easy but if we're fortified by the word
[32:19] he has
[32:21] to mischaracterize God he has to
[32:25] mischaracterize God's values what are
[32:28] his values his
[32:29] word so if he can Mis or skew and and
[32:34] pervert the word of God then we see God
[32:37] in a different
[32:38] light and that's why God says I never
[32:43] change he's so adamant about his own
[32:46] values his own character that he says
[32:49] heavens and earth shall pass away but my
[32:52] values my word shall never pass away why
[32:57] because that that that is
[33:00] God his word is his principles he lives
[33:04] and he died by those
[33:06] principles that is his principes so when
[33:09] the saan can go and mischaracterize God
[33:12] then he's got the people
[33:14] whipped he's got the people where he
[33:17] wants them to be and and he saw God and
[33:19] he says yeah I want to I want to ascend
[33:22] like God I want to be selfish I want to
[33:24] be over all the stars all the Cong ation
[33:28] what is the people the angels He says I
[33:31] want to sit in the sides of the north I
[33:33] remember uh David talking about uh what
[33:36] a beautiful
[33:37] situation sitting in the the Holy
[33:40] Mountain the sides of the north it was
[33:42] there in that Jerusalem he said I want
[33:44] to sit there above the Jews above the
[33:46] Gentiles above the Angels like God I
[33:50] want to be like him my question is do we
[33:53] want to be like
[33:55] God do we want to be like God
[33:59] amen but he
[34:01] mischaracterized what to be like God
[34:04] is I want to be over I'm the bride we're
[34:10] better oh got to be careful we're
[34:14] greater we've got a greater
[34:17] thing where we want the position without
[34:21] the
[34:22] character I'm I want to be
[34:25] better that's what he wanted
[34:28] he wanted to rule over brother bam he
[34:30] says in this God God of his e evil age
[34:33] he says notice what he'll do his
[34:36] thoughts he thought God dwell in worldly
[34:40] beauty that was saying
[34:43] thought he saw the
[34:45] outer he saw the outer appearance he
[34:48] said he did that in
[34:50] Heaven Sin never began in the Garden of
[34:52] Eden it began in heaven when Lucifer the
[34:56] son of the morning exalt himself in
[34:58] Beauty and wanted a more beautiful
[35:00] kingdom than Michael than of Michael I I
[35:03] don't want to get too much into that but
[35:05] brother bradam has thoughts of who
[35:06] Michael is right you read Hebrews 1 and
[35:10] 2 it says that Jesus had a greater he
[35:15] says he I'll call the Angels ministering
[35:18] Spirits flames of fire but to you your
[35:22] throne will last
[35:24] forever right
[35:28] beautiful and and chapter 2 it shows
[35:30] that he was greater than all he was not
[35:33] merely a creation but he was the cause
[35:36] of
[35:37] creation and then in Chapter 2 it shows
[35:40] how he made himself a little lower than
[35:44] Angels that's
[35:46] character he made himself a little lower
[35:50] Satan wanted to be
[35:51] over he wanted to be over Angels he
[35:54] wanted to be greater because that's his
[35:58] thought and he says he thought God dwelt
[36:01] in Beauty Sayan begins to Mis represent
[36:06] God by by saying the reason why God is
[36:10] great is because of his Beauty because
[36:12] of his self
[36:14] exaltation but we realize that God he
[36:18] occupies this position because of his
[36:23] virtue we see that in throughout the
[36:25] whole Bible that God is willing to go to
[36:28] the
[36:29] lowest that's character Sayan was like
[36:33] no I want to be like God I want to have
[36:34] be the image of God he wanted the
[36:37] position but yet God was stood in that
[36:41] position because of his
[36:44] virtue because he was willing to leave
[36:46] the throne and wash feet of dirty
[36:51] fishermen to be laughed at to be spit
[36:55] at I wonder brother brandham said this I
[36:58] don't have the quote but he said that
[37:01] the devil doubted because he saw Jesus
[37:04] do that he says wait he's claiming to be
[37:07] the Son of God he and he's acting like
[37:12] this he was ready for a fight he was
[37:16] ready for a Michael he was ready for a
[37:20] heaven battle but he saw a little man
[37:24] not knowing that the
[37:26] fullness of the character of God was in
[37:29] that
[37:30] man his game is to me re misrepresent
[37:33] the character of God character is your
[37:36] values your principles your motives your
[37:39] philosophy or your belief
[37:42] system like I said that's why God says I
[37:44] don't
[37:45] change heavens and earth pass away my
[37:49] word will remain why because that's his
[37:53] values and that's why we have to be
[37:56] careful we have to be careful of yes I
[37:59] want to be like God the Bible says in
[38:02] Philippians he says put the mind of
[38:05] Christ put the mind of Christ and then
[38:07] he started saying he wasn't afraid to be
[38:10] called equal to God call himself equal
[38:13] man that sounds like Satan but then it
[38:16] says that he was willing to suffer that
[38:19] he was he put himself
[38:21] lower that is to be like God lord I want
[38:25] to be like you all right
[38:28] you're going to have his
[38:30] character you're you're you're not going
[38:32] to have this great Kingdom or anything
[38:34] like that you're going to have his
[38:35] character to help those in need to
[38:39] project His
[38:42] Image he thought it not Rob robbery to
[38:45] make himself equal brother Brenham says
[38:47] his own character molded him to that
[38:51] kind of person so to be equal to God is
[38:54] a molding of character and not anything
[38:57] else
[38:59] else so the closest we are to God is is
[39:03] when we humble
[39:05] ourselves when we allow God to enter in
[39:09] when when we put it like the song says
[39:11] we take ourselves away and let God come
[39:15] in and the closest to Satan is not when
[39:18] we're smoking and drinking out in the
[39:20] world it's when we're
[39:24] prideful this is what made me realize
[39:27] that why the Bible says it'll be so
[39:30] close to the very elect that it'll
[39:31] deceive them if it's
[39:33] possible because Satan doesn't dwell in
[39:36] dingy
[39:38] dirty Satan doesn't dwell in in in all
[39:42] of those things which which those are
[39:44] produces that sin produces those things
[39:47] but where he wants to be is right next
[39:51] to God he's used to that he wants to be
[39:54] closest to God he wants to be the
[39:56] closest to per ction that's why Cain was
[39:59] the closest to Jesus I mean uh uh Judas
[40:03] was the closest to Jesus other than John
[40:06] he was right
[40:09] there Cain had the most beautiful
[40:12] sacrifice Esau was was the the more
[40:16] respectable
[40:18] man why it's he wants to be there he's
[40:22] comfortable there in
[40:24] Perfection where where where our
[40:26] perfection can become our
[40:30] corruption where where we need to
[40:32] realize that the position that God
[40:34] places the bride is not any other
[40:38] position you nobody can just come and
[40:40] take a position of a child of God right
[40:44] because the character has to match that
[40:47] position and if it doesn't the the we'll
[40:50] be corrupted by the reason of our
[40:53] brightness we we'll be we we'll have
[40:56] iniquity by the our wisdom our wisdom
[40:59] will be defiled the Bible
[41:01] says by the reason of our Beauty wow
[41:04] look at
[41:05] them I am the bride I am this holding a
[41:11] position and not having the
[41:15] character holding a position and we can
[41:18] go into our lives and say Lord the
[41:23] position I
[41:24] hold that this this message is not for
[41:27] me to preach to you it's for me to sit
[41:30] here also and say
[41:32] Lord I didn't I wasn't born
[41:36] perfect I got a lot of molding to do I
[41:39] got a lot of things that I need to work
[41:41] on and and that's why God chose us
[41:44] because he wants our character to be a
[41:48] victory he wants us we're always in the
[41:51] becoming stage we're never perfect in
[41:55] this flesh we're always becoming that
[41:59] man the messages that that brother Aaron
[42:01] has been preaching I I was here when he
[42:05] preached oh my goodness what message it
[42:07] was the first one of Liberty I forgot
[42:10] what it was cuz now he's in impatient
[42:11] Liberty but it was the first one and he
[42:14] said something great he said that Jesus
[42:18] redeemed us and he gave his holy spirit
[42:22] to liberate us and it's not to liberate
[42:26] us so that we could do whatever we want
[42:28] to do that's a characterless
[42:31] person oh I'm I'm free to do anything
[42:34] but he says Liberty is the concept of
[42:36] freedom to
[42:38] become the freedom to
[42:41] become so now now I have the Liberty to
[42:44] be molded into
[42:47] Christ and and how do I do that by what
[42:50] looking at his
[42:52] glory and the more value I see the more
[42:55] values and principles I see the more it
[42:57] become I become
[42:59] that so so that's what we want every
[43:03] single day we want to be in the
[43:05] character of God no matter what an outer
[43:08] appearance looks like whatever our
[43:09] position is if we can stand firm in our
[43:12] character that's what matters to God
[43:15] he's looking at our
[43:17] heart he's looking at at us brother
[43:21] brandham he
[43:23] says he says notice now but God is
[43:27] featured in character there is no Beauty
[43:30] we should desire Jesus but there was
[43:34] never a character like him on earth now
[43:37] we find out today that the church
[43:39] character Satan and his group look after
[43:42] big beautiful churches beautiful things
[43:45] he says that's what the world looks at
[43:48] today oh it's the pastor the great and
[43:53] so and so time oh so and so Priestly and
[43:55] godly walking out these big robes and
[43:58] things like that they call that
[44:01] beauty it's so easy to call it Beauty
[44:04] we're human even Samuel said man look at
[44:08] Saul look at how great he is it's so
[44:11] easy but God it says but the real saints
[44:14] of God man so he gives us a different
[44:17] kind of vision now well it takes that
[44:20] away because it's so easy to look at
[44:22] that he says but the real saints of God
[44:25] looks for character
[44:27] of the Vindicated
[44:31] word the Bible is just not an
[44:33] understanding of religious
[44:35] Doctrine it's not for knowledge Doctrine
[44:38] so that we can we can
[44:41] uh you know create these things create
[44:44] structures of Our Lives that's not it
[44:47] but it it's a gaining of insight to the
[44:50] moral and ethical principles and that
[44:53] Define God's character the word defines
[44:57] God character every that's why when
[44:59] Satan says I want to be like God look at
[45:02] how great he is he's over everybody
[45:04] while we're these just little tiny ants
[45:07] everybody's killing each other there
[45:08] people sick and all of that he wants us
[45:10] to think that but I want to be like that
[45:14] I want to be
[45:15] great but the Bible says different he
[45:19] says that he came down and he became
[45:23] that so that we can become him
[45:27] that's what the Bible does for us it
[45:30] defines God's character and and and the
[45:33] best thing for us to do as I'm closing
[45:36] the best thing is is to be raised and to
[45:38] be taught to have good
[45:40] character but but our natural we got to
[45:43] remember that our natural character does
[45:45] not compare to the mind of
[45:47] Christ so it it can only help us get to
[45:52] that real
[45:54] character so when we're raising our
[45:56] children when we're helping one another
[45:58] out when we're coming to church what
[46:00] it's doing it's it's creating a
[46:03] character children when they're getting
[46:05] taught and all of that it's creating a
[46:07] character but it does not compare to the
[46:09] character of God but it helps us to get
[46:12] there brother brandham he says in the
[46:14] message he carth for you if you'd like
[46:17] to stand with me he says this leads to
[46:21] eternal
[46:22] life a man is made so that he could want
[46:26] that that comforter so so even though
[46:28] our nature and everything is all messed
[46:30] up God still found a way so that we can
[46:34] seek thirst desire that comforter he
[46:38] says he is wanting a comforter because
[46:42] he was made that way that's the way God
[46:45] put him together built rooms in him his
[46:50] soul his conscience his sight his senses
[46:53] everything was put together so
[46:55] everything that is consisted of us or
[46:59] con you know everything that is made up
[47:01] in US it it is built so that we can want
[47:04] that character and then us a as As
[47:09] Leaders parents uh whatever wherever you
[47:13] are as a leader wherever you are what
[47:14] we're doing is we're building character
[47:18] to those that are be underneath us we're
[47:22] building character in their
[47:24] conscience saying that's bad
[47:27] showing them good
[47:30] memories allowing them to reason but
[47:32] reason a right way see all of that is
[47:36] within us allow us allow them to show
[47:39] what's good and what's bad and and all
[47:41] of that is not to replace the comforter
[47:44] but it is to take us to the
[47:46] comforter so that whenever it's built
[47:49] and and it's there then the the young
[47:51] man the young woman can come to God and
[47:54] they could be ready saying Lord I know
[47:57] Lord I I've been raised in a good home I
[48:00] I've been raised the right way but Lord
[48:02] I need your
[48:04] comforter I need your your character to
[48:08] overcome because I will never be able to
[48:11] fulfill God's word without your
[48:15] character let us bow our heads as uh the
[48:18] brother wants to come
[48:20] up Heavenly
[48:23] Father Lord
[48:27] it's only by you
[48:29] father only by your holy spirit that
[48:32] that we can have this
[48:34] character it's not a man-made character
[48:37] father even though many people here were
[48:40] raised
[48:42] right lord it's not sufficient
[48:46] father what's sufficient for you Lord is
[48:49] your own Holy Spirit to live within us
[48:54] and as your spirit is in us then we
[48:56] could take your word because your word
[48:59] without our spirit it'll cause us to
[49:02] become just like Lucifer
[49:05] satanic with all of this authority of
[49:08] the word authority of the Bride
[49:10] authority authority without the
[49:13] character The Authority as people say
[49:16] the authority of the third pole but
[49:18] without character it'll never
[49:21] work it's whatever the character of
[49:23] Christ comes in US Lord then we we can
[49:27] walk as the bride we can walk as the
[49:30] light we can walk as Christians we can
[49:32] walk as what you intended us to walk by
[49:36] as Kings and Priests Lord as Christians
[49:40] as light of the world father I ask Lord
[49:43] that you just touch each and every
[49:44] person here Lord allow your word to just
[49:48] work in them as they they go to their
[49:50] homes is wherever they go father they go
[49:52] back to work
[49:53] tomorrow Lord let your word your values
[49:57] just work in them Father that whatever
[50:01] defect that we have can begin to be
[50:03] molded and chiseled out father that we
[50:07] become more of the Statue of the perfect
[50:10] man Lord we thank you Jesus in the name
[50:13] of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen
[50:16] and amen amen
