the time that we're living in the shortness that we have left and let's make every day count every minute count we don't know what that would be amen and what a privilege it is to win this hole for christ the value of it and um just you know sometimes we just want to be out there on the mission field but every day we walk out of here we are on the mission field so let's just remember that and just for all the missionaries out there that are on mission fields working for god that god would just keep him safe amen and for we know if god told them to go there then that's the safest place they can be amen so we pray for uh all the unspokens this morning and let's just stand and as we um uh just get rid of take these to the lord let's just go on one accord dear heavenly father lord as we

our prophet said that you know the only thing that's going to end there and then there is perfect love amen when he says i know you're my disciples when you have one love one for another amen so hat let us have that godly love amen because the world don't have it i mean it's pretty obvious to see amen so let us be the oddball that that proclaims it and give them and say that god gave it to me it's him living in me amen hallelujah amen does this just sing mercy rewrote my life amen how many believe that this thing mercy my life mercy re-roll my life i should have fallen my soul cast down

all my life hallelujah we should always have some sort of testimony amen sometimes we don't think about it but it doesn't take too long in god's presence before you realize i got a testimony hallelujah sister linda young man at my house yeah i'd like to share a little one i mean we've been having some you know every service is a great service you can't just pick one out of the other ones because everything's god's word right so don't add one word don't take one word from it right but we had a service on do it you know just go out and do it you know just start putting things aside and things that would stop you from doing it and just go out and do it you know don't let that devil because you know he has a million excuses right and um my days at work are fairly short and not that that should change anything but i figured you know like like the prophet said if i'm going to do something for a guy god do it now and so i know sometimes i feel like i just received lord you know how you you you come in the lord and you're like on fire and you're just like boom you're out there and uh i think that's the way it should be right so i talked to a gentleman at work and you know he's asked me a few questions i sat down for 45 minutes and just gave him the gospel and we just prayed that his name's sean and that he would just heed the call because you know like i told him i said i don't know if this is your day of visitation but we all have one um only the lord knows that but heed the call if it is because um his coming is nigh and uh i truly believed he he was filled with the spirit of christ and we just pray that i can just keep nurturing that and many more amen as the day approaches amen let's just uh stan did you want to come up brother yes sure sure yeah i was just going to sing only believe but brother giancarlo well brother brother said that i don't usually do this but anybody have a testimony well i i usually do this is there anything that's kind of special it's such a blessing to have brother bill's family here um we just love you and miss you and so you know we get together just few times a year a couple times and it's just wonderful so we just appreciate love each and every one of you but uh i don't i don't know the last time brother tim like maybe did a special for us in this church and and i know he he believes in being instant in season out of season okay praise the lord you know um just played most songs and old songs [Music] ah [Music] wow [Music] wow [Music] ah [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] unless you've all heard that voice call us home thank god for that voice and then he's given us ears to hear and often times we get off track and he calls us back amen really appreciated that amen well let's stand together and invite our pastor bill bailey to come and give us the words of life amen we've been looking forward to this service been praying much just of course i uh we don't get to hear brother bill very much and you do so you kind of get used to it you know how uh if you have it all the time it's it's how the how the bible says uh prophets without honor saving his own country well we don't hear we're really looking forward to this and we're been praying and and uh i just want our our church to just receive hang on to every word of god and and and receive it with all your heart amen we appreciate brother bill appreciate the stand that he's had for so many years and there's something to be said about being a rock and we just appreciate that so much what a great testimony and uh let's just pray for his his body his strength and that god would just bless him tonight to meet to meet our needs amen i'm not saying only believe as our brother comes only believe [Music] only believe [Music] all things are

that was with him the angel that we didn't see and you and i understand that you and i believe that that god has done a tremendous work in this name amen sirs is this the time he got to the end and you know the people are worshiping and praising god at the end of the service and he said do you love him and oh yeah he said be sure of that and then he repeated that he says be real sure of that that you're in love with god not the pastor not the church not brother branham god bless you good to see everybody i was just thinking back there i'm flat but i'm glad god's not flat uh god it's awesome it's vibrant i have to apologize to my family members that have come up tonight drove all this distance just to hear hear stuff that they've heard for the last three or four weeks months but if god adds his blessing it'll be worth it that's the whole idea is and god will and his blessing if we get ourselves out of the way first kings chapter 19 if you would in your scriptures first kings 19 it's a privilege to even be assembled together we have no control over this covet we don't know what's going to happen we don't know all the things that have happened and will happen but i think in psalms 22 122 david said i was glad when they said unto me let us go to the house of the lord we don't know what tomorrow holds we don't know what the governor we don't know what what this whole situation is going to unfold to uh first kings 19 or yeah first kings 19 first one and ahab told jezebel all that elijah had done and with all how he had slain all the prophets with the sword then jezebel sent a messenger unto elijah saying so let the gods do to me and more also if i make not thy life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time and when he saw that he arose and went for his life and came to beersheba which belongeth to judah and left his servant there dear lord jesus we thank you this night for your goodness thank you for this open door oh god i'm not worthy of those words that brother john spoke and he himself has labored endlessly and it's not always well regarded it's not always as fruitful as we would like to see it but god you look upon our hearts may you bless brother john bless his family bless this assembly may you bless our hearts bless our lives we're not asking for money we're not asking for a long life we're not asking for material we're asking to be more like you to please you to reflect you in everything we do everything we say we love you we thank you we ask your blessing on the reading of the word tonight in jesus christ precious name amen there's some things that just go unseen i've got sanitizer on my hand you can't see it but it's there sometimes the holy ghost isn't real evident it isn't something that you can cut with a knife but it's there amen i'll tell you what get the holy ghost if you don't have the holy ghost you're not going to go one inch further you might be able to recite the book you might be able to read might be able to understand and listen to the tapes you've got to have the holy ghost a few years back i went to the mailbox and in the mail was a bar soap i thought somebody was trying to give me a hint it was called spirit soap i thought wow spirit soap i like that and it said this is to clean you i like that this is to deodorize you i like that i need that and this is to soften you you stayed down on your face nobody's going to knock you down stay down low this morning i preached on the invasion of the usa we got to stay low keep down we're not pretending to be rambos out there trying to win the whole war i was in vietnam i learned one thing get down doc get your head down don't go out there and try to be some hero get down keep your face in the dirt i read that soap i said i'm gonna go take a bath right now i want to bathe in this spirit soap and i rubbed it up i got soapy i got lathered but you know the next day i began to stink the next day i was a little hard instead of shocked the next day i thought about what the secret was just keep bathing just keep bathing in that presence of god keep bathing in that holy ghost brother branham was up on the indian reservation he ran into a teeth he said chief how you doing he says well there's a battle going on inside me a battle yeah he said it's two dogs one white dog one black dog he said well chief who's willing he said the one i feed the most the one i feed the most that's no mystery what we entertain what we feed on i'm sorry if i spit and slobber but it's like brother madam said when they when they crossed over canaan's fair land and they found them grapes he said don't worry i'm just them grapes are so juicy they're just spitting out all over come on over the grapes are good come on over in the canaan's land get the holy ghost whatever you do because your feelings will deceive you i sat back there and i said i'm flat i really felt flat just but god is not glad god is real he's alive he's waiting for you and i to get into the harness he said take my yoke upon me on you learn of me for my burden is life and my yoke is easy i come off vlad he's not flat he's perfect god all the time our feelings if we go to seed on feelings we'll have a defeated attitude a lot now there's times like elijah here appears in the 19th chapter and if you read real close he was running from jezebel she must have got some of the tapes where he called her dog meat she must have heard some of them tapes you know like the two lawyers they went to church one guy came out happy one guy came out sadly said the the happy guy said what's wrong he said that that guy the pulpit said i was guilty the whole time and he said it's the hardest case i ever fought i tried to prove how innocent i was all the way to the time he was preaching and the happy lawyer he said well i can see you should have just said guilty all the first i'm guilty i'm not worthy of your presence i'm not worthy of your blood i'm that worthy of your life [Music] jesse bill she kept hearing them tapes the tape boys got to her hello miss dog meat oh my goodness that thing's too popular boy what if the aclu got hold of that and whatever all right telling you well that guy he called me a buzzer the other guy said well he called me an eagle and here's elijah running from a woman what the the the same elijah the one was on mount carmel the same guy no way him at it no no no no he came out flat you're going to have bad days read 2nd corinthians 4. we have this treasure in earthen vessels read the very next verse and we're troubled on every side we've got the treasure thank god for the treasure thank god for the holy ghost thank god for salvation thank god he put your name on the book of life before you were born but you're still going to have trouble still going to have days what's the sense what's the point deal with it be a man be a woman be a lady be a saint said the bee of death said we're gonna cut your head off paul he said cut her clean i don't like a mess oh death where's your sting oh grave where's your victory i possess you too amen we have this treasure in earthen vessels and we are troubled on every side brother mark you're in the line of fire there i'm telling you i wish i could say it's holy spirit if it's god doing it it's holy elijah running i mean just a few chapters before just just read back seven chapter 18 chapter chapter 18 he was on mount carmel one man against hundreds of false prophets he began to mock him he said let's build an altar whoever answers my fire that'll be god that should prove a lot of stuff they said good so they got up there they climbed on the altar man they had a service you wouldn't believe they were just excited making noise no fire nothing happened he said call louder maybe he's sleeping maybe he's on a trip somewhere he began to mock them i mean bold chapter 19 he's run from a woman that can happen to each one of us every day amen don't bank don't rely on what how you were blessed yesterday don't rely on how you were blessed this morning amen god it's a steady continual walk and i'll tell you what there is nothing outside of god that's going to satisfy a real child of god chapter 17. god said elijah go tell ahab there's not gonna be any rain for three and a half years so you call for it i mean brave fearless thus saith the lord and there's times we can't even hardly remember how to tie our shoes there's spiritual shoes i'm talking about there's times we get in the quandary there's times we get into what and we don't know which left hand from right hand spiritually don't go by what you feel go by what this says all the father has given me will come to me he that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out amen brother bran who said what is it it's the word joining the word it's the word in you joining the word christ that's not something you hatched up don't vote for vote for me for councilman or trustee it's not something you begged for is god by his sovereign grace amen before the foundation of the world electing you amen breathe ezekiel 16 this week it's 60 70 some verses but it's good reading because god walked by israel israel was laying there a baby unwashed just born still had the umbilical cord laying there anything could have taken its life anything could have destroyed it and god the holy god saw israel laying in her own blood laying there in her nativity and he walked by and he said live wow he got entered into a covenant with israel it wasn't israel's choice it wasn't because israel had signed in the you know where do i sign up for this god by his grace chose don't you ever speak against the jew if you don't have nothing good to say don't say anything you're gonna cause yourself more trouble the jews are god's chosen people we were the ones grafted in [Laughter] thank god for the grafting process thank god that he gave us something to hold us oh my goodness brother john can i come back three or four more times i just he told israel he saw her in her nativity covered with blood laying there not even a blanket on her he said live and then he entered a covenant he said i'm going to be with you no matter where you go no matter what you do but the story got kind of sad because israel began to look in the mirror whoa she's a pretty good looking old gal she began to trust in herself she began to limit god she began to commit whoredoms but she's getting pretty rank she totally turned her back on god but you know god he's the one that started that covenant it wasn't because of israel's goodness it wasn't because israel bought a certain parcel with money it's because god rich in mercy chose her same way he chose you before the foundation of the world it's not your goodness she committed hardems she did everything wrong could be done wrong read the read the chapter you get toward the very last god said nevertheless i know what you did i know you were a bad girl i know you but i am going to save your soul amen because i entered into that covenant with you without you even saying anything it was my idea and i'm going to make sure it works what about the blood of jesus brother sister don't you ever leave sight of calvary if your religion takes you so far that you don't see the blood anymore you better make sure you better back up and track your steps better because it has to go past the cross it has to go past that supreme sacrifice here's elijah running three and a half years chapter 17 no rain he said elijah go down to the brook tariff i'ma feed you with the ravens drink from the brook three and a half years kind of not bad i could do that after a while the brook began to dry up because it was his word that he spoke right in the will of god the brook dried up there's times our brooks dry up there's times we have troubles there's times don't look at the promise look who stood philippians 1 6 being confident of this very thing that he which hath h-a-t-h began a good work in you will perform it not could perform it will perform it until the day of jesus christ we know he can but he not only can he will bill your flat today i told you lord i'm not i got this bill i got you bill i know you're not feeling good i know you're i know that happened and i know you're discouraged i got this bill let me carry a bill not our doing it's god rich in his mercy that wrote our names i was sitting there in my front yard the other day and i watched this little thistle seed go you never see the little dandelion seeds they go flame through the air and in the little milkweed seeds and and the thistle seeds and all the different seeds flying they come from the east and west they come from the lands afar you and i by the grace of almighty god we've come from here come from that background come from that place come from that god in mercy has already predestinated us to be a child of god in this day john 15. john 15 verse 16. ye have not chosen me i got a phone call today you know some guy you know endorsing somebody choosing us he chose us before the world was ever created he chose us you have not chosen me but i have chosen you and ordained you that you should bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever you shall ask my father my name he may give it to you he chose you he chose us elijah was chosen i but yet god had a plan moses he chose to serve god i think it kind of the fruit doesn't fall too far from the tree god chose us now it's our turn to choose him what are we going to do with this jesus called christ hebrews 11 hebrews 11 24 by faith moses when he was come to years refused to be called a methodist i believe god they heard about the angel of the lord the miracles of god the visions they said we're going to jeffersonville and see this man william branham i said i'm not going you know why i had my badge that my church we were going to for perfect attendance i have been there for a whole year without missing the service and my badge to prove it but you know what i was a sinner but i had my past but i was so sick i needed god's is good morning friends i just pulled your car over here we'll just have a little look how you doing today don't want nothing to do with somebody could look right through me that scared me i was 15. i thought it had the world by the tail and i played three different sports in high school i thought man they're playing tough i said okay i'll go you don't have to tell me god sent a prophet we got there to the tabernacle when he preached the anointed ones at the end time 1965 july 25th every door of that tabernacle had a crowd around it two hours before service kind of like you know message churches today everybody gathers early and appreciate brother bill i'll tell you what if brother random is here every one of these front seats will be full everyone you know we set way in the back we did oh well you know that's just profile patient that's good that's just meddling now i'm just good that's right that's no respecter person why should we be when they open them doors hundreds of people i didn't even get to sit with brother bob sister milly every every chair was full in 10 seconds seemed like where'd they go oh there they are and i'll tell you what every time brother branham looked at me i put my head down i was scared i'm telling i was scared to i thought that's a prophet of god and probably the holy spirit was just sitting right there get him get him he's yours you don't have to convince me that god sent a prophet but but be careful there's a ditch on both sides if everything you say well the prophet be careful brother branham said the prophet of the hour is the holy ghost the prophet of the hour is the who did brother branham rely on the holy ghost amen if you get it right it was malachi 4 it was a gift of healing it was revelation 10 7 it was an anointing right from god amen yeah you just have to be careful find the balance if it it has to bring glory not to william branham but to the lord jesus christ by faith moses when he was come the years refused to be called the son of pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of god choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of god than to enjoy the pleasure of sin for a season esteeming the reproach of christ greater riches than the treasures in egypt for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward by faith he forsook egypt not fearing the wrath of the king for he endured as seeing him who was invisible exodus 3 let's look at a little bit of moses in his choosing process now remember saints moses was a real man of god at the end of service today tab was playing that song he hideth my soul he passed by he let me see he let moses see the back to him he put his hand over him and as much as moses was used because of his disobedience god would not let him go into the promised land what a what a lesson that should be to all of us well i've been in this message 50 years well i'm glad to hear that that's good but your temper and yesterday i saw what were you doing what what are you reading that stuff for what are you looking at that what's the matter with you that's good when god tries to remind us tries to speak to us exodus 3 1. now moses kept the flock of jethro his father-in-law the priesthood midian he led the flock to the backside of the desert and came to the mountain of god even to horeb and the angel of the lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire does your bible say that the angel of the lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the bush was not consumed and moses said i will now turn aside there's a lot of things we need to turn aside from you can't serve the world and god at the same time paul said you've got to take off the old man before you can put on the new yeah some of my boys they were going to school so they thought just to save time they'll wear their pajamas under their clothes you know they started looking kind of lumpy and they started smelling kind of funny don't try to put the new one until you take the old one off it's not you accepting the holy ghost it's the holy ghost accepting you we'll never get good enough that's the truth remember that time he brother baptized doc uh what was his last name somebody help me anyhow he brother bannon was talking to him and he said well when i get good enough i'll he said doc god didn't come to save the good guys he came to save the bad guys and so brother brandon baptized him and some of his own people in the church criticized him for doing that because doc went out as soon as he baptized him went out and lit up a cigarette papa cox papa cox there you go papa cox thank you he went out lit up a cigarette i told you i told you the brothers [Music] we still got them i told you brother i told you brother john i told him if you don't listen to me look up now he baptized him anyhow cigarette breath on his on his breath he's still baptized he went out lit up right afterwards some of the things we need to turn aside from is criticism take this whole world but give me jesus i'm not here to i i don't want to offend you i don't want to offend nobody but i don't want to offend jesus above all said i will now turn aside and

don't care who it is this scripture every word every every letter points to almighty god take your shoes off moses you're on holy ground god went on to say moses i've i've seen the cry of my people in in bondage and i read it yourself a little bit later this week i am come down to deliver them now you get going god said i am come down who's he used moses if he uses you for anything get yourself yielded because moses made a terrible mistake when he got disobedient before god god told him he smoked the rock water came out he said this time don't smite it just speak to it he got angry instead of speaking to the rock he hid it again water the bible said came out abundantly you know god will even bless our wrongdoings god will still send his anointing that's one of the most deceitful things there is in the world well why didn't god kill me well why didn't eve fall dead the first day the day you eat thereof that day you'll die she took of the fruit she didn't fall over dead she must thought well it's okay she never lived one day methuselah was what 900 and some years old no a day with the lord is a thousand years and a thousand years is one day she never lived today you might

with you if god is for you who can be against you whoop well there's covid and all this other stuff and and these guys that we don't see eye to eye and they don't so look at jesus look at jesus they killed him i mean the the very god in flesh they killed him crucified him let his blood be on us i was watching those little dandelion things and those little seeds flying i thought oh god how great you are you have called your children from the east the west the north the south from different ages to produce a bride to produce a people and it's all because he chose us oh what a mighty god we serve when you're sick he still chose you when you're not feeling good he still chose you when you're not happy he still chose you amen remember that what that syrophoenician woman she came to him jesus thou son of david have mercy on my daughter she's a lunatic she's she's grievously vexed she was a gentile he was not sent then to the gentiles he was just addressing jews he looked at her he said it's not fit to give the children's bread to the dogs what he called me a dog you know a lot of people would ran got a lawyer right then i'm going to sue that guy he called me he called me a dog i'm gonna go get a committee and we're gonna what did she do when he put her in her place because she didn't have right to him as son of david she was a gentile only the jews have right to him and son of david when he said it's not fit to give the dog the give the children's bread to the dogs she said truth lord oh brother when he rebukes you when he screams at you when he challenges you just agree with him when he says you're guilty you're saying lord i'm sorry i admit i'm guilty i admit i can't search me o god see if there's any wicked way in me [Applause] at that last supper jesus said somebody in this room is going to betray me every disciple there said lord is it me not that guy is it is it them over there is it that guy is it me you'll do good when you search your own heart amen that's it a lot of times cancers sicknesses diseases are brought by self examination i'll wait till i'm 90 years old then maybe the blood test you need to examine yourself i don't know how long i've been here brother john i'll just i'll quit oh i'll hurry how's that i'm almost done almost done maybe the musicians no maybe not not yet 15 minutes okay 15 minutes this is in the message restoration of the bride tree brother branham said all that the winner killed that's hard to believe that the winner actually killed plants last winter it's been you know 70s 80s nice weather nice temperature last couple months but in the middle of december in the middle of january in the middle of february those same pretty flowers that you've cut and put in bases and they're dead they were under six inches of snow and ice but if there's a law of life in them when the heat from the sun hits them again it will bring forth life again the same law when he set the moon he set the sun that same law keeps them where they should be and it's the same law in you and me that keeps us right all that the winner killed the sun restores returning of the sun what does it do it forces it forces death listen when the sun the spring sun comes back in line to the earth it actually forces death to give up its dead earlier in this tape brother banham was telling about how a man came to the tabernacle in jeffersonville from georgia drove all the way up there had his car stolen while he was up there they came to brother branham said somebody stole the man's car let's pray brother branham while he was praying the lord showed him a vision he showed him a man wearing a yellow shirt driving to on the way to bowling green kentucky and god said turn around go back drop that car off on a certain street in louisville kentucky brother branham said he's not there yet but he's turning around and he's got your car you'll find your car on a certain street there in louisville what was it it was the agent of god brother branham was not the agent amen yeah right right it's the agent of god the holy ghost amen you have a secret agent the holy ghost and it was the agent enforcing the law and it winter time it looks pretty bleak sometimes it just looks like there's no way why do we still have so many mosquitoes i always heard that the winter supposed to kill them but there's just pretty plentiful this year it forces death to give up its dead a resurrection for what a restoration everything and nature works according to god's law death can't hold it anymore remember ezekiel 37 he showed ezekiel a valley full of bones dry bones son of man can these things live says oh god you know i i don't know god he says prophesy speak to the bones and what was laying there brittle and dry and dead god by his mercy brought back muscle brought back tenu brought back skin brought back amen and it actually said there was a lot there was a shaking and there was noise but they still didn't have life there's a lot of churches making a lot of noise but they still don't have the life of god when god breathes his spirit on us brother it's all the difference in the world if you have this law of life in you i'll just read a little bit more god has set all his laws to serve him both natural and spiritual according working according to his word regardless of the conditions regardless of the condition well brother bill you don't know regardless he says i love that i have a scripture god sets all his laws in motion think of it and the law of life that's in us will bring us to a resurrection i'm just skipping through this regardless he measures it three or four times here regardless of conditions regardless now i'm going to bring it home to you and to me because as much as i fail god he's a gentleman regardless of my mistakes all i have to do is repent go get a bar of that spirit soap lather up and keep it handy he said regardless of how little we are well i want to be the big guy i want to be number one i want teach me lord to wait while hearts are aflame help me humble my pride call on your name keep my faith renewed my eyes on thee help me be on this earth what you want me to be he told one of his prophets lay on your side for so many hundred days yeah but my church is i don't care lay on your side well it looks really lay on your side he laid on the side for hundreds today god said okay now lay on the other side what's that got to do with you it's what it has to do with is obedience learning to zip it yeah and listen to the boss regardless of how little we are regardless of how low we are how impure we are boy he's talking to me now how unholy we are how sick we are how afflicted we are i got it right here restoration and brag training the law of god's spirit by his word makes it obey him forces it regardless of conditions says give it back because why he has spoke a word he put a law with the word and the law is his own law his own life behind it that's the reason he swore by himself that's in hebrews 6. he swore he can't swear by moses he moses was a good guy i used moses a lot he can't swear by elijah elijah ran for his life he can't swear there's only one god looked through the only one he could trust altar together himself i got this i just swear and he swore by himself i started the work in you i will finish it now i'm going to close ephesians 1. verse three maybe if the musicians would come maybe we could sing that song reach out and touch the lord do you know that sister show ephesians 1 verse 3 blessed be the god

for i came down from heaven not to do mine own will but the will of him that sent me verse 39. and this is the father's will which has sent me that of all which he has given me i should lose nothing that should raise it up again at the last day raise it up when the last day verse 40. and this is the will of him that sent me that everyone which son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and i will raise him up at the last day when lester what's he going to do raise him up raise him up in the last day what because you're how much did you have to pay he paid the price he paid the debt he did not owe i owed a debt i could not pay he paid it all verse 44. at the camp meeting at the next convention brother we are in the last day if you read the message brother branham said the messengers come at the end of the age brother branham the messenger to this age came at the end of laodicea 54. who said whoever there's four different scriptures right there in saint john 6 jesus is referring to raising somebody up it can be you i was so spaced out on drugs i was so far gone it didn't look there was a great big rubber band in my life hooked onto my heart i ran from god i turned from god i fought against god and the farther i went away from god the tighter that rubber band got it and one day he just gave it a big jerk come home my child i'll read one more saint john 7 37 in the last day that great what day the last day that great day of the feast jesus stood and whispered he cried if i could cry it's loud 19 september in vietnam i was in a perimeter with 19 men the enemy didn't like us because we had a bad habit of shooting the enemy you know the devil doesn't like you he doesn't like you women the right kind of clothes he doesn't he doesn't he doesn't like you go to church that's for sure well you can go along to sleep or as long as you yeah 19 of us we didn't have electricity we didn't have running water we didn't have anything out there we had guns and we had each other i'm thankful i had a praying mom and dad this is karen i had a big big pouch of marijuana in my pocket cigarettes i was a sinner i was a renegade but i was a son of god didn't look like one didn't act like one but i was one i just took my time on guard duty my watch was from three in the morning till 5am by 5am it was light then it got safe again you know people when this coped first came out people were misquoting brother branham and just coming up with these special super super quotes you know don't take don't take the message out of context don't take the bible out of context my goodness well brother adam said are you sure he said that right are you sure he's well that guy that shirt said exactly who are you going to listen say what the tape says three o'clock i just got on guard there was three of us one here one back where that guy is one over here on this by this corner of the building our perimeter wasn't 35 yards wide it was real small but the trick was we had a fourth guy kind of like the hebrews had a fourth man in the furnace in the furnace we had a fourth man that was the roving guard and he would go to spud we called him spud because he was from idaho a potato spud swanstrom he'd go to spud it's dark it's so dark you can't see your hand from your face spud don't shoot i'm coming over this is this is galvin galvin was on the roving guard that night spud he's over there bunker number one he goes over to bunker number two tom motion was bunker number two tom don't shoot this is galvin the bunker was no higher than this platform i mean it wasn't like 40 feet up in the air don't shoot this is this galvan coming over okay because you don't know who's coming over that perimeter they come in with a knife nice and quiet no guns no flashlights not making a bunch of noise not waving flags i was on the third bunker doc i was the medic so they call me doc doc this is galvin don't shoot galvin was over by me about that time tom motion bunker number two he said i think something's in the wire we had barbed wire we had trip flyers in our wire the slightest little breeze would set a flare off you just take your m16 and clear the ground you didn't have to ask questions you just opened fire because a lot of times it wasn't the wind it might have been a monkey it might have been a rat but it might have been the enemy yeah galvin was over by me sergeant motion tom motion said i think something's in the wire well we also had little handheld flares they look like little fireworks displays that you can buy at the big tent down the corner a little firework it light up for 10 seconds the little phosphorous green or it's just enough to get a glimpse of what's in the area but it's only for a couple seconds and so galvin said go ahead put a flare up see if there's something in the wire because when they come in they're not running through they are deliberate i think the bible says in the book of jude that certain men have crept in unaware read it for what it's worth there's a lot of things creep into our life tom motion shot that flare in this guy if i could yell as loud as he yelled and i would prepare you that i'm going to yell it would still scare you i have never in my life heard a human being yell as loud as tom motion yelled that night there's gooks in the wire i looked up there's a standing there with a rocket on his shoulder went down on his knee coming right at me oh my goodness my marijuana my cigarettes i'm if i die now i don't want to die with that i don't want to die i quit smoking 23 times why i was a paratrooper i jumped out of airplanes 23 times and i thought if i die i don't want a carton of cigarettes i don't want a pack of cigarettes in my shirt pocket so i quit every time before i jumped and i get on the ground say hey man you got a cigarette like borrow give me give a smoke but the 24th time it was for real it wasn't just for me it's because i wanted to be a christian and if i could duplicate how jesus cried because he knew the urgency of the hour he didn't just whisper he cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water are you okay sister cheryl i didn't mean to take so long he still i believe we're in the last day there's no more messengers no more angels it's it's done it's so that part is over now we just got to get ready go home i had a dream a few months back we were around the great throne of god people were just rejoicing no more fears no more worries in this one group it was their turn got opened the door guys you never heard saying guys you never heard shout you never heard him cry they were just rejoicing coming jump 20 feet in the air that's just happy and then i thought oh god how how wonderful it is how how beautiful then the angel came and he looked right at me he said you guys are next oh brother sister don't compromise on the word of
