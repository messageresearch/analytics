[Music] I love that song where would we be without the anchor foreign we would be drifting here and there in our men's meeting our brother um Ferguson was talking about staying in the boundaries of the word it is truly our anchor and it keeps us from drifting off and kind of doing our own thing and David said I hide I word in my heart thou not sin against thee we need this precious word is an anchor to our souls if I say Merry Christmas to everyone and shalom to the bride amen amen this is our Christmas service and I'm thankful to the Lord for all you that have made it it's good to have some back from sickness and we still have some outs our heart goes out to those that are not here and some are are battling a covet or the virus and that is bad and and I think of our sister Kathleen some of those songs that we were singing today she just loves and think that she's just been going through such a hard trial long trial and um we just need to remember our sister in in prayer and our brother Marty you could just see their hearts are just yearning for the Lord to give them strength and peace and to help them and we believe in a God that can do that let's pray that God would be with them amen well turn with me if you if you would to the book of Saint Luke Chapter 2 for their opening scriptures it's good to see Brother Bruce we know in do more services or so we won't be able to see him for a while and uh we just appreciate him and let's continue to pray for brother and sister Johnson that God would just be their strength their comfort their encouragement amen good to see brother Jason amen praise the Lord before we begin reading let's let's just bow in a word of prayer Heavenly Father Lord we humbly pray for your presence to be Mighty among us today Lord we know that we need ears to hear we can't hear what you're saying so we ask that you would take away any thoughts of the day any problems of the past any Ambitions of the future anything that would steer us away or distract us away from the thought you would have for us tonight father we pray that we could have the mind of Christ today that we could just uh settle down in our spirits and and just get in touch with you get in sync with you father we pray that you'd prepare every heart and Lord that you would bless this mind and these lips to speak those things that Lord would connect right to the heart of your people and father we ask that you would be with those Lord that are in their homes that would desire to be here but Lord something is holding them back some sickness and Lord You're greater than all sickness I pray that your presence would be with them in their homes Lord that you would be their strength you'd be their comfort and Lord just bless them in a special way we pray father we commit disservice and all the needs all of our needs whether it be physical Financial whatever they be Lord we commit them into the god that we surrendered our heart in life to now ask all these things in Jesus Christ's precious name amen amen Saint Luke Chapter 2 we're going to start with verse number seven and Mary and Joseph went to Nazareth to be taxed while they were there Mary gave birth to Jesus and she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a Manger because there was no room for them in the end and there we're in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night and lo the angel of the Lord Came Upon them and the glory of the Lord Shone about them and they were sore afraid and the angels said unto them fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people For unto you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the lord and this shall be a sign unto you you shall find the babe a wrapped in swallowing clothes lying in a manger and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of heavenly holes praising God and saying glory to God in the highest and on Earth peace in Good Will toward men and came to pass as the Angels were gone away from them into heaven the shepherd said one to another let us go uh go even unto Bethlehem and see this thing which is come to pass which the Lord have made known unto us and they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph and the Babe Lane and the major and when they had seen him they had made known abroad saying which was told them concerning this child and all they that heard it wandered at those things which were told them by the Shepherds amen God bless you you may be seated amen in Matthew chapter 1 verses 22 and 23 I want to read this Matthew chapter 1 verse 22 and 23 now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the lord of the Lord by the prophets saying Behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name a manual which is being interpreted is God With Us so I think that kind of sums up a little bit I should say of the reading that we had here this is uh obviously about the the birth of of of Jesus Christ but yet it was the gift of God given to mankind like to entitle this message receiving the gift of Christ this great event was Christ to the masses and if I could say that's where they got that word Christmas is Christ to the mass it was peace and Good Will toward men the Bible says it was good tidings of great joy to all people it was the birth of a savior which was Christ the lord and uh the thing I've thought often thought about is that Christ is viewed more as a Christmas present than as a relationship in the world and sometimes those that way of looking uh at Christ can come the same way uh Even in our walk with the Lord now the Angels did not say one thing about the requirement of salvation right they just shared the good news of God's Gift uh had come and even though the Shepherds didn't understand the requirements of Salvation at this point they were telling everyone about the good news of the Savior was born and that the Savior was the Lord Jesus Christ and the Bible says all they that heard it wandered at those things which were told them by the Shepherds so they were still sharing the good news that that Christ he is the savior he he is the uh Jesus Christ as Lord the Bible says in Acts 4 verse 12 neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under Heaven given among men whereby we must be saved there is no other way to to receive eternal life than through Jesus Christ like the angels and like the Shepherds when we're sharing Christ with others we want to share the good news and after someone has received the good news then we've got to give them the other part of the good news which is the requirements but it's not looked at so much as good news but it's still the whole Bible is good news and that's what Paul and all the apostles did and and that's what really brought all the persecution is when they began to talk about the requirements if you just if you just talked about God you know gave himself for the whole world and he's our savior and and uh you know you can make it and well there's no persecution in that sharing the good news brings Good Tidings of great joy but sharing the requirements that's what brings the persecution and that's why there's some churches that stay away from the requirements and just share the other part and that makes you feel good unfortunately there's too many people sharing Christ as a Christmas present right usually when we get a Christmas present there's no strings attached it's just a gift you don't know anything you don't got to do nothing you don't like it put it in the closet you like it wear it share it it's yours to do what you want but that's not the way credit is with Christ but they they share Christ in part they share God died for your sins that you couldn't do anything to save yourself that without him you're lost he paid the penalty for the sins of the whole world and these are all true statements they're all accurate but they stop there many of them stop there they're all good tidings of great joy but if we stop there and we don't share the requirements the gift of Christ will be portrayed as a Christmas present God died for us at Calvary a Christmas present here it is just just receive it it's much lighter than a relationship then God has requirements for us the very gift of God spoke out about the necessary requirements when he said unless you forsake mother and father sister brother husband wife you can't follow me unless you deny your own will you can't follow me unless you pick up your cross you can't follow me unless you lose your life you'll not be saved now this is not the way that people View the gift that God had given man they they view so many people view that God gave Jesus Christ to die on the cross for their sins and it was freely given and there was nothing they could do to save themselves and it stops right there and unfortunately you're taking up part of the Gospel and if you take part out that part part will be taken out of the book of life amen so you need to hear what God had to say what Christ had to say it the very gift that came and presented himself told us the requirements the Angels were sharing Good Tidings of great joy to all people imagine that these angels painted another picture about this baby being born saying something like this that this this gift is going to be rejected of men despised oppressed smitten of God and Afflicted it was going to be crucified by the world who wouldn't accept the requirements now that one is seen like such a a great message from the Angels it wouldn't seem like Good Tidings of great joy it would sound like that it wasn't good news but when God gives us his word he expects us to receive the word amen to walk in the light as he gives the light and then we really have fellowship with him when the time had arrived even his own disciples struggled with the news that he would suffer in Matthew chapter 16 verse 21 he says from that time forth beget Jesus to show unto his disciples how he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things and the Elders of the chief priests and scribes and be killed and raised again the third day and then Peter took him Peter took them I mean I can imagine he just kind of grabbed him by the collar took him shoved him up against hey I got to get a hold of your attention you're not speaking the good news be it far from thee Lord this shall not be unto thee this was not the way of good news this is what was not good tidings of great joy this was not the way of a savior this was not peace and Good Will unto all men it left the disciples feeling lost alone troubled and we must understand that there's the whole word of God is what God gave us to live by and we cannot fall under the the the the Smorgasbord of just taking what we want to take of the Bible and saying that I'm bride and and and I'm predestinated we've been predestinated to fulfill the word right we've been predestined to manifest the word we've been we've been we've been we're the elect is the ones that are going to go all the way easy to stand back like all the other churches who don't even know the message and say I have received Christ in my life and are not living the word but Jesus turned and said unto them Peter get thee behind me Satan Thou Art in offense unto me for thou savior is not the things that be of God but the but those that be of men the things that be of God or his acquire his requirements his will the things that be of men are Christmas presents give me without any responsibility give to me without me having to give up anything without having to do anything the good news the word of God and flesh had spoken and was being rejected by his own disciples God was about ready to tear down the middle petition between man and God because of sin and here their own disciples didn't understand that and they were coming against it in John chapter 1 verse 11. he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to that person to those people to then gave he power to become sons of God even to them that believe on his name you know a lot of people will take that well I believe and I'm a son of God but they're missing the power they have a form of godliness but they're denying the power thereof when you truly believe you will have power to manifest yourself as God as a Son of God as a daughter of God I'm just trying to get your attention by saying it like that but it isn't okay I've been baptized I got this plaque I'm putting it on the wall I'm a Son of God I'm in the message it's not like that and too many people are falling for that when there should be uh an expectation inside of those who have received him to become him to manifest him the Bible says it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he show up here we shall be like him and the whole earth is groaning and waiting for this manifestation and if we're not seeing that power in our lives we need to get underneath and be calling upon God and say God this is what your word says [Music] that next verse really explains why some people don't have the power which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God amen no I'm just going to be honest with you that these children here do not live in my home they're not my sons and daughters and they don't have to do my will because they live in another home they have a different father but if they lived in my home they would do my will is that true Anne there's there's no doubt about that at any age and the thing is if we're born of God we will be doing the will of God Amen that's just all there is to it and the thing is too many people are claiming this Christ it's a Christmas present and they're bypassing whether they even have to follow suit with the with doing what the word says they let the devil trick them and think that this doesn't matter that doesn't matter it's okay if I don't do that and God sees this and we're just all human and it just that list is endlessly before you know it everybody's their own church everybody's their own believer but all yet claiming born again that's why we need to be fruit inspectors we need to make sure that we're following the heart of the message the heart of the Bible from cover to cover I say is the heart of the Bible it's from cover to cover but you know what I'm saying don't it's not about pulling eight scriptures out and saying these are great I believe these it's about pulling out the other million that we're not doing and saying I need to be doing these and that dovetails together right it's got to dovetail together aren't you glad that God gave you and I the opportunity to become a Son of God become a daughter of God where would we be if God did not send somebody our way to tell us about the truth I'm so thankful that we can really believe on him Believe In The Name of Jesus you know many people use that name in vain they they use it for a show they use it for so many reasons but they don't cherish it and and come humbly subject to that name you know someone who wants to receive Christ and have the power to become a son or daughter of God we want to share with them the good news but after they receive the good news we want to share with them the requirements come here because it really is a two-way street it's not a Christmas gift all of us are starting to get gifts probably of some degree we're going to get gifts somewhere around Christmas right I say for the most part we get something nobody's going to ask us do you want this gift if not I'm not going to give it to you unless they open up they say come on you know I already got I I told you I got one of those but what I'm saying is you're going to hand the gift you're going to get receive a gift and that's it and when we read about that word in the Bible the gift of God the gift we think of the gift that same way we not that we can do anything to earn anything but if we we receive Christ today we do everything we can today we plead the blood today we surrender to Christ today I believe we're as just as clean and pure and the sight of God as can be because the blood of Christ makes us that way but if he gives us time to live after that day and we do not continue to walk in the light that he gives us for the next day the next week the next month and we decide that we're just going to kind of begin to do our own will again well I'm sorry friends but as the the way the tree falls that's the way it lies we've got to continue on the course you just got to you're playing with fire and danger and and once saved always save it doesn't matter and God loves me and he's not changing his love for me and it gets into so many things and that's why God set a prophet to straighten that stuff out to make it clear and God has blessed us with the truth to help others who don't have the truth there was a a religious man named Nicodemus the Bible says he came to Jesus by night and this word that was made flesh in Christ Jesus discerned the thoughts and intents of his heart and he said unto him verily I say unto you except a man be born again he could not see the kingdom of God amen well before it was here's good news here's the Savior he's come he went to Calvary we didn't even ask him to now the same Jesus is telling us that we got to become born again it's not a it's not separate it's just part of it's part of the Salvation that he brought to us it's part of the it's part of the good news amen as many as receive the gift of God to them gave he power to become the sons of God you know just getting baptized and just saying I I believe I've confessed with my mouth and I believe doesn't give you salvation doesn't give you power it doesn't you've got to believe with everything that you got the gift is not a Christmas present right this peace and goodwill towards all men is not a Christmas present the gift of God is not a present you know we've had to preach the Christmas message for I don't know how many years now and you can never preach the same way you know anybody that's ever her sister Kathleen's probably one that's heard from the beginning you'll never hear two the same how can you say you believe on his name and you don't want to come to church now I'm not necessary I'm not speaking to anybody here and I may not be speaking to anybody in the church it could be just simply somebody who's live streaming that doesn't go to this church but maybe you do how can you say you believe on his name but you don't want to come prepare before service how can you say you believe on his name you don't want to pay tithes you don't want to dress right you don't want to help the infirmities of the weak you don't want to help the church how can you say you believe on his name how can you say you believe on his name and gossip and hold grudges and cut your hair paint your face taught behind people's back and say you believe on his name calm your savior how can you rebel against the word of God when you know what you should be doing and say you believe on his name it's another gospel that you're thinking of another spirit I'll say it like this the Devils have that same belief and they tremble they believe on the name of Jesus the devil's they know the authority of that name when it's spoken by faith they know who the savior of man's soul is they know that's why they're doing everything they can to try to hinder people from believing the right way he's getting the majority of them to believe in a false way many will come to me in that day and say Lord Lord didn't I do this that and the other I never knew you they didn't want to give all their heart to God they don't mind if God gives all of his heart to them help me keep me from my sins help me get to heaven provide all my needs down here but as far as me giving my heart to you that's what we struggle with on a daily basis and the only way that we can succeed on that is to Die daily you cannot give your all to Christ without dying that day you can't you either serve one or the other that day we want to say We believe We want to say he's our savior we're quick to say that but are we quick to say I'm dead to myself and I'm suffering for the cause of Christ when we receive God he gives the believer power to become to begin to manifest the word to show everybody else that you're different than what you used to be by this shall all men know you're my disciples there is a power when the love of God comes in your heart you begin to lay down your life for the cause of Christ amen God's gift to mankind is not a Christmas present the peace that he has for us amen The Good Will unto all men it's not a Christmas present the gift is for believers now I will say this that God's spirit his love and His blessings they do fall in the just and the unjust because that's just the goodness of God but when we're talking about a savior when we're talking about power to become a Son of God well there's some interaction that needs to take place there's some requirements that comes from God and that I'll say it like this when he gives us the requirements that's light that's light that we didn't have and as he gives us that light we walk in it and as we walk in it he gives you power he's looking for one thing from from the believer and that's truly his heart's desire to please him three more agency if you are willing to to to love me from your heart I will give you what you need to walk this walk amen no doubt about it we don't got to muster it up we don't gotta it's all him but he's looking for our heart and he knows our heart amen how can you truly have peace without accepting Christ the word we live in a world where peace is a necessity with all the craziness that's going on he is our peace the Bible says For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulders and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace he is our peace how many people long for peace but they don't want to do the requirements of peace they don't want to keep their minds stayed on the lord it's too hard to do they don't want to think on these things that are of a good report and true and and holy and pure and lovely and they don't want to do the things that Paul said Paul said do the things that I've done what you've seen me do do and the God of Peace will be with you there's requirements alone it's requirements to manifest God in this hour we got to accept the word the word is Christ and this word needs to become more important to us than what it is in fact as the days go further and we get closer this word needs to become more precious to us we need to we need to open this book and say God I need you right now speak to me speak to me out of your word now he can take this letter which if your heart is not in it it's a dead letter but you get your heart your your heart where it needs to be in your relationship with Christ and you say God speak to me all sudden this dead letter becomes life amen it becomes real it becomes life to you and if you sincerely accept this word into your heart and say God I want to do it he will change your nature he will begin to you know this born-again experience it may start at a certain time but it can lay dormant for a long time it cannot go through there's many people who started the race but didn't finish and you've got to keep walking in New Light the more you're anxious and excited about walking in the light that's presented to you the more you're going to grow in Christ second Corinthians chapter 5 verse 16. if you accept the word Christ the word into your life he will begin to change your nature if you continue to yield to him he will continue to change your nature and the moment that you stop he stops he doesn't keep going it doesn't matter if we come and sit in church I think brother Mark was telling us he heard someone say that there's going to be a lot of time there's going to be tithepayers in hell so you can continue doing part of the word and still not your nature not be changing so we're interested in seeing change in our life that to me is the most exciting thing where once I I I wanted to get rid of this thing I I didn't want it my life but for some reason it just stayed there and to see that prayer go before the Lord help me with this Lord I really know this is not you you don't want this and I'm calling upon you and I'm seeking you for help that is what really brings the Simplicity of a change nature verse 16 second Corinthians 5 16 wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh though we have known Christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we him know more we don't know Christ anymore from a Bible study we don't even know him anymore from somebody just telling us something about him we know Christ in a personal way now therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature not he knows more about the Bible right he doesn't know the stories more he doesn't know the quotes more he he's a new creature so something is something is changing brother Mark ministered unchanging in our in our men's meeting today changing old things are passed away and behold all things are become new and all things are of God whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa I thought it was just Good Tidings of of of of of of of of of joy and peace and a savior's born and and that's all there was to it no now a man has to give up his whole will to do all the will of God and it's something that we face on a daily basis and if we're just honest with yourself and we take time do we do we do the will of God are we doing are we seeking the will of God are we just seeking to have God part of our life and doing our own will because if that is really what's happening we're looking at Christ too much as a Christmas present as a present and not God's life given to us God became us that we could become him and so it's it's it's not God God became us so he could give us eternal life you know we've got to become him when we go to heaven he wants us to be just like him so the for those of you who are not willing to obey the word of God need to reflect on your belief here Jesus said in John 5 39 search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they that testify of me brother around we're sharing that with me I believe last service Jesus said in 1412 John 14 12 verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go to my father so there is an old nature that just is continuing to shed away and even though Maybe like we're not going to have service this Sunday some of us have missed services some of us go on vacation some of us are going to have surgery we still got to continue to build Christ in our life we've got to find a way to get that word inside and nature needs to continue to change through our trials through our test the works I do shall he do also see all things become of God all things verse 18. and all things are of God who have reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ here's God's gift to us and has given us the ministry of reconciliation we'll get to that here in a second to wit that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespass is unto them see there's God's gift to the world and is committed unto us the word of reconciliation when the Holy Spirit cometh unto us the word of reconciliation that's the responsibility that God has given to us so this gift comes with a responsibility because he's he's wanting to reconcile the whole world but he's not here in the flesh anymore so he's using us and I'll tell you I know it's hard I know it gets lonely I I I know it it just seems frustrating because people don't want God enough but I'm telling you as long as we're here we need to be sharing Christ with as many people as possible [Music] just like the Shepherds did bring in the good news of God's gift to others just share it share it you can't get out get on the phone text somebody but just start sharing Jesus with somebody because if you don't focus on that you're going to drift off in your own little world right and believing all of our worlds they got problems they got problems and we need God to help us verse 20 says now then we like the Shepherds were our ambassadors for Christ as though God did beseech You by us we pray you in Christ that be reconciled to God so brother Mann said that we backslide a hundred times a day that means if I backslide I'm I need to be reconciled I need to be reconnected to God and all of those 100 times that we backslide and it might be a lot more now in our in our thoughts and in the things that we do um we probably don't even recognize them a lot of them because we get so caught up in pretty much thinking that we're right every man's right in his own eyes so what is there to to to to reconcile with but look we've been predestinated to carry this message to others we we who are serving God if we're backsliding what about those who aren't pressing in and they need to be reconciled and by you caring about somebody enough to share Jesus with them you're fulfilling the will of God brother Brandon said Mission work is always in the will of God we can be doing that in our homes in our in our neighborhood and and at work but you talk about predestinated we're predestinated to carry this message to reconcile others that's what we're predestinated to we're elected we're chosen of God to carry this word to somebody how can we be part of God's elect and not do that right not be concerned about it how can we we focus on wanting God to be concerned about us but we're not concerned of others how can that be God's gift is not a Christmas present it's a life that lives inside of us so as much as you believe God is concerned about you you must be that concerned about others because that same Christ lives in you can't separate that you can't have this life over here for yourself in some other life for somebody else we are the chosen ones we are the elect lady that is that carries the word to somebody else we definitely live in a world of people hurting that need the love of Christ now those that believe in God's Gift in some other way that's being presented tonight I just want to say we need to get back to Christ we need to reflect on our intimate relationship with Christ just how intimate is it because God's Gift of Christ is not a Christmas present to us it's ready for those who believe and Paul said of an Angel or myself come preaching any other gospel then what has already been presented let him be a curse and we know there's so many people who will focus on only part of the word the part that appeals to so many people but then their nature doesn't change and and really they're the ones that's going to be heard at the end and to have God use you to pull one out of the fire here to pull one out of the fire there that's glorious just one soul just one so helping one sold her eyes to come open now a Believer can't walk any higher than what he has received from Christ is that true amen while man is trying to build a man-made religion God is building his church by revelation so it's hard to grow in Christ if we're not receiving the revelation of the word I wish your church attendance and ties and you know just the easy thing of of this that and the other could get the job done but we need revelation and the just shall live by faith and we need to be focused on receiving the faith of the word that's being precious we come to church because a Believer cannot walk any higher or any closer or any more with God than the receiving of God because the knowledge of God won't do it how many people have got the knowledge that go the seminaries they debate they go back and forth but there's no life all right Colossians chapter 2. are you getting a little something out of this praise the Lord help us to get through this Colossians chapter 2 starting with verse 6 as ye therefore as ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord sawaki and him that's pretty that's pretty clear as you've received this gift of God now walk in them wear it walk in it live it Proclaim it share the good news walk in the light this true gift that God has given us is to be walked in to be displayed For unto you is born this day into the city of David a savior which is Christ Jesus the Lord so as you've received Jesus Christ the lord so walk ye in him walk in him verse 7 rooted and built up in him established in the faith as ye have been taught abounding therein with Thanksgiving the believer who never gets rooted in Christ will never be able to get built up in Christ he just won't be able to knowledge won't do it Jesus said because as soon as some hard trial comes some Temptation they would begin to break away from where they once were because their Roots were not deep enough to hold them down so it's imperative in this important to get keep getting the roots to go down get the roots to go down and build up the leaves build up the the the branches build up your life establish in the faith if it's hard to have faith in what you're going through find one small thing that you can have faith in and believe for that call somebody pray with them and say I'm believing with you and start building your faith because the Bible says build your yourselves up in the Most Holy Faith you can't expect not to uh you can't expect to receive faith if you're not building your faith in the greatest way to receive faith is when you hear the word say that's for me because faith is when God speaks to you personally and you take it personally you don't say well yeah I know that's the word that's not what I'm going that's not what I need you know what just have an attitude that God I'm here God I'm here whatever you'd have for me each and every time you receive Christ the word God's gift becomes more you become more rooted and you become more built up it is that simple it's not so much have you heard this before it's which part do we need to be reminded of which part do we need to be doing which part if we let slip away we just need to start building our lives around the world get more serious with the word when you get up in the morning you you just say God I'm just going to read one verse and I'm trusting you that that one verse you're going to speak to me and and you're gonna it's gonna be real clear what you want me to do and I'm going to do it that day something like that to where is not just so General General no get specific get get get get intimate get close because we've got to start finding out what God wants us to do every day and begin to do it continually bounding the Bible says there with with Thanksgiving so you're rooted you're built up established as you have been taught abounding with Thanksgiving I wonder how many has abounded with Thanksgiving just just today just abounded one bound I mean not just not just gave thanks but you can say I abounded in it see this is a hard one for us because we're facing so many problems so many so many things that we got to deal with but when you can start abounding in Thanksgiving you're trusting God for your situation that you know God is with it no matter how hard it is and you can just say thank you Lord sincerely because God promised I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you this thing that we're going through it could be for our faith to test us to see where we're going to be we don't know all that is behind it but what we do know is that God is with us and that just that just should make it so much easier for us we have not received Christ Jesus as a Christmas present those that receive Jesus Christ as a Christmas present don't walk in him but we that have received him as a person as a personal intimate he died for me and I'm going to live for him well we walk in him amen as we receive Christ as a new life a new nature will begin to develop around us and we will begin to see things change in our life but we have to continually continually desire that not just once at the beginning and we can't keep getting baptized every day right so what we can do though is keep saying God I want more of you I want to grow more in you I want this this habit out I want to start uh laying down my life for others I want to start reaching out for other Souls because we've received the Life of Christ not some present but the life we received eternal life and brother Branham said eternal life was really living for others you basically don't have anything to do with it it's not about your will what you got going what you want is he accomplished it is nothing to do with you eternal life is when you're actually laying down yourself to go help somebody and there's there's a big need there there's a big need there I'll say we don't start eternal life doesn't start when we get to heaven right eternal life starts now you start living for others now you don't wait till you get to the other side amen Colossians chapter 2 verse 6 as you therefore receive Christ Jesus the Lord saw walking and rooted built up and established in the faith as you've been taught abounding there with it with Thanksgiving here's verse 8 beware lest any man spoil you to vote to philosophy okay seduce you through the study of knowledge and reasoning that's what that means bewareless any man seduce you through the study of knowledge and reasoning and vain deceit after the tradition of men after the rudiments of the world and not after Christ so if an angel come preaching any preaching the word of God is a Christmas present one-sided well let me be accursed the years they're seducing Spirits out there presenting only the part of the Gospel and it's a philosophy it's a it's it's vain deceit it's it's a tradition of men it's the rudiments of the world and I tell you the Bible says it'll spoil you it'll spoil your relationship with Christ it will seduce you I think Galatians 5 7 says you did run well who did hinder you that you should not obey the truth amen this persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you so it's some other seed that came in and and trying to to mix it in trying to you know the devil as much as you know we hear the the gospel preach whether it's you know coming to church here or reading the Bible or listening to the tapes and and the word is calling us to a more consecrated walk with him all the time that's the spirit of God behind it and the devil is constantly working against that through everything else like that's really not that necessary that's going too far that's too much this is all you need to do and those are the spirits that we're wrestling against now watch this in verse 9 this is the same theme this is not a different subject for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily and you are complete in him which is the head of all principalities and power so if the fullness dwelt in Jesus Christ and as you've receive Jesus Christ so walk in him you are complete in him you have what it takes to live the life you have what it takes to be an overcomer you have the power you can't separate um you can't separate the Life of Christ with with with um the word you can't separate the Life of Christ by just uh from your from your life because as you've received Christ the Bible says you're complete in him it's up to you to believe that you can't you don't let something spoil you or deceit you through reasoning and and knowledge and thinking that it can be separated you are one with him that means you can expect yourself to be an overcomer amen now tell all certain things to keep you down or or keep you discouraged but that you might at times have to encourage yourself in the Lord that's true it seems that you have to do that more and more because the love of many is waxing cold but you're still completing him you've received the complete package the complete package your gift from God shall supply all of your needs according to his riches in Glory by Christ Jesus now that's the word of God that happens when you believe that happens when you receive the gift now you receive the gift of God and you're completing him now you can do all things through Christ who strengtheneth you amen you don't need anything else you may not be able to to handle things but remember he can and he's in you and you're completing him and so whatever you need lies within you even though your brain says I don't know what to do and I don't know how to handle this and I don't know how to please and I don't know how to hold you must believe he's in you you must believe he's complete in you that he will supply every need [Music] you may not have what you need right now I understand that but you have the promise he will supply your needs you have the complete package he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave him power to become even to them that believe on his name I'm believing the word of God this is what the word says and I'm believing no we have to be careful we have to be careful about this belief we want the belief to be very rooted very we want that we want our belief to be forever um we understand what happened about um the sons of skiva and they they took the name of Jesus and they wanted to cast out uh uh a devils and that demon spoke out and said Jesus I know Paul I know Jesus I know but who are you but yet they were acting like they believed and so I just say this we know the word tells us that God will supply our needs and that we can do all things through Christ and that he has given his power and we should stand on the word but know this of assuredly that when you stand there you will be tested so it's not about how much you can claim it right this moment but it's how much you can stand there after you've claimed it and this is so important because we will be tried you've got to remain in that place of firmness that God said it I believe it and I'm not I'm not deterring from here I am not getting off this I'm staying right here if God has promised me that I'm going to be like him I'm standing right here if God said that he'll he'll he he wants me to walk in the light then he'll give me power to walk in the word that just came forth he's given his power to walk in his word to walk into the authority of his word to walk in the power of His word and I'll say it like this I want my life to be more pleasing to the Lord I want to walk in the light of the word as he gives it to me when we truly receive the word we have power to walk in it it's only when we got the knowledge of we received the knowledge of the word or the reasoning of the word and we truly don't take the love of it into our hearts we've got to fall in love with the word I mean just love this word I love the word I love the word I love coming to church and hearing the word I love the realness of the word I love how it speaks to me how it just gets into my heart and it it Pricks me and it it washes me and it cleanses me and it directs my life and it gives me just what I need too many people only want the Christmas present the this these needs be met these wishes this this list this this this that I have and I I I know God loves us so much he wants to give us everything he wants us to prosper and everything but God wants something so much more and that's a relationship now that's the part that only we can give we can only give our heart God will never take it he will never he won't do it the key is having a deeper love for the word now we're going to be closing with this John 14 verse 21. John 14 21 he that hath my Commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved to my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him now you can take this whole world but don't take that from me take everything I have but don't take that from me that is my life that's what means the most to me once you lose your love relationship things go south in your relationship with God that's when wrong things start coming in that's when Ron desires start coming that's when you stop caring about others you got to get back to the very root of love Judas saith unto him now to scare it Lord how is it that thou will manifest thyself to us and not to the world how are you gonna how are you gonna do this thing where we all won't see it only some of us will it's so easy it's man's love for the word if you love the word God will manifest himself to you is that it and the person next to us in the world not loving the word is not going to see Christ it's not going to have Christ manifested it's all through free more agency Jesus answered and said unto him if a man loves me he will keep my words and my father will love him and will come unto him and make our bold with him now if God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that was the love of God manifested but that's not what we're talking about here we're talking about taking this gift that God has given and making a relationship out of it taking it to the point that you will continue to keep his word not just Lord I'm sorry for my sins get baptized and and and and and and now you're a sound or daughter of God no it's about building a relationship that the next time you come to church you know God's got a word for you because God is not a God who don't care about us he's a God that has a word for us it is our flesh and it's the spirit that get honest and the things that we listen to and the reason and the knowledge that seduces us and think that it's not that big a deal and then we miss out why we're not manifesting more the love of God if you love God you will love his word let's Stand Together we are a blessed people amen we're not a people that wander in darkness spalled by the philosophy of an easier way or seduced by the devil's deceit or tricked into thinking we don't need anything we have received the power of God because we view this beautiful gift that God sent is not a Christmas present but it's a relationship that you know what we have the control like some of us think it's too hot or too cold in here right so this is the control tower right here we can control if we want it hotter or cooler we can control how much we're going to manifest Christ right the promise is right there just love the word keep the word before you know it you're manifesting it that's his word it's not my word my words will fail I can't even keep my word but God keeps his word amen amen amen let's it's our heads in a in a word of prayer if you feel this way God has spoken to you just hold that before the Lord as we go to him in prayer Heavenly Father Lord I believe that we've all come short in one time or another viewing things not in the balance that you wanted us to we're so grateful that you came and provided an opportunity for us to surrender Our Lives to you and Lord from that moment that we have we got baptized we repented of our sins you washed us clean Lord we've drifted off as it were many times that God we're here today confessing we need you you promised to give grace to the humble and Lord we're just humbling ourselves before you tonight I know Lord we know each one of us knows we need you we need you I need you and I thank you for your Mercies in our life Lord each day we thank you for your mercy we thank you for your grace we thank you for your love and your long-suffering we thank you for not giving up on us but Lord you have proved your your faithfulness to us you have proved to us over and over again that we belong to you we are your sons and your daughters and Lord we're asking you today for the that you would give us the grace to give ourselves more to you to love your word more than we have to take a special interest in in you this Christmas is we're going through this seizing of giving and buying and wrapping and and sharing uh gifts Lord may we think about this treasure that we have inside of us that through the promises of of your word we can escape the the the uh the the the the terrible nature Lord that we have been born with and can can live a a closer walk with you than we did Lord in the past because Lord you're still on the throne you're still alive you're still moving in the hearts of your people and Lord we are believers in you Lord we are believers we're Believing on your name and you promise to give us power and Lord we're needing power in our life I pray that you'd give it to us Lord to each one that is looking to you right now in prayer and saying God I want Power for this certain thing I pray that you'd give it to them Lord whatever they're asking for just one day at a time lord just one need at a time Lord You're that real and I believe that you answer prayer Lord for those that are in their homes those that are listening those that are watching Lord if there's some something on their heart father they're just claiming that uh Lord that they are complete in you I pray that you'd give them power over lord whatever they're asking that they could perhaps be what you want them to be to be more faithful to be full of the uh the power of God in their lives Lord use us Lord use us we surrender ourselves to you we thank you now for all these things we thank you for the great gift that you have given us or we thank you for the Holy Ghost do we thank you
