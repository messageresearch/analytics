[12:31] no sacrifice.

[15:22] Beckman, Sister Lynn, Sister Linda, some
[15:25] of us older ones, there's meaning in
[15:28] that song.
[15:31] It's not just a short relationship. It's
[15:34] a life relationship. Well, ultimately
[15:36] it's a eternal relationship.
[15:39] Amen.
[15:40] &gt;&gt; Fill my cup, Lord. Amen.
[15:44] You'll fill it.
[15:46] Fill my cup,
[15:50] Lord.

[17:56] Thank you. Amen. Well, I just like to
[17:58] change order of service. Amen. Our
[18:00] sister Linda has a request. Please
[18:02] continue to pray for restoration of
[18:05] Michael's marriage and for the pain to
[18:08] ease up in my arm. Amen.
[18:11] Well,
[18:13] we will do for both of them. But it's so
[18:16] good to see our sister here, even though
[18:19] she has pain in her arm,
[18:22] for she knows where her healing comes
[18:24] from. Amen.
[18:27] Let's just lift up all those that are
[18:29] struggling. Amen. All those that aren't
[18:31] here for whatever reason it would be.
[18:34] Um,
[18:36] he's the source of life.
[18:39] That's all I can say.
[18:41] we need to be. If we don't lift our cup
[18:43] up to him, he's it's going to be hard
[18:45] for him to fill it. Amen. So, let's re
[18:48] remember all those. Let's remember all
[18:51] those that are out and uh live
[18:54] streaming. Amen. For whatever reason,
[18:56] for our sister Donna, amen. That our
[18:58] prayers go out to her and continued
[19:01] prayers go out to her. And also for uh
[19:04] just this uh concert that's coming up uh
[19:07] Saturday. It would be a shame that uh
[19:10] this there would be any empty seats and
[19:13] that uh we haven't done what uh we know
[19:16] that we can and should do. Amen. So,
[19:19] let's just uh remember that.
[19:22] Um how many enjoys the Fontaine family?
[19:25] Amen. I mean,
[19:28] we know it's a good time. We know it's a
[19:30] good time of celebration in the Lord.
[19:32] And we just pray that uh they could just
[19:34] be an inspiration to somebody else that
[19:36] might not know the Lord. Amen. So, let's
[19:39] just uh pray about that. Amen. Also, if
[19:44] you could just pray for uh me and Sister
[19:46] Lori. There's a situation that we're
[19:48] dealing with that's uh basically out of
[19:51] our control. So, we just do all you can
[19:55] do and turn it over to the Lord.
[19:58] And uh
[20:01] you got to surrender.
[20:04] But
[20:06] regardless the outcome, um, long as he's
[20:09] in it, that's all that matters.
[20:13] Um, let's just stand and u just take
[20:17] these knees before the Lord tonight.

[20:30] Charlie uh Kirk I think had passed away.
[20:34] Uh he was shot. What a witness for
[20:37] Christ.
[20:40] Um
[20:41] when you stand up for Christ, you are
[20:44] going to suffer persecution.
[20:47] We just pray that the Lord would just be
[20:50] his wife's comfort and his children's
[20:52] comfort
[20:54] this time of morning.
[20:56] Let's just go before the bottom of the

[31:49] It's not by mine.
[31:52] It's not by power,
[31:54] but by my spirit, saith the Lord.
[32:00] It's not by might.
[32:03] It's not by power,
[32:05] but by my spirit, saith the Lord.

[32:17] This mountain
[32:19] shall be removed.
[32:22] This mountain
[32:24] shall be removed
[32:27] by my spirit, saith the Lord.
[32:32] It's not by mighty mouth.
[32:37] Brother,
[32:40] saith the Lord.
[32:43] It's not by p.

[33:21] but by my spirit, saith the Lord.
[33:26] It's not by might.
[33:29] It's not by power,
[33:32] but by my spirit, saith the Lord.
[33:38] This mountain
[33:40] shall be removed.
[33:43] This mountain shall be removed.
[33:48] This mountain
[33:50] shall be removed.
[33:53] By my spirit, saith the Lord.
[34:00] Amen.
[34:02] Amen. and by the spirit of God, our
[34:06] problems
[34:08] are taken care of.
[34:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not by our efforts, not by
[34:15] somebody else efforts, but God has made
[34:17] a way to have our needs met through the
[34:21] Holy Spirit today. Praise the Lord. God
[34:24] bless these faithful few in the house of
[34:28] the Lord today. I'm rejoicing
[34:31] for God's faithfulness inside his
[34:34] people. Amen. Turn with me if you would
[34:37] in the book of Isaiah
[34:40] chapter 12. This is the book of Isaiah
[34:43] is a mini Bible.
[34:46] And there's parts of the whole Bible in
[34:50] the book of Isaiah.
[34:52] We could just if you only have a chance
[34:54] to read one book, this would be the book
[34:58] It shares everything,
[35:02] a little bit of of everything. Amen.
[35:05] Amen. Before we begin reading this
[35:07] entire chapter of chapter 12, let's just
[35:11] ask God's blessing on this part of the
[35:13] service. Now our heavenly father, we bow
[35:16] before you with a thanksgiving in our
[35:19] heart that we could be assembled in your
[35:22] house where we we know we know that
[35:26] we're just two or three are gathered
[35:28] together that you promise to be there.
[35:32] &gt;&gt; And Lord, we believe this with all of
[35:33] our heart. And maybe our feelings don't
[35:36] always declare it, but our faith
[35:39] declares it. And we know that you are
[35:42] touched when we uh touch you by faith,
[35:46] Lord. And Lord, we're looking to you now
[35:49] to break the bread of life to us, to
[35:52] encourage us, strengthen us, help us
[35:54] with all of our uh real life's issues
[35:57] that we have. Uh Lord, may you increase
[36:01] our faith, and and uh give us the
[36:04] victory that we have need of today.
[36:06] bless your your people that have
[36:08] gathered here, Lord, with a special
[36:10] blessing. I just pray that they would
[36:13] leave here with more of you than when
[36:15] they came. And Lord, we ask that you
[36:17] would be with those that are not here
[36:19] today, that are missing for one reason
[36:20] or another. May your your mercies and
[36:23] your grace be extended uh towards them.
[36:27] And Lord, that you would help them in
[36:29] their situations. We thank you for these
[36:31] things now in Jesus Christ's precious
[36:34] name. Amen. Amen. All right. Isaiah
[36:37] chapter 12, starting with verse number
[36:39] one. And in that day thou shalt say, Oh
[36:42] Lord, I will praise thee.
[36:45] Though thou was angry with me, thine
[36:47] anger is turned away, and thou
[36:50] comfortest me. Behold, God is my
[36:53] salvation. I will trust
[36:56] and not be afraid.
[36:58] For the Lord Jehovah is my strength and
[37:01] my song. He also has become my
[37:04] salvation.
[37:06] Therefore will with joy shall ye draw
[37:09] water out of the wells of salvation. And
[37:12] in that day shall ye say, "Praise the
[37:15] Lord. Call upon his name. Declare his
[37:18] doings among the people. Make mention
[37:21] that his name is exalted. Sing unto the
[37:25] Lord for he have done excellent things.
[37:28] This is known in all the earth. Cry out.
[37:31] Shout thou inhabitant of Zion, for great
[37:34] is the Holy One of Israel in the midst
[37:36] of thee. Amen. God bless you. May be
[37:39] seated.
[37:41] Well, like to entitle this message, draw
[37:44] your water.
[37:46] Draw your water.
[37:48] Water is important. Just naturally
[37:51] speaking, our bodies are made of about
[37:54] 60% of water. Now, I've heard in the
[37:57] I've heard of like 90%. I don't know
[37:59] where that has gone down to 60, but
[38:02] that's the now a day Google. So,
[38:06] it's made up of a lot of water if I
[38:08] could just say it like that. Without
[38:11] water, we can't live.
[38:14] And if we can't uh let me just make sure
[38:17] this is uh Yes, it did. It did get a
[38:21] little bit warm in here. So, we're just
[38:23] going to um turn it down for those that
[38:28] are warm and um
[38:32] and those that are feeling really good.
[38:35] Um
[38:36] you just don't want to feel good to be
[38:38] here. How's that?
[38:44] Without water on a daily basis, uh we
[38:47] can become dehydrated. And we've often
[38:49] heard on hot days to drink lots of
[38:51] water. Um dehydration
[38:55] can cause a a lot of underlying issues.
[38:58] In other words, we don't really know why
[39:00] what's happening to our body is
[39:02] happening, but it could be because we're
[39:04] lacking enough water. And eventually,
[39:06] these types of things could lead to
[39:08] kidney stones or just poor brain
[39:10] function. Just kind of like in a fog.
[39:13] Water carries the oxygen and nutrients
[39:15] to all the parts of our body. It
[39:17] lubricates our joints and it protects us
[39:21] and it actually helps remove uh waste.
[39:24] So water is very very necessary and
[39:28] important just on a natural level. Of
[39:31] course, spiritual water um to the spirit
[39:35] man is just as important.
[39:39] A real Christian is made up of living
[39:42] water. I mean, spiritual water or a
[39:46] living word. They just don't live by a
[39:49] dead letter. A a a
[39:52] you know, if you if you don't have the
[39:54] real living water flowing through you,
[39:56] you could literally take the word of God
[39:58] and start cutting people, judging
[40:00] people. That's why the Bible says, uh,
[40:03] speak the truth in love.
[40:06] So, you need a living water to survive.
[40:10] Without the spirit of God flowing in
[40:12] your vessel, you you'll just shrivel up
[40:15] like an old piece of fruit. You ever
[40:17] seen I don't care if it's a banana, a
[40:19] prune, an apple. If it sits there long
[40:23] enough before you eat it, what happens
[40:25] to that thing? That thing just shrivels
[40:28] up.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; Still a fruit, but it's shriveled up.
[40:32] Now Christians can come become like this
[40:36] &gt;&gt; if you don't get in the spirit, keep the
[40:39] spirit flowing through you, you you just
[40:41] shrivel up and and and you you do not
[40:45] handle things with grace and with love.
[40:49] So you need spiritual hydration to be
[40:53] able to deal with real life's issues.
[40:57] Amen. Turn with me to St. John chapter
[40:59] 4. So, we just want to talk about
[41:01] drawing your water. Drawing your water.
[41:04] And like how do we do that? And how do
[41:06] we get a hold of the water that we need
[41:09] to deal with our real life's issues in
[41:12] life, our problems, things we come
[41:15] against. That's kind of what we want to
[41:17] go through today in our little Bible
[41:19] study here. John chapter 4, starting
[41:21] with verse uh number six. And this is a
[41:24] very familiar set of scriptures that
[41:26] Brother Brandham often used. uh before
[41:29] his discernment and he'd bring it up in
[41:31] his sermons. He says, "Now Jacob's well
[41:34] was there and Jesus therefore being
[41:36] wearied with his journey, he sat thus on
[41:39] the well and it was about the sixth
[41:42] hour. But remember, he said, "I must
[41:45] needs go by Samaria because he had
[41:48] somebody to spiritually witness to,
[41:51] right? There cometh a woman of Samaria
[41:53] to draw water." And Jesus saith unto
[41:55] her, "Give me a drink." Now notice Jesus
[41:58] is asking her for a drink of water. But
[42:02] we know that this is going somewhere
[42:05] than more than just filling, you know, a
[42:07] thirsty quench of his body. For his
[42:10] disciples were gone away into the city
[42:12] to buy meat. And then saith the woman of
[42:15] Samaria unto him, "How is it that thou
[42:18] being a Jew asking a drink of me which
[42:22] am a woman of Samaria? for you know that
[42:25] the Jews don't have any dealings with
[42:27] the Samaritans. So why are you asking me
[42:30] for a drink?
[42:32] And Jesus, he said, if you knew the if
[42:37] you knew the gift of God
[42:40] and who it is that saith unto thee, give
[42:44] me a drink of of water, thou wouldest
[42:47] asked of me
[42:48] &gt;&gt; a drink, and I would give thee living
[42:51] water.
[42:54] So Jesus is saying,"I know what I am and
[42:56] what I can give you. And if you knew it,
[43:00] you would sit, you would be wanting
[43:02] water from me." And a lot of times, you
[43:06] know, people come to church and they
[43:08] want to be entertained,
[43:12] but they want to have a fellowship. They
[43:15] they want to have um a a temporary feel
[43:19] good about something, but it's not
[43:22] sustaining.
[43:24] I mean, it's a good thing, but it's not
[43:26] sustaining.
[43:27] Um and what God has to offer us is his
[43:31] holy spirit, and that is what's
[43:34] sustaining. The woman saith unto him,
[43:36] "Sir,
[43:38] thou has nothing to draw with, and the
[43:41] well is deep. from whence then has thou
[43:46] that living water? So notice she's still
[43:50] talking about natural water and somehow
[43:54] it it becomes a living water and and so
[43:58] she says the well is deep. That's
[44:00] important for later down in in the in
[44:03] the message here. From whence thou has
[44:06] that living water? And and this is a
[44:09] question that we all at times have. And
[44:13] and that is I I want help from God. I
[44:17] need joy. I need peace. I I need wisdom.
[44:20] I I need I need help in my situation.
[44:24] But the well is deep. And how can I get
[44:28] to this water? How can I get to what I
[44:30] need that I can be a real overcoming
[44:32] Christian?
[44:36] And she says,"Art thou greater than our
[44:38] father Jacob, which gave us this well,
[44:41] and and drank thereof himself, and his
[44:43] children, and his cattle?"
[44:46] And Jesus answered and said unto her,
[44:50] "Whosoever drinks of this natural water
[44:54] is actually going to thirst again and
[44:56] need more water to survive to survive to
[45:01] the next day."
[45:04] But whosoever drinkketh of the water
[45:06] that I shall give him shall never
[45:10] thirst, but the water that I give him
[45:14] shall be in him, inside of him, a well
[45:18] of water springing up into everlasting
[45:22] life.
[45:23] Now, this shall never thirst doesn't
[45:26] mean you won't want to thirst for God's
[45:30] presence. What it means is you'll never
[45:34] look for anything else to satisfy you
[45:36] than Jesus Christ.
[45:41] &gt;&gt; There's nothing else that can satisfy
[45:43] you.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; Jesus said this well will be inside of
[45:47] your human body. So when we're looking
[45:50] for things that we need in our life, we
[45:53] don't look out here. We don't even deal
[45:55] with circumstances. But we have to get
[45:58] real with God inside of our heart
[46:02] &gt;&gt; because that's where you're going to
[46:03] meet God is inside of our heart.
[46:07] So wherever you are, the well will
[46:09] presently be with you.
[46:12] You don't have to go looking for it. The
[46:14] well is inside of you. It's a springing
[46:19] into everlasting life. In other words,
[46:21] joy will be there. Peace will be there.
[46:23] right in the middle of a storm, you'll
[46:26] have peace because the wells inside of
[46:29] you. But how do we get in there to get
[46:32] it out?
[46:34] That's the drawing part. That's the part
[46:37] that we play to get it out, to get it to
[46:40] where it it actually benefits our life.
[46:44] So, whatever you need,
[46:47] you need a drink,
[46:49] it'll be available right there inside of
[46:51] you. You won't have to wait till you get
[46:53] to church
[46:56] &gt;&gt; to draw water from the waters of
[46:58] salvation. It's available. So it doesn't
[47:02] matter what the need is, his presence is
[47:05] right there to give it to you. If you
[47:07] need a sound mind in a situation, you
[47:10] need victory, you need to overcome a
[47:12] situation, if you need the blood to
[47:14] cover, if you need forgiveness, if you
[47:16] need his allsufficient grace, whatever
[47:18] it is, it's already inside of you. You
[47:21] just got to draw it out.
[47:25] Therefore, with joy shall ye draw waters
[47:28] out of the wells of salvation. With joy.
[47:32] Not Oh, really? I got to deal with this
[47:35] again.
[47:38] We ought to be the happiest people on
[47:40] the planet.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; How God is in in his presence is
[47:48] fullness of joy. So if we don't have
[47:51] that joy, then we've stepped out of the
[47:54] presence of the Lord because God is
[47:57] still he's got joy all the time. I mean,
[47:59] he had joy for the joy that was set
[48:01] before him. He endured the cross. And
[48:04] joy is important because it's your
[48:05] strength. It's okay. I can deal with
[48:08] this because I've got joy inside of me.
[48:12] So
[48:13] therefore, with joy shall ye draw waters
[48:17] out of the wells of salvation. So you
[48:20] got to draw water out of out of you. Do
[48:22] you know how to do that yet? Anybody got
[48:25] any idea how to how to do that yet?
[48:28] Take joy and draw waters of salvation.
[48:32] I'll never leave you. I'll never forsake
[48:35] you. I'll be with you to the end. The
[48:37] well of salvation is inside of you.
[48:42] Now drawing water physically is not
[48:46] easy. Just if you can imagine
[48:50] um this woman that was at that well, she
[48:53] said the well is deep. Now I'm sure back
[48:56] then they didn't have the invention of
[48:59] automation.
[49:01] They didn't have electric motors. You
[49:03] you you pull the generator starts up and
[49:06] all of a sudden here comes the bucket,
[49:09] you know, full of the water to drink.
[49:12] She her own testimony was the well is
[49:16] deep and it had to be deep for it to be
[49:19] along as far as Jacob was, right? His
[49:23] children. This is many years later. And
[49:25] the well's still there and it still got
[49:27] water. So, it had to be pretty deep for
[49:30] it to not dry up. Are you with me so
[49:32] far? Amen.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; So, it takes effort spiritually to draw
[49:36] water out of a well, a spiritual well.
[49:40] So, when we're trying to get water to
[49:42] help our situation, we understand it
[49:44] can't be just as easy as turning the TV
[49:46] on and and getting what we need. We
[49:50] actually have to put effort to get the
[49:53] water out to where it can do good.
[49:56] Because if there's water in a well,
[49:58] that's good down there, but I need it up
[50:00] here. I need to be drinking it. I need
[50:01] something up here to help me. So, how do
[50:04] I get it out? All right, let's turn to
[50:06] Genesis chapter 24,
[50:09] verse 10.
[50:11] Genesis chapter 24, verse 10. I hope
[50:15] that I'm at least a little bit starting
[50:18] to
[50:20] um get you thirsty for this answer.
[50:25] All right. Genesis chapter 24. Now
[50:27] Abraham makes Eleazar swear to go get
[50:32] the type of bride that is just right for
[50:36] for for his son Isaac. And not just to
[50:40] get any old uh bride, but it had to be
[50:44] one after his kind. One after his kind.
[50:48] A very good type of uh God and and and
[50:52] Jesus. And then not only Jesus, but
[50:54] Jesus and us, right? He's the firstborn
[50:57] among many brother. We had that that
[50:59] service on on on being uh in the genes
[51:04] of God, the spiritual genes of God. So
[51:06] let's take a look at this. Genesis
[51:08] 24:10. And the servant Eleazar took 10
[51:12] camels
[51:13] of the camels of his master and
[51:15] departed. For all the goods of his
[51:17] master were in his hand. All the goods
[51:20] of Abraham was with Eleazar. And he
[51:24] arose and he went to Mesopotonia
[51:27] onto the city of Nahor. And he made his
[51:30] camels to kneel down without the city by
[51:34] a well of water at the time of the
[51:36] evening, even the time that women go out
[51:39] to draw water.
[51:42] Now notice the the women drew the water
[51:46] being a type of the bride who does the
[51:49] drawing of the water. Are you with me?
[51:52] &gt;&gt; Okay. And he said, uh, "Oh Lord, God of
[51:56] my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me
[51:59] good speed this day and show kindness
[52:01] unto my master Abraham." What a what a
[52:04] blessing to have to have this type of a
[52:08] a support um that really cares h about
[52:15] um the the the ministry. If I could just
[52:19] say it like this. Ezer was a real
[52:22] faithful servant to Abraham. Behold, I
[52:26] stand here by the well of water and the
[52:29] daughters of the men of the city come
[52:31] out to draw water. And he's making this
[52:34] prayer. And he says, "And let it come to
[52:36] pass that the damsel to whom I shall
[52:39] say, let down thy pitcher, I pray thee,
[52:43] that I may drink, and she shall say,
[52:50] drink,
[52:52] and I will give thy camels drink also.
[52:56] Let the same be she that thou has
[52:59] appointed for thy servant Isaac. and
[53:01] thereby shall I know that thou has
[53:04] showed kindness unto my master. Now
[53:07] notice this this little if I could kind
[53:09] of call it a fleece here in this
[53:13] um it the the the bride would be known
[53:16] by her willingness to work extra
[53:21] by her willingness to work extra. Not
[53:23] just get by. Yeah, here's the drink you
[53:26] asked for.
[53:28] but to give more than what was asked
[53:30] for. That's what that's a good
[53:34] identification of the true bride of
[53:36] Christ. And it came to pass
[53:39] before he was done speaking that Rebecca
[53:43] came out, who was born to Bethl, the son
[53:47] of Mela,
[53:50] the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother,
[53:53] with her picture upon her shoulder. And
[53:57] there it is. It's of the same lineage
[53:59] there, the same genes. And the dames was
[54:03] very fair to look upon a virgin. Now,
[54:06] this just represents the church here,
[54:09] right? She's a clean of not being with
[54:13] the the uh the world uh or a a a church
[54:18] that's denominationalized, a a church
[54:21] that's uh uh man-made. There's no belief
[54:25] in anything but the word of God, the
[54:27] pure word of God. Neither had any man
[54:29] known her. And she went down to the
[54:32] well, and filled her picture, and came
[54:34] up. And the servant ran to meet her, and
[54:38] said, "Let me, I pray thee, drink a
[54:41] little of thy pitcher." And she said,
[54:44] "Drink, my lord." And she, look at
[54:47] hasted. She hasted. She wasn't being
[54:51] lazy here. She let down the picture upon
[54:54] her hand and gave him drink. And when
[54:58] she had done her first bidding, giving
[55:02] him a drink, she said, "You know what?
[55:05] I'll draw water for your camels also
[55:07] until they have done drinking."
[55:12] Like, how many is going to volunteer to
[55:14] do more work?
[55:15] &gt;&gt; Right?
[55:17] &gt;&gt; You know what we're looking for in the
[55:19] flesh is somebody else to take care of
[55:21] our problems.
[55:26] The servant Eleazar
[55:29] wasn't there looking for some a handout
[55:32] with water. He wasn't looking for
[55:35] somebody to help him.
[55:38] He was looking for something for his
[55:41] master.
[55:45] and she he found the bride when she
[55:51] identified by doing more than what was
[55:53] asked.
[55:55] And this to me is a true characteristic
[55:57] of somebody that really wants to get to
[55:58] heaven. Somebody that really wants to
[56:01] get ready to make the rapture. They're
[56:03] willing to go above and beyond. They
[56:05] don't have an attitude of, "Well, if I
[56:08] got to do this, I'll do it. But, you
[56:10] know, this is all I'm gonna do. I'm not
[56:12] going to do any more than that. That is
[56:14] not a good identification of the bride
[56:16] of Christ.
[56:18] And and this this lady, if I could say
[56:21] it like this, she was willing to work.
[56:24] She wasn't afraid to work. She wasn't
[56:26] afraid to do more than what was asked of
[56:29] her.
[56:31] Like if
[56:35] you know for me to go get um
[56:39] um Alzer a drink of water would be
[56:41] pretty easy, right? It'd be one time
[56:43] into the well. Bring it up. Here you go.
[56:46] But she's offering to do work. A lot
[56:50] more work. Well, how much more work?
[56:52] We'll we'll we'll we'll try to see what
[56:54] what this is here. It was a It was a
[56:57] quite a bit of work for sure. But let's
[56:58] finish reading this.
[57:00] and the damned soul. Okay, I'm sorry.
[57:02] Verse um number 20. And she hastened,
[57:05] emptied the picture, ran again unto the
[57:08] well to draw water, and drew for all his
[57:10] camels. And the man wondered at her at
[57:14] her uh and and the man wondering at her
[57:18] held his peace to w whether the Lord had
[57:21] made his journey prosperous or not. And
[57:23] it came to pass as the camels had done
[57:25] drinking that the man took a golden
[57:29] earring of a half a shekele of weight
[57:32] and two bracelets for her hands of 10
[57:36] shekels weight of gold. Now remember, he
[57:40] had everything that uh Abraham had had
[57:45] at his disposal
[57:47] and he now she had drawn
[57:51] from the wells
[57:54] and she was now being prospered
[57:56] naturally for her labor
[58:00] above and beyond what she thought she
[58:02] was going to get. Of course, she didn't
[58:06] know that she was under the
[58:12] the purpose of the Holy Spirit now for
[58:15] her future.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; And a lot of times God asks us to do
[58:20] things that we don't think have anything
[58:22] to do with what we got going on in our
[58:24] life, but they have everything to do
[58:26] with getting ready to get out of here.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; And that's why we, you know, we think
[58:30] it's natural, it's carnal, it's not
[58:32] needed. like like a lot of people, they
[58:34] don't go to church because they don't
[58:35] think it's needed.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; I am telling you, those people are not
[58:40] going to make it as clear as anything.
[58:43] When brother Brandham says, "Don't make
[58:44] it just reading one message," that's
[58:47] because that's all they had.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; But if they had more messages to read
[58:51] and they decided not to read it, I'm
[58:53] sorry.
[58:55] To whom much is given, much is required.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:59] and and and we we have a chance to be
[59:02] faithful and faithfulness is what brings
[59:05] us to the rapture.
[59:09] Now, did you know one camel can drink
[59:12] up? Actually, I've read where they can
[59:15] drink more than 50 gallons of water at
[59:18] one time.
[59:20] So, how many knows what a 55gallon drum
[59:22] looks like?
[59:24] Okay. Now, that's Well, my arm's not
[59:28] doing real good, but I'm going to say
[59:29] it's about this diameter,
[59:32] and it's about about this tall.
[59:36] It's it's they call it 55 gallons you
[59:39] can put in there. 55 gallons of
[59:41] whatever. Now, um
[59:47] there were actually 10 camels, right?
[59:50] So if each one
[59:53] um drank a 55 gallon, that means 10 of
[59:58] them would be 10 10 gallons 10 55gallon
[1:00:03] drums up here or 550 gallons. Think
[1:00:07] about that. You know how much one gallon
[1:00:10] of milk is when you go to the store and
[1:00:12] you buy it and you're carrying it?
[1:00:16] Brother Ron, you told us about when you
[1:00:18] hurt your shoulder in the other church
[1:00:20] when you picked up that five gallon of
[1:00:21] water with one hand and you put it on
[1:00:24] your shoulder and you hurt your your
[1:00:25] shoulder.
[1:00:29] 550
[1:00:32] gallons this woman Rebecca did without
[1:00:36] being asked.
[1:00:41] She went above and beyond, but she
[1:00:45] became
[1:00:48] the
[1:00:49] part of that lineage
[1:00:52] that God had with his special people.
[1:00:57] And she could have had the attitude
[1:00:59] where,
[1:01:01] you know, I'm not I'm not gonna draw all
[1:01:04] that water for your camels.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; You didn't ask me and I ain't gonna do
[1:01:08] it. Right?
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; And if you did ask me, I would say I'm
[1:01:11] too busy.
[1:01:14] I'll give it to you.
[1:01:16] I want you to understand
[1:01:19] that God is looking to see how
[1:01:21] interested we are in really going
[1:01:24] forward with him.
[1:01:27] Because if we really want the joy of the
[1:01:30] Lord, the peace of God, the the fire of
[1:01:33] God, if we want to have victory, if we
[1:01:36] want to have um if we want to be an
[1:01:39] overcomer,
[1:01:41] if we want to have the love to love our
[1:01:43] enemies, we need to be willing to draw,
[1:01:47] draw, draw, draw from that well to get
[1:01:50] God in the scene.
[1:01:53] Because we're not going to get a lot if
[1:01:56] we're only going to give a little.
[1:01:59] We've got to be willing to get a lot.
[1:02:02] Now, I wonder how long that would have
[1:02:05] taken to draw 550 gallons for a moment.
[1:02:09] Now, let's just be honest.
[1:02:13] How big was the bucket on the end of
[1:02:16] this rope
[1:02:18] that was going down? How big was that?
[1:02:21] Because I'm going to be honest with you,
[1:02:23] when you're you ever try to carry two
[1:02:26] one gallons of milk with one hand.
[1:02:32] I mean, that's hard.
[1:02:37] So, if you're going to be cranking that
[1:02:39] up and it was deep well, right? Deep
[1:02:43] well, I mean, after a while, she had to
[1:02:46] have, you know, Samson muscles or
[1:02:48] something.
[1:02:51] I mean, that's how many times How big
[1:02:54] was that bucket?
[1:02:56] Let's take a guess. What would it be?
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; I I if it was too big, you She would
[1:03:06] never be able to do it because it wasn't
[1:03:07] motorized.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; I mean, when I'm watching the John Wayne
[1:03:13] movies, they don't look that big,
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; right? It's just a little a little thing
[1:03:18] in you. So, I'm just saying it wouldn't
[1:03:22] surprise me if she had to go down there
[1:03:25] 250 times.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; I don't know.
[1:03:29] But I'm saying that she was willing to
[1:03:32] keep seeking and asking for for what she
[1:03:36] needed to get the job done.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And the thing is, the key to to to
[1:03:42] receiving what we need from the wells of
[1:03:45] salvation
[1:03:46] is to have joy when we're praising God,
[1:03:49] when we're shouting to God, a and and to
[1:03:53] enter into his presence with
[1:03:55] thanksgiving, into his courts with
[1:03:57] praise, and and to to to believe that
[1:04:00] God will come on the scene and consume
[1:04:02] the sacrifice if we're willing to put
[1:04:04] forth the effort. Our opening scripture
[1:04:08] says in Isaiah 12:1,
[1:04:12] "And in that day,
[1:04:14] thou shalt say, Oh Lord, I will praise
[1:04:18] thee."
[1:04:20] How many on the way to church today,
[1:04:23] just be honest with me, on the way to
[1:04:26] church today, you had this thought. I am
[1:04:30] going to praise the Lord.
[1:04:36] I mean, there is sometimes the the
[1:04:39] thought process of
[1:04:42] it's time for church and I got to get
[1:04:44] there and I hope, you know, I get
[1:04:46] something from God. That thought process
[1:04:48] is usually always there. But now we're
[1:04:52] we've been taught in the scriptures to
[1:04:55] bring a sacrifice of praise to come with
[1:04:59] something to give to God because we're
[1:05:02] coming into his house. And um and so it
[1:05:05] says, "Oh Lord, I will praise thee
[1:05:09] though you were angry with me. I I I I
[1:05:12] sinned. I I I I I said some wrong
[1:05:15] things. I did some wrong things. Um, and
[1:05:19] you were angry with me, but your anger
[1:05:21] is turned away. And you comfort me
[1:05:23] because I I've I've repented. I said I
[1:05:25] was sorry. I made that right. And now
[1:05:28] I'm going to come and praise you.
[1:05:31] Behold, God is my salvation.
[1:05:35] I will trust and not be afraid.
[1:05:38] I will trust. I'm going to make a
[1:05:40] decision. I'm going to trust and I'm not
[1:05:43] going to be afraid. For the Lord Jehovah
[1:05:45] is my strength and he's my song. He's
[1:05:50] also become my salvation. He saves me
[1:05:54] from all of myself, all my situations.
[1:05:57] He's my savior, not just of my soul, but
[1:06:01] all the things that I go through in
[1:06:02] life. He's my savior. I can't count on
[1:06:05] anybody, but I can count on God.
[1:06:09] Therefore, with joy
[1:06:12] shall you draw water out of the wells of
[1:06:15] salvation. I love this. It says wells.
[1:06:18] It just like wherever you're at. If you
[1:06:22] notice in the Old Testament,
[1:06:25] they had made wells in different places.
[1:06:27] Depending on where they were at, they
[1:06:29] would need water. The well would be
[1:06:30] there. And you know, God can be God in
[1:06:33] our home and in our business. He can be
[1:06:35] God here. He can be God at our
[1:06:37] neighbors. He be God in the hospital.
[1:06:39] God is is a God that wherever we need
[1:06:44] water to draw water, he can be there. He
[1:06:46] can make a way for us. And in that day
[1:06:49] shall you praise the Lord. In that day
[1:06:52] that you're drawing the water out. You
[1:06:56] shall praise the Lord. Call upon his
[1:06:59] name and declare how great our God is
[1:07:02] among the people. declare his doings
[1:07:05] among the people and make mention that
[1:07:08] his name is exalted. Now I want you to
[1:07:11] think about this before service and
[1:07:14] after service. How often have we've done
[1:07:16] this?
[1:07:21] You know how often do we testify how
[1:07:25] great our God is in church?
[1:07:28] How often do we make mention that his
[1:07:30] name should be exalted
[1:07:33] because this is what we need to get what
[1:07:37] we want. It is hid here in simplicity.
[1:07:42] Sing unto the Lord for he have done
[1:07:44] excellent things. This is known in all
[1:07:47] the earth. Cry out, shout, thou
[1:07:50] inhabitant. In other words, you people
[1:07:53] that dwell in Christ. For great is the
[1:07:56] Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.
[1:07:59] So what does it mean to draw water?
[1:08:04] How do I draw water?
[1:08:09] Okay, so we could have some answers at
[1:08:13] this point when I asked that question.
[1:08:17] Um,
[1:08:19] so you're not all dear with the
[1:08:22] headlights that have come on. You've
[1:08:25] been here. You've been listening. How
[1:08:27] you draw water is you praise the Lord.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; You sing unto the Lord.
[1:08:34] You cry out for God. You call upon his
[1:08:38] name. You're not afraid, but you trust
[1:08:42] the Lord. That's how you That's how you
[1:08:44] draw waters. trust in him. You declare
[1:08:47] how great he is. Whoever you're talking
[1:08:50] to,
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; you make mention that his name is
[1:08:54] exalted above every other name. You
[1:08:57] testify that the Lord Jehovah is your
[1:08:59] strength and has become your salvation
[1:09:02] for every need you have. You shout.
[1:09:06] This is all these things you read right
[1:09:09] here in these six verses. You shout
[1:09:15] because you're dwelling in Zion, the
[1:09:18] secret place of the most high. You shout
[1:09:21] for great is the Holy One of Israel in
[1:09:24] the midst of you. Now, this is what it
[1:09:27] means to draw water. So, what what are
[1:09:28] you truly saying here, brother John? I
[1:09:31] am saying you can't just come and do a
[1:09:33] little praise, a little shout, and say,
[1:09:36] um, here Elizer, here's the water you
[1:09:38] asked for.
[1:09:40] What you got to be doing is willing to
[1:09:43] draw more water to praise him when you
[1:09:45] don't feel like praising him to shout
[1:09:48] out to the Lord when you don't feel like
[1:09:50] shouting today.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; You know, you can't wait till we get um
[1:09:55] you know a a band up here
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; to make you feel good about being in
[1:10:00] church.
[1:10:01] You got to draw your own water
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; because sometimes the laontines can't be
[1:10:06] with you in the house where you're
[1:10:08] living.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; Sometimes the church can't be with you
[1:10:11] in your home when you're going through
[1:10:13] your trial. But what you can do is you
[1:10:15] can call on God and you can keep drawing
[1:10:18] water and God will meet you.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Draw your own water.
[1:10:28] David caught this same vision that
[1:10:30] Isaiah had in drawing water out of the
[1:10:32] wells of salvation here in Psalms 105
[1:10:36] verses 1-4. Psalms 105:es 1-4. Oh, give
[1:10:41] thanks. Tell me if this isn't the same
[1:10:44] thing here that Isaiah had the same
[1:10:46] vision. Oh, give thanks unto the Lord.
[1:10:49] Call upon his name. Make known his deeds
[1:10:53] among the people. Sing unto him. Sing
[1:10:56] psalms unto him. Talk ye of all his
[1:11:00] wondrous works. Give glory unto his holy
[1:11:04] name. Let the heart of them rejoice that
[1:11:07] seek the Lord. Seek the Lord and his
[1:11:10] strength seek his face ever more. So
[1:11:15] when you you come and like what a
[1:11:17] beautiful time we had here Sunday at the
[1:11:19] altar. Boy, I I just feel that the Lord
[1:11:23] was happy with the intention that there
[1:11:26] was in the heart of the people of of
[1:11:28] seeking God. I really do. But here's the
[1:11:31] thing. We got to keep it going.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; We got to keep it going. You got to keep
[1:11:36] on seeking. Ask and it shall be given.
[1:11:38] Seek and you shall find. Knock and the
[1:11:40] door shall be open. You got He that
[1:11:43] seeketh findeth. That means you got to
[1:11:45] keep seeking. You can't just, you know,
[1:11:47] here's a little water for Elizer. that
[1:11:49] ought to be good enough. No, that is not
[1:11:51] good enough. You keep seeking until you
[1:11:54] get what you're looking for.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; You keep knocking until the door finally
[1:11:59] opens. Have you ever gone to a door and
[1:12:01] you went like this and they didn't come
[1:12:02] the first time
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; and you did it again?
[1:12:08] You know, you not it's not
[1:12:12] God isn't going to spoil us.
[1:12:16] He wants to feel appreciated.
[1:12:20] That means we're willing to sacrifice
[1:12:23] and draw as much water as needed to get
[1:12:26] a hold of God.
[1:12:30] So what are we doing here? What are we
[1:12:33] doing here reading this? We're learning
[1:12:35] to draw water the way that we should out
[1:12:39] of the well. It takes effort to give
[1:12:41] thanks. It get it takes effort to praise
[1:12:44] the Lord. When you don't feel like doing
[1:12:46] it, you just don't do it.
[1:12:48] You ever been in a good mood? You just
[1:12:52] and it's real easy because you're in a
[1:12:53] good mood. And when you're in a bad
[1:12:56] mood, it's
[1:13:00] you don't feel like doing anything.
[1:13:04] But it's when you're that's all emotion
[1:13:07] there, right?
[1:13:09] But when you need a drink,
[1:13:13] aren't you happy that you can go to the
[1:13:15] faucet, turn it on, grab some water?
[1:13:19] It's there. That's easy.
[1:13:23] But spiritual water, if you're not used
[1:13:25] to drawing water, can be hard.
[1:13:29] Of course, if you're used to it, it's
[1:13:31] easier.
[1:13:34] So, you just got to you got to put forth
[1:13:36] effort. It's about effort.
[1:13:39] The the only way to worship God is in
[1:13:42] spirit and truth.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; That's that's the the only worship that
[1:13:45] God will accept. So we can spend time
[1:13:48] just saying praise the Lord. Thank you
[1:13:50] Jesus in a service and we think we
[1:13:53] worship the Lord, but we've got to get
[1:13:55] into the spirit
[1:13:57] because that's the only thing he
[1:13:58] accepts. So if we want to get the
[1:14:01] benefit of feeling his presence and
[1:14:03] feeling the joy and feeling strength and
[1:14:06] getting the victory, then we've got to
[1:14:08] be willing to get pray and worship him
[1:14:11] until we get into the spirit and he
[1:14:13] receives that. Amen.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; So it takes effort to shout and cry out
[1:14:18] to God. It takes effort. You just if
[1:14:22] you're not willing to give any effort,
[1:14:23] you're not willing to work, I don't
[1:14:25] think you're going to get much results.
[1:14:28] It takes spiritual strength to ask
[1:14:30] things when you when you feel like
[1:14:33] you're not getting anywhere with God.
[1:14:36] It takes spiritual strength to keep
[1:14:38] knocking, to keep asking. Remember that
[1:14:40] one woman
[1:14:42] who the adversary was uh um taunting
[1:14:49] her? I can't remember exactly the story,
[1:14:51] but she went before the unjust judge and
[1:14:53] she kept crying out.
[1:14:56] And then God said, "How much more shall
[1:15:00] God uh take care of his children who cry
[1:15:03] day and night for him?"
[1:15:06] I mean, think about the last time that
[1:15:09] you went home
[1:15:13] and the thing that was on your heart is
[1:15:15] that you got to get a hold of God. When
[1:15:17] was the last time that happened?
[1:15:21] Because to draw water takes work.
[1:15:26] You You just can't sit in church and
[1:15:29] expect to get the blessings of God
[1:15:32] because God wants us to put our heart
[1:15:36] into drawing from him. And it takes
[1:15:39] worship. It takes praise. It takes
[1:15:41] thanking him for all the blessings that
[1:15:42] he blessed you with today.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; Count your blessings. Name them one by
[1:15:47] one. Remember this is hard. The Bible
[1:15:51] says the flesh is weak,
[1:15:54] but the spirit is willing.
[1:15:57] So the flesh does not want to spend time
[1:16:01] worshiping.
[1:16:03] The flesh, you know what? I finally got
[1:16:05] hot. I don't know what happened because
[1:16:07] the temperature went down four degrees
[1:16:09] and now I'm hotter than it was before. I
[1:16:11] am going to turn the heat back on.
[1:16:16] Like what happened? For some reason, the
[1:16:19] temperature just got hot up here for
[1:16:21] some reason.
[1:16:24] It takes effort and the flesh doesn't
[1:16:26] always want to praise the Lord. But we
[1:16:28] just got to do it.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; Draw the water. Don't just leave it
[1:16:32] there. The water's there. And what good
[1:16:34] is it to have the water if you're not
[1:16:36] going to get So get the benefits that we
[1:16:38] can get. Just spend time praising the
[1:16:41] Lord. Therefore, with joy shall ye draw
[1:16:44] waters out of the wells of salvation.
[1:16:47] Amen. Psalms 116:13 says, "I will take
[1:16:50] the cup of salvation and call upon the
[1:16:54] name of the Lord." Notice that. I will
[1:16:57] take the cup of salvation and I will
[1:17:00] call on the name of the Lord.
[1:17:04] We all have situations that we need to
[1:17:07] be saved from. Amen.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; We all have people we know that put in
[1:17:13] prayer requests
[1:17:15] and he's looking for us to draw, to
[1:17:18] praise him for the victory, to shout, to
[1:17:22] cry out before it happens because that's
[1:17:25] true faith.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; And faith is what catches God's
[1:17:28] attention.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Verse 17. I will offer to thee the
[1:17:35] sacrifice of thanksgiving,
[1:17:38] and I will call upon the name of the
[1:17:40] Lord, and I will pay my vows unto the
[1:17:43] Lord now in the presence of his people.
[1:17:46] Think about that one.
[1:17:50] In the courts of the Lord's house, in
[1:17:52] the midst of thee, oh Jerusalem, praise
[1:17:54] ye the Lord. Now, remember the vows. So,
[1:17:57] you made a vow to the Lord that you're
[1:17:59] going to serve him with all your heart.
[1:18:03] When you gave your heart to God, you
[1:18:05] said to God, I'm going to I'm going to
[1:18:07] serve you. I'm going to live for you.
[1:18:08] I'm going to move forward with you. Now,
[1:18:11] that is a vow that God wants you to
[1:18:12] keep.
[1:18:14] And sometimes, you know, our flesh gets
[1:18:17] away from serving God with our heart.
[1:18:21] And this scripture here is telling us
[1:18:23] that we need to go in church in the
[1:18:26] presence of all his people and make that
[1:18:28] recommitment. That's what you coming up
[1:18:30] to the altar was happening. That you
[1:18:33] making things closer to what you had at
[1:18:36] the beginning in the courts of the
[1:18:39] Lord's house in the midst of thee, oh
[1:18:41] Jerusalem. Praise ye the Lord. When was
[1:18:43] the last time? Okay, let me ask you this
[1:18:46] question.
[1:18:49] When was the last time you remember
[1:18:52] praising the Lord so much at church that
[1:18:56] you thought about it when you left
[1:18:57] church? When was the last time that
[1:18:59] happened?
[1:19:05] I mean,
[1:19:07] I was really drawn.
[1:19:10] I was really drawn to water. I can't
[1:19:12] believe how much I was praising God that
[1:19:15] service
[1:19:16] because the more you draw, the more
[1:19:20] you're going to get of his presence.
[1:19:24] I think when we're young in the Lord
[1:19:26] that God just pours out his blessings,
[1:19:28] right? Because he he he does it to the
[1:19:30] just and the unjust. But as we mature,
[1:19:34] he wants us to start drawing our own
[1:19:36] water.
[1:19:38] He wants us to labor for what we want.
[1:19:41] We can't just depend on everybody else
[1:19:43] to do it for us,
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; It only goes so far. All right. Romans
[1:19:49] chapter 10. Everyone
[1:19:52] uh who everyone that uh needs to be
[1:19:56] saved from any situation, need to take
[1:19:58] the cup of salvation, call upon the name
[1:20:01] of the Lord. Look at Romans chapter 10
[1:20:03] starting with verse 11. It starts out
[1:20:06] with salvation. And the scripture says,
[1:20:08] "For who?" For for the scripture saith,
[1:20:11] whosoever believeth on him shall not be
[1:20:14] ashamed. Have will you ever felt ashamed
[1:20:16] to praise the Lord.
[1:20:20] Did you ever feel like, well, I don't
[1:20:21] feel like praising the Lord right now.
[1:20:23] I'll be the only one, you know, that
[1:20:25] actually says, "Praise the Lord." It's
[1:20:26] kind of quiet right now.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; You don't ever want to be ashamed.
[1:20:31] You you you want to just You want to let
[1:20:35] God know
[1:20:36] everywhere that you're a believer.
[1:20:40] For there is no difference between the
[1:20:42] Jew and the Greek. For the for the same
[1:20:44] Lord over all is rich unto all that call
[1:20:47] upon him. For whosoever shall call upon
[1:20:50] the name of the Lord shall be saved. Now
[1:20:52] this is really this is talking about
[1:20:55] salvation.
[1:20:56] But the thing is I need to be saved from
[1:20:59] situations every day because the devil
[1:21:01] attacks me. He tries to get me off
[1:21:03] track. He He tries to get my mind in a
[1:21:06] in a lukewarm leodysia state and I need
[1:21:09] to be saved and the scripture is telling
[1:21:12] me that if I just call on the Lord
[1:21:15] that he will save me from my situation
[1:21:18] that there's actually water there to
[1:21:20] draw from. I don't have to sit in this
[1:21:23] this this spot of oh me why look at my
[1:21:26] situation nobody here to help me. No, I
[1:21:29] got to labor for my own water.
[1:21:34] All right. Jeremiah chapter 299. This is
[1:21:36] a familiar scripture.
[1:21:40] Um, now how this well functions is that
[1:21:44] we we we we call on God. We pray. We
[1:21:47] shout. We cry. We worship and we get w
[1:21:50] and we we receive from him what we have
[1:21:52] need of. And the scripture says, "Then
[1:21:55] shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go
[1:21:58] and pray unto me, and I will hearken
[1:22:00] unto you, and you shall seek me and find
[1:22:02] me when you search for me with all your
[1:22:05] heart." So I I would say when I look at
[1:22:07] Rebecca, Rebecca, she went ahead and she
[1:22:09] drew water. Um, and she, you know, she
[1:22:13] wasn't some somebody that didn't know.
[1:22:15] She didn't draw this water, Sister Lynn.
[1:22:17] She didn't say, "You know what? I that
[1:22:20] was a mistake. I should have never said
[1:22:22] that.
[1:22:23] She didn't say that
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; there was something inside of her. She
[1:22:27] knew what she was going to do when she
[1:22:29] drew waterfall 10 camels.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; And here the scripture is telling us
[1:22:35] that we we need to seek God and search
[1:22:38] for him with all of our heart. That
[1:22:41] means more effort,
[1:22:44] more time.
[1:22:46] And the more you put into it, the more
[1:22:48] you get out. And and and the and the
[1:22:51] thing is this is important to put into
[1:22:55] practice so we don't end up having to
[1:22:58] depend on feeling good to do it right.
[1:23:02] So we just got to be confident that no
[1:23:05] matter where we're at in life, the Bible
[1:23:07] says, "Be confident of this very thing
[1:23:08] that he which begun a good work in you
[1:23:10] will finish it." The well is there to
[1:23:13] help us all through our journey to the
[1:23:16] rapture.
[1:23:18] There is enough water in the wells of
[1:23:20] salvation to drink to last us our entire
[1:23:24] life. And the well is open to whosoever
[1:23:27] wants it. This is what I love about this
[1:23:29] script. This this well, God doesn't hold
[1:23:32] it back from anybody.
[1:23:35] Whoever is willing to draw, he'll give
[1:23:38] it to.
[1:23:40] And and and it we know that one day the
[1:23:44] well is going to be closed to the
[1:23:46] Gentiles and it's going to open up to
[1:23:49] the Jews. But until then, whoever wants
[1:23:52] it of the Gentiles
[1:23:56] is open. Revelations 22:17 says, "And
[1:23:59] the spirit and the bride say come."
[1:24:06] So the spirit, the Holy Ghost, and the
[1:24:08] bride have the same desire
[1:24:12] for for God to come.
[1:24:16] And let him that heareth
[1:24:19] the word or the spirit say to the church
[1:24:22] or the moving he that he that heareth
[1:24:26] say come and let him that is thirsty let
[1:24:30] him come. And whosoever
[1:24:34] will let him take of the water of life
[1:24:37] freely.
[1:24:39] The last chapter in the Bible. and
[1:24:43] whosoever will let him take of the water
[1:24:47] of life freely. But you got to come and
[1:24:50] you got to drink.
[1:24:52] Psalms 91:15 says, "He shall call upon
[1:24:55] me and I will answer him. I will be with
[1:24:58] him in trouble. I will deliver him and I
[1:25:01] will honor him. With long life will I
[1:25:04] satisfy him and show him my salvation."
[1:25:07] And so if there is health needs, we have
[1:25:09] scripture in the Bible that that God
[1:25:13] will will satisfy us with long life and
[1:25:17] show us his salvation through many
[1:25:20] sicknesses. Amen. God is a deliverer of
[1:25:24] all health issues. But we just got to
[1:25:27] keep unfortunately we have to keep
[1:25:29] praying. We have to keep seeking. We
[1:25:31] have to keep believing. We have to fight
[1:25:33] the good fight of faith. So whatever the
[1:25:36] trouble you have, there's a well that
[1:25:38] you can drink from. There's a well that
[1:25:40] can take care of every need. If you need
[1:25:42] mercy, there's a well to draw from. If
[1:25:45] you need forgiveness, there's a well to
[1:25:47] draw from. Psalms 86:5 tells us, "For
[1:25:51] thou, Lord, art good and ready to
[1:25:54] forgive." Isn't that beautiful? Thou art
[1:25:57] good and ready to forgive, and plenteous
[1:26:02] in mercy unto all them that call upon
[1:26:06] thee. Give ear, O Lord, unto my prayer.
[1:26:09] Attend to the voice of my supplication.
[1:26:11] In the day of my trouble, I will call
[1:26:13] upon thee, for thou will answer me. I'm
[1:26:17] going to draw my water. I'm going to
[1:26:21] draw my water, for thou will answer me.
[1:26:24] That's that takes faith.
[1:26:26] John uh chapter 7 as we're getting ready
[1:26:30] to close here. John 7:37. In the last
[1:26:34] day, that great day of the feast, Jesus
[1:26:37] stood and he cried.
[1:26:43] It must have meant something to him that
[1:26:44] he cried, brother Ron. It must have
[1:26:47] touched deep,
[1:26:50] saying, If any man thirst,
[1:26:53] let him come unto me and drink.
[1:26:58] Let him draw his own water from the
[1:27:01] wells of salvation and drink. And he
[1:27:04] that believeth on me, as the scriptures
[1:27:06] have said, out of his belly shall flow
[1:27:10] rivers of living water.
[1:27:14] But this spake he of the spirit which
[1:27:17] they that believe on him should receive
[1:27:20] for the Holy Ghost was not yet given
[1:27:22] because Jesus was not yet glorified.
[1:27:26] He that believeth on me as the
[1:27:28] scriptures have said. You know
[1:27:29] everybody's got their opinion about
[1:27:32] Jesus.
[1:27:34] I mean when Jesus asked the question who
[1:27:36] do who do men say that I the son of man?
[1:27:38] You ask anybody what do you think about
[1:27:40] Jesus? They got their opinion.
[1:27:44] What do you believe?
[1:27:47] And there's a lot of people that say
[1:27:49] they believe,
[1:27:51] not realizing the devils believe,
[1:27:55] but they don't believe as the scriptures
[1:27:57] teach. And the reason I'm I'm bringing
[1:28:00] this up is we've been taught easy
[1:28:02] clearly in the scriptures here how to
[1:28:05] draw water. If we want more of God in
[1:28:08] our life, we've got to spend time
[1:28:10] drawing.
[1:28:12] We got to seek God. We got to get spend
[1:28:14] time. God, I need you. Cry out, shout,
[1:28:18] talk about him. Testify him. Sometimes
[1:28:20] after church, we don't even talk about
[1:28:22] what was being preached.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; Like, we just heard from God and we're
[1:28:28] not going to talk about it.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; I mean, we should be thinking about the
[1:28:35] things that God's doing.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; Talk to somebody. Let them know what
[1:28:39] God's doing in your life.
[1:28:41] because it's encouraging. When somebody
[1:28:43] comes and they tell me what God's doing
[1:28:45] in their life, it encourages me.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; It it, you know, God's alive and and if
[1:28:50] he's working with somebody, that's going
[1:28:52] to encourage me because that means that
[1:28:53] that God can do that with me, too.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; So, we just got to draw draw from the
[1:29:01] wells that that we have. And that it
[1:29:04] just takes the effort of going beyond
[1:29:08] doing a little bit. Well, I went to
[1:29:09] church. What else you expect out of me?
[1:29:15] I want I want God.
[1:29:19] I want this well springing out.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; I want when everybody else in the world
[1:29:24] is shriveling up. I want to have God on
[1:29:26] the inside of me.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; And and that ain't going to happen
[1:29:30] because my name is John Martin. That's
[1:29:32] only going to happen because if I spend
[1:29:34] time drawing, drawing, drawing
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; when I don't want to, when I'm tired.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; And the reason we brought out this Ellie
[1:29:42] uh Rebecca drawing 550 gallons here,
[1:29:46] it's to show that it it takes more work
[1:29:48] than what we want to do.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; And if we can just come to church with
[1:29:53] the attitude that I'm willing to praise
[1:29:55] God in church. I'm willing to call on
[1:29:58] him. You know, because the one thing I I
[1:30:00] I I miss about brother Bruce. Of course,
[1:30:02] I miss a lot of things about Brother
[1:30:03] Bruce, but that man was not He wasn't
[1:30:05] afraid to enter in to the word,
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; you know, to to really enter into the
[1:30:11] word and and receive. He wasn't he
[1:30:14] wasn't he wasn't afraid to praise the
[1:30:16] Lord.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; And um
[1:30:20] there's so much that we can. And just
[1:30:22] think about it. How many can testify
[1:30:25] this? When we saw Brother Bruce, he had
[1:30:28] a smile on his face.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; He was happy.
[1:30:35] And I I I think God we, you know, like
[1:30:38] brother John Lefon used to say, we ought
[1:30:41] to be the happiest people on the planet.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; We really should be. And um so how many
[1:30:49] is willing to to start digging in and
[1:30:51] drawing more?
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. I think this will get us to what
[1:30:55] we're what we're the place we want to
[1:30:57] get to. If if it's just to be happier or
[1:31:00] to to have more strength, whatever it is
[1:31:02] that we need, it comes from God
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; and you praise God and you trust God and
[1:31:08] and and go to the extremes. Sometimes
[1:31:11] you got to shout out to God and and and
[1:31:13] just talk about him more and testify
[1:31:16] about him more and before you know it,
[1:31:18] the Bible says that he'll his presence
[1:31:20] will come because you're talking about
[1:31:22] him.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand together.
[1:31:42] I believe the bride will be like Rebecca
[1:31:44] and willing to draw water for those
[1:31:49] who are carrying her into the rapture. I
[1:31:53] believe that
[1:31:55] you know as you water the ministry the
[1:31:57] min the five-fold ministry is what
[1:31:59] brings us to perfection.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. There is a river
[1:32:11] Yeah.
[1:32:13] [Music]
[1:32:19] There came
[1:32:22] a sound from heaven
[1:32:26] [Music]
[1:32:28] as a mighty
[1:32:31] rushing
[1:32:33] wind.
[1:32:37] It filled their hearts with singing
[1:32:44] and gave peace and joy within.
[1:32:52] The prophet
[1:32:55] gave a promise.
[1:33:00] The spirit
[1:33:03] did descend
[1:33:08] and from the inner
[1:33:12] veil
[1:33:14] [Music]
[1:33:16] came a river
[1:33:18] with no end.
[1:33:22] [Music]
[1:33:24] There
[1:33:25] is a river
[1:33:31] that flows from deep within.
[1:33:39] There
[1:33:41] is a fountain
[1:33:46] that frees the soul from sin.
[1:33:53] Come
[1:33:55] to this water.
[1:34:00] There is a vast supply.
[1:34:07] [Music]
[1:34:08] There
[1:34:10] is a river
[1:34:14] that never
[1:34:17] shall run dry. Amen. Let's sing that
[1:34:20] again. And there is a river. Oh, there
[1:34:24] is a river
[1:34:29] that flows from deep within.
[1:34:36] There
[1:34:38] is a fountain
[1:34:43] that frees the soul from sin.
[1:34:50] Oh, come
[1:34:52] to this water.
[1:34:57] There is a vast supply.
[1:35:04] There
[1:35:06] is a river
[1:35:10] that never
[1:35:13] shall run dry. One more time. Let's sing
[1:35:16] it.
[1:35:18] Oh, there
[1:35:20] is a river
[1:35:25] that flows from deep within.
[1:35:32] There
[1:35:34] is a fountain
[1:35:39] that frees the soul from sin.
[1:35:45] Oh, come
[1:35:48] to this water.
[1:35:53] There is a vast supply.
[1:36:00] There
[1:36:02] is a river
[1:36:06] that never
[1:36:09] shall run dry.
[1:36:14] Amen. What a promise. What a promise. I
[1:36:18] think God wants us to remember that
[1:36:21] there is a river that we can draw waters
[1:36:23] from. Amen. Let's sing. Fill my cup,
[1:36:26] Lord. I lift it up.
[1:36:34] Fill my cup,
[1:36:38] Lord.
[1:36:40] I lift it up, Lord.
[1:36:46] Come and quench
[1:36:49] this thirsting of my soul.
[1:36:56] Bread of heaven,
[1:37:00] feed me till I want no more. Here's my
[1:37:08] cup. Fill it up and make me whole. Lift
[1:37:14] it up.
[1:37:16] Fill my cup, Lord.
[1:37:21] I lift it up, Lord.
[1:37:26] Come and quench
[1:37:29] this thirsting of my soul.
[1:37:36] Bread of heaven,
[1:37:39] feed me till I want no more. Here's my
[1:37:46] cup.
