[7:24] lamb? Are you
[7:27] washed in the

[10:47] Lord, let us be in wash in the blood.
[10:50] Amen. Near. Uh draw me near. Amen.
[10:56] I am thine, oh Lord. I have heard thy
[11:02] voice and it told thy love to
[11:08] me. I long to rise in the arms of faith
[11:14] and be closer drawn to thee.
[11:20] Draw me
[11:22] near, nearer, blessed Lord, to the cross
[11:27] where thou hast
[11:30] died. Draw me
[11:33] nearer, nearer, blessed
[11:37] Lord, to thy precious bleeding side.
[11:43] Consecrate me now to thy service, Lord,

[11:53] divine. Let my soul look up with a
[11:57] steadfast hope and my will be lost in
[12:03] thine. Draw me

[13:03] Lord, to thy precious bleeding sight.
[13:09] There are depths of love that I cannot

[13:19] sea. There are heights of joy that I may
[13:24] not reach till I rest in peace with
[13:28] thee.

[13:32] nearer, nearer, blessed Lord, to the

[14:21] Let me walk blessed Lord in the way thou

[16:52] my way every day with love. Amen. And he
[16:57] wants to do that, too. and he wants to
[17:00] do it to your
[17:01] neighbor and to your neighbor's
[17:04] neighbor and as far as off. Amen. Amen.
[17:09] Let's change the service and uh there's
[17:12] some needs before us. Amen. Our brother
[17:14] John, just please remember Ann who is uh
[17:17] fighting a bad cold. Uh she had to
[17:19] leave. So just remember her. Also,
[17:22] Cheryl has a bone spur that is causing a
[17:25] lot of pain for all those who are
[17:28] suffering in pain and affliction. Amen.
[17:31] For a coworker who has had a bad stomach
[17:35] flu bug and has been out of work. Uh so
[17:38] we just pray for that. Amen. For our
[17:42] brother Marty, uh he's got a respiratory
[17:45] uh infection and uh and his heels in bad
[17:49] pain, too. So, um I don't know what it
[17:52] is about this pain thing lately, but uh
[17:55] it seems like everybody's in
[17:57] pain.
[17:59] So, cherish your youth. That's all I can
[18:03] tell. But, uh hey, the Lord will see us
[18:06] through. That's that's all, you know,
[18:08] I'm I'm praising the Lord. I'm suffering
[18:10] with a sciatic for couple months now and
[18:16] um it's hard to see the end of the
[18:19] tunnel sometimes, you know, because it's
[18:22] kind of dark, but uh just keep praising
[18:26] the Lord and just think on him and
[18:30] sometime he always makes a way for you
[18:31] to get through it. So, uh, for those
[18:34] that are suffering with pain, I know
[18:36] it's not easy, but so let's just
[18:38] remember also our sister Jeannie had a
[18:40] steroid shot injection in her back. She
[18:44] is praying for a deliverance from her
[18:46] pain also. And uh, and Mike has an
[18:50] infection and needs uh, the healing,
[18:53] too. So, there's a lot of a lot of us
[18:56] that are in pain. So, um, the one thing
[19:00] about pain though, it it can kind of
[19:02] take your mind away from everything
[19:04] else. And that's the thing that I don't
[19:07] like about it because it
[19:12] inhibits
[19:14] the time with the Lord sometimes. It
[19:17] just it makes it hard to dwell on him
[19:19] sometimes. So pray for me and all those
[19:22] that asked for prayer tonight because
[19:25] you know I'm sure that they deal with
[19:27] deal with the same thing. So um let's
[19:29] just pray for them uh if nothing else
[19:32] that uh God would just speak to it to
[19:36] their hearts. Amen. Also we have a um a
[19:39] guest speaker our brother Daniel Darkco
[19:42] on Sunday April the 27th coming up. So,
[19:45] let's just remember that and prayer.
[19:47] Also, also all those that are uh not
[19:51] here tonight. There's uh quite a few, I
[19:54] think, that are missing for one reason
[19:56] or another. So, let's just remember them
[19:58] heart. Let's remember brother Dennis and
[20:00] uh all the boys that he's been bringing
[20:03] to the men's meeting.
[20:07] Uh seems like there's a a real good
[20:09] report there, a real good work that's uh
[20:12] been taking place. So, we're looking
[20:14] forward to uh Sunday. I think he's uh
[20:18] another another young boy is going to
[20:20] come to service, too. So, uh let's just
[20:23] be praying that the Lord would just use
[20:25] us uh like he he uses him. But, Brother
[20:29] Dennis isn't shy
[20:30] either. He goes right out there. And uh
[20:34] so, where where the Lord is at, there's
[20:37] liberty. Amen. So, let's just let's just
[20:40] stand.
[20:41] Does anybody have a need on their heart
[20:43] tonight? Just lift it. Lift it to God
[20:46] and because he knows all things. Amen.
[20:49] Let's just go in one accord. Dear
[20:50] heavenly father, Lord, as we come before
[20:52] you tonight,
[20:53] Lord, Lord, our prayers represented,
[20:56] Lord, by faith tonight, Lord God. Lord,
[20:59] we reach out through this suffering,
[21:02] this pain, the thing that these people
[21:04] are going through, Lord, our brothers,
[21:05] our sisters in Christ, Lord, and we look
[21:08] to you. You're the healer. You're the
[21:11] provider, Lord. You're the one that can,
[21:14] Lord, just make a way, Lord. And when it
[21:17] seems in pain like there is no other
[21:20] way, Lord God, but Lord, help us to
[21:22] focus on you, help us to just believe in
[21:26] in in what you've already going to do,
[21:28] Lord. For as this prayer goes out, Lord,
[21:30] in the name of Jesus, this tonight,
[21:32] Lord, we just pray that the healing goes
[21:35] with it. Oh Lord Jesus, we have

[21:41] you, Lord. That's why we're here
[21:42] tonight, Lord God, to receive what you
[21:45] have for us, Lord. Whatever that
[21:47] engrafted word would be for the hour,
[21:49] Lord, let us take it by our heart, Lord,
[21:52] and just oh, bring it in. And Lord, for
[21:54] it's an eternal word, Lord. Let us live
[21:57] on it, Lord, and walk in it as the light
[21:59] shine upon us, Lord. We thank you, Lord,
[22:02] for this opportunity, Lord. We pray for
[22:04] all those that have lost loved ones Lord
[22:07] because of cancer or what whatever was
[22:10] would be Lord. We just pray for their
[22:12] and then their soothing Lord be with
[22:14] them at this hour Lord. We thank you in

[25:06] me. I know the Lord has laid his hand on
[25:12] me.

[29:41] up, but they get too heavy and I got to
[29:44] lay them back down.
[29:47] So just trust me. Don't pick them back
[29:50] up. Amen. Don't do you no

[31:21] of his word, what a glory he sheds on
[31:27] our way.
[31:31] While we do his good will, he abides
[31:36] with us still and with all who will
[31:41] trust and oy.
[31:47] Trust and
[31:49] oy for there's no other way to be happy
[31:56] in
[31:58] Jesus but to trust and oy.
[32:05] Not a shadow can rise, not a cloud in
[32:11] the skies, but a smile quickly drives it
[32:17] away.
[32:20] Not a doubt or a fear. Not a sigh or a
[32:26] tear can abide while we trust and oy.
[32:35] Trust and
[32:37] oy for there's no other way to be happy
[32:43] with
[32:46] Jesus but to trust and oy.
[32:52] Not a burden we bear, not a sorrow we
[32:59] share, or a toil he doth richly
[33:06] repay. Not a grief nor a loss, not a
[33:11] frown or a cross, but is blessed if we
[33:16] trust and oy.
[33:22] Trust and
[33:24] oy for there's no other way to be happy
[33:30] in
[33:32] Jesus but to trust and oy.
[33:39] But we never can prove the delight of
[33:44] his love until all on the altar we
[33:52] lay. For the favor he shows and the joy
[33:58] he
[33:59] bestows are for them who will trust and
[34:04] oy.
[34:08] Trust and
[34:09] oy for there's no other way to be happy
[34:16] in
[34:19] Jesus but to trust in
[34:25] for there's no other way. That's right.
[34:29] And what a perfect psalm because we want
[34:31] to kind of do like a part two on uh
[34:35] trust today from last Wednesday. What a
[34:38] what a perfect song. When it came out, I
[34:40] just just the Lord touched my heart.
[34:43] Amen. Because as a minister, you always
[34:45] want to make sure you're you have the
[34:47] right message and you want the Lord to
[34:50] be with you and the whole Bible is
[34:52] edifying, but you still want to be in
[34:55] sync with the Lord. Amen. Amen. Well,
[34:58] God bless you. Um let's turn in our our
[35:01] Bibles to Proverbs chapter 3. as you're
[35:04] turning there. Brother Marty wanted me
[35:06] to just read
[35:09] um to to the saints here so he could
[35:13] know so we all could know exactly how to
[35:16] pray for him. He he definitely wanted to
[35:20] be here and he's missed a lot of church
[35:22] and he feels bad about it. Um and now
[35:26] the enemy has attacked his body. Said
[35:29] please pray for my healing. I have a
[35:31] respiratory
[35:33] infection and coughing a lot. He's also
[35:36] coughing up a lot of mucus. Says, I also
[35:39] have much pain in my heel, the area
[35:42] connected to my Achilles tendon and I'm
[35:45] having a difficult time walking due to
[35:48] intense pain. He's going to an
[35:50] orthopedic doctor on Tuesday. So he
[35:54] covets your prayers and that God would
[35:57] just give them relief in in his body.
[36:01] Amen. Those of us that are are healthy
[36:04] enough to be here today, we're
[36:05] fortunate. A lot of lot of sickness uh
[36:09] going around. Amen. Amen. We're just
[36:12] going to read one verse here um in the
[36:17] book of Proverbs chapter 3 verse number
[36:20] five. and we'll have a word of prayer
[36:22] and have you be seated. The scripture
[36:25] says, "Trust in the Lord with all thine
[36:28] heart and lean not unto thy own
[36:32] understanding." Amen. Amen. Heavenly
[36:34] Father, we come to you with
[36:37] uh with comfort, just knowing that we
[36:40] have your unfailing
[36:43] word to look
[36:45] to. That
[36:49] there's nothing
[36:51] that's untrue of your word, but all of
[36:55] your word is yay and amen. And we take
[36:57] comfort tonight knowing that your word
[37:02] can bring us harmony and and and healing
[37:07] and and comfort and strength and
[37:09] leadership and all that we would have
[37:11] need of is contained in these
[37:12] scriptures. And Lord, we believe that
[37:15] you're teaching us to to trust you more
[37:19] that you could move more in our behalf
[37:21] in our lives. And we pray today that the
[37:24] word would become awakened to us, became
[37:28] become alive to us, and that we could
[37:30] walk more in the light of your word.
[37:33] Please bless this service, this part of
[37:36] the service. Please bless your word to
[37:38] our heart. May uh it be uh just a we be
[37:43] drawn closer to you by the revelation
[37:45] thereof. And we give you praise for
[37:48] these things in advance now in Jesus
[37:50] Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless.
[37:53] You may be seated. Um I also want to say
[37:56] thank you very much to all those that uh
[38:00] to really to everybody that participated
[38:03] in some fashion form or way of uh making
[38:06] something for the potluck or um praying
[38:09] for the potluck and cleaning up and
[38:11] preparing. And there's a lot that goes
[38:14] into it. And I just appreciate everybody
[38:19] doing uh a part and what a blessing it
[38:22] is to everybody else. Um so God bless
[38:26] you for that and may we have many
[38:31] um many potlucks to come. Amen. Amen. Um
[38:37] here in this scripture, well this is a
[38:39] favorite scripture for actually I would
[38:42] think many saints. uh this scripture
[38:44] here. But let's start at verse one. It
[38:47] says, "My son, forget not my law, but
[38:50] let them keep let thine heart keep my
[38:55] commandments." So there's this
[38:58] um message going forth that you just
[39:01] can't forget the Bible. You can't forget
[39:05] the word. It needs to be part of your
[39:07] life. And if you do for length of days
[39:10] and long life and
[39:12] peace shall they add to thee. Amen. My
[39:17] they have a new law in in Michigan that
[39:20] has come out that uh if your company has
[39:24] more than 10
[39:26] employees that um it is a law now that
[39:30] you have to give them uh paid sick days.
[39:36] And there's I think maybe only five
[39:38] states or something like that that this
[39:39] law has come into effect. And we are uh
[39:42] one of them. And I know a little bit
[39:44] about having a having a company. Uh and
[39:48] and just to think that our
[39:51] days would be lengthened and that we
[39:54] would have peace. Amen. By just not
[39:57] forgetting the word of God in our life
[39:59] and just keeping the commandments. He
[40:01] said, "Let not mercy and truth forsake
[40:05] thee." Of course, we all want mercy, but
[40:08] that's not what it's meaning. It means
[40:10] when you have a chance to be merciful to
[40:12] someone, let not mercy and truth forsake
[40:15] thee. Bind them upon thy neck, write
[40:18] them upon the tables of thine heart, and
[40:20] so shall thy find favor and good
[40:24] understanding in the sight of
[40:27] God and even man. So God has a way of
[40:32] blessing you for just keeping God with
[40:36] you. That he'll even make your enemies
[40:39] to be at peace with you. The Bible says
[40:42] in verse five, "Trust in the Lord with
[40:44] all thine heart and lean not to thy own
[40:48] understanding." So we see there is one
[40:49] or the other. There's one or the other.
[40:51] We're either going to lean to our own
[40:53] understanding or we're going to trust
[40:55] the Lord. And this is the temptation
[40:58] that we all have. And I want to entitle
[41:01] this message exercising trust.
[41:06] Exercising trust. We've all been taught
[41:09] in life to
[41:11] trust. We go to restaurants, we order a
[41:14] meal, we trust that the cook is going to
[41:17] prepare this meal in a fashion that we
[41:19] can eat it.
[41:21] We don't sit there and go through the
[41:24] food and put strips to it and find out
[41:28] and and make sure it don't have
[41:30] bacteria. We have a trust that you when
[41:34] we order a Big Mac, we're going to we're
[41:36] not going to get curly
[41:39] fries. We're going to get what we
[41:41] ordered. Of course, you know, there's
[41:42] times that we don't get what we ordered,
[41:44] but you me you understand what I'm
[41:45] saying? We have we've we've we've been
[41:48] taught in life to trust as just
[41:51] naturally speaking. We go to a gas
[41:53] station, we fill up our vehicles with
[41:56] gas, we are not worried that half of the
[41:59] liquid coming out of the pump is water.
[42:02] We believe it's gas and we trust it. We
[42:04] just automatically when the car gets on
[42:06] on low or it gets on E, we we go to the
[42:09] gas station. We fill it up. We just
[42:11] trust. Amen.
[42:13] We get in our vehicles trusting that
[42:17] they will take us to church. Amen. We
[42:20] just trust and we we actually learn to
[42:24] trust
[42:25] uh when we uh learn to walk, right? We
[42:31] we see daddy and mommy say, "Come on,
[42:33] come on, you can do it." And we learn to
[42:36] trust even when we fall. we get back up
[42:40] and and we we we we we learn to trust
[42:44] when we're when we learn to talk, when
[42:46] we learn to run, we we learn to to ride
[42:49] a bicycle. Amen. When we learn to drive,
[42:52] it it's it's scary, but we learn to
[42:55] trust. And and so trust is not some
[42:57] trusting is not something odd or foreign
[43:00] to
[43:02] us. It's something that is
[43:04] natural. And really we learn to trust
[43:07] God in the same way by exercising our
[43:11] trust in
[43:12] him. How many trust in the blood of
[43:15] Jesus Christ today? We just we trust it.
[43:19] The scripture says if we confess our
[43:21] sins, he is faithful and just to forgive
[43:23] us of our sins and to cleanse us from
[43:26] all unrighteousness. There's a trust
[43:28] that we have that in the blood of Jesus
[43:31] Christ that he died for us. Right? How
[43:34] many trust in the mercy of God for their
[43:36] life? Amen.
[43:38] And and we trust in God's faithfulness.
[43:42] Lamentations 3:22 says, "It is the
[43:45] Lord's it is of the Lord's mercy that we
[43:47] are not
[43:48] consumed because of his compassions fail
[43:51] not. They are new every morning. Great
[43:54] is thy faithfulness."
[43:57] So God's mercy is there for us. His
[43:59] faithfulness is there for us. And we
[44:02] have learned to trust in it. Amen. How
[44:05] many trust that God loves you?
[44:09] We just we just don't question it. We
[44:12] don't we don't doubt it. Jeremiah 31:3
[44:15] says, "The Lord have appeared of old
[44:17] unto me, saying, "Yay, I have loved thee
[44:20] with an everlasting love. Therefore,
[44:23] with loving kindness have I drawn thee."
[44:26] God loves us with a everlasting love.
[44:30] It's not a part-time love. It isn't. He
[44:33] only loves us when we're doing good. God
[44:36] loves us all the time. Amen. In fact, he
[44:39] loves us so much that when we're not
[44:41] doing good that um the love of God is um
[44:46] our brother Jonathan quoted it and for
[44:49] some reason it
[44:50] it scripped my mind, but as many as I
[44:53] love, I rebuke and chase. And he says,
[44:55] "So he corrects us in in in that love.
[45:01] So we learn to trust the love of God.
[45:04] We all have a certain foundation of
[45:07] trust with God or in God. Now all we
[45:11] need to do is learn to exercise that
[45:14] trust into a greater trust in our
[45:17] personal lives. Now these few things
[45:19] that we made mention are the very
[45:22] foundation if we don't trust in the
[45:23] blood of Jesus Christ that we cannot
[45:25] walk in in a confidence with God. and
[45:29] and and if we don't trust in his mercies
[45:31] are going to be new for us, then we we
[45:33] can't have that that confidence. And if
[45:35] we don't trust that God loves us, we
[45:37] can't have confidence. So, we've we've
[45:39] learn to trust these main pinnacle
[45:42] principle foundational beliefs as a
[45:44] Christian. But what I'm what's on my
[45:47] heart is that we learn to trust God in
[45:49] everything. Amen.
[45:52] In our in our lives, no matter what's
[45:54] going on in our lives, we need to learn
[45:56] to trust God in those things. And and
[45:58] the Bible says, "Trust in the Lord with
[46:01] all our heart and lean not to our own
[46:04] understanding." Amen. And a lot of times
[46:07] we get in situations that we maybe don't
[46:10] necessarily need the blood right now or
[46:12] we don't necessarily need his mercy
[46:14] right now or we don't necessarily need
[46:16] to lean on his love right now. And we
[46:18] try to take the situation in control
[46:21] leaning to our own
[46:24] understanding. And therefore we we are
[46:27] we're not exercising trust. We're just
[46:30] leaving that trust for certain things.
[46:32] And before you know it, there's many
[46:33] things that are happening in our life
[46:35] that we just we realize we're not
[46:37] trusting God. And so we need to learn to
[46:40] trust the word to trust the word of the
[46:43] prophet in this age. Amen. And God knows
[46:47] whether we're exercising trust in
[46:49] ourselves, which is leaning to your own
[46:51] understanding, or if we're exercising
[46:53] trust in the word. Non 17 says, "The
[46:57] Lord is
[46:59] good, a stronghold in the day of
[47:02] trouble, and he knoweth them that trust
[47:06] in him." So if he knows them that trust
[47:10] in him, he also knows them that do not
[47:13] trust in him. to those that are leaning
[47:16] to their own
[47:17] understanding, to those who are are
[47:20] trusting in their own
[47:23] abilities. And uh we know that Jesus
[47:25] talked a little bit about these with the
[47:28] Pharisees who trusted in themselves. So
[47:31] if we're trusting in ourselves, we're
[47:33] not trusting in God. If we're leaning to
[47:36] our own understanding, that means we're
[47:37] not exercising a trust in God's word.
[47:40] God knoweth them that trust him. Luke
[47:43] 18:9 picking this thought process up of
[47:47] how God knows the difference because I
[47:49] when God looks at us every day, he knows
[47:51] whether we're trusting in him or not.
[47:54] And he spake this parable unto certain
[47:56] which trusted in
[47:59] themselves that they were more
[48:03] righteous and they despise others. So at
[48:06] this point they that compare themselves
[48:08] with them with themselves are unwise.
[48:10] when we we begin to look at others who
[48:13] got a worse problem than us, then that
[48:16] makes puts us in a category where we're
[48:18] actually trusting in ourselves more. So,
[48:21] we never never want to do that. And he
[48:24] says here that two men went into a
[48:26] temple to pray and one of the a Pharisee
[48:28] and the other a publican. And the
[48:30] Pharisees stood and prayed within
[48:31] himself, God, I I I'm thankful that I'm
[48:34] not like the
[48:36] others. That's you got to be careful. We
[48:39] always want to give thanks, but we I
[48:42] don't think it would be good to give
[48:43] thanks that you're not like
[48:45] somebody. It would be better to say,
[48:49] "Lord, may you use me to help
[48:54] others." Right. Right. And because you
[48:57] don't want to be comparing it would be
[48:59] if you're going to compare, compare
[49:01] yourself with somebody who's walking
[49:04] like you need to be walking, right?
[49:07] something that be walk press towards the
[49:10] mark something in that direction not a
[49:13] backwards direction amen so I'm not like
[49:16] other men extortioners unjust adulterers
[49:19] or even as this public and I I even fast
[49:22] twice a week I give tithes of all that I
[49:24] possess which should be done correct
[49:27] should be done and uh the the publican
[49:31] standing a far off would not so much
[49:33] lift up his eyes unto heaven but
[49:35] smokeote his breast saying God be
[49:37] merciful to me a sinner. So he was
[49:40] looking for mercy, new mercy. He was
[49:44] looking for new mercy. The other one was
[49:46] not looking for mercy. Kind of felt
[49:48] maybe he didn't need it, right? Because
[49:50] he was comparing himself with somebody
[49:52] else. So he didn't ask for mercy. He
[49:56] says, "I tell you that this man went to
[49:57] his house justified rather than the
[49:59] other. For everyone that exaltth himself
[50:02] shall be abased, and he that humble
[50:04] himself shall be
[50:06] exalted. So we don't want to trust in
[50:09] herself. And God knows if we're trusting
[50:12] in him or trusting in
[50:14] ourselves. So this this Pharisee, he
[50:16] basically leaned to his own
[50:18] understanding. I can see by the life
[50:20] that's being lived by this man that is
[50:22] this is not acceptable to God. I
[50:24] therefore say, God, thank you that I'm
[50:27] not like them. We don't want to do that.
[50:29] As much as we are thankful for God's
[50:32] deliverance, we never want to thank him
[50:34] in the view of that. Amen.
[50:37] A lot of times we're tempted to lean to
[50:39] our understanding about situations that
[50:42] we hear. And Jesus talks about it here
[50:44] in Luke chapter 13 verse number one.
[50:48] There were present at that season some
[50:51] that told him of the Galileans whose
[50:53] blood Pilate had mingled with their
[50:55] sacrifices. And Jesus answering and said
[50:57] unto them, suppose ye, in other words,
[51:00] let's get into your understanding here.
[51:02] Suppose ye that the Galileans were
[51:04] sinners above all the Galileans because
[51:06] they suffered such things. In other
[51:09] words, there has to be a reason that
[51:10] this happened to them and not
[51:13] others. And Jesus says, I tell you, nay,
[51:16] but except you repent, you shall
[51:18] likewise perish. In other words, don't
[51:21] think like that. Don't lean to your own
[51:23] understanding why somebody's sick, why
[51:25] somebody's going through a trial, why
[51:27] this is happening, why that's happening
[51:29] to their family. What? Don't do that.
[51:31] Don't lean to your own understanding.
[51:34] Just we don't know. The only thing that
[51:36] we know is that we should take God's
[51:39] word and bind it in our around our neck
[51:42] and mercy and hold it in our heart and
[51:45] keep God's commandments. That's what we
[51:46] know. That's what the Bible says that we
[51:48] know. But we don't know what's happening
[51:50] out there.
[51:52] Or of those 18 upon whom the tower of
[51:55] shalom fell and slew them, think ye not
[51:57] that they were sinners above all the men
[51:59] that dwelt in Jerusalem, I tell you nay,
[52:02] but except you repent, ye shall all
[52:04] likewise perish. So we see here that
[52:06] what God wants us to do to just repent,
[52:10] trust in him, and that he will lead us,
[52:14] amen, into all truth. Now these are
[52:17] basically these scriptures are real life
[52:19] examples of battles that can transpire
[52:21] in our
[52:23] minds. And when we are trusting in
[52:25] oursel we're really not trusting in the
[52:27] word of
[52:29] God. Psalms chapter 2 verse 12 says and
[52:32] by the way if we don't say amen we're
[52:35] going to have a two-hour service today.
[52:37] I just want to make that real clear. And
[52:39] we need to like triple up the amens
[52:41] because we don't got as many people as
[52:42] we normally do here.
[52:45] We can't put it all on Brother Bruce.
[52:47] You know, Brother Bruce is he's a he's a
[52:52] wow. He's a wow. He just Amens's the
[52:55] word. And we just we need to amen amen
[53:00] the word. Amen. The Psalms 2:12 says,
[53:02] "Kiss the sun." Notice that's the s o n,
[53:06] not the su n.
[53:09] Kiss the son, lest he be angry, and ye
[53:13] perish from the way when his wrath is
[53:16] kindled, but a little. Blessed are all
[53:20] they that put their trust in him. Amen.
[53:26] Now, God is a God. That word kiss, it
[53:29] means to touch him or fasten up to him.
[53:32] God is a God that
[53:35] wants to be close with us.
[53:39] It means uh he wants
[53:43] us to that for his word to be important
[53:47] to us and to keep his word in our
[53:50] heart and to trust in him and not to
[53:54] lean to our own
[53:56] understanding. So we have a choice. When
[53:59] we lean to our own understanding, he's
[54:01] going to get angry
[54:03] because he's a jealous God.
[54:06] But when we when we come to him and we
[54:08] embrace him and say, "God, I'm not I'm
[54:10] not going to lean to my own
[54:12] understanding, but I'm just going to
[54:13] trust you even though I can't figure it
[54:14] out." That's when you're kissing the
[54:18] sun. That word trust means to flee for
[54:22] protection, to have hope, or to make
[54:24] refuge. And blessed are they that flee
[54:28] to him for
[54:29] protection. This is what Jonah did. We
[54:32] talked about that last Wednesday.
[54:35] God orchestrated a a situation to cause
[54:38] Jonah to flee to
[54:41] God instead of fleeing away from God
[54:44] because that's usually what we do when
[54:47] we're trusting in ourselves. We're we're
[54:49] we got I got this handled
[54:51] God. Jonah decided to kiss the
[54:56] son lest he be angry and perish because
[54:59] that's what was happening. Jonah decided
[55:02] to exercise trust in the Lord.
[55:05] Jonah decided to flee for protection and
[55:08] to make God his refuge. And what did God
[55:11] do? God blessed him for it. Even in his
[55:14] disobedience, he when he came to him
[55:17] instantly, God was there to deliver him.
[55:19] Amen. Blessed are all they that put
[55:22] their trust in him. I believe the more
[55:24] that we can exercise, I'm going to trust
[55:27] you, God. I'm going to trust your word.
[55:28] I'm going to trust what the prophet said
[55:30] about this subject. The more that we can
[55:32] do this, we'll see our lives will be
[55:34] blessed more than we could ever bless
[55:35] ourselves with all the other knowledge
[55:37] and money and whatever we could have.
[55:40] Amen. Because
[55:43] usually when
[55:45] we use our
[55:49] smarts to get blessed the way we want to
[55:52] get blessed, what happens is corruption
[55:54] comes after that. It's the truth. Amen.
[55:57] It's the truth. But you let God do it
[56:01] and God will keep it. Amen. That is the
[56:05] truth. We all need to kiss the son the
[56:09] more in our trials. So much more when
[56:12] we're going that's the time to kiss God
[56:14] is when we're in our trial. We need to
[56:16] exercise trust more in God's word while
[56:19] we're going through our trials. Not go
[56:21] through the trial, work it out, come
[56:23] back and and say, "Well, yeah, I trusted
[56:25] God." How I This is so This is a sure
[56:31] thing. We've all heard people fighting
[56:34] through their trials. When the trial was
[56:36] over, they they were testifying that
[56:38] they were trusting
[56:41] God. And to be honest with you, God will
[56:45] take us to the limit, right?
[56:49] Because he wants us to completely trust
[56:51] in him. And we we have all these stories
[56:53] in the Bible with the three Hebrew
[56:56] children and so many stories that that
[56:59] show that God takes us right to the end
[57:02] to see if we're really going to trust
[57:03] him. It's what he did with the children
[57:05] of Israel that was that came out of
[57:08] Egypt. He gave them chance after chance
[57:12] to prove to them, give them a chance to
[57:15] see whether they were going to trust God
[57:17] or not. And they murmured. They
[57:18] complained. They didn't put their heart
[57:20] into it. They were just they were going
[57:22] along with the flow. And yeah, God
[57:24] blessed them for 40 years. They they
[57:27] were fed. They had Blue Cross, Blue
[57:29] Shield, which I don't know. We have Blue
[57:32] Cross and Blue Shield. We still got to
[57:33] pay this big bill. I don't I I still
[57:36] don't get it. But I mean, they they were
[57:39] blessed beyond Blue Cross and Blue
[57:41] Shield. And yet at the
[57:44] end, God did not allow them to go into
[57:47] the promised land. So God can bless us
[57:50] in other ways and not spiritual ways.
[57:53] And we would much rather be blessed
[57:56] spiritually, right, than naturally. 1
[57:59] Peter chapter 1:7 1 Peter chapter 1
[58:01] vers7 says that the trial of your faith
[58:07] the very trial of your faith being much
[58:12] more precious than gold or anything in
[58:17] this world that perishes.
[58:21] though it be tried with fire, might be
[58:25] found unto praise and honor and glory at
[58:28] the appearing of Jesus Christ. So we
[58:31] could live in a mansion, we could have a
[58:33] a a gold uh driveway, we can have a gold
[58:36] door knobs, we can we can have so much
[58:39] gold that we could literally be looked
[58:42] at as the having the most gold in
[58:45] America.
[58:48] But the very fact that you're going
[58:50] through a trial tomorrow, God looks at
[58:52] that as more
[58:55] precious. The trial, the actual trial
[58:58] that you're going through because the
[59:01] trial is open. It gives
[59:03] opportunity for faith. Amen.
[59:09] And to me, when we're going through a
[59:11] trial, like when is this thing going to
[59:13] be over? Like why am I having to go? Why
[59:17] me, Lord? Why again?
[59:19] Why? But the trial and it doesn't matter
[59:24] if it's mental, physical, financial, it
[59:28] doesn't matter the trial. The very fact
[59:31] that there's a trial and you're in a
[59:33] spot of am I going to lean to my own
[59:35] understanding or am I going to look to
[59:38] God? That moment is much more precious
[59:41] than gold.
[59:43] If if you make the decision because the
[59:47] the scripture says might be found onto
[59:52] praise and honor and gloring glory at
[59:55] the appearing of Jesus Christ because if
[59:57] you lean to your own understanding it's
[59:59] not to God's praise. It's not to to to
[1:00:02] God's honor to God's glory because when
[1:00:05] you trust God today you're taking that
[1:00:07] with you when he comes.
[1:00:10] It doesn't stop. That stays with your
[1:00:14] character forever. I mean, if you look
[1:00:16] at uh David when he went to got Goliath,
[1:00:20] he still had with his character that he
[1:00:23] got the lion, that he got the bear in
[1:00:25] the past. Right. Right. It stayed with
[1:00:27] him. And every time you trust the Lord
[1:00:30] in little trials, every time you
[1:00:31] exercise a trust, that is staying with
[1:00:35] you till a rapture happens. And it is
[1:00:38] needed to build to build our faith is
[1:00:42] going to be tried. And I'll say it like
[1:00:45] this. This trial is more precious to
[1:00:50] God than it should be to
[1:00:53] us, right? We look at trials as, "Oh,
[1:00:57] why do I got to go through
[1:00:59] this?" And God's saying, "We got an
[1:01:02] opportunity to build some character
[1:01:04] here." Amen. And we need to look at
[1:01:06] things the way God does. Amen. It goes
[1:01:09] to show you that we're we're putting
[1:01:12] we're not having the right interest that
[1:01:15] God is having when we're feeling those
[1:01:18] things.
[1:01:20] But I want to say this, the scripture is
[1:01:23] saying is we're going to be tried with
[1:01:25] fire.
[1:01:29] God is going to take us to the limit of
[1:01:33] really being
[1:01:37] tried. And we've all gone through trials
[1:01:39] and just like totally failed and
[1:01:43] like I just totally missed that thing.
[1:01:46] And then we've gone through
[1:01:49] trials and we've had battles and we
[1:01:51] ended up trusting God at the end.
[1:01:56] We need
[1:01:58] God for every
[1:02:00] trial. We need God for every trial.
[1:02:05] Amen. If we have God for every trial, we
[1:02:08] would not lean to our own understanding.
[1:02:10] Amen. And Jesus said to the church in
[1:02:12] Leodysia, he said, "I counsel thee to
[1:02:15] buy of me gold tried in the fire." Now
[1:02:22] gold represents the very life of God.
[1:02:25] Amen. The ark of the covenant was made
[1:02:28] out of wood representing humanity, but
[1:02:31] it was overlaid with gold representing
[1:02:34] God. The the ark of the covenant which
[1:02:37] represents the heart of man is overlaid
[1:02:39] with the life of God. And and and we
[1:02:42] cannot go through a trial without God
[1:02:45] and be an overcomer. Right? We'll lean
[1:02:48] to our own understanding. But the more
[1:02:50] of of the word of God that we can get in
[1:02:52] our heart and keep the commandments and
[1:02:55] hold to them and and and bind them
[1:02:56] around the neck and in other words, have
[1:02:58] the gold on the inside, have it on the
[1:03:00] outside, have gold everywhere. You've
[1:03:02] got the life of God when you're going
[1:03:03] through your trial. You'll be able to be
[1:03:06] an overcomer. Amen.
[1:03:12] The gold is what brings the power to
[1:03:15] overcome the devil. In other words, we
[1:03:17] don't have this. You know, the devil
[1:03:19] wants to what are you going to do now?
[1:03:20] What are you going to do now? Figure
[1:03:22] this out. What are you going to do right
[1:03:23] now? What about this? And he brings all
[1:03:25] this pressure on
[1:03:27] you. But the gold says, I'm trusting
[1:03:30] God. Amen. I don't need to figure
[1:03:33] anything out. I'm not the boss. He's the
[1:03:36] boss. I'm just trusting in him. It's so
[1:03:40] easy. It's so easy when you don't have
[1:03:44] to try to figure it out, right? and you
[1:03:46] just trust in him. The hour is here and
[1:03:48] the hour is coming that we're going to
[1:03:50] be tried to our very limits.
[1:03:54] So, we need to when things are not real
[1:03:56] bad, I'm telling you, we need to have
[1:03:57] this. We need to exercise a greater
[1:03:59] trust for God in our lives.
[1:04:02] Jesus said in John
[1:04:04] 16:33, "These things have I spoken unto
[1:04:08] you that you might have peace. In the
[1:04:12] world you shall have tribulation, but be
[1:04:15] of good cheer. I have overcome the
[1:04:19] world. Now I I when I would used I read
[1:04:22] this when I was not very spiritual at
[1:04:24] one time and not that I'm spiritual now.
[1:04:28] That was a bad way of saying that. But I
[1:04:30] as a young Christian, I remember reading
[1:04:32] this and I'd say, "Well, yeah, you had
[1:04:36] peace. You're you're you're you're God.
[1:04:38] You got you got peace and and and and
[1:04:40] and and every and you
[1:04:42] overcame but but how is that going to
[1:04:46] help me? How am I going to be cheerful
[1:04:47] about
[1:04:48] me? But what Jesus is saying here that
[1:04:51] if he is inside of me, I don't have to
[1:04:55] worry that I can be cheerful about the
[1:04:59] trial I'm going through because greater
[1:05:02] is he that's in me than he that's in
[1:05:03] this trial. And I and I can be full of
[1:05:06] joy. Count it all joy when you fall into
[1:05:09] diverse temptations. Think it not
[1:05:12] strange the fiery trials which are to
[1:05:14] try
[1:05:16] you. So the trial of your fair uh the
[1:05:19] trial of your face 1 Peter 1:7 again the
[1:05:22] trial of your faith being much more
[1:05:24] precious than gold that perisheth though
[1:05:26] it be tried with fire might be found
[1:05:28] into praise and honor and glory at the
[1:05:30] appearing of Jesus Christ. uh whom
[1:05:33] having not seen.
[1:05:38] Amen. He's not
[1:05:41] here. I don't see him. I see all this
[1:05:44] problem with all these people, but I
[1:05:47] don't see him. But I know that he's
[1:05:51] here. His word is in the ark. I believe
[1:05:56] him. He's here. Having whom having not
[1:05:59] seen you love him in whom though not
[1:06:03] seeing him though now you see him not
[1:06:06] yet believing you rejoice with joy
[1:06:10] unspeakable and full of glory receiving
[1:06:12] look at this the end of your trust the
[1:06:16] end of your faith even the salvation of
[1:06:20] your
[1:06:21] souls. Too many people say, "Well, I
[1:06:25] repented. I got baptized and I got
[1:06:31] saved." The Bible does say, "He that is
[1:06:34] bapt he that believeth is baptized shall
[1:06:36] be
[1:06:37] saved." But it doesn't say all you have
[1:06:41] to do
[1:06:43] is believe, get baptized, repent, be
[1:06:46] baptized, and get saved. You have to you
[1:06:49] have to go on. You have to finish your
[1:06:52] walk with God.
[1:06:54] You have to receive the end of your
[1:06:56] faith. The end of your faith is the
[1:06:59] salvation of your soul. And every day,
[1:07:01] today is the day of salvation. So what
[1:07:04] you know, that's the beginning. And too
[1:07:06] many people stop at the beginning and
[1:07:09] think that they're saved and they they
[1:07:10] just go off and it doesn't matter what
[1:07:12] they do with their lives. And it's so
[1:07:13] sad because it's just the devil that's
[1:07:16] tricked them. Hebrews 3:14 says, "For we
[1:07:19] have made if for I'm sorry, for we are
[1:07:21] made partakers of Christ if we hold the
[1:07:25] beginning of our confidence steadfast
[1:07:29] unto the end." Amen. Now, this is the
[1:07:32] gospel that we we need to be we need to
[1:07:35] be adhering to is a gospel that every
[1:07:38] day you're working on trusting God more
[1:07:42] and more and and holding to him that
[1:07:44] having the confidence. I'm rejoicing
[1:07:46] with joy unspeakable and full of glory.
[1:07:49] I'm not going to just allow these things
[1:07:51] to get me down, to get me discouraged,
[1:07:53] but I'm going to stay trusting the
[1:07:56] Lord. Now the real trials that we go
[1:07:59] through are really in our
[1:08:04] mind. Now I
[1:08:06] understand those of us that are battling
[1:08:11] pain. I know that at times they affect
[1:08:15] our bodies. They affect relationships.
[1:08:18] They affect our jobs. They affect our
[1:08:21] relationships. And we look at those as
[1:08:24] the
[1:08:25] trial. But the real battle ultimately
[1:08:28] takes place in our mind because there is
[1:08:30] where the decision is going to be made
[1:08:33] of how we're going to view this that
[1:08:35] we're going through.
[1:08:39] And this is where we succumb to fear and
[1:08:42] lean to our own understanding
[1:08:46] or we trust God's
[1:08:48] word about the situation. There are many
[1:08:51] opportunities every day that we have to
[1:08:53] exercise our trust in God's word just
[1:08:56] like there's many opportunities every
[1:08:58] day to lean to our own understanding.
[1:09:00] Right? It just they're just there and
[1:09:02] and we I I would think that we don't
[1:09:05] realize how much opportunity there is to
[1:09:09] lean to one or the other. But I think if
[1:09:12] we if we take
[1:09:14] time to ask ourselves, am I leaning to
[1:09:17] my own understanding of this situation
[1:09:19] or what does the word say I should
[1:09:22] do? Our minds can seem like a playground
[1:09:26] sometimes for the devil to play around
[1:09:28] in. You ever just been
[1:09:31] so confused in your mind? just I mean
[1:09:34] you got thoughts going everywhere can't
[1:09:37] really find a a solid foundation because
[1:09:40] of the reasoning the devil brings us
[1:09:42] about
[1:09:44] things. So our minds can be a real
[1:09:47] playground and and and this is where I
[1:09:50] you we got to understand when we come
[1:09:52] into our trial whatever it is every
[1:09:54] situation and it doesn't matter how you
[1:09:57] know I just say you just walk into a
[1:09:59] room and somebody starts yelling at you.
[1:10:00] Okay what are you going to do at that
[1:10:02] point?
[1:10:03] Somebody says something rude. Somebody
[1:10:04] says something bad. What are you going
[1:10:05] to do? Are you going to lean to your own
[1:10:07] understanding or you going to lean on
[1:10:08] the word? I mean, this is a choice that
[1:10:11] we make. And sometimes if you're not
[1:10:15] careful, your mind can become a
[1:10:17] playground.
[1:10:19] In other words, the devil is going to
[1:10:21] give you reasons why to straighten that
[1:10:22] person out. This is the last time.
[1:10:27] So
[1:10:29] sometimes you you got a long trial that
[1:10:33] you've been dealing with and you're
[1:10:36] constantly teeter toawing back and forth
[1:10:41] about this situation, pivoting back and
[1:10:43] forth between two ideas. I'm saying our
[1:10:47] mind can be like a playground, a teeter
[1:10:49] totter or some swings. There's swings in
[1:10:52] the park too in the playground.
[1:10:56] swinging
[1:10:57] up and down from one side to the other
[1:11:01] about an idea this way or that way and
[1:11:05] just our minds not being able to take a
[1:11:08] hold of the the word of God in this
[1:11:13] situation because the devil we've been
[1:11:15] so used to leaning to our own
[1:11:17] understanding that we listen to the
[1:11:18] devil too much. Amen. Or sometimes we
[1:11:22] just get so bothered by something that
[1:11:24] we're going around on a a miracle round
[1:11:27] around and around and around and around
[1:11:28] and our minds just feel so fed up and
[1:11:32] get dizzy because of a situation. Can't
[1:11:36] think straight, can't seem to calm down,
[1:11:39] can't stop spinning in our
[1:11:42] minds. It's very easy to get caught
[1:11:46] between trusting God and our own under
[1:11:49] and leaning to our own
[1:11:51] understanding. The scripture says, "How
[1:11:54] long haul ye between two opinions? If
[1:11:57] the Lord be God, follow him. But if not,
[1:11:59] then don't." Amen. So, we got to make a
[1:12:01] decision in our mind. Make it quick.
[1:12:05] And I'll say it like this. The majority
[1:12:06] of the time, the majority of the time in
[1:12:10] a trial, your understanding is not going
[1:12:13] to line up with God's
[1:12:16] word because if it did, then you
[1:12:18] wouldn't need to trust God.
[1:12:21] So, the very
[1:12:23] fact that trusting God is going to put
[1:12:27] you beyond your normal thinking. Let me
[1:12:30] give you an example. I am so glad that
[1:12:33] when I came to church
[1:12:36] and I was young in the Lord, you might
[1:12:39] say I was
[1:12:40] naive. You might say I was stupid. I was
[1:12:44] dumb. That I really didn't have much
[1:12:48] intelligence. And so when it came across
[1:12:51] the pulpit and showed me in the
[1:12:54] scriptures to pay your
[1:12:57] tithes, I just simply paid the tithe. I
[1:13:00] never took any time to think about
[1:13:02] whether I could afford to pay my tithe
[1:13:04] or
[1:13:05] not. I because I wasn't used to it. All
[1:13:09] my money that came in, well, basically
[1:13:12] it went
[1:13:15] out. Whatever money had, I spent it. You
[1:13:18] know, the Bible says money has wings.
[1:13:21] Whatever came in went out. All of a
[1:13:23] sudden, in the time of my life, I am
[1:13:26] told 10% goes to the Lord.
[1:13:29] Whoa. This I'm not used
[1:13:31] to. So now I got to sit here and I got
[1:13:34] to make a
[1:13:35] decision. I I got to wait till
[1:13:38] everything's covered and then I'll give
[1:13:40] my 10%. That makes like perfect human
[1:13:43] sense, right? Or I can just trust the
[1:13:47] word and give the 10% whether I got it
[1:13:50] figured out or not. And I'm so glad that
[1:13:53] when I came into the the message, I
[1:13:56] began to to obey the message just as I
[1:13:59] heard it and didn't try to figure it
[1:14:01] out. Because our own understanding can
[1:14:04] mess us up. Amen. Can really mess us up.
[1:14:08] Trust in the Lord. Don't let him use
[1:14:10] your mind as a playground. Amen.
[1:14:13] Ephesians chapter 6:10 says, "Finally,
[1:14:16] my brethren, be strong in the Lord and
[1:14:20] the power of his might." So, if we're
[1:14:23] going to be strong, be strong in the
[1:14:25] Lord. Put on the whole armor of God,
[1:14:28] right? That you may be able to stand
[1:14:30] against the ws of the
[1:14:33] devil. The W.
[1:14:36] You ever been watching something on TV
[1:14:39] or the the computer or just some
[1:14:42] commercial and all of a sudden,
[1:14:45] especially around Halloween, they're
[1:14:48] showing these uh evil uh tormenting
[1:14:53] movies and and and people that are
[1:14:56] killing people and tormenting people and
[1:14:59] and dummies walking around dead and I
[1:15:02] don't know, you know what I'm talking
[1:15:03] about.
[1:15:05] Well, people look at that quickly say,
[1:15:08] "Well, that, you know, I don't want to
[1:15:09] watch that. I won't I won't I won't be
[1:15:11] able to sleep at night." Now, some
[1:15:12] people feed on that
[1:15:14] stuff,
[1:15:15] but that looks like that's the obvious
[1:15:18] devil.
[1:15:20] But the devil that we need to think
[1:15:22] about is the devil that comes to our
[1:15:25] minds, who doesn't have pitchforks and
[1:15:28] doesn't look like that and doesn't act
[1:15:30] like that, but he comes with a a suit on
[1:15:34] and he's got a briefcase and he's very
[1:15:37] intelligent and he's able to convince us
[1:15:40] by by asking us questions in our in our
[1:15:45] to get us in our reasoning to question
[1:15:48] God. And verse 12 says, "For we wrestle
[1:15:51] not against flesh and
[1:15:55] blood, but against principalities,
[1:15:57] against powers, against their rulers of
[1:16:00] the darkness of this world, against
[1:16:02] spiritual wickedness in high places."
[1:16:04] Now you walk into Walmart, you talk to
[1:16:08] the greeter, you talk to the people that
[1:16:10] you talk to anybody in there and you ask
[1:16:13] them if they have wrestled against
[1:16:16] principalities and powers and the rulers
[1:16:18] of darkness of this world, against
[1:16:19] spiritual wickedness in high places, and
[1:16:21] they're going to probably tell you that
[1:16:23] they don't even understand what you're
[1:16:25] talking about.
[1:16:28] Amen. We should know the devil talks to
[1:16:32] us all the time. Amen.
[1:16:34] In fact, he comes to church and he tries
[1:16:36] to get your mind on other things.
[1:16:40] Get you thinking about other things,
[1:16:43] get you sometimes bothered, get you
[1:16:45] tired, get you get get you away from the
[1:16:48] word because this is the the word is
[1:16:50] exposing the devil. And the devil don't
[1:16:53] want you to know he's talking to you.
[1:16:58] Wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[1:17:01] of God that ye may be able to withstand
[1:17:05] in the evil day. How many knows we're
[1:17:07] living in that evil day? That's right.
[1:17:10] This is it. It is it has not been as bad
[1:17:13] in the whole world as it is now.
[1:17:17] I mean when they were back there and
[1:17:19] they were, you know, killing people, we
[1:17:21] could look, okay, that was bad. They
[1:17:22] killed 68 million Protestants. We know
[1:17:25] that was bad. That was wrong. But today,
[1:17:28] evil is so bad that people are doing
[1:17:31] evil and they're not bothered about
[1:17:35] it. It's
[1:17:38] lukewarm. They don't even recognize
[1:17:41] it. And and and and
[1:17:43] and souls are being destroyed. 1 Peter
[1:17:47] chapter 5:6 says, "Humble yourselves
[1:17:50] therefore under the mighty hand of God
[1:17:53] that he may exalt you in due time." So
[1:17:58] there is the the remedy there to put the
[1:18:00] word first. Humble yourself under the
[1:18:03] word. Not not not just humble yourself
[1:18:06] under the thought that me and God God
[1:18:09] loves me. God saved me. God's merciful
[1:18:11] to me, but humble yourself under the
[1:18:13] word because the word is for us. And
[1:18:16] it's it is our job to get into the word
[1:18:19] to listen to the tapes every day and as
[1:18:22] often as we can spend time so we can
[1:18:25] hide God's word or get the go. How do
[1:18:28] you get the gold? How do you get the
[1:18:30] gold inlaid in your heart? It it's the
[1:18:33] word. You can't get God in your heart
[1:18:35] without the
[1:18:36] word. You can't. You can't. I mean God
[1:18:41] is not going to leave his word. So we
[1:18:43] got to take the word, put it in our
[1:18:44] heart, put it in our lives, and and and
[1:18:47] so we humble ourselves under that word,
[1:18:49] casting all your care upon him. For we
[1:18:52] care for you, be sober, be vigilant,
[1:18:54] because your adversary, the devil, as a
[1:18:56] roaring lion, walketh about, seeking
[1:18:58] whom he may devour, whom resists,
[1:19:01] steadfast in faith, knowing that the
[1:19:03] same afflictions are accomplished in
[1:19:05] your brethren that are around that that
[1:19:07] are in the world. I wonder if we could
[1:19:09] do this as a as a homework assignment.
[1:19:12] If we could go home this week and write
[1:19:16] down at the end of the day where the
[1:19:19] devil where you met the
[1:19:22] devil. Just when you get home at the end
[1:19:25] of the day, take a notebook and say, "I
[1:19:28] met this spiritual
[1:19:30] wickedness or this principality or this
[1:19:34] ruler of darkness. I met him today here
[1:19:37] in this
[1:19:39] thought because I think we get so used
[1:19:42] to the enemy talking to us that we don't
[1:19:45] recognize it's him.
[1:19:48] And the the the problem with this is we
[1:19:50] can't overcome him if we don't recognize
[1:19:53] him. So, it's time that we start to
[1:19:55] recognize the devil and all his tricks.
[1:19:59] It's time to pull down the strongholds.
[1:20:03] They cast down reasoning to stop the the
[1:20:05] margo round that goes around in our our
[1:20:07] our minds that spin out of control. It
[1:20:11] it's time to make sure that our mind is
[1:20:13] thinking on only good things. Right?
[1:20:16] Think on these things. Amen. Now, the
[1:20:20] ideal thing is learning to keep a
[1:20:26] sign
[1:20:28] up in your mind that the park is
[1:20:32] permanently closed to the
[1:20:36] devil. Permanently closed. You can't
[1:20:38] come in here. In other words, you're
[1:20:41] there as soon as a thought comes in to
[1:20:43] say no.
[1:20:46] Did you ever go
[1:20:47] somewhere and after you drove a long
[1:20:50] distance you discovered that they were
[1:20:53] closed? Some restaurant or something?
[1:20:57] It's very
[1:20:58] disappointing that that it's
[1:21:02] closed. That's what we have to learn to
[1:21:04] do is disappoint the devil.
[1:21:08] Just nope, you can't come here anymore.
[1:21:11] You used to, but it's closed to you.
[1:21:14] Now, this mind is just for the Lord.
[1:21:17] Amen. Keep that neon sign up flashing
[1:21:20] bright closed to the devil permanently.
[1:21:23] Brother Brandham said in the message,
[1:21:24] "How can I overcome?" And I read this uh
[1:21:26] not too long ago, but I want to re I
[1:21:28] want to quote it again because I think
[1:21:30] it's a very good quote. Overcome means
[1:21:33] to recognize the devil in every one of
[1:21:36] his
[1:21:37] tricks. Lots of people say there's no
[1:21:40] devil. It's just a thought. He says,
[1:21:41] "Don't you believe that? That's there's
[1:21:43] a real devil. He's just as real as you
[1:21:45] and Amen. or anybody, a real devil. And
[1:21:48] you must recognize him real." Amen. You
[1:21:52] must know he's a devil.
[1:21:55] Then that same time that you recognize
[1:21:57] him and know that he's a devil and that
[1:21:59] he's against you. Then to overcome, you
[1:22:04] must recognize that God in you is
[1:22:07] greater and mightier than he is. Right?
[1:22:11] And that the one that's in you has
[1:22:14] already overcame him. Amen. And by his
[1:22:18] grace, you're more than a match for him.
[1:22:20] Right? That's real overcoming when you
[1:22:26] recognize Psalms 34:22 says, "The Lord
[1:22:29] redeemth the soul of his servants, and
[1:22:31] none of them that trust in him shall be
[1:22:34] desolate." So there's God is not going
[1:22:36] to leave you alone when you trust in
[1:22:40] him. I think uh Acts 24:16. It's not up
[1:22:45] there, but if you want to write it down,
[1:22:46] it says, "Here in do I
[1:22:49] exercise myself to always have a
[1:22:52] conscience void of offense toward God
[1:22:55] and toward men." You can know that
[1:22:59] you're you're doing the right thing when
[1:23:01] you're not when you're when you're when
[1:23:03] you're careful not to offend
[1:23:06] others, right? You don't want to
[1:23:09] exercise yourself as being forward, but
[1:23:12] but exercise yourself as being Christ,
[1:23:15] right, to others. Amen. And hold that
[1:23:18] word in your heart. Amen. If we got just
[1:23:21] a little bit of time, I wanted to read
[1:23:23] uh uh the book of 2 Kings chapter 4, a
[1:23:27] little bit about Elisha raising the
[1:23:29] Shunomite son. Do you remember that
[1:23:31] story? Amen. And I think you know this
[1:23:34] is a wonderful story how uh as an
[1:23:38] example of this woman who really
[1:23:41] exercised trust in
[1:23:43] God. She exercised trust and I just want
[1:23:47] to start reading it here in 2 Kings 4
[1:23:50] verse number 8. And it fell on a day
[1:23:52] that Elisha passed to Shu him where was
[1:23:55] a great woman and she constrained him to
[1:23:58] eat bread. And so it was that as often
[1:24:00] as he passed by, he turned in either uh
[1:24:03] thither to eat bread. And she said unto
[1:24:06] her husband, Behold now I perceive that
[1:24:09] this is a holy man of God which passeth
[1:24:12] by us continually. Now notice this was a
[1:24:17] prophet, and in her heart she wanted to
[1:24:20] do something good for the prophet. Let
[1:24:24] us make a little chamber, I pray thee,
[1:24:27] on the wall, and let us set for him
[1:24:30] there a bed, and a table, and a stew,
[1:24:32] and a candlestick. And it shall be that
[1:24:34] when he come to us, that he shall turn
[1:24:37] in thither. And it found a day that he
[1:24:39] came thither, and he turned to the
[1:24:41] chamber, and lay there, and he said to
[1:24:44] Gahhesi his servant, "Call this
[1:24:47] Shunomite." And when he called her, she
[1:24:50] stood before him. And he said unto him,
[1:24:53] And he said unto him, Say now unto her,
[1:24:56] "Behold, thou has been careful for us
[1:24:59] with all this care, what is to be done
[1:25:02] for thee. What does thou uh what uh
[1:25:06] wouldest thou be spoken for to the king
[1:25:09] or to the captain or the host?" And she
[1:25:12] answered, "I dwell among my own people."
[1:25:15] In other words, no thank you. And he
[1:25:17] said, "What then is it to be done for
[1:25:19] her?" And Gahesi answered, "Verily, she
[1:25:23] have no child, and her husband is old."
[1:25:26] And he said, "Call her." And when he
[1:25:28] called her, she stood in the door. And
[1:25:31] he said, "About this season, according
[1:25:34] to the time of life, thou shalt embrace
[1:25:36] the sun." And she said, "Nay, my
[1:25:41] lord, thou man of God, do not lie unto
[1:25:46] thy handmade."
[1:25:49] I I think she was like beside
[1:25:53] herself. And the woman conceived and
[1:25:56] bare a son at the season that Elisha had
[1:26:00] said unto her according to the time of
[1:26:02] life. And when the child was grown, it
[1:26:06] fell on a day that he went out to the
[1:26:08] his father to the reapers. And he said
[1:26:11] unto his father, "My head, my head." And
[1:26:14] he said to the lad, "Carry him to his
[1:26:16] mother." And when he had taken him, he
[1:26:19] and brought him to his mother, he sat on
[1:26:22] her knee till noon and then
[1:26:27] died. And she went up and laid him on
[1:26:32] the bed of the man of God, not not the
[1:26:35] lad's
[1:26:36] bed, but the man of God. And shut the
[1:26:40] door upon him and went
[1:26:46] out.
[1:26:47] Now, something was happening. She was
[1:26:50] definitely not leaning to her own
[1:26:52] understanding here.
[1:26:54] I mean it was like well okay we got to
[1:26:56] just call the funeral this has
[1:27:00] happened. But something was happening to
[1:27:03] her. She had a trust in God because the
[1:27:07] word of the prophet told her that you're
[1:27:10] going to have a
[1:27:11] son. And she knew something inside of
[1:27:14] her said I know that if God would give
[1:27:16] me a son it wouldn't just only last this
[1:27:20] long and die. So there's this thing that
[1:27:23] was happening. So you could see the
[1:27:24] trust beginning to be exercised inside
[1:27:27] of her. And she called unto her husband
[1:27:29] and said, "Send me, I pray thee, one of
[1:27:32] the young men and one of the asses that
[1:27:35] I may run to the man of God and come
[1:27:38] again." And he said, "Wherefore wil thou
[1:27:40] go to him today? It is neither noon nor
[1:27:43] Sabbath." And she said, "It shall be
[1:27:50] well." Something inside of her just
[1:27:54] believed.
[1:27:56] She She couldn't explain it, but her
[1:28:00] testimony was, "It's going to be well."
[1:28:02] Amen. It shall be well. I notice how she
[1:28:05] said that it shall be well. Then she
[1:28:08] saddled an ass and said to the servant,
[1:28:10] "Drive and go forward. Slack not thy
[1:28:13] writing for me except I bid thee. So she
[1:28:16] went and came unto the man of God to
[1:28:18] Mount Carmel. And it came to pass when
[1:28:21] the man of God saw her a far off and he
[1:28:23] said to the ga gahesi his servant,
[1:28:26] behold yonder is that
[1:28:29] shunomite and uh run now I pray thee to
[1:28:33] meet her and say to her, Is it well with
[1:28:36] thee? Is it well with thy husband? Is it
[1:28:40] well with the child? And she answered,
[1:28:44] "It is well." Now, I got a
[1:28:47] question. Was it really well with her
[1:28:51] child? Why was she saying it is
[1:29:01] well? She was not leaning to her own
[1:29:04] understanding.
[1:29:05] her own human understanding is of course
[1:29:08] things are not well that's why I've come
[1:29:10] here but she wasn't leaning towards that
[1:29:14] she was really putting her trust in the
[1:29:17] word of the
[1:29:21] prophet and I'll tell you this is a type
[1:29:23] for our age because God has given us a
[1:29:25] prophet with the word and I'll tell you
[1:29:27] what the world may mock at it the world
[1:29:30] may make light of it the world may say
[1:29:32] it's just nothing than all these other
[1:29:34] books that are written But I'm telling
[1:29:36] you, it's the word of God for this age
[1:29:38] that we need to make a
[1:29:41] rapture. And when it came and when she
[1:29:44] came to the man of God to the hill, she
[1:29:48] caught him by the feet. But Gahesi came
[1:29:51] near to thrust her away. And the man of
[1:29:53] God said, "Let her alone, for her soul
[1:29:55] is vexed within her, and the Lord have
[1:29:57] hid it from me and have not told me."
[1:30:04] M think about that. This is something
[1:30:07] supernatural happening with the
[1:30:09] Shudomite woman and God. And even the
[1:30:12] prophet didn't even know about it at
[1:30:14] this moment. I just think this is
[1:30:16] awesome. You can come to church and you
[1:30:19] can be closer and more in tune with God
[1:30:21] than anybody else in the church. That's
[1:30:23] the truth. That's, you know, it's all
[1:30:26] where you're at with God and what what
[1:30:28] what means to you. Amen.
[1:30:34] Then she said, "Did I desire a son from
[1:30:37] my
[1:30:38] lord? Did I not say do not deceive
[1:30:42] me?" And he said to Gahhesi, "Gird up
[1:30:46] thy loin, and take my staff in thy hand,
[1:30:50] and go thy way. If thou meet any man,
[1:30:53] salute him not. And if any salute thee,
[1:30:56] answer him not again, and lay my staff
[1:30:59] upon the face of the
[1:31:02] child. Oh my. And the mother of the
[1:31:06] child said, as the Lord liveth, and as
[1:31:09] thy soul liveth, I will not leave
[1:31:13] thee. And he rose and he followed her.
[1:31:17] Her faith was
[1:31:20] in what God showed her what needed to be
[1:31:23] done. And that was that prophet needed
[1:31:25] to be there.
[1:31:27] Nothing short of the prophet being
[1:31:30] there. And she's exercising a trust that
[1:31:35] even was beyond what Elisha was thinking
[1:31:39] was
[1:31:42] needed. How beautiful it is that we can
[1:31:45] sometimes the Lord I we've all
[1:31:48] experienced this. We've tried to share
[1:31:51] something with somebody else that God
[1:31:53] has spoken to us and showed us and
[1:31:55] nobody that we talk to understands it.
[1:31:57] Amen.
[1:32:00] But they're not meant to understand it.
[1:32:02] It's between you and God because God is
[1:32:06] trying to build a trust relationship in
[1:32:08] you.
[1:32:10] And it's if it's God, it's going to
[1:32:12] happen. If it's not God, then we we just
[1:32:14] we learn from it and we go
[1:32:18] on. And Gahesi passed on before them,
[1:32:21] and laid the staff upon the face of the
[1:32:23] child. And there was neither voice nor
[1:32:26] hearing. Wherefore he went again to meet
[1:32:29] him, and told him, saying, The child is
[1:32:32] not awakened. And when Elisha was come
[1:32:35] into the house, behold, the child was
[1:32:38] dead. And he laid upon and laid upon his
[1:32:40] bed. And he went in therefore and shut
[1:32:43] the door upon them twain, just those two
[1:32:46] alone, and prayed unto the Lord. And he
[1:32:50] went up and laid upon the child, and put
[1:32:52] his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes
[1:32:55] upon his eyes, and laid his hands upon
[1:32:57] his hands, and he stretched himself upon
[1:33:00] the child, and the flesh of the child
[1:33:03] waxed
[1:33:04] warm. And then he returned and walked
[1:33:08] into the house to and fro and went up
[1:33:11] and stretched himself upon him. And the
[1:33:14] child sneezed seven
[1:33:16] times. And the child opened his
[1:33:21] eyes. My what? I'm sure if there's
[1:33:24] seven, there's some types in there,
[1:33:26] right? Seven church ages. Oh yeah. Yeah.
[1:33:29] Bringing life to each church age. Amen.
[1:33:33] And he called Gahhesi and said, "Call
[1:33:36] the Shoamite." So he called her. And
[1:33:39] when she was come in unto him, he said,
[1:33:41] "Take up thy son." And then she went in
[1:33:45] and fell at his feet and bowed herself
[1:33:47] to the ground and took up her son and
[1:33:50] went out. What a beautiful, beautiful
[1:33:53] story of exercising trust. And this was,
[1:33:57] I mean, a very hard trial. But I would
[1:34:00] say with all of our small trials, I
[1:34:02] believe the Lord wants us to begin to
[1:34:05] exercise trust. Amen. Remember the story
[1:34:08] of non, he he he was told by the word of
[1:34:11] the Lord, this is what you need to do to
[1:34:14] to be made whole. And what he did is he
[1:34:18] leaned to his own understanding. Amen.
[1:34:21] And there was somebody that told him,
[1:34:22] stop your own understanding. Just do
[1:34:25] what the prophet told you to do and
[1:34:26] you'll straighten it'll straighten up
[1:34:28] your life. It'll straighten up your
[1:34:29] home. It'll straighten up the
[1:34:31] relationship. It'll straighten up the
[1:34:32] finance. Just do what the prophet said
[1:34:34] and stop leaning at your own
[1:34:35] understanding.
[1:34:38] And you know what he did? He listened
[1:34:40] and he trusted the word of God and God
[1:34:42] blessed his life. And I mean, there's
[1:34:45] many examples throughout the
[1:34:48] Bible that we can when we read the
[1:34:51] Bible, we can see that that the answer
[1:34:53] to every situation is trusting in the
[1:34:56] Lord. And if we could just leave here
[1:34:59] today with a determination that I'm
[1:35:01] going to try to exercise more trust and
[1:35:03] not wait to some big thing to where you
[1:35:06] know I I have to don't do that. Just do
[1:35:09] it on the small things and build that
[1:35:11] relationship with God that we can just
[1:35:13] become stronger Christians. Amen. Let's
[1:35:17] stand together. God bless you. Amen.
[1:35:21] look for opportunities to
[1:35:24] trust God
[1:35:28] more. It's almost like looking looking
[1:35:31] for
[1:35:33] opportunities not to not to lean your
[1:35:35] own understanding because usually those
[1:35:37] are difficult situations, right? When
[1:35:40] you know when you have you trying to
[1:35:41] figure it out. So may the may the
[1:35:46] Lord may the Lord just help us all.
[1:35:49] Let's look to him in a word of prayer
[1:35:50] before we sing a few songs. Our heavenly
[1:35:52] father, Lord, we thank you that you've
[1:35:57] put it within all of our abilities to
[1:36:00] trust
[1:36:01] you and you've given us literally power
[1:36:05] to not lean to our own understanding. We
[1:36:07] know the devil tempts us with uh
[1:36:11] reasoning and and and and all these
[1:36:15] different thoughts of our past and
[1:36:17] memories and all these uh affections and
[1:36:23] to try to get us
[1:36:25] to to lean there. And
[1:36:28] Lord, we're coming to you
[1:36:31] today to confess that we we do not
[1:36:35] understand. We're not made to
[1:36:37] understand, but you did you did give us
[1:36:41] the ability to believe, to trust
[1:36:44] you. And Lord, we're confessing today
[1:36:47] that Lord uh that we want to leave here,
[1:36:51] we are leaving here with a determination
[1:36:53] to exercise more trust in you in our in
[1:36:57] our personal lives. And Lord, that you
[1:37:00] would bless us with uh building
[1:37:04] ourselves up in that most holy faith
[1:37:07] that that day by day, week by week,
[1:37:10] month by month that we uh could grow uh
[1:37:14] in our trust for you. Bless every
[1:37:17] brother here, every sister here, those
[1:37:19] that are live streaming. Be with them.
[1:37:22] Help them, Lord, and give them of a a a
[1:37:27] greater uh power to know that they can
[1:37:32] trust you in every situation. Be with
[1:37:34] those that are watching the archives,
[1:37:36] Lord, down the road. And may this word
[1:37:39] find a dwelling place in all of our
[1:37:41] hearts, Lord, that we may be fit and
[1:37:44] ready for the rapture when that takes
[1:37:46] place. But you know your prophet said
[1:37:49] that our faith has to become a perfect
[1:37:51] faith.
