may you just touch their bodies and heal them may there just be something a word spoken to the heart that it' be directly from you to them that they could just receive it God we pray for those that

life to us bless your word may it come forth Lord with Revelation to every heart may we just grab the real importance of the message you have for us today Lord help us to just receive Lord from the scriptures that we would read what you would have us to have that we might be able to better uh know uh who it is that is speaking to us father we give you the praise for these things now we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen amen uh turn with me if you would to the book of First John chapter 4 we're going to read one verse of scripture there we want to uh talk about uh entitled this message considering your thoughts consider your thoughts and for a subject just yielding to the thoughts of God we know that the Bible tells us that there are many voices out there amen and there's many thoughts that come into our heart and sometimes we just don't know what's what and um we have h a scripture here to that the that gives us admir uh admonishing us to try the spirit in verse one it says beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits and whether they are of God because many false prophets are gone out into the world Amen God bless you you may be seated consider your thoughts believe not every Spirit now a lot of times when we think of spirits we think of uh maybe a spooky movie and there's this uh ghost in the house Ghostbusters or um you know we think of somebody acting really you know real off thewall to an extreme or you know we we something to an extreme and then we say oh there you know there's a spirit but there's like spirits that speak to our minds on a rapid basis constantly speaking to us and they got an agenda um that they want that obviously the devil's wanting to trip us up he's the author of confusion so he would like to Institute um a bunch of thoughts to get us off track okay we're on a race our race is to to um come into the image of Christ and we know the devil's job is to distract us look at the people that are in the world now that are not into Christ and all this stuff that has transpired about you know we're not good enough having two two a genders let's have 27 um it it's it's not good enough that um that a a normal couple would would better have all these rights now we got to have um all these other genders having the same rights and it's it's not um it's not good enough that uh you have to come into America legally and um be here for seven years and be a a a uh here for seven years to become uh an American now you you we want to pay you to come in we're going to fly you in we're going to put you in a m H we're going to give you cell phones and Blue Cross and and it just doesn't matter if the people here um uh don't even have enough that have been here amen and and we don't we don't we we can't even help the people of North Carolina but we got you know 350 million we can put uh other and so we see just out in the world there's so much confusion and chaos but the Devil's no respector persons and one thing he's really trying to Target is keeping the bride from coming into the image of Christ amen and so we get a lot of thoughts into our our mind and um and we just want to consider our thoughts today and just take a look at this topic the word consider means to think carefully about something typically before making a decision and Jesus uses the word consider in fact the word consider is used a number of times I think 66 times in the Bible and so um I believe it's something that we should consider more of is what we're actually thinking about we live in such a laxidasical hour that people often do not consider carefully what they're thinking about am our minds can sometimes be lazy and allow just about anything to come inside No Limits No Boundaries no rules and B basically no considerations whatever happens in there it just happens in there we sometimes can think negatively negatively negatively I'll get it about someone for a time and before we even realize it was wrong and the devil's very good at showing us something negative about somebody that it's true right he's he's not going to he's not going to put a thought in my mind about brother Ron that he's just he's a he's a bank robber because it's not true right but he'll put a thought in my mind about brother brother Bob that brother Bob didn't shake my hand because of that you know and then the negative thought comes amen but if we don't if we allow that thinking about um someone negatively inside of us too long uh what will happen is we might um we might even verbally say something to somebody about it because it stayed there but it was just a thought at the time but then it became strong and and and and if we don't say something verbally if it's still in there we might show it when we talk to Bob and and so it come out in our Behavior but it all starts with our thoughts we know that the love of God thinketh no evil so when we realize that we're thinking evil thoughts we should also recognize the devil who planted them there in our mind mind because it's not in our heart to think evil but the devil is there doing his job so we always want to consider our thoughts so for a moment I want us to take uh some time and just answer these questions here have you ever been so caught up in your thinking that you didn't realize what you were even thinking and you asked yourself why was I thinking that why did that come into my mind what made me think about that where where did that thought come from what was I thinking there am that's not in me to be like that I would never think like that I would never do something like that but it's bringing us easily to the conclusion that all the thoughts that we think are not from God and so therefore we need to consider our thoughts our the thoughts that we think about in our mind are not all right and that's a very very hard pill to swallow but the quicker we can swallow that pill the quicker we can get on top of it and take control of our mind have you ever thought it was okay to think about something as long as you didn't say it to anybody that's a big one right there it's okay for me to think about it but you know I I'm just as long as I don't tell anybody like maybe our minds are a safe haven or a place of Refuge from others like every thought that's protected in our mind and you felt totally it was totally fine thinking that as long as you didn't say something to somebody think about how dangerous our thoughts can be amen just in that and and we think that our mind is like uh it's like it's okay to bring in all these thoughts and it's not the message influence brother Brandon says God I'm a present knows what you're doing and even your thoughts one time while I was in a vision I was speaking to a being I believe it the angel of the Lord standing by me and he said back he said your thoughts are louder in heaven than your voice is on Earth he knows what you're thinking your thoughts speak louder in heaven but yet we don't want to share them sometimes with somebody the scriptures record that Jesus perceived the thoughts of people many times he knew he they weren't even speaking but he knew their thoughts so we want to remember that God knows what we're thinking Proverbs 23:7 says for as a man thanketh so is he now I do want us to understand I really appreciate do not worry about any kind of uh movement or anything like that today because there's not many in the back that you can't be distracted from and I just appreciate you being here and um so I just I just wanted to share how I felt about that so you're not you know getting any thoughts you know what I'm saying because we're talking about thoughts this morning mam said in the spoken word is the Original Seed he said our minds are the spiritual womb of our spirit right our minds are the spiritual womb of our spirit and we know that the womb is where a seed is taken in and whatever seed is taken in you're going to have it it just doesn't matter it's it's it's just whatever seed comes in that that's what's going to come for so it's important that we receive the right seed our mind conceives thoughts seed thoughts our mind receives these seed thoughts from one of two sources we know it's the either the tree of life or the tree of death and when we dwell and we think on these thoughts they actually grow plants so it's like well I can think about it for a while and I should be okay no you don't understand you planted a plant it's going to come out you planted a plant it's going to come out so these these plants become a part of what our garden is we all got a garden and where we're growing stuff it is vitally important to consider our thoughts because some of the plants that we're planning are are poison poisonous anything that the devil puts inside you it's going to poison you it's going to steal your joy it's going to steal you your happiness you're it's going to bring depression why are people full of anxiety and and so many things are happening because they have received the thoughts that are poisonous and they haven't kept their their mind stayed on the Lord amen he first Peter 5'8 says be sober that means watchful of our thoughts that's what it means or as the message says consider our thoughts so be sober be vigilant this is how we're supposed to consider our thoughts Vigilant means keep awake don't be lazy in your thinking be aware of what's going on in your mind at all times in other words you got to be able to identify I can identify there's nobody sitting in this row there's somebody sitting in that row I need to be a to identify what thoughts are in my mind either they're from God or they're not and not just well it's okay to think about everything that's that's what we're trying to get away from it's not okay to think about anything so be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring line he's walking around seeking whom he may devour now we don't see him physically like we see one another so he's walking around invisibly and he's coming to our mind that's where he devours us in our minds in a weak mind but if you got a strong mind strong in the Lord strong in faith Being Sober be vigilant I'm just not going to let any thought come into my mind and you're being strong that's where you're going to catch the devil but if you're like you're not you know I you don't want to reain re retain God in your mind you just want to not think about God you don't want to think about the scripture you just kind of want to do your own thing well then I will say to you that you're an easy target for the devil amen and that's what causes so much problem but the Bible says in verse n we have a job that when we recognize the devil speaking to us it says whom resist steadfast in the faith knowing that the same things that are happening to you are happening to your brethren that are all over the world they got to fight the same battle they got to resist the same devil Devil comes knocking on their mind you got to remember the devil has a lot of lures he's just trying to get you away from God get you to a place where he can just fill you with anything except God and the problem is he doesn't tell you you're going to get sick you're going to get depressed you're going to get angry you're going to get upset you're going to get away from God he doesn't tell you that stuff but he plants in front of you billboard signs and I remember as clear as day seen billboard signs that are just like a beautiful picture of of of Colorado and the white cap of snow mountains and just it just looked beautiful and they got a a guy there with just white glistening teeth just so beautiful looking and they're selling cigarettes selling a pack of cigarettes on that billboard but they got this great big look at this beautiful thing that I'm presenting to you but behind it was poison right they they don't they don't show hey this is evidence we got lung cancer over here and we got these teeth that are just like you know rotted out they don't show the reality that's what the devil don't do do when he comes and he puts thoughts in her mind I remember seeing one time a billboard this this it was a woman just dreed dressed in a a black uh velvet just just uh presented in a beautiful way and and they're selling um some I don't know Royal Crown Liquor or something you know this this presenting Beauty to destroy your liver amen and and the devil is not going to present to us the reality of why he's putting the thought in our head but he's he definitely has an endgame agenda to get you away from God Amen so the the answer is we need to resist or stand against and it says steadfast that means solid stable strong and no double-mindedness that's what that means so in order to be steadfast and to stand against the devil we have got to know who it is that we're talking to in other words we got to quickly try the spirit not just well I didn't know what I was thinking I didn't know it was him I I I didn't know you got to know yeah you got to know that's your job you've got to know what's going on in your mind this all happens in our mind brother BR preached the message the greatest battle ever [Music] fought we can even come to church here to hear the word but you know who else is here the devil amen and he he wants to he wants to take the word and beat you up God wants to take give you the word and set you free two two different motives but the same word James 4:7 submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil and he will flee how how do you do that you do it right here it's all happens in your head submit yourself therefore to the to the word to to the truth to the right thing to the things that you know to do submit to it and and then resist the devil and he'll leave but here this is the problem in leoa it's lukewarm and it doesn't matter what anybody thinks about there's it just doesn't matter there's no conviction there nothing bothers you you just think about whatever you want and everything's okay you're never wrong until you're till you're what Until you realize that something went wrong somewhere am most of the time we don't recognize where our thoughts come from the Devil deceptive our thoughts lead us to a destiny right our thoughts lead us to a destiny I I've watched a number of of uh things about people that are into um satanic worship and and serving the devil and they understand about an end agenda they know what they're doing when they're trying to get certain people in places and in the government and in the schools and they know what they're doing because they're after they're an end an end point and it doesn't always start out that way our thoughts lead us to a Desy it's so important to consider our thoughts now God's thoughts lead us to a destiny he said I know the thoughts that I think towards you sayith the Lord thoughts of Peace not of evil to give you you an expected end so his thoughts lead us to an expected end brother bam taught us that that we were in God's thoughts before there was anything and and then he spoke the word and and the word is just a a a a thought expressed and then it became the manifestation of it but it shows the importance of a thought Jesus talked about there being two Gates or we might say it like this two gates of thoughts one leads to destruction one leads to life and our thoughts have have led us down a wrong path many times how do we know that just think about all the times you said I'm sorry we've made many mistakes because why now they weren't all just oh I just didn't know no we knew many times but we didn't consider enough our thoughts so we need to consider our thoughts more amen there was a man from the 6th Century BC he was an extra extraordinary thinker his name was Leo teasu Tzu however you say that Brother Bruce you'd probably be about the best or Cheryl and he said watch your thoughts they become your words watch your words they become your actions watch your actions they become your habits watch your habits they become your character watch your character it becomes your destiny I am telling you your thought is the most important because it's going to lead to everything else that happens in your life if you're extremely happy about what's going on in your life stay with the thoughts that you're doing but if you're not happy with the things that are going on in your life you need to look at your thoughts it's all is it's nothing else our thoughts lead us to our destiny we are basically where we're at in life today because of decisions that we made in the past we're not in a different spot we we made decisions back there and that led us to hear you gave your heart to Jesus Christ if you wouldn't have done that you wouldn't be here amen and and so your thoughts are really important but see there's more there's more to Christ than just I gave I got salvation he has something in mind he has predestinated us to become In His Image and so his thoughts are leading us to come into His Image I know the thoughts I think towards you God's thoughts lead us in a specific Direction his word will not return void it will accomplish what it pleases him his thoughts of that he had by his for knowledge before we existed was to to predestinate us into a certain spot okay today you're here in church and you didn't go to any other church because you were if I could say it like this God knew 40 years ago that you would be here today at this building today it was pre-ordained he predestined at it in order for that to happen he had to put thoughts in your mind this morning the first one was hey are we still having church I hope church is cancelled I mean you had all these thoughts and okay I got I guess I got to go and then you work through all that and he places that thought in you we're having church today and we go that's how important the thought is today for the what what happened 40 years ago so it's no different with coming to the image of Jesus Christ we need to follow the thoughts that God gives us in order to reach our destiny we just can't say I'm bride I'm in the message I'm predestinated I'm G to make it it doesn't work like that that is a false sense of security if that's all we had to do why do we even come to church that's the end result but there's so many thoughts that we must conceive into our mind that will bring about the character of Jesus Christ in our life the scripture tells us let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus now our mind is not an encyclopedia it's not it's not the the mind is not just a book with words in it because uh let me just say this when you go to a funeral and there's somebody dead their mind is not there their body's there so when I'm talking about the mind of Christ I am not just talking about words in a book I'm talking about a Living spirit that operates these words so the mind of Christ is something that's real it's just is you either got it or you don't amen and this is what we need to pray for just let it be and it takes ready desire that's all really takes desire it's not a gift but you got to want the mind of Christ now we cannot have the mind of Christ at the same time of having a carnal mind in other words we can't be double-minded we can't be wishy-washy James 1: 18 says a double-minded or what that really means double-minded is two-spirited a two-spirited man is unstable or always changing in all his ways the mind of Christ is controlled by the spirit of Christ inside of a man it's a controlled atmosphere he's sober he's watchful he's watching his thoughts he's considering his thoughts he's Vigilant the mind of Christ is not laxidasical and lazy it doesn't say well I did my job I I read for five I read for a half hour I listened to a tape and now I'm on my own that is not the mind of Christ Amen Brother John i s I had to put that in there because there wasn't very many in the audience saying anything at this time so the scripture tells us 2 Timothy 1:7 For God has not given us the spirit of fear right amen that's the other Spirit right but of power and of love and of a sound mind notice that is all one spirit all one Spirit of a sound mind all love all power it is a spirit of God that's the spirit he's given us he has not given us the other spirit so the mind of Christ is a sound mind it's solid it's discipline that that word sound mind you look it up it means discipline and self-control you're controlling what's going on in there you're not letting things bounce around like you're playing a the game where the ball's going around all the your hitting these levers and the balls going around you know I'm arcade game that's not what happens in a sound mind it doesn't allow the devil to welcome his stay causing disorder and lawlessness in your mind and it just doesn't matter and as long as nobody knows and I don't say anything I should be okay that is not the spirit of Christ that is not a sound mind so the scripture this morning is beloved believe not every Spirit but try the spirits whether they are of God because many false prophets are gone out into the world Amen many spirits come to our minds we're instructed not to try a person we're it is not instructing us to try a person we are instructed to try the spirit and a lot of times I I don't have to worry too much about being deceived by somebody to be honest with you but I I I I have to think about those thoughts that come into my head right because that's where the most of the preaching is done by the devil is to my is right here right between these two ears he just gets on the pulpit and he just goes goes goes goes goes and as long as you allow him to stay there he will keep preaching it's our job to resist that steadfast keep our minds stay on the Lord amen Ephesians 6:12 says for we wrestle not against flesh and blood so we're not trying the person but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of Darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places now think about this we're dealing with spiritual wickedness in high places but we'll go through the course of the day and we won't even hardly recognize the devil speaking to us that's why this message is here consider your thoughts consider your thoughts 2 Corinthians 10:3 2 Corinthians 10:3 for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh so we're not trying the person we're not trying to we're not trying the person you know there's a lot of times that Believers true genuine children of God got wrong spirits on them so we're not trying the person we're trying the spirit for the weapons of our Warfare they're not carnal there's no no no drama we're not fighting against one another in the flesh we don't like well I'm going to you know what I'm going to outdo them because they did me and I'm going to get back to them and I'm not going to talk and they did this to me and I'm going to do the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal they didn't talk to me I'm not going to talk to them they didn't reach out to me I'm not going to reach out to them they acted this way toward you know turn the cheek walk the Second Mile be Christ right the the weapons of our Warfare they're not carnal but they're Mighty through God to the point down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bring it into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ I think about this if I took open this up and I let all the water out and I just went everywhere or right here just it would not be in captivity it would just be out here it's in captivity and sometimes we just allow thoughts to roam in our mind and think it's okay and we're told to bring it into captivity and then get rid of it just get rid of it don't sit there and let it stay there and think about it and and that's what gets us in trouble that's why homes are breaking up and relationships with God are breaking up because people are allowing the Devil to come in and Destroy them amen we got to cast down the imaginations cast down every High thing that exalteth itself against the word of God and bring it into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ amen Christ wants me to throw that away Satan says I want you to think about it just want you to just you know keep thinking about doing your own thing and having this is this is about Being Sober now being vigilant and having a Readiness you're ready you're ready I mean I look at brother James he's ready to have church he's got his suit on he's got his tie on he's ready to go he is he did not get dressed to go to the Ball Game to the park right he's ready he's having in a Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience how do I do that when your obedience is fulfilled so there's something that God is wanting us to do when when I think about this think about this for a second okay so God comes and he places a thought in our heart I want you to pray for sister Lynn right now we take that thought and we say we we just go and we pray for sister ly right there and we fulfilled that's we we obeyed God but now a thought comes from the the devil and says you know um even though there's a lot of needs and you got a busy day today um you know Ju Just go God understands you don't need to pray now you have to bring that thought under subjection just like you did the other one amen it's it's not just doing what God Said but it's being able to resist the devil when he comes into your mind and tries to get you off track there's an obedience to both Spirits now you try the spirit and there's obedience you have to do something to each Spirit you have to you cannot just you can't off thoughts that come in your mind everything's neutral we are to try the spirit good and evil Holy Ghost anti-sp spirit Spirit of Truth Spirit of a Angels demons we're to figure out what's what I think it's a good practice just take out time and just go just try going 10 minutes and name off where which one is talking to you it's a good practice because the devil wants you to think that only God is speaking to you he never you never hear the devil come to you and say I am the devil and I'm going to torment you I'm going to I'm going to give you a lot of negative thoughts today I'm going to deceive you today I'm going to make you feel so bad you're going to be so depressed by the time the day is over the devil doesn't do that but how many times at the end of the day do we feel it that so the devil does it without us knowing and that's why we we're made aware and alert to put this into practice to take time and consider the thoughts that we're thinking now these thoughts always come to us in a in a way of reality a way of reality in other words they look so real they look like they're from God but we're told to try the spirit so how how do we try the spirit we have to put it on trial now we've heard we've heard this we've heard the the word innocent till proven guilty right well most people do not put their thoughts on trial in other words the only way that some people's thoughts ever get tried is if somebody else tries them but you know what that means that means if that's happening that means the person who's thinking doesn't really care and we've got to be willing to put our thoughts on trial because every man's thoughts are right in his own eyes we've got to be the one to humble oursel and say I could be wrong brother Brandon said we need to apply this instruction that God has given us to try the spirit just get up there and be a judge amen don't don't judge me I won't judge you but judge yourself somebody's got to judge you you got to judge yourself and if you do that I am telling you you're going to bring those spirits and kick them out you know brother B said like this he says the devil can't do one thing unless he's got a vessel to work through and can you imag imagine if you had such control such a sound mind that the devil never used you there would be no bad things happening in the world because he wouldn't have any vessels to work through how many times have you heard of somebody I won't mention any names but we all heard names and the first thing we think is oh they're a bad person right maybe in the in the government or in the world or some things that they did oh they're a bad person we just need to learn to put our thoughts on trial amen when we put a spirit on trial I'm just going to give you what the uh Hebrew is saying here or the Greek I'm sorry we examine the spirit when we try we put a spirit on trial okay we're we're going to talk about this thing right now we're just we're going to talk about this thought that just came into my mind know we got to learn to we should at the beginning if we don't do this it's going to take time to learn how to do this but then after a while you can like speed it up because thoughts are quick amen so we examine the spirit we discern the spirit we prove the spirit we test the spirit we try the spirit whether it's of God or not sometimes it's going to be of God but most of the time it's not let me just say that again so we get that sometimes it's going to be of God but the majority of the time it's not going to be now if you're used to doing this all the time then you're going to you you've already put into practice these Gates where the devil can't come in and so it's not going to be as bad but if you're not trying to do this you're going to see that the majority of the thoughts that that are happening is is of the devil because he has had an open door for so long just have just let anything go into your mind and you just let it go and before you know it nothing matters what you think about now this is so off the word I don't care how predestinated we are I don't care how much we're a seed of God if we do not put this into practice we will never come into the image of Christ this needs to be done in order for us to come into the image of Christ because Christ thoughts will come and you will reject those and you will keep the thoughts that the devil gives you because they're pleasing to the Flesh and you can't be double minded amen so the if the Devil comes and he's bothering you about you just feel bothered bothered bothered bothered bothered and you just don't know what do I do well there's a scripture in the Bible it says finally Brethren whatsoever things are true amen whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just and whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are good report if there's any virtue any any strength any power if there's any praise if there's any glory to give to God about what you're thinking about then go ahead and think on it but if there isn't then get rid of the thing get rid of the thought you know I I I how many's ever wanted to do something okay how about this how many's ever wanted to convince your spouse about something lot praise the Lord I love it honesty here and and you tried and you weren't able to do it that's a lot too right you tried but you weren't allowed to do it so what did you do you came from another angle you tried it this way and then you tried it that way and you finally said look if you don't I'm not going to talk to you you you the devil will try so many ways to get us off to get us down to get us discouraged to get us bothered about something but I'm telling you whatever way he tries if it if it crosses this if it's bringing you down stop thinking about because God has the ability to communicate to you another way where you don't feel like it if it's him amen the instructions for us are to try every Spirit clearly indicates to us that we can be deceived by the devil that's what that's telling me if I don't I can be deceived thinking on things for a while that do not bring strength and power and virtue and make me feel like moving forward with Christ I say come the thing off just cut it off it takes work to try a spirit it takes work it don't take any work to be lazy and just think about anything no work it's like sitting in front of a television watching a movie you know your brain you don't you don't have to think about anything you ever get those shows you're watching and they got five things going on at one time and it's making you think and you like getting irritated because it's not entertaining you you want to turn it off you know what I'm talking about you want to watch something that you can just sit there and not have to figure it out and that's kind of how we are with our mind thinking thoughts so it takes work to actually try a spirit it takes I'm going to say the work of humility that you that you have to do it it takes dedication soberness and wanting to only think the thoughts that come from Heaven to have that desire God I only want to think your thoughts so we need wisdom from above we need the the fear of the Lord the beginning of wisdom to walk in this direction Philippians 2:12 wherefore my beloved Brethren as ye have always obeyed not in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling so we have to work out this trying this spirit with fear and trembling I could be wrong I shouldn't be thinking this have you ever just like been thinking about something look at something saying something and you realize oh I shouldn't do that okay that's it right there fear and trembling oh I shouldn't do that that's what we need more of we need to work out what's going on in our mind with fear and trembling for it is God which works in you yes both to Will and to do of his good pleasure not the Devils so when you hear from God do all things without murmuring and disputing you ever been asked to do something you know it was the will of the Lord and you just murmured about it look and then the Devil comes and he puts thoughts in our head and we just jump up and down about the excitement of it that we need the fear and trembling we need to make this so real I know this is not maybe a favorable message to make us excited but this is a message that will get us down the road where we got to go it will get us down the road all right we need to consider our thoughts I've quoted this in years past I don't know how long it's been but William Janes said the greatest discovery of my generation and I'll say any generation is that a human being can alter his life by altering his attitude now an attitude is the way you think you ever been you ever been out to lunch with somebody and you're just you know you want to get some hambur and you're going to get some fries and you just you know you just want to enjoy some greasy chicken or something and you're sitting with a person and says I'm I'm not doing that I'm on a diet I I can only eat this I can only eat these salad with nothing in it and and and their their mind is about taking care of their body where my mind is just about enjoying having a good lunch amen so you can take your mind and if you put it on the things of God you can change your life if you'll start taking control of your thoughts pretty soon they won't get you in trouble changing the way a person thinks and perceives a situation their attitude they can significantly impact and improve I'm just reading what the internet said here they can significantly impact and improve the course of their life suggesting that a positive mindset can lead to a positive outcome and change in one's circumstances to think about that you can make a difference in your situation you know brother B talked about when he came home one time and he'd been in uh going out preaching he came home and he he hadn't been home in a while and the the the the kids were just all going around and running and and and and she was like all uh uh in her mind just kind of like tore up of all the work that she had to do while um her husband was out and and um and and so she was washing dishes and and he came into the situation and with the love of God helped her amen changed the whole situation amen now he was wasn't wrong he wasn't wrong in going out and preaching he wasn't he wasn't the one that caused his wife to be like this or his children to act like this but he found a way to help and that's what a good attitude would do it will alter a situation it takes God to change things permanently amen but we can let God use us to help a a situation brother B said that if he if we would take the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God that it would bring it to pass just taking a right attitude towards it in other words not okay so we're say I I believe that I believe I'm going to be delivered I believe I'm going to be healed I believe I'm going to grow in wisdom I believe I'm going to be filled with the love of God I'm I'm gonna have get the Holy Ghost you take any of these promises and you think on them and believe them and trust God and testify and just thank God every day and worship him for an end result it's going to happen but if you take the mindset and say yeah I believe it's going to happen I don't know it's just I don't I I don't I just yeah it's gonna happen I just things are I'm busy right now I I'm even thinking about you know going to church how in the world is God going to to bring anything to pass so we need to use our mind for God and only for God keep our minds stayed on the Lord if we want to grow if we really want to have the image of Christ we've got to we've got to take the land we can't we can't just go over the go over that and work over here and then when we're done you know we're just going to go do this over here and our promised land is the image of Jesus Christ me myself becoming like Christ that is the promised land amen and I don't know what your promised land is some people's promised land is hey I'm already there you know what I'm saved that's all I care about they're not even they're not even caring about being in the image of Christ they have no vision and we need that Vision God's thoughts lead us to our destiny and we cannot make it to heaven without the mind of Christ do you know that amen Jesus Saidi am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me so we need the mind of Christ to actually get to the father we can't make it into a Rapture without the thoughts of God we can't make it into the image of Christ without the mind of Christ we must receive the thoughts of God into our mind in order to become manifested in our life we can't just say oh somehow it's going to happen by me you know by the turning the count cend in New Year but me going to church me listening to tapes you know somehow it's just going to happen it don't work like that you listen to all the tapes you want so when God gives you a thought in your mind just go do it because it is leading you to where you need to go if all I had to do was listen to tapes read the Bible spend a few uh H H time in in prayer on my knees every day if that's all I had to do to be a Christian wow and then the rest of my life the rest of my mind the rest of my desires I could do what I want to do wow that would be easy easy wouldn't it just do your your your Works that'd be like saying going into the barn makes you a horse or chickens or goats what you got in there coming doing those things don't make us a Christian we do those things that we can become more like Christ Jesus said my my words they are spirit and they are life my words but remember the word was just his thought so when we're reading the Bible we're really reading the thought of God it's like you want to read God's mind read the Bible That's the mind of God that's his thoughts they're expressed on a piece of paper and brother taught us that the thoughts of God don't change he can't make a better decision all of us make better decisions how many times you walked away say I shouldn't have done that I know what to do next time I've got so many things I can point my life and I had to redo didn't work out the first time God don't have to redo anything and so we need the thoughts of God to help our life to become more stable amen 1 John chapter 1 not first John but St John chapter one in the beginning time is slipping away in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God Amen brother bam talked about that God was sitting with all his thoughts alone the same was in the beginning with God in verse 14 the word was made flesh the word was made flesh the word needs to be made flesh in US yes it just has to in order for that to happen happen it's not us at certain times coming to the altar banging on the Altar and said I want I want the Holy Ghost I want to be like you God and then then the rest of the time you're just doing what you want to do in order for the word to become flesh inside of you you've got to keep your mind State on it Jesus the Bible says that you shall seek me and find me when you search for me with all your heart amen and so there's this desire that God has ask it shall be given seek and you shall find knock and the door shall be open he has this this desire that we keep seeking after to become In His Image don't lose that Vision don't get caught up in the world don't get caught up and just be in a worldly Church well I go to her I'm in the message I'm I'm G I'm saved don't do that check those thoughts consider your thoughts brother Bram send the message just once more Lord he says and the only only thing you have to do to know that he God is here is to get yourself out of the way see as long as you're in your way then God cannot do anything for you when you think your thoughts then God's thoughts don't have a chance but if you'll quit thinking your thoughts and think his thoughts my thoughts is not your thoughts right I'll read that scripture in just a second but I just want to say this look you can't have the mindset all I got to do is read and pray spend some time doing this and I'm set to go to do whatever I want the rest of the day you cannot do that this you've got to get rid of your thinking on a regular basis if you want your life to change you like you have to allow God thoughts to be preeminent in your mind right amen our whole goal is to become more like Christ to make things better to build and we can't do that when we just give God a partial of our you know uh 10% of our day I tell you most people don't even get 10% have you ever and I'm guilty of this I repented of this this week one day our our our propane went out and our furnaces went out and the guys got showed up real early and I got up and I just I was praying as I walked and started helping I look back and I don't remember going back and spending time with God about that situation so I little repented that I did not take time to pray like I should have so I I just can't give God a little bit of time than go do what I want to do that's not what this message is this message is considering our thoughts all day long consider your thoughts amen all right read the scripture Isaiah 556 says seek ye the Lord while he may be found call upon him call ye upon him while he is near let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts am and let him return unto the Lord and He will have mercy upon him and to our God and he will abundantly pardon for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways sayith the Lord for as the heaven is higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts that's what brother Bri saying you've got to get yours out of the way if you as long as they're there God can't move so if all we're going to do is try to get our thoughts out of the way for a half hour while we spend some time with God and then we're going to go on our day we really did not fulfill the scripture what we did is we did some sort of work to try to Institute God in and that's all we gave him but we never put into practice what we did in that half hour we got to get off of that half hour and and meditate upon it and desire it and say God I'm hungry for it don't get mad at me Romans 8:28 and we know that all things were together for the good to them that love God who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed into the image of his son that we might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called them he called he them he also Justified and to whom he justified them he also glorified so you see there's a process here I want to talk about this process Paul is referring to a certain group group of Believers here it's not referring to everybody right a foreordained predestinated group that is is now being conformed into the image of Christ it's happening right now amen it's not going to happen amen it didn't happen is it's happening it's present tense now even though we've been predestinated there is a process that we must all go through we can't just make it in because we're predestined we can't make it in just because we believe that we're bride we must receive the higher thoughts of God when they come to us and brother Brandon's made it real clear we come to church find out where we're at with God so the the preaching is coming forth we get a thought we know where we're at with God it's no longer well I don't know that just that just kind of seems that uh you know no we need to humble oursel and realize that God is speaking they are directed God's thoughts are directed personally to us in other words right now I can say this that that brother Ron is not thinking the same thing that sister an is thinking or sister lur is not thinking the same thoughts that Brother Bruce is thinking because God has a personal thought for you for your life because he's tailoring he cares about you it would be confusing for for uh sister Donna's thought to be given to brother Roger it'd be confusing God is not the author confusion he wants to be real clear the thought that you feel inside is the thought that he's given you right and that's why the scripture says he that have an ear let him hear what the spirit is saying to the churches God's thoughts are being spoken yes the word is being preached we're hearing the gospel but it's something more personal God is sending us a message that we're going to take home and we're begin to apply in our lives and it's going to make a difference in the message the token brother Bram said if the Life of Christ lives in the person they become identified with him if the Life of Christ if the life of Jesus Christ lives in the person they become identified with him that's pretty powerful it is Christ in you not a church member not a system but it's the resurrected power it's the Holy Ghost is a token upon you that your life says Amen to the scripture the promise is written in there and you are not yourself no more now I want you to catch this you are not yourself no more you're Christ you don't think your thoughts you don't think your thoughts you say I think brother B says you have no thought coming the life that was in Christ is in you the mind that was in Christ was in you the works that was in Christ is in you and Christ himself is in you you're dead your life is hidden in God through Christ sealed with the Holy Ghost you're not your own so brother briam is really sending a strong message here that you don't think your thoughts anymore that you're walking by the the faith of the son of man the thoughts of God so in order for that to happen we we got to consider our thoughts in order for us to come into the image of Christ we must receive the thoughts of God as he gives them because those thoughts are leading us to the next step to the next step to the next step I'll tell you I do not know there there was a time that I did not know how to build a building there was a time that I didn't know how to put cabinets together there was times that I didn't know anything but through a process of learning I knew how to do it and I do not know this way to get into the image of Christ I need God's word in a living form speaking to me by a thought and to walk in that and when I walk towards that your life changes your life changes your life changes you know what happens things get better right things get better you get you get rewarded praise God God cares about us amen so what do we need to do James 1:2 uh not 1 12 James 1 121 that's 21 James 1:21 wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of nuttiness and receive with meekness the engrafted word which is able to save your souls so the word comes to us as a thought let me just say that the word is being preached but it's coming to you as a thought it doesn't become a word inside of you until you receive it and you confess it and say it is mine I believe it amen this is for me then it becomes the word of God in you until then it's a thought and you have to consider that thought is this of God is it not how many times have we heard the old saying don't come to church with a pitchfork right here's here's a word for somebody else which is you know we thank God when we come to church there's a word for all of us but but in reality you know we need the word that's for us because we can't make it okay be ye doers of the word and not hearers only what happens when you do that you deceive yourself doesn't matter what you think for if you be a hearer of the word not a doer you're liken unto a man beholding his face in a glass he beh himself a while go away and straight way he forget what he looks like he ever just like did something really stupid dumb acted a bad way and then you just kind of like quickly forgot about it hours later doing it again hours later doing it again and so what we need to do is we need to allow the Holy Ghost into our mind the mind of Christ and take control it's it's one thing to be making mistakes it's another thing to not care and that's the that's the problem that our happening in our minds it's not happening it's happening in our minds and the devil trips us up and we just need to get the mind of Christ brother Ram said in the message sure we would see Jesus he said seven times around the world I have been at all different races kinds of people of tens of thousands I have seen great things that our Lord has did but I always notice that it takes people that will humble themselves and lay aside their own thoughts of it and just take God's thought of it and work according to his plan which is Faith in what he said so we need to receive the higher thoughts of God meditate upon day and night don't say I already know that I've already been told that I already know so does the devil but meditate upon it consider your thoughts upon on them I'm not going to be able to get everything but at at least want to read Psalms 1 veres 1-6 blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor sth in the seed of the scornful don't be hanging out with the wrong people amen don't be hanging out with the wrong thoughts in your head but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in his his law doth he meditate not just for a few minutes in the morning or a few minutes at night but he meditates day and night and he shall be something different than most other plants he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season and his Leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he do it shall prosper in other words it doesn't wither You Can Count would you ever seen those those we got a greenhouse now and before we had the greenhouse there were certain plants that they just died at the end of the year right because winter came and you but now you got a greenhouse you can just keep the thing going we're having tomatoes in the winter and when you see somebody whose Leaf is just always always there always giving life it's something you can count on it's stable it's solid and that's what the mind of Christ is it's it's presenting life to all that's around and can handle all that's around the ungodly are not so but are like the chaff of the wind driven away therefore the ungodly shall not stand in judgment nor the sinners in the congregation of the righteous for the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous but the way of the ungodly Shall Perish amen God bless you let's Stand Together We Must abideen In God's process for the elect the chosen the called out the predestinated group to come into the image of Christ we must abide in the process to get there we can't say I have I have already received everything I need remember Paul said I haven't attained yet there's still more for me there's still there's got to be more thoughts of God that I got to receive more word that I got to receive I got to press in towards more of Christ so let's start with just considering our thoughts first are they of God and and capture the thoughts of God because they will lead us to where God is taking us to amen amen let's just bow our hearts in a word of prayer our heavenly father Lord we thank you for your precious word today Lord we thank you for for instructing us to try every Spirit something perhaps we haven't been uh actively working on the way that we uh ought to but we do know Lord that youve you've pointed us in a direction that will help our lives that will help our our homes and and help uh relationships and father we just pray most of all of our relationship with you that we could become into your image more hear our heart see our heart and our desire Lord to weed out all the other things that have actually distracting us from coming into your image Lord coming into your likeness and Lord there's perhaps maybe uh people Lord that we know that are our churchgoers or they people Lord that we love but Lord you know only they may not have a heart to want it to pursue becoming into the image that you are and coming into uh being your bride and and being not just conformed but having that desire to be at that same place in your image that you had when there at the beginning when you said let us make man in our own image to know that's still your desire to have that kind of fellowship with a man Lord I pray that you'd help us not to uh um uh look to to uh uh and get distracted uh or caught up Lord by by others who perhaps won't want to pay the same price Lord but you would help us to focus on our our relationship with you and Lord is it it's the song We Sing Lord though none go with me still I'll fall follow Lord help us with all of our heart to take this message today and consider our thoughts Lord direct us in the path of life we pray we thank you for these things ask your blessings Lord upon each one uh watching in listening in here this morning Lord may you grant to them a a prosperous life uh further on we we thank thee for these things
