the service Lord move your unworthy servant out the way Lord just use me how you'd see fit Lord may they hear your voice and not mine oh fathers have your way in Jesus Christ and we pray amen amen if you have your Bibles will turn to Mark chapter 10. verse 17 and read through to 25 and I'll have you seated after that when you get to your we get the place in the Bible please say Amen and you beat me to it amen so Mark 17 or Mark sorry Mark 10 17. get myself mixed up and we'll start very familiar uh scripture we all have read it many times amen and when he was gone forth into the way there came one running and kneel to him and asked him good master so we could say it's individual was uh he had he had a desperation for something in his heart because he was running and came to Jesus and asked him good Master what shall I do that I may in inherit internal life so this individual was looking for how he could inherit eternal life and we're going to see what Jesus says next and Jesus said unto him why call us thou me good there is none good but one that is God verse 19. thou knows the Commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness defraud not honor thy father and thy mother look what the Rich Young Ruler says and the answer is saying to him master all these things have I observed from my youth up so this man was in a a ill-famed person he wasn't a thief he wasn't a robber but he was a man who had good morals good integrity and he had uh something in his heart that he knew he was missing he was lacking and that's why he came to Jesus and we're going to see what Jesus says to that and then Jesus beholding him loved him Jesus loved this individual and he knew that this individual will lack something in his life and he wanted to help him any way that he could that's why he the fountain was open for him to drink but we're going to see if he was willing to drink from that fountain then Jesus beholded him loved him and said unto him one thing thou lack us he didn't say you like this that and that but he said one thing just one thing go thy way sell whatsoever thou Hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven so he had an opportunity to invest and a Heavenly treasure and he says and come take up the cross and follow me so notice this individual this individual in order to follow Jesus he had to give up one thing and then he could come and take up his cross and then follow him and he was sad at this saying and went away grieved for he had great possessions notice that and Jesus looked around about and saith on his disciples how hardly shall they that have riches enter to the kingdom of God now Jesus isn't saying that you know we can't have wealth but he's going to get a little deeper into it because there's Christians who have wealth but if you look at this individual his riches was his God it was something and there's something in his life that he couldn't let go of and that's why Jesus asked him to let go of it because it was something that would hinder his walk I won't leave you standing too much and the disciples were astonished at his words be uh but Jesus answers again and said unto him children how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God you may be seated now I want to I'll search that eye of a needle because a lot of times we think it's like a needle but if somebody a sister man if you could post up the picture what Jesus was talking about because it's not some needle but literally back in the old days a camel had to go through this small little passageway and if they had all these things on them they would have to take everything off and I looked it in the spirit had to take all the baggage off to be able to get in and so that Camel in order to get in he has to take all this baggage off to be able to get into that small eye of the needle so when it's talking about an eye of a needle it's talking about a small passageway that a camel had to get through and this quote will read see what a curse money enriches is no wonder why Jesus said scarcely a rich man can enter into the Gates of Heaven like the camel going through the eye of a needle has to unload his burdens and get on his knees and crawl under now take that in the spiritual so we we have to let go of the baggage that is weighing us that's why the Lord asks us to take away certain things and add certain things in our life for a reason because he knows those burdens and those baggages are going to stop us from serving him the way he wants us to serve him and he can get there but he has to unload first so we gotta unload first and I know I didn't get the title The Sermon but the title of the sermon is Investments and so we make investments every day whether it's stocks markets whether it's uh your time whether it's working out eating healthy all these things are considered investments in our lives but we want to look at spiritual Investments because it's good to do stocks yes it's good to do all those things but the best investment we can make is our in our internal destination this might be the last opportunity we have tonight to invest in our internal destination so we don't want to squander the opportunity to invest while we have the chance right now because tomorrow is never promised no matter how healthy you are no matter how much money you have in your bank account no matter how big your house is death can come knock at anybody's door at any time that's when you want to make sure that your heart is always right with Jesus Christ no matter the circumstances don't make excuses but while now is now make the choice so I looked up the word grieve because it says this young man was grieved so it pained and Afflicted him he suffered because he had to give up something that was so dear to him but he knew that there was something different about Jesus he knew it he saw it otherwise he wouldn't come running and say what must I do and then he was expecting something simple that he would just have to do this and he'll just enter in but the thing was it was simple but he wasn't willing to let go of his will and give God control of the steering wheel he wasn't he was willing to invest in his own riches in his own kingdom but he wasn't willing to invest in his Heavenly riches and Jesus loved this individual in fact I believe it hurt Jesus that he rejected him he came to his own they received him not he was one of those only that received him not so then Jesus turned and said how hard it would be for a rich man to enter in the Kingdom of Heaven like a camel to go through an eye of a needle but that would be impossible with man but he said with God it is not possible so I want I want you guys to think that I don't you can't have nice things and you can't have wealth I'm not saying any of those things but if that wealth gets in the way of your your heavenly vision your walk with God then there's a problem with it because Abraham was wealthy Solomon didn't even ask for wealth and God blessed me you know what Solomon asked for how to help God's people and God blessed him with that money see these kind of riches people are looking for more they can't get one million they want two million they can get three million one four million and that's why this individual this richer ruler had to let go of these things in his life so let's follow this Young Ruler the next time we find him in the Bible he as soon as he rejected the opportunity to follow Jesus he was laid down to him pretty stiff so we see him later in the Bible looking up his eyes in Hades and he saw um Lazarus and he said can I get a drink of water and he said there's a gas there's a gap between us I can't and he said Kiko tell my brothers you know about this and he said if they don't hear the prophets and all the Commandments right then they won't hear a dead man coming from coming alive and so it's so important like you said we have to invest every day we have an opportunity to invest in the kingdom of God and the greatest thing we can invest is our time it's the greatest thing ever because that's how that's how growth happened is time if I'm in the gym you got to put a little time in the gym for in healthy time so everything we do in this life involves time fixing your car time Home Improvements time building a business time everything is surrounded by time I don't know if we remember the the first sermon that we ministered was was the world's greatest currency time it's something you can't get back it's something if you waste it for the day you can't get it back from yesterday it's something that we have to be investing in so you see we want to hold on to everything that we can see human beings our nature is to hold on to everything that we can and then we try to follow Jesus but Jesus even said in the word pick you got to deny yourself first crucify the flesh then you can follow me so we got to let go of our own will in order to follow Jesus Christ with our whole heart not just part but the whole heart it's what Jesus is looking for it says but sometimes Jesus wants to us to turn loose of everything so we can get both hands on him we can't have one hand here and one hand holding under this Jesus said you can't serve God in men at the same time it's impossible you can't because you'll love the one more than the other so if you notice when Jesus encounters individual he didn't Pat him on the back say oh you're a good man you're following these Commandments I'm so proud you come follow me but he gave him another commandment notice that he gave him another commandment and he choose not to follow that commandment which is called what iniquity Disobedience and so when God is asking us to do something no matter how bad it hurts in fact I think we can say when something hurts like that we know it's the Lord because if it hurts your flesh then you know that you're going down a straight and narrow if it's easy and relaxing then there's got to be a question I think we've got to have a question involved so let's go to Matthew 19. and we'll reverses 16 through 24 is the same story um we just read but so it says Matthews Matthew 19 16. I'll read it on the board and behold one came and said unto him good Master what good thing shall I do see man is always looking for one thing to do to get internal life we're looking for the Easy Street and this young man I believe thought what Jesus is going to say is going to be something easy well I'm following the Commandments sorry he's going to say something a little easy that I can follow that I may have eternal life verse 17 please and he said unto him why call us doubt me good there is none good but one that is God but if thou will enter into life keep the Commandments and that one Commandment that he said to him he could enter into life right then and there but he he chose not to enter into life he chose to keep following these Commandments I guarantee I bet you that he kept following these Commandments kept living a holy moral life and you can do that but the Muslims do that see you gotta have see it's not about living a good life but it's about having a a life behind the good life that makes sense so you got to have a good life Behind The Good Life something that's in here that is going to manifest out there because anybody can live a good life anybody cannot drink or smoke or gamble there's people who don't even serve God who don't drink gamble or smoke that doesn't make him any closer to God than uh that other person over there so look at verse 18. and he said unto him which Jesus said thou shall do no murder thou should not commit adultery thou shall not steal thou shall not bear false witness verse 19 please honor thy father thy mother and thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself I'll go to verse 20. the young man saying to him all these things have I kept from my youth up what lack I yet he's probably all proud oh wow man I do all these things already I'm I'm getting pretty close to eternal life now go to verse 21. Jesus said to him if thou will be perfect knows that if thou will be perfect to enter into Perfection now I know a statement when Jesus said be be perfect as my Father in Heaven is perfect I believe Perfection is recognizing that you're not perfect but you're always striving to be closer with God because technically I mean if we look at it in a logical standpoint we can't be perfect the way we think what perfect is but Jesus is calling us to be like him so each time we walk in the light he's revealing to us we're walking I believe in Perfection he says go and sell all that thou has because he says if thou will be perfect go and sell that thou has and give to the poor and thou shall have treasure in heaven and come and follow me verse 22. but when a young man heard that saying he went away sorrowful for he had great possessions verse 23 then set Jesus unto his disciples verily I say unto you that a rich man shall hardly enter into the Kingdom of Heaven verse 24 and again I say into it it's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter to the kingdom of God so now we have that picture of the camel going through instead of a little needle so we see that we got to release all the baggage that we're trying to carry in because you can't you can't uh save your life and you can't try to save your life and live you got to lose your life in order to live so you got to lose all that stuff first and go in to be able to enter in to life and then go to verse 23 I believe 25. let me get there myself so go verse 25 and it says amen when his disciples heard it they were exceedingly amazed saying who then can be saved and notice what Jesus said but Jesus beheld them and said to them with men this is impossible With God all things are possible so the more that we surrender the more that the possible is going to happen what we think is impossible God can make possible because that's the kind of God that we serve we don't serve a God who wants to make everything hard but God has hidden simplicity see this Bible isn't a bunch of do's and don'ts see it should become love to you you should you should do these things that the Bible is telling us because you love God not because brother Mark said something or or brother Ron says something but because you love God and your relationship is so important that you want to invest in that see a lot of people invest all their money into one stock and then they lose everything but I promise if you invest everything into Christ you will gain everything even in this world to come you'll gain so amen so and then if we keep going verse 27 then answer Peter and said to him behold we have forsaken all and then follow thee what shall we have therefore so we look at Abraham he had to forsake all to get Christ he left all that he knew all his family all his friends that a voice you never heard before and he followed it and gave everything to the cause and God blessed him richly he was the father of all nations in fact he's the father of our faith and if Abraham could do that without having one Scroll of Bible without having a whole group of brothers and sisters then what excuse do we have I think a lot of times we invest our time in making excuses and excuses will do you no good excuses will get you so far down the tube you won't even recognize it so let's not invest our time and excuses because God doesn't want to hear excuses I don't even want to hear my own excuses even though they sound good I can make them I can make them sound really good and I can change them up I can I can fool myself by keep making oh I can't do this because of this that and that now I got to do this and that and that and that and then you finally get so busy and then God becomes on the back burner so let's kick when an excuse comes let's kick it out because we a lot of times people use this I don't have time for this I don't have time for that and instead of saying that say this you don't want to make time that that's the that's the real thing what you're saying say what you really mean don't sugarcoat it because we have time we just have to our priorities have to be set our priorities have to be right your number one priority has to be God I promise if you put God first he'll open up more time for you in your life just put in first seek his kingdom first that's all he's asking his Commandments aren't Grievous amen and this Rich Young Ruler actually let me finish this and Jesus said to him verily I say unto you that ye which have followed me in the Regeneration God is trying to restore us when the son of man shall sit in the Throne of his glory you shall sit down upon the twelve Thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel and everyone that hath forsaken houses or brothers or sisters or fathers or mothers or wife or children or lands of my name a hundredfold shall inherit everlasting life but many that are first shall be last and that last shall be first so Jesus is this is a promise if you forsake all these things he's going to bless you a hundredfold for doing it he's gonna it's a promise don't do it begrudgingly do it because you love him because nothing is worth holding on to this life that's gonna you miss eternal life I don't care if it's the hottest latest Bitcoin stock I don't care if it's ethereum stock all those things are going to crash one day you could have all your you can have millions of dollars to crash just like that Elon Musk can crash just like that no matter how big you think you are if you're Bill Gates it doesn't matter because eventually you can't take those things with you the Egyptians showed us that you can't take it with you what the Egyptians happened they got grave robbed I remember Denzel Washington said this one quote he said you'll never see a U-Haul behind a hearse so when you die you can't take any of these Earthly possessions with you I don't care how what you I don't care if you got a collection of guitars of saxophones or the sign records by every artist from the 80s it doesn't matter these things are going to pass away ruler as we call in the Bible he passed up a great opportunity he had the opportunity to put his riches of this world into a guaranteed plan but he failed it he didn't do it he was given the opportunity that he could draw interests on it it's a prophet speaking and make a great investment notice that but he failed to accept that opportunity so much as many of us do today and we find out that it's not too bad but when we do it now although his plan was offered was perfectly Vindicated that it was sound when Jesus came to the Earth he proved that he was so this restaurant knew that Jesus was Jesus otherwise he wouldn't have came to him like that in that manner that attitude that spirit when Jesus came to Earth he proved that he was what he said he was that he was God manifested In the Flesh for he brought it a showdown and said if I do not the works of my father then Believe Me Not so I looked the word investment the act of investing the action or process of investing money for profit or material result we can put it in a spiritual sense the act of investing your time in God to draw closer to him that's what that investment we're trying to get and it's going to pay off if you truly spend time with God it's going to pay off every time your investment is going to grow it's going to grow substantially so in order for a person to invest in something anything you could fill in the blank a decision has to be made first you have you have to think about it and see if it's going to profit you or not that's what that's the first person a thing a person does when he makes a decision your mind has to be fixed on that thing so this young person's mind was fixed on his riches that's why nobody could tell him any different because he was already fixed on his his God his God was riches even though he he claimed to be serving great Jehovah but his God was riches so the greatest thing that we can do is invest our time in the Lord and you know how to do that by dedicating your time to him by asking the Lord what Vision he has for your life and go to Proverbs 29 18. I'm appreciate everybody is familiar with that that scripture so 20 9 18 it says where there is no vision the people perish but he that keepeth the law is happy as he so we need a spiritual vision for our life each God has each one of us a path that we have to walk a way that he wants to use us in and your walk is going to be different than my walk but our walk is going to lead to the same thing in Jesus Christ it has to so we need to be asking the Lord what Vision do you have for my life where do you want my life to go what things do you want me to do for your kingdom how can I be a service To You O Lord because at the end of the day I want to be on this Earth what you've created me to be not what I think you want me to be not what this person says but I want to be what you want me to be and you're going to find that in the word of God the word of God is going to shape you and mold you but the but the thing is you can't just read this as a dead letter you have to let God his Spirit bring this word to life we got to start becoming the word I think I said this last week you can't expect the word to conform to your life you have to conform to the word say if I'm reading something like oh man I'm not doing this Lord help me to to live this when I'm reading I'm not living right now but Lord help me I have faith that you can help me live what this word is calling me to be because this word is going to call us higher every single time we read it that's what it should do time is the greatest courage like I said before we must use this currency wisely the more time we dedicate to the Lord the more spiritual growth will transpire see it's not about the it's not about the the quantity of the time it's about the quality because you can spend two hours of just garbage quality and not get anywhere and you can spend 30 minutes of quality time and get somewhere see man thinks it's all about quantity like I can do 25 reps no you can do less reps and get better results but anyways we're not going to talk about that we're talking about here for the Lord and so it's about the quality of your time not the quantity so what you put in is what you get out we'll go to Galatians six seven through nine so we all know this about what you reap what you sow if I plant a garden and if I tend to it properly it's gonna it's gonna grow but if I don't it's not but let's just see what the word of God says we're not here for what I say but we're here for what the word says that's what's important so Galatians 6 and read seven through nine be not deceived God is Not mocked for whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap so if you sow your time very sparingly you're gonna grow very sparingly but if you sow all your time then guess what's going to happen you're gonna reap bountifully so for he that soweth to his flesh so we can we can doctor this flesh up we can make it look pretty we can handsome get haircuts and all these things uh anti-aging cream but in reality every day you're dying every day you're getting older I got more gray hair we we're not here to save these bodies yes take care of your bodies 100 eat healthy exercise is good it'll help a longevity but we can't put our Focus just on that because even Paul said Bob bodily exercise profited little so they profited some but it profits little so for he that soweth to the Flesh of the flesh reap corruption but he that sowed to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life Everlasting so that's what we're looking to invest our time in right there because we want to reap life as Everlasting because these bodies have a time a certain time and we're going to go away if the Rapture doesn't come before them and we have to be building our Treasures on the other side amen and let us not be weary and well doing for in due season we shall reap if we flank not so we got to keep reaping I know I know times are getting tough times are getting harder it's getting harder and depressing dig in but you got to keep digging I remember this uh it's this picture um is these two individuals one's digging for a diamond up top and one in the bottoms digging for a diamond up top the top individual he got so close but he gave up he was probably like five or six hits away and the individual in the bottom he had the he had the attitude of I'm gonna keep going no matter what it takes and so that's what it takes Jesus said he that endures unto the end doesn't matter how well you start off a race if you don't finish it it's going to do you no good so you gotta you gotta keep pressing you got to keep enduring because our prize is life eternal our prize to be more like him your prizes rest is peace and we have to be seeking after that because we're not here to to build an Earthly Kingdom down here we're building a Heavenly Kingdom amen amen let's go um so like we said before this man made God of riches even though he was claiming he made that his God and we can do the same thing in our life if we put anything before Christ it becomes a idol a God in our life so we got to make sure that we're putting nothing before God I don't care if it don't put your family before God don't put your work before God don't put your Earthly possession before God everything has to be in his proper place if God's the number one priority then you can have a balanced life it's all about living a balanced life bad balanced busy and focused that's the key in this life if we get out of balance then that's where God starts becoming number two in the number three and the thing is the devil's so slick about it he'll give you excuses to say well this is important I got to make money I gotta I gotta pay my bills I got I gotta do all these things and then eventually get so engulfed in the cares of his life that you get overwhelmed you get tore up you get overcharged surfing that's what the devil's goal is if the devil can get your eyes off of Christ and get you to invest your time in somewhere else then he's got you to compromise on the word of God you're compromising if you're not investing your time in him if God is not number one you are compromising I don't care what the situation is you got to believe that God is bigger than any problem in your life you gotta believe the god inside you can handle any situation in your life God doesn't make excuses Jesus didn't make excuses and he's our perfect example he kept he kept doing what the what please the father he even said not my will but your will be done and he have he invested he invested in God and he showed us what invest what an investment return is he said on the right hand of God amen amen and this restaurant ruler as we call in the Bible he passed up a great opportunity amen amen so this young man was like the great Rich laodicean Church Chase so we live in an age where everything is go go go go go everything is fast fast fast fast fast Amazon Prime McDonald's Wendy's Taco Bell Chick-fil-A I'm sorry I love Chick-fil-A but forgive me but but all these things is just we're in an age where everything is so fast paced we live in a neurotic age everybody's just going a thousand miles a time and nobody can sit down and just be still and spend time with God and the age that we live in they see a great opportunity see they see the opportunity they have to invest in God something but it's not popular Jesus was not a popular man in his days only amongst the poor and illiterate the church of his day the denomination of his day or the sectarian religions had nothing to do with him and they claim to know the word of God they claim to read the word of God but there must have been something about him that the rich young fellow seen in Jesus that he did not seen in others so he could recognize life inside of Jesus he didn't recognize life inside of his rabbis but he recognized life in Jesus and it's something that he wanted but he wasn't willing to pay the price so we got to be willing to pay the price to receive the life of bundling that Jesus died for us to have we had to be willing we have to that that the common good sense to come and ask him what he might do because he had seen in Jesus that there was a quality that he didn't seen anyone else but you see he was a very rich with the things of the world we have a lovely picture of this at the Leo the scene age in relations three because you say that you were rich and have need of nothing and yet know us thou not but thou wretched poor miserable blind and naked so we see this age they're miserable they're blind and they're naked yet they're still claiming that God is their savior but they can't truly say that he's the Lord of their life because if he was they wouldn't be looking to any everything else but him so we see this age this spirit is constantly trying to get us to say that Lord I'm good enough I don't need any more and they may not say that directly but their life is proving that that these not the god of their life and so we got to get out see we're not uh get our free car that this Spirit can't get upon us that's why Jesus said in his word be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil walks about as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour so we got to be spiritually sound spiritually connected to be able to recognize when that spirit is trying to get to us because we don't have like I said we don't have a get out of free car we got to be feeding on the right things so we said before amen but the greatest thing we need to be invested in is our Heavenly Kingdom because the kingdom of God Jesus said Heaven and Earth will pass away but my words will not so they'll be investing in the gospel that's the only thing that's not going to pass away well no matter how how well Costco's doing it's gonna fall one day see what happened in Sears they were on top and they fell so no matter how big you are well in a worldly sense you can fall the bigger you are the harder you're going to fall remember that same and a question I'm going to ask you guys I don't want you to answer it out loud what kingdom are you investing in or are you building an Earthling Kingdom or are you investing in a Heavenly Kingdom we see with Matt we'll go to Matthew 6. verse 19. so we see what it says right here Jesus is speaking to us speaking to us so it says Lane that up for yourselves Treasures upon the Earth where moth and rust does corrupt and where thieves break through and steal the Egyptians I bet the Egyptians wish they could have saw that but lay it for yourselves Treasures in Heaven where neither moth nor rust of corrupt where thieves do not break through nor steal for where your treasure is there where your heart will be also so wherever you're investing your time in that's where your heart's going to be we can say it that way so we got to stop investing our free time and everything else but God because it's only going to lead you to struggle you're not going to have the power you need to overcome the trial you're in because we're if our heart is in the right place in God then we're going to have that we sung that song we've got the power we've only got the power for connected to him if brother Roger knows this if something's not a properly the electrical wires aren't properly connected it's not going to turn on it has to be connected and so we have to be connected we got our wires have to be wired to him amen so let's keep going where for where your treasure is there where your heart be also the Light of the body is the eye if there if therefore that I be single that whole body shall be full of light but if that eye be evil that whole body shall be full of Darkness if therefore the light is in the be Darkness how great is that darkness no man can serve two masters free that he will hate the one and love the other he will hold to the one and despise the other you cannot serve God and Mammon amen amen so whatever thing we have been investing our time in is going to be what is manifesting in our life I'm gonna say one more time whatever we've been investing our time in is going to be what's manifesting in our life right this very second we'll set a statement one more time it's not just about living a good life it's about having a life behind that good life so one of the greatest Investments we can make is asking the Lord how can I help the kingdom of God lord what can I do for you what would you have me to do today for your kingdom I want my will To Be Your Will Lord if the way I plan my day out today isn't your will redirect my day because at the end of the day Lord beginning of the day I need you to be the captain of my ship the leader of my life because there's no other leader I want you to be my master Shepherd I don't want the world to be my master Shepherd I want you to lead and direct my life no matter what it takes no matter what cost I have to pay I'm willing to let everything go to serve you that's how that's how real it has to be I know you remember oh remember this song I'm not going to sing it you may take all the treasures from far away lands take all the riches you can hold in your hand take the pleasures that riches can buy but what will you have when it's your time to die only one life soon it will pass only What's Done For Christ will last only one chance to do his will so give to Jesus all your days it's it's the only life that pays when you recall you have but one life we look at we look at Abraham's life he was willing to leave everything that he knew to go follow God and we'll go to go to verse Luke 14. I believe this is mirrors Abraham's life Luke 14 26 If any man come to me and hate not his father and mother and wife and children now I'm not saying go out and use just hate people I'm not saying that but if if something's getting in the way of your walk with Christ Jesus said that for a reason he doesn't want anything to get become a God in your life so if your father like if your father is was against the Lord you serving the lord making that decision and kicked you out your house then it's time to separate but if you have a Godly father praise God don't hate him it's not what it's telling you to do but it says if any man come to me hating out his father and mother and his wife and children and brother and sister yay in his own life also he cannot be my disciple so he's telling us we got to forsake the things that are taking us away from him that's what he's trying to tell us in this passage and whosoever does not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple that's why this Rich Young Ruler cannot be his disciple he had an opportunity Jesus gave him a opportunity his hand was outstretched and he slapped it away literally he slapped it away amen we're almost done now look what prayer does prayer changed from Death to life so now we want to let's turn this corner now how important prayer is he was born in profit and his words were true and came from God and when hezekiah's prayer changed the opinion of God oh my I like that prayer changes things it's the most powerful force that God ever put in the hands of a man is a sincere prayer to offer to God Jesus said whatsoever you asked the father in my name that I'll do it believe it try it once and see if it isn't true now notice it says a true sincere prayer offer to God not just a high Lord by Lord and I'm done praying but a true sincere prayer a time invested prayer a quality of time invested prayer I want to mention that like we said before quantity is all or quality is always everything remember that it's always about that your quality everything you do if you're working at Costco if you're working at Pratt Miller if you work in that trusted tool whatever you're doing if you're working at home projects put all your heart into it everything you do do as you're doing unto the Lord that's how I try to live my life am I perfect at it no I make mistakes every time you cut Corners I promise you it will come back to bite you somehow some way and my brother Bruce said his statement are you willing to sign your name on what you did remember that Brother Bruce so are you willing to so something you do are you willing if somebody asks who did this are you willing to say this are you are you kind of like not even saying anything so it's all about what you're doing if you're witnessing discipline uh cleaning why clean toilets I love cleaning toilets and bathrooms I do I want to do the best job I can do I know it's funny but I love doing it some of our just cleaning stuff I just love doing it I put my heart into it and so it's all about heart God is looking for your heart at the end of the day that's what God is looking for is your heart amen so let's talk about one other way we can invest our time in sometimes we invest our time in complaining is that true about a situation we're in see we're real good at complaining but if we become real good at praying it'll Trump the complaining out so complaining is something that will hurt your spiritual life it will destroy you because when you complain you lose thankfulness off of God and now you're complaining see the children of Israel they had a complaining Spirit they're always complaining but God blessed them with shoes with food a pillar of fire a cloud all water they had all the essentials they needed literally it's like they're in the think they're in prison but they're not they had all these Essentials that they had but yet they still found something to complain about my brother Brandon said this statement if you're looking for something to complain about the devil will show it to you right then and there and let's go to Philippians 2 12. I think we waste so much time when we complain we waste so much time of growth that we could have because we're complaining it distracts us from the Lord and what he can do in any situation if we believe who God that God is God then why are we complaining we should believe that God inside of us is going to is only leading us to a closer more personal walk he's trying to shape you and mold you in those hard times of struggles and when he shapes you and molds he's building you because he's he's when he died upon that cross he saw a perfect your perfect sculpture the statue of a perfect man he's trying to build you into that why are we stopping the Lord from building in our life he's trying to build you to that perfect Masterpiece when you complain you're halting the progress because God is not going to be around a attitude of complaining God hates complaining we see what the end result of the children of Israel was we saw that we saw that and others had to suffer around them Joshua and Caleb had to suffer because of something that somebody else did so your decision the things you're doing is going to directly impact somebody whether it's a good decision or a bad decision so we got to be paying attention to the decisions that we're making the things that we're complaining about let's go to Philippians 2. only verses 12 through 16. and we'll close wherefore my brother wherefore my beloved I love how Paul is he's speaking to us my beloved as he have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence look it says this is a person right here work out your own salvation with fear and trembling so something that we have to do is a personal thing that we do brother John they can't do it for me I can't do it for him but then Marty can't do it for me I can't do it for him so something that we have to work out ourselves no matter X Y or Z you have to do this verse 13 please amen amen for it is God which worketh in you both to Will and to do of his good pleasure but you have to let God work inside of you so his good pleasure can be done in your life verse 14 please amen do all things look what it says right here does it say this is a sum it says do all things without murmurings and disputings it says all things doesn't what you pick and choose what you want to do but it's saying do all things and disputes and look it's a semi semicolons right there so it doesn't it's not a period it's it's some more words to come after that let's go to verse 15. it's giving you it's giving the reason why that you may be blameless because your life is speaking to somebody somebody is following you your example so the example that you're setting right now somebody is looking at you and we're living Epistles for a reason so if we're complaining all the time and somebody sees that or hears that then you're setting a bad example to Christ that you may be blameless and harmless the sons of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse Nation among whom ye shine as lights in the world we're all lights we want to make sure that we're shining and we're not just bringing Darkness to somebody go to verse 16. holding forth the word of life we have the word of life that I may rejoice in the day of Christ that I have not run in vain neither labored in vain Paul labored to give this gospel to you he was Shipwrecked stoned beaten that this gospel could be for the furthest of this gospel for us we have all we have it good we have it so good in this day and age I know it's the hardest age to live in but we got so much support brothers and sisters we have a wonderful pastor we have all these things we have we have so many blessings in our life but we still choose to complain about things I'm talking about myself too because I complain I'll admit I complain all the time I'll admit it I need to do better but we need to come together stop complaining and recognize the god that we serve can handle it can give us a strength to handle any Goliath in our life anything in our life we can handle it I'm her Billy Paul I close after this Billy Paul they asked his uh they asked brother Billy Paul about his dad brother brother Branham was the greatest thing you ever seen your dad do and he said how my dad could handle any situation that came in in front of his face he said that because that brother Brandon was relying on the guy that was inside of him to be able to conquer anything that came in his path see brother Bram didn't rely on his own strength but he knew the guy that it was inside of him could handle anything and I believe we got to believe the same thing that that same guy that's on brother Branham Jesus Christ is in you everybody and we got to believe that he said I'll be with you and in you and to the end of the world because I will not leave you comfortless he said I leave you peace giving us peace think about that come on unto me all you that are heavy laid and I will give you rest just put his yoke on it's easy simplicity so listen closely with his rise to our feet God deserves our time if you want to invest in stocks invest in stocks if you want to invest in this and that but your main investment needs to be in Jesus Christ he's the only thing that's give you a true return value a return value that will not diminish it won't depreciate because we drive a car off a lot you can drive a um a hundred thousand dollar Cadillac as soon as you drive it off the lot it depreciates but when you invest your time in Christ it's only going to grow right to the roof that arrow is going to keep going up it's not never going to go down so can we sing what a date it'll be so this thing about this the decision you make now to serve Christ you're gonna be able to sing this song all together because all these trials and tribulations it is leading us one step closer into our Heavenly homes there's coming a day there is coming a day when no heartache shall come think about it no more clouds in the sky No More Tears to dim the eye all this peace forevermore on that happy Golden Shore what a day glorious day that will be think about this what a day when my Jesus I shall see when I look upon his face the one who saved me by his grace when he takes me by the hand leads me through the promised land what a day glorious day that will be there'll be no sorrow there no more birds burdens to bear no more sickness no pain no more parting over there and forever and I will be with the one who died for me what a day glorious day that will be what a day it will be when my Jesus I shall see when I look upon his face the one who saved me by his grace when he takes me by the hand and leads me through the Promised Land what a day glorious day that will be verse 2. we know sorrow there no more birds it is too bad think about it no more sickness no pain no more parting over there and forever I will be with the one who died for me what a day glorious day that will be what a day a day that will be when my Jesus I shall see when I look upon his face the one who saved me by his grace when he takes me by the hand and leads me through the Promised Land what a day glorious day that will be
