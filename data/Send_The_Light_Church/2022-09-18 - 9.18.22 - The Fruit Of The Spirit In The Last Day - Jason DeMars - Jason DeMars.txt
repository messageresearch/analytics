of you know that I you know had surgery and everything and broke my back but every now and again discs pop out well typically in the past when they go out it's weeks and weeks and weeks everybody the the men last night prayed for me I'm very tender but it's back in place and I praise God for that the other testimony that I originally wanted to share this morning was um I know that we all go out and witness for lost souls and talk to people and and whatnot one thing the Lord has revealed to me um he did this years ago and he brought it back to my attention if we don't seek Him First in prayer and we just go out witnessing to everybody After Time a lot of times we get defeated because we're not seeing those Souls come to Christ because the spirit of the Lord isn't calling that person as our word says unless the spirit of the Lord is drawing someone near to him we're wasting our time and our breath start praying God bring those that are right for the Harvest to me put me in front of those that that are ready for you that need you and then fill my mouth with the things to say to them and as you all know what my family has brought multiple people in lately I've been praying for Justin

future but come on [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah you know we can we need to believe past the point of well this is just one occurrence God is a present God he wants to do things in our life we just

praying for the service amen wasn't it a blessing last night my I still been thinking about that you know the devil tries to trick us put us in a box put us in a room say we can't get out but that's the wrong thinking in the wrong thinking leads us to the wrong feelings and the wrong concept about things but God is here to set us free and let's just subject ourselves to the word whatever it might be and those of you that are getting baptized just be listening for the Lord to speak anything to you that you just need to take put it under the blood because that that has that's the first step

we're worthy of nothing we are worthy of less than nothing we're worthy of death but Jesus came he shed his blood so that we could be set free he paid the price to deliver us from the grips of the enemy amen let's pray father we thank you so much for that blood thank you for the grace that you've bestowed upon us Lord and for your mercy Lord that while we were dead in sin and trespasses you came and you redeemed us you you poured your spirit into our lives Lord to change us and transform us Lord and Lord you don't just stop there but you continue to move and work by the by the renewing of our mind by the sanctification of the spirit Lord to to change us and make us into the image of Jesus Christ to be living uh Epistles read and known of all man Lord I pray you'd use this service for a portion of that purpose Lord we're living in an hour we call the end time and it's so late it's the end of the end time Lord we're just approaching the Rapture so close Lord and and you're moving and working in your bride Lord to build us to the perfecting of the Saints to the maturing of the word Lord I pray that you would further that today some people are just beginning that Journey Lord but entering in to the spirit of the Lord it will take them and carry them to maturity in their life to be ready for a rapture Lord we ask Lord for your mercy Upon Us Lord would you come and you would you take the word and make it life to us Lord ours so many promises in your word when we are weak then we are strong as that's that's that's the scripture that's what Paul wrote that's what he experienced and what he wrote Lord when we are weak then we're strong because it's your power yes manifested through US Lord and so I I come for myself and for each one here but Lord confessing and understanding that there is there is no power or goodness in me Lord that can help this people but it's in you Lord and we want to surrender and submit our hearts and lives to you and ask that you would speak the truth over the people Lord and help them in their walk we ask these things in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen but we had a wonderful time last night I appreciate all of you appreciate brother John thank you for the opportunity here to speak to the people and it's a great blessing to me and a privilege and an honor and we thank the Lord for what he's doing in this part of Michigan amen and how he's using you here and to bless people on the missions field around the world you're you all are a great blessing and uh let's continue go on our subject we're going to be speaking on the Fruit of the Spirit in the last days I'm basing it on a quote that brother Branham had he talked about the fruit of the spirit ripening in the bride tree and that's the hour that's the hour we're living in so amen a Galatians chapter 5 we're going to look at and I'm just going to read verses 22 and 23 and then um I'll have you take your seats and then we'll expound on this this chapter a little bit but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long-suffering gentleness goodness Faith meekness Temperance against such there is no law and they that are Christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit may the Lord add the blessing to the reading of his word he could be seated so turn back there to verse 16. we're going to get more of the context this I say then walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh so looking at the greater context Paul is seeking to get the Galatians away from looking to outward obedience for their leadership and salvation the Galatians receive the message of Paul they they received it and Paul details to them do you receive the spirit by The Works of the law or did you receive it by the hearing of faith and of course the answer is obvious by the hearing of Faith that's how they received it the Gentiles while they heard the word the spirit fell upon them and they received it the same way they did on the day of Pentecost and so they heard it they heard the word it was mixed with faith God opened their hearts and the spirit fell amen and so Paul is trying to remind them do you remember what God did in your life the experience you had it wasn't because you were obeying the law of Moses God chose to save you apart from that then Paul left said they said Elders in the church Paul went away and what happened the judaizers come that's what we call them people from Jerusalem came and said wait wait wait wait you're mixed up you can't be saved by going directly to the gospel first you have to be a part of the Covenant the old Covenant you have to be a part of Moses law first you have to enter into a relate become a Jew is basically what it's saying you have to convert to Judaism outwardly physically then you can receive the Holy Spirit and be a part of the New Covenant but apart from the being in the old Covenant you can't enter the New Covenant and so Paul is is start is is showing them that's an error that's false teaching that you've turned away from the Simplicity of the Gospel into the law and you don't even you and those Jews that came to you don't even understand the purpose of the law if you walk in the spirit you're not going to execute or perform the works of the flesh it's not if you it's not if you obey the law then you won't fulfill the lust of the flesh no that's a false understanding you your nature is Fallen it's sinful you cannot please God In the Flesh that's what the law teaches us Allah is a Schoolmaster to lead us to Christ it's to point out our weakness our sinfulness our need for salvation and for our savior and so if you walk in the spirit you won't fulfill the lust of the flesh you won't execute or perform those works of the Fallen nature so that's the that he's saying there this is the key to obedience not the law the key to obedience is the Holy Spirit In You producing The Works of the law in the sermon is your life was worthy of the Gospel brother Branham says when this takes place the thing you'll do then you'll find out that the spirit that comes into you from the New Birth you will believe and do everything that God says in his word for you to do and everything that the Bible quotes for you to do you'll punctuate it with an amen and you'll not stop day and night until you receive it that's right that's right and in all this time you'll certainly above everything bear the Fruit of the Spirit beautiful quote Galatians 5 17 for the lust for the flesh lusts or sets its heart against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh so the the spirit of God sets its heart against the Flesh and the flesh sets its heart against the spirit amen and this is speaking of someone who's born again otherwise you don't have you don't have a person who's living in their fallen nature having their human Spirit lusting against the flesh they're in agreement together against the word against God so here we have a born-again person their flesh is working against the spirit so of course we understand it's not just merely flesh but it's the nature we have two Natures within us fighting against each other the nature which Paul calls the flesh the sinful nature versus the nature of the holy spirit so there's a war going on the spirit battles against the sinful nature the sinful nature is battling against the spirit you can't do that without being born again so what is he saying there is a war going on inside of you to manifest what the the works of the spirit and says they're con these are contrary to what one to the other so that you cannot do the things that you would so you so this is mindful of Romans chapter 7. you they're contrary to another one another the things that you desire are Desiring to do which is that's your desire he changes your desire right when you get the holy spirit that changes your desire that doesn't get rid of the sinful nature sinful nature is there but now you have power to defeat it when you first get saved what what happens a process starts when I got saved I was not immediately a mature Christian I was a baby I had a lot of problems I had a lot of things in my life that weren't right I smoked marijuana the Lord delivered me from that right away I was I was never addicted to it so I never I I could just stop it drinking alcohol getting drunk I was done with that swearing it was a habit and sometimes it came out and oh my what am I doing um listening to to I loved rap music I I built myself on rap music for years and years and it was it was difficult to let go of it I immediately threw it all away and then shortly thereafter I went and bought some more and I remember I asked my mom I don't know what's going on I I need to get rid of this rap music and all these movies that I'm watching she said well have you asked the Lord to take the desire for it away I said well yeah I have but honestly I do like it still I do will ask him to make you not like it anymore okay all right so then I approached the Lord that way and the Lord took that desire away now there was a war going on because I had a intense passion and desire for the word of God I mean I was feeding on it feasting on it and then listening to rap music and then watching Rated R movies what am I doing and then after I'm done I'm convicted that's the work of the spirit of the Lord you you know if if you grow up in the message you probably don't have as bad a problems as I had but you also might have as bad problems that I had but when you're a babe in Christ you you deal with those things that's what sanctification is that's for that's what being transfer being transformed by the renewing of your mind is we're going from what we were before you had no power to overcome before you you were dead in sin and trespasses all you could do was sin and trespass now God comes to you he changes your desire now you're Desiring the word but there's habits and there's things in your life and the Holy Spirit begins to wash you and it's a process and it's a battle and you have to fight and you'll win because the spirit of God's inside of you and you'll they'll be ups and there'll be Downs and as you get more mature the ups and downs change and the deception of the enemy changes so that's what he's saying you cannot do the things you would my desire was not to go into rap music My Desire was not to swear but I would do that but little by little the spirit of the Lord worked in my life and transformed me now I now I don't swear amen now I don't cuss now I hate rap music now I hate rated R movies but that wasn't so at the beginning but it was a but the desire was to be against it see and so that desire changes but still sometimes you do things that you don't want to do we still do they're maybe not as big of a deal but they're still a big deal Sin is Sin and it's displeasing to the Lord and as a Christian we don't want to do it right that's what Paul is talking about they're there there's a war going on verse 18. but but I like this I'm happy about this but sometimes butt is like I love you but oh don't say that because now you're saying you don't love me uh no that's not what it is this is a good but he's saying I can't do the things that I want to but if you be led of the spirit you're not under the law what is Paul saying being under the law is what condemnation that's the part that these Jewish people and judaizers and the Galatians that were converted isn't this amazing to think brothers and sisters and let's let for a moment give Grace to other people that maybe have gone the wrong way these Galatians received the message from Paul walking in the truth false teachers came and deceived them they're Christians they're born again they got they got went the wrong way they were accepting false teaching and here comes the Apostle around to correct it and I believe they received this correction they received this clarification and they were God's people isn't that marvelous you could see in this day there's people that they might be going the wrong way but God can correct them God can deal with them and we praise the Lord for that we we don't need to write people off Paul didn't write the Galatians off he didn't say we have a book of Galatians because Paul believed that God could correct them yes yes right and so here he is correcting them and we have this letter instructing us because of that but if you're LED of the spirit that's the key in our choices in our decisions and the things that we allow in the ways that we react we have to be led by the spirit in the way that we think as we talked about last night we need to be led by the spirit because in that case when you're it when you're in that condition then you're not under the law under the law I mean is the it's the law of sin and death now the law is Holy the Commandment is Holy why because it's expressing the nature of God but you can't obey the Ten Commandments in your flesh it leads to condemnation but when we have the Holy Spirit it's going to lead you to obedience to the Ten Commandments right so then we're not under bondage anymore because we have the positive side we have the nature of the Ten Commandments of The Giver of the Ten Commandments inside of us leading us to obedience to the word John 16 13 says how be how be it when he the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come so that's that's the school Master the law that leads us to Christ it's the spirit of Truth guiding us and leading us and teaching us so that's the opposite end of being led you need to be led but you need a guide in order to be led without the guide you're not being led so you have the person being led and the guide that's Christ Christ in you the hope of glory back to Galatians 5 verse 19 now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness idolatry witchcraft hatred variance emulations wrath strife seditions heresies envyings murders remember even hating your brother is murder also drunkenness revelings partying and such like of the things of which I tell you before as I have told you in time past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God so the these are the works of the Flesh and he says if you're doing these things you're not going to heaven you're not going to the Millennium you're not going to the new Earth the place that people that do these things have is death and hell and the Lake of Fire the Bible says also all liars will find their part in the Lake of Fire that's what the flesh does this is the works of the flesh The Works of the flesh does not produce obedience to the law The Works of the flesh produce death it might look like very religious very religious flesh works but it's still death the Jewish people the Pharisees they could outshine us in many ways but what it that's that's not what it is that's not what God is looking for you're St you can be ever so religious you can follow whatever religion you have Buddhism Judaism Christianity Catholicism any religion and be dead the Bible is not bringing us religion religion is just a covering you're you're covering up something that's broken the gospel is not a covering right it's it's not it's not just covering up a problem it's going to the core of the problem and transforming it and ultimately bringing a total transformation of that body so that that flesh is is swallowed up in life it's it's total Redemption it's Total Transformation it's it's a walk right if we walk in the spirit it's a personal walk and fellowship with God himself and out of that brings comes obedience to the word and so to someone looking from the outside they might not be able to tell the difference I might need not be able to tell the difference a person can be following the message along and obeying the message brother Branham says that's just being capable of reading but we have to have the Holy Spirit revealing the word to us personally in our in our in our closet in our home in our church everywhere but it's it's a one-on-one walk with the Lord now this is a whole other topic but in today the gospel that's presented to people is a warm and fuzzy relationship with Jesus right so you look at that what's the what's the what's wrong with that well Jesus comes to make me feel fulfilled in my personal life makes makes me come to make me feel comfortable happy at rest the problem is it's not the Jesus of the Bible that's being presented it's another Jesus and that's the great danger especially on the TV evangelist the great mega churches they're bringing a spirit of deception I believe that's directly where the Antichrist fourth horse rider is working to deceive the people Jesus says as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent you're not seeing a gospel of repentance brought over the television it's the gospel of you can have your best life now you can be rich if you just give to our church see using a principle of God misusing a principle of God if you just give to our church you'll be wealthy like I am and so this this is the gospel and this is the Jesus that's being presented today and it's it people love it without twenty thousand thirty thousand people show up to Services stadiums go build up why it's encouraging the flesh the fleshly desires it's another Jesus it's a different Jesus than what we find in the Bible and so that's not the Jesus we're presenting we're presenting the Jesus says you're lost you're a sinner you need a savior you need to be changed you can't do it yourself you can't even believe yourself no man can come to Christ unless the father draws him first you you it's not about you choosing it's he says you haven't chosen me I have chosen you and ordained you to bring forth fruit he's calling he's calling people and he says repent turn away from your sinful life turn away from that and you know what there's going to be difficulty why he says take up your cross it doesn't take up take up your pillow take up your Mercedes and follow me take up your cross and follow me the cross was a place of torture death and shame and we as Christians are called to suffer and rejoice we're not called to live an easy life and this this makes clear if you follow the lusts of the flesh you'll die you'll die in your sins and millions are in the church maybe billions in churches and dying in their sins because they haven't heard a gospel of repentance a gospel of the blood of Jesus Christ and the gospel of the sovereignty of God they've heard false teaching false Doctrine and what is it it's another Jesus this is the there's only one Jesus who is Jesus not a not not merely a person that we talk about from history Jesus is the same today he's revealing himself in his word today to and through his people and so the present tense Jesus is what we're talking about the one that came down with an open book to reveal himself in this day Seven Seals you know it's it's a it's astounding what you see and what people will say how necessary is the opening of the word we're talking about the fruit of the spirit in the last days ripening in the bride tree how does that make even any sense to anybody you as message Believers have been around a while it makes perfect sense you understand but if you're new it might not make any sense but there is a opening of the word restoring us back to the original faith not another Jesus the real Jesus on display today restoring us back to the full word of God Amen that's why we need the old Seven Seals that's why we needed the seven Thunders to utter their voices to restore us back to the original faith so that we would have the full word on display it's not a new message it's not a new revelation this became a sealed book and it's still a sealed book to many people in the world but to us it's open Malachi 4 the message of Elijah is open that up so that we can have a maturing of the fruit of the spirit this is not something new this is a finalization of what started in the first church age but as the apostles fell asleep instead of the church growing to maturity they started they went downwards and they descended and they slowly fell away from the faith but then God began to work and through the Reformation in Luther and Wesley and the different reformers to restore the church back to the original faith in the Pentecost the restoration of the gifts but then he sends Elijah to gather these things together and bring an opening of the Seven Seals so that this book is no longer a sealed book but it's an open book and by revelation we have an understanding there and through that brings a maturity of our faith so that the fruit of the spirit can be in maturity in our lives and when we get saved in under this message what happens a maturing process begins and he's taking us to where the early church should have matured to amen God's working God's moving it's not by the sight of our eyes but it's by faith because the word says and so then we get to the scripture the Fruit of the Spirit in other words this is the results of what the spirit the the life of the tree produces fruit right an apple tree produces apples so this in other words this this is what is produced in the life of someone that has the spirit of God in them it doesn't produce drunkenness murder reveling witchcraft idolatry variants emulation draft Strife that's not what the Holy Spirit produces the Holy Spirit produces love Joy peace long-suffering gentleness goodness Faith meekness Temperance and he says against such there is no law see that's the positive side the other thing we saw the negative that was there's a law against those things but there's no there's no Allah against love God doesn't say hey don't love anybody he says love that's the positive side Joy this is what the spirit of the Lord produces peace long-suffering gentleness goodness that's what when you have the Holy Spirit this is what happens inside of you of course a person can be loving without the Holy Spirit a person can have joy without the Holy Spirit person have peace person can be patient you know a person can have a good positive nature they grew up in a good home or they over came a lot in their own life and they fought to have these things in other words there can be a mimic of that there can be something that looks exactly like the Christian version and even sometimes exceeds it but that's not that's not the point is is that these are the things that the holy spirit is going to produce inside of your life and and in a growing Factor yeah in an increasing Factor you know we're transformed by the renewing of our mind as we feed and feast on the word and in prayer the Lord changes us and makes us like Jesus Christ and these are the things that he produces and this is this is what um is spoken of in is it second Peter um the stature of a perfect man verse chapter one verse 5 and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and to patients godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and has forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling an election sure for if you do these things you shall never fail so add add ad we're supposed to add these things to our faith and each of these things are are things that if they're in you and abound they're overflowing is what what Peter is saying if they're in you and are overflowing maybe they're not overflowing now maybe some of them are now overflowing in me but they will be because that's what the Holy Spirit does in a Believer causes these things to abound they make you so that you're not barren barren means fruitless you have you're not producing fruit remember Jesus that I've chosen you and ordained you to bring forth much fruit and it says it's isn't it interesting that you shouldn't either be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ so you can have knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ and be Barren and unfruitful you could have knowledge about God without knowing God personally you can have knowledge regarding the Lord Jesus Christ and that would produce barrenness and unfruitfulness but then you can have a revelation of who Jesus Christ is and that's going to produce his life it's going to be a produce a fruitful and life-giving kind of life that you have the holy spirit in US produces the positive life God hasn't called us to the works of darkness or just avoid the works of darkness but he's called us to manifest his nature it's it's not he's not calling us to have an absence of the negative we just want you to not be negative could you at least just not be negative no that's not what he's calling you to he's calling us to the positive to put the positive things of the word on display in our lives in the sermons The Sermon the marriage of the Lamb brother Branham says the Holy Ghost is meekness joy peace long-suffering goodness gentleness patience faith the Holy Ghost that's the fruit of the spirit that the Holy Spirit bears in the Church of the Living God sweetness and humbleness humility love one another long suffering if a brother has gone wrong don't just beat him or something or another go after him and see if you can get him back don't wait for the preacher to do it you do it somebody else preacher can't do it all neither can the deacons everybody is a member of this body of Christ should go after one another and if we got the spirit of Christ in us he taught the great parable they left the 90 and 9 and went after that one that's what we're supposed to do but we say oh let him go we never should do that we should be gentle forgiving long suffering that's the Fruit of the Spirit now he didn't say we should be compromising we should be so loving that we never confront anybody over anything no that's the whole point is you are doing that right your love is so strong that you're going after brother well you went wrong what happened that's he's not saying oh yeah I know you're doing wrong let's go up to the bar together that's not what's being that's not what's being spoken the the brother or the sister has fallen made a terrible mistake and you go to them and say we love you what happened how can I help you that's the whole that's the whole point that the prophet's trying to make Galatians 5 24. and they that are Christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts amen brother Branham uh in one place he says we don't need a Revival we need we need a death we need a dying out amen if you belong to Christ if he's purchased you if he saved you you've crucified the flesh that's a harsh statement you've tortured you've strangled holded the life out of the flesh you and you got Paul says I Die daily and so that that's a great need of a Christian you're dying out on a daily basis to the flesh with its affections it's its desires its passions and its lusts that which the flesh has its heart set upon and its desires set upon you put it to death you crucify that a real Christian will do that because if because he says if you belong to Christ they that are Christ have crucified the flesh not might not could maybe someday they do it they do it this that's the kind of life that Christ produce in US is a person that puts his flesh to death you don't have to you don't in your own power put your flesh to death what you're doing is you're surrendering yourself to what the holy spirit is doing within you sometimes we don't know what he's doing some like we said last night sometimes we don't have the answer Elijah had a great experience Mountaintop Mount Carmel spirit of God made visible manifested vindicating proving his ministry then he went and met a messenger of Jezebel and it caused him to run away that was that was the wrong thinking he didn't wait on the Lord for that he just ran and that's the same thing that us sometimes we don't know God didn't show Elijah what to do but there's a principle they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength you're going to find as you grow in your Christian walk and he's going along into your Christian walk much of what you do is waiting on the Lord and a young young people learn to wait on the Lord don't run ahead don't try to find your own way don't try to figure it out on your own that's your yeah that's your biggest air that's all of our biggest errors that we make is figuring it out on our own it's waiting on the Lord even someone even someone that has a calling on their life that the Lord has spoken to and said you're to do this to me I've I've found that myself is I have to wait on the Lord so much more than now than before when I was just ministering in my local church and working at Wells Fargo I just had to wait on the pastor to ask me to preach that's my that was my waiting on the Lord but now with with the ministry the Lord's called me to my goodness I feel like that's all I'm doing is wait so the Lord spoken this thing to me okay I know I can't just rush into it I have to wait he has to bring it together he has to bring it to pass and we have to remember that's the same thing in our all of our Lives personally God has to move something it's just like you read about brother Branham and his visions he couldn't go the Hat was supposed to be here this person had to be here this one had to be wearing this shirt he couldn't just make it come to pass he'd make it worse that's a perfect illustration for our own lives is when we try to make things come to pass we're going to make it worse you just have to wait what are we going to do now we're going to wait on the Lord that's that's much of the Christian Life and it that takes a lot of crucifixion yes that takes a lot of dying out to what we want what we desire verse 25 if if Paul why why do you say if it's because on a daily basis we have a choice to make now don't take that into false teaching understand that it's God working in you both to Will and to do of his good pleasure but the verse right before that says work out your own salvation with fear and trembling because it's God working in you both to Will and to do of his good pleasure I think that's what Paul is getting at right here is if we live in the spirit work out your salvation with fear and trembling because God's working in you or we can flip it around and say if God is in you you will work out your salvation with fear and trembling but it is a daily choice to die we can choose to engage in things that feed the flesh you know movies television sports we could spend all our time feeding on that I don't I don't I don't say I don't go to the try I'm not asking you to go to the extreme um I understand that there's people and they let me they might like football they might like this thing but don't put those things first in your life I enjoy football but I watch it on Monday not on Sunday I don't miss church I don't I don't I don't ordain my life around the Minnesota Vikings and I sure hope you don't ordain your life around the Detroit Lions sorry little NFC North teasing but um we we understand we we have these things and we have little things that we do in our lives that help us to relax or enjoy something that's okay but if we start to order our lives around these things entertainments and that oh my you're feeding your flesh and you're not walking in the spirit you know we we have ups and downs as Christians we have time I had times I was backslid you know you can backslide your faith can grow weak your heart can grow weak you can get in the in the position where your desire for God is so small but then God comes and like we talked about last night he will lay his hand heavy upon you and you won't enjoy it at all right and the next thing you know you're on your knees Weeping at the altar praying through and you're you're going back to your first love so if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit our our wherever Our Hearts Passion goes that's what the kind of Life we'll Live so if our heart's passion is for God then that's the kind of life that we're going to live but if our heart's passion is for football or Netflix or uh whatever you streaming service you choose that's your heart's desire you're going to start living that kind of life and it's not going to be the Life of Christ certainly so in the sermon turn on the light of a lengthy quote here he says think the people can go right on preaching the equipment ecumenical council can join up with the Catholic church just as they promised to do all organizations can come on that but the mark of the beast is already there they take it in that and they say oh Hallelujah bless God there are so many got saved last night they did they dance in the spirit they spoke in tongues that don't mean one thing see oh they're Meek and gentle and humble yes sir they got the fruit of the spirit that's no sign not a bit let me give you the fruit of the spirit between Jesus and the Pharisees see which one had the fruit of the spirit see what if I stood now it sounds like I'm going against everything that I've been teaching but I want this to be balanced in the word let me give you the fruit of the spirit between Jesus and the Pharisees see which one had the fruit of the spirit what if I stood as I started to say a while ago against Christ now for a minute God forbid forgive me for even saying it see but just to show you something what if I come to you and say say you congregation who's your friend who shows the fruit of the spirit your kind old priest who comes to you in the hospital when you're sick sick your gentle old priest that's right who is it that always loans you some money when you're up against it in a tight place you members of his congregation don't you go to your kind old priest and he loans you money see who is it that's always loving and kind and showing the fruit of the spirit your kind old priest who is it that studied for years and years in the synagogue down there where his great great great great great great grandfather come from all the way down who is it that studied and worked hard and got doctor's degrees and phds and llds to know his word to know this word and stand here and deliver it to you every Sunday morning in his congregation your kind old priest who's this Renegade called Jesus what school did he come from what school is he out of where's his Fellowship card what organization does he belong to what does he do when you you all have a family argument who comes to you your kind old priest and you have an argument against the neighbor over here your kind old priest helps helps you make up said you all are children of God you shouldn't do that see what's this Jesus as of Nazareth doing he tears the thing up what does he do he lambasts your organization what does he do called your priest a blind leader of the blind he called him a snake in the grass he took the sacrifice that God ordained and kicked the tables over and throwed the money out and looked upon them with anger did you ever see a priest look like that now where is your fruit of the spirit mm-hmm not by speaking in tongues not by dancing in the spirit not by joining church not by fruit of the spirit Christian Science can outsmother any of you on that sea and deny even Jesus Christ was divine not that but it's the word living there it is if they'd only looked he was Messiah he was the Living Word made manifest and a man that's got the spirit of God in him or a woman lives that word lives right out in them that's the heartbeat the predestinated for the word of the Lord comes to them and they are the word to the people written Epistles red of all men is that right could the third poll be on you can't judge by speaking in tongues neither can you judge by the fruit of the spirit but it's a manifestation of the word of God brought to light it's the light that does it the man that walks in that light Jesus Christ was not founding upon speaking in tongues though he did it he was not the fruit of the spirit though he did you couldn't judge it but he believed and punctuated it and God lived every word of the promise of that day through him that's the light of the hour that's the evidence when he tells me that the Holy Ghost falling in them will deny the word of God being so there is something wrong with it now a person could take that quote and say well everywhere I go I just find their what they do wrong and I condemn them for it I've seen people come through to churches to our church and that's all they did and they they they they use this misuse this quote and abuse this quote to use the word of God as a hammer to beat people over the head with it and every every little thing they didn't like they would stand up in the church and blast it and and I've I've seen that people take that Unbound imbalanced approach that's that's not what this quote is saying this is the quote is not saying just act like a jerk to everybody and believe the word what is it what is it saying there it's saying you're judging Christians you're judging merely on the outside and I you hear it when you witness the message to people all the time how can that be true when I know for a fact this person is a good person this pastor is a good person hey I wasn't talking about that Pastor I was talking about the Bible the truth of the Bible but my pastor is such a nice man my parents are good people and and I know these people they're really good the Bible says Acts 2 38 the Bible speaks about serpent seed the Bible speaks never talks about a trinity but my pastor is a good man so that's your answer to the Bible truth you're not punctuating the word with the name men regardless of what you see around you that's not what it's about and brother Brad I'm saying that's not the evidence being good people being a kind old priest speaking in tongues dancing in the spirit wonderful we want that we want the experiences all the experience of the lord we want to be good people but that yet that's not it it's receiving the full word yes for your age for your day and then seeing that live out through you so when that word comes in you it will produce the fruit of the spirit amen it will produce and will manifest the gifts of the Spirit it it will show forth a living God a resurrected Jesus Christ in you right he's not saying well you don't need the fruit of the spirit you don't need the gifts of the Spirit is that what the do you think the prophet is saying you don't need any emotions you don't need any no he's not saying any of that he's saying first don't get it out of order the evidence of the holy spirit is when the spirit of Truth comes he'll guide you into all truth the evidence is not tongues it's not emotion it's not the fruit it's not love the Holy Spirit produces those things the prophet wasn't teaching us to be against love and against fruits and against gifts no he's teaching us the right order get the word in you believe and receive that then that will produce the life of Jesus Christ sometimes it's confrontational that's clear Jesus was confrontational sometimes it's very patient sometimes it's loving and passes over a multitude of sins but sometimes it takes it and says that's wrong that's we we don't we don't stand for that here this is wrong right so again see the balance of the word don't don't go a million miles one way or a million miles the other way get the word in you because a person can Matthew 7 makes it very clear a person can be Anointed with the Holy Spirit cast out Devils heal the sick preach and the laws gets saved and yet be lost themselves Jesus said they said Lord Lord have we not prophesied and done many wonderful works in your name cast out Devils healed the sick he says depart from me you that work iniquity I never knew you so what is it it's he that doeth the will of the father what's the will of the Father the word he that walks in and lives the word that's the one that Jesus is looking for whether whether Miracles are produced or not it's walking in the word but we know signs follow them that believe but the signs following is not the evidence it's the word we give it the word test not the sign test amen amen not the emotion test the word produces emotion the word produces science the word produces fruit but get it in its proper order in proper direction turn with me to Ephesians chapter four foreign let's start at verse 11. and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers and he's still giving and so this is God that Paul is going to start detailing God's purpose for the church he's called he's we understand he's called us to go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature that's that's the starting point and we're to continue that until the very end until the last one is called but even more so God has a purpose inside of this church for the people that have been called and so now he's beginning he's going to start to tell that four so he's he sends he gives so this is Christ giving it's talking about Christ he ascended on high and gave gifts unto men and he gave some Apostles and some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers so this is Christ's gift to the body all right for what purpose verse 12 for the perfecting of the Saints so you see this word perfect or perfecting it doesn't mean sinless what what does this word mean in in the Greek there's a word telios and it speaks of maturity maturity it speaks it speaks of finishing so a finishing maturity however however this word perfecting is not that it's not that word telios in that sense it's a different word it is a word that means equipping so equipping speaks of a military and giving them their equipment giving them their uniform and their weapons Etc everything that they have need of to fight the enemy so the this is talking about the five-fold ministry is set is given as a gift to the body for the equipping of the Saints to give you the materials that you need to fight the enemy okay so brother Branham has asked the question do the tapes or do does the five-fold ministry perfect the church and it gave it was a puzzling answer to me at first and until I studied this verse closely I didn't realize what was being said brother Branham answered says no the blood of Christ perfects the bride it's a personal thing individual so I'm going but doesn't the five-fold ministry perfect the Saints that's not what that's saying it's it's not saying that and that's why brother Branham answered that way no it's not the tapes no it's not the fivefold ministry it's the blood of Christ that perfects the bride so what are we saying here this the fivefold ministry equips the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ the whole body ministers to itself builds up itself in love that's what you see that verse later saying um verse 16 at the end says make an increase of the body under the edifying of itself in love so it's not the five-fold ministry is not only ordained for edifying they're a part of it but all of us are for that so back to the verse 12 it's for the equipping of the Saints to do what equipping for what for the work of the ministry so we we many times speak of this so-and-so is a minister it's actually not scriptural to speak that way yes they're a minister but so are you every believer is called to be a servant to be a minister of the word in their life amongst each other building each other up the Bible says the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all to for the common good for the common benefit to one another for the edifying of itself in love and so the fivefold ministry equips the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ verse 13. till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of God there's that word unto a perfect man until a fully mature man so here is God's purpose for this body Ministry is so that this mystical Body of Christ as a whole will come to a place of being a mature man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that was God's purpose in calling a church calling a people is to bring them to the maturity of the Messiah so that each one of us will be living the same kind of life that the Messiah lived we're supposed to be Messiahs we're supposed to be walking in that same image so we have to have a fully restored and matured word in us to produce a matured Christian life verse 14. that we henceforth be no more children toss to and fro and carry it about with every wind of Doctrine by the slight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive verse 15. but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplyeth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part make an increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love so he starts out and he says Christ descended and gave gifts and he gave some Apostles some prophets some pastors evangelists teachers right so there's a there is there is people that are ordained of God called of God calling on their life to preach the word and to be examples to the flock those are the two places that that in in First Peter chapter five he speaks of the elders and he says feed the flock of God taking the oversight thereof being examples examples of the flock so we're supposed to lead by feeding the people and by being an example right and through that that equips the Saints for the work of the ministry so that together the body as a whole will grow into maturity so it's it's all of our ministry together all of our ministry together not just fivefold Ministry but the whole body ministering to itself bringing it to maturity so that what why is he bringing us to maturity for the rapture for the change of the body and that's that's why God put his word and brought his Revelation why does Paul in Ephesians chapter 1 here he's people that are Christians mature they're maturing they're growing in the word and he says in verse 16 I cease not to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayers that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of glory be given to you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him the eyes of your understanding be enlightened that ye may know what is the hope of his calling in the what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints what is exceeding greatness of his power to us word who believe according to the working of his mighty power which he rod in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the Heavenly places so he's this is God's purpose in us he wants us to have a have a revelation of his power the greatness of his power that is in US it's it's in us it's not just the power far out it's in Heavenly places no it's a he wants it to be revealed to you that this power is in you and that power is going to literally change your body to be likened unto Jesus glorious body but we have to come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a fully mature man to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ we have we as a body of people have to grow to that before we can get that new body before we can be changed into his likeness physically he's going to change us into his likeness spiritually that's what the message is sent for in Christ is the mystery of God revealed brother Branham says when I think of it I suggest see denominations pass off the scene and everything else just going see when I see God's Great purpose revealing himself and having first to reveal himself in Christ the fullness of the godhead bodily and then to bring that fullness of godhead bodily into a people that he could have the preeminances the oversight the leading just a few paragraphs later he says now the complete fullness of the godhead bodily dwells in his church the preeminances all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was was poured into the church the Believers that's what he's speaking about there in the Statue of a perfect man he says you get it the people who died in here are depending and waiting on us so this church has to come to perfection in order to bring the resurrection and they're under Souls under the altar waiting for this church to come to its Perfection that when Christ does come I've got so many more scriptures that I want to read but I want to I want to start the process of closing so we're not here all day Philippians um excuse me Hebrews we're going to do Hebrews first Hebrews chapter 5. and we're going to start at verse 11. so he's speaking about Melchizedek he says of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered seeing your doll of hearing for when the time you ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God and are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat for everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe listen closely but strong meat belongs to them that are full age there's that same word we saw before perfect man in Ephesians 4. so full age is another way to translate that strong meat belongs to the mature even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both Good and Evil therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on into Perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of Faith toward God and of doctrine of baptisms and of laying out of hands in the resurrection of the dead and of Eternal judgment and this will we do if God permit so God didn't permit them in the first church age to go on to maturity the foundation of everything was laid there but it wasn't until the seventh Church age that you had a prophet messenger come and bring out and show the full reality of Melchizedek and it's the connection its connection to us and who we are in him but there you know where he says leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ it almost sounds like well we're going to leave Christianity behind it go on and make a new religion tell us not what Paul is saying he's saying not laying again in other words if it's already been laid for you don't just lay it again but go move on to things of maturity move on from the things of babes to the things of full age but the thing is there are people that need Foundation our children do new believers do so those things need to be addressed but again you can't just stay there is what Paul is saying millions of churches in the world that's all that they do they stay there the first principles and even many churches they don't even understand the first principles if they just understood the first principles it would be wonderful but they're not even they're not even getting to the first principles but we have the foundation but we have to build on that Foundation to bring maturity and isn't it interesting that Paul says you need a revelation of who Melchizedek is why in the world would that be important well we know we know if you don't know go read who is this Melchizedek and you'll find out why that is important because you'll find out the secret of your own life so again that being being having milk that's that's okay if you're a babe in Christ drink milk but don't just stay drinking milk because you'll net you you you can't get mature on milk only we need we're in the age where we need strong meat we need steak we need to feed on feed on those kind of things because that will produce maturity it's what we feed on that will then produce the kind of life that we need to live Philippians chapter 3. and verse 7. but what things were gained to me those I counted loss for Christ the eight doubtless I count all things but lost for the Excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but done that I may win Christ and be found in him not having mine own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the Faith of Christ the righteousness which is of god by faith that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death if there we have that if again if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead this is the out resurrection of the Dead to put it in our vernacular the Rapture if by any means I might attain unto the Rapture it's a very strange way to speak it's it's it's it's it's different than we anticipate because if I'm a Christian I'm going in the Rapture right why is Paul saying that I may know him and the power of his resurrection don't you already know him sure but there's there's a continual process there's an ongoing work that we have to be a part of so that we can attain unto the resurrection of the dead so that we can go in the rapture and as you read this you're going to see there's some Christians they're not made ready they're not prepared and they don't go in the Rapture and there's some Christians who are made ready who know him and have an ongoing process of knowing him and they're made conformable to his death and they go in the rapture verse 12 he says not as though I had already attained in other words Paul's not saying oh I'm not a Christian I don't have the Holy Ghost I'm trying to get the Holy Ghost that's not what's being spoken here he knows he's saved he knows he has the Holy Ghost but what is he what is he saying I haven't reached that full maturity wherein I can go in the Rapture and we can say the same thing here are we still here today not that I have already attained either are already fully mature but I follow after if that I may apprehend or lay hold of that for which also I am laid hold of of Christ Jesus so Christ took hold of my life for a purpose so that I would take hold of full maturity and an immortal body a changed body Brethren I count myself not to have already apprehended but this one thing I do this is key this is it this is what we as Christians need to be living forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth under things which I which are before I press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus where it says High Calling there it literally is the upward call of God in Christ Jesus what is the upward call The Rapture the catching catching away and so he calls it the I press towards the mark so that what is that it's the finish line the finish line is full maturity and a rapture so he's I'm pressing towards it so the picture is when you see the runners they don't just casually here's the finish line and they just casually oh I'm just jogging through I mean no they I'm not going to Sprint because there'll be an injury but if I was sprinting I'm going to pretend like I'm sprinting but you're sprinting and you you you reach forward to hit that Mark they hit that line and you push your body ahead to make it so that's the picture that we're getting from Paul he's pressing forward he is forgetting the things behind and he's reaching forth and that's an expression of the kind of desperation that Paul is living with this is this is not a casual thing this is not well I'm a superstar and I just have to jog all the way through it's no no is a battle it's a fight there's a Finish Line and we have to be totally desperate and passionate about what we're doing because we need to be to get there and then at the end we could say with Paul he said I labored more abundantly than all the apostles yet not I but the grace of God that was in me so we understand that it's the grace working in us to produce this kind of desperate life but when Grace is in us that's what it produces so in the sermon perfect Faith musicians if you'd come not a faith but a perfect Faith Build It Up in here and watch a perfect god with a perfect heart keep a perfect Promise by his perfect word which is sharper than a two-edged sword and a discerner of the thoughts of the heart what we're coming now to the perfection because the people has got to come to this in order for the rapture that's what's holding it away right now is waiting for the church to come into that perfect raptured rapturing faith look for it looking for it it means a lot of Shaving down for me it means a lot for you but together we'll make it by the grace of God so there's a sanctifying work that's taking place there's a shaving down the prophet speaks of it why is he talking about a shaving down it means there's things on our life that need to be shaved off need to be cleaned off there's a maturing that needs to take place in our life in that word so that we can be made ready so it's a transforming that's why brother Brandon preached this the power of transformation it's not a mistake we're living in the hour where our bodies are going to be transformed but first the spirit inside of the spirit and the soul and the body this body needs to be brought into total maturity and completion I'm going to finish with first Thessalonians 5 23 and 24. and the Very God of Peace sanctify you holy sanctify you completely and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ isn't that amazing this is where Wesley got his Doctrine for entire sanctification but I believe he was just probing at something that was for our day in our day God is bringing us to entire sanctification why because it takes a fully restored word it couldn't be just a partial word that they had in Wesley's day it's the full word restored today that will sanctify us holy and then then he says he wants our I could understand if he said our spirit and soul be preserved blameless under the under the rapture let's put it that way but he says even your body to be preserved blameless so there's going to be a people living on Earth when the the coming of the Lord takes place that their their tripartite man body Spirit soul is going to be blameless and preserved until that hour what a magnificent thing verse 24. Faithful Is He that calls you who also will do it amen aren't you glad for that promise he's called you he's going to do it we're living in the age where the bride is going to go in the Rapture it's
