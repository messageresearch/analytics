[4:17] may you just come and walk amongst us in
[4:20] Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen
[4:24] if you'll turn with me this morning to
[4:27] Isaiah chapter 9
[4:32] amen praise the
[4:39] Lord Isaiah chapter 9:6 it says For unto
[4:43] us a child is born unto us a son is
[4:47] given and the government shall be upon
[4:49] his shoulder and his name Shall be
[4:52] Called wonderful counselor the Mighty
[4:55] God the Everlasting father the Prince of
[4:58] Peace amen amen
[5:01] amen amen you may be
[5:05] seated you know the
[5:08] scriptures are alive amen and and
[5:11] they're always unfolding so it's always
[5:14] kind
[5:15] of difficult though it's it's good
[5:18] around the holidays and that that we
[5:21] look at scriptures and things that we
[5:23] normally don't look at during the year
[5:26] you don't really preach about the wise
[5:28] men in the middle of July or August
[5:30] people are scratching their heads so
[5:33] being that this Wednesday is
[5:36] Christmas and brother John so graciously
[5:40] ran
[5:43] away
[5:45] so why
[5:48] Bethlehem that's the question
[5:51] why God you know he knows all things so
[5:56] he's omnip omnipotent which means he's
[5:59] all powerful F he's omnipresent which
[6:00] means he exists everywhere he's not
[6:03] omniscient and he knows all things even
[6:06] when the world before there ever was a
[6:08] star in the heavens you think about it
[6:11] even before God created light and before
[6:13] he created everything and he was alone
[6:16] with his thoughts and he looked at all
[6:19] the things that he all the attributes
[6:21] that he wanted to express to to his
[6:25] family amen and his family was just a
[6:28] thought he wanted to express himself to
[6:31] them he wanted to show them he was a
[6:32] savior but he couldn't show them he was
[6:34] a savior unless something fell and then
[6:37] he he wanted to show that he was a
[6:39] Healer but somebody had to be sick
[6:41] before he could do that and because he
[6:43] knows all things and he has everything
[6:47] God before he even the Bible tells us
[6:50] plainly it says before the foundation of
[6:52] the world Christ was even
[6:54] slain he was slain before the world ever
[6:57] even came into existence and here was
[6:59] God already knowing that he was going to
[7:02] make this promise unto us a child is
[7:05] born he already had made the idea he
[7:09] knew that man could not experience him
[7:13] as a
[7:14] spirit we couldn't if we were just a
[7:17] cloud or a spirit you know when God
[7:19] created Adam he created him in a spirit
[7:21] form but that wasn't what God wanted God
[7:24] wanted flesh and blood that he could
[7:26] that he could fellowship with so he knew
[7:29] that when man fell that he would have to
[7:31] become the kinsman redeemer he knew he
[7:34] would have to come down and step into a
[7:36] robe of Flesh and he had to he had to
[7:39] come down and become Kinsmen with man
[7:42] and experience the things that man did
[7:45] experience so because God knows all
[7:48] these things why would he choose
[7:52] Bethlehem why would he choose that of
[7:56] all the places that are in Palestine and
[7:59] in their there's many great
[8:01] cities many
[8:03] locations cities that are seemingly much
[8:06] more known in the lore of history and
[8:08] better foretold bigger cities so why
[8:12] should God choose little Bethlehem to be
[8:15] the birthplace of his
[8:17] son why would he choose Bethlehem to be
[8:20] the place where he would come down and
[8:23] step into
[8:25] flesh amen there are many places that
[8:29] are greater for instance there's the
[8:32] historical lore of Jerusalem the proud
[8:35] Jerusalem the capital of it all and it's
[8:38] one of the largest cities in
[8:41] Palestine and then we wonder why God
[8:43] would pick some little tiny
[8:46] insignificant town like
[8:48] Bethlehem instead of
[8:51] Jerusalem if the temple was in Jerusalem
[8:54] and he put his name there and and the
[8:56] pillar of fire came down there that
[8:58] would be a great place that if you were
[9:00] going to come down in fellowship with
[9:02] man why wouldn't you choose
[9:05] Jerusalem but as the scriptures has said
[9:08] what God has determined to do it will be
[9:11] done amen so I like that God has already
[9:14] pre-planned
[9:16] everything that's going to happen to
[9:19] us tomorrow next week next year
[9:22] everything God has all otherwise he's
[9:24] otherwise he's not all
[9:26] knowing and if you can't have confidence
[9:28] that God is is leading you then you miss
[9:30] the whole concept of what he's trying to
[9:33] do amen you miss the whole concept so
[9:38] what God has determined to do it'll be
[9:40] done and there it is so God foreordained
[9:43] it to be that way and or it never would
[9:45] have been that way and that's what the
[9:47] scripture says in the 15th chapter of
[9:48] Acts it says there is nothing by chance
[9:52] God knowed everything it just didn't
[9:53] happen to happen that way God made it
[9:56] that way and then we see with our little
[10:00] finite Minds we begin to think over then
[10:02] why would the great king of Heaven
[10:05] choose a little place like that instead
[10:07] of the capital of
[10:10] Judea why why would he look at such a
[10:13] little place and there are many places
[10:16] that have a greater spiritual background
[10:20] than what Bethlehem has for instance
[10:22] some of the places like
[10:24] Shiloh Shiloh was an ancient worship
[10:27] place of Israel where they came year by
[10:30] year so if you go back and you look at
[10:33] what happened in Joshua 18 there's the
[10:36] first mention of the city of Shiloh and
[10:40] when the children of Israel if you go
[10:41] and look at the map and it's always good
[10:43] to look at the map because it Moses
[10:46] talked about this side of Jordan and
[10:47] that side of Jordan well this side of
[10:50] Jordan actually is the country of Jordan
[10:53] so they came up on the east side of the
[10:55] Jordan River and crossed Westerly they
[10:59] went Westerly into the land of Canaan
[11:01] across Jordan
[11:03] River and when they first came
[11:06] across you all know the story and and I
[11:09] could have given lots of scriptures to
[11:12] Amanda she'd have been she'd have had
[11:15] miles but when they came across the
[11:18] priests they took the Ark of the
[11:20] Covenant and when they stepped into the
[11:22] water the water jelled up and they
[11:24] walked across from east to west into um
[11:31] into Canaan and
[11:33] then they went up and they in the
[11:37] northern part of the the country and the
[11:40] northern part of the country they made
[11:41] this place called
[11:45] um did I get are we talking about
[11:51] Shiloh good cuz that's
[11:55] gilgal so anyways when they that when
[11:57] they went across when they came across
[11:59] the very first thing they had to do is
[12:02] they had to go up in the northern part
[12:05] of Israel and set a place up for the
[12:08] Tabernacle a resting place for the
[12:09] Tabernacle and that was Shiloh and it's
[12:12] mentioned in Joshua 18 and it's a
[12:15] located about 19 miles north of
[12:17] Jerusalem on in the West Bank and the
[12:20] Tabernacle was first set up there as a
[12:22] place for worship and the thing that's
[12:25] interesting about that is that Israel
[12:27] came to Shiloh for over 1300 or over 300
[12:31] years during the Book of Judges and that
[12:34] was a place of worship it was God's
[12:37] first place of worship for Israel why
[12:40] wouldn't God just choose Shiloh then
[12:43] amen when you go over and you look in
[12:45] 1st Samuel 1 you find out that that was
[12:48] the place where Hannah went up to Shiloh
[12:51] when she went up there and she prayed
[12:54] earnestly before God because God had
[12:56] caused her to be Barren and God gave her
[12:58] a promise of one of the greatest
[13:00] prophets in the Old Testament Samuel
[13:03] came to to Hannah and Hannah went back
[13:06] to Shilo she didn't go to Jerusalem she
[13:08] went up to Shiloh and she went up there
[13:12] and she and she dedicated Samuel back to
[13:16] God at
[13:18] Shiloh and sha and Samuel ends up being
[13:21] actually the last of the great judges
[13:24] the prophet judges that watched over
[13:26] Israel before Israel gave it all up for
[13:28] King
[13:31] Samuel was the last one
[13:33] amen so why wouldn't God just pick a
[13:36] place like Shiloh a place where the
[13:38] Tabernacle first
[13:39] appeared and then there's gilgal which
[13:42] is another spiritual place of worship
[13:45] why wouldn't he let him be born in
[13:47] gilgal so we find out that when the
[13:50] children of Israel will go back now when
[13:52] they crossed over the Jordan River when
[13:56] they crossed over the very first place
[13:59] the very first thing that God had Joshua
[14:01] do when they crossed over the Jordan
[14:04] River he took one Prince out of each of
[14:07] the 12 tribes and they picked up a stone
[14:10] out of the river and they went and they
[14:12] made a memorial to show that God had
[14:16] separated them they were now coming out
[14:17] of the world and they were now going
[14:20] into the promised land and he said let
[14:22] this be a place of a memorial for you
[14:25] it's a place they called it gilgal and
[14:27] it's also the place where God in
[14:30] reintroduced the children of Israel to
[14:33] circumcision they could not they
[14:35] couldn't become into the abrahamic
[14:39] Covenant without being circumcised
[14:42] because that was a covenant that God had
[14:44] made with them and neither can the
[14:46] believer the believer's got to come out
[14:48] of the world he's got to come across to
[14:50] gilgal and he's got to sacrifice his
[14:53] flesh he's got to sacrifice his life or
[14:55] he can't even move on into the promised
[14:58] land amen it was east of Jericho it's
[15:01] before the very first battle the biggest
[15:04] battle that Israel had the very first
[15:07] big battle before that they had to come
[15:10] to gilgal what a place of
[15:14] significance why wouldn't God just
[15:16] choose gilgal
[15:18] amen it's on the eastern border of
[15:21] Jericho it's between Jericho and the
[15:24] Jordan River and God renewed The
[15:27] Covenant the Covenant of circum
[15:30] circumcision there before the children
[15:31] of Israel could proceed into the land of
[15:34] Canaan
[15:36] amen amen
[15:40] amen so God could have done any of those
[15:43] things he could have chosen Sho he could
[15:45] have ch chosen
[15:46] gilgal he could have chosen another
[15:49] place
[15:50] Zion amen there was another place Zion
[15:53] and Zion was on the
[15:55] Mountaintop and he says you wonder why
[15:58] Jesus would not be born there then in
[16:00] Zion because it's a great historical
[16:03] Mark for the Lord had blessed his people
[16:05] in the ages amen we don't sing it much
[16:08] around here but where we used in Detroit
[16:11] we sing this on the top of Mount Zion is
[16:15] a
[16:17] city and the Earth with its Glory it
[16:20] doth
[16:22] fill I shall look on its beauty in the
[16:27] morning when I I reach that City on the
[16:33] hill Oh that
[16:35] City on Mount
[16:38] Zion though a pilgrim yet I love thee
[16:43] still I'll not leave
[16:46] thee Through the
[16:49] Ages when I reach that City on the
[16:54] hill why wouldn't God choose
[16:57] Zion why wouldn't he choose
[16:59] Zion well I don't know if you knew this
[17:02] Zion was a fortified stronghold of the
[17:05] jebusites and it was on a Mountaintop
[17:08] and when we get over in a second and
[17:10] that's first identified in Joshua 15 but
[17:13] in 2 Samuel 5 David he went up to the
[17:17] jebusites he got up there and he said
[17:20] hey I want this mountain I want this
[17:23] place called Zion he says I want it and
[17:26] he took it from the jebusites
[17:29] and the Mount Zion then became renamed
[17:31] as Jerusalem the city of David praise
[17:35] the Lord amen so why wouldn't God want
[17:38] that place to come you know he even
[17:40] prophesied he said suddenly the Lord
[17:42] himself shall appear at the temple why
[17:46] wouldn't God be born in
[17:48] Jerusalem amen praise the Lord amen amen
[17:53] it looks like he would have chosen Zion
[17:55] or gilgal or Shiloh or one of these
[17:58] other great places where there had been
[18:00] great blessings and great teachings and
[18:02] there's other great cities in Israel
[18:04] amen such as heon which is a place of
[18:09] Refuge for a man wanting a City of
[18:11] Refuge a place of safety and there was
[18:14] six of those Moses God told Moses in
[18:18] numbers 35 he says I need you to make a
[18:22] place of Refuge but when you make a
[18:25] mistake and the devil's coming after you
[18:28] and God himself is standing in your way
[18:30] to bring judgment upon you there's a
[18:32] place of Refuge where you can go there
[18:36] was three Cities of Refuge on the east
[18:38] side of Jordan where Gad and Reuben
[18:42] settled because they were they were
[18:44] Cattlemen and they said the land is good
[18:46] for us this is where we want to have it
[18:49] amen so there was three cities on the
[18:52] east side of Jordan and then there were
[18:55] three cities on the west side of Jordan
[18:57] amen
[18:59] in Hebrew heam was one of those cities
[19:02] amen it was a place of Refuge it was a
[19:05] place of safety it was a place where you
[19:08] could go and no matter how mad somebody
[19:12] was at you no matter how much they
[19:14] didn't like you they couldn't come in
[19:17] and avenge they could not enter that
[19:20] City of Refuge and as long as you stayed
[19:22] there God's mercy if you look at the at
[19:24] the um at the Ten Commandments and all
[19:28] the laws that are written out in the
[19:29] Book of Leviticus there isn't much Mercy
[19:31] in there you make a mistake you're
[19:34] finished and I'm glad that God had a
[19:37] place of Mercy for the believer amen
[19:42] amen so brother brandom said he says so
[19:45] he said why couldn't God have
[19:48] chosen
[19:49] heon why couldn't he have caused so in
[19:53] Joshua
[19:54] 20 on the east side in the North where
[19:59] we now call the Golan Heights it was the
[20:02] Golan back then there was a city it was
[20:05] called Golan it was in Bashan of GAD and
[20:08] then rth Gilead was in the center of the
[20:11] city or in the center of the land and
[20:13] then beaser which was in the South was
[20:16] in the wilderness of Reuben and those
[20:20] three were all on that side of Jordan a
[20:24] place of Mercy a place of Mercy if you
[20:28] crossed over Jordan and you were in the
[20:30] in canaan's land and you found yourself
[20:33] that by accident you killed somebody and
[20:36] they were to die and the the law said uh
[20:41] eye for an eye a tooth for tooth arm for
[20:44] an arm leg for a leg you knew you're in
[20:46] trouble there was a there was three
[20:48] places in Canaan
[20:50] amen there was cadesh which was in the
[20:54] north part in Galilee there was sesim
[20:58] which was in the area where that Ephraim
[21:00] settled down in and then there was heam
[21:02] in the South and that was in the land
[21:04] that was given away to Judah Amen in any
[21:08] one of those
[21:10] cities Jesus Christ is the only one that
[21:13] came and brought us
[21:15] Mercy look at the Pharisees and the
[21:17] Sadducees oh they didn't have no
[21:19] mercy they didn't have any Mercy on
[21:22] anybody you either belong to us or we
[21:24] kick you out of the church if you
[21:25] believe in this Jesus Christ guy we're
[21:27] going to excomm you at you you can't you
[21:29] have no more sacrificial lamb they were
[21:33] there was no place of Refuge but Jesus
[21:36] Christ could have been born in heam he
[21:39] could have been born in rth Gilead he
[21:41] could have been born in beaser he could
[21:43] have been born in any of these places
[21:46] that showed Mercy
[21:47] Amen brother Bram said so maybe if I'd
[21:50] have been thinking I would have brought
[21:52] him over to cadesh
[21:54] Baria I'd have brought him over there
[21:56] for there was the Judgment seat
[21:59] a place of Refuge amen he says perhaps I
[22:03] would have brought him over into that
[22:04] country for his birthplace or maybe
[22:07] would have chosen some of these other
[22:09] cities but you know I'm so glad that
[22:12] even just little insignificant things in
[22:17] the Bible mean so
[22:22] much I want you to think about that you
[22:26] know brother John he talks about got the
[22:28] vision going beyond the curtain of time
[22:32] and there's thousands and thousands and
[22:35] thousands running up to brother
[22:39] brandom and you a little
[22:43] insignificant but yet God has picked you
[22:45] up out of Flint or out of Fenton or out
[22:49] of the it's the surrounding City just
[22:52] look at how much God puts in the value
[22:56] of you am
[22:59] amen he could have picked better
[23:02] places but he picked you there's better
[23:05] people to pick than
[23:08] us right people that are much more
[23:12] righteous they didn't have as much
[23:14] baggage they don't have as many
[23:17] problems but God look down on
[23:20] you
[23:22] amen amen I want you to look at Genesis
[23:27] 49 if before we go
[23:30] further Genesis
[23:34] 49 Jacob is giving a blessing to all of
[23:38] his
[23:39] sons and here in verse
[23:42] eight it says
[23:44] Judah Thou Art he whom thy Brethren
[23:47] shall praise and thy hand shall be in
[23:50] the neck of thine enemies and thy
[23:52] father's children shall bow down before
[23:54] thee so Judah had a very important
[23:57] position to play
[23:59] Judah is a lion's welp from the prey my
[24:02] son Thou Art gone up he stooped down he
[24:05] crouched as a lion as an old lion who
[24:08] shall raise him up and the scepter shall
[24:11] not depart from Judah nor a lawgiver
[24:14] from between his feet until Shiloh come
[24:17] and until him shall be the Gathering of
[24:20] the people
[24:22] be so God
[24:24] chose when when Joshua came across and
[24:27] he he divided the land and he gave
[24:30] everybody a place Judah was a very
[24:35] important Place judah's inheritance was
[24:39] very
[24:40] important and we need to realize that in
[24:44] um Joseph's or Jacob's
[24:48] prophecy that his prophecy is actually
[24:51] talking about a lion of the tribe of
[24:54] Judah he's he's actually telling that
[24:58] that will be a place of
[25:00] leadership somebody will raise up out of
[25:02] Judah amen and Joshua dividing up
[25:06] divided up judah's portion and if you
[25:09] notice on the map it's geographically
[25:12] just west of the plain sea that's what
[25:15] brother bam called it but it's actually
[25:17] the sultan sea a few miles south of
[25:20] Jerusalem the capital and when Judah was
[25:23] getting her part or his part rather in
[25:25] the land his Province we would call it
[25:28] it's strange but the little city was not
[25:32] even mentioned
[25:34] Bethlehem yet it was there because at
[25:38] Abraham I believe it was Rebecca was
[25:40] buried in that place and I looked and it
[25:44] was
[25:46] actually um Rachel was buried in
[25:51] Bethlehem it wasn't called Bethlehem at
[25:54] that time but he says Rebecca was buried
[25:57] in that place and it must have been just
[25:58] a little village of some sort because if
[26:01] you read Joshua 5 you'll find out there
[26:04] was 115 major cities under the domain of
[26:08] Judah besides the villages and little
[26:10] towns 115 cities were mentioned and
[26:14] perhaps when it was divided up Bethlehem
[26:17] was so little maybe just a little house
[26:20] or two it wasn't even mentioned in the
[26:23] inheritance and then we find out that it
[26:25] never actually came to even be known
[26:28] think about it the spiritual
[26:31] significance of you sitting here this
[26:34] morning people read the Bible and they
[26:37] have no idea what they're looking
[26:39] at but God a little insignificant you
[26:43] little insignificant me God looked down
[26:46] and picked you amen picked you
[26:50] up how many people today are going to
[26:53] watch a live nativity scene oh look at
[26:57] the Cow oh look at all this look at
[26:59] everything and they're not even seeing
[27:01] that God wants to be alive in your heart
[27:05] amen what a great thing why
[27:10] Bethlehem a little insignificant
[27:13] Place
[27:16] amen and brother Brenham said he said in
[27:18] the beginning in Joshua 5 he says it was
[27:21] never even he it didn't even in
[27:26] before it was of many many years before
[27:29] it became known as that
[27:32] place and the one that founded it was
[27:35] Caleb son Caleb's son whose name was
[27:40] Solomon and if you go and and you do a
[27:42] study you'll find out in the scriptures
[27:44] that in some places it's interpreted
[27:46] Salon in other places it's
[27:49] PMA and he founded it the Bible said he
[27:52] was the father of it that's found in 1
[27:55] Chronicles 2: 50 and 51 he said he was
[27:58] the founder of Bethlehem so in other
[28:01] words he must have moved in there and
[28:03] started some sort of business and
[28:05] Commercial and trading and so forth and
[28:07] then it grew up and later we'll find out
[28:09] that the real reason of it the whole
[28:11] lands was jealous of that little place
[28:13] of land which lays just to the north and
[28:16] east and slopes a little bit to the
[28:18] south on the spur it was the most
[28:20] fertile part of all of Palestine it was
[28:24] a Corn Belt it was a wheat belt and
[28:27] there were great Olive orchids there and
[28:30] it was in that part of Bethlehem or in
[28:33] Palestine at the end of judah's Province
[28:37] and if you go and you look at a map that
[28:39] shows where all the 12 tribes was
[28:42] Bethlehem lays right on the edge of the
[28:46] Border
[28:48] amen so we found out it it
[28:52] became the home of the Harlot
[28:55] Rahab we find out that Rahab it's it's
[28:58] important to know that Bethlehem was
[29:00] founded by Joshua's son or Caleb's
[29:05] son and Caleb's son was a general in the
[29:09] army of
[29:10] Israel and Rahab was a
[29:14] gentile she was a
[29:16] harlot she was a harlot she but she
[29:19] believed the message when it was
[29:21] presented to her she believed it an
[29:25] insignificant harlot in a city of
[29:29] wickedness she believed the message when
[29:32] it was presented to her and God gave her
[29:35] a promise if you put a Scarlet thread
[29:38] out the window he said when we come in
[29:40] in judgment strikes when I see the blood
[29:43] I'll pass over you amen we're a little
[29:46] insignificant we think oh my I pray all
[29:49] the time and and it just doesn't seem
[29:50] like anything's going my way brother
[29:53] sister just make sure the bloodline is
[29:55] shown if the bloodline is showing God
[29:58] will pass over you when judgment strikes
[30:02] it's a promise it was a promise to to
[30:05] Rahab the Harley and after the city
[30:09] fell
[30:11] Solomon he took a liking to
[30:14] Rahab and he married her and they moved
[30:18] to Bethlehem amen praise the
[30:22] Lord amen somebody who the promise
[30:25] belongs to and somebody that has no
[30:28] claim yet he took brother God took
[30:31] notice of you this morning amen can't
[30:35] say that enough that God took notice of
[30:38] you an insignificant Harlot not believ
[30:42] in the word of God being raised up with
[30:45] idols and and fallowing whatever you
[30:47] were taught but one day God looked down
[30:50] and took notice of you and picked you up
[30:52] amen amen and took you to
[30:55] Bethlehem a place where there's plenty
[30:58] to eat there's plenty to drink amen
[31:02] praise the Lord amen
[31:05] amen we find out it was because it
[31:08] became the home of Rahab which is the
[31:11] stories in Joshua chapter 2 when Israel
[31:14] passed over the borderline of the Jordan
[31:16] River into Palestine we are acquainted
[31:19] with the story of Rahab amen and God
[31:22] looked down when the Wrath fell and the
[31:24] trumpets began to blow God seen that
[31:27] scarlet cord hanging there as a memorial
[31:30] it always pleased him to pass over the
[31:32] blood when I see the blood I'll pass
[31:35] over you he saw it and when the shaking
[31:39] and the Holy Spirit rumbles the Earth
[31:41] and shook Down the Walls 20 feet thick
[31:43] not one rock fell where that cord was
[31:46] hanging oh brother get the blood
[31:50] applied amen apply the blood apply the
[31:52] token to your house amen amen
[31:58] and she fell in love with this man was a
[32:01] captain and Prince of Judah and he was a
[32:03] captain of Israelite armies his name was
[32:06] Solomon just like the King Solomon and
[32:09] he was a captain and she become a great
[32:11] romance with him and he was a prince of
[32:13] Judah why wasn't he a prince of Ephraim
[32:17] or Reuben but see God before the fation
[32:21] in the world God saw it all and planned
[32:24] it all out so it could be an
[32:26] encouragement to you you
[32:29] am so that when you think about oh my
[32:31] this nothing's going right everything
[32:33] else you can look back in the scriptures
[32:35] and say but here God fulfilled his word
[32:38] and I'm believing that word I'm hiding
[32:40] it in my heart I'm saying Lord if you
[32:43] can do it for RAB you can do it for me
[32:45] amen amen praise the Lord amen she
[32:49] married him and when the estate was
[32:51] settled up for the Israelites she in her
[32:53] beloved husband they lived in Bethlehem
[32:56] amen and we find out it would become a
[32:59] great place and how beautiful it is to
[33:02] think of the great wheat country there
[33:05] and it would be the bread place of the
[33:07] world and it is true no wonder Jesus had
[33:09] to be born there because he was the
[33:11] bread of life amen and there's where the
[33:14] nation came for their wheat all the
[33:17] nations came there for their corn for it
[33:18] was in Bethlehem that had the fertile
[33:21] lands and you see this little bitty
[33:23] thing just saying oh it was a province
[33:25] of wheat yet that meant meant
[33:29] something it meant
[33:31] something amen we find out later in the
[33:35] Old Testament we find out
[33:38] that
[33:39] Rahab um she had a son and his name was
[33:46] Boaz God has not left us here to
[33:51] die
[33:54] sorry just tell that devil he he didn't
[33:56] bring me out of the world to destroy me
[34:00] that's what the children of Israel
[34:01] believed they believed they said oh God
[34:03] you brought us out of Egypt was really
[34:05] great we had McDonald's on every corner
[34:08] 71s everything was going good for us and
[34:10] now we got to pray for our
[34:13] food okay what's the
[34:15] problem God brought you out of the
[34:17] things of the world he can take care of
[34:19] you so if you have to pray for your food
[34:21] you have to pray for your health you
[34:23] have to pray for your job you have to
[34:24] pray for God will take care of us amen
[34:27] he and bring us out here to destroy us
[34:30] no matter how much you like the onions
[34:31] and the leaks and you want to go back
[34:34] don't go back amen amen so we find out
[34:38] later on so Rahab and
[34:43] Salma they had a son his name was Boaz
[34:46] and we're all acquainted with another
[34:48] great story and there's a Boaz was born
[34:52] in Bethlehem amen and the story of Ruth
[34:58] is a great
[34:59] story we find out that Ruth
[35:04] she she had two
[35:06] sons and she raised she and her husband
[35:09] they they they were they were Believers
[35:13] and they followed the word of God and
[35:15] they raised their children in the word
[35:17] of God but when it got
[35:19] tough when things got wrong and it
[35:21] didn't look like things were going well
[35:23] they
[35:24] left Bethlehem
[35:28] they said oh it's a famine if things
[35:30] aren't going right and they left they
[35:32] went down into
[35:34] Moab they went down with the
[35:36] compromisers and they hung out there for
[35:39] a while but we find out that God will
[35:43] only bless you when you stay with the
[35:45] word only when you stay with the message
[35:48] of the hour but you can he's not going
[35:50] to keep you here you yeah you can go off
[35:52] into Moab go ahead see how it works out
[35:55] for
[35:56] you and
[35:59] Naomi her husband died and then her two
[36:02] sons died and we know that under the law
[36:06] a woman had no rights none whatsoever no
[36:11] claim on the country only if she had a
[36:14] man that could vouch for
[36:16] her and she took Ruth who was a moabitas
[36:20] in Oprah and they came up out of Moab
[36:24] and they went back to Bethlehem
[36:28] why
[36:30] Bethlehem they went back to
[36:32] Bethlehem because they heard there was
[36:35] there was a harvest there they heard
[36:37] there was a Revival there and when when
[36:42] Ruth's sister counted the cause she said
[36:45] I I can't live this life I can't do it
[36:49] but Ruth told Naomi she said Naomi
[36:52] whatever it says to do I will do it I
[36:56] will go wherever you go
[36:58] your God will be my God I'm not
[37:00] interested in the things of the world
[37:02] I'm not interested in going back that
[37:03] way and she went up into Bethlehem and
[37:06] if you go and you read the book of Ruth
[37:08] you find out that she appeared she came
[37:10] up there and it was the ending of wheat
[37:12] harvest in the beginning of barley
[37:15] Harvest
[37:17] and so when she got up
[37:20] there Boaz was there and brother brandom
[37:24] said Boaz represented Christ and where
[37:27] where was he he was at Bethlehem and
[37:29] where was Ruth coming to she came to
[37:32] Bethlehem where was she gleaning at in
[37:35] Bethlehem see all those spiritual
[37:38] significances to this place here the
[37:41] background to this great scene that was
[37:43] taking place God knowing that from the
[37:47] beginning amen and she began to question
[37:49] her mother-in-law what she must do and
[37:51] finally Ruth was married to Boaz a
[37:55] gentile married to a prince
[37:58] again in Judah and she settled down and
[38:01] she lived in
[38:02] Bethlehem and after being married for
[38:05] some time they brought forth a son which
[38:08] added more and his name was oid it's at
[38:12] the end of The Book of Ruth
[38:14] amen another case another time when a
[38:18] gentile was married to a prince
[38:22] right think about it this morning you
[38:25] have no claims you have no claims on the
[38:29] scriptures if Jesus Christ had never
[38:32] come and be
[38:35] crucified if he had never come you would
[38:38] have no way to get salvation you'd have
[38:42] no claim on Heaven amen only through the
[38:47] prince and being married to him praise
[38:50] the Lord amen praise the
[38:54] Lord and it said after they had been
[38:56] married for some time time Ruth she
[38:58] brought forth a son named OED and he
[39:01] brought a son named Jesse and Jesse had
[39:04] eight
[39:06] boys amen and where was Jesse
[39:10] at well he wasn't an Ephraim he wasn't
[39:13] over at gilgal he wasn't up in Jerusalem
[39:16] he was at Bethlehem
[39:18] amen and God looked at it and see people
[39:24] just didn't they didn't get it they they
[39:26] they
[39:29] it's just little Bethlehem so that
[39:31] that's where the food food banks at the
[39:34] wheat we can go there we can get we can
[39:37] get wheat we can get barley we can get
[39:39] we can we can survive but yet God had
[39:43] something hid in
[39:46] Bethlehem amen and when when Jesse had
[39:50] these eight boys it was this great
[39:53] prophet
[39:55] Samuel who was
[39:58] born and raised up by
[40:00] Shiloh which wears the
[40:02] Tabernacle God sent Samuel from Shiloh
[40:07] all the way down to
[40:09] Bethlehem and when when that Prophet who
[40:12] was a judge when he came down into
[40:15] Bethlehem the scripture says that
[40:18] everybody was afraid of
[40:20] Samuel because they knew if a prophet
[40:22] showed up it was a sign of
[40:24] judgment it was a sign your foolishness
[40:27] is done away with you better straighten
[40:30] up and he came down and he went to Jesse
[40:33] and he said Jesse said I have not come
[40:35] down to do this but to S sacrifice unto
[40:38] the
[40:39] Lord amen and Jesse when he got all of
[40:43] his boys together all eight of them and
[40:46] the first seven of them we don't know
[40:48] they could have been Carpenters some of
[40:50] them could have been great Farmers other
[40:53] men they could have been mathematicians
[40:55] and everything else but the one that God
[41:01] chose was a
[41:05] Shepherd was a
[41:08] shepherd and where was he at
[41:12] Bethlehem God didn't it was all exact
[41:16] God was trying to show the world what a
[41:18] great thing he was going to do but
[41:22] because people were blinded by the
[41:25] Pharisees and the Sadducees and and what
[41:27] they thought God was showing them all
[41:29] the time what he was going to do amen
[41:34] amen Samuel came with a cruise of oil
[41:37] and the great prophet he was sent to
[41:38] Jesse and he said God has chosen one of
[41:40] your boys to rule and serve my people
[41:42] and it was out on the back side of the
[41:45] field a little Shepherd there was a
[41:47] little Ruddy scrawny looking boy was
[41:49] brought David the old to the youngest
[41:53] and Samuel poured the anointing on him
[41:55] in the presence of his brothers and them
[41:57] who stood about and proved that a God
[42:00] had anointed him King where was it at
[42:04] Bethlehem glory to God in the highest no
[42:07] wonder Bethlehem where he was anointed
[42:09] king it was in Bethlehem where David was
[42:13] born and his greater son Jesus the son
[42:17] of David amen also had to be born and
[42:21] Bethlehem because there's such a close
[42:23] knit between the two the father and son
[42:25] and Not only was this great son only the
[42:28] son he was the root and The Offspring of
[42:31] David where Bethlehem he was even before
[42:35] David and he'll be after David he is for
[42:38] Everlasting from Everlasting but
[42:40] according to the Flesh and all the
[42:42] things to be fulfilled he was the son of
[42:44] David he was to be born years later in
[42:47] the same Bethlehem this little forsaken
[42:50] City
[42:52] amen amen I asked sister Donna the other
[42:55] day I said I said ever listen to why
[42:58] little
[42:59] Bethlehem she said oh yeah I said and
[43:02] why did brother brandom say Jesus was
[43:04] born there she goes uh Bethlehem it's
[43:08] House of God's
[43:09] bread I said okay do you know about all
[43:13] this other
[43:14] stuff and then I told her I said I can't
[43:16] tell
[43:18] you I don't tell her what the Lord is
[43:20] showing
[43:21] me and most of us when we think of
[43:24] Bethlehem that's what we think of the
[43:25] House of God's bread but it was more
[43:27] than that it was where God was revealing
[43:30] that God himself was going to be a
[43:33] shepherd He was going to be a Shepherd
[43:35] when he came the son of David was going
[43:38] to look for the he was going to leave
[43:39] the 99 and look for the one the little
[43:42] insignificant one the little
[43:44] insignificant
[43:46] you yeah think about it out of all your
[43:51] family out of all however whether you
[43:53] got two siblings or four siblings and
[43:55] whatever your lineage is God came
[43:58] looking for you that's right in
[44:02] Bethlehem and he left it there so that
[44:04] you'd be encouraged in this
[44:07] hour they you know that God has poured
[44:10] his oil of anointing on you and brought
[44:13] you to a place where there's plenty to
[44:16] eat amen praise the Lord amen amen The
[44:22] House of the bread of God the house of
[44:25] God's bread Elohim
[44:28] he could have been born anywhere else
[44:30] where could he have been born anywhere
[44:33] else but that and it was hid to
[44:36] everybody but that Prophet out of
[44:39] Bethlehem shall come him and they was
[44:41] looking in Jerusalem they were looking
[44:44] in all the big Shiloh you think about it
[44:46] now you see when the three wise men came
[44:49] from the East and they went to Jerusalem
[44:51] looking for the king that's why they
[44:53] went
[44:54] there they went to Jerusalem because it
[44:57] made sense that the King of Kings would
[45:00] be where the king should be amen but if
[45:03] they'd have known what God had hid in
[45:05] the
[45:06] scriptures they would have gone because
[45:09] they had to go and look they had to go
[45:10] and look they said well this isn't
[45:12] working out Herod doesn't know where
[45:14] these guys are they ask the scribes and
[45:15] the Pharisees they said well where's the
[45:17] king supposed to be born at and they had
[45:19] to go
[45:21] look amen praise the Lord
[45:24] amen out of Bethlehem shall he come they
[45:27] were looking in Jerusalem they were
[45:29] looking for him in the big Shiloh they
[45:31] were looking everywhere but he come from
[45:33] Bethlehem cuz it was the house of God's
[45:36] bread it was God's Bread Basket to the
[45:39] world amen
[45:42] amen and there he was born in Bethlehem
[45:46] he could not be born anywhere else and
[45:50] brother renom said another great event
[45:52] that I shouldn't ever forget to call he
[45:55] says when David was anointed King then
[45:58] everybody turned against him when he was
[46:01] anointed king he his brothers rejected
[46:05] him and then he was called up you know
[46:08] because he went and he killed
[46:09] Goliath and then that caused more
[46:12] problems and then he was called up and
[46:16] he'd sit in Saul's in the chamber in in
[46:20] Saul's Palace and Saul was the king and
[46:23] sometimes anger would get on Saul he get
[46:25] all upset and everything else and David
[46:27] would come in and he'd start to play and
[46:30] sing praises unto the Lord and the evil
[46:32] spirit would leave Saul but even Saul
[46:35] turned against David amen and when David
[46:39] fled the face of Saul and all of his
[46:41] Brethren and he was out in the
[46:45] wilderness the Philistines were looking
[46:47] for him Israel was looking for him there
[46:50] was they were all against him and David
[46:54] sitting in a in a cave the king the guy
[46:59] who had been anointed to be king hiding
[47:01] in a
[47:02] cave and he sat there and he said oh he
[47:06] said it's so hot here things are so bad
[47:09] here I wish I could have a drink of cold
[47:13] water from the well that's by the
[47:19] gate where's it
[47:21] at in Bethlehem
[47:27] yes not gilgal not Shiloh not
[47:31] Jerusalem the well the water was in at
[47:37] Bethlehem brother Ram said he said
[47:40] so David at his worst time he was a

[51:38] those books are small and Micah 5 verse
[51:45] two there's a
[51:47] prophecy it says but thou Bethlehem

[52:45] Bethlehem it cradled him brother the
[52:49] place he wants to be cradled today is in
[52:51] your
[52:52] heart that he might display from you the
[52:55] Waters of life to a perishing people
[52:58] when you go out in the stores and you're
[53:01] walking along you need to be the Water
[53:04] of

[53:18] whatever just be that well be that well
[53:22] of Life The Water of Life to a Dying
[53:25] World amen
[53:27] why Bethlehem because God saw that he
[53:31] could hide so many things in Bethlehem
[53:34] and keep them for us that we' see that
[53:37] the word of God is it's a living
[53:39] breathing thing it's always
[53:43] unfolding when the word gets dead and
[53:46] you can no longer see it unfolding
[53:48] brother you better get back to the well
[53:51] cuz you're you're getting ready to pass
[53:53] out
[53:55] amen praise God
[53:58] Amen so let's go to Luke Chapter
[54:03] 2
[54:05] amen and it came to pass in those
[54:09] days that there went out a decree from
[54:12] Caesar Augustus that all the world
[54:15] should be taxed and this taxing was
[54:18] first made from
[54:20] Sirius who was governor of
[54:22] Syria and all went to be taxed everyone
[54:26] to to his own
[54:27] City think about it what if you had to
[54:31] go pay your income taxes but you got to
[54:33] do it at the federal courthouse in the
[54:36] city where you were
[54:39] born now where else in the city where
[54:42] you were
[54:45] born and Joseph also went up From
[54:50] Galilee out of the city of
[54:53] Nazareth because Joseph Mary
[54:56] they were lineage and their lineage went
[55:00] back to
[55:01] Bethlehem and God was not going to allow
[55:04] them to have Christ anywhere
[55:08] else but where God had pre-planned it
[55:12] before the foundation of the world so no
[55:15] matter what you think no matter what you
[55:18] got planned out if you're part of the
[55:21] word of God he will take you by the
[55:24] nose and drag you right to where you
[55:27] need to
[55:28] be that his word will not fall to the
[55:32] ground amen amen and Joseph also went up
[55:37] From Galilee out of the city of Nazareth
[55:40] unto Judea under the city of David which
[55:43] is called Bethlehem because he was of
[55:46] the house and lineage of David to be
[55:49] taxed with Mary his espoused wife being
[55:53] great with child it seemed like seemed
[55:54] like you know brother Bram talked
[55:56] about
[55:58] Moses coming across he says Moses showed
[56:02] all these great signs and wonders and
[56:05] miracles and the children of Israel the
[56:08] Pharaoh and they they get said get out
[56:11] of here take take your cattle your sheep
[56:13] your children go go get out out and then
[56:16] as soon as they got out it changed his
[56:18] mind and then when they went across it
[56:21] seemed like they would look for a fairy
[56:24] or a good way but God took them right to
[56:27] the Red Sea and he took them to a
[56:30] particular place where there was a city
[56:32] to the north and a city to the South and
[56:34] there was no way to go back there was
[56:36] only one way to go and that was forward
[56:39] brother sister I'm telling you if the
[56:41] word of God did that for Moses God will
[56:44] do the same thing for us amen took them
[56:48] right to the edge of the Red Sea and
[56:51] they said oh L this isn't working out
[56:59] and they just looked in the
[57:01] word and God said Moses he said' what
[57:04] are you crying about I look I did this
[57:06] for you I did this for you I did this
[57:07] for you did this for you did this for
[57:08] you this for you you got the point
[57:11] now count your blessings name them one
[57:14] by one count your many blessings see
[57:17] what God hath done because let me tell
[57:21] you we can't do
[57:24] anything we can't every gift we have God
[57:28] gave every house he gave we have God
[57:31] gave our jobs our food our health
[57:35] everything we have is it's in his hands
[57:38] amen amen praise the Lord
[57:42] amen so it looked like the worst time of
[57:44] the year it looked it looked
[57:48] terrible Joseph probably came home from
[57:50] work from the carpenter shop and said
[57:54] what I got to go pay the to taxes where
[57:57] I was
[57:59] born and about that time Mary goes oh
[58:03] you know I don't know if I know most of
[58:05] us are parents you know what Braxton
[58:07] Hicks is that's false labor pains and
[58:11] she had a p fa uh labor pain and she
[58:13] said Joseph she said I don't think this
[58:15] is the time to go but you know you can't
[58:18] kick against the
[58:20] Pricks you
[58:22] can't so God made a way for them
[58:26] they got a
[58:28] donkey got his wife who was large with
[58:31] child he took her down they traveled
[58:35] from Nazareth all the way down to the
[58:37] city of David
[58:39] Bethlehem they got down there now you
[58:43] would think that God in his great wisdom
[58:45] because W this is the king of kings he
[58:49] should be born in a palace maybe the
[58:51] Sheridan F star man and the be the best
[58:54] Hilton and when they got to Bethlehem
[58:58] the city was in an
[58:59] uproar and all the hotels were
[59:03] booked and it looked
[59:06] crazy it looked
[59:08] horrible but they finally found somebody
[59:11] who would listen to say look I got to
[59:13] have a place to stay my wife is praying
[59:14] it and they said well guess what we got
[59:16] this little stable over here and we got
[59:20] this feed trough that we normally feed
[59:23] the sheep out of you can use that as a c
[59:26] ad and then because he's the Lamb of God
[59:30] and also the red bulock an
[59:35] ox you can take swaddling cloth off of
[59:38] the Y the yolk of a ox and put that in
[59:42] the Sheep trough and there you can put
[59:46] your baby and hopefully everything will
[59:49] work out for
[59:50] you and when the baby was born the
[59:53] Shepherds went or the the angel angels
[59:56] went nuts and started singing Glory to
[59:59] God in the highest and where were they
[1:00:02] at they weren't down at the church they
[1:00:04] were up on the Mountaintop over here
[1:00:06] where the Shepherds were and they told
[1:00:09] the Shepherds guess what the Lamb of God
[1:00:12] is on the face of the Earth and they
[1:00:14] said this is where you find him amen the
[1:00:17] god of Heaven in
[1:00:20] Bethlehem why
[1:00:21] Bethlehem because it was God's plan was
[1:00:26] God's choice and it was so that while
[1:00:30] they were there the days were
[1:00:32] accomplished that she should be
[1:00:34] delivered and she brought forth her
[1:00:36] firstborn son and wrapped him in
[1:00:38] swaddling clothes and laid him in a
[1:00:41] Manger because there was no room for
[1:00:44] them in the End
[1:00:46] Amen and there were in the same country
[1:00:49] shepherds abiding in the field keeping
[1:00:51] watch over their flocks by night and lo
[1:00:55] the angel of the Lord Came Upon them and
[1:00:57] the glory of the Lord showed round about
[1:00:59] them and they were soore afraid and the
[1:01:01] angel said unto them fear not for behold
[1:01:04] I bring you good to Tidings of great joy
[1:01:09] which shall be to all people for unto
[1:01:11] you is Born This Day in the city of
[1:01:14] David a
[1:01:16] savior a savior praise God which is
[1:01:20] Christ the lord and this shall be a sign
[1:01:22] unto you you shall find the Babe wrapped
[1:01:25] in SW swaddling cloth lying in a manger
[1:01:28] and suddenly there with the angel a
[1:01:30] multitude of the Heavenly hosts praising
[1:01:33] God and saying glory to God in the
[1:01:36] highest and on Earth peace and Good Will
[1:01:39] toward
[1:01:40] men amen and it came to pass as the
[1:01:44] Angels were gone away from them into
[1:01:46] heaven the shepherd said one unto
[1:01:48] another let us now go even unto
[1:01:50] Bethlehem and see this thing which has
[1:01:53] come to pass which the Lord hath made
[1:01:55] known known unto us I don't know maybe
[1:01:58] there was two or 300,000 people
[1:02:01] there but God revealed himself to
[1:02:05] probably six
[1:02:07] Shepherds I don't know if you've been to
[1:02:09] a football game lately big crowds think
[1:02:13] of that six guys in that whole stadium
[1:02:17] know that God just came on the face of
[1:02:20] the Earth everybody else is all worried
[1:02:22] about paying
[1:02:24] taxes cuz that's why they were there
[1:02:26] they were there to pay their taxes and
[1:02:28] all the hustle and bustle and the noise
[1:02:30] and everything else but these sick
[1:02:32] Shepherds came down and they came in the
[1:02:34] world didn't care about them because
[1:02:36] they were insignificant but God sent
[1:02:39] angels to them you're insignificant but
[1:02:42] God has sent angels to you God has sent
[1:02:46] angels to you amen and they came with
[1:02:49] haste and they
[1:02:51] found Mary and Joseph and the Babe lying
[1:02:54] in a manger and when when they had seen
[1:02:56] it they made known abroad the saying
[1:02:59] which had been told them concerning the
[1:03:01] child and all they that heard it
[1:03:04] wondered at those things which were told
[1:03:07] them by the Shepherds now why didn't
[1:03:08] they go look and see if it was true or
[1:03:12] not because they weren't
[1:03:15] called they weren't called you don't
[1:03:18] know how blessed you
[1:03:20] are say oh you know God sent a prophet H
[1:03:24] I'll think about it
[1:03:27] you know God is doing
[1:03:29] this that's something to think about
[1:03:31] maybe I'll think about that
[1:03:34] too but see the Shepherds God sent an
[1:03:38] angel to
[1:03:40] them God picked us up out of the myy
[1:03:43] clay he picked us up because he saw a
[1:03:46] value in
[1:03:47] you that the world doesn't even see the
[1:03:50] world doesn't see any value in US amen
[1:03:56] but Mary kept all these things and
[1:03:59] pondered them in her heart and the
[1:04:01] Shepherds returned glorifying and
[1:04:03] praising God for all the things that
[1:04:06] they had heard and seen as it was told
[1:04:09] unto them praise the Lord
[1:04:12] amen
