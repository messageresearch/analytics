Teach me Lord. Teach me Lord to wait. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're we we're all in a hurry. We just need to slow down. Amen. If you'll turn with me this evening um to Genesis chapter 1. I want to read a couple of scriptures here. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Genesis chapter 1 verse 26. And God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness, and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth." So God created man in his own image, and the image of God created he him. Male and female created he them. I'd like you to turn to St. John 14. St. John 14 verse 19 and 20. It says, "Yet a little while and the world seeth me no more, but you see me because I live, ye shall live also. At that day you shall know that I am in my father and ye in me and I in you." &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads. Dear Lord Jesus, we're grateful, Father, Lord, for all the things that you've given to us. Heavenly Father, we're thankful for a place to worship you and the abilities, Father, to pay the bills, Lord, and and put food on the table and have a house to live in. But Lord, more than that, we desire to have you living in our hearts. We just pray that you'll be merciful to us tonight. That you just come and break the bread of life. Forgive us of our sins and our shortcomings. Cleanse us of our unrighteousness, Lord. And may you just come and walk with us. Lord, we just ask you to we just invite your presence in Jesus Christ's name we ask it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated. Amen. So I'd like to speak for a little while about oneness. &gt;&gt; So the word oneness means to be one with oneness or united. So now the first man and the first woman in the garden of Eden was in perfect harmony with God so much that God could come down at any time he desired and talk lip to ear with Adam and Eve. &gt;&gt; And that's perfect oneness. And the thing that I thought was so interesting about that when I read that quote was that God came down and spoke to Adam and Eve lip to ear. It wasn't Adam and Eve chasing after God and said, "Hey, will you talk to me?" &gt;&gt; He came down because they were in oneness. &gt;&gt; He came down anytime that he wanted to, anytime he desired to talk lip to ear to Adam and Eve. And that is perfect oneness. God and his creation. God speaking lipto ear with Adam and Eve. And they were so perfect in harmony with God till there was they were one with God. God and his family was one. Amen. And any man and his family, a correct, good, noble, obedient family is one with one another. Any family. And if there's something in that family that moves them apart, well then you know there's something wrong. The family's broken somewhere. They should all be one. Father with mother, mother with father, children with a parent, parents with the children, all in agreement. And when you see that, you'll see one lovely picture. And that is God's purpose. And his purpose as father supreme was to be one with his family, his earthly family, Adam and Eve. And the only way that that could be done, one with his family or with God, was because God's nature was in them. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that made them with God's nature in them. Then with each other and God, they become all one. And isn't that a beautiful picture? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God and his family, father overall, supreme. No death, no sorrow, no heartache, no nothing. Just joy unspeakable. Never to be sick, never to have a heartache, just one with God. And what a picture. Because the very nature of God was in these people. And therefore what they did, they followed just in line with God and God was with them and that made them one. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you turn over to Genesis or to St. John 17 &gt;&gt; and read verse 8 to 11, it says, "For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me, and they have received them, and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou did send me. I pray for them. I pray not for the world, but for them which thou has given me. For they are thine, and all mine are thine, and thine are mine, and I am glorified in them. And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee, holy father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one as we are. &gt;&gt; And that is God's purpose. His purpose is nothing else but that he might be one with his creation. Jesus prayed that the church and he would be one like he and the father was one. That the church, we are members of the body of Christ. We would be one together just like he and the father are one. And at that day we would know that he was in the father, the father was in him and he is in us. That together we are one. And what a union, a oneness that would be to see God in his church till every member is just perfectly in harmony with each other and God. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the church that Jesus is coming for. &gt;&gt; That's what is prayer. That's when it'll be answered and we will be one. And it is the only grounds of fellowship that God has ever laid down for himself and his church is the oneness of himself and his people. Everything that Jesus did, he always pointed to his oneness with his father. &gt;&gt; He said, "I can't even move. I can't do anything until I see the father move me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I came in my father's name and you don't even receive me. But he said, I that oneness that I have, I want to share it with my creation. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what he wants. the oneness of himself and his people. And that's the only grounds of fellowship. That's the only way that you can have those grounds is by a union to be united with him forever. Not just for a week or a couple of days. You know, people sometimes they come to church and they they get all enthused. They come to the altar and they repent and everything else, but they never stay long enough to get born again. &gt;&gt; They never stay long enough to become one with God. And the first thing that happens then they're back out doing the same things that they always did. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, he said, "So just like when you unite with your husband, the woman to unite with her husband, it is a vow unto death." Now then when you unite with God, it's the same thing that the church united with Christ. It's until death we part. And then if you never sin or do anything wrong, you'll be eternally united with God. And only death can take you away from God. And not physical death, but the sin of death. Sin is death. And that will take you away from God. So to be united with him in the spirit of his power, that is eternal life. And you're eternally united with him. And I want to get that to you. United eternally with the eternal God. Perfectly in harmony with him. perfectly united together. A church that is both God and his church is one united together. So if you notice how that Eve was united with Adam, she became a part of him. God, did you notice in Genesis 1:27, which is where we started? Amen. And if we go back there and you and you bring that scripture back up, he said, "So God created man in his own image. In the image of God created he him male and female created he them." Amen. &gt;&gt; He created him. Man, male and female created him. So the man was both male and female when he come to the earth being in the spirit of feminist and masculine. Then God took from his side a rib. So, did you notice the body part was a byproduct, right? &gt;&gt; But not the spirit. &gt;&gt; Not the spirit. The body part of the woman was a byproduct. After the creation had been finished, God took from the side of Adam and a rib and made a woman, but not the spirit. The spirit was part of Adam, for he was both man and woman, spiritually speaking, both masculine and feminist. So if you look over in in Hebrews 10, praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We just got to get the fire a little burning here a little bit. In verse 5 in Hebrews 10, Paul writing about this oneness relationship with God. He said, "Wherefore, when he cometh into the world, he saith, sacrifice and offerings thou wouldest not." It is not that I can come and sing better than anybody else or what kind of offerings I can have, but he said, "A body thou hast prepared for me." &gt;&gt; Amen. That is where oneness becomes. Amen. And then if you go to Ephesians 5. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. In Ephesians 5, it says this verse 30. It says, "For we are members of his body, of his flesh and of his bones, not a byproduct, &gt;&gt; but part of that glorified body." &gt;&gt; Because Jesus's body was not born of sexual desire like yours and mine is. &gt;&gt; Yours and mine, we are we're our body which is a byproduct. It's not part of the original creation. &gt;&gt; It's not. &gt;&gt; It was. The only reason that we're here and we live in the house that we live in is because two people came together with a desire that they loved one another and through their union, you came into being. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So he says, "But we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones." And he says, "For this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall be joined unto his wife, and the two shall become one flesh." Amen. And this is a great mystery. But I speak concerning Christ and the church. So now, Brother Brandham said, "So, don't you see this great picture? We in flesh are different. We are like a byproduct, a created being by holy wedlock. but in the spirit. If we're born again of the spirit of God, then are we sons and daughters of the great God of heaven. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we return back to that same oneness that Jesus had if we yield ourselves to that Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Look at 1 Corinthians 12. Praise the Lord. Amen. That's why it's so important. People just miss the whole significance of being born again. But if you're never born again, you'll know why. You can't you you it's just a book. &gt;&gt; It will always just be a book. &gt;&gt; It will always just be dos and don'ts. It'll always just be a striving to become better. And brother Benham said, he said, "We're not reformers. We're not trying to reform people. We're trying to get people to be find out who they originally were at the beginning. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 12 verse 12 says, he says, "For as the body is one and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many are one body, so also is Christ. For by one spirit are we all baptized into this body, not this flesh, because this flesh is corruption. Amen. Whether we are Jew or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free, and have been all made to drink into one spirit. Amen. We are in his likeness, in his unity, in the perfect image of the living God. Because we became sons and daughters, not separated, but the same spirit, the same God, the same person joined in wedlock to the eternal. Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the cornerstone of the Christian walk. Oneness. &gt;&gt; Oneness. We have to be one with our heavenly father. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God, the same person joined in holy wedlock to the eternal. See how God planned it that we should not be a different but him. Not some other being of some other tribe but a real union and offspring of the almighty done by a holy union. And the body comes our body comes from our mother and father. Our union. That's how we came here. But if you're born again of the spirit of God, that spirit that's inside of you came from God and it's going back to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't but the spirit come from God and God separating himself as Adam was separated. So we want to remember that &gt;&gt; because so if we go back to St. John 14 I want you to notice in St. John 14 verse 19 and 20 he says yet a little while and the world seeth me no more so when he gave this statement the world saw him but they only saw the body the outward they didn't see Jesus told Nicodemus Nicodemus said how can I be born again he said shall I climb back up in my mother's womb and and and come back out he says And he and Jesus told him, he said, "You being a teacher," and he said, "You don't even understand the first parts of the moving of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; You you're not even getting past first base." &gt;&gt; He says, "Because here I am." He says, "I'm standing right here in front of you, but yet I'm still I'm in a heavenly place." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Looking at my father. Amen. So in verse 19, he says, "Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more." So in verse 19, the world was seeing him, but you see me, but the disciples didn't really see him. &gt;&gt; They just saw the body. &gt;&gt; Philip asked him that one time. He said, "Oh, Jesus." He says, "Please show us the father." &gt;&gt; And Jesus looked at him and said, "You're just looking at the body &gt;&gt; because there's a oneness here." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a oneness that's that you haven't even gotten to yet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you haven't been to the upper room. you haven't been born again and your eyes are. He says, "Have I been so long with you that you don't even know me?" I wonder how much of the church is like that &gt;&gt; that they've been so long following after God and they don't even know him. &gt;&gt; But the real union that brother Renham talked about, he said in the garden, the real union was God could come down to his creation and speak to them whenever he wanted to. It wasn't them chasing after him and saying, "Lord, speak to us. Speak to us. Speak to us." God moved on his face of the earth. &gt;&gt; God moved on his creation. The father came and spoke to Jesus. And Jesus knew enough to wait till the father moved before he did anything &gt;&gt; because everything that he did glorified God, not himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. So we see in chapter 14 he says yet a little while and the world will see me no more. But if you look over at chapter 17 and you look at verse 11, he says, "And now I am no more in the world." &gt;&gt; Where physically he was in the garden fellowshipping with the spirit, &gt;&gt; but he was getting ready. He was now no longer in the world. But you, all of us, we are still in the world. And because of that, I come to the Holy Father. And he said, "Keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me that they may be one &gt;&gt; as we are one." &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brennham said, he said, "So ye in me, I in you, that they might be one, the Father, even as you and I are one, God and Christ, Christ in the church, just as we are one." So they should be one. Then how can you be one? That's the question tonight. People are always wondering, "How can I be a better Christian? How can I do this?" Be one with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then the question's answered. &gt;&gt; Then the rest is it's a rest. It's no longer a struggle if you get the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; He said, "Because if you abide in me and my words abide in you, see, abide, my word in you, then ask what you will, for it isn't you anymore. It's the word that's in you, and that word is God." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, if you flip back to St. John 14 again and we started well let's just look at verse 20 he says so at that day what day when I'm no longer in the world right now I'm in the world but there's coming a time when I won't be in the world and in that day that's the time when you will know that I am in my father and you are in me and I am in you. &gt;&gt; And that's the whole problem &gt;&gt; because we've not become one with our heavenly father. &gt;&gt; We got too much of ourselves stuck in the picture. &gt;&gt; Too much of our own ideas, too much of our we we're not because look at what verse 21 says. He that hath my commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me. And verse 21 is going right back to St. John 1:1 In the beginning was the word and the word was God and the word was with God and then the word came down and became manifest and walked amongst us. We could hold him. And those are the same commandments that Jesus is talking about here in verse 21. He said, 'If you can become that, he it is that loveth me, and he that loveth me shall be love to my father, and I will love him and will manifest myself to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Adam was a part or Eve was a part of Adam. She was flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone. And the difference with Adam and Eve was that Adam was a created being from God. Amen. &gt;&gt; His body was not created by the union of beast. &gt;&gt; It was created by God himself. God brought the the the pod ash and and all of the chemicals together and the dust and the and everything and he brought it together. God created that body. That's not so with yours. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's not so with mine. And when he brought them together and then when he took the rib out of Adam and he created Eve, she was the same thing. She might have been a byproduct, but she was not a a an attribute of a union between two people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. She was flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone. And that's what the correct union is. And that's what the correct union of the church is. Spirit of his spirit, word of his word, never deviating from the word. The real true believer will not compromise on any word. Why? A real true believer can't compromise on the real word. &gt;&gt; Jesus couldn't compromise on the word. &gt;&gt; Satan told him, he said, "Hey, if you're if you're, you know, okay, you could be God, you you could be the son of God, but if you're God, then you have creative power. turn these stones into bread. You're hungry. How many times have you thought of that? Well, I'm sick. I'll pray and God will give me a miracle and it didn't happen. And other times, I need this and you pray and it didn't happen. But if the spirit of God comes down and directs you to pray, it'll happen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It'll happen every time. Amen. So he says never deviating from the word. The real true believer will never compromise on the word. Remember it was just one word that Eve compromised on. But the true believer, he won't compromise on any word. It'll hold the sword of faith rather the sword of the word and claim every divine promise God made. &gt;&gt; Amen. And they were God's examples to us what we should be. And them ever present, never failing. When they spoke, God answered. He watched them daily night. When they'd lay down to sleep, he watched over them. In the daytime, he guided them. He fed them. He loved them. He communed with them constantly all the time. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. When you leave this world and this worldly nature and you're born again of the spirit of God, God will do all those things for you. &gt;&gt; I remember when I gave when I surrendered to him, he took the swearing away. I didn't even ask him to. &gt;&gt; I just said, "I want whatever you whatever it is, give it to me." &gt;&gt; Amen. One time I was working, I was I used to be a truck mechanic and work on these great big trucks and and they'd break the axles and we'd have to cut the the bolts off with a setylene torch and then beat the and then changed it and and I'm underneath this truck and I had cut the bolt off and I had this big drift and a 10 pound hammer and I went bam right on my thumb and I'm and my my buddies, "Come on, Bruce. Let it out." I said, "What do you want?" They go, "We know you want to swear." I said, "There's no swearing in here. &gt;&gt; You cannot manufacture that." &gt;&gt; And if you have to manufacture that, maybe you need to find out what it is you think you got. &gt;&gt; Because it will take that away. &gt;&gt; It will. &gt;&gt; It will. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. It will take and you praise the Lord. So we can be in God united because Adam and Eve was before the fall before the disbelieving of the word was an example of what we could be to him to be united with him is life. To be separated from him is death. And now we must follow his commandments. So let's go back to St. John 17 again. So in St. John 17, he's no longer Jesus is identifying himself that he's no longer in the world. He's moved on. I'm no more in the world. But in verse 20, he says, "Neither pray I for these alone," which was his 12 disciples and those that they had influence over. He said, "Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word." So what are you doubting? &gt;&gt; That's you. &gt;&gt; Amen. because we believe because we heard the report from the disciples that actually were eyewitnesses. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, he said that they all may be one as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us, that the world may believe that thou hast sent me. And the glory which thou gavest me, I have given them that they may be one even as we are one. I in them, thou and me, that they be may made perfect in one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You cannot be made perfect until you're in one unity with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Without that oneness, you're just I don't know what you're doing. That's what God wants. He wants us to be one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. All of those quotes are out of the message oneness. But in the oddball, brother Brandon brings out this other example that I want to spend some time on. He says, "I am likening God so that you won't be mixed up in what I've said today. God is a great diamond, the eternal. And when a diamond is brought out of the blue stones of Africa, I've been in the mines and watched them in the great how they process this and get the diamonds out and how they go through the crusher and the great blue fire diamonds, black diamonds, they come out. They have not much form, certain form. They're just a great stone and really they have no fire in them at that time because it's hid. They're just a diamond, a stone around smoothed out a lot of them. But this diamond, it must be cut. Now, it's against the law to have one not being cut. It must be cut and then you have to have a receipt where you bought it because there is millions of dollars in them. And I'm liken God to that diamond. So in the beginning, before the world was ever formed, there was God. &gt;&gt; There was Elohim. And if you think of him, just think of it like a basketball or a soccer ball. Brother Brandham said it was just a stone. And when you looked at the outside of that stone, you could not see what was inside of it. because it had never been cut. And God takes his word and cuts. And when God said, "Let there be light," there was a chip happened on that stone. And out came a little chip called the logos. Amen. &gt;&gt; And now when the light that was inside the master diamond reflected off of that, then the seven colors could come out of it &gt;&gt; and it could start to dis to display the attributes that were hidden in the diamond because the diamond it does it just looks like a rock. It doesn't look like it's much of anything. So, brother Brandham said, "So, a diamond is cut." So it will it will reflect what's on the inside of it. The fire that's in the diamond. And it has to be cut and to every little way, every little shape. Three points. Put the three points to a diamond and put a light against that three-point object. It will give seven colors. See, it'll make them seven colors. When God created Adam in in Genesis 1 verse 26 and 27, he said, "Let us make God in our image." And God chipped the diamond and off came Adam. His spirit was the same spirit as God's. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then as that diamond was chipped, different attributes of the creative power of God could be displayed. &gt;&gt; But the light came from inside the diamond. Amen. &gt;&gt; Those little chips couldn't display anything until the light reflected on them. &gt;&gt; And every one of those little chips has to be chipped again and molded so that they can reflect the light that's coming from God. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, Adam and Eve, when they had the true oneness, the light of God could come down and talk to them, lift to ear, and they reflected everything that God was. If they didn't like the way the wind was blowing, Adam could say, "Wind, stop. It's blowing a little bit too fast. I just want a simple breeze. if it's if it's too dry, I need a little bit of rain. He'd call for that. If he didn't like where a tree was, he could. And all of those things did not reflect what Adam was. &gt;&gt; It reflected what God was. &gt;&gt; Because it was oneness. &gt;&gt; It was oneness. So he says, so brother Benham said, so notice God was wounded for our transgression, bruised for our iniquity. See, he was cut and bruised. That great diamond that from him might be reflect the gifts to the church. So, if you think about it, you've got this rock that has all these attributes inside of it and it gets chipped and the logos comes out and then it gets chipped again and the world comes into existence and the logos broods over that and life comes out of there. Those seeds, everything that was in there was already in the master diamond when it was chipped off. All those seeds, all those attributes, all those things, all the look all the animals. God created all the animals. Brother Adam Bradom said, "Oh, he started with a tadpole and then he went to this one and he went to that one and then he went to the fish, then he went to and all these things." So God created all those things. You believe that? &gt;&gt; But we didn't know what they were. &gt;&gt; They're just things that God created. But God brought them to somebody who was one with him. &gt;&gt; He brought them to Adam and he said, "Adam, what is that?" And he said, "Well, that's a rainbow trout." &gt;&gt; And God didn't argue with him. God said, "You're right. That's what a rainbow trout is." And when he saw an elephant, he said, "Adam, what is that?" And Adam said, "That's an elephant." Because it has the attributes of an elephant. and it has a long nose on it and it's big. It has big legs and things like that. It's not a cat. Doesn't have hair on it. And never one time in the book of Genesis does God ever argue with Adam &gt;&gt; because they were one. Jesus when he finally came, the problem that God saw is that he kept trying to reflect his word on fallen flesh till there came a time when he had to chip off his own diamond again and create a body that was not born of desire because it wasn't our desire that asked for him to come. &gt;&gt; Amen. Who, which one of you was, you know, when you were four or five said, "Oh, you know, I think I need a savior." &gt;&gt; God came of his own accord &gt;&gt; and he made a body that was likened unto ours, but it wasn't sinful flesh. &gt;&gt; It wasn't. And then he was able to bruise that body. And in the bruising of that body, make a a way back for the believer &gt;&gt; to be one with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But where'd the spirit come from? From the diamond before the world began. &gt;&gt; God kept chipping off. And that was you. And it was chipping off. And that was you. And that was you, Brother Beckman. Chipped off. Not Not after when your parents came together and you were born on your birthday. You were chipped off before the foundation of the world. And that chip followed you until the day of God's reckoning when he called and you answered. &gt;&gt; And that's what Psalm says. &gt;&gt; When he calls, I will answer. &gt;&gt; When he called, I'll answer. And God, because he called me, I am one with him because I came from him. It's not a different chip. It's not us bringing something to God and saying, "But it's God that chipped. &gt;&gt; He chipped. He chipped it again. He chipped it again." And you look at your life. Your life was a mess. You tried to your best to be good. You tried your best to be whatever best is. And you kept failing and everything else. But one day, God called. And when he filled you with his spirit, then the word of God could it quit being a letter and it became life. &gt;&gt; It became a part of you. So much so that you don't even have to think about it. &gt;&gt; I have the attributes of my father. In fact, I look at him every morning when I get up in the and look in the mirror. I go, "Oh, there's dad." I don't look like brother John because there's no connection physically between me and brother John. There's no connection. But you look in the mirror and you'll see a connection with your family, with your your earthly union. But that's not one. That's not oneness with God. &gt;&gt; Oneness with God is when God steps down behind the veil &gt;&gt; and starts living through you. Not of your own intellect or your own idea, but he starts living that word which was born in you from the beginning. Amen. &gt;&gt; Which makes one. Amen. It isn't. He says that great diamond that from him might reflect the gifts to the church. And it isn't the light because the light must return back when the sun is off of it to where it has been cut from. But every little piece that comes from the chipping is not destroyed. It's put to use. You know, people today, they they're all afraid. People are afraid they're going to miss it. They're afraid that God's going to somehow reject this. Brother Brandham gives a great example. I love it. He said, 'When you have a diamond, a rock, and you take it and you start chipping away at it, every little piece they keep. &gt;&gt; Every little piece. And then they chip them again and they chip them again. And he and back in the 60s when he preached this, he said they take the smallest little chip and he says they put it on the end of a needle &gt;&gt; and they put it on a record &gt;&gt; and it brings out hidden music &gt;&gt; because when you buy a record and nobody knows what a record is anymore &gt;&gt; because you're going to see see the record has music but you have to have a dime. time in order to play the record, &gt;&gt; in order to see the hidden mystery that's hid in that piece of plastic. &gt;&gt; You can't. And brother Brennham said, he said, "God chipped you off of him. You're a chip." &gt;&gt; Amen. And one day he takes you and he takes his chip which is Jesus Christ and he places that Jesus Christ down on you and he says and the attributes of the record can now be heard. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if you know anything about technology, I'll tell you how far off we are because we went from records that were played by diamonds. We went to CDs. CDs are played by light. There is nothing touching the record, but a light touches it. And the light is able to bring the music out. But after we had CDs for a while, we switched everything to digital. And when everything went digital, you talk to a real person that knows something about this piano. If I had a guitar, I could show you on a guitar. This piano has a hammer in it, which is just like God. That hammer is hitting a wire. And when it hits that wire, that wire vibrates. &gt;&gt; And when that wire vibrates, it makes a sound. &gt;&gt; But when a digital piano, which sounds like a piano, there's no vibration. &gt;&gt; There's no life. &gt;&gt; There's no life. Oh, it sounds like a piano. But the life, the life in a violin is the bow making the wire vibrate. The life in the church, the oneness in the church is the Holy Spirit moving on you and causing you to vibrate. &gt;&gt; And it makes the sound of God. It makes the life of God become manifest because oneness is what we're looking for. &gt;&gt; I'm not looking to become brother John. I'm not trying to become brother Brandham. I want to become who I was before the foundation of the world when I was with him. When he chipped me off. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. You see, we've gotten so far off, we don't even we Nobody wants DVDs. Nobody wants Blu-ray discs. Nobody wants records. Now, there there's a revival right now. People are looking for vinyl &gt;&gt; because they're trying to go back to feel that vibration. But see, they can't. They can't. You can't do it with a iPhone playlist. You can't do it. It's just it's not the same. &gt;&gt; It's not the same. The church, the reason God sent a prophet, the reason he fulfilled Malachi 4, all of it was to get you to vibrate when the spirit moved across your heart &gt;&gt; to bring you back to where you were. When God asked Job, he says, "Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth?" &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And Job is wise enough to say nothing because God was rebuking him. &gt;&gt; He said, Job, he says, you're talking about things you don't know anything about. He says, but you know, I did create all this stuff. I put the stars in the place. I did all I I lift up who I lift up. I put down who I put down. I am the God of the heaven and earth. Amen. I am the one that you should be reflecting. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what we want to reflect. We don't want to reflect just another church group or another &gt;&gt; church believer. I mean, &gt;&gt; because they're all digital. You'll find out. You go, you're going to be, "Oh, yes, I'm a Christian. Oh, yeah. Yes, I read the Bible. Oh, really? Good. There's no vibration." You ask him about it, they go, "Oh, no. Well, it doesn't really mean that." I worked with a guy one time. He told me, he said, he said, "Bruce, you know, because I'm kind of weird, everybody see when when you when you're a chip off the block, you are unusual &gt;&gt; and you can't be usual because God's unusual &gt;&gt; and you walk in someplace and they all know you're unusual." &gt;&gt; And I had a man, he come, he told me, he says, he goes, "I got to be a reader in church." I said, "Oh, wow. That's great. That's a great honor." I said, "What? what is that? And he says, "Well, it's Lent." And he says, "I'm a Catholic." And he says, "I get to get up and read the scriptures in the mass." And I said, "That's a very honorable thing. That's that's wonderful." And he was I was all he was really excited about it till he got hurt. And then he started using all kinds of language. And I looked at him. I said, "Is that your Lenton language?" Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that the language you know people ask they say, "Well, Bruce, what are you giving?" I I gave up everything for Lent and I'm not going back to it &gt;&gt; because there's something inside vibrating. When the word of God strikes, when the spirit of God strikes, there has to be a vibration. &gt;&gt; Amen. It can't be just a dead &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; I remember taking my grandson. We we went to a car show and this guy had this car and and he had Guitar Hero. You know Guitar Hero? Oh yeah. That's not real guitar playing. I don't know if you know that. That's just pushing buttons and following colors. I'm really good at Simon says. You ever seen Simon? That's the age I'm from. We we were handing around Simon with my brother-in-law and and they were they were listening to the tune or they were watching the flashing of the lights for the order because you know it starts up with one and then that start they were watching and I was listening to the tune because I have that gift. So as long as I could hear the tune I could I could follow the tune and I'd always win. You see? But that's not playing music. That's not playing. That's That's not That's Pick up a guitar. There's a It You have to strike the string. &gt;&gt; God has to strike our hearts. &gt;&gt; God has to bring a vibration in us. &gt;&gt; And then the word of God will become alive. It's too dead. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we've never had him prick us. Amen. Amen. I hope you see what I mean. the chip from Christ, the gift from Christ, you put it upon the Bible and it'll speak out hidden mysteries of God to the believer. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. When I read this the Bible and the spirit of God is there, all of a sudden I start seeing things &gt;&gt; because it starts to vibrate. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "Praise the Lord. You put it upon the Bible, it'll speak out hidden mysteries of God to the believer. He knows the secrets of your heart. He knows every person. Do you believe that? And it won't be the diamond saying, "You see what I am?" He'll be saying where he came from. The diamond is a diamond because he's off of a diamond. &gt;&gt; There is never a diamond. And I got a couple of diamonds on my ring, but they're not they're just a little chip off the big diamond somewhere. &gt;&gt; This evening, you have to be a chip off of the big diamond. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, Brother Brandham says, he says in the audible, he says, "Now, you see a pen, you could get a pen, but it won't play the record. A regular sewing needle won't play the record." Praise the Lord. I don't know if you know what on a phongraph, this is really old, but on a phonograph, the diamond is on the end of the needle and the needle goes up and there's two magnets and it vibrates between the magnets to make the sound. There's a vibration. Praise the Lord. I like it. He says the diamond won't be saying, "You see what I am?" He says, "A diamond is a diamond because he's off of a diamond." And a pin won't play the record right. A regular sewing needle, it won't play it right, but a diamond, it's the best. It brings out a clear diamondpointed needle. And may God tonight, your record of life, remember brother Brandham said that. He said, he said, "We all have a record &gt;&gt; and it's placed and then it's played." And he says, "When you get to the end of the record," he takes the needle off of it and he takes the record and he puts it back in the sleeve. He puts it back. And then on the day of judgment, he takes it out. He puts it on the phonograph player and he sets it down there and listens to see what kind of life came out of that record when the needle struck it. &gt;&gt; Oneness with God. oneness. That's what we need. &gt;&gt; Amen. May your record of life, whatever what's wrong with you, whatever you're desiring from God, may the great master who holds the needle in his hand, may he put it upon your life and reveal to us what you're here for, what you want, and then we'll know that he's here. And what are we then today? We are stars. And I know in the last couple services we've heard about you are the light of the world. You you can't be the light unless you're reflecting a light from somewhere. &gt;&gt; Because there is no light in us because we're sin born. But if you're a chip off the old block, &gt;&gt; if you go back and read the adoption series, brother Brandham says, he says, oh, he says he's got the tutor. And the book of Galatians talks about it says we're under tutors. We're under people that are trying to chip us into shape. &gt;&gt; And he said he'll ask the tutor, he says, "How's my son doing?" And you know what he always says? Every time you find it in the message, Brother Brandham says, "He's a chip off the old black." Amen. Are you a chip off the old block? Are you just hanging on or are you just bringing trying to trying to mold yourself into something that that Amen. We are stars. Every born again Christian is a testimony to the Lord Jesus Christ. a star to reflect his power in the holiness of the Lord Jesus Christ to reflect him that is life to reflect him in his speech to reflect him in his healing power to reflect him in his resurrection to reflect him in every way that he was reflected to us by God the father we are stars and we cannot be an ordinary we have to be unusual we cannot be usual because God's people are peculiar people always been through the ages is although peculiar yet the star is brilliant not brilliant in the world's educational world affair but brilliant as a sacrifice before the lord and we prostrate ourselves as the magi did in the presence of the king of kings to reflect his light and you're a star every Christian's a star to guide the lost to guide the weary the foot of the traveler to those who are seeking and the star cannot be guided by itself It must be led by a spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Every every part of your life has to be led by the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. It must reflect the brilliancancy of God in its life. To abstain from the things of the world, to live godly and soberly in this present life, it must reflect the light of this great one that shine. And that's what he is. He is only a reflection of the word. And that's what he is today. A reflection of the word. Trying to find somebody to reflect himself through oneness. Amen. &gt;&gt; You want to be that? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Let's bow our heads. Dear Lord Jesus, Lord, your word, when it struck our lives, there was a vibration. And we're so thankful &gt;&gt; for that vibration. We're so thankful that it sprung to life and the word of God became real. And the word, we'd be reading it and say, "Oh, I think I've I think I know this." Though you've never seen it. And Lord, as sons and daughters, we meet people from across the world, different nations, different states, different areas, and we can tell there's a kindred spirit when the spirit of God is born in their hearts. And I pray, Lord, tonight, though the message might seem simple, Lord, I pray that you'll just deal with us, Lord. That you'll let us remember that we're a chip. We're a chip of the master diamond, Lord. And through the chip, we can reflect the light that's behind us. We can reflect the light of the invisible God to this dying world. I just pray that you'll just grant every request, Lord. May you give each and every believer, Lord, give each answer their prayers. Reveal yourself to them. Show them that you are real and that you are God and you don't change. and you don't fail and and you always keep your promise. I pray, Father, I pray that you'll just move by your spirit. We love you. We commit this all into your hands. In Jesus Christ's name we ask it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. and I don't have a song. So, it's all yours, Brother John. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Few. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I am one of the few. I am one of the few. Yes, I'm one of the few. And by faith in God's word, I can claim it. Though the way may seem long and the opposition strong, for the bride, there's a way provided. If I plan to go through just to hope will not do, I must be firmly decided to follow the Lord by obeying his word and believe that I'm one of the few. I'm one of the few. Yes, I'm one of the few. And by faith in God's word, I can claim it. Though the way may seem long and the opposition strong, for the bride, there's a way provided. If I plan to go through just to hope will not do, I must be firmly decided to follow the Lord by obeying his word and believe that I'm one of the few. And believe that I'm one of the few. Oh, how do we become one? &gt;&gt; By become one with the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By obeying the word. &gt;&gt; Um Jesus was perfect. He was one with the father. &gt;&gt; We're born in sin. So we become more and more one with the father &gt;&gt; through taking the word that we heard tonight &gt;&gt; and striving to become more like Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. It cannot happen without us claiming it and and and confessing it and and just believing every time we hear the word. Brother Brandham said, "The Holy Ghost says amen to every word of God." And uh we're becoming more like him. It's an invisible union. Brother Brandham said, "We're becoming more like Jesus." Let's sing uh one of them. One of them. Amen. There are people almost everywhere whose hearts are all afflicted. With the fire that fell at Pentecost, which cleansed and made them clean, it is burning now within my heart. All glory to his name. I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. One of them. One of them. I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. One of them. One of them. I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. Though these people may not learned nor boast of worldly fame, they have all received their Pentecost baptized in Jesus' name and are telling now both far and wide. His powers yet the same. I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. One of them. One of them. I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. One of them. One of them. I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. They were gathered in the upper room all praying in his name. They were baptized with the Holy Ghost and powerful service came. Now, what it did for them that day, he'll do for you the same. I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. One of them. One of them. I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. One of them. One of them. I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. Come my brother, seek this blessing that will cleanse your heart from sin. That will start the joy bells ringing and will keep the soul of flame. It is burning now within my heart. All glory to his name. I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. Oh, one of them. One of them. I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. One of them. One of them. I'm so glad that I can say I'm one
