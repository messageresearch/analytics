[42:54] amen
[42:55] praise the lord while we're just in this
[42:57] tremendous atmosphere why don't we just
[42:59] turn to
[43:00] revelations chapter 2 we'll read one
[43:02] verse there
[43:03] verse 24
[43:05] revelations chapter 2
[43:08] verse 24. i'm so glad to be in the house
[43:10] of lord today we should never take these
[43:13] meetings for granted
[43:15] and uh we are
[43:17] uh we consider it a privilege every time
[43:18] we're able to make it to the house of
[43:20] the lord
[43:20] and we're certainly
[43:22] counted a great privilege to be here
[43:23] today brother john and to be ministered
[43:25] uh not only just behind this uh sacred
[43:28] desk that you stand behind but before
[43:29] the people that god has called as such a
[43:32] privilege to stand before the elect and
[43:34] minister
[43:35] and is it okay to mention where i was
[43:37] yesterday afternoon
[43:40] not the barn wait brother john took us
[43:42] by and we saw the church give us a
[43:43] little sneak peek i know he's kind of
[43:45] been protective of it because he wants
[43:46] to i can understand that burden that
[43:48] heart you know brother braham even said
[43:50] that god likes to surprise his children
[43:53] and so i think even as a pastor you some
[43:54] you want
[43:55] you want things to be special so he took
[43:57] us by to see the uh the church since it
[44:00] might be our best chance to see it and
[44:01] oh my it's just wonderful to see what
[44:04] the lord is doing we rejoiced when you
[44:05] got the building and i felt like if you
[44:06] could have just moved in there day one
[44:08] and started having church it would have
[44:09] been awesome but you know the
[44:11] perfectionist that brother john is uh he
[44:13] just he's really putting a lot of
[44:14] thought a lot of labor and effort into
[44:16] creating a beautiful sanctuary for you
[44:18] to come and gather and to worship so
[44:20] continue to pray for him find out ways
[44:22] you can support i guess without being
[44:24] present
[44:25] and with any kind of new church or any
[44:27] kind of move in there will be plenty of
[44:28] work to do once you're in
[44:30] uh so maybe save up your energy and your
[44:32] resources for that moment but it's just
[44:33] a beautiful doing a tremendous job
[44:35] brother john and i think the beauty of
[44:37] the church we know the beauty of the
[44:38] church is the character of the people
[44:40] this has been a work in progress for 20
[44:42] years
[44:43] and we think it's just marvelous what
[44:45] god has been doing spiritually and your
[44:47] character and your faithfulness to this
[44:48] facility to this location and we're
[44:50] certainly anxious to see that
[44:52] you all are moving into a new church
[44:54] sometime soon i'm not trying to put any
[44:55] pressure on you in a timeline i just
[44:57] know it's got to be soon and then
[45:00] we remarked about it wednesday night and
[45:03] um was even thinking about it yesterday
[45:04] but it was 20 years ago it was may 2001
[45:07] that you started cinderlight
[45:09] is that correct so it's 20 years this
[45:12] year is a 20-year anniversary and the
[45:14] first visiting minister they ever had in
[45:16] and they thought it was going to be the
[45:17] end of the work they had
[45:18] me in to preach
[45:20] and i came and preached i thought it was
[45:22] just faith building and i thought it was
[45:24] you know real foundational and i guess
[45:26] people thought i was a prosperity
[45:28] preacher
[45:29] and i used malachi 4 just as a reference
[45:32] to how there was prophecy that she
[45:33] created some expectation and sister
[45:35] cheryl got nervous and thought i was
[45:38] going to ruin everything
[45:40] but that was i was the first one in to
[45:42] minister in august of was it 16 and 17
[45:44] is that what it was in 2001
[45:47] and so we feel a real special connection
[45:49] to you just as a man of god not just
[45:51] because we married into the family but
[45:53] just as a man of god and so it's just
[45:54] exciting to see what god is doing
[45:56] excited to see
[45:58] um brother mark when did you start
[46:00] coming shortly after that or 2004 yeah
[46:02] 2004. i mean just to see
[46:04] 17 years later a young man uh following
[46:07] in uh you know just serving the lord and
[46:10] following the will of god and everyone
[46:11] being together i think it's just
[46:12] marvelous to see it so god bless you
[46:14] tremendously may god bless you richly we
[46:16] love you very very deeply revelations
[46:19] chapter 2 verse 24
[46:22] but i say unt but unto you i say and
[46:24] under the rest in thyatira as many as
[46:27] have not known
[46:28] have not this doctrine and which have
[46:31] not known the depths of satan as they
[46:33] speak i will put upon you none other
[46:37] burden and i've got to focus in on that
[46:38] phrase
[46:39] which have not known the depths of satan
[46:43] amen we'll just pray
[46:44] briefly our heavenly father as we are in
[46:46] your divine presence we ask that you
[46:48] come
[46:49] take the bread of life and feed it to us
[46:51] lord as i feel
[46:53] very comfortable in my spirit regardless
[46:55] of any weariness in mind or pain and
[46:57] body lord we feel very comfortable in
[46:58] our spirits that you desire to speak to
[47:00] your people
[47:02] and there's so many gathered here today
[47:04] that we have no concern as to
[47:06] mathematical requirements of two or
[47:08] three we have many lord we have no
[47:11] concern father as to whether or not
[47:12] we've gathered in your name we know that
[47:14] we've come to gather in your name
[47:16] now lord come speak to us we pray and in
[47:18] doing so may it help us encourage us and
[47:21] lift us up we ask this in the name of
[47:23] lord jesus christ
[47:24] amen amen you can be seated
[47:33] i don't know how many of you had visited
[47:35] brother john's office their trusted tool
[47:37] through the years
[47:38] but for many many years before they had
[47:41] repainted and remodeled a little bit
[47:42] there was a little sign
[47:45] a little handwritten note i think that
[47:46] johnny had put on the wall and it said
[47:48] invert always invert and that's my title
[47:51] today is invert
[47:53] always invert and if you're thinking
[47:55] well that's pretty strange
[47:56] i'll accept that but we'll help you
[47:58] we'll go through it a little bit maybe
[48:00] to understand the thought process and i
[48:02] think it's maybe a little catchy just to
[48:04] get you to think about these things but
[48:06] this invert
[48:07] always invert and we'll kind of explain
[48:10] even what that phrase means but i want
[48:11] to start
[48:12] with revelations chapter 2 verse 24 and
[48:15] so we're not really trying to take this
[48:16] particular scripture
[48:18] and give it a lot of context and and
[48:20] find a lot of depth to it but we're just
[48:23] wanting to take
[48:24] this phrase which have not known the
[48:26] depths of satan and kind of begin there
[48:28] because brother branham makes this
[48:30] statement in the thiatering church age
[48:32] this is chapter 6 when he writes the
[48:34] church age book he says let us first
[48:36] know
[48:37] what the depth of god is and the
[48:39] opposite will be true for the depth of
[48:41] satan so here's revelations chapter 2
[48:43] verse 24 saying they have not known
[48:46] the depths of satan and instead of
[48:48] trying to figure out what are the depths
[48:49] of satan and just how deep does that go
[48:52] he say well let's just know what the
[48:53] depth of god is and as you know the
[48:55] depths of god well he's just saying the
[48:57] reverse or the inverse will be true for
[49:00] the depth of satan and he quotes
[49:02] ephesians chapter 3 verses 16 to 18
[49:06] and it continues it says now according
[49:08] to these verses when a man experiences
[49:10] the depth of god in his life it is an
[49:13] actual personal experience of the spirit
[49:15] of god indwelling him and his mind is
[49:19] illuminated by the wisdom and knowledge
[49:21] of god through the word so this is the
[49:23] depths of god but the depth of satan
[49:26] will be that will be in that he will
[49:28] attempt to destroy this so when you
[49:31] recognize what the depths of god are and
[49:33] he kind of uses ephesians chapter three
[49:35] to uh identify once you know what the
[49:38] depth of god is then you can begin to
[49:40] understand what the depth of satan would
[49:43] be and he says the depth of satan the
[49:45] attack what he will try to do is to
[49:47] destroy
[49:48] the indwelling of god and the believer
[49:51] destroy god illuminating you by with the
[49:53] wisdom and knowledge of god through the
[49:55] word that's what god wants to do in
[49:56] indwell you once he dwells inside of you
[49:59] he wants to
[50:01] cause himself to increase and to grow
[50:03] and illuminate in you the depth of satan
[50:05] is to is the opposite to destroy that
[50:08] and he says he will always attempt to
[50:09] make a substitute for this reality of
[50:12] god how he do it he will take away the
[50:14] knowledge of the truth of god destroy
[50:17] the word by putting forth his own idea
[50:19] then he kind of refers he refers to
[50:20] genesis 3 yeah god said
[50:22] because in in the temptation
[50:25] of christ the temptation of the woman he
[50:27] will then substitute this is a very very
[50:30] weighty statement he will then
[50:32] substitute the personal christ in our
[50:34] spirits
[50:35] so this is what satan would want to do
[50:37] is substitute the personal christ in our
[50:38] spirits provides you with his own
[50:41] knowledge his own yeah if god said his
[50:43] own reasonings his own questionings to
[50:45] overthrow the power of god but what what
[50:48] brother branham has done in looking at
[50:50] the scripture revelations chapter 2
[50:52] verse 24 and then expounding upon the
[50:54] spirit of god indwelling in you and
[50:56] your mind being illuminated by the
[50:57] wisdom and knowledge of god through the
[50:59] word
[51:00] he's saying first know what the depth of
[51:02] god is and the opposite or the inverse
[51:05] the reverse will be true for the depth
[51:08] of satan so what brother brahm does he's
[51:10] done is he's used inversion and
[51:12] inversion is the reversal of a position
[51:14] it's the changing the reversal of an
[51:15] order or even the the reverse of a
[51:17] relationship so if something is inverse
[51:20] then it's a re you could say reverse if
[51:22] it's inverse it's reverse or opposite or
[51:24] what is contrary so in this case brother
[51:27] baby says oh you say well they have not
[51:29] known the depth of satan but everyone
[51:30] said well first know what the depth of
[51:32] god is
[51:33] and so if we were to put some sort of it
[51:36] would all only it would have to be
[51:37] arbitrary but if we put some quantifier
[51:40] on it or try to qualify god or quantify
[51:43] god and say well god is 200 then satan
[51:46] would be the opposite of that right i
[51:48] mean he couldn't even he's he's the he's
[51:50] the contrary he's the different if god
[51:52] is light satan's darkness and so you see
[51:54] that god is this inverse relationship
[51:57] but the branham makes this statement the
[51:59] greatest battle ever fought satan's army
[52:01] brings diseases that's what satan is
[52:03] he's a destroyer
[52:05] satan's a destroyer god is a what a
[52:06] creator
[52:08] this is the inverse the opposite one is
[52:09] so it's like we're learning opposites
[52:11] maybe this is the best place to start
[52:13] for all of us no matter how old we are
[52:14] if something is
[52:16] above and below
[52:18] hot cold those are inverse relationships
[52:21] so satan's army brings diseases that's
[52:23] what satan is he's a destroyer satan the
[52:25] whole kingdom of satan is sickness death
[52:28] sorrow and frustrations and worry all of
[52:30] satan and he says god is lie faith joy
[52:33] peace over here amen this is an is
[52:36] creating a relationship satan on one
[52:37] hand is death sickness sorrow
[52:39] frustration and worry god is life faith
[52:42] joy peace over here
[52:44] these are this is one is positive one is
[52:46] negative
[52:47] and they're opposites of each other this
[52:49] is an inverse relationship
[52:51] and it's important maybe to think in
[52:53] terms of
[52:54] uh of why they're opposite
[52:57] and
[52:58] this uh this arrangement of satan's
[53:00] kingdom is god's kingdom
[53:02] uh it's gonna be real important to the
[53:03] thought that i'm trying to expound upon
[53:06] and so the title invert always invert
[53:08] invert means to put upside down or in
[53:10] the opposite position so we said
[53:12] inversion is the reversal of a position
[53:14] or order or a form or relationship to
[53:18] invert is to put something upside down
[53:20] or in the opposite position
[53:22] the opposite order or arrangement we
[53:24] always go alphabetical order to invert
[53:27] that would go from a to b would be z to
[53:29] a that would be the invert and we go if
[53:31] you read from
[53:33] left to right to do it the invert would
[53:35] be to read from right to left and so
[53:37] this is just what invert means and so
[53:39] when we use the phrase invert always
[53:42] invert
[53:43] it's a phrase that was used by carl
[53:44] jacoby he's a mathematician
[53:47] and it was just kind of it was a maxim
[53:48] it was a kind of a cliche to use
[53:51] to refer to an approach
[53:52] how to approach a difficult problem
[53:54] you're looking at a promise now i can't
[53:56] figure this out and you're asking
[53:57] yourself well
[53:59] what what's the answer and how can i
[54:01] solve this and say well instead of
[54:03] instead of approaching this way why
[54:04] don't you turn it around and work on it
[54:06] backwards
[54:07] uh maybe in um uh
[54:10] it's a maxim that's used within
[54:12] investments and i'm trying to remember
[54:13] the gentleman's name now but he's the
[54:14] partner there with uh
[54:16] now i can't remember the either of their
[54:18] names berkshire hathaway guy can you
[54:20] remember warren buffett his buddy i
[54:21] can't remember his name right now paul
[54:23] something uh he uses this phrase of
[54:26] invert always invert investing and
[54:28] instead of asking yourself um how will
[54:30] this make me rich you guys how will this
[54:31] make me poor or how can i lose a lot of
[54:34] money in this investment instead of kind
[54:35] of looking at what's the downside what's
[54:37] the negative what are the barriers and
[54:39] how this was inspired to me this very
[54:41] thought was inspired to me when i was
[54:43] looking into the word of god and i saw
[54:44] that the the opening of the word of god
[54:46] is the believer's joy
[54:48] and the pure joy that a christian is
[54:50] going to experience this through the
[54:51] word of god there's no other joy that we
[54:52] can have except through the word of god
[54:55] and and that we have this idea well i
[54:57] want to be happy and i want to and i
[54:58] want to have peace and i want to have
[55:00] joy
[55:00] and the lord dealt with me in this idea
[55:02] of invert instead of how can i have joy
[55:05] ask yourself what's keeping me from joy
[55:07] i want to have peace i want to have joy
[55:09] i want to have life i want to have
[55:10] happiness well maybe if it's been such
[55:13] something that's out of your reach and
[55:14] out of grasp it's a difficult problem
[55:16] then so we ask ourselves well not so
[55:19] much how can i have peace because many
[55:20] times we see it almost so plain in the
[55:23] word of god this is what it takes to
[55:25] have it if you have not obtained it
[55:27] maybe you need to ask yourself what's
[55:28] keeping me from it right and so that's
[55:30] the thought that uh the kind of the
[55:32] basis for even looking at this you
[55:34] approach a difficult problem by saying
[55:36] well
[55:36] uh let's address it backwards they say
[55:39] many difficult problems can be solved by
[55:41] addressing it backwards in other words
[55:42] you turn something upside down
[55:44] you could be looking at a picture you
[55:46] could be looking at a puzzle you could
[55:47] have a piece of the puzzle and you keep
[55:48] trying to make it fit and someone walks
[55:50] up and looks and says oh no you just
[55:51] need to turn it around
[55:53] like man i was
[55:55] i've been doing that for five minutes
[55:56] and they just kind of look at it
[55:58] differently they look at it from a
[55:59] different perspective sometimes it's
[56:00] because they come and stand on the other
[56:02] side
[56:03] you're looking at it one way and someone
[56:05] walks up from the other side and goes oh
[56:07] no it doesn't go there it goes right
[56:08] there
[56:09] wow it was a different perspective
[56:11] they're looking at it in reverse looking
[56:12] at it from an opposite vantage point
[56:16] this is something that this is personal
[56:18] for me
[56:20] that many times when i'm looking into
[56:21] the word of god and i'm wrestling with
[56:22] the difficult concept
[56:24] and i'm looking at things in the word of
[56:26] god and there's things that maybe you're
[56:27] reasoning out with somebody and you're
[56:29] fellowshipping in the word of god and
[56:31] you see something very clear in the
[56:32] message of the hour but then all of a
[56:34] sudden somebody kind of takes another
[56:35] statement says well what what about this
[56:37] one though and you look at it and it
[56:39] almost seems like oh wow this looks like
[56:42] it's saying almost the opposite
[56:44] of what what brother branham taught or
[56:46] this scene how does this how does this
[56:47] fit and the more you look at it and just
[56:49] kind of wait on it and ask god to quick
[56:51] into it you realize it actually becomes
[56:54] even better and more greater support for
[56:56] what you're looking at when you look at
[56:58] it from a different perspective you just
[57:00] turn it around you look at it and say
[57:01] well wait a minute that that contradicts
[57:03] that doesn't seem right well you might
[57:05] just be looking at it wrong turn it
[57:07] upside down turn it around wait on it
[57:09] see how it fits within the hole and my
[57:12] inspiration was
[57:14] this morning and and even to the subject
[57:16] of invert was i had been
[57:18] thinking about mind battles and how we
[57:20] all go through mind battles and i i'm
[57:22] saying that so i can get a lot of amens
[57:23] this morning preach about mind battles
[57:25] and everybody's like god bless you
[57:26] brother we love you well john when are
[57:28] you having him back
[57:31] was thinking about mind battles and then
[57:33] especially within the context of the
[57:35] greatest battle ever fought right and so
[57:38] we're all very familiar with that
[57:39] teaching and that tremendous sermon the
[57:41] greatest battle ever fought and so we
[57:42] have these mind battles and we're in
[57:44] this greatest battle ever fought and i
[57:46] realized that we can view our the
[57:49] warfare that we engage in these mind
[57:51] battles we can in view the greatest
[57:53] battle ever fought of these things that
[57:54] were taking place in our mind
[57:57] in a way that doesn't that brings
[57:58] discouragement
[58:00] in other words we're in the greatest
[58:01] battle ever fought we all have mind
[58:03] battles and where that ought to be
[58:05] comforting it actually becomes a great
[58:06] discouragement because like oh i'm
[58:08] fighting i'm war and this is difficult
[58:09] this is horrible i shouldn't be going
[58:11] through this i shouldn't be thinking
[58:13] these things i should be so far beyond
[58:14] this
[58:15] but and so i realized that there's this
[58:18] way that just knowing we're in a battle
[58:20] brings uh brings discouragement
[58:22] the battle's bad enough right
[58:24] but then all of a sudden like we're just
[58:26] in full-on fisticuffs with the devil and
[58:28] he says i can't believe you're fighting
[58:29] me like great
[58:31] you know here i thought i was doing the
[58:33] right thing i thought i was fighting i
[58:34] thought this was the right thing to do
[58:35] and now he's making me feel foolish for
[58:37] even finding and it just cascades and
[58:39] the domino effect hits us and we can
[58:41] become very very discouraged
[58:44] and so when we
[58:45] say the phrase and and and you can even
[58:48] acknowledge it we're all family today
[58:49] we've all said it before the devil is
[58:51] attacking my mind
[58:52] i'm having mind battles i'm really going
[58:54] through it the devil is just attacking
[58:56] me these thoughts are coming these
[58:58] things are bombarding me
[58:59] and when that happens we're made to feel
[59:01] very vulnerable
[59:03] like
[59:03] the mind is just a target it's always
[59:05] available this whenever he wants to come
[59:07] back
[59:09] and so it makes us feel very weak uh we
[59:11] feel wrong because we're engaged in
[59:13] these mind battles and we feel very
[59:14] we're on the defensive because something
[59:16] attacks us and we get our guard up or
[59:18] something comes in our minds and we feel
[59:20] very vulnerable or something takes place
[59:22] and we're we're feeling very weak just
[59:24] because our minds are uh it seems as if
[59:27] they're always available
[59:29] always available for something to drop
[59:31] in there some thought to come and we're
[59:32] told that you can't stop them you can't
[59:35] stop the thought from coming right
[59:37] but you can kick it out
[59:39] like you can't stop the birds from
[59:41] you know coming and sitting down but you
[59:42] don't have to give them enough time to
[59:44] build a nest
[59:45] you know the thought comes in and
[59:46] settles in for a little bit and it
[59:47] starts getting comfortable you just say
[59:48] get out of there right because you don't
[59:51] want it to find a home or make an abode
[59:52] in your mind
[59:53] and so i want to use a different
[59:55] perspective i want to use
[59:57] invert this you say oh we're there and
[59:59] i'm going through it i'm in a battle in
[1:00:00] my mind and i'm fighting and the devil's
[1:00:02] bombarding me and the devil's attacking
[1:00:04] me and i've got these thoughts and i've
[1:00:05] got that thought let's invert that amen
[1:00:08] we are not the victim
[1:00:10] all right let's think about a little bit
[1:00:11] differently we are not
[1:00:13] the ones being attacked
[1:00:15] but i want to take this and this would
[1:00:17] be my thesis that i'll just amplify for
[1:00:19] the time that we have together today
[1:00:21] the word
[1:00:23] is the aggressor in this war
[1:00:26] like so we're in this battle oh but my
[1:00:28] mind is being attacked i'm in this
[1:00:29] warfare i'm being attacked and you feel
[1:00:31] vulnerable you feel weak you feel like
[1:00:32] you're a wick a victim but if you invert
[1:00:35] that
[1:00:36] satan's attack
[1:00:38] may be him fighting back against the
[1:00:42] word
[1:00:44] satan's satan's uh his his his attack
[1:00:47] may be him defending
[1:00:49] against the word that begins to advance
[1:00:51] within our minds as we begin to grow as
[1:00:53] christians and begin to feed upon the
[1:00:54] word of god as we begin to experience
[1:00:56] another reality and the word begins to
[1:00:58] illuminate our minds and and something
[1:01:00] comes up and now we're fighting and now
[1:01:02] we're battling with now we're wrestling
[1:01:04] and we begin to think oh i'm being
[1:01:05] attacked well have you ever thought that
[1:01:06] maybe the word is attacking the devil
[1:01:09] the word is attacking some stronghold
[1:01:11] that's been in your mind you've had this
[1:01:12] belief system your whole life you've had
[1:01:14] these tendencies your whole lives you
[1:01:16] have these lies that recited in your
[1:01:17] conscience subconscious you have all
[1:01:19] these things that maybe exist in your
[1:01:21] spirit and the word begins to increase
[1:01:23] and what to push out and so one day it
[1:01:25] comes when it wakes up an old complex or
[1:01:27] wakes up an idea wakes up a belief wakes
[1:01:30] up an affection or an infinity or a
[1:01:31] memory it says all right but it's time
[1:01:33] to go it's time to leave and the word is
[1:01:36] serving these eviction papers and the
[1:01:38] devil says no i don't want to go i want
[1:01:39] to stay here and you start fighting
[1:01:43] i'm sure you can relate to this
[1:01:44] that there's things that you go your
[1:01:46] whole life well i never fought like this
[1:01:48] before i never struggle with this why am
[1:01:49] i fighting now you never fought before
[1:01:52] right right it's really good before it
[1:01:54] just lived there rent free in your head
[1:01:56] did whatever it wanted to do
[1:01:58] made you do whatever you want to do but
[1:01:59] now all of a sudden there's something
[1:02:00] else alive that say no no don't do it
[1:02:03] don't go there don't think that don't
[1:02:04] say that about that person don't think
[1:02:06] negative don't think this don't think
[1:02:07] that and now you're actually fighting
[1:02:10] now you're saying no i don't want to be
[1:02:11] that way i don't want to live that way i
[1:02:13] don't want to have these thoughts i
[1:02:14] don't experience these things no i don't
[1:02:15] want to always be give up i don't always
[1:02:17] want to be melancholy you don't always
[1:02:18] want to be depressed i don't always want
[1:02:20] to be undergoing oh i want to overcome i
[1:02:22] wanted to have joy i want to have peace
[1:02:23] i want to have life and now you're
[1:02:24] fighting for it amen
[1:02:27] and so that's my idea of
[1:02:29] of the
[1:02:30] inversion invert always invert i feel
[1:02:33] like i've made the point we could go we
[1:02:35] could go get
[1:02:36] french laundry and get in like get in
[1:02:37] line early and
[1:02:39] get our name in so we don't have to wait
[1:02:41] two hours this afternoon i guess they
[1:02:43] call it the laundry now that goes to
[1:02:44] show how much of an old timer i am i
[1:02:46] remember when it's called the french
[1:02:47] laundry
[1:02:49] but that's that's my thought i'm just
[1:02:51] going to drive a home today amen he's
[1:02:53] going to drive a home that's my thought
[1:02:54] i was reading in acts chapter
[1:02:56] 17 as it talks about paul and them
[1:02:58] coming
[1:03:00] and they came into a town and they were
[1:03:02] declaring
[1:03:04] declaring the word of the lord
[1:03:06] and so as they came listen to what they
[1:03:08] said and when they they were seeking
[1:03:10] them and jason the house of jason and
[1:03:12] they sought to bring them out to the
[1:03:13] people and the jews were all moved but
[1:03:15] envy it says and they're wanting to take
[1:03:17] paul and silas and
[1:03:18] and beat them up and then it says in
[1:03:20] verse six and when they found them not
[1:03:22] they drew jason in certain brethren
[1:03:24] under the rulers of the city so here's
[1:03:25] jason and all the brothers this is this
[1:03:27] is send the light there
[1:03:29] and they're being dragged out into the
[1:03:31] into the street since jason and a few of
[1:03:33] his brothers i'm not prophesying any
[1:03:34] doom here but they get dragged out into
[1:03:37] the street and it says these
[1:03:39] that cut have returned
[1:03:42] and said to the religious crime these
[1:03:44] that have turned the world upside down
[1:03:46] are come hither also
[1:03:48] think about it now could you imagine at
[1:03:51] jason and the brethren are all going
[1:03:52] through it they're being bombarded and
[1:03:54] they're and they feel vulnerable and
[1:03:55] they feel attacked and they're a little
[1:03:56] bit scared about the things that are
[1:03:58] happening but this is what the city had
[1:04:00] to say about jason these brethren and
[1:04:01] paul and size these guys have turned the
[1:04:03] world upside down
[1:04:05] you feel like your world's getting
[1:04:06] turned upside down and you flipped
[1:04:08] upside down no no no no no your world's
[1:04:10] not turned upside down now it's right
[1:04:12] side up and it's the complexes and the
[1:04:14] fears and the doubts and it's the devil
[1:04:16] who's being dangled over hell upside
[1:04:18] down
[1:04:19] think about it the believers were said
[1:04:21] that they are the ones that turned the
[1:04:22] world upside down i'm not worried about
[1:04:24] the coronavirus turning my world upside
[1:04:26] down i'm not worried about uh
[1:04:28] economics turning to my world upside
[1:04:30] down i'm not worried about politics
[1:04:32] fashion entertainment sports you name it
[1:04:35] that ain't gonna turn my world upside
[1:04:37] down i'm gonna turn the world upside
[1:04:39] down because that's what a believer is
[1:04:41] called to do
[1:04:43] we're inverting him
[1:04:45] he said oh i feel like my world's been
[1:04:46] turned upside down maybe it's right side
[1:04:48] up
[1:04:49] maybe god's putting things into place
[1:04:51] maybe god's finally
[1:04:53] straightened something out in your line
[1:04:54] you're like man i i don't i feel a
[1:04:56] little crooked like no you're walking
[1:04:58] straight now
[1:04:59] you always walk with a lean
[1:05:02] and now god strange up things start to
[1:05:03] look different
[1:05:05] i said there's a phenomena these things
[1:05:07] are you guys are man you guys are fresh
[1:05:09] today this is i feel good i feel like
[1:05:10] you're just pulling me all over the
[1:05:11] place
[1:05:12] there's a they've done this and they've
[1:05:14] taken glasses
[1:05:16] and you can put you can wear glasses
[1:05:18] they'll actually turn what you're
[1:05:19] looking at upside down
[1:05:21] so you stand here you put glasses on and
[1:05:22] also in the room is upside down
[1:05:24] give it enough time and the brain will
[1:05:26] actually learn to flip it back
[1:05:28] that's true because that's the way the
[1:05:29] mind works the mind's gonna always
[1:05:31] flip it around so maybe you what the
[1:05:32] devil did is he put a pair of glasses on
[1:05:34] your head
[1:05:36] you started seeing the world upside down
[1:05:38] for a while because it's you're looking
[1:05:39] through the devil's eyes the devil's
[1:05:41] explanation the devil's circumstance
[1:05:42] look at everything and after a while
[1:05:43] your mind accepts it flips it and just
[1:05:46] keeps the glasses on
[1:05:48] [Music]
[1:05:49] and it's and your mind now has taken
[1:05:50] flipped and god just wants to take the
[1:05:52] glory you don't need the devil's view
[1:05:53] anymore you only keep having your world
[1:05:54] flip-flop back and forth he wants to
[1:05:56] heal your mind he wants to straighten
[1:05:58] things out
[1:05:59] so that's what i mean by invert always
[1:06:01] invert i'm going through the worst
[1:06:02] battle of my life this i've never been
[1:06:04] attacked like this before maybe the
[1:06:06] words the one that's on the attack amen
[1:06:08] amen and the devil is fighting back
[1:06:11] i'm going to look at these thoughts in
[1:06:12] greatest battle ever fought brother
[1:06:14] branham says this he says how did grant
[1:06:16] take richmond
[1:06:18] talking about civil war times he says
[1:06:19] how did grant take richmond just as he
[1:06:22] come to it
[1:06:24] this taking of richmond did not occur
[1:06:26] because they were there in washington dc
[1:06:28] and the mayor of richmond showed up
[1:06:30] there went to the pentagon and said
[1:06:32] i don't know existed at the time but
[1:06:33] let's just say went to the white house
[1:06:35] and said you know i'm just going to
[1:06:36] surren here's the keys to the city mr
[1:06:38] lincoln uh grant here's my surrender
[1:06:41] papers no grant had to come to richmond
[1:06:44] and it was in it in his path he says
[1:06:46] just does he come to it that's how he
[1:06:47] took richmond he says that's how god
[1:06:50] soldiers take sin sickness just as they
[1:06:53] come to it
[1:06:54] that sickness didn't come to you you've
[1:06:56] come to it that changes everything right
[1:06:59] you're not being picked on you're not
[1:07:00] being bullied something's happened and
[1:07:02] you've advanced you've come to a place
[1:07:04] where sin and sickness has met you but
[1:07:06] you've come to it
[1:07:08] that's the way they overcome their
[1:07:10] doubts and fears and things doubts and
[1:07:12] fears are things that are uncovered and
[1:07:14] stirred up let's not think that we're
[1:07:15] necessarily being ambushed or attacked
[1:07:17] let's think that the word has uncovered
[1:07:20] it the word has exposed it the word has
[1:07:22] identified it
[1:07:24] he says when one rises they chop them
[1:07:26] down move out of the way
[1:07:28] so this is the language that he's using
[1:07:30] he's not he hasn't painted this picture
[1:07:32] that the believers over here huddled in
[1:07:34] a corner
[1:07:36] that's okay i can drop out of camera
[1:07:37] view i'll get right back up
[1:07:39] huddled over here in the corner and
[1:07:41] shrieking because fear is coming and
[1:07:42] death is coming and sickness is coming
[1:07:44] but no we're walking right right we're
[1:07:47] walking in the christian life fear pops
[1:07:50] up chop it away
[1:07:52] we're advancing in the word of god doubt
[1:07:54] comes up chop it away you're serving
[1:07:56] guard you're going forward sickness
[1:07:57] comes god i believe you're my healer i
[1:07:59] believe that you can deliver me we're
[1:08:01] not we haven't built these
[1:08:02] fortifications and we're all just
[1:08:03] huddled in the basement hoping that this
[1:08:05] tornado passes that's not what the
[1:08:07] believer is doing the believers on the
[1:08:08] attack
[1:08:10] and when he uses this image of how grant
[1:08:12] took richmond
[1:08:14] the capture of richmond there's actually
[1:08:16] this phrase like grant took richmond i
[1:08:18] don't think it's one we use anymore
[1:08:19] actually my advice would try to just
[1:08:20] avoid any civil war era phrases
[1:08:23] completely
[1:08:24] uh but uh
[1:08:26] this this phrase like grant took
[1:08:28] richmond it means it's decided decidedly
[1:08:31] very clear that's a phrase it was just
[1:08:34] a cliche anybody ever heard it used
[1:08:36] before i'm not trying to date anybody
[1:08:38] here but
[1:08:39] this was just a phrase that was commonly
[1:08:41] used in writings and things and uh over
[1:08:43] a hundred years ago but it was like hey
[1:08:45] like grant i'm gonna do this like grant
[1:08:46] took richmond very quickly very
[1:08:48] decidedly
[1:08:49] but what's interesting is when brother
[1:08:51] branham says how did grant take richmond
[1:08:54] the fall of richmond was preceded by the
[1:08:56] siege of petersburg
[1:08:58] and this was the seas you think oh like
[1:09:00] grant took richmond boy it just was
[1:09:02] vanquished it was just destroyed it was
[1:09:04] decided quickly and actually when they
[1:09:06] came in there on
[1:09:07] in richmond
[1:09:08] on april 3rd it fell in one day
[1:09:11] they conquered it in one day
[1:09:13] but the siege of petersburg lasted for
[1:09:15] 292 days
[1:09:18] from june 15 1864 to april 2nd 1865
[1:09:22] and during the siege of petersburg the
[1:09:24] armies were entrenched over 40 miles
[1:09:27] 40 miles of entrenchments there was over
[1:09:30] 70 000 casualties over that 10-month
[1:09:32] period so over 10 month period over 70
[1:09:35] 000 casualties entrenched over 40 miles
[1:09:37] they said it was some of the most uh
[1:09:39] sophisticated systems of earthworks ever
[1:09:41] seen in battle
[1:09:43] because you have this long siege and
[1:09:44] they're building these earthworks and
[1:09:46] they're building these trenches and
[1:09:47] they're building this siege warfare and
[1:09:49] these were strongholds
[1:09:50] and you have petersburg entrenched you
[1:09:52] have the union army a sieging at lane
[1:09:54] siege and everything is entrenched
[1:09:56] around it it's a very long drawn out
[1:09:58] protracted battle because there's a
[1:09:59] stronghold and here's the union army
[1:10:02] coming to push it out of the stronghold
[1:10:04] coming to to overcome it and to conquer
[1:10:06] it
[1:10:07] and saint petersburg was surrendered at
[1:10:09] dawn on april 3rd
[1:10:11] so
[1:10:12] 292 days
[1:10:14] finally it comes to end at the dawn on
[1:10:16] april 3rd and now once this petersburg
[1:10:19] which had been the stronghold that was
[1:10:21] holding out and the union army is
[1:10:23] attacking it once it finally gives way
[1:10:25] say petersburg falls the same day
[1:10:28] richmond is conquered
[1:10:30] why because it was the army kept
[1:10:33] marching
[1:10:34] it found a stronghold it may have taken
[1:10:35] a while but they finally decided
[1:10:37] defeated it but now they come up against
[1:10:39] richmond and richmond was something that
[1:10:41] was next
[1:10:42] right it wasn't sitting back and letting
[1:10:45] uh the the the confederacy bring the
[1:10:48] battle to the union and and on the
[1:10:50] defensive and running here and running
[1:10:52] there and trying to find the best ground
[1:10:54] and trying to find a way um to to to to
[1:10:57] figure out what's taking place and
[1:10:58] sabotage no the army was going forward
[1:11:01] the truth was marching on we could say
[1:11:03] and here's the here's the truth going
[1:11:05] forward the truth going forward maybe
[1:11:06] sometimes there's the siege a 292-day
[1:11:09] trench warfare but as soon as that
[1:11:11] failed the next one was richmond
[1:11:13] he says that's how the believers take
[1:11:15] sin that's how they overcome doubt fear
[1:11:17] in things is when one rises up they chop
[1:11:19] it down amen
[1:11:21] brother branham says in greatest battle
[1:11:23] ever thought take the word of god and
[1:11:24] cut your way through every doubt amen
[1:11:28] cut your way through i mean it's between
[1:11:30] you and a destination
[1:11:32] you're moving along and it pops up
[1:11:34] you're going somewhere so you chop your
[1:11:36] way through it
[1:11:38] amen again the images you're not sitting
[1:11:40] here just being bombarded that's good
[1:11:42] you're not back in the you're not back
[1:11:44] in the in the corner and the ropes just
[1:11:46] trying to dodge and cover up and and
[1:11:48] whether this barrage of punches no
[1:11:50] you're going forward
[1:11:52] he says sure that's it that's the next
[1:11:55] job let's get it done right next thing
[1:11:58] i'm going to do is get away from my
[1:11:59] doubts cut it down my next job is get
[1:12:02] away from my frustrations notice how
[1:12:04] this is advancement this is progress you
[1:12:07] say oh well i had this is me just kind
[1:12:09] of amplifying this he says oh i had this
[1:12:11] i had all these doubts and and i was
[1:12:14] fighting these doubts and now i've
[1:12:15] gotten rid of the doubts and now i have
[1:12:16] frustrations well brother brahms in some
[1:12:18] way
[1:12:19] validated your struggle
[1:12:22] he's kind of said you know what this is
[1:12:23] what happens once you get rid of doubts
[1:12:24] you have to get rid of frustrations and
[1:12:26] so we might go from one battle to the
[1:12:27] next to the next about to the next and
[1:12:29] we can get discouraged but i said no no
[1:12:30] no no you're conquering things
[1:12:32] you're advancing you're going forward
[1:12:34] you say i got rid of all my doubts and
[1:12:36] now i'm frustrated good doubts are dead
[1:12:38] frustrations are next
[1:12:40] just like you chopped down away and you
[1:12:41] got to overcome doubt you overcame this
[1:12:43] and you overcame that now it's time to
[1:12:45] overcome the next one he says if my
[1:12:47] senses tell me well you feel bad that's
[1:12:49] the next thing to do is cut that away
[1:12:51] man i got rid of my doubts i got rid of
[1:12:53] my frustrations and now i don't feel
[1:12:54] good well get rid of that
[1:12:57] that's the next thing he says you know
[1:12:59] my conscience tells me brother branham
[1:13:00] well you might as well cut that thing
[1:13:02] away too
[1:13:04] that's good he says you ain't going to
[1:13:05] get no farther than that
[1:13:08] why because you're you're going forward
[1:13:10] doubts come up fight it out with doubt
[1:13:12] maybe there's a siege maybe 292 days
[1:13:14] without once you kill it what's the next
[1:13:16] one
[1:13:16] it's frustration kill that next one i
[1:13:19] don't feel good kill that well my
[1:13:20] conscience he's saying just go one by
[1:13:22] one by one because that's that's the
[1:13:24] next battle he says you'll get no
[1:13:26] further than that just get your next job
[1:13:28] done
[1:13:29] take off your coat bear right into it
[1:13:32] just keep on going amen one objective
[1:13:36] i'm going to win amen i can't lose i'm
[1:13:40] going to win
[1:13:42] that's inversion
[1:13:43] right we think that whenever we get into
[1:13:45] battle i want you to think very this is
[1:13:47] very simple very very simple but we
[1:13:49] think because we're losing we're in a
[1:13:51] battle the reason why one of the reasons
[1:13:54] why that becomes so significant in our
[1:13:55] minds is whenever there's a contest or
[1:13:57] conflict whenever there's a battle
[1:13:59] whenever we play a game and we play
[1:14:00] games with our children or we have an
[1:14:02] athletic contest you have a winner and
[1:14:04] you have a loser
[1:14:05] and what what the battle the fear the
[1:14:08] threat the battle holds over says i'm in
[1:14:09] a battle i'm in a war and we think we
[1:14:11] can lose and that's what causes the the
[1:14:14] consternation and the troubles and the
[1:14:15] difficulties and the fear and the worry
[1:14:17] i'm in a fight i'm in a fight what if i
[1:14:19] lose you can't right amen so instead of
[1:14:21] thinking that a battle is a is a is the
[1:14:24] chance that you might lose every battle
[1:14:26] is guaranteed victory
[1:14:28] he said i'm going to win i can't lose
[1:14:30] i'm going to win so if you're in a fight
[1:14:32] you can already chalk one up in the win
[1:14:34] column amen
[1:14:36] you could just do it you say oh i'm in a
[1:14:38] fight we won again
[1:14:40] i got another victory put another notch
[1:14:41] in my belt give me another give me
[1:14:43] another championship trophy because this
[1:14:45] is another victory every battle is
[1:14:48] evidence and proof of another victory
[1:14:51] he says i'm going to win i can't lose
[1:14:53] i'm going to win
[1:14:55] i'll say this i i this may not be
[1:14:57] different to you but for me it was very
[1:14:58] different it's a very different way of
[1:15:00] viewing the greatest battle ever fought
[1:15:03] and the one thing that i this is many
[1:15:06] years ago the lord had quickened it to
[1:15:07] me for me personally as i realized that
[1:15:09] the greatest battle ever fought we know
[1:15:11] that brother brown is very clear about
[1:15:13] the greatest battle ever fought is in
[1:15:14] the mind
[1:15:17] but
[1:15:18] he was saying he was giving us the
[1:15:19] location of it but he was also
[1:15:21] identifying that the mind wasn't just
[1:15:23] the battleground the mind was the ground
[1:15:26] that was being battled for
[1:15:29] so it's not just a battle in the mind
[1:15:30] it's actually a battle for the mind we
[1:15:33] think well god chose my heart he has my
[1:15:34] heart i guess my mind is just going to
[1:15:36] be possessed by devils and be a
[1:15:38] battleground of devils and a war and a
[1:15:40] fight no that's not the that's not what
[1:15:42] god brother bannon was trying to teach
[1:15:44] is that as long as he's in your heart it
[1:15:45] doesn't matter what's in your mind uh it
[1:15:47] was a it was a question of god chose
[1:15:49] your soul seals that off by the baptist
[1:15:51] the holy ghost and now satan has access
[1:15:54] to your mind and the there's still a
[1:15:56] battle and a battle is for the purpose
[1:15:58] of victory and if you're going to win
[1:16:00] and you can't lose the greatest battle
[1:16:02] ever fought in your mind is guaranteed
[1:16:04] victory
[1:16:07] so the battle is not without a purpose
[1:16:10] we have something to overcome and we
[1:16:12] have we have something overcome for a
[1:16:15] reason
[1:16:16] the greatest battle ever fought is
[1:16:18] progress because the soul having been
[1:16:19] sealed it now advances to this place of
[1:16:22] the mind the seed of thoughts and
[1:16:23] feelings and affections it's now coming
[1:16:26] as a matter of progress to the place in
[1:16:28] the mind so that there can be possession
[1:16:30] of it
[1:16:33] and so the battle is not just in the
[1:16:34] mind it's for the mind some of the most
[1:16:36] significant and greatest battles ever
[1:16:38] fought throughout history was they did
[1:16:40] not choose a neutral site that was
[1:16:42] without consequence and they meet on the
[1:16:44] battlefield they merely go home it was
[1:16:46] done to increase something that this
[1:16:48] particular area this particular plot of
[1:16:50] land this particular field or this place
[1:16:53] had importance it had a
[1:16:55] significance to it and it was a means of
[1:16:57] possessing there wasn't a neutral
[1:16:58] battlefield site in all wars that
[1:17:00] everyone just kind of shows up and they
[1:17:02] have their their world war on these
[1:17:04] fields and the winner goes home and goes
[1:17:06] back to their country they fight for
[1:17:07] ground they want to possess
[1:17:09] they fight for land that is in question
[1:17:11] they fight over things that the the the
[1:17:13] ownership is in dispute and this mind
[1:17:16] the devil is fighting their mind wanting
[1:17:17] to take ownership of it and now we have
[1:17:20] the greatest greatest battle ever fought
[1:17:22] in our minds but not just in our minds
[1:17:25] but for your mind amen
[1:17:28] the bible says in genesis 22 17 that thy
[1:17:31] seed this promise to abraham which we
[1:17:33] are the royal seed of abraham thy seed
[1:17:35] shall possess the gate of his enemies
[1:17:39] this is the promise we will possess the
[1:17:41] gate
[1:17:42] of our enemies we have in our minds
[1:17:46] these senses these five gates
[1:17:47] imagination conscience memory reason and
[1:17:50] affection if you just want to say those
[1:17:51] are the gates of the spirit of your your
[1:17:53] biggest enemy
[1:17:55] because who's your biggest enemy
[1:17:56] yourself you're your biggest enemy i'm
[1:17:59] not your biggest enemy you are your
[1:18:00] biggest enemy
[1:18:01] [Laughter]
[1:18:03] i i know i know what you meant by
[1:18:04] michael they say who's your biggest
[1:18:06] sinner you are no yourself right right
[1:18:09] that's what you are your biggest enemy i
[1:18:11] i look in the mirror there's my biggest
[1:18:12] enemy well he's got gates
[1:18:15] he's got imagination conscience memory
[1:18:17] memory reason and affection those are
[1:18:19] gates in my spirit i got gates to my
[1:18:21] body and you shall possess the gates of
[1:18:24] your enemy you're going to bring any
[1:18:26] sense contrary to the word of god under
[1:18:28] subjection to the word any thought any
[1:18:31] imagination any consciousness any reason
[1:18:33] any affection everything subject to the
[1:18:35] word of god you shall possess the gate
[1:18:38] of your
[1:18:38] enemies it says in genesis chapter 49
[1:18:41] verse 19 it says god a troop shall
[1:18:44] overcome him
[1:18:46] interesting how it's phrased it says
[1:18:47] that he's going to be fought against the
[1:18:49] troops shall overcome him but he shall
[1:18:51] overcome at the last
[1:18:53] you follow the history of god and it
[1:18:54] says prophecy
[1:18:56] as it's going out over these children
[1:18:59] this prophecy from this the father here
[1:19:01] prophesies that god would be warriors
[1:19:04] and at times it would look like god is
[1:19:06] conquered
[1:19:07] but ultimately they'll be victorious
[1:19:09] they're going to be at times of seeming
[1:19:12] to be conquered and beaten down and
[1:19:13] downtrodden going through it but he
[1:19:15] shall overcome at the last this is the
[1:19:18] prophecy that they were going to be
[1:19:20] warriors i use it to speak to you that
[1:19:21] there's times that it may seem like
[1:19:23] you're going through something
[1:19:26] and it's going to end a certain way it's
[1:19:27] going to be a certain way you may feel
[1:19:29] that you've lost you may feel that oh
[1:19:30] i've lost this time i've lost this
[1:19:32] person i've lost this situation i've
[1:19:34] lost this opportunity and i've been beat
[1:19:36] up and turned upside down and
[1:19:38] everything's everything's fallen to
[1:19:39] pieces and nothing else nothing has
[1:19:41] worked out good but you shall be
[1:19:43] victorious or overcome at last
[1:19:47] and to so much soul that we have a
[1:19:49] promise that says all things work
[1:19:51] together for the good wait uh what
[1:19:54] all things work together for the good
[1:19:56] even we could say of dad the time that
[1:19:58] the troops overcame gad god somehow uses
[1:20:02] those losses and uses those
[1:20:04] circumstances and uses those
[1:20:06] frustrations and uses those doubts and
[1:20:08] uses everything we've gone through and
[1:20:10] uses it for good amen
[1:20:13] that's right
[1:20:14] as paul even concludes in romans 8 37
[1:20:16] nay and all these things we are more
[1:20:19] than conquerors through him that loved
[1:20:21] us
[1:20:22] i love how we chose to say this we are
[1:20:24] more than conquerors
[1:20:26] i i believe that this is exactly what is
[1:20:29] in it should be said or is intended when
[1:20:31] he says all things work together for the
[1:20:33] good verse 28 saying all things work
[1:20:35] together for the good someone said well
[1:20:36] but what about this and what about that
[1:20:37] he said yeah all things work together
[1:20:39] for the good.
[1:20:40] and he says so in all these things what
[1:20:42] were all these things tribulation
[1:20:43] distress nakedness persecution famine
[1:20:46] peril sword
[1:20:47] i mean he has a pretty good list right
[1:20:50] he's saying in all these things well
[1:20:52] what about the sword oh you're more than
[1:20:53] a conqueror what about peril more than a
[1:20:55] conqueror what about persecution more
[1:20:57] than a conqueror what about famine more
[1:20:58] than a conqueror what about tribulation
[1:20:59] more than a conqueror
[1:21:02] and what he's saying is that
[1:21:04] you're not going to be a survivor
[1:21:07] maybe we maybe we would have felt i mean
[1:21:09] maybe we'd be kind of comforted with our
[1:21:10] condition if paul said
[1:21:12] nay and all these things you shall get
[1:21:15] by
[1:21:16] and all these things you will survive
[1:21:19] and so we kind of get we could get this
[1:21:21] image in our minds of someone just kind
[1:21:22] of crawling out of this pit of
[1:21:23] tribulation
[1:21:24] i made it
[1:21:27] i'm here
[1:21:29] this famine is getting me i'm slipping
[1:21:32] away but
[1:21:34] i survived i always say no you're gonna
[1:21:37] be more than a conqueror
[1:21:39] i know what you're gonna i wish i could
[1:21:40] just jump up on top of this you're just
[1:21:42] gonna ride up over the top of it it
[1:21:44] means to gain a surpassing victory there
[1:21:47] is no overtime they're not going to
[1:21:49] penalty kicks
[1:21:50] it's not decided on a tiebreaker
[1:21:53] this is a surpassing victory
[1:21:56] what's incredible is at the end of the
[1:21:58] day the devil's going to look back and
[1:21:59] try to look at the scoreboard
[1:22:01] and he's like well at least it was what
[1:22:03] yeah
[1:22:04] i didn't even score a point
[1:22:06] i got shut out through 6 000 years
[1:22:09] how did that work
[1:22:12] he's gonna think well at least it was
[1:22:13] close wait they pitched a perfect game
[1:22:16] i never got on base
[1:22:18] every inning was an immaculate inning
[1:22:19] what are you kidding me they're not he
[1:22:22] can't figure out how that's gonna work
[1:22:23] but that's exactly what's going to
[1:22:24] happen he can't say scoreboard on
[1:22:26] anything
[1:22:28] there's nothing that he can say well at
[1:22:30] least i got you here at least i got you
[1:22:32] there there's this moment of realization
[1:22:34] when he's kicked into the lake of fire
[1:22:35] when he's gonna say at least i got you
[1:22:37] wait a minute what's he doing there
[1:22:40] everything works for the good
[1:22:44] ultimately you will gain surpassing
[1:22:46] victory because in all these things we
[1:22:48] are more than conquerors
[1:22:52] we're inverting the greatest battle ever
[1:22:53] fought the devil's attacking my mind the
[1:22:56] devil's i'm in a fight i'm in a battle
[1:22:57] i'm in a war in my mind well brother
[1:22:59] banner says you had to open the channel
[1:23:01] first you talked about this being born
[1:23:03] again by the baptist the holy ghost you
[1:23:04] open up that channel faith comes in
[1:23:06] you're sealed he says you've got to get
[1:23:09] the soldier
[1:23:10] the holy spirit placed at the
[1:23:12] battlefront
[1:23:14] that takes god's word
[1:23:16] he is the word and he stands there and
[1:23:19] there's nothing going to stop it then
[1:23:21] there's nothing
[1:23:23] so notice what these elements of the
[1:23:25] greatest battle ever fought is the only
[1:23:27] the place that he puts you
[1:23:29] is that you have your mind is the
[1:23:31] battleground so that's really your
[1:23:33] involvement
[1:23:34] amen
[1:23:35] and satan's there
[1:23:37] and the word is there
[1:23:39] and so the fight that's taking place
[1:23:41] you're you're subject to this fight
[1:23:42] you're experiencing the fight but guess
[1:23:44] why there's a fight
[1:23:47] the word is there
[1:23:48] fighting
[1:23:49] there's the bell rang because the holy
[1:23:51] spirit showed up right the fight was on
[1:23:54] and they blew the whistle and they
[1:23:55] kicked off the game and they dropped the
[1:23:57] puck why because the word was there
[1:24:00] and the word is our warrior you've got
[1:24:02] to get the soldier
[1:24:04] soldiers fight
[1:24:06] right you want you want to know why
[1:24:07] there's a fight going on you got a
[1:24:08] soldier there soldiers fight
[1:24:11] and because there's a and the word there
[1:24:13] the soldiers there in the battle in your
[1:24:15] mind
[1:24:16] and he's waging warfare against any
[1:24:18] thought contrary to the word and this
[1:24:20] fight takes place this lag comes up the
[1:24:22] situation comes up all these things come
[1:24:24] and you start engaging in conflict
[1:24:26] invert and realize wait a minute why in
[1:24:28] the world is there a battle to begin
[1:24:29] with why shouldn't i just accept that
[1:24:31] and be happy with it and go along with
[1:24:34] it because there's something raging
[1:24:36] against it
[1:24:38] the word is standing there saying nope
[1:24:40] i'm a fighter i'm not gonna let this
[1:24:41] come in
[1:24:44] exodus 15 3 the lord is a man of war
[1:24:47] the lord is his name notice how it says
[1:24:49] the lord is a man of war if this is the
[1:24:51] greatest battle ever fought the lord is
[1:24:53] there
[1:24:54] he's a part of this he says the lord is
[1:24:56] a man of war says jehovah is a hero in
[1:24:59] battle
[1:25:00] jehovah is always a winner amen never
[1:25:03] lost a battle never been defeated no
[1:25:05] matter how dark it looks or how bad it
[1:25:07] gets and no matter how the world tries
[1:25:08] to twist it and
[1:25:10] and turn it around the god always wins
[1:25:14] just think of how the world would
[1:25:15] describe the death of jesus christ
[1:25:17] hanging there on the cross and how it
[1:25:18] would respond to the disciples how do
[1:25:20] you realize this master this teacher
[1:25:21] look at him
[1:25:23] look how dark this is look how depraved
[1:25:25] this is look how awful this is look what
[1:25:26] kind of death this is but yet it's the
[1:25:28] greatest victory
[1:25:32] isaiah 42 13 the lord shall go forth as
[1:25:35] a mighty man
[1:25:36] he shall stir up jealousy like a man of
[1:25:39] war he shall cry yea roar this is a lion
[1:25:42] roaring he shall prevail against his
[1:25:45] enemies
[1:25:46] the lord is a mighty man of war he is a
[1:25:49] man of war who has this jealousy of
[1:25:51] fervency and a passion he's going to
[1:25:53] roar and he shall
[1:25:54] prevail against his enemies remember
[1:25:56] we're taking this you've got to get the
[1:25:58] soldier the holy spirit placed on the
[1:25:59] battlefront the soldier the holy spirit
[1:26:02] is on the battlefront where's the
[1:26:03] battlefront it's in your mind and this
[1:26:05] is what he is a man of war a mighty man
[1:26:07] one who prevails against his enemies one
[1:26:10] that cannot be defeated
[1:26:13] the battle in your mind is a signal the
[1:26:15] devil's about to lose
[1:26:18] why because the battle is the lord's
[1:26:21] he showed up in your mind not to
[1:26:22] spectate
[1:26:24] he's not there as an observer
[1:26:27] he doesn't have like the red cross
[1:26:28] helmet on or you know sitting there kind
[1:26:30] of looking at everything oh okay well
[1:26:32] let's just i'm just here observing i'm
[1:26:33] neutral
[1:26:34] got the you in helmet on right so
[1:26:36] they're saying we're not involved we're
[1:26:38] not fighting i'm just kind of here
[1:26:40] checking out how mark's doing oh my
[1:26:42] goodness you're getting beat up
[1:26:44] oh man you're really getting him good
[1:26:47] i'm gonna go tell his pastor
[1:26:49] his pastor can can really work him over
[1:26:51] because you're getting no it you're it's
[1:26:53] you're the mind you're sitting there and
[1:26:55] they're just and the and the lord shows
[1:26:57] him he's like let's do this
[1:26:59] he's rolling up his sleeve he says i got
[1:27:00] this brother mark don't worry i got this
[1:27:02] and he's fighting for you
[1:27:04] it said in first samuel 17 47 and all
[1:27:07] this assembly shall know that the lord
[1:27:09] saveth not with sword and spear in other
[1:27:11] words he doesn't save by man's efforts
[1:27:13] for the battle is the lord's and he will
[1:27:15] give you into our hands
[1:27:17] notice what the testimony is it's not
[1:27:19] because we're good with the sword it's
[1:27:20] not because i show up and i'm willing to
[1:27:23] fight but it's the lord's battle and you
[1:27:26] will be delivered into my hands
[1:27:28] these very phrases the lord is a man of
[1:27:30] war the lord is a mighty man he's like a
[1:27:32] man of war he prevails against his
[1:27:33] enemies in this phrase and samuel for
[1:27:35] the battle is the lord just saying the
[1:27:37] events of warfare are holy in god's
[1:27:39] power
[1:27:41] there's not a battle that's taking place
[1:27:42] on this earth that god hasn't permitted
[1:27:45] if he wanted to stop it he'd stop it
[1:27:49] every battle every fight every
[1:27:51] engagement every conflict is under his
[1:27:53] direction
[1:27:54] he allows it if he allows it it's going
[1:27:56] to work some good for god's people
[1:27:58] it is the lord's war amen amen
[1:28:02] so the greatest battle ever fought
[1:28:03] remember we're inverting this we're
[1:28:04] turning it upside down we're wanting to
[1:28:06] look at it from a different perspective
[1:28:07] you've been over there looking at
[1:28:08] working on the greatest battle ever
[1:28:10] fought puzzle
[1:28:11] and what i'm and you're just looking at
[1:28:12] it this way and i'm walking up from the
[1:28:14] opposite direction this morning amen i'm
[1:28:17] saying have you ever thought about it
[1:28:18] this way
[1:28:19] that's right
[1:28:20] and i just want to take it kind of turn
[1:28:21] it around
[1:28:22] just so you can look at it a little bit
[1:28:24] differently because the greatest battle
[1:28:25] ever fought is not you versus satan
[1:28:29] that's right right
[1:28:31] on in this corner
[1:28:33] you know poor wretched miserable you
[1:28:37] on this corner
[1:28:38] the former archangel michael the great
[1:28:40] prince the one who's the this mighty
[1:28:43] conqueror the one that was over here
[1:28:44] doing this and doing that riding forth
[1:28:46] and a white horse and and these
[1:28:47] different just all the ways he's
[1:28:49] described in scriptures and he deceived
[1:28:50] the woman and he actually caused angels
[1:28:52] to fall in heaven and just and now and
[1:28:56] just think of that announcing yeah and
[1:28:58] you're over there going uh
[1:28:59] uh in my 28 years i don't know if i can
[1:29:01] handle this guy who's been doing this
[1:29:02] since before time began
[1:29:06] that's not the battle right amen
[1:29:08] it's not you versus satan in your mind
[1:29:10] but it's god versus satan for your mind
[1:29:13] now tell me who's going to win
[1:29:17] the word versus satan for your mind
[1:29:19] who's going to win
[1:29:22] the word's going to win
[1:29:24] in exodus chapter 14
[1:29:26] verses 13 to 15.
[1:29:31] this is a they're leaving egypt just
[1:29:33] think about how awesome that was we're
[1:29:34] leaving egypt they're taking everything
[1:29:36] they're taking their neighbors gold
[1:29:38] they're they're headed out this is a
[1:29:39] victory after hundreds of years of
[1:29:41] oppression and bondage they're free from
[1:29:43] slavery they're free from sin they're
[1:29:44] free from all their oppressors they're
[1:29:46] going forward and then in this great
[1:29:48] victory they come up against the red sea
[1:29:52] i want you to think about this is we're
[1:29:53] inverting you can think oh man
[1:29:55] was there some lack of planning on god's
[1:29:57] part
[1:29:59] hey
[1:29:59] did i mean didn't you didn't you have
[1:30:01] any kind of premonition at all that this
[1:30:03] was going to happen you're going to run
[1:30:05] out of egypt we're leaving and there's a
[1:30:06] giant ocean there's a red sea that's
[1:30:09] boarding and keeping you from getting to
[1:30:10] where you need to go i mean it seems
[1:30:12] like did you think this through
[1:30:14] well god did
[1:30:16] right
[1:30:18] when god got there he didn't build a
[1:30:20] bridge
[1:30:22] when they got there god hadn't already
[1:30:23] um
[1:30:24] provided some sort of land mass for them
[1:30:26] to get over it
[1:30:28] because i want you to think about it
[1:30:30] if there was a bridge for them to cross
[1:30:32] there was a bridge for their enemy to
[1:30:34] cross
[1:30:36] there was land that they could cover
[1:30:37] there was land for their enemy to cover
[1:30:39] so it says in these verses here and
[1:30:40] moses said unto the people fear ye not
[1:30:43] stand still and see the salvation of the
[1:30:45] lord which he will show to you today for
[1:30:48] the egyptians whom you have seen today
[1:30:51] you shall see them again no more forever
[1:30:55] the lord shall fight for you and ye
[1:30:58] shall hold your peace and the lord said
[1:31:01] unto moses wherefore christ thou unto me
[1:31:03] speak unto the children of israel that
[1:31:06] they go forward
[1:31:08] amen amen what this
[1:31:11] god was saying why are you stopping
[1:31:14] you may hear the church you may see the
[1:31:16] dust you may know your enemy's coming
[1:31:18] you've got a job to do you've got a
[1:31:20] destination don't stop turn around and
[1:31:23] figure out how you're going to fight
[1:31:24] this guy coming after you the battle is
[1:31:27] the lord's you've got one job keep going
[1:31:29] forward and as long as you're in the
[1:31:31] line of duty if something comes up you
[1:31:33] got to worry about that guy but if you
[1:31:35] ever stop and turn around and go back
[1:31:38] you're picking a fight that you don't
[1:31:39] need to fight you're running into a
[1:31:41] fight the guy says i've got this keep
[1:31:43] going leave your past behind move
[1:31:45] forward don't don't retreat don't turn
[1:31:47] around don't go back and pick a fight
[1:31:49] with the devil that's a defeated fall
[1:31:50] that's vanquished they're behind you
[1:31:52] said you see him today you'll see him no
[1:31:54] longer he says keep going
[1:31:56] forward because even this situation the
[1:31:59] fact that they had the enemy bearing
[1:32:00] down on them at the red sea was the
[1:32:02] result of progress not oppression right
[1:32:05] amen
[1:32:06] they were in this battle because of
[1:32:07] progress they were in this battle not in
[1:32:10] in the throes of egyptian bondage but
[1:32:12] they were in this battle because of
[1:32:13] progression they were no longer under
[1:32:15] the oppression they had advanced to the
[1:32:17] red sea and now god arranges this
[1:32:20] terrible moment so that israel
[1:32:23] could have their last conflict with
[1:32:25] egypt
[1:32:26] he says you're not going to see them
[1:32:27] anymore forever amen
[1:32:29] now let's just think about it
[1:32:32] you leave you your people have been in
[1:32:34] bondage for 400 years in slavery
[1:32:36] and god brings you out with the mighty
[1:32:38] hand but you know
[1:32:41] you just left one of the mightiest
[1:32:43] nations in the world with the mighty
[1:32:45] mighty mighty army and chariots and
[1:32:47] horsemen and spears
[1:32:49] and a pharaoh who just lost his son
[1:32:50] because of the vindicated word that came
[1:32:52] into your midst and you go and you cross
[1:32:55] the red sea and then you go and you make
[1:32:57] it into the wilderness and anytime you
[1:32:59] hear a rumble
[1:33:01] you start looking back to the horizon
[1:33:03] did pharaoh finally have enough
[1:33:06] is he coming after me is he coming to
[1:33:08] get me so what does the lord do he says
[1:33:11] i'm going to i'm going to do i'm going
[1:33:12] to provide this
[1:33:14] conflict
[1:33:16] i'm going to bring you to this red sea
[1:33:18] he says speak and go forward
[1:33:20] and what does god do he opens up the red
[1:33:22] sea
[1:33:24] and the children of israel cross on dry
[1:33:26] land
[1:33:27] and then once they're getting across and
[1:33:28] even as it's dramatized in the movie
[1:33:31] that we've
[1:33:32] i think we've all seen the ten
[1:33:33] commandments pharaoh's army is catching
[1:33:35] up
[1:33:36] and it looks like they're going to catch
[1:33:38] him looks like and now what do we do
[1:33:40] what do we do god's like i got to wait
[1:33:42] till the last one gets in
[1:33:44] you got to wait till the last chariot
[1:33:45] get get in here hurry get into the red
[1:33:47] seat now you're
[1:33:48] in and the waves crush their enemy and
[1:33:51] they're able to witness all the chariots
[1:33:53] all the horsemen all the best warriors
[1:33:55] of all egypt are now at the bottom of
[1:33:57] the red sea and i can go forward and
[1:34:00] never have to worry about an egyptian
[1:34:02] chariot coming after me again
[1:34:05] isn't that the beauty and the grace of
[1:34:07] god that he creates this final conflict
[1:34:09] the situation coming don't worry the
[1:34:11] lord's going to fight this one for you
[1:34:12] and he's going to defeat him in such a
[1:34:14] way to where you never have to worry
[1:34:15] about an egyptian horseman again
[1:34:21] when you think about this the fighting
[1:34:23] is not an act of defense
[1:34:25] it's an offensive
[1:34:27] act
[1:34:29] let me use it this way and maybe just
[1:34:31] try to share a few things as we're
[1:34:32] trying to bring this to a close
[1:34:34] it's it's actually an act of you
[1:34:36] enforcing redemption claims
[1:34:40] i said to give it up instead of
[1:34:41] surrendering you're fighting because
[1:34:43] something tells you you have a right to
[1:34:44] that something's telling you that you
[1:34:47] shouldn't have to put up with that
[1:34:49] you should have to go through that you
[1:34:50] should have to deal with that you don't
[1:34:51] have to resign to believe it you don't
[1:34:53] have to accept it you're fighting
[1:34:55] sickness you're fighting doubt you're
[1:34:56] fighting frustration because those
[1:34:58] aren't your promises amen
[1:35:01] and so it's an offensive act of
[1:35:02] enforcing redemption claims
[1:35:05] notice how paul spoke to timothy first
[1:35:07] timothy 1 18 this charge i committed to
[1:35:09] these son timothy
[1:35:11] according to the prophecies that went
[1:35:12] before on thee that thou
[1:35:14] by them mightiest war a good warfare
[1:35:19] the charge that's been committed and the
[1:35:20] prophecies that have went before him he
[1:35:22] is to use to war a good warfare war
[1:35:25] means to make a military expedition to
[1:35:28] lead soldiers to war to war a good
[1:35:30] warfare that means military service to
[1:35:32] wage a war a campaign
[1:35:36] so paul is not telling timothy that look
[1:35:38] be a good administrator
[1:35:43] timothy be good be a good administrator
[1:35:45] in the churches
[1:35:46] he said no this word has been given to
[1:35:48] you this charge i've committed to these
[1:35:49] prophecies that went out before you
[1:35:51] because you are going to be waging war
[1:35:53] you're going to be setting forth on a
[1:35:55] military expedition this is military
[1:35:57] service you're going to be leading
[1:35:58] soldiers to war you are not on the food
[1:36:01] network having a picnic but you are you
[1:36:04] are in this battle and you're leading
[1:36:06] him into war and so you're going to war
[1:36:08] a good warfare and it signals to us this
[1:36:10] is a battle that's why we're given a
[1:36:11] helmet this is the battle that's why
[1:36:13] we're given a sword this is the battle
[1:36:14] that's why we're given a shield and
[1:36:15] that's why all of our armor is armored
[1:36:17] for soldiers who are advancing not
[1:36:19] retreating
[1:36:20] we have nothing to cover our backside
[1:36:22] except god and i'm grateful for that
[1:36:24] because the lord he shall fight your
[1:36:26] battles you go forward i've given you
[1:36:28] the word to go forward i've got you i'm
[1:36:30] covering your weaknesses i'm covering
[1:36:31] your backside if there's an old enemy
[1:36:33] that pops up i'm here to defeat him i'm
[1:36:35] here to bury him in the red sea
[1:36:39] i'm so glad he brings us through it amen
[1:36:42] amen so then bringing us through the red
[1:36:44] sea our enemies are defeated
[1:36:46] not around it or over it
[1:36:48] to keep them alive but destroys them in
[1:36:50] it it picks it back up in chapter 6
[1:36:54] verse 12 fight the good fight of faith
[1:36:55] this is what he's telling timothy to do
[1:36:57] fight the good fight of faith the good
[1:36:59] fight of faith is a fight fight the good
[1:37:01] fight of faith amen my sister said one
[1:37:03] time i'm just fighting the good faith
[1:37:05] it's like no you don't want to fight the
[1:37:06] good fight you want faith you want to
[1:37:08] fight the good fight of faith
[1:37:11] lay hold on eternal life
[1:37:13] whereunto thou are also called and has
[1:37:15] professed a good profession before many
[1:37:17] witnesses fight
[1:37:19] means to enter a contest
[1:37:21] it means to strive to endeavor his to
[1:37:24] contend with adversaries to fight with
[1:37:26] difficulties to to war with dangers
[1:37:30] it's already been we've it's already
[1:37:31] we've already been told beforehand the
[1:37:33] greatest battle ever fought
[1:37:35] it's not do you just get home at the end
[1:37:37] of a long day and laying in your bed and
[1:37:38] it's like oh i'm just whipped i'm all
[1:37:40] beat out and putting cucumbers on her
[1:37:42] eyes
[1:37:44] you know and drinking mint
[1:37:46] tea
[1:37:48] and just saying oh
[1:37:50] boy this is so tough
[1:37:52] this is a battle
[1:37:53] this is a war fight enter a contest
[1:37:55] contend with adversaries fight with
[1:37:57] difficulties war with dangers the good
[1:37:59] fight the good battle to contend fight
[1:38:01] strive endeavor with great zeal against
[1:38:04] enemies fight the good fight i'm an
[1:38:06] endeavor i'm gonna lay hold i'm gonna
[1:38:08] persevere i'm gonna profess
[1:38:10] lay hold it's the act of taking
[1:38:11] possession
[1:38:13] to lay hold of eternity i'm gonna
[1:38:14] overtake i'm going to tame i'm going to
[1:38:16] seize upon with my hands i'm going to
[1:38:18] get dusty with it i'm going to grab a
[1:38:20] hold of it i'm going to fight this fight
[1:38:22] because the battle is the lord's he's
[1:38:23] going to deliver it into my hands i'm
[1:38:25] advancing i'm going forward amen
[1:38:28] second corinthians chapter 10 verses 3
[1:38:30] and 4 for though we walk in the flesh we
[1:38:32] do not war after the flesh
[1:38:36] using a language that soldiers
[1:38:37] understand war
[1:38:39] for the weapons of our warfare so it's
[1:38:41] not just saying it to timothy now he's
[1:38:43] telling the corinthian church the
[1:38:44] weapons of our warfare are not carnal
[1:38:46] but mighty through god
[1:38:48] to the pulling down of strongholds
[1:38:51] we can lay siege on petersburg amen once
[1:38:54] it falls we can advance to richmond amen
[1:38:57] because we have weapons
[1:38:59] that through god can pull down
[1:39:00] strongholds
[1:39:02] strongholds a castle or a fortress
[1:39:04] anything fortifying a position against
[1:39:06] you
[1:39:08] it doesn't matter how fortified a
[1:39:10] position is against you
[1:39:12] you could go to the doctor and the
[1:39:13] doctor could come in

[1:39:17] cheryl doesn't mind good things she's
[1:39:18] not
[1:39:21] all right you could go into the doctor
[1:39:23] and you're waiting for your test results

[1:39:45] buy his stripes i'm healed
[1:39:48] doesn't matter how how big the

[1:39:57] that's interesting
[1:39:59] i've got a weapon that's mighty through
[1:40:01] god to the pooling down of strongholds
[1:40:05] no matter how big how long they've been
[1:40:07] there you could come to me and say
[1:40:08] brother aaron i did a 23andme i did a
[1:40:10] dna test my family's had this problem
[1:40:12] for 4 000 years
[1:40:16] my lineage has been traced back you
[1:40:17] remember that one in the bible had a bad
[1:40:19] temper he's my
[1:40:20] gregory
[1:40:22] grandfather and we've all had tempers
[1:40:25] it doesn't matter hey that's great we've
[1:40:27] got a word that can tear that stronghold
[1:40:29] down
[1:40:30] there's no dna there's no family history
[1:40:32] there's no symptom there's no demon
[1:40:34] possession so great that the word isn't
[1:40:37] more powerful over it
[1:40:40] no matter what it is
[1:40:43] anything fortifying a position against
[1:40:45] you the word can tear down
[1:40:48] praise the lord the greatest battle ever
[1:40:51] fought
[1:40:52] it's a mind battle because god's taking
[1:40:54] back your mind
[1:40:56] he has your soul he wants your mind too
[1:40:58] i mean don't think for a second that god
[1:41:00] was just happy having the soul
[1:41:02] i was like well i've got the soul and
[1:41:03] he's down there in your soul and the
[1:41:05] inside of the inside and the inner man
[1:41:06] looking up at satan chilling in in your
[1:41:09] in your mind
[1:41:11] maxing like michael jackson chilling
[1:41:13] like a villain just hanging out there in
[1:41:15] your mind
[1:41:16] you know just loving it and and and
[1:41:19] god's just happy to kind of be there in
[1:41:20] the soul saying
[1:41:23] i've got the soul
[1:41:25] he took your soul now that your
[1:41:27] salvation is secured he's like let's go
[1:41:28] do work
[1:41:30] i got a job to do let's go further let's
[1:41:32] advance
[1:41:33] and he could have just said hey your
[1:41:35] soul's healed who cares about your body
[1:41:36] being sick he says buy your stripes i'm
[1:41:38] healed what did he do on the cross he
[1:41:40] atoned for every single bit of it
[1:41:44] he didn't just say well i'm purchasing
[1:41:45] your salvation of your soul but by my
[1:41:47] stripes your body is also healed say
[1:41:50] well i'm going through this there's a
[1:41:51] promise i'm going through this there's a
[1:41:53] promise the atonement is for soul spirit
[1:41:55] and body
[1:41:57] you say oh well i'm so alone i'm lonely
[1:41:59] and this happened everyone's rejected me
[1:42:01] and i feel i don't have any close
[1:42:02] friendships and i feel like i don't have
[1:42:04] anyone to love me i feel like i'm not
[1:42:05] part of a family and you can say you
[1:42:07] could look to the atonement where he
[1:42:08] says my god my god why is thou forsaken
[1:42:11] me he even went so far to even achieve
[1:42:14] deliverance and redemption for the
[1:42:16] lonely
[1:42:17] every single aspect every single part of
[1:42:20] it is in the atonement
[1:42:23] because god wants to take your mind amen
[1:42:26] amen brother man the greatest battle of
[1:42:27] fox says restore means to return to the
[1:42:30] former owner
[1:42:31] or to bring back to the former state or
[1:42:33] condition of state of condition
[1:42:36] he says and we can enforce a redemption
[1:42:38] a claim to be restored
[1:42:41] we can enforce a claim to be restored
[1:42:45] therefore any battle that's raging in
[1:42:47] your mind you could look at it as
[1:42:48] evidence of the work of a restoration
[1:42:50] amen every battle is restoration and
[1:42:53] progress you ever go to a museum or you
[1:42:54] go somewhere a historical site and says
[1:42:56] restoration in progress
[1:42:58] i think we've seen some of the
[1:42:59] restorative works of art that have been
[1:43:01] done in europe over the years where
[1:43:02] somebody felt like this painting needs
[1:43:04] to touch up and they completely
[1:43:05] destroyed it
[1:43:07] well
[1:43:08] we're not a work of art that just some
[1:43:10] amateur is going to come by and try to
[1:43:11] touch up the original artist
[1:43:14] the original architect the original
[1:43:15] engineer the one that painted your
[1:43:17] perfect picture is coming along and
[1:43:18] repainting everything the devil's marred
[1:43:20] he was restoring everything this is a
[1:43:22] work of restoration this is taking back
[1:43:24] what was lost
[1:43:26] you say oh i've lost my mind you haven't
[1:43:27] lost your mind god's winning it back
[1:43:29] amen
[1:43:31] you're not going crazy god's winning it
[1:43:32] back you're winning it back fought by
[1:43:34] thought by thought you have a thought
[1:43:36] and whereas before you might have come
[1:43:37] subject to it now every thought is being
[1:43:39] exposed every idea is being exposed
[1:43:41] satan's being exposed you're not losing
[1:43:44] your mind the devil's just trying to
[1:43:45] grab a hold of a part of it a little bit
[1:43:47] more tight a little bit more tight
[1:43:48] because the word is bearing down on it
[1:43:50] and our captain the lord of hosts is
[1:43:52] saying satan your time is up your days
[1:43:55] are over your time of torment your time
[1:43:58] of oppression your time of hiding it's
[1:44:00] coming to an end and the song is bearing
[1:44:03] down upon the devil and then i said no
[1:44:05] no why have you come to torment me
[1:44:07] before my time and the god is safe and
[1:44:10] there is satan you get summer get away
[1:44:12] from him
[1:44:15] he's being exposed and cast out
[1:44:20] the greatest battery of fossils the
[1:44:21] brains of the army lays and its captains
[1:44:23] the intelligence
[1:44:26] well there's our captain the word
[1:44:28] he's the intelligence
[1:44:29] even showing us that the next thing that
[1:44:31] has stepped into this church is the
[1:44:33] intelligence it's christ he himself the
[1:44:35] intelligence that steps down into this
[1:44:36] church that tells me that there's a
[1:44:38] warrior a captain that's on the
[1:44:40] battlefield
[1:44:41] that the the intelligence of the army
[1:44:43] the brains of the army is in the captain
[1:44:46] i've got the soldier the captain christ
[1:44:48] the word on the battleground there's the
[1:44:50] one that knows how to fight
[1:44:53] it wasn't even a fight before you
[1:44:55] couldn't even call it a skirmish you
[1:44:57] couldn't even get a shot off
[1:45:01] what what what happened before the holy
[1:45:03] ghost came
[1:45:04] you just you didn't even have a weapon
[1:45:07] the devil comes and says smoke that and
[1:45:08] stop smoking it
[1:45:11] yeah devil says lust that i'm less
[1:45:12] than
[1:45:13] devil come says doubt that i'm doubting
[1:45:15] it right that's all that ever happened
[1:45:17] right you didn't have a fight
[1:45:19] now that the soul has been regenerated
[1:45:21] now that you're sealed with the holy
[1:45:22] ghost now you have another mind on the
[1:45:23] inside the devil says smoke that and god
[1:45:25] says don't do that you're like i'm not
[1:45:26] going to do it right amen
[1:45:29] now the devil says doubt that there's
[1:45:30] something else inside says believe that
[1:45:31] you're like i'm gonna believe it
[1:45:33] there's something else there and then
[1:45:34] maybe you can get in a battle in a
[1:45:36] wrestling in a fight but realize now
[1:45:37] you've got the captain
[1:45:40] brother man says then he says the thing
[1:45:41] you have to overcome is yourself your
[1:45:44] idea your thing i'm glad you said your
[1:45:46] thing because then whatever your thing
[1:45:47] is it's in there that's right yourself
[1:45:49] your idea your thing and surrender
[1:45:51] yourself to him
[1:45:53] so that there's the outcome to me this
[1:45:55] is just this is how i'm just invert and
[1:45:57] i know i'm looking a little bit
[1:45:58] differently maybe but here's the outcome
[1:46:00] the greatest battle ever fought so we
[1:46:02] picture i'm fighting the devil we're
[1:46:04] going to win this and actually what you
[1:46:07] where the outcome that's determinative
[1:46:09] in this
[1:46:10] is not between you and the devil but
[1:46:11] between you and the lord
[1:46:13] amen
[1:46:14] you're saying just surrender to him
[1:46:17] so we've kind of run out there in the
[1:46:18] battlefield come here devil i got you
[1:46:19] i'm gonna get you come here
[1:46:21] and you're gonna fight the devil
[1:46:23] and the lord's going come here come here
[1:46:27] get back here
[1:46:28] come over here
[1:46:29] that's right you little guy you think
[1:46:31] you can do this come on
[1:46:34] get back here and you're there
[1:46:36] yipping and yapping at the devil and he
[1:46:37] says no surrender to me come back here
[1:46:40] because it's only through christ we're
[1:46:42] taught that we're more than a match for
[1:46:43] the devil amen if we're going to run up
[1:46:45] headlong into a fight with the devils
[1:46:47] and i'll come back here
[1:46:49] what does the scripture say the
[1:46:50] scripture does not just say resist the
[1:46:51] devil and he'll flee what does the whole
[1:46:53] verse say
[1:46:54] submit yourselves therefore to god
[1:46:56] resist the devil and he'll flee the
[1:46:59] success was never your resisting the
[1:47:01] success was your submitting
[1:47:04] resistance without submission is futile
[1:47:07] right and so you have to submit and once
[1:47:10] submitted well then any effort to
[1:47:11] release is not you anymore
[1:47:15] it's the lord
[1:47:17] and so we come back to him and we
[1:47:18] surrender to him
[1:47:20] and we yield to him and he says he
[1:47:22] overcome for you
[1:47:24] overcome yourself your idea overcome
[1:47:26] your thing overcome surrender yourself
[1:47:27] to him he overcome for you he knows the
[1:47:30] way we don't
[1:47:32] i want you to look at it this way if god
[1:47:34] could allow you to do so whatever you're
[1:47:35] going through in your life you can look
[1:47:37] at it i'm battling i'm fighting i'm
[1:47:39] struggling this is a great warfare
[1:47:41] that's taking place
[1:47:42] and say the battle is evidence that the
[1:47:44] captain is on the
[1:47:49] in battlefield events made clear by
[1:47:50] prophecy
[1:47:52] brother brown says but god does his own
[1:47:54] interpreting of his word
[1:47:55] he promised this thing and then he does
[1:47:57] it himself
[1:47:59] he gives himself the interpretation of
[1:48:01] it because he makes himself known in
[1:48:03] that hour
[1:48:04] how far the body of christ is advanced
[1:48:08] from the feet to the head
[1:48:12] think about that would think of what's
[1:48:13] symbolized in that the feet is advanced
[1:48:15] from the feet to the head and he talked
[1:48:18] about the headship coming to the body is
[1:48:19] vindication that the rapture is at hand
[1:48:22] so think about where we are spiritually
[1:48:24] headship
[1:48:25] headstone capstone
[1:48:27] the body of christ is advanced from the
[1:48:29] feet this isn't defeat age this is an
[1:48:31] ankle age this is an elbow age this
[1:48:33] isn't shoulder age this isn't just nose
[1:48:34] or eye age this is the mind
[1:48:37] this is the intelligence stepping into
[1:48:39] that body he says the body of christ is
[1:48:41] advanced think of that advance from the
[1:48:44] feet to the head maybe i'm bringing in
[1:48:46] some of these modern these spiritual
[1:48:48] happenings and these great events that
[1:48:49] have transpired in the open of the word
[1:48:50] so that we can realize make this
[1:48:52] connection that these very truths that
[1:48:54] we hold to be so precious to us they're
[1:48:57] there for our full deliverance and our
[1:49:00] participation in the fullness of the
[1:49:02] atonement and if the body of christ has
[1:49:04] advanced from the feet to the head then
[1:49:06] there's deliverance in your mind there's
[1:49:09] victory in your mind and you're thinking
[1:49:11] for a member of that body
[1:49:13] and it's evidence that the lord has
[1:49:15] advanced from your footsteps of faith to
[1:49:17] possess a point to possess a promise to
[1:49:20] now to the head to where god wants to
[1:49:23] completely deliver
[1:49:26] us brown when he's preaching the breach
[1:49:29] and he's describing the events of
[1:49:30] revelations chapter five
[1:49:33] he says oh would it not be a glorious
[1:49:34] thing if our sinful thoughts tonight
[1:49:36] could be laid aside long enough to
[1:49:38] accept in him
[1:49:40] he says he would advance all the way
[1:49:42] from glory to night
[1:49:44] to make himself known to anyone
[1:49:47] i want you to think i'd taken out some
[1:49:49] of the other statements and things in
[1:49:50] this
[1:49:51] but what i was wanting to point out and
[1:49:53] identify here
[1:49:54] is its advancement
[1:49:56] its progress
[1:49:58] the battle that the children of israel
[1:50:00] faced in exodus chapter 14 was because
[1:50:02] of progress not oppression they had
[1:50:04] advanced to the red sea the enemy was
[1:50:06] pursuing them because they were leaving
[1:50:08] them amen that's when the lord says i'll
[1:50:11] fight for you
[1:50:13] the battle many times is not us wilting
[1:50:16] in the corner being barraged and
[1:50:18] bombarded but it's the word
[1:50:20] leading us
[1:50:22] and we advance to doubt and it chopped
[1:50:24] down we advanced to frustration and
[1:50:26] chopped it down we advanced to sickness
[1:50:28] we chopped it down we've advanced to
[1:50:29] conscience we've chopped it down we're
[1:50:31] advancing
[1:50:33] and look at this type this beautiful
[1:50:35] things this truth that we hold so dear
[1:50:37] the body of christ is advanced from the
[1:50:40] feet to the head
[1:50:42] this isn't retreat this isn't going
[1:50:43] backwards this isn't stagnating and
[1:50:45] being stale and we're being sieged and
[1:50:48] we're being bombarded he says wouldn't
[1:50:49] it be wonderful glorious if he would
[1:50:51] advance
[1:50:52] all the way from glory tonight to make
[1:50:54] himself known to anyone the lamb
[1:50:56] advancing from glory for intercessions
[1:50:59] to make claims now for his redemption
[1:51:03] it's the lamb that purchased your
[1:51:05] redemption
[1:51:07] and he bought it
[1:51:09] through the shedding of his blood
[1:51:11] but he's declared to be what
[1:51:13] when he advances to take possession of
[1:51:15] it
[1:51:16] not a lamb but a lion amen
[1:51:18] revelations 5 5 and one of the elders
[1:51:20] seth and me weep not
[1:51:22] behold the lion
[1:51:24] of the tribe of judah
[1:51:26] the use of lion what is the bible says
[1:51:28] he's going to roar
[1:51:29] he roars he shall prevail against his
[1:51:32] enemies he's like a man of war he shall
[1:51:33] go forth as a mighty man we think oh
[1:51:35] he's a lamb he's a lamb he's a lamb that
[1:51:37] was slain and and we're and we kind of
[1:51:39] keep that image in our mind but the
[1:51:41] announcement is not just this meek
[1:51:43] bloody lamb but it's the lion of the
[1:51:45] tribe of judah he's roared he's a mighty
[1:51:48] man he's prevailed against his enemies
[1:51:50] the lion hath prevailed the root of
[1:51:52] david half prevailed that means
[1:51:53] conquered
[1:51:55] have prevailed his game the victory hath
[1:51:57] prevailed overcome all obstacles all
[1:52:00] difficulties everything vanquished have
[1:52:02] prevailed to open the book and to loose
[1:52:05] the seals thereof
[1:52:06] when he advances he prevails when he
[1:52:09] advances he completely brings under
[1:52:11] subjection when he advances he conquers
[1:52:13] when he advances he gains the complete
[1:52:15] victory and this is how paul can say you
[1:52:17] are more than a conqueror because the
[1:52:19] lion of the tribe of judah who became
[1:52:21] the bloody lamb to purchase your
[1:52:22] redemption has now taken possession of
[1:52:25] it and then handed it to you amen amen
[1:52:29] that's what it means to be more than a
[1:52:30] conqueror
[1:52:32] you just yielded to him and he fought
[1:52:33] the battle for you he's victorious
[1:52:37] brother bram says here come a lamb this
[1:52:38] is in the breach been slain and come
[1:52:40] forth oh my what to make his claims on
[1:52:44] his redemption
[1:52:45] its redemption means all legal
[1:52:47] possession to all that was lost by adam
[1:52:50] and eve
[1:52:51] i think that they had a time when they
[1:52:53] had clear minds
[1:52:56] they had a clean conscience they had joy
[1:52:58] they had perfect love they had happiness
[1:53:00] oh my what ought that to do to a
[1:53:02] born-again christian
[1:53:05] it's legal possession to the abstract
[1:53:06] deed the title deed of eternal life
[1:53:08] means that you possess everything that
[1:53:10] adam and eve lost
[1:53:13] everything
[1:53:15] you want to know the depth of satan well
[1:53:17] just know the depths of god first amen
[1:53:19] inverting it
[1:53:22] and then he's saying that with the title
[1:53:23] d the abstract legal possession to the
[1:53:25] abstract the title deed of eternal life
[1:53:27] means that you possess everything that
[1:53:29] adam and eve lost
[1:53:32] it's your rightful possession
[1:53:34] so instead of us now thinking
[1:53:38] that when we go through a mind battle
[1:53:40] and we fight and we war
[1:53:43] and we think that the devil
[1:53:45] is trying to rob our peace and take our
[1:53:48] joy and get something from us
[1:53:51] you're taking it back from him
[1:53:54] he doesn't have the upper hand on you he
[1:53:56] hasn't outflanked you he doesn't he's
[1:53:58] not going to try to trick you we
[1:54:00] recognize the devil in all of his tricks
[1:54:02] amen that's what overcome means to
[1:54:04] recognize the devil in every single
[1:54:05] every one of his tricks and at the same
[1:54:07] time recognize that greater is he that
[1:54:09] is in me than he that is in the world
[1:54:10] and has already overcome him amen so
[1:54:13] when i come into this battle i don't
[1:54:15] want to so much think that oh i was just
[1:54:17] over here minding my own business and
[1:54:18] also the devil's trying to reach in and
[1:54:20] grab my joy turn it around
[1:54:23] you've got more joy of yours to have
[1:54:25] and so you're going over to that devil
[1:54:27] and you're taking all your joy
[1:54:29] out of his dirty grubby hands and you're
[1:54:31] taking it back
[1:54:33] he ain't robbing anything you've got
[1:54:35] you're getting more back
[1:54:38] because you're possessing everything
[1:54:39] that adam and eve lost
[1:54:41] the battle then
[1:54:43] is evidence
[1:54:44] that redemption's claims
[1:54:46] are being enforced
[1:54:48] he says you have a right to enforce a
[1:54:50] claim to be restored
[1:54:54] i'm closed with this statement
[1:54:56] from the greatest battle ever fought
[1:54:58] i went a little bit longer than i
[1:55:00] intended but
[1:55:01] he says we got a five-star general
[1:55:03] spelled j-e-s-u-s
[1:55:07] that awesome yeah five-star general can

[1:56:41] more peace god wants me to have more joy
[1:56:44] god wants me to have more health the
[1:56:46] battle is evidence of victory the fact
[1:56:48] that i'm fighting is not because i'm
[1:56:50] being attacked but because the word is
[1:56:52] attacking the adversary
[1:56:56] and the battle is raging because the
[1:56:58] word is the aggressor
[1:56:59] and has brought the war to the devil
[1:57:02] and the fight is on
[1:57:04] could we bow our heads please
[1:57:12] i i there's so much that could be said
[1:57:14] and
[1:57:15] expressed and maybe even your own
[1:57:17] personal sentiments in whatever you're
[1:57:19] going through
[1:57:20] but the things that are articulated even
[1:57:22] in that sermon the greatest battle ever
[1:57:23] fought he says you just have to
[1:57:24] surrender to him
[1:57:26] and i want to invite you today that if
[1:57:28] you're in a battle
[1:57:29] and in this greatest battle ever fought
[1:57:31] i'm not even speaking generally but i
[1:57:32] want to speak very specifically if
[1:57:34] you're in a battle if you're in a war
[1:57:35] then i want to invite you to stand and
[1:57:37] surrender to him
[1:57:40] you're not surrendered to the devil
[1:57:42] you're not you're not indicating to the
[1:57:43] devil that you're done fighting
[1:57:46] you're indicating that i'm surrendering
[1:57:48] to the chief captain
[1:57:51] and i'm gonna ask and pray that he
[1:57:52] placed five stars on you today
[1:57:54] f-a-i-t-h faith
[1:57:57] as you stand to your feet many are
[1:57:58] standing
[1:58:00] and i believe you're standing in your
[1:58:02] hearts because you want to surrender to
[1:58:03] him whatever it is you're going through
[1:58:05] we're not giving you all these tips and
[1:58:07] tricks on how to beat the devil we're
[1:58:08] just saying surrender to him yeah
[1:58:12] yield to him today
[1:58:15] if we could just all stand together i'd
[1:58:17] like to pray for you our gracious

[1:58:46] place upon us of five stars
[1:58:48] of faith

[1:58:53] maybe straighten it out a little bit
[1:58:56] pat us on the back lord
[1:58:59] call to our names
[1:59:02] maybe we've run headlong into unbelief
[1:59:04] and doubt and sin not because we were
[1:59:05] going forward but because we were
[1:59:06] running backwards
[1:59:09] then we come back to you today
[1:59:11] may we not make the mistake that we've
[1:59:13] made before that whenever our
[1:59:14] convictions were stirred up we wanted to
[1:59:16] roll up our sleeves and we gritted our
[1:59:18] teeth and said we were going to go fight
[1:59:19] the devil
[1:59:20] no lord may we finally just surrender to
[1:59:22] you amen
