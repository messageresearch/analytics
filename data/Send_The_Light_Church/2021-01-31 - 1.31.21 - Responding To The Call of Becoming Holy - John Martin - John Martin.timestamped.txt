[35:42] the lord want lord the holy ghost we all
[35:45] want to
[35:45] please you i want to fulfill
[35:48] this scripture and be holy lord but we
[35:52] can't do this on our own
[35:54] lord we can't even understand what it
[35:58] means to be holy without you revealing
[36:00] it to us
[36:02] we pray today that the holy spirit would
[36:05] move amongst us
[36:06] not in the reasoning of our minds so
[36:09] much but in the
[36:10] in our hearts meet with us lord reveal
[36:13] this precious word to us
[36:15] and lord give us the grace to fulfill
[36:19] the desire in our heart to be more like
[36:21] you
[36:23] and if holiness is what we're lacking in
[36:26] holiness is what we're desiring lord
[36:29] if we're out of order we want to be in
[36:31] order
[36:33] i also pray lord that you would
[36:37] bless all the other needs that there
[36:40] would be in our lives lord
[36:43] father for we come to our heavenly
[36:45] father
[36:46] one who is able to meet needs that our
[36:48] natural father just cannot do
[36:52] lord you said in your word that you
[36:54] would do exceedingly above all that we
[36:56] would ask or even think
[36:58] for we serve almighty god today
[37:02] we humbly ask that you would give us
[37:05] faith
[37:05] to take this word that you give us lord
[37:08] today
[37:09] and apply it to our lives that we might
[37:12] manifest it lord in this late hour
[37:16] for as lord we know it's getting darker
[37:18] and darker the news is getting worse and
[37:20] worse
[37:23] but we've come this morning to hear the
[37:25] good news
[37:27] that we might be encouraged and
[37:29] strengthened and know that lord that you
[37:31] have provided
[37:32] a way for your your people that have
[37:34] chosen
[37:35] the straight neural path
[37:38] we commit ourselves to you today we
[37:40] commit ours
[37:42] our spirits our souls this service
[37:45] into your hands might you receive honor
[37:47] and glory in each one of our lives as we
[37:49] glorify you and receive your word today
[37:52] for we ask it in jesus christ's name
[37:54] amen
[37:55] amen god bless you you may be seated
[37:58] thank you for your long standing
[38:05] um last sunday
[38:09] we ministered on the call of becoming
[38:12] holy
[38:13] the call god has a call that goes out
[38:16] how
[38:17] is recognizing god calling you
[38:21] to become more holy amen amen amen
[38:25] i know in our men's meeting we were able
[38:27] there was a number of testimonies
[38:30] that even though this all has
[38:33] stemmed off of church order um
[38:36] so many of us god has been revealing to
[38:39] us
[38:40] that in order to have church order we
[38:42] have to have order
[38:43] in our lives amen it starts with our
[38:47] lives because
[38:49] this church is a culmination of what we
[38:52] are
[38:52] in our homes what we are in our lives
[38:56] and when our lives can become more
[38:59] pleasing than we can
[39:01] uh uh respect god's house more amen
[39:05] the bible says as he which have called
[39:08] you is holy so be ye
[39:10] holy in all manner of conversation
[39:13] meaning
[39:14] behavior for it is written be holy for i
[39:17] am holy now that's a
[39:18] a very tall order as it were and we
[39:20] cannot do that in ourselves
[39:22] but that's why god gives us the holy
[39:24] ghost
[39:25] and the realness of god's spirit lives
[39:27] in us then we can do
[39:29] all things through christ amen this
[39:32] morning
[39:32] we like to entitle this message
[39:34] responding to the call
[39:37] of becoming holy so the call was
[39:41] as it were last sunday and we want to
[39:43] respond to that call and for a subject
[39:44] bringing
[39:45] order to our lives and we got a lot of
[39:47] quotes that we're going to be
[39:49] uh speaking of here uh later in the
[39:52] service but
[39:54] last sunday our subject was entering
[39:57] into
[39:58] his holiness and becoming holy entering
[40:01] into his holiness
[40:02] we've heard you know going to church
[40:04] doesn't make you a christian
[40:06] if it did then going into a bar would
[40:07] make you a horse
[40:10] but there is something that transpires
[40:13] when you enter
[40:14] god's holiness as we recognize the holy
[40:18] spirit is dealing with us
[40:19] and we don't harden our heart we will
[40:22] become
[40:22] more holy amen now i'm not
[40:26] speaking more of a long-term effect
[40:34] it will happen in a long-term effect if
[40:36] your seed
[40:38] because every seed brings forth of its
[40:40] own kind
[40:42] but if you're not then the change that
[40:44] happens will be
[40:45] short-term it's limited
[40:49] but i want to say this that you cannot
[40:51] stand in the presence
[40:53] of holiness and it not be affecting you
[40:57] even in short term
[40:59] [Music]
[41:02] isaiah did not have a choice
[41:07] he didn't say i'm not used to this i'm
[41:09] not
[41:11] you know what i just i don't think i'm
[41:12] going to partake in this
[41:14] this holiness he was faced
[41:18] with on how unholy was
[41:21] and uh i think it's okay to come to
[41:24] church
[41:25] and to enter into a place with a faith
[41:27] and believing that god is so much in
[41:29] that place
[41:30] that it causes you to respect god more
[41:33] amen
[41:37] holiness can be all around you and you
[41:39] not even know it
[41:41] not even feel it not even sense it
[41:45] because it has to do with his holy
[41:48] presence
[41:49] meeting you in your heart and not your
[41:51] flesh not your mind
[41:52] not your reasoning not your senses but
[41:55] it's inside
[41:57] isaiah chapter 57 verse 15 says for thus
[42:01] saith the high and lofty one
[42:04] the one that inhabits eternity whose
[42:06] name is holy
[42:09] i dwell in the high and holy place
[42:13] with him also that is of a contrite and
[42:17] humble spirit see where god's meeting
[42:19] you
[42:19] in your spirit in your spirit that's why
[42:23] you got a deep
[42:24] go deep inside when you come to church
[42:27] you got to enter in you got to prepare
[42:29] because god meets you in your spirit
[42:34] and it has to be a humble spirit it
[42:36] can't be a proud spirit it can't be an
[42:38] arrogant spirit
[42:39] it can't be an i know it all spirit it
[42:41] has to be a contrite humble spirit to
[42:44] revive the spirit of the humble to
[42:45] revive the heart
[42:46] of the contrite ones that's where god's
[42:49] holiness
[42:50] dwells and god promised to meet you
[42:52] right there
[42:54] you don't got to be rich you don't got
[42:58] to know god for 10 years
[43:00] you just got to come with the right
[43:02] spirit to church
[43:04] and you will meet god's holiness
[43:09] notice it's not a holy person
[43:12] but a humble person because
[43:15] holiness will come holiness will come to
[43:17] you
[43:18] our nature is not to be holy
[43:22] our our nature is to be unholy
[43:25] but a humble spirit will allow the holy
[43:27] spirit in
[43:29] someone who has allowed their pride to
[43:31] be crushed
[43:33] contrite god's spirit will come in
[43:37] did not jesus say learned of me for i am
[43:39] meek
[43:40] and lowly learn of me
[43:44] god's nature is meek and lowly a humble
[43:46] person
[43:47] will become more holy when we humble
[43:50] ourselves
[43:51] and give the holy spirit liberty his
[43:53] holiness
[43:55] can have its way inside of us it will
[43:57] affect us it will affect our life
[44:00] but it must go through the channel
[44:03] of free more agency first
[44:07] it just has to we have to want it a lot
[44:11] in other words we all want it
[44:13] but we've got to want it a lot
[44:16] holiness has to do with his presence
[44:19] meeting
[44:20] inside of us now i've said it and i just
[44:22] want it to register
[44:24] and i know it's hard because revelation
[44:26] can only come from the lord
[44:29] not just around our bodies but inside of
[44:31] our hearts we need to invite him
[44:33] inside to take a boat inside the
[44:36] holiness
[44:36] has to come in here not our minds not
[44:39] our thoughts
[44:41] but inside our hearts it has to do with
[44:44] the desire
[44:47] john 14 verse 19 saint john 14 verse 19
[44:51] yet oh a little while and the world
[44:54] seeth me no more the way this world is
[44:57] going
[44:59] it just going its head right to hell
[45:02] it's becoming more and more like hell
[45:04] the shows are becoming more
[45:06] and more like and now it sits down at
[45:07] such as fast pace
[45:12] yet a little while and the world sees me
[45:14] no more but ye
[45:16] see me because i live you shall live
[45:19] also
[45:20] at that day there is a day
[45:24] that you shall know that i am in the
[45:27] father
[45:28] and you and me and i in you
[45:32] so in order to see god's holiness it's
[45:35] going to be
[45:36] inside of us there's a meeting place
[45:39] it's not out here in the learning curve
[45:42] it's not a school this is not a school
[45:45] building
[45:46] there's not a professor up here it's not
[45:49] somebody with degrees
[45:52] amen
[45:56] when we consider our bodies being the
[45:58] tabernacle of god the sanctuary of god
[46:01] remember the tabernacle was in three
[46:04] parts
[46:05] and god dwelt on the inside of the
[46:08] inside amen
[46:10] exodus chapter 25 verse 22
[46:13] exodus chapter 25 verse 22 and there
[46:16] and there i will meet with thee it
[46:20] wasn't on the outside
[46:22] wasn't in the holy place it was in the
[46:24] most holy place
[46:27] and there i will meet with thee and i
[46:28] will commune with thee from above the
[46:30] mercy seat
[46:32] and from between the two cherubims which
[46:34] are upon the ark
[46:35] of the testimony of all the things which
[46:38] i give thee in commandment
[46:41] unto the children of israel so god wants
[46:44] to reveal
[46:45] his holiness to us in our heart but if
[46:47] we say no
[46:48] not no thank you you know i'm going to
[46:50] just kind of do my own thing live my own
[46:51] life and
[46:52] you know just call the shots well then
[46:54] you know god isn't going to meet that
[46:57] there's not a chance of giving
[46:59] revelation there's only a chance of
[47:01] bringing more confusion to your mind
[47:04] and trying to figure out that there's
[47:06] another way to serve god
[47:07] and not have to go this way there is no
[47:09] other way
[47:12] i'm just i'm trying to express that if
[47:16] we really want to get a hold of the
[47:17] reality
[47:19] of order and holiness we we've got to
[47:22] invite god
[47:23] inside
[47:27] as we continually come in contact with
[47:29] god's holiness inside of us we will
[47:31] undoubtedly change
[47:34] we're going to walk away with his
[47:36] commandments just like
[47:38] when god met moses and he walked away
[47:41] with god's commandments and then moses
[47:45] told the people the the children of
[47:48] israel
[47:49] so did god in this
[47:52] age send a messenger amen with the word
[47:56] for the
[47:56] church in this age to make a rapture
[48:00] all the commandments of god
[48:07] and we need to receive them second
[48:10] corinthians chapter 3 verse 15.
[48:12] second corinthians chapter 3 verse 15
[48:15] but
[48:16] even unto this day
[48:19] when moses is red the veil
[48:22] is upon their heart so this is what i'm
[48:25] saying
[48:26] you can have a veil right here in your
[48:27] heart and in your mind
[48:29] be intellectually thinking about what's
[48:32] being spoken
[48:33] and not even hear from god not even
[48:36] not even see god not even know god it's
[48:39] like sitting in watching some youtube
[48:41] video
[48:45] because it's here there's a veil here
[48:48] and this this veil is your desire
[48:51] you've got to open it up you got to say
[48:53] lord come inside
[48:56] you're in charge of that veil god will
[49:00] not come down
[49:01] and rip your heart open and say i'm
[49:03] coming in he's a gentleman
[49:05] he would never do that he didn't do it
[49:06] to lucifer he won't do it to you
[49:09] he'll do it to nobody on the day of
[49:11] judgment those that make
[49:12] were those that said lord come in and
[49:14] those that didn't make and say lord i
[49:16] didn't want anything to do with you
[49:18] and he says okay
[49:22] nevertheless when it shall turn to the
[49:25] lord notice
[49:26] your heart being turned towards the lord
[49:29] the veil
[49:30] shall be taken away now the lord is that
[49:33] spirit
[49:34] and where the spirit of the lord is
[49:35] there is liberty
[49:38] you give you give liberty right here in
[49:41] your heart
[49:41] the lord is in your heart you give
[49:43] liberty up here in your mind you just
[49:45] think about whatever you want to think
[49:46] about
[49:49] but we now look at what happens when you
[49:50] come into the presence of the lord but
[49:52] we all
[49:53] with open face be holding us in the
[49:54] glass the glory of the lord are
[49:56] changed amen are changed into the same
[50:00] image
[50:02] from glory to glory even by the spirit
[50:05] of the lord
[50:06] every time we come into the presence of
[50:08] the holy ghost the glory of god
[50:10] and we give god liberty we are promised
[50:13] the word promises
[50:15] that we will be changed
[50:22] we've all experienced how hard it is
[50:25] trying to live the word
[50:27] outside of the holy ghost
[50:31] it's a burden too heavy to carry you try
[50:34] and you get discouraged and you can't do
[50:36] it and the devil knocks you down and he
[50:38] says see you're not a christian
[50:40] and it goes on and on and on and on and
[50:42] the thing is
[50:44] we just want to seek the holy ghost
[50:46] because god has
[50:47] power god has power to make these bones
[50:50] live
[50:53] we don't have to try to do it we just
[50:56] need to seek the holy ghost let him in
[50:58] that's what holy get it ghost
[51:03] it's holy already it doesn't try to get
[51:06] holy
[51:10] there's a song course we sing often when
[51:12] i look
[51:13] into god's holiness when i when i gaze
[51:17] into his loveliness
[51:19] when all things that surround me become
[51:22] shadows
[51:22] in the light of you when i found the joy
[51:26] of reaching your heart
[51:29] when my will becomes enthralled in your
[51:32] love now
[51:33] for some reason
[51:36] it's sung it's in the words is when my
[51:40] will becomes enthroned in your love and
[51:42] i'll tell you i don't
[51:43] want my will thrown
[51:46] in god
[51:50] because it will corrupt god's love
[51:53] anything
[51:54] anything of my will
[51:57] it must die to god's will we may want to
[52:01] change that
[52:02] when my will becomes enthralled
[52:06] in your love now that word enthralled
[52:09] means i am captivated by and submitted
[52:14] to god's love
[52:17] and when our our will becomes uh
[52:20] captivated by god's love and submitted
[52:22] to god's love
[52:23] when all things that surround me becomes
[52:26] shadows in the light of you
[52:27] then we can worship god properly in
[52:30] spirit
[52:30] and in truth
[52:40] what kind of son would i be if only time
[52:42] i want to reach god's heart is if i want
[52:44] something
[52:48] i need something
[52:51] i mean i'm okay with that
[52:54] but it's time to grow up it's time to
[52:57] let her husband be our husband of our
[52:59] life
[53:00] it's time to let him call the shots in
[53:03] her life
[53:06] now our carnal nature can look at this
[53:10] church order as legalistic
[53:15] or this is the law of this church it's
[53:18] do's and don'ts of the church
[53:21] the carnal nature will look at this as
[53:23] it's not
[53:24] that necessary
[53:29] but the nature of the holy spirit simply
[53:32] doesn't want things
[53:33] out of order and we just need to come to
[53:37] grips
[53:38] with the realization that this isn't
[53:41] church
[53:42] order it's god's order in the church
[53:48] just like it's not the acts
[53:51] of the apostles it's the acts of the
[53:54] holy ghost in the apostles
[53:58] in 1963 it was a very special year for
[54:02] brother branham's ministry
[54:05] he preached mighty messages he preached
[54:08] the message absolute three times
[54:13] he preached god hiding himself in
[54:15] simplicity and revealing himself
[54:17] the same he preached the breached he
[54:20] preached the seven seals
[54:23] and then he preached god hiding himself
[54:25] in simplicity again
[54:26] showing that we don't want to miss god
[54:29] we may think this is not a big thing we
[54:31] want to get onto things that make us
[54:33] feel good
[54:33] things that you know we feel like get us
[54:35] ready for the rapture he preached
[54:38] standing in the gap
[54:40] the flashing red lights of his coming
[54:44] the third exodus humble they sell paul a
[54:48] prisoner of jesus christ
[54:50] he preached he cares do you care he
[54:52] preached that great message
[54:54] christ the mystery of god revealed he
[54:57] preached how can i overcome
[54:59] he preached perfect faith the token
[55:02] which he said was the highlight of his
[55:04] ministry he preached desperation
[55:07] the souls that are in prison he preached
[55:09] three kinds of believers
[55:12] he preached that message why little
[55:13] bethlehem these were mighty
[55:16] messages and then
[55:19] he preached church order
[55:22] and then he preached church order
[55:30] the church of god's prophet was out of
[55:32] order
[55:36] the very next message that he preached
[55:38] after church order was
[55:40] there's a man that could turn on the
[55:42] light
[55:44] and he turned on the light of church
[55:47] order
[55:50] brother brahman said in that message
[55:52] church order he said
[55:53] it he's speaking of his church he said
[55:56] it is one of the most spiritual places
[55:59] was his church he'd been to a lot of
[56:01] churches a lot of places
[56:03] but his church was one of the most
[56:05] spiritual places
[56:07] yet it was out of order think about what
[56:10] i'm saying
[56:13] order can have nothing to do with how
[56:16] spiritual it is
[56:19] i'm just trying to get us to open our
[56:21] eyes
[56:24] brother branham says it's been a long
[56:25] time a long prayer of mine
[56:28] and i and a desire sense a boy
[56:31] to see the church put in order and
[56:35] kept in order now when we dedicated
[56:39] the church i told you a little later
[56:43] now this is two years now before he
[56:45] passes away
[56:47] a little later that i had something to
[56:49] talk to you about
[56:50] how to set this thing in order the way
[56:53] that it should be run
[56:56] and you started off after leaving here
[56:59] we had ministers and so forth
[57:02] so there was people that came and go but
[57:05] now brother neville
[57:07] being just young among us come
[57:10] among us i thought it'd be better for
[57:12] brother neville to get
[57:14] better established in the faith before i
[57:16] presented such things
[57:18] as i'm about to do now
[57:22] but now after i find out
[57:25] that he is getting well established in
[57:27] the faith and he understands what
[57:29] doctrine is
[57:31] and has played the part of a faithful
[57:33] witness to christ
[57:35] and holding for what we believe to be
[57:38] the truth i think it's
[57:41] the hour and now would be a good time
[57:45] to approach him and among you elders and
[57:48] things here in the church that you
[57:50] would take these orders and remember
[57:53] them that the best of my knowledge
[57:54] before god
[57:56] and i'm looking to you
[57:59] to carry these things out the way that
[58:03] i'm saying them
[58:04] because somebody's got to be the head
[58:06] around here
[58:09] we just want to carry out
[58:12] what was spoken
[58:16] amen
[58:19] this church order wasn't preached the
[58:21] first year of his ministry
[58:24] and you really didn't know everything
[58:25] didn't know what he was talking about
[58:27] and you know that's not how he felt
[58:28] later in his ministry
[58:31] i just want to squash out any thoughts
[58:34] that we may have
[58:36] of the importance of having church order
[58:38] this is not
[58:39] carnal church order is not legalistic
[58:44] it may be to a carnal mind but it is not
[58:47] to a spiritual mind
[58:48] it is the order of god amen
[58:52] and we need to keep it that way
[59:00] two years before god took him off the
[59:02] scene the holy spirit led him
[59:04] to make the church more holy
[59:08] is what he was doing not more spiritual
[59:12] more holy
[59:16] so god taught the church his order
[59:20] it wasn't brother branham teaching his
[59:21] order
[59:23] it was god teaching the church his order
[59:26] and brother branson said that she says
[59:28] you go back to this tape
[59:30] and play it before service if somebody
[59:34] isn't listening
[59:37] now you certainly don't want me to be
[59:40] playing parts of the tape here
[59:42] before service because you know how long
[59:44] our services can be
[59:47] so we want to take this thing seriously
[59:53] god is teaching us order here and this
[59:55] order that he's teaching us here
[59:57] if we respond to the call it will change
[1:00:00] us
[1:00:02] god is in the business of changing us
[1:00:05] now our carnal nature doesn't want to
[1:00:08] suffer
[1:00:08] enough to change now that's the battle
[1:00:12] brother branham taught us that we have
[1:00:14] to lay in the presence of the
[1:00:16] s-o-n and get ripened
[1:00:19] is that what he said that's why
[1:00:22] our hearts invite his presence in here
[1:00:28] we have to let this this heart lay in
[1:00:30] the presence
[1:00:31] not our mind not our reasoning
[1:00:34] i mean if we're completely out of it yes
[1:00:37] come
[1:00:37] let us reason together got to get our
[1:00:40] attention
[1:00:41] but if we've accepted the word that you
[1:00:44] open your heart and you lay there in the
[1:00:46] presence
[1:00:46] and god will reveal his word to you
[1:00:50] any natural seed cannot be ripened
[1:00:54] by just a picture of a son
[1:01:00] and we're showing me i believe it was
[1:01:02] yesterday this picture of the sun
[1:01:04] so beautiful
[1:01:07] but it was just a picture
[1:01:11] the sun has light
[1:01:15] and heat that germinates the seed
[1:01:20] and a picture doesn't give that
[1:01:25] and coming into a church
[1:01:28] sitting in a natural a natural church
[1:01:33] naturally listening to the word
[1:01:37] is not going to germinate a spiritual
[1:01:39] seed
[1:01:44] warmth comes from your heart he said
[1:01:46] i'll meet you there you've got to be in
[1:01:48] love with jesus
[1:01:49] you've got to say lord i'm interested in
[1:01:52] what's being spoken
[1:01:55] i hear the call i'm responding to the
[1:01:57] call
[1:01:58] let let the light of your word be
[1:02:01] revealed to me
[1:02:06] i'll tell you the seed inside will begin
[1:02:08] to change you
[1:02:10] change your life
[1:02:15] but just come to church and listening
[1:02:18] you'll be here for years and never
[1:02:20] change and yet in the presence of god
[1:02:23] because
[1:02:23] you've got to get the presence here
[1:02:25] you've got to get real with god you got
[1:02:27] to be willing to be broken you got to be
[1:02:28] willing to cry out you got to be willing
[1:02:30] to
[1:02:30] open up take the veil off and say lord
[1:02:33] jesus come into me
[1:02:35] come in lord come in amen
[1:02:40] jesus said my words are spirit and their
[1:02:42] life
[1:02:43] but if they're up here they're here i'm
[1:02:46] telling you it's just a dead letter
[1:02:49] it won't change a thing in your home it
[1:02:52] won't change a thing in your life
[1:02:53] it won't change a thing in your
[1:02:54] relationship it won't change a thing in
[1:02:56] your prayer walk
[1:02:57] it won't change a thing but when that
[1:03:00] word becomes living
[1:03:02] it becomes real to you
[1:03:05] you know you may not feel it right this
[1:03:07] minute i'm okay with that but i'm not
[1:03:09] okay with an attitude that says
[1:03:11] lord i guess it's just not for me
[1:03:13] because i don't feel it
[1:03:14] you to step in and say god i want this i
[1:03:17] want this lord
[1:03:20] something inside of every one of you
[1:03:22] sitting here this morning
[1:03:23] but something is there's bearing witness
[1:03:26] that this word is the truth
[1:03:27] if it's not you wouldn't be here
[1:03:32] so we've already crossed the line
[1:03:36] we've already called out this is god now
[1:03:40] open your heart to it
[1:03:44] be changed be changed in other words
[1:03:48] let the scriptures ring loud harden not
[1:03:51] your heart
[1:03:53] let your heart be hardened
[1:03:56] because god can't god can't do that he
[1:03:58] can't work through that
[1:04:02] we've got to let the word inside
[1:04:05] it'll change it'll change you we've got
[1:04:08] to meet god
[1:04:09] inside our our hearts not our heads but
[1:04:12] our hearts
[1:04:13] that's how we respond to the call of
[1:04:15] god's holiness
[1:04:18] truly holy true holiness is not putting
[1:04:20] on a dress
[1:04:22] for women it's not cutting
[1:04:25] hair in men
[1:04:31] because there's a lot of men out there
[1:04:33] that have short hair
[1:04:37] and i don't think they know what the
[1:04:38] word holy means
[1:04:41] and i believe that there's women out
[1:04:43] there that have a dress on
[1:04:46] that don't know how to act
[1:04:52] holiness if we meet god inside our
[1:04:56] hearts he will lead us to become holy
[1:05:00] he will lead us to put a dress on he
[1:05:03] will lead us
[1:05:04] our brothers to to cut their hair
[1:05:08] because that's the job of the holy ghost
[1:05:11] god's not up in heaven with a bunch of
[1:05:14] do's and don'ts
[1:05:17] oh yeah here's someone coming to me oh
[1:05:19] yeah
[1:05:20] make sure i'm going to lead them to cut
[1:05:23] their hair
[1:05:24] here's a there's a woman i'm going to
[1:05:26] lead her to
[1:05:27] put a dress on it's not do's and don'ts
[1:05:33] god is leading his children to become
[1:05:35] holy
[1:05:37] god is holy he wants us to become holy
[1:05:40] not do's and don'ts not rules not
[1:05:42] regulations
[1:05:44] but to become holy in other words
[1:05:47] it's the heart and desire of god for
[1:05:50] each one of us
[1:05:51] to be like he is
[1:05:57] and if we don't start saying amen more
[1:05:59] i'm going to start saying amen to my
[1:06:00] preaching you don't want that do you
[1:06:05] first peter chapter 3 verse 1
[1:06:11] likewise he wives be subject to your own
[1:06:14] husbands
[1:06:16] that if any obey not the word they
[1:06:19] also may without the word
[1:06:23] be won by the conversation of the wives
[1:06:27] isn't that beautiful
[1:06:32] in other words a woman doesn't need to
[1:06:35] preach the gospel
[1:06:36] with her lips because that word
[1:06:39] conversation
[1:06:40] means behavior it means behavior
[1:06:44] it's the same word that's used in first
[1:06:46] timothy chapter 3 verse 15
[1:06:49] but if i tarry long that thou mayest
[1:06:52] know how
[1:06:53] thou altest behave thyself
[1:06:56] in the church of god which is
[1:07:00] the church of the living god the pillar
[1:07:02] and the ground
[1:07:04] of the truth
[1:07:09] behavior
[1:07:12] it means more than just
[1:07:17] how you act in church it's more
[1:07:20] than just what you speak
[1:07:24] but it's how you behave in every
[1:07:27] situation
[1:07:28] how you handle every situation holiness
[1:07:31] has an effect
[1:07:35] now i don't stand here before you as a
[1:07:37] holy person
[1:07:40] i stand before you here as one of you
[1:07:44] wherever you put you just put me a
[1:07:46] little bit underneath you
[1:07:47] i don't care who you are where you think
[1:07:49] you stand just put me a little bit
[1:07:51] underneath you
[1:07:51] but i'm still one of you
[1:07:55] i'm just reading the word
[1:07:58] get back to first peter chapter three
[1:08:00] verse one you wives
[1:08:03] be subject to your own husbands that if
[1:08:05] any obey not the word they
[1:08:07] also may without the lord be won by the
[1:08:09] conversation of the wise while they
[1:08:10] behold
[1:08:11] your chaste conversation now notice it's
[1:08:15] coupled with fear
[1:08:16] i could be wrong any time that we're
[1:08:18] speaking but
[1:08:21] that's good step away from that
[1:08:26] because it's clearly identified it's not
[1:08:28] the right spirit
[1:08:30] while they behold your chaste
[1:08:32] conversation coupled with fear
[1:08:33] who's adorning let it not be the outward
[1:08:36] adorning of the plating of the hair
[1:08:39] the wearing of gold or the putting on of
[1:08:42] apparel
[1:08:47] in other words that's not what holiness
[1:08:50] is
[1:08:52] but let it be the hidden man of the
[1:08:54] heart
[1:08:56] in that which is not corruptable even
[1:08:58] the ornament
[1:09:00] of a meek and quiet
[1:09:04] spirit which is in the sight of god
[1:09:09] a great price can you imagine
[1:09:12] that we all have things in our life that
[1:09:15] we consider
[1:09:16] valuable and things not
[1:09:20] so valuable god considers
[1:09:24] a woman with a meek and quiet spirit
[1:09:28] to be a valuable to him amen
[1:09:33] wow if i was a woman i know what i'd go
[1:09:37] for
[1:09:39] come on
[1:09:42] i believe as a man i can have that same
[1:09:45] spirit
[1:09:46] i'm going to talk about a feminist
[1:09:48] spirit but moses was a meek man
[1:09:54] i believe that god was pleased with that
[1:09:57] amen chose him
[1:10:02] even jesus himself is meek amen
[1:10:06] i want to be meek brother i want to be
[1:10:08] more meek
[1:10:12] and i know his holy spirit in me
[1:10:16] will teach me to act the right way
[1:10:22] and you know what it'll do the same
[1:10:23] thing in you because he's the same
[1:10:25] yesterday today and forever
[1:10:29] and i'll say it like this i do not want
[1:10:36] to be a professor
[1:10:43] of god without the power
[1:10:48] to be meek and humble
[1:10:52] i want the power to live it amen for
[1:10:56] after this manner after this manner of a
[1:10:58] right spirit
[1:11:00] a meek spirit a quiet spirit in the old
[1:11:03] time the holy women also who trusted god
[1:11:06] adorning themselves being subject to
[1:11:08] their own husbands i want to say this
[1:11:10] when you have the right spirit you'll
[1:11:11] dress right
[1:11:15] you don't put dress before the right
[1:11:18] spirit
[1:11:19] but you can have all these things on the
[1:11:21] outside
[1:11:22] and think that is god on the inside and
[1:11:26] think it's
[1:11:27] it's god but
[1:11:35] god and the inside will work on the
[1:11:37] outside that's the song we sing amen
[1:11:41] even as sarah obeyed abraham calling him
[1:11:44] lord whose daughters you are
[1:11:46] in this church as long as you do not
[1:11:49] want you do well
[1:11:51] and that you're not afraid with any
[1:11:54] amazement don't be afraid
[1:11:58] in other words trust god trust god
[1:12:03] trust god why trust god i don't trust my
[1:12:07] husband
[1:12:08] that's not trusting god
[1:12:12] trust god that is with you and your
[1:12:14] husband
[1:12:17] well he just doesn't know as much as me
[1:12:19] so
[1:12:21] and do you think and do you think
[1:12:24] i'm up here because i know more than you
[1:12:28] i tell my men at work i tell my son i
[1:12:30] don't know as much as you know
[1:12:32] it's not about what you know it's about
[1:12:35] who you trust
[1:12:37] it's about your relationship with christ
[1:12:39] it's not your ability to get somewhere
[1:12:41] it's your it's your relationship with
[1:12:43] christ
[1:12:46] likewise your husbands dwell
[1:12:50] with your wives according to knowledge
[1:12:57] giving honor unto your wives
[1:13:02] well i'll give her honor when i feel she
[1:13:04] deserves it that is not what the
[1:13:06] scripture says
[1:13:13] if it wasn't for the mercies of god
[1:13:15] today none of us would be here
[1:13:19] you know one thing that we lack in this
[1:13:20] age
[1:13:22] is we lack thankfulness
[1:13:26] we have the hardest time
[1:13:30] come on up here come on up here
[1:13:35] now look at look at this brothers isn't
[1:13:37] this time match perfect
[1:13:40] doesn't it seriously isn't it perfect
[1:13:43] and don't you think this time match is
[1:13:45] good seriously
[1:13:48] did you know when i walked in the door
[1:13:49] today that
[1:13:51] i had that tie on me i put that on this
[1:13:53] morning
[1:13:56] and when he walked in he had this tie on
[1:14:00] and he said this is your tie i said i
[1:14:02] think it much better on me and this mine
[1:14:04] would match better on you let's switch
[1:14:16] we need to honor one another
[1:14:20] be more thankful for one another
[1:14:22] especially our wives
[1:14:29] well i'm afraid she'll get a big head
[1:14:30] bro john
[1:14:32] it ain't your job to pop it
[1:14:36] it ain't your job to keep it small it's
[1:14:39] your job to honor
[1:14:41] let god deal with that
[1:14:45] give honor unto your wife as unto the
[1:14:48] weaker vessel
[1:14:49] as being heirs together of the grace of
[1:14:52] life
[1:14:52] that your prayers be not hindered
[1:14:56] finally be all one mind having
[1:14:59] compassion one for another love is
[1:15:00] brother and be pitiful be courteous
[1:15:02] courteous not rendering
[1:15:07] evil for evil we can identify the evil
[1:15:10] somebody does to us
[1:15:13] but for some reason we have a hard time
[1:15:16] covering
[1:15:19] we want to set things straight the only
[1:15:22] thing you're setting straight is the
[1:15:24] nature that you're being led by
[1:15:26] amen
[1:15:30] not rendering evil free or railing for
[1:15:32] railing
[1:15:33] but contour-wise contour-wise
[1:15:37] wise however you say that brother marty
[1:15:40] where are you
[1:15:43] blessing give a blessing for evil give a
[1:15:46] blessing when somebody rails on you
[1:15:50] knowing that ye are there unto cold
[1:15:54] you know that's why a lot of people have
[1:15:56] a hard time living the life
[1:15:59] they haven't received the call yet they
[1:16:01] haven't recognized the call yet
[1:16:04] same thing with holiness when you
[1:16:06] recognize you've been called to holiness
[1:16:09] you'll get serious with it when you
[1:16:11] realize
[1:16:12] there is no other out the christian way
[1:16:16] is harder
[1:16:17] you have to bless them that curse you do
[1:16:19] good to them that hate you
[1:16:21] pray for them that despitefully use you
[1:16:23] that's the call
[1:16:25] there and too are you called
[1:16:30] that you should inherit a blessing
[1:16:33] for he that will love life and see good
[1:16:35] days let him refrain his
[1:16:37] tongue
[1:16:41] from speaking
[1:16:45] things that are not holy
[1:16:50] and his lips that they speak no guile
[1:16:54] let him excu evil and do good let him
[1:16:57] seek peace and ensue it
[1:16:59] for the eyes of the lord are over the
[1:17:01] righteous and his ears are open to their
[1:17:03] prayers but the face of the lord is
[1:17:05] against them that
[1:17:07] do evil
[1:17:10] so we see right here in the scriptures
[1:17:12] real plain
[1:17:13] the kind of life that god is looking for
[1:17:15] us to have
[1:17:17] now what we're hearing about is what we
[1:17:19] need to do when we leave here
[1:17:22] this whole thing that we read if you
[1:17:24] want to be you want to remind yourself
[1:17:26] if
[1:17:26] if you're interested in this you don't
[1:17:28] know if you go back and read it
[1:17:30] go back and read it when you get home
[1:17:32] look at it tonight read it together as a
[1:17:34] as a family as a husband as a wife
[1:17:37] you you want your prayers not hindered
[1:17:39] you you you
[1:17:40] you want the eyes to be the eyes of the
[1:17:42] lord would be on you
[1:17:44] well this is what to do you you you want
[1:17:46] god's eyes to be on you
[1:17:48] you've got to cover somebody else's evil
[1:17:54] you just got to think about this
[1:17:58] in life god every
[1:18:01] person on the planet is sinning
[1:18:05] and god's holding up back his blood why
[1:18:08] is it because his people and his bride
[1:18:12] are a little bit more righteous than the
[1:18:14] others
[1:18:17] no because there's a blood there there's
[1:18:21] the blood
[1:18:22] the life of the holy spirit
[1:18:25] taking this sin away
[1:18:29] that's what puts us in harmony with god
[1:18:31] that's why it's important
[1:18:33] the holy ghost living inside of us amen
[1:18:36] brother brandon said in the message
[1:18:38] dedication of the building
[1:18:42] and he's dedicating the building to the
[1:18:44] lord he says there
[1:18:46] was aaron's rod butted something
[1:18:50] that was dead an old dry stick off the
[1:18:53] desert in in the holiest of holies
[1:18:56] took new life and bloom blooms and
[1:18:58] sprouted out
[1:18:59] and brought leaves how it was laying in
[1:19:02] the presence
[1:19:04] of the holiest of holies
[1:19:08] so we want new life let it
[1:19:12] let it be more than just church coming
[1:19:13] here
[1:19:15] just your your oh got to get there half
[1:19:17] hour early
[1:19:18] i noticed none of you slept
[1:19:22] i know it takes time to change habits
[1:19:24] but look we'll keep pressing on
[1:19:27] but it's more than just getting to
[1:19:28] church more than just getting into this
[1:19:31] place
[1:19:33] is getting to the holiest of holies it's
[1:19:36] letting the holy spirit inside
[1:19:37] and you entering into that
[1:19:41] that's where life comes forth that's
[1:19:42] where a dried old life with
[1:19:44] hardly nothing going on no victory no
[1:19:46] joy that's where life will come forth
[1:19:50] he says you can take a dead sinner
[1:19:52] rotten carnal in his mind and in his
[1:19:54] thinking
[1:19:54] a criticizer of the power of god and
[1:19:56] bring him into the presence of the holy
[1:19:58] ghost
[1:19:58] and there will be something happen to
[1:20:00] him amen
[1:20:02] sure entering into the uh lonely place
[1:20:06] with god he dwells moses said in the
[1:20:09] next chapter
[1:20:10] in the thickness of darkness there's
[1:20:12] where god dwells
[1:20:14] that's where life stays is in the midst
[1:20:16] of the rotten corruption
[1:20:18] where does it life stay in the seed
[1:20:20] after it's rotten when it dies to itself
[1:20:23] it brings forth new life
[1:20:29] the message identification of christ in
[1:20:31] all ages brother bratton says and when
[1:20:33] moses was called it took 40 years of
[1:20:35] schooling
[1:20:37] then 40 years to get it out of him again
[1:20:43] well brother john i've been serving the
[1:20:45] lord now for this long
[1:20:46] and i still got problems okay let me ask
[1:20:48] you a question how long were you serving
[1:20:50] the devil
[1:20:57] how long were you compromising
[1:21:02] you know we want more and more and more
[1:21:03] we want things to happen i understand
[1:21:06] my my advice
[1:21:10] get more serious with god today
[1:21:13] get more serious with god today
[1:21:22] and i i say i say this encourage you
[1:21:25] you were not living in the home
[1:21:29] of the greatest corruption in the planet
[1:21:33] like moses was
[1:21:36] it was so filthy religious
[1:21:39] has so many gods
[1:21:45] everything that was said was so away
[1:21:47] from the realness of god
[1:21:51] you weren't that bad of shape have faith
[1:21:54] in god
[1:21:57] all things are possible to him believeth
[1:22:00] i'm just saying don't get negative with
[1:22:01] god if it hasn't happened yet believe
[1:22:04] believe it can happen
[1:22:10] that's where god dwells that's where the
[1:22:12] life stays amen
[1:22:16] when a man is in the presence of god
[1:22:20] then he knows something he said he knows
[1:22:23] something
[1:22:24] when he's in the presence of god so
[1:22:27] before you think you know something do
[1:22:29] me a favor
[1:22:30] labor to enter in his presence get in
[1:22:32] his presence and you want to know
[1:22:33] something
[1:22:34] no matter what you know what everybody
[1:22:37] will witness
[1:22:38] is a spirit of meekness
[1:22:44] contriteness because that's where god
[1:22:47] said he
[1:22:48] would dwell
[1:22:53] not he can't learn he says not he can't
[1:22:56] learn in books
[1:22:57] you can't learn god by books education
[1:23:01] you you say he's a ddd
[1:23:04] a phd for the man says that just
[1:23:08] takes him that much farther from god to
[1:23:11] me
[1:23:12] you don't know god by education
[1:23:15] you know god by faith
[1:23:18] faith in other words you hear the word
[1:23:20] of god being preached
[1:23:22] and you say i believe
[1:23:26] that's how you know god
[1:23:30] all right we're finally ready to start
[1:23:33] going through
[1:23:35] some of these things
[1:23:38] we'll just we'll just stop sooner if we
[1:23:40] have to
[1:23:43] you know how i am with the foundations
[1:23:45] the reason i believe in foundation so
[1:23:47] much it just makes
[1:23:49] it so much easier to receive the word
[1:23:54] and brother brandon has some strong
[1:23:55] words here
[1:23:57] in the message serpent see brother
[1:23:58] brandon says a woman supposed to be a
[1:24:00] woman
[1:24:01] and she's supposed to dress like a woman
[1:24:04] when god made a man he made him one
[1:24:06] thing and he made a woman
[1:24:08] something else and when god dresses a
[1:24:09] man he dressed him
[1:24:11] one way and the woman something else now
[1:24:16] the bible says it's abomination for a
[1:24:17] woman to put on
[1:24:18] a garment that pertains to a man that's
[1:24:21] scripture
[1:24:23] i think about i don't know if it's a
[1:24:27] woman or a man that's in our a public
[1:24:29] affairs office
[1:24:31] brother mike you would probably know but
[1:24:35] it sounds to me like it's someone that
[1:24:36] doesn't know who they are
[1:24:40] i want to ask brother mark did you ever
[1:24:43] battle if you were a woman
[1:24:47] but why some people have a hard time
[1:24:52] it's real you talk to some people
[1:24:58] i've seen guys talk like women
[1:25:02] act like it i just feel uncomfortable
[1:25:05] around them
[1:25:09] it's the perversion of satan
[1:25:14] the confusion in somebody's mind
[1:25:22] i'm so glad god sent a prophet to
[1:25:23] straighten me out
[1:25:27] to not be confused by someone who says i
[1:25:30] know that god
[1:25:31] called me to be something different he
[1:25:32] just made a mistake
[1:25:36] god didn't make a mistake
[1:25:41] but that's what people do when they try
[1:25:43] to make things different
[1:25:45] i'm going to destroy and kill this baby
[1:25:48] because god made a mistake did he
[1:25:52] see man is beginning to take his own
[1:25:55] order and when he takes his own order
[1:25:58] we're out of god's order brother man
[1:25:59] says there's only two orders gods and
[1:26:06] mans
[1:26:08] the mark of the beast is the same as the
[1:26:09] mark of the number of men
[1:26:12] 666. and you women putting on those
[1:26:16] little pants and things and wearing them
[1:26:18] out
[1:26:18] here and said this is for ladies
[1:26:23] i said no you're mistaken ladies don't
[1:26:25] wear them things
[1:26:27] he said women might but not ladies
[1:26:30] that's right the bible said it's an
[1:26:32] abomination for a woman to put on a
[1:26:33] garment
[1:26:34] for a man to put on a garment that
[1:26:37] pertains to a woman
[1:26:41] and men is becoming more sissified every
[1:26:44] day
[1:26:46] and women are becoming more masculine
[1:26:49] you ever see some pictures of a woman
[1:26:51] that's going like this oh my goodness
[1:26:53] exactly exactly
[1:26:56] he said what's the matter we're going to
[1:26:59] find out in a few minutes
[1:27:01] by the bible women ain't woman no more
[1:27:05] i don't mean you christian women i'm
[1:27:07] talking about the general run
[1:27:10] they want to act like men they want to
[1:27:13] cut their hair
[1:27:14] like men they want to put their hand
[1:27:17] on a bar like that and sing god bless
[1:27:19] america with a cigarette
[1:27:21] cigarette out of the corner of their
[1:27:22] mouth
[1:27:25] in the message the arrow of god's
[1:27:26] deliverance shot from a bowl brother
[1:27:28] brahm said
[1:27:30] seeing some of you women begin to wear
[1:27:32] your makeup and stuff like that the rest
[1:27:33] of the
[1:27:34] like the rest of the women in the world
[1:27:36] that nearly killed me and i walked
[1:27:38] in here the other day and i saw that
[1:27:41] look
[1:27:42] there's only one woman in the bible that
[1:27:44] ever paint your face
[1:27:47] you don't paint your face to meet god
[1:27:51] you do it to meet man
[1:27:55] and the woman that did that god fed her
[1:27:57] to the dog so when you're going to wear
[1:27:58] that just remember god
[1:28:00] turned you over to some dog meat
[1:28:03] when you see anybody doing that
[1:28:07] now keep away from that sean the very
[1:28:08] appearance of evil you might think i'm
[1:28:11] giving you a scorching but brother
[1:28:12] i believe it needs to be done here
[1:28:16] there's something that is wrong now i
[1:28:19] don't want you
[1:28:20] i don't want you to get angry with me
[1:28:23] i'm your brother
[1:28:26] i'm gonna make and god's going to make
[1:28:29] me answer before
[1:28:31] you at the day of judgment that's right
[1:28:33] the whole pentecostal world
[1:28:34] if they if they do let down
[1:28:38] don't you do it
[1:28:41] you stay true to god amen pray up
[1:28:44] live right associate yourself with god
[1:28:47] and his people
[1:28:49] and come out from among the worldly the
[1:28:51] ungodly things the bible says the holy
[1:28:53] spirit
[1:28:54] calls the people out no matter what your
[1:28:58] neighbor does
[1:29:00] and how good she is
[1:29:03] what this fellow does don't associate
[1:29:06] yourself
[1:29:06] with unbelief it'll leap right on to you
[1:29:12] just by associating yourself with it
[1:29:22] he said come out from among them and be
[1:29:25] separate saith the lord and i will
[1:29:27] receive you
[1:29:36] how hard would it be for the angels of
[1:29:39] god to be
[1:29:40] here in this room right now or free to
[1:29:43] this room
[1:29:43] how hard would it be for the angels of
[1:29:45] god to be in a bar
[1:29:47] right now with a bunch of sin going on
[1:29:50] and their nature to change more like
[1:29:52] the bar how hard would that be
[1:29:55] huh
[1:29:58] the the angels the angels of god
[1:30:01] no i don't mean to have trick questions
[1:30:03] maybe we should answer these i should
[1:30:06] probably say that ahead of time
[1:30:08] but the angels of god wormwood and
[1:30:12] and just uh gabriel and they
[1:30:16] they came into a bar
[1:30:23] how hard would it be for those angels to
[1:30:25] just change and become more corrupted
[1:30:29] see their their their very nature is of
[1:30:32] god
[1:30:34] it's holy
[1:30:37] it would be hard for them and it's hard
[1:30:40] for
[1:30:40] us when we're stuck in this nature
[1:30:43] satanic
[1:30:44] nature that we were born with to become
[1:30:46] holy
[1:30:48] now we can't do it with our efforts we
[1:30:50] just simply got to learn to die out
[1:30:52] learn the thing
[1:30:53] of denying self yielding to the holy
[1:30:56] ghost and saying these words lord fill
[1:30:58] me with your holy ghost
[1:30:59] fill me with your presence make me more
[1:31:01] like you
[1:31:04] then these everything will just fall
[1:31:07] into place
[1:31:09] brother adam said in the message a
[1:31:11] wedding supper
[1:31:13] he said now if eisenhower would send you
[1:31:16] an invitation
[1:31:17] how happy you would be and another thing
[1:31:20] i wouldn't think that you would try to
[1:31:23] go
[1:31:24] as an insult to mr eisenhower's
[1:31:27] supper by wearing your old greasy
[1:31:30] clothes
[1:31:32] would you think so all dirty and an old
[1:31:35] pair of hob nail
[1:31:36] shoes on whiskers all over your face or
[1:31:40] something or another
[1:31:42] you wouldn't go out and say hey look
[1:31:44] here i want to tell you something
[1:31:46] eisenhower
[1:31:49] told me i could come and i said oh
[1:31:53] that would be a disgrace to eisenhower
[1:31:58] and how much more disgraces it you who
[1:32:00] claim
[1:32:01] to have the invitation to the wedding
[1:32:03] supper
[1:32:04] and walk around with makeup on and act
[1:32:06] like the world
[1:32:08] smoking and drinking and carrying on
[1:32:12] clean up if you're going to the wedding
[1:32:14] supper
[1:32:16] he says you don't want to do that you
[1:32:18] you you get out of it see
[1:32:20] act like you're going somewhere
[1:32:27] i believe if you really got an
[1:32:29] invitation and accept it
[1:32:31] you will do it amen
[1:32:35] can you imagine my i'd clean
[1:32:38] all the dirt off from under my
[1:32:40] fingernails and clean everything else
[1:32:42] and
[1:32:43] and every little old dirty thing that's
[1:32:46] hanging on
[1:32:47] to you let us lay aside every weight
[1:32:50] and the sin that so easily beset us and
[1:32:53] run with patience
[1:32:54] the race that's set before us looking to
[1:32:56] the author and finisher of our faith
[1:32:59] oh my what an example he gave
[1:33:02] what ought we to do then we're going
[1:33:05] somewhere
[1:33:06] to a wedding supper and this
[1:33:10] is god speaking to the heart
[1:33:14] did you just hear what he said it was
[1:33:17] not brother branham speaking
[1:33:22] we've got to either believe that what we
[1:33:24] hear is god or it's brother john
[1:33:26] amen or some man that god's that brother
[1:33:29] john's reading about
[1:33:30] amen look i can fill this room with
[1:33:33] books of people that want to tell you
[1:33:35] about god
[1:33:38] i've never had an interest to read any
[1:33:40] of them never
[1:33:43] i'll stay with this message i stay with
[1:33:45] what the prophet said
[1:33:46] [Music]
[1:33:49] i why would i want to sit and read
[1:33:50] another book that i got to decipher
[1:33:54] is it is it makes sense with the
[1:33:55] messenger doesn't it i don't know the
[1:33:57] message enough to know
[1:33:58] whether something can be slid in there
[1:34:03] this message is all i need
[1:34:05] amen amen
[1:34:11] i'm all i'm not against other things i'm
[1:34:13] just
[1:34:15] i'm just saying i know that this is god
[1:34:17] speaking to the heart
[1:34:19] he says you don't realize what this is
[1:34:22] that you turn
[1:34:23] down each night in service
[1:34:28] when god knocks at your heart and said
[1:34:30] child
[1:34:31] i'm inviting you to come to me tonight
[1:34:35] come by the way of the cross where my
[1:34:37] precious son paid the price
[1:34:38] come in the come in at the door i'm
[1:34:41] inviting you
[1:34:43] and then you turn it down i
[1:34:46] imagine you wouldn't turn down mr
[1:34:48] eisenhower
[1:34:50] one time but you're turning down
[1:34:53] god think about that but god is
[1:34:57] long-suffering not willing that any
[1:34:58] should perish and he said come let us
[1:35:01] reason together saith the lord come let
[1:35:03] me talk it over with you oh
[1:35:05] i just love it come and let's sit down
[1:35:07] uh
[1:35:08] in the church tonight and forget about
[1:35:10] all the day's work and let us reason to
[1:35:12] the
[1:35:12] come let us reason together saith the
[1:35:14] lord
[1:35:16] think that god wanting to reason out
[1:35:19] your problems and in
[1:35:22] showing you and in so and
[1:35:25] in soul showing you where you're wrong
[1:35:30] by the preaching of the word
[1:35:33] he pretty much told us why we come to
[1:35:34] church right there
[1:35:37] and then giving you an invitation to
[1:35:39] come to his house for eternal life and
[1:35:42] you turn it down can you imagine that
[1:35:45] well that's what people do
[1:35:48] now they don't stand up and say
[1:35:51] i'm not coming you know what they do
[1:35:59] it's the same thing
[1:36:03] we ought to get so serious with god we
[1:36:05] don't care who's watching what's
[1:36:08] happening
[1:36:10] we need to get serious because i will
[1:36:12] say this
[1:36:13] you even know this someday it's going to
[1:36:16] be over
[1:36:17] amen well brother john i just don't
[1:36:20] think it's right now and i've got time
[1:36:22] okay okay but who is to say that
[1:36:25] you know that from god because not even
[1:36:28] the angels are told that
[1:36:30] so what you're doing is you're gambling
[1:36:32] with your souls
[1:36:34] god is calling us
[1:36:38] god is calling us where we're not
[1:36:43] unless you want to stand up and say i've
[1:36:46] arrived
[1:36:48] then i'm going to let you up here and
[1:36:49] i'm going to come sit down
[1:36:54] i i appreciate everybody's holiness here
[1:36:57] i do
[1:36:58] but we need more just
[1:37:02] not so much it's not
[1:37:06] the dress but it's your desire to
[1:37:10] to get a hold of this thing your
[1:37:13] behavior
[1:37:15] how you act when the going gets tough
[1:37:19] anybody can act right when you're
[1:37:21] getting patted on the back
[1:37:24] you're a good guy yeah but let somebody
[1:37:28] punch you talk behind your back
[1:37:30] curse at you then show me how you're
[1:37:32] going to act
[1:37:34] until until brother branham says until
[1:37:36] you have perfect love until you can get
[1:37:38] to the place where you can love
[1:37:40] every enemy no matter what they've done
[1:37:42] to you lay aside
[1:37:44] the rest of your life and go get perfect
[1:37:48] love
[1:37:49] get to that place because that's
[1:37:51] behavior
[1:37:53] that's behavior so i say today
[1:37:59] every one of us should feel i got to
[1:38:01] really dig into this
[1:38:04] not well i really think this is for you
[1:38:06] know this is for
[1:38:08] this is for brother bob you know he's a
[1:38:09] newbie
[1:38:15] no it's for brother john he's an old bee
[1:38:19] i need it just as much as bob
[1:38:23] and you do too you do too just got to
[1:38:27] open your heart let god
[1:38:28] show you what's going on in the message
[1:38:31] former and letter reign brother branham
[1:38:32] said
[1:38:33] the bible says it's an abomination for a
[1:38:36] woman to put on a garment that pertains
[1:38:38] to man
[1:38:38] all these things they walk right in
[1:38:42] just as wide open with their eyes as
[1:38:44] they can be
[1:38:45] stumbling in gross darkness
[1:38:48] think about that they know what they're
[1:38:51] doing
[1:38:52] but they're still blind and stumbling
[1:38:55] see there
[1:38:56] they know naturally what they're doing
[1:39:00] but spiritually they're blind
[1:39:04] that's why we have the gospel it's light
[1:39:07] the gospel is light and it shows us
[1:39:09] what's right wrong
[1:39:13] people who calling themselves christians
[1:39:16] women and men smoking cigarettes
[1:39:18] drinking and going to cocktail parties
[1:39:19] wearing shorts bobbing their hair
[1:39:21] wearing makeup manicure whatever it is
[1:39:23] on their face and walking right on
[1:39:24] exactly right
[1:39:25] and you scream out and you say brother
[1:39:27] brandon you're an old foggy
[1:39:31] foggy
[1:39:36] that's true there's only one g
[1:39:41] brother branham you're an old foggy
[1:39:47] you'll remember this someday take heed
[1:39:50] god sets up his tower
[1:39:54] he put somebody up there your pastor
[1:39:56] will scream out against it
[1:39:58] and if you're full gospel man and
[1:40:00] baptist and presbyterian
[1:40:01] and whoever is filled with the holy
[1:40:03] ghost will scream out against it
[1:40:05] no matter who it is he's a man of god
[1:40:09] his spirit
[1:40:10] will be like the holy spirit because it
[1:40:13] is part of the holy spirit and the holy
[1:40:16] spirit wrote the word
[1:40:17] and the holy spirit confirms the word
[1:40:20] everything he promised
[1:40:22] he takes care of it certainly it has to
[1:40:24] be we're in the last days
[1:40:26] and we're at the end time
[1:40:31] abraham said in the rejected king he
[1:40:33] says let me tell you something ladies
[1:40:35] i'm not making fun of you this is no
[1:40:38] place for that this is the place
[1:40:39] where judgment goes forth and judgment
[1:40:42] has to go right
[1:40:43] and judgment by the word of god lookie
[1:40:46] there was
[1:40:47] one woman in the entire bible that
[1:40:49] repaint her face
[1:40:50] one woman she never painted her face to
[1:40:53] meet
[1:40:55] and she painted and she never painted
[1:40:56] her face to me god she painted her face
[1:40:58] to meet a man to try to vamp him
[1:41:01] to vamp him jezebel he says you know
[1:41:05] what god did for her he fed her to the
[1:41:07] dogs that's exactly right
[1:41:09] so you see woman wearing makeup and
[1:41:11] those things
[1:41:13] you say that's miss dog meat that's
[1:41:16] exactly
[1:41:17] what it is before god he fed her to the
[1:41:21] dog so that's all
[1:41:22] she stood for were dogs he fed her to
[1:41:25] the dogs
[1:41:26] how many knows that to be the truth amen
[1:41:27] now here's the thing i know this is
[1:41:29] this sounds like a story and it's kind
[1:41:31] of like oh why are you talking about
[1:41:32] this
[1:41:33] look it's scriptural god is hidden in
[1:41:36] simplicity
[1:41:38] and our nature is to come to church do
[1:41:41] our duty and go home
[1:41:43] it is god's business to try to attract
[1:41:45] the attention of the bride
[1:41:49] that change can take place now
[1:41:52] i'm okay if you if you say you know what
[1:41:55] this
[1:41:55] is not for me i'm okay with that but you
[1:41:58] must say i'm not bride
[1:41:59] because this is the word of god this is
[1:42:02] not a word from man
[1:42:03] amen and when you begin to say well i'm
[1:42:08] not bride you know what you're what
[1:42:09] you're doing
[1:42:14] you're setting yourself up for
[1:42:15] tribulation
[1:42:20] we've got to get serious with this word
[1:42:22] god could come any minute i don't always
[1:42:24] come
[1:42:24] and never expect a preacher to ever tell
[1:42:28] you when he's coming
[1:42:29] amen
[1:42:33] everybody that i know that ever passed
[1:42:36] away
[1:42:36] god didn't tell him you're gonna pass
[1:42:38] away in this day at this time and this
[1:42:40] is what's gonna happen so get ready
[1:42:43] he may warn you about the season
[1:42:47] don't expect god to come to you to your
[1:42:50] low down i don't care enough to live for
[1:42:52] you with all my life
[1:42:53] to tell you when he's coming we heard
[1:42:55] the preaching of god
[1:42:57] it is it's it's our duty to put
[1:42:59] everything we got into god and to serve
[1:43:01] him with all of our lives
[1:43:04] today is the hour now is the hour to
[1:43:06] start walking in holiness
[1:43:09] well brother john i don't wear makeup
[1:43:11] and i don't smoke cigarettes
[1:43:13] and i don't wear shorts well praise god
[1:43:15] what are you doing
[1:43:21] somewhere down the line the shoe is
[1:43:23] fitting somebody at some time
[1:43:26] somewhere don't be a person that comes
[1:43:29] in the church and say
[1:43:30] you know the shoe never fit me today
[1:43:33] i'm afraid you brought your pitchfork
[1:43:35] and you forgot the rake
[1:43:44] one more and then we'll quit i can't get
[1:43:46] all done
[1:43:48] brother brahms said in the message thy
[1:43:50] siege shall possess the gate of the
[1:43:52] enemy he said
[1:43:53] women with their cut here wearing shorts
[1:43:56] and makeup and still professing
[1:43:59] to have the holy ghost
[1:44:03] depending on the evidence of speaking in
[1:44:05] tongues or jumping up and down or
[1:44:06] shouting
[1:44:09] he said they fail
[1:44:13] that still small voice of the word
[1:44:19] the word keeps you balanced to the cross
[1:44:25] how important it should be for us to
[1:44:28] love the word
[1:44:30] to love the word i'll say there's things
[1:44:35] in the word
[1:44:35] that when i read it hurts it cuts i want
[1:44:39] to read by
[1:44:39] fast buy it i don't want to preach about
[1:44:41] it
[1:44:43] come on i'm telling you the human nature
[1:44:48] brother random stayed away from things
[1:44:49] that he didn't understand didn't know
[1:44:51] how to to just handle but the thing is
[1:44:55] it's the word of god we need to come
[1:44:57] in love with all of it we need to come
[1:44:58] to grips with all of it
[1:45:00] somewhere down the line we've got a
[1:45:02] change
[1:45:06] and don't wait
[1:45:11] take this hour to respond to the call
[1:45:17] just accept the word
[1:45:21] well brother john my mom and my dad
[1:45:24] never taught me this
[1:45:27] i understand your mom my mom and dad
[1:45:29] never taught me this either
[1:45:35] but we're not this church is not the
[1:45:38] church of your mom and dad
[1:45:41] this is a church of god god is teaching
[1:45:44] us his word
[1:45:46] we're changing to become like him
[1:45:50] so we heard the call
[1:45:53] and now it the simplicity of responding
[1:45:56] to the call
[1:45:57] is where god has spoken to your heart
[1:45:59] personally
[1:46:01] he said this is what i'm calling you to
[1:46:02] do
[1:46:04] you say amen and you take that first
[1:46:07] step
[1:46:08] and if you fail before the day is over
[1:46:10] get back up and
[1:46:12] keep walking
[1:46:16] but if you don't take that first step
[1:46:19] god
[1:46:19] does not see your faith
[1:46:25] is that is that right it wasn't until
[1:46:28] abraham
[1:46:30] abraham believed god has counted him to
[1:46:31] righteousness but it wasn't until he
[1:46:33] brought back that fork
[1:46:35] that fork that knife that spoon and he
[1:46:38] was ready to slay isaac then god stayed
[1:46:40] his hand and says now i know
[1:46:43] god saw his faith by his works
[1:46:47] faith without works is dead so i'll just
[1:46:49] say it like this
[1:46:50] take a stand confess it this is your
[1:46:52] direction i'm going let the chips fall
[1:46:54] where they're going to fall
[1:46:56] i'm going to become more holy because
[1:46:59] god is holy well brother john i don't
[1:47:02] what's going to happen to my spouse
[1:47:04] what's going to happen to my boss what's
[1:47:05] going to happen to my
[1:47:07] it does not matter because this is
[1:47:10] serious business between you and your
[1:47:12] soul
[1:47:13] take a stand maybe if you take the right
[1:47:17] stand
[1:47:18] you'll be helping your soul and soul
[1:47:22] out by faith amen
[1:47:27] let's stand together
[1:47:40] praise the lord
[1:47:43] we can say praise the lord to the word
[1:47:45] of god
[1:47:59] amen let's let's bow our heart in a word
[1:48:02] of prayer
[1:48:03] maybe with every eye closed
[1:48:08] just trying to focus our thoughts for
[1:48:11] just a moment
[1:48:12] on
[1:48:16] what god has spoke to us personally
[1:48:21] one thing collectively god has spoken
[1:48:24] to all of us to become more holy
[1:48:30] and
[1:48:33] today god is has
[1:48:36] showed us how to respond
[1:48:39] to that call and if you've
[1:48:42] you've heard that still small voice
[1:48:45] something
[1:48:46] speaking to you you believe
[1:48:50] that it's him
[1:48:53] and you want to respond to that call now
[1:48:57] you don't have to
[1:48:59] lift your hand you don't have to
[1:49:03] to show publicly as if that's the answer
[1:49:11] but if you believe this is god speaking
[1:49:14] to you
[1:49:17] maybe you're here and you're desiring
[1:49:19] god's grace that you could respond to
[1:49:21] that call
[1:49:23] and you want me to pray with you you
[1:49:25] want god to see
[1:49:27] your need just lift up your hand

[1:49:50] of the lord in this home in god's home

[1:50:05] have
[1:50:06] lifted our hands as we are surrendering
[1:50:09] in our heart
[1:50:12] god promised that he would draw nigh to
[1:50:16] us
[1:50:17] he would give grace to the humble
[1:50:21] and we have humbled ourselves before him
[1:50:24] today

[1:50:28] things in our life

[1:50:40] in our life lord we have
[1:50:44] entered into your holiness
