[1:10] wasn't able
[1:12] to meet needs
[1:15] but you said in your word that
[1:18] you would do exceedingly above all that
[1:21] we could ask
[1:22] or even think and lord
[1:25] you're a mighty god today
[1:29] and lord as we settle into this part of
[1:32] the service
[1:34] we know that the enemy
[1:38] also wants to be here
[1:41] also wants to come in doubts and fears
[1:45] and
[1:45] confusions and to take your word and
[1:48] kind of twist it
[1:50] god we ask today that you'd come and
[1:52] take control
[1:54] of this surface lord control of every
[1:56] spirit
[1:58] lord we humble ourselves under them
[2:02] your mighty hand and pray that your
[2:05] precious
[2:06] blood would cover us of all of our sins
[2:09] all of our iniquities anything that
[2:10] we've said
[2:11] done or thought lord we put it under the
[2:14] blood today
[2:16] that we might be in unity with you today
[2:19] father
[2:21] i pray that you would have your way as
[2:23] we commit the service to you we ask that
[2:25] you bless the reading of your words
[2:27] to our hearts that you'd give us truly
[2:32] the the revelation and understanding
[2:34] that we need inside
[2:36] lord that we might be stronger
[2:40] that we might be able to combat
[2:44] all the fiery darts of the wicked one
[2:47] we might put on the whole armor of god
[2:50] today lord we give you this service that
[2:54] you may
[2:54] have free will in our lives and we give
[2:57] you the praise for it now for we ask it
[2:59] in jesus christ's name
[3:01] amen amen praise the lord
[3:04] how many is glad to finally be in god's
[3:08] house
[3:09] a place where we can receive help and
[3:12] strength from the lord
[3:14] and turn with me if you would to the
[3:15] book of nehemiah if you have your bibles
[3:18] nehemiah chapter 8
[3:21] we want to entitle the message today as
[3:24] you're turning there
[3:25] joy real simple joy the topic
[3:28] of joy and for a subject battling for
[3:31] joy because it
[3:33] it is a battle the devil is doing
[3:36] everything he can
[3:37] to steal our joy and uh we
[3:41] remember the the message that brother
[3:44] branham gave us about the different
[3:46] worms that ate away at the church
[3:48] and and one of those was joy and
[3:52] we know joy comes from the lord and so
[3:55] the devil is trying to eat that
[3:57] eat that away from us but joy belongs
[4:02] to the people of god amen amen nehemiah
[4:05] chapter 8 starting with verse 1
[4:08] and all the people gathered themselves
[4:10] together as
[4:11] one man into the street that was before
[4:14] the watergate and they spake unto ezra
[4:16] the scribe to bring the book of the law
[4:18] of moses which
[4:20] the lord had commanded to israel and
[4:22] ezra the
[4:23] priests brought the law before the
[4:25] congregation both men and women and all
[4:27] could hear
[4:28] that all could hear and understand upon
[4:31] the first day of the seventh month and
[4:33] he read therein before the street
[4:35] that was before the watergate from the
[4:38] morning
[4:39] to the midday before the men and the
[4:42] women
[4:43] and those that could understand the ears
[4:45] of all the people were attentive
[4:47] unto the book of law and ezra the
[4:50] scribes stood upon
[4:51] a pulpit of wood which they had made for
[4:54] the purpose
[4:55] and beside him stood boy this is where
[4:58] we really need
[5:02] to not articulate but there were
[5:08] scribes and uh levites that
[5:12] um stood with him and here are the names
[5:17] and uh i don't want to butcher them
[5:19] because i'll have to answer to them on
[5:21] the other side
[5:23] so verse 5 and ezra
[5:27] opened the book in the sight of all the
[5:29] people
[5:30] for he was above all the people and when
[5:33] he
[5:33] opened it all the people stood up and
[5:35] ezra
[5:36] bless the lord the great god and all the
[5:39] people answered amen
[5:41] amen with lifting up their hands
[5:44] and they bowed their heads and
[5:46] worshipped the lord
[5:47] with their faces to the ground also
[5:51] joshua and ben i and she
[5:55] bia jaimen and acrom
[5:59] akab shabi tia
[6:03] hordija nasita
[6:08] and i'm so sorry the rest of them
[6:11] and the levites calls the people listen
[6:15] to this
[6:15] he calls the people to understand the
[6:18] law
[6:19] and the people stood in their place so
[6:21] they
[6:22] read in the book in the law of god
[6:24] distinctly
[6:25] and gave the sense and caused them to
[6:28] understand
[6:29] their reading amen god bless you may be
[6:32] seated
[6:38] praise god for fivefold ministry amen
[6:41] all the people were gathered
[6:44] together they gathered themselves
[6:46] together as
[6:48] one man
[6:52] we can learn a lot
[6:55] in this subject if we
[6:58] could put away our differences and
[7:02] come together in unity just like they
[7:04] did on the day of pentecost
[7:07] that's what they had in common they had
[7:09] in common
[7:10] god i need god they didn't have in
[7:12] common
[7:14] i know this about god right that that's
[7:18] what they had
[7:19] when jesus was uh there and they were
[7:22] trying to see who was the greatest among
[7:23] them remember that
[7:25] he says we're not like that so they
[7:27] learned not to be like that when they
[7:29] came together they were as one man
[7:32] not two not three but as one man
[7:35] one man and one mind of christ
[7:38] one accord god would bless us
[7:41] if we could come together with that
[7:43] mindset now what we have to do
[7:45] is we have to learn to put away the
[7:47] stuff
[7:50] the stuff that bothers us the stuff that
[7:54] the devil uses to naught at us
[7:57] in the message called fellowship brother
[7:59] branham said wouldn't it be marvelous
[8:01] now
[8:01] if the whole group of us here some five
[8:03] or six thousand people
[8:05] whatever the audience is all these
[8:07] people together this afternoon
[8:09] with one accord could come right under
[8:12] the blood could come
[8:15] in one accord come under the blood
[8:18] just like we're under this roof here
[8:22] under the blood of the lord jesus he
[8:24] says what do you
[8:26] think would take place right now
[8:29] he says what do you think would take
[8:31] place he asked a question twice
[8:32] he said why there wouldn't be a feeble
[8:36] person
[8:37] among us in the next five minutes
[8:41] only for being all under the blood
[8:45] not for knowing anything not for knowing
[8:48] the scriptures and being able to quote
[8:50] them
[8:51] knowing the message but by being under
[8:54] this
[8:54] god's blood cleanses me god's blood
[8:56] cleanses my brother god's blood cleanses
[8:59] my sister
[8:59] right here under the blood now if you
[9:03] can get your attitude like that
[9:04] god can do something in our midst
[9:12] brother branham said in the message dr
[9:14] moses
[9:18] and yet when moses come out of the
[9:21] wilderness
[9:22] he said there wasn't a feeble one among
[9:25] them
[9:26] 40 years dr moses
[9:29] if god could do that for them god could
[9:32] do what he did on the day of pentecost
[9:33] is not god the same yesterday today and
[9:35] forever
[9:36] god cannot god bless us
[9:40] we got to do our job to put away the
[9:43] stuff that brings division
[9:45] in our minds in our thoughts in our
[9:47] words
[9:48] i mean we really must have the love of
[9:51] god shed abroad in her heart
[9:55] and ezra and the scribe stood upon a
[9:58] pulpit of wood
[9:59] and when he opened the book of the lord
[10:01] all the people
[10:03] stood to their feet with great respect
[10:07] to god's word something about it when
[10:10] they knew the word was coming
[10:12] they just automatically said this is not
[10:14] the word of azeroth this is not the word
[10:16] of nehemiah this is not the word of the
[10:18] levites this is the word of the lord
[10:21] they gave respect see what happens when
[10:24] we come under that place
[10:25] where the blood is here and you believe
[10:27] in the presence of god
[10:28] you're not looking at a man you're not
[10:30] looking at what's at the pulpit
[10:31] you're looking at the spirit of what's
[10:33] speaking to your heart that's almighty
[10:35] god
[10:36] the living word of god amen
[10:40] the bible doesn't say that they were
[10:41] asked to stand
[10:43] right right they all had respect to the
[10:46] word of the lord
[10:47] i'll tell you if there's something that
[10:49] where the church world is
[10:51] lacking in this age is they're losing
[10:54] their respect for god
[10:56] and when i lose my respect for my
[10:59] brother i
[11:00] am losing respect for god
[11:03] you cannot disrespect a human being and
[11:06] respect god
[11:08] and expect your relationship with god to
[11:10] be right
[11:12] he said leave your gift at the altar you
[11:15] go back
[11:16] make things right and then you come and
[11:18] offer your gift to me
[11:19] god expects us to have things right with
[11:21] one another
[11:22] before we try to have a relationship
[11:24] with him
[11:27] and that wasn't in my notes
[11:30] i just know that you cannot respect too
[11:33] much we had that service
[11:34] that'd be a good one just to preach
[11:36] again
[11:40] the devil see when you respect
[11:44] completely the devil can't get in there
[11:52] but when you just only respect a little
[11:54] bit
[11:56] the devil can get in there we're not
[11:57] respecting
[12:01] and ezra blessed the lord
[12:05] the great god the bible says ezra
[12:08] bless the lord did you know you can
[12:10] bless the lord
[12:12] it's not just about the lord blessing
[12:13] you it's about you blessing the lord
[12:16] amen
[12:17] not with your greatness or your
[12:19] abilities but with your humility
[12:21] your adorning your reverence your
[12:23] respect that's how you bless the lord
[12:26] you give respect to the lord
[12:27] that blesses him sometimes we come here
[12:31] and we our attitudes are we just want to
[12:33] you know
[12:36] get more of god up here we need to be
[12:39] working on a relationship right here
[12:43] this is where god's going to meet you
[12:44] he's not going to meet you here
[12:47] he'll meet you in your heart
[12:50] bless the lord i say bless the lord
[12:53] did not david say bless the lord all my
[12:55] soul
[12:59] give god what he's worthy of i'm not
[13:01] used to it brother john
[13:03] it doesn't matter give them start it's
[13:05] got to start
[13:06] somewhere i tell you what the lord to
[13:08] bless you give them some blessings back
[13:14] you want joy bless the lord
[13:20] and all the people answered
[13:23] amen amen bless the lord
[13:26] amen that's what you should be doing is
[13:29] blessing the lord so be it
[13:30] let's bless the lord they lifted up
[13:32] their hands and they bowed their heads
[13:35] and worshiped the lord with their faces
[13:38] to the ground
[13:41] why because the word of the lord was
[13:44] coming
[13:46] they were having a worship service not
[13:49] because they wanted to feel good
[13:50] they wanted to hear their favorite song
[13:52] and they just wanted to feel so good
[13:54] about the worship service
[13:55] no they were worshiping because the word
[13:58] was coming forth
[14:02] too often we come to church saints and
[14:04] we divide the worship service
[14:07] with the preaching of the word it's like
[14:10] it's two different things it's like
[14:12] oh i enjoy the worship service but that
[14:14] word you know what i'm saying it's hard
[14:16] to get into it
[14:23] the reason you're worshiping is the word
[14:25] is coming
[14:27] that's why you come to church
[14:30] you can worship anywhere you worship in
[14:32] your car
[14:33] you worship in your home you're coming
[14:37] here to meet with god to hear
[14:39] what god has to say to you that ought to
[14:41] be exciting
[14:42] now if you were going to god's house
[14:44] you'd be pretty excited about what he's
[14:46] going to say to you
[14:51] either that you'd say you know what i
[14:53] can't come over yet i got to take care
[14:54] of some things
[14:56] either way you're going to get excited
[14:58] when you finally get to be in his
[15:00] presence
[15:02] i could understand if this was some some
[15:05] seminary where we come and we
[15:07] learn to say our amends just right
[15:10] we learn to you know what scripture is
[15:13] kind of tied together with other
[15:14] scriptures and we
[15:15] we learn about god up here
[15:18] but we come to get real with god here
[15:22] we allow that word to begin to deal with
[15:24] our heart amen
[15:27] these these people were excited about
[15:30] the word that was going to come forth
[15:31] i'm telling you
[15:35] our worship service shouldn't be
[15:37] something
[15:39] that just that's the exciting part of
[15:41] the service
[15:43] it should prepare us for the word we
[15:45] should be excited about the word
[15:48] and nehemiah ezra and the levites taught
[15:51] the people
[15:52] and gave the sense and caused them to
[15:54] understand
[15:55] what they were reading
[16:00] don't you like making sense of the word
[16:06] who wants a word that's going to be more
[16:08] confusing
[16:10] than before you came in amen
[16:14] god gave us a five-fold ministry for our
[16:16] perfection
[16:18] he gave us a seer called a prophet he's
[16:20] the mouthpiece of god
[16:22] he gave his teachers with patience he
[16:25] gave us apostles and missionaries to
[16:27] establish new works as well as set
[16:30] things in order
[16:32] he gave us evangelists to stir up the
[16:34] fire inside of us amen
[16:36] he gave his shepherds to watch over the
[16:38] flock to defeat us
[16:40] and to to keep us and to see us through
[16:42] as the prophet said
[16:43] so god gave us a fightful ministry to
[16:46] make sense of this message
[16:47] to make sense to make us to understand
[16:50] what
[16:50] well how a christian should live he
[16:53] didn't send a man
[16:54] who didn't live the life and said oh you
[16:58] need to do this
[16:59] no he said a man that could love his
[17:01] enemies that could lay down his life
[17:03] that
[17:03] could turn down money he he sent a man
[17:07] that was so like jesus
[17:11] so we could understand what this book
[17:13] really means
[17:18] now when the people heard the word
[17:21] preached
[17:22] the bible says all the people
[17:26] wept this is no
[17:29] no mistake the gospel
[17:33] ought to squeeze at some point every
[17:36] person's heart
[17:37] and tears should flow
[17:43] i don't believe they were preaching fire
[17:45] and brimstone and trying to make them
[17:47] feel bad
[17:49] i believe that they were so in love with
[17:51] the word of god
[17:52] that that word began to deal with them
[17:54] and caused them to weep because they
[17:56] weren't
[17:57] living up to the word of god
[18:02] you know we want to come to church we
[18:03] want to belong to a church where the
[18:05] word
[18:06] is confirming the life that i'm living
[18:08] is good enough
[18:16] okay i'm going to put god in this box
[18:20] he gets out of that box you know what
[18:23] i'm going to start my own denomination
[18:27] the preaching of the word ought to draw
[18:30] us
[18:31] closer to god so if you want a closer
[18:35] walk
[18:35] i want you to take a humble approach
[18:40] let god deal with your heart if you
[18:43] don't let god deal with your heart
[18:46] something's wrong somewhere
[18:53] the remedy for getting the devil off
[18:55] your back
[18:56] is the same remedy for a closer walk
[18:59] with god
[19:00] it's the same remedy it's the same
[19:03] formula
[19:04] james chapter 4 verse 7.
[19:11] james 4 7 submit
[19:14] yourself therefore
[19:18] to god so you want a closer walk or you
[19:21] want the devil off your back
[19:22] do this right here submit yourself
[19:24] therefore to god
[19:26] resist the devil and he will flee
[19:29] from you
[19:32] submit to the word don't come
[19:35] to church with a smorgasbord
[19:38] denominational belief
[19:41] i am going to pick and choose what's for
[19:43] me the whole word is for you
[19:46] bring your rake
[19:50] now understand that not every little
[19:52] single thing is
[19:53] exactly what's going on in your life
[19:57] but you take that thing so far
[20:01] that you're missing out what god's
[20:03] really trying to do with your heart
[20:05] we serve a god who's capable of
[20:07] preaching one word
[20:09] and dealing with every heart
[20:12] we're not serving some scholar who can't
[20:15] figure out how to tie his shoes
[20:18] we're serving a god who knows how to
[20:19] deal with our heart how many times
[20:21] have you you you've heard a scripture
[20:24] seen a scripture something was said
[20:25] something was done
[20:26] had nothing to do with what god
[20:30] was speaking to you about
[20:33] that's the god we serve he is capable
[20:37] of dealing with our hearts amen
[20:40] don't make a smorgasbord believer out of
[20:42] yourself
[20:45] now verse 8 9 these are scriptures now
[20:49] that actually define what it means to
[20:50] submit how you submit
[20:52] draw nigh to god and he will draw an eye
[20:55] to you
[20:56] well how do i do that brother john i'm
[20:57] so glad you asked he said cleanse your
[21:00] hands
[21:03] purify your hearts
[21:07] well i feel every day
[21:11] i backslide every day
[21:16] so i would be considered a sinner
[21:23] sometimes i get double minded what to do
[21:27] well i say i need a purifying of the
[21:29] heart
[21:31] so this the scriptures here are speaking
[21:35] about how to get the devil off your back
[21:38] or how to get a closer walk with god
[21:42] be afflicted mourn weep
[21:46] let your laughter be turned to mourning
[21:48] and your
[21:49] joy to heaviness
[21:54] notice you can be delighted in your
[21:57] flesh
[21:58] which is joy or you can be delighted
[22:01] in the spirit you can be glad and
[22:04] cheerful in your flesh
[22:05] and you can be glad and cheerful in the
[22:07] spirit
[22:09] how to break this down now because the
[22:11] scripture says let your joy
[22:13] be turned to heaviness not god's joy
[22:16] your joy
[22:19] joy is not a gift that he hands out to
[22:21] his favorite children
[22:23] for god is no respecter persons joy is a
[22:27] gift or a fruit of his spirit
[22:30] when you have it when you have god's
[22:32] spirit and you
[22:33] you got god's spirit so you got joy
[22:35] inside
[22:39] you can't separate it
[22:42] you may not about to tap into it for a
[22:44] certain reason god given us time we're
[22:46] going to get into that
[22:48] so if you're willing to battle to keep
[22:50] your flesh dead
[22:56] then joy the joy of the lord
[23:00] should be inside of you but if you do
[23:03] not
[23:04] labor to crucify your flesh do not
[23:08] expect your god's joy to be there
[23:16] let me give you an example here you can
[23:18] be sarcastic you can make fun
[23:20] you can laugh about somebody
[23:23] and you can call it joy
[23:26] but that's just fleshly joy you know
[23:29] some people call it laughter but i'm
[23:31] just gonna
[23:32] for figurative speech because so many
[23:33] times you know i've got joy that's why
[23:36] i'm happy
[23:38] but you can act that way and feel good
[23:42] but it's just a fleshly joy
[23:45] but the joy of the lord would bring
[23:48] great delight
[23:50] in your heart to lay down your life for
[23:53] somebody or to seem other than better
[23:55] yourself
[23:57] not to cut them down not to make fun of
[23:59] them
[24:00] more to make fun of yourself
[24:04] job 20 verse 5 says the trump the
[24:07] triumphanting
[24:08] of the wicked is short but look at this
[24:10] and the joy
[24:11] of the hypocrite is but for a
[24:14] moment in other words they can
[24:18] experience
[24:19] joy but it's in the flesh
[24:24] oh i'm going to do this one thing i'm
[24:25] going to act this way in front of
[24:26] somebody
[24:27] and then i'm going to go live like this
[24:29] that moment
[24:31] of praying in front of everybody that
[24:34] moment in paying tithes in front of
[24:37] everybody doing your alms before the
[24:39] people
[24:39] well that joy that that just lasts for a
[24:42] moment
[24:44] see the joy of the flesh is just for a
[24:47] moment
[24:50] but we're not talking about that because
[24:52] there's no sustaining power in that
[24:55] fleshly joy cannot endure
[24:59] tests and trials
[25:04] remember when the the word fell on
[25:06] certain ground
[25:07] and they received the word with joy they
[25:10] were shouting they were praising their
[25:12] it was joy they said amen
[25:16] but because there was no deepness
[25:20] in their heart it was more of a surfacy
[25:23] thing
[25:24] after a while they got offended
[25:30] in other words their joy
[25:36] didn't go deep enough
[25:41] the joy that god has for us
[25:45] it's deep it goes it's like a river
[25:49] it's inside of a man it's springing up
[25:52] the joy of the lord can endure every
[25:55] hardship
[25:56] while maintaining a right spirit
[26:00] amen that's what the joy of the lord
[26:03] will do for you
[26:05] brother john you got to break this stuff
[26:07] down we're going to break it down i need
[26:08] to make some statements
[26:11] we need to turn our fleshly joy into
[26:14] heaviness
[26:15] our carnality into the presence of god
[26:20] god is meek the bible tells us this he
[26:23] is lowly
[26:24] he is humble these are just scriptures
[26:26] in the bible and he wants
[26:27] that character to be in us as well
[26:31] isaiah chapter 29 verse 19 says the meek
[26:34] also
[26:35] shall increase their joy in the lord
[26:38] not the proud not the arrogant not to
[26:41] somebody that's got everything figured
[26:43] out
[26:43] the meek the same ones that inherit the
[26:46] earth
[26:48] amen amen so we need to understand if we
[26:52] want joy
[26:53] we need to pay attention right here of
[26:55] how we
[26:56] need to be
[27:00] what's what's wonderful about this is i
[27:03] don't care where you're at
[27:04] what's happening in your life you can
[27:06] turn it around just like that
[27:09] james chapter 4 verse 10 says humble
[27:12] yourselves
[27:13] in the sight of the lord and he
[27:17] shall lift you up you know what i've
[27:20] noticed brother is most people
[27:22] want to be lifted up without humbling
[27:24] themselves before the lord
[27:28] we all want to be lifted up but do we
[27:30] want to humble ourselves before the lord
[27:35] we need to take advice from james here
[27:38] humble
[27:38] yourself psalms 30 verse 5 says weeping
[27:41] may endure for a night
[27:43] but joy cometh in the morning it's a
[27:46] promise
[27:47] if we humble ourselves in the sight of
[27:49] the lord he will
[27:50] lift us up it's a promise we got to
[27:52] believe it we got to confess it
[27:54] we got to stand on it
[27:59] i can't help it that god wants us to
[28:01] humble ourselves
[28:02] it's his rules
[28:05] why get mad at the messenger why
[28:09] why say well you know i just want to
[28:10] come to church and i want to feel so
[28:12] good i know the things i've heard so
[28:13] much about inviting people
[28:15] to church and asking me how about our
[28:17] church and
[28:18] and what they like about their church
[28:20] it's always about the music
[28:22] and how it makes them feel good or how
[28:25] the minister
[28:26] just makes them laugh oh
[28:31] it's like there's no breaking down no
[28:34] breaking down of them
[28:35] they just want to continue to be lifted
[28:37] up in the flesh
[28:39] and they never meet the joy of the lord
[28:41] they never meet
[28:42] what they need to endure
[28:46] nehemiah chapter 10 then nehemiah said
[28:49] unto them
[28:49] go your way eat the fat drink the sweet
[28:53] send portions unto them for whom nothing
[28:56] is prepared for for
[28:57] this day is holy unto the lord neither
[29:00] be
[29:00] sorry for the joy of the lord
[29:04] is your strength hallelujah
[29:07] neither be sorry for the joy of the lord
[29:11] is your strength now i'm going to tell
[29:12] you
[29:14] if your heart was humble there would be
[29:17] no need
[29:18] to humble yourself you're
[29:22] already where god told you to go
[29:25] other words you're right there ready to
[29:28] receive
[29:29] the joy of the lord and what's important
[29:32] about the joy of the lord
[29:34] it's your strength it's your strength
[29:39] the joy of the lord is your strength our
[29:42] joy
[29:42] is weak it has limitations it can only
[29:46] put up with so much i've had
[29:49] allah that's our joy
[29:53] it's our love it's our joy but the joy
[29:57] of the lord
[29:58] is strong it's limitless
[30:02] its strength can endure the greatest
[30:05] difficulties in our lives
[30:08] and we know that joy is actually a fruit
[30:11] of the holy ghost
[30:13] so if you have the holy ghost you have
[30:16] a portion of god's joy
[30:20] well i'm not feeling it
[30:23] well this is time to do some checkups
[30:29] you know when you go to the dentist and
[30:31] you're going because you're doing your
[30:32] six-month checkup
[30:36] you don't want to go because
[30:39] the chances of them saying your teeth
[30:42] look better than they did six months ago
[30:45] are not very good
[30:50] i'm always hearing have you been
[30:52] flossing john
[30:54] it looks like you need to pick up on the
[30:56] flossing
[31:01] we need to get the the
[31:04] the main dentist in here so he can like
[31:07] look at this area because i got some
[31:08] questions
[31:15] the joy of the lord is our strength we
[31:17] need the joy of the lord
[31:19] a lot of times believers find themselves
[31:21] in a weak state of mind
[31:23] that's right searching for strength to
[31:26] press forward
[31:27] and in reality what they're missing is
[31:29] simply the joy of the lord
[31:36] i'll tell you what provoked this whole
[31:37] message was my precious brother larry
[31:40] honestly yesterday not yesterday but
[31:44] last service
[31:45] brother larry came and it was just like
[31:47] the lord
[31:48] you know speaking to me he said well
[31:50] brother john i sure hope you got a
[31:53] you got an encouraging message for me
[31:54] today i need you i need it
[31:57] and i thought oh lord why do i have to
[31:59] preach this message say my brother needs
[32:02] my brother needs strength
[32:05] and oh it was just a burden on my heart
[32:07] and i was
[32:08] i just felt like lord your people
[32:14] they need to be lifted up encouraged and
[32:16] strengthened
[32:18] got to thinking about the subject the
[32:20] joy
[32:21] of the lord is our strength
[32:25] never underestimate the power of god's
[32:27] joy
[32:29] when jesus faced the greatest trial of
[32:32] his life which we know
[32:34] was he lay down his life for his friends
[32:38] when he faced the greatest trial of his
[32:40] life
[32:41] it was joy that seeded through it was
[32:44] joy that gave him the strength to do
[32:46] that
[32:47] we never want to underestimate the power
[32:51] that there is in the joy of the lord
[32:55] hebrews chapter 12 verse 2 says looking
[32:57] unto jesus the author
[32:59] and the finisher of our faith who for
[33:02] the joy
[33:03] that was set before him he endured the
[33:06] cross despising the same and set down
[33:08] the right hand of the throne of god
[33:10] jesus endured death
[33:13] with the joy that was set before him i
[33:15] want you to think about that
[33:16] he endured death
[33:20] with the joy that was set before him he
[33:22] laid down
[33:23] his life for his friends with joy
[33:29] brother sister you do not need
[33:32] anything but the joy of the lord today
[33:36] i don't care what your situation is i
[33:38] don't care what you're going through
[33:40] i don't care what you're facing and what
[33:42] you want to see
[33:43] change what you really need is the joy
[33:46] of the lord in your heart
[33:48] jesus died as a man he did not
[33:52] die as god god cannot die but he
[33:55] he died as a man god became a man
[33:59] to die like a man and it took
[34:02] the joy of the lord to see him through
[34:05] think about it don't underestimate
[34:08] call on the lord humble yourselves do
[34:10] what you got to do
[34:12] to get in the presence of the lord
[34:15] philippians chapter 2 verse 7 but
[34:19] made himself of no reputation and took
[34:22] upon him the form of a servant and was
[34:24] made in the likeness of men
[34:26] and being found in fashion as a man what
[34:29] did he do
[34:30] he humbled himself even more and he
[34:34] became obedient
[34:37] unto death even the death
[34:40] of the cross wow
[34:45] so at this time that he had to actually
[34:48] go
[34:48] and give his life he didn't
[34:52] he was looking for strength in the
[34:54] garden he was praying
[34:56] lord if it's possible let this cup pass
[34:58] from me and he had to pray that like
[35:00] three times because there was a battle
[35:03] going on
[35:03] and he was he was needing joy
[35:07] and god placed in front of him
[35:11] joy hallelujah
[35:14] god placed in front of jesus joy
[35:18] and that joy was you and me
[35:21] he placed our salvation in front of
[35:25] jesus that he could look
[35:26] and know that if he went through this
[35:28] test they would be
[35:30] saved and so often we find ourselves
[35:33] struggling with some situation with some
[35:35] family member
[35:36] somebody at work somebody at church some
[35:39] situation
[35:40] and god god has wanted you to lay down
[35:42] your life that someone can get closer to
[35:44] god
[35:46] you got to put that joy in front of you
[35:50] you got to stop thinking about yourself
[35:51] jesus didn't think about himself
[35:55] he was thinking about others
[35:59] the joy of the lord is your strength
[36:04] it took real strength to do what he did
[36:08] something took place inside of him a
[36:11] real
[36:11] incentive it was the joy of knowing that
[36:15] we would be here on this day
[36:17] in this church listening to this message
[36:20] talking about what he did at calvary
[36:23] [Applause]
[36:24] amen
[36:26] that's how great our god is this is the
[36:29] purpose of god
[36:30] to get all of his family together
[36:35] and he's not done the sacrifice was
[36:38] finished at calvary when he said it
[36:40] but the work that you and i need to be
[36:43] carrying out
[36:44] is not over yet today
[36:48] we got to fit in
[36:52] got to get back to the purpose that god
[36:56] has for us
[37:00] isaiah 53 verse 10 yet it please the
[37:03] lord
[37:04] to bruise him think about this
[37:08] it pleased the father to bruise jesus
[37:14] he put him to grief
[37:17] when thou shall make his soul an
[37:19] offering
[37:21] he shall see his seed
[37:24] for the joy that was set before him he
[37:28] saw his seed
[37:30] and if you could just realize that if
[37:32] you lay down your life for your brother
[37:34] you've got to have a vision that that
[37:36] seed
[37:37] belongs to you you're part of that
[37:39] that's your brother that your sister
[37:41] that's part of the family of god that
[37:43] ought to give you enough to lay down
[37:44] your life
[37:47] problem is you get on the devil's side
[37:52] start judging who's who
[37:56] you go ahead and you finish reading in
[37:57] the book of james it's the very
[38:00] next verse he talks about that we're not
[38:02] supposed to think evil
[38:04] speak evil or judge evil of anybody
[38:07] amen that's anti-humbling yourself
[38:13] which is antichrist
[38:20] brother sister god's joy can give you
[38:23] strength to handle
[38:24] any adversity with
[38:28] out getting a wrong spirit
[38:33] while maintaining a right spirit now you
[38:35] got to understand this
[38:41] as soon as we get the wrong spirit
[38:46] as soon as we get the wrong spirit god
[38:48] is not going to stand there and say i
[38:50] take credit for this
[38:56] brother adam says i this is where i
[38:58] divide my line if i have to choose one
[39:00] of the two
[39:02] i'll take the right spirit you can keep
[39:05] the doctrine
[39:07] because a lot of religious devils will
[39:09] take the doctrine the truth
[39:12] and get so twisted up and send so many
[39:15] people in the wrong direction
[39:18] but a right spirit will always lead you
[39:21] and guide you
[39:21] into all truth so put the emphasis
[39:26] on the spirit that you project out
[39:30] anyone can get psyched up get people to
[39:33] agree with you
[39:34] get so you can feel good about a certain
[39:37] situation
[39:38] but that has not one thing to do with
[39:40] god's strength
[39:42] to turn your cheek or to lay down
[39:45] your life
[39:49] all i got to get we used to have bob bob
[39:52] used to sit here larry
[39:53] he used to sit right in front of his
[39:55] name is bob
[39:57] he was always my example
[40:00] and then brother mark came i i didn't
[40:03] want to say sister
[40:04] sister kathleen i used to use sister
[40:07] kathleen she said
[40:08] no more
[40:17] we can get so thinking we're right about
[40:20] something so strong
[40:22] all i got to get is a few people to
[40:24] agree with me see what i'm doing get so
[40:26] psyched up
[40:26] get the scriptures that we think back up
[40:28] what we're doing
[40:30] and feel like we got it as soon as the
[40:34] trial comes
[40:36] all sudden spirit changes that is not
[40:40] the joy of the lord
[40:43] that's you thinking it's god's joy but
[40:46] it's not it's a fleshly joy
[40:49] the joy of the lord gives you strength
[40:53] to endure all things
[40:58] hey if it can endure giving your life
[41:00] for us
[41:01] after praying three times take this
[41:04] situation away from me
[41:06] how much more ought to do for us when
[41:08] all we got to do is lay down
[41:10] our flesh we don't gotta
[41:13] die on the cross we gotta die to ourself
[41:18] that joy of the lord is what we need in
[41:19] our situations
[41:21] and it's a real thing it's tangible
[41:27] well how i want there to be a front row
[41:30] line of people getting into this
[41:33] we need that brother mike up here the
[41:35] other day when he was getting into the
[41:36] message remember that brother mike
[41:38] he said that's some good preach and he
[41:40] said
[41:42] not nothing to do with the preaching but
[41:43] just the word is this the word we need
[41:46] the joy of the lord the devil don't want
[41:48] you
[41:48] happy he doesn't want you full of joy
[41:52] he doesn't want you to have the strength
[41:54] of the lord
[41:59] the way to get more of god's
[42:02] joy is to get rid of yours
[42:08] and just honestly just say god fill me
[42:10] with your joy
[42:12] get this substitute away from me hebrews
[42:14] chapter 12 verse 1.
[42:16] wherefore seeing we also are compassed
[42:18] about what so greater cloud or witnesses
[42:20] let us lay aside every weight well so
[42:22] what's the weight
[42:23] me right i'm in the way
[42:28] lay aside every weight and the unbelief
[42:31] which does so easily beset us and let us
[42:35] run with patience the race that set
[42:38] before us
[42:40] and excuse me as we're running you've
[42:43] got to keep your eyes
[42:44] on the author and the finisher of our
[42:47] faith
[42:48] who for the joy that was set before him
[42:49] endured the cross despised the same as
[42:51] sat down at the right hand of the throne
[42:53] of god
[42:53] for consider this man consider him
[42:57] that endured such contradiction
[43:00] of sinners against himself lest ye be
[43:04] wearied
[43:04] and faint in your mind so here the
[43:07] writer
[43:08] to the hebrews is trying to get our
[43:11] focus
[43:11] on considering what jesus went through
[43:15] he didn't even have anybody standing
[43:17] with him he didn't have a parade
[43:19] he didn't have a float he didn't have a
[43:22] group
[43:22] that was with with um you know go
[43:25] republicans go
[43:26] democrats uh he didn't have a committee
[43:30] his own disciples left he was left alone
[43:32] to die on the cross for you
[43:34] and we need the strength of the lord the
[43:36] joy of the lord if we're gonna do that
[43:38] for somebody
[43:41] so consider this man lest you faint in
[43:44] your mind because of what you're going
[43:45] through you think it's too hard for you
[43:47] it is not too hard my god is not a liar
[43:50] he doesn't lie
[43:52] he'll never put anything on you that you
[43:54] cannot bear
[43:55] but will he will make a way of escape
[43:58] and the joy of the lord is your strength
[44:02] i want to read this kind of quick we
[44:04] don't have a lot of time
[44:06] but i think it would be good verse
[44:08] number four let's just pick that up
[44:10] you have not yet resisted unto blood
[44:14] striving against sin and you have
[44:17] forgotten
[44:18] you have forgotten you have forgotten
[44:21] the
[44:21] exhortation which speaketh unto you as
[44:24] unto children
[44:25] god deals with us in certain ways my son
[44:28] despise not the chastening of the lord
[44:32] nor faint when thou art rebuked
[44:35] of him well you know i'll just have you
[44:37] to say ah you know i know
[44:39] god has never rebuked me
[44:42] never never my god loves me
[44:46] he would never never never say anything
[44:49] to make me feel bad
[44:51] yet it pleased him to bruise
[44:55] jesus he made a flesh
[44:59] went and dwelt in it and then died
[45:04] and you think he's going to
[45:07] cater to your flesh
[45:12] the flesh is enmity with him the way it
[45:14] thinks the way it's pampered he looked
[45:16] at peter
[45:16] and he said satan get behind me thou
[45:20] thou abhorus and now you don't
[45:24] care about the things of god you only
[45:25] care about the things that please
[45:27] man excuse me for paraphrasing that
[45:30] verse but that's just the flesh
[45:34] that's just the flesh nobody wants to
[45:37] suffer i don't want to suffer and i'm
[45:38] not
[45:39] preaching suffering but what i'm telling
[45:40] you there's something greater
[45:42] there's something greater than anything
[45:45] that god allows you to go through and it
[45:47] is the joy of the lord
[45:53] you know if i was listening to this
[45:56] service
[45:57] i'd be shouting hallelujah
[46:03] now if you endure chastening god deal
[46:06] with you
[46:07] as with sons
[46:10] for what son is he whom the father
[46:12] chasteneth not
[46:14] but if you be without chastise and
[46:16] everybody wants to be
[46:17] you know what can i say everybody wants
[46:19] to be we're for all
[46:21] our partakers then are ye bastards and
[46:24] not sons
[46:25] furthermore we've had fathers of our
[46:27] flesh who corrected us and gave us
[46:29] reverence
[46:29] and we gave them reverence shall we not
[46:32] much more
[46:33] rather be subject unto the father
[46:35] spirits and live
[46:38] for they very for a few days chasteness
[46:40] after their own pleasure
[46:42] but he for our profit that we might be
[46:45] partakers of his holiness
[46:47] how many times have you you got such an
[46:50] attitude towards your mom and dad
[46:52] because they did something you didn't
[46:54] think was fair
[46:58] and i'll have to say there's a lot of
[47:01] innocent people that have gone to prison
[47:05] that's right there's a lot of guilty
[47:07] people that got off the hook
[47:10] things ain't fair life ain't fair
[47:15] yeah our parents probably did spank us
[47:18] and and scold us and yell at us and do a
[47:20] lot of things
[47:21] just for their flesh
[47:26] not god god isn't like that
[47:30] he cares about your character he cares
[47:34] about you
[47:35] becoming him the image of jesus christ
[47:39] he was the firstborn among many brethren
[47:41] you are that brethren
[47:42] you've been predestinated to be in his
[47:44] image this is how we become in his image
[47:49] you know if we never go through trials
[47:50] we'll never find out really where we're
[47:51] at
[47:52] we'll never really know the character we
[47:55] are we'll sit there in the seat thinking
[47:56] that we're something when we're not
[48:01] but when we go through that test and we
[48:03] see where we come
[48:04] short that's god's love that's god's
[48:06] mercy that's god
[48:07] showing you where you're at what you
[48:09] need to do
[48:15] now no chasing for the present seemeth
[48:17] to be joyous
[48:19] no way but grievous nevertheless
[48:22] afterwards it yields the peaceable
[48:24] fruits of righteousness
[48:27] unto them which are exercised thereby
[48:31] isn't that beautiful that's what we have
[48:33] to look forward to
[48:35] god don't do nothing i don't do anything
[48:38] for nothing he's always a purpose
[48:41] wherefore he says now this is for us
[48:43] wherefore lift up
[48:45] your lift up the hands which hang down
[48:49] and the feeble knees and make straight
[48:53] for the pat's paths for your feet
[48:57] lest that which is lame i'm sorry lest
[49:00] that which is lame be turned out of the
[49:02] way
[49:03] but let it rather be healed
[49:07] follow peace with
[49:10] all men and holiness without which
[49:14] no man shall see the lord looking
[49:16] diligently remember our second verse
[49:18] looking unto jesus the author
[49:20] and finisher of our faith looking
[49:21] diligently lest
[49:23] any man fail of the grace of god
[49:26] lest any root of bitterness spring
[49:29] up and trouble you and thereby
[49:32] defile many be defiled
[49:38] you take your eyes off jesus this is
[49:39] what happens
[49:46] if i don't believe for the grace of god
[49:49] for bob
[49:51] what good am i
[49:54] what if i got some bitterness springs up
[49:57] about bob
[49:59] before you know it i'm going to tell
[50:00] bob's sister
[50:04] i'm going to defile many
[50:07] why because love is missing
[50:13] love is missing
[50:16] well brother john you don't understand
[50:22] i'm so glad that we got a five-fold
[50:23] ministry to make me understand
[50:29] i'm thankful for revival ministry
[50:32] we can lose our joy for many reasons
[50:37] most if not all are for failing
[50:41] or falling out of a perfect communion
[50:45] with the lord it may not be
[50:49] as drastic as as david when he fell when
[50:52] he messed up
[50:54] yet he followed the correct path back to
[50:57] the lord he humbled
[50:58] himself before the lord and it's the
[51:01] correct
[51:02] and precise path to the joy of the lord
[51:06] is to humble yourself now we don't got
[51:08] time to read it
[51:09] but he starts out talking about his sin
[51:12] and what he did
[51:13] he and his sin he only sinned against
[51:15] the lord
[51:17] and then he gets into his his prayer
[51:19] there and he's talking about you know
[51:20] i've been a sinner
[51:22] from my from my birth his whole life
[51:28] and he just wanted the joy of the lord
[51:32] back
[51:32] he wanted that fellowship back with the
[51:35] lord he said in psalms 51 verse 8
[51:37] make me to hear joy and gladness
[51:41] verse 12 restore unto me the joy
[51:44] of thy salvation and uphold me with thy
[51:47] free spirit
[51:50] there's a lot of things that can zap our
[51:52] joy
[51:53] the spirit of worldliness the things of
[51:56] the world
[51:58] iniquities not doing the things that we
[52:01] know
[52:01] we should be doing because he told us
[52:03] already
[52:04] remaining faithful at what he has spoken
[52:07] to you
[52:08] things can zap the joy out because that
[52:11] grieves the lord how we can act
[52:17] we've got to remain connected to the
[52:20] holy ghost
[52:21] for communion and fellowship
[52:25] john chapter 15 let's turn there
[52:29] let's see if we can get through this
[52:34] because i'll tell you if we can get this
[52:37] under the microscope here
[52:40] we don't have to be looking for
[52:41] temporary things to make us happy
[52:45] i am the true vine and my father is the
[52:47] husbandman every branch in me
[52:49] uh that beareth not fruit is taken away
[52:52] and every branch that bear
[52:53] fruit he purges it that he may bring
[52:54] forth more fruit
[52:56] now ye are clean through the word which
[52:57] i have spoken unto you abide in me abide
[53:00] in the word that i've given you
[53:02] i've already cleansed you i've already
[53:04] washed you and you're cleaned by the
[53:05] word now it's up to you
[53:07] to abide in that word and i in you as
[53:09] the branch cannot bear fruit of itself
[53:11] except it abide in the vine no more can
[53:14] you
[53:15] except you abide in me i want the joy of
[53:18] the lord bubbling out of me
[53:20] i have a responsibility to stay
[53:23] connected to the word
[53:26] all the word you got a big
[53:31] 55 gallon drum it only takes one little
[53:35] hole
[53:36] for all of it to leak out so why talk
[53:40] about
[53:40] all this other area of this drum that's
[53:43] so perfectly sealed
[53:45] we need to talk about the one area that
[53:48] god wants us to take care of
[53:51] and i don't know what that is it's up to
[53:53] you to find out
[53:54] look it i got my own problems finding
[53:56] out where they're at
[54:03] i am the vine ye are the branches he
[54:05] that abideth in me and i in him the same
[54:07] bringeth forth
[54:09] much fruit for without me you can do
[54:10] nothing
[54:12] i cannot get the joy of the lord without
[54:14] the holy ghost
[54:16] if a man abide not in me he is cast
[54:19] forth as a branch and is withered and
[54:21] men gather them and cast them into the
[54:22] fire and they are burned
[54:24] if you abide in me and my words abide in
[54:26] you then you shall ask what you will and
[54:27] it shall be done unto you
[54:29] what a promise from god amen but we
[54:32] gotta abide in him we gotta have his
[54:34] word
[54:34] abide in us praise the lord
[54:39] herein is my father glorified that ye
[54:42] bear much fruit so shall you be my
[54:44] disciples as the father have loved me so
[54:46] i have loved you continue in my love
[54:49] if you keep my commandments ye shall
[54:52] abide in my love even as i have kept
[54:54] my father's commandments and abide in
[54:57] his love
[54:58] these things have i spoken unto you that
[55:01] my joy my joy
[55:04] might remain in you
[55:08] god holds the string of his joy
[55:11] in you
[55:16] we want joy joy comes from the lord
[55:23] and he's given us these precious words
[55:25] and i know it's running late
[55:27] but these words say i'm telling you all
[55:30] this today
[55:31] is so that my joy might remain in you so
[55:34] you're not
[55:34] questioning what happened why is this
[55:37] why do i feel like why is it a struggle
[55:39] why am i why do i feel so down
[55:44] it's written here
[55:49] if we care enough i'll tell you this
[55:53] god has not failed one person
[55:56] he has not fallen asleep and forgotten
[55:58] oh yeah
[55:59] this person needed joy i should have
[56:01] gave it to him but i messed up hopefully
[56:03] he'll forgive me
[56:06] god don't mess up god don't come short
[56:09] we mess up we come short and we've got
[56:12] to humble ourselves to find out where we
[56:14] did mess up where we did come
[56:15] short
[56:20] these things have i spoken unto you that
[56:23] my joy might remain with you and that
[56:26] your joy
[56:28] might be full
[56:32] now why is this so important
[56:35] this is my commandment that you love one
[56:37] another as i have loved you greater love
[56:39] have no men
[56:40] than this and a man lay down his life
[56:42] for his friends and ye
[56:44] are my friends if you do whatsoever i
[56:47] command you
[56:50] it's a pretty well clear package right
[56:52] there what we need to do
[56:54] praise the lord these things have i
[56:57] spoken unto you that my joy might remain
[57:00] with you and that your joy might be full
[57:03] the only way that your joy is going to
[57:04] be full
[57:05] is with god's joy your joy
[57:09] is you may have joy for a moment because
[57:12] you're
[57:12] on the greatest ride at cedar point
[57:16] or you're listening to your favorite
[57:18] song or somebody just put you up on a
[57:20] pedestal
[57:24] but after a while it's not really full
[57:28] but when you get full of god's joy when
[57:31] the pedestal is gone
[57:32] the ride is done and you're there's a
[57:35] need with your brother
[57:36] you're right they're laying down your
[57:38] life still filled with the same joy
[57:41] hallelujah our joy is only partial
[57:45] remember that god's joy
[57:47] is full in every trial
[57:51] how many want more joy
[57:54] into the presence of god labor in prayer
[57:58] psalms 16 verse 11
[58:03] thou will show me the path of life in
[58:06] thy presence
[58:07] is the fullness of joy
[58:10] at thy right hand there are pleasures
[58:13] forevermore
[58:14] so where is god's joy in his presence
[58:18] that's why the fruit of the spirit is
[58:20] joy one of the fruit of the spirits is
[58:21] joy
[58:22] because the holy ghost is his presence
[58:26] i mean and if we're feeling like
[58:27] something's separating
[58:30] brother brethren talk to us about that
[58:32] holy spirit
[58:33] just going kind of sitting there waiting
[58:35] for what waiting for something to change
[58:38] with us
[58:40] now look all we got to do is want it
[58:43] so bad that we're willing to humble
[58:45] ourself call on the lord
[58:47] god fill me with you i want to be filled
[58:49] with your presence
[58:52] get shed this flesh shed it
[59:00] god inhabits the praises of his people
[59:03] we ought to be laboring much harder than
[59:05] we do to enter into his presence
[59:08] we come in if we hard for us to say amen
[59:11] to something brother ron saying about
[59:13] the song or something he's saying
[59:14] between songs
[59:16] what's what's happening i don't feel
[59:19] like it i don't feel led of the lord
[59:21] look friend i don't feel like laboring
[59:24] but i need to labor
[59:28] if you really want to joy the lord
[59:30] you're going to have to labor
[59:32] you have to labor to enter into his
[59:34] presence
[59:35] because in his presence is the fullness
[59:38] of joy
[59:38] amen god is a rewarder
[59:42] of them that diligently seek his
[59:44] presence
[59:47] psalms 27 verse 6 therefore while i
[59:50] offer in this
[59:51] tabernacle sacrifices of joy
[59:55] i ain't got time to do it but if you
[59:57] want to read it sometime in verse 28
[1:00:00] not verse 28 deuteronomy chapter 28
[1:00:03] will find you'll find in there that god
[1:00:05] promised that he would bless his people
[1:00:07] if they would keep his commandments
[1:00:10] and he would make them the head and not
[1:00:12] the tale but he says if you didn't
[1:00:14] then you would be cursed in other words
[1:00:16] there is no
[1:00:17] switzerland with god there's no neutral
[1:00:20] you're either being blessed
[1:00:21] or you're being cursed with him but this
[1:00:24] is what he said
[1:00:26] he said because you did not serve me
[1:00:30] with joy and gladness i will curse you
[1:00:34] that's strong we can't serve god
[1:00:38] half-heartedly he wants us to put our
[1:00:40] heart into it
[1:00:42] god loves a cheerful giver he wants
[1:00:44] something that's going to come in this
[1:00:45] tabernacle and offer
[1:00:46] sacrifices of joy and praise and enter
[1:00:49] into his gates the right way
[1:00:51] not the way we feel not our carnal way
[1:00:58] psalms 63 verse 5 my mouth shall fill
[1:01:02] thee
[1:01:03] with joy shall praise thee with joyful
[1:01:06] lips
[1:01:07] my mouth shall praise thee with joyful
[1:01:11] lips not
[1:01:13] i am for the promised land
[1:01:22] these lips need to be showing some joy
[1:01:27] psalms 95 1 oh come let us sing unto the
[1:01:31] lord
[1:01:31] let us make a joyful noise to what the
[1:01:34] rock
[1:01:35] of our salvation
[1:01:38] well brother john i just don't feel like
[1:01:40] it you know what you're doing you're
[1:01:41] just expressing to me
[1:01:43] where you're at with the lord
[1:01:48] you've got to labor to enter into his
[1:01:50] presence psalms
[1:01:51] not psalms isaiah chapter 40 we're not
[1:01:54] going to have time
[1:01:54] to get through everything but god help
[1:01:57] us to get through what you want us to
[1:01:58] get through today isaiah
[1:02:00] chapter 40 verse 28 has thou not known
[1:02:03] has thou not heard
[1:02:04] that the everlasting god the lord the
[1:02:06] creator of the ends of the earth
[1:02:07] fainteth not neither is weary
[1:02:11] in other words god is not missing
[1:02:14] anything
[1:02:15] [Laughter]
[1:02:17] god is not sitting here searching oh i
[1:02:20] wish i had this
[1:02:22] [Music]
[1:02:23] there's no searching of his
[1:02:25] understanding
[1:02:26] and he giveth power to us
[1:02:32] he giveth power to us
[1:02:35] to the faint and to them
[1:02:39] that have no might
[1:02:43] he increaseth strength
[1:02:46] even the youth shall faint and be weary
[1:02:49] and the young men
[1:02:50] shall utterly fall but they that
[1:02:53] wait upon the lord
[1:02:56] shall renew their strength they shall
[1:02:58] mount up with wings as he
[1:03:00] they shall run and not be worthy they
[1:03:01] shall walk and not
[1:03:03] faint the reward of waiting
[1:03:06] in prayer is renewed joy renewed
[1:03:10] strength that's the reward of waiting
[1:03:14] on the lord in prayer
[1:03:18] well brother john it's really hard there
[1:03:20] is no other avenue
[1:03:22] jesus said when i come shall i find
[1:03:25] faith on the earth it's getting worse
[1:03:27] and worse in this world
[1:03:29] i read that verse i didn't know anything
[1:03:31] about colvin 19.
[1:03:35] it's just getting worse jesus gave us a
[1:03:39] parable
[1:03:40] when he told us about that the the the
[1:03:42] widow the persistent widdle
[1:03:45] and it was a prayer to this end that men
[1:03:48] ought to
[1:03:48] always pray amen and not faint
[1:03:53] well brother john the reason i'm
[1:03:54] feigning right now is because
[1:03:57] my boss he punched me
[1:04:02] no you're fainting because you have not
[1:04:05] taken that punch and got on your knees
[1:04:09] to get a hold of god
[1:04:13] though he slayed me yet well i trust him
[1:04:19] it's not what you're going through you
[1:04:20] don't have to describe to me how this
[1:04:23] great trial that you're going through is
[1:04:25] so hard what i want you to do is stand
[1:04:27] up here and testify
[1:04:28] about the joy of the lord that's what i
[1:04:30] want you to do get into the presence of
[1:04:32] god
[1:04:33] let the presence of god be so strong
[1:04:35] inside of you
[1:04:38] it'll take you through friends in his
[1:04:41] presence
[1:04:42] is fullness of joy fullness of joy
[1:04:46] in his presence why aren't we well
[1:04:50] brother john i just don't feel like
[1:04:51] doing it
[1:04:52] okay but don't blame the preacher
[1:04:55] because he's not preaching right
[1:04:58] don't blame your boss who punched you
[1:05:02] don't don't blame your brother who
[1:05:04] didn't shake your hand
[1:05:06] you know i'm not saying nothing about
[1:05:07] you i'm leaving you for sunday
[1:05:12] we're taking turns sometimes bob
[1:05:14] sometimes you
[1:05:18] god has made a way for us to receive
[1:05:21] strength
[1:05:25] we don't need a caffeine pick-me-upper
[1:05:30] we need somebody to encourage us and
[1:05:32] help us and
[1:05:34] make us feel good that's that only helps
[1:05:37] for a short
[1:05:38] a short period of time
[1:05:41] and and i'm not against things
[1:05:44] like that but i'm against living on that
[1:05:50] you can't live on that but you can
[1:05:53] live on the joy of the lord
[1:05:57] when you have that you have strength
[1:06:00] to go through anything i'm telling you
[1:06:03] his
[1:06:04] strength is the same yesterday today
[1:06:07] and forever his strength isn't going to
[1:06:10] disappear
[1:06:11] unless you decide to get dispatched
[1:06:14] to something he's commanded you to do
[1:06:18] and he might have commanded you to do
[1:06:19] something you don't want to do friends
[1:06:22] maybe we've just been a little bit
[1:06:27] picky that's good good smorgasbord
[1:06:30] a smorgasbord can't get picky
[1:06:34] man shall not live by pickiness
[1:06:37] but by every word that proceedeth out of
[1:06:41] the mouth of god
[1:06:42] you know a lot of times we're not really
[1:06:44] hearing from the lord the way we should
[1:06:47] because we've got so used to coming to
[1:06:49] church and feeling
[1:06:51] i did my duty
[1:06:54] and it never personally connects
[1:06:58] but that personal connection is so
[1:06:59] important because if you don't get it
[1:07:01] you'll never carry it out you'll never
[1:07:03] get the joy of the lord
[1:07:08] god is trying to take us somewhere
[1:07:16] just a couple more minutes first peter
[1:07:19] chapter one verse three
[1:07:20] verse nine what what i don't like about
[1:07:22] this is at the end these are all the
[1:07:24] good scriptures and things and
[1:07:25] the the ones that are encouraging first
[1:07:28] peter
[1:07:30] chapter one starting with verse number
[1:07:32] three blessed be the god and father of
[1:07:34] our lord jesus christ which have
[1:07:36] which according to his abundant mercy
[1:07:38] have begotten us
[1:07:40] onto a lively hope by the resurrection
[1:07:43] jesus christ from the dead
[1:07:44] to an inheritance incorruptible
[1:07:46] undefiled and that faith not await
[1:07:48] reserved in heaven
[1:07:50] for you now isn't that exciting
[1:07:53] i'll tell you i'll say about any
[1:07:55] believer you know would get excited
[1:07:57] about that scripture
[1:07:59] who are kept by the power of god
[1:08:02] through faith unto salvation ready to be
[1:08:04] revealed in the last time
[1:08:06] wherein ye greatly rejoice
[1:08:09] though now for a season if need be
[1:08:13] ye are in heaviness through manifold
[1:08:17] temptations that the trial of your faith
[1:08:22] being much more precious than of gold
[1:08:25] that perisheth
[1:08:26] though it be tried with fire might be
[1:08:29] found
[1:08:29] unto the praise and honor and glory
[1:08:33] at the peering of jesus christ
[1:08:37] now who are we to say to the potter
[1:08:41] i don't need what i'm going through
[1:08:43] right now
[1:08:46] if need be well who determines that
[1:08:50] god does god determines that
[1:08:53] whom having not seen ye love
[1:08:58] praise god in whom though now you see
[1:09:01] him not yet believing you rejoice
[1:09:04] with a joy that's so unspeakable
[1:09:08] and full of glory amen
[1:09:13] it's so full of glory
[1:09:16] joy i can't even talk about it it just i
[1:09:20] i just laid on my life i step on me i
[1:09:22] lay down my life again they step on me i
[1:09:24] lay down my life again they step
[1:09:25] on me but it's joy unspeakable and
[1:09:28] that's what the joy of the lord is
[1:09:30] it's not you being happy when you get
[1:09:33] what you want when you want how you want
[1:09:35] it as long as you're being treated good
[1:09:37] it's about laying down your life for the
[1:09:39] purpose of god
[1:09:42] god gave you joy for why did why did god
[1:09:45] tell his disciples
[1:09:47] you wait jerusalem to you getting deal
[1:09:49] with power from on high
[1:09:52] why because if god sent them out to go
[1:09:55] do something
[1:09:56] first little persecution they would get
[1:09:58] they would go run
[1:09:59] and so you know they they were unfair
[1:10:06] when you get the joy of the lord you can
[1:10:08] sit in prison and praise god with chains
[1:10:13] when you get the joy of the lord you can
[1:10:15] go through what you're going through and
[1:10:17] still
[1:10:18] lay down your life because when they
[1:10:19] were in prison they wanted to save that
[1:10:22] jailer because there was a chance
[1:10:25] they weren't wanting to get back they
[1:10:28] were wanting to get back to those that
[1:10:29] threw him in prison
[1:10:30] and they weren't wanting to run they
[1:10:32] went right back to the pulpit
[1:10:33] and began to preach the same word that
[1:10:35] god gave them
[1:10:38] that's what the joy the lord will do for
[1:10:40] you now the joy
[1:10:42] our joy doesn't do that
[1:10:45] our joy is only good for
[1:10:48] a little bit all joy is you know that
[1:10:52] you go and do something that's real fun
[1:10:54] after a while it's gone
[1:10:56] come on you want me to be
[1:10:59] human with you be human with me
[1:11:02] be honest with me
[1:11:06] you know we're looking for something
[1:11:10] that can only come from god
[1:11:17] the joy of the lord is
[1:11:20] exactly what it is it's the joy of the
[1:11:23] lord
[1:11:24] it's not you practicing your joy
[1:11:29] practicing your strength it's you
[1:11:33] getting yourself out of the way getting
[1:11:35] into his presence
[1:11:36] and when god's presence come your
[1:11:39] strength is renewed
[1:11:40] you can march forward just like jesus
[1:11:43] did in the garden
[1:11:45] think about it when reviled against he
[1:11:47] revowed not back
[1:11:50] because he had joy when he was
[1:11:52] threatened
[1:11:53] he didn't try to get back at him because
[1:11:57] it was the joy
[1:11:58] of the lord our joy
[1:12:01] it's only for a season you get filled
[1:12:04] with
[1:12:04] god's joy and i'm telling you your life
[1:12:07] will turn around you will have so much
[1:12:09] time

[1:12:29] personal
[1:12:30] caffeine of joy you don't need a fleshly
[1:12:34] pick-me-upper all you need to do is
[1:12:37] humble yourself
[1:12:38] and spend time praying into
