TRANSCRIPT
========================================
foreign time Jesus was telling the people they should be very careful what they do to those children of his that their angels are always beholding his father's face Hallelujah it tells you that God is always careful about his elect amen and Day by Day and Night by night he does not leave them he can come around them at all times Hallelujah now the the scripture that we read from the 34 chapter David in the spirit was saying or telling every believer whosoever We Believe about the concern of God about his people Hallelujah he says the angel of the Lord and come round about them that fear Him and delivered him the angel of the Lord they encounter around those that fear Him God and he certainly delivered them also in fact if you have respect for God if you fear God if you honor God if you trust and believe in God certainly God also protects you from any oppression from any enemy from whatever that you can call it God will certainly not leave you he said I will be with you till the end of the world amen he said oh taste and see that the Lord is good in fact tonight we are going to taste the goodness of God like you if you want to know the quality of food it's your tongue that determines diet Hallelujah if you want to know what is in the food you have to put it in your mouth before you can do your judgment and David is telling us tonight also let us taste the goodness of God let us taste the love of God let us take the protections of God so that we can also put our judgment whether God indeed protects or not Hallelujah indeed we are going to do that tonight he said oh fear the lord hear his Saints for there is no want to them that fear Him the Young Lions do lack and suffer hunger but they that seek the Lord shall not want any good thing Hallelujah because everything that he has given to us is more than good hallelujah what is good than the name of God when the Bible says that Adam mention of that name every knee bow and if you have that name then you know that everything must bow before you and that is why the same David said also in chapter 27 he says the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even my enemies and my foes come upon me to eat out my flesh they stumble and fail though an host should encounter against me my heart shall not fear though War should rise against me and this will I be confident one thing have I desired of the Lord that I will seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple amen hallelujah David was so confident that apart from God's protections nothing else and you know in this world that we live man is conscious of fear yeah man is conscious of fear sometimes even in our physical life we are afraid of certain things in our spiritual life sometimes we are afraid of certain things sometimes people have dreams and when they come out from their dream they think the world has come to an end because of things that you have seen in a dream sometimes you see I mean a whole lot of fearful sight in your dream it puts fear in you but you know remember that the prophet said that not all dreams are from God indeed speak to us sometimes in dreams but anything God does Satan impersonates it sometimes Satan will bring certain dreams to us to to even sometimes make us doubt whether we are standing well many times bridgen will tell pastor I have such a dream and I I say brother I am not a dream interpreter if you have the dream and you are confused about it just pray and commit into God's hand and God will take care of the rest Hallelujah you know so there are so many ways whereby we we are always you know so much as we are in this flesh the flesh will always work for that spirit we aim to go forward we aim to persevere we aim to thrive on the word of God but at the same time there are so many things that sometimes try to pull us back okay and and like somebody want to enter into certain things like business and all that and you you find your your mind telling you are you going to succeed are you going to what the Venture that you want to put yourself in is he going to help you or you are going to lose and you know you can put certain fear in you and if you allow the fear to take over then it means you are going to stay put you are not going to venture at all because you are afraid of losing Hallelujah and because of that many times people have false protections for themselves okay it's common in Africa because of fear somebody's afraid that uh his neighbor is going to you know cause some spiritual attack on him or her and for that matter they go for you know fake protections right they go to idle homes to kind of get certain things into their body that it will protect them but brother no matter what protection you think you can get for yourself there will never be any protections that can supersede the protections of God [Music] because any protections a man will give to you on this Earth it has limits Hallelujah it has limited this thing that I'm talking to you now when you come to Africa there is such that sometimes people have secured so many magical powers all is because of fear yeah somebody can be with you here and something will happen and they'll have to vanish because of fear Hallelujah some go to Idol homes and secure themselves that even when you put a gun on them and you shoot it will not penetrate or it's because of fear Hallelujah but brother what will God end you it has expiry date but the only protections that don't have asparity is the protection of God when God have his protections upon you that is what David is saying he said even when my enemy rise to eat up my flesh because of the protections of God they'll fall amen so the profession that we are talking about beloved is not protection of this Earth it's not protections of man but is the protection of the almighty that you have dispatches Holy Angels to guide us in all our ways now if you check the Old Testament you realize as we are all aware that every year the priest has to go to the holies of holies with the blood of animals why he has to go and seek the face of God and when God accepts that sacrifice then he comes out with the blessing of God upon the congregation when he comes out he bring the favor of God upon the people when he comes out he bring the blessings of God upon the people when he comes out he bring protection Hallelujah even under the blast of animals under the blood of bulls but the Bible tells us in Hebrews that those things were not perfect as compared to what you and I we are enjoying now Hallelujah we are under the protections of the blood of Jesus Christ and so if those people even rejoice and have the power and protections how can we what can we say now that today is not the blood of animals it's not a blood of bulls it's not a blood of cows but the blood of God himself [Music] amen that is why we have entered into a perfect holist of holies Hallelujah that is what our protection says when the minister or when the priests enter in there he go and meet the Shekinah Glory even under the blood of animals but here look at our Assurance we did not enter there with the blood of animals but we have entered by the Lord Jesus Christ in those days the high priest goes there and bring the favor of God upon the people but in this our time we have entered there ourselves by the power of Jesus Christ that's why president got there alone but he went there with all of us and that is where our protections are amen amen now one time when Abraham sent elieza to go to his people and look for a wife for his son Isaac you know it was such that Elisa didn't know the place but then he was directed go this way go that way go that way but there was an assurance by Abraham he said the Lord will send his angel to be your guide oh what a blessed hope so Elisa realized that oh if my master have given such an assurance then my ways will be prosperous [Music] and but that's saying he lives of God to the place and then he prayed a prayer they say oh God Let It Be that the dumb self that will come by and I will ask her of water and she will tell me that drink and I also give to your cameras let that be the wife of my master Isaac it was not Angelic protection Hallelujah because he didn't know where he was going but he knew certainly that there was a god of his master Abraham who always favored his people when they cry unto him oh brother Elisa tasted the favor of God and God manifested that indeed I am let's let's see Genesis chapter 20 24 quickly foreign seven this was after Elisa have communed with the family of Rebecca he said and my master made me swear saying Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites in whose land I dwell but thou shall go onto my father's house and to my Kindred and take a wife unto my son and I said unto my master para Adventure the woman will not follow me and he said unto me the Lord before whom I walk will send his angel with thee and prosper thy way and thou shall take a wife for my son of mine Kindred and of my father's house Hallelujah good amen there was an assurance that fear not eliada for my God that I serve my God that brought me out from idolatry my God that brought me out from unbelief my God that brought me from the world he will send an angel to guide you Hallelujah and when elieza didn't doubt this saying it really manifested you see the only thing that takes the blessings away is doubt if you doubt the word of God certainly you are going to fail but when you take it by faith and hold on to the promise where God will certainly manifest himself Hallelujah so therefore Elisa pick up and he prayed that prayer and indeed the angel of the Lord sent the answer to him immediately it was not quite long when he saw the young ladies coming up and down and this particular one came around which was Rebecca he said lady will you please give me water to drink he said yes drink and I'll give also to your your animal or your camera whatsoever and you know the volume of drink one camel can drink they were 10. but this lady with humility Hallelujah you have to have to you know water all these animals Hallelujah and and she was so much happy even in doing that service it was God's guidance because God have already linked them together the prophet said when they give collect unto the Deep there must be a deep to respond God has already prepared the way brother sometimes we we we don't even have to question whatever happened to our way God have already prepared our way God have already prepared our way but sometimes because of situation we ask ourselves question oh God why is this so we don't have to ask God any question the only thing we have to keep doing is to believe and that is it when we keep believing God will always manifest himself to us Hallelujah Once Upon a Time when Moses was running away from responsibility and uh he found himself in Media we all know the story while when he got a woman there to marry and he was taking care of his father-in-law jetro's in our flock Day by Day and Night by night and one day he climbed the mountain to go on the same inner Iran but that particular day something happened to him and it has been the same always it's always one day hallelujah it's always one day da you you are we brother Ron was asking me a question today he said how did I come to the message I said brother I cannot even explain I only remember that one day we're in a church a Pentecostal church and all of a sudden my pastor by then came around he said I have got a new thing and we were kind of what Newton is that right he said it's a message of the hour Hallelujah he said well whether you like it or not this is it if you can't believe believe it if you cannot believe also I cannot force you and in fact when you brought it it broke the church into two many people did not believe it but the few of other remain we have believed the message till today and we have a testimony that indeed God reigneth among his people Hallelujah so it's always one day Moses have been going to this place always coming up and down but that particular day something extraordinary happened the Bible said that he saw a bush burning Hallelujah but the the leaves were not being consumed so that was what attracted him he said what kind of a site is this let me turn and look at it well so I mean the Lord saw that he he tend to look then he mentioned his name Moses Moses don't come nearer remove that Sanders for where thou are standing is a Holy Ground and now this is the purpose I've heard a cry of my people I've come down to deliver them but I'm sending you I know you run away from Egypt but I am sending you back to that place every human being will think twice about this why should I go to a place that I am being wanted oh God you want me to go and give myself up that I will be crucified perhaps that was the thought that came to Moses mind Lord I I wish that you sent somebody else not me not me now amen but will God change his mind God doesn't change his mind about his word if God say it is you it is you whether you can't speak or not if you say it is you it is you whether you can see or not if it say it is you it must be you and nobody else Moses trying to give excuse oh Lord I cannot I cannot speak well I'm a stamina you know my my my accent is not even good you can't use me at this time God said you will I use Hallelujah my angel will be with you he will guide you and he'll tell you what to do I am only giving you two signs and go with it and the people will accept you and God indeed gave him the two signs and we all know the Miracles that Moses rotted in the land of Egypt in fact the prophet said all those angels it was not Moses who wrote them but the angel that God dispatched was the one that was doing the Miracles Moses was just a tool in God's hand like you and I we are just a tool in God's hand to make the name of Christ manifested on this Earth brother what are the word like it or not we in front and we are living the testimony oh yes we are living a testimony soon the people are going to look for us they will not see us oh my I knew this brother my Cosby he invited me to church some time ago I refused where is he I've not seen him for some time yes you will not see him he is no more in Fenton he's in the rapture and that is what is going to be in the life of every one of us oh brother we are waiting for that day we are certainly waiting for that day when I will no longer come from Africa to you know America to see you but we will be around the Throne of God with different testimonies Hallelujah and the Bible said that our voices will blend together and we'll sing the same song because right from the from the beginning the Lord dispatched our angels to protect us to guide us by the way have they not been them brother we wouldn't know where we'll be by now and Moses for that matter I realized that there is no way that you could give excuse for that you know work to be done so he has to give it up and the Lord in this sent you know his Angel to guide him now we all know what happened in the land of Egypt when Moses got there there were so many things that went on when Pharaoh was trying to challenge you know the ability of Moses coming down to tell him that let my people go and even ask him which God have sent you right can you imagine which God have sent you Moses said you want to know the god that I've sent me Aaron cast my rod on the ground and Aaron cuts the road on the ground and it tends to be serpent but look at that they were all laughing because to them it's it's a trick it's a magical trick Hallelujah because Janice and Germans were doing that thing often so it was not a new thing for them Hallelujah so they started laughing but one thing they didn't know was that there was an angel standing by Moses and the angel was the one that was performing The Miracles so down they called Genesis and genres to come up okay to come and also tell show Moses that they can do better and they cast their Rush also down and their Road also turned into serpent Hallelujah are you catching it look at the difference now those of genus and Gem race per arms were bigger than that of Moses and that's what the devil can do always trying to supersede that of God by impersonation you know but we believe that is not the size of the dog Hallelujah is not the size of the dog is that not it but the size of the fight in the dog that is the matter so when they also curse their Road and they tend to serpent everybody was laughing but then that of Moses raised his head and swallow that of genus and swallow that of generous and Moses took the rod back until today Dr Rod is still in the road of Moses Hallelujah they are Rod is still in the road of Moses because the angel of the Lord was standed by Moses my brother says that I want to assure you that the angel of the Lord is always around you wherever you are that is why you must take fear out from you don't consider anything as fear because fear will dampen your progress Hallelujah remember that same angel that was standing by Moses at the palace what the same angel that guided him when he was put on the Nile River in that act as a child the prophet said the crocodiles they are the most biggest of all and none of these crocodiles tried okay to swallow up Moses they couldn't have done that easy they could have done that by the protections of the Angel of the Lord no way they couldn't and Moses you know swarmed all over the Nile to Pharaoh's daughter picked him up it was the protection of the angel Hallelujah oh brother God told his people I am sending my angel before thee to guide thee and to protect thee when they came out from Egypt Hallelujah because he want to have a sweet communion with them but there was some instruction given by God to the people hallelujah let's read Exodus chapter 23. Exodus chapter 23. and now let's start from verse 20. he said behold I sent an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared beware of him and obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgression for my name is in him Hallelujah you catch it he said behold I send an angel this is God speaking to his people to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which I God have prepared is already prepared place and God need his people to go and take it but they cannot go by themselves they need a guardian angel a protected Angel to send their in Hallelujah he said Beware of him and obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon me of transgression for my name is in him hear his voice you must hear the voice of your angel Hallelujah when your angels speak to you you must take it and abide by it are you catching it you cannot just say that oh I have an angel of the Lord and you walk in your own way no that will not bring any blessing to you you must listen to the voice of the angel Hallelujah he said provoke him not how do you provoke the angel you walk on your on your own thinking you you want to live in your own understanding oh yes you've got everything that you want so you no longer care about the way of the Angel no that shouldn't be he said provoke him not hallelujah it's just by Grace beloved that we are all saved but now after our Salvation do we do what we want no we do according to the instructions of God's word that is what makes us children of God Hallelujah because if we're a child of God you have a new parent and your new parent is the word is that not it is it train up a child the way he should go so when you grow up he will not depart from it so you must be obedient to your parent and we must be obedient to God's word Peter say being born again Hallelujah Being Born Again by what by the word of God you must be born again by the word of God and that is where you must stay put to the instructions of the angel of God and when we are talking about the angel of God is the word Hallelujah is a word he said provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgression for my name is in him but if thou shall indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak then I will be an enemy unto thy enemies and an adversary unto thy adversaries for my angel shall go before thee and bring thee in onto the amorites and the hittite and the parasites and the Canaanite the Evite and the jebusites and I will cut them off Hallelujah thou shall not bow down to their gods nor serve them nor do after their works but thou shall utterly overthrow them and quite break down their images Hallelujah this is where the physical Canaanites the jeopardized the Evite and all those but today what will we talk about ourselves there are still jebusites there are so he fights there are still Canaanites that we need to destroy in our lives anything beloved that seems to be a hindrance in our Christian Life is kind of this people we need to destroy we need to clear it from our way Hallelujah in fact God said my angel shall go before thee and today we have the same angel of God going before us hallelujah and that is our faith in the Lord he said thou shall not bow down to their gods not serve them nor do after their works but thou shall utterly overthrow them and quite break down their images and yes Shall Serve the Lord your God and he shall bless thy bread oh yes I want I want my bread to be blessed and certainly you want yours also to be blessed and how will God bless it he will only bless it when we obey the angel Hallelujah God bless you I'm not seeing you later yes I'm talking about you God bless you brother Hallelujah you understand if we want our leg to be blessed blessed then of course we need to listen to the angel of the Lord amen are you catching it he says and Yea Shall Serve the Lord your God and he shall bless thy bread and thy water and I will take sickness away from the midst of Thee that's a wonderful God taken away when we obey the voice of the Angel and we have seen God taking sickness away from among his people because we obey his voice Hallelujah the impossibility of man is always possible when will stay put to God's word nothing can stand our way because he is a God that performs he is a God that state by his word he is a God who don't run away from responsibility he's a God that can make his people happy if only though obey his voice and listen to his instructions without provoking that guiding and protecting Angel Hallelujah he said there shall nothing cast their young nor be barren in thy land the number of thy days I will fulfill I will send my fear before thee and I will destroy all the people to whom thou shall come and I will make all thy enemies turn their backs unto thee what a wonderful assurance and I was sent on it before thee which shall drive out the Evite and the Canaanites and the hittite from before thee all these are blessing and Blessed assurance that God gave to his people because the angel of the Lord was discharged to be with his people to guide them and take them to the promised land God prepared the place for them but it was inhabited by this you know canonized but God need his people to take the land because it belongs to them why will God allow it to go waste no he will certainly not do that and that is the reason why we always say that anything that God has prepared for you nobody else nothing can take it from you Hallelujah any way that God has to guide you to take that God will do it but your only thing to do is to obey the voice of God [Music] amen that is the only thing that God is looking unto that you do for him without that oh my brother God will be very much annoying as he said we should not provoke that guiding angel no he said that God has understanding how to go and what to do God has always sent a guide to his people God has never failed and he will not fail he sends a guide but you've got to accept that guide see you've got to believe it you've got to go the way he says are you catching it beloved you've got to go the way that God says you got to go the way the angel says you got to go the way the word of God says you don't go according to your own understanding Hallelujah if you get into a Wilderness and your God says we go this way and yet you think you go that way you are going to come up lost then when God sends us a guy to guide us we've got to follow that guide no matter what we think what looks reasonable and what looks ridiculous we are not subject to divide that the God is the only one Hallelujah the God is the only one now when we come to the New Testament we realize when Jesus Christ was revealing himself in the Book of Revelation he did not just get up and do something but he Place himself upon the word because he is a word he can never operate without the word Hallelujah I love that thing that you told them for us he said whether you believe it or not I am he whether you believe it or not I am he they were having their mind but Christ knew knew whom he was amen because he was the word the word that was to be fulfilled was him so he would never do anything without the word and now we're the Gentiles when he was revealing himself to us he called on John to the island of Patmos whether the people knew what they were doing or not it was to our favor well they tried to kill John in so many ways they couldn't kill him so finally they decided they decided to take him to the island of padmus and that is where they will leave him and he would die by himself but it was God that was calling John on the island Hallelujah the moment they love John then Jordan had his name mentioned John and he tend to look what who is here me and John turned to look and we all know what he saw Hallelujah let's read a portion of it let's read a portion of it Revelation chapter one amen let me start from verse five and from Jesus Christ who is a faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and admit as Kings and Priests unto God and his father to him the glory and Dominion forever and ever amen he said behold he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him and they also would Pierce him and all kindreds of the Earth shall well because of him even so amen verse 8 I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the ending say the Lord which is and which was and which is to come the almighty oh my God he said I John who also am your brother and companion in Tribulation and in the Kingdom of the and patience of Jesus Christ was in the island that is called Patmos for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and head behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last and what thou see it write in a book and send it onto the seven churches which are in Asia unto Ephesus unto seminar unto pegamos and onto chiatira onto studies onto Philadelphia and then until audition and I tend to see the voice that speak with me that's why I love and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks can we imagine and in the midst of the seven candles take one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and get about the paths with a golden gather his head and his hairs were right leg rule as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like unto fine brass as it they burn in a furnace and his voice at the son of many others oh include your voice and include my voice and he heard in his right hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth went a shop to edge sword and his countenance was out the sun shine it in his strength and when I saw him I fell at his feet I was dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am alive forever more amen and have the keys of hell and of death write the things we thou has seen and the things which are and the things which shall be hereafter The Mystery of the Seven Stars without soweth in my right hand and the Seven golden candlesticks the Seven Stars are the Angels of the seven churches and the seven continents seven churches now what I want us to look at is the Seven Stars are the Angels of the seven churches Hallelujah no you and I know and we believe that in a gentle age God gave us seven dispensation and every disposition had an angel and these Angels were angels in the hand of God and what the prophet said that they were not heavily Angels but they were Earthly angels Hallelujah they were the guiding Angels dispatched to the seven churches and at every Church age God has to live or release an angel to guide his people whether we like it or not we need the protections of the Angels Hallelujah any churches he released an angel and listen carefully in the Old Testament he said be careful don't provoke that angel don't do what provoke that angel because if you provoke that angel he will not pardon you amen so in this our time also when God released an angel like Paul to take charge of the efficient churches in fact Paul said a lot of things and for that matter that same morning went to the people in The False age he said that don't provoke him how do you provoke him you provoke him by these believing what he tells you and it came to a point Paul was one more charged he said what I have preached when an angel come from Heaven any other Angel is I am an angel of the efficient Church God give me authority to set the church in order I have led the foundation anyone that is coming to build upon it must be careful the kind of material he's going to use you don't use any different material You Don't Preach what I have preached contrary but what I'll preach make sure you're preaching the same thing Hallelujah he said even an angel come from heaven and say well Paul said this but I am changing it he said let that angel be a cursed even I Paul I myself if I go and come back and say hey I've got a new a new Revolution so therefore I'm going to change what I preach he said let me be a cast and today beloved can we imagine how many people are kissing themselves a lot of people are cursing themselves because whatever Paul established they have turned it upside down completely amen can you imagine Paul telling us about the way The Church Must Be conducted but today not on idea not on thinking I've turned the word upside down do you know that you are cursing yourself the angel of the Lord the Bible in Old Testament warn everyone be careful don't provoke him and this Angels also in God's hand if you provoke them you will not be pardoned Hallelujah and Paul was that angel of the efficient Church age after him God dispatched another angel as arenas to be an angel to that age which was the second Church age and it went on and went on and went on we we see when you use somebody like Martin we saw when he used somebody like colomba he used Martin Luther can we imagine Martin Luther's time that because of the Revelation that God gave to him somebody told me John Martin he said order what is against you right we are not going to listen to you you are destroying the church but Martin Luther knew where he was standing he said well if the whole world is against me I am also against the whole world it's better to listen to the angel and have your salvation secured then you using your own mind to formulate something that you think can be right for you it will not take you anywhere praise the name of our God Martin Luther went away and then came John Wesley another angel of the sixth Church age and John Wesley also did his best to make sure that you lead the people of God to the promised land and anyone that believed or listened to John John Wesley had their way into the promised land yes amen then came to our faithful time oh I say faithful because this is where God put us and beloved if you agree with me there has never been any age than this age Hallelujah they had never been God knew that this is the time you can hear his word and believe that is why he put you in this age Hallelujah so there had never been any age like this age and he gave us a faithful a faithful Angel by name of William Marion Braham who was an angel of this age brother whether you believe it or not I don't care where your education level is I don't care how intellectual you are I don't care how Professor you are I don't care how you know the English Hallelujah if you don't listen to that angel the Bible says that you'll not be pardoned can somebody say Amen if you don't listen to that angel Hallelujah you will not be pardoned because he is the one that God have given the charge to take care of this age God knew exactly what he was doing as he was yesterday he's the same today and you continue to be the same Hallelujah even on the throne we saw that God you know made it this way that the throne there were four living creatures around it and the prophet they were they were strong guys they were guarding the throne for our sake yeah when the devil came turning himself you know into so many things to deceive the people of God because of those guiding Angels because of those protecting Angels brother we were not lost we were not deceived Hallelujah when the devil went and put white garment upon himself and sat on a white horse with a ball without an arrow Hallelujah and the Bible said that he went to conquer and he was Conquering the whole world many people realize that or they thought that it was Jesus Christ but how can Jesus be on a white horse with a bow without an arrow but I don't use bow and arrow he always have a sword two edged sword that is what Christ have in his hand but for the sake of that angel Hallelujah who called John that John come and see come and see the trick of the liar and when John come to see he realized that he was not an uh he was not Jesus Christ but was a lying angel Hallelujah that same demon went back and came back again with another color this time he came in red and you know the red signifies Redemption Hallelujah he was trying to deceive the world again but the angel the second and you call John again John come and see the liar that same liar he has changed the color he went back and came with black and that was the Dark Ages when they are taking all the truth away and nobody was getting access to the truth but then the angel of the Lord was still there to guide his people Hallelujah that is why we are not afraid of physical Darkness what we are afraid is spiritual darkness when you are spiritual Darkness brother you are lost Hallelujah but thank God the devil was still pursuing and now he went back and missed all those colors and became colorless he came with a pale color now trying to deceive the people of God but the devil didn't know that that was the time that God was also using the angel that have a face like a flying eagle you cannot deceive the eager because the eye is very sharp Hallelujah as far as the eagle will be the clearer he sees everywhere amen so why is the devil was changing his colors to deceive the elect they're flying against was also on a flying all over the place Hallelujah and he saw that no no no no no no Satan you cannot deceive the people of God hallelujah you are the same old demon all liar you cannot deceive the people of God because we have a protecting angel amen oh brother sister let me let me let me just touch on this amen you remember that in the Old Testament when God divided the Army into four groups you remember that he gave them and sign okay divided them into four groups uh uh there was there was Judah at the East remember there was Ruben at the South Ephraim was at the west and Dan was at the North and all this group they had soldiers behind them and all of them have a sign Hallelujah the eagle the lion the face of a man and a flying eagle in the Old Testament and it was a symbol to what happened in this new testament we also have a symbol and today brother when you see the eagle all over the place it's a sign that God of dispatched an angel to guide his people amen amen now listen to what the prophet said here he said and then there was another Danger now he was talking about Mary and Joseph this little company just a young man and his little newly married wife going along the road many robbers were in the land in those days like Barabbas and so forth and what a parable that would have been to them to see just a little man walking along with a little woman to be mother sitting on a little donkey and would have let us take in his hand for a group of wild mean men to write down and through her and throw her off of there and do evil but you know if God is leading the way what difference does it make God will protect you to your destination there is no dangers when you are walking with the Lord oh brother this what I love he said there is no dangers when you are walking with the Lord I will believe easily that there was a host of Ten Thousand Angels walking along there with that man and that little donkey she was just as safe as she could be that is why Debbie said in Psalms 27 he said the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid if we have God protecting us if God have dispatched angels to protect us who is the enemy to Hamas oh beloved brother let's think about that amen amen all the cares of this world Hallelujah there for a Time but there's nothing that can touch your soul so long as you are a child of God nothing nothing I say nothing when even the devil was asking about job before the Throne of God and God said well you can go and test him but don't touch his soul God gave devil a strict warning he said don't touch his soul because that belongs to me I am holding his soul and you and I our souls are in the hands of God no evil spirit can touch us because we are being protected by God hallelujah amen and amen let me give you a little testimony before I close back home in my church uh only 28. of February um I was coming from Mission from Malawi and when I came by God's grace I went to church the following Sunday and one of our sisters came around he said pastor I have something to tell you I said what he said on the 28 I was going to town and I boarded a taxi and when I entered into the taxi when I stopped the taxi I realized that there were three men seated at the back so of course I have to go to the front seat so then she entered into the car and sat at the front then all of a sudden before the driver would make a move one of the men at the back seat said we've got one meat you understand that they got one meat yeah what kind of meat is it a goat meat or cow meat or human meat not knowing they were kidnappers yeah that's why the man made that statement so when this sounded to the sister then immediately he asked the driver to stop because she want to get down and you know their driver was not going to stop and the sister said driver I said I'll get them and the driver said well you just boarded the car why do you want to get down he said yes I've I've forgotten something at home so I won't go get it let me go out and the driver was not stopping he continued to speed up beloved there's not nothing to do he couldn't open the door and you know fall out but when they went for some few distance then they came to meet three men standing by the roadside and they stopped the car okay now when they stopped the car then one of the men told a driver he needed to ask the driver he said I have heard the voice of this woman from afar that she want to get down why are you not stopping the car for the woman to get down surprisingly the driver couldn't say anything so at that point the sister got the chance to open the door and get out from the car and when she bumped the door like this she was telling to say thank you to the man and there was nobody behind her I said sister don't share this with me alone go to the church and give a testimony for God have sent his angel to save you from the hands of the kidnappers Hallelujah and I told the church beloved I remember the same thing in the house of Abraham that day when God was going to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah there were three men that passed by the house of Abraham and one of the men spoke Hallelujah he promised Abraham said at next year by this according to the time of life I will visit you that was personal pronoun I not we three I will visit you Hallelujah and your word Sarah will have a son Hallelujah that was the protective angel in the house of Abraham and in the life of sister Dorcas it was the same thing there were three men but one of them spoke he didn't say we have heard he said I have heard the voice of this woman I want to get down why are you not stopping the car oh brother God is always close with us do never think that God is far away he is always around us let us make sure we will always listen to his word don't let us provoke anything that he says don't let us challenge don't let us doubt anything let us listen and abide by it for his angels are always around us Hallelujah let me finish with my code so that we can call it a a day okay amen amen now okay he says do you believe are you in that Refuge you have a right to every privilege that God has if you are in there you believe that are you happy to be in this Refuge can you just sit back and let off the pressure say turns be to God I finally made it I am here by the grace of God I am in the safety zone nothing can harm me now I am protected by the blood of Jesus Christ a company of angels are around me amen oh what a Blessed Assurance he said the angels of God are encomp about those who fear his name they don't live they stay there and night they are encomp about those who fear Him and you have a refuge you can come into it and every privilege and what a time it is to be in this refuge and have fellowship with him I believe if we will ask him tonight if we could have a little fellowship with his presence I believe he will do it for us don't you I believe he will amen amen why it has to be Shepherds now we are going to find out why it come to Shepherds they knew the ship is helpless without the shepherd to guide them a sheep is perfectly helpless he cannot go by himself and that is why we ought to be like ships God only guide ships God don't guide goats God the goat is a stubborn creature the goats know how to jump the fence Hallelujah by the Sheep oh my the Sheep are always humble you know ship shipwear creatures to be Reliant they rely on their Shepherds yes in fact they don't act till the Shepherd have instructed them amen one time when the prophet said that he went to a place and that place there was uh there was this kind of open market that their Wares are not in the shops like how you have in America here you know Walmart you know uh you know and all those no no this it was an open market and you see the the the foodstuffs all over the pavement and people walk through it and he said he saw a Shepherd bringing a ship across the way and when he saw the ship come he said wow let's wait till this ship get to these food stops they will have to scatter it but he said to his amazement the ship got to those place that place where the food stars are pile up on the pavement and no ship touch anything because they followed the Shepherds this way they went away Allelujah and Professor that if he had a puppy that day if the people will understand his language he will have preached a sermon to them Hallelujah yes we are sheep of God amen amen we are we are in this world we see so many things to attract us but we don't put our minds on those things we focus on our Shepherd we follow Jesus Christ we want to go the way he instruct us nothing of this world will have to influence us to be unbelievers amen and amen are you catchingly beloved he said they've got to be guided but what what is guiding you don't get a goat he will walk you to the slaughter pen God God never give us a goat he gave us his son the holy spirit to guide us he is our guide not some mermaid his men but a god-giving husband who feed the sheep upon sheep food so as to bring them under the protections of God hallelujah and thank God beloved that today we are being protected by the power of God whether you believe it or not we are under the protections of God beloved any place that you found yourself whether being alone or we coming together in the church we have protections of God Hallelujah we are protections of God so therefore anywhere we are we have to be conscious of what we do anything that we do must be in line with the word my fear is that he said we should not provoke the angel because when we provoke the angel he will not pardon us Hallelujah amen now he closed him amen in closing it says and them little fellows who could restrict one of those by the way you should never do that you know Jesus said take heed that you despise not one of these little ones for their Angels always be

said that that angel will guide you and when you are saved then the Holy Ghost take over all beloved brothers and sisters there is nowhere good than the house of God David said I was glad when they
