[7:05] Stand up for Jesus.
[7:10] Cheryl knows this. Stand up. Stand up
[7:14] for Jesus.
[7:16] Ye soldiers of the cross.
[7:21] Lift high his royal banner.
[7:26] It must not suffer loss.
[7:31] From victory unto victory
[7:36] his army shall he lead
[7:40] till every foe is vanquished
[7:45] and Christ is Lord indeed.
[7:50] Stand up. Stand up for Jesus
[7:54] the trumpet call oy

[8:04] in this this glorious day
[8:08] ye that our men may serve him against
[8:14] unnumbered
[8:16] foes.
[8:18] Let courage rise with danger
[8:22] and strength to strengthe.
[8:27] Stand up. Stand up for Jesus.
[8:32] Stand in his strength alone.
[8:36] The arm of flesh will fail you. He dare
[8:42] not trust your own.
[8:45] Put on the gospel armor
[8:50] and watching unto prayer.
[8:55] When duty calls or danger,
[8:59] be never wanting there.
[9:04] Stand up. Stand up for Jesus.
[9:08] Ye soldiers of the cross.
[9:13] Lift high his royal banner.
[9:18] It must not suffer loss.

[9:44] You have to have that made up in your
[9:46] mind. Amen. Trust and obey. Amen. Amen.
[9:52] When we walk with the Lord in the light
[9:58] of his word. What a glory that sheds on
[10:04] our way.
[10:08] While we do his good will, he abides
[10:13] with us still and walk through and oy.
[10:21] [Applause]
[10:23] Trust and oy
[10:26] for there's no other way to be happy in
[10:32] Jesus
[10:35] but to trust and oy.
[10:41] Not a shadow can rise. Not a cloud in
[10:46] the skies. Yet his smile quickly drives
[10:51] it away.
[10:55] Not a doubt or a fear, not a sign nor a
[11:01] tear can abide while we trust and oy.
[11:10] Trust and oy
[11:12] for there's no other way to be happy in
[11:18] Jesus
[11:21] but to trust and oy.
[11:25] [Applause]
[11:26] Not a burden we bear, not a sorrow we
[11:32] share, but our toll his death richly
[11:37] repaid.
[11:40] Not a grief nor a loss, not a frown or a
[11:46] cross, but is blessed if we trust and
[11:51] oy.
[11:52] [Applause]
[11:55] Trust and oy
[11:58] for there's no other way to be happy in
[12:04] Jesus
[12:06] but to trust and oy.
[12:12] But we never can prove the delights of
[12:17] his love until all on the altar we lay.
[12:26] For the favor he shows and the joy he
[12:31] bestows
[12:32] are for them who will trust and oy.
[12:40] Trust and oy
[12:43] for there's no other way to be happy in
[12:49] Jesus
[12:51] but to trust and oy
[12:54] [Music]
[12:57] in fellowship
[12:59] we we will sit at his feet or we'll walk
[13:05] by his side in the way.
[13:10] What he says we will do. Where he sends
[13:15] we will go. Never fear. Only trust and
[13:21] oy.
[13:24] Trust and oy.
[13:27] For there's no other way to be happy in
[13:33] Jesus
[13:36] but to trust and oy.
[13:42] Trust and oy

[13:59] Amen. Amen. That's the place you need to
[14:03] tie all your burdens, everything at his
[14:07] feet. Amen.
[14:10] He's never broken a promise yet. Without
[14:12] him, I can do nothing. Amen.
[14:17] Without him,
[14:19] I can do nothing.
[14:25] Without him, I surely fail.
[14:33] Without him, I would be drifting.
[14:40] Like a ship without
[14:43] a sink.
[14:48] Jesus.
[14:51] Oh Jesus.
[14:54] Do you know him today? Please don't turn
[14:59] him away. Oh Jesus.
[15:05] Oh Jesus.
[15:09] Without him how lost I would be.
[15:16] Without him I would be dying.
[15:23] Without him I'd be enslaved.
[15:30] Without him, life would be hopeless.
[15:37] But with Jesus, thank God I'm saved.
[15:45] Jesus.
[15:48] Oh Jesus.
[15:52] Do you know him today? Please don't turn
[15:56] him away. Oh Jesus.
[16:02] Oh Jesus.
[16:06] Without him how lost I would be.
[16:13] So I'll ask him to be my God,
[16:21] his word, my compass and guide.
[16:28] till I've anchored
[16:30] safely in glory.
[16:34] For without him I'll drift with the
[16:38] tide.
[16:42] Jesus.
[16:45] Oh Jesus.
[16:48] Do you know him today? Please don't turn
[16:53] him away. Oh Jesus.

[27:43] Amen. Amen.

[27:52] Dear Lord Jesus, we're grateful, Lord,
[27:55] that you have given us a part, heavenly
[27:58] father, that we can do in your kingdom.
[28:01] Lord, you've given so much to us,
[28:03] Father, and you ask so little in return.
[28:06] And we just pray that you'll bless,
[28:08] Lord, the hands that have given, Lord.
[28:12] Lord, encourage those that don't feel
[28:15] they have enough, Lord, that they can
[28:17] give. May you increase their faith and
[28:19] may you multiply it. May you multiply it
[28:22] to meet the needs, Father, and the
[28:23] missionaries, the building expenses,
[28:26] Lord Jesus, the preachers. Lord, I pray
[28:28] that you'll just move by your spirit,
[28:31] Father, that you'll just keep your word,
[28:33] Lord, because we know it will not fall

[29:00] Jesus,
[29:02] keep me from all wrong.
[29:08] I'll be satisfied as long
[29:14] as I walk. Let me walk close to thee.

[30:08] None but thee, dear Lord. None but thee.
[30:16] Just a closer walk with thee.

[31:33] Amen. Amen. What a friend. Amen. What a
[31:38] friend I have in Jesus. Amen.
[31:42] What a friend we have in Jesus.
[31:50] All our sins and griefs to bear.
[31:56] What a privilege to carry.
[32:02] Everything
[32:04] to God in prayer.
[32:06] [Applause]
[32:09] Oh, what peace we often forfeit.
[32:15] Oh, what needless pain we bear.
[32:21] All because we do not care
[32:26] [Music]
[32:29] to God in prayer.
[32:34] Have we trials and temptations?
[32:40] Is there trouble anywhere?
[32:46] We should never be discouraged.
[32:52] Take it to the Lord in prayer.
[32:58] Can we find a friend so faithful?
[33:04] Oh, with all our sorrow share.
[33:10] Jesus knows our every weakness.
[33:16] Take it to the Lord in prayer.

[35:02] outlet.
[35:04] If we take it to the Lord in prayer, we
[35:07] can leave it there. Amen. We carry it.
[35:11] Then we got a weight that we aren't
[35:13] supposed to be carrying.
[35:16] And I'm thankful that we have an outlet
[35:21] to cast our cares upon the Lord. He
[35:23] cares for us.

[35:39] Amen. Well, God bless you. It's good to
[35:42] see everyone in the house of the Lord
[35:43] today. And if you'd like to turn in our
[35:45] scriptures for opening scripture, it's
[35:48] going to be in second Timothy chapter 1.
[35:51] And we're going to actually be reading
[35:53] two verses there.
[35:58] I think I told them we're going to just
[36:00] be reading verse seven, but I just felt
[36:03] at at the end that we're going to read
[36:05] verse eight along with it. So
[36:11] let's let's just approach the Lord in
[36:14] prayer before we read uh tonight.
[36:18] Dear heavenly father, we thank you for
[36:22] salvation today.
[36:24] We thank you for the keeping power of
[36:26] the Holy Spirit. We thank you for
[36:29] helping us through every test and every
[36:31] trial. We thank you that you are
[36:34] almighty God and that you've not only
[36:37] made yourself known to us, but you've
[36:39] made a way for us to come and have a
[36:41] relationship with you. We could receive
[36:44] the benefits that there is in knowing
[36:47] you and being connected to you.
[36:50] We thank you for the mercies that have
[36:52] reroll our life. For the grace, for the
[36:55] love,
[36:57] for the joy, the peace. God, where would
[37:00] we be without you? we would be lost. We
[37:03] sung that song, without him, I could do
[37:05] nothing. Lord, you've made a way for us
[37:09] to benefit because of your love to us
[37:12] today.
[37:14] Lord, we ask if there is anything that
[37:16] would be in any kind of grievance to
[37:19] you, we just ask that you would please
[37:20] forgive us of it today,
[37:23] that you'd be merciful, and that you'd
[37:24] cover us with the blood that washes us
[37:26] and makes us white as snow.
[37:29] We pray Lord today from a sincere heart
[37:34] of the pastor, pastor of the flack here
[37:37] that you would encourage your people
[37:39] today.
[37:41] May the word that comes forth today be a
[37:44] help, be a strength, be an
[37:46] encouragement,
[37:48] and also Lord, may it be a light and a
[37:50] direction.
[37:51] May it accomplish the very purpose and
[37:54] which Lord you have it for us today. We
[37:56] commit the service in your hands. We
[37:58] commit your your sheep into your hands
[38:01] and we give you praise and honor for
[38:03] building us up in the most holy faith.
[38:06] In Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen.
[38:10] Second Timothy chapter 1 starting with
[38:12] verse number seven.
[38:14] For God have hath not given us the
[38:17] spirit of fear but of power and of love
[38:22] and of a sound mind.
[38:25] And then Paul went on to continue saying
[38:27] here,
[38:29] "Be thou,
[38:32] be not uh thou therefore ashamed of the
[38:35] testimony of the Lord, nor of me his
[38:39] prisoner, but be thou a partaker of the
[38:42] afflictions of the gospel according to
[38:46] the power of God." And God bless you.
[38:48] May be seated. So we see here that
[38:51] Timothy was really struggling with fear.
[38:54] How many struggled with fear before?
[38:56] Fear is a real thing.
[38:59] Fear is a real thing. And uh Timoth
[39:03] Paul's trying to tell Timothy that that
[39:06] spirit doesn't come from God. Amen. It
[39:09] just point blank does not come from God.
[39:11] Not sometimes, but never comes from God.
[39:14] It always comes from the devil. So a
[39:17] spirit of fear, if we can recognize it,
[39:19] we should deal with it at its
[39:22] foundation, at its initial knocking at
[39:24] the door because if you let the spirit
[39:27] of fear in, then it can uh it can begin
[39:31] to work in your mind and and and then it
[39:35] can actually affect your body. I mean,
[39:37] the spirit of fear can le literally
[39:40] cause stress. It can cause ulcers. It
[39:42] can cause cancer. Um and so fear is a
[39:45] real thing. and it can do a lot of
[39:47] damage to the human body.
[39:49] And uh Paul's telling Timothy that that
[39:52] doesn't come from God. But what comes
[39:54] from God is the spirit of power and of
[39:57] love and of a sound mind. Amen. And with
[40:01] the spirit of almighty God, you can now
[40:04] be a partaker of the afflictions that
[40:07] come with serving God. Because many of
[40:10] their afflictions of the righteous, but
[40:12] the Lord deliverth out of them all.
[40:16] So, we want to talk about two spirits
[40:17] today.
[40:20] Um, and we want to dive into the spirit
[40:22] of a sound mind, but I don't know how
[40:26] much we're going to get of it. But there
[40:28] are two spirits, God, and the devil.
[40:32] There's angels and there's demons.
[40:35] There's good, there's evil, there's
[40:38] love, there's fear, there's power,
[40:41] there's manipulation, there's a sound
[40:43] mind, and there's a unsound mind and
[40:45] unstable, a double-minded, uh, mentally
[40:48] impaired and insane. Brother Brandham
[40:50] said in the last days, the world would
[40:52] go insane. So, we see just a normal
[40:56] living in this world is called unsane.
[40:59] Insane.
[41:02] Brandon talked about the different it
[41:05] talked about the devil in the in the
[41:06] series there demonology. He said there's
[41:08] all different kinds of of spirits, evil
[41:12] spirits.
[41:14] They come in different shapes,
[41:17] different animals.
[41:19] Some look like bats and turtles,
[41:22] spiders,
[41:24] wolves.
[41:28] And uh brother Brandon said when they
[41:29] would get cast out of the people, he
[41:31] would see them.
[41:34] And uh and they would go and they would
[41:38] look to to for another home when they
[41:40] got cast out. They would be looking for
[41:42] another dwelling place because they
[41:44] need, you know, the brother says the
[41:46] devil can't do one thing to you unless
[41:49] he's got someone to work through. Right?
[41:52] So in other words, he can talk to your
[41:53] mind all day long. And if you don't say
[41:57] really,
[42:00] he can't do a thing to you.
[42:03] And the key is is is recognize
[42:06] the enemy. Brother Brandon said that
[42:09] demons are not just thoughts.
[42:13] They are literal beings.
[42:16] But how they enter in is through a
[42:19] thought. Now there's obsession and
[42:22] there's uh uh uh possession. And if I
[42:25] could say it like this, the devil gives
[42:28] you a thought and if you accept that
[42:30] thought, he's allowed to come in. It's
[42:33] true. The devil can never come into you
[42:36] unless you invite him in.
[42:38] And so let's just say um I'm I'm I'm I'm
[42:43] jealous of James
[42:46] because James has the kind of sneakers I
[42:49] want.
[42:52] And uh the devil tells me that that's
[42:56] not fair. I should be able to have
[42:58] sneakers like him. And every time I see
[43:00] him in those sneakers, I get jealous. I
[43:03] get this spirit of that's not fair. I I
[43:06] should be able to have them. And when I
[43:10] when I yield to that spirit of jealousy,
[43:14] then now the spirit of jealousy can come
[43:16] in. Are you you understand what I'm
[43:18] saying? It starts with the thought. The
[43:20] thought can't do anything until you
[43:22] start entertaining the thought.
[43:25] And you're saying, "Yeah, I want that."
[43:28] Instead of saying, "No, I resist that."
[43:31] And that's how all demons can come
[43:34] inside and and and and mess up our lives
[43:37] is through thoughts.
[43:39] So there's two distinct spirits here
[43:44] and they are 180 degrees from one
[43:46] another.
[43:47] They are complete opposites. One
[43:49] produces love, joy, peace, and mercy.
[43:52] The other produces hatred, strife, envy,
[43:54] wrath, and confusion.
[43:56] Yet the evil spirit has the capability
[44:00] of being just like a good spirit.
[44:05] Jesus said, Matthew 24, "For there shall
[44:08] rise false Christ, false prophets, and
[44:10] shall show great signs and wonders in so
[44:12] much if it were possible, they should
[44:14] deceive the very elect." So I want us to
[44:16] think about this. We've got two spirits
[44:18] and one of them has the capability of
[44:20] acting like the other.
[44:24] Though the spirits are completely
[44:26] opposite, one has the ability to act
[44:29] like the other. And I say the word act.
[44:33] God does not have the ability to act
[44:35] evil.
[44:37] I want to make that real clear. God, the
[44:40] Holy Ghost does not have the ability to
[44:42] act evil.
[44:44] First John 15 says, "This then is the
[44:47] message we have heard of him and declare
[44:50] unto you that God is light and in him is
[44:55] no darkness at all." Amen.
[45:00] Making it real clear that God cannot act
[45:03] like darkness. Amen. The Holy Spirit
[45:06] can't do that. All right. James 1:17.
[45:11] God is the father of lights with whom is
[45:15] no variableness neither shadow of
[45:20] turning. Amen. We talked about this a
[45:23] variable switch in the back. You God
[45:26] does not have a variableness. He is the
[45:30] father of lights. He's no chance of
[45:32] turning. You can always depend on God.
[45:35] What he's done in the past, he'll do it
[45:36] again. He's the same yesterday, today,
[45:38] and forever. Brother says, "If you do
[45:40] the same thing somebody else did, God is
[45:42] required to give the same result as he
[45:44] did the other person."
[45:47] John 8:12 says, "Then spake Jesus again
[45:51] unto them, saying, I am the light of the
[45:54] world, and he that followeth me shall
[45:58] not walk in darkness, but shall have the
[46:02] light of life." Well, we see the nature
[46:04] of God here. the very the very mind of
[46:07] God says he is the light of the world
[46:09] and if you're going to follow him, you
[46:12] are go you're not going to walk in
[46:13] darkness because the Holy Spirit is
[46:15] going to lead and guide you constantly
[46:17] into all truth. The nature of God is
[46:20] that wherever you're at, okay, more
[46:21] light, more truth, and then what you get
[46:24] there, he's got more for you. In our
[46:26] men's meeting, we talked about uh uh a s
[46:31] the the the
[46:33] uh heating up of silver and getting all
[46:35] the impurities out and um all the
[46:39] different impurities that are in silver
[46:41] that are in gold, they melt at different
[46:44] temperatures, right? And at the lower
[46:47] temperature, some melt quicker and
[46:49] you're able to get them out of there,
[46:51] off the top and out of there. So it's
[46:53] like there are certain things in our
[46:55] life that God deals with first. It
[46:57] doesn't take much of a trial to deal
[46:59] with them and then as you start as you
[47:01] you continue being heated up to your
[47:03] trials, more impurities come up and
[47:06] before you know it, you're becoming more
[47:07] like Jesus all the time. So God, he is
[47:10] light and everything that he's be is
[47:12] going to be doing in our life is going
[47:14] to be bringing us more into walking in
[47:17] the light. God is never like, "Okay,
[47:18] you're saved. That's all that matters to
[47:20] me."
[47:21] He is interested in us walking close to
[47:23] him. Amen.
[47:26] So we're just defining right there that
[47:29] God does not have the capability of
[47:32] acting evil.
[47:35] God does not have the ability to act
[47:37] evil, but the devil has the ability to
[47:40] act good.
[47:44] 2 Corinthians 11:13.
[47:46] 2 Corinthians 11:13. For such are false
[47:50] apostles,
[47:52] deceitful workers, transforming
[47:55] themselves into the apostles of Christ,
[47:58] and they're not just acting like it. And
[48:02] no marvel for Satan himself is
[48:04] transformed into an angel of light.
[48:08] Therefore, it is no great thing if his
[48:10] ministers also be transformed as
[48:13] ministers of righteousness, whose end
[48:15] shall be according to their works. So
[48:17] you see that the devil has the ability
[48:19] to fake it. Amen. But God does not have
[48:23] the ability to fake it, act evil. He
[48:25] just doesn't.
[48:27] Genesis chapter 2:9.
[48:29] And out of the ground made the Lord God
[48:32] to grow every tree that is pleasant to
[48:34] sight and good for food, the tree of
[48:36] life also in the midst of the garden,
[48:38] and the tree of knowledge of good and
[48:41] evil. will see that tree that we're
[48:43] talking about, it has the knowledge of
[48:46] good but chooses to do the evil.
[48:52] And and as long as people feel they know
[48:56] the the the truth, they have the
[48:58] knowledge of truth, they feel safe even
[49:00] if they don't do it.
[49:04] And it's dangerous.
[49:08] The tree of good and evil has the
[49:10] knowledge of both. But God is only good
[49:14] all the time. Right? The tree of life is
[49:17] only good all the time. But the other
[49:20] tree has the capability of being like
[49:22] this one day, being like this the next
[49:24] day. Act like this here, act like this
[49:27] there. That's right.
[49:34] I've often described the tree of
[49:36] knowledge of good and evil as someone
[49:38] who has the knowledge of good like
[49:39] Lucifer did, but simply chooses not to
[49:42] do it.
[49:44] So that's where we're going to be
[49:46] judged, right? We're going to be judged
[49:47] for whom little is given, little is
[49:51] required. But if you've been given all
[49:53] the truth in this age, I think the
[49:55] judgment's going to be much harder.
[49:58] Right? Didn't it say it been better if
[50:00] you've not known the way of the Lord
[50:02] than to have known the way of the Lord
[50:04] and and and turn it down?
[50:08] Ezekiel 28:15 says, "Thou was perfect in
[50:11] all thy ways from the day that thou was
[50:13] created till iniquity was found in thee.
[50:19] I made you perfect. You were as perfect
[50:21] as perfect could be.
[50:24] From the day I created you, you were
[50:26] perfect. And you remained perfect until
[50:29] you decided not to do what you know you
[50:32] should be doing. Amen. It's that simple.
[50:36] It's why it's important
[50:38] to do the things that you've been taught
[50:40] by the Holy Ghost. Amen. By God. But
[50:43] when you read the Bible in prayer and
[50:46] God speaking to your heart, you need to
[50:48] be serious about that. Because I'm going
[50:50] to tell you what, if you're serious
[50:51] about obeying the word of God, you're
[50:53] further ahead than the devil was.
[50:56] Because the devil decided not to be
[50:58] serious with God's word. Oh, I'm going
[51:00] to make my throne. I'm not I don't need
[51:02] to follow God. I don't need to go to
[51:04] church. I don't need I just I I'm going
[51:05] to be my own God.
[51:10] He lost the fear of the Lord. He had it
[51:13] at one time.
[51:15] Brother Brandham said in the message the
[51:16] angel of the Lord in 51, this is in 51.
[51:20] He says, "Iniquity is something that you
[51:22] know that you ought to do and will not
[51:25] do it."
[51:29] In the message power of transformation,
[51:31] this is in, you know, basically almost
[51:33] 15 years later, brother says, "What is
[51:36] iniquity?" David said, "If I conceive
[51:38] iniquity in my heart, God will not hear
[51:39] me." Iniquity is something that you know
[51:42] that you ought to do and you won't do
[51:44] it. You know better but won't do it.
[51:47] It's iniquity. I like that brother
[51:50] Brandham didn't change his message.
[51:53] It's it's solid. You can depend on it.
[51:56] We can have confidence in it. Amen. For
[51:59] God has not given us the spirit of fear,
[52:01] but of power and of love and of a sound
[52:04] mind. Two completely different spirits,
[52:06] night and day, good and evil. Yet evil
[52:09] has the capability of acting just like a
[52:12] good the good spirit would just like God
[52:15] would. And why I'm getting so much into
[52:17] this is because look, the devil comes to
[52:20] our head all the time.
[52:22] And he appears like this is the right
[52:25] thing to do. This is it. This is good.
[52:28] Amen. And we've got to recognize it
[52:31] because sometimes it comes in a form of
[52:33] manipulation.
[52:35] It comes in a in a form of fear. It it
[52:38] it and it it it we're being forced into
[52:41] something.
[52:46] And I'm going to tell you, these two
[52:47] spirits, yet they're completely
[52:50] different.
[52:51] They're so completely 100% 180 degrees
[52:55] different from one another.
[52:58] They have the one has the capability of
[53:00] looking so much like good that only the
[53:04] elect of God are going to know the
[53:06] difference. That's right.
[53:09] And only the elect of God are going to
[53:11] be filled with all of God.
[53:14] They've been chosen, elected,
[53:16] predestinated.
[53:17] I want you to think about this.
[53:21] The devil was able to deceive a third of
[53:24] heaven.
[53:25] a third of heaven who weren't born in
[53:28] sin and shapen in iniquity, who didn't
[53:31] come in the world speaking lies, who
[53:34] didn't have uh uh uh
[53:38] they didn't have anything negative to
[53:40] fight against. And the devil had the
[53:42] ability to do that. How much more to the
[53:44] human race can the devil do it? I
[53:46] believe we need to be keen. We need to
[53:48] be on our tolls. We need to be paying
[53:50] attention to the thoughts that come into
[53:52] our head because that's how the enemy is
[53:54] getting in.
[53:56] You've heard of brother Brandham talking
[53:57] about an evil spirit being a religious
[54:00] spirit.
[54:02] And it's one of the hardest spirits to
[54:04] deal with.
[54:06] Said in the message three witnesses, he
[54:07] says the antichrist is a religious
[54:10] spirit.
[54:12] in the Israel and the church first book
[54:16] the antichrist spirit is so close like
[54:18] the real thing till it'll deceive the
[54:22] very elect if possible
[54:25] in the message Queen of Sheba brother
[54:27] said Jesus said those Pharisees who were
[54:29] so religious they had to come through a
[54:31] certain lineage and a certain birth and
[54:33] be trained holy just honest and upright
[54:36] he said you are of your father the devil
[54:40] that's right and the devil is religious
[54:42] and can put on the very much po uh p po
[54:47] p po p po p po p po p po p po p po p po
[54:47] p po pious p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p
[54:48] p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p
[54:48] p p p p p i o u s pious and holiness
[54:51] actions. Notice that they have the
[54:53] ability to act a certain way, but
[54:56] they're really not that way. Amen.
[54:59] But God looks at the heart. Jesus said
[55:02] if your heart thinks one thing and your
[55:05] mouth speaks something speaks another,
[55:08] he said you're hypocrites.
[55:11] So we got to understand here that the
[55:13] devil is real and it's no longer just
[55:16] acting like we're Christians or just
[55:19] acting like we're right. We really have
[55:21] to have a life that shows where we're
[55:23] standing.
[55:25] The message demonology brother Brandon
[55:27] says but yet would deny the Holy Ghost
[55:31] would deny every operation of the power
[55:34] of God. They're unbelievers. No matter.
[55:38] They're very religious and the
[55:39] antichrist spirit is very religious
[55:41] spirit just to mark just as religious as
[55:44] can be. And yet it's the antichrist.
[55:46] Yes.
[55:48] Paul was telling Timothy
[55:50] uh in the same book a little bit further
[55:52] than chapter 1 and chapter 3:5 having a
[55:55] form of godliness but denying the power
[55:59] thereof from such turn away. So the
[56:02] people who act like they're they have a
[56:06] form of godliness, but they have no
[56:09] power to stay consistent and live the
[56:11] life, we're told by the word of God to
[56:14] turn away from that.
[56:18] Because if you entertain spirits long
[56:20] enough, they're going to affect you. You
[56:22] may not think, you may not think that uh
[56:27] it won't get on you and you'll be
[56:29] stronger, but I'm telling you, it will
[56:31] affect you and begin to compromise.
[56:37] Because a religious spirit doesn't have
[56:40] the goods. Amen. A religious spirit acts
[56:44] like it has the goods. It can put it on.
[56:47] It can it can act like it at times.
[56:51] Therefore, it's enough there to trick
[56:53] certain people, most people, but it
[56:56] can't trick the elect. It can't. So, the
[57:01] spirit of fear, the spirit of fear has a
[57:04] form of godliness. Let me just say this,
[57:06] but does not possess the power to live a
[57:09] godly life.
[57:11] The spirit of fear has a form of
[57:14] godliness. And these are the spirits
[57:16] that come to us.
[57:18] It's it it's okay if you do this, but
[57:21] you know, you don't have to be sold out
[57:23] to God.
[57:26] It's a denominational belief. Right
[57:30] now, evil is getting stronger.
[57:34] Uh we're we're told that hell, the lid
[57:37] is off hell. Hell is enlarged itself.
[57:41] Demons have been loosed out of the
[57:43] rivers. The the devil is seeking whom he
[57:45] may devour.
[57:48] simply by standing up against the devil.
[57:50] You know what's going to happen when you
[57:52] stand up against the devil? You are
[57:54] going to get persecuted.
[57:56] That's right. By just taking a stand
[57:59] against the devil, you're going to get
[58:01] in trouble.
[58:04] First or second Timothy 3 tells us this.
[58:08] Yay. All that live godly in Christ Jesus
[58:11] shall suffer persecution.
[58:14] Verse 13.
[58:16] Next verse. But evil men and seducers
[58:21] shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and
[58:23] being deceived. In other words, just as
[58:25] they're going to persecute you more.
[58:28] It's just going to get worse and worse.
[58:30] Evil is growing at rapid speeds. And if
[58:34] we don't grow in the love of God, it
[58:36] will overcome us.
[58:40] Here's the thing. You're not going to
[58:42] defeat the devil with his evil. and with
[58:46] with just trying to, you know, tell him
[58:48] how bad he is or the people that are
[58:50] doing it. You need the love of God to
[58:52] overcome that thing. Amen.
[58:57] No other way. No other way to overcome
[58:59] that.
[59:01] Romans 12:17,
[59:05] recompense to no man evil for evil.
[59:10] That's right.
[59:12] It is, you know, vengeance belongs to
[59:14] God. not us.
[59:17] Provide things honestly in the sight of
[59:19] all men. If it be possible, as much as
[59:23] that lies within you, live peaceibly
[59:25] with all men. Now, this scripture here
[59:28] is telling me that if I have enough of
[59:31] God inside of me, I can live peaceably
[59:34] with all men.
[59:36] Amen. And that if I don't got much of
[59:38] God in me, then I can't live peaceably
[59:41] with all men. Amen. And that's why it
[59:43] says as much as that lies in you, get
[59:45] more of it in you.
[59:48] It's it's I'll say like
[59:51] God did not birth us with the Holy
[59:53] Ghost.
[59:56] We were born with an evil spirit.
[1:00:00] If we want God's spirit, we have to
[1:00:02] hunger. We have to thirst. We have to
[1:00:03] call. We have to seek. We have to say,
[1:00:06] we have to die out to oursel. And we
[1:00:09] have to show God how bad we want him.
[1:00:12] that through that free moral agency and
[1:00:14] then he comes into us.
[1:00:16] Verse 19, dearly beloved, avenge not
[1:00:19] yourselves. Avenge not yourself. Don't
[1:00:21] stand there and try to avenge
[1:00:24] yourselves, but rather give place unto
[1:00:26] wrath. For it is written, vengeance is
[1:00:28] mine. I will pray, sayeth the Lord.
[1:00:29] Therefore, if thine enemy hung hunger,
[1:00:33] just feed him.
[1:00:35] Amen. If he's thirsty, give him drink.
[1:00:40] For in doing so, thou shalt heap coals
[1:00:42] of fire on his head. Why? Because you're
[1:00:46] being good not only to your buddies, but
[1:00:48] to those who are persecuting you.
[1:00:52] Okay. Did I say something that you
[1:00:54] didn't catch on that one? I expect an
[1:00:56] amen out of that one. That's what we got
[1:00:58] to get to. We got to get to the place we
[1:01:00] can love the unlovable.
[1:01:02] Have to. We have to get there. Only
[1:01:05] perfect love enters the other side. I
[1:01:07] love this verse. Be not overcome of
[1:01:11] evil, but overcome evil with good. So,
[1:01:15] we've got this spirit that's strong, and
[1:01:18] it's it it's it's it's getting more and
[1:01:20] more clever, more and more deceitful,
[1:01:22] more and more ways to to to to get at
[1:01:26] us. And we we cannot be overcome that
[1:01:30] spirit as this evil is getting worse and
[1:01:32] worse and waxing stronger and stronger
[1:01:34] in this age.
[1:01:36] We literally have to overcome that with
[1:01:38] good.
[1:01:41] The only thing good I know is God. It's
[1:01:43] the only thing I know is good. It's God.
[1:01:47] And God is love.
[1:01:49] We must overcome evil with good.
[1:01:53] Not our knowledge of how wrong somebody
[1:01:56] else is. Amen. Not that by proving we're
[1:02:00] right. Proving they're wrong by debating
[1:02:02] or arguing with a demon spirit.
[1:02:14] We overcome demons with good.
[1:02:18] Only good. The name of Jesus is good.
[1:02:22] Amen. The blood of Calvary is good.
[1:02:24] Amen. We can testify greater is he
[1:02:26] that's in me than he that's in the in
[1:02:28] the world. Or or he that's he he that
[1:02:31] hates me. He that's against me. Greater
[1:02:34] is the love of God in me than the hatred
[1:02:37] that's against me. Yes. Yes. I feel like
[1:02:40] preaching now. I believe in this. See,
[1:02:43] see, we we need to take the word of God
[1:02:46] and apply it to our lives. We can't say,
[1:02:49] "Well, I believe in this, but I can't
[1:02:51] live it." You can't do that.
[1:02:55] Amen.
[1:02:57] We love not our lives to death,
[1:03:02] but we love our enemies. Think about
[1:03:03] that. We love not our lives to death.
[1:03:06] That's what the scripture says. But we
[1:03:08] love our enemies.
[1:03:10] We bless them that curse us. We do good
[1:03:13] to them that hate us at times. We pray
[1:03:16] for them to spitefully use us and
[1:03:18] persecute us. We learn to let our our
[1:03:21] our son shine not just on the good, but
[1:03:27] on the evil. Right? And we let the
[1:03:30] blessings of our our rain, the rain that
[1:03:33] comes, we want God to we want God to to
[1:03:36] bless them. It's not just our friends.
[1:03:39] You know, I think about this every day.
[1:03:41] Brother Bill Sanchez, I've said this
[1:03:43] before. Text in the morning says, "God
[1:03:45] bless you. Have a good day." You know,
[1:03:47] we're friends,
[1:03:50] but you know, those blessings belong.
[1:03:52] They from from God, they they got to
[1:03:54] they got to be for everybody.
[1:03:57] Amen.
[1:03:58] Yes. God is calling us to overcome evil
[1:04:02] with good.
[1:04:05] Not I'll be your friend as long as you
[1:04:07] don't betray me.
[1:04:10] Anybody can do that. I got remember
[1:04:13] that. You
[1:04:16] look here's the thing.
[1:04:20] I remember I can't help. I remember bad
[1:04:24] things that are done to me.
[1:04:27] And I'm not going to stick my neck out
[1:04:29] there and let him do it 15 times,
[1:04:35] but I'm not gonna wish anything ill
[1:04:37] against them.
[1:04:41] So the thing is, I'm still going to
[1:04:43] treat them as if they never did me harm.
[1:04:48] I mean, somehow we've got to display the
[1:04:50] spirit of almighty God in our lives.
[1:04:53] Turn with me if you would to First John
[1:04:54] chapter 4:1 16.
[1:04:59] 1 John 4:16. Are you getting something
[1:05:01] out of this?
[1:05:04] Amen. The Bible said that God is love
[1:05:08] and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in
[1:05:11] God and God him. That's a good place to
[1:05:13] be right there. Dwelling in God. Herein
[1:05:17] is our love made perfect. So our love
[1:05:21] that we have can be at a place where
[1:05:24] it's not perfect yet. We still got the
[1:05:26] love of God, but it's not perfect yet.
[1:05:30] But herein is our love made perfect that
[1:05:32] we may have boldness. Look at this. All
[1:05:35] the way in the day of judgment.
[1:05:38] Because as he is, so are we in this
[1:05:41] world.
[1:05:43] You ever watch movies? And in the
[1:05:46] movies,
[1:05:47] uh, you know, there's two people and
[1:05:48] they're fighting. They're getting ready
[1:05:50] to die
[1:05:52] and the one says to the other,
[1:05:57] "I'll see you in hell." And he's going
[1:06:00] to kill him.
[1:06:04] And I'm not worried about it.
[1:06:07] You know, they're acting like they're
[1:06:08] not scared.
[1:06:10] Whistling in the graveyard.
[1:06:14] But any if you don't have a sound mind,
[1:06:16] you're not scared of you're not, you
[1:06:18] know, they walk around with no fear. The
[1:06:20] hat's, you know, behind.
[1:06:26] But with a sound mind,
[1:06:29] you can have no fear
[1:06:32] if you're filled with the love of God.
[1:06:37] That's scripture.
[1:06:39] In fact, it's so strong that you can
[1:06:41] have boldness in the day of judgment.
[1:06:44] Because as he is, so are we living the
[1:06:48] same life in this world. That's right.
[1:06:52] Because as God is, because God is love.
[1:06:54] We just read that. He's light. There's
[1:06:57] no darkness in him. He loves everybody.
[1:07:00] Because as he is, so are we in what?
[1:07:04] This world. Not the world to come.
[1:07:08] Our goal ought to be to come like Jesus.
[1:07:11] Amen.
[1:07:12] you know, not waiting, not you know,
[1:07:14] sitting to the church doesn't make you
[1:07:15] like Jesus.
[1:07:17] Listening to tapes don't make you like
[1:07:19] reading the Bible, even praying. If you
[1:07:21] don't get serious, say, "God, I want to
[1:07:23] be like you. I want to die out. I want
[1:07:26] to love like you love."
[1:07:29] It's the only way we're going to get
[1:07:30] there because he's not going to just
[1:07:32] gift it to
[1:07:36] if our heart really isn't in him. Verse
[1:07:40] 18, there is no fear in love. Absolutely
[1:07:43] no fear in love.
[1:07:46] If you're dealing with fear,
[1:07:52] I
[1:07:54] I would say you could try something like
[1:07:56] this. Say 20 times, Jesus, I love you
[1:07:59] with all my heart.
[1:08:04] I would find you would get more of a
[1:08:06] victory than trying to battle that
[1:08:08] spirit that's coming against you.
[1:08:11] You know how it is when you say, "I love
[1:08:13] you enough." You begin to feel it
[1:08:18] and then all of a sudden you like the
[1:08:19] the faith muscles grow and and and
[1:08:22] you're not willing to be so tempted
[1:08:26] uh to become
[1:08:28] the spirit of fear. There's no fear in
[1:08:30] love, but perfect love, what does it do?
[1:08:32] that cast out fear. Just cast it out
[1:08:36] because fear have torment. He that
[1:08:39] fearth is not made perfect in love. And
[1:08:41] we love him because he first loved us.
[1:08:45] We're able
[1:08:47] we are able to abide in his love now
[1:08:50] because his love has come inside of us.
[1:08:53] We're able to love back because God has
[1:08:56] shed his love in our heart by the Holy
[1:09:00] Ghost. We have it now and now we can
[1:09:02] give it out. And you need that love when
[1:09:06] the spirit of fear comes to you. Amen.
[1:09:10] God has not given us the spirit of fear,
[1:09:13] but power, love, and of sound mind. And
[1:09:16] perfect love will cast it out.
[1:09:21] In other words, you have nothing to fear
[1:09:22] about.
[1:09:25] You know, I don't mean it wrong, but
[1:09:34] when you know where you're standing with
[1:09:36] God, the devil can act any old way wants
[1:09:39] you around you and it don't move you,
[1:09:41] right? So, it just is what it is. You're
[1:09:44] not scared. You're not afraid. Amen.
[1:09:48] Because you know God is there. Amen. You
[1:09:52] don't go and you live your life for God
[1:09:54] and then be afraid of the devil.
[1:09:56] I'm sorry. You don't give your life to
[1:09:58] God and then peace you're come by the
[1:10:00] devil. You you every day you have a you
[1:10:03] you take a stand. I'm going to live for
[1:10:04] you, Jesus. Amen. I I'm going to serve
[1:10:07] you today. I'm going to give my very
[1:10:09] best to you. You prove to God you love
[1:10:12] him. You keep his commandments and you
[1:10:14] you walk in the light as he shows you.
[1:10:17] Now, if a man say, "I love God."
[1:10:20] Verse 20.
[1:10:22] And he actually hates somebody, another
[1:10:25] person,
[1:10:28] he is a liar.
[1:10:31] For he that loveth not his brother whom
[1:10:33] he has seen, how can he love God who has
[1:10:36] not seen? And this is the commandment
[1:10:39] that we have from God, that he who
[1:10:42] loveth God loveth his brother also.
[1:10:45] Amen. I think that's a good commandment,
[1:10:48] don't you? Amen. The love of God is so
[1:10:50] powerful that it left the comfort and
[1:10:54] the splendor of glory. For God so loved
[1:10:56] the world that he came down on the
[1:10:58] cross, he died. That was how strong the
[1:11:01] love of God is. It actually died itself
[1:11:04] for us to redeem us. Amen. Now, if that
[1:11:08] same love is inside of us, there is
[1:11:10] nothing to fear. Amen. It'll overcome
[1:11:14] everything that comes before you because
[1:11:18] who can stand against God?
[1:11:22] That's why there's nothing to fear.
[1:11:25] If we're if we're without the Holy
[1:11:27] Ghost, we we should be shivering.
[1:11:30] But if we got him on the inside, there's
[1:11:32] nothing to worry about. Amen. The love
[1:11:35] of God penetrated
[1:11:38] the the borders of hell. And Jesus took
[1:11:41] the the keys of hell and death.
[1:11:45] That's what the love of God will do. It
[1:11:47] will overcome evil with good. Right? And
[1:11:51] the love of God in us will overcome evil
[1:11:53] with good.
[1:11:56] We have nothing to fear. Amen.
[1:12:00] There's no fear in the love of God.
[1:12:03] Though he slay me, yet will I trust him.
[1:12:06] Though I walk through the valley of the
[1:12:07] shadow of death, I will fear no evil.
[1:12:10] Perfect love casteth out all fear. David
[1:12:14] did not fear Goliath.
[1:12:17] Daniel did not fear the lion's den. The
[1:12:20] three Hebrew children did not fear the
[1:12:22] fiery furnace.
[1:12:24] And perfect love or perfect trust in God
[1:12:27] will cast out fear that's in our life.
[1:12:29] We need to be honest with ourselves and
[1:12:33] deal with it. What good would this
[1:12:34] sermon do? What good would this
[1:12:36] knowledge do if we don't apply it to our
[1:12:38] lives? Amen. Well, brother John, I'm not
[1:12:41] really going through anything right now.
[1:12:42] I don't think I need this right now.
[1:12:44] Well, I'm telling you, take it in and
[1:12:46] can it because you're going to need it.
[1:12:48] Amen. We're going to need it down the
[1:12:50] road. Amen. That we may have boldness in
[1:12:54] the day of judgment because as he is, we
[1:12:57] decided to live that same life in this
[1:12:59] world.
[1:13:02] We that overcome are actually going to
[1:13:04] be sitting with Jesus on the throne.
[1:13:08] That's where we can have boldness on on
[1:13:10] the on on the day of judgment because
[1:13:13] we're no longer being judged.
[1:13:16] We've already were judged. We judged
[1:13:18] ourselves and now we're sitting with
[1:13:21] Jesus
[1:13:23] with boldness, judging the angels. The
[1:13:25] Bible says
[1:13:28] Psalms 27 verse1.
[1:13:31] Just some encouraging scriptures here.
[1:13:33] The Lord is my light and my salvation.
[1:13:37] Whom shall I fear? Amen. The Lord is my
[1:13:40] He is the strength of my life. Think
[1:13:42] about sometimes you feel weak. Sometimes
[1:13:45] you feel strong. David is saying the
[1:13:48] Lord is the strength of my life. Of whom
[1:13:50] shall I be afraid? When the wicked, even
[1:13:53] my enemies and my foes came upon me to
[1:13:55] eat my flesh. They stumbled and fell.
[1:13:57] Though a hoe should encamp against me,
[1:14:01] my heart is strong. It shall not fear.
[1:14:04] Though war shall rise up against me, in
[1:14:07] this will I be confident. Verse five,
[1:14:10] for in the time of trouble
[1:14:13] he shall hide me. In his pavilion, in
[1:14:17] the secret of his tabernacle shall he
[1:14:19] hide me. He shall set me upon a rock.
[1:14:25] That's the God we serve.
[1:14:28] Perfect love. We can't make it without
[1:14:30] it. Amen.
[1:14:33] There is so much power in the love of
[1:14:35] God that fear cannot even penetrate its
[1:14:38] borders.
[1:14:42] Want to take a look at the borders? The
[1:14:45] borders of God's love. Ephesians chapter
[1:14:48] 3:14.
[1:14:52] Ephesians 3:14. For this cause I bow my
[1:14:56] knees unto the father of the Lord Jesus
[1:14:59] of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the
[1:15:02] whole family in heaven is and earth is
[1:15:06] named. And I want you, this is a
[1:15:08] particular family. When you think of the
[1:15:11] uh co uh Collinsworth family or you
[1:15:15] think of uh the Lefontaine family, there
[1:15:18] are certain families that you think of
[1:15:20] and they have uh they're known for
[1:15:23] something, right? Their singing, their
[1:15:26] their abilities or maybe like hockey
[1:15:29] players, some the dad and the son and
[1:15:31] the grandson, they all played hockey.
[1:15:32] They're like a a hockey family.
[1:15:35] Are you with me? There's something
[1:15:38] special about the family of God. They're
[1:15:40] known for something. Anybody know what
[1:15:41] that is? That's right. By this shall all
[1:15:45] men know you're my disciples. Amen.
[1:15:48] They're known. The family of God is
[1:15:50] known for their love.
[1:15:53] That their knowledge, their their
[1:15:55] abilities, their their gifts, they're
[1:15:58] known for their love. Amen. Amen.
[1:16:04] No wonder Jesus told us to love one
[1:16:06] another as I have loved you. Verse 16,
[1:16:11] that he would grant unto you according
[1:16:13] to the riches of his glory to be
[1:16:15] strengthened with might by his by his
[1:16:18] spirit in the inner man. So here it is
[1:16:22] the spirit now of God coming inside of
[1:16:24] us and being strengthened that Christ
[1:16:27] may dwell in your hearts by faith that
[1:16:30] being rooted and grounded in love may be
[1:16:33] able to comprehend with all the saints
[1:16:35] what is the breadth, the length, the
[1:16:37] depth, the height. It kind of sounds
[1:16:39] like a boundary to me. and to know the
[1:16:42] love of Christ which passes knowledge
[1:16:46] understanding that ye might be filled
[1:16:49] with all the fullness of God. Yeah. You
[1:16:52] want to be filled with the fullness of
[1:16:54] God. Get the love of God in your heart.
[1:16:57] Forget about getting puffed up and
[1:16:58] learning all about this and all. You can
[1:17:00] learn. You can. The devil knows more
[1:17:02] than all of us put together.
[1:17:04] But he don't have the love of God.
[1:17:07] You don't have it.
[1:17:10] And when you have the fullness of God,
[1:17:13] you have the love of God. When brother
[1:17:14] Brandon went beyond the curtain of time,
[1:17:16] he described that place as
[1:17:20] as perfect love
[1:17:23] that that there he said it a number of
[1:17:25] places. There literally is no words in
[1:17:27] the vocabulary in the dictionary in any
[1:17:30] language on earth to describe how
[1:17:33] perfect that love was.
[1:17:37] And he said, "Whatever you do, lay
[1:17:38] everything aside.
[1:17:42] Get after it. Go after it." Amen. And
[1:17:44] you know, we we put so much little
[1:17:46] emphasis on that. Like, I really don't
[1:17:48] need that, but I need all these other
[1:17:50] things.
[1:17:52] No, we don't need anything but the love
[1:17:54] of God. Amen. When you have that, God
[1:17:56] just seems to supply all your needs.
[1:17:58] Amen. Put God first. Fall in love with
[1:18:02] him. Grow in the love of God. testify
[1:18:05] how much you love him and how much he
[1:18:07] loves you and and that's growing and let
[1:18:09] the love of God be manifested in your
[1:18:11] life.
[1:18:13] Yes. Amen. I say amen to that. I'm not
[1:18:14] an amener to my own word, but it's a
[1:18:17] truth where you need to do it.
[1:18:20] Verse 20. Now unto him that is able to
[1:18:23] do exceedingly above all that we might
[1:18:27] all that we ask or think according to
[1:18:29] the power that workketh what? In us.
[1:18:33] In other words, we want God to do things
[1:18:35] for us, but if we don't get the love of
[1:18:37] God in us, don't expect it.
[1:18:40] Amen.
[1:18:43] How many know the boundaries of the love
[1:18:46] of God?
[1:18:48] How many knows the boundaries of the
[1:18:50] love of God? You're going to get in
[1:18:51] trouble on this one. Don't put your hand
[1:18:52] up.
[1:18:57] It's a good question. What are the
[1:18:59] boundaries of God's love?
[1:19:02] 1 Corinthians 13:7. I'm going to, this
[1:19:04] is what came to me when I thought about
[1:19:07] these boundaries today. 1 Corinthians
[1:19:09] 13:7, the love of God beareth all
[1:19:14] things,
[1:19:15] believeth all things, hopeeth all
[1:19:18] things, endureth all things. Charity
[1:19:22] never faileth.
[1:19:25] You talk about a God that can go down to
[1:19:27] the deepest hell. Pull somebody up.
[1:19:33] God is capable of doing the what would
[1:19:36] seem the impossible.
[1:19:40] Now the thing is it will not do. Just so
[1:19:42] you understand the love of God.
[1:19:47] The love of God right here. This is the
[1:19:50] picture when Jesus is looking at the
[1:19:53] rich young ruler.
[1:19:55] Now, the love of God did not make
[1:20:00] the rich young ruler humble himself and
[1:20:03] put God first,
[1:20:05] but he did supply
[1:20:07] the answer to eternal life. Take what
[1:20:12] you got,
[1:20:14] sell it, distribute it to the poor. Not
[1:20:16] sell it, give it to the poor, and come
[1:20:18] follow me. I there'll be treasures in
[1:20:20] heaven.
[1:20:21] He gave the choice to understand the
[1:20:25] love of God. It it endures and believes
[1:20:29] but it doesn't cross free more agency.
[1:20:32] And we need to understand that we don't
[1:20:35] close the door on anybody. But we simply
[1:20:38] understand that not everybody's going to
[1:20:40] walk through the door.
[1:20:44] choice people have to make.
[1:20:50] God knows what he's doing.
[1:20:55] Though none go with me, still I'll
[1:20:57] follow.
[1:21:01] What I want all of us to be able to do
[1:21:03] today, I want us to all to be o to
[1:21:06] overcome fear
[1:21:09] because in that that thought of fear
[1:21:12] opens the door for anything negative to
[1:21:14] happen.
[1:21:16] And that's that spirit God does not want
[1:21:19] us to have. It doesn't come from God.
[1:21:22] And it comes from the devil. The devil
[1:21:24] never comes. Sister Linda, uh, Brother
[1:21:28] Ben, Sister Lynn never comes to us,
[1:21:31] Brother Jonathan, and say, "Would you
[1:21:34] would you like to fear this situation?"
[1:21:38] No, he comes and he goes, "Boo. This
[1:21:41] situation exists."
[1:21:44] He doesn't give you a choice on the
[1:21:46] matter. So that's why we need to be
[1:21:49] sober. We need to be vigilant. We need
[1:21:52] to understand the devil is seeking whom
[1:21:54] he may devour. And we need to be quick
[1:21:56] to resist him, steadfast in the faith.
[1:21:59] Amen.
[1:22:01] I love God. I'm standing with him.
[1:22:05] God has not given me the spirit of fear.
[1:22:07] I don't have to accept your boo.
[1:22:11] God, greater is he that's in me. I love
[1:22:14] God. So as so are we in this life like
[1:22:19] God. Amen. Nothing to fear.
[1:22:23] Nothing to fear. Amen.
[1:22:25] two spirits, good and evil, love versus
[1:22:29] fear, power versus man uh manipulation,
[1:22:33] a sound mind versus Lord, help me to get
[1:22:36] to this as quick as possible. I notice
[1:22:37] the time is running out. A sound mind
[1:22:40] versus an unsound mind, unstable,
[1:22:42] double-minded, mentally impaired, or
[1:22:45] insane. Love has the power to overcome
[1:22:47] fear.
[1:22:50] Love has power to overcome manipulation.
[1:22:52] Amen.
[1:22:57] The opposite of a sound mind is an
[1:22:59] unsound mind.
[1:23:02] An unound mind is a dangerous mindfield.
[1:23:07] I remember when my dad I I just heard
[1:23:09] stories. I seen a little bit of this.
[1:23:11] God, I don't mean to say anything
[1:23:13] negative here, but
[1:23:16] he he was a drinker and my dad could
[1:23:19] drink and and get drunk and act like
[1:23:22] anybody else that's drunk. But when he
[1:23:24] drank vodka, for whatever the reason, he
[1:23:26] turned into another maniac.
[1:23:32] And he would always go back to a time
[1:23:35] that him and his dad got beat up at a
[1:23:37] bar and their head was against a tire
[1:23:40] and they were beating him with a tire
[1:23:42] iron. I'm talking many years later when
[1:23:46] he would get drunk on that, you'd hear
[1:23:48] that same story.
[1:23:53] So I'm going to tell you, an unound mind
[1:23:55] is a dangerous mindfield. You don't know
[1:23:57] what to expect. Right? It can tear
[1:24:00] things up fast. Amen. There's no
[1:24:02] foundation with an unsound mind.
[1:24:06] Anything goes. In fact, James 1:8 says,
[1:24:08] "A double-minded man is unstable in all
[1:24:11] his ways." There's no foundation. Can't
[1:24:12] count on them. Amen.
[1:24:16] Did you know it takes an unstable mind
[1:24:18] to manipulate others? Amen. You cannot
[1:24:22] manipulate somebody with a sound mind.
[1:24:26] You can't do it. It takes an unsound
[1:24:28] mind to actually manipulate somebody.
[1:24:34] Unstleness, unsoundness
[1:24:38] will take you places you wish you had
[1:24:40] never gone.
[1:24:42] That's why we need to gain control of
[1:24:44] our mind.
[1:24:46] The love of God has power to overcome
[1:24:48] unstleness,
[1:24:50] unsoundness,
[1:24:51] double-mindedness, confusion.
[1:24:54] And the spirit of an unsound mind is not
[1:24:58] of God.
[1:25:00] It's not of God. God has given us the
[1:25:03] spirit of a sound mind, not unsound.
[1:25:07] Amen.
[1:25:09] So, we have to control our thoughts.
[1:25:12] And if we're willing to watch our
[1:25:14] thoughts, we can control them. But if
[1:25:16] we're not willing to say, "What is that?
[1:25:19] Where does that line up with the word?"
[1:25:24] Then those thoughts will control us,
[1:25:27] and it'll take us places we don't want
[1:25:28] to go.
[1:25:30] First John 4:1 says, "Beloved, believe
[1:25:33] not every spirit, but try the spirit to
[1:25:36] see whether it is of God or not." Amen.
[1:25:39] The spirit of a sound mind. Philippians
[1:25:41] 2:1. We need to hurry cuz time is real
[1:25:44] fast and we still got halfway to go.
[1:25:47] Whoa. What did you say, brother John? No
[1:25:49] way.
[1:25:52] Philippians 2:1. If there be therefore
[1:25:56] any consolation, how many wants the
[1:25:57] spirit of a sound mind? We can find it
[1:25:59] here in these scriptures right here. If
[1:26:02] there be therefore any comfort, any
[1:26:05] consolation in Christ, any comfort of
[1:26:07] love, if any fellowship of the spirit,
[1:26:10] if any bows and mercies, fulfill ye my
[1:26:14] joy, that you be look like minded.
[1:26:19] Here's the mind of Christ. This is a
[1:26:22] sound mind right here. Having the same
[1:26:25] love, being of one accord and of one
[1:26:27] mind. Now, here's the thing. You may be
[1:26:30] in a business or in a home or in a in a
[1:26:33] group of people and none of them are
[1:26:35] green with you, but you can be in so
[1:26:39] much one accord with the Holy Ghost,
[1:26:42] with the love of God that you and him
[1:26:45] are a majority. Amen.
[1:26:49] You know, sometimes we don't we can't
[1:26:51] convince everybody. We can't convince
[1:26:53] the person that we're talking to. That's
[1:26:56] understandable. You don't have to. But
[1:26:58] what you do need to do is that your
[1:27:00] spirit and your mind needs to be in one
[1:27:02] accord with God. And it needs to be of
[1:27:05] the same love. The same the same love
[1:27:08] and the same mind. Not
[1:27:12] it it's okay if I don't have the mind of
[1:27:15] Christ right now. I'm upset or if it's
[1:27:18] okay if if I don't have the love of God
[1:27:20] right now. I'm still trying to work out
[1:27:21] this situation. friend, if you're ever
[1:27:24] going to work out a situation, you've
[1:27:26] got to start on the right foundation. We
[1:27:28] need to have the the mind of Christ. We
[1:27:30] need to we need to have his love, his
[1:27:32] mind, so we know what to do in the
[1:27:34] situation.
[1:27:37] You know, as soon as you start taking
[1:27:38] things into your own hands,
[1:27:41] trouble,
[1:27:45] we do things God's way, it's going to
[1:27:47] turn out really good. It's going to turn
[1:27:49] out the best. So let nothing that we do
[1:27:53] be done through strife, vain glory, but
[1:27:56] in loneliness of our minds. This is the
[1:27:59] mind of Christ, the loneliness, the
[1:28:01] humbleness.
[1:28:03] You know, we don't we don't threaten. We
[1:28:05] don't forebear threatening. We just in
[1:28:07] loneliness of mind. Let each of us
[1:28:09] esteem the other person better than
[1:28:12] ourselves.
[1:28:14] Can you say that? Can you say amen to
[1:28:16] the word? Amen. Look not every man on
[1:28:19] his own things, but take a minute and
[1:28:22] care about others. Right? Let this mind
[1:28:26] be in you which was also in Christ
[1:28:29] Jesus. Thank God that he looked down
[1:28:31] upon us. Amen. Who being in the form of
[1:28:34] God, thought robbery to be equal with
[1:28:36] God, but made himself of no repetition,
[1:28:38] took upon him the form of a servant, and
[1:28:40] was made in the likeness of a man.
[1:28:42] That's that is very humble.
[1:28:45] I wonder if we were all God if we would
[1:28:47] do that.
[1:28:50] I wonder if we would do that. God did
[1:28:52] that. And being found in the fashion as
[1:28:55] a man, he humbled himself and became
[1:28:57] obedient to death, even the death of the
[1:28:59] cross.
[1:29:00] The mind of Christ is sound.
[1:29:04] It's consistent.
[1:29:06] It's faithful. It's sure. It's
[1:29:08] steadfast. It's unmovable. It's always
[1:29:10] abounding in the work of the Lord. Amen.
[1:29:13] But the mind of the devil is unsound,
[1:29:17] unstable, unfaithful, unsure, not
[1:29:22] dependable, unpredictable. It's off the
[1:29:25] word. And God has not given us that
[1:29:29] spirit.
[1:29:31] And it doesn't matter if we can
[1:29:33] sometimes act like the word.
[1:29:36] We've got to act like the word only all
[1:29:39] the time. Right?
[1:29:42] Otherwise, it's just the enemy.
[1:29:45] All right. Ephesians 4:17.
[1:29:48] Hope you don't mind me hur hurrying.
[1:29:52] Ephesians 4:17. This I say therefore and
[1:29:55] testify in the Lord that ye henceforth
[1:29:59] Oh, let me just say this.
[1:30:04] How many has ever been How many has ever
[1:30:06] been drunk before?
[1:30:09] Okay. Okay. So, you think I'm going to
[1:30:10] hold this against you? Huh? Get those
[1:30:12] hands. How many's ever been done drugs
[1:30:14] before?
[1:30:16] Okay. How many's been on medication? How
[1:30:18] many's been on you had surgery and had
[1:30:21] to get anesthetic and they tell you
[1:30:23] you're not allowed to drive. You make
[1:30:24] sure somebody else drives. You're not
[1:30:26] allowed to use operate machinery
[1:30:31] because you become impaired in your mind
[1:30:34] and you can't make the right decision.
[1:30:37] And I am telling you, when you don't
[1:30:39] have a sound mind, you're not going to
[1:30:41] make the right decisions. I don't care
[1:30:43] how smart you think you are.
[1:30:46] It takes a sound mind. See, an unsound
[1:30:49] mind says, "I'm not going to bow down.
[1:30:51] I'm not going to do what you I don't
[1:30:52] need you." That's what an unsound mind
[1:30:55] says. Now, a sound mind says,
[1:31:02] "I will turn away the wrath with a soft
[1:31:06] answer.
[1:31:07] I will humble myself. I will esteem the
[1:31:10] other better than myself.
[1:31:12] I will I will take the fall for this
[1:31:15] situation. I will be the bigger person.
[1:31:18] You know, brother says, "It takes a
[1:31:19] bigger person to get underneath a lower
[1:31:21] person." Right? Amen.
[1:31:26] That's a sound mind. God had a sound
[1:31:28] mind. He humbled himself and became
[1:31:30] obedient.
[1:31:34] We think we're smarter than God and we
[1:31:36] know what's right and what's wrong. We
[1:31:38] want to tell everybody when they're
[1:31:39] wrong. That is not a sound mind.
[1:31:44] A sound mind is living the life.
[1:31:48] It is it's it's it's learning
[1:31:52] to live for others even when they're
[1:31:54] wrong. Even when they're wrong. Live for
[1:31:56] others. Look not every man on his own
[1:31:59] things, but the things of others. Let
[1:32:00] this mind be in you which was also in
[1:32:03] Christ Jesus.
[1:32:05] All right.
[1:32:08] Amen.
[1:32:11] So don't let your mind become impaired
[1:32:16] like drugs and alcohol and medications
[1:32:18] do. Get a sound mind to where you're
[1:32:21] clear thinking. You know the devil's
[1:32:24] coming at you through maybe a person
[1:32:26] through the way they're acting.
[1:32:29] What you do is you do not allow
[1:32:35] an unsoundness that you want to
[1:32:38] recompense evil for evil and and and you
[1:32:42] know start saying the same thing to them
[1:32:44] that they're saying to you. Don't even
[1:32:46] start defending yourself.
[1:32:49] But literally a sound mind overcome evil
[1:32:53] with good.
[1:32:55] Praise God. Ephesians 4:7. This I say
[1:32:58] therefore and testify in the Lord that
[1:33:00] ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles
[1:33:03] walk in the vanity of their mind. Yes.
[1:33:05] So we're different, right? We're chosen
[1:33:07] people. We're not like the rest of the
[1:33:09] church world.
[1:33:12] Having the understanding dark and being
[1:33:14] alienated from the life of God, right?
[1:33:17] They can, in other words, they can act
[1:33:18] like it, but they don't have the life of
[1:33:20] God. being alienated from the life of
[1:33:23] God, just a form of godliness through
[1:33:25] the ignorance that is in them because of
[1:33:27] the blindness of their heart. Who being
[1:33:29] past feeling, they don't have feeling
[1:33:31] anymore, but have given themselves over
[1:33:33] to lascivveness to work all uncleanness
[1:33:35] with greediness, selfishness, but you
[1:33:39] church have not so learned Christ?
[1:33:42] No.
[1:33:43] If so be that you have heard of him, you
[1:33:46] have been taught by him as the truth is
[1:33:49] in Jesus, and that you put off
[1:33:50] concerning the formal conversation of
[1:33:52] the old man which is corrupt according
[1:33:55] to the deceitful lust, and be renewed
[1:33:58] what? In the spirit of your mind.
[1:34:07] Be renewed. Let's make a decision. I'm
[1:34:10] not going to fight no more.
[1:34:13] Okay, I want to hear an amen. I guess
[1:34:15] I'm going to tell you what to do here.
[1:34:17] Say amen to this. We're not going to
[1:34:19] fight anymore.
[1:34:20] We're we're going to be renewed in the
[1:34:22] spirit of we're going to take the mind
[1:34:24] of Christ and we're going to apply this
[1:34:26] in our homes and apply it in our life.
[1:34:28] Apply it in our businesses.
[1:34:31] And that you put on the new man which
[1:34:34] after God is created in righteousness
[1:34:37] and true holiness. Wherefore putting
[1:34:39] away lying, speaking evil every man
[1:34:42] truth with his neighbor. For we are
[1:34:44] members one of another. Be ye angry and
[1:34:46] sin not. Let the son, let not the son go
[1:34:49] down upon your wrath, neither give place
[1:34:51] to the devil. Let him that stole steal
[1:34:54] no more, but rather let him labor
[1:34:56] working with his hands the thing which
[1:34:58] is good that he may have to give to him
[1:35:01] that needeth. Let no corrupt
[1:35:03] communication proceed out of your mouth,
[1:35:05] but that which is good to the use of the
[1:35:08] edifying, that it may minister grace
[1:35:10] unto the hearers. And grieve not God.
[1:35:12] Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God,
[1:35:14] whereby you're sealed unto the day of
[1:35:17] redemption. Amen. Let all bitterness and
[1:35:19] wrath and anger and clamor and evil
[1:35:21] speaking, let it be put from you with
[1:35:24] all malice, and be kind one to another,
[1:35:27] tenderhearted, forgiving one another,
[1:35:29] even as God for Christ's sake have
[1:35:32] forgiven you.
[1:35:39] Think on these things.
[1:35:42] Think on these things. Train yourself to
[1:35:46] think on the right things in your mind.
[1:35:48] Amen. Because if you
[1:35:51] if you think on the right things long
[1:35:53] enough, we are promised that God would
[1:35:56] keep us in perfect peace whose mind is
[1:35:58] stayed on the Lord. You're overcome evil
[1:36:01] with good. Let's stand together as I
[1:36:03] want to just quote you this one quote I
[1:36:06] found. I've read it before. Watch your
[1:36:08] thoughts. They become your words.
[1:36:11] Watch your words. They become your
[1:36:12] actions.
[1:36:14] Amen. Watch your actions. They become
[1:36:16] your habits. Watch your habits. They
[1:36:17] become your character. And watch your
[1:36:20] character. It becomes your destiny.
[1:36:23] That's right.
[1:36:25] God has gifted us
[1:36:28] the gift of a sound mind. And it comes
[1:36:30] from the Holy Ghost. The more of the
[1:36:32] Holy Ghost we receive, the more of a
[1:36:34] sound mind we have. And I'll I'll say it
[1:36:37] like this. Okay. So the Bible says God
[1:36:41] has not given us the spirit of fear but
[1:36:43] power, love and of a sound mind.
[1:36:46] Okay, that is something that we develop
[1:36:49] into.
[1:36:52] Every day we practice resisting fear,
[1:36:56] not listening to it, not succumbing to
[1:36:58] it. And every day we practice loving one
[1:37:01] another. We we practice having a sound
[1:37:05] mind. We we practice power,
[1:37:09] inner power, not using our our our our
[1:37:13] flesh against somebody, but inside
[1:37:15] bringing oursel under subjection and
[1:37:18] allowing God to work through us. So,
[1:37:20] it's a character. It's a we develop it
[1:37:23] through our trials and our tests. And we
[1:37:25] take advantage of the opportunity that
[1:37:26] we have every single day to build the
[1:37:29] gift that God has given us.
[1:37:32] As we let God have his way inside of our
[1:37:35] lives, we become more and more like him.
[1:37:39] Amen. That's saying, "Jesus, I'm
[1:37:40] depending on you,
[1:37:45] [Music]
[1:37:51] Jesus.
[1:37:54] I'm depending on you.
[1:37:58] Jesus,
[1:38:00] I'm depending on you.
[1:38:04] Jesus,
[1:38:05] I'm depending on you.
[1:38:09] Depending on you to see me through,
[1:38:16] Jesus,
[1:38:18] I'm depending on you,
[1:38:21] Jesus.
[1:38:23] I'm depending on you,
[1:38:27] Jesus.
[1:38:28] I'm depending on you,
[1:38:32] depending on you to see me through.
[1:38:38] Jesus,
