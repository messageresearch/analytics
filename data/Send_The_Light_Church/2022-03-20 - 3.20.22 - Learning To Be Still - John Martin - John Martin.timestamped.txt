[36:26] things in jesus precious name amen
[36:30] amen turn with me if you would to the
[36:32] book of
[36:34] psalms 46.
[36:36] psalms 46 we
[36:38] appreciate
[36:39] very much
[36:41] um our
[36:43] our musicians
[36:46] our uh
[36:48] those that clean the church
[36:50] those that do sunday school
[36:54] that lead the worship
[36:56] those that laboring in prayer
[36:59] because without that we wouldn't have
[37:01] what we have today and so we
[37:04] appreciate each one and
[37:06] appreciate god in you
[37:08] amen god in the church
[37:12] um
[37:13] we want to
[37:15] uh take our text from verse
[37:17] 10 and 11 of psalms
[37:20] 46 but if it's okay i want to start with
[37:22] verse number one
[37:24] and and just read the whole chapter
[37:26] because
[37:27] it's just so good
[37:28] the bible says god is our refuge and our
[37:31] strength
[37:32] he's a very present help in trouble
[37:35] therefore
[37:36] will not we fear
[37:38] though the earth be moved and though the
[37:40] mountains be carried into the midst of
[37:42] the sea though the waters
[37:44] thereof roar and be troubled
[37:47] though the mountains shake with swelling
[37:50] thereof
[37:51] there is a river
[37:53] the streams whereof shall make glad the
[37:56] city of god the holy place of the
[37:57] tabernacle the most high
[38:00] god is in the midst of her
[38:02] amen god is here she shall not be moved
[38:05] god shall help her and that right early
[38:10] the heathen rage
[38:12] the kingdoms were moved
[38:14] he uttered his voice the earth melted
[38:17] the lord of hosts is with us the god of
[38:20] jacob is our refuge
[38:23] sheila come
[38:24] behold the works of the lord
[38:27] what desolations he have made in the
[38:29] earth he maketh wars to cease unto the
[38:33] ends of the earth he breaketh the bull
[38:35] and cutteth the spear and sunder he
[38:37] burneth the chariots with fire
[38:41] and i'm taking our text from these
[38:43] verses here be still
[38:45] and know that i am god
[38:47] i will be exalted among the heathen i
[38:50] will be exalted in the earth
[38:53] the lord of hosts is with us the god of
[38:56] jacob is our refuge sheila you may be
[38:59] seated
[39:00] amen
[39:02] we want to entitle this message learning
[39:05] to be still
[39:07] learning to be still and for a subject
[39:10] knowing god in our present situations
[39:14] brother branham said man has always had
[39:16] that habit of looking in the past and
[39:18] seeing god oh yeah god was there god was
[39:20] there god was there or looking into the
[39:22] future that god would do this god will
[39:24] do that but when we're going through our
[39:26] tests and our trials and our situations
[39:28] in life where we really really want god
[39:31] on the scene it's hard for us to
[39:33] recognize where god is at
[39:40] that's why we need to learn to be still
[39:42] recognize them
[39:43] sometimes we just often i should say not
[39:45] sometimes often we get
[39:47] anxious
[39:51] we get
[39:53] bothered
[39:54] we get
[39:56] going in a direction that's other than
[40:01] this is what god wants us to do
[40:04] so it's all about
[40:05] having god more in our personal lives
[40:07] that's what this this message is about
[40:10] but these words be still
[40:13] were two words
[40:15] that were often used
[40:17] with seven children in our home
[40:21] from the time they
[40:22] were start we started dressing them to
[40:24] the time they were walking out the door
[40:28] we were saying those words
[40:30] be still so i can dress you be still
[40:33] before you walk out the door and tell me
[40:34] where you're going
[40:38] their words were often used to bring
[40:40] about an order
[40:43] to the situation when there was perhaps
[40:45] confusion or some kind of commotion we
[40:49] would use those words
[40:50] and today we can use those words in this
[40:53] same fashion
[40:56] sometimes the children would lose focus
[40:59] and hearing those words stand still
[41:03] be still
[41:04] would give them a focus
[41:08] wherever their minds were at
[41:11] i remember when i was really wanting to
[41:14] understand get some help for raising
[41:18] our children because you know with seven
[41:20] children i wanted all the help i could
[41:21] get
[41:24] i remember when
[41:26] um
[41:27] we were listening to brother joseph
[41:29] branham
[41:30] quite a few years ago
[41:32] we had heard that you know through the
[41:34] message that he
[41:36] he
[41:37] he had his own mind at times
[41:41] and so i i asked him he says what did
[41:44] brother branham do
[41:46] when things got out of hand when things
[41:48] got chaotic
[41:50] and he said well brother brandon would
[41:52] get us
[41:53] and he would just
[41:54] settle us down
[41:56] and then he would he would just settle
[41:58] us down
[42:00] and he would just settle us down
[42:04] i thought wow
[42:07] you don't really need any volumes of
[42:08] book there to figure out how to raise
[42:11] kids you just need to quiet the spirit
[42:16] because the devil can't do a thing
[42:18] unless he's got a vessel to work through
[42:22] sometimes we just need to be still
[42:26] i believe that there are times in our
[42:28] lives that we get so
[42:30] filled with problems and distractions
[42:33] that god wants us to be still he wants
[42:35] us to focus on him and to know that he
[42:39] is the god of our present situation
[42:42] to recognize that he's among us
[42:45] and that he wants to actually be exalted
[42:47] right in the middle of our problems
[42:50] too often we think it's strange when
[42:52] we're going through tests and trials and
[42:53] why has this happened to me and this
[42:55] doesn't seem to be normal
[42:58] but really that's the time
[43:00] that
[43:01] we have an opportunity to be still and
[43:03] let god come in on the scene
[43:06] but it can't be a situation where we
[43:08] just ignore it
[43:10] god can't be exalted when you're
[43:12] ignoring it
[43:14] he wants to hear you testify he's a
[43:17] present help in a time of trouble god is
[43:19] among us
[43:21] he will move
[43:22] because i believe
[43:24] now of course if we don't believe it
[43:27] you don't can't expect it because god
[43:29] doesn't work by the operation of doubts
[43:31] and fears and questions we have to be
[43:34] courageous to say i believe and really
[43:36] believe it from the deaths of your heart
[43:40] i think we get out of position
[43:42] with god too often and we wonder
[43:45] where god is really at
[43:47] right and these
[43:49] there should be times that
[43:51] where should always be abounding in the
[43:53] work of the lord
[43:55] and we're standing still doing nothing
[44:00] and there's times that we should be
[44:01] standing still and knowing that god is
[44:03] in control of our situation and we're
[44:05] anxious trying to get control of this
[44:07] thing
[44:08] we just get on a position
[44:12] i say first and foremost
[44:14] about taking our position back in christ
[44:17] and remain in it the scriptures teach us
[44:19] to submit ourselves unto god
[44:23] first and foremost submit yourself unto
[44:26] god
[44:28] and be clothed with humility amen
[44:31] doesn't matter what you say what you do
[44:33] people are always looking at the clothes
[44:37] they're looking at the spirit the
[44:38] attitude you know is it god is it all
[44:42] about me or is it all about him
[44:46] let jesus christ have preeminence in our
[44:49] lives
[44:52] which is the church
[44:55] right
[44:56] god wants to have preeminence in the
[44:58] church who's the church we are the
[45:00] church
[45:01] whether we're in our personal homes
[45:03] around our jobs or in the car or in this
[45:05] building god wants preeminence amen
[45:09] brandon said in the message law of grace
[45:11] he says no
[45:12] we ought to come to church with the
[45:14] highest reverence
[45:17] did you ever come to church
[45:19] and
[45:23] felt like
[45:25] you really didn't get nothing out of it
[45:30] like
[45:30] i didn't get i didn't feel like i didn't
[45:32] get anything out of that
[45:33] and we we could leave kind of critical
[45:37] kind of being judgmental about the
[45:39] situation
[45:42] and maybe god wanted us there to serve
[45:44] that time
[45:46] but it never comes across our mind of
[45:48] it's always the responsibility of the
[45:51] minister
[45:52] to get me to receive
[45:53] instead of me going and helping the
[45:55] church body
[45:57] it's not all about us all the time
[46:00] sometimes we just we don't come to
[46:02] church with enough reverence and brother
[46:04] brandon says we ought to come to your
[46:05] church with the highest reverence we
[46:07] ought to enter into the church with the
[46:09] with the real saints of god
[46:11] he said like real saints of god excuse
[46:13] me walk over and take our position and
[46:16] keep our minds
[46:18] on christ
[46:21] that's that's that's
[46:22] the highest reverence right there
[46:24] keeping your mind on christ we ought to
[46:27] forsake everything of the world like
[46:29] that
[46:30] and if you are really born again this
[46:32] may cut now just a little bit but you
[46:35] know this is the house of correction
[46:37] amen if you're really born of the spirit
[46:39] of god that's where your heart lays
[46:41] anyways
[46:45] the position of our heart ought to be
[46:48] finding out how we can better please the
[46:51] lord where our mind is at
[46:54] and the message faith with friend says
[46:55] god
[46:56] in prayer
[46:58] god may we tonight take our stand and
[47:00] our position in christ
[47:03] they're like men and women of god sons
[47:06] and daughters of the creator who just
[47:09] spoke the world and it came into
[47:10] existence
[47:12] god we
[47:13] call ourselves christians
[47:15] and can't even believe for our little
[47:17] healings
[47:20] he said what
[47:22] you what or what you promised to give us
[47:25] and he said god forgive us of our
[47:28] stupidity
[47:34] amen
[47:36] we're smart we should be smart enough to
[47:37] believe amen
[47:39] amen
[47:42] may we rise tonight like men and women
[47:44] son and daughters of god i believe god
[47:47] wants us to take our position
[47:49] amen and i'll say yes we've heard in our
[47:52] recent services that it is a position of
[47:55] authority where we use the name of jesus
[47:58] christ christ to claim the promises of
[48:00] god for our lives
[48:03] but it's also a position not just of
[48:06] authority but of trust and submission
[48:10] to where
[48:11] during times we god wants us to stand
[48:14] still and know that he's in charge of
[48:16] the situation that he's going to take
[48:18] care of it that we don't have to get all
[48:20] worked up
[48:24] if you don't really know if god is in
[48:27] control
[48:28] then be still
[48:30] and know that he is god
[48:33] the spirit of truth is always leading us
[48:36] the bible tells us that
[48:38] always but too often we're not in our
[48:40] position to recognize it and we end up
[48:43] doing our own thing taking control of
[48:45] situations how many has been guilty of
[48:47] just having to take control manipulate
[48:50] something say something do something put
[48:53] pressure over here try to do something
[48:56] to get the situation the way you want it
[49:00] god never works like that
[49:03] he's not a he doesn't force by fear
[49:07] he's a gentleman
[49:09] i'm not saying
[49:11] that he won't bring some
[49:14] uh prepare some fish for your journey
[49:16] when you leave them
[49:19] because he will
[49:24] and look
[49:25] i told the men at my work i said look i
[49:27] am guilty of being treated the absolute
[49:30] worst that you could treat me how do i
[49:32] know that
[49:33] because i know how terrible i am
[49:37] and i
[49:38] i am whatever you reap you sow
[49:41] i mean it's just it but i can't demand
[49:45] respect from a person
[49:48] i don't care how much i pay them
[49:50] not that they were being disrespectful i
[49:52] think it was just a comment i made when
[49:54] i was
[49:55] sharing with them about creating an
[49:57] atmosphere keeping the atmosphere
[50:01] a place
[50:03] do it for god and otherwise don't do it
[50:05] for me
[50:07] do it for god
[50:08] do it for god amen
[50:12] we don't want to do our own thing
[50:14] in the message brother bran in the
[50:15] message how can i overcome brother
[50:17] branham says this
[50:18] and and brother uh gideon i don't know
[50:21] if he's watching this morning if he has
[50:22] god bless you he
[50:24] often pipes in sunday mornings but he
[50:27] sent this
[50:28] uh quote over and i wanted to read it it
[50:30] seemed to fit with this morning's
[50:32] message sometimes satan can take you and
[50:35] when you think you're doing the will of
[50:37] god and can make you pro position and
[50:41] you fall for it
[50:43] yes sir you sure can't so i had a text
[50:45] him back says what's proposition mean
[50:47] and then he didn't answer for a while so
[50:49] i went to
[50:50] looked it up and it basically he throws
[50:53] satan throws something at you to get you
[50:55] off into another direction same thing
[50:58] you did with eve so i wanted to finish
[51:00] reading a little bit of this quote he
[51:01] didn't send it but brother ben says now
[51:03] let's just take for instance our sisters
[51:05] they're pretty
[51:07] and he and he can get you to a place
[51:10] that can get you to a place
[51:12] that or god can get you to a place
[51:16] that you let your hair grow out
[51:18] that would be god that we're doing that
[51:20] that you didn't realize
[51:22] this is where satan comes in you didn't
[51:25] realize that you look so nice on you
[51:28] and the first thing you know you get
[51:30] kind of a feeling like you're stuck up
[51:34] like a little above something else
[51:37] and some of you men you know what i mean
[51:39] see
[51:41] and he can take the same thing and
[51:44] proposition it with you
[51:47] that's right he says you've got to
[51:49] overcome that thing
[51:52] just remember you're living for god
[51:55] you have one objective and that's jesus
[51:57] christ outside of that there's nothing
[51:59] else that counts
[52:00] [Music]
[52:02] in the message conference brother
[52:04] branham said
[52:05] and that god has sent his spirit to to
[52:08] lead
[52:08] uh men and women
[52:10] he will never lead you away from the
[52:13] word of god amen
[52:16] never not for a moment
[52:20] he'll lead you right to the word of god
[52:22] because man shall not live by bread
[52:24] alone but by every word that proceeds
[52:26] out of the mouth of god so when you're
[52:28] thinking about are you doing the will of
[52:31] god you're being led by god and and
[52:33] somebody's saying hey wait a minute
[52:35] consider this if it's the word of god
[52:37] stay with the word don't go with how you
[52:40] feel i have failed at this so many times
[52:49] when we're all getting to heaven we're
[52:50] all in the rapture we're all there
[52:52] there's not going to be anybody who says
[52:53] yeah i made it here going my own way
[52:57] i made it to the rapture i got off the
[52:59] word now where did i stop going
[53:01] no it was right with the word every word
[53:04] of god everyone that makes that word
[53:07] makes that rapture is living by every
[53:08] word of god that proceeds of the mouth
[53:11] of god
[53:14] we've heard the saying that the world is
[53:16] ever evolving
[53:20] just like the bride is being
[53:22] continuously transformed into the image
[53:25] of jesus christ the world is evolving to
[53:28] the greatest deception and confusion
[53:30] that's ever been known to man
[53:33] they're coming into the image of the
[53:35] beast
[53:37] the church world is falling deeper and
[53:39] deeper into apostasy as we sung that
[53:42] song deeper deeper in the love of christ
[53:44] the world is going deeper and deeper the
[53:47] church world is going deeper and deeper
[53:49] into i'm in need of nothing
[53:53] just finally stepping away from the
[53:55] truth
[53:56] even though some of them are still going
[53:59] to church their heart is not after
[54:02] seeking god
[54:04] that's why they can come to church they
[54:05] never hit the prayer closet
[54:09] why they never enter into the worship of
[54:11] the lord
[54:13] because the heart
[54:15] isn't where it needs to be amen
[54:18] now the scriptures warn us of this
[54:19] evolving and in the last days that the
[54:22] two spirits good and evil
[54:25] life and death
[54:26] knowledge and revelation would be so
[54:29] close that it would deceive the very
[54:32] elect if it were possible but that's the
[54:34] only group that can't be
[54:38] there would be many that would be ever
[54:40] learning and never able to come to the
[54:42] knowledge
[54:43] or the full discernment or recognition
[54:47] of the truth
[54:48] which can only come by revelation
[54:51] god's the only one that can give that
[54:53] out you a man to come to church and and
[54:56] hear revelation
[54:58] from god
[55:00] from a man does not exist on the planet
[55:04] man can't give revelation i don't care
[55:06] how anointed man is
[55:08] all revelation comes from god
[55:11] we have to recognize god is here if
[55:12] god's using a man he's he's always used
[55:15] man
[55:16] he chose the foolishness of preaching to
[55:19] save man
[55:20] but it has to be god in the man
[55:26] remember god alone reserves the right to
[55:29] open
[55:30] these eyes
[55:31] your eyes
[55:33] matthew 11 verse 25 jesus
[55:36] at that time jesus answered
[55:38] and said i thank the o father lord of
[55:40] heaven and earth because thou has hid
[55:42] these things from the wise and prudent
[55:46] and has revealed
[55:48] or to make known
[55:51] or to take the cover off
[55:56] to them that are babes
[56:00] so i don't care how low you may feel how
[56:04] much you don't feel you know god how
[56:07] much you feel you're uh away
[56:11] if you
[56:12] can just have this humble i need you
[56:16] jesus
[56:19] those are the ones that god has chose to
[56:21] reveal
[56:23] not somebody who who knows everything
[56:26] knows the bible i mean he passed up the
[56:28] pharisees and sadducees of his day
[56:32] the scholar the learned
[56:37] so
[56:38] be a babe this morning
[56:40] i said be obeyed this morning in
[56:42] learning
[56:43] be a babe in in this morning in in
[56:47] humility and what you're clothed with
[56:49] and and being needy
[56:53] and be strong in believing the word
[56:58] even so father for it seemed good nice
[57:00] sight all things are delivered unto me
[57:01] and my father and no man knoweth the son
[57:04] but the father
[57:07] neither knoweth any man
[57:09] the father saved the son
[57:11] and to whom
[57:13] so ever the son
[57:15] will reveal
[57:21] if
[57:23] i said
[57:24] there was 500 in the envelope stash
[57:27] somewhere in this church
[57:30] and i'm telling you all about it
[57:35] and i say it could be
[57:37] it's in the church
[57:41] but there's one person that i told
[57:44] left to ear
[57:46] where it is
[57:47] in the church
[57:51] there would only be one person who was
[57:53] revealed to
[57:55] and that person who is revealed to he
[57:57] could say
[57:59] yes
[58:00] it is in the church
[58:03] but he knows more personally
[58:08] and that's what revelation is it isn't
[58:10] just the outside appearance of it's in
[58:13] the church this is god he's in his word
[58:16] but when it becomes so personal he spoke
[58:19] it to you
[58:22] that's how god wants us
[58:24] to god wants us to see him in our
[58:26] personal life amen
[58:30] and only god can open our eyes in our
[58:32] personal situations
[58:34] but we've got to be looking for them
[58:37] it's one thing to know god and it's
[58:38] another thing to know god in all of our
[58:40] problems
[58:42] right
[58:44] one thing to talk about god and this is
[58:46] what god this is the quotes and this and
[58:48] that and the other but it's another
[58:49] thing to say you know right in the
[58:50] middle of my problems there's god amen
[58:53] amen knowing god differently
[58:57] paul said in philippians 3 10 says that
[58:59] i might know him
[59:02] that i might know him now paul knew
[59:04] christ
[59:06] he knew him for 30 years when he makes
[59:08] this statement amen so what's the big
[59:11] deal
[59:14] he wanted to know god more
[59:17] and that is the key if you want to find
[59:19] god in your in your
[59:22] problems in your in your that the trials
[59:24] that you're going through in your
[59:26] current situation you can't just keep
[59:29] the same old attitude of murmuring and
[59:31] complaining about things that are are
[59:33] negative and wrong
[59:36] and expect to see god more and more in
[59:39] your problems like he's going to honor
[59:41] the negativity
[59:46] look at he said that i might know him in
[59:48] the power of his resurrection and the
[59:50] fellowship of his sufferings
[59:53] what do they do
[59:55] being made conformable
[59:57] unto his death
[59:59] everything that we're going through
[1:00:02] is not to make us feel bad or unhappy or
[1:00:05] to suffer for
[1:00:07] for wrong reasons
[1:00:10] it's that when we're hurting we look to
[1:00:12] jesus and we say jesus
[1:00:16] you must increase and be exalted i must
[1:00:18] decrease
[1:00:21] but too often
[1:00:22] we get bothered because of the situation
[1:00:24] and we begin to question where is god
[1:00:26] and how come he hasn't helped us and why
[1:00:28] is he leaving why is this happening in
[1:00:30] my life and we often we try to seek out
[1:00:33] answers other ways and we all we can do
[1:00:36] is testify of a god of a past and hope
[1:00:38] for a future but god wants to be the god
[1:00:40] of our present situation
[1:00:42] we've got to learn to be still and know
[1:00:44] that he's god right now
[1:00:47] well the world is just going crazy i
[1:00:49] mean it's going crazy the bride needs to
[1:00:52] be getting closer to god
[1:00:58] you want to see god in the church
[1:01:01] yes you do
[1:01:03] i want to see god in your life
[1:01:06] goes both ways
[1:01:09] easy to come to church and put the
[1:01:10] pressure on the church
[1:01:14] your home is a church
[1:01:16] your life is a church
[1:01:18] there ought to be testimonies coming out
[1:01:20] of that amen
[1:01:23] god
[1:01:24] alone has the answers to our life's
[1:01:27] problems
[1:01:29] there isn't anything that god can't
[1:01:30] handle
[1:01:32] he told abraham is there anything too
[1:01:34] hard for god
[1:01:36] for the lord
[1:01:38] he promised that he wouldn't put
[1:01:39] anything on us that we couldn't handle
[1:01:43] yet
[1:01:45] our doubts and our negativity
[1:01:51] call god a liar
[1:01:58] he promised to make a way but how does
[1:02:00] he make that way
[1:02:03] are we even recognizing the way
[1:02:06] are we just judging him
[1:02:08] where you at god
[1:02:10] where are you at when he said i'll be
[1:02:12] with you even in you to the end where
[1:02:13] are you at god
[1:02:16] we're pulling god on trial because he's
[1:02:19] not taking care of a problem and god
[1:02:21] says i have no problem with this problem
[1:02:23] being here i allowed it to be here i
[1:02:26] want you to exalt me right now
[1:02:28] i want you to be still and know that i
[1:02:30] am god that's why i brought this thing
[1:02:32] to you
[1:02:34] hallelujah
[1:02:36] sometimes we just want
[1:02:38] the negative things the wrong things out
[1:02:40] of our life and that's god's job just to
[1:02:42] be the the do boy of our situation but
[1:02:45] god wants to be exalted he wants to be
[1:02:46] appraised
[1:02:48] not just when we feel good and the song
[1:02:50] leader did a good job they're playing
[1:02:51] the favorite songs and you've got the
[1:02:53] favorite scripture and you just gotta
[1:02:54] raise and everything's going great in
[1:02:56] your life
[1:02:59] but when the bottom falls out
[1:03:02] he wants to be exalted he wants to be
[1:03:04] exalted
[1:03:09] we cannot make it by the knowledge of
[1:03:11] god alone
[1:03:15] we cannot make it
[1:03:18] by what we're
[1:03:20] presently
[1:03:21] where we're presently at with god
[1:03:26] i can't make it
[1:03:28] i can't say that i have made myself
[1:03:30] ready
[1:03:33] and
[1:03:38] always tore up and bothered about
[1:03:40] something that's going on
[1:03:44] that's not what he's that's not what
[1:03:45] he's marrying
[1:03:47] that's not what he's what he's calling
[1:03:48] he's calling for someone that though he
[1:03:51] slay me yeah i trust him
[1:03:53] though i'm going through this situation
[1:03:55] i trust god he's with me i i i may not
[1:03:59] feel it i may not see it but faith my
[1:04:01] sixth sense i know it i know it and if
[1:04:04] you don't know it be still until you do
[1:04:07] know it
[1:04:09] amen
[1:04:11] you can't look at god as some mcdonald's
[1:04:15] fast food
[1:04:17] fix my problem real fast
[1:04:20] it's true
[1:04:21] like if you fix my problem i'll be happy
[1:04:25] i'll praise you if you fix my problem
[1:04:29] well
[1:04:31] he didn't fix jobs probably right away
[1:04:33] in fact it got harder
[1:04:34] it got worse and we don't got a timeline
[1:04:37] of how long it took
[1:04:39] but when we read it it's like a story we
[1:04:41] think oh just well it just happened real
[1:04:42] quick like if you know three days it was
[1:04:44] over
[1:04:46] think about what he went through
[1:04:49] and yet he maintained
[1:04:53] he didn't let anything affect him to
[1:04:56] turn himself away from god
[1:05:03] that's our brother
[1:05:04] he's the bride
[1:05:06] he enoch's the bride
[1:05:09] elijah's the bride
[1:05:11] we're the bride we can't be any
[1:05:12] different we can't be any different see
[1:05:14] god is calling us to where they're at
[1:05:19] amen
[1:05:20] they
[1:05:21] us without them can't be made perfect
[1:05:25] so it's not just waiting for time
[1:05:26] waiting for the world to end waiting for
[1:05:29] this that no it's there's the waiting
[1:05:31] the waiting is god waiting
[1:05:34] on us
[1:05:36] why i thought he was waiting on the last
[1:05:39] seat
[1:05:40] well yes he is but he's waiting on you
[1:05:42] to go get him
[1:05:44] god's still waiting on us
[1:05:53] we got to know god in a greater measure
[1:05:57] a greater measure than where we're at
[1:06:01] get to the place where as soon as the
[1:06:03] trial hits
[1:06:05] and that satan comes and says you're
[1:06:07] doomed you're being
[1:06:10] you're being
[1:06:11] judged for what god
[1:06:13] what what you did
[1:06:15] you're reaping what you
[1:06:16] you sold
[1:06:18] or he beats over the head with sickness
[1:06:20] or some past sin
[1:06:22] it's time to rise up and testify exalt
[1:06:26] the lord i
[1:06:28] know
[1:06:29] my god
[1:06:30] he is with me he's not leaving me
[1:06:36] i've left him but he doesn't leave me
[1:06:39] right
[1:06:40] that's why i get on my knees and i say
[1:06:42] sorry lord
[1:06:44] sorry for my wrong thoughts sorry sorry
[1:06:47] for not praying
[1:06:48] more
[1:06:49] amen
[1:06:52] it's me that does the wrong it's never
[1:06:54] god
[1:06:55] so if my situation i'm not happy with if
[1:06:57] it's not where it needs to be is up to
[1:06:59] me to be still
[1:07:01] get before the lord they that wait upon
[1:07:04] the lord shall renew their strength
[1:07:06] get ahold of the presence of god and let
[1:07:08] him be the god of your situation this
[1:07:11] thing well i don't know what to do about
[1:07:12] this and i don't know what to do about
[1:07:14] that and this thing is happening i just

[1:07:18] where's the god
[1:07:19] that you serve
[1:07:21] where is the god that you claim to serve
[1:07:26] it's important to put enough pressure on
[1:07:29] yourself to get on your knees
[1:07:31] i don't want you to have pressure to
[1:07:33] where you feel bad and feel like i
[1:07:35] failed and feel indifferent and feel
[1:07:38] like what you know what no have enough
[1:07:40] pressure to get on your knees and say i

[1:07:46] that i know that i know that my god is a
[1:07:49] present help in a time of need how is
[1:07:51] god going to be the same yesterday today
[1:07:53] and forever if you don't have him be
[1:07:55] present in your life he's not just i
[1:07:58] know him uh yesterday and i know him of
[1:08:00] the future but he's a present help in
[1:08:02] the time of need
[1:08:05] amen
[1:08:07] anybody can testify oh yeah i knew god
[1:08:09] was with me back then and oh yeah i just
[1:08:12] i knew it all along but

[1:08:18] your doubts
[1:08:20] still remember you're complaining still
[1:08:23] remember your word and still remember
[1:08:25] your fears

[1:08:44] that we can say i know that i know that
[1:08:47] i know
[1:08:50] and i just love that about god he gives
[1:08:52] us lots of chances
[1:08:55] and it's it's more precious than gold
[1:08:58] but look if we don't get to know god in
[1:09:00] the present form how are we going to
[1:09:01] know that we're ready
[1:09:06] hey look we're not going to make the
[1:09:08] rapture because we're in the message
[1:09:10] how many people are in the message that
[1:09:14] aren't going to make the rapture
[1:09:16] why ain't that being preached
[1:09:21] we need to know him
[1:09:23] need to know more i'm not against not
[1:09:25] saying nobody don't know him no i'm not
[1:09:27] saying that
[1:09:29] i want to know god more i'm standing
[1:09:31] with paul i want to know him in the in
[1:09:33] the power of resurrection the fellowship
[1:09:35] of his sufferings i want to know him in

[1:09:42] if he's choosing to slay me i'm still
[1:09:44] going to testify that i'm still going to
[1:09:47] exalt him he wants to be exalted among
[1:09:49] the heathen
[1:09:53] brother branham said
[1:09:55] in the message jehovah jireh
[1:09:59] as
[1:10:00] we follow this great patriarch abraham
[1:10:04] in the lesson tonight
[1:10:06] may we find our position
[1:10:10] knowing
[1:10:11] that we are children of abraham by faith
[1:10:12] in christ
[1:10:14] we all believe we're we're children of
[1:10:17] abraham children of god but his prayer
[1:10:21] is lord even though we are them
[1:10:24] help me to find my position
[1:10:28] our position it told your position is to
[1:10:32] totally trust god for your life that's
[1:10:34] your position
[1:10:36] amen
[1:10:37] no matter what's going on he's still god
[1:10:39] he's still reigns he's the
[1:10:41] the god of jacob is our refuge
[1:10:46] in the message recognizing your day and
[1:10:47] its message brother and it says and
[1:10:49] we're looking to him this morning
[1:10:52] to reveal this context
[1:10:55] that's written in the book
[1:10:58] because it is the book of redemption
[1:11:02] and all that is redeemed in written
[1:11:05] therein i'm sorry all that is redeemed
[1:11:07] is written therein
[1:11:10] may we find our position this morning
[1:11:14] in the time that we're living
[1:11:20] if you knew god was sitting next to you
[1:11:26] what would you do different than you're
[1:11:28] doing now
[1:11:33] the greatest thing is we could is
[1:11:34] recognize that god the realness of god
[1:11:37] isn't some god that's always out there
[1:11:39] somewhere
[1:11:44] if i can't know him here what difference
[1:11:46] does it know of knowing god out there
[1:11:49] that can't do me any good
[1:11:52] i could have all knowledge know all
[1:11:54] mysteries
[1:11:55] but if i don't have him here
[1:12:00] i can't exalt god out there
[1:12:04] the garbage that's going out in the
[1:12:06] world i can't change their mind
[1:12:10] i can't
[1:12:11] i can't
[1:12:13] uh get them to stop doing what they're
[1:12:15] doing
[1:12:18] if i could i would are you kidding the
[1:12:20] desire's there
[1:12:23] but i can exalt him in my life this is
[1:12:26] the only vessel that i have control over
[1:12:30] it's the only one where i can stand
[1:12:33] still long enough
[1:12:34] and know him to be the god of my life
[1:12:38] that he's
[1:12:39] never did me harm that he's never led me
[1:12:41] the wrong way
[1:12:43] that it's been me that's always forsaken
[1:12:45] him
[1:12:51] to think though that you have control of
[1:12:54] exalting god and
[1:12:55] brother brandon says we all could get to
[1:12:57] that place
[1:12:59] one mind one accord if we could get to
[1:13:01] that one position in christ
[1:13:04] there wouldn't be one feeble one among
[1:13:06] us
[1:13:11] brother branham said
[1:13:14] in the message god keeps his word he
[1:13:16] says we are unworthy of any of thy
[1:13:19] blessings
[1:13:21] but it's because of thy goodness
[1:13:24] has been extended to us
[1:13:27] that's why we come humbly asking you
[1:13:29] today
[1:13:30] that you will continue to be with us
[1:13:33] let us find our place in our position in
[1:13:36] thee
[1:13:37] lose ourselves
[1:13:39] and find it lord in thee
[1:13:42] amen isn't that
[1:13:44] beautiful and make us
[1:13:48] that we that i'm sorry
[1:13:50] make us that which we should be get
[1:13:52] glory out of the service today before we
[1:13:54] ask it in jesus christ's name
[1:13:56] amen
[1:13:57] i love that position position isn't
[1:14:01] your where your body is sitting
[1:14:04] it's where your heart is sitting today
[1:14:06] is where your heart is at in the message
[1:14:09] we would see jesus brother brandon says
[1:14:10] you're in position
[1:14:12] you put yourself into position by catch
[1:14:16] this by recognizing him
[1:14:20] that you're a subject now to see
[1:14:23] greater things when you get yourself in
[1:14:26] position with christ now
[1:14:29] you put yourself in position to see
[1:14:31] greater things
[1:14:32] and that's scriptural because he gives
[1:14:34] more grace to the humble he resists the
[1:14:36] proud
[1:14:37] but you put your clothes of humility on
[1:14:40] and you get humble before him you're in
[1:14:42] that position
[1:14:44] now you're going to see christ in your
[1:14:46] life
[1:14:47] greater things
[1:14:49] look i would love to sit here and have a
[1:14:51] minister come and get such a great
[1:14:52] revelation said man i never seen that i
[1:14:55] never knew that that's the greatest
[1:14:56] thing i'm going to preach that next time
[1:14:58] i'm up at the pulpit
[1:15:00] but i would rather have never that
[1:15:03] and be able to see god in my life
[1:15:08] presently through all my problems
[1:15:11] not past god it's
[1:15:14] past is 20 20 is always 20 20. you can
[1:15:18] always see god in your past
[1:15:22] god i want to exalt you for the past
[1:15:29] god wants to be the god of the i am
[1:15:32] i am that i am amen tell him that i am
[1:15:34] that i am amen
[1:15:36] not that i was but a present help in a
[1:15:39] time of need
[1:15:42] do you want a relationship with somebody
[1:15:45] of the past
[1:15:50] let me reword that
[1:15:53] would you like to have a a present
[1:15:54] relationship with somebody who's dead
[1:15:56] and gone
[1:16:00] no
[1:16:02] no i mean to have a relation brother
[1:16:05] martin let me just say this because
[1:16:06] everything can be twisted i say nowadays
[1:16:09] so brother mark you're going to end up
[1:16:11] getting married here would you like to
[1:16:12] have a relationship with somebody
[1:16:17] of the past that's dead and gone
[1:16:21] okay with the situations that god has
[1:16:23] blessed us with in the past they're gone
[1:16:27] when when paul said forgetting those
[1:16:29] things which are behind it wasn't just
[1:16:31] all the bad problems and things the bad
[1:16:34] things he did they were his victories as
[1:16:36] well
[1:16:42] it's important that you hunger
[1:16:44] for a present relationship
[1:16:48] and not just one of the past we don't
[1:16:50] come to church to learn about god in
[1:16:52] history
[1:16:53] and we don't come to church to learn
[1:16:55] about god in prophecy
[1:17:00] i'm just saying that oh it's coming we
[1:17:02] come to get god today amen i want god
[1:17:05] today
[1:17:09] you ever come to church you want god to
[1:17:10] speak to you about a certain thing but
[1:17:11] the preacher didn't say one thing about
[1:17:14] it wonder if it's because we weren't in
[1:17:17] position
[1:17:18] because he said seek ye first the
[1:17:20] kingdom and all other things will be
[1:17:21] added and i'm not against desiring god
[1:17:24] in certain things but you know we ought
[1:17:26] to come to church with reverence
[1:17:29] so we don't come to church this is no
[1:17:30] ouija board here
[1:17:32] we we come here there's a there's a
[1:17:34] relationship that we have with god
[1:17:37] okay and the message the greatest battle
[1:17:39] ever fought brother brandon says and we
[1:17:40] are today sitting here and one or
[1:17:43] another
[1:17:45] uh or
[1:17:46] and one or the other power is going to
[1:17:49] control us
[1:17:51] we're sitting here today
[1:17:54] and wonder the other power is going to
[1:17:55] control us so let's cast out the evil
[1:17:57] one
[1:17:58] amen
[1:18:00] so let
[1:18:02] it's collectively amen let's cast out
[1:18:05] the evil one
[1:18:07] let's collectively take our position
[1:18:10] like the stars of heaven amen
[1:18:13] position like the stars you ever look up
[1:18:15] there is it
[1:18:16] oh yeah
[1:18:17] stars gonna be you know
[1:18:20] you know
[1:18:21] when you look in the sky you're not
[1:18:23] gonna see the ocean going up there
[1:18:29] you might see clouds and you may not see
[1:18:31] the stars but when those clouds move
[1:18:33] late at night you won't see the stars
[1:18:38] and brother branham here
[1:18:40] is telling us that we
[1:18:42] should take our position like the stars
[1:18:44] of heaven in other words
[1:18:47] you should always be
[1:18:48] in the same spot
[1:18:52] amen
[1:18:53] bouncing all over the place not your
[1:18:55] testimony bouncing like god is with me
[1:18:57] god i don't i don't see god well i just
[1:19:00] wish he would be here
[1:19:02] you may not say those words but when you
[1:19:04] start getting frustrated and and
[1:19:06] bothered and and and and starting to get
[1:19:09] anxious
[1:19:12] just remember
[1:19:14] choose
[1:19:15] what mary chose
[1:19:18] she chose the better part
[1:19:21] she just stood still got before the lord
[1:19:25] be be like a star
[1:19:28] look at yourself like a star
[1:19:30] like a pillar
[1:19:32] hey man you're in your position when
[1:19:34] people think of you there is no question
[1:19:36] what they're thinking
[1:19:48] this
[1:19:49] over the weekend
[1:19:50] as you know i have a pretty big honeydew
[1:19:52] list
[1:19:53] and
[1:19:55] i can't get them all done i i i won't
[1:19:58] better live that long but i'm still
[1:20:00] working on them
[1:20:01] so this weekend i went to go get some
[1:20:03] wood for some planter boxes
[1:20:06] and as i was driving away from home
[1:20:08] depot with this load in my truck i
[1:20:10] thought brother stan i thought about
[1:20:12] brother stan
[1:20:13] telling me one time he got some wood and
[1:20:16] it came out of his truck and ended up in
[1:20:18] the middle of the road and another car
[1:20:20] had stopped and they were shoving it
[1:20:22] back in there
[1:20:25] so as i decided to take o23 up
[1:20:30] when i got to white lake road i stopped
[1:20:31] everything was fine
[1:20:33] and then i just i'm talking on the phone
[1:20:35] with johnny
[1:20:36] and uh about work of course
[1:20:38] and
[1:20:39] and so i hit the pedal but i don't think
[1:20:41] i gunned it very much
[1:20:43] but i gunned it enough to where it came
[1:20:46] out just like it did for brother stan
[1:20:50] all this wood i mean it you couldn't
[1:20:52] have put it better in the middle of the
[1:20:53] intersection if if you tried
[1:20:56] and it wasn't just like three or four
[1:20:58] ports no i had a whole
[1:21:01] the whole thing so another car had
[1:21:03] stopped and
[1:21:04] and and they're helping me get it back
[1:21:06] in there and i'm telling you we put it
[1:21:08] in there quick
[1:21:10] real quick said thank you
[1:21:12] didn't offer any money or nothing
[1:21:13] because
[1:21:16] he was they were nice they were nice
[1:21:18] people
[1:21:19] and so we did it real quick and i got
[1:21:21] back in the truck and i'm getting ready
[1:21:23] to pull off and i get
[1:21:25] i mean i didn't go
[1:21:27] 20 feet
[1:21:29] and the sirens were behind me
[1:21:32] and the light the the stake trooper had
[1:21:35] pulled me over
[1:21:36] so i didn't go very far
[1:21:39] this incident happened so fast
[1:21:41] you literally have been at a stoplight
[1:21:44] much longer than this whole incident
[1:21:46] happened that's how fast it was
[1:21:49] and so
[1:21:51] i i pull up further so he could get
[1:21:53] behind me but he still didn't want to
[1:21:55] get over there he stayed to the side and
[1:21:57] he come over and he talked to me he says
[1:21:59] well i'm sure you know why i'm pulling
[1:22:00] you over and i said yes i do yes i do
[1:22:04] the obvious happened
[1:22:07] and um
[1:22:09] he says you should have you know
[1:22:12] tied it up and where are you going and
[1:22:14] can i see your driver's license
[1:22:17] can i see your proof of registration can
[1:22:19] i see your or your proof of insurance
[1:22:21] can i see your registration so i got
[1:22:22] those out and gave it to him and i'm i'm
[1:22:24] sitting there in the car
[1:22:26] and don't feel
[1:22:28] anxious or bad but satan came
[1:22:32] but satan came
[1:22:36] and he said you tell him
[1:22:39] that you could have left me off with a
[1:22:41] warning you know
[1:22:49] i thought that was wrong thought i'm
[1:22:52] here because of a mistake i made
[1:22:58] so it came it came quick dealt with it
[1:23:00] quick and i just stood there so he came
[1:23:02] for a long time how many tickets you
[1:23:04] write me anyways
[1:23:06] man i could have been home and bad by
[1:23:07] then you know
[1:23:09] so he came back and he said
[1:23:14] well i'm letting you off the hook
[1:23:16] for for one reason no there's two
[1:23:18] reasons one reason is when i look at
[1:23:20] your record there ain't one thing on it
[1:23:27] it's important
[1:23:30] when people look at you
[1:23:32] to know that you're rock-solid
[1:23:38] and he says the other reason is i
[1:23:40] actually never seen it come out but by
[1:23:42] the time i got there i saw how fast you
[1:23:44] were cleaning up that mess i couldn't
[1:23:46] hardly believe it
[1:23:52] so we're grateful god for god's grace
[1:23:53] and mercy but remember you may think
[1:23:56] this is mundane and it doesn't mean
[1:23:58] anything just going to church and being
[1:23:59] faithful and praying and really and
[1:24:02] being there when you're called upon but
[1:24:04] i'm telling you that's what god is
[1:24:06] looking for in his bride
[1:24:08] amen let me finish reading this let's
[1:24:10] take our position like the stars of
[1:24:12] heaven as the bible speaks wandering
[1:24:14] stars over in the book of jude foaming
[1:24:16] out their own shame and we don't want to
[1:24:18] be wandering stars
[1:24:20] wonder if this is right wonder if that
[1:24:22] is right wonder if it will happen wonder
[1:24:25] if it could be or how it could be he
[1:24:27] says don't wander
[1:24:29] stay like those stars of heaven
[1:24:31] as real soldiers at the post of duty
[1:24:34] stand there believing in his life or
[1:24:36] death
[1:24:39] in the message does god ever change his
[1:24:41] word about
[1:24:42] excuse me does god ever change his mind
[1:24:43] about his word he said let us bow our
[1:24:46] heads dear lord jesus
[1:24:49] we are assembled again in your name
[1:24:52] which great expectation for the
[1:24:54] outpouring of the quickening power of
[1:24:56] god what is that going to do
[1:24:59] to
[1:25:00] bring us into recognition of our
[1:25:02] position
[1:25:04] and our place
[1:25:05] why do some people want the holy ghost
[1:25:07] to pour out on them
[1:25:10] how many times have they said because i
[1:25:12] want to recognize my position in christ
[1:25:16] it's all about
[1:25:17] other reasons and i'm not against other
[1:25:19] reasons
[1:25:21] but god wants us in our position
[1:25:23] he wants us in our place
[1:25:27] he says to bring us into recognition of
[1:25:29] our position and our place and our
[1:25:32] responsibilities
[1:25:35] as being a called people separated from
[1:25:37] the world dedicated to god granted lord
[1:25:40] tonight that the blessings of god would
[1:25:42] guide and direct us into the things that
[1:25:44] we do and say that it might bring honor
[1:25:46] and glory to your name amen
[1:25:49] now god wants to be exalted
[1:25:52] in our problems he really does
[1:25:56] number one it takes faith
[1:25:59] i believe that god is here
[1:26:02] two we need to learn to be still
[1:26:05] and identify where he's at
[1:26:10] okay so you get slapped on the cheek
[1:26:15] first thing you're going to say is i'm
[1:26:16] not going to talk to you again
[1:26:19] it's going to be a while before i talk
[1:26:20] to you
[1:26:24] well that's not god that's just how i an
[1:26:26] eye for an eye and two for just oh
[1:26:27] nature coming out
[1:26:30] so where's god in this where god is is
[1:26:33] be still
[1:26:35] turn the other cheek
[1:26:37] that's where god is at
[1:26:39] god is in love he's in forgiveness he's
[1:26:41] in mercy that's where god is at
[1:26:43] but it requires responsibility you got
[1:26:46] to take your position your place
[1:26:50] it's not about seeing god with these
[1:26:52] eyes
[1:26:53] it's about seeing god with these eyes
[1:26:56] eyes of faith
[1:27:00] in exodus chapter 14 verse 13 you know
[1:27:03] we're not going to have um time to go
[1:27:06] through this whole thing
[1:27:10] just pray for me that we can get through
[1:27:11] the parts that we need to get through
[1:27:13] because there's a lot of stuff here
[1:27:16] exodus 14 13 and moses said unto the
[1:27:18] people
[1:27:19] fear ye not
[1:27:22] we know when this happened they
[1:27:24] they left egypt and egypt was
[1:27:26] coming after them and they
[1:27:28] they had no place to go they were boxed
[1:27:30] in
[1:27:31] and moses said unto the people fear ye
[1:27:34] not stand still and see the salvation of
[1:27:37] the lord
[1:27:39] which he will show you today for the
[1:27:41] egyptians who you have seen today ye
[1:27:44] shall see
[1:27:45] them again no more
[1:27:48] now
[1:27:50] i want us to believe everything in the
[1:27:52] old testament is a type of the new
[1:27:54] testament
[1:27:55] everything that happened naturally in
[1:27:57] the old testament is a spiritual type of
[1:28:00] what happens to us in the new in our
[1:28:03] lives
[1:28:05] so there's going to come times that
[1:28:06] you're boxed in
[1:28:10] but god wants you
[1:28:12] to be still and believe don't fear that
[1:28:15] the problem that you're seeing right now
[1:28:17] that you have seen that you have dealt
[1:28:20] with for a while is going to be here no
[1:28:22] more
[1:28:24] but you've got to believe it
[1:28:27] that's the difference
[1:28:29] i mean god may do some things for your
[1:28:32] life for a while
[1:28:34] but afterwards if you don't believe he's
[1:28:36] going to stop
[1:28:40] the lord shall fight for you and ye
[1:28:43] shall
[1:28:44] hold your peace hold your peace hold
[1:28:48] your horses take a chill pill
[1:28:51] that's sometimes what we need to hear
[1:28:53] when we're going through stuff in our
[1:28:54] lives instead of just letting their mind
[1:28:57] go to all these imaginable terrible
[1:29:00] things of negativity that don't bring
[1:29:02] any honor and glory to jesus christ
[1:29:05] we need to take our own chill pill
[1:29:08] just calm down be still
[1:29:11] he still remains god
[1:29:14] he wants us to stand still he wants us
[1:29:16] to know that he's going to take care of
[1:29:19] this problem but we've got to trust him
[1:29:21] for it
[1:29:26] we don't want to just be testifying
[1:29:27] after it's over
[1:29:30] i mean i'm i appreciate all testimonies
[1:29:34] but if we're only going to testify
[1:29:37] after it's all over
[1:29:39] i say like this
[1:29:41] god wants us closer to him
[1:29:43] he wants a present relationship with us
[1:29:45] not a constant past
[1:29:47] but a present relationship and that's
[1:29:49] why
[1:29:50] this ministry here is always pulling
[1:29:53] about you seeking god pulling to get
[1:29:55] more of god hunger for more of god to
[1:29:57] receive more of god it isn't to come
[1:30:00] against
[1:30:01] uh your your thought process that you
[1:30:03] don't have god
[1:30:06] not trying to belittle that
[1:30:08] it's just we ought to be coming here
[1:30:10] with testimonies of everything that that
[1:30:12] god is doing in the middle of your
[1:30:13] trials
[1:30:15] and that it's happened so many times
[1:30:17] that we know what the end's going to be
[1:30:19] amen we know what the end's going to be
[1:30:22] turn with me if you would
[1:30:24] to ephesians chapter 1.
[1:30:27] god wants to save every one of us from
[1:30:29] our complex
[1:30:31] difficult situations he wants to be a
[1:30:34] present help amen
[1:30:38] he wants us to know him in present tense
[1:30:40] if i could just say it like this we know
[1:30:42] god in the past he saved us
[1:30:44] we know he promised us a future
[1:30:47] i know the thoughts i think towards you
[1:30:49] to give you an expected end but god
[1:30:51] wants us to know him in present tense
[1:30:56] and the best way to do that is get him
[1:30:58] on the inside
[1:31:00] it's bubbling it's bobbling it's
[1:31:02] bubbling so it don't matter what happens
[1:31:04] he's still bubbling

[1:33:16] far above all principalities and powers

[1:33:44] when you're staring at how bad things
[1:33:46] are going you don't know what to do and
[1:33:47] you don't know which direction to go you
[1:33:49] need to recognize those things are under
[1:33:52] his feet
[1:33:55] let's see if that power isn't working in
[1:33:57] you if you're not believing that how do
[1:33:59] we know the power is working you're
[1:34:01] believing it that's that's simple if you
[1:34:03] believe it it will happen
[1:34:05] ephesians 3 verse 14 for this cause i
[1:34:08] bow my knees unto the father of our lord
[1:34:11] jesus christ of whom the whole family in
[1:34:13] heaven is and earth is named that he
[1:34:15] would grant you according to the riches
[1:34:18] of his glory to be strengthened with his
[1:34:20] might by the spirit
[1:34:22] by his spirit in the inner man
[1:34:25] that's why
[1:34:27] we don't want to be talking about what
[1:34:28] we see
[1:34:29] these eyes the outer man looking at the
[1:34:31] problem looking at the bills looking at
[1:34:34] the sickness looking at whatever we're
[1:34:36] looking at
[1:34:37] he strengthened us on the inside to
[1:34:39] believe
[1:34:40] that christ may dwell in your hearts by
[1:34:44] faith
[1:34:45] not going to believe he's not going to
[1:34:46] be there
[1:34:48] that he being rooted and grounded in
[1:34:50] love
[1:34:53] may be able to comprehend with all
[1:34:55] saints
[1:34:56] what is the breath the length of death
[1:34:58] and height now i just want to say this
[1:35:01] christ dwells in our hearts by faith now
[1:35:03] if you're not going to believe i said
[1:35:04] he's not going to be there and i'll say
[1:35:05] it like this so you understand more
[1:35:07] clearly he won't be there in your
[1:35:09] present situation
[1:35:13] you've got to believe for him in your
[1:35:14] present situation
[1:35:17] now unto him that is able he's able
[1:35:20] to do exceedingly abundantly above all
[1:35:24] that we would ask or even think
[1:35:26] according to the power that worketh in
[1:35:30] us
[1:35:31] not the pastor
[1:35:34] not brother branham
[1:35:38] you
[1:35:40] you what power is working in you
[1:35:44] not the power of abracadabra
[1:35:48] not that power
[1:35:50] the power to believe when the devil
[1:35:52] tells you something you don't go with it
[1:35:56] that power
[1:36:01] now unto him
[1:36:02] be glory
[1:36:04] in the church of jesus christ throughout
[1:36:05] all ages without an
[1:36:09] amen
[1:36:10] stand still and know that he is god of
[1:36:12] our situation
[1:36:14] amen
[1:36:15] if i were to ask you a question do you
[1:36:17] know jesus christ each one of you would
[1:36:20] undoubtedly say yes of course i know
[1:36:22] jesus christ as
[1:36:25] god
[1:36:26] as i'm a son of god and i i know him
[1:36:31] and i would never doubt that myself if
[1:36:33] you would say that
[1:36:37] but is that enough
[1:36:41] maybe we could
[1:36:42] ask the question this way how much do
[1:36:44] you know jesus christ
[1:36:48] remember peter was going
[1:36:50] to be given the keys to the kingdom
[1:36:52] and he knew by revelation that jesus was
[1:36:55] the christ the son of the living god
[1:36:58] he had
[1:37:00] that revelation
[1:37:03] there was another time in peter's walk
[1:37:05] that most of the believers had actually
[1:37:07] left the church
[1:37:08] and jesus asked his disciples a personal
[1:37:11] question
[1:37:13] he said will you go away also
[1:37:16] the majority left the church but what
[1:37:17] about you
[1:37:19] and simon peter answered lord to whom
[1:37:21] shall we go thou is the words of eternal
[1:37:23] life and we believe and are sure
[1:37:26] that thou art that christ that christ
[1:37:29] the son of the living god
[1:37:31] so here's another testimony
[1:37:34] and he stayed with him
[1:37:37] but when it comes to a much stronger
[1:37:40] test
[1:37:41] stronger than just a decision
[1:37:44] about what you're going to do when your
[1:37:46] brothers and sisters leave the church
[1:37:49] it's a test that comes to every one of
[1:37:51] us
[1:37:52] it's something that every one of us will
[1:37:53] go through if we never have a split in
[1:37:55] this church and by the grace of god we
[1:37:57] never want to have a split or or or have
[1:38:00] uh people leave
[1:38:04] but every one of us
[1:38:06] this test is coming and that's the test
[1:38:09] of being left alone and what are you
[1:38:12] going to do when you're alone
[1:38:15] and it may come many times
[1:38:18] it's the test of standing alone and
[1:38:21] knowing that god is presently with you
[1:38:26] to where you could say
[1:38:28] where would i go thou alone has the
[1:38:31] words of eternal life
[1:38:34] you can't doubt it
[1:38:36] amen
[1:38:38] when they came to take jesus away
[1:38:41] peter
[1:38:43] he knew who jesus was
[1:38:47] but you know he wouldn't stand still
[1:38:51] he took out his sword of like a lot of
[1:38:54] us do sometimes when
[1:38:57] we feel something's wrong we're going to
[1:38:58] take our sword out
[1:39:01] and we're going to start chopping
[1:39:03] up people who say things
[1:39:06] who do things to us
[1:39:10] he drew his sword
[1:39:13] he knew
[1:39:14] jesus
[1:39:15] as
[1:39:16] the son of god
[1:39:19] but he didn't stand still
[1:39:21] long enough
[1:39:23] to know that he was the god of that
[1:39:24] situation
[1:39:27] and this is what's really important god
[1:39:29] wants us to know him in our present
[1:39:32] situations and when it seems calamity is
[1:39:35] happening everywhere he doesn't want us
[1:39:37] to run he doesn't want us to draw the
[1:39:39] sword and start cutting things and being
[1:39:41] negative about his situation
[1:39:45] jesus said put up the sword
[1:39:48] you get that sword out you start cutting
[1:39:50] that's what's going to happen to you
[1:39:53] he didn't say
[1:39:54] he says you you
[1:39:57] you killed the sword you die
[1:39:59] with the sword
[1:40:02] we reap what we saw
[1:40:07] peter stand still
[1:40:12] he still couldn't accept
[1:40:14] that what was happening that god was
[1:40:16] still in control
[1:40:18] every one of us have been to this place
[1:40:20] now we're talking about a story that's
[1:40:21] in the bible but every one of us has
[1:40:23] been to this place
[1:40:25] and god wants us
[1:40:27] to really recognize him in present tense
[1:40:30] i'm telling that's the testimony that we
[1:40:32] need to have that's what we need to have
[1:40:34] day in and day out god is presently with
[1:40:36] me and the heart of the test
[1:40:39] the harder to stand
[1:40:42] don't be satisfied with how much you
[1:40:44] know god today there's more of god to
[1:40:46] know
[1:40:47] oh my wish i had so much
[1:40:50] to say there's going to be times
[1:40:53] that people are going to fly off the
[1:40:54] handle
[1:40:56] and you're going to want to draw that
[1:40:57] sword try to correct the situation put
[1:41:00] that person in their place and say this
[1:41:02] is the how it really went in daylight
[1:41:04] and they shouldn't have said this and
[1:41:05] they were wrong about that and you're
[1:41:07] you're going to pull that sword
[1:41:10] but you're out of position
[1:41:12] you're out of position you're not
[1:41:14] letting god be magnified in you because
[1:41:16] you're trying to be god of the situation
[1:41:21] god wants to be magnified not you he's
[1:41:23] not going to share his glory with you
[1:41:27] put your trust in him he's a present
[1:41:30] help in the time it's all about learning
[1:41:32] learning to be still learning to see god
[1:41:35] there
[1:41:36] it ain't you know
[1:41:37] a critic could stand up and say well
[1:41:39] i've had all these problems in my life
[1:41:41] this has happened to me and i never seen
[1:41:42] god
[1:41:44] well that's a true statement
[1:41:47] but did you believe that he was going to
[1:41:49] be there
[1:41:50] in your situation
[1:41:54] or did you just believe it before it
[1:41:55] happened but then after it happened
[1:41:58] because peter did say hey i'm
[1:42:01] i've forsaken everything for you i'll do
[1:42:03] whatever you tell me to do i'm yours
[1:42:07] but you've got to believe during the
[1:42:09] trial
[1:42:10] and and i'm telling you you don't just
[1:42:12] get that faith
[1:42:15] you got to spend time seeking the lord
[1:42:18] develop that relationship learn through
[1:42:21] the small things that you're going
[1:42:22] through to trust them the small what
[1:42:24] you're doing is you're developing the i
[1:42:27] trust you lord i trust you lord and
[1:42:29] before not you're going to have a harder
[1:42:30] thing though you cannot see how it's
[1:42:33] going to happen you know that you know
[1:42:36] that god is faithful to his word
[1:42:39] can i have just a little more time
[1:42:41] all right daniel chapter 3.
[1:42:47] oh
[1:42:49] daniel chapter 3. well verse 15. we know
[1:42:52] that
[1:42:53] i'm just going to read it try to fast
[1:42:54] this is the story of the three hebrew
[1:42:56] children
[1:42:57] now when they heard this sound they were
[1:43:00] supposed to bow their knees
[1:43:02] and they didn't right
[1:43:04] and in verse 16 shadrach meshach and
[1:43:06] abednego answered and said unto the king
[1:43:08] oh nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to
[1:43:11] answer thee in this manner
[1:43:13] if it be so our god whom we
[1:43:15] serve is able to deliver us from the
[1:43:18] burning fiery furnace and he will
[1:43:20] deliver us out of thine hand oh lord
[1:43:23] but if not it made known unto the o king
[1:43:26] that we will not serve thy gods nor
[1:43:29] worship the golden image with allah set
[1:43:31] up so here it is they came into this
[1:43:33] situation their face in a fiery furnace
[1:43:36] and they could not testify we do not
[1:43:38] know at this time whether god's going to
[1:43:40] deliver us from the furnace we don't
[1:43:42] know
[1:43:43] but i still know he's in control
[1:43:47] one thing is for sure i know he is going
[1:43:49] to deliver us from your hands if it's
[1:43:51] through death it's through death if it's
[1:43:53] if it's not through the uh if i gotta go
[1:43:56] through the first i'm not gonna die he's
[1:43:57] still gonna deliver us from you
[1:44:00] and that's exactly what happened
[1:44:04] you don't know your future you don't
[1:44:06] know what's going to happen when you're
[1:44:07] going through your trials and that's
[1:44:09] okay you don't need to be god of that
[1:44:12] right
[1:44:14] you just need to believe in the god that
[1:44:16] you serve that you are not going to
[1:44:18] flinch and go this way or go that way
[1:44:21] and let some little thing keep you from
[1:44:22] obeying the word of god
[1:44:26] you know nobody's going to you know as
[1:44:29] it were
[1:44:29] god's probably not going to arrange it
[1:44:31] to where there's some real furnace and
[1:44:33] you're going to
[1:44:34] be be faced to go in there in there no
[1:44:36] it's not going to happen like that it's
[1:44:38] going to be another trial amen
[1:44:41] amen
[1:44:42] and satan's going to say hey you know
[1:44:44] this is the easy way you don't have to
[1:44:46] do that
[1:44:48] and you got to stay with the word
[1:44:50] stay with the word
[1:44:53] regardless of what happens
[1:44:56] stand up like
[1:44:57] stars i want to look at meshech
[1:45:00] bendigo
[1:45:01] and shadrach
[1:45:03] when i look at them i look at them as
[1:45:05] stars
[1:45:07] not wandering stars floating here and
[1:45:09] there they knew their position with god
[1:45:14] they would not be moved
[1:45:17] and god honored that faith he
[1:45:20] god doesn't honor a a
[1:45:23] a
[1:45:23] double-mindedness unstableness one day
[1:45:26] i'll serve god in the next we just kind
[1:45:27] of forget about it you can't go there
[1:45:29] you got to take a stand for god and keep
[1:45:31] growing in christ keep seeing the
[1:45:33] present god growing in your life
[1:45:36] amen
[1:45:37] it's not about coming to church and
[1:45:39] feeling better when you leave
[1:45:42] because you know you honestly you could
[1:45:44] watch something bad
[1:45:48] and feel better in your flesh
[1:45:52] look at the wrong thing hear the wrong
[1:45:55] thing talk about the wrong thing
[1:45:57] rejoice in the wrong thing
[1:46:00] and feel better
[1:46:02] it's not feelings
[1:46:05] it's about a relationship with jesus
[1:46:06] christ
[1:46:09] lord help
[1:46:10] us all right
[1:46:13] i'm i just so you know i know it's late
[1:46:19] i just want to do
[1:46:20] one more if i could
[1:46:24] it's matthew chapter 8 turn with me
[1:46:26] there
[1:46:30] don't be satisfied with a god of history
[1:46:34] a god of the future know him presently
[1:46:39] remember when brother brandon said
[1:46:40] eliezer couldn't get rebecca to sit
[1:46:43] still long enough to dress her
[1:46:45] remember he said that
[1:46:47] everybody gets an idea they're going to
[1:46:48] do this they're going to do that they're
[1:46:49] going to hear it set still
[1:46:55] i love this story it's romans chapter
[1:46:57] eight a roman commander of a hundred men
[1:46:59] he was beseeching jesus for just one of
[1:47:02] his men he had a burden he had a hundred
[1:47:04] he didn't say i'll forget we'll just get
[1:47:05] the next one in you now fire him get
[1:47:07] another one in here he had a burden
[1:47:10] he loved his people
[1:47:13] verse 5 of matthew chapter 8. is that
[1:47:16] what i told you
[1:47:17] all right i told you everything and when
[1:47:18] jesus was entered into capernaum there
[1:47:21] came unto him a centurion beseeching him
[1:47:24] and saying unto saying lord
[1:47:26] my servant lieth at home sick of the
[1:47:29] palsy grievously that grievously
[1:47:31] tormented
[1:47:33] and jesus saith unto him
[1:47:36] i will come
[1:47:37] and heal him that should have been just
[1:47:40] i
[1:47:41] wonderful you know what
[1:47:45] who wouldn't want jesus to come to their
[1:47:47] house
[1:47:49] i mean like yeah are you kidding if he
[1:47:51] comes to my house he ain't going to
[1:47:53] anybody else's after church
[1:47:59] but he wasn't selfish
[1:48:01] he didn't think like that
[1:48:03] in fact he thought i'm unworthy
[1:48:08] and the centerian answered and said lord
[1:48:11] i am not worthy
[1:48:12] that thou should has come under my roof
[1:48:16] but speak the word only
[1:48:19] and my servant
[1:48:21] shall be healed
[1:48:22] now notice he came to church for one
[1:48:25] thing the word
[1:48:28] the word
[1:48:30] for i am a man now he goes to me this is
[1:48:33] the greatest revelation of a man that is
[1:48:37] in position and knows the importance of
[1:48:39] position
[1:48:41] from a man under authority having
[1:48:43] soldiers under me and i say to this man
[1:48:45] go and he goeth and to another come and
[1:48:47] he he cometh and to my servant do this
[1:48:50] and he do with it
[1:48:51] i mean this is the way we operate here
[1:48:53] in rome
[1:48:54] and jesus heard it
[1:48:56] and he marveled no any yeah
[1:49:01] he marveled excuse me and said to them
[1:49:03] that followed
[1:49:05] verily i say unto you i have not
[1:49:08] found
[1:49:10] so great faith no not
[1:49:13] in israel
[1:49:15] wow
[1:49:16] this must have been
[1:49:19] a very
[1:49:21] powerful thing that happened
[1:49:23] i mean we talk about we hear brothers
[1:49:25] come up here and they give testimonies
[1:49:26] of things that happen by faith
[1:49:29] and here jesus the author of faith
[1:49:32] is saying i have not found so great of
[1:49:34] faith
[1:49:35] it wasn't even a believer
[1:49:39] here was a man just that understood the
[1:49:41] power position
[1:49:44] he knew
[1:49:45] that god was
[1:49:47] over everything
[1:49:52] and that if he would just speak the word
[1:49:54] he
[1:49:55] he would believe it there wouldn't be no
[1:49:57] battle there wouldn't be no he just
[1:49:58] believe it
[1:49:59] because he understands that when he
[1:50:01] speaks to others they're under
[1:50:03] subjection they come they go they do
[1:50:09] it isn't like having a bunch of kids you
[1:50:11] tell them what to do and they don't
[1:50:12] listen
[1:50:13] i'm sorry that is not
[1:50:15] right
[1:50:18] god don't want a bunch of kids that
[1:50:19] don't listen to him
[1:50:21] if god says your place is in church
[1:50:23] you'd be in church
[1:50:26] whatever god says you do
[1:50:28] that's your position
[1:50:30] you dig into that message
[1:50:32] rapturing faith in there it tells us how
[1:50:35] to act what we should do
[1:50:37] don't make everything lighter make it
[1:50:39] heavier
[1:50:41] get closer to god
[1:50:43] i love this and i
[1:50:45] say unto you that
[1:50:46] many shall come from the east and west
[1:50:49] and shall sit
[1:50:50] down with abraham and isaac and jacob in
[1:50:52] the kingdom of heaven but the children
[1:50:54] of the kingdom shall be cast
[1:50:56] into
[1:50:58] outer darkness and there shall be
[1:50:59] weeping and gnashing of teeth
[1:51:06] if you're not going to see god in your
[1:51:08] present tense
[1:51:10] you could
[1:51:12] be heading right towards tribulation
[1:51:16] and not even recognize it
[1:51:23] this man was in his position
[1:51:26] we have a choice
[1:51:29] be still know that he's god that's your
[1:51:30] position
[1:51:33] no matter where you're at what's
[1:51:34] happening
[1:51:35] take this message and apply it this is
[1:51:37] my prayer and hope
[1:51:40] for you
[1:51:42] that you could come back
[1:51:44] to church and begin to testify that you
[1:51:47] see god in the middle of what you're
[1:51:49] going through
[1:51:51] don't wait till it's over
[1:51:53] right in the middle
[1:51:55] i say this don't make the mistake of
[1:51:58] predicting the future don't do that
[1:52:01] meshach didn't do that bendigo they

[1:52:05] but you still can't testify that god's
[1:52:08] going to deliver you
[1:52:10] amen to stand together
[1:52:31] remember
[1:52:32] naaman
[1:52:34] naaman
[1:52:36] got really bothered and upset because he
[1:52:39] was asked to go wash
[1:52:41] in a dirty
[1:52:43] river
[1:52:44] and thought he was
[1:52:46] he was he was more worthy
[1:52:49] and
[1:52:50] he
[1:52:51] failed to recognize god presently with
[1:52:54] him and there was that humble servant
[1:52:55] that pointed him back to the word hey
[1:52:58] the word said this just do it
[1:53:01] and he said the same he says if god
[1:53:03] would add if he would ask you the man of
[1:53:04] god would ask you did some great thing
[1:53:06] you probably would have did it right
[1:53:07] yeah because of recognition who doesn't
[1:53:09] want to do great things for recognition
[1:53:13] but it's when you can just what nobody
[1:53:15] knows obey the word of god no matter how
[1:53:17] humiliating it is
