seated amen well we have a special amen we haven't had a special in a while so it's always blessed to have a special amen bless you guys I uh I have this little devotional at home that I read sometimes and um it's written so they took it and they wrote it from the foxy book of Martyrs and they made like little devotionals for every day and I was reading it the other day and there's a little story in there that just caught my heart and so there was this young man that had given his heart to the Lord this was over in the Middle East and he had given his heart to the Lord and he he went out and he started witnessing everywhere for Christ and just wanted to Proclaim you know Christ to the world around him and he he told the Lord he said I I'll do anything for you I mean you've saved my life I'll do anything and he he just he was real strong and you know like passionate and so after about a few few months they threw him in jail and he he's sitting there in the jail cell and he's like having a conversation with the Lord and he's like Lord how could you do this to me you know I I said I would do anything for you and I would give my life and I would I'd be a witness for you and he just said how how could you allow this to happen and you know he's he's kind of complaining a little bit and like he just said he felt the Lord whisper to his heart these words and he said you said that you would do anything for me did you mean it and he thought about that you know he thought about what the Lord had spoke to him and took a few minutes and he he just bowed his head and he said I really mean it Lord I really mean it and he ended up being in prison for like 3 and a half years but he had given everything he could he ended up witnessing to the prison guards and you know ended up just being a a light to the people that were there but to me I just when I read that it just struck my heart because sometimes you know we tell things to the Lord and we don't always follow through and he he had an opportunity to follow through and he did it and it just me something to my heart just to keep God the focus and the center of of everything and just not to lose sight of that so um the Lord just kind of laid this song on my heart earlier tonight and I just wanted to sing it be a blessing to you seems I have a milon things to do everything gets plac in front of you but lord

Amen well God bless you this evening it's good to see the faithful gathered together today Amen in the house of the Lord um if you would turn with me in your Bibles to St John chapter three and brother Ron uh said don't ever try to separate God In Love I don't know where that came from I know where that came from when he said that and bind us with cords that can be not broken the love of God fill my way with love we want to talk about the gift of love this evening and trust that God would just add His blessings let's look to him in a word of prayer before we read the scripture our heavenly father we bow before you with Thanksgiving Lord we thank you for your faithfulness in our lives Lord Lord we thank you for remaining as as true as you are you do not change you cannot change you will not change and Lord we're thankful tonight that we can count on you to to carry us through Lord Lord to the very end it's our goal Lord Jesus to re to be with you in in heaven that's why we made the decision years ago Lord and we know that it's not a some quick decision but we've counted the cost and we've we're still here today Lord standing for you because you have stood for us and we thank you for your gift of love that you've given to us and now Lord we know that you've asked us to take this gift pass it on to others we ask you to come today Lord in the ministry of the word You' come today in the revealing of the word Lord that you would uh just take away anything from this time Lord that's been dedicated to you take any thoughts any doubts any fears anything that would try to separate us Lord from being able to receive from you ask that you just come now Lord remember those that Lord are not here today for some reason some sicknesses Lord thou knowest we just ask that Lord you would be with each and that you would meet their need Lord help them in this this time we thank you now for all this for we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen amen wonderful scripture here in St John chapter 3 verse 16 maybe perhaps the scripture that would have been read the most in all the Bible for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life amen God bless you you may be seated this was truly God's Gift of Love he didn't um he didn't create Adam and say Adam you give yourself thank you um he well number one there was nobody worthy after the fall to pay for our sins and he came himself an expression of how great his love was that he gave himself for us and I think sometimes when we don't think about this great gift that he gives us we can maybe a little bit take for granted or or or forget just how much God loves us but he did not uh do this and ever have a regret that he did it no matter how many people have um not got up in the morning to say thank you Lord for salvation thank you for for for loving me there are those that belong to him that have that uh gratefulness inside of them that given their life to express their Thanksgiving back to God you see here in Luke 2:1 just trying to get a little Foundation here of what happened on what most people call Christmas here and the angel said unto them fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people and this is the Angel making a declaration to the people an announcement to the People For unto you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the lord and that that is just a paradox in itself that um a baby is a savior when you think of a a savior that some is going to like save the country uh you you think of Great Men like Alexander or Napoleon or you know great leaders that are already established and they've got power to do things that they're really going to be the S they're the Savior but here it is this is a they're talking about a baby never been done in history that this baby is going to be the Savior amen and this shall be a sign unto you shall find the Babe wrapped in swalling clothes laying in the manger and suddenly after that was said there was with the angel a multitude of heavenly hostes praising God and saying glory to God in the highest and on Earth peace and Good Will toward men amen so all of Heaven knew what was going onen and they were all behind this great gift of of love that God had finally given to the world this gift of love wrapped up in a babe but we know that this babe in itself could not go to Calvary amen amen we're gonna have to start over because because we're going to start all over because no I'm just kidding because he wasn't even at the age of accountability he didn't even learn obedience by the things he suffered yet so he had to get to a place where he could freely give his life give himself as a gift at Calvary in John chapter 19 verse 28 and this Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished that the scripture might be fulfilled saith I thirst now there was set a vessel of vinegar and and there they filled a sponge with vinegar and put it upon his up and put it to his mouth and when Jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished and he bowed his head and he gave up the ghost so he gave his life right there at that moment there was no more uh life inside of him he gave his life freely really appreciate that special today Jesus the center of our life so here with this gift it was not just given in a in a baby but it was also given into life and so often when I know when I was growing up you know the only thing I thought about Christmas was a baby being born in a manger and somehow there was gifts they tied in the three wise men which was you know a couple years later right something like that but really the true gift was him giving of himself when he come to age of accountability just like us the greatest gift that we can give back to God is give our lives back to God God gave himself as a gift of love to us to say save us from Hell from our old nature from ourselves he saved us from ourselves he gave himself a gift of love to heal us to heal our minds to our our brokenhearted our our Spirits our souls to cover us from our iniquities and our transgression and to restore us back unto eternal life this was the gift of God's love to us and this gift was open to us and we all benefited in some ways we've all been blessed by God in various ways but the greatest gift of all that he could have given was giving himself his himself that we could be saved eternally because we could be healed we could even live to be 300 and that would be a great blessing more than other people we could say that would be a great blessing we could all be rich and be not just millionaires but literally be a billionaire and and God could Prosper Us in so many ways that we could have lots of family and lots of friends and and and be known by others around the world and and we could really have a good life but in reality there was nothing greater that God could do for any of us than to save our souls and we all here today are on the same level could be rejoicing the same that God has blessed us the same nothing else matters you don't need to look at other things now while God was here in Earth in the fullness of Jesus Christ he made a promise to us to each of us and that he would send back the same gift of love to dwell inside of us the same gift John 148 he makes this promise he says I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you we're taught that I a personal pronoun it's referring to the person who's speaking that once God Jesus Christ died on the cross he gave up the goals that he was coming back and that when he comes back he was going to comfort us and I'll tell you there's nothing more comforting in a heart of a man than to be filled with the love of Jesus Christ nothing nothing because it's the greatest love right you you there's such a there's you know when God God never picked and choose who he was going to save understand what I'm saying he said all that come to me I will no wise cast out he's no respector persons now we know only those that are his can come to him but the point that I'm trying to make is God's love is unconditional and that doesn't matter how big of a sinner we are doesn't matter what we've done in our past God's love God's love is superior over all that and now he's telling us here that he's going to come back he's going to come back and comfort us with the same love he's in verse 19 yet a little while and the world's is is not going to see me anymore but you're going to see me because I live you shall live also he's letting us know we're going to be just like him the same he says at that day you shall know that I'm in the father that you're in me and that I am in you that is that is a union right there and he that haveth my Commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved to my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him now there is where lies the key right there to receiving the gift of God it's in taking God's word and say I love this word enough to obey it and by doing that God gives you more of him which you cannot separate the love of God and the Holy Ghost you can't separate them they're the same Judas saith unto him not as scar Lord how is it that thou will manifest thyself unto us and not unto everybody else in the world because you know that right now they're looking at Jesus on the outside there's Jesus he performs a miracle uh Lazarus comes forth from the grave everybody sees it he feeds the five the multitude everybody sees it it's manifested and now Judas is saying how are you going to manifest that to us but not to them because it's going to be in the form of the Holy Ghost Inside and Jesus answered and said unto him if a man loves me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abold with him so this gift of love that God gave to the world he's saying I'm going to transer it into you you're going to have it now how many believe that Jesus Jesus is real then you must believe that this Same Spirit that was in Jesus if it lives in you it will be just as real inside of you it's not some Christmas gift under the tree the love of God is the is the life of God he promised that he would come and make us AB bold and we all want more of the a bold right key is be serious about having the word come in you cannot receive the word of God without receiving God now you can be blessed by the anointing of God you can be blessed by God even the our enemies are blessed by God he makes the sun to rise and the just and the unjust God can do that but we're talking about coming in and taking the Abode making the Abode living inside you you ever been blessed so blessed by God I mean you felt the anointing it was so real you were so happy you were either crying or you were laughing you were dancing and it wasn't like 24 hours later and you were upset and angry ever experienced that there's a difference between it being on the outside and being on the inside and when it's on the inside it it I'm not saying you don't ever make a mistake I would never say those words but what I am saying is it takes a hold and your life begins to manifest love towards everybody I I say when that happens the love of God comes in you just start loving everybody I'm G to say it again if you're not going to say more amens in order for the comforter to come in there is a condition to the Clause it's a conditional Clause a conditional promise and that is a man must love Jesus enough to keep his words we all want more of the love of God we want to be able to like when we get slapped on the face to love somebody we want to be to be so full of God that that no matter what happens what however we get spilt nothing but love comes out of us the answer is to love God enough to keep more of the word you know so many people just they they have this this thought process I'm just going to come to the altar I'm going to pray till I get the Holy Ghost I'm going have that anointing come down on me and I'm going to be filled with the Holy Ghost and they're not thinking about keeping the word they're just thinking that the Holy Ghost is something different than the word too many people think the Holy Ghost is different than the love of God I've got the I've got the Holy Ghost but I'm working on the love of God what are you going to do are you going to take God we know we you can't take God and and separate them into three person's Father Son and the Holy Ghost how are we going to take God and separate him from love because God is love God is love we can't separate that so our goal our goal ought to be is Lord let me be a Shining Light let me manifest the love of God acts um chapter 5:32 says Peter said we are his Witnesses of these things and so is the Holy Ghost two witnesses the disciples and the Holy Ghost whom God has given to them that obey him so this gift of love I mean God is so good he's just good to all his children you know if your child is being bad you're still going to love your child you may correct them may spank them you may be disappointed in their behavior but no matter what you're going to love them but God gives the Holy Ghost to them that obey him not to them that he loves there's a big difference in other words there's an expectation that God has of his children to mature to grow up to start saying Lord I love you enough to begin to obey you more and and then God says okay I'm going to give you more of my love you reciprocated love to me by obeying me that if you love me keep my Commandments he said you reciprocate that love back to God then God says I'm going to give you more of me amen and that's how you grow in the love of God it isn't like well I'm going to come to the altar a little bit longer I'm going to get you know sprayed on by the Holy Ghost a little bit more and I'm going to have a little bit more and you're not even thinking about how I can obey the word more I believe that God is so pleased keep his word that it needs to become our greatest interest you know there's so many people out there there're so-called uh Believers and churchgoers and you know they call themselves Christians and you know they they don't it doesn't matter to them if they obey the word they always got a reason to do their own will you understand what I'm saying and like God understands what where is that script where is that in the Bible so that's why Jesus said search the scriptures search the scriptures I'm so glad God a son a prophet to to make it straight to me so I can know for surely what God's going to accept or not and we know that he stays with his word that he's the same yesterday today and forever he's not going to deviate from this word Acts 2:38 Peter makes this has the keys here and he says repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost or we might say the gift of love because you're not going to get the don't tell me you've got the Holy Ghost but you don't love I will never believe you I will never believe you when you re receive the Holy Ghost you receive the love of God you can't split them up Peter gave us the key to open the gift of love that God gave God gave the gift of love in the Lord Jesus Christ in his son Jesus Christ and he he gave himself not just at the birth when the Angels announc it but on the cross and he made the promise before he went to the Cross I'm going to send forth the comforter which is me I'm going to come back in the form of the Holy Ghost I'm going to come inside of you and I'm going to love just like I love when I was walking and I'll just say it like this I know God is the same yesterday forever I know I'm not if I'm wanting more this is the this is the beautiful thing God is not forcing any anybody to be his wife it's a desire that you got to have I want to be or it doesn't matter and when you want to be then you're willing to follow whatever the Bible says you'll open the Bible and you'll say God speak to me speak to me Lord and when he speaks to you if you ever deci Lord I want to do that I want to follow that but then what you're doing is you're opening the door for the Lord to choose you cuz many are called but few are chosen and we got to understand we're in this process that we're proving whether we're chosen we're literally proving whether we're chosen you know where the devil wants to come and says you're predestinated doesn't matter what you do right because we know what predestination is it takes you it looks forward it brings you to the end right and if if you're just staring at that but you're you don't care about what's happening here that's a Doctrine from the Devil predestination is supposed to comfort us when we fall and we make a mistake get back up and you know you got a desired Haven but it's not meant for you to do whatever you want to do and expect that you're going to be there so we got the promise here we need to we need to repent we need to get baptized but you know he doesn't say anything about obeying the the Bible nothing in this statement but he gives the Holy Ghost to them that obey him Peter said the same words he just said it in a different place but it gives me a better understanding of what it means to repent I'm not just repenting of my past sins I'm not repenting of something I did in the past I'm repenting of a nature that only wanted to live selfishly for myself and if if I Repent of that that means my nature I want to start living for God of course I'm going to start obeying the word of of course I'm going to start following through what the word says because I repented the way that I was told to repent I'm so thankful that the word is clear the gift of the Holy Ghost is the gift of per perfect love there's a real Revelation in this statement the gift of the Holy Ghost is the gift of perfect love I left this up here for one reason you notice where the holy spirit is it's right in between brotherly kindness and and love right here you cannot separate perfect love and the Holy Ghost when brother brandom goes beyond the curtain of time and he's describing this feeling that he never felt before in this Arena where everybody was coming up God bless you my precious brother and hugging and it was just like there was no jealousy everything was just absolutely perfect in that scenario and he said what is this who this is these are this is your this is your family this is these are all brandom like no they're not brandom's these are your converts who you won who you won to Jesus you won them to Jesus what is this that I'm feeling this is the Holy Ghost this thing that you're feeling that you're calling perfect love it's the Holy Ghost it's exactly what you preached when you preach the word you're preaching the Holy Ghost when you preach the word you're preaching perfect love it's up to the it's up to the believer to say I love God so much that I'm going to obey that word and when you obey when you can prove that you can obey the word that is you showing God that you perfectly love him and I'm going to tell you like this when you've got perfect love you have no problem loving others none none you don't struggle in loving somebody God don't struggle in loving somebody well I'm struggling get more of the Holy Ghost I got the Holy Ghost listen friend all you're going to do is confuse yourself just keep it real simple God is hidden Simplicity if you want to be to love more then just get more of the god inside of you it's that simple we don't got the Holy Ghost and then you know when brother bam says whatever you do go get perfect love lay aside everything what do he was really saying is get the Holy Ghost get the part that you don't have is what he was saying he says you come up to the Altar and you're praying and you're seeking the Holy Ghost and you think you got it did he say he said you stay there a little bit longer he says and then you stay there a little bit longer and something more comes and you feel you got it you know what he said he said you stay there a little bit longer did because there's more for us and we would all love if God would just come and fill us like boom like just fill us but he really wants to see a relationship he wants to see some he wants us to be willing to die out to our will that love it's a love okay let's let's go let's go out to dinner brother Stan you and I are going out to dinner and uh what restaurant would you want to go to how many times do we e we want something different than the other person we're with okay and when that other person says it's okay I we can do what you want you feel loved when that person does that you feel they love you just by the mere fact that they're willing to give up their will to do to do yours and this is how children show their love to their parents by obeying them by giving up their will to obey them I'll just say it like this God sees that when you're willing to give up your will to obey the Bible That's you showing God that you love him and if you obey his word you keep his word then Jesus said the father and I will come inside of you and make our AB bold not just come and anoint the outside not just make you know but Abode I want him to abide he abides he abides I want them to abide in me that means I got to make a greater sacrifice than just making it to church paying my ti or or whatever there's got to be a love affair A Love Affair we're not we're not uh Church robots we're living creatures God is is marrying someone that loves him amen amen so the gift of the Holy Ghost is the gift of perfect love when we don't want to miss this the key to receiving more of God's love which is the Holy Ghost is to love God more first please catch what I'm saying you're not going to want to obey the word if you don't love him because what he add ask you to do hurts it hurts your nature just a simple a simple thought here uh somebody hit you on the face and you want to straighten them out right away and Jesus says turn the cheek somebody want you to to to go a uh a mile you go a mile and they say hey thanks can you go one more oh come on what you're using in me so in order to obey the word of God you literally got to hurt your flesh crucify the flesh now when you do that God says I'm GNA love you a little bit more I'm going to love you a little bit more why or I'm gonna I'm G to extinguish I'm going to give I'm going to manifest I'm going to reoc a little bit more of my love to you because you just showed love to me isn't that beautiful seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all other things will be added unto you if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abold with him 1 John chapter 4 1 John chapter 4 the gift of the Holy Ghost is perfect love the gift of of the Holy Ghost is the gift of perfect love can't separate them cannot separate them I think it's a good indication whether we got enough Holy Ghost I'm off for saying I've got the Holy Ghost because justification is a part of the Holy Ghost but you notice the children of Israel didn't have very much to do to come out of Egypt there wasn't much of a battle God took care of the enemy set them free they walked out with all the treasures that was justification came out of the world it by faith it is a part of the Holy Ghost but in the wilderness where they were tried for 40 years that's when God got grieved with the same people he brought out of Egypt he got grieved with them because he gave them all a chance to prove that they loved him and he says I will prove them to see if they will walk in my ways and many of them he said that he was not well pleased with many of them so I say today Saints we come to church we hear the word of God we don't want to to think we could take it or leave it there you know many people have come to church and left the church they came to the word they came when you come to the word you're coming to God Amen you're coming to to love you're coming to the you're coming to uh the Holy Spirit you're coming to perfect love and when you come and you do not you do not follow it that's why brother Braham said the evidence the true evidence that you got the Holy Ghost is you will receive the word for the hour because the Holy Spirit when he comes he leads and guides you into all truth and what is the truth we'll see here if I can get through this fast enough it is God's love being manifested in us that's what it is 1 John chapter 4 verse 8 says he that loveth not knoweth not God for God is love how many how many times people have they they believe they know God they got the Holy Ghost but they don't mind fighting they do not mind fighting don't mind arguing don't you go days go weeks go months don't want to talk don't want to shake hands but they got God it's not the god of the Bible the god of the Bible draws a bigger Circle I'm so glad God sent a prophet to tell us what the word means draw a bigger Circle love them anyways love them that persecute you that speak all manner of evil against you that speak ill of you love them love your enemy that is the same love that God gave us in Jesus Christ we all had such an evil nature in our own you know uh Ephesians 2 talks about if you want to pull that up Ephesians 2 I'll just read it off the screen verses 1 and two Ephesians chapter two verses and you have e quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins when ye when in uh in time past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience what's verse three say among whom also we all had our conversations in time past in the lust of the flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the Mind were by Nature the children of Wrath so when God came to us that's where who we were we were children or we did not really care about anything about our own will and so now God comes back in the power of the Holy Ghost and he fills our bodies we should be able to love others with the wrong nature I don't care if it's our our brother our sister our our mom our dad or our husband our wife uh you know Hypocrites in the church it doesn't matter we should be able to love them with the same love that God loved with 1 John chapter 4 verse 8 again he that loveth not knoweth not God for God is love in this was manifested the love of God towards us this was manif in this in this love was manifested the love of God towards us because that God sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him a pardon's not a pardon unless it's received a pardon Jesus died for the whole world that's why he said that um for God so love the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting how many people started out to love God but never went all the way right they ended up perishing they started out right so we must continue on to move forward with God that we might live through him herein is love not that we loved God no we had a nature that didn't I didn't even care about God I'm I didn't care enough I didn't care about God enough to want to obey him let me just say it like that there was a time in my life that the only thing I cared about was me here in is is love not that we love God but that he loved us and he sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins which he did beloved if God so loved us we ought also to love one another amen now for whatever reason people want to be loved by God have all their needs met to be blessed to take care of all their problems but they don't focus at all about their responsibility of God living inside of them to be able to love somebody else you know this thing of I'm going to love you Dennis if you love me I will forgive you if you forgive me I will lay down my life for you if you lay down your life for me that is not God that's you scratch my back I'll scratch your back brother brand says I'll scratch your back even if you don't scratch mine that's what the love of God is you know to me to be able to let somebody not be perfect and love them to me is one of the greatest Joys to see man manifested in my life to be able to love somebody when they're not loving you because your your old nature didn't want to do that your old Nature's I'm I'm not we were best friend we're not best friends now I'm moving on to somebody else but when you got God on the inside then we can love one another the way he loved us amen the gift of the Holy Ghost is the gift of perfect love whatever you do he said make sure you get perfect love whatever you do make sure you get perfect love so now imagine if brother bam said this after he got beyond the curtain of time what if he would have said whatever you do make sure you got the Holy Ghost ghost well some people would be saying you know I spoke in tongues I got the Holy Ghost some people say I shouted I danced I cast out Devils uh God came down so much and he just shook me to pieces I know I got the Holy Ghost because one time for like three weeks I couldn't even just do anything I was just in like I was in another dimension but all if he would have just said that make sure you get the Holy Ghost then all people would have been doing is looking at what their evidence was of the Holy Ghost you understand what I'm saying but when he said make sure you get perfect love well I can test that every day sister Lori I can test that every day whether I got the goods or not it's not a One-Shot deal where the Holy Ghost come down and anointed me or something special happened at the altar but I have a chance every day to prove I've got perfect love and I just love that he gave us that to know and Jesus said the same thing by this Same Love shall all men know you're my disciples that you ready were connected when you can love just like I loved amen I love the word the thought that God was sending his gift of love back to us is incredible it it wasn't just a little bit of his love and it wasn't just a lot more of our love hey I'm going to fill you with more human love you know what I mean you're going to be able to you know really give all your uh your time to work in for all these organizations that that give no he sent back himself and the more more that you can believe God is in you the more you can manifest the love of God to live the life you live to love the unlovable to let somebody hurt you and still be able to love them as if they didn't hurt you that's awesome that's awesome because what does Humanity do I'll never forget you did that Peter said Jesus just just come on you know we we we forsook everything to follow you are you just talking like seven times or what I say not seven times I say seven times 70 that's what the love of God would do how do I know that to be true how many times has God forgiven you this week so you're going to tell me that God in inside of you you will not forgive somebody else no God is the same yesterday for that's what the prophet came to tell us he is the same today in us not just the same on a platform that can heal amen not just so that he can do discernment but that he can actually live inside of a human being and live the same life that Christ lived because you know brother R didn't go around speaking Scrolls in existence 25 times one time and it was at God's will same with hady right at God's will it was enough to show us that the Life of Christ was behind the word that he was speaking and what is God really looking for in us to make it on the other side to go through raptured or what is he looking for for us be to perform a lot of Miracles no he wants to be able to say there's there's my bride who loves my word that's who I'm choosing that's who I'm choosing the one that loves my word St John chapter 13:31 now this is really this is really ironic because I have half the pages that I normally have when I have half the pages and and I'm still not getting through a quarter of the Pages St John 13:31 therefore when he was gone out Jesus said now is the son of man glorified and God is glorified in him this is or he's going to be crucified if God be glorified in him God shall also glorify him in himself and shall straightway glorify him little children yet a little while I am with you you seek me uh you shall seek me and as I said unto the Jews whether whether I go you cannot come so now I say unto you you can't come you can't come where I'm at you can't come where this love is at he says a new commandment I give unto you that you love one another as I have loved you that you also love one another and by this shall all men know you're my disciples if you have this love one for another now how if somebody went to any any place to work and they told you to do something that only okay I'm going to do this right now okay so brother s's going to go to trusted to tomorrow and he's going to work now I if if I give brother Stan a commandment I want you to make sure you pay all the bills well he's not on the check register he can't sign a check he would have to be given power to fulfill my command Jesus gives a command for us to love like he loved well we can't do it in oursel and we can't go where he's going he has to come and live inside of us for us to fulfill the will it's not good enough to say I've got God I've got the Holy Ghost get away from that start holding yourself accountable every day am I loving the way he loves can I forgive like he forgives can I not think evil the way he thinks evil that he doesn't think you know what I'm saying can I not think evil like the way God does not think evil the love of God thinketh no evil we spend time just letting things stir in our mind and say what we want to say talk about what we want to talk and then and we're still a Christian we're still Christlike we're holding ourselves to our standard instead of the Bible standard and this gift that God gave this gift of love that he gave he didn't give it he didn't give it just for himself he gave it so it could come and live inside of us he really wants to see us live like him can you imagine having a child bringing up their child and you tell them you don't put your shoes here this is what you do you take your plates here you take out the garbage you you vacuum you sweep you clean your room you do all these things you ask your children to do all these things do you does a parent really say well I don't really care if you do them or not no a parent wants to see that their children are just like them God wants to see us just like him to be able to love like he loves he wants about to look down and say this is my son my daughter in whom I'm well pleased I'm well pleased to dwell in them now understand that Jesus had the fullness of the godhead we only have a portion but I do believe that that if God told us to love one another like he did then I believe that God would make the means for us to do it he would never tell us to do something that he would not give us the means to do it God Is Not An unfair God he's not unjust which means it's there for our taking but God is wanting us to see us Get Down On Our Knees humble ourselves and say God I need more of you than what I have and it's through that process that you're showing your your heart to God and God says you just keep seeking me you shall seek me and you shall find me when you search for me with all your heart he gives you a word to obey and you leave church and you you leave church with a word that you didn't have when you came and you want to follow that word and you just do that service after service every time you read the Bible you have this hunger God I want to know you more I want to be like you and I'm telling you God will fill you with the portion of the Holy Ghost that will literally love everyone it's real it's real it's real it's real anybody that's has ever experienced that love you know it's real and you wouldn't trade it for a thing you wouldn't trade it for a thing because it is a power that you've never experienced now God has used us he's used us he's used our prayers to pray for others and and people have received whether it be healing or whatever that they were praying for through prayer and that is a wonderful feeling it really is but nothing can be compared nothing can be compared to when God is so strong inside of you that you literally can love your enemy Jesus said be ye perfect even as my Father in Heaven is perfect that that perfectness is is like Abraham coming to completion with the manifestation okay I'm willing to give up Isaac that was the same complete Pinnacle that he could get to that was called perfect love now I don't you know I don't believe is God's going to you know take all of us and everybody's going to get hit on the face like 13 times tomorrow to have to prove it I don't think it's going to work like that I don't think any we're going to get phone calls and we're going to be asked to go 16 miles for somebody but the case is we're going to going to have opportunities continuously to prove that we are loving like God loves and we want to make sure that we're able to pass that test and if we can't we find oursel coming short then you just get more sincere with God say God I need more of the Holy Ghost I need more of the Holy Ghost you're saying is I need more of the love of God now the whole the love of God is transferred to us through the power of the Holy Spirit Romans 5:5 says the love of God is shed abroad in our heart by the Holy Ghost which is given onto us so there you go you cannot have the Holy Ghost without having the love of God that word shed abroad means to pour forth to spill forth to gush out to pour out to run out so you got the Holy Ghost you know what's coming out the love of God right that's why you know people that say they got they got the Holy Ghost but they can't show love it don't mean a whole lot to me it don't it just doesn't it doesn't even draw my attention because that is not where Jesus said all men shall know you're my disciples it's through the power of being able to love the way that God loves so when we pour out unconditional love like God does does to others others are going to know we're going to be different than anyone else people are going to know that we're different we're a different class of people there's not there many people that you can just talk behind their back and they're still going to love you after they know about it there ain't too many people that can do that it's a truth you want to avoid them you want to get away you feel uncomfortable but you know love is the strongest power on the planet and it does not not scared of anything in fact perfect love casts out all fear it'll just cast it out what are we going to be afraid tribulation famine people leaving us losing somebody's friendship what shall separate us from the love of God nothing and all these things were more than conquerors nothing can separate from the love of God brother brandom described perfect love when he describes the situation with the bow with the maniac with the bees with the pum God's purpose for us is to be one with him in love and he says here he prayed for you and I here today in John 17:22 he says and the glory which thou Gest me I give them that they may be one even as we are one in in i in them and thou in me that they may be perfect that they may be made perfect in one see we're in the process of being made perfect we hear the word we receive it it becomes a part of us we go out and live it tomorrow something that we didn't live today that's the process of being made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou has sent me and has and has loved them as thou has loved me so God wants us to be just like him to be able to Manifest this love unconditionally and I'll say like this take take the people that you've had the hardest problem with and start working on loving them because it's easy to love those that love you don't the publicans right I mean I'll do you a favor you do me one do something for somebody that cannot do something for you do something for somebody who cannot love you the way you love them do something for that person that does not possess enough Holy Ghost to forgive you do something for them because in that they see God they don't see you they see God and that gives them a chance that gives them a chance to say God I want what I just seen manifested in front of me I'll tell you when love is been manifested to me it has literally melted me into a puddle Jesus said how be it when the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all Truth Now what is the truth he told us to love others the truth when he the spirit of truth will come he will lead and guide you in all truth well what is truth Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life he is the truth and what did truth say when truth comes into our heart he said love others as I have loved you love others as I have loved you John 21:15 I'm going to try to go through this real quick because Jesus is instructing Peter here how to give the gift of love and if you just really you know if you really get into this the end of the message right here then you know I'll let you out on time John Chap 21:15 and so when they had D Jesus saith to Simon this is now after Jesus had died uh Resurrected uh and Jesus saith to Simon Peter Simon son of Jonas lovest thou me more than these and he saith unto him yay Lord thou knowest that I love thee and he said unto him feed my Lambs in other words don't feed your own face don't stuff your own face don't worry about yourself it's not all about you church is not about you church is about you to find out where you're at with God but church is not just to be about you you're supposed to take what you have and part of the body helps the other the body that's like me saying you go home and you take a bath and shower and don't use anything to do it we're a body we're body Ministry so feed the Lambs love give yourself love like I have loved you what did Jesus do for three and a half years he fed his disciples he taught them and now it's all over and he's getting ready to go and he looks at Peter he says do you do you love me because it's all about love the whole thing is about love and he's talking to the the one who's the discerner of the thoughts and Tents of his heart and he says yes I know th know that I love you you don't even have to ask me something like that you already know he wasn't trying to figure out Peter's intelligence he was trying to get a point across if you think you love me then take your love and go help somebody go help somebody to me because they're my lamb they're in a condition that they need help because if they weren't in a condition to lead help then they could feed themselves right they would they would be strong enough to know that God's in the word and I'm going to get in the word and I'm going to just live the word but you know somebody that can't feed themselves they're not they're not strong enough to feed themselves they're weak we have a chance to prove our love to God by feeding the Lambs de feeding those that are are weaker he Sai to him again the second time Simon son of Jonas lovest thou me and he saith yay Lord thou knowest I love thee he and he saith unto him feed my sheep and he saith unto him the third time Simon son of Jonas lovest thou me can you imagine if somebody said something ask you the same question three times it would probably grieve you right if they were serious well it grieved Peter Peter was grieved because he said un him the third time lovest thou me for he said unto him Lord thou knowest all things thou knowest that I love thee and Jesus said unto him feed my sheep what a like he was so Peter was so interested in what he was interested in hey what's going to happen to John what's going to go on with him what's going to happen in his life tell me his future what is it to you Peter it's like none of your beeswax it's none of your business you love me we got a relationship it's between me and you feed my sheep I've called you to live for others to love others as I have loved you John 3:16 we know St John 316 and this is 1 John 3:16 this is to us how hereby perceive we the love of God because he laid down his life for us we ought to lay down our lives for one another this is the gift that God gave us the gift of love that God gave us he wants us to go give it to others May our season be filled with the true gift that God meant it to be which is his love and I know that it's just part of life to get involved in in in in giving is part of just showing your your love our our our our our our our human love we want our our kids and our family members and you know we you know we just we we we get a list Elizabeth sends us a list and all the things you know that the kids want and you know we want to make him happy right so we get them we don't get them things they don't want right I mean that's a wonderful thing but I'm talking about something that God gave himself his love to take that gift that God has given you and share it share it the way that he intended it to be shared not through not just through human uh capability but say God come into my heart feel me soul full of you that I just I can love like you and other others will able to see that you're still alive that you know they they may not recognize you in certain things in the in the in the reading of the Bible but maybe they'll see you in me because I'm loving just like you love let's Stand Together God bless you as your I just want to put the scripture on the board for the last scripture so you can see this in 2 Thessalonians 3:5 and the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and unto the patient waiting for Christ oh how beautiful that is how many wants more the love of God how many feels you need more Holy Spirit to manifest that love amen let's go to him in prayer and just believe believe that he's going to grant our hearts say our heavenly father we come to you you see all of our hands just lifted we want and we need and we long to have more of you inside of us to have so much of your love that we would never fear and we wouldn't worry about about getting heard or being used but that we could literally pray for those who despitefully use us pray with compassion for them Lord these things that we're we're Desiring to have more of you and Desiring to have more of the Holy Spirit more of your love more of you we know that this desire that we have is is a good desire but Lord we know to to see it manifested may require it will require us to to obey your word more to die out to the flesh more and to start putting into practice simple little things when the enemy might come to our minds and put thoughts in our our minds about somebody or something Lord may it be there in our heart that we love them that we just don't even let a thought entertain in our mind about them Lord as we as we love you in our mind we love you in our heart then when it comes time to be in front of those people Lord that we're better to show a genuine love that they can actually feel the love the fire from our love the realness of our love oh God we commit our souls to you we commit our our life to you and we We Trust You Lord that you bring to pass for your bride here for each one of us that
