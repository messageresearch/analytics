[40:42] except a corn of wheat fall into the
[40:45] ground and die it abideth alone but if
[40:47] it die it bringeth forth much
[40:50] fruit but we know Jesus is talking about
[40:53] Calvary
[40:55] here that he died and that because of
[40:59] his death the Holy Ghost could come upon
[41:01] us and we could bring forth the same
[41:03] life that went into the ground amen amen
[41:06] he that loveth his life shall lose it he
[41:11] that hateth his life in this world shall
[41:13] keep it unto life eternal so we have to
[41:17] be willing to also die to our
[41:21] flesh in order to bring forth the same
[41:24] fruit of God Amen and if any man serve
[41:27] me let him follow me and where I am
[41:31] there shall also my servant be any man
[41:35] serve me him will my father honor now is
[41:40] my soul troubled what shall I what shall
[41:43] I say father save me from this
[41:47] hour but for this cause came I unto this
[41:51] hour that's
[41:53] right father glorify thy name name then
[41:57] came there a voice from Heaven saying I
[42:01] have both glorified it and will glorify
[42:03] it again the people therefore that stood
[42:07] by and heard it said that it
[42:10] thundered and other said an angel spake
[42:14] to
[42:14] him and Jesus answered and said this
[42:17] voice came not because of
[42:20] me but for your
[42:22] sake I want you to think about that some
[42:25] thought I was a thunder some thought it
[42:27] was an
[42:29] angel and Jesus is saying they didn't
[42:32] hear and Jesus is saying this voice was
[42:34] for
[42:36] you now is the Judgment of this world
[42:41] now shall the prince of this world be
[42:43] cast out and I if I be lifted up from
[42:47] the earth will draw all men unto me amen
[42:52] God bless you you may be
[42:55] seated
[42:57] there are many ways that we can lift up
[43:01] Christ am we can
[43:03] sing We can praise His
[43:07] name and we should do that that's
[43:11] right the Bible says that we should do
[43:14] it continuously amen amen we can tell
[43:17] somebody about Jesus that's a way to
[43:20] lift him up we can preach a
[43:24] sermon like we're a temp to do this
[43:28] morning and that lifts up Jesus
[43:31] am we can defend the Gospel of Jesus
[43:35] Christ with our words that this is what
[43:37] we stand for this is the doctorine I
[43:41] believe brother brandom said in the
[43:43] message The Works that I do bear witness
[43:46] of me he says do you know I'd rather
[43:48] have you live me a sermon than preach me
[43:50] one
[43:52] right it'll be a better evidence that
[43:55] you're a Christian isn't that right he
[43:57] says a lived sermon and what are uh and
[44:04] what we are is what we live and what we
[44:06] do our actions show what we are so there
[44:11] is many ways we can lift up Christ and
[44:13] brother random here is just saying that
[44:16] it is much better to live a sermon than
[44:19] to speak one which honestly if you're
[44:22] not talking basically all of you have a
[44:25] better chance of of uh e exalting Christ
[44:29] without speaking than I am at this very
[44:34] moment brother Bram said in the message
[44:36] Hebrews chapter 6 a man is known by his
[44:40] works and whatever your life is you've
[44:44] heard the old story your life speaks so
[44:46] loud I can't even hear your
[44:48] words so whatever you are you are the
[44:52] life that you live shows what kind of
[44:54] spirit is in you and then you may
[44:57] impersonate the wrong thing or
[44:58] impersonate the right thing may I say
[45:01] you may impersonate a
[45:03] Christian but there will by and by come
[45:07] a time when the strain will be put on
[45:12] and it'll show what you are yes a chain
[45:17] is as strong as its weakest
[45:19] link and when Christ the son of God was
[45:23] put to the test it showed
[45:26] what he was sure when you're put to the
[45:29] test it'll prove what you are your life
[45:32] always reflects what's on the inside of
[45:34] you didn't Jesus say come and buy of me
[45:37] gold that's been tried of the fire he
[45:39] was tried he was put to the test
[45:43] yes the hardest way to lift up Christ is
[45:47] with the way that we live our
[45:49] lives life can be very difficult to
[45:52] handle but it's through these difficult
[45:55] times
[45:56] that we can be a most effective witness
[45:59] for Jesus Christ I'm afraid that if some
[46:03] people couldn't talk they wouldn't be
[46:06] there wouldn't be enough evidence
[46:07] against them that they were Christians
[46:09] that they were
[46:11] Christlike because too many people do
[46:13] not think that their life matters and
[46:17] all that really matters are the things
[46:19] that they say but it's actually just the
[46:23] opposite it's just the opposite
[46:28] amen lifting up Christ in this age with
[46:31] our lives it's the hardest thing to
[46:33] do we're living in the most deceptive
[46:36] age the lid has been lifted off hell
[46:39] demonic forces are penetrating our
[46:42] society evil is on a rampage and evil is
[46:46] multiplying faster than ever
[46:50] before Galatians 1 says that Jesus
[46:54] Christ gave himself for our sin sins
[46:56] that he might Deliver Us from this
[46:59] present evil world
[47:04] yes and Timothy said in the last days
[47:08] evil men and seducers shall wax worse
[47:12] and worse deceiving and being
[47:18] deceived it may be easy to say things
[47:22] about
[47:23] Christ but takes a lot of Labor to lift
[47:28] Christ up with our
[47:31] lives have you noticed that even evil it
[47:36] just seems like it's being forced in
[47:38] your
[47:39] face they're just forcing it on
[47:43] you it's harder and harder to lift up
[47:46] Christ with our lives when evil is
[47:49] present all around
[47:51] us but Jesus said if I be lifted up from
[47:55] all all the evil that's in the earth I
[47:58] will draw all men unto
[48:00] me so if we can labor to keep the Life
[48:03] of Christ lifted up then others have a
[48:05] chance they have a chance to be drawn
[48:08] but if if we keep making excuses well I
[48:12] I I blew up because you said this and
[48:14] because you did that and that's why I
[48:16] did this well you know how is Christ
[48:18] going to be magnified in our lives how
[48:23] is how how are we going to better how is
[48:25] Christ going to to draw the other
[48:28] person times when people try to lift up
[48:31] Jesus it seems like they're drawing men
[48:32] unto
[48:35] themselves I I say we can say Amen to
[48:37] the word but because it's true you know
[48:40] you people when they lift up Christ they
[48:42] also just say like this they also want
[48:44] to lift themselves
[48:46] up and and really what Jesus is wanting
[48:49] is us to lift up Christ
[48:51] only not both not
[48:54] together the Pharisees and the Sadducees
[48:57] they were good examples of this even the
[48:59] disciples when they were arguing who is
[49:01] the greatest among
[49:03] them these people in the church look for
[49:06] an audience to esteem themselves instead
[49:08] of Christ
[49:09] Alone whether brandom said it like this
[49:11] you give a cow enough rope he'll hang
[49:14] himself you don't need to hang him you
[49:18] don't need to do it he'll hang
[49:20] himself Our Lives speak louder than we
[49:24] realize
[49:27] John 10 verse
[49:29] 24 then came the Jews round about Jesus
[49:33] and said unto him how
[49:35] long does thou make us to
[49:38] doubt if thou be the Christ tell us
[49:44] plainly just tell us
[49:48] plainly they were wanting to be told
[49:51] plain words and Jesus pointed them to
[49:54] the life that he was living
[49:56] amen verse 25 Jesus answered them he
[49:59] says I told you I already told you
[50:02] plainly and you believe
[50:04] not the works that I do in my father's
[50:09] name they bear witness of me amen The
[50:12] Works that I do they bear witness of me
[50:15] it's why it's important to to really
[50:17] recognize the works of Christ in
[50:20] people's
[50:24] lives
[50:26] he just said' look at my
[50:28] life look how I where my my effort is
[50:32] being put my my toil my hard
[50:37] work am I lifting myself up or am I
[50:41] lifting up the
[50:43] father he said they bear witness of
[50:47] me in the message God is identified by
[50:50] his characteristics brother brandom
[50:52] identified these works here as his
[50:56] character are you with me now amen The
[50:59] Works of Christ is his
[51:02] character brother Brandon said in the
[51:04] message believe from the heart he says
[51:06] and any man is known his character is
[51:09] known by his
[51:11] Works no matter who he is his Works
[51:15] prove his
[51:17] character I if I didn't have this in my
[51:22] in my scriptures but if an if you could
[51:23] put these on the board Matthew CH 7
[51:26] verse
[51:30] 15 Jesus said Beware of false
[51:35] prophets which come to you in sheep's
[51:37] clothing and
[51:40] inwardly but inwardly they are raving
[51:44] wolves so here Jesus is pointing us to
[51:49] the inside character of a person and not
[51:52] to the outside what they're saying
[51:56] Amen to the inside amen and he says in
[52:00] verse 20 wherefore by their fruit you
[52:03] shall know them the fruit that comes
[52:07] from their life and then he goes on in
[52:11] the chapter to talk about not everybody
[52:13] that that
[52:14] says uh not everyone that
[52:18] says that they are of Christ if I could
[52:24] say it like that or that what they're
[52:26] doing is of Christ or what they uh what
[52:29] Christ told
[52:32] them it's not that
[52:36] clothing he said that everyone that does
[52:39] the will of God shall enter
[52:42] in well the will of God for each and
[52:45] every one of our Lives is to be filled
[52:48] with the Holy
[52:50] Ghost so full that we bear the fruit of
[52:54] the Holy Spirit amen you shall know them
[52:57] by their
[52:58] fruits and and and the description of
[53:01] the fruit of the Holy Ghost there's
[53:02] Galatians chapter
[53:04] 5 but the fruit of the
[53:08] spirit Galatians 5:22 but the fruit of
[53:11] the spirit is love he wants us to look
[53:14] at love joy peace longsuffering
[53:18] gentleness goodness Faith meekness
[53:20] Temperance against such there is no law
[53:23] well it's easy for me
[53:26] to love you when you're loving
[53:31] me but the minute you truly truly have
[53:35] something against me then it's going to
[53:38] then it shows how deep my love really is
[53:41] for
[53:42] you so these fruits are fruits that are
[53:45] seen in the middle of Trials and tests
[53:49] it's not something we we we show
[53:52] favoritism and well be kind and patient
[53:55] Meek to to my friend over here no we're
[53:57] we're talking about a fruit that is
[53:59] boring against our
[54:02] enemies it's true God Jesus is no
[54:05] respector persons God's no respector
[54:10] persons and they look at verse 24 and
[54:13] they that are Christ they have crucified
[54:17] the flesh with affections and the
[54:20] lust it's the only way you're going to
[54:22] get the fruit of the holy spirit is if
[54:23] you die out
[54:26] amen and if we live in the spirit let us
[54:29] also walk in the spirit let us not be
[54:34] desirous of vain Glory provoking one
[54:38] another envying one another I mean this
[54:41] is a fruit of the Flesh and Jesus said
[54:45] by their fruits you shall know them yes
[54:49] it just doesn't matter what people say
[54:52] it matters the spirit that they're
[54:54] projecting
[54:56] amen and there's a fruit that comes from
[55:00] that character is a man's true
[55:05] nature brother bam said it's the only
[55:07] thing that we take with us when we
[55:11] leave and character is made in the fiery
[55:14] furnace of our trials that's right so if
[55:18] I could say it like this if it's the
[55:19] only thing that we take with us when we
[55:23] leave you you can't take more of Jesus
[55:27] Christ with
[55:29] you than what you have
[55:32] now in other words we can't just well
[55:34] when I get to the other side I'm gonna
[55:36] be like Jesus no character is not a gift
[55:39] it won't be gifted on the other side
[55:43] amen character is a
[55:46] victory when you go into a trial and you
[55:49] choose to crucify your flesh and you
[55:52] choose to yield yourself to the holy ho
[55:55] ghost to the word of God to do what that
[55:57] word says to do in the middle of the
[55:58] trial that character will be granted to
[56:01] you because you is it became a victory
[56:04] you overcame your flesh to get it now
[56:07] that is the only character that you're
[56:09] taking with you when you leave amen so
[56:12] if you if you don't want to work on
[56:14] building character then you're going to
[56:16] have little character to take with you
[56:18] when you
[56:20] leave so it's
[56:23] important that we
[56:26] get as much character as we can use our
[56:29] time to develop character don't don't
[56:32] don't use our time to build our own
[56:35] kingdom down here but to to get this
[56:40] carnal nature overcomed and get the
[56:43] victory amen that that only God can give
[56:48] us through the holy spirit amen amen now
[56:51] God's character transpires in our life
[56:54] of how we handle situations how we react
[56:57] to things how we overcome
[57:01] ourselves sometimes it takes her a
[57:03] tremendous amount of effort to handle
[57:06] situations with the right
[57:09] Spirit it really
[57:11] does so I got some questions you know I
[57:14] like to have a sermon with questions
[57:18] questioners do we labor to esteem
[57:22] others because it's a labor isn't it
[57:26] or do we labor to esteem
[57:29] ourselves do we labor to live for others
[57:33] or
[57:34] ourself do we labor to cover our
[57:37] brothers and sisters faults or do we
[57:40] expose their
[57:45] wrongs are we willing to labor to go the
[57:48] second mile or to turn the
[57:51] cheek do we labor or or Endeavor to keep
[57:54] the the unity of the spirit in the bond
[57:57] of peace or do we just boldo our way
[57:59] through with what we're trying to
[58:02] do do we labor to love our
[58:06] enemy because it takes a labor to do it
[58:09] brother Pam says whatever you do get
[58:11] perfect love get to the place where you
[58:13] can love your enemy that takes a labor
[58:15] to do
[58:20] that and I'm afraid that we just so
[58:23] often take the easy path the broad
[58:26] way and just do all
[58:29] talking instead of
[58:31] living the
[58:34] life we have to labor if we're going to
[58:38] lift up
[58:41] Christ how we handle situations how we
[58:44] react to things that they're proving our
[58:46] character they bear witness of who we
[58:48] really are and Jesus said if I be lifted
[58:51] up from this evil world around us I will
[58:54] draw all men unto
[58:56] me if I can be lifted up
[58:59] during your test and your trials then
[59:04] people will see
[59:06] Christ
[59:07] because people want to see Christ in
[59:12] that can handle the the test right he
[59:14] said come by of me go tried in the fire
[59:18] we need to go through the trials and
[59:21] people need to see Christ exhibiting
[59:25] from our life in the middle of the trial
[59:27] not after the
[59:30] trial and not just before the
[59:33] trial but right in the middle of
[59:35] it that's where I
[59:38] want people to see Christ in
[59:41] me because then I
[59:44] know that people are going to be more
[59:46] interested and more drawn to Jesus
[59:49] Christ at the company I work at we make
[59:53] parts that sometimes have to be
[59:56] tested and they call for materials to be
[59:59] certified traced back to the
[1:00:01] manufacturer sometimes we've done Parts
[1:00:04] out of these materials that have
[1:00:06] paracity in them they got holes in them
[1:00:10] and
[1:00:11] they have not met the requirements
[1:00:14] that's
[1:00:16] needed we also make test fixtures and
[1:00:20] assemblies and we take a bunch of parts
[1:00:24] they get put together they're welded
[1:00:26] together and then that they're tested to
[1:00:28] see if they can take the
[1:00:30] pressure they'll sometimes use air to
[1:00:33] put inside these fix these these parts
[1:00:36] that are on the
[1:00:37] fixtures and if they're not strong
[1:00:41] enough when the pressure happens they
[1:00:43] will blow air will escape and they don't
[1:00:47] pass the
[1:00:49] test because they have to pass the test
[1:00:51] they're going on your
[1:00:53] car they're going on your car they have
[1:00:55] to pass the test brother bam said in the
[1:00:59] message the action to an
[1:01:01] action a reaction to an action he says
[1:01:04] and when you when you're put under a
[1:01:06] test when you're fixing to be used for
[1:01:09] God for a testimony I love the way he
[1:01:12] said
[1:01:13] that when you're fixing to be used for
[1:01:16] God for a testimony like the lady here
[1:01:19] in the wheelchair the man the little boy
[1:01:22] some of you out there maybe you're a
[1:01:24] Christian and wonder why you're put
[1:01:25] under the test God's fixing to use your
[1:01:30] testimony and he wants to see how you're
[1:01:33] going to
[1:01:39] react he puts the pressure on
[1:01:44] you he wants to see how you're going to
[1:01:46] react so he puts a pressure on you he
[1:01:48] says if you blow up well then he can't
[1:01:52] do nothing with
[1:01:57] you if you blow up he can't do nothing
[1:02:02] with you in other words you don't pass
[1:02:04] the test you can't get put on the car
[1:02:08] you go on the scrap pile
[1:02:11] yes he can't use that for a testimony it
[1:02:15] don't matter how much you know the Bible
[1:02:16] it doesn't matter no matter how much you
[1:02:19] speak it's all about actions you got to
[1:02:22] prove it amen
[1:02:26] if you blow up Christ where's the
[1:02:28] witness of Christ in
[1:02:33] that he's not lifted up when you blow up
[1:02:36] when you blow up you know who's lifted
[1:02:37] up you
[1:02:39] are you're so lifted up that you're
[1:02:41] going to
[1:02:43] prove what are you going to prove you're
[1:02:47] right who cares who cares you being
[1:02:51] right does not draw me to Christ
[1:02:56] it doesn't
[1:02:58] amen I need a spirit of meekness the
[1:03:01] Bible tells me to be drawn to
[1:03:08] Christ he can't do nothing with you but
[1:03:12] if you hold on and just stay in the
[1:03:15] tassi that's the witness God wants us to
[1:03:17] be shows that Christ is alive in you the
[1:03:21] power of Christ is in you amen
[1:03:26] when we labor to lift up the Life of
[1:03:28] Christ during our times of pressure then
[1:03:31] God is fixing to use your
[1:03:35] testimony God can draw others to him
[1:03:38] because they see Christ in you during a
[1:03:43] time of
[1:03:46] pressure you've heard the story that uh
[1:03:50] when you get a bunch of tea bags and I
[1:03:52] I'd have to say in our home we have more
[1:03:54] different types of tea bags than
[1:03:56] probably all of our homes put
[1:04:00] together we have so many different types
[1:04:02] of tea
[1:04:03] bags and if you lay all those tea bags
[1:04:06] out and you you can't tell the
[1:04:09] difference of
[1:04:10] them there's they look all the same but
[1:04:13] you put it in hot water and you taste it
[1:04:15] you'll know which which is
[1:04:20] which when we're put under a test it
[1:04:23] proves what fruit we're going to
[1:04:28] Bear brother brandom said in possessing
[1:04:31] the enemy's gate he said and that's the
[1:04:33] way it is with
[1:04:34] all the seed of God the Seed of
[1:04:38] Abraham God gives us the final test just
[1:04:42] before he gives us the promise and that
[1:04:44] final test to see how we'll react upon
[1:04:48] it and when he gave Abraham this test he
[1:04:51] found Abraham just as true as he was
[1:04:55] when he started now just think about
[1:04:57] this we sit here and we read about how
[1:05:02] you know Abraham was going to kill his
[1:05:04] only be his only
[1:05:07] son and God stayed his
[1:05:10] hand and God used that as a testimony
[1:05:14] for your and I
[1:05:15] faith that that was a he's a father of
[1:05:17] our faith and he he was right under the
[1:05:20] pressure and nobody nobody told him he
[1:05:23] was this is what's going to when you go
[1:05:24] to church and this no he was right there
[1:05:26] under the test just like
[1:05:28] Moses God gave him the stick and said by
[1:05:31] you know by this this stick you you
[1:05:33] you're going and get pharaoh and he he
[1:05:35] walked in there and all of a sudden
[1:05:37] Pharaoh's magicians their sticks threw
[1:05:40] down and they became snakes snakes well
[1:05:42] he wasn't told all
[1:05:47] that but when he trusted God in that
[1:05:49] moment of
[1:05:52] pressure we read that as a
[1:05:55] testimony as I was with Moses so shall I
[1:05:57] be with you amen so when you're put
[1:06:01] under the test and you're able to to to
[1:06:04] manifest Christ that is a testimony that
[1:06:07] other people can see Jesus now because
[1:06:11] we're living in a world where you got
[1:06:12] evil people saying oh yeah I'm a
[1:06:15] Christian oh I'm a believer I'm born
[1:06:19] again and it's just getting so
[1:06:23] prevalent
[1:06:26] false prophets lot of
[1:06:31] them it's easy to
[1:06:34] see when somebody misbehaves or acts
[1:06:38] wrong it's easy to
[1:06:39] identify that that's not
[1:06:45] right sometimes we can be so quick to
[1:06:48] judge and be critical give her unwanted
[1:06:51] opinions and ideas about the situation
[1:06:55] but what's really lacking is the
[1:06:57] manifestation of Christ in that during
[1:07:00] those times that's what's really
[1:07:02] lacking someone that can stand up and be
[1:07:05] Christ in that moment
[1:07:09] amen maybe the reason that God allows
[1:07:11] things to happen to us is to show us
[1:07:15] where we're really at we're not quite
[1:07:17] with him like we want to be
[1:07:21] amen do we have the the character of
[1:07:24] Christ to handle the situation do we
[1:07:26] have the character to manifest the
[1:07:29] word we all know what to
[1:07:32] do but we we don't for some reason that
[1:07:36] that Christ just doesn't come out
[1:07:38] because we're so we don't mortify the
[1:07:41] Deeds of our flesh we don't crucify our
[1:07:43] flesh we don't bring it under subjection
[1:07:45] and we let the nature of God take over
[1:07:47] because it's the nature of of of our own
[1:07:50] nature car nature take
[1:07:52] over
[1:07:55] and therefore it doesn't
[1:07:59] become a testimony that God can use it
[1:08:03] becomes another
[1:08:06] stain it just does it our
[1:08:09] words are not matching Our Testimony are
[1:08:13] you with
[1:08:14] me now notice if a situation isn't
[1:08:17] handled correctly it usually turns out
[1:08:20] worse doesn't
[1:08:21] it so we need to give us off answer to
[1:08:25] turn away the
[1:08:26] Wrath we need to we need someone
[1:08:29] spiritual to do
[1:08:31] restoring not just somebody that knows
[1:08:34] what's right or wrong but somebody that
[1:08:36] knows how to handle the
[1:08:38] situation we need the effectual fervent
[1:08:41] prayer of a righteous believer to Avail
[1:08:44] the will of God we just can't you know
[1:08:46] get by with well they should know better
[1:08:48] and you know I'll just pray for them no
[1:08:50] we need the effectual fervent prayer of
[1:08:52] a righteous man
[1:08:54] we need a person to walk in the spirit
[1:08:57] in order to not fulfill the lust of
[1:08:59] their
[1:09:00] flesh we need to have our conversation
[1:09:03] always with Grace coupled with
[1:09:06] fear that's the manifested word for the
[1:09:11] hour anybody can talk to
[1:09:17] talk sometimes I just feel like going
[1:09:19] like
[1:09:20] this you ever feel like doing that
[1:09:24] I I just I want to see it I've been told
[1:09:28] it so many times I just want to see
[1:09:33] it we need believers who are willing to
[1:09:36] labor to lift up it it why is it why is
[1:09:40] it so hard to just live the life when
[1:09:42] we're in the middle of a trial because
[1:09:45] it takes
[1:09:47] labor it takes an effort to subdue the
[1:09:50] Flesh and to bring it under subjection
[1:09:53] and to let let Christ be
[1:09:58] exalted there's no labor in
[1:10:01] talking there's doesn't take any
[1:10:04] effort it's cheap that's a good way of
[1:10:07] saying it words are
[1:10:10] cheap we need to labor to lift up the
[1:10:13] very Life of Christ in the middle of our
[1:10:15] trials to manifest that
[1:10:19] word this is what will subdue the enemy
[1:10:23] at that moment
[1:10:24] yes that's what will bring the situation
[1:10:27] to where it needs to be at that
[1:10:29] moment you notice how Jesus handled
[1:10:35] situations here Judas comes he chooses
[1:10:38] Judas Judas is with him all this time
[1:10:41] Judas goes to portray him he doesn't get
[1:10:44] all riled up he doesn't called
[1:10:49] out he didn't it what thou doest doest
[1:10:53] quickly
[1:10:54] the father was in
[1:10:56] control we got to understand who the
[1:10:59] head of the church is we got to
[1:11:01] understand the Holy Ghost is the head
[1:11:03] here we need to trust
[1:11:06] him if I be lifted up I'll draw a men
[1:11:09] unto me by this manifested love shall
[1:11:13] all disciples
[1:11:15] know shall shall all men know yet your
[1:11:17] my disciples if we just love when we
[1:11:20] want to love if we just love when it's
[1:11:22] easy for us to love people don't really
[1:11:25] see the love of
[1:11:27] God Amen Brother John I'll say Amen
[1:11:30] because because I believe that
[1:11:33] statement but when you can love your
[1:11:36] enemy when you can love when you don't
[1:11:38] feel like loving when you can love
[1:11:39] somebody that's done you harm It Is by
[1:11:42] that love manifested that other people
[1:11:45] will see that you're connected to
[1:11:48] God 1 John chapter
[1:11:51] 3:8 1 John CH 3:8 John says here he that
[1:11:55] commits sin is of the devil we can say
[1:11:58] Amen to that for the devil sin it from
[1:12:00] the beginning for this purpose the Son
[1:12:03] of
[1:12:04] God was
[1:12:07] manifested that he might destroy the
[1:12:11] works of the
[1:12:14] devil The Works of God destroy the works
[1:12:17] of the
[1:12:18] devil in my name they shall cast out
[1:12:22] devils brother bam says if you want to
[1:12:25] cast a devil out of your your your
[1:12:28] wife just love
[1:12:32] her give her some chocolates give her
[1:12:34] some
[1:12:37] flowers in other words be Christ to
[1:12:43] her you know love cast out more demons
[1:12:52] than
[1:12:57] we've got to manifest Christ Christ you
[1:13:00] can't put Christ in a
[1:13:03] box you can't put Christ in a
[1:13:07] box this is the way he's always going to
[1:13:11] react what matters is that he
[1:13:14] reacts and not that we
[1:13:18] react I say today we can destroy the
[1:13:20] works of the devil around us by
[1:13:23] manifesting Christ more in our
[1:13:26] lives we can be an effective
[1:13:29] Witness by yelding our life to Christ 1
[1:13:34] Peter chapter 2 verse one but we got to
[1:13:37] continue to die out 1 Peter chapter 2
[1:13:40] vers1 says wherefore laying
[1:13:44] aside all malice all Gile hypocrisies
[1:13:48] envies and all evil
[1:13:52] speaking
[1:13:55] wow I
[1:13:57] mean this has to be important to the
[1:14:00] believer you cannot skip this verse and
[1:14:04] then try to just talk about Jesus all
[1:14:06] the
[1:14:07] time you've got to lay these things
[1:14:11] aside look at as newborns as newborn
[1:14:15] babes Desiring the sin mirac of the
[1:14:17] world that ye may grow what into a new
[1:14:21] creature into the nature of God
[1:14:24] in into manifesting the word but you got
[1:14:27] to lay those things aside you got to be
[1:14:29] conscious I will not let my flesh I'm
[1:14:32] you've heard the old story I'm gonna
[1:14:33] bite my
[1:14:34] tongue I'm gonna bite my
[1:14:38] tongue hey if that's the only way you
[1:14:40] can start start with it but you've got
[1:14:43] to get to a place where that old nature
[1:14:47] cannot rise up and Christ has a chance
[1:14:49] to manifest perfect love in your
[1:14:52] situations
[1:14:55] a lot of times when something is wrong
[1:14:57] we go on the offense we become critical
[1:15:00] but I'll tell you what happens that that
[1:15:03] hurts our
[1:15:04] testimony we need to learn not to do
[1:15:07] that but to be patient and let God
[1:15:09] witness his life through Us 2
[1:15:11] Corinthians chapter 6:3 2 Corinthians
[1:15:14] chapter 6:3 just talking about each of
[1:15:17] us having a Ministry now
[1:15:19] right giving no offense in anything
[1:15:24] no
[1:15:25] offense we're called to defend the
[1:15:28] gospel not beat somebody up because they
[1:15:30] don't believe
[1:15:32] it but to defend it giving no offense in
[1:15:37] anything that the ministry be not blamed
[1:15:40] but in all things approving
[1:15:43] ourselves as the Ministers of God I'm
[1:15:47] going to I'm going to I we're going to
[1:15:49] talk about the fruit you shall know them
[1:15:51] by their fruits now in in much patience
[1:15:55] what do you need patience for H how many
[1:15:58] times have you said oh boy do I need
[1:16:02] patience with him or her or that
[1:16:03] situation my boss
[1:16:06] my it's in the
[1:16:08] trial that you say oh I need
[1:16:10] patience so you're approving your
[1:16:14] ministry in the trial Amen in much
[1:16:17] patience in afflictions in necessities
[1:16:21] and distresses in stripes imprisonments
[1:16:24] and turmoils and labors and watchings
[1:16:26] and
[1:16:29] fastings by pureness by knowledge by
[1:16:31] longsuffering by kindness by the Holy
[1:16:33] Ghost by Love unfeigned by the word of
[1:16:36] Truth by the power of God by the armor
[1:16:39] of righteousness on the right hand and
[1:16:40] on the left by Honor and
[1:16:43] dishonor by evil report and good report
[1:16:45] by as deceivers and yet true in other
[1:16:48] words it doesn't matter what anybody
[1:16:52] says hold a good
[1:16:56] report as unknown and yet well-known as
[1:17:00] dying and beholding we live as chasten
[1:17:03] and not killed as sorrowful yet you're
[1:17:05] always rejoicing as poor yet making many
[1:17:08] rich as having nothing and yet you
[1:17:10] possess God because you possess all
[1:17:13] things when you possess
[1:17:15] him so this is where we approve
[1:17:18] ourselves as a real Christian with a
[1:17:21] real Ministry when there's in other
[1:17:24] words until there's a real need don't
[1:17:26] even bother don't even bother just keep
[1:17:31] it I I always like you know brother
[1:17:34] Johnson used to
[1:17:37] say don't let it all out the
[1:17:41] stack keep it down keep the energy down
[1:17:45] for when the trial comes that you can
[1:17:47] still live the
[1:17:49] life and you ALS used to say also don't
[1:17:53] don't
[1:17:54] uh don't jump any higher than you can
[1:17:58] walk so these things are just pointing
[1:18:01] us through that we need to live the life
[1:18:05] in the middle of our trials yes if the
[1:18:08] Bible says don't let the sun go down
[1:18:10] upon your wrath what are you doing
[1:18:11] letting it go down upon your WTH and
[1:18:13] calling yourself a
[1:18:19] Christian I I don't mean to be I'm not
[1:18:21] trying to be gospel hard here I'm just
[1:18:25] I'm just I'm just saying don't make
[1:18:27] Christianity what you want make it what
[1:18:29] what it is make it what it
[1:18:33] is stay with the
[1:18:35] word that's what that's what God wants
[1:18:38] to witness from our lives the brand said
[1:18:41] in the message hidden life with Christ
[1:18:43] he says you know the best thing is to
[1:18:44] live a sermon instead of preach
[1:18:48] one it is the best
[1:18:51] thing all right second Corinthians
[1:18:53] chapter 3 I hope it's okay we're going
[1:18:54] to end with a number of scriptures
[1:18:57] here because the scriptures is why we
[1:19:00] came here did we not
[1:19:03] amen 2 Corinthians chapter 3:1 Do We
[1:19:06] Begin Again to commend
[1:19:10] ourselves Do We Begin
[1:19:13] Again to talk about
[1:19:17] ourselves or need we as other Epistles
[1:19:20] of commendation to you or let of
[1:19:23] combination from you do we need some a
[1:19:26] letter that somebody sent to you saying
[1:19:29] how good you
[1:19:33] are or you going to send us a letter
[1:19:36] speaking about how good you are and then
[1:19:38] we're going to read that is that what we
[1:19:41] need we don't need a formal statement of
[1:19:44] praise for someone who has done
[1:19:48] something
[1:19:50] admirable we don't need that these are
[1:19:53] questions we don't need
[1:19:57] that Paul said you are our
[1:20:01] epistle written in our hearts known and
[1:20:06] read of all men yes your very
[1:20:12] life is an epistle that people read how
[1:20:17] you handle things how you handle things
[1:20:20] shows oh when I was in the world before
[1:20:23] I came to Christ I was just like
[1:20:26] everybody else that I knew we did what
[1:20:29] we wanted to
[1:20:31] do we partied we drank we we swore we we
[1:20:36] talked about who was better than the
[1:20:37] other
[1:20:39] person I mean you name it we did it I'm
[1:20:42] sure what you did I did for the most
[1:20:45] part but we were in the world but when
[1:20:48] we come to Christ Our Life
[1:20:50] Changes we become Our Lives become a new
[1:20:55] book and so when people look at us and
[1:20:58] and and they say well why why don't you
[1:21:00] want to go to the party with why don't
[1:21:02] you want to drink why don't you want to
[1:21:03] smoke why don't you want to have some of
[1:21:05] this I I don't have a desire for that
[1:21:08] anymore I just I I don't want that and
[1:21:11] and and they see a change happening you
[1:21:16] don't even got to go out there and
[1:21:17] preach it all you got to say is no thank
[1:21:20] you and all of a sudden they know it
[1:21:22] amen
[1:21:23] see your life becomes a written epistle
[1:21:26] and I'll tell you it's easier to me it's
[1:21:29] easier to live the life and somebody
[1:21:32] that you you hardly
[1:21:35] know than somebody that you've known for
[1:21:37] 30
[1:21:39] years come on the longer you know
[1:21:43] somebody the more times that you've had
[1:21:48] to be in a trial with that person are
[1:21:50] you with me
[1:21:54] and and and really if you want to know
[1:21:56] how I'm doing go ask my
[1:22:00] wife there's some truth to
[1:22:05] that it's awful quiet in
[1:22:09] here our spouses see us under pressure
[1:22:12] more than
[1:22:14] anybody but next you you can go into
[1:22:18] your work of place and the people that
[1:22:20] you work with if you worked with them
[1:22:23] for many years then they've seen
[1:22:28] situations how you've handled
[1:22:32] situations you know I I'm okay with
[1:22:34] making tons of
[1:22:37] mistakes you you just got to have tons
[1:22:39] of I'm
[1:22:41] sorries that's
[1:22:43] all you make the wrongs right you move
[1:22:46] forward
[1:22:47] amen because when you make a mistake and
[1:22:50] you say I'm sorry that's a testimon Tony
[1:22:52] to what side you're on Amen it's a
[1:22:55] testimony that's that's Jesus said be
[1:22:58] zous and repent I'm just following but
[1:23:01] if you don't say
[1:23:02] sorry and you just keep
[1:23:05] going well your your your life is a
[1:23:08] different
[1:23:10] book all right verse three for as much
[1:23:13] as ye are manifestly declared to be the
[1:23:17] Epistle of Christ ministered by US
[1:23:22] Written not with ink but with the spirit
[1:23:24] of the Living God not in tables of stone
[1:23:29] but in fleshly tables of the heart and
[1:23:32] such have we through Christ to godward
[1:23:35] not that we are sufficient of ourselves
[1:23:37] to think anything of ourselves but our
[1:23:39] sufficiency is of
[1:23:41] God who also have made us able Ministers
[1:23:46] of the New Testament not of the latter
[1:23:48] se but of the
[1:23:51] spirit for the letter kth but the spirit
[1:23:54] giveth
[1:23:55] life how many times you've been so mad
[1:23:58] that you quoted somebody a scripture to
[1:24:00] hurt
[1:24:03] them yeah yeah see the letter will do
[1:24:07] that but not the
[1:24:09] spirit the spirit of Christ will never
[1:24:12] do
[1:24:13] that it won't do
[1:24:18] that because God is the only one that's
[1:24:22] worthy to judge
[1:24:25] anybody that's not our job it's his job
[1:24:29] all right 2 Corinthians chapter 4 this
[1:24:31] is a good good second Corinthians here
[1:24:33] is good to see the manifestation of our
[1:24:36] our our our lives in the ministry that
[1:24:39] God has given us therefore seeing we
[1:24:41] have this ministry 2 Corinthians 4:1 we
[1:24:44] have a ministry that's not offensive
[1:24:48] it's not of ourselves it's it's Christ
[1:24:53] we have received Mercy as we have
[1:24:56] received Mercy we faint not but we have
[1:25:01] renounced the hidden things of
[1:25:05] dishonesty not walking in
[1:25:08] craftiness handling the word of God
[1:25:11] deceitfully but by
[1:25:13] manifestation now of the truth
[1:25:17] commending ourselves to Every Man's
[1:25:21] conscience
[1:25:22] in the sight of God yes so you know what
[1:25:26] this is this just diffuses any kind of
[1:25:30] blowup you can't blow
[1:25:32] up and and and and and in another man's
[1:25:36] conscience they're going to have a good
[1:25:38] testimony about you can you say Amen to
[1:25:41] that this is this is not the if if you
[1:25:46] if if you it was just you guys here I'd
[1:25:47] have like a different different service
[1:25:49] this morning this is this is uh this
[1:25:52] this is
[1:25:53] for this is for us that know better and
[1:25:56] need to be trying
[1:25:57] [Laughter]
[1:26:00] harder but it's the word it's the word
[1:26:03] amen so if we want to have
[1:26:08] a be good in someone else's conscience
[1:26:12] we need to to to to manifest the truth
[1:26:16] right to manifest the
[1:26:18] truth
[1:26:19] because it's not just speaking the truth
[1:26:22] but speaking the truth in love right but
[1:26:25] if our gospel be hid it's hid to them
[1:26:27] that are lost a lot of people are
[1:26:30] lost in whom the God of this world have
[1:26:33] blinded the minds of them which believe
[1:26:35] not lest the light of the Glorious
[1:26:38] gospel of Christ who's in the image of
[1:26:39] God should shine unto them amen for we
[1:26:43] preach not
[1:26:45] ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord and
[1:26:49] ourselves your servants for jesus' sake
[1:26:54] amen you know if if something is wrong
[1:26:56] make yourself a servant to that
[1:27:00] person make yourself a servant go help
[1:27:04] that situation
[1:27:06] amen for God who commanded the light to
[1:27:10] shine out of Darkness has shined in our
[1:27:13] hearts to shine out Amen to give the
[1:27:16] light of the knowledge of the glory of
[1:27:18] God in the face of Jesus Christ so this
[1:27:22] light that's inside of us now we have to
[1:27:25] labor to get the flesh out of the way so
[1:27:28] we can lift up Christ
[1:27:30] amen but we have this treasure in earn
[1:27:34] vessels that the Excellency of the power
[1:27:37] it may be of God and not of
[1:27:40] ourselves we are troubled on every side
[1:27:43] we should be to all relate to these
[1:27:45] scriptures here for we are troubled on
[1:27:46] every side yet not distressed we are
[1:27:50] perplexed but not in despair
[1:27:52] we're persecuted but we're not forsaken
[1:27:55] we're cast down but we're not
[1:27:57] destroyed in other words things are
[1:27:59] happening trials are happening in our
[1:28:02] life but you know what we're always
[1:28:06] bearing about in the body the dying of
[1:28:10] the Lord
[1:28:11] Jesus that the life also of Jesus might
[1:28:13] be made manifest in our bodies for we
[1:28:16] which live are always delivered unto the
[1:28:18] death of jesus' sake that the life also
[1:28:21] of Jesus Jus might be made manifested in
[1:28:23] our mortal flesh in other words if a
[1:28:25] corn of wheat fall into the ground it it
[1:28:28] if it don't die it it abides alone but
[1:28:31] if it dies right there it dies to its
[1:28:33] nature its will then it'll Blossom up
[1:28:38] and we can become life to one another if
[1:28:40] I be lifted up I'll draw a man unto me
[1:28:43] but we've got to be willing to die out
[1:28:45] in order to lift up Jesus Christ it
[1:28:48] takes a labor a labor it's not easy it's
[1:28:52] not a
[1:28:54] gift I think there's too many too many
[1:28:56] people out there that that think that
[1:28:58] you know this living for Jesus is so
[1:29:00] easy it's it's a gift no get put under
[1:29:02] the trial and see how you
[1:29:04] react see if you follow the scriptures
[1:29:06] and then you'll really learn how hard it
[1:29:09] is to
[1:29:11] live 1
[1:29:13] Timothy chapter 6 how we doing we we're
[1:29:17] doing we're doing like we normally do
[1:29:20] which means we got to hurry
[1:29:25] amen 1 Timothy chapter 6: 11 but thou oh
[1:29:29] man flee these things flee the the
[1:29:33] things of the flesh okay flee them and
[1:29:36] follow after righteousness godliness
[1:29:40] Faith love patience
[1:29:42] meekness fight the good fight of Faith
[1:29:45] lay hold on eternal life whereinto Thou
[1:29:49] Art also called and has look at
[1:29:53] professed a good profession before many
[1:29:59] witnesses that's that's the desire I
[1:30:02] have right there to have a good
[1:30:04] profession among many witnesses I give
[1:30:08] the charge in the sight of God who quith
[1:30:10] all things and before Jesus Christ
[1:30:13] who uh punches pilot witness a good
[1:30:19] confession think about it here was was
[1:30:23] Jesus and Jesus he didn't open his mouth
[1:30:27] he didn't
[1:30:28] just you know talk back and talk about
[1:30:32] how great he was and how bad pilot was
[1:30:36] no he witness he he he he was a good
[1:30:40] witness for Pontius
[1:30:42] Pilate a and so he had a good confession
[1:30:46] he said I find no fault in him that's
[1:30:49] what people need to see when we're in a
[1:30:51] trial when things are happening and
[1:30:53] you're acting like
[1:30:55] Christ don't just say well I'm right I'm
[1:30:57] right I know that I'm right as if that's
[1:30:59] a good
[1:31:04] witness a good witness doesn't go out of
[1:31:08] the the pages of this book that's what a
[1:31:11] good witness
[1:31:12] does well brother John I would never rob
[1:31:16] a bank like you
[1:31:17] did okay maybe you wouldn't rob a bank
[1:31:21] like I would
[1:31:22] or did but I really didn't I'm just
[1:31:24] saying I
[1:31:26] did but what about the way you're
[1:31:33] acting well I'm mad I'm
[1:31:39] upset
[1:31:40] what what about giving that to
[1:31:45] Jesus what about letting him be a
[1:31:47] witness in your
[1:31:50] life
[1:31:53] now I know this message hurts each and
[1:31:58] every one of
[1:31:59] us it hurts me just as much as it hurts
[1:32:03] you but you know you
[1:32:08] know this is not spoken because of
[1:32:13] you it's because Christ wants us to use
[1:32:16] use us for a testimony yes he wants to
[1:32:20] use us for a testim ony that things are
[1:32:23] going to happen in our church things are
[1:32:24] going to happen in our home things are
[1:32:26] going to happen in our work things are
[1:32:28] going to happen amongst
[1:32:29] us and we've got to be a good witness we
[1:32:33] got to we got to be such a good witness
[1:32:35] that God can use it for a
[1:32:39] testimony and sometimes your
[1:32:42] patience just your
[1:32:44] patience is all the testimony that God
[1:32:47] wants to use in
[1:32:50] that are you with me amen that thou keep
[1:32:54] this commandment so this commandment
[1:32:57] about fighting the good fight of faith
[1:33:00] and and keep a good con profession a
[1:33:03] good a good a good confession a good
[1:33:05] witness that thou keep this commandment
[1:33:08] look at this without
[1:33:11] spot unrebuked
[1:33:13] until when until the next trial until
[1:33:18] the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:33:20] amen
[1:33:24] all right First Peter chapter 2:
[1:33:31] 19 now how many wish you would have just
[1:33:33] stayed home not came to church this
[1:33:36] morning
[1:33:40] no okay great we're on the right track
[1:33:44] then 1 Peter chapter 219 that was not
[1:33:48] meant to be a a serious question and I
[1:33:53] I know this is could be a little bit I
[1:33:56] think we need this to to for us to be a
[1:33:58] better witness I do I and I do believe
[1:34:01] with all my heart that God is in this
[1:34:03] message I I do with all my heart I
[1:34:06] believe as him one
[1:34:09] 100% second 1 Peter chapter 2: 19 just
[1:34:14] looking at this witness that that Jesus
[1:34:16] Christ was he's our example for this is
[1:34:18] thankworthy if a man for ience towards
[1:34:22] God he
[1:34:24] endures grief
[1:34:27] suffering
[1:34:31] wrongfully this is thankworthy in other
[1:34:34] words good
[1:34:37] job God looks upon you with a smile
[1:34:41] because you went through
[1:34:45] something you endured
[1:34:48] it without saying you're wrong and I'm
[1:34:51] right
[1:34:53] right amen amen for what glory is it
[1:34:58] when you're buffeted for your faults you
[1:35:00] shall take it patiently what glory is
[1:35:04] it but if when you do well and you
[1:35:08] suffer for
[1:35:09] it you take it patiently this is the
[1:35:15] testimony that God can
[1:35:17] use this is acceptable with God God's
[1:35:21] fixing to use you as a
[1:35:24] testimony for
[1:35:26] even here onto were you you were called
[1:35:30] you were called to get this testimony
[1:35:32] your calling is to get this kind of
[1:35:34] testimony you were called out of sin to
[1:35:38] to get this testimony that Jesus Christ
[1:35:41] is
[1:35:42] alive because Christ also suffered for
[1:35:45] us leaving us an example that we should
[1:35:49] follow his steps
[1:35:52] not just say oh yeah I see the example
[1:35:55] that Jesus did that's was a good
[1:35:58] example or I see the example that Jesus
[1:36:02] did I think you should do
[1:36:04] that but there's the example I need to
[1:36:08] do that
[1:36:09] amen that's what I'm called to I'm
[1:36:12] called to follow that
[1:36:18] example who did know
[1:36:22] sin neither
[1:36:25] guile found in his
[1:36:28] mouth you know sometimes we just say the
[1:36:30] wrong
[1:36:31] things we say things that we shouldn't
[1:36:35] say instead of covering somebody's sin
[1:36:38] we're bringing it out in the
[1:36:40] open that is not the example that Christ
[1:36:46] gave who when he was
[1:36:49] reviled he re vowed not
[1:36:53] again in other words he just closed his
[1:36:55] mouth when he suffered he didn't
[1:37:00] threaten he didn't say you just wait I'm
[1:37:03] not going to shake your hand I'm not
[1:37:04] going to talk to you I'm gonna give you
[1:37:06] the this that
[1:37:10] treatment no it just wasn't even in him
[1:37:12] there was no drama in Jesus
[1:37:14] Christ but he committed himself to him
[1:37:19] that judgeth righteously
[1:37:22] I I just love this at the same time this
[1:37:26] was all happening all this pressure was
[1:37:29] being put on
[1:37:31] Jesus they were pulling his beard
[1:37:33] putting the crown on his head they were
[1:37:35] they were mocking him he was up on the
[1:37:38] cross and they were taunting him well
[1:37:40] you know he saved others he can't save
[1:37:42] himself and if he's R of God then come
[1:37:44] off the cross and all this pressure was
[1:37:46] being put on
[1:37:50] him and he kept you and me you and I in
[1:37:55] his his mind for the joy that was set
[1:37:57] before me endured the
[1:37:59] cross who who his own self bear our sins
[1:38:04] in his own body on the
[1:38:06] tree that we being dead to sin should
[1:38:09] live unto righteousness by whose Stripes
[1:38:12] ye are healed for you were as sheep
[1:38:15] going astray but now you return unto the
[1:38:18] shepherd and Bishop of your souls
[1:38:21] so now here this corn of wheat it goes
[1:38:23] into the ground and it dies at
[1:38:27] Calvary and now it comes back on the day
[1:38:29] of
[1:38:30] Pentecost licks of fire and it goes on
[1:38:35] everybody and they're filled with the
[1:38:37] Holy Ghost and they get baptized and all
[1:38:39] a sudden their nature starts changing
[1:38:41] and now it comes down to our age the
[1:38:43] last age before the coming of the
[1:38:46] Lord we've got to look exactly like the
[1:38:49] first wave sheath amen we've got to be
[1:38:52] in His image and it's not about head
[1:38:55] knowledge it's not about how much we
[1:38:57] know it's about what we're living in the
[1:38:59] middle of our trials we've got to see
[1:39:01] Jesus Christ
[1:39:03] manifested if we don't get that part
[1:39:06] we've got to get more of the Holy Ghost
[1:39:08] that's just all there is to
[1:39:14] it I don't want just enough Holy Ghost
[1:39:16] to condemn me I want to have enough Holy
[1:39:19] Ghost to get me through the trial and
[1:39:21] still representing Jesus
[1:39:25] Christ the Bible says because he laid
[1:39:27] down his life we ought to lay down our
[1:39:30] lives and the message be certain of
[1:39:34] God B says you know he loves to test
[1:39:38] us he loves to see the reaction of your
[1:39:42] faith amen did you know that God likes
[1:39:45] to see how you're going to
[1:39:46] react when you say oh Lord I believe you
[1:39:50] th my My
[1:39:51] Savior I believe that you're healer I
[1:39:55] believe you're the one who gives the
[1:39:56] Holy Ghost and the things that I'm
[1:39:58] requiring and you are the one that gives
[1:40:01] that and when you confess all your sins
[1:40:05] and promise God that you'll do it if
[1:40:08] he'll if he'll let you get
[1:40:11] well and then because you it don't
[1:40:14] happen you run off like a coward
[1:40:18] somewhere he said God can't use
[1:40:22] that he says there's no way for him to
[1:40:24] use that there's no way for him to
[1:40:27] answer you because he only Answers by
[1:40:32] faith then all of a sudden you go away
[1:40:35] and he can't answer but real true Faith
[1:40:39] stands there being sure that God is be
[1:40:42] certain that he is saying when we're in
[1:40:46] the middle of a
[1:40:47] trial and things are not the way they
[1:40:51] should
[1:40:52] be the need is really the same as if we
[1:40:56] were sick and we were wanting
[1:40:58] healing or we're wanting the holy ghost
[1:41:00] or we're wanting to be saved and that is
[1:41:03] we we're needing God to come in on the
[1:41:05] scene and meet the need amen it's the
[1:41:09] same so it requires faith when we're in
[1:41:11] Trials that's when you really shows what
[1:41:13] faith we
[1:41:17] have so say labor labor to die out to
[1:41:23] lift up
[1:41:24] Jesus when there's a trial don't stand
[1:41:27] up to the podium and say this is what I
[1:41:29] think you should
[1:41:33] do get over there get on your knees amen
[1:41:37] and start serving because that's what
[1:41:39] Christ
[1:41:41] did let them see Jesus
[1:41:44] Christ sometimes you just got
[1:41:48] to be patient be be
[1:41:51] patient and trust and
[1:41:55] love God will see us through I believe
[1:41:59] that all right we're going to do one
[1:42:02] more even though I have three
[1:42:05] more amen let's stand together in 1
[1:42:09] Peter chapter 3:8 finally be ye all of
[1:42:13] One mind having compassion one of
[1:42:16] another love as Brethren be pitiful be
[1:42:21] courteous not rendering evil for evil or
[1:42:24] railing for railing but on the
[1:42:28] contr blessing knowing that there unto
[1:42:33] there
[1:42:33] unto that I'm sorry knowing that ye are
[1:42:38] ye
[1:42:43] are you same as we heard in the last
[1:42:46] scripture are called that you should
[1:42:48] inherit a blessing so you can't get the
[1:42:52] blessing if you're just railing for
[1:42:54] railing evil for
[1:42:56] evil for he that will love life and see
[1:43:00] good
[1:43:01] days let him reframe his
[1:43:04] tongue from evil and his lips that they
[1:43:09] speak no
[1:43:11] Gile let him excute evil and do good and
[1:43:16] let him seek peace and ensue it for the
[1:43:20] eyes of the Lord are over the righteous
[1:43:22] and his ears are open unto their prayers
[1:43:25] but the face of the Lord is against them
[1:43:27] that do
[1:43:30] contrary see who it is that will harm
[1:43:32] you if you be followers of them that are
[1:43:35] good when there's things that are going
[1:43:36] on somebody says something that's not
[1:43:38] right or something happens look you
[1:43:40] don't have to worry about anything
[1:43:41] that's going to harm you because you're
[1:43:43] a follower of that which is good there's
[1:43:46] a way to handle
[1:43:49] things
[1:43:51] in the
[1:43:53] scriptures that people can see yet that
[1:43:56] was Jesus Christ there's like no doubt
[1:43:59] that that was the Lord now of course I'm
[1:44:02] not saying everybody in the world's
[1:44:04] going to jump on your bang way because
[1:44:06] Jesus handled everything right and they
[1:44:08] still called him Bea they still call him
[1:44:10] a
[1:44:11] devil but I I'm
[1:44:14] saying those that
[1:44:18] are are Christians and and those have
[1:44:21] the right spirit and those that maybe
[1:44:22] don't have the wrong the the right
[1:44:24] Spirit at the moment have a wrong Spirit
[1:44:25] when they get the right Spirit they will
[1:44:27] see it they will they
[1:44:33] will I said that was my my last
[1:44:35] scripture and I'm sicking with that but
[1:44:37] I got one more
[1:44:39] quote it's real short brother B says
[1:44:42] what think think ye of Christ he said
[1:44:44] and I said now I won't argue because the
[1:44:48] scriptures are not to not to argue he
[1:44:51] said they are to be lived the scriptures
[1:44:54] are to be lived you live me a sermon
[1:44:56] that's the best thing I'd rather that
[1:44:59] you
[1:45:00] lived I'd rather see one live than I
[1:45:03] would to hear one preached wouldn't you
[1:45:06] live a sermon your written Epistles read
[1:45:11] of all men
[1:45:13] amen praise the Lord I so appreciate the
[1:45:18] instructions that God gives us in his
[1:45:21] word of how we ought to exalt the Lord
[1:45:25] Jesus and how we can exalt him it's
[1:45:27] really through those trials that really
[1:45:30] this sermon was for how we can exalt
[1:45:33] Christ in our trials let's sing that
[1:45:35] chorus that uh Brother Bruce had saying
[1:45:37] earlier be
[1:45:39] exalted be exalted we just we want God
[1:45:43] to be exalted in our lives
[1:45:46] amen I will
[1:45:48] give thanks to
[1:45:52] thee Oh Lord among the
[1:45:59] Nations I will
[1:46:01] sing praises to thee among the
[1:46:10] nation by
[1:46:12] steadfast Love is

[1:46:22] heaven and thy
[1:46:25] faithfulness Thy Faithfulness to the
[1:46:33] cloud be

[1:46:44] heaven let thy
[1:46:47] glory be over all all the
[1:46:52] [Music]

[1:46:57] exalted oh
[1:46:59] God above the
[1:47:04] heavens let the
[1:47:07] glory be over all
