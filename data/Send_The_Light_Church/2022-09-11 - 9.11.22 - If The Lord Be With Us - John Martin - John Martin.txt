TRANSCRIPT
========================================
brother mentioned uh forsaking not the assembling of ourselves together Lord we want to thank you that you've given us a desire to be here today Lord to not forsake your ways and we pray Lord as we are here today we're for the purpose of of getting strength from you getting direction for our lives to to be encouraged to be led and all the things that you have for your people we're here today at the post of Duty father we pray that you'd come in the ministry of the word that you give us ears to hear what the spirit is saying to us may they look beyond the the flesh the natural the man and may they see you in in your word as you present yourself to us uh through the word father you said thy words are Spirit in their life and now we invite them to come into our heart to make us a bold there inside of us that it could bring forth the fruit that is needed Lord we love you we commit disservice to you and we give you the praise now for what you will do in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen Judges chapter 6 starting with verse 11 we're going to talk just a little bit about Gideon this morning and there came an angel of the Lord and sat under an old which was in orphra that pertaineth unto joash the adversite and his son Gideon threshed Wheat by the wine press to hide it from the midianites and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him and said unto him the Lord is with thee thou Mighty Man of Valor and Gideon said unto him O My Lord if if the Lord be with us then why then is all this befalling us and where be all the Miracles which our fathers told us saying did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt but now the Lord have forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of the midianites and the Lord looked upon him and said go in this thy might and thou shall save Israel from the hand of the midnights have not I sent thee amen God bless you may be seated I want to entitle this message if the Lord be with us it's a question I think that we've we've asked ourselves and Gideon had been going through some some hard trials and uh he was hiding he would be threshing this weed he'd take this wheat that had been cut and dry then he was shaken the weed off and then he had to hide all the wheat because the midianites would come and they would steal it so he had to hide it and and no one wants to spend all their time laboring to help feed and then somebody else come along and just steal the labors amen but Gideon had gone through a long trial of persecution in in hardship and he had been manipulated he'd been despised he'd been uh used by the midnights and and the enemy had caused such a fear to come upon him and upon them in the midst to the point that they they felt forsaken forsaken even by God they they felt that their their future was was insecure The God Who once it delivered them from Egypt had now delivered them into the hands of the midianites amen so Gideon was discouraged to say the least amen amen he was depressed because of his situation I think to be honest we could all put ourselves in Gideon's shoes at one time or another there are times we find ourselves in similar situations to where we feel that we've been mistreated despitefully used by others maybe misunderstood or or despised disrespected or or even persecuted leaving sometimes relationships to be broken or even forsaken trials can raise a lot of questions in a man's mind to the point that we could think that actually something is wrong this shouldn't be happening something's wrong the scripture tells us beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trials which is to try you as though some strange thing has happened unto you often we can let our our feelings Trump the scriptures in other words I know the scripture says that but I still feel something's wrong I still think that's strange the trials that we go through can make us feel forsaken by God questioning his faithfulness wondering where he really is in all this and often if we're not prayed up we'll be attacked by the devil that's right he likes to present us with these questions put us in a box make us feel like something is uh he wants to make us feel like we're less than what we are less than we're a child of the king lest they were his son his daughter his bride he wants to and the thing is that the more that he can present God is away from you the less that you'll have confidence in what you're doing right so we need to this morning we need to position ourselves in the word of God the word tells us who you are and where you're positionally at right now and where he wants you to be that's what the word does and that's why the word is important no human being can tell you it takes the Holy Ghost that's why your your attention is to God speaking to you and not a man we have to get our eyes off the man because the man is going to fail as sure as anything man is going to fail but God is here to see us through amen amen so regardless of our feelings we need to to be at our pulse to duty even brother Johnson had made mention of this but we need to be prepared and we need to be executing our duties when we get to the church we need to get in the prayer room and we need to stay there until the Holy Ghost comes and reminds us Who We Are that we're a mighty man of value that God is really with us but we have to stay there till the Holy Ghost comes and tells us that amen it can't be our own thoughts can't be our own mind and it can't be our feelings because someone shook her hand right we have to stay there and get prepared for the word we need to hear from God Amen one wandering into church without the mind of Christ it's like wandering in the wilderness that's right you're amongst God's people but without the spirit of Joshua who wholly followed the Lord it was a mixed multitude they all went to church Jonas uh Jonas Jonas Jonas get it out of the way that's the way I talk sometimes don't mean to but it's just me that's why you got to take your eyes off me um Joshua was a type of the Holy Ghost and he led Caleb to his Mountain to the promised land and the Holy Ghost is here to lead us to the promised land but the word has to fall on good ground it just can't you just can't wander into church I'm here at church and you know the word I'm going to just receive the word and it's going to grow it can't it won't be like that it falls on four different types of ground you are the only one that can make sure that the ground of your heart is good ground today that you're here to believe every word of God you're not going to pick and choose and have a smorgasbord but you're going to take the word of God because man must live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God right now the Holy Ghost can't force you into the Promised Land it can only lead you to it you have to be the one to wholly follow it without the mind of Christ our thoughts can wander in the wrong places like why is this happening to me why am I being taken advantage of why doesn't anyone seem to care anymore why doesn't anybody love me come on it's awful quiet there there we all feel those things we all we all get those questions we all we all feel negative right true without the mind of Christ we can be left wandering just like Gideon did the Lord be with us why then has all this befallen us if God is really here be all his miracles which our fathers told us and if God is here then why am I struggling am I struggling to worship why am I struggling to receive why am I struggling to hear from God why haven't I been healed we'll be all the Miracles without the mind of Christ Satan will put you in a box with his questions we can become very disheartened very discouraged and sometimes ended up being judgmental towards others kind of blaming others for the way we feel maybe uh I don't like the the songs they're singing they're not helping me another preach I don't like the the preaching I like the way they make me feel how important it is to have the mind of Christ [Music] we've got to get back to our post to duty and it's not just church attendance it's Church preparation it's Church preparation that's needed that's staying in the prayer room until the Holy Ghost comes and says the Lord is with you you're a Mighty Man a value you're a mighty Christian of value we must learn to wait upon the Lord amen God is not in the business of appeasing our flesh he's in the business of being Lord over more of Our Lives that's what he's here for he's here to gain more control amen I appreciate our brother Johnson saying that it's good that we're Justified he come to justify us as if we've never sinned but we must go on now we must go on to receive more of the Holy Ghost so he can become more Lord of our life the scripture instructions instructs Us in Isaiah chapter 40 verse 29 he giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might he increaseth strength he I don't care if you feel faint if you have no power he's here to take care of you amen amen verse 31 but they that wait upon the Lord they shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as he goes they shall run and not be weary and they shall walk you know what they're not going to faint but we got to wait in prayer we got to pay the price to wait in prayer until God comes and he comes in that still Small Voice and he speaks to us that God is really with us no matter how we feel and that we are his elect if we go by feelings of who we are one day we're gonna oh yeah yeah I'm a I'm I'm a child of the king and telling everybody and this is what's happening the next day it's like I don't even feel like going to church shut up that's what happens when you're operating by feelings but Christians don't operate by feelings they want by faith is what the word says it's what matters now we're all living busy lives another thing brother Johnson mentioned he had a mini sermon today wrong going to and fro Brother Bruce had made mention Wednesday trying to accomplish things trying to make increase for our lives it's very easy to get sidetracked and forget that God is trying to take the reins of our life amen amen we can forget to let him take the reins and just uh presumptuously assuming that God Is With Us in every decision that we make instead of taking time to say I could be wrong the fear of the Lord I could be wrong Lord is this your will or should I put this aside and spend more time with you busyness can leave us wandering where is the Lord when I want to feel his presence Isaiah or not Isaiah Psalms chapter 46 verse 7. I want you to feel encouraged today but we also have to face the things that are getting in our way amen Psalms 46 verse 7 the Lord of hosts is with who do you believe that it it the Lord G the Bible says that God lives in our heart by faith of course we love to feel them love it but he don't live there by feelings is by faith so the moment that you're questioning if he's here what's happening without faith you can't even make him hot you've got to believe that he's with us the god of Jacob is our refuge come Behold The Works of the Lord what desolations he have made in the earth he maketh Wars to cease unto the ends of the Earth he breakth the bow cut the spear and thunder he burnt the Chariots and Fire how do we Behold The Works of the Lord Brother John I mean look this world's going insane it looks like just the opposite of this scripture in fact we heard that the Earth is going to burn with fervent fire we're gonna and the righteous are going to walk over the the ashes of the wicked so how do I Behold The Works of the Lord Brother John verse 10 be still and know that I am God I will be exalted among the Heathen I will be exalted in the Earth the Lord of hosts is with us but we just have to learn to be still to get alone with God to make it real if I can convince you of anything that doesn't mean anything because there's a lot of people who are much smarter than I can come by and convince you out of it but when the Lord speaks to you no man can take it from you we just have to learn to be still get to know God a little bit more we all have situations that are happening in our lives that will want to try to try us right to the core it's then we need to to really put into action that the the faith that we have and just regardless of how we feel I'm standing here the Lord is with me I'm going to be still I know the Lord is with me amen I am a mighty Christian in God's Army today that God is waiting to speak to me when I get to my post of Duty question and here God was talking to Gideon I Am with You thou Mighty Man of Valor but it seemed just like Idol Tales yes it just it just seemed like I don't Tails oh my Lord if the Lord was with us look at if if why then is all this befallen us and we're all the Miracles which our fathers told us did not the Lord bring us up from uh from the things of the world but now the Lord have forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of my enemy if we're not careful We can question or doubt when God is speaking to us here here the Lord we're speaking to him and he was debating with him he just she should have just said amen to the word amen so be it thank you Lord for the encouragement but you know he didn't do that if it's if it's true what you're saying then why am I feeling the way I'm feeling why has all these things happen to my life I'm still thinking it's strange have you ever asked these questions before where's all the Miracles why are these things befalling me can you put your feet in Gideon's shoes this morning okay I want you to put your feet and brother branham's shoes this morning want your feet to be shot with the gospel he said in the message if God be with us then where's all the Miracles he said believe the word of God and you'll see the miracles of god now this is personal he didn't say if your church believes the word of God you'll see the word of God you'll see the Miracles it's a personal believe the word of God and you'll see the miracles of god but you have to believe it first and further on in the message he said but act upon the word of God if you want to see the miracles of god so you you have to believe then you have to act not act like you believe but do the actions of what belief is live it like you believe it testify of it like you believe it go through the the hardships as if you believe it the whole reason that we want Miracles is because we need the Miracles we want the healings we we want to see things transpire so we have to believe for them take action to what God is speaking think about this we're taught by the message that God chose you one out of a million it was just Joshua and Caleb out of everywhere that came out of Egypt that were of a certain age and older that made it into the promised land think about it why wasn't one of the others because God chose them they were predestinated and they had another Spirit the Bible says they they went on to get the Holy Ghost amen if I could say it like that they weren't just just feeling good enough Justified being out of Egypt amen they wanted to go on to the promised land and they were willing to fight for it God help us to fight for it amen amen God wants to speak to us but we need to take action in what he's speaking to us now what he's speaking to you may not have anything to do with the miracle it may be something else but you may be the one that God chose in this church to bring that Miracle to pass as if you know we can easily say well you know it should be so and soul doing it it's easy it takes the responsibility off of us but it's we are a church body we function as a body there's no big eyes or a little use and in fact the way that God says that if you if you're gonna be great then you've got to be the least you've got to do the serving you've got to you got to present yourself as nothing if you really that's in God's thinking so in our thinking it we we just don't have big eyes in little use we're a body so think it not strange that God would choose you to bring the miracle to pass if you've got a revelation if you've got a revelation of what this church needs with every Revelation comes a responsibility then you take upon you the responsibility of making that come to pass that shows a maturity easiest thing to do is sit back and judge others for a situation the hardest thing to do is to take action upon the word right God help us to do that yes sir in the midst of all of our doubts and questions and fears God said I'll never leave you and I'll never forsake you Hebrews 13 Verse 5 says let your conversation be without wantingness you ever been talking to somebody and just you know we just need to be careful about our conversations and be content with such things as you have for he have said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee according to the scriptures we should never be doubting that God is with us I mean biblically speaking the Bible says it regardless of what my feelings tell me if I touch something cold and say oh that's cold if I touch something huh it's going to be hot and you can see there's a contrast between hot and cold and so there are with feelings God is with us God is not with us that's why we don't go by feelings we're Believers here we're Believers in the house of God we're Believers of the economy of God so that we may boldly say the Lord is my helper the Lord is my helper I will not fear what man shall do unto me praise the Lord brother John I'm struggling I'm feeling alone like Gideon feel like the Lord's forsaken me since when do we go by feelings how can you belittle God how can you belittle God to lower his word to your feelings and your feelings being the head of your life he's touched by the fetus of our infirmities but the word is our head not our feelings it's what the word says about me you've got to believe what the word says about you more than what you think about yourself because the word is going to the word is going to straighten our lives out it's going to put us in Balance if we're too much to this side or too much of that side the word puts us right where we need to be but our feelings oh it's like a pendulum clock this is back and forth every minute every hour don't know what's going to happen when I talk to them next God wants us standing on the word [Music] John I feel God has God is mad at me you feel God's mad at you I've sinned I've I've I'm backsliding I'm stuck in the able to see I don't even feel like trying I don't care what you've done Calvary paid the price for every one of our personal situations we we're not in a church that believes that half the things that are happening Christ didn't pay for it and there's no way out we do we don't believe that Christ is here to meet every need he has paid the price for it at Calvary all we have to do is believe it that's it just believe it don't feel it don't wait for the the bad feelings to leave just believe [Music] [Applause] I don't care how long you've been away from God Be Still yes sir yes sir be still wait on and watch him be exalted in your life the blood is here this morning to cover our past mistakes the blood is here to do its job to do what only he can do there's power in the blood and his blood shall never lose its power he will always have power we need to testify of that power you know that'll just get the devil leaving you know that you need to take advantage of God's blood not just this morning but every morning his mercies are new every morning brother van taught us a pardon is not a pardon unless it's received as a pardon so if the Lord is here pardoning us we have to receive it we have to be the one to stand up and say I believe I've been pardoned foreign unless that transpires if you're waiting for your feelings to dictate it to you again you're putting your feelings above the word and that's such an insult to God we've got to receive God's pardon better receive it by faith make him happy you got to believe God he got to believe God that he loves you he he wants to forgive us he wants to uh strengthen us he wants to to make us not remain as Gideon was why why did God come to Gideon didn't want him staying in that state of feeling forsaken feeling like God to just given us to this all these problems of the world God don't want us like that he wants us to to come and lay claims lay claims to our inheritance amen and if all we have to do is believe we have to trust that God loves us that's all we have to do God loves us God loves us how real is that to us God loves us God loves us so much that love covers a multitude of sin a multitude you can't even number it that's how much God loves us for God so loved us that he gave that we that you and I could become born again that we could gain his nature that we could become in His image his love covered so we could become him no man men don't man's love isn't doesn't cover man's Love Don't cover in fact man's love uncovers but I'll tell you if the love of God is in a man's heart he'll cover your sins just like God does God is Not different in you than he is in his word if God is in you he will act the same because he is the same yesterday today and forever okay love covers a multitude of sin I don't care where God is at it'll do the same thing Satan's accuser of the brethren you can identify him quickly because he's accusing he's not covering he's accusing another John I have a a certain per particular situation going on in my life just be still God is here to meet our needs we've got to exercise faith he is capable of hand on the worst disaster he's he's able to handle the worst situation if we sin we have an advocate with the father if we confess our sins he's faithful and just to forgive us and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness If any man lacks wisdom let him ask of God who giveth liberally to all that ask Amen in faith but we've got to ask it in faith James the ones verse 6 says but let him ask in faith not wavering for he that waiveth is like the wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed feelings basically amen but let them but let not that man think that he shall receive what anything of the Lord a double-minded man is unstable in a l l all his ways how important it is to exercise faith in our life that's 24 7. all of our all of our ways not just when we come to church try to have faith in church try to have faith in the word is it being no all of our Lives it needs to become God in all my life Philippians 4 19 says but my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in Glory by Christ Jesus amen that's the God we serve right that's the God we need to testify of that God right there the one that's of the word but we got to seek first the kingdom and his righteousness and then all other things will be added unto us so if your question if God is really with you remember he said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you if your question if God is here in the ministry of the word if you're wondering where all his miracles get alone with God he is the doubt remover maybe he's calling you to be that one to bring it to here wouldn't it be wonderful you know how it feels when God uses you to help somebody right wouldn't it be wonderful if God used you to bring forth a miracle you would just be rejoicing but that takes harder that's much harder work than to sit back and say why isn't there why isn't there I don't want to be among those that are why isn't there I want to be among those who believe who believe on two who remains faithful until he comes and does the work that he promised to do consider whatever you feel is lacking in the church and become that become that and what you're doing is you're finding your place in the body you're positioning yourself in a place to help the Bible says um where every joint supplyeth what it needs to to to function together and to grow together and to to be a body that the devil just can't easily come in through and to disrupt things we need to be strong in the Lord in the powers might we need the mind of Christ yes we need to take the sword of the spirit which is the word of God the Bible tells and just believe for it believe for the Miracles believe for things to change in your life Ephesians 6 verse 16 above all taking the shield of faith Shear to Faith that'll quench those questions we're with you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked that's those questions where you feel left in a box with no answers and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of spirit which is the word of God [Music] see the sword of the spirit there here's the wit the written word and this this word is going to judge the world right amen Jesus said I came not to judge the world but to save the world but he that rejecteth me and rejected rejected the words that I have spoken the same shall judge him in the last day we're not here to receive the natural word of God for the letter killeth what we're looking for is the spirit that wrote this word the spirit of this word that's what we're trying to invite into our heart the spirit of the word now the question will come to all of us if God be with us if God before us if God is amongst us the question is going to come to us that's the devil's job right to put the questions in her mind but it's how you're going to answer that's going to bring the results that's right that's right you can feel defeated forsaken alone without direction for your life know what to do or you can get down to business and get still with God get still and know with know with confidence that God is with you and you stay there till he comes and tells you God is never going to meet you in the prayer room and tell you to get out of here that's right no he's just going to tell you're going to hear those words when you're away from God but you got to get in the presence of God he hasn't left you've got to have faith in Christ amen you got to believe greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world amen you've got to believe it I can do all things through Christ who strengtheneth me it's not through the church don't don't put it on the church how much can Church do for you what's your definition of church Christ is not going to share his glory with anyone he wants every one of us to look to him he's knocking he wants us to open the door and let him come in and know that Christ in US can't do all things I can do all things to Christ I want you to think about this these questions now of God before us Romans chapter 8 verse 29 for whom did he for whom he did foreknow God foreknew us he also did predestinate for what very important here what did he predestinate to to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren so God has an expectation for more of him he just has that expectation this is what I'm wanting I I want to duplicate I want more of me that's what we've been predestined to we haven't been predestinated to have all of our wants met right all of our days to be sunny our friends to always understand us all of our dreams to come true we haven't been predestined to that we've been predestinated to be conformed into the image of his son's nature the nature amen that's right that word conform means jointly formed that is similar in nature fashioned like unto I'll tell you that's what this going to church is all about it that's what the reading the Bible That's why God introduced the message to you that is why the message came to us I wish we could get a revelation of that we need to be focusing on what God's plans are for us if he hasn't expected end we need to be focusing on that expected end verse 30 moreover did whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called I want to know did you did you hear the call of God the fact that you're here today shows that he called you amen not a mistake not an accident you may Wonder you may have wondered when this thing was introduced to you but it wasn't a mistake it wasn't like we even went calling on God I remember distinctly in my life not caring about God only caring about what I wanted to do and what I wanted to do wasn't pleasing to the word and then God called so we didn't choose him he chose us we didn't call on him he called us and the Beautiful Thing If you can say that I know that he called me whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified then he's also glorified so no matter what we feel no matter what the situation he's looking at a finished product that you're already glorified I see you as a finished product so now look at if you could just believe that scripture we don't have to care about how we feel about it we're just believers Are You The Feelers are you the Believers you know every Church you got feelers and believers you got to stand up and say I'm believer not a feeler I'm a Believer I remember brother Bill talking to us about a situation back in brother Johnson's church and brother Hankins was there and uh so brother brother bill went up to brother Hankins and he told Brother Hankins he said brother Hankins I just I just lost my job and brother Hankins look at him just to a minister of great wisdom of the Lord he says what do you do you want me to worry with you or do you want me to pray with you this the Simplicity of which side you're going to take it's easy to say I'm such a Believer when all your needs are met and everything's great and you're getting patted on the back but when the chips are down and think you're going through the test and trials that's when you got to stand and say I'm a Believer I believe in prayer I Believe In Christ I believe in the word I believe he's going to see me through amen foreign what shall we say to these things if God be with us why do we feel forsaken is that where Gideon said here God told him the Lord is with you you're a mighty man of value but Gideon said the Lord's with us why am I forsaken why are all these things happening see the question is going to come to us but it's how you're going to respond how are you going to respond when the question comes you're going to respond by feelings or by faith if God before us who can be against us not the medianites not anyone not any Spirit nothing can be against us because greater is he that's in us than he that's in the world thank you Jesus all these Spirits are trying to to bring us down they are but they're nothing to God what we have to do is take a stand with the word not just to staying on your own home no I'm bigger than no you're not but God in you is take a stand with the word I'm standing with Christ I'm standing with the word you got to put your faith to the test to the test if God before us who can be against us verse 32 he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us who oh every one of us amen everyone one person left out here how shall the father not with Jesus also freely give us all things whatever your need is now I don't know any person that God has given him everything their flesh ever wanted I don't think that's what that scripture is really referring to turn with me to Second Peter we'll come back to this second Peter chapter one so what what what things is he referring to I believe the scripture will help us second Peter chapter one verse three according as his divine power have given unto us all things that pertaineth unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us amen we just got done reading we're called us to glory and to Virtue amen whereby are given unto us all of us all of us not I mean anybody left out you just got to receive it whereby given us this exceeding great and precious promises then brother brother Johnson tell us at the beginning of the service that there's a lot of promises in this world we got to get in and read it exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might be partakers of what the divine nature that's what he's interested in that's what we've been predestinated to having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust God has given us what we need for the nature change that's why we've got to take these promises and apply them in our life for our nature change that's what the promises are there for now I'm not saying there's not promises for other things there are there are but God wants to see us ultimately with a nature change and that is by far the most important thing and I think sometimes we we we forget what the call is to and we get sidetracked to how we could build our kingdom down here how we can get what we want what makes us feel good what makes what we're looking for and the thing is that's not what the word is for it's for life and godliness her life and godliness we need to keep building our walk with the Lord our spiritual house until we come into His image now that's our our goal is our relationship with Christ that's what this church was really built on second Peter chapter one verse 5 let's continue reading and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue I have it add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge I believe brother Johnson was gonna no brother Johnson were you going to bring this by or is that something different but these are the the steps here that we need to go virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and Temperance patience into patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness into brotherly kindness the love of God now I'll tell you I don't I I don't think we should stop until you see the love of God in fact brother Brandon said like this you better just lay everything else going aside that you got going just lay it aside until you get perfect love keep building until you get it that should be our Focus and don't just think it's going to come and you can go do whatever you want to do it's going to come no matter what that is the wrong type of predestination that's right you got to go after it you got to build you got to add you got to do something about it no that's another message you just believe it just believe it that's all I can say just believe it Believe It Or we don't believe it Romans 8 verse 32 he that spared not his own son but delivered him us for all how shall he not with him also free to give us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect so you know what it really doesn't matter what anybody says about you true even if it's true even if it's true it doesn't matter because whatever they say isn't going to condemn you because it is they're not the judge they're not the justifier [Music] he became Our Savior and our judge our protector the final say so his blood isn't strong enough to take care of your sins but not somebody else's that's not the God we serve that's not the revelation of who God is The God Who we know if he can forgive us can forgive others if he can justify us he can justify others that's the God we serve that's why the Bible says um judge not that you be not judged and that if you uh blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain Mercy if if you judge others with little Mercy you will be judged with little Mercy now who here who here only needs little Mercy let me see your hands anybody here only needs a little Mercy we need a lot of Mercy don't we we need mercies every single morning every single then you know what we should be being merciful to everyone every single morning Christ in you would do the same thing to others as Christ does to you and our if we believe you hunger for that you thirst for that God will come in in a mighty way and just glorify himself through your life but it's hard to be merciful to somebody if they haven't done something wrong so something has to happen something has to be said about you something they have to do something wrong to you in order for you to fulfill the scripture see anybody can love those that love them but when you can love those who spear you in the back come on that's the mighty God we serve greater is he that's in us than he that's in the world we need to continue on who shall lay anything to the charge of God's light it is God that justifieth who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died for us yeah rather is risen again who's even at the right hand of God who maketh intercessions for us to make it in our sessions for us why Satan and his cohorts are accusing us Jesus is making an intercession for us right think about it who shall separate us from the love of Christ verse 35 show tribulation shall distress shall persecution shall famine nakedness Peril soar the Mennonites the roly Knights some harsh words that someone slandered you with are you going to let that stand between you and the love of God no these situations happen to us for a purpose per purpose for thy sake as it's written we are killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for Slaughter I believe God is teaching us to Shear all of our rights away share all of our pride away everything that we think of ourselves that's great in dignity we're not going to overcome the way that we overcome Revelations tells that they were came by the blood of the Lamb by the word of the testimony and they love not their lives unto death that's how you're going to overcome is when you really allow God just to have his way in your life nay and all these things we're more than conquers see there it is to him that loved us for I am persuade that neither death nor life nor angels or principalities Powers things present or things to come are you persuaded amen nor height in your death nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love relationship of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord though he slay me yet I trust him because there's a love affair we've been predestinated to God's nature nothing's going to separate us from the love of God we're more than conquerors I believe God has equipped us with everything that we need and brother Brandon makes this statement that inside of us is enough power to go create a world and go live on it so if we have a portion of the Holy Ghost there's a lot of power in that portion but we have to exercise it we have to utilize to it and and who am I to say you don't got to do this and you don't got to do that or you got to do this and you go I can't I can't be the one telling you what you need to do to have that power executed but if you listen to that still Small Voice and when he speaks to you through the word what you do just do it be as Mary said whatever he say do it just do it because it will bring results in your life now at one time the scripture was fulfilled in Matthew chapter 1 verse 23 Behold a virgin shall can shall shall be shall be with a child and shall bring forth a son and shall call his name Emmanuel which being interpreted is God With Us God With Us but God didn't want it just to remain in one man God wanted to come inside of us in John chapter 7 verse 37 in the last day that great day of the feast Jesus stood and he cried saying if any man thirsts let him come unto me and drink thirst is the first requirement thirst you got to come to church with the thirst and then you got to drink if you were thirsty and say oh yeah I'm so thirsty I mean we were digging digging digging digging digging digging trenches brother Mark thought he was out working on the railroad it was so hot sweat I was so thirsty I asked Anne and please get me an orange juice she went and got me an orange juice but if I didn't drink it it wouldn't do me any good right right and you know how hard it is to drink when you're not thirsty and you know how hard it is to eat when you're not hungry so you have to activate The Thirst you have to activate it that the Bible says if they the hunger and thirst after righteousness shall be filled right so what do we do after we thirst and drink believe verse 3 he that believeth on me as the scripture said out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water now we're talking about well let's read the next verse but this speaking of the of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because Jesus was not yet glorified so it's not so much a matter of God being in the church it's a matter of God being in the church it's not a so much a matter of the Miracles being out here it's a matter of the Miracles being right here where are you looking for the Miracles to take place what are you attracted to what is the word for I'm trying to provoke you to hunger for God inside of you amen because if you've got God inside of you you'll bring the miracle to church and you will be the one blessing this church you got to get off the seat of the scornful it's easy to sit back and say this is what missing this is what's missing this is what's missing but if you could come to church and say God's using me here God's using me here God is gonna God is going to do Miracles through me here God is calling me here that's what God's looking for for someone to stand up and say I'll be the one I'll be the one if God before us who can be against us I just want to close with this lesson of scripture second Corinthians chapter 4 verse 7. God is inside of us to meet every need second Corinthians chapter 4 verse 7 but we have this treasure in Earthen vessels it's no longer just in the church it's in me amen that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us I come to church to see God in you amen amen that's what I come for it's not a social Gathering right not a place for Fellowship it's a place to meet God we are troubled on every side now I think this thing about Gideon here we are troubled on every side but your attitude is one of faith troubled on every side yet not distressed perplexed we are not we're we're I'm sorry we are trouble don't ever say yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair were persecuted but we're not forsaken we're cast down but we're not destroyed it's just part of a Christian walk always bearing about in the body in our body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our bodies unless you're willing to crucify the flesh how can the glory of God be seen in you right how are Miracles going to come forth if you do not allow this flesh to be totally dead if you're speaking ill of others how is God going to be manifested in you right you know God ain't going to be manifested through our knowledge through what we say it's the life that we're living so then death worketh in US but life in you see you want to perform a miracle die out let God have his way inside you amen we having the same self I'm sorry Same Spirit of faith I love that we having the same Spirit of Faith according as it is written I believed and therefore have I spoken we also believe and therefore speak so it's quite easy all you got to do is not so much what the question comes to you is it will come the questions will come to you where is God but you got to have the same Spirit of faith and answer back I believe the Lord is with me amen and if you know the Lord's with you what is there to fear what is it there's nothing to fear he's taken us through to the expected endless verse knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus and shall present us with you praise the Lord let's stand together if God
