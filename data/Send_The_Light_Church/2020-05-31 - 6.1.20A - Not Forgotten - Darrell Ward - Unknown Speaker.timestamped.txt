[0:00] [Music]
[4:27] see
[4:46] slowly
[4:48] [Music]
[4:52] a man that stayed together
[4:56] to be more like
[5:00] cheer all my rights away in this world
[5:07] of sin
[5:10] I am so needy Lord to be pure with him
[5:18] let's sing it one more time
[5:20] I am so needy lo so needy of you I am so
[5:33] needed or to be more like you share all
[5:42] my rights away in this world
[5:50] I am so need to be pure
[6:01] hey don't you feel that way and I'm so
[6:06] glad that we're humble enough to say I'm
[6:08] so needy of you Lord Jesus amen
[6:12] well before we see two let's just have a
[6:14] word of Prayer American SR our precious
[6:17] brother Mike if you just opened the
[6:18] service in prayer the deceit this
[6:20] morning amen
[6:56] amen amen god bless you may be seated
[7:02] and before we start we'd like to just go
[7:06] ahead and just just talk just a couple
[7:09] moments and just this is new for us and
[7:13] all of us have come in with such what's
[7:17] going to happen and and should I be
[7:20] doing this I do do a hog sort of shake
[7:26] hands and the first thing I want to say
[7:30] is if it's in your heart to love shake
[7:36] hands that's the main thing and you can
[7:40] express that in words but it for now as
[7:46] we're approaching the reopening of
[7:49] America it would be better to to just
[7:52] lean towards the safe side so I'll just
[7:55] say like this if you feel in your heart
[7:57] that you want to shake hands I mean I
[8:00] have a see everybody just start hugging
[8:01] and it may not be the wisest thing to do
[8:06] so I would say just be thinking about
[8:10] the other person before you go ahead and
[8:12] you do that do that so we took away the
[8:18] drinking fountain because we just don't
[8:21] want people touching things so we got
[8:25] ever there's water bottles you to get
[8:26] that water bottle that yours take it
[8:27] with you if you want to take - we're
[8:31] just trying to be as wise as we can
[8:33] we're constantly cleaning between every
[8:35] surface of the door handles everything
[8:37] it's really recommended not to
[8:44] be hugging everybody in congregating so
[8:48] it would be to me it's a privilege that
[8:50] we could gather together just hear the
[8:53] word but maybe the fellowship might be
[8:56] better outside and just a little bit
[8:58] more distance and just just trying to
[9:02] use wisdom God is in every one of you
[9:04] leading you and it also would be wise if
[9:09] maybe we could just keep the same seats
[9:11] for every service just for a little bit
[9:16] this is perfect for sister Lori she's
[9:19] over in the corner only people on that
[9:20] side of the source she's like happy
[9:22] camper right now so that worked out
[9:24] really good but this this front role is
[9:30] going to be open now so just all I can
[9:36] say is that that's all I know just just
[9:40] do your best to respect it with one
[9:44] another and use wisdom and and don't
[9:47] entertain any any thoughts of fear
[9:49] because that's exactly what the enemy is
[9:51] trying to bring upon this nation and we
[9:55] have to take a stand where we're
[10:00] trusting in God amen amen praise the
[10:03] Lord I'm excited that we're together all
[10:06] I'm I it was it just been such a
[10:10] blessing to get up and walk down the
[10:13] stairs and look down the hall and
[10:14] there's pulpits out there nothing's
[10:16] there and they iced excited I'm going to
[10:19] church and when I was talking to brother
[10:23] Darrell a week or two ago and we were
[10:26] trying to figure out what would be the
[10:28] best time because we actually had
[10:30] invited him for the following week but
[10:32] this just worked out the best for him
[10:35] and we're so grateful and happy to have
[10:39] him with us
[10:42] but I told it's our first time back and
[10:44] I says that people are gonna look at you
[10:46] like Moses and you're you're setting us
[10:48] free from Egypt and so we're just
[10:51] excited about the word that's going to
[10:53] come forth and the service this
[10:57] morning as I was driving to church I
[10:59] noticed how all the green is just popped
[11:01] out just so quickly in the last week and
[11:05] a half or so and you get the the right
[11:08] temperatures the Sun and the moisture
[11:10] and it just creates life it's how God is
[11:13] and I say this morning we have an
[11:15] opportunity to create the same
[11:17] atmosphere here that we could be blessed
[11:20] and that we could grow and just blossom
[11:22] so let's just put our heart into this
[11:24] worship and and invite the presence of
[11:29] God in such a way that he just wants to
[11:31] be among us amen amen let's saying I was

[38:45] travel I went to the airport it's kind
[38:47] of nervous about flying they've been so
[38:49] long but we're glad to be here and may
[38:51] the Lord richly bless you
[38:52] we got a prayer if you have your Bibles
[38:54] this morning turn with us to the Book of
[38:55] Luke
[38:56] lead from Luke chapter 12 verse 6
[38:59] necessary week reaching the neighborhood
[39:01] orgies indistinct greetings from our
[39:03] family we sort of appreciate your friend
[39:05] for Ally she's taking her boards for the
[39:08] registry for the nursing she's a
[39:10] graduate nurse but said she felt the
[39:12] board's was unfortunate she's just a wee
[39:14] bit nervous about it and so every should
[39:16] appreciate you praying for others text
[39:20] this morning at Leeds just around the
[39:22] country people people are suffering but
[39:24] yet we serve a god who's able they live
[39:27] you know my mom and I used to tell me
[39:30] years ago she's got the glory now but
[39:32] when I was a boy my mom used to tell me
[39:33] all the time she said you know they're
[39:35] all as long as there's breath there's
[39:36] hope and I told her I still one day I
[39:39] said you don't know it's really a
[39:40] wonderful sight and I said but you know
[39:42] we serve a God even when there's no
[39:44] breath there's a man he's they would
[39:47] erase the day and aren't you grateful
[39:48] for that just morning Luke chapter 12
[39:51] verse 6 many Lord bless you the Bible
[39:54] says this are not five sparrows sold for
[39:57] two farthings
[39:58] and not one of them is forgotten before
[40:01] God no two farthings is a half-ass in
[40:05] five birds sold for a half a cent and
[40:09] not one of them is forgotten before God
[40:12] even the very hairs of your head are all
[40:15] numbered
[40:16] fear not therefore you are more value
[40:20] you are a more value than many sparrows
[40:25] think of that a sparrow just a little
[40:28] bird so insignificant in man's eyes than
[40:32] to excel five of them for a half a sin
[40:34] you won't in for many I'll give you ten
[40:36] for a pity five little birds sopra
[40:39] so insignificant in the eyes of man and
[40:42] yet Jesus but not one of them is
[40:45] forgotten which means neglected or
[40:48] uncared-for by God so no matter how
[40:51] insignificant we may seem to be the
[40:54] right house insignificant the world may
[40:56] try to make us seem to be getting God's
[40:59] us we are not forgotten

[45:49] very thoughts that we have whatever we

[45:58] Jeremiah to do says he says go cry into
[46:01] the ears of Jerusalem saying thus saith
[46:03] the Lord
[46:04] I remember thee the kindness of the
[46:07] youth the love of thine espousal when
[46:10] thou witnessed had to be in the
[46:11] wilderness in the land that was not so
[46:13] that's what I remembered you thoughts at
[46:16] the Lord how he may be you every little
[46:19] thing that you do every effort that you
[46:21] make every tear that you try every
[46:24] prayer that you pray God remembers a man
[46:27] you are not forgotten
[46:29] remember when Moses went up before the
[46:32] burning bush and you would stand before
[46:33] the Lord and he said why have you not
[46:36] heard the cries of your people why have
[46:38] you not seen them down there in bondage
[46:40] and God spoke to Moses and he said I
[46:43] have surely seen the affliction of my
[46:45] people I have heard their cries and I
[46:49] remember a promise I made to Abraham and
[46:52] I'll I'll come down
[46:58] okay God does care this morning he does
[47:02] through your prayer he does see yeah he
[47:04] does see with your heart hurts
[47:06] hey man God remembers you are not
[47:09] forgotten amen
[47:11] does God see the great big things that
[47:13] people do absolutely absolutely and
[47:17] sometimes we feel so insignificant that
[47:21] there's nothing that we can do people do
[47:24] great days off man I can't give that
[47:26] kind of a harbor and I I can't do that
[47:28] kind of thing and I can go in this
[47:30] mission field and we see people do great
[47:32] things you think what I can do nothing
[47:34] like it but you see does God see those
[47:36] pray big things absolutely
[47:38] and yet the smallest things that we do
[47:41] it gets God's attention hey man I was
[47:46] looking just before I came out the
[47:47] proposition it's the little things you
[47:49] pass over it'll bit a lot of times that
[47:52] means so much to God I think sometimes
[47:58] we just need to see not how big would
[47:59] you get even though the woman was
[48:11] standing at the door and said I hope
[48:13] she's here tonight when I went through
[48:14] said she was standing there with a
[48:16] little baby and it doctor cried and the
[48:19] mother said she wasn't a Christian but
[48:21] she didn't look the message to be
[48:24] interfered with
[48:25] so she took her baby and slipped out
[48:27] with it and when I went out the door she
[48:29] was standing there with her baby she sat
[48:31] off I would have loved to hurt the end
[48:34] of that message and something just said
[48:37] to me this is of God and I said lady are
[48:41] you a Christian she said no sir I hope
[48:44] to me sometime lovely look a little
[48:46] mother he said little baby in her arms
[48:48] that's it he's here don't put it off too
[48:52] long and then we bowed our heads
[48:54] together and prayed and I asked God to
[48:56] take her soul and at the end when I got
[48:59] through praying and she said amen she
[49:02] began to wipe the tears from her eyes he
[49:05] said why she so she can
[49:07] and she wanted the message though if she
[49:10] didn't get it we'll think about this if
[49:13] she didn't get the message because the
[49:15] baby was crying she didn't want to stop
[49:18] someone else from getting a Miss so she
[49:21] took the baby and went out even though
[49:24] she wanted to hear what was being said
[49:26] she took the baby went out so that
[49:29] somebody else could she wanted somebody
[49:32] else to get it and he said what did it
[49:34] do
[49:34] God care so he had her standing he had
[49:40] her standing right there just exactly at
[49:44] the place to receive it because he cares
[49:47] he knows how to work things just right
[49:50] oh I wonder sometimes are we gratefully
[49:54] but a selfish act got God's attention
[49:58] because he sees the little you think how
[50:01] insignificant is that then a woman would
[50:04] take your baby out and get godly move
[50:07] over to stand right there at the door
[50:09] with the Prophet went back to catch you
[50:13] because you're not for God the littlest
[50:16] things that we do God sees some 33:18
[50:21] says this behold the eye of the Lord is
[50:24] upon them that fear Him above them that
[50:27] hope in his mercy that says I've seen
[50:31] because of happy I've seen because of
[50:35] free his eyes is all the sparrow and I
[50:38] know he watches me amen the Prophet said
[50:43] to the church age but he said write
[50:45] these things say to the faithful the
[50:47] true witness they said now I want to
[50:49] show you that fire on this fall of
[50:51] faithfulness hope you don't mind me
[50:52] reading this is just so good said you
[50:54] know how often we often talk about a
[50:56] great unchanging God whose word does not
[51:00] change and when we speak of him after
[51:03] that manner
[51:04] we often get a view of him that makes
[51:06] him seem very impersonal because
[51:11] we think of a God so big you mean when
[51:13] you think that God still billions upon
[51:15] trillions of stars out of his mouth
[51:18] creating the universe and yet the Bible
[51:22] says he knows every star by name I can't
[51:26] even get my kids name right star my name
[51:35] you think of how great he is and
[51:40] sometimes when we get that in
[51:42] imagination
[51:44] it becomes impersonal and that word
[51:46] impersonal means without feeling of
[51:48] worth or no connection are not connected
[51:51] as though he would be out of touch with
[51:54] us that he would be too busy to care for
[51:56] us after all
[51:57] the whole universe is it is saying so
[52:01] the property said God made the whole
[52:02] universe and all the laws that pertain
[52:04] to it and then stood that can became a
[52:06] great impersonal God it's as though God
[52:11] made a way of salvation for lost mankind
[52:14] and that link in the cross and with the
[52:16] depth of Christ was the towbar sins and
[52:19] his resurrection gave us an open door to
[52:21] him thank God just thought in his arms
[52:24] and stood back then he used all these
[52:27] compassion on the cross and there's none
[52:28] left for us all the other angels
[52:34] received it but now at the Laodicea age
[52:37] he's run out or he's lost interest
[52:41] Senate Majority and pray maternity
[52:44] believe it in a Great Creator who had
[52:47] the creating of lost personal interest
[52:50] in his creation they said now are saying
[52:53] that's how too many people are apt to
[52:56] think that's a way a lot of people in
[52:59] the street that because they try to
[53:01] solve the problem sort of the way
[53:03] because they think God don't care for
[53:05] them God's out of touch with him or they
[53:09] can't relate to a God that great and
[53:12] people get that thinking in their mind
[53:14] and I want you to know they're sporting
[53:17] if you're thinking God will love me and
[53:19] kind of care for me and he's not
[53:21] interested
[53:23] you don't care what I'm dealing with I
[53:25] want to say to you this morning that
[53:27] that you're thinking the prophet of God
[53:30] said that's rogue thinking you're
[53:33] thinking the devil stops you're letting
[53:36] the devil lied to you you're listening
[53:39] to your hear to be instead of your
[53:40] Creator put this on your decorator he'd
[53:43] never created you to forget you Oh

[54:51] things behind by and by him all things

[54:59] own elect which he for you the son died
[55:02] upon the cross to establish the means of
[55:04] salvation and the holy spirit carefully
[55:07] execute the will of the Father he is
[55:10] working all things at this moment
[55:13] according to the purpose of his own will
[55:17] he is right in the midst of all of it he
[55:21] is in the midst of his church oh if I
[55:25] could only see God this morning just

[1:01:24] resting in his faithfulness and purposes
[1:01:27] being confident this very thing that he
[1:01:28] which have begun a good work in you will
[1:01:31] perform it until that day he never
[1:01:33] brought us this far to leave us I think
[1:01:38] that that question so song he can for

[1:01:56] not forgotten
[1:01:59] Amen hallelujah Oh blessed be the name
[1:02:03] of the Lord it's above all
[1:02:06] principalities and powers you're making
[1:02:09] the lowest name that can make God give
[1:02:12] him the hospital could be getting there
[1:02:14] putting as low as they could get him in
[1:02:16] a sinner's grave but God raised it to
[1:02:18] the house he saw he ever looks little

[1:02:51] does for so just to show us he's mindful
[1:02:54] was you know here a few weeks ago had a
[1:02:58] meteorite of celery and I've stayed up
[1:03:00] the two o'clock in the morning to see it
[1:03:02] because they said it was a good time to
[1:03:03] see that the sky was clear I said up

[1:18:13] thought of a mother can go like that
[1:18:16] what would the love of God do when this
[1:18:18] Bible says a mother may forget her
[1:18:20] suckling thing but I will never forget
[1:18:23] you Amazing Grace how sweet the sound
[1:18:26] that saved a wretch like me could a
[1:18:29] better forget her suck of the baby she
[1:18:30] made but I can never forget you
[1:18:33] here engraved at the palms of my hand so
[1:18:36] how could God ever forsake us or
[1:18:38] anything as long as he loves us my bad a
[1:18:42] man no matter what you've done no matter
[1:18:46] how far back you go no matter how much
[1:18:48] you've got into God still loves you get
[1:18:55] knocked down get up knock the dust off
[1:18:57] just keep
[1:18:58] [Music]
[1:19:00] God said I will never forget you Isaiah
[1:19:03] 4960 says this behold I have grave
[1:19:06] indeed upon the palms of my hands by
[1:19:09] walls are continually before me amen the
[1:19:14] walls of protection the walls of
[1:19:17] protection of prosperity the security of
[1:19:20] God's people God's telling him you're in
[1:19:23] minds you are in my hands
[1:19:26] you were continually do you know how the
[1:19:36] Shepherd tells his sheep from other
[1:19:38] sheep all sheep were branded and how the
[1:19:42] Shepherd tells his sheep from the other
[1:19:44] sheep is because they'll brand his sheep
[1:19:47] with a certain brand make a turkey track
[1:19:48] or triple diameter whatever it would be
[1:19:50] and they take those sheep and they
[1:19:52] Brandon with that mark and it's his mark
[1:19:55] and then when all the sheep were branded
[1:19:58] I'm told that the Shepherd holds out his
[1:20:01] hand and they take that same brand and
[1:20:04] brand the palm of his hand
[1:20:07] so he's marked with the same mark as
[1:20:11] sheep were marked with well hallelujah
[1:20:14] obviously glad were known as God's
[1:20:17] people not by the organization not
[1:20:19] nothing on the nation but not the mark
[1:20:21] of the holy spirit on their lives
[1:20:25] branded with the same venom someone said
[1:20:27] hey that's my sheep that's my sheep you
[1:20:30] can say they're mine you see the will
[1:20:41] come to me and no man is able to pluck
[1:20:43] them the other day during this
[1:20:48] quarantine been home a lot so I've been
[1:20:51] cleaning up some back fields that I've
[1:20:52] neglected you when you're only home two
[1:20:54] or three days a week things kind of get
[1:20:56] out of hand in the back field so I'll be
[1:20:57] spending a lot of time just cleaning up
[1:20:59] brush and burning brush piles and fixing
[1:21:01] my land up well I've been home really
[1:21:03] enjoyed being that time with my family
[1:21:06] so I bet their burden I was thinking
[1:21:09] about this about how that must have hurt
[1:21:12] to hold your hand can you first of all I
[1:21:16] don't think but have enough courage let
[1:21:17] somebody do that to me to hold up their
[1:21:24] hand there's a prime tweet about this
[1:21:36] long half of it was in the fire and the
[1:21:38] other half brother was out of the fire
[1:21:40] and with my bare hand I thought I'll
[1:21:42] just pick that up and pitch it into the
[1:21:43] fire
[1:21:44] well when I picked it up I didn't
[1:21:45] realize that all the speed and the juice
[1:21:48] that turned to steam that was burning in
[1:21:50] the fruit and come out the end of the
[1:21:52] branch and when I scream constantly
[1:22:23] constantly rubbing on it to see how it
[1:22:26] was doing I would set you know and in
[1:22:28] church from the preacher was preaching
[1:22:29] you're listening to the world and I
[1:22:31] would look at it just rub it
[1:22:35] our names are engraved in the palms of
[1:22:38] his hand you just constantly you see if
[1:22:51] they branded him over foot but they
[1:23:03] trouble me he says the prophet of God
[1:23:05] said they were riding out turning us
[1:23:07] they bark
[1:23:15] and without worry this Optimus head
[1:23:18] faces forever before him because every
[1:23:23] time he sees the scar oh oh oh brother
[1:23:49] girl been so sick he knows that I've
[1:23:52] been so weary he knows he never said he
[1:23:56] never said that we wouldn't have trouble
[1:23:59] he never said we wouldn't have he never
[1:24:01] said we wouldn't suffer hardships he
[1:24:03] never said we wouldn't have
[1:24:04] disappointments
[1:24:05] he never said we wouldn't bury her love
[1:24:07] he never said any of that
[1:24:08] he just said savings of time how there's
[1:24:22] only one set that's it morning my
[1:24:24] hardest times in my life there's only
[1:24:27] one set of footprints
[1:24:28] why would I needed you the most did you
[1:24:30] leave me he said I'm told I could never
[1:24:34] leave you the hardest times you will

[1:28:50] there in the year was all grown up trash
[1:28:51] it were not for my goodness clean this
[1:28:54] place up I pulled in I sat down looking

[1:29:01] out and sit on that bench for a few
[1:29:02] minutes I said I'm looking at the rocks

[1:29:23] that maybe somebody put that there
[1:29:25] in memory of her parents or a memory of
[1:29:27] her brother or something so when I first
[1:29:29] looked at it I thought it was in the
[1:29:30] concrete but when I touched it it moved
[1:29:32] so I picked it up when I picked it up it
[1:29:35] was a little silver coin laying right
[1:29:39] beside me and I picked it up and it
[1:29:42] looked at it and it says this before I
[1:29:46] formed you in the womb I knew you before
