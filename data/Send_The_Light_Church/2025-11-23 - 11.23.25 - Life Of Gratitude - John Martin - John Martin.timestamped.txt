[33:49] name, Lord, to worship you, to honor
[33:52] you, and to receive that which we have
[33:54] need of. We pray that you would bless
[33:57] your people, clothe them with your
[34:00] spirit today. Lord, open our eyes to a
[34:04] realization that we could never leave
[34:06] here and never be the same people that
[34:09] we were when we came.
[34:11] Lord, fill our hearts with thankfulness
[34:15] for you.
[34:16] You've never done wrong. You've never
[34:18] let us down. You've been so faithful.
[34:23] Just pray that you come and minister
[34:24] now, Lord, as we set our attention upon
[34:27] thee. Bless the remainder of the
[34:28] service. We pray in Jesus Christ's name.
[34:31] Amen.
[34:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to read just one verse
[34:34] in Thessal Thessalonians 1 Thessalonians
[34:37] chapter 5 verse number 18. In everything
[34:43] give thanks
[34:45] for this is the will of God in Christ
[34:47] Jesus concerning you.
[34:49] &gt;&gt; God bless you. May be seated.
[34:57] This is the day that the Lord hath made.
[35:00] I will rejoice and be glad in it.
[35:04] &gt;&gt; If a believer was to fulfill this
[35:07] scripture, in everything give thanks.
[35:12] We would have to say that this person
[35:14] would have have to lived a life of
[35:17] gratitude.
[35:18] &gt;&gt; We want to entitle this message a life
[35:20] of gratitude.
[35:22] &gt;&gt; We are living in the most ungrateful
[35:24] time
[35:26] &gt;&gt; known the history of man.
[35:30] &gt;&gt; Between entitlement and the spirit of
[35:33] this church age which is in in need of
[35:36] nothing. Um
[35:39] uh it's hard to really find genuine
[35:44] uh thankfulness in people.
[35:48] &gt;&gt; Um and I would like each one of us and
[35:51] we know how it is. You go through
[35:52] trials, you go through tests and you
[35:54] just you kind of get down in the dumps,
[35:57] right? And you and you forget to be
[36:00] thankful, forget to be grateful. And uh
[36:04] I would just like if we could this
[36:06] morning, everyone that's listening to
[36:07] kind of set aside the most difficult
[36:09] persons or people in your life to set
[36:12] aside every circumstance you have, every
[36:14] problem that you encounter
[36:17] and whatever your age is, young or
[36:20] small, because none of it matters when
[36:23] it comes to your personal choice to be
[36:25] grateful.
[36:27] &gt;&gt; It's it's all about you and how you view
[36:32] life.
[36:34] And God has told us in his word, "It is
[36:37] my will." He said that you give thanks
[36:40] in all things.
[36:42] &gt;&gt; It is the will of God concerning you. No
[36:45] matter what age, what you got going on
[36:47] in life, it is God's will for us.
[36:50] Being grateful has nothing to do with
[36:53] how much you get or the things that you
[36:55] possess,
[36:57] how little you have to work for what you
[36:59] do have or how easy life is or how
[37:02] enjoyable things are around you.
[37:05] Being grateful is an attitude.
[37:08] It's a mindset that has nothing to do
[37:11] with anything except your attitude.
[37:14] Amen.
[37:16] &gt;&gt; Where a lot of times we look at, well,
[37:17] if you knew what I was going through,
[37:18] you'd understand. Or you don't know how
[37:21] bad I have it or you don't know this or
[37:24] you don't know that. You don't
[37:25] understand. It's always like people give
[37:29] excuses and reasons
[37:31] &gt;&gt; uh not to be happy and and then not to
[37:33] be grateful for what they have.
[37:38] But it is a mindset
[37:41] that that we must continue to maintain.
[37:46] Having gratitude is a choice. Being
[37:48] thankful is a choice. But greater but a
[37:51] greater choice is to express gratitude.
[37:54] See at times we all can be thankful. We
[37:57] we all can be happy at times. We can all
[37:59] say, "Yeah, thank you for this wonderful
[38:01] dinner."
[38:04] But how about when you got to get up and
[38:05] actually make something if you want to
[38:07] eat? Can you be that grateful? You you
[38:11] understand what I'm saying? So this is a
[38:14] very challenging scripture. In
[38:16] everything give thanks for this is the
[38:18] will of God in Christ Jesus concerning
[38:20] you.
[38:22] Living a life of gratitude.
[38:27] Living a life of gratitude is not saying
[38:29] I am grateful.
[38:31] It's not saying I'm thankful.
[38:34] It's living out your thankfulness.
[38:38] &gt;&gt; It's living it out. Living it out. It's
[38:41] ex it's it's a it's an expression in
[38:43] your life.
[38:45] You ever do somebody something for
[38:47] somebody and it took you hours and
[38:50] hours, sometimes weeks to do
[38:54] &gt;&gt; and the only thing they say is thank you
[38:57] &gt;&gt; and that's all you ever ever ever get
[39:00] out of it.
[39:03] It doesn't say in everything just you
[39:06] know say the say uh say thank you and
[39:09] that's it. But give thanks is an
[39:12] expression.
[39:16] &gt;&gt; Don't say thank you. Give thanks.
[39:20] &gt;&gt; Give yourself.
[39:23] &gt;&gt; It is the will of God for you to do
[39:26] that.
[39:28] I like that. It isn't just John Martin's
[39:31] opinion.
[39:32] &gt;&gt; It's God's will.
[39:35] &gt;&gt; Living a life of gratitude is one of the
[39:37] most difficult challenges in life.
[39:41] There's so many odds stacked up against
[39:44] us as a person.
[39:46] If a person was to do this, he would
[39:49] have to not lean to his own
[39:51] understanding
[39:52] &gt;&gt; because his own understanding doesn't
[39:54] want to be always thankful for what
[39:56] they're going through.
[39:59] They would have to be able to fully
[40:01] trust God at times.
[40:05] And during adversity, they would have to
[40:07] look for reasons to be grateful because
[40:09] when you're going through a test or a
[40:10] trial, the only thing you want to do is
[40:12] talk about that situation,
[40:15] &gt;&gt; like, why me, Lord?
[40:20] How why did this befall me?
[40:24] And those questions automatically take
[40:27] you away from being grateful.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; A person would have to be a a a person
[40:33] that would be full of joy all the time.
[40:36] You have to be full of joy to look at
[40:40] the the right to find something. I
[40:43] remember in was going to brother
[40:45] Johnson's church. I think it was brother
[40:47] Johnson maybe was telling the story
[40:51] about this older lady. Um she always was
[40:57] saying good things. She couldn't never
[40:59] say anything bad. She was always saying
[41:00] good things. And there was this one man
[41:02] that was going to try to catch her and
[41:04] say, "Well, what do you think about the
[41:06] devil?"
[41:08] And [laughter]
[41:09] and and
[41:11] she said, "He's a good adversary.
[41:13] [laughter]
[41:16] And you just you'd have to be a person
[41:19] full of joy. Count it all joy when you
[41:21] fall into diverse trials.
[41:25] &gt;&gt; It have to be a person of spiritual
[41:27] understanding. And I I say that because
[41:31] you to think it not strange the fiery
[41:33] trials to con to try you. You'd have to
[41:36] be spiritual
[41:37] &gt;&gt; because as soon as you get in that
[41:39] carnality um all of a sudden um you're
[41:43] thinking this is a strange thing that's
[41:44] happened to me. Why is this happening to
[41:45] me?
[41:48] &gt;&gt; They would need to rejoice in as much as
[41:51] they are partakers of Christ's
[41:53] suffering. So this person would have to
[41:55] be a very special person built inside to
[41:58] to be living a life of gratitude.
[42:02] Most everyone can show gratitude at
[42:05] specific times or for specific reasons.
[42:08] But the will of God for us is to give
[42:10] thanks in everything
[42:12] to express a sincere gratitude in
[42:14] everything that we do and everything
[42:16] that we're experiencing
[42:18] and and everything that happens to us
[42:21] because we have to always remember God
[42:24] is with us.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; There's no need to murmur. There's no
[42:27] need to complain. There's no need to be
[42:29] negative.
[42:31] It's hard when those things are in your
[42:34] life or they bombard your life or they
[42:36] try to penetrate into your life. It's
[42:38] hard to fulfill the scripture in
[42:40] everything uh give thanks for this is
[42:42] the will of God uh concerning you. And I
[42:48] want I want my life to represent a life
[42:52] of gratitude.
[42:54] &gt;&gt; And it doesn't have anything to do what
[42:56] you have.
[42:58] It has everything to do with who you
[43:00] are.
[43:04] What can help us to become full of
[43:07] gratitude? Just full of it.
[43:12] Nobody wants to live a life of partial
[43:14] gratitude.
[43:17] Not completely ungrateful, but not
[43:20] completely grateful.
[43:22] Just kind of a lukewarm grateful.
[43:25] [laughter]
[43:28] I mean it when you're going through it,
[43:31] you usually think, well, being, you
[43:33] know, half grateful is better than not
[43:34] being grateful at all. But in reality,
[43:38] that's not what the scriptur is calling
[43:39] us to do. God God's bride, they ought to
[43:42] be the most happiest, the most grateful.
[43:45] &gt;&gt; They ought to be a a people that set
[43:48] aside for him.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; So what can help us to live a life full
[43:54] of gratitude? So just one little thought
[43:56] I want us to we could have so many
[43:58] things but one thing I want to just
[44:00] focus on today is we need to focus on
[44:03] God
[44:05] &gt;&gt; because there is just absolutely nothing
[44:08] wrong with God.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; No matter you can't find fault with God.
[44:13] They couldn't find fault with Jesus. Um
[44:16] he's a good God. There's no one good but
[44:19] God. Everybody else you can find fault
[44:22] with. But even in the midst of living in
[44:25] this um terrible world that we're living
[44:28] in, uh God still wants us to give thanks
[44:32] for everything that we go through.
[44:35] So I want us to focus on God more. God
[44:38] is good. Everything that God does is
[44:41] good. Everything he after he created
[44:42] everything he looked back to himself his
[44:45] own testimony of his own works says and
[44:48] it was good.
[44:50] &gt;&gt; Jesus said there's none good but one.
[44:52] That's God. It's even the goodness of
[44:55] God that leads man to repentance.
[45:00] God's goodness.
[45:02] Job said, "Behold, God is great."
[45:08] Psalms 145:1 says, "I will extol thee,
[45:13] my God, oh king, and I will bless thy
[45:16] name forever and ever.
[45:20] Every day will I bless thee, and I will
[45:23] praise thy name forever and ever.
[45:26] Great is the Lord, and greatly to be
[45:30] praised,
[45:32] &gt;&gt; and his greatness is unsearchable.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; See, if we could just focus on him, then
[45:38] our problems won't seem so great in our
[45:41] sight.
[45:42] because it's problems that usually get
[45:44] us down
[45:45] &gt;&gt; and then we we kind of justify a reason
[45:48] not to be happy,
[45:49] &gt;&gt; justify a reason not to be thankful
[45:52] &gt;&gt; and and then we we almost begin to put
[45:55] the blame on on on situations where in
[45:58] reality God wants us to be mature
[46:00] Christians.
[46:02] &gt;&gt; Wants us to be strong Christians. He
[46:04] wants us to to be able to exercise that
[46:06] ability, that attitude to be strong in
[46:09] the Lord.
[46:11] Lamentations uh uh chapter 3 verse 22. I
[46:15] could quote it. I know you know it but I
[46:17] I just wanted us to read it. It is of
[46:21] the Lord's mercies that we are not
[46:24] consumed
[46:26] &gt;&gt; because his compassions fail not.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; They are new every morning. Great is thy
[46:33] faithfulness.
[46:35] Well, just focusing on that
[46:38] &gt;&gt; this morning when I was praying and just
[46:40] crying out to God for mercy like he has
[46:43] mercy there for us.
[46:47] And if we could just focus on the
[46:49] goodness of God.
[46:53] He loves us. He's not going to leave us
[46:56] in a place of just despondency.
[47:02] I like I love this this verse here. 1st
[47:05] Samuel chapter 12 um chap verse 24 if
[47:09] you want to write it down. I see you you
[47:11] guys are writing some things down here
[47:13] and that'd be a good good one to write
[47:15] down is this one right here. 1st Samuel
[47:18] 12 verse 24. Only fear the Lord
[47:22] and serve him in truth with all your
[47:25] heart. For consider how great things he
[47:31] have done for you.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; For you,
[47:35] for you.
[47:40] You know, we need to keep a record of
[47:41] the good things that God does for us.
[47:45] &gt;&gt; We seem to forget what he did last week,
[47:47] [laughter]
[47:48] last month, last year.
[47:53] And God doesn't want us to forget those
[47:55] things because we can build. I mean, if
[47:58] you you think about it, when David was
[48:00] faced with having to go against uh
[48:04] Goliath,
[48:08] um what did he do? He brought up
[48:12] what God did for him in the past.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; Look, God helped me with a bear. God God
[48:19] helped me with a lion.
[48:21] And he he brought that up to help face
[48:24] his challenges that stood in front of
[48:25] him. And a lot of times we just we you
[48:28] know we wake up and and we got bad
[48:29] things going on in our life and in
[48:31] certain situations and we don't know how
[48:33] to deal with it. Don't know what to do
[48:35] and we get upset, we get bothered, we
[48:37] get angry, we we we we just want to
[48:39] throw in the towel. And in reality, God
[48:41] says, "No, look what I've done for you.
[48:43] Consider what I've done for you."
[48:47] &gt;&gt; It is no secret what God can do. what
[48:49] he's done for others, he can do for you.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; So, keep keep the Lord before you.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; Count your blessings. Name them one by
[49:01] one.
[49:02] Bring up something he's done in the
[49:05] past. If If God never did another thing
[49:08] for you, could you still live a life of
[49:10] gratitude?
[49:11] &gt;&gt; WHAT A CHALLENGE. WHAT A CHALLENGE.
[49:17] God just wants us to be grateful for
[49:19] him.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; He saved us.
[49:22] &gt;&gt; Is there anything else that he needs to
[49:25] do?
[49:28] It should be easy for us
[49:31] to be grateful.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; Should be very easy. Think about God has
[49:37] redeemed us. Even when we were dead in
[49:39] sins and uh trespasses, he has quickened
[49:44] us together with Christ. The Bible says,
[49:47] "For by grace are you saved and has
[49:49] raised us up together and made us to sit
[49:51] together in heavenly places in Christ
[49:53] Jesus." Now, God did that. He loved us
[49:57] when we were in our sins.
[50:00] He brought us out of that.
[50:06] I think there's we don't need any other
[50:09] re reason. We don't need any other
[50:12] blessing. We don't need any other reason
[50:15] to live a life of gratitude.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; God has changed his nature. Our na God
[50:21] has changed our nature.
[50:24] God has given us eyes to see. He said,
[50:26] "Blessed are your eyes for they see.
[50:28] Your ears for they hear." This is what
[50:30] God did for us. Brother Ron said he's
[50:32] brought us out of darkness into his
[50:34] marvelous light.
[50:36] God has given us revelation of who he
[50:39] is. He has reserved that for himself.
[50:42] And think about the revelation that you
[50:44] have today that other people don't have
[50:46] even when you try to tell them.
[50:49] &gt;&gt; We are written epistles read of all our
[50:51] lives express who we are.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; It isn't how high you can jump.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; It isn't how loud you can shout. It's
[51:00] what life you can live.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; That's where it counts.
[51:05] God has protected us. He has shielded us
[51:08] from so many things. God has kept us
[51:11] back from going into back into the
[51:13] world.
[51:15] Right? So many people have have slid
[51:17] back into the world. But look where
[51:19] we're at today.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; God has filled us with his spirit, his
[51:25] life, his love, his joy, his peace, his
[51:28] goodness. All that God is is poured into
[51:31] you.
[51:33] God has delivered us from a spirit of
[51:36] fear and and and manipulation and abuse
[51:39] from the devil tormenting us in our
[51:42] minds. And he has given us a spirit of
[51:44] power and of love and of a sound mind.
[51:50] God has brought healing many times to
[51:51] our bodies, to our spirits, to our soul.
[51:56] So just consider how great things God
[51:58] has done for you.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; God is good. He's great. He's faithful.
[52:05] &gt;&gt; He will never put more upon us than what
[52:08] we can bear.
[52:12] I
[52:13] &gt;&gt; I'm sure, brother Dennis, we all have at
[52:15] one time or another. we've given
[52:18] something to somebody do whether it's
[52:19] our child or somebody that works for us
[52:22] and they didn't quite do well in their
[52:25] what they were doing and we step back
[52:26] and we said did I give them too much did
[52:29] I put too much on them you know what I'm
[52:30] saying but here's the thing with God no
[52:33] matter what we go through how we feel
[52:35] God will never put anything on us that
[52:36] we can't bear
[52:38] &gt;&gt; he knows how much we can bear
[52:40] &gt;&gt; that's why we can rejoice in our trials
[52:42] that they're not too great too hard
[52:46] &gt;&gt; so when we quiet our minds and consider
[52:48] all that God has done for us. Our
[52:50] gratitude magnifies
[52:57] &gt;&gt; um alleyu.
[52:59] He proclaims God's majesty here in Job
[53:03] chapter 37 verse14 when he said hearken
[53:06] unto this oh Job stand still and
[53:10] consider the wondrous works of God.
[53:17] You ever just look at the stars and say,
[53:19] "Oh my."
[53:21] &gt;&gt; Look at the the mountains, the mountain
[53:25] peaks,
[53:26] look at the birds. Just look at what God
[53:30] created
[53:32] and think he is a great God
[53:36] and
[53:36] &gt;&gt; he created you.
[53:39] Sure, you were born with a demonic
[53:44] um selfish,
[53:47] uncaring,
[53:48] stingy,
[53:50] I'm going to be first self-centered
[53:53] spirit in your life. [laughter]
[53:56] But God is changing us.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; That is glorious.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; He makes all things beautiful in his
[54:07] time.
[54:08] He is making us into his same image.
[54:13] Psalms 8:3 says, "When I consider thy
[54:17] heavens and the work of thy fingers, the
[54:21] moon and the stars which thou hast
[54:24] ordained? What is man that thou art
[54:28] mindful of him?"
[54:32] God.
[54:36] God will never leave us in a situation
[54:40] that he won't take care of us.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; His grace is sufficient to meet every
[54:44] need.
[54:46] But you know, if you just just think
[54:48] about it, we don't this is not my notes
[54:50] here, but it just kind of came to me in
[54:52] 1 Corinthians chapter 10, if you want to
[54:55] write it down.
[54:57] [clears throat] God was not well pleased
[54:59] with the children of Israel because they
[55:02] murmured and they complained. That that
[55:04] was what he said.
[55:06] In other words, they didn't remain
[55:08] grateful for what God did for them.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; If they if they could have, you know,
[55:13] they when they came over and they passed
[55:15] over the Red Sea, what did they do? They
[55:16] danced, right? They shouted, they
[55:18] danced, and they said, you know, God
[55:20] gave us the victory.
[55:22] But you know what happened is they
[55:23] didn't continue dancing.
[55:26] [laughter]
[55:27] They and they could have they they could
[55:30] have walked up when there was a problem
[55:32] and because there was like what 10
[55:34] problems or something like that that
[55:36] they went through and all those problems
[55:39] they murmured and complain.
[55:42] They wanted to get a new leader. Let's
[55:44] go back into the world. Let's go back to
[55:46] Egypt.
[55:48] And all God wanted to do was trust him.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; Just trust.
[55:55] How can you watch the greatest the only
[55:58] the the greatest world power die in
[56:01] front of your eyes and doubt what God's
[56:04] going to give you?
[56:06] &gt;&gt; Because even though the the the promised
[56:09] land was filled with giants, those
[56:11] giants were nothing like Egypt.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; Egypt was so much of a greater problem.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; And for whatever reason, they didn't
[56:22] build on that faith.
[56:25] And they went through the trials in the
[56:26] wilderness. And what happened? Every
[56:28] time they went through a trial, they got
[56:30] beat down. Beat down. Beat down. Beat
[56:33] down to the place they were scared.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; Now, that wasn't God's fault.
[56:40] God gave them an opportunity
[56:43] to be positive with every trial
[56:47] to to have a heart of gratitude
[56:50] that God will provide a way. He will
[56:52] provide
[56:53] all uh bitter water to be sweet.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; He He will provide food for us. He will
[56:59] provide healing for us.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; God is faithful. He is good.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; Now, we can look back on that. The Bible
[57:08] says as examples for us
[57:11] that that we need to just be more
[57:14] grateful
[57:16] &gt;&gt; in everything. Give thanks. I'm telling
[57:19] you, if they would have just gave thanks
[57:20] in every one of those trials that they
[57:22] went through, I believe when they would
[57:23] have came up to the next trial, they
[57:26] would have such strength, such faith,
[57:29] such ability to say, you know, the
[57:31] bigger they are, the harder they fall.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; See, see, our attitude has everything to
[57:36] do with where we're going in life.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; Quoted this before. He had made
[57:44] everything beautiful in his time. We
[57:47] have to trust him for that.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; Psalms 91:1, "He that dwelleth in the
[57:53] secret place of the most high shall
[57:56] abide under the shadow of the almighty.
[57:58] I will say of the Lord, he is my refuge.
[58:00] He is my fortress. He is my God. In him
[58:03] I will I trust." Just consider the place
[58:06] that you dwell. You're dwelling with
[58:09] God.
[58:12] You talk about safety.
[58:18] It's like it doesn't matter what goes
[58:20] wrong in your life, you're dwelling with
[58:21] God.
[58:23] All is well.
[58:25] My son died.
[58:28] All is well.
[58:30] What a testimony.
[58:34] I know that there's room for growth in
[58:36] my life to be more thankful.
[58:40] Deuteronomy 4:7. Think thinking about
[58:44] the nation of of of Israel now. For what
[58:48] nation is there so great
[58:53] who have God so close to them
[58:56] as the Lord our God is in all things
[59:00] that we call upon him for.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; Think about that. There was no nation at
[59:06] all underneath the sun except Israel
[59:08] that they could call upon God and that
[59:11] he would be there with him whenever they
[59:13] called upon him.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; Now you are spiritual Israel.
[59:23] What people are there like you that when
[59:25] you call on God that he's there?
[59:28] Think about that.
[59:30] In all thy ways acknowledge him and
[59:32] he'll direct thy paths.
[59:35] The Lord is nine to all them that call
[59:37] upon him, to all that call upon him in
[59:40] truth. That's Psalms 145 if you want to
[59:42] write it down. God is with you if you
[59:45] just call upon him.
[59:48] He is faithful.
[59:52] Hebrews chapter 13 verse 5. Knowing
[59:54] that, knowing that, having that, let
[59:57] your conversation be
[1:00:00] without covetousness,
[1:00:03] and be content with such things as you
[1:00:05] have, for he have said,
[1:00:09] I will never leave thee, nor forsake
[1:00:12] thee.
[1:00:16] What a comfort
[1:00:19] soul that we may boldly say, "The Lord
[1:00:22] is my helper
[1:00:25] and I will not fear what man shall do
[1:00:28] unto me."
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; Boy, that just that that doesn't give
[1:00:33] you boldness right there.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm thankful that God is my helper.
[1:00:42] You know, if you I remember as a kid
[1:00:44] when I was a kid going to school and we
[1:00:46] would like we'd play football and we'd
[1:00:48] play sports and we'd all we'd all like
[1:00:51] choose who was going to be on our team.
[1:00:53] We did a little bit of that out here
[1:00:54] behind the church. We're like, you know,
[1:00:57] pick on who's who's going to be on whose
[1:00:58] team
[1:01:00] and you'd always want the, you know, the
[1:01:01] best player, the fastest player. You
[1:01:04] know, you got to make sure you get them.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; But God is our helper.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; He's the best one to have on your team.
[1:01:11] Amen.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; Everybody can forsake you, but if you
[1:01:15] got God,
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; if I got Jesus, I got a law,
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; right? Hebrews 13:8, Jesus Christ is the
[1:01:26] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; He's the same. We don't have to think
[1:01:32] that things are going to be different
[1:01:33] now because of this, that, or the other.
[1:01:36] Count on God. Isaiah chapter 61:10. A
[1:01:39] lot of lot of scriptures here. They're
[1:01:41] they're they're to hopefully cause us to
[1:01:43] put our focus on God and to that if
[1:01:46] there if we people are going to let us
[1:01:49] down,
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; but God won't let us down.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; That's why if we if we make God our
[1:01:55] focus, it's easier to remain grateful.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 61:10, I will greatly rejoice in
[1:02:03] the Lord. My soul shall be joyful in my
[1:02:06] God, for he have clothed me with the
[1:02:09] garments of salvation. He have covered
[1:02:11] me with the robe of righteousness,
[1:02:14] as a bridegroom deckth himself with
[1:02:18] ornaments, and as a bride adornneth
[1:02:21] herself with her jewels. Wow. Isn't that
[1:02:25] beautiful?
[1:02:27] Beautiful.
[1:02:30] All right. Here's a prayer in 1
[1:02:31] Chronicles chapter 29. This is David
[1:02:34] praying. And I like I like reading
[1:02:36] prayers because it helps me to know how
[1:02:37] to pray. Amen. 1st Chronicles 29:10.
[1:02:41] Wherefore David blessed the Lord before
[1:02:44] all the congregation. And David said,
[1:02:46] "Blessed be thou Lord God of Israel our
[1:02:49] father forever and ever. Thine, oh Lord,
[1:02:54] is the greatness and the power and the
[1:02:58] glory and the victory and the majesty.
[1:03:02] For all that is in heaven and in earth
[1:03:05] is yours.
[1:03:07] Yours is the kingdom, O Lord, and thou
[1:03:09] art exalted as the head above all.
[1:03:14] Both riches and honor come of thee,
[1:03:19] and thou reignest over all, and in thy
[1:03:21] hand is power and might, and in thy hand
[1:03:24] is to make great, and to give strength
[1:03:28] unto all. Now therefore, our God, we
[1:03:31] thank thee and praise thy glorious name.
[1:03:36] What a wonderful prayer.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; Ending our prayer with thanksgiving. If
[1:03:42] you read the Bible enough, you would
[1:03:43] notice that Paul would often say, "I
[1:03:46] give thanks upon every remembrance of
[1:03:48] you." Or, "I I thank you when I heard of
[1:03:51] your faith." Or he would always express,
[1:03:53] "I giving thanks."
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; We ought to be thankful and give thanks
[1:03:58] for one another.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; I mean, you may not be getting
[1:04:02] everything you want out of everybody
[1:04:03] here,
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; but think about this. Everybody here has
[1:04:09] prayed for for you.
[1:04:12] And when I think of that for me that
[1:04:14] everybody has prayed for me, well, I can
[1:04:16] tell you I don't deserve that.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; And in that state of mind, it helps me
[1:04:22] to be thankful for everybody.
[1:04:28] Hebrews 12 verse 1, wherefore seeing we
[1:04:31] are also compassed about with so great a
[1:04:34] cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside
[1:04:38] every weight and the sin which that so
[1:04:42] easily beset us. And let us run with
[1:04:45] patience the race that is set before us,
[1:04:47] looking unto Jesus, the author and the
[1:04:50] finisher of our faith, who for the joy
[1:04:52] that was set before him endured the
[1:04:55] cross. He despised the shame and is sat
[1:04:57] down at the right hand of the throne of
[1:04:59] God. For consider this man, for consider
[1:05:01] him that endured such contradiction of
[1:05:05] sinners against himself, lest you think
[1:05:08] you got it worse, be weary and faint in
[1:05:10] your minds.
[1:05:14] Consider
[1:05:15] God bore our sorrows.
[1:05:19] He bore the stripes on his back for us.
[1:05:24] He was beaten for us, bruised for us.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; Our sorrows were taken away.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Set your affections on
[1:05:37] things above and not on things of the
[1:05:39] earth." When you think about heaven, you
[1:05:42] don't murmur and complain as much.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; Look at Psalms 1 verse one. Blessed is
[1:05:49] the man that walketh not in the counsel
[1:05:51] of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way
[1:05:52] of sinners, nor si siteth in the seat of
[1:05:55] the scornful, but his delight, his
[1:05:58] delight is in the Lord,
[1:06:02] and in the word does he meditate day and
[1:06:05] night. And he shall be like a tree
[1:06:07] planted by the rivers of water, that
[1:06:09] bringeth forth his fruit in his season.
[1:06:12] His leaf also shall not wither, and
[1:06:15] whatsoever he do it shall prosper. You
[1:06:17] know this to me sounds like a life of
[1:06:20] gratitude. A man, a a woman, a believer
[1:06:23] whose life is full of gratitude.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; So when we consider how great God is,
[1:06:32] that means we can do all things through
[1:06:33] Christ who strengthenth us.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; That ought to cause us to worship and
[1:06:38] give thanks.
[1:06:40] When we consider how great God has been
[1:06:42] to us that we can be confident of this
[1:06:46] very thing that he which had begun a
[1:06:47] good work in us, he's going to perform
[1:06:49] it unto the day of Jesus, he's going to
[1:06:51] finish it. That ought to make us want to
[1:06:53] worship him and and and give honor to
[1:06:56] him and give thanks to him. Just knowing
[1:06:58] he's going to finish the work.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; See, what happens is we get away from
[1:07:02] the reality of God and we start dealing
[1:07:04] in this life
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; down here and oh, this got this problem.
[1:07:08] I got this problem and I need help over
[1:07:10] here and nobody cares about this and I
[1:07:12] got this and and in reality what it is
[1:07:15] that is just there to prove where you're
[1:07:17] at with God.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; That's all that's there for.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; You think that these are just problems
[1:07:22] that you know this you call this real
[1:07:25] life down here and and this is just
[1:07:27] going to church twice a week.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; No, but the reality is you got to bring
[1:07:32] God into your life.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; You got to bring God into your real
[1:07:36] life.
[1:07:42] prosper.
[1:07:44] Let him prosper you in everything that
[1:07:46] you do.
[1:07:50] When we consider that God works all
[1:07:52] things for the counsel of his will,
[1:07:56] then we know that all things work
[1:07:59] together for the good to them that love
[1:08:02] the Lord and called according to his
[1:08:04] purpose. He's working all things through
[1:08:07] the council of his own will. Not
[1:08:09] Satan's,
[1:08:11] not Putin's,
[1:08:15] not anybody. He's working everything the
[1:08:17] council of his own will.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; And when we love that same God
[1:08:24] that he makes everything work out for
[1:08:26] our good,
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; that ought to be enough to make us
[1:08:30] thankful.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; There are so MANY REASONS TO BE
[1:08:33] THANKFUL. IF A PERSON IS NOT FULL OF
[1:08:36] GRATITUDE, SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH THEIR
[1:08:38] ATTITUDE.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; It's all there is to it.
[1:08:45] When we consider how great God really
[1:08:47] is, the easiest thing to do ought to be
[1:08:51] to give thanks for all things.
[1:08:54] Whether we're whether it's for the good
[1:08:58] or the bad that happens to us.
[1:09:01] Whether it's the blessings we get or
[1:09:03] trials, whether it's God's prosperity in
[1:09:06] our life or or his hardships for us,
[1:09:09] whether it's victories or battles,
[1:09:11] whether it's sunshine or storms, we
[1:09:14] ought to be able to say, "I love you,
[1:09:16] Jesus. Praise your name. I give thanks
[1:09:18] to this." I I shared this story one time
[1:09:21] and brother I think it was brother
[1:09:22] Johnson he was uh ministering and u
[1:09:27] giving thanks and and along those lines
[1:09:30] and I don't know if it was a
[1:09:31] thanksgiving message or what it was but
[1:09:33] might have been because um afterwards
[1:09:36] they uh went up north and they were
[1:09:38] hunting and they were around the
[1:09:40] campfire and as they were around the
[1:09:42] campfire um one of the um he was
[1:09:45] roasting a marshmallow and uh you know
[1:09:49] how sometimes they can get uh real hot
[1:09:52] and they just it kind of blows up and it
[1:09:54] it blew up and it went in his eye and
[1:09:57] the devil automatically came to brother
[1:09:59] Johnson and said, "Okay, what are you
[1:10:00] going to be what are you going to be
[1:10:01] thankful for that for?"
[1:10:04] And he just says, "I'm I'm thankful that
[1:10:06] it didn't blind me."
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; He gave thanks for that situation,
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; challenged by the devil.
[1:10:17] and and and to me there is nothing
[1:10:20] greater than this word right here being
[1:10:23] manifested in flesh.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; It's not a story. It's not how well you
[1:10:28] can preach. It's not how well you can
[1:10:30] sing it. It's how well you can live it.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; How well you can live that word.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; That's what attracts
[1:10:39] God's attention.
[1:10:42] Brother and brother Ram said the word is
[1:10:44] what attracts the bride. Remember
[1:10:48] he he told that story about
[1:10:51] um
[1:10:54] uh when the message kind of went out,
[1:10:55] the gifts were being expressed, it
[1:10:57] attracted a lot of people,
[1:11:00] but the majority of them were small
[1:11:02] fishes.
[1:11:07] And he says you can't teach
[1:11:11] um
[1:11:15] Pentecostal baby spiritual things
[1:11:20] because he tried to explain how that
[1:11:22] gift worked
[1:11:24] and God didn't want him to do that.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it people want to mimic.
[1:11:31] People want attention drawn to them. So
[1:11:34] they try to do something
[1:11:37] and so then there was uh larger fish,
[1:11:41] right? And then
[1:11:43] um and then at the end there was and
[1:11:46] there were there was not as many.
[1:11:49] But then at the end there was the very
[1:11:51] large fish and there was just not very
[1:11:54] many of those at all. [snorts]
[1:11:56] And and and that's what when it comes to
[1:11:58] the real bride, there isn't very many at
[1:12:00] all.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; There there just isn't. There's there
[1:12:04] there's a lot of people that associate
[1:12:05] with the bride, but there's not a lot of
[1:12:08] bride members. There are few. And uh we
[1:12:12] ought to be the most thankful.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; We ought to be the most thankful because
[1:12:17] we're part of the group of God. Amen.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; So, we ought to count it all joy. When
[1:12:25] the trials come into our lives, we ought
[1:12:26] to give thanks. God knows what we have
[1:12:29] need of. God knows the character that
[1:12:31] he's trying to build within us. He knows
[1:12:33] what's lacking and what is needed. So,
[1:12:35] we go through a trial. We just forget
[1:12:37] about trying to lean your own
[1:12:38] understanding. Figure it all out. Get
[1:12:39] all down in the dumps. Just give God
[1:12:41] thanks.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; Don't lead your own. Thank you, Lord.
[1:12:44] You know what you're doing.
[1:12:47] Remember last service we talked about
[1:12:50] that when we're weak, we're really
[1:12:51] strong. And Paul speaking in 2
[1:12:53] Corinthians 12:9. And he said unto me,
[1:12:56] "My grace is sufficient for you,
[1:13:00] for my strength is made perfect in
[1:13:02] weakness." Most gladly. Now look at the
[1:13:05] attitude that Paul has after he just
[1:13:09] seeks the Lord three times. Take this
[1:13:11] away from me. Take this away from me. It
[1:13:12] hurts.
[1:13:14] says, "Most gladly, therefore, I rather
[1:13:16] glory in my infirmities,
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; and that the power of Christ may rest
[1:13:22] upon me. Therefore, I actually take
[1:13:25] pleasure I take pleasure in infirmities,
[1:13:30] in reproaches,
[1:13:33] in in having needs in my life, in
[1:13:35] necessities,
[1:13:37] when people persecute me, and when the
[1:13:40] distress comes upon me for Christ's
[1:13:42] sake. For when I am weak, then I am
[1:13:45] strong. What an attitude
[1:13:50] to be happy when you're going through a
[1:13:51] trial.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; To me, that just seems to to be
[1:13:54] priceless.
[1:13:56] I mean, who can do that?
[1:13:59] Who can do that? It it would have to be
[1:14:01] Christ in a person.
[1:14:05] And that so I just say that's priceless.
[1:14:07] In everything give thanks for this is
[1:14:09] the will of God in Christ Jesus.
[1:14:12] concerning you.
[1:14:15] You know, when a man goes into the army,
[1:14:18] I don't know if you're thinking about
[1:14:19] [clears throat] going into the army, are
[1:14:21] any of you? Not. Not. No way. Okay.
[1:14:25] Well, when a man goes into the army,
[1:14:28] what does it do? Usually, when he thinks
[1:14:31] about going to the army, what is the
[1:14:32] first thing we think?
[1:14:37] Boot camp. That's right. Boot camp. It
[1:14:40] it it it it toughens you up. You know,
[1:14:42] when a person goes in the army, if any
[1:14:44] anybody's ever watched somebody go into
[1:14:46] the army and come out and you you see a
[1:14:48] difference in them,
[1:14:50] you you definitely see it. It toughens
[1:14:52] you up. They learn to become a real man.
[1:14:58] What do they do? They they have to be
[1:14:59] taught, you don't lean to your own
[1:15:01] understanding. You do what I tell you to
[1:15:02] do. Yes,
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; they learn to take authority or take
[1:15:08] orders from authority
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; where before, you know, maybe living at
[1:15:12] home, they didn't have to listen to mom
[1:15:13] or dad.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; But you in the army, that don't work.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; That don't work.
[1:15:20] You learn
[1:15:22] because it's no more about I love you.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; If you get down and do 25 push-ups and
[1:15:28] you say that again, you're going to be
[1:15:30] doing 125.
[1:15:33] Right. It's it's it's no take advantage.
[1:15:36] It's this is the army.
[1:15:39] Well, as soldiers of God's great army,
[1:15:43] we have to learn to become real strong
[1:15:45] soldiers,
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; real strong Christians.
[1:15:50] We need to learn to not be wise in our
[1:15:52] own eyes, but fear the Lord and depart
[1:15:54] from evil. That kind of thinking. We
[1:15:56] need to learn to trust the Lord with all
[1:15:58] of our heart, not lean to our own
[1:16:01] understanding. In all of our ways,
[1:16:03] acknowledge God and he's going to direct
[1:16:04] our path. Now, that's what we need to
[1:16:06] learn to do to be a strong soldier.
[1:16:10] Paul didn't pull any punches when he's
[1:16:12] talking to Timothy.
[1:16:14] Timothy was afraid to be a partaker of
[1:16:17] the sufferings of Christ.
[1:16:20] In fact, one place he said, "All that
[1:16:22] live godly in Christ Jesus are going to
[1:16:24] suffer persecution." But if you turn
[1:16:26] with me to 2 Timothy chapter 1, I want
[1:16:28] to try to read these real quick because
[1:16:30] I have some other scriptures I would
[1:16:32] like to get through.
[1:16:35] But I think a lot of times be what makes
[1:16:37] a person not um h have a life or or live
[1:16:41] a life of gratitude is because they're
[1:16:44] not strong.
[1:16:45] They're weak. They're weak and they they
[1:16:49] have to have everything all their
[1:16:51] feelings and everything has all the
[1:16:54] ducks got to be in the row and
[1:16:55] everything just has to be perfect and
[1:16:57] then they're going to be okay. Thank
[1:16:59] you.
[1:17:01] And that's that to me that makes for a
[1:17:03] weak a weak Christian.
[1:17:07] Second Timothy chapter 2 verse one. Thou
[1:17:09] therefore my son Timothy be strong in
[1:17:12] the grace that is in Christ Jesus.
[1:17:15] strong in the grace that is in Christ
[1:17:17] Jesus.
[1:17:19] And the things that thou has heard of me
[1:17:21] among many witnesses, the same commit
[1:17:23] thou to faithful men, who shall be able
[1:17:25] to teach others also. Thou therefore
[1:17:28] endure hardness as a good soldier of
[1:17:30] Jesus Christ.
[1:17:33] Endure hardness as a good soldier of
[1:17:36] Jesus Christ. No man that warth
[1:17:40] entangleth himself with the affairs of
[1:17:42] this life that he may please him to have
[1:17:44] called him and chosen him to be a
[1:17:45] soldier. In other words, uh in all
[1:17:48] things give thanks for this is the will
[1:17:50] of God. This is the will of God in
[1:17:53] Christ Jesus concerning you.
[1:17:56] It is the will of God that you give
[1:17:58] thanks in everything.
[1:18:03] Don't allow yourself to become entangled
[1:18:07] with things that make you sour, bitter,
[1:18:11] angry.
[1:18:13] Get away from that. Don't entangle
[1:18:15] yourself with that thinking. Think on
[1:18:17] these things. Think on the things that
[1:18:19] leave you at peace.
[1:18:25] And if a man strive for masteries, look
[1:18:28] at this. He is not crowned except he
[1:18:32] strive lawfully, right? You can't go
[1:18:36] into the Olympics and take a bunch of
[1:18:37] steroids.
[1:18:40] You get kicked out. You don't win the
[1:18:42] crown. You got to do it lawfully.
[1:18:46] The husbandmen that labor must be first
[1:18:49] partakers of the fruit. Consider what I
[1:18:51] say. And the Lord give thee
[1:18:53] understanding in all things. It is the
[1:18:57] will of God that we that in everything
[1:19:00] we give thanks. I'll tell you, if we
[1:19:01] could just leave here with the
[1:19:02] determination to be more thankful, I
[1:19:05] believe that we would accomplish what
[1:19:07] God wants in our life.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; It's hard for God to bless us when we're
[1:19:12] not thankful.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; I mean, you that got children, if
[1:19:15] they're always murmuring and
[1:19:16] complaining, you don't want to do things
[1:19:17] for him. That's just natural.
[1:19:20] And and God's God's no different.
[1:19:23] [snorts] All right? Remember that Jesus
[1:19:24] Christ of the seed of David was raised
[1:19:26] from the dead according to my gospel
[1:19:28] wherein I suffer trouble.
[1:19:31] I'm suffering trouble as an evildoer,
[1:19:34] even unto bonds, but the word of God is
[1:19:37] not bound. Therefore, I endure all
[1:19:40] things for the elect's sake, that they
[1:19:43] may also obtain salvation which is in
[1:19:45] Christ Jesus with eternal glory. Is a
[1:19:48] faithful saying. For if we be dead with
[1:19:50] him, we shall also live with him. If we
[1:19:53] suffer, we shall also reign with him. If
[1:19:56] we deny him, he will also deny us. If we
[1:20:00] believe not, yet he abide the faithful.
[1:20:01] He cannot deny himself.
[1:20:04] I'll just say it like this. In all
[1:20:06] things, give thanks.
[1:20:10] Let your life express gratitude.
[1:20:14] Don't make excuses while you're down in
[1:20:16] the dumps. God don't accept it. Don't
[1:20:20] try to get other people to accept it.
[1:20:23] Learn to crucify your selfish flesh and
[1:20:26] remain grateful for all things.
[1:20:30] Psalms 30:1 says, "Thou has turned for
[1:20:34] me my mourning into dancing.
[1:20:39] Thou has put off my sackcloth and girded
[1:20:41] me with gladness.
[1:20:44] To the end that my glory may sing praise
[1:20:47] to thee and not be silent. Oh Lord my
[1:20:49] God, I will give thanks unto thee
[1:20:52] forever. I just say every morning when
[1:20:54] you wake up, this is the day the Lord
[1:20:56] have made. I will rejoice and be glad in
[1:20:58] it. He has turned your mourning into
[1:21:02] dancing. All the negativity in your
[1:21:04] life. All the sorrow, he's turned it
[1:21:07] into happiness, to joy.
[1:21:10] Don't wait to everything's done to start
[1:21:12] walking by faith.
[1:21:14] Sometimes you got to walk through the
[1:21:16] furnace, but if you do, God will meet
[1:21:19] you there.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; Psalms 92:1, it's a psalm for the
[1:21:24] Sabbath day. Say the Sabbath day. Well,
[1:21:26] we're, you know, today we're looking at
[1:21:28] it as
[1:21:30] the resurrection day.
[1:21:32] The Bible says, "It is a good thing to
[1:21:34] give thanks unto the Lord, and to sing
[1:21:36] praises unto his name, oh most high, to
[1:21:39] show forth thy loving kindness in the
[1:21:42] morning, and thy faithfulness every
[1:21:43] night, upon an instrument of 10 strings,
[1:21:46] and upon a sultry, and upon the harp
[1:21:48] with a solemn sound. For thou, Lord, has
[1:21:51] made me glad through thy work. I will
[1:21:56] triumph in the work of thy hands."
[1:21:59] Oh, just to get somebody to believe the
[1:22:01] word here today, to get somebody to hang
[1:22:04] on to this word and and and and and
[1:22:06] become what the instrument that God
[1:22:08] wants us to be. Psalms 106 verse1,
[1:22:11] praise ye the Lord. Oh, give thanks unto
[1:22:14] the Lord for he is good and his mercy
[1:22:16] endureth forever. You know, I read that
[1:22:17] like eight times in the book of Psalms.
[1:22:19] That very same thing. I mean, for God's
[1:22:23] mercy endure it forever. That ought to
[1:22:26] be enough to make us thankful.
[1:22:29] Verse two, who can utterly who can utter
[1:22:32] the mighty acts of the Lord? Who can
[1:22:34] show forth all his praise? I wish there
[1:22:37] was I wish we'd have uh some competition
[1:22:40] in here
[1:22:42] that we would just try to uh show forth
[1:22:45] all his praises,
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; right? Not just some of them, but all of
[1:22:50] them.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; That that give him what he's worthy of.
[1:22:54] I mean Ephesians 1:15, "Wherefore I also
[1:22:59] uh I also after I heard of your faith in
[1:23:01] the Lord Jesus and the love unto all
[1:23:03] saints, cease not to give thanks for
[1:23:07] you, making mention of you in my
[1:23:10] prayers."
[1:23:12] I wonder if I was to ask today, how many
[1:23:16] times did you wake up this week in the
[1:23:19] morning or sometime in the course of the
[1:23:22] day, you sat time aside
[1:23:25] to give thanks to God, make mention
[1:23:29] of all of your brothers and sisters,
[1:23:32] right?
[1:23:34] You know, when you pray for others, God
[1:23:35] just seems to put his favor towards you.
[1:23:39] In everything give thanks, for this is
[1:23:41] the will of God
[1:23:43] in Christ Jesus concerning you
[1:23:45] personally.
[1:23:47] So there may not be anybody in this
[1:23:49] church that'll take this message, but
[1:23:52] make sure you take it.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; You take it. Let your testimony be a
[1:23:57] life of gratitude. Start pressing that
[1:24:00] when people look at you, they only see
[1:24:02] gratitude.
[1:24:04] Let it be absent from murmuring,
[1:24:06] complaining, any kind of negativity.
[1:24:10] I tell you, if you keep your thoughts
[1:24:11] positive, your words will be positive.
[1:24:15] Let it be filled. Let your life be
[1:24:17] filled with an expression of gratitude
[1:24:21] for this is the will of God
[1:24:25] in Christ Jesus concerning you. Let's
[1:24:27] stand together. God bless you.
[1:24:40] You know, just before service, Brother
[1:24:42] Ron, um, you all sang that song at the
[1:24:46] Hallelujah side. And Brother Ron, 60
[1:24:48] seconds before you started singing that,
[1:24:52] I wrote it down. I want to sing that
[1:24:53] after service.
[1:24:55] So, I thought that was so good.
[1:25:05] Amen. Can we sing How Great Thou Ar
[1:25:28] Oh Lord my God,
[1:25:34] when I in awome wonder
[1:25:41] consider
[1:25:43] all
[1:25:45] the worlds thy hands [singing] have
[1:25:49] made.
[1:25:52] I see [singing] the stars
[1:25:58] here. Hear the rolling thunder.
[1:26:05] Thy power throughout
[1:26:09] the universe
[1:26:13] display.
[1:26:15] [music]
[1:26:16] Then sings [singing] my soul,
[1:26:21] my s Savior God to thee.
[1:26:27] [music and singing]
[1:26:28] How great thou are.
[1:26:33] How great thou are.
[1:26:39] Then sings my soul, [screaming]
[1:26:43] my Savior God to thee.
[1:26:50] How great thou are.
[1:26:55] How [screaming] great thou are.
[1:27:01] and through the wood.
[1:27:05] And for as glad I wonder
[1:27:11] and hear the birds
[1:27:15] swing sweetly [singing] in the tree.
[1:27:22] When I look down
[1:27:26] from lofty [singing]
[1:27:29] mountain grander
[1:27:33] and hear that the brook
[1:27:37] and feel the gentle breeze. [singing]
[1:27:44] and sings my soul,
[1:27:47] my Savior God to [music] thee,
[1:27:54] how great thou are.
[1:27:59] How great thou are.
[1:28:05] and sings my soul,
[1:28:09] my Savior God to thee,
[1:28:15] how great thou are.
[1:28:20] How great thou are.
[1:28:26] And [singing] when I think
[1:28:30] that God is son not sparing
[1:28:36] then [singing]
[1:28:37] to die
[1:28:40] I scarce can take [singing] it in
[1:28:46] that on [singing] the crossing
[1:28:52] gladly bearing
[1:28:56] He bled and died
[1:29:00] to take away my sin.
[1:29:06] Then sings my [singing and music] soul,
[1:29:10] my savior God [music] to thee.
[1:29:16] [singing]
[1:29:17] How great thou are.
[1:29:22] How great thou are. [singing]
[1:29:27] Then sings my soul,
[1:29:30] my savior God to thee. [singing]
[1:29:36] [music]
[1:29:37] How great thou are.
[1:29:40] [singing]
[1:29:42] How great thou art.
[1:29:46] [singing]
[1:29:48] Then Christ shall come
[1:29:52] with shout of acclamation
[1:29:58] and take me home.
[1:30:02] What joy shall fill my heart. [singing]
[1:30:08] Then I shall bow.
[1:30:13] humble adoration
[1:30:16] [singing]
[1:30:18] and their proclaim.
[1:30:21] My God, how great thou art.
[1:30:26] [singing]
[1:30:28] The things my soul,
[1:30:32] my Savior done to thee,
[1:30:38] how great thou are.
[1:30:42] [singing and music] You're great, Lord.
[1:30:44] Great thou art.
[1:30:48] Then sings [music] our souls.
[1:30:53] Savior God to thee.
[1:30:59] How great thou are.
[1:31:04] How great thou art.
[1:31:10] Amen.
[1:31:13] How great is our God?
[1:31:19] How great is his word? Okay.
[1:31:24] Great is our God.
[1:31:29] How great is his word.
[1:31:33] He's the greatest one
[1:31:38] that ever was heard.
[1:31:43] He rode back the water
[1:31:48] of the mighty Red Sea
[1:31:53] and he said, "I will lead you.
[1:31:58] Put your trust
